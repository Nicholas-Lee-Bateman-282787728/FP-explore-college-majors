4606646,5,B0058YPKIA,I really like how the show goes out of its way to appear spooky in a fairy tail sort of way. Definitely something I'll be watching.,1319932800,5,131,4.076923076923077
4606647,5,B0058YPKIA,"Grimm is awesome! My kind of show. Great makeup, story line, great everything! Highly recommend! I think all that watch this will like it.",1319068800,2,138,4.791666666666667
4606796,4,B0058YPKIA,"A paranormal police procedural show. The first three seasons are solid but the show begins to jump the shark around season 4. The world building becomes unstable and the show begins to break it's own rules (i.e. birth of a magic star baby, and a major character turns into a critter).",1526601600,,284,4.588235294117647
4606797,5,B0058YPKIA,"I didn't know what this show was when I started it... I was just looking for something to watch. I ABSO LOVED EVERY SEASON!!!!! I hated that it ended. I am now show-less. I keep looking for something to get into, but I keep comparing very show to Grimm! I may just re-watch every season...",1526601600,,289,4.2727272727272725

4606800,5,B0058YPKIA,"Even though the finale was a bit confusing, I found the Grimm to be extremely entertaining and one of the best series I had ever seen. I could had gone for more or perhaps a spinoff of the original.",1525737600,,198,4.102564102564102
4606801,5,B0058YPKIA,Great character development. Never gets boring.,1525305600,,47,7.0
4606802,5,B0058YPKIA,"I'm a major Grimm fan, the finest ensemble cast I've found on tv.  The premise sounds nuts, but they make it completely convincing, and it's fascinating to see the characters develop from season to season.  So sad it was cancelled.  Been watching the entire series in reverse order, and I'm amazed at how good it was, even in Season 1 (though they did need some German coaching, which they got by the next season).",1525219200,,414,4.5675675675675675
4606803,4,B0058YPKIA,... Season 1 is a reminder of how much fun this show was before the idiotic Adalind subplot/story arc took over.,1524614400,,112,4.380952380952381

4606846,4,B0058YPKIA,"I guess its how the writers are trying to evolve the character. They did a good job in that the guy so good it makes you want to puke at the same time he's very dishonest. I don't know but im in season 1 so far and I would have told my partner as soon as I verified what I was up against and give them the choice of staying with me or not. Its like hes trying to hold on to life that is now a lie. After their home is attacked and he still says nothing by this time his girl friend is very suspicious that something so not right. He not even honest with his partner which opens him up to danger. Grimm is taking on himself to watch out for these people and keeping them unaware and its not working, Its slowing falling apart. A couple of scene the near mention of the name grim and super naturals become scared even though he's unarmed and looks like a boy scout --it was unbelievable they could have literally have killed him.",1524009600,,927,4.043478260869565

4606852,5,B0058YPKIA,Grimm might just be one of the best shows that I've ever watched. The creativity of this show is incredible and I really wish that it hadn't ended so soon.,1521763200,,155,4.2

4606855,3,B0058YPKIA,"Clearly I'm in the tiny minority, but you have to be kidding me.  What a B-movie serial, solidly suited for ordinary TV!  The main character is a great B-movie actor, with barely credible acting abilities (he's pretty bad), and the dialogue too is cringe worthy, with so many cliches it turns some of the action into comedy, whether intentional or not.  What they do well is get you to jump when one of bloatfarts, or whatever the monsters call themselves, snatches somebody.  Of course its all pretty preposterous that these guys just pop up in what is otherwise supposed to be a normal world--like, where have they been all these years if they're suddenly munching on humans.  Okay, granted I didn't get past the first two episodes, but the just the aforementioned acting and dialogue were enough to give me the creeps.",1521676800,,821,4.753521126760563

4606907,5,B0058YPKIA,I started this show mostly out of curiosity since my mom and sister have been watching it since it started. Let me say that I got hooked after two episodes and have been watching non-stop since! Such a great story with lovable characters and unexpected humorous moments thanks to Wu. I'll be sad when I finish the series.,1520121600,,321,4.551724137931035

4606909,5,B0058YPKIA,"I love the fact that it was always something new to battle, not boring at all. And when you think of our world, all the crimes, deviant criminals, and the horror of what so call, normal criminals do, you can actually see the vessen in them. Normal, people don't do things like that. So, yeah, it kind of helps put things in perspective. I loved them all, specially Monroe and Rosemarie, actually all of them. Great show to binge watch. 5 Stars for me.",1519257600,,451,4.380952380952381
4606910,4,B0058YPKIA,What's the deal with the commercials at the beginning of each streaming episode ???  I pay for prime so I don't have to endure commercials!!!,1518652800,,141,4.64
4606911,5,B0058YPKIA,"Probably the best season to watch... along with 2, 3, and part of 4. However, after season 4, I think they lost its direction. I lost heart after the whole Nick story and how he couldn't get over Juliette's turning. Seriously, how do you mess up a dynamic relationship like that?

For new viewers, stick to season 1-3 for full viewing and season 4-6, just don't even watch it.",1518566400,,376,4.449275362318841
4606912,1,B0058YPKIA,"This show must appeal to the lowest common denominator, not sure why all the high reviews. The plot is simple and has no real complexity, the characters likewise. The ""special effects"" are special to be sure, some of the worst CG I have seen, use some prosthetic makeup. The ""beasts"" are the same tired CG face change every time and lack any creativity. Maybe just a crap first season.",1518307200,,385,4.594202898550725
4606913,5,B0058YPKIA,This is a great show for any fantasy fan! It's greatly written and follows the stories of the Grimm brothers accurately. I binged watch through the first season -- I love all the characters; the actors are mediocre but the story line keeps everything going smoothly. You end up loving all the characters and the people that play them. There is lots of action (great fight scenes) and super creepy/scary scenarios.,1518134400,,413,4.830985915492958

4606990,5,B0058YPKIA,"Loved this series. I was hooked just a few episodes in... sad that it's over. Certainly worth watching. It's got some comedy, plenty of action, mystery, suspense, twists, romance, creativity... what more could you ask for?",1517961600,,222,5.194444444444445
4606991,5,B0058YPKIA,"So far I am really enjoying this series. It's got the occult, action and mystery with a little bit of romance.

4606998,5,B0058YPKIA,"I'm sad, I'm at the end of the season. The last episode, the final, the end. I love all the characters, all great actors, a ton of interesting beasts, action galore. The pairing of characters all a perfect fit, even when the pairs changed you accept it and they grow on you. Humor, action, love, hate, blood and guts, all of it is in Grimm. I would love to see new seasons. I miss my Grimm cast, all of them are my favorites. Buy the season 6 DVD set for 19.00 cheaper than the 30.00 streaming.",1514073600,,494,4.15625

I'm not going to do a deep dive into a review of the series, that would take far too long, but if you're new to the show, you definitely need to start with season 1, and watch every episode in order, as each episode builds on the previous one and follows a six season story arc.",1506643200,,400,4.32

4607220,4,B0058YPKIA,"To preface this, this show is fantastic. And this is definitely a good buy.
However, when I got mine, it is not the plastic case shown here. Mine came as a paperback booklet with the discs in slots.
Not a great case, it was slightly bent from shipping.
It did however, have two collectors cards inside. I did not return it, as this was not a big deal for me. The cards are really neat, I would have liked a plastic case instead, but will happily accept the one it's in.
I don't know if this is the case they all come in, and the picture here online is just false, or if it's a chance thing.

All in all, very happy with this, one and only reason for 4 stars, is because I expected, and wanted, a plastic case. Otherwise, certainly worth buying.",1501459200,,744,4.166666666666667

4607225,2,B0058YPKIA,"It's carefully crafted to appeal to the crowd of people who think Whedon rocks (so funny! so lighthearted!), and I won't sway anyone among those that the show isn't awesome. In other words, if you think it's fuuuunnny to see a tram car packed with people to erupt into spontaneous dance when someone pulls out a boombox and plays ""YMCA"" (of all songs), and you are happy with hearing a bee expert explain that he just saw a queen bee fly around (while they never leave home), and get all worried and upset about a bunch of breaking-and-entering punks *almost* being killed only to be saved by the hero...then yes, maybe this show is for you. Rest assured, no under-age protagonist will come to harm.

It has ridiculous dialogue, with the leads cracking little jokes while their relative who they just talked to dies of cancer. The primary actors are quite likable, however, the lead is the least credible detective imaginable...he talks and acts like a school teacher maybe. Production values, sound, lighting - the whole technical side - is fine.

The X Files managed to be a mature fantasy show 25 years back, appealing to a vast cross section of viewers across the globe. Shows like this one appeal to the emotionally stunted crowd craving the guaranteed happy ending, PG12 violence, chaste sexiness, and corny jokes.",1499731200,,1320,4.81057268722467

In episode 3 the main character for some reason decides to save a freaky beast that just on previous episode attempted to murder of his ant but instead stuck him with a poison which he barely survived.  Yep, instead of killing the beast Grimm decided to save her life (for some reason) and instead proceeded to shoot a character that is there to help him and caries information vital to his survival.

Bravo!

After this type of mind numbing idiocy the only way to resurrect the series is to turn episode 4 into a comedy in which the main character is repeatedly struck with a snow shovel upside the head as a comic relief.",1498176000,,665,4.563025210084033

4607322,5,B0058YPKIA,"I love this series. It's a dark twist to a present day world mixed with some familiar fairy tales and a spin on the characters and other fantasies. The main characters are likable.  It's not like Once Upon A Time but if I had to compare the two, it would be the darker, more mature audience of the two.  I can't wait to get to the next episode just to see what creative character they introduce you too.",1493424000,,403,4.153846153846154

4607362,1,B0058YPKIA,"I've watched 17 eps of Grimm, hoping it would go from a decent show to a good show, but it hasn't.  Pretty much, each episode, Nick, the police detective and grimm, tracks down a new criminal/monster and vanquishes it.  Generally he does this b/c, as he's doing a police investigation, he uses his grimm powers to see someone who's the new animal/man hybrid (Vessen) of the week.  This clues him in that this must be the bad guy.  One wonders if there are actually any human criminals in Portland.  Are ALL the world's ills perpetrated by Vessen?  Spoiler alert!  Guess what Hitler was?

There's not the legitimate mystery, criminal psychology, or forensic work that's so fascinating in good criminal dramas, nor is there the campy fun and comradery between the characters in Buffy or Supernatural.  There are occasional hints of an over-arcing grand plot, but they're so thinly dispersed that they just kind of become annoying.  If there's a bigger picture, get on with it.  :-/

I don't think this show quite knows what it wants to be, so it just takes a little of everything, but doesn't end up as good as the things it's drawing from.  There's not much depth.  Acting is decent.  Special effects are cheesy b/tolerable.  Writing's ok.  The plots are hella simple.  Over all, if you have some time to blow and like this sort of genre, check it out.  It's easy to watch and mindlessly enjoyable.

EDIT:  I decided to stick with the show, and it does get better.  Season 2 is good, better than the 1st.  Season 3 has some hokey bits, but is enjoyable.  Season 4 continued with the hokey, but I don't mind a bit of camp, so I stuck with it, hoping it would get back to Season 2 quality and actually explain what was going on.  Then ep. 14, ""Bad Luck,"" happened, and I am done.  The show jumps the biggest, fattest shark ever, and nose dives into soap opera drivel territory.  I will not grace this show with any more time or disappointment, and, according to fan posts, and what I've read of the future plot, I've made the right decision.

The face-changing-to-monster shtick is heavily over used and some of the situations are just silly, such as the bee episode. The actors and everyone on screen do well enough with the material, but this is like a Saturday morning pseudo-horror-esque, quasi crime mystery show. Which I realize is a rather weird way to describe something but I feel that it's accurate for Grimm.

4608679,3,B0058YPKIA,"Got 4 episodes in and stopped.  Dark and fanciful with more gore than you would expect from network. Has potential, but the show follows the same formula every episode and the acting can be quite poor at times.  Show moves too slowly on the larger plot to keep my interest.",1485734400,,273,4.44

4608740,5,B0058YPKIA,"A refreshingly new take on the old fairytale type stories.  This seems to be a new trend with several shows offering their own interpretations, but I think this is one of the best.  We, the viewer, are thrown into this new reality along with Nick and learn and explore along with him.  Juliet is somewhat interesting, as is Hank, but Monroe is a fascinating character and even more endearing through his struggles and unexpected quirks.  There are several subplots to explore and good character arcs that can provide interesting watching through several conflict driven episodes.  Season one ends with many possibilities to come and leaves viewers wanting to know more.  Well done!",1485561600,,681,5.035714285714286

4609509,4,B0058YPKIA,"Let me say first that Grimm isn't for everyone. If you don't like sci-fi/fantasy, or strange creatures, or dark themes, you probably won't like Grimm. But if you enjoy sci-fi/fantasy, and are intrigued by strange creatures, Grimm may be right down your alley.

One of the things I enjoy most about Grimm is the cast, and the humor. Overall, Grimm deals with dark themes, but there's lots of comedic relief. The main character Nick develops close friendships with several strange and likable characters, who have become the protagonists in the series.

If you order Season 1 or Season 5 on Blu-ray, be sure to check if you're getting the standard plastic Blu-ray cases (which I prefer), or the crummy cardboard cases. The cardboard cases have more artwork, but are a hassle when removing/inserting the disks.",1484956800,5,807,4.970370370370371

4609868,5,B0058YPKIA,"I remember reading some of Grimm's Fairy Tales as a child. When I started looking at the series it was somewhat unsettling. It caught me off guard and completely unexpected from what I remembered as a child. The sudden ""voguing"" of the Grimm characters, the level of violence, made by initial viewing spotty. But I have gone back to it and find it most intriguing. Like POI (of which I am a huge fan) it has a strong storyline and each episode contains an element that will connect the story within the story. Like Once Upon A Time, Grimm borrows characters from other fairy tales whose characters live in the Enchanted Forest or in Oz or Wonderland which is a delightful crossover. Overall, I am a Grimm fan now. I like good drama series of this genre. There are many out there but so far, none matches the quality of characterization and execution of the stories. But I am a fairy tale person. I believe in Peter Pan and unicorns.",1484697600,,932,4.488235294117647

4609997,3,B0058YPKIA,"I would have rated this show 5 out of 5 except for one thing. It is one of the most predictable shows I have ever watched. In other words, the viewer finds out who the criminal is, then they have to sit through forty minutes of watching a bunch of stereotypes trying to figure out what took the viewer two minutes to do. If you are finished watching Once Upon A Time and are looking for a fractured fairy tale romp with enjoyable dark humor, then by all means, watch this show. But, if you are looking for a crime solving show that excites you and has a great villain, I recommend Sherlock.",1484524800,,590,4.230088495575221

It's the amazon streaming service that loses the star for me.

Apparently their app doesn't play well with android devices and I can only watch the show while on the computer. Netflix gets more consistent view time from me for this reason.

4610526,5,B0058YPKIA,"Love this show, loved it from day one back when it all started. Every season has been spot on (seasons 1-5) delivering without disappointment. It is a disappointment that season 6 is the final one for Grimm with only 13 episodes to boot. There are so much more storylines and life left in this show. Everytime we like or love a NBC show, they end up cancelling it just after a few seasons. Its like if its not the #1 show week after week, they are ready to can it. Very sad to see Grimm go but hey, there's always binge watching all the seasons all over again. Yes, its that good that you can watch it over again and again. Love all main characters even when they aren't so nice and not playing on the same team. Just hope they (the writers) don't give a less than par ending with loose ends and unanswered questions. Seems like a lot of good shows really mess up in the final episode. We will see, as we will be watching every final episode of season 6. Would love to see these same actors in other shows!",1484006400,,1006,4.190721649484536

Some are good and some are bad, but you never know what will happen next.  The idea came from Grimm's Fairy Tales. It's not exactly thought provoking but it is entertaining. I also like that it takes place in Portland, Oregon.",1483574400,,377,4.890625

4611297,4,B0058YPKIA,"After waiting forever for this to come on Netflix, I finally started watching this through Prime.  Not what I expected at all given that the original promos years ago made it seem like medieval fantasy.  I honestly do not understand the gushing over this series.  I like it, quite a bit actually, but it's not nearly as interesting or inventive as, say, Supernatural, which it seems to try to mimic in many ways.  Don't get me wrong, it's thoroughly enjoyable, but only as a swiss-cheese-plot, pop modern fantasy of mediocre quality.  I just happen to like fantasy well enough that I can bump it up a star from average.",1483315200,,619,4.6422018348623855
4611298,5,B0058YPKIA,"Grimm is a freshing  look at the world of horror. Each character had a unique personality in the story. The police officer Grimm was a good surprise in this show. Great surprise for him to learn about his background.  It kept my interest in the story. How his background kept developing throughout the story and will keep developing through the next episodes. Good suspense and the show was well done. I can see the chemistry with Grimm and the other officer.
I really liked this show. Not a dull moment.
Can't wait to see what is next on Grimm.",1483315200,,545,4.494949494949495

4611315,4,B0058YPKIA,"Well sustained mood and atmosphere, competent acting, very good low-light scenes, and careful pacing make this series work.  It's not a show I'll binge watch, but that's not a negative observation.  It means that the show gets a little adrenaline running, so that I prefer to take some cooling down time between episodes.

4611317,4,B0058YPKIA,"This series covers some serious ground at times, including the problem of trying to find one's place in the world, age-old problems such as deception and betrayal, and societal problems such as bigotry.

4611886,5,B0058YPKIA,"I recently started binge-watching GRIMM, and I have to say that it's very well written with a good pace and only a few ""jump the shark"" moments.  All the actors (except one) are believable and have good chemistry.  All of them EXCEPT Bitsie Tulloch.  She may well be an excellent actress, but her portrayal of Juliette Silverton makes me cringe.  It's almost like you can hear her reading the lines of a high school play and forcing the acting to match it.",1482192000,,456,4.524390243902439

4612207,3,B0058YPKIA,"6 Episodes in and I'm still trying to figure out why people think this show is so great.  It is super cheesy and so full of contradictions and plot holes that I don't see why everyone isn't yelling, ""Really!?"" throughout... like my mind is screaming.

I give it kudos for the idea (though this is no Fables), but it loses points for execution and throwing all logic out the window each episode.

(Seriously though... this guy's ONLY power is to see the creatures ""sometimes""... and they can ""sometimes"" tell he's able to see them... otherwise he's normal.  And why do they keep shaking their monster faces away if NOBODY CAN SEE THEM!?  Why do they keep having them shift in and out when upset or whatever... if NOBODY CAN SEE THEM!?  Oh... so the audience knows?  That's stupid)",1481414400,,779,4.601449275362318
4612208,5,B0058YPKIA,"Love this show! Crime drama with supernatural intrigue. Decent love story, good vs evil is more naturally stated than having supreme villain and thus making for more interesting storytelling. The antagonists are just a flawed or manipulated to wrong doing just like any normal person can be. In essence GRIMM is a good monster show that doesn't forget to reflect the best and worst sides of humanity and creates an intricate and relatable universe.",1481414400,,448,5.0675675675675675

4612453,5,B0058YPKIA,"Grimm is a modern day superhero story, and as such it has all of that genre's strengths and weaknesses. Likable but inaccessible main character? Check. Story is only as strong as the villain? Check. Special effects have the potential to derail a scene? Check. But watch this one anyway, for one simple reason:

The cast.

This cast is one of the best you could ever hope to find, and they bring it with admirable consistency. Everyone from the leads to the recurrings all handle what could easily become a jumble with remarkable ease. The writing is solid, the overarching story very good with even the monster of the week showing enough variance to keep your interest up. Give this one a shot if this is even remotely your cup of tea. There's a lot to like here.",1480636800,,763,4.562043795620438

4612506,5,B0058YPKIA,I already own the DVD format and I thought buying also the Blu-ray format will enhance the picture quality from the DVD format..  The Blu-ray format does enhance the picture quality over the DVD and now all my GRIMM collection from season 1 to season 4 collection are all Blu-ray version.  Soon I will be purchasing the Season 5 and I hate to see this show get cancelled after season 6.,1479859200,,386,4.422535211267606

4612510,2,B0058YPKIA,"Another Hollywood production with a plot-generating gimmick (i.e., people who can morph into beasts, including bees.) The lot includes at least one likeable specimen with a sense of humor, who has given up eating human flesh (we've seen this trick before with ""good"" vampires). Members of the Grimm family (one of whom is the policeman protagonist) can actually catch people while they morph for a few seconds during their everyday existence--even though this morphing remains invisible to everyone else. That's a synopsis of the first 4 episodes, because I quit after that. Presumably, the series will keep on grinding variations on this theme, to the delight of most adolescents and the mentally challenged. There is a certain kind of barbarity/banality to all these Hollywood attempts at mass entertainment. Their characters are two dimensional, the acting lacking nuance, the scripts repetitive at their core. They deserve to be ridiculed to extinction. 1 1/2 stars",1479772800,,969,5.339869281045751

4612585,4,B0058YPKIA,"Don't let the four stars for this review give you second thoughts, Grimm is entertaining and worth the look.  Even though Grimm is fantacy, the premise is based on real issues with the racial and social barriers individuals have to overcome from either 'being different', or dealing with those who don't 'fit in the norm', letting go of old traditions that are harmful or hurtful to others.  In this respect it brings in interesting story-lines of trying to bring balance into a world that is trying to live in another world that is not aware of ""their"" existence, and would never accept them if they were to be exposed.",1479254400,,620,4.678899082568807

4613875,4,B0058YPKIA,"I was surprised by how much I enjoyed this show.  Initially, it seemed like just another superhero versus the monster of the week show, and it does have that element, but several shows into the season a major subplot having to do with the historic rulers of the monster world entered the scene and the police captain appears to be much more than a mere mortal and is in rebellion against those rulers (exactly how isn't clear), which provides enough additional drama to hold _my_ interest.
There have been several shows where I just checked out early or jumped over 20 or so minutes of the plot, but generally I've enjoyed watching and it has been a good diversion from my fairly mundane life.
I'm not good with shows that feature high tension action, but I find enough humor - and distance from my reality - that it works for me here.  The Grimm, Detective Nick Burkhardt played by David Giuntoli, is a little to pretty for my taste, I would prefer someone who looks a little more battle hardened, but he's not that bad an actor, and I can see why the show has lasted for more than 100 episodes.  I'm not sure if I'll watch season two; well, we'll see.",1476403200,2,1153,4.429245283018868

4614168,5,B0058YPKIA,One of my favorite all time shows. I just started watching it again from S1 E1.,1475107200,,79,4.0
4614169,4,B0058YPKIA,"Slow to get started, picks up later in the season (episode 15) when the character of Rosalee Calvert is added to the show. At that point the show starts to transition from a police procedural, episodic, format, to much more of a serial format. It still relies on the police procedural structure to drive each episode, but the overarching story begins to become the main focus, making it more enjoyable to binge watch.

For Portland natives, it's fun to pick out all the Portland locations, and the complete disregard for actual Portland geography in the show.

The main character of Nick Burkhardt was terribly miscast (played by David Giuntoli) but eventually you can get over him. The rest of the cast is great, so having a terrible leading man doesn't completely ruin the show. (And when I say that David Giuntoli is terrible, I mean it in the same way that Keanu Reeves or Tom Cruise is terrible: an action star who isn't attractive, funny, likeable, or very believable as someone possessing incredible strength and reflexes. If you think that Keanu Reeves and Tom Cruise are attractive, and/or you have no problem with these skinny white men supposedly completely of beating the c*** out of everyone they meet, then you'll probably love David Giuntoli).",1475107200,,1258,4.873831775700935

4614198,5,B0058YPKIA,"Very nice twist on the monsters, fairy tales, and more.  This is what good story telling should be like or at least if u remake a classic put your own twist to it.  I knew from the first episode I would definitely come back and watch this series again and again.  I do kinda wish the grim reapers had other special weapons to use then the traditional reaper  blade.  Still  for the first season with very limited funds and risk I didn't mind the same ol blade.  Am glad the show aired on Fridays because I totally do not watch any tv that day glad my 4k TV has something to do then watch me eat and lay waste on my couch.

Hopefully they make a sequel to the grim tv series or movie version of it.  Sad the series is ending at only 6 seasons,  theres still plenty of stories to tell as long as creative minds exist and grim love is there we can overcome money issues and ratings!!!!!",1474934400,3,883,4.111111111111111

4614252,2,B0058YPKIA,"While I really wanted to like this series as the concept sounded interesting, the reality was uninspiring. Perhaps the scripts, the actors and the directing were intentionally poor in order to fit some kind of preconceived way someone felt this genre should be produced, but it did not appeal to me. While a series like this depends on unbelievable supernatural beings, requiring a departure from reality for the viewer, the parts of the series where things should have been real--like the police work--also departed from reality so much that it just ruined the show for me.
There were some bright spots, however. The cinematography was fairly good. Russell Hornsby and Elizabeth Tulloch were convincing in their roles. But for me it seemed the rest of the production was rather bland and unpolished.",1474848000,,800,5.068181818181818

4614257,5,B0058YPKIA,"Either you love the premise or hate it.  I loved it.  Great special effects of people morphing into monsters (or wesen, as they prefer to be called).
The premise is that there are, within the human race, some people who - on the surface - look human but have a dual human/animal nature.  Not everyone can recognize these people.  Only a Grimm, a human,has the ability to see them when they morph - either under stress or deliberately. Grimms inherit the ability from other family members.  Usually upon the death of a close relative, a new Grimm will start seeing these wesen.  If a family member has not prepared the new Grimm, he thinks he is going crazy. Grimms over the past hundreds of years have been wholesale executioners of wesen.  But this Grimm is compassionate and a police detective whose goal is to help the good wesen and jail the bad ones.",1474848000,,855,4.549019607843137

Now I'm reviewing the first season to let newcomers, those who appreciate the horror genre, know that this is an amazing series unlike any others offered on mainstream TV!  For me likable, even lovable, main characters are a key factor in deciding if I'll continue watching.  Monroe, Rosalee, and Bud are ""wessen"" who remain steadfastly lovable while the others evolve as their mysterious natures develop.  Each Grimm episode keeps us guessing:  Who is really evil to the core? Or can they allow their basic humanity to subdue the beast within?  Even those wessen who choose to live a ""normal"" life constantly struggle with conflicting urges.  Grimm is really a study in human nature and the mythology created by human minds. And the fact that several of the actors are fluent in German, Spanish, and French lends credence, if you will, to the history of these ancient stories.

4614345,2,B0058YPKIA,"First off, I REALLY wanted to like this show. I knew it would be prime-time-pg but still I expected thoughtful writing at the very least. This show introduces more questions than it answers, continually goes back in its decisions, and apart from one adhd character it's cast is lifeless and droll. The main character is barely likable, and after a few episodes it didn't get any better. Moreover the whole show is built on fairy tale lore, which a darker version of it would be really great, but it's lore that feels like it was written on a paper napkin by a 6yr old - and that's also a dig on how much actual lore they share with you, barely a napkins worth.

I will say that the ""Bluthbadt"" character (Silas Weir Mitchel) is hilarious and got at least a good chuckle out of me each episode... but then I realized it was the only time I liked the show. An episode before the last I watched they dropped a whole character plot arc altogether and left him in a basement to, presumably, die of starvation. It's negligent writing at its best to fill a prime time slot, and it's too bad because it had real potential.",1474243200,,1114,4.381642512077295

4614464,3,B0058YPKIA,It's a tired show device having the main character work with a cop or CIA or FBI. This show had a chance to stand out but it follows its strict episodic cop drama with a dash of supernatural to the T and it is predictable. The Grimms beast friend was my favorite part. He was a fresh character within the cookie cut who's who. I'll give season two a try but unless they swerve to left field this show is nothing special.,1473552000,,420,4.134146341463414
4614465,5,B0058YPKIA,"I had avoided this series ever since it started despite hearing others rave about it, but finally a couple of weeks ago I read a review somewhere that indicated it wasn't all about deep dark nasty vicious ugly sick relentless horror. I am a cop show fan, detective show fan, mystery fan, a sort-of sci-fi and sword-and-sorcery fan, but absolutely not a horror fan.  Steven King's Pet Cematery left me with nightmares, and I haven't read another of his books or any other horror novels since then.  And if you want to watch horror movies, you can darn well do it without me.  So I hesitantly watched the first episode of Grimm.......and I've been hooked ever since.  I'm now about halfway into the second season and still intrigued, curious, and on the verge of binge watching because I have been drawn more and more into the storylines.  The actors and actresses from the main characters to the supporting characters are very well chosen, the main plotlines and the subplots weave together seamlessly, and there's enough lighter and humorous interaction scenes interwoven with the grosser horrifying episodes that it lightens the overall tone.  My husband cut his teeth on the classic Hammer Studios horror films, and Grimm reminds me a greatly of those in a very positive way.  I will not put any spoilers or more specific details about the plotlines because I do not want to spoil it for anyone else who hasn't started watching the show.",1473552000,24,1439,4.801619433198381

4614595,4,B0058YPKIA,"Somewhere about the fourth or fifth episode in, it hit me. This series is alot like Charmed, a series I absolutely LOVED and completely binged through over the summer. Grimm has three primary characters when it comes to all of the creepy stuff: Nick, Hank and Monroe. Charmed: ditto, the three sisters. Both have ancient and mystical books that are consulted for solutions. Both have REALLY BAD guys. And both scare the wits out of me, although I have to say, for scare power, there is nothing like a Wesen jumping out at the innocent victim. Even though I KNOW it's coming,  the attack makes me jump almost every time. So, needless to say, I love this series as well. And it has the added bonus of a very handsome leading man. His eyes are to die for. Come on, Juliette... who cares if you don't remember him from your past... take a look at him!!!",1472860800,,849,4.4423076923076925

The fact that I have watched that many episodes is quite positive, because I will not continue watching if I am not entertained at all.  I would give some episodes, so far, a rating of 3 and a half stars.  There are some lines that are just plain silly and don't make sense, but since it is fantasy, I suppose that's okay.  The acting is good, and the story line is entertaining.  So far, not overly grotesque in graphic details or depictions of torture, which I would not tolerate for long.  3 to 3 and 1/2 stars.",1472774400,,614,4.205128205128205

4614714,5,B0058YPKIA,"Starting from the beginning via my Amazon Prime account. I began watching from season 3 and have followed it faithfully to date! Now retro to the beginning of the series. It's a fun little show with lots of imagination, good quality actors and great make-up artistry. All-in-all it a good 45 mins of entertainment that will get you away from the ""real world"" for a brief period.",1472083200,,378,4.656716417910448

4614722,4,B0058YPKIA,"I don't often like supernatural-themed TV shows. Couldn't stand X Files, for instance, although a lot of that was because Gillian Anderson, while a good actress, scarcely moves her face, and whispers instead of talking. That may charm some, but it irritates the heck out of me.
However, I like Grimm. Maybe because I read and re-read every Grimm's fairytale as a kid and loved them. Maybe because Giuntoli seems to get more handsome every season, and is a believable actor as well. As is Bree Turner. Bitsie Tulloch apparently graduated magna cum laude from Harvard, and wins awards for her acting. So it must be the directing that makes her lines so inane, and her delivery so soap-opera worthy. Silas Weir Mitchell is almost cute, but eventually annoying. And all the fisticuffs is so predictably over the top.
However, I'm so grateful that the director has not had the actors do that absurd whispering thing, as if people ever talk like that! (note Gillian Anderson's performance in the otherwise good ""The Fall."" No facial expression and every line whispered. Beyond silly.)
But somehow the shows are thoroughly entertaining, and absorbing. One thing I find hilarious--and probably the most overused line in all of TV--is all of the characters saying, ""Are you okay?"" as someone chokes to death, screams bloody murder, falls to the floor in a faint, cries wildly, has just slithered down a snake's gullet. Find a TV show in which someone doesn't ask that if you can!",1471824000,,1470,4.884

One of the better fantasy shows on tv, great characters, interesting stories, rarely would i buy a series once i have seen it but i made an exception here.  If it's really good (rather than the mindless reality tv the sheep masses seems to eat up) and it's on TV then it's rarely on for long which makes this show unusual since its going into season 6 i believe.

Well acted and interesting dilemmas, complex stories interwoven with a background that grows every season.

But I didn't have to see her do these things.. just hear about it afterwards.

4615022,4,B0058YPKIA,"A cop show with a fantasy twist.  Interesting characters and relationships, though the main character is probably the least likable (kind of a jerk at times, but trying to do the right thing).  German pronunciations are off, but since the characters are supposed to be American, that's understandable.  It's more watchable than most, with some long running plots on top of the episodic ""creature of the day"" pattern.  Still working through the series, but the first two seasons weren't bad. There's some humor, some romance, some action, and some decent special effects.  What's not to like?",1469318400,,591,5.114583333333333

4615234,2,B0058YPKIA,"Responding to an email from Amazon, the ""Review Your Purchases:: please share your thoughts with others on Amazon.com"" email.

I thought I'd buy the digital on Amazon, one ep at a time, as I had a chance to watch. But I had to stop even before finishing the pilot, because, while I really enjoyed the show itself, I didn't appreciate the commercials which broke in about every ten minutes. The breaks didn't coincide with the show's normal ad breaks either, one moment I was watching Grimm, the next a commercial, and not even a fade to black in between. I got disgusted and I never made it to the end. Commercials during a video I own. This makes buying video content from Amazon quite unappealing to me.

So I went offsite and bought the season on Blu-Ray for less than the cost of the digital. If you like the show or the movie, owning the discs ain't a bad thing at all. And Grimm looks like a show I'll enjoy--on my own Blu-Ray discs, that is.

Four stars, possibly five, for the show--and a big minus for the commercials.",1468540800,,1027,4.423280423280423

She in turn told me to check out Grimm so I did and I have to say there is an eery twist to it but I like it. I prefer happier story lines which is why I gave it 4 stars instead of five, Once Upon A Time is still my favorite :). The more episodes I watch the more hooked I become lol.

In this first season, some of the hokey ""inside"" jokes are clearly just Hollywood's failure to understand Oregonians. It was still a cool enough concept to keep me watching. The writing got much better & the humor leaned much less on local stereotype by season 2.",1467849600,,354,4.546875

The writing, direction, acting, all at the top of the game!!!  So, disappointed that NBC has only ordered 13 episodes for Season 6.  I guess the writing's on the wall with that decision and could possibly mean the end of Grimm.  So glad there's Amazon Prime, so I can continue this Grimm fairytale even after the show is over!!!  Come on NBC, shoot for Season 7, please!!!",1467763200,,524,4.580645161290323

The actors are perfect for their roles.  Sargeant Wu is hilarious! It would probably be a little scary for children.  It can be quite violent and gruesome.  But, in this type of story it is to be expected.  We are talking abut Vesen after all.  I love it when they go into the trailer to find out what they are up against.

4615393,3,B0058YPKIA,"First off, this is fantasy, big time.  But even with the series being fantasy I would like to see the real world aspects be more realistic.  I mean, some of the stories are simply not believable and I'm not talking about people actually being other fantasy beings.  A bit of a spoiler, but a girl that has been missing for 5+ years has an elaborate tree house in the deep woods?  What's wrong with surviving in a cave?  And, a sub plot of a kidnap victim story that simply isn't resolved?  Why include that subplot at all if you aren't going to finish it?
Yeah, nothing on TV is true to life, everything over the top.  Much like movies.  Just sad when a program doesn't have to be that way and could be much better if it weren't",1467244800,,728,4.22463768115942

4615407,3,B0058YPKIA,"My family and I stumbled across Grimm through Amazon Prime. We watch Flash, Supernatural, Psych, and Sherlock to name a few. As you can tell, we like mystery/detective series with a flare of superhuman qualities. This review is based off this aesthetic choice. Grimm is a fun tv series to watch with the family (with teenagers, not small children) on a weeknight after dinner. The family finds it to be a light hearted version of Supernatural with some storyline similarities to Flash also. It seems to be a typical male-lead who has a mysterious history he must unveil while solving minor stories. I wouldn't say I'm at the edge of my seat with this series but am overall entertained and curious where ther series goes next. I'm hoping for a strong female lead but still waiting on that. The series has some nice twists on familiar stories and takes the story into a different direction. The story is based in Portland so pointing out familiar landmarks is an adventure on its own. Grimm is a placeholder while we wait for Flash and Sherlock to start up again.",1467072000,,1061,4.679144385026738

4615452,4,B0058YPKIA,"Started watching the show when it first aired and got caught up in life among other things...

The interest to watch the show is based off of the Grimm's Fairy Tales by the Grimm Brothers that date back to the 1800's. I've always been fascinated by the fact that a lot of children's stories have a darker past to tell. So upon watching the first season through and through I have to admit, I'm still watching. Primarily to see how the stories would be intertwined in the modern world. Sure, some things aren't realistic (i. e. - people transforming into different species of creatures) though that's the beauty of a fantasy. I have to admit though, I'm not a big fan of the whole police/mob-ish story-line. I feel that's been used time and again and it's worn out. More ore less the police/crime scene/person of interest theories and stories. However, I will continue to watch the series and see how things progress.",1466985600,,916,4.654320987654321

4615454,5,B0058YPKIA,"I just finished watching the entire Once Upon A Time series and was trying to find another series to fill my twisted fairy-tale void until the new season ... Grimm certainly fits that bill!  The premise that all of Grimm's tales are true and Grimm family members are destined to take care of these monsters is delightful!  There ARE monsters among us and some don't have the best intentions ... Grimm to the rescue!  Love how the series sees the dark side of the fairy-tales and uses Nick's background as a cop to bring humanity and justice to the situation instead of just blindly killing all monsters without thought (Hello, Monroe!) ... So glad I found this!",1466985600,,661,4.632478632478633

4615608,5,B0058YPKIA,"I seem to be addicted to this show.
Before I first saw it, fairy tales were becoming  popular in Television and film, so I expected something that was quickly slapped together, without any forethought, and generic writing. But once I started watching, it drew me in.
Though they started connected to fairy tales, they seemed to be using it as a reference, but creating their own stories, and mythos only loosely based on Grimm's Fairy Tales.
I do give them a pass on some of their effects, especially in the beginning. I understand budget constraints, but wonder if they are avoiding upgrading some of their effects for consistency. The Blutbaden look a little more like a cartoon, while later introduced ""wesen"" have more realism.
That being said, I think story and performing is more important than effects. If I can accept 70's Doctor Who effects, I can accept this.
I will also say they have surprised me. There are plenty of shows where I expect things to happen, just because that's the way everyone else writes. They follow the writing formula so closely that they lose all creativity. But I haven't found too much of that here. Not sure you can get away from in completely, but they have enough to satisfy me.",1466121600,12,1217,4.713615023474178

He has to juggle all kinds of ethical, moral and legal issues as he navigates between his girlfriend, detective partner, micromanaging captain, and monster friend - some who don't know his secret, and some who have secrets of their own. An over-arching storyline concerning magic coins, ""Reapers"" who want the Grimm dead, and the mystery of who killed his parents and why, add to the fun.",1465948800,,722,4.738095238095238

I never outgrew fairy tales, and I have a somewhat macabre sense of humor, so this show is right up my alley.  I absolutely love Monroe--he's definitely a cool guy with depth, character, sincerity, and well, a bit of the dangerous...who couldn't love a wesen like that?  Actually, all the characters are wonderful--this is a semi-lighthearted series where you can cast off the everyday and let your heart soar with the imaginative story lines, inventive characters and plot lines, plus a dash of dry humor that I just love.  I have not enjoyed a series like this in I can't remember when....bring on some more, please!",1465689600,2,726,4.68503937007874

4615729,3,B0058YPKIA,"Grimm at first pale looks pretty simple. A police procedural where the criminals and crimes are taken from folk lore and fairy tales.  Chimaera like people who morph (woge) into animals.  And it is done in a very entertaining way. Scary often times.. This in and of itself would be enough for many.

However,Grimm goes much further with an understory if you will that is very complicated(in a fun way) ...  It isn't Orphan Black by any means,but it is very good..
I won't give it away.but it is well done and told.

Good acting..and produced by David Greenwalt of X-Files,Buffy,Angel,Eureka,and others...His influence is there and it is a winning one.",1465516800,,651,4.828828828828829

4615746,1,B0058YPKIA,"Geez man. Well, for one thing, Amazon should have a ""Stupid"" rating. I didn't even have to watch the whole episode when I realized this was pretty stupid when the detective walks through the forest and apparently is the only one to hear the girl's IPod?! Someone put crime scene tape up right near there! Oh, but I guess an explanation could be that the person who did it was listening to music himself or as is typical of all young kids these days, on his cell talking to his girlfriend. But that's not all that was stupid! Are we to believe that this girl (the victim) had ONLY ONE SONG ON HER IPOD??? LOL! Come on! That's a pretty expensive device to have only one song on it. No matter how good a song is, eventually you get tired of it if it just plays over and over and over...OR it just so happened to have already looped? Yeah, right. In the immortal words of Bart Simpson, that's ""JUST STOOPID!!""",1465516800,,905,4.298245614035087

It is a procedural in that they deal with a case every episode but the how and why is great and the moral questioning is good food for thought. Ive seen a season 4 episode with my mom and it looked a bit too dramatic but maybe as the series builds up to it it will not seem strange. Its a fun show but not riveting enough to get a 5 star. Really great show though, they take note of politics, history, and personal motivations in their world building.",1465430400,,515,4.108910891089109

The fairy tales are presented in ways that step outside the old story lines while often maintaining enough similarity to be recognizable. Watching the evolution of the relationships between the characters has been entertaining, and guessing which portion of the fairy tales will be influential in the story lines is fun. The makeup artist(s) for the show (or computer artist(s)?) do a great job on the non-human faces!  The character of Monroe is a friend I want to have in real life. He's very loveable and a favorite.

4615893,4,B0058YPKIA,"Definitely binge-worthy--this series plunges right into the story of the 200-year vendetta against the Grimm family for publishing those nasty stories. Of course, exactly what over-arching force is on that vendetta is a theme within the story--stay tuned. An engaging cast is helped along with a witty and imaginative script, as our Main Grimm, Nick--a detective in the Portland, Oregon, police dept., gradually realizes that all this weird stuff is actually real.  I'm reminded of the CW Network series, ""Supernatural"", in which two brothers, posing at FBI agents, seek out and destroy monsters from the netherworld.  Also, there are elements from the TV series, ""Once Upon a Time"" and ""Fringe"", so mixing these series into a playlist would be fun.  I'm only halfway into the first season,  so we'll see what weirdness awaits!",1464825600,,827,5.195488721804511

When Buffy was recruited to kill vampires, all of a sudden they start coming out of the woodwork and the same with Grimm.  I will continue watching Grimm, but not as regular as the first series.  After watching the entire first series, still haven't figured out exactly what Grimm's captain is.  If he is one of the weird faced characters, why doesn't he show it and why doesn't Grimm recognize him for one of THEM?  One minute the captain is unbeatable and the next he is on the floor.  Oh well, it is good entertainment and as such is allowed a bit of latitude.",1464134400,,691,4.488

4616251,5,B0058YPKIA,"A welcome break from your typical series. Innovative and unusual. Watching, you start to remember the bedtime stories you heard as a child, so it brings some depth to the experience. Most of us forget our childhoods, but it's all still there in our unconscious, and watching this series lets you recall some of what you forgot you knew. Some standard plot development stuff in here, but it doesn't diminish the feelings, rather gives them a context to exist in. Grimm's Stories was always my favorite as a child because they have depth and believability. A delight to watch.",1463270400,,574,4.808080808080808

The production resources of Canada and the United States polish this series into a grabber.  Story lines are as non-repetitive as the Buffy series.  Make-up and CG are great.  The acting serves to move varying plotlines and predicaments along with dispatch.  Each annual series is twenty-two episodes.",1463184000,,454,4.881578947368421

The only draw back is that a few of the actors really could use some acting lessons.  The characters of Nick, Monroe, Rosalee, and the captain are all great actors.  Some of the female actors could use some acting lessons especially Juliette.  This is why it gets four stars instead of five.  Later seasons you get some other pretty good actors arriving on the scene but Juliette's bad acting continues throughout the seasons.  So other than her the series is amazing.",1462924800,,637,4.878504672897196

4616637,4,B0058YPKIA,"Unexpectedly good.  I just finished watching Falling Skies and need a new series to binge watch. I thought I'd give Grimm a try since I wasn't really into it before.  And it is good. I am specially impressed with Silas Weir Mitchell who plays Monroe.  He's a character actor from Prison Break and has usually played ""baddie"" roles before.  Without Monroe, this would be a boring show.  And then, there's Reggie Lee (also from Prison Break) with his wise ass, tongue-in-cheek comments.  Never fails to make you laugh.",1461715200,,516,4.806818181818182

4616717,4,B0058YPKIA,"The series starts off really slow as the protagonist, Nick learns what he is and begins adjusting to it while doing his job as a detective. Not much action or drama because Nick is still inexperienced, and as with every series we don't know any of the characters well enough early on to really care whether they live or die. People get murdered every episode, but they're strangers, and won't really matter to most viewers.

The good news is that things start to pick up pretty quick, and this is just the first season. At the time of writing this I'm around episode 20 and so far this series has only gotten better as I've gone further.",1461110400,,637,4.444444444444445

There is pretty good character development, and just enough story to keep you interested on where each character is going next.  This series has a sort of Fringe-meets-CSI feel.  The premise is interesting, and the individual stories keep you on your toes as the season progresses.  The dynamic between the characters is pretty fun, too.

Like all TV series, some episodes are more gripping than others, but this show reflects few of the 'not so good' episodes.  Although the statistics (as presented in the series) vary widely, up to 80% of the violent crime in society is perpetrated by Wesen--apparently human, but secretly many species of monsters out of Grimm Fairy Tales  Some members of a lineage of a family named Grimm have the ability to see and destroy Wesen, supported by centuries of documentation, weapons and other assorted items passed down through generations.  Nick Burkhart, a detective with the Portland Police Department, is one such Grimm.  He is able to locate some Wesen who become allies throughout the series.  Together, they take on Wesen wreaking havoc.  I think the inter-relationship of the characters is well done, and each brings a special dimension to the series.  The story line for the series and for each episode present a fascinating story.",1459555200,,1019,4.988165680473373

4616955,5,B0058YPKIA,Grimm Season 1 is a great introduction to the cast! My personal favorite is Monroe a Blutbod Nick meets on one of his cases and becomes the comic relief through the the show. I made a mistake and watching the first episode from the newest season without finishing the rest of the series and I regretted it the growth of the characters and the bonds made its not a show where you can miss an episode and still catch to the storyline it's an edge of seat suspense of Grimm fantasy and I must say it's the best show I've ever found on Amazon to Binge Watch!,1459209600,,554,4.186915887850467

4617045,4,B0058YPKIA,"My wife and I like this TV series.  Fortunately we were quite wrong in our predictions that this monster dejour program would last only a couple of seasons.  I attribute its success to the strength of what began as subplots.  I do wish that the police procedures and other details were more accurate and believable.  Little things such as Monroe shooting the ogre in episode 8 of the first season.  There is one shot but 3 bullets are recovered from the ogre's body, two .600 Nitro Express and one .577.  Generally speaking three barrel firearms do not have a mechanism for firing all three rounds at the same time.  And even if that particular rifle did, firing all three of those cartridges would cause a shoulder injury.  Accuracy in the details would make the whole easier to accept in a suspension of disbelief.
I streamed this series via Amazon Prime so can not comment on any dvd's.",1459123200,3,889,4.617834394904459

4617156,5,B0058YPKIA,I watch with girlfriend so that is why I rate it 5 stars. Its hard finding something mutual as she doesnt like too much violence or dark themes. This does have a bit of a scare but so far season 1 was pretty enjoyable. There is a werewolf guy named Monroe who is sort of the comic relief and the two detectives solve cases that involve fairy tale creatures with a modern twist.,1458000000,,377,4.178082191780822

4617219,1,B0058YPKIA,"My wife likes the show.  Every now and then there is some cool special effect, but it is a formula cop show with the bad guys being some sort of monsters.
The monsters seem to know about the family and how dangerous they are , but the main character, a Seattle cop, I think, is simply a Seattle cop...that can see monsters.  Most people cannot tell if someone is a monster or not, but the Grimm's they can see the monsters.
Some monsters are silly Rat men, others are dangerous werewolves, one guy is like an Owl...whatever.",1457568000,,524,4.391752577319588

4617901,5,B0058YPKIA,When Grimm first began I didn't know what to expect.  During the first year it turned into one of my favorite series ever.  The story lines were great and I grew to love the characters!  To be great a series really needs characters you love and bad guys as well.

4617915,5,B0058YPKIA,"Don't do what I almost did, which was blow this show off after watching the first couple episodes. I thought it was going to be too..simplistic? Too much of a kids show? Too much of a cutesy fairy tale version?
Man, was I wrong! I stuck with it, and now I'm hooked. It does have plenty of grit, as well as some well-done humor.
The cast is exceptional and the stories terrific. And the setting must have helped boost portlands visitors.

Supernatural had good momentum when the started, but often led to several campy episoids. I am big fan of detective and investigative shows, as long as we do not spend an ordinate amount of time building characters. The characters on Grimm are just flushed out enough to be believable without losing the investigative feel. There is always a case, or something that needs to be solved.",1455580800,,563,4.875

4617992,5,B0058YPKIA,Excellent series!  Absolutely love this show- it has grabbed my attention from the first episode and has held my attention throughout this season.  I'm almost done with  season 2 and can't wait to get to the next Season. The fact that I love this show is surprising to me because I usually don't care for 'Cop Drama' despite being a mystery fan. Grimm however is different as it had a fairy tale twist almost where the stories by the brothers Grimm are all true! Again absolutely love this show! Can't wait for season 5 to go to Prime=) Would recommend to everyone and anyone.  If you are really on the edge as to weather to watch it or not I would recommend watching at least the first episode before you decide!,1455580800,,713,4.419847328244275

There is enough action to keep the most competitive viewer interested, while providing a bit of love interest for the romantic. Those of us who love the lore of bygone days find the Grimm Fairy Tale references very entertaining. Commitment to one's heritage runs strong in this community, and more than a few tears have been shed at memorial events.

The story line was wonderful and the show itself is a novelty amongst current television now. However, the acting in the beginning seemed almost 'forced', like the actors weren't really sure how best to portray or play their characters. Not that I expect them to go chopping people's heads off in their spare time. Overall, it only took a couple episodes before the characters became three dimensional and seemed comfortable with themselves and their interpersonal relationships.",1454284800,,644,4.707964601769912

4618402,5,B0058YPKIA,"What I especially like about Grimm, apart from the unusual theme and the lead characters (Nick and Hank), is the appearance of a likeable, fun and interesting supporting cast (Bud, Monroe, Rosalee, Wu, Trubel). As a consequence, although each episode bears a familiar theme, the supporting characters add a bit of new laughs, romance, bumbling twists, and variety. They also help to prevent me from dwelling on my general dislike of Juliette and the way she is portrayed (which is another way of saying that I am not a B. Tulloch fan. Fun stuff and the Amazon streams are flawless.

4618764,4,B0058YPKIA,"I was thoroughly surprised about how great this show turned out to be. And I can say it's only gotten better in the second season. The show takes risks and understands that sometimes everything just doesn't work out. Though it's a crime show, it strays from the standard procedural formula enough to maintain intrigue, and it's just downright entertaining. There are great fights, real emotion, and genuine mystery. People don't just move on from tragedy for the sake of plot or forgo the repercussions of learning something new. The fantasy aspect is wrapped into the world realistically as the show strives to understand how such ""creatures"" would exist around us. I started watching a few days ago and haven't stopped. I only gave it 4 of 5 because the effects were ""ok"", but have already been significantly better in the second season. And the most interesting stuff really starts to fall into place. So even if it feels slow per se in the beginning, stick with it, you'll find it to be pretty great.",1449360000,,1004,4.775862068965517

4618788,4,B0058YPKIA,This season reveals an exciting new world we thought was fun to enter. Some of the episodes were more successful than others. The weekly reliance on a MOTW (monster of the week) got a little repetitive at times. At times the show tries too hard to translate an actual tale into the new world conceived by the show. The Cinderella show was the least satisfactory in this respect. But in general I would say the stories were exciting and we kept on coming back for more.,1449100800,,468,4.453488372093023

4618914,1,B0058YPKIA,"I don't know if this show gets any better, but I watched 7 episodes, and i really can't watch this show any longer.  It's bad, really bad.

The acting is pretty bad - poorly delivered comedy lines and lots of shifty eyes for no real good reason.  Maybe it's the writing or the directing, but either way, the whole thing is just artificial.

Police procedural with a spin? Not really. Mostly just boring attempt at a monster of the week show that is not compelling in any way.  After 7 episodes, I can't even tell you the name of the main character's partner.

I'll be honest - I came into this show hoping to find something compelling, dark, and character driven.  I was hoping for Supernatural or Buffy or something else with its own unique mythology and likable characters.  I found nothing resembling those shows.  This is just bad.",1448755200,2,835,4.550335570469799
4618915,5,B0058YPKIA,"I started watching ""Once Upon A Time"" and lost interest fast.  It was too fairy tale for me and they did a break in the first season.  I did not return for the second half.
Anyway, my cousin had started watching Grimm at the same time and was loving it.  Since the other show didn't hold my interest and Id missed some of the season I didn't try it.  Over four years later I find these seasons for ten bucks each and give them a shot.
I love them!  It's a crime show, very similar to me to Rizzoli and Ilse but with the criminals being fairy tale figures.  Nicks hunting out the bad ones like his aunt said but unlike the other grimms he realizes they aren't all bad.  He teams up with one of them and they try to rid the world of bad ones. I've been watching them over thanksgiving holidays and I'm hooked.",1448755200,,807,4.101910828025478

What's on the outside is not necessarily what's on the inside.  Just because someone looks scary, doesn't mean they always are!  Good people are good and bad people are bad.  Sometimes it's hard to tell by just looking.  In Grimm, you will find that shock value you love with the moments that make you just plain feel good.

4619140,4,B0058YPKIA,It's what TV used be in the 90s.  Very x files meets quantum leap with a touch Star Gate.  It's nice that not all episodes progress the overall story.  Sometimes it's just him beating up on some random noone.,1447632000,,208,4.282051282051282

The actors do a great job playing their characters. It is so much fun. I'm sure most know about the Grimm Fairy Tails but if you don't they are very dark. Not your sweet Disney fairy tail.,1447113600,,325,4.09375

4619231,5,B0058YPKIA,"I love Grimm.  It is funny to watch after living in that area for over 20 years to see them chase a wesen into a supposed Portland wooded area but to know that they are actually shooting the scene at a location over 30 miles away (or a 45 minute drive).  Then I  always laugh at the ease with which they make it to and up Mt.  Hood.  The base almost 100 miles away.  Don't get me wrong I LOVE THIS.  I  am very familiar with other filming locations and the same things happen.  They run into a building through one entrance out another and the exit puts them blocks away from where they should be.  IT'S GREAT!  FOR scenery the Columbia River and The Dalles to Portland is  fabulous.  I am waiting for them to incorporate Mary Hill with its replica of Stonehenge into some future episodes.

The characters are developing well if not a little slower than I would like,  especially Juliette and Drew Wu. Would love to see Meisner integrated as a regular. (Could be just so I could see Damien Puckler).

I'M TOTALLY ADDICTED.",1447027200,,1022,4.3563829787234045

4619345,4,B0058YPKIA,"I am a fan of fairy tale, or sci-fi infused shows (Once, Dr. Who), so I gave Grimm a chance. I almost didn't make it past the middle of season one, but by season 2 I was hooked. I've just finished season 4, and can say that overall it's a good show. There is some comic relief here and there with well delivered one liners, or sight gags, but at times It can be very gory--lots of slashed necks, body parts, blood, and scary monsters, so I wouldn't recommend this for young kids. They do spin themes from actual Grimm fairy tales--three little pigs, princess and the frog--but here the little pigs come after the wolf, and any ""frog"" who tries to kiss the princess does not meet a happy ending.",1446508800,,694,4.305343511450381

Same for partner if main character. All need to be cohesive part of a family, including his wife. Too much secretness.  In intense shows, there needs to be comedy and family to balance out the awfullness, like in Orphan Black. Great for Halloween season.

4619443,5,B0058YPKIA,"Watch all five seasons ! Grimm is very Addicting ! With each season ,it gets better and better,All the seasons are Great ! You get to know the characters and grow to love them all. The character that plays the Grimm can make anyone go from there human self, to there animal self just by looking at them. Everyone is scared of the Grimm, but this Grimm is a cop so he does not hurt them .They all turn into some kind of Animal, it could be from anywhere from a mouse to a wolf or a snake.  We have watch all five season a couple of times. The way they transform into there animal side is Awesome! I would highly recommend this to anyone that love's action, suspense,drama, love stories.

4619448,5,B0058YPKIA,"I absolutely love this show! It's a clever take on the Grimm fairytales. Great writing! Growing up with the fairytale books, I have fun finding the nuggets thrown out from the stories and the twists of plots like having the pigs win over the wolves, troll bridges, and the vegetarian Blubod's- wolves. The actors couldn't be a better choice for the characters.
 I wish it weren't such graphic violence. I think they could get the point across without so much of it. It definitely has a ""yuck"" factor.
 The scenes, settings (old world warm, rich colors) and photography are high quality and satisfying. I am looking forward to more seasons!",1446076800,,639,4.8

4619525,5,B0058YPKIA,"I was hooked from the pilot. Keeps you in suspense and leaves so many options for things to happen. A few times I guessed the outcome, and others I was surprised.

4619526,2,B0058YPKIA,"With such a premise to work from, this series could be so much more than it is but unfortunately it lacks in delivery of thoughtful content.

4619527,5,B0058YPKIA,"I started rewatching this series from the beginning because I missed a lot the first time it was aired and eneded up losing interest. I'm glad I did this, this series rocks! I love the way the writers combine legends, fairy tales, historical events and fantasy and roll it together to come up with some wild stuff. Each episode is action filled with new creatures, fight scenes and more insight toward a storyline that is building into something big. The characters are very well rounded but it is a little hard to tell who to trust and what side they are really fighting on. I could do without the girlfriend drama, but I guess you need someone for the enemy to use against the main character. I think season two is gonna really be awesome as Nick's fighting skills are getting better and his allies are growing. Can't wait!",1445644800,,825,4.543624161073826
4619528,4,B0058YPKIA,"Good, entertaining show. It's like a mix between Luther and Once Upon a Time.
Disappointingly, there were a few flashes of women in their underwear that was completely unnecessary to the plot. The show is entertaining enough on its own, they did not have to go for the cheap ratings boost.",1445644800,,289,4.686274509803922
4619529,4,B0058YPKIA,"Remember that 'X-Files' had its 'monster-of-the-week' episodes? So far, after watching 13 episodes, I can say that 'Grimm' is all monster episodes :). Pretty good acting and stories; they're all pretty independent episodes, but I guess still laying the ground work for future seasons.

4619595,3,B0058YPKIA,"It's more than a little on the Liberal side of law enforcement theory, with the main character trying to reach an ""understanding"" with the bad guys in many episodes.  In one episode, it nearly costs the mother of one family her life because of this method, well, that plus the aggressiveness of her boys.  I'm not really into the ""there's the bad guy!  Kill him!"" type police theory either, but this thing with treating all the bad guys as simply misunderstood is annoying.  There ARE people who are completely downright evil in this world, and trying to sugarcoat it just deceives people into thinking there's hope for everyone.  You can't ""save"" everyone.

I'm not that far into it yet, but I'm giving it a chance.  I'm thinking I may not get to the second season at this point, but I haven't decided yet.",1445558400,,807,4.601398601398602

WOW! I was blown away! Grimm is fantastic! I am glad to say that it has sucked me into its awesomeness and I am now a passionate Grimmster! Every episode is a thriller. Some made me laugh, a couple made me cry, and some had me hiding behind my pillow. All of them made me scream at the TV at one time or another.

As a German it pains me greatly to see how they butcher the language, using incorrect terms and just plain silly names for things - you are calling a person a ""fox den"" and a ""blood bath?"" Really? The mistakes are not small ones either. Not sure if this is intentional, but I almost hope so, because if not you may need to hire a new German language person for your show.

I'm sure one them must have had to eat six toads a day to keep up his, err, activities.  I'm spotting Bauerschwein and Eisbiber everywhere now, too.

4619842,4,B0058YPKIA,"I'm almost done with season 1, so take what I say as incomplete. But I did not much care for the show at first. It's growing on me, mainly because of the relationship that Burkhardt has with his two partners, the human and the Blutbad. I like his cop partner because he is so average (but decent and smart enough)  and I like his Blutbad (the reformed ""big bad wolf"") friend Monroe for similar reasons--he's pretty average, except for being a demon type. This show is a police procedural with a fantasy mythology. It does have a lot of holes. For example: why didn't Nick's aunt tell him sooner about Grimms? Why didn't anyone make sure that he learned at least some German so he isn't utterly dependent on Monroe? Why isn't there better security on the Aunt's trailer that contains everything Grimms need to survive? Those are not idle questions! Also, I'd think that Hank and Juliette would be asking some hard questions as we approach the end of season one. At first I didn't find Nick terribly compelling; however, like Anna Torv in Fringe, the actor is starting to feel right in the role to me.  This is more like 3 1/2 stars with a possibility of going up; we'll see.",1444435200,4,1173,4.502347417840376
4619843,1,B0058YPKIA,"As one half of the globally recognized film guru crew of Mike & Ike I hereby dub this a big waste of time. There's no arc plot, poor story structure, unexplored possibilities, and worst of all, there is only one interesting character. For the man playing the role of Monroe, my sympathies are bestowed to him. He does a fantastic job while the rest of the cast try desperately to match his charisma. Cliche after cliche bombard the viewer into a coma of reintroduced concepts and interpretations. Save your strength and watch Sleepy Hollow.",1444435200,,540,4.75531914893617

It feels like a knock-off of the X-Files... so far, hopefully it pick up after season one. The effects are very good, story is interesting but I'll say I have found my attention drifting from time to time; just gets a little repetitious and I mean ""one shot episodes-Nick B & Hank G. get called in to the line of duty for an investigation-different monster/being every time-either both detectives solve the case or just Nick alone."" As for acting, its more of how the actors hit their mark and present themselves as the character, nothing bad just could be better.

4620010,1,B0058YPKIA,"I think everyone has seen the cop drama formula alive and well on every network channel. Well, ""Grimm"" attempts to give the supernatural fans what they crave while giving the cop drama crowd what they crave: repetition. Yay.

The SAME supervisors, detectives, etc ALL seem to show-up at the supernatural crime scenes. Really, dude? Also, how is it that suddenly dozens  of whacked-out crimes burst forth in one city? Anyway, it seems no one is any the wiser as to this sudden trend (lulz) and it always happens that the one guy who is able to investigate these crimes is always the one called to the scene... in a police department in a city the size of Portland?

The characters are about as wooden as I had feared. And yes, I feared this because when a significant other demands you watch a show them, it gets increasingly difficult when a tv show rinses and repeats EVERY week. It would have been tolerable, but the people who cast this show went to the bargain basement.",1443571200,,974,4.586206896551724

I have become a huge fan of 'binge watching' shows now that I can see them without commercial interruption and now that I can see 'what happened next?' without waiting a week. Convincing performances, nicely done character development, and escapist fantasy - I really treasure that after MY week - and all in a formula that is easily accessed. Count me in!!!",1443571200,,488,4.686046511627907

4620070,3,B0058YPKIA,"I really enjoy this show, but it's not without its flaws, making it an enjoyable background show but not something I'm rushing to get through. The acting is pretty so-so, especially on the part of the actor who plays the main character Nick Burkhardt--I find myself frequently puzzled and unsure what emotion he's trying to convey, and his banter is boring, his delivery flat. I don't find his girlfriend Juliette any more interesting, though I think it's more the writing than the acting. Luckily, Monroe really saves the day. An episode that doesn't have my favorite cello-playing, wine-drinking, vegan Blutbad is a terrible one indeed. Hank and Wu also provide a few bright moments of playful banter, especially Wu, in scenes revolving around the police station. Sasha Roiz is great as their captain. While this show doesn't quite have the charm of Supernatural, it has its campy feel. I'm still waiting for them to get to more of the Grimm lore, so perhaps the show will improve then, but so far I'd say it's an average show good for putting on while playing iPhone games or cooking.",1443139200,3,1087,4.818181818181818
8462481,1,B0058YPKIA,"The idea is great, but the actors they chose are terrible... Juliette is terrible and doesn't get better... The grimm guy too as well as all of the others....

I'm surprised it went on for as long as it did with these actors - I honestly could've seen this going a LOT further if there weren't amateurs portraying the characters... Honestly, when I watched the first few episodes a long time ago I thought 'this is a train-wreck'... A great idea, but the actors are atrocious.... Whoever decided to hire them made a fatal flaw... The only reason the show went so long is because of the popularity of Grimm, but it could've gone on a lot longer and actually been enjoyable to watch had there been real actors involved in the production.

Honestly, it felt like watching one of those spoof shows which gets random people to try to act in a mock-movie and at the end tell them it was a joke and play the bad acting back to them...... train-wreck.",1529280000,,943,4.445086705202312

How do they hear the song being played on the Ipod without putting in the earphone? Do they have superhearing??? And why does it only have one song???? Is it on a loop? Most people don't just listen to one song on their Ipod. By the time the Cops even got there it should've either drained their battery or at least be on a different track. And why does the cop shoot the guy in the back at the end and everybody's ok with that?? He can't even see that he's a monster thing like the other guy.
