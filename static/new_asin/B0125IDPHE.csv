7342715,3,B0125IDPHE,I love any Fairy Tail package with Erza on the front although as a whole I didn't like these episodes as much as those on Volume 16.  In the end it is more good fortune than effort that allows Fairy Tail and the other wizard guilds to triumph over enemies that are essentially invincible.  The reversible cover of Volume 16 had a modified cosplay version of Natsu and I figure that a cosplay Erza is on the inside of this one.  Looking forward to it.,1444521600,,450,4.270588235294118

7342721,5,B0125IDPHE,"These seasons have really made a fan of me. Slow starter at Season 1, some of other shows in early seasons were good but had tedious parts...I know, I just get impatient and love great suspense not too much predictability. That said this show is anything BUT as you keep watching. By season #3, was totally hooked, no daytime SOAP can compare! Kids and adults can get a hoot from relaxing to watch these fictional, fun wizards!",1459382400,2,427,4.558441558441558

7342734,4,B0125IDPHE,"I liked it, but didn't love all of it. Better than what I remember than when it first came out. I think they did some post production work to the series. But the very last episode on this disc is just plain awful from the art being inconsistent to the bad story telling. Other than the last episode I enjoyed it. some of the dragons though seemed a bit off drawing wise as well, but can't complain too much as the series was enjoyable.",1445212800,,435,4.190476190476191
