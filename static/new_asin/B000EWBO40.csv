8114980,5,B000EWBO40,"Not many folks know whats poppin in the Bay.  If you've never been to a sideshow, this DVD is a must.  Great camerawork brings ya upfront to the action.  Only a few beatings, but the music, cars, & crowds demostrate what this hyphy movement is about.",1148947200,2,250,4.391304347826087
8114981,1,B000EWBO40,"Don't waste your time with this DVD.

The ""hyphy"" movement is not ""exposed"" here. It's just an hour and a half of cars doing donuts in the street. And that is it. Almost nothing else.

There is very little dancing, no good music, no girls getting funky, ZERO fights, ZERO car crashes, and almost no entertaining ""hyphy"" action.

The DVD case says ""Fights"" and ""Car Crashes"" and there are NONE. Zero.

Someone should open a class action lawsuit against Figure 8 Productions because this is blatant false advertising.

This is just a repackaged ""sideshow"" DVD. Cars, cars, and more cars. This video is beyond boring.",1148256000,2,614,4.809523809523809
