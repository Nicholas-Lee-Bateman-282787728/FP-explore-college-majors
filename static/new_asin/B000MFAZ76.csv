8168317,5,B000MFAZ76,"Most of my life I was never a big fan of Shakespeare because I'm a southern hick and I talk in a southern accent and in hillbilly talk and I was always very turned-off by snobby stuck-up people who insist on speaking in proper English, using sophisticated terms and speaking in a formal manner--I never liked that in real life and therefore I was not very attracted to the Shakespeare things I saw, because the characters always sound like they're talking in a pompous excessively ultra-proper ultra-sophisticated language and it seemed to be obviously some ancient form of English and the way Shakespeare characters talk is just not the kind of English language that I grew up with and understand. I was always very turned off by the elaborate excessive dramatic ways that the Shakespeare characters say things--they can't even say a simple sentence without a bunch of elaborate flowery language, making themselves sound all sophisticated. So that was my past with Shakespeare. But recently some acquaintances of mine had me watch Mel Gibson's Hamlet movie and though I still did not care for the language, I found the Hamlet story fascinating because of how much the Hamlet character reminded me of myself, how I've felt at so many times in my life. I had a personal connection with Hamlet that most viewers probably don't have because I too, like Hamlet, have been in situations where a bunch of evildoers were plotting against me and others and I was the only one who knew the truth of the situation and noone believed me and everyone was carrying on about how crazy I was. In my life, it seemed like displaying any form of distress or emotional pain would get people to say I was crazy. So I was so fascinate by how much Hamlet had in common with my own life and this was the first time I'd ever actually watched any Shakespeare story all the way through. I have since seen Mel's Hamlet movie several times and when I learned about this video where he talks to kids about Hamlet, I wanted it immediately because I felt like I too needed whatever education he gave the school kids about it. Almost the very first thing Mel says is explaining that the language is the problem that keeps people like me from liking Shakespeare--he asks the kids what the problem or barrier was and they say ""The language"" and he says ""The language! I could have told you that."" and then he explains something about that it's not really as complicated as it sounds, he translates some of the Shakespeare lines into modern language and he explains that the Shakespeare characters are just using more words and trying to give sentences more dramatic impact and he explains what some of the sophisticated terms mean and then he has the kids take turns doing scenes from the movie in modern language. It seemed like he basically said that you don't have to focus on the language if the language bothers you, when you watch the movie you can just think of the scenes as the way you would say it yourself, that the meaning of what's being said is more important than HOW the characters are saying it. It seemed like by having the kids do scenes in their own language he was trying to demonstrate to me that when I watch the movie I can translate the dialogue to how I would say things myself and I can think of the scenes as how I would say the things and I don't have to focus on Shakespeare's way of speaking. He explains a bunch of other stuff about the complexities of the relationships that go on in the movie and the meaning behind a lot of scenes and after the video was over I said, ""I understand it all much better now, now that you explained it."" So basically, this video is one of the best things that ever happened to me and I will forever be grateful to this man Mel Gibson for teaching me to understand Shakespeare. Even when I watch other Hamlet movies besides his and other Shakespeare movies, I will remember what he taught me here.",1330646400,4,3927,4.532394366197183
8168318,5,B000MFAZ76,"This is a very handy and useful guide for taking the first entry step into the daunting world of Shakespearean early modern English language and play. Though Hamlet is one of the more complex of the Shakespearean tragedies, Mel Gibson makes tackling the art of appreciating it very approachable, accessible and relatable. A real pity that this highly educational (and entertaining) tool is sadly out of print.",1319587200,2,409,5.119402985074627
8168319,5,B000MFAZ76,"This video by one of the most outstanding young actors of our time is a must for anyone teaching the classic play ""Hamlet'. The interactive method Mr. Gibson utilizes to engage a young audience really brings to life an old classic Shakepearean play. A great classroom video.",1302480000,,274,4.851063829787234
