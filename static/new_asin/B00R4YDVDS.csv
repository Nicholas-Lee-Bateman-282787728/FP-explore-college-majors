8694139,2,B00R4YDVDS,"Very grainy black and white video footage of random scenes in a Chinese town: some hogs get loose, crazy man wandering in traffic, another man threatening to jump from bridge, broken fire hydrant, man seining in a polluted stream, etc. Quality of the video is poor and with no context provided, half the time I couldn't tell what was being filmed. Quite boring to watch-skip this film.",1518048000,,385,4.7611940298507465
8694140,1,B00R4YDVDS,This isn't the movie also called Disorder reviewed on Rotten Tomatoes with Diane Kruger. If you click on the Amazon link on the RT site it takes you to this movie which is a different one. Anyway I didn't warch the Amazon Disorder and had to request a refund.,1471737600,,259,4.3061224489795915
8694141,1,B00R4YDVDS,"This was a $3.99 ""Pay as You Watch"" purchase.  You sent me the wrong copy, a Korean one??  You should have sent me the French version.  Totally frustrating & a waste of my hard-earned money . . . aab",1471132800,,199,4.051282051282051
8694142,5,B00R4YDVDS,Read the books and articles about deadly Chinese products and DEATH BY CHINA and similar.  This hashed-together movie shows in horrifying detail some examples of how the poor Chinese live on their streets.  No wonder that the Chinese government has to ban so much truth.,1428105600,2,270,4.977777777777778
