Not because of the mad violence/nudity and other stuff.  I just didn't feel like i was gonna stay interested in the series long enough.  But after having watched the 3rd volume last night.  I can say this is one anime series that i am totally down with for the long haul.  Like others have said before Gantz is a series that you shouldnt sleep on.

It has a slow start to it, because you have to start somewhere obviously.  But the things that the characters deal with from trying to get laid, avoiding bullies wanting high amounts of money and a ""friend"" turning on you.  To save his own *** not to forgot about that mysterious orb called Gantz.  There are soo many things going on with this series already.  It's gonna be a wild and crazy ride.  I've been glad to partake in this Gantz ride so far.  I'm looking forward to all the volumes that are ahead.  I only wish they'd release more episodes in each volume.  But other than that i have no complaints with this series.

I just hope that others will check out this anime series that has it what it takes to stand out from the pack.  Check it out....GANTZZZ!!",1117584000,4,1248,4.283261802575107

There's actually very little gore on this disc, as the focus shifts more towards learning more about our main characters' lives, and how they're going to develop now after their rather traumatic experiences.  (It should be noted that while this volume lacks the blood and violence of Volume 2, the period from the end of episode 5 and especially through episode 6 has significantly more nudity than previous episodes).

Still, we continue to get into Kurono's head, which is always an interesting and darkly amusing place, are privy to some of Kato's less-than-ideal home life, some new characters are introduced (whose involvement in the rest of the series is as-yet unclear), and there are some distinctly unexpected developments with a certain well-endowed female in the cast (including, finally, her name), who quickly becomes a fascinating character in her own right, and not just the eye candy she has been in the last two volumes.

If you've enjoyed the first two, this volume won't change that fact.  If you didn't enjoy them, this volume won't change that either.  If you haven't seen them...what the heck are you reading this for, anyway?",1112918400,6,1359,5.017777777777778
