1865659,3,B00008WT3R,"The year is 1947, the place an Irish Catholic neighborhood in Brooklyn, New York. Michael (Peter Tambakis) finds himself caught in a freak snowstorm one August afternoon and steps into a nearby doorway to warm up. Once inside he encounters a bearded man named Judah (Stephen Rea), a lonely, disillusioned rabbi recently arrived from Czechoslovakia.

They become friends and before long Judah is sharing his Jewish faith with the young boy along with wonderous tales of kabbalistic folklore and mysticism. However Michael soon discovers that some people in the neighborhood don't approve of his new acquaintance, or others of the Jewish faith for that matter. For the first time in his short life Michael is exposed to anti-semitic behavior by a group of local teenagers. When the rabbi is badly beaten by one of the bullies Michael looks for a way to stop the violence.

He asks the rabbi if the stories he has been telling him are true, or at least one in particular. A medieval tale about a Golem, an artifical creation made of clay fashioned in human form. A creature of immense strength that according to legend could be brought to life through a prescribed set of Hebrew prayers and rituals. It would be a 'Warrior of God' that could stand against the neighborhood bullies. He asks Judah if it's possible. Responding with a hesitant maybe, Michael is off to attempt the unimaginable.

""Snow in August"" was made on a small budget for television and it shows in the production values. However if you stay with it you'll discover that the story is really quite good and its message of tolerance and understanding is one we should never get tired of hearing.",1125014400,19,1659,4.814035087719298
1865660,5,B00008WT3R,"I really enjoyed this movie. It blended the spiritual with the right amount of drama, manifesting how good can triumph over evil, and with love prevailing in the end. The acting and story plot were outstanding.",1347062400,,210,4.861111111111111

1865662,5,B00008WT3R,"It has a bit of about everything. Christianity meets our Cousin Judaism in this movie. A young Catholic kid befriends a sweet Jewish Rabbi, after he witnesses an Irish hoodlum/gang member beat an old Jewish storekeeper near to death. The kid makes the wrong decision and decides not to be a ""stooley"" and he and his Irish mother, and his dear friend, the Rabbi pay the price. If you don't know what a ""Golem"" is (or Kabbala is) then you will in this movie.  The Catholic kid creates a Golem after the Rabbi tell him how - by speaking the true name of God and using a magical spoon - over a earthen/clay, rather large figure. A Golem knows how to protect and stop attacks on Jews. It instinctively and/or is programed to know. Just as Michael the Archangel protects Israel.

This movie shows how to make the wrong decision by protecting bullies. And worse - the error of continuing to protect them, when they know you can put them away for the crimes they commit. You are then in their eyes a serious threat. And your life - and the lives of your family are then in serious danger. A childlike FAITH is what makes it all happen. /s/ Steve @ BibleProbe.com",1307059200,,1154,4.413145539906103
1865663,2,B00008WT3R,"Snow In August is a marvelous novel from the New York based writer, Pete Hamill. In the book he explores the mysticism of the Eastern European Jews and how it was brought here to the U.S. by Holocaust survivors , and, more importantly, how it affects a young Irish American boy in Brooklyn, New York.
This film is an accurate telling of the book, but not nearly as good.( which movie is ever as good as the book ?) It lacks the depth and emotion, although the actors do a good job with the material they have. The final explosive scene is dissapointing because it lacks the imagination the reader has to come up with in order to reslove this scene.
The central theme of the story is the relationship between this boy, a rabbi, and his blue collar life. The conflict is, of course, is which of these two worlds is more important. The knowledge of a saged rabbi, or the hustle street life of his thug neighbors and friends. Or, which is more important to the rabbi, his learned life, or his involvement with the boy and his surroundings ? It is a coming of age film, but who is it ? The boy or the rabbi ?
I would say, if this story interests you, and you have alot of time,read the book. If the story interests you, and you're not a reader, you may enjoy this film",1270598400,,1263,4.244813278008299
1865664,1,B00008WT3R,Movie started off as a very good movie but the end was quite ridiculous.  Bringing in the Kabbala fantasy made this movie not worth watching.  Who makes movies like this. I would not want my kids to watch this movie.,1266364800,2,216,4.375
1865665,5,B00008WT3R,"I teach a high-functioning, multiply-handicapped inclusion class.  We were working on the theme of bullying and I showed several movies with examples of this theme.  ""Snow in August"" has wonderful examples of bullying and possible consequences.  Both students and staff were captivated, fully involved -- booing the ""bad guys"" and cheering the ""good guys.""  I highly recommend this movie for its characters, its story, its history, and, of course, its lessons.",1211587200,6,460,5.436619718309859
1865666,5,B00008WT3R,"This movie teaches a lot about how hateful prejudice and stereotypes can be (in this case, antisemitism). It is a movie about how a little boy learns that what he thought was so was completely wrong. It shows how a friendship can blossom between two people of diverse cultures who are also very far apart in age...and how they can learn from each other to the mutual benefit of not only both of them, but for an entire neighborhood. Furthermore, it is as close to the original book as I have ever seen. This is a thoroughly enjoyable movie (AND book!).",1182902400,8,552,4.475247524752476
1865667,4,B00008WT3R,"After reading the book this film is quite relevant.  Of course in a movie things have to be compressed.  It was an excellant movie for a low budget movie.  If you lived in the 40's and 50's it took you right back.  If you live today you are aware that things just don't change much.  If you are poor there is no way the police can help or protect you.  The only escape is through knowledge, fantasy, belief, and cunning.

See the movie then read the book!",1179100800,3,455,4.160919540229885

1865669,3,B00008WT3R,"An 11 year old boy witness a older Jewish store owner getting beat up badly by a hoodlum. He refuses to snitch but the hoodlum thinks he may have (or will). The boy, Micheal, is an intelligent Irish Catholic who wants to do the right thing but isn't sure what it is. His loyalty to street rules clouds his judgment but he grows up that summer, partly due to his new friendship with a rabbi.

It's a low budget movie but it's a very good one. Great acting and a good script. I cried toward the end. It's the kind of movie you want your kids to watch and I think they would actually enjoy it.",1154736000,3,590,4.086206896551724

7987656,3,B00008WT3R,"I'm guessing and hoping the book is far better than the movie, since the movie did not bring everything together very well.  It was like two very different stories were combined in hopes of a successful union that explored prejudice and brutality; but, instead, the viewer was left pondering what went wrong.  Michael, his friends, the street gang and the police are stereotypical characters, accents and all,  right out of an old movie. Michael's Irish mother is lost in her own little idealistic world, ignoring the fact that the street gang leader is a vicious criminal, and bizarrely keeps praising her son for not being a snitch and helping the police.

The rabbi is the most interesting character, but isn't it strange he is always alone and never around any other Jews?  Yes, there are apparently few Jews in the neighborhood, but what is he doing living in such a neighborhood in the first place? Is he actually real or is he  totally a  fantasy character?  Considering the end, it may be the latter. Yet, there was nothing really awe-inspiring about the end.  It simply seemed strange and sentimental.  Maybe I'll read the book,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Snow-in-August-A-Novel/dp/0316242829/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Snow in August: A Novel</a>, and see if the author did a better job than the makers of this movie.",1436140800,,1375,5.324074074074074

We aren't born with either, both are taught to others through our own actions.",1361664000,,328,4.140625
