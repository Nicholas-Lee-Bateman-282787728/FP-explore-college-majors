8516105,4,B007FY0U9A,"This is a well done stroll through time with one of our former first ladies.  Since she was such a private person in the midst of tragic history, this memoir with her voice, from her perspective is informative and enchanting.  Well worth the purchase - watched it with one of my daughters",1341878400,6,288,4.519230769230769
