2400477,1,B000B5XPS8,"I have to start by saying the Kidnapped is one of my favorite books.  I've read it many, many times so I know that no movie version can do it full justice.  Actually, the best version I'd ever seen was the Disney version with Peter Finch, so I was very interested to see if this one would be more faithful to the book.  I was extremely disappointed: while David's character is ok (albeit a bit boring), Alan is completely and utterly changed beyond all recognition.  Not only does he look and act like someone out of a Dumas novel, but near the end he is actually portrayed as a *coward*!  If there is anything in the world that Alan Breck Stewart is NOT, that would be a coward!  Arg, I was yelling at the TV, it was that bad.  So if you're a fan of the book, do yourself and everyone around you a favor and give this one a miss.",1212624000,7,830,4.118012422360248

The first adult novel I read was ""Kidnapped,"" when I received it for my 9th birthday. I had a tough time with many of the words, but no one would help me; they would always say: ""Look it up. That's how you learn.""

Well, I did learn to love Stevenson's work and similar adventure tales; but, the reason I gave this adapted version of Stevenson's work four stars is the acting. I withhold one star for the deep changes to the original story that have already discussed here by other reviewers.

The entire cast did an excellent job, but the work of Iain Glen, and especially of James Anthony Pearson, is something to write home about.

Pearson's facial expressions alone are worth the price of admission, or, more accurately, the price of the DVD.

Take a look at the brief flash of realization on this young actors face, when he tells the weaver that he thought she was a witch, and then he realizes that it was the wrong thing to say.

Better still, watch Pearson/Davie's face in the background as Alan Breck and James-of-the-Glen have a heated discussion, which ends when James's daughter asks Pearson/Davie if he likes smelling like a goat.

This young Pearson, has that special acting talent which allows him to manipulate his face so that it speaks volumes, without a word being said. One is reminded of the remarkable eyebrows of Jack Nicholson and Christian Slater, among other great actors.",1168473600,7,1401,4.670731707317073
2400479,5,B000B5XPS8,"Okay, okay.  I admit it.  I have never read Kidnapped.  Thats probably why I enjoyed this so much.  I thought the cast was fantastic, the locations were great, and the direction wasn't half bad.  I did read the reviews and they are probably right, but since I didn't read Steven's book I wasn't bothered by anything left out or messed up(Obviously).  So in conclusion if you want a good fun film from PBS buy this.  IF you are a fan of the book you should probably burn this thing(Judging on the other reviews), or, like me, you could enjoy a good old adventure tale....",1163030400,12,570,4.423076923076923
2400480,2,B000B5XPS8,"Our local library purchased this item at my behest. I was naively hoping for something more authentic thinking the BBC would hold closer to the historical essence of this tale: both with regards to the Highland Clearances and toward Stevenson's rendition. Of course literary efforts focusing on the Scottish Romantic period surrounding the forty-five are usually just that, romanticized. Nevertheless, I found this screen play to be a subtle rewriting, attempting to place the British `system' of the time in a mendaciously better light.

Prominent British author G.A. Henty perhaps the premier exemplar in British Historical Fiction of the merit of valor and the triumph of the individual over the system, himself acknowledges the criminal excesses condoned by the House of Hanover by ""Butcher Cumberland"" the Duke of Cumberland. If William's excesses had limited themselves to revenge at Culloden Moor perhaps it could be forgotten, but the continuing blood run foisted upon the Highlands, only in part to suppress the rebellion, is central to the tale of Stevenson's visitation of the events following 1745.

It is one thing to take artistic license to show a broader more objectively modern understanding of a historical vision, quite another to produce a children's program continuing to proscribe the nature of a people's heart and soul.

But if it is one thing that the Scottish peoples bear witness to, it isn't a system that beats in the heart of men, directing them and guiding their destiny. Rather, it is the same individual, in triumph or defeat, maintaining valor and honor despite calls to the contrary.

This attempted retelling is a bastardization of the message Stevenson was trying to convey.  Stevenson, named Balfour (and this a Sept of Clan MacGregor) hinted at a truth that even the culture of his time was unwilling to embrace, hidden until such a time as this. It is MacGregor Rising ; the story will be told.

One example of this divided perception of history, which continues to this day, is the name given to the lowly weed, Tansy Ragwort. This immigrant flower which here in Oregon is noted by the domestic animals it kills each year, and the target of a taciturn effort to stop its spread is named ""Sweet William,"" after the Duke of Cumberland in England, but in Scotland is still known as stinking Willie or sour Billy.

I was further surprised by the BBC ignoring the recently revealed answer to the long asked question of who killed the Red Fox. This secret long held by Clan Stewart, and only now revealed should be reflected in any current retelling. Even a simple Google search would illuminate what was so glaringly ignored in the screen play.

This modern British romantic revisionism, not even filmed in Scotland, directs my attention elsewhere.  Perhaps it was Francis Ford Coppola's 1995 television version whch provoked the BBC reactionary attempt. Coppala is my next view....

...After further reflection I feel that some in Britain have a deep confusion over their own history. Perhaps this is a result of shame. One example of this is the current Prince of Wales claiming Stewart lineage, showing at best that he is a little confused on the concept.",1152921600,9,3194,4.998116760828625
2400481,1,B000B5XPS8,"I understand the urge to tweak things in an a adaptation but I have to say that they seem to have set out to change things gratuitously in this version and to mind it spoils it. It's no longer Robert Louis Stevenson! As other reviewers point out they change many many plot details, even the casting spoils some things (Davie is supposed to be a foot taller than Alan Breck Stewart). The tension between the lowland Whig Davie (the head) and the Highland Alan (the heart) isn't apparent and ultimately in this ""adaptation"" of a ""coming of age"" book by RLS, Davie doesn't grow up in any sense.",1137024000,11,591,4.481481481481482
2400482,1,B000B5XPS8,"If you like Robert Louis Stevenson's book, for the love of God, don't see this movie.  PBS chopped this exciting novel into unrecognizable bits of haggis.  I can just imagine the writers' conversations now.  ""Hey, we have this book that has been in constant publication for 150 years.  Stevenson obviously didn't know how to please an audience.  Let's use our collective wisdom gained from our other great classic adaptations such as ""Mary Had a Little Clam"" and the dieting infomercial ""How Humpty Lost his Dumpty"" to pull together something that might give PBS a tiny spike in the ratings so it can compete with a Law and Order re-run.""

2400483,1,B000B5XPS8,"Liberties taken with the book ruin the PBS version. Adaptations are so profuse that the title should have been changed also, perhaps to ""Kidnapped: Masculine Sensitivity in the Highlands."" The second half in particular suffers from unnecessary alterations to the plot, the characters, and the denouement. This version is not faithful to the book or to the historical record (James of the Glen was not rescued, but was hanged). And it's not nearly as enjoyable as the book.",1131840000,18,472,5.064102564102564
2400514,1,B000B5XPS8,"I knew it wouldn't be like the book, but they changed the story completely. The acting was horrible. There wasn't a good actor / actress in the whole thing. The only thing that was good about it was the scenery, and that wasn't that great.",1355443200,,239,4.333333333333333
2400515,5,B000B5XPS8,We loved watching this movie! It is a great adaptation of Steven's story Kidnapped.  The acting is fabulous!  I loved the accents and the beautiful places it was filmed in Scotland.  It was exciting and had some sweetness to it too - yes a happy ending.  I am surprised that this has not become one of the most popular movies and considered a classic.  Maybe it is just too good for that...,1319846400,,390,4.361111111111111
2400516,2,B000B5XPS8,"I found this movie tedious, and none of the characters particularly sympathetic. The young protagonist came across as whiny - more like a spoiled child than any kind of hero, and Alan Breck seemed just reckless. Don't waste your time or money.",1294790400,,243,4.809523809523809
2400517,5,B000B5XPS8,"Now, as some other reviewers have said, I have not read R L Stevenson's original work, but taken aside from the book, this is a great adventure movie!

  The acting is great, from James Pearson, who plays Davie, on down to Ransome the unfortunate cabin boy (Jake Lindesay) and the old ""Weaver Woman"" (Ginette McDonald).

  I've read various opinions as to whether or not it was actually filmed in Scotland, and can't say myself, but the scenery was beautiful, regardless.  The sets, also, are well done.

  We go through quite a few well-done suspenseful moments in the plot, and the camera work is masterful throughout- working very well with the acting and other components to add to the mood.  I particularly noticed very good and carefully angled close ups at tense moments, and a couple unusual but effective view points.

  Also, no bad language or adult scenes, which is a big [RARE] plus.

~ The only negative points I have:
 3-4 times I noticed a strong change in the lighting from one shot to another in the same scene.  This was rather distracting.

  And more negatively, the ending seemed a little too happily-ever-after sweet.  Everything worked out.  Not too realistic.  But I admit, I liked it that way! _ This is one adventure movie my family plans to see again.",1280016000,,1279,4.713636363636364
2400518,5,B000B5XPS8,"Don't be fooled by the lack of big stars in this production! This is a superbly played piece, shot on location in Scotland. The team have brilliantly struck  a fine balance  in respect of the original book, in the sense of remaining faithful to the spirit of the masterpiece without slavishly adhering to the literary manuscript. The result is fast-paced but also convincing.
  The characters are multi-faceted and there are plenty of opportunities for the viewer to become absorbed in the plot around the people - not just the action. As a result, the final scene is one of the most moving and telling that I can remember in any drama - period!(and I watch a lot of opera, by the way!)
  From the cast we must mention Iain Glen, who delivers an admirable Alan Breck (head and shoulders over Michael Caine, and more visceral than David McCallum). Gregor Fisher as James of the Glens delivers his best serious performance beside his role in The Merchant of Venice (with Al Pacino as Shylock).
  A real chunk of classic Scots culture. Repeated absorption will improve the mind and provide balm for the soul - honest!",1279584000,3,1114,4.706185567010309
2400519,5,B000B5XPS8,"I have not read the book ""Kidnapped"" so I don't know if this movie keeps to the story line. But even if it doesn't this is a great adventure movie. It keeps your interest, it's decent, no bad language, no nudity, or sexual content (that's one in a million).
The actors all do a great job in the roles they play. Especially Iain Glenn, who plays the proud scottsman who loves his blue coat, who also played Mr. Preston in ""Wives and Daughters.""",1275350400,3,443,4.349397590361446

2400522,4,B000B5XPS8,"Though (like most book-to-movie adaptations) this movie takes some liberties with Stevenson's work, it at least hints at what all the fighting is about up there in the Highlands.  In our politically correct times, I doubt that the screenwriters wanted to get into the whole Catholic v. Protestant issue that underlies the book, but at least you know that Davie's clan (Protestants) and Allan's clan (Catholic) are at each other's throats.  The idea Stevenson was working with is that sometimes two persons from different backgrounds are thrown together by circumstances in which they must cooperate to bring about their mutual survival. In the struggle, they find in each other a basic human decency that transcends the political struggle around them. Despite the fact that the movie doesn't always follow the book, that basic idea still comes shining through.",1237248000,,860,5.22463768115942

I found it to be stiff, dark and with the Scottish accents very hard to follow...I'm usually quite good at accents. The persona of the heroic Alan came across as a mixed up character, somewhere between Errol Flynn and Douglas Fairbanks and so stupid that the viewer only wants to give him a good kick!

8081798,1,B000B5XPS8,"I'm watching all the filmed versions of KIDNAPPED I can find, and so far this is the worst. As others have pointed out, it changes the plot -- not to make it shorter, they even make up scenes that add nothing. Even when they do follow Stevenson's story, they change the dialog. Why the script-writers thought they could write better than Robert Louis Stevenson, I don't know, but they can't.

If you want to see a KIDNAPPED that's true to the book and even keeps much of the dialog, I'd watch the 1960 Disney version -- even though the young man who plays David Balfour here is, I think, a better actor. It's too bad that he had such a poor script!",1439510400,3,648,4.311475409836065
