5392332,5,B00A7GWHAS,"My favorite ""reality tv"" series of all time, hands down. I've bought both the Amazon online streaming version and this DVD set, and watch the episodes regularly while I'm doing things around the house.

I'm sure this show doesn't accurately reflect traditional ""gypsies"" at all, more like a blingier sub-set of the Irish travellers, but they are a riot to watch and I love their accents and crazy outfits. It's a little disturbing to see how young the girls get married, although they do mostly seem to be old beyond their years in terms of understanding household responsibility. There are glimmers of hope for the culture as a very few girls are seen to be continuing their education and learning a skill other than cleaning and child-raising...although some of the girls seem totally happy to be staying at home with their husbands and kids, and I say good for them if they are content! There's a lot to be said for the art of home-making and the traveller women certainly know how to keep a house (or trailer).

The producer chose to bias the 'documentary' style in the travellers' favor for the most part, so you get repeatedly told that there's a lot of prejudice against 'gypsies', but the behavior of particularly the men demonstrates that non-travellers might have a good reason to give them the side-eye. Violence, disregard for law, macho attitudes and the patronizing way they view women makes traveller men easy to dislike in this series, with a few exceptions: Paddy, for all his tough-guy bravado, is really sweet to watch with his wife of many years, Roseanne. And young groom John McFadyen, despite being a little immature, has an obviously genuine love and empathy for his beautiful teenage bride Cheyenne as she goes through with a wedding shortly after losing her mother to cancer.

I really hated the US version of this (and I'm American!)...to me the American women were little better than white trash and over-acted every single situation. They were loud, coarse, foul-mouthed and stupid. The storylines felt very forced and ridiculous. But in the British show, it seems much more natural...you get the idea that the emotions are real.  The girls are generally well-mannered (although occasionally acting their very young age), don't swear, and respect their elders. While much of the show is about the superficial glitz and glamour favored by the young traveller girls and women, it does have a great deal of heart behind it, and that is what makes this show so compelling to watch.",1407283200,,2506,4.889411764705883
5392333,4,B00A7GWHAS,This is one of those shows that I can't help but like because it's such a departure from my own culture. I was completely fascinated by the Gypsies and Irish Travelers featured (even though I've read some scathing reviews of the people on other sites) and enjoyed the entire series.,1404777600,,282,4.66
5392334,5,B00A7GWHAS,Love that I get to watch these episodes whenever I want and over and over. Drives my fianc crazy but I love it!!!,1394323200,,113,3.9565217391304346
5392335,5,B00A7GWHAS,I love to watch this series. I wish that there would be more made as you get very involved with the daily lives of Gypsies/Travellers.,1393977600,,134,4.4
5392336,5,B00A7GWHAS,"This is the original Gypsy Wedding series that was filmed in the UK. Unlike the US version this series explores the traditions of ""Travelers"" in England, Wales, and Ireland. The episodes are fun, the dresses are huge, and the cakes are fantastic!! Watch this series first if possible, as it explores family dynamics, religious beliefs, very young brides, child rearing, misogynistic husbands, lack of schooling, outrageous attire, and social discrimination. A fascinating look at a private world!",1388102400,,496,5.454545454545454
5392337,4,B00A7GWHAS,"To be clear, I recommend this (set of) DVD(s). It is very interesting, but it is also quite awful. And I mean ""awful"" both in the traditional sense as well as in the sense of causing one to be full of awe.

Pretending to be a documentary that investigates the world of the English Gypsies and Irish Travelers, it is, in fact, only mildly restrained propaganda on behalf of these same groups. For those who are ignorant of the (English) Gypsy culture, the series is clearly intended to create sympathy for them. The hook is to show young girls parading around in dresses that cost thousands of pounds and weigh up to a couple hundred pounds. But there is so much more.

Gypsy courtship. Gypsy academics. Gypsy personal hygiene (apparently, they buy their ""caravans"", ie, trailers, without toilets but don't use them even if the trailers have them).

Men are, for various reasons, mostly ignored. Likewise ignored is from where all the money comes to buy the dresses and all the other silly things that go with a Bit Fat Gypsy Wedding. Of course, when one of the men, one who buys a new, fully equipped Audi every 6 months (!), states he's in the ""metal recycling"" business, you have to wonder...

Note that like most TV shows from the UK, there are no subtitles. Not in general, not for for hard-of-hearing, nor for foreign languages. There are a few English subtitles whenever one of the interviewees speaks a particularly incomprehensible dialect, but there are otherwise none. As a nonresident of the UK, I find this very irritating as many English dialects and even some accents are difficult to understand. There is simply no excuse for not providing this option.",1376179200,,1667,4.7379310344827585
5392338,5,B00A7GWHAS,"I first became aware of this series after seeing one of the later episodes on TV. It's an unstinting look at the symbolic ceremony of an ancient culture that's losing its integrity and relevance in this millennium. The fashion and lifestyle of the gypsies and travelers of the British Isles combines very conservative traditions with  lavish -- sometimes outlandish -- modern trappings. What is most striking is the youth and naivete of the brides,  most of whom are poorly educated and totally dependent on the men in their lives -- be they fathers, brothers or husbands. The fairy tale nature of their weddings is often followed by physically, financially and emotionally restricted lives. No wonder they want one very special day in one outstanding outfit and setting before embarking on their futures. This is a visually stunning series, but frightening in some of its implications. Contrast the freshness of these young brides with the worn faces of their mothers; that says it all.",1371168000,,987,5.049079754601227
5392339,5,B00A7GWHAS,"This show is definitely either loved or hated as most people don't care too much,as I have discovered, for Travellers. Personally I love this show. The culture is interesting and simply fascinates me. I believe this to be one of those shows where the individual viewer must decide ultimately for themself as to whether or not they love it or find it utter garbage. Like I mentioned before, I love it.
The girls are rather young when they marry which is a point brought up by people who dislike it but in our own modern day culture, girls are getting married and pregnant (sometimes just the latter) at 16 if not younger. At least these girls are raised with high morals of no sex before marriage whatsoever. That's perhaps the biggest thing I believe that would make the show inappropriate to some. Its refreshing though to get an insiders perspective into such a culture based on tradition.",1365984000,4,891,4.681528662420382
8547868,5,B00A7GWHAS,"I love this show, and for the price it was an excellent buy!",1523836800,,60,3.6923076923076925
8547869,5,B00A7GWHAS,Bought as a gift for my daughter.  We loved watching this show of TV.  The British version of this show was far better than the American version.,1516406400,,145,4.333333333333333
8547870,5,B00A7GWHAS,Very entertaining and worth getting. Shows how different people live. I love it because I live differently than most and it's something I can relate to.,1505865600,,152,4.884615384615385

8547875,4,B00A7GWHAS,"What can you say. It's like watching a train wreck. Can't pull your eyes away, but know you should.",1439078400,,99,4.2631578947368425
8547876,5,B00A7GWHAS,Is exactly what the description on the box says. It's about gypsies and travelers and gives you a look inside their lives and their heritage. I don't know if this is how all gypsies or travelers are but it is very entertaining and fun to watch. But if you have problems understand people of other nationalities then this might not be for you unless you put subtitles on.,1429401600,,370,4.455882352941177
