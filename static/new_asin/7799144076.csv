3030461,2,7799144076,"Let me preface this by saying I NEVER walk out on movies. Not only that I love kids movies, I love cartoons. I'm middle aged and half of what I watch is Disney, Nickelodeon, and Cartoon Network cartoons. The other half is House Flipping, Real Estate, Cars shows, and Mainstream Hollywood Action, Adventure, or Sci-Fi movies.

I went to see Planes in 3D in the Theater, even got passes for free. It felt like make for video movie. The animation was lacking in detail. The 3D was flat. The story was almost not existent and much to similar to the first Cars movie. The dialog was lacking in emotion. There was simply no passion or life in the movie.

People that know me know that I will watch just about anything, especially b-movies. Something so bad it's good you know. There was just very little here. It was almost like that old watching paint drying saying. I wanted to see the movie. I wanted to be there. I wanted to enjoy it. The longer I was there the movie I felt like I was just forcing myself to be there. After a while everyone else in my group started confessing the same thing. Twenty some minutes into the movie we felt bad, but just had to leave.",1377129600,3,1162,4.350230414746544
3030462,3,7799144076,"This movie is too similar to Cars.  Sometimes I felt like I was watching Cars.  The characters are very similar and so is the plot, the visuals, etc.  It was a slight disappointment for me.  Disney should have made this movie a direct to DVD like first intended.  I know that this review is a bit confusing but so was the movie.  Mixed feelings towards this film.  Some of it was good while some of it was to similar to Cars.",1376784000,6,425,4.172839506172839
3030463,3,7799144076,"FOREWARNING: This review contains spoilers on the plot.

I feel conflicted about this movie. After watching it, I couldn't decide how I feel about it. I didn't think it was amazing, but I didn't dislike it either.

The story is very similar to that of Cars, yet the main character isn't already a famous racer when the movie starts. Instead, it starts with Dusty Crophopper wanting to get away from home and join the Wings Around the World race. Nobody believes he can join because he was built to be a crop duster, not a racer. He also has a fear of heights, something you wouldn't expect from a plane. But with the help of a military veteran named Skipper, a gas truck named Chug, and a mechanic forklift named Dottie, Dusty is trained and gets into the race. The majority of the movie follows the race around the world and how Dusty overcomes some of his fears and steadily begins to climb up in the rankings. However, he faces stiff competition from a three-time champion plane named Ripslinger. Ripslinger begins to get jealous and does everything in his willpower to keep Dusty from winning. Dusty faces some major challenges, but he eventually overcomes his fears and wins the race.

While the story isn't exactly terrible, the similarity to Cars is definitely present. Heck, the setting of Planes is pretty much a fusion of the settings of both Cars movies! The similarities exist even with the characters.

Dusty is very reminiscent of Lightning McQueen. Dusty and McQueen are both racers and both end up learning an important lesson in the end. Dottie is similar to Sally, as both characters are doubtful at first (Dottie about Dusty's racing, Sally about the road getting fixed). Chug is all too similar to Mater in almost every way. Ripslinger is similar to Chuck, in the sense that he is determined to win and he would do anything to achieve that. But, the biggest similarity is between Skipper and Doc Hudson. In fact, Skipper is pretty much a carbon-copy of Doc, only as a plane and not a car. Skipper is a cranky old plane who refuses to assist Dusty, but ends up helping him anyway. Skipper, like Doc, has a rough past, as his profession led him to getting into an accident. This was the most obvious similarity out of the whole movie.

The jokes in this movie aren't very good. The puns are even worse. For example, ""For flying out loud!"" But the worst was the name of the aircraft carrier Dusty lands on to refuel: ""USS Flysinhower."" The stupidity of that name is almost too much to bear. This movie has little emotion, and I found it hard to get attached to any of the characters. The most emotional sequence was the part where Dusty crashes into the ocean, but even as it is, it's nowhere near as emotionally gut-wrenching as the ending to other Disney and Pixar movies.

In the end, though, I didn't entirely hate Planes. It's still a decent movie, but it's too much of a Cars rehash to stand out as a great movie. It's not the worst spinoff I've ever seen, but it's not the best either. In the end, Planes is a decent movie...it will entertain the young kids, but it will most likely disappoint older viewers. I give it 3 out of 5 stars.",1376611200,25,3160,4.54481546572935
3030464,1,7799144076,"Disney's production company, Pixar, has found a great deal of success with their popular Cars franchise, combining for more than $1 billion worldwide. It has featured the voices of some of Hollywood's finest and funniest, including Owen Wilson, Larry the Cable Guy, and Michael Caine.  Following two successful animated features, Cars and Cars 2, the franchise has also spawned spin-off television programs, video games, and even theme park attractions.  Like most things associated with Disney, the merchandise possibilities are endless for animated features and with the addition of more vehicles - so is the direction of the franchise.  Now, the Cars franchise has expanded its potential by adding Planes - a Cars spin-off that focuses on animated planes as the main characters.

Klay Hall (Tinker Bell and the Lost Treasure) directs the Cars spin-off, Planes, starring the voice of Dane Cook as Dusty Crophopper, a crop dusting airplane that tries out for the Wings Across the World race.  In order to win the race, planes are required to be fast and agile - and able to work through an obstacle course at high speeds.  However, even though Dusty is fast, he's not fast enough and must enlist the help of a former war veteran, Skipper Riley (Stacy Keach), to mentor and prepare him for the big race.  The voices of Teri Hatcher, Brad Garrett, Roger Craig Smith, and Julia Louise-Dreyfus also star in supporting roles.

The idea of animated cars only seemed logical, especially since bugs, toys, and anything else you can imagine is receiving the animation treatment.  With that rational, the next logical step was to expand the cars universe by adding planes to the mix.  And, after watching Planes, you'd assume future films will include trains, boats, or bikes.  Like I said, the future is endless.  But, before we get that far ahead, the focus is on Planes, which is essentially the same exact thing as the Cars films - only in plane form.  The Cars films are about racing, and Planes is about racing, too.  So, if you were to combine the elements of the first two Cars films and set it in the air, then that would make Planes a completely recycle story - which it is.

Even from the debut of its first trailer, Planes looked like it had the potential to run out of gas even before it made its way off the runway.  Sure enough, Planes looks and smells like every generic animated film out there these days, incorporating the same old underdog elements and sideline cheerleaders.  On top of the constant clichs is the fact that animation films focusing on the premise of racing are simply getting old.  Cars and its sequel focused on speed, not to mention Turbo - so it might be a stretch to imagine a Planes sequel focusing on a similar theme of the same generic story.  It's certainly time for them to think outside the box and come up with something a little more hip and entertaining.

The supporting cast this time around includes forklifts and airplanes with different nationalities, meaning there are Spanish, British, and several other themed planes to round out the worldwide ethnicity race around the world.  Some of the familiar voices of this film include Julia Louis-Dreyfus as a French Canadian racing plane, Carlos Alazraqui as a lovesick Spanish plane (that is decked out like a Mexican wrestler), and Brad Garrett of Everybody Love Raymond fame as Dusty's main sidekick.  Sadly, none of these characters are remotely interesting, humorous, or worthy of living on in the folklore of animation fame.

Overall, there aren't very many interesting things to say about this animated spin-off.  Planes simply doesn't make an effort to stand out against a crowed group of animated features, including Despicable Me 2 and Turbo - all of which are desperate to gain the attention of parents.  Dane Cook is certainly an interesting choice for a leading role, and actually excels in the position, but a weak supporting cast and a one-dimensional, predictable story will barely entertain the kids.  You'll be making a better choice if you just pop the Cars DVD in at home and wait for Planes to hit video.

Famous movie franchises can be like famous families. They can benefit from association, but they can also suffer at the hands of unending comparisons. And this may well be the case for 'Planes'.

In terms of a movie, 'Cars' was a massive success and taking this tale to the next level was undoubtedly the goal for Disney. In terms of media, marketing and merchandising, transforming 'Cars' into 'Planes' was a relatively straightforward exercise, however, it was a greater leap of faith to transform the movie.

Without being a spoiler, the 'Cars' template was overlaid on the 'Planes' concept and then tweaked here and there. The backdrop is once again a race circuit, albeit around the world, and the shifting fortunes play out on a leader board. The central character is not a shiny 'Lightning McQueen', but the little plane that could. Once again, a wise old character tempers the star's impetuosity and there is even a love interest, although it has shifted to a pair of co-stars.

There is no escaping the quality of the film's production. The animation, 'camera' angles, settings and colour are all first class. The audience even captures a sense of flight as the aircraft pitch and roll about the big screen. Visually, 'Planes' is captivating.

What is missing to some degree is the humour stemming from spontaneity that 'Cars' brought to the table. Achieving this was always going to prove a difficult task given that the first franchise had set a benchmark of great expectations and conjured preconceptions in the minds of the audience. Funnily enough, if a template was being applied, this film may have benefited from employing another 'Mater'. A goofy side-kick providing comic relief right on cue.

Personally, I enjoyed 'Planes', but then again, I couldn't sit more in the centre of Disney's target demographic profile if I tried. I am an aviation enthusiast with a young family. I was always probably going to give this film '5 Stars' as it offers another opportunity to share cherished laughter and common ground with my children. However, the real test for 'Planes' will come from those not so centrally located in Disney's cross-hairs. Can it possibly have the far-reaching impact of the highly successful 'Cars' films? It is a very, very tough act to follow. In the future, 'Planes 2' could actually benefit from being one step removed from the other franchise and build upon its own identity.

For me, there is one final acid test for the film. I was lucky enough to see the movie on its opening day in the United States, but I am now keen to see the looks on my own kids' faces when 'Planes' lands here in Australia. Only then will I be able to truly rate the success of 'Planes'. I'll get back to you then...

This film is too cute, funny and has great animation.

Dusty, (Dane Cook-Voice) is a basic crop-dusting plane with big dreams of competing in an aerial race. However he is afraid of heights, yes that's right, heights! In order for him to even get up the nerve to compete and pursue his dreams; he needs the help of his mentor, Skipper, (Stacy Keach-Voice) and his friends.

""Planes"" has a good story line and I really like it. It has hope, adventure and good humor with comedians Brad Garrett (Chug-Voice), Sinbad (Roper-Voice) and many more. All the voice actors do a great job portraying their characters. Of course, the 3D animation is spectacular with great detail and lots of lively colors. My favorite scene is when Skipper starts training Dusty and Chug and Dottie (Terri Hatcher-Voice) are talking too loud for Dusty to concentrate. Skipper yells at them to be quiet and they straighten up immediately, but keep talking. This is really funny. My favorite character is Roper, because he says and does the funniest things. He always seems to be rambling about something and is funny.

Writer, Jeffrey M. Howard, writes a comedic script that gives kids something to enjoy and feel good about. Another well known comedian voice cast who I enjoyed in this film is Cedric the Entertainer (Leadbottom-Voice).
As Walt Disney once said, ""All our dreams can come true, if we have the courage to pursue them.""  I really like this and believe this message is demonstrated throughout the film.

I recommend this film for ages 7 to 13. Kids who love Disney animation films will love this one as it is similar to other Disney films. It's also a great film for the family to see although older teens may not be too interested in it.

I give ""Planes"" 4 out of 5 stars because I would like to see more originality and uniqueness, but overall it is a great film and I really enjoy watching it. I know you will too.

Well folks, Disney's done it again! ""Planes"" is truly a heartfelt underdog story that tells the audience to believe in themselves.  There are always plenty of obstacles in life, but if you dig deep, you can find the courage to become whatever you dream of.  In Dusty's case, he dreams of becoming the fastest air racer in the world!  His closest friend is Dottie, a forklift and ace mechanic.  Although she tells Dusty that he isn't built to race and that chasing his dreams is downright dangerous, Dottie always has his back, no matter what he decides.  I love Dottie because she is such a loyal friend to Dusty.  She is strong, super smart and practical.  When anyone messes with her friend, she lets them have it!

Skipper is also very protective of Dusty.  He was an ace flier in WWII and chooses to be alone and quiet until Dusty talks him into training him for the race.  He wants to train Dusty hard so that he races well and stays safe.  Skipper finds that he can learn a few things from Dusty, too.

The visual effects in the film are spectacular and, being 3D, there are plenty of scenes where the audience feels as if they are flying along with Dusty!  The race takes us to amazing places like India, Europe and Mexico.  The music is great too, combining old favorites with lots of new songs.  Since the racers come from countries all over the world, the music is based on the background of the characters, which includes Italian, Mexican and British music, plus many more types.

It's no surprise that the director of Planes, Klay Hall, is an airplane enthusiast.  He started drawing airplanes at an early age and his father and grandfather were both pilots.  The executive producer of ""Planes,"" John Lasseter, is a two-time Academy Award-winning director.  He directed huge hits like ""Toy Story,"" ""A Bug's Life,"" ""Cars"" and ""Cars 2.""  The voice-over cast includes such big names as Dane Cook, Stacy Keach, Teri Hatcher, Sinbad, Val Kilmer and Julia Louis-Dreyfus.

My favorite scene in the film is when El Chupacabra (El Chu), the legendary Mexican racer, sings to a female racer, Rochelle.  El Chu is trying desperately to win her affection but, keeps failing in hilarious ways.
I give ""Planes"" five out of five stars and recommend it for ages 5 to 12, although it's fun for whole families to watch together, like mine did!  It comes to theaters Friday, August 9th, so be sure to check it out!

3030524,4,7799144076,"Why 4 star, well, hope Amazon representative will read the Why!

I have roku tv's (3 of them)  so is very comfortable to have a digital version and not only the bluray (that I have to play on the main TV), but au contraire of the blu ray version the amazon HD video only come in English.
My family is multilingual, me, Spanish speaker, wife, German Speaker, and we live in the US, so, our 4 children speak the 3 languages (since each of us speak with them in our mother language) , when watch the  blu ray  version they ask for some of the 3 languages regarding ...., they mood?..don't know really what make them today watch it in Spanish and tomorrow in English or German but the important is that they brain work in that way.
With amazon hd video version that part of the entertainment/brain exercise is lost , very, very very unfortunate.
Of course that happen with all the video content, hope they will fix that someday.....

The movie itself of course they love it, and is a 5 star in that way.
Sorry if you will complain about that the rating it must be about the movie itself and not about the amazon choice to cast it only in one language but ...well, perdon for that.",1502064000,,1176,4.3031674208144794

3030665,5,7799144076,"This is a great value for another really cute Disney movie.  It wasn't critically acclaimed, but in our household it's only second to Lightning McQueen and the Cars franchise with my three year old son.

This comes with the DVD (great for the car) Blu Ray (great for the TV) and digital copy (great for the Ipad or phone!).  So...your little Planes fan can have access anywhere you'd like him or her to!  It's a really great price for what you get.  We've only watched it a few times, but already it's worth it!

This movie stars Dusty Crophopper, a crop duster who dreams of being a racing plane.  He enters in the Wings Around the Globe Rally to race against many other 'real' racing planes.  He makes many friends and has many adventures along the way.  If a message is important to you in a kids movie, this has a 'you can be anything you want to be' and a 'never give up on yourself or your dreams' message.  Or, if you just like to be entertained, this is great for that too!

It has cute characters and is an all around fun family film.  I was really happy to get this movie in all 3 forms for such a good price.  Highly recommend!",1469577600,4,1138,4.2372093023255815

And its storyline is also pretty strong; way better the storyline from the Cars franchise. And also, the soundtrack was okay, but honestly, my favorite score of the entire soundtrack was when Dusty finally faced his fear of heights, despite the dizzy view down bellow (Dusty Soars). But my least favorite score of the entire soundtrack was this-Dusty crashing right into the ocean, all because of his distracting thoughts about his coach Skipper, and also ended up with him almost dying of drowning (Dusty Has to Ditch). But all in all, this movie was pretty cool.",1460332800,,959,5.037735849056604

3030883,2,7799144076,"I would advise caution to anyone with high expectations for PLANES, Disney's
animated effort that attempts to ride the coattails of the CARS franchise.
First, you will notice the fact that I mentioned this was a Disney film -- not Pixar.
It doesn't take long for one to see that many of the signature elements that make
a Pixar film what it is are mostly missing here. Secondly, it turns out that PLANES
was conceived as a direct-to-video release and somewhere along the way, the
decision was made to release it theatrically.  Quite frankly, it's a bit sad to see Disney
has milked the franchise with this release at the expense of movie-going patrons
expecting something better.

PLANES takes place in the same similar universe as CARS.  Though it's a world
void of humans, the film pokes fun at many man-made landmarks.  As the story
opens we meet Dusty Crophopper (Dane Cook), a Midwestern crop-duster who
may be small on props, but very big on guts.  You see, he dreams of one day
becoming a racer and joining the elite who are flying in the Wings Around The
World race.  In the type of underdog story we have seen countless times before,
Dusty enlists the help of Skipper (Stacy Keach), a gruff WWII navy war veteran
who helps the brave little plane overcome his fears and prepare for the big race.

Despite this being an animated adventure that takes its viewers racing around
the world to exotic places, PLANES never allows most minds to go off of auto-pilot.
All the elements that Pixar would have brought to the table to make this film more
engaging are completely missing.  Instead we have an all-too-familiar story filled
with clichd characters and lame jokes that will probably go over the heads of its
targeted juvenile audience.

PLANES looks outstanding on Blu-ray.  Created entirely in the digital realm, this is
the kind of flawless transfer you expect to see from an animated feature like this.
This picture-perfect window allows viewers to appreciate the sharp imaging and
array of warm, glowing colors.  I even took notice of the deep level of blacks within
some of the propellors.  The only unfortunate thing to say about this great transfer
is that the animation seems dumbed down to its basics, giving us so much less to
absorb in keep our interests alive.

If I could have given a piece of advice to Disney about marketing this lackluster
spin-off, it would have been to push the envelope as far as the 3D presentation is
concerned.  I have seen plenty of bad movies suddenly turn into something worthwhile
all because of its stellar 3D presentation.  Sadly, PLANES stays mostly grounded in
3D, giving a decent perception of depth but with no pop-out whatsoever.  I sat grumbling
in my seat as I watched many missed opportunities for the filmmakers to have greatly
enhanced certain elements of the film including falling snow, rain and confetti that stay
completely within the confines of the screen. There are two sequences that come near
the end of the film that look pretty decent in 3D:  A storm at sea with pouring rain and
mounting waves that Dusty must overcome -and- a race over desert canyons that is sort
of reminiscent of the pod scene in Star Wars Episode I.  Still, overall, it seems that
everything about the 3D presentation is paint-by numbers. When are Disney animators
going to learn that there is more to this format than just depth?  Give audiences something
extra for the money you are charging them to see flops like this.  I would thrown every 3D
gimmick I could into this film just to give people something positive to talk about afterwards.

The most noteworthy points I can give to PLANES is its 7.1 DTS-MA soundtrack (which
has been downconverted to 5.1 on my system).  This is a very aggressive mix with lively
surround activity that remains constant throughout the film.  From the film's opening credits
you get the sense of the power this soundtrack provides and the amount of LFE thrust behind
it all.  Composer Mark Mancina provides quite a bit of punch with the film's orchestration that
covers a wide range of genres including rock, hip-hop, metal and samba.  With the seemingly
constant roar of jet engines laid on top of that, there is no need for caffeine to keep one awake.
I personally enjoyed the excessive use of multi-channel conversation that have voices moving
across the room, giving the viewer a better sense of character positioning.  In all, the most
impressive part of this film seems to be its sound mix and its the one thing that will probably
keep adults most engaged.

Planes arrives as a 3-Disc Combo (Blu-Ray 3D+Blu-Ray+DVD/Digital Copy) with a non-
lenticular cardboard sleeve.  It should be no surprise that the extra features are a bit sparse
and include deleted scenes and other featurettes that are geared more towards the kids than
giving any insight into the making of the film itself.

What more can be said about Disney's efforts to cheaply capitalize on Pixar's Cars
franchise in making a theatrical release out of direct-to-video material?  There is nothing
about PLANES that will appeal to adults -- note even its inclusion of 3D that provides little
else than a sense of depth.  This is a purchase one should only consider for young kids, and
even as such, don't even bother spending the extra money for the 3D.",1453075200,,5302,4.774370208105148

Also, it's okay for you to totally assume things about other people and then get mad at them when the assumptions that you failed to research turn out to be false.

3030951,3,7799144076,"I'm torn on whether I want to give this 3 or 4 stars.  I felt like a few of the extremely negative reviews were accurate in saying this was just like Cars but with Planes.  Obviously some changes were made, but there were a LOT of similarities.  It wasn't so horrible to us that I felt it needed a 1 star review but it definitely wasn't terrific.  The other problem with this movie is that my kids didn't really like it.  I had a hard time keeping interest in it as well.  Unfortunately, we bought this at the same time as we bought other movies from Disney (Frozen, The Princess and the Frog... stuff like that) so the kids preferred some of the other movies and have not really wanted to watch this one very much.

I guess we can consider this like most spin-offs of movies... and not as good as the original movie obviously.  It doesn't seem that bad, but it was a little disappointing.  We're going to try it again when the weather gets worse and I'll update if anything changes for the better or worse.  For now, I would be prepared for a similar story as Cars. : /",1446076800,3,1070,4.226600985221675

3031067,3,7799144076,"As straightforward as spinoffs can get, really. Kids love talking cars, and kids love toy airplanes, so kids will love talking airplanes too, right? And they do, or at least mine do, even if none of this cast has half the sparkle or charisma of a Lightning McQueen or a Tow Mater. Which should speak volumes, since both are pretty much the bottom of the barrel in Pixar's repertoire. As competition-focused racing movies go, it's middle of the pack - energetic and often lovely, but flat as a board and thoroughly predictable. Younger audiences will thrill to the frequent chase scenes, with a good mix of terrain thrown in as appreciable spice, but their chaperones won't find much material hiding beneath the surface. Cars had a timely message about the loss of the great American highway lurking under there, and at least Cars 2 had some buck to its script, but there's really nothing more to this one than a simple played-out underdog sporting saga. And hey, that's perfectly okay. There's plenty of room on the screen for bright, shiny, cookie-cutter kids' fare, and it certainly doesn't offend. It's just no comparison to the Pixar-branded forerunners that paved these lanes. Good enough for a quiet evening, no more, no less, and it gave my three-year-old boys a good dose of imagination fuel.",1436745600,,1300,4.86036036036036

I brought the combo package cause my little brother always ends up scratching the disc and have replace them.

Though it is sometimes a pain in the butt getting the movie and iTunes to communicate with each other. I would buy this again if I have to. Thanks seller,1436400000,,471,4.363636363636363

3031101,3,7799144076,"I never feel compelled to watch all the direct to video movies from companies I like.  After all, theres usually a reason these movies didn't hit theaters.  Yes, Ill occasionally miss a gem, but that is rare.

Which brings us to Planes.  Released by Disney without Pixars involvement (although John Lasseter, creator of Cars was heavily involved in his role as head of Disney studios), it was originally designed to be a direct to video film in the world of Pixars Cars but introducing new characters.  However, somewhere along the line they decided to release it to theaters first.  I never quite caught it while in theaters, but I did get it on Blu-Ray.  Turns out I wasn't missing much.

Dusty (voiced by Dane Cook) is a crop duster, a plane that flies back and forth in straight lines all day long.  But he longs for something more  racing.  As soon as he gets off work, he starts to practice with the help of his friend Chug (Brad Garrett), a truck that is reading Flying for Dummies to help Dusty out.

His ultimate dream is to fly in the Wings Around the World race, and when he surprisingly gets his chance, hes thrilled.  But can he keep up with his competition?  Will his fear of heights be an issue?  And what about the other planes who want to see him fail?

The animation in this movie is beautiful.  Its almost enough to make me wish Id seen it in the theater.  Over the course of the movie, we travel all around the world, and the stuff we fly by is just wonderful to look at.

Unfortunately, the story isn't as good as the animation.  It is fairly predictable.  Now I don't mind that as much, however, I never fully got involved in the story.  Instead, I just sat back and waited for the next event to unfold.

For that, I blame the characters.  There are just too many planes in the movie, and there are several sub-plots involving these secondary characters.  The result is that nothing and no one is given quite enough time to develop.  I think I would have enjoyed it more if I had gotten to know Dusty and one of two others better.  The secondary character plots could have been dropped, especially the romance, and I would have been fine.

Now that isn't to say I didn't have fun.  The romance I just mentioned provided a very funny scene.  There are some great jokes along the way, and a couple of times, I was pulled into an action sequence or two that were pretty suspenseful.

And this isn't the fault of the voice cast at all.  In addition to the others Ive already mentioned, weve got the likes of Julia Louis-Dreyfus, Teri Hatcher, John Cleese, Cedric the Entertainer, Sinbad, and Val Kilmer.  Everyone does a great job of bring their characters to life, and honestly, if you don't know who is playing the voices, you don't hear it at all.  And yes, for those of you keeping track, John Ratzenberger does have a blink and you miss him cameo.

In the end, I think Planes will appeal more to kids than adults, and they will love it.  Me?  I enjoyed parts of it, but I don't see myself pulling this one out all that frequently.",1434067200,,3053,4.397137745974955

3031470,4,7799144076,"***This review may contain spoilers.***

About halfway through ""Disney's Planes"" (hereafter ""D's Planes), one of Ripslinger's (voice of Roger Smith) bumbling lackeys (Ned or Zed, I couldn't tell) admits Dusty Crophopper's (voice of Dane Cook) efforts to compete in the worldwide flying race is a ""compelling Rocky tale"".  I think he's mostly right, except ""Rocky"" ends a little bit differently.  But ""D's Planes"" has the other ""Rocky"" cliches in abundance.

We have the underdog, a determined but outclassed and unlikely racing contender in the form of a low-flying cropduster (Dusty) who has the added handicap of acrophobia (fear of heights, but in this case, heights over 1,000 feet!).  We have the underdog's loyal buddy and moral support in the form of the Mater-like fuel truck Chug (voice of Brad Garrett).  We have the grizzled, gravelly-voiced, demanding racing trainer (and Dusty's idol) in the form of heroic veteran aerial bomber Skipper Riley (voice of Stacy Keach) who harbors a shameful secret.  We have the unscrupulous, sneaky current flying champion, the aforementioned Ripslinger, and his minions (not THOSE minions) Ned and Zed (voice of Gabriel Iglesias), willing to do anything to knock Dusty out of the race.  Finally, we have the diverse, colorful, if stereotypical fellow racers and opponents such as the veddy British Bulldog (voice of John Cleese), the flirtatious Rochelle (voice of Julie Louis-Dryfuss), and the flamboyant Casanova El Chupacabra (voice of  Carlos Alazraqui).

Yup, we have the millionth version of the underdog tale.  But, in the final analysis, so what?  How many films are really that original anyway?  And everyone likes a well-told, inspirational underdog story, no matter how many times we've heard it, right? Right?  Well, anyway, I contend that ""D's Planes"" has several positive qualities that make this same old tale well worth watching.

The first, most striking one is its visual artistry and photo-simulating effects.  Even though like its obvious ancestors ""Cars"" and ""Cars II"" we're dealing with sentient, living machines, the backgrounds and scenery feel so meticulously real and accurate.  A second quality is ""D's Planes"" mechanical and aviation knowledge which I guess was inaccessible to most watchers except machine experts, but didn't make you feel stupid that you didn't know it (like me).  I still found that knowledge was impressive. A third one is the race from the perspective of the airplanes - the bankings, the divebombings, the barrel rolls, the acrobatics- that convince you that absolutely nothing beats flying as the single most exciting, exhilarating activity on earth.

However, the most important quality is the underdog Dusty himself, on whose wings the movie hangs. Dusty is ambitious and determined to be more than a farm worker, but he is not brash and cocky.  On the contrary, he is humble, hardworking, and gracious and helpful to everybody, even to opponents like Bulldog and El Chupacabra.  As a result, Dusty begins to grow on others who would never have given him a chance before, and even begin to help him.  Kindness CAN pay dividends.  Dusty even persuades the reclusive Skipper to not only train him, but to even overcome his own stigma to come to Dusty's aid when Ripslinger tries to sabotage him.  Yes, Dusty is a fine role model.

In conclusion, even though ""D's Planes"" lacks the adult sophistication of other Pixar movies, and is going, more or less, where you think it's going, it makes the journey worthwhile.  Besides the previously mentioned qualities, it's clean and family-friendly, except for a risque bit involving removal of Dusty's ""sprayer"" to reduce weight and drag (""You can reattach it, right?""). The race showcases the globe well and the geological and climate obstacles the planes face. It convincingly converts the soul classic ""Love Machine"" into a ballad El Chupacabra uses to serenade Rochelle.  Most effectively, though ""D's Planes"" doesn't insist upon it, like ""Rocky"", it convinces us that, regardless of the outcome, those who never give up are always winners.",1419897600,,4084,5.214395099540582

3031858,3,7799144076,"My toddler son (and both his parents) really enjoy the Cars movie.  We had high expectations for Planes, but I have to say it was a mostly disappointing experience.  It may not be fair to compare it to Cars, but it's almost impossible not to.

The storyline is fairly entertaining but where this movie really falls short of Cars is the characters.  The main character, Dusty Crophopper, is a far cry from Lightning McQueen.  He's kind of bland and not very entertaining or comical.  The supporting characters just aren't as well written or as memorable as the Cars supporting cast.  The best character in the movie is El Chupacabra.  He brings some much needed comic relief to the movie.  Honestly I wish he had been a larger part of the movie.  Even with El Chupacabra, there's still no one that really compares to characters like Lightning McQueen and Mater.

By the time the movie was over, my main thought was ""Meh, it was just ok.""  I think my son shared the sentiment because he wasn't really into the movie and hasn't asked to watch it again (like he has with Cars).  So unfair or not, the comparison has to be made, and this movie is a far cry from the richly entertaining experience of Cars.",1407110400,,1200,4.525581395348837

3031949,2,7799144076,"First there was Cars then Planes next we'll get another thinly scripted, cheap film on Boats or Trains or any other mobile item. I did enjoy 'Planes' at all. I mean, it's not even a Pixar film! It's a Disney film, but not from Disney Animations or Pixar, it's from Disneytoons! A studio that works for Disney and makes DIRECT TO DVD movies off of Disney's already existing products. And that's what they were doing with 'Planes' until a test screening impressed Disney enough to move it to the theater instead of direct to DVD. I can't see why it ever made it to the cinema. It's not worthy of being seen by theater patron's. To be honest I didn't much care for 'Cars' which this spin off is based on. I didn't hate it but I didn't love it either. However the film had enough charm and heart to redeem itself as still worthy to carry Pixar's name... 'Planes' has neither enough charm, heart, or anything actually. My review of 'Planes'.

'Planes' tells the tale of Dusty Crophopper (originally voiced by Jon Cryer, but at the last minute was replaced by comedian Dane Cook) a crop-duster in the small town of Radiator Springs- no I mean another small town called Propwash Junction, a place that lays in the middle of nowhere. Dusty dreams of flying in races practicing every night, hoping that one day he'd be good enough to compete in the Wings Around the Globe Competition. This year he decides to try and qualify for the competition. Falling short of qualifying, after another racer is axed, Dusty is allowed to move up a position and qualifies for the Wings Competition. Dusty now must conquer his fear of heights, and fly, fly, fly with the help of a retired war veteran (Stacy Keach) and his friends.

Yawn, yawn, yawn. Been there, seen that. This is your average kiddie fair. The script is dumbed down, predictable, and very unfunny. Not to mention the film is almost a complete replica of the far superior 'Cars', just switched around the main characters from cars to planes. About ten minutes into the film I knew everything that was going to happen. Nothing about the film surprises me, or delights me. The film can be seen as made for children, but I doubt even them will get much out of this. The jokes, are seen, you know they're there but they just aren't funny. The dialogue is somewhat laughable, and clich.

The animation is below-par. It's sad; it's rough and seems to have been done by a bunch of people straight out of college. I mean, when you compare the animation of 'Planes' to that of any other Pixar or Disney film, you can tell 'Planes' animation is by far worse. However, I must express my admiration for the flying sequences, that seem to be done with ease... well some of them anyways. Some of them just don't look good, while others do.

Character wise, you don't relate to, or care for anybody. Our lead, Dusty Crophopper, is just so bland and uninspired, without any real motivation for anything. He's just unrelatable, and boring. The rest of the competitors are mostly stereotypes of different cultures. The only character you can even feel for is Skipper, but even his story is underwhelming.

Voice cast wise, 'Cars' had the upper hand, but 'Planes' didn't do that bad itself. 'Dane Cook' is fine as Dusty, no matter how bad his dialogue is. 'Stacy Keach' basically mimic's 'Paul Newman's' voice as Doc from 'Cars'. The other competitor's vocals are good enough to portray the characters stereotypes in their respective cultures.

All and All 'Planes' try's to soar but crashes. Its predictable, unfunny, and almost a replica of 'Cars'. Adults will hardly be able to manage sitting through it, and while small children will enjoy it, most anybody else may not. D 4/22/14

'Planes' is rated PG for mild action and rude humor. It's appropriate for kids 5 and up. However I doubt anybody over 10 will be willing to watch this one.",1404691200,2,3864,4.640350877192983

The true irony is that a film about aircraft manages to be so middle-of-the-road. Someone took a copy of the Save the Cat plot template and put in the very minimum amount of effort required to get this on screen.

There are some characters. There are some jokes. Theres every plot point you'd expect and nothing that you dont. Its not actually unpleasant to watch, but nor is it something that youll think about seconds after leaving the cinema.

Whenever a current Disney 3D production is similar in any way to another production, I know it isn't Pixar who made it.  The boys at Pixar are true to the Walt-Disney spirit - nothing they produce is ever like something they've done before.  Except for their unparalled superiority - we can always count on that.

This is why I was soooooo disappointed when Pixar sold to Disney.  It was like selling the Mona Lisa to a flea market.  I knew we'd never again see the world-class stories and animation that again and again came out of Pixar Studios, and I knew I'd never see little hopping Luxor.  Current Disney makes bad decisions and bad movies.  They are hacks.

Hence Planes.  A rip-off of cars.  Nothing creatively demanding in rewriting a story to accommodate different characters.  Ho hum.  Disney: One-trick ponies.",1401062400,5,985,4.890909090909091

3032061,3,7799144076,"I was on a Disney cruise ship a while back and one of the special movie premiers was Planes. I am a huge fan of Pixar and looking at the obvious similarities between this and the Cars movies I assumed it was Pixar's latest film entry. Monster's University was also on the bill that week which further solidified my thoughts that this was another Pixar film.

I enjoyed it, but thinking it was Pixar I thought to was sub-par considering their past efforts. It's a cute little movie more aimed at children. It's simplistic storyline, along with familiar characters (even thou this time they are in the shape of planes rather then cars) makes this one forgettable.

Since this isn't actually a Pixar release I would give it 4 stars for kids, but adults may want to catch it on cable or forget it all together. The Blu Ray looks and sounds flawless so if you're a fan......buy it.",1397520000,,876,4.50314465408805

I liked Cars and my son (now 3.5) and I have watched Cars for truly countless number of times. But Cars2 took a violent dark turn and we had to put that away so the impressionable mind of a 3 yr old did not have to see all the ""killing"" and shooting etc. I thought Planes would be like Cars. Nope! It's more like Cars2. It is a great storyif you can discern that it's just a story, that too animated. For my son, it's all too real and he gets scared at some of the parts, and some of the other parts are a tad too violent (shooting, slicing!! I mean come on, really!) and could easily influence a little boy to think those actions/behaviors are okay and acceptable.

My husband and I don't love it, partly because Dane Cook is Dusty's voice (which disturbs us after hearing his stand-up routines) and partly because the story line is very similar to Cars 2 (as another reviewer has mentioned). I had such high hopes for this movie and was very excited about the military jets playing a role, but instead they made it an international race. I am disappointed in the script and had expected more from Pixar. Nevertheless, we have a preschooler who loves it, and we have bought several of the die-cast planes from Target and it is entertaining to hear him reenact the movie scenes.

Also, we got a digital copy with our DVD purchase and chose to redeem it on Amazon so that our son could watch it on the Kindle Fire, but it is ""locked"" and we are unable to download it. I spent over thirty minutes on the phone with Kindle support and she worked very hard to find a solution, but for some reason this digital copy can only be played on our computer.

Planes gives life to those personalities and takes the viewer through an entertaining story of a little crop duster with aspirations of being a highly competitive air racer. I enjoy paying attention to how props and landscape play into the aviation theme such as the mountainous terrain resembles aircraft lined up on a tarmac. I would recommend Planes to anyone who enjoys watching movies for what the movie brings to them entertainment value wise.

Not many extras on regular DVD with meet the characters & a rather dreary homage to Planes origin called Klay's Flight Plan that drips in some overly patriotic sentiment as if some family found the corner market to unique experiences to family bond by flying fighter planes.

3032297,5,7799144076,"I was hesitant to buy this because the kids wore me out on Cars and Cars 2. I figured it would be the exact same movie, but with planes. It was different enough to be interesting and I found myself enjoying it. More importantly, the kids like it. Dusty, the main character, is kind, humble, and yet has a competitive spirit - nice change from some of our characters these days. Happy with purchase and I haven't minded watching it more than once.",1392508800,,446,4.385542168674699

Kids really liked it, but probably won't watch it over and over again. Cars sequels were more fun than this.",1392508800,,265,4.541666666666667

3032307,4,7799144076,Based on the reviews from critics I had read prior to watching this I expected this movie to be horrible. I bought it as a present for my son for Christmas because he asked for it and I watched it with him once. What critics don't think about when writing reviews is some movies are made for CHILDREN not middle aged nothing impresses me adults. This movie was just fine for everyone in my family but maybe that just makes us a bunch of simpletons.,1392422400,,448,4.2823529411764705

The story of a person/plane being told you can't do something merely because of 'what' you are, and then turning to friends and family for help really sets the mood in this show.

We spent Christmas together and the adults were just as excited as the child, to complete the day's dinner and celebrations, so we could reach the evening hour, to gather in front of the big screen at home, and watch this 3-D movie together. It amazes me that those who craft these movies think of both children and the adult audience. There were so many hilarious lines which parents and adults think of as ""code"" past the age of 30, and especially having raised a family. Some of the time we were howling with laughter so loud, we had to hit ""pause"" and my grandson was trying to figure out the joke. But he loved it, too.

3032402,4,7799144076,"In the event that you wonder how in the world the Pixar Cars franchise morphed into the Disney Planes universe (of which this film is the first of a proposed trilogy), lets take a look at interesting road that led to the pieces development.  After the merger of Disney and Pixar (a union affectionately termed Pixney); the lines between the two companies were forever blurred to the point where Pixar works (like Brave) bear the names of almost none of the individuals typically associated with Pixar while Disney pieces like the Tinker Bell films, Tangled, Frozen, and Planes boast Executive Production duties by none other than Pixar poster-boy John Lasseter.

Planes actually takes the connection quite a bit further by crediting Lasseter as one of the writers, cameos John Ratzenberger (who appears in every one of Pixars productions) as Harland and follows Pixars impeccable attention to detail concerning such details as actual plane make/ model likeness, geography, historical accuracy and so on.  Yet the fact remains the film isn't considered a Pixar production and in fact comes to us from the typically direct-to-dvd branch of the Diz known as DisneyToon Studios (whos last theatrical release takes us back to 2005 in the form of  Pooh's Heffalump Movie).  Planes too was supposed to be a direct-to-dvd affair with a fairly modest budget of $50-mil but thanks to a theatrical release gap left between Monsters University and Frozen, Planes got the nod to debut on the big screen on  August 9, 2013.

Confused? Dont be- all of the behind-the-scenes antics in the world do not a good (or bad) movie make.  Fortunately Planes has the advantage of sitting atop a very long line of animated film experience.  While critics weren't particularly enamored with the film, I can attest that it succeeds on a lot of levels where the much costlier ($200-mil) 2011 blockbuster Cars 2 fails.  But before we get to all of that, perhaps a brief summary is in order.

Planes follows the exploits of crop duster Dusty Crophopper (Dane Cook) who holds down steady employment at a Midwest cornfield while practicing aerobatic maneuvers in his spare time and dreaming of the fame and excitement of air racing.

Keeping his dreams forever out of reach, his boss, Leadbottom (Cedric the Entertainer) and his forklift mechanic friend, Dottie (Teri Hatcher) keep reminding Dusty that he was built for the very specific purpose of dusting crops.  However, his good hearted fuel truck friend, Chug (Brad Garrett); think a less redneck but equally innocent Mater, begins training him in private.  The night before the qualifiers, Dusty asks an elderly and reclusive navy war plane named Skipper Riley (Stacy Keach) to teach him how to race.  What follows is a global race adventure rife with personified planes from several nations; some friendly others not so much.

Coming in at a runtime of 92-minutes and wearing a PG rating, Planes works on the tried and true underdog out of his league formula and delivers some pretty genuine laughs along the way.  Sure its nothing we haven't collectively seen before, but what Planes lacks in originality it makes up for with heart.  That and some really nice aerial scenes that (unlike say Cars 2s action sequences), don't take away from the subtle charm of the narrative in the process.

If you really care about small details you may notice a whole plethora of little adult-enjoyable spices scattered about like Val Kilmer and Anthony Edwards as Naval fighter jets; essentially the Planes versions of their Top Gun characters complete with Iceman and Goose helmets to boot.

In all Planes doesnt succeed in spite of its simplicity and relatively modest budget but because of these things.  In an industry becoming ever more inflated in terms of budget and eye-candy, Planes is a refreshing romp in a franchise that seemed to have lost its way a bit in its first dedicated sequel.  Whether or not diving directly into a trilogy is a wise move is yet to be determined but considering the first Planes movie cost $50-mil to make and has already taken in $220-million, its a safe bet to say well be visiting this anthropomorphic world of transportation for years to come.",1391299200,,4195,4.9374110953058326

3032472,3,7799144076,"There is not a lot to say, good or bad about Planes. It clearly is an offshoot of the Cars franchise, and the storyline/concept aren't groundbreaking, but it's not a disappointment, either. If your kids like Cars/most Pixar movies (or even enjoy playing with toy cars/planes, etc.), they'll probably enjoy the film; it is, after all, a kids' movie.",1390521600,,348,4.915254237288136
3032473,4,7799144076,"An offshoot of the ""Cars"" franchise, ""Planes"" sets its classic be-all-you-can-be underdog story in the context of a lowly crop duster (Dane Cook) who dreams of one day competing against the big boys of the air (i.e., all those planes built for speed) in a race around the world. With the help of a fuel truck (Brad Garrett), two forklifts (Terri Hatcher and Danny Mann) and a retired navy bomber named Riley (Stacy Keach), who imparts his wisdom and pointers to the eager, fresh-faced lad, Dusty sets out to prove that he is every bit the flyer that those bigger, sleeker and more aerodynamically advanced airplanes are. Just one slight problem though: turns out little Dusty is deathly afraid of heights.

With its roots planted firmly in the tradition of ""Around the World in 80 Days"" and ""The Great Race,"" ""Planes"" has grace and charm to spare, as Dusty swoops and soars through the heavens on his way to realizing his dreams. Along the way, he meets up with an international potpourri of fellow aircraft, including Bulldog (John Cleese ) from England, El Chupacabra (Carlos Alazraqui) from Mexico, Rochelle (Julia Louise-Dreyfuss) from Canada (the French part, of course) and Ishani (Priyanka Chopra) from India.

And off we sail into the wild blue yonder, thanks to a witty script by Jeffrey M. Howard, clean direction by Klay Hall, and top-notch visuals that beautifully create a familiar-looking modern world that's totally devoid of people (even the Statue of Liberty is in the form of a patriotic forklift). All those elements combine to make this animated version of ""Those Magnificent Men in Their Flying Machines"" (minus the men, of course) a delight to behold.

In fact, ""Planes"" is what ""Cars"" logically should have been but wasn't, that is a freewheeling adventure built on movement and speed; instead, the original movie, for some reason, allowed itself to get mired in that dull small town for so long that it eventually stalled out. ""Planes,"" on the other hand, keeps the narrative in full-speed-ahead mode throughout - and that makes all the difference.",1390435200,,2072,4.965417867435159

My blu-ray player's firmware is up to date, so I know it's not that.  All other movies work fine, too, so I'm pretty sure it's just this movie.  Maybe I got a defective disc, I don't know, but as I watch the movie, there is an occasional, very loud, ""chirp"" (for lack of a better word).  I suspect this is some sort of copy protection scheme that my player doesn't like.  Don't even get me started on copy-protection rubbish--anyone who really wants to copy the disc is going to find a way to do it.  Period.  There is always a work-around.  The only way to foil a pirate is to make the disc have so many errors that the copy program gets confused and drops packets and stuff.  Great--now you've prevented the movie from being copied, but you have also made my legally purchased copy not play properly on my set.  Stupid Hollywood.

3032483,1,7799144076,"Steve Jobs and Walt Disney are rolling in their graves on this one.  Pixar is the top of the line, can't miss, Cadillac of studios when it comes to animated films.  You will notice that this is not a Pixar film like Cars, but rather Disney (who now owns Pixar) so they knew it wasn't worthy of their premium nameplate.  John Lassiter has a credit on the film, but I refuse to believe this brilliant man had any input into this terrible film.

I have three children (12,9 and 6) and by the time the film ended I was the only one left in the room.  I think my 12 year old actually went and straightened up her room on her own rather than lose 2 hours of her life to this half-baked flop.  The story is boring, and actually a little difficult to follow as they brew up twists and turns to add angst to an otherwise totally predictable plot.  This reminds me of the dark days of Disney when they put out Peter Pan 2 and 3, 102 Dalmations, and other terrible spinoffs to separate you from $20 with little or no effort on their part.

The market has shown it will happily give you hundreds of millions of dollars for producing quality, computer animated films so why this?  Disney couldn't do it on their own so they bought Pixar and this is what we get?  Somebody rescue John Lassiter from the dungeon of Cinderella's castle so he can straighten things out.

3032510,1,7799144076,"I honestly believe that Disney employed people to rate this movie four stars and above, because there is no way any person, young or old, with a normal attention span could find this movie enjoyable.

One person who rated it four stars argued that it's a children's movie, and therefore doesn't need a well thought out plot, good characterization, etc; and to that I say nay, nay.  Do children not deserve good story lines and character development?  Are we so lazy and jaded as a society that we should just recycle plots and narratives, then use youth as a rationalization?  I say nay, nay.

But even if we look at it from a child's standpoint, it is still exceedingly dull.  The kids in my family, who otherwise enjoy going to see flicks, were so squirmy and bored by it that they kept asking when it would be over.  It's the same frickin story as Cars, for God's sake!  Only this time the protagonist is a whiny, self-indulgent plane with grandiose ideas of becoming a race plane.  Nothing interesting happens, and the characters mirror those from cars, except this time the acting is atrocious.

Just because it is a children's movie does not mean that Disney has the right to abandon originality and interesting story ideas. Children deserve better. Originality and excellent character development are what make films stand the test of time.

3032544,5,7799144076,This is a great movie and our 2 year old grandson loves it and would watch it everyday if his Mom let him. It has a very similar feeling to it as the Cars movies and is not boring for adults either.,1389830400,,198,3.738095238095238

3032546,3,7799144076,"Too much talking and conversations. This would work for a possible 3 year old and on up. Movie is slow, not a lot of action and kind of boring. My husband and I usually like these types of cartoons too and did not hold our interest much.",1389830400,,237,4.0638297872340425

3032553,3,7799144076,"Disney fail!  I would have thought they could get more creative.  This is practically the same story as cars.  My 3 year old son liked it okay, but the rest of the family didn't even sit through it.",1389830400,,198,4.157894736842105
3032554,3,7799144076,"Not the best plot, but my three year old boys love it.  It seems suspiciously easy for this plane who barely got into the race to always be in the lead, especially on the last leg when he starts off well after everyone.  For an adult, this plot is way to simple and far fetched to be believed.  For a kid, I don't really like the message that you will instantly be the best at whatever you want to do because that's not realistic, but it's not a bad movie, there are just much better ones out there",1389830400,,498,4.061224489795919

3032572,4,7799144076,"I really enjoyed this movie!  It was better than I was expecting and it kept me interested!  My young son has a new favorite movie.

Dusty is a crophopper who dreams of being more than just what he was built for!  He works hard and tries out to be in an international sky race.  No one is more surprised that he gets in than Dusty himself.  He lacks confidence in himself.  With the help of ""The Skipper"" Dusty starts training for his race.  He gains some self-confidence and realizes that his dream can be a reality.  He is a crophopper in an internation race.  Maybe he can even win!  Dusty is an inspiration, you can do anything if you work hard!  He also teaches kids to just be yourself!  Don't change who you are just to impress someone, be yourself and you never know what might happen!

After being slightly disappointed with Cars 2 I didn't have huge expectations for Planes.  I was pleasantly surprised at how much I enjoyed this one!  It goes back to the roots of pixar and delivers a great story with lots of valuable lessons for the kids that are the intended audience!

If you have young kids you should give this one a watch, boys or girls, this is a great family movie!",1389657600,,1185,4.337899543378995

One of the things we loved was the attention to flight detail. We both held pilots licenses at one time. We know the rules and the problems that can happen on cross country races. The hidden agenda of the 'evil' planes added just the right amount of conflict.
I liked this much better than cars.

3032633,4,7799144076,"honestly i really liked this one. i am a mother of 2, a 5 year old boy and a 2 year old girl. my girl loved the movie til she fell asleep, my son sat up and watched the whole thing. this movie along with cars so far are the only 2 he has actually fallen in love with. i as a mother thought it was super cute (with some adult humor for us parents, and references to things i know i laughed at). i liked all the planes, and i appreciated that they didn't just change the whole world over to 'planes' that you could still see cars, and things. **i was hoping to see a mater or lightening mcqueen somewhere amungst the movie ;)
the voice of the friend truck is the actor from everybody loves raymond (brad garrett) and he was super cute and funny.
i also really liked that they took you around the world, that was quite fun.

pros
fun
gets you on the edge of your seat
fun for children
animation was easy to understand

cons
storyline was lackluster

but honestly, from a disney movie how crazy does a story really need to be?

i loved it, and have watched it 2x now. i would say if your child loved cars and cars 2 and is tired of princesses (which my son is) this is refreashing and classic.",1389225600,,1189,4.068376068376068

It also has some great opportunities to teach your kids important life lessons as well. Some of the things it teaches are how to be a good loser, how to be a good winner, how to make and be friends, that some things are more important than winning, how to overcome fears, the importance of honesty, the importance of integrity and - maybe more than anything - the importance of courage and dedication.",1389139200,2,666,4.370967741935484

It's well written and has a good story line. I think it's great for everyone young and old, but especially for kids because I think it teaches a valuable life lesson. The lesson being that no one should ever let anyone tell them that they can't do something for whatever reason. That anyone can do anything with courage and determination. I have learned myself in my life that this is absolutely true!

The planes are all based on real-life models (I'd never known there was a twin-engined conversion for Beech Bonanza V-tails), and the flying is usually true-to-life (the railroad tunnel is an exception).  The only disappointment is that it wasn't quite up to Pixar's usual quality (which is why I ""like"" it, rather than ""love"" it).

Although kind of a rehash of the Cars story and similar in ways to the Turbo movie that was released this past year, Planes has its moments and although maybe not as fun for Adults is a great fun time for kids. The plot is something we have seen before with Dusty as a typical fish out of water with big dreams whose fatal flaw is an inconvenient fear of extreme heights and the movie depicting the the ups and downs of Dusty as he has to deal with his devious foes, a girl plane he has a crush on, low fuel, bad weather and mechanical difficulties. And like Cars, he has a crew of sidekicks including slow-witted fuel truck Chug (Brad Garrett), no-nonsense mechanic Dottie (Teri Hatcher) and Skipper Riley (Stacy Keach), a Navy Corsair who flew in World War II. Although some of the characters are a bit stereo-typical, there are some funny moments, especially with El Chupacabra's attempts to woo his French competitor.

Even with this not being terribly original, youngsters especially under 10 or so will love this movie and find it entertaining and has a decent lesson for kids to learn as well.",1388880000,,1368,4.48995983935743

Unfortunately, this movie was way to predictable and lacked the magic and excitement of the original cars. My personal feel while watching this movie was like I was watching a cheesy Saturday morning cartoon. The voices were not as enjoyable and fitting as the first Cars, but rather stale and sounded like a cheap puppet show at times.
I give it two stars for the ""few"" smiles it generated and the animation.

The bottom line
This movies story line and graphics could be compared to putting a go-kart engine in a Rolls Royce.

3032733,3,7799144076,"**Some Spoilers** This movie, although it does have its own feel good story about the underdog, a crop duster, Dusty. It is sort of familiar with the way that Cars played out but vice versa.

Instead of Lightning McQueen being from a privileged life with the lights and camera's. Having all the talents and the selfishness until he's humbled by the small town folks of Radiator Springs. Planes tell the story of Dusty, a country boy (plane) trying to live his dream of being one of the fastest planes in the whole world and he day dreams about it a whole lot.

He's not very talented, but does get a little help from a grumpy former veteran. He teaches him some of the in and outs of what it takes to make it. How much speed doesn't factor in it at all, but brains.

Eventually after you get to this point you already know what happens and Planes doesn't sway away from that. My daughter did manage to watch most of it, I wondered if she felt as if she knew what would happen. Don't get me wrong I think any kid at her age will be engaged into the movie. There's great messages in this to never give up, keep going with whatever your dream may be. The plot is very predictable though and which is why I gave it three stars.

I rented this through Amazon and the picture quality was great. Streaming was flawless, words didn't play catch up with the characters. I had a very good experience through Amazon.",1388707200,,1405,4.330798479087452

Personally, I appreciate the use of Val Kilmer and Anthony Edwards as voices of Bravo and Echo. Nice reference to ""Top Gun"".

There isn't a lot of violence but there is one scene that raised a few questions about why planes were being shot down, who was shooting at them and why? I wasn't expecting it at the time so it threw me a little when it came up. It's the scene with the skipper during a WWII sort of mission in a scene from a long time ago. Just an fyi

3032773,1,7799144076,"I normally don't write reviews because I figure that plenty of people share their experiences with movies to where the whole range of opinions are covered but when I saw the rating this film has on Amazon, I felt compelled to do what I could to pull the rating down a little...this film is THAT bad.

Things you need to know before buying this movie:
1 - This was originally going to be a direct to DVD release
2 - This animation was done in India and is a clearly sub-par quality of animation, definitely not Pixar quality
3 - The voice acting is less than stellar.  Animated characters need to be just that - characters - and I felt not one of the voice actors delivered for this film.  I don't know if the problem was the direction the actors received, the lack of voice acting experience for most of them, or just poor dialogue, but it's very much lacking
4 - Dane Cook is the lead character's voice, for those unfamiliar with Dane Cook, the guy is definitely not a tremendous actor and he's even worse as a voice actor.  The best way I can describe it is it sounds like he's just reading the lines aloud and forgetting that he's supposed to be expressing emotion with his voice
5 - My son didn't like it.  Normally a Disney film will grab his attention right away and hold him the entire time, but this film never had him - it simply isn't engaging in any way, poor characters, worse plot, and bad animation
6 - I would NOT buy this film if I had watched it first, I bought it based upon prior experience with Disney films and based on the assumption it was done by Pixar and would be of typical Pixar standard, like the films Wall-E, Brave, Toy Story, Cars, etc.
7 - It's just not good

I'm not going to elaborate on plot or anything like that, all I can say is I was expecting a certain quality of film when I bought this as a Christmas gift for my son simply because it was a Disney movie, then when it started I thought, ""wow, the animation isn't quite as good on this one""; watched a bit more and thought, ""whoever they chose for the lead, he's not very good""; then I noticed my son wasn't watching the movie at all and asked him if he was watching the movie and he asked me to turn it off.  I tried to encourage my son to give it a chance and to watch it but the more the movie went on, the more I was getting irritated that I had paid money for it because it was just so, so bad.  I ended up turning it off and put in Disney's The Princess and the Frog (another Christmas gift) and immediately my son sat down and was watching with full attention - that told me everything I needed to know - Planes is so poor even my 3-year-old son doesn't want to watch it.",1388448000,,2670,4.140926640926641

I had hoped that Disney would keep the Pixar label, but they didn't for this production. While Frozen is an undoubted success, Planes simply does not measure up to either Pixar or classic Disney storytelling.",1388448000,,413,5.257575757575758

Same theme as the movie Cars, such as racing ethics and dealing with competition, a romance here or there, older version teaching  a newer version. But, no one as catchy as the characters in Cars, just predictable characters who are a bit bland... Disappointing Disney spinoff attempt.

It gave me a different insight to the movie and the amount of work and research that took place to produce a quality product. Now to the movie, the good guy overcomes the bad guy and wins friends along the way. We need more movies like this for our children to watch and learn about fair play and winning isn't everything at any cost. It's a warm movie that helps reinforce what I teach my son everyday, you don't have to be first, just do your best at whatever you do, even if it's digging a hole, make it the best dang hole anyone has ever seen. I liked it and chuckled a few times and will watch it again.",1388361600,,714,4.181159420289855

It's pretty much a classic tale of the underdog triumphing against all odds, and told in a fun way with airplanes obviously related to the ""Cars"" movies.

This is probably the most boring, visually unstimulating, derivative and forced-feeling kids movie I've ever had to watch.  It's way longer than it should be as well, or at least feels like it is.  It feels like a ""straight to DVD"" movie that somebody decided to release on  the big screen hoping to make a quick buck.",1388361600,2,574,4.220183486238532

To be fair he has ADHD...but if a movie is good, it will keep his attention and he'll wait to run around during the credits.",1388361600,,385,3.948717948717949

Now, that initial statement being made, I'll start my finish by saying I don't recommend it for adults, either.  Why?  Well, it's pretty childish.  ;-)  lol, no, seriously...  I found minimal growth in the characters, minimal challenge.  I appreciated the WWII reference, it was done with respect.  But Dusty seemed like the same fellow at the end that he was at the beginning.  I will add that I found it interesting to watch others change around him because of his good example.
I bought this without watching it first, expecting it to be a lot more like Cars (either 1 or 2).  The same cute-ish concept of sentient machines was present, but at no point was I actually excited or drawn in to the story line.  It was sort of like opening a soda only to find that it's gone flat.
For those of you who disagree with me, that's fine.  I'm glad you enjoyed it.  For those of you who haven't seen it/are trying to decide whether or not to buy it, I've reviewed a few movies on Amazon.

I got this as a gift for Christmas and thoroughly enjoyed it.
There's a little bit of everything that makes it such fun to watch.
There's the  overachiever dreaming of breaking through to his next goal.
There's skipper who can't get over a bad memory.
There's the braggadocio player who'll go to any lengths to cover his smallness.
There's the lover boy and his conquests.
Through it all there's some real nice flying sequences and great graphics.
The creators wanted to make the flying sequences as believable as possible and I believe they did it.
Even the sequence on the flysinower were just as nice a the rest.
I'll be watching this again and will enjoy discovering some detail I missed befor.

3032875,4,7799144076,"To be honest as much as a fan of AVIATION as I am, I wasn't exactly thrilled at Lattimer's latest offering.

This was mainly due to the fact that my Family and I enjoyed the Cars movies, both of them, and frankly I viewed Planes as ""Cars with wings and props.""

To be honest: that's what it is.

That doesn't devalue the movie because the main theme is still present.  As often as we have seen it, the idea that you can be more and that one should attempt to fulfill their Dream(s) is the main point.  That the protagonist has a good, healthy, cast of supportive friends ""along the way"" is at this point Par for Pixar stories.

NOT a bad story/ movie, just could have been more...",1388188800,,680,4.232558139534884
3032876,1,7799144076,"Forgettable characters and a mish-mash of a plot ruin what could have been a decent story set in the 'Cars' world.

Technically the movie is fine, Pixar never lowers those standards. But while every character in Cars had their own personality and stayed true to that, in Planes you find a character against the hero becoming a racer, and then 10 minutes later rebuilding hom to race.

The plot elements made almost no sense, and many seemed tacked on to satisfy studio 'notes' about elements they wanted in the movie.

Anytime Lassiter is not in charge of a Pixar film, you pretty much know that the studio hacks will ruin it. He's seems to be the only one with enough clout to overrule their meddling.

In short... Don't bother. Watch Cars 2 instead, since even that is better than this disaster.",1388188800,,797,4.631205673758865

""Planes"" uses the device of a round-the-world race to set up some great, if sometimes too brief, fantasy flying sequences (with maybe a few shots inspired by Ron Fricke's ""Baraka""/""Samsara""?), and the plot surprised me at times.  The script could have used a little more polishing, the character of Dusty was a complete cipher to me, and things sometimes came a little to easy to him: even in a world of talking aircraft, turning a crop duster into a racer by tightening a set screw on the engine and giving it a pep talk seemed a bit much.

Mentored by an old fighter pilot he converts his disadvantages into advantages and is kind and considerate to competitors along the way.

A few of those issues and topics are deception, mind over matter, overcoming fears, etc.  The scenes where Dusty is racing and particularly the one where he crashes into the ocean are quite thrilling.

The planes in the international race are from different countries, and ethnic stereotypes are touched upon, so just be aware of that.  You may want to decide how to talk to your child about it ahead of time.  The most overt reference is probably when British Bulldog declares, ""I don't cry!  I'm British!""  The rest is more subtle.  My son loves all things ""Planes,"" and we have a lot of the toys.  I personally wasn't troubled by the stereotypes, but someone else may be.

That said, not knowing that when I saw this, I commented afterward that Pixar had lost it, and that I was horribly disappointed by this piece of mediocre tripe.

Yes, yes, I know it's a kids' movie.  But, believing Planes to be a Pixar film, I expected a multi-layered movie with smart dialogue to engage even adult viewers, and this was certainly not that. Even with its being a non-Pixar Disney movie, I would have expected more.

Planes could have gone the same way but lands on its nose in front of the aviation crowd. A Corvette can be the fastest thing on the race track but a crop duster for sure can't blast by a flight of F14's.... Or an unlimited Reno race Mustang. Then there are the propellers... Delightful aircraft likenesses but then the producers seemed to have a ""Propeller"" department staffed by artists who never quite learned how the darned things worked. A Mustang taxis by- I swear the prop is turning backwards. Another race plane has twin props on it's nose. They're supposed to rotate in opposite directions. They don't. Dusty gets a spiffy new 4-bladed propeller during his phoenix-like rebuild. You have to notice the blades are angled in opposite directions, canceling each other out. Who let this stuff slip by?

Cars had it right. Planes could have worked the same magic but has its wings clipped by an animation staff who seem never to have looked at a real one. Their loss.....And ours.",1387929600,,1226,4.645161290322581

Was disappointed by certain overlaps with Cars, the tow/fuel truck, Ford Mustang commentator (only one commentator not three to save money?). Didn't like the African American voice chosen for the Air Races organizer, as if the Reno Air Races are popular with the ghetto speaking brothers? Seemed more of a gratuitous way to include a cliche sassy black characture as not to leave out any audience demographic. Aargh, was distracting to the narrative for me.

You could tell this was the Formula Film to beat all formula films. Make 'me as fast as you can eh Disney? Money saved at every turn with this film (only 50 million budget). A total sellout to the Pixar's ""Cars"" franchise, super quick buck made, move on. It was directed and written by inexpensive television peeps who had never helmed a feature film before. Same as with ""Brave"", and the results show.

The screenplay was also close to the original Cars movie, which seemed a missed opportunity. And as everyone knows, this screenplay was predictable beyond belief.

So glad they kept the Pixar name off this piece. But John? Lasseter? Booby? As executive producer and head of story I've grown to expect more from you. Yikes. I guess not everything can be ""Tangled"".",1387929600,,1337,4.928888888888889

3032962,3,7799144076,"Let me start my review with a few facts. Planes is the first installment of DisneyToon Studios (not Pixars) planned trilogy. The action comedy animation was originally to be released as a direct-to-video, but was theatrically released in 2013 worldwide.

Well, in short, the studio has expanded the universe of Cars and made a film about talking airplanes. The simple story is about Dusty Crophopper, a crop duster afraid of heights, who is dreaming of winning a prestigious around-the-world flying race.

The story is predictable and characters clichd, but the flying sequences are dynamic and visually appealing, though not the best of its kind. The film has a few thrilling action set-pieces that could have been much better with more time and details (or budget). The entire film feels rushed and by the numbers.

Planes is a decent animation film, but if you are looking for originality, you should try elsewhere.",1387670400,,918,5.066225165562914

He desires to fly around the world and win a contest. The inevitable outcome belies a neat story that you could suceed without being singularly indifferent to others in the race which in itself could be an analogy to life.

3033015,4,7799144076,"To start off I would have given Planes a 5-star as a great new spin on the Car's world and theory of movie, however, I wasn't a fan of how the movie ended. Also, be warned there will be spoilers in this review so if you hate that don't read it.

I loved the way this movie started, how we got to see him fighting for his dream long before we even jumped into the movie. It wasn't a movie about training to be good, it was a movie about giving your all. He didn't luck into fame like others in movies that meant to be ""inspirational"", he fought for it.

I did see the story-line with his trainer, a plan that only had one main flight. I didn't see him coming to the rescue in the fashion that he did. I give them snaps for surprising me on that.

I wasn't a fan of how hard the male villain went to try and kill the main hero. In cars he only made one attempt and it wasn't huge. This evil plan was the definition of evil and sneaky, hands down.

At the end, and this is the spoiler, I didn't like that he over came his fear of heights and that was his real reason for victory. He came so close to winning without overcoming that fear 100%, even with everything that he went through along the way. I felt like he either should have lost, but had a moral victory like in Cars 1, or that he should have won without having to fly high into the sky. I knew that this was the ending that was coming, but I feel I would have felt more inspired and like he was more of a success if he had done it his way 100% and not like all the other planes did it.",1387238400,,1543,3.9044585987261144

Candidly, it reminded me of the vintage Aladdin ... plenty of good content for kids, AND the parents would love it too!  There's still Larry the Cable guy doing his thing ... and lessons from an aged plane, yet most significantly, PLANES offered another object lesson.

This is a good movie for children of all ages.  There are a couple ""scary"" parts, but they are situational (not frightening as much as suspense).  Watched is three times during the rental period!",1387152000,,573,4.747474747474747

As a mother who loves kids movies and finds a lot of them not good for younger kids (under 5), this movie was great!  Simple if you and/or your kids love the Cars movie they will love this one good simple kids movie with a good message and not too much violence or potty humor.  I am not a hater of violence and potty humor in the right place but it seems that is all a lot of movies have going for them lately and it really gets old... especially when your child repeats it over and over again.",1387065600,,632,3.992063492063492

3033101,4,7799144076,"I walked into this movie knowing full well what I was getting into. A direct-to-video film promoted to the big screen that was produced by Disney (not Pixar) capitalizing on the success of Cars. While it is by far not a prefect film, or even a great film, it hits enough of the right marks to make it a worthwhile show to watch with my son. There may not be enough to keep all of the adults entertained, but it's a far cry from lots of the mindless kid's films that always pop up.

The story is about a crop duster with aspirations to race in a highly coveted world marathon and with the help of an old veteran and his mechanic friend he gets his shot. Even though the writers of Planes were trying to not to remake Cars the similarities are there. The race theme in of itself is undeniably familiar. Then add to that the main villain being a competitor in the same race like in Cars and our hero getting advice from a plane many years his elder sounds a lot like the McQueen/Doc Hudson relationship. While these similarities are more just on the surface (and Cars really went beyond this theme for most of the film) they are indeed there.

As I said before this movie was produced by Disney, and not Pixar. While Cars director John Lasseter is the executive producer that's about the only connection aside from the setting. This shows in the writing. While the movie has heart and the story moves at a decent pace the level of quality is indeed a few notches lower. For one the story pushes that tired old comedy relief character Disney can't help but put in all of their movies. While Cars had Mater that character actually contributed to the story and emotional payoff. In Planes their comic relief is in El Chupacabra. Although there are two scenes where this character lends something to the scenery, if you take him completely out of the film you would hardly miss a step. And worse of all he's not really funny. Actually the entire film isn't really all that funny. Don't expect a lot of chuckles.

I feel that there is a lot more one and two dimensional characterizations on this film, and makes the world feel rather thin. A lot of the playful backdrops found in Cars are gone. The bad guys are just plain bad and there are some substandard caricatures being played as well. The animation is pretty good, but  not Pixar good. The planes and some backdrops seems to have more attention to detail, but then you will look at a forklift talking or some other animation and you can tell not a lot of effort was put into it. I get that this was supposed to be a straight to video affair, and in that arena I would be impressed. However you move it to the big screen then a company like Disney should know better and spend more time on it.

So that was the bad stuff. What about the good? Like I said the story may be simple, but there is a decent amount of heart. Disney did have the good sense to tone down the cliches' that plague Disney animated films over the decades. While the movie is not funny it is fun. There is some real plot progression going on even if it's on a basic level. There are a lot of children's films that are just plain stupid. They are written stupidly with the expectation that the viewers are too young to understand (Disney is just a guilty of this as other productions). Planes  doesn't go down to that level. It gives the young audience the respect deserved and the older audience enough to pass it as ""not stupid"". I think the movie gets a hard time because it is performing under the shadow of Cars, which is a far superior production. Take that out of the equation and you will set your sights more realistic.

So the movie is good enough. What about the disk? The Blu-Ray transfer is spot on and looks great. It's not a reference disc, but it is clear and crisp with some high definition eye candy to enjoy here and there. The surround audio doesn't completely envelop you, but you do enjoy a fair amount of atmospheric effects. The Blu-Ray movie looks and sounds fine, but the extras and special features make me feeling like I'm being short changed. Here are the features as they stand:

Exclusive Musical Scene: Franz's Song - This is a deleted scene that has been fully produced. It's cute and short. A little Disney-ish so no loss it not being on the finished product.

Klay's Flight Plan - This is the best feature by far. It is less a making of documentary and more like a personal commentary from the director on his love for airplanes and the appreciation he had for the content. There is a little bit of information on the making of the film, but it's mostly a love letter to the awesome machines.

Deleted Scenes - Two in fact. One is only in story board mode and is part of Dusty's training. The other pre-visual animation at the Taj Mahal.

Meet the Racers - Mini cartons of a few of the main plane characters. El Cu and Ripslinger's play like a commercial. Dusty's is like a Pixar short-short and Ishani is a music video styled short. There are very brief.

Top 10 Fliers - A rather messy educational video listing 10 historic pilots. Can't really see any rhyme or reason to how they organize this list, but at least it tries to teach something.

Info - This special features is simply the disclaimer notes about the commentaries (that don't exist) that you see before the film. Yes. This is listed as a special feature on the disk. Don't ask me why.

I would have liked to have seen a real behind the scenes featurette with interviews with staff and shots of the voice actors in action, but that is not to be.

Planes is not a bad film. It entertains the kids well enough while not insulting them, and there should be enough to at least keep most adults from falling asleep. All things considered it's better than expected. Maybe for most of you it may be best to wait and see if the price goes down. However if you have kids that saw it in the theaters and they enjoyed it there should be no reason not to let them enjoy it now.",1386633600,,5982,4.366906474820144

Critics make a big deal that it's the same as ""Cars"" but for planes, and I disagree. This one is about an underdog, this one is not tying-up the lead's role so much with a love interest (although that is secondary). This one is far more from the perspective of the individual conquering his own internal challenges. Yes, there are secondary characters that are cut-out from ones in ""Cars."" What I am not hearing from critics is that this is closer to a storyline that takes us on the road for an adventure. I think the geography lesson, alone, is worth it for kids (geography is such a weak subject area for young people.) This one is far more about not allowing oneself to be stuck in a stereotype. Its about taking risks, even when that means we need to face what scares us most.

3033129,4,7799144076,"""Planes"" Takes ""Cars"" Franchise into the Sky on Blu-ray

If you have a franchise that people love and you know it, there's only one thing to do. Exploit it by coming up with ways to expand on the concept to maximize the amount of money you can make from it. Disney took its ""Cars"" series into the sky with the Pixar-less ""Planes"" and instead of soaring high, the movie coasted along the lower atmosphere. With its release on Blu-ray and DVD, the film gets another chance to charm families in the comfort of their own homes.

A crop-dusting plane named Rusty (Dane Cook) dreams of being a racer. There's only one problem with this: he's afraid of heights. A veteran fighter named Skipper takes Dusty under his wing and trains him to enter a prestigious race. Dusty's determination to participate in the event inspires his competitors to either love or hate him, leaving the outcome of the contest a mystery.

""Planes"" is presented in 1080p high-resolution at its original aspect ratio of 1.78:1. The picture is clean and the color palette makes each character and its surroundings pop out of the screen at you. Would we expect any less from the ever-resourceful Disney studios?

The DTS-HD Master Audio 7.1 sound for ""Planes"" puts home viewers right in the middle of all the action. You'll be flying high on cloud nine as the sonic blasts of racing planes and the energetic soundtrack blend together to thrill the senses. Coupled with the exceptional animation, the stunning audio quality will complete a phenomenal family experience.

The ""Planes"" Blu-ray comes with a few special features. It contains deleted scenes, one of which is a completed musical scene. There's also making-of and ""Meet the Racers"" featurettes. An educational featurette which counts down the top 10 real-life fliers rounds out the bonus material.

Those expecting Pixar animation quality from ""Planes"" will no doubt be disappointed. It doesn't have the same essence and depth audiences have come to expect from the studio that brought us ""Cars,"" ""Toy Story,"" and ""The Incredibles."" However, it will please the target demographic it was designed to. Parents might be disappointed in its presentation, but children won't notice the difference as they're captivated by the excitement on the screen.",1386374400,,2271,5.010610079575597

3033139,2,7799144076,"Warning: some spoilers follow, but are necessary to explain my review.

This movie seems to have a very narrow age range in mind: kids aged between seven and ten years old.  Kids aged under about six years old will not understand much of this movie, which has a complicated plot and lots of it uses concepts they won't understand (sabotage, commercial sponsorship, running out of fuel over the ocean, Dusty's mentor lying to him until he discovers the truth, two henchmen planes that harass Dusty).  There is also a few scary scenes: when a Navy fighter squadron of talking planes dives on warships and gets completely blown out of the sky and when Rusty flies through an open-ocean storm wave and cripples his propeller before apparently drowning in the dark.  Kids older than ten will become bored, because of the attempt to convey too many sub-plots.  I was also slightly offended by the El Chupacabra character with his strong stereotypes of Mexican wrestlers (""I swish my cape at you Now you are shamed"") and his romancing of one of female ""exotic"" planes.

On the plus side, the plane designs are charming and I'm sure the toys will sell well.",1386374400,,1149,4.748743718592965

My nephews got bored within minutes while they can watch Cars over and over again and still get excited each time. I can't even get them to finish this movie.
I love Disney and I love Pixar, but this movie was boring and it seemed like the animation team did great, but the story/acting sucked.  Dane Cook was a bad choice for the main character, Fluffy wasn't able to be as funny as he normally is since this was for kids, and the others were people I'd never heard of, nor did I like their voice acting. Teri Hatcher did a good job with what they gave her though.
The writing got complicated; I sat there thinking, do they expect kids to understand this? Or do they think kids aren't listening to the words? At one point Teri's character makes an automotive (?) joke that even the other characters in the movie didn't get; there was alot of plane lingo as well as alot of science. Not much humor. I was bored and had to make myself finish it because I was hoping it would get better. It didn't.
I predicted the ending after the first few minutes; unlike other Pixar films (and even some Disney films), there was no major plot twist. There was a minor one that was quickly resolved.

3033173,4,7799144076,"""The world of 'Cars' takes flight in 'Planes'"", proclaims the blurb on the cover of Disney's new Pixar-like animated feature. We could only wish. Pixar produced films with superior technical qualities, but was best known for finely crafted stories that appealed to young and old alike. Planes displays great computer animation, but has a hit-and-miss story that appeals to children while leaving adults largely out of the fun.

The story revolves around Dusty, a crop dusting plane who wants to be an air racer, and he gets his chance to compete in a round-the-world race against champions from many nations. This allows for not only slightly exotic character development, but for great displays of scenery as well. The settings are familiar from Cars, (a rural backwater community, inhabited by rubes and relics), as are the sidekicks (numerous small forklifts as workers, a not-so-bright truck as a friend, and an experienced old timer as a mentor). There is one sly reference to the tractor-tipping scene in Cars, as Dusty the crop duster is sightseeing in India. He comments on the many tractors wandering the landscape below, and his Indian companion says ""they are sacred in our country"".

Although lacking the subtlety and storyline depth of Pixar's best, the three and four year-olds I watched this film with thought it was fascinating. It was colorful, fast moving, and flew literally around the world with plenty of moments of beauty and peril that kept the kids on the edge of their seats.

3033178,3,7799144076,"The creators of Disneys Cars took to the air this past summer with Disneys Planes. While Cars is heavy on sentiment and story line, Planes soars with action and fun. The movie wastes no time getting into the action as it opens with the eye-popping race sequence.

Theres no time for your kids attentions to drift with this one. In no time Dusty Crophopper goes from daydreaming Midwesterner to headline-grabbing aerial racer. Where the movie lacks in overall humor it makes up for in high-intensity action and fast-paced storytelling.

Storyline
From above the world of Cars comes Disneys Planes, an action-packed 3D animated comedy adventure featuring Dusty (voice of Dane Cook), a plane with dreams of competing as a high-flying air racer. But Dustys not exactly built for racingand he happens to be afraid of heights. So he turns to a seasoned naval aviator who helps Dusty qualify to take the defending champ of the race circuit. Dustys courage is put to the ultimate test as he aims to reach heights he never dreamed possible, giving a spellbound world the inspiration to soar.

Overall
Disneys Planes, like its predecessors, has some positive underlying themes. Your kids will learn about teamwork, overcoming your fears, not settling for less than your best and putting others above your own pursuits. There are a few phrases that you might find mildly objectionable, but I think theyll go over most kids heads.",1385942400,,1418,4.974683544303797

3033189,3,7799144076,"High above the world of Cars comes a low-altitude spin-off that never quite takes off. That's right, three aviation puns in one sentence. And if that has you rolling your eyes, brace yourself for director Klay Hall's Planes, a well-intentioned family-friendly racer sure to entertain younger kids, and just the kids. There's nothing particularly terrible about the film, and it's certainly not as bad as you've probably heard. Still, the animation lacks the fresh coat of paint typical of most theatrically released CG-animated spectacles, Jeffrey M. Howard's screenplay relies heavily on familiar clich after familiar clich and, sorry to say, the voice cast isn't all that special. Not so surprising considering the pseudo-sequel began its life as a DisneyToon Studios direct-to-video project and was only later promoted to feature film status at the last minute. And yet Planes remains a decidedly direct-to-video adventure, with Hall and company distilling elements of Cars and Cars 2 into a cute, harmless, ultimately unremarkable underdog story most parents have sat through a hundred times before.
When a crop duster with big dreams named Dusty (Dane Cook) defies all odds and narrowly qualifies for the globe-spanning Wings Across the World race, he finds himself jetting from New York to Iceland, Germany, India, Nepal, Shanghai, Mexico and back across the United States. To win, he'll have to out-maneuver and outrace an array of international fliers, including mean-spirited reigning champ, Ripslinger (Roger Craig Smith), and his toadies, Ned and Zed (Gabriel Iglesias); French-Canadian racer, Rochelle (Julia Louis-Dreyfus); stuffy Brit, Bulldog (John Cleese); passionate Mexican Gee Bee, El Chupacabra (Carols Alazraqui); and Indian love interest Ishani (Priyanka Chopra). And it'll take everything Dusty's got, along with a little help from his friends: best friend Chug (Brad Garrett), mechanic Dottie (Teri Hatcher), reluctant mentor Skipper Riley (Stacey Keach), forklift Sparky (Danny Mann), Super Hornet duo Bravo and Echo (Top Gun alumni Val Kilmer and Anthony Edwards), and others who rally behind the crop-dusting upstart.

Despite Hall and Howard's best efforts -- and the two do make a concerted effort -- there's not a lot to Planes that isn't derived from the series' core films. From the quaint but sharply penned Cars comes the clash of vehicular cultures and destinies, the racing scene, a fish out of water adventure, a romantic subplot, a crusty old racing mentor haunted by his past, a cocky rival desperate to win at all costs (he's even green and black, just like ol' Chick Hicks), several sidekicks in the making, and, of course, a glimpse into the eerie but amusing world of sentient cars with no human masters. (Why is Dusty dusting crops exactly? Other than the fact that he's a crop duster?) From the maligned Cars 2 comes the international hotspots, a colorful cast of multinational racers (each one showcasing a bigger stereotype than the last), the thrills and chills of a worldwide race mixed with... you get the idea. Planes is at its finest when imagining how a society of planes would function in the larger Cars world, and when humanizing its aeros and autos. But sparks of imagination don't seem to come as freely or frequently as before, and Dustys rise to fame is far more derivative than it is original.

Ironically, had Planes never dared to dream more than a direct-to-video dream, it would have been more successful. The film struggles to inflate itself to theatrical proportions, reaching for the stars and barely lifting off the ground. There are laughs to be had, an exciting but predictable race to follow, and enough lovable personalities -- yes, even Cook's Dusty -- to keep the movie in the air. It rarely soars, though, and even at its best, tends to skim the surface of its potential. Adults would do well to watch the disc's behind-the-scenes featurette, ""Klay's Flight Plan"", and only then giving Planes a go. Realizing how much of the film a personal passion project was for Hall makes for a richer experience. The story still only skims the surface, but the heart it proudly wears on its wings suddenly begins to shine that much brighter. Kids, on the other hand, needn't invest any prep time. Planes will strike anyone under ten as a fun, wondrous race across the skies of one of their favorite animated universes; one with a few life lessons worth reinforcing. As family entertainment geared for the grade school set goes, it excels. As a Pixar spin-off, though, it lacks a certain level of magic, wit and refinement.

Disney's Planes looks great on Blu-ray, with a pristine 1080p/AVC-encoded presentation. Colors are bright, vibrant and playful, and bathed in convincing light and shadow. Primaries are strong and black levels inky, with consistent contrast and unhindered clarity. Detail is quite striking, with crisp edges and exacting textures, and aliasing isn't a concern. Perhaps more thrilling is Planes' DTS-HD Master Audio 7.1 surround track, even if the film's original sound design isn't really all that engrossing. Dialogue is crystal clear and perfectly prioritized, without anything in the way of muffled or buried lines. Voices tend to float in the mix, but no more so than in most animated films. LFE output, meanwhile, embraces every engine chug and roar, propeller drone, and dive-bomb attack, making the most of the adventure's every racing sequence.

Planes would have been better off abandoning the racing scene of the first two Cars movies and focusing instead on something new to the series' universe. Private and commercial aviation, the Air Force, the daring rescue work glimpsed in the trailer for next years Planes: Fire & Rescue... just a few of the tantalizing possibilities that would have set Hall's spin-off free. Not that kids will care. Younger children will have a blast, if only because they won't notice just how much Planes begs, borrows and lifts from a hundred other underdog stories. Disney's Blu-ray release is more satisfying, fortunately, with an excellent video presentation and involving DTS-HD Master Audio 7.1 surround track. Its supplemental package is much too direct-to-video for a film that earned a theatrical release, but complaints end there. Bottom line? You could do a whole lot worse this holiday season. Planes is perfect for the kiddies, even if it will prove somewhat disappointing for parents.",1385942400,3,6425,5.175

3033195,5,7799144076,"Though in many ways this had a similar story line to the first Cars movie (rookie desires to win the big race), it still feels fresh.  Dusty Crophopper desires to be more than what his original purpose was.  He wishes to enter an around-the-world race that usually is reserved for planes that are built for racing.  When he manages to make the cut, he has to deal with the prejudices of being a ""farm boy.""  Aside from the challenges he faces from the difficult race and his fear of heights (imagine a plane afraid of heights), he also has to put up with the dirty trickery from other racers who don't play fair.  However, he has old and new friends helping him out:  the grounded Skipper (a war hero who suffers post traumatic stress), Dusty's best friend Chug (forgetful and big-mouthed), the nerdy girl whose name I've forgotten but is just as endearing, and the Spanish plane whose name I've also forgotten.  The characters are memorable...the names aren't.

In many ways, I like this story better than Cars.  It is more exciting and adventurous, since it shows the various obstacles Dusty has to face traveling around the world.  Dusty is a much more likable character than Lightening McQueen was.  The film actually promotes many good morals:  doing it anyway despite what anyone tells you and no matter how great the odds, always be a good guy (it does pay in the end), among others.",1385856000,3,1390,4.651639344262295

It uses much of the original Cars plot lines and character development to tell a similar story.

When viewing animated features, I base my opinion on whether or not the voice actors brought excitement and range to their characters. This film was awful in that department. The only characters with any sort of inflection and emotion in their voices was Chug (Brad Garrett) and El Chupacabra (Carlos Alazraqui). Everyone else was flat and uninspired.

A real family story projecting the importance of humans, friendship and love as truly more valuable and long-lasting than the so empty, short lived pleasures of fame and fortune.  Cars 2 was expected to be less than Cars 1 - and it was, but it got away with a good old fashioned 007 plot, with plenty of intrigue well developed until the end when we find out who the bad guy really is - not as in depth in meaning as the first, but we survive because - the ever famous American addiction - it's interesting and funny.  In planes, however, nothing is new.  Nothing needs to be discovered - honestly, the story line was just really void of depth, reminded me of one of the 1/2 hour cartoons on kids tv.  Kids will like it, but like ever so much of food these days, the story seemed a bit full of corn syrup and additives with just enough nutrition to convince a body it might be food.....  Like candy or ramen noodle soup, a bit won't kill us and can fill a bit, but we need more meat and potatoes.",1385683200,,1270,4.374468085106383
3033204,2,7799144076,"We were so disappointed with this movie :(  Everything about this story was contrived and unoriginal. My 2 year old who is enthralled with anything that 'goes', and LOVES Mater Tall Tales and enjoys cars left the room after the first 30 mins. My 6 year-old (who usually begs me to buy every movie we rent) and 3.5 year old were not very impressed either, but at least watched the whole thing. Mad at myself for not following my rule to always rent first. Silly me assumed it would be at least approaching the quality of a Disney Pixar movie.
I highly recommend renting this one before buying.
(Small side note, as an adult who has watched several Dane Cook movies, I just couldn't reconcile Dane's voice as the kind and moral hero in a children's movie. Also didn't enjoy several adult aimed jokes that were borderline inappropriate, and really disliked a scene where Dusty lands at one of the stops at what appears to be a bar and the barmaid says something along the lines of ""You are sad. Drink."" Seriously? What kind of values are they promoting there. Soooo disappointed :( )",1385683200,,1080,4.56701030927835

But this is without a doubt the worst Pixar flick to date. It has an almost identical look and storyline as did ""Cars"". There is nothing unique about this movie - and that's very unfortunate.  In my opinion, Pixar movies have been going downhill for a while. I wish I could send this back with a letter to the director asking him what the heck is up with this!

3033208,4,7799144076,"I always have a hard time reviewing Blu-rays. It's hard to draw the line between reviewing a movie and reviewing the disc itself. Because the discs all work great, the case looks the same as every other Disney Blu-ray case (which is a good thing, they are always high quality), and the movie makes for great 3D reference material on my 3D TV and 3D projector.

But when you analyze the movie itself, it is quite disappointing. It's hard to believe the non-Pixar-labeled Disney movies like Tangled and Wreck-It Ralph can turn out so good, but then this spinoff of Pixar's great Cars world turned out so poor. Simply put, the story is as generic and predictable as you can get, and the characters are poorly developed and highly forgettable. The humor is geared to children instead of to everyone, which is why I usually love Pixar movies. They really should have waited on this film until they good get the talent of the actual Pixar studio to be more involved.

when other movies played on these devices the same there was no issue. I did do a power cycle of my players and the modem as outlined in the help section. This had no impact.

3033251,4,7799144076,"Before I begin my review I want to point out that Amazon has a policy of grouping ALL reviews of ALL formats of a film together so it is important to do the following when using Amazon reviews of films: Take note as to whether the reviewer is reviewing the theater release (you can sort reviews by newest first) the DVD or the Bluray. That is always the best guide. With that said, here is my review of the BLURAY.

PLANES is  for all intents and purposes  an aerial version of the two CARS films. In fact there is a preview of the Planes sequel (direct to DVD) on this set. PLANES was probably aimed at the Direct-to-DVD market originally but they added 3-D and were able to market it to those theaters as well.

As to the  91-minute film itself, there are enough reviews here to guide you (as for me, it was basically the same old story about finding you future success). Ill discuss the BD and bonuses.

First the BD looks great! Wonderful images and sound.

The bonuses include:
A deleted song (with live introduction by the Director Klay Hall and one of the films producers. This last 3:18.
TWO deleted scenes shown as storyboards  introductions by the two above (8 minutes)
Meet the Flyers  - introduces the characters (1:17)
Top Ten Flyers  a 5-minute piece  done as a sports show acknowledging those such as Howard Hughes, Jimmy Doolittle and (honorably) the Tuskegee Airmen.
Klays Flight Plan a 15 minute piece showing the direct taking his 2 teenage sons to see famous antique planes and taking rides in them. After watching this, youll know exactly why John Rassiter chose Hall to direct this film.
While, its primarily a kids film there are a lot of jokes that only the adults may get ( I love the Flying for Dummies book, for instance.)

So its not a masterpiece but worth an hour or so to spend with your kids. Hey, maybe theill want to visit your local airport after seeing this.

I hope you found this review both informative and helpful.

The names have changed I think Pixar is now apart of Disney Animation so no Its Pixar but all the people that were there at Pixar are with Disney Animation I think I don't have hard facts just the fact that I saw a photo of PIxar employees with the founders and then saw the same photo for Walt Disney Animation Studios.

About the movie I liked it with all the references to the VF-84 Joly Rodgers (a really good assault wing) the Corsair (an awesome warplane for back in the day) I think I saw I BF-109 in there too. I loved the entire sequence of the Flysienhower ... awesome.

Also noticed they Sinbad (saw him live) Cedric the Entertainer and Gabriel Igleses (hard to pick out didn't sound like himself at times.) Fluffy did good.

Its a movie that would entertain the kids as well as the adults. My only gripe is that story line seems a little familiar with that of a story line involving a racing snail. Not exactly the same but kind of similar. The movie did have its moments (like all movies) at bit predictable here and there but nevertheless still enjoyable.

Other than that I liked it and will be watching it for a third time in less than 24 hours. Its defiantly worth renting. I couldn't recommend you to buy it because I'm still trying to decide that for myself. :)",1385164800,,1384,4.291187739463601

3033281,1,7799144076,"Wow.  I was not impressed with this movie at all!  As a matter of fact, I was bored to death....and totally amazed at how bad this movie was!

Planes seems to parallel cars - yet is not nearly as cute, funny or memorable as Cars.  First of all... it's WAY TOO SERIOUS!!!  This movie is totally lacking any ""silly factor"".  I know, I know...there's no Mater, of course.  But that's the problem.  This movie NEEDS a Mater!

The character in Cars are literally oozing with personality...whereas in Planes, they're not.  They are just cookie-cutter clichs of characters.  I never warmed up to any of them, since they were all totally forgettable.

Plus....the plot?  This movie is just one big race...that's it!  That's it!  There's no warm and cozy Radiator Springs-like story to break up the tedious race sequences.

Tedious.  That's the word I would apply to this movie.  What a terrible word!  I couldn't wait for the movie to end!  Now I have read that some toddlers and younger children enjoyed the movie, which I am very surprised to hear!  I would think they would have all been bored and fidgety - I know my daughter would have been at that age!  Although my daughter is a bit older, she still enjoys a good Disney movie.  However, after watching only a tiny slice of Planes, she lost interest and sought out the computer.

I'm sorry.  I hate to give such a negative review, I really do.  However, these are my honest feelings.  The movie isn't funny, at all.  Okay, maybe you sort of chuckle a few times...but that's it!  As for the characters...I can't even remember any of them, and I just saw the movie last night!

My advice?  Watch on Pay per View first to see if your kids are grabbed by this bland movie.  Who knows?  They might like it - then you can buy it for them.

Unfortunately, this film is for kids, but not all kids. This is definitely, without a doubt, the first stinker out of Pixar, and yes they know it. This thing got pushed through production as more of a buffer/money maker to compensate for the big time money loser films Disney made in this production cycle. This is a real middle finger to the people who have supported Pixar and Disney for so long. They promote this like its a big full blown production when they really knew that this was going to be a direct to DVD budget and quality film. Unlike other Disney/Pixar films, this is not enjoyable to watch for most adults, and a large amount of children. Its just boring and bland. Its like flavorless ice cream, looks good until you taste it, then its just hard to finish. Hugely disappointing, both in quality and substance, and in the way it was presented to us, the audience. The whole thing is just a lie to line their pockets while making us thing this would be another special addition to the Disney/Pixar lineup.

3033299,4,7799144076,"The trailers for this film made me a skeptic but, I watched Planes for the first time from a Redbox rental last night while my kids were in bed and while I was recovering from my root canal, done earlier in the day.  I had so-so likings for Disney's Planes.  I did not like how Dusty was too similar to the Owen Wilson voiced Lightning McQueen character and I did not like how Skipper was too similar to the Paul Newman voiced Doc Hudson character.

Today my 12-year-old son watched Planes with his 9-year-old sister.  The enthusiasm barometer from my kids was way up, while watching Planes, compared to their first viewings of Cars and Cars 2.  I guess all those times I took my kids to the National Museum of the United States Air Force, at Wright Patterson Air Force Base in Dayton, cultivated their aviation enthusiasm and they were ripe for watching Disney's Planes, today.

My son got teary-eyed when Skipper recounted his painful battle experience in War 2.  My son also got teary-eyed when the other racing planes started donating replacement parts to Dusty.

Watching the movie with two kids that were loving it made me enjoy it more.  Then, the DVD's Special Features won my heart over with a section about the great vintage war birds, including the P-51D Mustang.

So, today, I ordered Disney's Planes (Blu-ray/DVD, 2013, 2-Disc Set, Including Digital Copy).

This film and special features cultivates my existing love for aviation.  I would have liked to seen more expensive high-powered actors doing the principal roles in this movie but I respect Disney/Pixar's choice to cut production costs since aviation movies don't do all that great at the box office.  Planes was not a block buster but, it did produce a respectable profit to cost ratio.  It's worth seeing for the first time.  I suggest renting it before deciding to buy it.",1384905600,,1846,4.761006289308176

It works with google play, vudu, and amazon.",1384905600,6,369,4.5606060606060606

You can view it only with an internet connection is the only option as Amazon etc might be the only viewer!! A MESS that is what it is, a MESS!!!!

However, THIS DVD can be unlocked in ITunes which can be viewed on the different Apple products without an Internet connection! It should not matter but I purchased the multidisc version.

If Digital Copy (non-Internet) is a factor as it is in our family, then be careful what you purchase because just because it says Digital Copy, it might mean internet connection only!",1384905600,2,786,4.376712328767123

One scene found in the bonus features, the musical scene of Franz should not have been cut from the final film, it would have added more fun to the overall movie.  My grandchildren and all adults in the family watch the other Pixar movies over and over. Planes does not hold the attention of  the targeted audience as the other Pixar films do and do not see this one as being a favorite among the family.  After all the hype and delays on the release of the movie, very disappointed with the final film.  I hope the additional Planes trilogy improve in the overall movie content.  Cars, and Cars II for instance has been watched so many times in my home by the Grandchildren, we have had to order two additional copies as the DVD's just wore out due to numerous scratches by the children, but had no problem in replacing them as they are enjoyable favorites.  Also do not understand why Pixar cuts the scenes from the final films that are used in the clips advertising the new movies coming out?

3033320,2,7799144076,"My kids really enjoy going to the movies (currently aged 2 - 6) and this year there have been several that they've seen that they have liked.  My boys are huge fans of the Cars movies, and we thought this would be a no-brainer.  Unfortunately, this movie blurs the lines between the consistent Pixar and the likes of the direct to DVD sequels that Disney makes.  What made Planes even more misleading in this area is that a few big names with Pixar are associated with it, making it seem like it was a Pixar movie in all but name.

Unfortunately, Planes really has no reason to exist.  The premise of the movie is great, it's a sky high version of the little train that could.  The world created for it is also a great idea and there is a lot of potential based on the foundations built by the Cars series.  However, the actual script was horrible.  There was no real coherent story.  The characters are unrelatable and it feels like the script writers expected you to already be familiar with them as they are sort of stand-ins for Cars characters (with less charm.)  You might say that I'm expecting too much out of a children's movie.  When I wrote this, I'm actually looking at it from the perspective of my four year old who can go into a trance and would probably be capable of sitting still through a marathon of Cars, Cars 2, and Mater's Tall Tales with no problem.  What I'm saying is that Planes is far below the level of what some people consider to be Pixar's worst movies (I personally like Cars, but recognize that the plot is ""a loving tribute to"" Doc Hollywood.)

The humor really wasn't great, it was full of racial stereotypes if you're against those sorts of things (I didn't think they were too bad, but some folks are more sensitive than I am), and there were only a few off-color moments such as when the main character is basically castrated, although I think they were going more for a waxing-like experience.

So if your kids are Cars fanatics, you should probably watch it once, maybe when it comes on Disney Jr. without you paying extra for it.",1384819200,2,2071,4.444444444444445
3033321,2,7799144076,"This movie would have been good as the visuals were excellent and some of the action was fun to watch, however, the shameless similarities to Cars and the original story line where too much to bear. We have the down and out hero who has to fight to win, the old grumpy character that makes him turn around and be better, the female interest and even the foe are similar characters to Cars. They did nothing original here at all to set this apart from Cars. They didn't even try to do anything different which leads me to believe Disney is nothing without Pixar when these types of films are created. I sat there watching it just waiting for it to ""take off"" (pun intended). It started out too slow and never really got that exciting. If I never saw Cars it might have been a good film but there are too many retreads of other movies out there and this is yet another one. There are much better animated films with more original storylines. I have watched Cars a dozen times with the kids and would easily sit through it again and again before wasting time watching this even a second time.

As I suspected, Reed is much more excited about the movie now that he can watch it like normal without the 3D effects. He has watched it over and over again and it has become his new favorite movie. He is already making a list of all the Planes that he wants for Christmas.

Personally, I was a bit disappointed as I thought that it was too much like Cars, only with Planes. The storyline was so similar that it lacked originality. Its still well made because its Disney and it has its usual array of colorful amazing characters. I just wish the storyline wasn't much like Cars.

So, we decided to chance it and take her to see Planes in the theaters.  She was very hesitant heading into the theater (I think since it was dark) even though we had been playing up the experience for several days.  But once the movie started, she sat forward the entire time and wouldn't stop yelling excitedly (thankfully the theater only had other families with small children and not movie reviewers with a chip on their shoulder).

3033342,4,7799144076,"I didn't have high expectations when I went to see this film. The newspaper reviews were indifferent- a quick ""Cars"" knockoff to keep Disney's cashflow up.

But I was very pleasantly surprised. The story was a bit predictable - ""local boy makes good"", the crusty old codger who eventually warms up and helps the kid and finds personal redemption for the errors of his past, etc- but I'd say it worked pretty well.

I know enough about historical aircraft- and aircraft in general- that I appreciated the different planes that were shown in the movie. Thought there were some really interesting choices- the DH88 for example, voiced by John Cleese, the Corsair, by Stacy Keach, and of course a Gee Bee racer, by Carlos Alazraqui. There were enough 'in-jokes' that I was laughing out loud (but according to the kids, I was the only adult laughing...)

I also remember Dusty and Ishani, flying near the Taj Mahal and observing graceful glider- like birds.... lovely image, clever replacement of animals from the ""Planes"" world to replicate nature.

Had this film come out BEFORE ""Cars"", I can't help but think it would have got a lot of praise for its animation, technical references, and possibly even its plot. Is it a bit too derivative of ""Cars""? Maybe, but ""Cars"" was a difficult film to top- look at the reviews its sequel got.

3033351,2,7799144076,"""Planes"" finds Disney, and John Lasster in particular, revisiting the world of ""Cars"".  Lassiter, one of the masterminds of Pixar, came up with the original concept of ""Cars"" as well as ""Cars 2"".  Essentially, all the cars are anthropomorphic and are characters in their own right.

In terms of critical reception, the ""Cars"" franchise has been the most problematic of the Pixar IPs.  While both critics and audiences alike really enjoyed the original ""Cars"", that picture marked the first time that a Pixar picture garnered less than glowing reviews.  To know where I stand as a reviewer, personally ""Cars"" is one of my personal favorite Pixar films, even though I never really liked Nascar.

""Cars 2"", meanwhile, has been the worst received Pixar flick yet.  Mixing international intrigue (essentially James Bond in a cartoon setting with a redneck tow truck called Mater being the central focus of that particular plotline) with the original racing of the first ""Cars"", most critics and audiences alike felt ""Cars 2"" simply fell flat.

Then we come to ""Planes"", the worst movie yet set in the franchise.  Plagued by a dull, by-rote script, a very predictably storyline, and low quality control, ""Planes"" is a very low flying picture, to put it lightly.  To be fair, DisneyToons produced ""Planes"", which is Disney's direct to DVD division.  Only after seeing some completed sequences did Disney chose to do a theatrical release.  However, you can easily tell this is a direct to DVD film, with all the lower quality control that Direct to DVD implies.

Watching the movie you simply feel that they piecemealed it from the first two pictures, with the best elements stripped away.  ""Planes"" marries the race drama of the first ""Cars"" with the international [mixture] adventure of the second ""Cars"" with characters who are little more than painted caricatures of screen-writing archetypes.

First: the animation.  There are some great sequences (especially those involving the scenic sections of the movie, such as the Taj Mahal and the mountains).  The battle sequence where we learn more of Skipper's character is simply stunning, and on the same level as the Pixar movies.  There is a great uneveness though, where some of the sequences (especially those with lots of cars) are bland and almost appear as unfinished.

You also feel you've already seen these characters before.  For those who found Mater intolerable, the racers from different countries are little more than stereotypical caricatures painted with very broad strokes of cultural insensitivity.  We have a lover-boy Mexican who also is a musican, an uptight British plane, an erotically charged (toned down for a kid movie, obviously) French Canadian who speaks the ""language of love"", and a cheating villian that never rises above mere thug.

Without giving away spoilers, Dusty Crophopper (a crop dusting plane) dreams of being a low-flying racer, and wants to enter a competiton called ""Wings Across the World"".  He enters the qualifying rounds and does not make it, but later is admitted due to one of the qualifiers cheating. Having been trained by Chug (a fuel truck voiced by Brad Garret, AKA Robert Barone from ""Everybody Loves Raymon""), both Dusty and Chug list the at-first hesitant Skipper, a World War II plane who fought various battles with the famed , whose motto is truth first.  However, mysteriously Skipper does not fly himself and hasn't for years.

Once Dusty gets in the race, the movie simply turns into different segments of the race (of which there are seven), with different plot points being checked off.  During the movie, he assists various other planes in the race, and is met also with betrayal.  Due to his assistance with the various other racers, at one point they return the favors, setting Dusty up for the climactic finale.  He learns the reason for Skipper's grounding, and battles for first place with Ripslinger, his main archnemesis in the picture.

While ""Cars"" was a homage to Nascar, the racing was only a small element in that movie.  ""Cars"" largely tapped into (brilliantly, I might add) that Route 66 culture of the 1950s-1970s, before the Interstates came in and travellers lost a lot of the scenic majesty of traveling through the United States and exploring the country that can only be done off the Interstate.  While the racing drama tied into ""Cars"" excellently, you cared more about McQueen and what he learned in his stay in Radatior Springs, as well as all the characters he encounters.  You care more about the outcome of the race because the race wasn't the only driving focus.  Lightening McQueen was egotistical; the citizens of Radiator Springs helped Lightening not only become a better ""car"", but also to appreciate a slower life-style.  The movie is much more about McQueen's growing relationships and growth as a character than it ever was about the race.

Unfortunately, this focus on character growth never seems to take flight in ""Planes"", unlike ""Cars"", which ultimately means the film simply denegrates into spectacle in the racing sequences, following shallow, predictable plotpoints that never really elevate the film into the upper echelon of quality animation, as is the won't of the best of the Pixar/Disney films.

While ""Cars"" used the race as a back drop for deeper story telling, ""Planes"" simply becomes a retreat of all those underdog stories.  Due to the longer running time of ""Cars"", we get to know the characters more.  In ""Planes"", the characters never rise above either ethnic stereotypes or dull characters we've all seen in so many other movies.  Ultimately, you by the end of the film you will probably care more for Skipper than anyone else, but by then it's too most likely too late.  Even Dusty Crophopper changes very little (with one minor exception dealing with his ""low flying"" tendencies"".  Compare Dusty's story arc to McQueen's story arc and Dusty comes away looking much the worst for wear.  We've seen Dusty's story arc so often in so many other movies that he is simply not compelling, and there is so little character evolution within Dusty that the film just falls flat, especially when compared to McQueen.

Ultimatley, ""Planes"" becomes little more than a further ploy for Disney to create merchandise using the ""Cars"" brand.  Its Direct to DVD origins are ""planely""evident for everyone above five year olds to see, and had it stayed direct to dvd this film would not nearly have been as offensive as it is to fans of Pixar and Disney.  Unlike the best of Pixar/Disney, which appeal to young and old alike, only the youngest will find this film truly enjoy.  The rest will find it dull, predictable, and simply far below the mark previously set by ""Cars"" and even ""Cars 2"".",1378684800,8,6745,4.987488829311886

We brought our family gear (chairs, blankets, etc.) and had an amazing spot, loaded up the popcorn, soda, and other must have movie snacks, and waited for the movie to start. When it did, expectations were high, I was ready for fun, for laughter, and even some light hearted excitement. I did not get that feeling in the beginning or the end of the movie. In fact, I did not get to experience any of those feelings in the intensity I thought I would. I love the whole Disney universe today - Pixar makes such amazing movies that are truly moving and unforgettable. As many have probably mentioned in reviews for this movie, it felt a lot like a sloppy version on cars with wings. What I didn't like was that this was another underdog story, that has a cast of characters that was too similar to the Cars Movie. The big difference is that in Cars, Lightning McQueen was already at the top and needed to win the Big race to get his Piston Cup win and new sponsership, but had lessons to learn. In this story, the main plane, Dusty, is essentially running through the same story line in respects to having to win ""the big race"", and having an old geezer mentor (like Doc in the movie Cars) that had a bad experience with flying in the war that brought him into a life a solitude and sourness, blah, blah. It was just too typical and didn't have anything distinguishable that made this movie special. The characters are forgettable, the story is just ok, and the feeling I had when the movie was over was ""that was disappointing"". Every other pixar film I have seen (pretty much all of them), I have bought the movie as soon as it came out for sale on video. This movie, not too sure I will have this in the collection. I would rather take my chances on a rent to see if this movie grows on me after a 2nd viewing. I gave this 3 stars since it still looks good, decent voice-acting and the animation still looks great; it's just that this movie looks pretty on the outside, but no real structure and feeling inside, which is too bad.",1378425600,,2099,4.3164556962025316
3033354,2,7799144076,"Always having been a fan of Disney animated films since I was a child, most of the modern films have set a standard in comedy, characters and above all, story. Even the musicals and the music `within' type films are usually charming, entertaining and often enduring in a way. ""Planes"" takes a more than slight turn in the opposite direction.

The film took a long time to get the characters interesting enough for me to care about them. The story of the underdog and his triumph, not anything new, became extremely predictable in this film. It wasn't until about 's the way I felt slight emotion for the underdog and his friends and the real adventure began.

Directed by Klay Hall (Tinkerbell and the Lost Treasure) and written by Jeffrey M Howard (Tinkerbell, Pixie Hollow Games) from a story from the original genius that made Pixar famous, John Lasseter (Toy Story, Wall*E), ""PLANES opens in a nose dive of a really long drawn out exposition of the underdog Dusty Crophopper voiced by Dane Cook (Mr. Brokks, Dan In Real Life).

Some of the talent includes, the mentor of the film is voiced by Stacey Keach (American History X, The Bourne Legacy) as Skipper. Brad Garrett (Everyone Loves Raymond, Finding Nemo) voices Chug, the longtime companion of Dusty. Teri Hatcher (Lois & Clark, Desperate Housewives) voices Dottie who eventually becomes the love interest in a very unusual twist. Julia Louis-Dreyfus (A Bug's Life, Seinfeld) plays Rochelle and actual female baddie - who turns her heart by the end.

By the way, this is supposed to be an almost crossover world as seen in the Cars movies, but it doesn't have the charm and power of keeping you attention in the beginning. I will admit, the last 20 minutes was touch and heartwarming - but again, it took over an hour to get to that point. Kids were wrestles in the theatre and the adults were walking out - too bad too - the best things were at the end of the film.

Young, young kids should love the color and landscapes, but unfortunately older kids and adult won't find anything interesting until the film is almost over.

3264960,3,7799144076,"FOREWARNING: This review contains spoilers on the plot.

I feel conflicted about this movie. After watching it, I couldn't decide how I feel about it. I didn't think it was amazing, but I didn't dislike it either.

The story is very similar to that of Cars, yet the main character isn't already a famous racer when the movie starts. Instead, it starts with Dusty Crophopper wanting to get away from home and join the Wings Around the World race. Nobody believes he can join because he was built to be a crop duster, not a racer. He also has a fear of heights, something you wouldn't expect from a plane. But with the help of a military veteran named Skipper, a gas truck named Chug, and a mechanic forklift named Dottie, Dusty is trained and gets into the race. The majority of the movie follows the race around the world and how Dusty overcomes some of his fears and steadily begins to climb up in the rankings. However, he faces stiff competition from a three-time champion plane named Ripslinger. Ripslinger begins to get jealous and does everything in his willpower to keep Dusty from winning. Dusty faces some major challenges, but he eventually overcomes his fears and wins the race.

While the story isn't exactly terrible, the similarity to Cars is definitely present. Heck, the setting of Planes is pretty much a fusion of the settings of both Cars movies! The similarities exist even with the characters.

Dusty is very reminiscent of Lightning McQueen. Dusty and McQueen are both racers and both end up learning an important lesson in the end. Dottie is similar to Sally, as both characters are doubtful at first (Dottie about Dusty's racing, Sally about the road getting fixed). Chug is all too similar to Mater in almost every way. Ripslinger is similar to Chuck, in the sense that he is determined to win and he would do anything to achieve that. But, the biggest similarity is between Skipper and Doc Hudson. In fact, Skipper is pretty much a carbon-copy of Doc, only as a plane and not a car. Skipper is a cranky old plane who refuses to assist Dusty, but ends up helping him anyway. Skipper, like Doc, has a rough past, as his profession led him to getting into an accident. This was the most obvious similarity out of the whole movie.

The jokes in this movie aren't very good. The puns are even worse. For example, ""For flying out loud!"" But the worst was the name of the aircraft carrier Dusty lands on to refuel: ""USS Flysinhower."" The stupidity of that name is almost too much to bear. This movie has little emotion, and I found it hard to get attached to any of the characters. The most emotional sequence was the part where Dusty crashes into the ocean, but even as it is, it's nowhere near as emotionally gut-wrenching as the ending to other Disney and Pixar movies.

In the end, though, I didn't entirely hate Planes. It's still a decent movie, but it's too much of a Cars rehash to stand out as a great movie. It's not the worst spinoff I've ever seen, but it's not the best either. In the end, Planes is a decent movie...it will entertain the young kids, but it will most likely disappoint older viewers. I give it 3 out of 5 stars.",1376611200,25,3160,4.54481546572935
3264961,1,7799144076,"Disney's production company, Pixar, has found a great deal of success with their popular Cars franchise, combining for more than $1 billion worldwide. It has featured the voices of some of Hollywood's finest and funniest, including Owen Wilson, Larry the Cable Guy, and Michael Caine.  Following two successful animated features, Cars and Cars 2, the franchise has also spawned spin-off television programs, video games, and even theme park attractions.  Like most things associated with Disney, the merchandise possibilities are endless for animated features and with the addition of more vehicles - so is the direction of the franchise.  Now, the Cars franchise has expanded its potential by adding Planes - a Cars spin-off that focuses on animated planes as the main characters.

Klay Hall (Tinker Bell and the Lost Treasure) directs the Cars spin-off, Planes, starring the voice of Dane Cook as Dusty Crophopper, a crop dusting airplane that tries out for the Wings Across the World race.  In order to win the race, planes are required to be fast and agile - and able to work through an obstacle course at high speeds.  However, even though Dusty is fast, he's not fast enough and must enlist the help of a former war veteran, Skipper Riley (Stacy Keach), to mentor and prepare him for the big race.  The voices of Teri Hatcher, Brad Garrett, Roger Craig Smith, and Julia Louise-Dreyfus also star in supporting roles.

The idea of animated cars only seemed logical, especially since bugs, toys, and anything else you can imagine is receiving the animation treatment.  With that rational, the next logical step was to expand the cars universe by adding planes to the mix.  And, after watching Planes, you'd assume future films will include trains, boats, or bikes.  Like I said, the future is endless.  But, before we get that far ahead, the focus is on Planes, which is essentially the same exact thing as the Cars films - only in plane form.  The Cars films are about racing, and Planes is about racing, too.  So, if you were to combine the elements of the first two Cars films and set it in the air, then that would make Planes a completely recycle story - which it is.

Even from the debut of its first trailer, Planes looked like it had the potential to run out of gas even before it made its way off the runway.  Sure enough, Planes looks and smells like every generic animated film out there these days, incorporating the same old underdog elements and sideline cheerleaders.  On top of the constant clichs is the fact that animation films focusing on the premise of racing are simply getting old.  Cars and its sequel focused on speed, not to mention Turbo - so it might be a stretch to imagine a Planes sequel focusing on a similar theme of the same generic story.  It's certainly time for them to think outside the box and come up with something a little more hip and entertaining.

The supporting cast this time around includes forklifts and airplanes with different nationalities, meaning there are Spanish, British, and several other themed planes to round out the worldwide ethnicity race around the world.  Some of the familiar voices of this film include Julia Louis-Dreyfus as a French Canadian racing plane, Carlos Alazraqui as a lovesick Spanish plane (that is decked out like a Mexican wrestler), and Brad Garrett of Everybody Love Raymond fame as Dusty's main sidekick.  Sadly, none of these characters are remotely interesting, humorous, or worthy of living on in the folklore of animation fame.

Overall, there aren't very many interesting things to say about this animated spin-off.  Planes simply doesn't make an effort to stand out against a crowed group of animated features, including Despicable Me 2 and Turbo - all of which are desperate to gain the attention of parents.  Dane Cook is certainly an interesting choice for a leading role, and actually excels in the position, but a weak supporting cast and a one-dimensional, predictable story will barely entertain the kids.  You'll be making a better choice if you just pop the Cars DVD in at home and wait for Planes to hit video.

Famous movie franchises can be like famous families. They can benefit from association, but they can also suffer at the hands of unending comparisons. And this may well be the case for 'Planes'.

In terms of a movie, 'Cars' was a massive success and taking this tale to the next level was undoubtedly the goal for Disney. In terms of media, marketing and merchandising, transforming 'Cars' into 'Planes' was a relatively straightforward exercise, however, it was a greater leap of faith to transform the movie.

Without being a spoiler, the 'Cars' template was overlaid on the 'Planes' concept and then tweaked here and there. The backdrop is once again a race circuit, albeit around the world, and the shifting fortunes play out on a leader board. The central character is not a shiny 'Lightning McQueen', but the little plane that could. Once again, a wise old character tempers the star's impetuosity and there is even a love interest, although it has shifted to a pair of co-stars.

There is no escaping the quality of the film's production. The animation, 'camera' angles, settings and colour are all first class. The audience even captures a sense of flight as the aircraft pitch and roll about the big screen. Visually, 'Planes' is captivating.

What is missing to some degree is the humour stemming from spontaneity that 'Cars' brought to the table. Achieving this was always going to prove a difficult task given that the first franchise had set a benchmark of great expectations and conjured preconceptions in the minds of the audience. Funnily enough, if a template was being applied, this film may have benefited from employing another 'Mater'. A goofy side-kick providing comic relief right on cue.

Personally, I enjoyed 'Planes', but then again, I couldn't sit more in the centre of Disney's target demographic profile if I tried. I am an aviation enthusiast with a young family. I was always probably going to give this film '5 Stars' as it offers another opportunity to share cherished laughter and common ground with my children. However, the real test for 'Planes' will come from those not so centrally located in Disney's cross-hairs. Can it possibly have the far-reaching impact of the highly successful 'Cars' films? It is a very, very tough act to follow. In the future, 'Planes 2' could actually benefit from being one step removed from the other franchise and build upon its own identity.

For me, there is one final acid test for the film. I was lucky enough to see the movie on its opening day in the United States, but I am now keen to see the looks on my own kids' faces when 'Planes' lands here in Australia. Only then will I be able to truly rate the success of 'Planes'. I'll get back to you then...

Reviewed by Brianna Hope B.

This film is too cute, funny and has great animation.

Dusty, (Dane Cook-Voice) is a basic crop-dusting plane with big dreams of competing in an aerial race. However he is afraid of heights, yes that's right, heights! In order for him to even get up the nerve to compete and pursue his dreams; he needs the help of his mentor, Skipper, (Stacy Keach-Voice) and his friends.

""Planes"" has a good story line and I really like it. It has hope, adventure and good humor with comedians Brad Garrett (Chug-Voice), Sinbad (Roper-Voice) and many more. All the voice actors do a great job portraying their characters. Of course, the 3D animation is spectacular with great detail and lots of lively colors. My favorite scene is when Skipper starts training Dusty and Chug and Dottie (Terri Hatcher-Voice) are talking too loud for Dusty to concentrate. Skipper yells at them to be quiet and they straighten up immediately, but keep talking. This is really funny. My favorite character is Roper, because he says and does the funniest things. He always seems to be rambling about something and is funny.

Writer, Jeffrey M. Howard, writes a comedic script that gives kids something to enjoy and feel good about. Another well known comedian voice cast who I enjoyed in this film is Cedric the Entertainer (Leadbottom-Voice).
As Walt Disney once said, ""All our dreams can come true, if we have the courage to pursue them.""  I really like this and believe this message is demonstrated throughout the film.

I recommend this film for ages 7 to 13. Kids who love Disney animation films will love this one as it is similar to other Disney films. It's also a great film for the family to see although older teens may not be too interested in it.

I give ""Planes"" 4 out of 5 stars because I would like to see more originality and uniqueness, but overall it is a great film and I really enjoy watching it. I know you will too.

Well folks, Disney's done it again! ""Planes"" is truly a heartfelt underdog story that tells the audience to believe in themselves.  There are always plenty of obstacles in life, but if you dig deep, you can find the courage to become whatever you dream of.  In Dusty's case, he dreams of becoming the fastest air racer in the world!  His closest friend is Dottie, a forklift and ace mechanic.  Although she tells Dusty that he isn't built to race and that chasing his dreams is downright dangerous, Dottie always has his back, no matter what he decides.  I love Dottie because she is such a loyal friend to Dusty.  She is strong, super smart and practical.  When anyone messes with her friend, she lets them have it!

Skipper is also very protective of Dusty.  He was an ace flier in WWII and chooses to be alone and quiet until Dusty talks him into training him for the race.  He wants to train Dusty hard so that he races well and stays safe.  Skipper finds that he can learn a few things from Dusty, too.

The visual effects in the film are spectacular and, being 3D, there are plenty of scenes where the audience feels as if they are flying along with Dusty!  The race takes us to amazing places like India, Europe and Mexico.  The music is great too, combining old favorites with lots of new songs.  Since the racers come from countries all over the world, the music is based on the background of the characters, which includes Italian, Mexican and British music, plus many more types.

It's no surprise that the director of Planes, Klay Hall, is an airplane enthusiast.  He started drawing airplanes at an early age and his father and grandfather were both pilots.  The executive producer of ""Planes,"" John Lasseter, is a two-time Academy Award-winning director.  He directed huge hits like ""Toy Story,"" ""A Bug's Life,"" ""Cars"" and ""Cars 2.""  The voice-over cast includes such big names as Dane Cook, Stacy Keach, Teri Hatcher, Sinbad, Val Kilmer and Julia Louis-Dreyfus.

My favorite scene in the film is when El Chupacabra (El Chu), the legendary Mexican racer, sings to a female racer, Rochelle.  El Chu is trying desperately to win her affection but, keeps failing in hilarious ways.
I give ""Planes"" five out of five stars and recommend it for ages 5 to 12, although it's fun for whole families to watch together, like mine did!  It comes to theaters Friday, August 9th, so be sure to check it out!

I have roku tv's (3 of them)  so is very comfortable to have a digital version and not only the bluray (that I have to play on the main TV), but au contraire of the blu ray version the amazon HD video only come in English.
My family is multilingual, me, Spanish speaker, wife, German Speaker, and we live in the US, so, our 4 children speak the 3 languages (since each of us speak with them in our mother language) , when watch the  blu ray  version they ask for some of the 3 languages regarding ...., they mood?..don't know really what make them today watch it in Spanish and tomorrow in English or German but the important is that they brain work in that way.
With amazon hd video version that part of the entertainment/brain exercise is lost , very, very very unfortunate.
Of course that happen with all the video content, hope they will fix that someday.....

The movie itself of course they love it, and is a 5 star in that way.
Sorry if you will complain about that the rating it must be about the movie itself and not about the amazon choice to cast it only in one language but ...well, perdon for that.",1502064000,,1176,4.3031674208144794

3265162,5,7799144076,"This is a great value for another really cute Disney movie.  It wasn't critically acclaimed, but in our household it's only second to Lightning McQueen and the Cars franchise with my three year old son.

This comes with the DVD (great for the car) Blu Ray (great for the TV) and digital copy (great for the Ipad or phone!).  So...your little Planes fan can have access anywhere you'd like him or her to!  It's a really great price for what you get.  We've only watched it a few times, but already it's worth it!

This movie stars Dusty Crophopper, a crop duster who dreams of being a racing plane.  He enters in the Wings Around the Globe Rally to race against many other 'real' racing planes.  He makes many friends and has many adventures along the way.  If a message is important to you in a kids movie, this has a 'you can be anything you want to be' and a 'never give up on yourself or your dreams' message.  Or, if you just like to be entertained, this is great for that too!

It has cute characters and is an all around fun family film.  I was really happy to get this movie in all 3 forms for such a good price.  Highly recommend!",1469577600,4,1138,4.2372093023255815

And its storyline is also pretty strong; way better the storyline from the Cars franchise. And also, the soundtrack was okay, but honestly, my favorite score of the entire soundtrack was when Dusty finally faced his fear of heights, despite the dizzy view down bellow (Dusty Soars). But my least favorite score of the entire soundtrack was this-Dusty crashing right into the ocean, all because of his distracting thoughts about his coach Skipper, and also ended up with him almost dying of drowning (Dusty Has to Ditch).

3265380,2,7799144076,"I would advise caution to anyone with high expectations for PLANES, Disney's
animated effort that attempts to ride the coattails of the CARS franchise.
First, you will notice the fact that I mentioned this was a Disney film -- not Pixar.
It doesn't take long for one to see that many of the signature elements that make
a Pixar film what it is are mostly missing here. Secondly, it turns out that PLANES
was conceived as a direct-to-video release and somewhere along the way, the
decision was made to release it theatrically.  Quite frankly, it's a bit sad to see Disney
has milked the franchise with this release at the expense of movie-going patrons
expecting something better.

PLANES takes place in the same similar universe as CARS.  Though it's a world
void of humans, the film pokes fun at many man-made landmarks.  As the story
opens we meet Dusty Crophopper (Dane Cook), a Midwestern crop-duster who
may be small on props, but very big on guts.  You see, he dreams of one day
becoming a racer and joining the elite who are flying in the Wings Around The
World race.  In the type of underdog story we have seen countless times before,
Dusty enlists the help of Skipper (Stacy Keach), a gruff WWII navy war veteran
who helps the brave little plane overcome his fears and prepare for the big race.

Despite this being an animated adventure that takes its viewers racing around
the world to exotic places, PLANES never allows most minds to go off of auto-pilot.
All the elements that Pixar would have brought to the table to make this film more
engaging are completely missing.  Instead we have an all-too-familiar story filled
with clichd characters and lame jokes that will probably go over the heads of its
targeted juvenile audience.

PLANES looks outstanding on Blu-ray.  Created entirely in the digital realm, this is
the kind of flawless transfer you expect to see from an animated feature like this.
This picture-perfect window allows viewers to appreciate the sharp imaging and
array of warm, glowing colors.  I even took notice of the deep level of blacks within
some of the propellors.  The only unfortunate thing to say about this great transfer
is that the animation seems dumbed down to its basics, giving us so much less to
absorb in keep our interests alive.

If I could have given a piece of advice to Disney about marketing this lackluster
spin-off, it would have been to push the envelope as far as the 3D presentation is
concerned.  I have seen plenty of bad movies suddenly turn into something worthwhile
all because of its stellar 3D presentation.  Sadly, PLANES stays mostly grounded in
3D, giving a decent perception of depth but with no pop-out whatsoever.  I sat grumbling
in my seat as I watched many missed opportunities for the filmmakers to have greatly
enhanced certain elements of the film including falling snow, rain and confetti that stay
completely within the confines of the screen. There are two sequences that come near
the end of the film that look pretty decent in 3D:  A storm at sea with pouring rain and
mounting waves that Dusty must overcome -and- a race over desert canyons that is sort
of reminiscent of the pod scene in Star Wars Episode I.  Still, overall, it seems that
everything about the 3D presentation is paint-by numbers. When are Disney animators
going to learn that there is more to this format than just depth?  Give audiences something
extra for the money you are charging them to see flops like this.  I would thrown every 3D
gimmick I could into this film just to give people something positive to talk about afterwards.

The most noteworthy points I can give to PLANES is its 7.1 DTS-MA soundtrack (which
has been downconverted to 5.1 on my system).  This is a very aggressive mix with lively
surround activity that remains constant throughout the film.  From the film's opening credits
you get the sense of the power this soundtrack provides and the amount of LFE thrust behind
it all.  Composer Mark Mancina provides quite a bit of punch with the film's orchestration that
covers a wide range of genres including rock, hip-hop, metal and samba.  With the seemingly
constant roar of jet engines laid on top of that, there is no need for caffeine to keep one awake.
I personally enjoyed the excessive use of multi-channel conversation that have voices moving
across the room, giving the viewer a better sense of character positioning.  In all, the most
impressive part of this film seems to be its sound mix and its the one thing that will probably
keep adults most engaged.

Planes arrives as a 3-Disc Combo (Blu-Ray 3D+Blu-Ray+DVD/Digital Copy) with a non-
lenticular cardboard sleeve.  It should be no surprise that the extra features are a bit sparse
and include deleted scenes and other featurettes that are geared more towards the kids than
giving any insight into the making of the film itself.

What more can be said about Disney's efforts to cheaply capitalize on Pixar's Cars
franchise in making a theatrical release out of direct-to-video material?  There is nothing
about PLANES that will appeal to adults -- note even its inclusion of 3D that provides little
else than a sense of depth.  This is a purchase one should only consider for young kids, and
even as such, don't even bother spending the extra money for the 3D.",1453075200,,5302,4.774370208105148

Except in Cars, the main protagonist actually learns something (i.e., how to not be constantly self-absorbed).  The only thing this 'film' teaches is that if you really want something, it's okay for you to lie, but not others.  Also, it's okay for you to totally assume things about other people and then get mad at them when the assumptions that you failed to research turn out to be false.  But that's okay, because YOU ARE GOING TO CHANGE THE WORLD.

Disney becomes lazier and greedier every year.  Thanks, Steve Jobs, for selling out to this heinous company so our children can get this garbage as 'entertainment'.",1448150400,2,701,4.840336134453781

Obviously some changes were made, but there were a LOT of similarities.  It wasn't so horrible to us that I felt it needed a 1 star review but it definitely wasn't terrific.  The other problem with this movie is that my kids didn't really like it.  I had a hard time keeping interest in it as well.  Unfortunately, we bought this at the same time as we bought other movies from Disney (Frozen, The Princess and the Frog... stuff like that) so the kids preferred some of the other movies and have not really wanted to watch this one very much.

I guess we can consider this like most spin-offs of movies... and not as good as the original movie obviously.  It doesn't seem that bad, but it was a little disappointing.  We're going to try it again when the weather gets worse and I'll update if anything changes for the better or worse.  For now, I would be prepared for a similar story as Cars. : /",1446076800,3,1070,4.226600985221675

3265564,3,7799144076,"As straightforward as spinoffs can get, really. Kids love talking cars, and kids love toy airplanes, so kids will love talking airplanes too, right? And they do, or at least mine do, even if none of this cast has half the sparkle or charisma of a Lightning McQueen or a Tow Mater. Which should speak volumes, since both are pretty much the bottom of the barrel in Pixar's repertoire. As competition-focused racing movies go, it's middle of the pack - energetic and often lovely, but flat as a board and thoroughly predictable. Younger audiences will thrill to the frequent chase scenes, with a good mix of terrain thrown in as appreciable spice, but their chaperones won't find much material hiding beneath the surface. Cars had a timely message about the loss of the great American highway lurking under there, and at least Cars 2 had some buck to its script, but there's really nothing more to this one than a simple played-out underdog sporting saga. And hey, that's perfectly okay. There's plenty of room on the screen for bright, shiny, cookie-cutter kids' fare, and it certainly doesn't offend. It's just no comparison to the Pixar-branded forerunners that paved these lanes. Good enough for a quiet evening, no more, no less, and it gave my three-year-old boys a good dose of imagination fuel.",1436745600,,1300,4.86036036036036

3265598,3,7799144076,"I never feel compelled to watch all the direct to video movies from companies I like.  After all, theres usually a reason these movies didn't hit theaters.  Yes, Ill occasionally miss a gem, but that is rare.

Which brings us to Planes.  Released by Disney without Pixars involvement (although John Lasseter, creator of Cars was heavily involved in his role as head of Disney studios), it was originally designed to be a direct to video film in the world of Pixars Cars but introducing new characters.  However, somewhere along the line they decided to release it to theaters first.  I never quite caught it while in theaters, but I did get it on Blu-Ray.  Turns out I wasn't missing much.

Dusty (voiced by Dane Cook) is a crop duster, a plane that flies back and forth in straight lines all day long.  But he longs for something more  racing.  As soon as he gets off work, he starts to practice with the help of his friend Chug (Brad Garrett), a truck that is reading Flying for Dummies to help Dusty out.

His ultimate dream is to fly in the Wings Around the World race, and when he surprisingly gets his chance, hes thrilled.  But can he keep up with his competition?  Will his fear of heights be an issue?  And what about the other planes who want to see him fail?

The animation in this movie is beautiful.  Its almost enough to make me wish Id seen it in the theater.  Over the course of the movie, we travel all around the world, and the stuff we fly by is just wonderful to look at.

Unfortunately, the story isn't as good as the animation.  It is fairly predictable.  Now I don't mind that as much, however, I never fully got involved in the story.  Instead, I just sat back and waited for the next event to unfold.

For that, I blame the characters.  There are just too many planes in the movie, and there are several sub-plots involving these secondary characters.  The result is that nothing and no one is given quite enough time to develop.  I think I would have enjoyed it more if I had gotten to know Dusty and one of two others better.  The secondary character plots could have been dropped, especially the romance, and I would have been fine.

Now that isn't to say I didn't have fun.  The romance I just mentioned provided a very funny scene.  There are some great jokes along the way, and a couple of times, I was pulled into an action sequence or two that were pretty suspenseful.

And this isn't the fault of the voice cast at all.  In addition to the others Ive already mentioned, weve got the likes of Julia Louis-Dreyfus, Teri Hatcher, John Cleese, Cedric the Entertainer, Sinbad, and Val Kilmer.  Everyone does a great job of bring their characters to life, and honestly, if you don't know who is playing the voices, you don't hear it at all.  And yes, for those of you keeping track, John Ratzenberger does have a blink and you miss him cameo.

In the end, I think Planes will appeal more to kids than adults, and they will love it.  Me?  I enjoyed parts of it, but I don't see myself pulling this one out all that frequently.",1434067200,,3053,4.397137745974955

3265967,4,7799144076,"***This review may contain spoilers.***

About halfway through ""Disney's Planes"" (hereafter ""D's Planes), one of Ripslinger's (voice of Roger Smith) bumbling lackeys (Ned or Zed, I couldn't tell) admits Dusty Crophopper's (voice of Dane Cook) efforts to compete in the worldwide flying race is a ""compelling Rocky tale"".  I think he's mostly right, except ""Rocky"" ends a little bit differently.  But ""D's Planes"" has the other ""Rocky"" cliches in abundance.

We have the underdog, a determined but outclassed and unlikely racing contender in the form of a low-flying cropduster (Dusty) who has the added handicap of acrophobia (fear of heights, but in this case, heights over 1,000 feet!).  We have the underdog's loyal buddy and moral support in the form of the Mater-like fuel truck Chug (voice of Brad Garrett).  We have the grizzled, gravelly-voiced, demanding racing trainer (and Dusty's idol) in the form of heroic veteran aerial bomber Skipper Riley (voice of Stacy Keach) who harbors a shameful secret.  We have the unscrupulous, sneaky current flying champion, the aforementioned Ripslinger, and his minions (not THOSE minions) Ned and Zed (voice of Gabriel Iglesias), willing to do anything to knock Dusty out of the race.  Finally, we have the diverse, colorful, if stereotypical fellow racers and opponents such as the veddy British Bulldog (voice of John Cleese), the flirtatious Rochelle (voice of Julie Louis-Dryfuss), and the flamboyant Casanova El Chupacabra (voice of  Carlos Alazraqui).

Yup, we have the millionth version of the underdog tale.  But, in the final analysis, so what?  How many films are really that original anyway?  And everyone likes a well-told, inspirational underdog story, no matter how many times we've heard it, right? Right?  Well, anyway, I contend that ""D's Planes"" has several positive qualities that make this same old tale well worth watching.

The first, most striking one is its visual artistry and photo-simulating effects.  Even though like its obvious ancestors ""Cars"" and ""Cars II"" we're dealing with sentient, living machines, the backgrounds and scenery feel so meticulously real and accurate.  A second quality is ""D's Planes"" mechanical and aviation knowledge which I guess was inaccessible to most watchers except machine experts, but didn't make you feel stupid that you didn't know it (like me).  I still found that knowledge was impressive. A third one is the race from the perspective of the airplanes - the bankings, the divebombings, the barrel rolls, the acrobatics- that convince you that absolutely nothing beats flying as the single most exciting, exhilarating activity on earth.

However, the most important quality is the underdog Dusty himself, on whose wings the movie hangs. Dusty is ambitious and determined to be more than a farm worker, but he is not brash and cocky.  On the contrary, he is humble, hardworking, and gracious and helpful to everybody, even to opponents like Bulldog and El Chupacabra.  As a result, Dusty begins to grow on others who would never have given him a chance before, and even begin to help him.  Kindness CAN pay dividends.  Dusty even persuades the reclusive Skipper to not only train him, but to even overcome his own stigma to come to Dusty's aid when Ripslinger tries to sabotage him.  Yes, Dusty is a fine role model.

In conclusion, even though ""D's Planes"" lacks the adult sophistication of other Pixar movies, and is going, more or less, where you think it's going, it makes the journey worthwhile.  Besides the previously mentioned qualities, it's clean and family-friendly, except for a risque bit involving removal of Dusty's ""sprayer"" to reduce weight and drag (""You can reattach it, right?""). The race showcases the globe well and the geological and climate obstacles the planes face. It convincingly converts the soul classic ""Love Machine"" into a ballad El Chupacabra uses to serenade Rochelle.  Most effectively, though ""D's Planes"" doesn't insist upon it, like ""Rocky"", it convinces us that, regardless of the outcome, those who never give up are always winners.",1419897600,,4084,5.214395099540582

3266355,3,7799144076,"My toddler son (and both his parents) really enjoy the Cars movie.  We had high expectations for Planes, but I have to say it was a mostly disappointing experience.  It may not be fair to compare it to Cars, but it's almost impossible not to.

The storyline is fairly entertaining but where this movie really falls short of Cars is the characters.  The main character, Dusty Crophopper, is a far cry from Lightning McQueen.  He's kind of bland and not very entertaining or comical.  The supporting characters just aren't as well written or as memorable as the Cars supporting cast.  The best character in the movie is El Chupacabra.  He brings some much needed comic relief to the movie.  Honestly I wish he had been a larger part of the movie.  Even with El Chupacabra, there's still no one that really compares to characters like Lightning McQueen and Mater.

By the time the movie was over, my main thought was ""Meh, it was just ok.""  I think my son shared the sentiment because he wasn't really into the movie and hasn't asked to watch it again (like he has with Cars).  So unfair or not, the comparison has to be made, and this movie is a far cry from the richly entertaining experience of Cars.",1407110400,,1200,4.525581395348837

3266446,2,7799144076,"First there was Cars then Planes next we'll get another thinly scripted, cheap film on Boats or Trains or any other mobile item. I did enjoy 'Planes' at all. I mean, it's not even a Pixar film! It's a Disney film, but not from Disney Animations or Pixar, it's from Disneytoons! A studio that works for Disney and makes DIRECT TO DVD movies off of Disney's already existing products. And that's what they were doing with 'Planes' until a test screening impressed Disney enough to move it to the theater instead of direct to DVD. I can't see why it ever made it to the cinema. It's not worthy of being seen by theater patron's. To be honest I didn't much care for 'Cars' which this spin off is based on. I didn't hate it but I didn't love it either. However the film had enough charm and heart to redeem itself as still worthy to carry Pixar's name... 'Planes' has neither enough charm, heart, or anything actually. My review of 'Planes'.

'Planes' tells the tale of Dusty Crophopper (originally voiced by Jon Cryer, but at the last minute was replaced by comedian Dane Cook) a crop-duster in the small town of Radiator Springs- no I mean another small town called Propwash Junction, a place that lays in the middle of nowhere. Dusty dreams of flying in races practicing every night, hoping that one day he'd be good enough to compete in the Wings Around the Globe Competition. This year he decides to try and qualify for the competition. Falling short of qualifying, after another racer is axed, Dusty is allowed to move up a position and qualifies for the Wings Competition. Dusty now must conquer his fear of heights, and fly, fly, fly with the help of a retired war veteran (Stacy Keach) and his friends.

Yawn, yawn, yawn. Been there, seen that. This is your average kiddie fair. The script is dumbed down, predictable, and very unfunny. Not to mention the film is almost a complete replica of the far superior 'Cars', just switched around the main characters from cars to planes. About ten minutes into the film I knew everything that was going to happen. Nothing about the film surprises me, or delights me. The film can be seen as made for children, but I doubt even them will get much out of this. The jokes, are seen, you know they're there but they just aren't funny. The dialogue is somewhat laughable, and clich.

The animation is below-par. It's sad; it's rough and seems to have been done by a bunch of people straight out of college. I mean, when you compare the animation of 'Planes' to that of any other Pixar or Disney film, you can tell 'Planes' animation is by far worse. However, I must express my admiration for the flying sequences, that seem to be done with ease... well some of them anyways. Some of them just don't look good, while others do.

Character wise, you don't relate to, or care for anybody. Our lead, Dusty Crophopper, is just so bland and uninspired, without any real motivation for anything. He's just unrelatable, and boring. The rest of the competitors are mostly stereotypes of different cultures. The only character you can even feel for is Skipper, but even his story is underwhelming.

Voice cast wise, 'Cars' had the upper hand, but 'Planes' didn't do that bad itself. 'Dane Cook' is fine as Dusty, no matter how bad his dialogue is. 'Stacy Keach' basically mimic's 'Paul Newman's' voice as Doc from 'Cars'. The other competitor's vocals are good enough to portray the characters stereotypes in their respective cultures.

All and All 'Planes' try's to soar but crashes. Its predictable, unfunny, and almost a replica of 'Cars'. Adults will hardly be able to manage sitting through it, and while small children will enjoy it, most anybody else may not. D 4/22/14

'Planes' is rated PG for mild action and rude humor. It's appropriate for kids 5 and up. However I doubt anybody over 10 will be willing to watch this one.",1404691200,2,3864,4.640350877192983

The true irony is that a film about aircraft manages to be so middle-of-the-road. Someone took a copy of the Save the Cat plot template and put in the very minimum amount of effort required to get this on screen.

There are some characters. There are some jokes. Theres every plot point you'd expect and nothing that you dont. Its not actually unpleasant to watch, but nor is it something that youll think about seconds after leaving the cinema.

The boys at Pixar are true to the Walt-Disney spirit - nothing they produce is ever like something they've done before.  Except for their unparalled superiority - we can always count on that.

This is why I was soooooo disappointed when Pixar sold to Disney.  It was like selling the Mona Lisa to a flea market.

  2.  There is a very solid story line that is well developed!

  3.  The 90 minutes passes before you know it!

  4.  This is a movie for both adults and for children.  There is some violence in this movie (a couple of planes get killed in a war scene), so you should be aware of that up front.

I am a huge fan of Pixar and looking at the obvious similarities between this and the Cars movies I assumed it was Pixar's latest film entry. Monster's University was also on the bill that week which further solidified my thoughts that this was another Pixar film.

I enjoyed it, but thinking it was Pixar I thought to was sub-par considering their past efforts. It's a cute little movie more aimed at children. It's simplistic storyline, along with familiar characters (even thou this time they are in the shape of planes rather then cars) makes this one forgettable.

Since this isn't actually a Pixar release I would give it 4 stars for kids, but adults may want to catch it on cable or forget it all together. The Blu Ray looks and sounds flawless so if you're a fan......buy it.",1397520000,,876,4.50314465408805

I liked Cars and my son (now 3.5) and I have watched Cars for truly countless number of times. But Cars2 took a violent dark turn and we had to put that away so the impressionable mind of a 3 yr old did not have to see all the ""killing"" and shooting etc. I thought Planes would be like Cars. Nope! It's more like Cars2. It is a great storyif you can discern that it's just a story, that too animated. For my son, it's all too real and he gets scared at some of the parts, and some of the other parts are a tad too violent (shooting, slicing!! I mean come on, really!) and could easily influence a little boy to think those actions/behaviors are okay and acceptable.

3266663,1,7799144076,"The overall imagery is beautifully done and it does not seem like a cheap movie but the storyline is just ""plane"" missing. It comes off like a sad attempt to profit off of previous Pixar films. Their obvious attempt to bring in money off of product placements and maybe trigger more attractions in the Car-land area in Disneyland is really pathetic. Disney can do a lot better.",1395532800,,377,4.641791044776119

3266674,3,7799144076,Planes is a favorite of my 3 year old. I personally had very high expectations but found it less entertaining than the Cars series. But it was a cute movie and I enjoy watching it with my son.,1395100800,,192,4.078947368421052
3266675,4,7799144076,"I have read reviews for this movie and it makes me laugh, its for little kids not us. It had funny jokes and was great to watch. It is for little kids, unless your kid loves Woody Allen this is a great movie for any kid.",1395100800,,220,3.8043478260869565

3266678,2,7799144076,"As the title states, our three-year-old son is obsessed with this movie, which makes sense since he was always obsessed with the two Cars movies. My husband and I don't love it, partly because Dane Cook is Dusty's voice (which disturbs us after hearing his stand-up routines) and partly because the story line is very similar to Cars 2 (as another reviewer has mentioned). I had such high hopes for this movie and was very excited about the military jets playing a role, but instead they made it an international race. I am disappointed in the script and had expected more from Pixar. Nevertheless, we have a preschooler who loves it, and we have bought several of the die-cast planes from Target and it is entertaining to hear him reenact the movie scenes.

Also, we got a digital copy with our DVD purchase and chose to redeem it on Amazon so that our son could watch it on the Kindle Fire, but it is ""locked"" and we are unable to download it. I spent over thirty minutes on the phone with Kindle support and she worked very hard to find a solution, but for some reason this digital copy can only be played on our computer. This upsets us and I wish I had redeemed my code with iTunes.",1395100800,2,1187,4.420091324200913

3266680,5,7799144076,"Myself and the grandkids enjoyed this movie. Hope they leave it as is and skip the sequel. They never live up to the original. Planes did follow the premise of 'Cars', but I don't think that bothered the kids.",1395014400,,209,4.384615384615385

The plane is ""lightning Mcqueen"" there is an almost Mater and another version of Hudson. No new ideas or jokes and Dane Cook can only do two emotions, surprise and not surprises. He is terrible actually.",1394928000,,310,4.271186440677966

3266688,5,7799144076,"Let me start off by stating just how much I absolutely despise Dane Cook. If time travel was real, and I could go back in time and only be allowed to kill one person, it would be Dane Cook, provided that I could get to him before he ever said ""who's in my mouth."" Just to be clear, I would kill Dane Cook before either Hitler or Bin Laden, but I will watch this movie 1,000 times because of how much my 2 year old son loves this movie.",1394841600,,435,3.898876404494382

3266690,4,7799144076,"While not nearly the quality of story of Cars, this movie is enjoyable.  Rather than focusing on an individual's growth from vanity to selflessness, this tale emphasizes the notion that one can achieve more than what appears possible and is a motivational film.

Perhaps his movie tastes are not quite as discerning as those writing reviews, but he doesn't seem to care.  If your kids (or you) like the Cars franchise, consider this another movie in the series.

Planes gives life to those personalities and takes the viewer through an entertaining story of a little crop duster with aspirations of being a highly competitive air racer. I enjoy paying attention to how props and landscape play into the aviation theme such as the mountainous terrain resembles aircraft lined up on a tarmac. I would recommend Planes to anyone who enjoys watching movies for what the movie brings to them entertainment value wise.

3266770,4,7799144076,"Well produced movie film that emulates Pixar animation and an extension of Cars. Simple story of plane duster who wants to prove himself against some hardcore flyers. Animation is shamelessly close to Cars, but lacks the starpower punch of Lightning McQueen & Mater along with a lot of their screwy backups that love to shine in their own limelight.
Not many extras on regular DVD with meet the characters & a rather dreary homage to Planes origin called Klay's Flight Plan that drips in some overly patriotic sentiment as if some family found the corner market to unique experiences to family bond by flying fighter planes. Some homeage to family values.",1392854400,,655,4.90990990990991

It was different enough to be interesting and I found myself enjoying it. More importantly, the kids like it.

I bought it as a present for my son for Christmas because he asked for it and I watched it with him once. What critics don't think about when writing reviews is some movies are made for CHILDREN not middle aged nothing impresses me adults. This movie was just fine for everyone in my family but maybe that just makes us a bunch of simpletons.,1392422400,,448,4.2823529411764705

It amazes me that those who craft these movies think of both children and the adult audience. There were so many hilarious lines which parents and adults think of as ""code"" past the age of 30, and especially having raised a family. Some of the time we were howling with laughter so loud, we had to hit ""pause"" and my grandson was trying to figure out the joke. But he loved it, too.

3266899,4,7799144076,"In the event that you wonder how in the world the Pixar Cars franchise morphed into the Disney Planes universe (of which this film is the first of a proposed trilogy), lets take a look at interesting road that led to the pieces development.  After the merger of Disney and Pixar (a union affectionately termed Pixney); the lines between the two companies were forever blurred to the point where Pixar works (like Brave) bear the names of almost none of the individuals typically associated with Pixar while Disney pieces like the Tinker Bell films, Tangled, Frozen, and Planes boast Executive Production duties by none other than Pixar poster-boy John Lasseter.

Planes actually takes the connection quite a bit further by crediting Lasseter as one of the writers, cameos John Ratzenberger (who appears in every one of Pixars productions) as Harland and follows Pixars impeccable attention to detail concerning such details as actual plane make/ model likeness, geography, historical accuracy and so on.  Yet the fact remains the film isn't considered a Pixar production and in fact comes to us from the typically direct-to-dvd branch of the Diz known as DisneyToon Studios (whos last theatrical release takes us back to 2005 in the form of  Pooh's Heffalump Movie).  Planes too was supposed to be a direct-to-dvd affair with a fairly modest budget of $50-mil but thanks to a theatrical release gap left between Monsters University and Frozen, Planes got the nod to debut on the big screen on  August 9, 2013.

Confused? Dont be- all of the behind-the-scenes antics in the world do not a good (or bad) movie make.  Fortunately Planes has the advantage of sitting atop a very long line of animated film experience.  While critics weren't particularly enamored with the film, I can attest that it succeeds on a lot of levels where the much costlier ($200-mil) 2011 blockbuster Cars 2 fails.  But before we get to all of that, perhaps a brief summary is in order.

Planes follows the exploits of crop duster Dusty Crophopper (Dane Cook) who holds down steady employment at a Midwest cornfield while practicing aerobatic maneuvers in his spare time and dreaming of the fame and excitement of air racing.

Keeping his dreams forever out of reach, his boss, Leadbottom (Cedric the Entertainer) and his forklift mechanic friend, Dottie (Teri Hatcher) keep reminding Dusty that he was built for the very specific purpose of dusting crops.  However, his good hearted fuel truck friend, Chug (Brad Garrett); think a less redneck but equally innocent Mater, begins training him in private.  The night before the qualifiers, Dusty asks an elderly and reclusive navy war plane named Skipper Riley (Stacy Keach) to teach him how to race.  What follows is a global race adventure rife with personified planes from several nations; some friendly others not so much.

Coming in at a runtime of 92-minutes and wearing a PG rating, Planes works on the tried and true underdog out of his league formula and delivers some pretty genuine laughs along the way.  Sure its nothing we haven't collectively seen before, but what Planes lacks in originality it makes up for with heart.  That and some really nice aerial scenes that (unlike say Cars 2s action sequences), don't take away from the subtle charm of the narrative in the process.

If you really care about small details you may notice a whole plethora of little adult-enjoyable spices scattered about like Val Kilmer and Anthony Edwards as Naval fighter jets; essentially the Planes versions of their Top Gun characters complete with Iceman and Goose helmets to boot.

In all Planes doesnt succeed in spite of its simplicity and relatively modest budget but because of these things.  In an industry becoming ever more inflated in terms of budget and eye-candy, Planes is a refreshing romp in a franchise that seemed to have lost its way a bit in its first dedicated sequel.  Whether or not diving directly into a trilogy is a wise move is yet to be determined but considering the first Planes movie cost $50-mil to make and has already taken in $220-million, its a safe bet to say well be visiting this anthropomorphic world of transportation for years to come.",1391299200,,4195,4.9374110953058326

Well, the expense can be pretty overwhelming.  I'm so thankful for Amazon's prime membership.  It's well worth the cost yearly.  My children love that I send their children gifts through Amazon because I always get their presents to them on time, and they get a better quality of gifts since Amazon has great pricing.

At one point the little crop-duster with delusions of grandeur even turns on his hero Skipper Riley, because he fails to live up to his idea of what a hero should be.

I thought it would be just like Cars and I was not that excited to see it, but my younger children wanted to see it so my older children and I figured we would endure it.  We were pleasantly surprised!  Disney really did their homework on this one, as always, especially for the military scenes.  The scenes and characters are true to life and it is very easy to imagine that is exactly how it would be if airplanes could really talk.

3266953,2,7799144076,My family and I truly enjoyed Cars and Cars II however we found Planes to be nearly an insult to Disney and Pixar. The plot was very similar to that of Cars and not engaging or enjoyable for adults or kids. I had read reviews before renting this movie in the hope that they would be proven wrong but I was the one that was proven wrong.,1390780800,,336,4.029850746268656

3266955,5,7799144076,"This was a rather exceptionaly great movie. At first I thought it was made by PIXAR but to my amazement it was not. It was made by DISNYTOON studios who make some of the computer animated tv shows on the DISNEY channel and Toon Disney. It was supposed to be a direct-to-video release but when DISNEY saw how good the scenes looked they decided they would give it a theatrical release. Even though it was not produced by PIXAR, John Lasseter who directed and produced a lot of the PIXAR films and works for the PIXAR company was executive producer for PLANES. I thought this movie was great. It had a great story line great animation and had great music scored by Mark Mancina. Plus the songs in the movie were great and fitting in the places they were played. Overall this was a great movie and in my opinion, it soared higher than any of the film critics remarks and was better than the credit they gave it. After all, I don't determine whether I like a movie based on critics' remarks anyway because I have loved many movies 100% that critics have said were nothing but crap! And on one more note, I did not notice any of the stereotypes one critic said were in the movie. I loved this movie just as much as I have loved any other movie to come from the DISNEY company. In my opinion, many of the critics who had anything to say about this film would not know a great film if it was shown to them because this film is obviously better than they gave it credit for.",1390780800,,1466,4.276978417266187

The plot is a bit similar to the movie Cars......rookie wants to win a big annual racing event.  Nevertheless, it's still a cute movie and both my children, as well as myself, enjoyed it very much.

3266969,3,7799144076,"There is not a lot to say, good or bad about Planes. It clearly is an offshoot of the Cars franchise, and the storyline/concept aren't groundbreaking, but it's not a disappointment, either. If your kids like Cars/most Pixar movies (or even enjoy playing with toy cars/planes, etc.), they'll probably enjoy the film; it is, after all, a kids' movie.",1390521600,,348,4.915254237288136
3266970,4,7799144076,"An offshoot of the ""Cars"" franchise, ""Planes"" sets its classic be-all-you-can-be underdog story in the context of a lowly crop duster (Dane Cook) who dreams of one day competing against the big boys of the air (i.e., all those planes built for speed) in a race around the world. With the help of a fuel truck (Brad Garrett), two forklifts (Terri Hatcher and Danny Mann) and a retired navy bomber named Riley (Stacy Keach), who imparts his wisdom and pointers to the eager, fresh-faced lad, Dusty sets out to prove that he is every bit the flyer that those bigger, sleeker and more aerodynamically advanced airplanes are. Just one slight problem though: turns out little Dusty is deathly afraid of heights.

With its roots planted firmly in the tradition of ""Around the World in 80 Days"" and ""The Great Race,"" ""Planes"" has grace and charm to spare, as Dusty swoops and soars through the heavens on his way to realizing his dreams. Along the way, he meets up with an international potpourri of fellow aircraft, including Bulldog (John Cleese ) from England, El Chupacabra (Carlos Alazraqui) from Mexico, Rochelle (Julia Louise-Dreyfuss) from Canada (the French part, of course) and Ishani (Priyanka Chopra) from India.

And off we sail into the wild blue yonder, thanks to a witty script by Jeffrey M. Howard, clean direction by Klay Hall, and top-notch visuals that beautifully create a familiar-looking modern world that's totally devoid of people (even the Statue of Liberty is in the form of a patriotic forklift). All those elements combine to make this animated version of ""Those Magnificent Men in Their Flying Machines"" (minus the men, of course) a delight to behold.

In fact, ""Planes"" is what ""Cars"" logically should have been but wasn't, that is a freewheeling adventure built on movement and speed; instead, the original movie, for some reason, allowed itself to get mired in that dull small town for so long that it eventually stalled out. ""Planes,"" on the other hand, keeps the narrative in full-speed-ahead mode throughout - and that makes all the difference.",1390435200,,2072,4.965417867435159

3266974,2,7799144076,"I'm not going to discuss the movie (plot, characters, etc.) here.  Instead, I want to talk about how ANNOYING it is that the movie ""chirps"" every 10-15 min. or so.  My blu-ray player's firmware is up to date, so I know it's not that.  All other movies work fine, too, so I'm pretty sure it's just this movie.  Maybe I got a defective disc, I don't know, but as I watch the movie, there is an occasional, very loud, ""chirp"" (for lack of a better word).  I suspect this is some sort of copy protection scheme that my player doesn't like.  Don't even get me started on copy-protection rubbish--anyone who really wants to copy the disc is going to find a way to do it.  Period.  There is always a work-around.  The only way to foil a pirate is to make the disc have so many errors that the copy program gets confused and drops packets and stuff.  Great--now you've prevented the movie from being copied, but you have also made my legally purchased copy not play properly on my set.  Stupid Hollywood.

3266980,1,7799144076,"Steve Jobs and Walt Disney are rolling in their graves on this one.  Pixar is the top of the line, can't miss, Cadillac of studios when it comes to animated films.  You will notice that this is not a Pixar film like Cars, but rather Disney (who now owns Pixar) so they knew it wasn't worthy of their premium nameplate.  John Lassiter has a credit on the film, but I refuse to believe this brilliant man had any input into this terrible film.

I have three children (12,9 and 6) and by the time the film ended I was the only one left in the room.  I think my 12 year old actually went and straightened up her room on her own rather than lose 2 hours of her life to this half-baked flop.  The story is boring, and actually a little difficult to follow as they brew up twists and turns to add angst to an otherwise totally predictable plot.  This reminds me of the dark days of Disney when they put out Peter Pan 2 and 3, 102 Dalmations, and other terrible spinoffs to separate you from $20 with little or no effort on their part.

The market has shown it will happily give you hundreds of millions of dollars for producing quality, computer animated films so why this?  Disney couldn't do it on their own so they bought Pixar and this is what we get?  Somebody rescue John Lassiter from the dungeon of Cinderella's castle so he can straighten things out.

Check out the Franz song in the special features; very sweet. Excellent for talking about following what you want vs. what people expect of you. The digital copy was great, and the extra DVD means we can forget it in the car and she can still watch Dusty Crophopper. There are a few words in it I wish they had left off ""hello ladies"" as an insult to some racer plans, ""moron"" when two planes were in a fight, and a fall-in-love storyline they didn't need.

3267007,1,7799144076,"I honestly believe that Disney employed people to rate this movie four stars and above, because there is no way any person, young or old, with a normal attention span could find this movie enjoyable.

One person who rated it four stars argued that it's a children's movie, and therefore doesn't need a well thought out plot, good characterization, etc; and to that I say nay, nay.  Do children not deserve good story lines and character development?  Are we so lazy and jaded as a society that we should just recycle plots and narratives, then use youth as a rationalization?  I say nay, nay.

But even if we look at it from a child's standpoint, it is still exceedingly dull.  The kids in my family, who otherwise enjoy going to see flicks, were so squirmy and bored by it that they kept asking when it would be over.  It's the same frickin story as Cars, for God's sake!  Only this time the protagonist is a whiny, self-indulgent plane with grandiose ideas of becoming a race plane.  Nothing interesting happens, and the characters mirror those from cars, except this time the acting is atrocious.

Just because it is a children's movie does not mean that Disney has the right to abandon originality and interesting story ideas. Children deserve better. Originality and excellent character development are what make films stand the test of time.

 Go back to the drawing board Disney, this one really crashed and burned!",1390262400,7,1422,4.759183673469388

Dusty is a crophopper who dreams of being more than just what he was built for!  He works hard and tries out to be in an international sky race.  No one is more surprised that he gets in than Dusty himself.  He lacks confidence in himself.  With the help of ""The Skipper"" Dusty starts training for his race.  He gains some self-confidence and realizes that his dream can be a reality.  He is a crophopper in an internation race.  Maybe he can even win!  Dusty is an inspiration, you can do anything if you work hard!  He also teaches kids to just be yourself!  Don't change who you are just to impress someone, be yourself and you never know what might happen!

After being slightly disappointed with Cars 2 I didn't have huge expectations for Planes.  I was pleasantly surprised at how much I enjoyed this one!  It goes back to the roots of pixar and delivers a great story with lots of valuable lessons for the kids that are the intended audience!

One of the things we loved was the attention to flight detail. We both held pilots licenses at one time. We know the rules and the problems that can happen on cross country races.

the voice of the friend truck is the actor from everybody loves raymond (brad garrett) and he was super cute and funny.
i also really liked that they took you around the world, that was quite fun.

pros
fun
gets you on the edge of your seat
fun for children
animation was easy to understand

cons
storyline was lackluster

but honestly, from a disney movie how crazy does a story really need to be?

It also has some great opportunities to teach your kids important life lessons as well. Some of the things it teaches are how to be a good loser, how to be a good winner, how to make and be friends, that some things are more important than winning, how to overcome fears, the importance of honesty, the importance of integrity and - maybe more than anything - the importance of courage and dedication.",1389139200,2,666,4.370967741935484

It's well written and has a good story line. I think it's great for everyone young and old, but especially for kids because I think it teaches a valuable life lesson. The lesson being that no one should ever let anyone tell them that they can't do something for whatever reason. That anyone can do anything with courage and determination. I have learned myself in my life that this is absolutely true!

I wholly recommend that parents get this movie for their kids, and watch it with them!",1388966400,,657,4.615384615384615

The planes are all based on real-life models (I'd never known there was a twin-engined conversion for Beech Bonanza V-tails), and the flying is usually true-to-life (the railroad tunnel is an exception).  The only disappointment is that it wasn't quite up to Pixar's usual quality (which is why I ""like"" it, rather than ""love"" it).  Be sure to watch the special feature about the movie's director and his family (his father had flown Corsairs during WW II).",1388966400,,503,4.758620689655173

3267195,3,7799144076,"Planes is a movie about Dusty who is a plane with dreams of competing as a high-flying air racer. But Dusty's has some issues in regards to racing and so he turns to a seasoned naval aviator who helps Dusty qualify to take on the defending champ of the race circuit.

Although kind of a rehash of the Cars story and similar in ways to the Turbo movie that was released this past year, Planes has its moments and although maybe not as fun for Adults is a great fun time for kids. The plot is something we have seen before with Dusty as a typical fish out of water with big dreams whose fatal flaw is an inconvenient fear of extreme heights and the movie depicting the the ups and downs of Dusty as he has to deal with his devious foes, a girl plane he has a crush on, low fuel, bad weather and mechanical difficulties. And like Cars, he has a crew of sidekicks including slow-witted fuel truck Chug (Brad Garrett), no-nonsense mechanic Dottie (Teri Hatcher) and Skipper Riley (Stacy Keach), a Navy Corsair who flew in World War II. Although some of the characters are a bit stereo-typical, there are some funny moments, especially with El Chupacabra's attempts to woo his French competitor.

Even with this not being terribly original, youngsters especially under 10 or so will love this movie and find it entertaining and has a decent lesson for kids to learn as well.",1388880000,,1368,4.48995983935743

Unfortunately, this movie was way to predictable and lacked the magic and excitement of the original cars. My personal feel while watching this movie was like I was watching a cheesy Saturday morning cartoon. The voices were not as enjoyable and fitting as the first Cars, but rather stale and sounded like a cheap puppet show at times.
I give it two stars for the ""few"" smiles it generated and the animation.

The bottom line
This movies story line and graphics could be compared to putting a go-kart engine in a Rolls Royce.
Most people will doubtfully, purposely watch it more than once.",1388793600,,674,4.760683760683761

3267230,3,7799144076,"**Some Spoilers** This movie, although it does have its own feel good story about the underdog, a crop duster, Dusty. It is sort of familiar with the way that Cars played out but vice versa.

Instead of Lightning McQueen being from a privileged life with the lights and camera's. Having all the talents and the selfishness until he's humbled by the small town folks of Radiator Springs. Planes tell the story of Dusty, a country boy (plane) trying to live his dream of being one of the fastest planes in the whole world and he day dreams about it a whole lot.

He's not very talented, but does get a little help from a grumpy former veteran. He teaches him some of the in and outs of what it takes to make it. How much speed doesn't factor in it at all, but brains.

Eventually after you get to this point you already know what happens and Planes doesn't sway away from that. My daughter did manage to watch most of it, I wondered if she felt as if she knew what would happen. Don't get me wrong I think any kid at her age will be engaged into the movie. There's great messages in this to never give up, keep going with whatever your dream may be. The plot is very predictable though and which is why I gave it three stars.

I rented this through Amazon and the picture quality was great. Streaming was flawless, words didn't play catch up with the characters. I had a very good experience through Amazon.",1388707200,,1405,4.330798479087452

I watched it as well (mom) it was worth the rental price.  and whats great about amazon is if you rent a movie and than decide to buy it they will let you put the rental fee amount towards the purchase amount - which i think is great customer service.  you never know with the kids sometimes, sometimes they love it sometimes they don't.  so knowing in the back of my head that if they go crazy over a rental i made i can always contact amazon and they let you purchase it for the difference in price of what you paid to rent it.",1388620800,,680,4.24031007751938

Adults may enjoy it as well, depending upon your appreciation of airplanes, or even airplane related movies from years gone by. Personally, I appreciate the use of Val Kilmer and Anthony Edwards as voices of Bravo and Echo. Nice reference to ""Top Gun"".

Obviously there are promotional ties to the movie ""Cars"", but this movie should really be judged on its own merit.

There isn't a lot of violence but there is one scene that raised a few questions about why planes were being shot down, who was shooting at them and why? I wasn't expecting it at the time so it threw me a little when it came up. It's the scene with the skipper during a WWII sort of mission in a scene from a long time ago. Just an fyi

It's a cute little movie about being more than you are and going after your dreams. There are also the side messages about doing the right thing, overcoming your fears and of course the good guy wins:)",1388534400,,692,4.007246376811594

3267270,1,7799144076,"I normally don't write reviews because I figure that plenty of people share their experiences with movies to where the whole range of opinions are covered but when I saw the rating this film has on Amazon, I felt compelled to do what I could to pull the rating down a little...this film is THAT bad.

Things you need to know before buying this movie:
1 - This was originally going to be a direct to DVD release
2 - This animation was done in India and is a clearly sub-par quality of animation, definitely not Pixar quality
3 - The voice acting is less than stellar.  Animated characters need to be just that - characters - and I felt not one of the voice actors delivered for this film.  I don't know if the problem was the direction the actors received, the lack of voice acting experience for most of them, or just poor dialogue, but it's very much lacking
4 - Dane Cook is the lead character's voice, for those unfamiliar with Dane Cook, the guy is definitely not a tremendous actor and he's even worse as a voice actor.  The best way I can describe it is it sounds like he's just reading the lines aloud and forgetting that he's supposed to be expressing emotion with his voice
5 - My son didn't like it.  Normally a Disney film will grab his attention right away and hold him the entire time, but this film never had him - it simply isn't engaging in any way, poor characters, worse plot, and bad animation
6 - I would NOT buy this film if I had watched it first, I bought it based upon prior experience with Disney films and based on the assumption it was done by Pixar and would be of typical Pixar standard, like the films Wall-E, Brave, Toy Story, Cars, etc.
7 - It's just not good

I'm not going to elaborate on plot or anything like that, all I can say is I was expecting a certain quality of film when I bought this as a Christmas gift for my son simply because it was a Disney movie, then when it started I thought, ""wow, the animation isn't quite as good on this one""; watched a bit more and thought, ""whoever they chose for the lead, he's not very good""; then I noticed my son wasn't watching the movie at all and asked him if he was watching the movie and he asked me to turn it off.  I tried to encourage my son to give it a chance and to watch it but the more the movie went on, the more I was getting irritated that I had paid money for it because it was just so, so bad.  I ended up turning it off and put in Disney's The Princess and the Frog (another Christmas gift) and immediately my son sat down and was watching with full attention - that told me everything I needed to know - Planes is so poor even my 3-year-old son doesn't want to watch it.",1388448000,,2670,4.140926640926641

3267277,4,7799144076,"Cars is the definitive production with regard to ""humanizing"" mechanical machines. Planes, while entertaining, falls short in both story and character of not only the original ""Cars"" but also its sequel.

I had hoped that Disney would keep the Pixar label, but they didn't for this production. While Frozen is an undoubted success, Planes simply does not measure up to either Pixar or classic Disney storytelling.",1388448000,,413,5.257575757575758

Same theme as the movie Cars, such as racing ethics and dealing with competition, a romance here or there, older version teaching  a newer version.

Now to the movie, the good guy overcomes the bad guy and wins friends along the way. We need more movies like this for our children to watch and learn about fair play and winning isn't everything at any cost. It's a warm movie that helps reinforce what I teach my son everyday, you don't have to be first, just do your best at whatever you do, even if it's digging a hole, make it the best dang hole anyone has ever seen.

Now, that initial statement being made, I'll start my finish by saying I don't recommend it for adults, either.  Why?  Well, it's pretty childish.  ;-)  lol, no, seriously...  I found minimal growth in the characters, minimal challenge.  I appreciated the WWII reference, it was done with respect.  But Dusty seemed like the same fellow at the end that he was at the beginning.  I will add that I found it interesting to watch others change around him because of his good example.
I bought this without watching it first, expecting it to be a lot more like Cars (either 1 or 2).  The same cute-ish concept of sentient machines was present, but at no point was I actually excited or drawn in to the story line.  It was sort of like opening a soda only to find that it's gone flat.
For those of you who disagree with me, that's fine.  I'm glad you enjoyed it.

I got this as a gift for Christmas and thoroughly enjoyed it.
There's a little bit of everything that makes it such fun to watch.
There's the  overachiever dreaming of breaking through to his next goal.
There's skipper who can't get over a bad memory.
There's the braggadocio player who'll go to any lengths to cover his smallness.
There's the lover boy and his conquests.
Through it all there's some real nice flying sequences and great graphics.
The creators wanted to make the flying sequences as believable as possible and I believe they did it.
Even the sequence on the flysinower were just as nice a the rest.
I'll be watching this again and will enjoy discovering some detail I missed befor.

This was mainly due to the fact that my Family and I enjoyed the Cars movies, both of them, and frankly I viewed Planes as ""Cars with wings and props.""

To be honest: that's what it is.

That doesn't devalue the movie because the main theme is still present.  As often as we have seen it, the idea that you can be more and that one should attempt to fulfill their Dream(s) is the main point.  That the protagonist has a good, healthy, cast of supportive friends ""along the way"" is at this point Par for Pixar stories.

NOT a bad story/ movie, just could have been more...",1388188800,,680,4.232558139534884

Technically the movie is fine, Pixar never lowers those standards. But while every character in Cars had their own personality and stayed true to that, in Planes you find a character against the hero becoming a racer, and then 10 minutes later rebuilding hom to race.

The plot elements made almost no sense, and many seemed tacked on to satisfy studio 'notes' about elements they wanted in the movie.

Anytime Lassiter is not in charge of a Pixar film, you pretty much know that the studio hacks will ruin it. He's seems to be the only one with enough clout to overrule their meddling.

""Planes"" uses the device of a round-the-world race to set up some great, if sometimes too brief, fantasy flying sequences (with maybe a few shots inspired by Ron Fricke's ""Baraka""/""Samsara""?), and the plot surprised me at times.  The script could have used a little more polishing, the character of Dusty was a complete cipher to me, and things sometimes came a little to easy to him: even in a world of talking aircraft, turning a crop duster into a racer by tightening a set screw on the engine and giving it a pep talk seemed a bit much.

3267400,5,7799144076,"Planes is a great movie for kids and adults alike.  Appropriate for all ages.  It deals with issues that are a little deeper than ""Cars.""  A few of those issues and topics are deception, mind over matter, overcoming fears, etc.  The scenes where Dusty is racing and particularly the one where he crashes into the ocean are quite thrilling.

The planes in the international race are from different countries, and ethnic stereotypes are touched upon, so just be aware of that.  You may want to decide how to talk to your child about it ahead of time.  The most overt reference is probably when British Bulldog declares, ""I don't cry!  I'm British!""  The rest is more subtle.  My son loves all things ""Planes,"" and we have a lot of the toys.  I personally wasn't troubled by the stereotypes, but someone else may be.

We had homemade popcorn, turned off all the lights, turned on the big screen and the 3D... outstanding fun and a great time was had by all.

We had family over that day & I knew the gift was arriving that day but they actually left before the gift got here. They arrived for celebrations around 2pm & eventually left at just after 9pm since they had a long drive home. I was horrified & embarrassed since I kept looking up the tracking number & it didn't say anything past the 'on truck since about 5am that day'. The package came around 10pm, I think it may have been after but I was in bed when they delivered. I felt bad for my nephew & I felt bad for the driver (he looked exhausted).

Yes, yes, I know it's a kids' movie.  But, believing Planes to be a Pixar film, I expected a multi-layered movie with smart dialogue to engage even adult viewers, and this was certainly not that. Even with its being a non-Pixar Disney movie, I would have expected more.

Planes could have gone the same way but lands on its nose in front of the aviation crowd. A Corvette can be the fastest thing on the race track but a crop duster for sure can't blast by a flight of F14's.... Or an unlimited Reno race Mustang. Then there are the propellers... Delightful aircraft likenesses but then the producers seemed to have a ""Propeller"" department staffed by artists who never quite learned how the darned things worked. A Mustang taxis by- I swear the prop is turning backwards. Another race plane has twin props on it's nose. They're supposed to rotate in opposite directions. They don't. Dusty gets a spiffy new 4-bladed propeller during his phoenix-like rebuild. You have to notice the blades are angled in opposite directions, canceling each other out. Who let this stuff slip by?

Cars had it right. Planes could have worked the same magic but has its wings clipped by an animation staff who seem never to have looked at a real one. Their loss.....And ours.",1387929600,,1226,4.645161290322581

Was disappointed by certain overlaps with Cars, the tow/fuel truck, Ford Mustang commentator (only one commentator not three to save money?). Didn't like the African American voice chosen for the Air Races organizer, as if the Reno Air Races are popular with the ghetto speaking brothers? Seemed more of a gratuitous way to include a cliche sassy black characture as not to leave out any audience demographic. Aargh, was distracting to the narrative for me.

You could tell this was the Formula Film to beat all formula films. Make 'me as fast as you can eh Disney? Money saved at every turn with this film (only 50 million budget). A total sellout to the Pixar's ""Cars"" franchise, super quick buck made, move on. It was directed and written by inexpensive television peeps who had never helmed a feature film before. Same as with ""Brave"", and the results show.

The screenplay was also close to the original Cars movie, which seemed a missed opportunity. And as everyone knows, this screenplay was predictable beyond belief.

So glad they kept the Pixar name off this piece. But John? Lasseter? Booby? As executive producer and head of story I've grown to expect more from you. Yikes. I guess not everything can be ""Tangled"".",1387929600,,1337,4.928888888888889

Well, in short, the studio has expanded the universe of Cars and made a film about talking airplanes. The simple story is about Dusty Crophopper, a crop duster afraid of heights, who is dreaming of winning a prestigious around-the-world flying race.

The story is predictable and characters clichd, but the flying sequences are dynamic and visually appealing, though not the best of its kind. The film has a few thrilling action set-pieces that could have been much better with more time and details (or budget). The entire film feels rushed and by the numbers.

I love the personalisation of objects that only disney can achieve!) is not born to be a racer but that does not stop him from aiming for higher things in life. He desires to fly around the world and win a contest. The inevitable outcome belies a neat story that you could suceed without being singularly indifferent to others in the race which in itself could be an analogy to life. If ""cars"" was all about humility and dignity, "" planes"" is about being stubborn and level headed in measured apropriateness, to pursue ones passion.",1387497600,,688,4.6016260162601625

I loved the way this movie started, how we got to see him fighting for his dream long before we even jumped into the movie. It wasn't a movie about training to be good, it was a movie about giving your all. He didn't luck into fame like others in movies that meant to be ""inspirational"", he fought for it.

I did see the story-line with his trainer, a plan that only had one main flight. I didn't see him coming to the rescue in the fashion that he did. I give them snaps for surprising me on that.

I wasn't a fan of how hard the male villain went to try and kill the main hero. In cars he only made one attempt and it wasn't huge. This evil plan was the definition of evil and sneaky, hands down.

At the end, and this is the spoiler, I didn't like that he over came his fear of heights and that was his real reason for victory. He came so close to winning without overcoming that fear 100%, even with everything that he went through along the way. I felt like he either should have lost, but had a moral victory like in Cars 1, or that he should have won without having to fly high into the sky. I knew that this was the ending that was coming, but I feel I would have felt more inspired and like he was more of a success if he had done it his way 100% and not like all the other planes did it.",1387238400,,1543,3.9044585987261144

3267598,4,7799144076,"I walked into this movie knowing full well what I was getting into. A direct-to-video film promoted to the big screen that was produced by Disney (not Pixar) capitalizing on the success of Cars. While it is by far not a prefect film, or even a great film, it hits enough of the right marks to make it a worthwhile show to watch with my son. There may not be enough to keep all of the adults entertained, but it's a far cry from lots of the mindless kid's films that always pop up.

The story is about a crop duster with aspirations to race in a highly coveted world marathon and with the help of an old veteran and his mechanic friend he gets his shot. Even though the writers of Planes were trying to not to remake Cars the similarities are there. The race theme in of itself is undeniably familiar. Then add to that the main villain being a competitor in the same race like in Cars and our hero getting advice from a plane many years his elder sounds a lot like the McQueen/Doc Hudson relationship. While these similarities are more just on the surface (and Cars really went beyond this theme for most of the film) they are indeed there.

As I said before this movie was produced by Disney, and not Pixar. While Cars director John Lasseter is the executive producer that's about the only connection aside from the setting. This shows in the writing. While the movie has heart and the story moves at a decent pace the level of quality is indeed a few notches lower. For one the story pushes that tired old comedy relief character Disney can't help but put in all of their movies. While Cars had Mater that character actually contributed to the story and emotional payoff. In Planes their comic relief is in El Chupacabra. Although there are two scenes where this character lends something to the scenery, if you take him completely out of the film you would hardly miss a step. And worse of all he's not really funny. Actually the entire film isn't really all that funny. Don't expect a lot of chuckles.

I feel that there is a lot more one and two dimensional characterizations on this film, and makes the world feel rather thin. A lot of the playful backdrops found in Cars are gone. The bad guys are just plain bad and there are some substandard caricatures being played as well. The animation is pretty good, but  not Pixar good. The planes and some backdrops seems to have more attention to detail, but then you will look at a forklift talking or some other animation and you can tell not a lot of effort was put into it. I get that this was supposed to be a straight to video affair, and in that arena I would be impressed. However you move it to the big screen then a company like Disney should know better and spend more time on it.

So that was the bad stuff. What about the good? Like I said the story may be simple, but there is a decent amount of heart. Disney did have the good sense to tone down the cliches' that plague Disney animated films over the decades. While the movie is not funny it is fun. There is some real plot progression going on even if it's on a basic level. There are a lot of children's films that are just plain stupid. They are written stupidly with the expectation that the viewers are too young to understand (Disney is just a guilty of this as other productions). Planes  doesn't go down to that level. It gives the young audience the respect deserved and the older audience enough to pass it as ""not stupid"". I think the movie gets a hard time because it is performing under the shadow of Cars, which is a far superior production. Take that out of the equation and you will set your sights more realistic.

So the movie is good enough. What about the disk? The Blu-Ray transfer is spot on and looks great. It's not a reference disc, but it is clear and crisp with some high definition eye candy to enjoy here and there. The surround audio doesn't completely envelop you, but you do enjoy a fair amount of atmospheric effects. The Blu-Ray movie looks and sounds fine, but the extras and special features make me feeling like I'm being short changed. Here are the features as they stand:

Exclusive Musical Scene: Franz's Song - This is a deleted scene that has been fully produced. It's cute and short. A little Disney-ish so no loss it not being on the finished product.

Klay's Flight Plan - This is the best feature by far. It is less a making of documentary and more like a personal commentary from the director on his love for airplanes and the appreciation he had for the content. There is a little bit of information on the making of the film, but it's mostly a love letter to the awesome machines.

Deleted Scenes - Two in fact. One is only in story board mode and is part of Dusty's training. The other pre-visual animation at the Taj Mahal.

Meet the Racers - Mini cartons of a few of the main plane characters. El Cu and Ripslinger's play like a commercial. Dusty's is like a Pixar short-short and Ishani is a music video styled short. There are very brief.

Top 10 Fliers - A rather messy educational video listing 10 historic pilots. Can't really see any rhyme or reason to how they organize this list, but at least it tries to teach something.

Info - This special features is simply the disclaimer notes about the commentaries (that don't exist) that you see before the film. Yes. This is listed as a special feature on the disk. Don't ask me why.

I would have liked to have seen a real behind the scenes featurette with interviews with staff and shots of the voice actors in action, but that is not to be.

Planes is not a bad film. It entertains the kids well enough while not insulting them, and there should be enough to at least keep most adults from falling asleep. All things considered it's better than expected. Maybe for most of you it may be best to wait and see if the price goes down. However if you have kids that saw it in the theaters and they enjoyed it there should be no reason not to let them enjoy it now.",1386633600,,5982,4.366906474820144

Critics make a big deal that it's the same as ""Cars"" but for planes, and I disagree. This one is about an underdog, this one is not tying-up the lead's role so much with a love interest (although that is secondary). This one is far more from the perspective of the individual conquering his own internal challenges. Yes, there are secondary characters that are cut-out from ones in ""Cars."" What I am not hearing from critics is that this is closer to a storyline that takes us on the road for an adventure. I think the geography lesson, alone, is worth it for kids (geography is such a weak subject area for young people.) This one is far more about not allowing oneself to be stuck in a stereotype. Its about taking risks, even when that means we need to face what scares us most.

3267626,4,7799144076,"""Planes"" Takes ""Cars"" Franchise into the Sky on Blu-ray

If you have a franchise that people love and you know it, there's only one thing to do. Exploit it by coming up with ways to expand on the concept to maximize the amount of money you can make from it. Disney took its ""Cars"" series into the sky with the Pixar-less ""Planes"" and instead of soaring high, the movie coasted along the lower atmosphere. With its release on Blu-ray and DVD, the film gets another chance to charm families in the comfort of their own homes.

A crop-dusting plane named Rusty (Dane Cook) dreams of being a racer. There's only one problem with this: he's afraid of heights. A veteran fighter named Skipper takes Dusty under his wing and trains him to enter a prestigious race. Dusty's determination to participate in the event inspires his competitors to either love or hate him, leaving the outcome of the contest a mystery.

""Planes"" is presented in 1080p high-resolution at its original aspect ratio of 1.78:1. The picture is clean and the color palette makes each character and its surroundings pop out of the screen at you. Would we expect any less from the ever-resourceful Disney studios?

The DTS-HD Master Audio 7.1 sound for ""Planes"" puts home viewers right in the middle of all the action. You'll be flying high on cloud nine as the sonic blasts of racing planes and the energetic soundtrack blend together to thrill the senses. Coupled with the exceptional animation, the stunning audio quality will complete a phenomenal family experience.

The ""Planes"" Blu-ray comes with a few special features. It contains deleted scenes, one of which is a completed musical scene. There's also making-of and ""Meet the Racers"" featurettes. An educational featurette which counts down the top 10 real-life fliers rounds out the bonus material.

Those expecting Pixar animation quality from ""Planes"" will no doubt be disappointed. It doesn't have the same essence and depth audiences have come to expect from the studio that brought us ""Cars,"" ""Toy Story,"" and ""The Incredibles."" However, it will please the target demographic it was designed to. Parents might be disappointed in its presentation, but children won't notice the difference as they're captivated by the excitement on the screen.",1386374400,,2271,5.010610079575597

3267636,2,7799144076,"Warning: some spoilers follow, but are necessary to explain my review.

This movie seems to have a very narrow age range in mind: kids aged between seven and ten years old.  Kids aged under about six years old will not understand much of this movie, which has a complicated plot and lots of it uses concepts they won't understand (sabotage, commercial sponsorship, running out of fuel over the ocean, Dusty's mentor lying to him until he discovers the truth, two henchmen planes that harass Dusty).  There is also a few scary scenes: when a Navy fighter squadron of talking planes dives on warships and gets completely blown out of the sky and when Rusty flies through an open-ocean storm wave and cripples his propeller before apparently drowning in the dark.  Kids older than ten will become bored, because of the attempt to convey too many sub-plots.  I was also slightly offended by the El Chupacabra character with his strong stereotypes of Mexican wrestlers (""I swish my cape at you Now you are shamed"") and his romancing of one of female ""exotic"" planes.

On the plus side, the plane designs are charming and I'm sure the toys will sell well.",1386374400,,1149,4.748743718592965

My nephews got bored within minutes while they can watch Cars over and over again and still get excited each time. I can't even get them to finish this movie.
I love Disney and I love Pixar, but this movie was boring and it seemed like the animation team did great, but the story/acting sucked.  Dane Cook was a bad choice for the main character, Fluffy wasn't able to be as funny as he normally is since this was for kids, and the others were people I'd never heard of, nor did I like their voice acting. Teri Hatcher did a good job with what they gave her though.
The writing got complicated; I sat there thinking, do they expect kids to understand this? Or do they think kids aren't listening to the words? At one point Teri's character makes an automotive (?) joke that even the other characters in the movie didn't get; there was alot of plane lingo as well as alot of science. Not much humor. I was bored and had to make myself finish it because I was hoping it would get better. It didn't.
I predicted the ending after the first few minutes; unlike other Pixar films (and even some Disney films), there was no major plot twist. There was a minor one that was quickly resolved.

3267670,4,7799144076,"""The world of 'Cars' takes flight in 'Planes'"", proclaims the blurb on the cover of Disney's new Pixar-like animated feature. We could only wish. Pixar produced films with superior technical qualities, but was best known for finely crafted stories that appealed to young and old alike. Planes displays great computer animation, but has a hit-and-miss story that appeals to children while leaving adults largely out of the fun.

The story revolves around Dusty, a crop dusting plane who wants to be an air racer, and he gets his chance to compete in a round-the-world race against champions from many nations. This allows for not only slightly exotic character development, but for great displays of scenery as well. The settings are familiar from Cars, (a rural backwater community, inhabited by rubes and relics), as are the sidekicks (numerous small forklifts as workers, a not-so-bright truck as a friend, and an experienced old timer as a mentor). There is one sly reference to the tractor-tipping scene in Cars, as Dusty the crop duster is sightseeing in India. He comments on the many tractors wandering the landscape below, and his Indian companion says ""they are sacred in our country"".

Although lacking the subtlety and storyline depth of Pixar's best, the three and four year-olds I watched this film with thought it was fascinating. It was colorful, fast moving, and flew literally around the world with plenty of moments of beauty and peril that kept the kids on the edge of their seats.

3267675,3,7799144076,"The creators of Disneys Cars took to the air this past summer with Disneys Planes. While Cars is heavy on sentiment and story line, Planes soars with action and fun. The movie wastes no time getting into the action as it opens with the eye-popping race sequence.

Theres no time for your kids attentions to drift with this one. In no time Dusty Crophopper goes from daydreaming Midwesterner to headline-grabbing aerial racer. Where the movie lacks in overall humor it makes up for in high-intensity action and fast-paced storytelling.

Storyline
From above the world of Cars comes Disneys Planes, an action-packed 3D animated comedy adventure featuring Dusty (voice of Dane Cook), a plane with dreams of competing as a high-flying air racer. But Dustys not exactly built for racingand he happens to be afraid of heights. So he turns to a seasoned naval aviator who helps Dusty qualify to take the defending champ of the race circuit. Dustys courage is put to the ultimate test as he aims to reach heights he never dreamed possible, giving a spellbound world the inspiration to soar.

Overall
Disneys Planes, like its predecessors, has some positive underlying themes. Your kids will learn about teamwork, overcoming your fears, not settling for less than your best and putting others above your own pursuits. There are a few phrases that you might find mildly objectionable, but I think theyll go over most kids heads.",1385942400,,1418,4.974683544303797

3267686,3,7799144076,"High above the world of Cars comes a low-altitude spin-off that never quite takes off. That's right, three aviation puns in one sentence. And if that has you rolling your eyes, brace yourself for director Klay Hall's Planes, a well-intentioned family-friendly racer sure to entertain younger kids, and just the kids. There's nothing particularly terrible about the film, and it's certainly not as bad as you've probably heard. Still, the animation lacks the fresh coat of paint typical of most theatrically released CG-animated spectacles, Jeffrey M. Howard's screenplay relies heavily on familiar clich after familiar clich and, sorry to say, the voice cast isn't all that special. Not so surprising considering the pseudo-sequel began its life as a DisneyToon Studios direct-to-video project and was only later promoted to feature film status at the last minute. And yet Planes remains a decidedly direct-to-video adventure, with Hall and company distilling elements of Cars and Cars 2 into a cute, harmless, ultimately unremarkable underdog story most parents have sat through a hundred times before.
When a crop duster with big dreams named Dusty (Dane Cook) defies all odds and narrowly qualifies for the globe-spanning Wings Across the World race, he finds himself jetting from New York to Iceland, Germany, India, Nepal, Shanghai, Mexico and back across the United States. To win, he'll have to out-maneuver and outrace an array of international fliers, including mean-spirited reigning champ, Ripslinger (Roger Craig Smith), and his toadies, Ned and Zed (Gabriel Iglesias); French-Canadian racer, Rochelle (Julia Louis-Dreyfus); stuffy Brit, Bulldog (John Cleese); passionate Mexican Gee Bee, El Chupacabra (Carols Alazraqui); and Indian love interest Ishani (Priyanka Chopra). And it'll take everything Dusty's got, along with a little help from his friends: best friend Chug (Brad Garrett), mechanic Dottie (Teri Hatcher), reluctant mentor Skipper Riley (Stacey Keach), forklift Sparky (Danny Mann), Super Hornet duo Bravo and Echo (Top Gun alumni Val Kilmer and Anthony Edwards), and others who rally behind the crop-dusting upstart.

Despite Hall and Howard's best efforts -- and the two do make a concerted effort -- there's not a lot to Planes that isn't derived from the series' core films. From the quaint but sharply penned Cars comes the clash of vehicular cultures and destinies, the racing scene, a fish out of water adventure, a romantic subplot, a crusty old racing mentor haunted by his past, a cocky rival desperate to win at all costs (he's even green and black, just like ol' Chick Hicks), several sidekicks in the making, and, of course, a glimpse into the eerie but amusing world of sentient cars with no human masters. (Why is Dusty dusting crops exactly? Other than the fact that he's a crop duster?) From the maligned Cars 2 comes the international hotspots, a colorful cast of multinational racers (each one showcasing a bigger stereotype than the last), the thrills and chills of a worldwide race mixed with... you get the idea. Planes is at its finest when imagining how a society of planes would function in the larger Cars world, and when humanizing its aeros and autos. But sparks of imagination don't seem to come as freely or frequently as before, and Dustys rise to fame is far more derivative than it is original.

Ironically, had Planes never dared to dream more than a direct-to-video dream, it would have been more successful. The film struggles to inflate itself to theatrical proportions, reaching for the stars and barely lifting off the ground. There are laughs to be had, an exciting but predictable race to follow, and enough lovable personalities -- yes, even Cook's Dusty -- to keep the movie in the air. It rarely soars, though, and even at its best, tends to skim the surface of its potential. Adults would do well to watch the disc's behind-the-scenes featurette, ""Klay's Flight Plan"", and only then giving Planes a go. Realizing how much of the film a personal passion project was for Hall makes for a richer experience. The story still only skims the surface, but the heart it proudly wears on its wings suddenly begins to shine that much brighter. Kids, on the other hand, needn't invest any prep time. Planes will strike anyone under ten as a fun, wondrous race across the skies of one of their favorite animated universes; one with a few life lessons worth reinforcing. As family entertainment geared for the grade school set goes, it excels. As a Pixar spin-off, though, it lacks a certain level of magic, wit and refinement.

Disney's Planes looks great on Blu-ray, with a pristine 1080p/AVC-encoded presentation. Colors are bright, vibrant and playful, and bathed in convincing light and shadow. Primaries are strong and black levels inky, with consistent contrast and unhindered clarity. Detail is quite striking, with crisp edges and exacting textures, and aliasing isn't a concern. Perhaps more thrilling is Planes' DTS-HD Master Audio 7.1 surround track, even if the film's original sound design isn't really all that engrossing. Dialogue is crystal clear and perfectly prioritized, without anything in the way of muffled or buried lines. Voices tend to float in the mix, but no more so than in most animated films. LFE output, meanwhile, embraces every engine chug and roar, propeller drone, and dive-bomb attack, making the most of the adventure's every racing sequence.

Planes would have been better off abandoning the racing scene of the first two Cars movies and focusing instead on something new to the series' universe. Private and commercial aviation, the Air Force, the daring rescue work glimpsed in the trailer for next years Planes: Fire & Rescue... just a few of the tantalizing possibilities that would have set Hall's spin-off free. Not that kids will care. Younger children will have a blast, if only because they won't notice just how much Planes begs, borrows and lifts from a hundred other underdog stories. Disney's Blu-ray release is more satisfying, fortunately, with an excellent video presentation and involving DTS-HD Master Audio 7.1 surround track. Its supplemental package is much too direct-to-video for a film that earned a theatrical release, but complaints end there. Bottom line? You could do a whole lot worse this holiday season. Planes is perfect for the kiddies, even if it will prove somewhat disappointing for parents.",1385942400,3,6425,5.175

3267692,5,7799144076,"Though in many ways this had a similar story line to the first Cars movie (rookie desires to win the big race), it still feels fresh.  Dusty Crophopper desires to be more than what his original purpose was.  He wishes to enter an around-the-world race that usually is reserved for planes that are built for racing.  When he manages to make the cut, he has to deal with the prejudices of being a ""farm boy.""  Aside from the challenges he faces from the difficult race and his fear of heights (imagine a plane afraid of heights), he also has to put up with the dirty trickery from other racers who don't play fair.  However, he has old and new friends helping him out:  the grounded Skipper (a war hero who suffers post traumatic stress), Dusty's best friend Chug (forgetful and big-mouthed), the nerdy girl whose name I've forgotten but is just as endearing, and the Spanish plane whose name I've also forgotten.  The characters are memorable...the names aren't.

In many ways, I like this story better than Cars.  It is more exciting and adventurous, since it shows the various obstacles Dusty has to face traveling around the world.  Dusty is a much more likable character than Lightening McQueen was.  The film actually promotes many good morals:  doing it anyway despite what anyone tells you and no matter how great the odds, always be a good guy (it does pay in the end), among others.",1385856000,3,1390,4.651639344262295

Although it looks the part, it just simply doesn't have the ""heart"" that the original Cars film had, but it will hold a child's attention fine enough. It uses much of the original Cars plot lines and character development to tell a similar story.

When viewing animated features, I base my opinion on whether or not the voice actors brought excitement and range to their characters. This film was awful in that department. The only characters with any sort of inflection and emotion in their voices was Chug (Brad Garrett) and El Chupacabra (Carlos Alazraqui). Everyone else was flat and uninspired.

Cars (the first one) was an amazing story with amazing and believable (as believable as talking cars can get) characterizations.  A real family story projecting the importance of humans, friendship and love as truly more valuable and long-lasting than the so empty, short lived pleasures of fame and fortune.  Cars 2 was expected to be less than Cars 1 - and it was, but it got away with a good old fashioned 007 plot, with plenty of intrigue well developed until the end when we find out who the bad guy really is - not as in depth in meaning as the first, but we survive because - the ever famous American addiction - it's interesting and funny.  In planes, however, nothing is new.  Nothing needs to be discovered - honestly, the story line was just really void of depth, reminded me of one of the 1/2 hour cartoons on kids tv.  Kids will like it, but like ever so much of food these days, the story seemed a bit full of corn syrup and additives with just enough nutrition to convince a body it might be food.....

Mad at myself for not following my rule to always rent first. Silly me assumed it would be at least approaching the quality of a Disney Pixar movie.
I highly recommend renting this one before buying.
(Small side note, as an adult who has watched several Dane Cook movies, I just couldn't reconcile Dane's voice as the kind and moral hero in a children's movie. Also didn't enjoy several adult aimed jokes that were borderline inappropriate, and really disliked a scene where Dusty lands at one of the stops at what appears to be a bar and the barmaid says something along the lines of ""You are sad.

Because the discs all work great, the case looks the same as every other Disney Blu-ray case (which is a good thing, they are always high quality), and the movie makes for great 3D reference material on my 3D TV and 3D projector.

But when you analyze the movie itself, it is quite disappointing. It's hard to believe the non-Pixar-labeled Disney movies like Tangled and Wreck-It Ralph can turn out so good, but then this spinoff of Pixar's great Cars world turned out so poor. Simply put, the story is as generic and predictable as you can get, and the characters are poorly developed and highly forgettable. The humor is geared to children instead of to everyone, which is why I usually love Pixar movies. They really should have waited on this film until they good get the talent of the actual Pixar studio to be more involved.

3267748,4,7799144076,"Before I begin my review I want to point out that Amazon has a policy of grouping ALL reviews of ALL formats of a film together so it is important to do the following when using Amazon reviews of films: Take note as to whether the reviewer is reviewing the theater release (you can sort reviews by newest first) the DVD or the Bluray. That is always the best guide. With that said, here is my review of the BLURAY.

PLANES is  for all intents and purposes  an aerial version of the two CARS films. In fact there is a preview of the Planes sequel (direct to DVD) on this set. PLANES was probably aimed at the Direct-to-DVD market originally but they added 3-D and were able to market it to those theaters as well.

As to the  91-minute film itself, there are enough reviews here to guide you (as for me, it was basically the same old story about finding you future success). Ill discuss the BD and bonuses.

First the BD looks great! Wonderful images and sound.

The bonuses include:
A deleted song (with live introduction by the Director Klay Hall and one of the films producers. This last 3:18.
TWO deleted scenes shown as storyboards  introductions by the two above (8 minutes)
Meet the Flyers  - introduces the characters (1:17)
Top Ten Flyers  a 5-minute piece  done as a sports show acknowledging those such as Howard Hughes, Jimmy Doolittle and (honorably) the Tuskegee Airmen.
Klays Flight Plan a 15 minute piece showing the direct taking his 2 teenage sons to see famous antique planes and taking rides in them. After watching this, youll know exactly why John Rassiter chose Hall to direct this film.
While, its primarily a kids film there are a lot of jokes that only the adults may get ( I love the Flying for Dummies book, for instance.)

So its not a masterpiece but worth an hour or so to spend with your kids. Hey, maybe theill want to visit your local airport after seeing this.

I hope you found this review both informative and helpful.

3267772,4,7799144076,"I like it. Most people are saying that its not a Pixar thing well they kind of right and kind of wrong. The names have changed I think Pixar is now apart of Disney Animation so no Its Pixar but all the people that were there at Pixar are with Disney Animation I think I don't have hard facts just the fact that I saw a photo of PIxar employees with the founders and then saw the same photo for Walt Disney Animation Studios.

About the movie I liked it with all the references to the VF-84 Joly Rodgers (a really good assault wing) the Corsair (an awesome warplane for back in the day) I think I saw I BF-109 in there too. I loved the entire sequence of the Flysienhower ... awesome.

Also noticed they Sinbad (saw him live) Cedric the Entertainer and Gabriel Igleses (hard to pick out didn't sound like himself at times.) Fluffy did good.

Its a movie that would entertain the kids as well as the adults. My only gripe is that story line seems a little familiar with that of a story line involving a racing snail. Not exactly the same but kind of similar. The movie did have its moments (like all movies) at bit predictable here and there but nevertheless still enjoyable.

Other than that I liked it and will be watching it for a third time in less than 24 hours. Its defiantly worth renting. I couldn't recommend you to buy it because I'm still trying to decide that for myself. :)",1385164800,,1384,4.291187739463601

3267778,1,7799144076,"Wow.  I was not impressed with this movie at all!  As a matter of fact, I was bored to death....and totally amazed at how bad this movie was!

Planes seems to parallel cars - yet is not nearly as cute, funny or memorable as Cars.  First of all... it's WAY TOO SERIOUS!!!  This movie is totally lacking any ""silly factor"".  I know, I know...there's no Mater, of course.  But that's the problem.  This movie NEEDS a Mater!

The character in Cars are literally oozing with personality...whereas in Planes, they're not.  They are just cookie-cutter clichs of characters.  I never warmed up to any of them, since they were all totally forgettable.

Plus....the plot?  This movie is just one big race...that's it!  That's it!  There's no warm and cozy Radiator Springs-like story to break up the tedious race sequences.

Tedious.  That's the word I would apply to this movie.  What a terrible word!  I couldn't wait for the movie to end!  Now I have read that some toddlers and younger children enjoyed the movie, which I am very surprised to hear!  I would think they would have all been bored and fidgety - I know my daughter would have been at that age!  Although my daughter is a bit older, she still enjoys a good Disney movie.  However, after watching only a tiny slice of Planes, she lost interest and sought out the computer.

I'm sorry.  I hate to give such a negative review, I really do.  However, these are my honest feelings.  The movie isn't funny, at all.  Okay, maybe you sort of chuckle a few times...but that's it!  As for the characters...I can't even remember any of them, and I just saw the movie last night!

My advice?  Watch on Pay per View first to see if your kids are grabbed by this bland movie.  Who knows?  They might like it - then you can buy it for them.  But I will warn you, as the parent, you will probably get a bit bored and fidgety.......longing desperately for Mater to come chugging across the screen!",1385078400,3,1936,4.5

3267793,2,7799144076,"This wasn't supposed to be a ""kids"" film. It was billed an advertised as a ""family"" film, just like every other Pixar film. Unfortunately, this film is for kids, but not all kids. This is definitely, without a doubt, the first stinker out of Pixar, and yes they know it. This thing got pushed through production as more of a buffer/money maker to compensate for the big time money loser films Disney made in this production cycle. This is a real middle finger to the people who have supported Pixar and Disney for so long. They promote this like its a big full blown production when they really knew that this was going to be a direct to DVD budget and quality film. Unlike other Disney/Pixar films, this is not enjoyable to watch for most adults, and a large amount of children. Its just boring and bland. Its like flavorless ice cream, looks good until you taste it, then its just hard to finish. Hugely disappointing, both in quality and substance, and in the way it was presented to us, the audience. The whole thing is just a lie to line their pockets while making us thing this would be another special addition to the Disney/Pixar lineup. This isn't worth renting, definitely not worth buying, and quite honestly, the best thing about it it the poster. So do yourself a favor, look at the poster, and pretend it was awesome, because thats as good as its going to get.",1384992000,4,1374,4.522088353413655

3267796,4,7799144076,"The trailers for this film made me a skeptic but, I watched Planes for the first time from a Redbox rental last night while my kids were in bed and while I was recovering from my root canal, done earlier in the day.  I had so-so likings for Disney's Planes.  I did not like how Dusty was too similar to the Owen Wilson voiced Lightning McQueen character and I did not like how Skipper was too similar to the Paul Newman voiced Doc Hudson character.

Today my 12-year-old son watched Planes with his 9-year-old sister.  The enthusiasm barometer from my kids was way up, while watching Planes, compared to their first viewings of Cars and Cars 2.  I guess all those times I took my kids to the National Museum of the United States Air Force, at Wright Patterson Air Force Base in Dayton, cultivated their aviation enthusiasm and they were ripe for watching Disney's Planes, today.

My son got teary-eyed when Skipper recounted his painful battle experience in War 2.  My son also got teary-eyed when the other racing planes started donating replacement parts to Dusty.

Watching the movie with two kids that were loving it made me enjoy it more.  Then, the DVD's Special Features won my heart over with a section about the great vintage war birds, including the P-51D Mustang.

So, today, I ordered Disney's Planes (Blu-ray/DVD, 2013, 2-Disc Set, Including Digital Copy).

This film and special features cultivates my existing love for aviation.  I would have liked to seen more expensive high-powered actors doing the principal roles in this movie but I respect Disney/Pixar's choice to cut production costs since aviation movies don't do all that great at the box office.  Planes was not a block buster but, it did produce a respectable profit to cost ratio.  It's worth seeing for the first time.  I suggest renting it before deciding to buy it.",1384905600,,1846,4.761006289308176

However, THIS DVD can be unlocked in ITunes which can be viewed on the different Apple products without an Internet connection! It should not matter but I purchased the multidisc version.

One scene found in the bonus features, the musical scene of Franz should not have been cut from the final film, it would have added more fun to the overall movie.  My grandchildren and all adults in the family watch the other Pixar movies over and over. Planes does not hold the attention of  the targeted audience as the other Pixar films do and do not see this one as being a favorite among the family.  After all the hype and delays on the release of the movie, very disappointed with the final film.  I hope the additional Planes trilogy improve in the overall movie content.  Cars, and Cars II for instance has been watched so many times in my home by the Grandchildren, we have had to order two additional copies as the DVD's just wore out due to numerous scratches by the children, but had no problem in replacing them as they are enjoyable favorites.  Also do not understand why Pixar cuts the scenes from the final films that are used in the clips advertising the new movies coming out?

3267817,2,7799144076,"My kids really enjoy going to the movies (currently aged 2 - 6) and this year there have been several that they've seen that they have liked.  My boys are huge fans of the Cars movies, and we thought this would be a no-brainer.  Unfortunately, this movie blurs the lines between the consistent Pixar and the likes of the direct to DVD sequels that Disney makes.  What made Planes even more misleading in this area is that a few big names with Pixar are associated with it, making it seem like it was a Pixar movie in all but name.

Unfortunately, Planes really has no reason to exist.  The premise of the movie is great, it's a sky high version of the little train that could.  The world created for it is also a great idea and there is a lot of potential based on the foundations built by the Cars series.  However, the actual script was horrible.  There was no real coherent story.  The characters are unrelatable and it feels like the script writers expected you to already be familiar with them as they are sort of stand-ins for Cars characters (with less charm.)  You might say that I'm expecting too much out of a children's movie.  When I wrote this, I'm actually looking at it from the perspective of my four year old who can go into a trance and would probably be capable of sitting still through a marathon of Cars, Cars 2, and Mater's Tall Tales with no problem.  What I'm saying is that Planes is far below the level of what some people consider to be Pixar's worst movies (I personally like Cars, but recognize that the plot is ""a loving tribute to"" Doc Hollywood.)

The humor really wasn't great, it was full of racial stereotypes if you're against those sorts of things (I didn't think they were too bad, but some folks are more sensitive than I am), and there were only a few off-color moments such as when the main character is basically castrated, although I think they were going more for a waxing-like experience.

So if your kids are Cars fanatics, you should probably watch it once, maybe when it comes on Disney Jr. without you paying extra for it.",1384819200,2,2071,4.444444444444445
3267818,2,7799144076,"This movie would have been good as the visuals were excellent and some of the action was fun to watch, however, the shameless similarities to Cars and the original story line where too much to bear. We have the down and out hero who has to fight to win, the old grumpy character that makes him turn around and be better, the female interest and even the foe are similar characters to Cars. They did nothing original here at all to set this apart from Cars. They didn't even try to do anything different which leads me to believe Disney is nothing without Pixar when these types of films are created. I sat there watching it just waiting for it to ""take off"" (pun intended). It started out too slow and never really got that exciting. If I never saw Cars it might have been a good film but there are too many retreads of other movies out there and this is yet another one. There are much better animated films with more original storylines. I have watched Cars a dozen times with the kids and would easily sit through it again and again before wasting time watching this even a second time.

As I suspected, Reed is much more excited about the movie now that he can watch it like normal without the 3D effects. He has watched it over and over again and it has become his new favorite movie. He is already making a list of all the Planes that he wants for Christmas.

Personally, I was a bit disappointed as I thought that it was too much like Cars, only with Planes. The storyline was so similar that it lacked originality. Its still well made because its Disney and it has its usual array of colorful amazing characters. I just wish the storyline wasn't much like Cars.

But I was very pleasantly surprised. The story was a bit predictable - ""local boy makes good"", the crusty old codger who eventually warms up and helps the kid and finds personal redemption for the errors of his past, etc- but I'd say it worked pretty well.

I know enough about historical aircraft- and aircraft in general- that I appreciated the different planes that were shown in the movie. Thought there were some really interesting choices- the DH88 for example, voiced by John Cleese, the Corsair, by Stacy Keach, and of course a Gee Bee racer, by Carlos Alazraqui. There were enough 'in-jokes' that I was laughing out loud (but according to the kids, I was the only adult laughing...)

I also remember Dusty and Ishani, flying near the Taj Mahal and observing graceful glider- like birds.... lovely image, clever replacement of animals from the ""Planes"" world to replicate nature.

Had this film come out BEFORE ""Cars"", I can't help but think it would have got a lot of praise for its animation, technical references, and possibly even its plot. Is it a bit too derivative of ""Cars""? Maybe, but ""Cars"" was a difficult film to top- look at the reviews its sequel got.

3267848,2,7799144076,"""Planes"" finds Disney, and John Lasster in particular, revisiting the world of ""Cars"".  Lassiter, one of the masterminds of Pixar, came up with the original concept of ""Cars"" as well as ""Cars 2"".  Essentially, all the cars are anthropomorphic and are characters in their own right.

In terms of critical reception, the ""Cars"" franchise has been the most problematic of the Pixar IPs.  While both critics and audiences alike really enjoyed the original ""Cars"", that picture marked the first time that a Pixar picture garnered less than glowing reviews.  To know where I stand as a reviewer, personally ""Cars"" is one of my personal favorite Pixar films, even though I never really liked Nascar.

""Cars 2"", meanwhile, has been the worst received Pixar flick yet.  Mixing international intrigue (essentially James Bond in a cartoon setting with a redneck tow truck called Mater being the central focus of that particular plotline) with the original racing of the first ""Cars"", most critics and audiences alike felt ""Cars 2"" simply fell flat.

Then we come to ""Planes"", the worst movie yet set in the franchise.  Plagued by a dull, by-rote script, a very predictably storyline, and low quality control, ""Planes"" is a very low flying picture, to put it lightly.  To be fair, DisneyToons produced ""Planes"", which is Disney's direct to DVD division.  Only after seeing some completed sequences did Disney chose to do a theatrical release.  However, you can easily tell this is a direct to DVD film, with all the lower quality control that Direct to DVD implies.

Watching the movie you simply feel that they piecemealed it from the first two pictures, with the best elements stripped away.  ""Planes"" marries the race drama of the first ""Cars"" with the international [mixture] adventure of the second ""Cars"" with characters who are little more than painted caricatures of screen-writing archetypes.

First: the animation.  There are some great sequences (especially those involving the scenic sections of the movie, such as the Taj Mahal and the mountains).  The battle sequence where we learn more of Skipper's character is simply stunning, and on the same level as the Pixar movies.  There is a great uneveness though, where some of the sequences (especially those with lots of cars) are bland and almost appear as unfinished.

You also feel you've already seen these characters before.  For those who found Mater intolerable, the racers from different countries are little more than stereotypical caricatures painted with very broad strokes of cultural insensitivity.  We have a lover-boy Mexican who also is a musican, an uptight British plane, an erotically charged (toned down for a kid movie, obviously) French Canadian who speaks the ""language of love"", and a cheating villian that never rises above mere thug.

Without giving away spoilers, Dusty Crophopper (a crop dusting plane) dreams of being a low-flying racer, and wants to enter a competiton called ""Wings Across the World"".  He enters the qualifying rounds and does not make it, but later is admitted due to one of the qualifiers cheating. Having been trained by Chug (a fuel truck voiced by Brad Garret, AKA Robert Barone from ""Everybody Loves Raymon""), both Dusty and Chug list the at-first hesitant Skipper, a World War II plane who fought various battles with the famed , whose motto is truth first.  However, mysteriously Skipper does not fly himself and hasn't for years.

Once Dusty gets in the race, the movie simply turns into different segments of the race (of which there are seven), with different plot points being checked off.  During the movie, he assists various other planes in the race, and is met also with betrayal.  Due to his assistance with the various other racers, at one point they return the favors, setting Dusty up for the climactic finale.  He learns the reason for Skipper's grounding, and battles for first place with Ripslinger, his main archnemesis in the picture.

While ""Cars"" was a homage to Nascar, the racing was only a small element in that movie.  ""Cars"" largely tapped into (brilliantly, I might add) that Route 66 culture of the 1950s-1970s, before the Interstates came in and travellers lost a lot of the scenic majesty of traveling through the United States and exploring the country that can only be done off the Interstate.  While the racing drama tied into ""Cars"" excellently, you cared more about McQueen and what he learned in his stay in Radatior Springs, as well as all the characters he encounters.  You care more about the outcome of the race because the race wasn't the only driving focus.  Lightening McQueen was egotistical; the citizens of Radiator Springs helped Lightening not only become a better ""car"", but also to appreciate a slower life-style.  The movie is much more about McQueen's growing relationships and growth as a character than it ever was about the race.

Unfortunately, this focus on character growth never seems to take flight in ""Planes"", unlike ""Cars"", which ultimately means the film simply denegrates into spectacle in the racing sequences, following shallow, predictable plotpoints that never really elevate the film into the upper echelon of quality animation, as is the won't of the best of the Pixar/Disney films.

While ""Cars"" used the race as a back drop for deeper story telling, ""Planes"" simply becomes a retreat of all those underdog stories.  Due to the longer running time of ""Cars"", we get to know the characters more.  In ""Planes"", the characters never rise above either ethnic stereotypes or dull characters we've all seen in so many other movies.  Ultimately, you by the end of the film you will probably care more for Skipper than anyone else, but by then it's too most likely too late.  Even Dusty Crophopper changes very little (with one minor exception dealing with his ""low flying"" tendencies"".  Compare Dusty's story arc to McQueen's story arc and Dusty comes away looking much the worst for wear.  We've seen Dusty's story arc so often in so many other movies that he is simply not compelling, and there is so little character evolution within Dusty that the film just falls flat, especially when compared to McQueen.

Ultimatley, ""Planes"" becomes little more than a further ploy for Disney to create merchandise using the ""Cars"" brand.  Its Direct to DVD origins are ""planely""evident for everyone above five year olds to see, and had it stayed direct to dvd this film would not nearly have been as offensive as it is to fans of Pixar and Disney.  Unlike the best of Pixar/Disney, which appeal to young and old alike, only the youngest will find this film truly enjoy.  The rest will find it dull, predictable, and simply far below the mark previously set by ""Cars"" and even ""Cars 2"".",1378684800,8,6745,4.987488829311886

3267850,3,7799144076,"My family and I went to see this movie at the drive in movie theater. We brought our family gear (chairs, blankets, etc.) and had an amazing spot, loaded up the popcorn, soda, and other must have movie snacks, and waited for the movie to start. When it did, expectations were high, I was ready for fun, for laughter, and even some light hearted excitement. I did not get that feeling in the beginning or the end of the movie. In fact, I did not get to experience any of those feelings in the intensity I thought I would. I love the whole Disney universe today - Pixar makes such amazing movies that are truly moving and unforgettable. As many have probably mentioned in reviews for this movie, it felt a lot like a sloppy version on cars with wings. What I didn't like was that this was another underdog story, that has a cast of characters that was too similar to the Cars Movie. The big difference is that in Cars, Lightning McQueen was already at the top and needed to win the Big race to get his Piston Cup win and new sponsership, but had lessons to learn. In this story, the main plane, Dusty, is essentially running through the same story line in respects to having to win ""the big race"", and having an old geezer mentor (like Doc in the movie Cars) that had a bad experience with flying in the war that brought him into a life a solitude and sourness, blah, blah. It was just too typical and didn't have anything distinguishable that made this movie special. The characters are forgettable, the story is just ok, and the feeling I had when the movie was over was ""that was disappointing"". Every other pixar film I have seen (pretty much all of them), I have bought the movie as soon as it came out for sale on video. This movie, not too sure I will have this in the collection. I would rather take my chances on a rent to see if this movie grows on me after a 2nd viewing. I gave this 3 stars since it still looks good, decent voice-acting and the animation still looks great; it's just that this movie looks pretty on the outside, but no real structure and feeling inside, which is too bad.",1378425600,,2099,4.3164556962025316
3267851,2,7799144076,"Always having been a fan of Disney animated films since I was a child, most of the modern films have set a standard in comedy, characters and above all, story. Even the musicals and the music `within' type films are usually charming, entertaining and often enduring in a way. ""Planes"" takes a more than slight turn in the opposite direction.

The film took a long time to get the characters interesting enough for me to care about them. The story of the underdog and his triumph, not anything new, became extremely predictable in this film. It wasn't until about 's the way I felt slight emotion for the underdog and his friends and the real adventure began.

Directed by Klay Hall (Tinkerbell and the Lost Treasure) and written by Jeffrey M Howard (Tinkerbell, Pixie Hollow Games) from a story from the original genius that made Pixar famous, John Lasseter (Toy Story, Wall*E), ""PLANES opens in a nose dive of a really long drawn out exposition of the underdog Dusty Crophopper voiced by Dane Cook (Mr. Brokks, Dan In Real Life).

Some of the talent includes, the mentor of the film is voiced by Stacey Keach (American History X, The Bourne Legacy) as Skipper. Brad Garrett (Everyone Loves Raymond, Finding Nemo) voices Chug, the longtime companion of Dusty. Teri Hatcher (Lois & Clark, Desperate Housewives) voices Dottie who eventually becomes the love interest in a very unusual twist. Julia Louis-Dreyfus (A Bug's Life, Seinfeld) plays Rochelle and actual female baddie - who turns her heart by the end.

By the way, this is supposed to be an almost crossover world as seen in the Cars movies, but it doesn't have the charm and power of keeping you attention in the beginning. I will admit, the last 20 minutes was touch and heartwarming - but again, it took over an hour to get to that point. Kids were wrestles in the theatre and the adults were walking out - too bad too - the best things were at the end of the film.

Young, young kids should love the color and landscapes, but unfortunately older kids and adult won't find anything interesting until the film is almost over.

First, this is not a Pixar film. You read that right. It's Disney, not Pixar. But it does have common cast of writers/producers.

Is ""Planes"" bland, derivative pablum with a ""feel-good"" message? Sure,
if you are over 30. I was lucky to see it with my 8-year-old grandson
and his two similarly aged friends. They loved it and talked about the
characters all evening.

Being Disney, it had excellent graphics, funny sight gags and naughty
references that flew (literally at times) over the heads of the kiddies

there are cartoon versions of some real beauties especially the Gee Bee
Super Sportster, a barrel-shaped monster from the 1930's, and the
stolid F4U Corsair, modeled after WWII ace Ira Kepford's bird.

As far as the plot; that's unimportant. It is indeed boilerplate but
