8631872,5,B00HE4NFVG,Granddaughter loves these movies just as much as my kids did when they were younger.,1528243200,,84,4.666666666666667
8631873,5,B00HE4NFVG,"Madeline is the only reason I purchased this item, it features the Anamorphic Widescreen 1.85:1 version which is definitely better than the old 'Standard' 1.33:1 'Full Screen' version but the 1.85 slightly crops the bottom of the picture, for whatever reason.

Matilda, strangely, is offered in the 1.33:1 'Full Screen' cropped version only.
Puzzling and frustrating.
I think Matilda is an interesting film, I admire all the actors' performances but I'm just not a great fan of it.

After wading through the sea of erroneous listings for Madeline I finally found this Widescreen version!
I have purchased the Region 2 PAL video format release but it does not upscale well with a 4K player & TV, it tends to pixelate horizontally, another puzzling thing.
This NTSC released edition 4K upscales as well as a DVD can, it looks perfect!

This adaptation of Madeline is truly inspired and beautifully done, a masterpiece Family Film!

One of the greatest films for young girls, I highly recommend it for that reason.

Be a Good Hat! ",1519948800,,1028,4.9476744186046515
