1243486,5,B00001IVFF,"If you don't think there's a bit of pedophilia in yourself, try watching this movie.  You might be surprised to find out just how much you may have in common with these so-called sicko teachers, coaches, day-care givers,  and Asian sex junket tourists who ""prey"" on cooperative lovely  young girls. This movie is provocative, will inspire you to think, and  maybe even ruin your straight-laced life!  See it and be forever changed.",940032000,3,431,4.930555555555555
1243487,5,B00001IVFF,"The novel of ""Lolita"" has justly been called one of the best works written in the English language since Shakespeare.  The fact that its author was not a native speaker of English makes his achievement all the  more amazing.  ""Lolita"" simply must be read, and any attempts to  convert it to the medium of film must inevitably suffer in comparison.  That said, Adrian Lyne's film is as close to perfect a translation from  book to screen as one could hope to find.  The performances are  pitch-perfect:  Dominique Swain, in her first film role captures the  essence of Nabakov's creation, at once gangly and seductive; endearing,  infuriating and a definite ""starlet"".  The viewer, like Humbert,  is quickly wooed and won.  Melanie Griffith gives her small role as  Charlotte a tarnished dignity and a weary grace, and Frank Langella does  what he can with the enigmatic, barely-seen Quilty.  But Jeremy Irons  simply carries the film.  Known for plumbing baser human emotions in all  his films, he embues Humbert Humbert with a simple humanity that is  heartbreaking to watch.  To admit to liking Humbert even a little is  uncomfortable--it means empathizing on some level with the force that  drives him, even as we may be disgusted by his actions, but it is  impossible not to be charmed.  Irons drops his customary reserved demeanor  to mine the humor in the role, and his voice-overs of dialog straight from  the book are most effective.
This film version succeeds where Stanley  Kubrick's 1962 version failed in remaining true to the spirit of Nabakov's  vision.  I can't recommend it highly enough.  It's just a shame that the  self-serving hypocrisy of the studio heads involved prevented its American  theatrical release when so much commercial swill packed with violence and  degradation of all kinds passes for entertainment in this country.",939859200,135,1851,5.0365448504983386
1243488,5,B00001IVFF,"This film generated a lot of controversy at the time of its release, but it's pointless.  There are no graphic sex scenes and only shadowed nudity using a body double.  The only reason I can think of as to why it was  controversial is because the novel to which it was based was controversial.  This film is one of the best films of the decade, blending scathing humor  with a great story.  It is a very sad film, but one worth seeing.  In case  you have no clue as to what it's about, the storyline goes like this: As a  young boy (at age 14), Humbert Humbert fell deeply in love with a girl,  also aged 14.  He considered her to be perfect in every way.  But their  relationship is cut short when she dies.  So, even in his adulthood, he  searches for someone exactly like her.
One of the best films of all time taken  straight from one of the best novels of all time.  Easily the best film of  1998.",934934400,4,902,4.145348837209302

1243531,1,B00001IVFF,"The cinematography is very well done, but I think it's understated how disturbing this movie as it explores the mind of a pedophile who grooms his 12 year old stepdaughter to sleep with him. I couldn't watch past the part where he enrolls her in a school with subpar education that focuses on home economics type of stuff so that he could have a proper housewife.

It's extremely unsettling and disgusting. I had a very hard time sitting through it, and I was angry through most of it. It's not a film you watch for entertainment unless you're some kind of sicko. However, it is a very well-made film. The ending didn't really feel like an ending, but I was glad that it didn't entirely miss the point of the novel and try to make it into a romance (because that's disgusting). I give credit where credit is due, but I definitely would never willingly sit through this film again.",1515369600,,686,4.409448818897638

1243550,5,B00001IVFF,"Adrian Lyne's controversial 1997 film adaptation of the equally controversial 1955 novel ""Lolita"" is a more faithful version compared to Stanley Kubrick's 1962 film which was hampered by much stricter censorship of that time. Featuring amazing performances by Jeremy Irons and Dominique Swain (who was only 15 when Lyne filmed his version), it was able to delve much deeper into the scandalous story set in 1947 of a middle age man falling in love with a precocious adolescent girl. The 1997 version particularly in America and Australia had difficulty finding distributors and getting released. While featuring a lot of the lurid details detailed in the book, it is never salacious or exploitative and is dealt with a great deal of taste, care & attention to detail of the era. It obviously won't be for everybody but I feel it is one of the best films of the 1990's by a tremendous filmmaker at the height of his abilities.

For years this film was only available here in the states as a DVD by Trimark which featured special features including a commentary track by the director but was saddled by a terrible transfer. The picture quality was murky, too dark and featured muted colors. It seemed like it would never get any kind of bluray release but German label Capelight came to the rescue with their excellent region free bluray.

The picture quality on the bluray is absolutely amazing and beautiful to look at. Presented in its original theatrical aspect ratio of 1.85:1, this restored transfer featured gorgeous color, a wonderful veneer of film grain which accentuates all details shown and much better contrast which shows how horribly dark the ancient DVD was in comparison. Flesh tones are accurate. It truly is like seeing the film again for the first time. Fans of the film will be blown away by how stupendous the film now looks on this bluray release. I doubt it even looked this good in theaters.

Audio is presented in lossless dubbed German as the default but the English language track is unfortunately offered in lossy 5.1 which is a tiny bit of a disappointment. However it still sounds better than the old DVD as well. No English subtitles are included though for the hearing impaired.

The special features from Trimark's DVD were all ported over though the featurettes are now in PAL format. While the main feature is in NTSC format, should your bluray player not be capable of converting PAL to NTSC you won't be able to watch them.

While the English audio not being in lossless format is a tiny blight on this otherwise stellar bluray release, fans of this fine film should not think twice about importing it. The picture quality is beyond gorgeous and does justice to an amazing film.",1504656000,3,2715,4.805139186295503

1243553,4,B00001IVFF,"I never saw this film when it came out, I knew there had been some controversy because of the subject matter. I saw Kubricks original with James Mason and Sue Lyons, which I think didn't capture the original idea of the book(which I read so long ago Ive almost forgotten it). Adrianne Lynnes film is like being trapped in a lepidopterists net after a beautiful butterfly has passed). The idea of love striking us at 1st sight beyond our control of morals, societys norms, language filters, taboos. Irons captures the yearning and infatuation of Humbert, the college lecturer, who has come to teach French literature to students and write now hes come to America. Melanie Griffiths makes a good fist of Charlotte Haze,whom he later marries to get closer to his prize nymphet, Lolita, Dolores( Dominique Swain). Swain's a revelation,petulant, naughty, charming,flirtatious, in love herself with her step-father. A stunning scene has her running all the way up from the car shes going away in with her mum,up to Humbert,when she catches him seeing her off from his room window, She rushes in a jumps up to his embrace,her legs scissoring his body, giving him a full kiss on the lips. Irons captures the breathless surprise and sense of wonder of the butterfly-collector. After her mothers death, Lolita has nowhere else to run to and is soothed and commiserated with by Humbert. This turns into sex as they are thrown closer and closer together. Lolita becomes more extortionate and gets money out of him as they travel the B roads of America, bedding down in some insalubrious hotels and motels. Of course Irons plays the role with great sympathy of a weak and vulnerable manarrested in a child hood love affair phase of a lost childhood love. Lolita knows what they're doing is wrong and it affects her behaviour, making her have outbursts and become more and more hysterical. Lolita says We could be adults one day in the car. Forced out of her childhood innocence, but still only 12 years old. At a school she has sex with a boy 2 years her senior. Later they are pursued by Quilty ,a truly perverse ,evil man who seduces her into his sybaritic harem of lost souls. Lolita doesnt discriminate, she is now drawn to older men. As played by Langhella, its spot on. Period detail is brilliantly recreated and sumptuous music by Morricone as well as all the pop tunes of the 50s. A moving adaptation of a 20th century masterpiece.",1501459200,,2426,4.764845605700713

1243589,4,B00001IVFF,Misses a lot of the complexity both of word plan and characterization of Nabokov's book but that's just the nature of the limit timeframe of any movie compared to a book- some details and plot points have to be cut for a film and the story has to be streamlined for viewing.  Unfortunately in this case the changes and deletions in the film really change Nabokov's intent for his book; on the plus side this film gets a lot closer to the book than the Kubrick film and the cinematography is also a lot better.  What a lot of people fail to realize in their rightful shock and hysteria over the book and movies theme- is that the book is a tragedy; and it is a tragedy for just about every character but one. (I won't insert any spoilers here either to the book or movie)  In addition the movie and the book both are told from Humbert's distorted point of view.  What a lot of people don't realize is that he is what is known as an unreliable narrator.  We as the audience can't trust that anything he says or does or even his reasons for doing them are the truth.  That is part of what Nabokov is trying to show his readers and this is carried over to the film.  Humbert isn't a hero and Lolita isn't a 'love story' of any kind. It's a tragedy- and for everyone involved.,1479168000,,1271,4.2272727272727275

1243596,4,B00001IVFF,"Humbert Humbert in this film is vastly different from the character in Vladimir Nabokov's novel or in the movie directed by Stanley Kubrick. In the book, Nabokov does the seemingly impossible--he tells a sordid story with a monstrous narrator in a brilliantly comic way. Kubrick's effort to accomplish the same through a transfer to the movie screen failed, in my opinion. James Mason gives a distant, ambiguous performance, as if neither he nor the director could figure out exactly how to present his character. Especially awful is the portrayal of the villain Clare Quilty by Peter Sellers, who keeps showing up like some kind of outsider from the film, doing schtick with different accents and disappearing. It's supposed to be funny, but it's mostly distracting and annoying.

Director Adrian Lyne takes a different approach. He removes almost all the comic elements from the story in favor of a kind of tragic romanticism. It wouldn't work except for the remarkably compelling performance of Jeremy Irons as a man hopelessly, impossibly in love. Dominique Swain and Frank Langella are also excellent in the roles of Lolita and Quilty.

There's a magnificently written passage near the close of the book in which Humbert, who has been lying to himself and the reader to justify his behavior, admits the horrible offense he has committed in destroying Lolita's childhood and her life. A shortened version of that passage is included in Lyne's film, and it doesn't fit. The character in this version of Lolita is so different from the one Nabokov created he never would have spoken or thought those words. The only tragedy he can see in the end is his own.",1473638400,13,1659,4.9640287769784175

1243664,4,B00001IVFF,"I love Nabokov for putting into writing such an eloquent outcry on behalf of the victims of pedophilia.  I'm not sure that Lolita's plight comes across so poignantly in this, or either version of the movie, though.  Humbert Humbert as presented in the novel is more creature than human.  He is  ""simian,"" a calculating ""pentapod monster,""  ""beetle-browed,"" and  with ""spatulate thumbs.""  A loathsome and disgusting ""spider.""  Jeremy Irons can't be faulted for his dreamy looks or his sensitive demeanor, but there is no way that the individual he projects can begin to bridge the gap between appealing actor and  sub-Homo Sapiens material such as  Humbert.

By the end of the novel,  Humbert has snuffed out three generations of females in Lolita's family:  Lolita, her mother Charlotte and her unnamed stillborn daughter are all dead in messy and untimely ways, and all directly related to the actions of a sex-offender.  Lolita has been extinguished into ""Mrs. Richard F. Schiller.""  Not a trace of her remains after Humbert's years devouring her prepubescent flesh, not even her name.

The movie seems like more of an art piece, and at the end of the day,  maybe no film, no actor or director could carry the burdens of portraying the disgusting menace of a Humbert.  Or could translate into film the lonely hopelessness of an abused child.

Perhaps the unanswered question is and always will be,  whether the pedophile is able to subdue his or her vile tendencies toward children by refusing to serve that appetite.  Most of us will never know, though we know all too well what becomes of children who aren't allowed any choices.",1454025600,2,1633,4.930147058823529
1243665,5,B00001IVFF,"Long a favorite film of mine, Adrian Lyne does a superb job of directing both Jeremy Irons and Dominique Swain, a much better version of this story by Vladimir Nabokov.  The original film with Sue Lyons and James Mason and directed by none other than Stanley Kubrick was stodgy and woefully enchained by the censors in Hollywood who really didn't even want to touch this novel.  Kubrick did not succeed well because he was too constrained by the studios and a lack of imagination.  Lyne is not constrained and walks a delicate line between that which is sensual and that which is overly sexual.  Dominique Swain is a heavenly image and her flirtatiousness is spot on; Jeremy Irons is a truly gifted actor and is directed in a very multi-shaded way--his ""stepping over the line"" is subtle and not overplayed.  Perfect combination between the two actors and Lyne's deft handling of them together.  I totally recommend this movie.",1453420800,4,927,4.8354430379746836

It follows the book almost exactly, but you do not, in my opinion have time to develop your own ideals about the characters. The book spends lots of time persuading the reader about the situations they face and allows the read themselves to develop their own ideals about these characters. The way Lolita went in my mind when reading the book, did not go according to the movie and in some ways the movies ruins it for me.

P.S. This is probably why the movie was rated R with the obvious subject aside, but in the end there is a p****. Overall I thought it was a okay portrayal of Nabakov's work",1450483200,,758,4.263888888888889

1. This is a German import (""Region A"") so the movie should play on American machines (at least it does on my Samsung player).
2.  Picture quality is quite good.  The quality of the original film element varies scene by scene, so the Blu-ray will only enhance that (good and bad).  I don't think this has been remastered, but it's still a BIG improvement over the 480p dvd.
3. Sound is fine.  I have a stereo setup, so I can't comment on the 5.1 audio.

CONS:
1. There is no video picture on the Bonus Features (at least on my blu-ray player). Audio only.
The Trailer however, plays fine.  So hang on to your original dvd!  From what I can tell, it's the same features simply ported over to the blu-ray.
2. The default language is German (dubbed) so you'll need to go to the Language Menu and change it to English (easy to do).",1447545600,10,833,4.301282051282051

He is the perpetrator, but he justifies his actions by accusing the child of acting in a seductive way that is not true.
Shame on everybody who glamourizes a child rape, which is the subject of the book, and should be the subject of the movie also. Instead, we get a girl who is much older than the one in the book and behaves like a seductress, and the guy is being portrayed as her victim.

1243726,5,B00001IVFF,"Adrian Lyne`s LOLITA will one day receive its due from film historians as the greatest cinematic work of the last two decades of the 20th century: a prize denied it at the moment as we war with one another over how we are to face sexual and social reality. As Maurice Girodias wrote of the novel ""Lolita"": ""I sensed that LOLITA would become the one great modern work of art to demonstrate once and for all the futility of moral censorship and the indispensable role of passion in literature."" So does this speak also for Lyne`s film. Jeremy Irons, as Humbert, opens the film with words from Nabokov`s novel. As he first catches sight of Lolita (Dominique Swain), the camera focusses slowly and lovingly on her form as she reclines on the lawn, surrounded by the wetness, lushness, humming honey-dew freshness of the garden; reading a book, from which she looks up at Humbert and smiles tenderly, tauntingly, knowingly - radiantly. She returns to her book, but with a smile of realization; aware of him yet far from troubled; silently already conspiring with him. Thus we meet Dominique Swain, proving herself already in this opening scene one of the most accomplished actresses of our time. The camera moves to dwell on her feet, raised behind her as she lies reading, glistening against a backdrop of floral beauty; nature wordless, far more eloquent than words. The camera frequently focusses lovingly and interestingly on her feet. In a later scene she sits beside him on the veranda of the Haze house, and Miss Swain is so skilful an artiste that her movements and mannerisms are not at all feigned, but are the natural movements, expressions and mannerisms of the girl she plays, as though the camera were not there. The carefree jerking of her bronzed legs and arms against his; the brush of her hair, carelessly and as if unknowingly against his cheek. Her smile lights up the screen. Her eyes mock society: its bigotry, its prejudice. ... ""I should call the police and tell them you raped me, you dirty old man,"" she tells Humbert later, smiling tauntingly and affectionately, her retainer showing, making him smile too. She asks ""Want to see my chin wobble?"", and wobbles it, making us with Humbert want to press our face, laughing, against hers. She takes her retainer from her mouth and drops it in his drink while her mother has left to get some ice. Frantically, he has to fish for it and get it back in her mouth before her mother sees. He also has to quickly dispose of her bubble-gum and pop it into his own mouth before her mother espies it. As out and out bigots condemned this movie for its frankly realistic portrayal of love, so many of its half-hearted defenders displayed cowardice in their would-be sympathy, disowning and neutralising it with: ""...Of course, we know what Humbert is doing is wrong,"" and ""... Of course, we cannot sympathise with him.""! And other such timid sell-outs and non-committal verbiage. (Together with the academic so-called ""psychopathological analyses"" etc., which are all so much garbage, and which Peter Sellers` Quilty in the original Kubrick film version mocked so well!)
A truly great film - one of the most moving and realistically performed of all time - and a superb work of art for the more enlightened people of the future to appreciate much better than we today are able to!

1243793,1,B00001IVFF,"They should rename this ""Diary of a Dirty Old Man...""

I remember being captivated by this movie when I was younger, and it has always lingered in my memory.  As a rather serious and fatherless kid, I think I was intrigued by the happy-go-lucky girl and the power her joie-de-vivre seemed to give her over this man (read: father figure) in her life.  I was feeling nostalgic, adventurous, and this movie popped up randomly on a ""Jeremy Irons"" search, and I though ""hey, British Actor, must be good,"" so I decided to give it another watch.

Now my skin is literally crawling off my bones and I want a shower.

This movie is deeply disturbing on so many (adult) levels.  First of all, the film is narrated in first person by the dirty old man, so it tries to make you feel like Lolita is somehow ""different"" from other girls (a nymph), that he is ""haunted by the ghosts of his past,"" and thereby deserving of pity.  Give me a break.  His ""ghosts"" are minor and irrelevant, no different from most adults on this planet who have loved and lost.  He is no victim of his past; he is a disgusting old man who tries to romanticize his lack of psychological maturity and ends up ruining a young girl's life.

The movie DOES NOT overlook this fact, at least.  She ends up (SPOILER ALERT) without any family or safety net, knocked up, and impoverished in a shack.  She dies in child birth.  He ends up dying in prison.  His obsession ultimately destroys them both.  Unfortunately, I fear that the great acting, cinematography, storytelling, beautiful scenery, and romantically-tragic plot marginalize just how disgusting the entire situation truly was.  He ends the movie a remorseful and ruined man, after perhaps the most anti-climactic execution of justice... awwww, an unwitting pedophile delivering justice to a pre-meditated one, how sweet.  (((gag)))

There is zero nostalgic, ""coming of age"" in this film.  The girl is NOT of age, by any definition, either physically or emotionally.  She is not a nymph, as the narrator and the cover-art for the film would have you believe, which makes the movie even more disturbing.  She is just an average, awkward, cocky, fatherless, confused tween, who does all the goofy things you would expect a young girl to do.  The creepy man assumes it's all an attempt to seduce him.  (Dude, narcissistic, much)?  Example: she walks around in her flannel pajamas, chewing gum, with curlers in her hair.  He thinks she is trying to seduce him.  He follows her around like a panting, leering, humping dog; it's pathetic.  To make matters worse, once she realizes that she has his attention, she exploits it for all its worth, also proving herself to be a petulant, uncouth, selfish little s##t.  (Sorry, there's no nice way of putting it).  But she is a kid, so we can forgive that.  She's going through that awful stage that some tweens go through, where she is experimenting with anything and everything under the sun.  She is not interested in sex or becoming a woman; she just wants attention.  She would lick herpes off the bathroom floor, if it got someone to pay attention to her, or if it ticked her (clueless, obnoxious) mother off.  The sleazy old man just exploits the situation and, in his pathetic delusion, thinks it somehow makes him special.

I honestly can't recommend this movie to anyone.  Anyone who sympathizes with the main character should probably seek therapy, be kept away from children, and/or shoved in a blender and turned into dog food.  I'm surprised Jeremy Irons even took the role.",1416009600,6,3540,4.755336617405583

1243797,1,B00001IVFF,"This is a film about pedophilia, in which we see both Lolita and the world through the eyes of the sick pervert. The problem is that many people take his viewpoint to be the truth of what is happening, and from what I have read, the novel is actually an attempt to portray how a sick mind sees things, not the reality of what they are.

He does not love her at all-there is a type of pedophile who believes that having sex with a child is an act of 'love'-that is all this is.

There are many unhealthy messages here-and untrue as well.

The child never 'takes advantage' of the adult in these scenarios, it is always the other way around.

In the book the child is only 12 years old when the sick man first wants to molest her, 12 years old.

And the true reason abusers abuse is that they themselves were once abused, in the vast majority of cases.

I haven't read the book, but from what I have read about the author he often writes from the perspective of people who do awful things.

The idea that the child has any power in these kinds of relationships is patently absurd. The idea of 'consent' is ridiculous, it is rather a matter of 'grooming' and manipulation by the abusers. Sad that people do not understand these things better, but in real life the epidemic of sexual abuse continues.......",1412467200,3,1302,4.355371900826446

Unfortunately this film's version of the main character Humbert isn't Nabokov's, and that's a shame because the strength of the story is Nabokov's detail in how addicted to 12-14 year old girls Humbert was.  It's as if the screenwriter and director were given a synopsis of the story and never took the time to actually read the novel.  That being said, Jeremy Irons was very good but you expect that from a serious actor.  This gets only one star for taking a great novel and not being true to the original author's main character.

1243876,5,B00001IVFF,"Light of my life, fire of my loins my sin, my soul Lolita.  Sigh. I will never tire of hearing the opening line to the '97 version of Lolita. Everyone talks about Humbert but the movie is called LOLITA, people. Don't get me wrong, I love Sue Lyon, but Dominique Swain captured everything I ever imagined Lolita to be. Playful yet sinful, my god she was perfect. Seriously one of the best performances I have ever seen. When she runs back up the stairs into his arms, I could watch that scene a hundred times over and my heart would race every time. I love everything about Lolita: the book and both films, and I wouldn't criticize either one. I just find Dominique to be more charming while also sultry and seductive at the same time, and Sue Lyon's Lolita seemed just over the top bratty to me. If you're going to watch one, well, forget it. You have to watch them both, because you can't miss Peter Sellers in Stanley Kubrick's 1962 Lolita.",1392422400,8,942,4.413793103448276
1243877,5,B00001IVFF,"Dominique Swain (Lolita) is not a better actress than Sue Lyons (the 1962 Lolita), but the long script allows her to portray a 14-year-old girl in greater depth. (The novel had Lolita as 12 years old, but some decision-makers for each film could not stomach that in ""Lolita"" as a general-audience movie.) Swain's Lolita is a girl who has been raised for part of her life without a father -- and thus, statistically, is more likely to experiment with sex. She is never luscious as Sue Lyon is luscious --- she is adventurous. The book's Lolita is wistful. Dominique is never wistful, but one of the DVD covers shows wistfulness. That scene apparently was cut from the movie. I suspect that the tinge of anger on her face on the DVD cover is from how her facial muscles configure when she is relaxed and bemused.

I do not see this as a love story. The only (mild) love that I detect in both films is when Lolita and Humbert part for good. In the 1987 movie, despite her dislike of Humbert, Lolita calls him ""Dad"", which tells me that she feels a tinge of daughterly love because she has no other older person.  She overlooks the dysfunction in their relationship and she pulls out enough function from her memory to label him as her ""Dad."" (Nietzsche wrote that if a person does not have an adequate father, then he/she would create one.)

Humbert is somewhat sociopathic. Jeremy Irons' Humbert is less so than James Mason's Humbert. (Sociopathy involves, in part, no conscience, no compassion, possession instead of love, and an overwhelming desire to WIN.)  Humbert never comes across as clinically sociopathic, the type who can, in the words of a psychiatrist at the New Mexico State Penitentiary, ""look right through you"".

 Irons' Humbert is the one who does not plot to shoot his wife. Like Mason, he is obsessed and wants to possess Lolita; and even after Lolita is hopelessly lost to him, he -- like Mason -- is desperate to WIN somehow or other by destroying his mysterious rival for Lolita's attention. But both show some generosity toward the end. And in the very end, Irons shows real compassion.

This movie adheres less to the novel than does the 1962 version, but I found this one more interesting to watch, largely for its detail.  It came out a generation later than the first, was less fettered by Hollywood norms as to what a general audience film could show, and had a bigger production budget.

  I have described Humbert here, since Nabokov describes Humbert.  But it would be interesting if someone were to convincingly write a companion novel that shows how Lolita felt about all of this.

  This is trivial, but there are two anachronisms.  In the beginning, Lolita says, ""See you later, alligator.""  The story is set in 1947, and I believe that ""See you later, alligator"" started with a songwriter in 1951 or 52, and was sung by Bill Haley.  Later in the movie, Lolita asks Humbert if she has a zit.  I was born in 1942 and I feel certain that ""zit"" was not spoken until the 1960s.",1392336000,6,3006,4.627118644067797
1243878,3,B00001IVFF,"Even though it is impossible to translate the literary genius of Nabokov to the big screen, I feel that this version is an even poorer effort that the original 1962 film. Of course that film featured the comic genius of Peter Sellers in the minor but pivotal role of Claire Quilty. Sellers is a pretty tough act to follow, so why bother? By losing the satire and the comic element, the movie becomes a much too literal rendition of what is really a sad story of a pathetic dirty old man. It may make the moralists happy but it does a grave injustice to the novel. On the other hand, it does provide many opportunities for us dirty old men to leer at the beautiful nymphette form of 16 years old Dominique Swain in the title role, if that's your thing.",1391558400,,751,4.333333333333333

You're drawn into the dreamlike quality of the scenery and music, it's like a gorgeous sleep that comes over you.  And yet, you go in fully knowing that it's a tragedy which is about to happen or has already happened.

Jeremy Irons plays Humbert Humbert, a man with a penchant for young girls that he just cannot get past.  He moves into a house as a boarder with Charlotte, a grown up version of her daughter, Lolita.  While Charlotte has a thing for Humbert, he stays because he is in love with her daughter, Lolita.  Lolita is the nymphet, the deadly demon, who loves to provoke and tease to her heart's content.  A series of tragic accidents and purposeful things occur, and then Humbert is at last alone with Lolita.  The two of them embark on a journey which is as much as a cross country adventure as it is an exploration of what is or isn't happening between them.  It's oddly hard to keep in mind that Humbert is the villain in this saga, that he is the monster that we warn kids about who is seemingly innocent and hard working and yet we are silently hoping for him at the same time.  Lolita is as much a plaything as she is a demon, who knows she can use what she has in a power trip over Humbert to get the things that she wants and uses it quite a bit.  How it ends?  Won't give that away, but we know based on this horrible, tragic event that it's doomed.

It's rather slow moving and yet you wouldn't want it any other way.  Perhaps it's all about wanting to be innocent and happy again with someone or something that you want to be just so innocent and happy with.",1386201600,,1675,4.226415094339623

How it causes us to reason within ourselves to accept this unfortunate event in this girl's life; I found that darker side of myself thrilled to see, for example, the mother put out of the way, and also a sadness when Humbert reached his goal.

1243905,5,B00001IVFF,"This version of ""Lolita"" is so much better than the 1962 version. The cinematography is gorgeous, and the sory flows so well. Dominique Swain is fasntastic as the young temptress and seductive Lolita, both for being very beautiful and sexy and a very good actress; she would have been about 16 when she made the movie. It is a very sexually ""hot"" and entertaining film. I saw it once on satellita and knew I had to have my own copy, which was well worth it.

Another movie you might like, also available from Amazon, is the 1992 MGM production of ""The Lover."" This movie is also about a seductive young woman and an older man, and is very, very ""hot.""

1243921,5,B00001IVFF,"Based on the Novel, this would be the second version done as a movie. I saw the Kubric version, however Adrian Lyne captured the total essence of the Lolita character far far better than Kubric. This story as done by Lyne is far more captivating, and pulls you in..  Dominic Swain's acting is ""superb"", adding more character, as well as impromptu actions, and her own flare. She better played the part of a young girl over the kubric version. The directing, the setting, is more believable, and there are more ""actual"" erotic elements in this version, tastefully done; not like some sleezy B rated stuff.( I won't spoil it..you just have to see for yourself)  also, Watching the special features adds to the experince about the making of the movie. This truly is a MUST see. P.S. I don't know why they list it as 'Lolita by Melanie Grifith'(?)  Even on the DVD jacket it has her name over the photo of Dominic Swain, who plays Lolita, and who is on the cover.

1243923,4,B00001IVFF,"As I've not yet read Vladimir Nabokov's novel on which this movie was based, I came to the film with no expectations. The acting (in particular by the marvellous Jeremy Irons and newcomer Dominique Swain)was fascinating. Both actors captured the ambivalence of the relationship between Humbert & Dolores(Lolita) perfectly.

Irons excelled at portraying Humbert's obsession with Lolita; there were moments when one cringed at his self-delusion and his (perhaps) deliberate manipulation of his role of stepfather and yet one also felt as if he were swept away by inner forces he could not contain. Swain created a Lolita who was an intriguing mix of corrupted innocence and childish promiscuity, with a twist of cruelty that added depth to Humbert's ambiguous role in her life. As they fenced and toyed with each other, their repressed antagonism as powerful as their desire, the on-screen chemistry between Humbert and Swain intensified as the inevitable conclusion to their relationship approached.

Adrian Lyne's directing was excellent - he created an atmosphere of fervent passion and uncontrollable emotions in a discreet and classy manner, proving that being subtle and leaving things to the imagination is often more effective and moving than blatant eroticism. The music score by Ennio Morricone was beautiful and enhanced the on-screen tension, while Howard Atherton's cinematography was superb.

There were a few unexplained moments in the film which, if I'd read the book previously may have been less perplexing, but the movie was strong enough to hold the viewer's attention throughout the nearly 2 and 1/2 hours running time. I enjoyed it mainly because the characterisations were complex and the whole production was extremely well-crafted.",1337990400,2,1754,5.417582417582418
1243924,3,B00001IVFF,"Almost as good as the original Stanley Kubrick film 'Lolita', this version gets more to the plot of the novel by V. Nabakov. This movie was shown as a TV classics network special (I forget which station). Quite suggestive but I would still say it gets a PG 13 rating. Young Dominique Swain is convincing as every parent's teen aged nightmare 'Lolita'; Gerald Irons as 'Humbert' reveals his loss of his first love which he blames for his later perversions; and Melanie Griffiths is a desperate, manipulative single mom on a mission: Get Rid of the Girl! Humbert is on the verge of assassinating his new wife so he can get to the daughter, when fate intervenes!

This is obviously a British production. Same exact musical background as the one you hear in 'Once upon a time in America', which I thought was kind of lame. But the music works better here. The dialogue is clear but the video is a little hazy or cloudy, slightly noticeable. I would have to compare to another edition before I decide if this was done for 'effect'.

There is no director's (Adrian Lyme) commentary voice over as in other dvd versions of this film, so you have to be careful when selecting which version you want. I got it real cheap I believe because it has selectable Chinese and Indianesian subtitles. For me, it was a good choice, buying the cheapest version I could find.

And 2: the subtitles are mandatory. You can either watch it with english subtitles or chinese subtitles, but there will be subtitles.

I cannot believe that there is not a legitimate DVD copy of this movie anywhere, and I can't believe that Amazon is allowing this to be represented as if it were a legitimate copy.

1243927,3,B00001IVFF,"First of all the film is brilliantly played by the actors and the atmosphere is almost perfect. But in my opinion too perfect.

Jeremy Irons does an amazing job on playing Humbert Humbert, but well he does it too good. He's presented as a loving and desperate person (with some emotional outtakes). If you see him on screen you feel so much sympathy for most of his actions. This is all very true to the book, but there were many shortcuts taken by the director and the little hints that Humbert could be lying (because he himself is telling the story) get lost in the film. The movie is so strict on the actions described in the book by Humbert, that it presents his version as the truth. Humbert in the movie lacks many aspects of his perfidiousness, it lacks the reasons why Lolita can't leave and how he binds her to him. The whole psychological game he's playing with her gets lost. The broken promises, the ways he tries to keep her going etc. .

The sad story of Lolita herself falls short. The film emphasizes on Lolita seducing Humbert, but leaves out so many cases of extortion she has to endure. ""Morning duties"" before she gets her cup of chocolate? Let's ignore such things. The film focuses on the bargaining of Lolita to get more money. The movies misses the tragedy of the fight for power, each side using their weapons to exploit the other.

I think in 2:17 both sides fall short compared to the book, with the better part for Humbert. I don't think you could do it any better in two hours, but it's still not good enough to bring the brilliance of the book on film. The book is an absolute masterpiece which uses all the 300 pages to describe the tragedy on both sides, even by the most brilliant director this can't be achieved in 2 hours.",1315267200,3,1758,4.419753086419753
1243928,3,B00001IVFF,"First let me say I never read the book. I watched the film on YouTube, in about 14 parts, and part 1 was missing so I know nothing of Hubert's past. I do know that Jeremy Irons' acting is, as always, breathtaking (as is he, physically, in this film); he acts with his eyes and it's amazing to behold. He is such a fine actor that it's hard for us to even bring ourselves to be repulsed by his relations with his late wife's daughter.  He makes even that hot.  It's just a very sexy movie.  Now, having said that, the Lolita character is just downright annoying (and I think she is supposed to be), and a manipulative little tease...which she is supposed to be! But somehow the relationship is endearing.  A more talented actress (did Natalie Portman turn this down?) woudl have made it better.
In a nutshell: Keep expectations reasonable, enjoy the Jeremy Irons eye candy factor and fine acting, and bear with it when it descends into total stupidity with the Frank Langella character.  I also want to note that Adrian Lyne is a genius and my favorite director, bar none. I just don't think even he could make something of this. It's all about Irons.  Without him, I shudder to think what would be!",1312848000,,1198,4.472477064220183

He seemed like a normal guy who may attract young crushes. I love that this movie was much more in detail, it gave you a realistic idea of the types of abuse that Lolita was suffering/trying to escape from. I also enjoyed the ending much better, when Humbert is shooting the playwright. Fantastic!",1310515200,2,620,4.447368421052632
1243932,4,B00001IVFF,"I thought this version of the movie was a great adaptation from the novel which I have also read. I thoroughly enjoy when a movie attempts to follow the story line from a book closely. Because the plot revolves around a taboo of any time era, the movie succeeds in making its audience uncomfortable. I will say in reading both book and film, I found myself more uneasy and uncomfortable watching the movie in certain scenes. It's not that the movie is graphic in a lot of sexual matter but it personally made me cringe in disgust a few times. So with that being said, I would agree with the R rating because its subject matter is atypical of what people usually see in movies. Because the story line revolves around a relationship with an older man and a girl of only 12 years old, the rating should be R to warn people.

I thought the casting of the characters was a great depiction of how they are described in the novel. Seeing as how Lolita is a young girl, Dominique Swain was the perfect choice. She looked the proper age and acted in ways an immature growing child would. Dominique accurately captured the nave innocence of a child maturing into a manipulative teen ager. Though you may find her annoying, she was the perfect actress cast for the role.

Obviously with any book adaptation details are left out or certain things are added for the Hollywood excitement but for the most part I felt this movie to be more true to the storyline then the 1960's version of the movie. It was important to include details of Humbert's past to show the audience why he becomes the man you see in the film. The only thing I would criticize is just how ruthless and manipulative they make Lolita out to seem in the movie. As she spends more time with Humbert they portray her to be much more heartless in the movie than the book. Other than that issue, a great film if you can get past the moments of awkwardness.",1310428800,2,1909,4.420454545454546
1243933,3,B00001IVFF,"This movie was o.k. I guess. What I didn't like was the fact that they killed off a character too soon and Lolita was not the sexy charming girl that the previews made her out to be, in the movie she was so immature ( chewing gum every 5 minutes, making immature jokes and eating candy like a pig.) Also I didn't understand why they made this movie rated R. Nothing ""adult"" went on between Lolita and Humbert. I gave this movie 3 stars because it could have been better and to me I didn't like the way that it ended.",1310169600,,516,4.118811881188119

Jeremy Irons does such a wonderful job playing Humbert seemingly getting almost every aspect to him down to a point. Dominique does swimmingly at playing the role of Lolita for her only being about the age of 16 years old. Although it was not exactly on point with how the novel was, it's actually really good for a film adaptation considering everything that does happen in the story. Although, I would have preferred it censored in some parts of the film, it does get a bit gory in some parts. I think what I like most about the film is that the viewer can clearly see the interaction between Lolita and Humbert more in depth, which is something I don't think many people can grasp. Though, I do wish they tried to do more type and age appropriate casing for the films, I really would have wished they casted Lolita as the 12 year old to get the full feel for the fill even if Dominique did a great job at it.

First is that of Jeremy Irons who plays our narrator, Professor Humbert. I found him to be very direct in his dialogue. He also created a sense of boyish charm to the character of Humbert, which helped personify his actions. He did not seem just like a creepy old man chasing after a young girl, but he had such tenderness towards Lolita that outshined his questionable nature. Now as for the title character Lolita, Dominique Swain, I found to be very mature. She did not seem believable as a young girl, and when watching the film I found her to just be Charlotte Haze's daughter until later learning she was in high school. I thought she played with age too much and did not establish or ground herself in one certain behavior mindset. As I have mentioned Charlotte Haze, played by Melanie Griffith, being Lolita's mother; I felt did not deliver. I found her annoying qualities to be desperate and half-hearted. I did not believe her to be dominant in the household or have any character depth. Got a sense of just doing a character.

1243949,5,B00001IVFF,"No film can do justice to Nabokov's novel, Lyne's film can't, Kubrick's film certainly can't, and in the hands of the average reader, even the printed novel alone can't!  After buying both DVD's, I searched for my old copy of ""Lolita"" but failed.  A well-know auction site provided me with a copy annotated by Alfred Appel, Jr. (a Nabokov scholar and former Nabokov student) in collaboration with Nabokov and others.  With these annotations at hand I began to appreciate Nabokov's polymathic genius.  Allusions, references, foreign phrases, occult humor, red herrings, foreshadowings, and anti-Freudian insults gush from his pen (and far over the head of the unarmed reader).

A picture is NOT by a long shot worth 1000 Nabokov words, but Lyne's movie (certainly a simplified version of the novel) catches the mood beautifully and wrenchingly--lyrical, funny, and sweet one minute; painful to watch the next.  Morricone's background music is understated and haunting.  All the characters are perfect.  Jeremy Irons' Humbert is sad and touching, far more victim than dirty old man, and designed to be more sympathetic than the novel's Humbert, who journeys from weirdness to normality just in time to die.

And Dominique Swain?  Well, to understand her you must first understand what a nymphet is and isn't.  A nymphet is not simply a beautiful, sexually precocious, underaged girl.  A nymphet (term derived from Greek mythology) is a supernatural creature, a little demon with powers to charm, enchant, beguile and seduce men.  As Humbert says, only mad, tortured artists can discern the nymphet among her classmates, but once she is identified, that man is doomed; a moth drawn to a bug zapper, a fly struggling against a pest strip.

So how did little Dominique, fresh from middle school with zero acting experience, play the complex Lolita so perfectly?  Perhaps she wasn't acting.  She is spontaneous, she improvises, she is un-selfconscious, she seems to be playing herself.  And by Humbert's calculation ""nymphet"" is a stage that for that nymphetic minority exists between the ages of 10 and 14.  The nymphet then enters another stage of her life, much like one of Nabokov's beloved butterflies.  Note that Lyne's ""Lolita"" was made when Dominique was 14 and was released 2 years after its production.  And note that in Dominique's subsequent films she no longer appears the nymphet; a beautiful young woman certainly, but her supernatural powers to enchant have left her.

I was convinced that Dominique was not playing a nymphet but actually WAS one until I watched the screentests, particularly the one where she meets again with Humbert at Coalmont years after they have parted.  According to script Lolita again rejects Humbert and tells him she had never loved him, cooly crushing him one last time.  But in the screentest, Dominique seems to break down at that point, crying real tears and burying her face in Irons' shoulder.  The room is stunned and falls silent.

So, no, Dominique Swain was no nymphet.  She had all the powers of a nymphet, but also a soul.",1273795200,5,3073,5.059642147117296
1243950,5,B00001IVFF,"Lolita is a horribly disturbing tale of pedophilia and the lengths that some people will go to to pursue it and disguise it. It's very hard to watch. In fact, the first time I tried to watch it, I couldn't. That said, it's beautifully done and perfectly cast. I am not normally a fan of Melanie Griffith, but she is superb in being a naive female who has a smattering of jealousy for her blossoming daughter. She appears genuine in her desire to be loved and respectable. Dominique Swain does an absolutely fantastic job of moving between the vulnerable little girl who wants a daddy and the budding teen. She tries to desperately to be as grown up as the role she is thrust into, but you can't help but see through to the tender little girl. Jeremy Irons is wonderful. You can see his mind calculating then fighting against itself. He's supposed to be Lolita's dad, and sometimes acts like it, but we can see Lolita taking the power away from him. In the end, Jeremy Iron's explanations and excuses for his failings expose his mental illness to the world. The last picture we see of Lolita barefoot, poor and pregnant is all that could be expected after being so horribly abandoned by her dad, neglected by her mom, and used by the other men in her life that she just wanted to love. I'm not a pedophile so I can't tell you if this is a realistic view of how it could be, but it rings true.

I simply run out of words to really describe the breathtaking performences in the film right from the direction, acting to to the cinematography and background score of the film. Jeremy Irons is simply brilliant, shines with immense excellence, the more that could be said about him as Humbert, the lesser it is. He is one of the very few actors who can speak a dozen words with just facial expressions. Dominique swain, Melaine Griffeth and Frank Langella shine with sheer excellence in their roles.

1243953,2,B00001IVFF,"Adrian Lyne, who directed this newer version of Vladimir Nabokov's classic love story 'Lolita' gives every effort to be true to the book. Unfortunately, being faithful to the book is its major downfall as no one in the story has any chemistry with each other and the movie fails to bring out the humor of the book.

If you only saw this version of the movie and not read the book, you might think this a good film. If you read the book, chances are, you have seen the Kubrick and this version and will inevitably make comparisons of the three. The book stands on its own and one could not realistically be made into a film using the book as the only reference. Nabokov wrote the script for Kubrick, but was eventually heavily edited by Kubrick (although still given screenplay credit). The book has too many subtleties and linguistic atmosphere that gets lost in cinema and so is compensated elsewhere.

Adrian Lynne chose Melanie Griffith as Delores Haze, Jeremy Irons as Humbert Humbert and Dorothy Swain as Lolita. All of them have their own merit, but together in this film they do not seem to get along to create substantial chemistry that gives the audience any feeling for them. Griffith has a flat affect in every line of dialogue and her scene where she discovers Humbert's secret is soft and expressionless. She comes off as dismissive more than angry or outraged. She seemed far too much in control. Jeremy Irons always seemed aloof and dumbstruck, especially in the scenes with Lolita. But this reaction never came across as the character Humbert in any way as intellectual. Humbert is not passionate nor a stuffy intellect, nor does any of his foolishness come through in the performance. Lastly, Swain as Lolita was just plain annoying. Yes, the book version of Lolita had her childish whims and charms, but there was an appealing quality that is not shown here.

All of the characters all seem to be going through the motions of whats on the script, but no one ever really understanding the characters and missing the comedy as well. Which, as mentioned, this is a more faithful version of the book, but it seems to me that Lynn only saw it as a serious drama and not as a comedy of characters. Which is why, although Kubrick's version is not as faithful, keeps Nabokov's style of writing in tact within the film. Mason, Lyons and Winters as well as Sellers are perfect in their roles and know their characters from the 1962 version. There is much more psychology and irony in Kubrick than in this version.

Adrian Lynne, whose past works include 9 1/2 Weeks, Indecent Proposal, Unfaithful and Fatal Attraction are all sex themed stories, which makes me wonder if there was a type of exploitive quality that reduced this story to be about sex and not about Humbert Humbert's (albeit twisted) understanding of love.",1261353600,6,2829,4.709090909090909

Jeremy Irons was great, as usual.  He's a lot like Johnny Depp, in that he takes roles of people I don't like but is such a good actor that he overcomes the material.  Dominique Swain overdoes the nymphet act, but I blame the writer and director more than her.

Great metaphors abound.  Insects being zapped after coming too close to the light.  Flies stuck on flypaper.  Barking dogs straight out of Greek myth.  Fields of fire like something out of medieval Italian poetry.

However, the movie engaged in cheap foreshadowing by showing us at the beginning of the movie the results of the dramatic confrontation at the movie's end.

1243984,5,B00001IVFF,"Both Dominique and Jeremy gave Oscar-worthy performances in this brilliant movie. The fact that Dominique had zero previous acting experience was of course the very reason that she could not possibly have won. I mean that would point out a rather obvious fact about Hollywood.....

Anyway this movie is very atmospheric and will make you happy, sad, sick, and angry. Which is exactly what a good movie is supposed to do....drag out your feelings/emotions. This is a timepiece movie and you really get a feel for the 1940's. We all know the story about an older man infatuated with a young girl so I won't rehash any of that...it is the backbone of the whole thing. Mr. Irons is absolutely perfect in the role of the hopelessly torn and consumed Humbert. He has a way of saying so much without having to say a word. Mr. Langella is the perfect villain and whereas you have empathy for Humbert, you have none for Quilte. Melanie Griffith gives a good performance as the unaware and overbearing mother who herself falls hard for Humbert.

I especially liked the fact that Dominique was never shown nude. This actually increases the erotic element of their relationship and keeps an edge on the movie. The emphasis on the girls bare feet and legs puts a punctuation mark on her coltish figure and her ""barefoot girl next door"" image that is so cute and yet so seductive, in a natural and innocent way.

There is also a very interesting point made (Humberts first tragic love...) regarding ""sexual imprinting"" that boils down to your first sexual experience sometimes being the reason you gravitate towards a certain type of person whether it be age, weight, or even sex. It is like you become fixated based on moment in time and you just continue to loop on that fixation. A most interesting theory. It may provide insight into the situation where an older adult falls hard for a young boy or girl.

Dominique makes the movie. You can't fake being a nymphette. You either are or you aren't...and she is. She is so natural, playful, and innocently sexual she literally embodies everything that is attractive about young women. Easily the best performance by an actress I have seen in a long time. She is truly a ""natural"".

An instant classic....",1188777600,5,2241,4.735897435897436
1243985,1,B00001IVFF,"Another movie based on the Cliff Notes, this movie gets everything wrong.  It is even worse than the Sue Lyon movie, since that older movie created a parallel story which, while nothing like the book, almost stood on its own.  In that one we got a 21 year old Lolita to satisfy the censors.  In this one we get a 15 year old Swain who looks 18.  She is not a Lolita regardless, by Nabokov's definition of nymphet.  She is too curvy by far and entirely too seductive.  Lolita is supposed to be 12, weigh 84 lbs soaking wet, with ""unflared iliacs"" and dirty hair.  Instead of this ""pale little gutter girl"" we get Swain, a ""big-breasted and practically brainless baba.""  Irons is no better.  A great actor, he has been wonderful in many roles, but he is not Humbert Humbert.  Humbert was big and dark and hairy, handsome and educated but the opposite of Irons' catfoot delicacy.  Beyond this, Irons and Swain have no heat regardless.  The love scenes have this golden Hallmark falsity to them that could not possibly be further from Nabokov's intent.  This movie is a misfire in all ways, an absolute disaster.  I can envisage a wonderful adaptation of Lolita; what I cannot envision is where it will come from.  The US and UK are more uptight now than they were in the 50's and France isn't much interested in American stories, even when they are penned by a Russian internationalist.  Hopefully the world will survive into a new age where some true artist can rediscover this masterpiece and tell it faithfully.",1166745600,29,1511,4.602996254681648
1243996,4,B00001IVFF,"This films greatest strength is also its greatest weakness. This movie plays Humberts obsession with Lolita seriously and sympathetically. You can't help but feel bad for Humbert by the end of the movie as it is really Lolita who takes advantage of him and not the other way around. That is the film's strength but also the weakness; Lolita is 12 years old. That's just creepy. This film tries to make you feel bad for a man who, for all intents and purposes, uses his charm and status as stepfather to sleep with his 12 year old daughter. I find it disturbing. Surely this was not Nabokov's intention when he wrote the novel.

Jeremy Irons is very good at the role he plays, but he isn't the character the books gives us. The character in the book was not a nice man. He drugged his wife, he planned to drug Lolita to take advantage of her while she slept, he lied and manipulated, he planned in his mind to kill his wife and probably would have had she not been killed before he could get to it. But Jeremy Irons is not like that at all. His character is just a lonely man in the wrong place at the wrong time; he is haunted and almost, it seems, justified in his love(?) for Lolita by the sad events of his childhood.

Melanie Griffith is not a good Charlotte at all. She is not nagging enough, she is far too good looking, and until she give Humbert her love letter there is no indication that she is in love with him. There definitely needed to be more time spent developing her character.

Doninque Swain seemed far too aware of what she was doing at times, and far too childish at other times. The film made her look like the bad guy for seducing Humbert and using his obsession with her as a weapon against him. That isn't how the books played her at all.

Clare Quilty is all but absent in this film. He has a very short appearance at the hotel, and then we don't see him again until the end of the film. The book gives him a lot of charisma that was completely absent; in this film he is just a dirty old man. Look to Sellers performance in the 1962 version for a much more rounded and exact portrayal of Quilty.

Overall, this was not a bad film if it stood on its own. The camera work is excellent in expressing the emotions of the film and Jeremy Irons is excellent is his portrayal of a Humbert (albeit a different one that was presented to us in the book) but this film misses the message of the book even if it is a more literal cinematic translation of the book.",1159315200,8,2479,4.232558139534884
1243997,5,B00001IVFF,"(4.5/5 stars)  Very few films (or the books upon which they are based) portray the relationship between an adult and an adolescent seriously, preferring instead to depict them as monsters, perverts or both. Not so with ""Lolita."" Humbert Humbert is as normal and as realistic as any other fictional character, and so are his human traits. He just so happens to fall in love/lust with Dolores, the fourteen year old daughter of Charlotte Haze, a widow with a room to rent. It is an unspoken fact that most men are attracted to teenage girls, yet are afraid to admit it because it is not acceptable for adults to act on these impulses. Most people see this as taking advantage of someone not yet old enough to make important decisions like this on their own. Even though Humbert acknowledges the socially unacceptability of this relationship and keeps it hidden from everyone, at the same time he indulges his fantasies and exploits his new-found fortunes. Although details would most likely differ, this sad tale is ultimately practical about the fate of a man who disregards reality and ignores potential consequences when he takes a fourteen year old girl as his lover. Many men would like to do this, John Mark Carr being one of the latest, yet few do because of the consequences. Most men can envision the effects of their actions and conclude both that this girl will not stay this age forever and he would not be able to keep this relationship secret indefinitely. In that sense, it is a cautionary tale for those who fantasize about this sort of thing. Conversely, it allows everyone else to experience a glimpse into the mind of someone who acts on this type of fantasy. Either way, ""Lolita"" is a tragic story that is faithfully brought to the screen by director Adrian Lyne and a magnificent cast.",1156377600,11,1804,4.745222929936306

It might be that Lolita is jealous of her mother. Psychologically,Lolita wants to be her mother's copyright(miniature).The father isn't there to hold back the spoiled child. She is matured enough in 'erotic relationship',but still a child in the mind.

He is medicore, at best.  His adaptation of Lolita was terrible -- and all of you who defend him probably never *read* the dang novel, and have no sense of what it lacked.  Lyne's is good, not as good as it could be, but better than the black and white trash that Kubrick made.  He just did not do it.

1244000,4,B00001IVFF,"I've just finished another reading of Nabokov's LOLITA and then watched the films.  I'd read the book in college (20 years ago) and I'd seen Kubrick's film several times but I hadn't seen Adrian Lyne's film version.

How did the book read now that I'm older?  A little creepier, especially since our society is rife with child abuse and child predators.  The book is still a controversial classic, brilliantly designed and written.

To really appreciate this film version, it would help to read the novel.  The attention to detail is really something to see.

Jeremy Irons was a great choice to play Humbert and the script really humanizes his otherwise criminal desires.  Dominique Swain at first looks like a gangly teenager but her sexuality seeps through the childish antics.

Melanie Griffith at first looks too young and sexy as Charlotte but her voice and manner quickly becomes grating.  She still isn't the sad, pathetic character as Shelley Winters but she works very well.

Frank Langella has huge shoes to fill as Clare Quilty after Peter Sellers' daffy, perverse take on the role, but he does a great job of playing the evil doppelganger in his brief scenes.  He isn't the chameleon-like tormentor of Kubrick's film but he is wonderfully menacing and shadowy, giving his shoes and fingers a sleazy presence in close-ups.

Another big plus of this film: they filmed the great Chapter 35 closer to the novel's version, even including the bloody ""pink bubble.""

This is a great adaption, but I'd recommend reading the novel before watching this film.",1143072000,12,1560,4.95
1244001,5,B00001IVFF,"It starts out so seemingly pure, their affectionate flirting.  Uncomfortable, but undeniably innocent and true to their feelings.  We know his back-story, we understand, we sympathize.  But it's unavoidable that it'll turn sour.  Without restraint, it's just inevitable.  It turns into the father-figure grounding and imposing parental-like restrictions on his daughter/lover to keep her to himself, and the daughter-figure manipulating her stepfather sexually/romantically to get what she wants as a rebellious dependent.  They're both abusing their roles, distorting them, using, being used, and becoming damaged in the process.  Crossing that boundary is playing with fire.  This is a lovely, powerful, tragic film in its own right.  And like all great tragedies, there's the effortless, absorbing setup.  Freakishly well cast.  Beautifully photographed.  Scored by one of the greats.  Yes, I noticed that Swain looks significantly older in certain scenes (though all of it was shot during the course of less than a year).  It was completely unintentional, but oddly enough, it works.  They did the first bed scene near the end of the shoot, and it makes the giving-in-to-temptation more believable with Swain looking much more mature...like we're getting into the psychology of the moment.  We accept how all the inhibitions could suddenly dissolve away for the protagonist.  And like the previous reviewer said, in the next scene she goes back to looking young again, sucking on a jawbreaker, and it's very effective at throwing us off.

I'm not going to claim this is more faithful than Kubrick's.  That all depends on how you interpret it.  Both films take a lot of liberties, but in different ways.  This film is perhaps reminiscent of Lynch's adaptation of Dune, where that director became fixated on making doorknobs and bedboards look exactly as described in the novel, but left out whole themes.  Lyne gets obsessed with the look and sound of an ice box, but at least many of the themes and traces of satire are vaguely in tact, though deemphasized.  In a film adaptation, you have to make choices.  Kubrick and Nabokov chose the Satire Of America focus for the first.  In this one, the deeper character and tragedy study is carried through.  At least both versions went back to the book, each independently, rather than referring to each other.  You have to admit that's rare (e.g. Dune, red hair, etc).  Some scholars of Nabokov consider any concept of serious tragedy, character, or dramatic relationship at the expense of the satire to be a complete misinterpretation of Lolita.  Others consider the opposite to be true.  That's what's great about art, and I suppose the critics, too.  You can all think something different and at the same time all essentially be correct...and I'm not just saying that to ease a let down here or because I secretly think you're idiots for disagreeing.  I genuinely find it all valid and worth appreciating.  I personally tend to gravitate toward the character-based, possibly because I find it more cathartically satisfying.  And whatever side of the argument you're on, I don't think you can deny that arc is here in this film.",1118793600,12,3178,5.118677042801556
1244002,5,B00001IVFF,"With apologies to Sting...

The main problem in comparing this to Nabokov's original is that Dolores in the book is 12 going on 13, and Dominique Swain comes across as 15 going on 35. Swain is a fine actress and she plays her part well, but something akin to Natalie Portman's performance and appearance in the Lolita-esque ""Leon - aka The Professional"" would have been much closer to the mark.

Irons does his usual impeccable job in the telling of this almost tragi-comic tale of the futility of obsession and of basic human alienation, and Irons and Swain do succeed in carrying things off.

Few movies tend to follow the book slavishly, and when the movie works brilliantly, as with Sally Potter's 'Orlando' or Spielberg's 'Empire Of The Sun', the Directorial license can be easily justified. Lyne's Lolita did not work as well as the other two adaptations, but it remains a fine movie, and is certainly not significantly inferior to the Kubrick version.",1116374400,7,958,4.829268292682927
1244003,5,B00001IVFF,"A misconception with this film is that it's a remake of Stanley Kubrick's classic version. However, it is simple a remake of the novel by Vladimir Nabokov - and a much better one at that. The time in which Kubrick made Lolita (how could they ever make a picture of that) was stiff and he had to rely more on wit and insinuation than blatant content. Thus, his version seems very watered down, and doesn't have nearly the wit, the sardonic humor, or the sick obsession coming through that this new version is able to have. Even this film was met with opposition, even in the late 1990's.

The acting of Jeremy Irons is superb. He's funny the one minute, sick the next, and lovestruck in the next - and we are convinced by all of it. Dominique Swain's portrayal of Lolita is by far better than Sue Lyon's original in 1962. Lyon seemed too old, and her actions and simple externals made it rather unbelievable. Swain, though, was merely still a child when Lolita was made, and gives a gutsy, visceral, real performance that should be lauded as the best of her career. There are some holes here and there, but it's forgiveable, to be honest. She gave a great performance to a very meaty part - especially since she had never acted before in her life. Bravo. The portrayal of Lolita is more like the book's as well, with touches of childhood mixed in with sensual adult characteristics. The way the movie was filmed (out of order, like usual) Swain, growing up in real life, seems to grow in one scene and go back to being a child in the next. The differences are neglible, though, because the Lolita character in the novel was neither a child nor a young adult. It's a little bit of unintentional play that I found rather interesting.

Frank Langella and director Adrain Lyne's portrayal of Quilty is also much more like the novel's. In the novel, his name is only mentioned a few times until the ending chapters, and Humbert Humbert only sees him as a bald head with a moustache, slipping in and out of he and Lolita's lives like a sick chameleon. His performance is superb as well, albeit short.

American audiences, of course, satisfied with blood, murder, gore, and obscenity, hailed this film as ""inappropriate"" and it got a hard time. The fact is, the subject matter of the book is very appropriately and intelligently conveyed. The novel was smart, lyrical, and beautifully written - and this film adaptation is also smart, lyrical, and beautifully made.

I read the book after seeing this movie version, and I have never experienced any film coming closer to snagging the book's story - but more importantly it's character and life. It's one of the best, if not THE best adaptations I have ever seen.",1116115200,25,2704,4.6037344398340245

The DVD contains nearly a half-hour of footage cut from the movie, and all of it is well-edited and of a high enough quality that it very well could have been included in the movie. The deleted scenes are complete with voice-overs from the narrator and in some cases special effects, adapting memorable scenes from the novel that weren't included in the final cut of the movie. There's also casting footage of Irons and Swain rehearsing scenes off-set, which isn't much to write home about but still a nice addition. There's definitely much more bonus content to this DVD than I'm used to seeing in DVD releases.

Note: The DVD edition of this movie I purchased is from the Lion's Gate ""Signature Series"" and has a maroon border around the cover image with a picture of Adrian Lyne's signature at the bottom.

Another thing that played a large part in my liking of the film is the fact that Dominique Swain is hotter than Sue Lyons. Melanie Griffith isn't as good as the original actress and I agree with other viewers, that she is the weak link in the film. Frank Langella is a lot more mysterious than Peter Sellers. Jeremy Irons performance is a lot sadder than James Mason's. I though that this movie was terrific. One thing I liked was director Adrian Lynes choice not to show Langellas face until the end. And one thing I didn't like was Lyne's choice not to show Swain naked except for (quite literally) a split second. Nudity, is necessary for a film like this, The film is about a man named Humbert Humbert (Irons),  who has received a teaching job in America and needs a place to stay for the summer. So, he moves in with Charlotte Haze (Griffith) who takes quite a liking to Humbert. Humbert however dislikes Charlotte, but is smitten with her daughter, Dolores,
whom he calls Lolita. Lolita reminds Humbert of a girl in his younger years who died. But the love Humbert has for Lolita is not a pedophiles lust, but a deep love he has for her as a person. This love however is challened by playwright Clare Quilty
(Langella). Irons is great in his best performance and this is one of the saddest films I have viewed. I liked Kubricks, but there is one thing I need to add. At the end of Kubricks it tells you what happened to Humbert, not Lolita. In Lyne's version it tells you what happened to Lolita, which seems to soften the blow. But only makes the film sadder.

1244020,1,B00001IVFF,"This movie is terrible.  Whoever made it turned Kubric's masterpiece into a piece of trash.

Its one saving grace was the director's seeming foresight to avoid emulating the original Quilty, as emulating Sellers' performance properly would have been an impossiblity.

Just when you thought things couldn't get any worse and you can't wait for the movie to be over, they have to show you a [...].

The music is inappropriate.  The mood is overly sentimental.  The acting is sub-par.

The narration is a cop-out.  Instead of telling Nabokov's story through subtle twists in the interaction between Humbert and Lolita, they use an annoying narration to make up for what the acting can't do.  And they add and change a couple small things about the plot, which only makes things worse.  Some say Kubric butchered the original screenplay in his adaptation, but it doesn't matter if that's true because it made for a very good movie.

One positive thing about this movie is that Dominique Swain (Lolita) is made to look very young and very attractive, as is essential.  But this movie isn't supposed to be about the audience getting turned on by a 14-year-old; feeling uncomfortable is the suitable reaction.

I would give this movie no stars if I could.  Consider that one for Kubric.  Kubric's Lolita was a great, amazing movie.  And for some reason, this guy comes along and decides to redo it, as if there were something to be redone.  If it ain't broke, make your own damn movie.

Don't even waste your time looking at the cover of the DVD.  Buy the 1962 version.  Then watch the original Planet of the Apes or the original Godfather.

When Humbert first meets Lolita in the novel she is 12 going on 13. Lolita realizes the power she has over Humbert and plays with him, so to say. I don't see that coming across here. In this movie, we know that Lolita and Humberts relationship is consentual, but most often, Swain makes Lolita seem like a whiney little brat. I did not like Melanie Griffath in the role of Charlotte Haze, the lonely widow desparate for Humberts affections. She doesn't come off with as much desparation and annoyance as she should. This film focusses too much on the sexual relations of Lo and Humbert. For example, when Mrs. Haze comes in after Lolita has skipped back to her room and asks Humbert, ""is she keeping you up?""",1106438400,7,939,4.433526011560693
1244022,1,B00001IVFF,"Of course I haven't downgraded it for this reason, but just in case your interest in this is prurient, you may as well know off the bat that the only one who bares any flesh at all here is Quilty the aged, pudgy, sagging playwright. There's a long full-frontal completely nude shot of him.

Now let's cut to the chase: The director, Adrian Lynne, hasn't a clue what the book's about. This is obvious if you watch the film, but Mr. Lynne corroborates it in a segment affixed to the end. He predicts that the aspect of the film that will provoke discussion is that audiences will not hate Humbert Humbert as much as they think they ought to. Guess what, Adrian? The book is a COMIC FARCE! Nobody who understands it takes it SERIOUSLY. THAT'S why they don't hate Humbert. Even though it's a comic farce, it's also literate, knowing, and witty. Lynne hasn't merely killed the comedy; he's also removed all traces of intelligence and pumped it full of kitschy sentimentality.

Melanie Griffith as Charlotte Haze (yes, I spelled her surname correctly) can't act as well as an average high school kid. Jeremy Irons walks through his part. What's-her-name as Lolita overdoes everything. She's constantly, every second, the most obnoxious brat you can possibly imagine.

At one point the film has a school official complain to Humbert that Dolores (Lolita) is ""morbidly disinterested [sic] in sexual matters"". ""Disinterested"", of course, means ""impartial"", not ""uninterested"". I checked the book: It reads ""morbidly uninterested in sexual matters"". The screenwriter didn't merely err here; he went out of his way to be illiterate.",1105142400,15,1621,4.952205882352941

Even tho I been a fan to her, she's always sounds great. But now since I bought this movie, it made me enjoy it. One of my things about this movie is that it tells it all right here.

It the story between a man dating a 14 year old girl. Like if you seen the original which was back in '62, you would notice there's a difference between those two films. I would love to carry this out to those who want to know the real story.

This is similar to those who remember the sex scandals of R. Kelly and Jerry Lee Lewis and Amy Fisher. To me, I'm not thinking about being a pedofile or anything, I'm different than that. Just like the bible says ""Flee fornication"". I don't think it'll turn me into that 'cuz that's what not my life is. My dream is be kind to kids w/o ever dating or making a relationship.

1244024,4,B00001IVFF,"If anything can be said about this second film version of Nobokov's famous book, is that the visual stylings and look of the times and places were basically spot on. It's when we get to the plot that things don't work as well.

The reason I believe for the toning down of sexual activity in the film by the Director was not because of the worry about controversy, since his previous works were much heavier than this; it was the censors and lawyers themselves who kept a vigilant eye on the film during the editing and filming stages that dropped the plot down a notch.

The basic story of Lolita is still present but in a more compact package. Dominique Swain, to me, is the perfect Lolita as is Jeremy Irons as Humbert. The supporting cast fit well, too. In the end, Lolita is a sad film, all controvery aside and does deliver it's message, if it is almost too little too late.

Still, I prefer this version over Kubrick's more for the talent of the actors and the set design. If only Kubrick and Lyne could've combined efforts, they would've made the perfect film.",1101772800,4,1067,4.461538461538462

I read the novel and loved it, then my dad recommended to watch Stanley Kubrick's adaption of it. I watched that and loved it. I was intrigued so i decided to check out the newer presentation of the film.

In short, Jeremy Irons is an excellent actor and excelled at playing Humbert; however, his supporting cast and the film direction is nothing spectaculr. I did enjoy the cinematography and Iron's voice overs from his audio reading of Lolita.  I certaintly do prefer the original movie which contained far more subtlety than this version, this isn't necessarily a bad movie, just an average film.",1101254400,5,705,4.818181818181818
1244026,5,B00001IVFF,"First, to really appreciate this film, you need to read the book. A lot of things will be lost on you if you don't, and you'll just end up writing a review that criticizes the wrong thing (like the time period it was set in - the novel was set in the 1940's; hence, the movie is set in the 1940's). Second, make no mistake, Lolita is the victim, not Humbert. Lolita is a child; Humbert is an adult, even though he is a sympathetic character. This movie is full of passion. There are themes of love, madness, obssession, the struggle of domination in relationships (because no relationship stands on equal footing - never happens, no matter how much you like to think it does for you). Hum and Lo constantly battle for the dominate role, and in the end they both lose. Lolita plays Hum like a fiddle, but she's only using what she's learned from him. She's 14 years old when this starts (12 years old in the novel), how much can she know (in the 1940's) about sex and older men? The allusions are powerful (the bobby pin clutched in Hum's bloody hand). The word play is brilliant (the first scene with Hum and Quilty on the porch, which is wonderfully filmed and edgy)and hats off to Nabokov for his poetic language. And I must say the most powerful scene in the movie is the scene where Humbert and Lolita reach the breaking point, becoming physically violent. Quilty's murder in the movie was true to Nabokov's novel: brutal and full of dark humor. Quilty died a violent death by Nabokov's hand, so Lyne gave him no less. This movie is eloquent, maddening, devastating. Even Nabokov's son praised this remake, saying it was superb and faithful to his father's novel. Lyne did a wonderful job making Humbert and Lolita and Quilty come alive. He couldn't fit all of Nabokov's many themes and word games into his film, so he pulled out the tragic love story, which is the heart of the novel. If you see the movie, read the book. If you read the book, see the movie. I do not make mention of Kubrick's film because to me it came off too up beat and too safe compared to the novel, but it was filmed in the 60's (not to mention that, though he credits Nabokov with the screenplay, Kubrick completely ignored Nabokov's script for the movie). Nabokov wrote a dark story and Lyne has done it justice. If Dimitri Nabokov called this movie ""suberb,"" sticking closely to his father's novel, then that's good enough for me! After all, who would know Nabokov's work better than his own son?",1100044800,11,2478,4.484513274336283
1244027,5,B00001IVFF,"This remake is far better than the original for someone who has seen neither. It is much more up to date cinematically and retains that touch of innocence mingling with the darkness. I have had both movies for some time and enjoy them equally. Jeremy Irons is a much underated actor and performs in this role perfectly. I have had use a lot of imagineering to get used to the idea of Melanie (check her out in Milk Money) being undesireable, however she pulls this role off admirably.",1090972800,3,484,4.511363636363637

1244029,4,B00001IVFF,"It is interesting to compare this movie and its predecessor to ""Pretty Baby.""

Some critics claim ""Lolita"" is a true love story.  I disagree.

Dominique Swain is beautiful and incredibly sexy; and Irons wants to possess her.  Realistically, this can not be, so conflict, and ultimately death, ensue.

In ""Pretty Baby,"" Brooke Shields is both adorably and stunningly beautiful, but not sexy, although she becomes a child prostitute.

While Swain obviously knows exactly what is on men's minds, Shields portrays a child playing at the sex trade.

Ultimately, Shield's photographer-lover lets her go on to a normal childhood, just as earlier he frees a bird trapped in the whore-house.  This is love.

Athough both films are visually beautiful, in ""Pretty Baby,"" Sven Nyquist's cimematography is transcendentally so.  His shots of Brooke Shields posing for her photographer-lover are like peering into the tender, throbbing core of life itself.",1088899200,4,941,5.340136054421769
1244030,4,B00001IVFF,"Certainly the most compelling screen version of Lolita, Adrian Lyne has a much better feel for the story than did Stanley Kubrick, and Dominique Swain is much better cast as the young femme fatale than was Sue Lyon.  But, the most striking feature of this film is the cinematography which gives the story a much more evocative feel.  While it is through Humbert Humbert that we see Lolita, Lyne finds more subtle ways to probe Lolita than did Kubrick, who treated her very much as an object.  I suppose in that sense it may have been a little closer to Nabokov's original telling, but Lyne has a more sensitive eye to detail and the devastating relationship that forms between Humbert and Lolita.  The script stays close to the novel.  Lyne lavishes much attention on the cross-country trip and the rain-soaked stay in New Orleans.  I felt Jeremy Irons did a better job than James Mason in capturing Humbert's psyche, better able to convey the emotions that led to his ill-fated obsession in Lolita.  The film also evocatively recalls the genesis for Humbert's obsession.  It was a bold move by Adrian Lyne, demonstrating a thoughtful understanding of the novel and not trying to add any form of moral judgement on it.",1082937600,22,1218,4.766666666666667

Well, I watch films for enjoyment and, if I'm lucky enough, enlightenment. Needless to say that this film provides both of the former with a masterful touch by visionary director Adrian Lyne. Lolita, played by the frustratingly enigmatic Dominique Swain, is confused by adolescent lust and acts out of sheer frustration. Swain is all too real here in her seduction of the easilly inclined Jeremy Irons, whom comes across, strangely enough, not so much as taking advantage of 14 yr. old Lolita's inclinations, but as a man that desperately needs to be rejuvinated by love again, mistaking youth as the fullfillment.

1244035,4,B00001IVFF,"Margaret Atwood once said when asked to compare her brilliant novel THE HANDMAID'S TALE with the movie based on it that one should repeat rapidly three times, ""The movie is not the book, the movie is not the book, the movie is not the book."" If you approach this movie with that mindset, you'll for the most part like this movie a lot. (More about what you may detest a little later.)
The best thing about this movie is Dominique Swain, who plays Lolita. Although she had no previous acting experience, she is perfect for the role: at times a sultry tease and other times an innocent little girl. I probably would have cast the rest of the characters differntly including Jeremy Irons although he does a commendable job as Humbert.
The sex or lack thereof is handled with great delicacy and class, I thought. Although it's probably unfair to this movie,  I would have liked it much better had I not just reread Nabokov's great novel. There is no way to convey visually what the novelist does with language since he is forever playing word games on the reader. Also the comic aspects of the written word are difficult visually although Irons has some success at this.
 Given those reservations,the first half of the movie is beautifully done. Then it goes South-- about the time Humbert and Lo start their journey by car all over the U. S., including the South.
So we cannot show sex between a teenage girl and an older man of the screen. That is as it should be. It's quite acceptable, however, to show bloody violence. I refer here to the scene between Quilty and Humbert that is so grisly to be almost unwatchable. The director needed a good editor for that awful 5 minutes of blood and gore.",1064966400,4,1694,4.550819672131148
1244036,2,B00001IVFF,"Okay, where are the smelling salts?  Somebody should've waved some under spineless Humbert Humbert's nose to have him wake up and take control of his life.  Watching LOLITA is like watching a slow-motion train wreck, yet more frustrating, simply because the characters are totally unpleasant--and because the wreck is so easily avoidable.
Jeremy Irons gives a wimpy sleaziness to the role of Humbert:  a revulsion akin to having some slimy creature crawling up your pants leg.  Only Humbert is crawling all over an adolescent girl, young Lolita Haze (Dominique Swain).  The obsession Humbert has for this immature, boorish teenager is revolting, and little Lolita--bless her vampy heart--responds by playing Humbert like a classical violin.  Accordingly, the viewer is forced to watch the dysfunctional development of a one-sided relationship, with the manipulative Lolita firmly in charge of an alleged grown man.
Such a relationship is destined for heartbreak, tragedy, and doom, and in this respect LOLITA doesn't disappoint.  We see several lives shattered, including a most bizarre confrontation between Humbert and another jellyfish competing for Lolita's prurient desires, the chain-smoking Clare Quilty (Frank Langella).  I had to book a double session with my shrink after watching that ugly piece of cinema, and I'm still having recurring nightmares.
Ultimately, LOLITA is the story of a man who fails dismally at being a man.  I'm a big fan of several of director Adrian Lyne's films--but this is not one of them.

1244037,3,B00001IVFF,"If you read the book or saw the original Lolita then this version will not please you. Jeremy Irons has made a career from playing sick or pathetic puppies and does his usual thing here. James Mason aroused pity, Irons makes your skin crawl.  Dominique Swain, a very pretty young actress who hasn't done much since, is too sexual. That may sound strange but this version of Lolita portrays her as more sexually wise than Humbert from the moment he first lays eyes on her. Melanie Griffin is dreadful. When Charlotte gets killed you'll be  grateful. Compare that to what Shelly Winters did. Her Charlotte was a silly, stupid woman but she was also clearly a  vulnerable woman who was lonely and in love for the first time in her life. Her death is a sad, pitiable thing.
Frank Langella is a sophisticated and completely evil Claire Quilty, he's good but I found myself thinking back to Peter Sellars' evil with a smiling face version of the character.  There are two really beautiful scenes in the film but they come at the end : first, when Humbert begs Lolita to come away with him and is soundly rejected and second, when he realizes that the big tragedy is not that Lolita is no longer in his bed but that she's not enjoying a normal teenaged life---in part because of Quilty yes, but mainly because of him and his insatiable need for her. Those two scenes will bring tears to your eyes but they aren't enough to save the movie. It's a big over produced mess and is just not good enough.",1056240000,4,1490,4.487084870848708

Lo-lee-ta."") we are introduced once more to the inimitable Humbert Humbert and his elusive quest for the Holy Grail in the form of ""nymphness"" personified. And oh what a sordid sorry trek it is, taking him and his young orphaned charge to some of the seamier spots of a fifties era American landscape. To cheap hotel rooms in little podunk towns where he can for a few fleeting days share a bit of privacy with his nubile naiad. Then of course, we follow the happy pair to the final confrontaion with one Clare Quilty, the only character in cinema/literary history who could make a pedophile like Humbert Humbert look wholesome by comparison.
  Remakes of movies always draw varying responses. Many critics and viewers were reluctant to favor this 1997 Adriane Lyne/Stephen Schiff/Jeremy Irons remake to the Kubrick/Nabokov/James Mason 1962 original. It's hard to argue when a novelist of the stature of Nabokov had such a direct hand in writing the screenplay (Kubrick was an uncredited co-author). Surely the work's creator would be better able to realize his vision cinematically? Yet, I believe the later film actually does a much better job in capturing the essence ot the novel.
  It boils down to casting. Shelley Winters was probably more right for the role of Lolita's Mom, Charlotte Haze, than was Melanie Griffith (almost universally described as the weakest link in the remake). That role aside, however, I think that every casting choice in the '92 version was spot-on. Irons, though he doesn't conjure up the physical characteristics of the Humbert that comes across in the novel, nevertheless did a better job than Mason in conveying Humbert's rakish libertinism. I'm so glad Dustin Hoffman, originally considered for the role, didn't land the part. This is amongst Irons' strongest performances. Dominique Swain, chosen over thousands of hopefuls who tried out for the part of Lolita, is the embodiment of all things young and lovely. I thought she also did a much better job than Sue Lyons at capturing the childish petulence that underlies most of the 12-year-old Lol's actions and reactions. She's just more believable, thanks in large part to Lyne's expert direction. Frank Langella was also much more convincing as Clare Quilty, a truly despicable fictional character, if there ever was one. Peter Sellers, due to his indelible comedic cinema persona, just could not come across as all that menacing on screen. He did, in fact, play the character for laughs, so the final confrontation came off more as farce and lost its effect.
  Finally, while Kubrick is one of the greatest directors in cinema history, he may have not been best suited for this particular novel. Plus, the era he was working in was much less conducive to a fully realized treatment of such touchy subject matter. He'd hit his comedic stride two years later, with Dr. Stragelove. Lyne had a bit more artistic leeway, although the history of the film's distribution was still rather bumpy, to say the least.
  Lyne has now come up with two of my favorite relatively recent films, this and the 1990 Horror film, Jacob's Ladder. He's another in what's become a rather large batch of excellent contemporary British directors. Please give this, his masterpiece thus far, a try.

1244060,3,B00001IVFF,"I so wish someone would make Lolita with the characters as Nabokov intended them. It would make for a fabulous movie.
But this is not it.
The film has some charming moments (especially some of the deleted scenes), some decently tense ones and a fairly gruesome killing of Claire Quilty. However, director Lyne is guilty of first degree murder of the real character of Humbert Humbert. In this movie it appears as though the poor Humbert is helplessly being swept along by the force of Lolita's budding sexuality. This may be an interesting idea for a story in itself but is decidedly not Nabokov's story. Nabokov's Humbert is precisely such a dramatic character because he is warped by the immense internal struggle of his strong morality with his utterly diabolical desires for a Lolita who at first is quite innocent. Where is the crucial cathartic scene where Humbert's evil side finally wins a first victory over his formerly implacable morality, when he drugs Lolita in order to abuse her sexually without her awareness?
We also lose the Initial Lolita character in this movie. It seems like they dropped the rather more salacious Lolita, from somewhere around the middle of the story, right into the opening gambit. Making it seem as though she is rather more of a direct agent in her own corruption than Nabokov ever intended her to be. Nabokov intended to show how Humbert's intervention corrupts  an initially innocent Lolita to become the salacious and promiscuous Lolita we find at the end. Yet in this film it seems as though she might well have ended up that way anyway, Humbert or no Humbert.
Irons' acting in some parts is quite ludicrous. The idiotic smile on his face during the first sex scene is just too much. Caused laughs in my family. I don't think it was intended as comical. Swain's brave new interpretation of Lolita is interesting, but her blatant flirtatiousness right from the start, while cute in a way, does not make this story as good as it should be. This is a fault of the direction, not the acting.
The real Lolita has yet to be made. Kubrick's version was equally unsatisfactory, though for different reasons. Still, this film is worth watching if only to delight in a rather charming debut act by Swain.",1047945600,9,2240,4.77319587628866

But I found that this movie mimics the novel almost perfectly.  I was amazed at how well the actors portrayed the characters and brought them to life.  In the novel you get a good feel for the characters, but it is something very different to see them on screen.
Swain is the perfect Lolita.  Although she was given braces in the movie, that is the only difference I could find.  The director is great, he really brings out Lolitas tomboy ways with certain camera angles that show her ""I don't care"" attitude, like putting her feet on a dest while wearing a skirt.

I enjoyed the narration that Irons gives at the film's beginning, and the way he describes what kind of man would spot a nymphet among a group of schoolgirls.
I expected to see Humbert merely shoot Quilty at the piano, but it is much more drawn out and nastier than I could have imagined - definitely not entertaining.
By the time Lolita had left Humbert and he started tracking down the man she was with, I thought he was very pathetic.  Especially when he is preparing to shoot Quilty.
I like the four deleted clips on the DVD, especially the first two.  The lack of a music track adds to their realism.
I really like the photography of Lyne's films, but they are definitely not uplifting.  Many have disaster in them.  I really don't  think you want your kids to see a Lyne film except maybe ""Foxes"" or ""Flashdance"".
Lyne makes films similar in tone as Ridley Scott in that they both go for the darkness and morbidity of human nature.  That's my comparison anyway.  Lyne's are more melodramatic and adult-oriented than Scott's.
I don't recommend this film for the narrow-minded and/or the faint of heart/nerve/stomach - especially the last half hour.",1046908800,3,1336,4.6075949367088604

This is the light and dark of humanity all wrapped up in a compelling story.",1033689600,4,593,4.851485148514851
1244066,5,B00001IVFF,"This was such a great movie. Im not going to compare it to the book, because the book is always so much more wonderful. But this movie had wonderful cinematography that absolutely blew me away. Jeremy Irons is so believable as Professor Humbert, and Dominique Swain did a phenomenal job in her breakout performance.
My favorite part had to most definitely be when Dolores(Lolita) was leaving for camp, and she ran back into the house and jumped into his arms, kissed him, and ran back out again. That certain scene got nominated for an MTV movie award in the Best Kiss category. (I think it should have won)
This movie takes some startling turns, and at the end, you are half glad that Humbert ends up where he does. But you also wish that maybe, as dysfunctional as the relationship was, they had stayed together. This movie has it all. Even though I am just a teenager, I would reccomend this to adults (Read the book first, though.)",1030579200,,935,4.571428571428571

1244088,5,B00001IVFF,"This film is absolutely breathtaking. Placed in the late 1940s the costuming and scenery add to the beauty in a way that the 1962 version fails. Each role is perfectly cast. Jeremy Irons conveys his absolute lust and unending devotion to Lolita from their very first encounter in the piazza with such gentle execution. At the end, in his demise, you can't help but be saddened by the loss of the passion with which he expresses himself to Lolita. He is piteous, and she spoiled, but they control each other and depend on one another in such a way that in the end their relationship destroys them both. Dominique Swain is absolutely sensuous and alluring even while playing the 11-year-old Lolita, and through her interpretation we are able to see the source of Humbert Humbert's lust and adoration. How could he help but be smitten by this absolutely divine and devilish creature? Their relationship is always complicated, but always believable.
If you've read the book, please see this movie. As in any movie adaptation, there are sections left out, but I don't find the film to be lacking in any way. If you've seen the older version with James Mason and were disappointed, then give this movie a chance, because the scenery, the music, and above all the effective portrayal of the two classic characters will make you fall in love with the story (if you haven't already done so).",1028332800,7,1382,4.7625

1244090,3,B00001IVFF,"If you think the novel was sexy, please read it again carefully.  It is without a doubt one of the best works of literature in the 20th Century, but it definitely is not sexy.
This is another example of a movie not living up to a work of great literature.  For one, and this is very problematic, the character played by Jeremy Irons is no where near the moral monster created by Nabokov.  Humbert Humbert, as people who hastily read the novel NEVER remember, is the man who contemplates the day when Dolores loses her ""magic nymphage"" and bares him a child, ""a Lolita the Second who would be eight or nine around 1960."" (p. 174).  In other words, this pedophile could double his vileness by adding incest into the mix.  And the other instances of his moral nullity are too many to mention.  The only problem is that readers get snowed by him and charmed by his style and forget all about his violation of a young girl.
I write these lines because the Top 500 reviewers gives a contradictory message.  On the one hand, he says that Humbert Humbert's crime was his possessiveness and the perverted nature of his love for her.  Meaning, I presume, that parents and guardians shouldn't rape or force sex on their children.  But then in the last paragraph the reviewer says that,""she [Dolores, a 12 year old girl] has all the sexual power.""  That is nonsense, and it is dangerously misleading do say so.  Just because a pedophile craves her doesn't mean that she has any power whatsoever.  His repeated manipulations and outright forcings of her demonstrate as much.  I just wish Irons and Lyne had enough sense to keep this in mind about H.H..
So if the movie misreads the novel's main character, how good can it get?  There are tense and moving scenes, but all-in-all, it's too ""cute.""  The problem with the cinema medium here is that we view the scenes with some objectivity, watching both characters speak and act, whereas the novel is strictly within the parameters, the poetic and montrous parameters, of Humbert Humbert's mind.",1028073600,8,2029,4.660112359550562
1244091,2,B00001IVFF,"This film suffers from a fatal flaw: not one of the four characters is even remotely sympathetic. After a perfunctory glance at the main character's past, we are suddenly thrust into his intense infatuation with the 'nymphette' of the title. We are rarely given a clue into who he really is, and only ever see him as he is when overwhelmed with a pathological sexual obsession with a teenage girl. Throughout the rest of the film, we are only introduced to two other characters, and we have no reason to like any of them; more to the point, there is no reason to care what happens to any of them.
The director is at pains to continually refresh our memory as to the fact of Lolita's age (she is 14, unlike in Kubrick's earlier version, which made her 16, for obvious reasons) usually at the moment just where she is most sexually alluring, by giving us some visual reminder of her youth: braces; bubble-gum. The effect is quite sickening, but it is not enough to make us feel anything for the character. This might not be so regrettable if we were given someone else with whom to identify; as it is, we are left with nothing to draw us into the story, no overriding reason to be concerned with any of the characters, none of whom elicited in this reviewer anything other than indifference to their plight.",1022371200,4,1305,4.510548523206751

The subject matter alone keeps plenty of folks from experiencing the depth of emotion and honesty these characters display, or the core resounding themes of forgiveness, beauty and the spiritual levels of sex so many people would rather do without.  Suffice it to say, it's an exploration of an intimate, delicate matter - yet one that would not have seemed so out of place just a few generations ago..that of an older man longing for a child-becoming-a-woman.  Swain's grace is a perceptive trait she's given to the character, lending her weight and value rather than just being a source of scorn or pitty.  Far from it, Swain makes Lolita likeable, an adult feeling child for whom sitting on an older man's lap retains its innocence and charm, while at the same time evokes new, unexpected feelings and sensualities that complicate matters...Uncynical, fresh and perceptive, this Lolita is a joyous bittersweet tale of redemption and loss, with startling performances from the two leads.",1012694400,,1097,5.1807909604519775
1244095,4,B00001IVFF,"This is an excellent adaptation of Vladimir Nabokov's brilliant book about the sordid relationship between a grown man and a teenage girl.  Although still disconcerting, the subject of pedophilia is far less shocking today than when the book was published almost 50 years ago.  Yet, despite the subject matter, the book was wildly popular because it was a literary work of art, beautifully written with some of the most splendid metaphors and descriptive narrative in American literature.  This was all the more amazing when one considers that English was Nabokov's second language.
Director Adrian Lynn (Fatal Attraction, 9  weeks, Indecent Proposal) is no stranger to stories with perverse sexual content.  His presentation of the story does the book justice although certain interpretations may not have been what Nabokov had in mind.  Lynn gives us a presentation that is very sympathetic to Humbert.  Nabokov's Humbert was very complex, partly a victim of his fixation on young girls, partly a sexual predator and partly a hopeless romantic.  Nabokov's Lolita was extremely innocent, just approaching the threshold of sexual curiosity and urges, more playful than consciously provocative.  While Nabokov hints at a mutual seduction, he leans far more heavily towards Humbert as the cause of the events even though Humbert is clearly helpless in the face of his obsession.  Lolita entered into the sexual relationship more as a result of longings burgeoning from her blossoming sexuality than a desire to seduce Humbert in particular, who was not even her first lover.
Lynn's presentation transforms Humbert from the seducer into the seduced, whose weakness for young girls is manipulated by a sexually precocious siren tempting him to dash himself on the shoals of pedophilia.  Lynn portrays Lolita as the aggressor, an adolescent temptress who knows she is desired and simultaneously teases and entices him to do her lustful bidding, knowing he is powerless to resist.  Lynn's Humbert is more of a hapless romantic than a fiend, ennobling him as a victim of love rather than the confounded sociopath he really is.  In Lynn's version, Humbert becomes the fly to Lolita's spider.
However, after the initial seduction when they take to the road, the film is very true to the book in chronicling the decay of the relationship showing Humbert's further plunge into feelings of romantic desperation and Lolita's shrewish exploitation of him as she increasingly uses sex as a weapon.  The book was very effective at portraying the relationship as a symbiosis of two deficient beings, each selfishly taking from the other what was needed.  Lynn does an excellent job of portraying that here.  As the relationship degenerates, Lynn is effectual at portraying the ugly side of both characters.  The bitterness and rancor that results is compelling.  To his credit, he understands that Nabokov's story was more of a character study than a sex story and Lynn avoids the temptation of becoming too lurid, focusing instead on solid character development of two very flawed beings.
I must take a moment to give Lynn the highest praise for his period renderings.  This is one of the finest portrayals of 1940's Americana I can remember.  The costumes, hairstyles, cars, furniture, locations and sets create a 40's reality that is like being hurtled back in a time machine.  The music is not just precise for the period, but it is perfectly integrated with the story.  As the two travel, the music changes to reflect the region.  Having Lolita dance and sing to period music on the radio is a nice touch because that is exactly what teenage girls of any era are apt to do.
The acting is first rate all around.  When the film was made, Dominique Swain was 17, and although she looked young for her age, she could never pass for 12.  So for the first part of the film before Charlotte's demise, she is simply too mature.  However, for the road trip she is ideal.  Though I don't agree with Lynn's early interpretation of Lolita as the teenage temptress, I can't imagine it being done any better than the performance Swain delivers.  She is playful and provocative in a childlike manner, part pixie and part vamp.  Once they get on the road, Swain hits stride with a performance that is almost a force of nature.  She is powerful and intense, effortlessly moving back and forth between sweet innocence and the emotional torrent typified by the ""murder me"" scene.  It is an outstanding performance with depth and breadth that is very unusual for an actor so young.
Jeremy Irons is wonderful as Humbert, giving him as amiable a personality as one could possibly imagine for a character with such vile intentions.  Irons injects a good deal of wry humor into the part in addition to giving Humbert an almost quixotic romantic quality.  Melanie Griffith is just the wrong actress to play Charlotte.  She looks nothing like the portly and plain character described in Nabokov's book.  Though her acting is fine and she is appropriately obsequious, she is far too attractive to be the repulsive troll Humbert despised.  It takes away from Humbert's desperation because it hardly seems like a great sacrifice to have married Charlotte to be near Lolita.
Frank Langella (Dracula) is more obnoxious than mysterious as Quilty, making the audience want to exhort Humbert to pull the trigger as he confronts Quilty with the revolver.  Again, I think this is probably Lynn's doing since his vision is clearly that of a Humbert sympathizer.
This is a fine film with great production values, terrific performances and a classic story.  I feel that it surpasses Kubrik's adaptation in its ability to capture many of the finer points of Nabokov's book, even though Nabokov collaborated on the Kubrik film.  I rated it an 8/10.  It is definitely worth digging out of the rental stacks.",1012608000,20,5853,5.0

1244127,2,B00001IVFF,"Lynn's version of Nabokov's novel is more faithful to the literary events of the novel, but totally misses on tone. True Nabokov's readers find themselves thrust into the uncomfortable position of seeing things through the eyes of a pedophile, but Lynn gives us pure pornography. Gone are the telling details in the text that reveal more obsession than love. Nabokov's readers are forced to decide whether they stand with Quilty or Humbert - a Hobson's choice if there ever was one. Lynn's version does not provide that opportunity. He has completely sexualized this Lotita. We only see her through Lynn's eyes as some kind of pin-up.
Say what you will about the literay faithfulness of the Kubrick version, but it totally wins on tone. We are always let in on the lies Humbert tells himself. We see Lolita, not as a young woman experiencing an early sexual awakening, but as a girl taking advantage of her power over Humbert.
The only redeeming element of Lynn's version is Jeromy Iron's narration. It made me rather long for Iron's to record Lolita as a book on tape.",1010620800,10,1069,4.783783783783784

1244129,3,B00001IVFF,"At first, no film version of this novel can be better than the book...
Adrian Lyne had a lot of problems with making this film. Psychological problems:

2. The first adaptation was made by one of the best directors, by great Stanley Kubrick.
Than, of course, problems with censorship which is as sanctimonious as fifty year ago.
Problems of appropriate casting etc etc...
And so what do we have? Hmmm... This picture is really hard to be talking about. In some way it is good. Positive sides: wonderful music, wonderful landscapes, OF COURSE, great Jeremy Irons (Dominique Swain was pretty good but not enough to be called great). Negative sides: this picture should be better if it wasn't cut in such a way, its spirit is not a spirit of the novel, it's too melodramatic, Humbert Humbert is more romantic than Nabokov's cynical intellectual.

Two thumbs Up! BUY IT!",1006041600,,779,5.24
1244131,4,B00001IVFF,"Am I the only person who finds the elimination of the comedic element from this story an improvement?  The emphasis here is on the quiet desperation of Humbert's madness rather than on his hysterical enthusiasm for Lolita.  When you open the book and read ""Lolita, light of my life, fire of my loins!"" you silently guffaw, already knowing that Nabokov intends him as an object of the same sort of amused contempt Humbert himself heaps on the cheap American scenery around him. When I heard Jeremy Irons sensuously, almost distractedly murmuring the very same words on the movie's voiceover, I was moved to compassion - and stayed there straight through the end of the film.
Hence Nabokov's Humbert and Lyne's Humbert are two very different men. With all due respect to the original, I feel that the Irons/Lyne Humbert is much more the sort of fellow who could realistically pull off such crimes without getting caught. He is silent, brooding; he guards his hand closely, escaping detection (by all except Quilty) no matter how flagrant his relations with Lolita become. I'd always thought the original Humbert was too busy sneering at Americans to successfully cover his own rear end. As played by Irons, he has no such defect.
The film's only major flaw is the characterization of Lolita.  Instead of re-translating her to correspond to the new Humbert, the movie lifts her straight from the book; and the Lolita of the book is the flat object of Humbert's deluded projections. In the book, it's understood that we are seeing things through Humbert's twisted eyes; but Dominique Swain presents as an objective reality his self-serving fantasy that Lolita is the aggressor. There might be something to be said for that, to magnify even further our sympathy for Humbert; but it just doesn't make sense that a girl of that age and time would have the sexual confidence to throw herself at a grown man with such an utter lack of hesitation. In fact the film's Lolita isn't just aggressive, but supremely confident that she has Humbert in the palm of her hand.  Of course, after a while he gives her plenty reason to think so; but Swain's Lolita lacks self-doubt from the very beginning - which rings quite false, at least to this twentysomething female reviewer.  Consequently, when she later cools to Humbert and starts lording it over him one senses none of the satisfaction of genuine character development.
Unlike many others I feel that Melanie Griffith, who is way past her prime as a sex object, was the perfect choice for ""fat cow"" Mrs. Haze. It's not that her figure is all that far gone, but the combination of that persistently infantile voice and her tawdry over-the-hill prettiness - accentuated by the heavy, greasy makeup, garish Lucille Ball dye job, and form-fitting period wrap dress - produces exactly the Mrs. Haze the plot requires: attractive enough to blindly believe that she's the one Humbert likes, but too worn out to really distract him from Lolita's freshness. No disrespect to Ms. Griffith; it's her ability to play up her unique traits without flattering the character that makes Mrs. Haze so gratingly real.",1006041600,4,3136,4.898305084745763
1244132,3,B00001IVFF,"Its grotesquely unfair to such talented folks as director Adrian Lyne, Jeremy Irons, Frank Langella, and Dominique Swain but its impossible to really give their efforts to create the second film version of Nabakov's dark comedy a totally fair hearing.  If you've seen Kubrick's brilliant 1962 version, its hard to watch this second film without comparing the two.  If you want more explicit raciness, than you'll probably have a better time with Lyne's version (and to be honest, who doesn't sometimes want more explicit raciness?).  However, if you're looking for a film that manages to capture Nabakov's sly wit and the wonderful perversity of his language, Kubrick's version remains unparralelled.
Anyway, taken on its own merits, Adrian Lyne's Lolita is a more-or-less average film dealing with Humbert Humbert's sexual obsession with the young nymphet Lolita Haze.  Lyne has always been a flashy director but on the whole, he's far more subdued here than he has been in the past and that works to the film's credit.  Since soft-core variations of this same premise have been showing up on Cinemax for the past few decades, Lyne doesn't sensationalize Humbert's attraction but proceeds rather matter-of-factly.  In short, he directs the film in the exact opposite of the way we'd expect him to direct it and that brings a needed level of surprise to a story that is no longer as shocking as it once was.  Though the script is never more than mediocre (jettisoning much of Nabakov's complex wordplay, probably to make the film more ""accessible""), Lyne does come up with some beautiful images.  While Kubrick's film showed us how beautiful black-and-white can be, it would be unfair not to mention that Lyne's version does the same thing for color.  Another reviewer put it best (and so I won't try to claim this insight for my own) when they said that Lyne's images supply the eloquence of Nabakov's original prose.
As for the acting, its a mixed bag.  As Lolita's mother, Melanie Griffith is rather shrill and never seemed to be truly into the character.  As readers of the book know, the character is one that can both break your heart and annoy you to death.  Griffith does neither.  She just seems to be Melanie Griffith, slumming.  Jeremy Irons is a perfect choice for Humbert and there lies the problem.  His casting is too obvious and there's nothing really subversive or shocking about discovering this man is a pedophile.  Its a bit like making a film about an overeducated gentleman who is revealed to be a cannibal and then casting Anthony Hopkins in the role.  Sure, we know Hopkins can play the part but who's really going to be surprised?  Frank Langella, as the equally perverse Clare Quilty, shows the potential to be a fascinating character but Lyne doesn't seem to know what to do with him and as a result, Langella just sort of pops up whenever the story needs to be pushed forward.  However, Dominique Swain is an excellent Lolita and, unlike Sue Lyon in the original, shows evidence of being a fine actress in her own right.  She brings a beguiling sense of self-centered innocence and a destructively niave sexuality to her role and, finally, she makes the film worth watching.",1004313600,8,3202,4.872693726937269

In short, don't let the movie spoil the book for you. There are some great cinematic moments, though: wet Lolita, lying on the lawn; Charlotte walking on the Hourglass lake bridge; piano keys stained with Quilty's blood, and especially the blood bubble (""with juvenile connotations"") on his lips' one of the novel's most striking images.

1244134,3,B00001IVFF,"Although Adrian Lyne's Lolita is a good film adaption of Vladimir Nabokov's superb novel, it contains fatal flaws. First I will say that the cinematography is glorious and the score by Ennio Morriconne lush and romantic. I expected Jeremy Irons as the obsessed Humbert Humbert to turn in a mind blowing performance. Unfortunately, he stands around looking glum most of the time. Dominique Swain as the nymphet Lolita does have several impressive moments, but ultimately is unconvincing as she comes across as nothing more than a 90s brat. I will say though that the relationship between Humbert and Lolita does have its very powerful moments, just not enough of them.
I don't hold these faults to the actors. I think Adrian Lyne, the director is responsible for the films flaws. For one thing, he seems to want to make Lolita look as unattractive as possible every chance he gets. She takes out her retainer before performing oral sex on Humbert, and is frequently seen munching on bananas and getting milk mustaches. Also in one scene, we see Lolita sitting diown, laughing as she reads a comic book. The camera moves away to reveal that Humbert is making love to her. This and other scenes make the relationship between Humbert and Lolita repulsive, and if you're going to make a film based on Lolita, their relationship can't be portrayed as disgusting. The audience must be made to feel the love that Humbert has for this girl. It only partially succeeds. Irons also fails most in the ending scene where Lolita tells Humbert that she never loved him. Irons merely cries for two seconds and leaves. James Mason in Kubrick's version is much more moving. I also have a problem with the fact that Lyne seems to have duplicated the Kubrick film shot by shot in that scene.
My last qualm is that this adaption is nearly completely devoid of humor, which is an essential aspect of Nabokov's story. Melanie Griffiths gives a fine performance as Charlotte Haze, but she is given far too little screen time. Frank Langella as Quilty is also quite amusing, too bad he only gets ten minutes to show it. Thus, when a 17 year old Lolita reveals to Humbert that it was Quilty who put her away, we don't care. It should be a revelation, but it is not. Quilty's death scene offers an infusion of black humor, but it is too little, too late. Jeremy Irons last few scenes as an emotionally broken Humbert are very moving though.
I give this movie three stars because for all of its faults, it is involving and does deserve to be seen and compared with Stanley Kubrick's 1962 adaption. Even though it falls short when compared to it.",997056000,22,2617,4.691304347826087

1244136,5,B00001IVFF,"Jeremy Irons plays Humbert Humbert, 40ish professor who falls in love disastrously with a 12-year old nymphet.  This movie is a closer adaptation of Nabokov's book than the Kubrick version.  One flaw of the Kubrick film was that it begins with the end and it gives away crucial plot points and takes away suspense.  In the Lyne version, the scene at the beginning takes place again near the end but this time, it reveals nothing.  Dominique Swain is excellent as the title character.  She looks and acts the part of the nymphet that Sue Lyons could have never have pulled off. Some have suggested that Miss Swain was too old to play a 12 year old child but Dolores Haze is not 12 for the whole book.  A good portion of the novel takes place after she is 12.  When they are on the road, she is 13.  When she is in the all girl's school, she is 14.  She is 17 at the end.  The movie is not without flaws however.  Some scenes of humor with Irons falls flat.  I found Melanie Griffith to be very annoying but then again Lolita's mother was suppose to be.  Thankfully she's only on screen for a short time.
Lolita is shown eating bananas in the movie.  Besides the phallic references, the bananas were used because the inspiration for Lolita came when Nabokov read a newspaper article about the first monkey to paint a picture.  The scientist gave him the tools to draw and the first thing he drew was the bars of his cage.  I can't say that this version of Lolita is better than the Kubrick, they each contain what the other misses.  Kubrick's version contains the humor that Lyne's version is lacking and Lyne's version contains the sadness that Kubrick missed.  Including reading Lolita, I would recommend that the viewer get both films.  For Lolita, is both a satire and a sad story rolled into one.  The two films in a way compliment each other.",995587200,12,1846,4.453731343283582
1244157,4,B00001IVFF,"Strongly recommended.  I began last evening intending to watch one of the 20 (!) DVDs in my 'to view' pile, everything from Vertigo to The Luzhin Defence.  I picked out Grosse Pointe Blank which I had bought on a friend's recommendation.  Needless to say I loathed it and ejected the DVD after half an hour and put Lolita on instead.
This beautifully shot film really kept me involved for its 2+ hours running time.  The performances are superb: Jeremy Irons is outstanding as always, but it is Dominique Swain's portrayal of Lolita which is really astonishing, considering that this was her first film role.
The script is a very close adaptation of Nabokov's book (unlike Kubrick's version).  The story of a man's obsession with his stepdaughter is powerful and ultimately tragic, with the final scene almost unbearably poignant.  Meg Ryan and Frank Langella have smallish roles which are well handled, but it's Irons and Swain who are on screen for 95% of the time.
Adrian Lyne's direction is wonderful, subtle and highly cinematic.  He also demonstrates that it is possible to infuse a film with an erotic charge (and this film is erotic on occasions) without resorting to excessive nudity.
The DVD is excellent, with a very fine 1.85:1 anamorphic image.  There are a few flecks during the opening credits, but after that the transfer is virtually flawless.  It is not a spectacular transfer (like JFK for example), but the beautiful photography comes across marvellously: 8 or 9 out of 10.  The orthodox but seductive orchestral score by Morricone comes over very well on the soundtrack.
The extensive extras include a very interesting excerpt (shot on videotape) of a couple of scenes in rehearsal with Irons and Swain: fascinating to see how this ends up in the film itself, as the scene is shown again just after the rehearsal clip.",993945600,10,1839,4.903225806451613
1244158,4,B00001IVFF,"I judge movie adaptations of novels by how closely they come to replicating what I heard and saw in my mind as I read the novel it was based off of. ""Lolita"", starring Jeremy Irons, matched the vision that my mind's eye saw as I read Nabakov's novel almost perfectly. Irons' voice sounded just like I imaginged Humbert's voice would sound like if I had met the poor fool in person. Lolita, played by Lyne, looked, acted and sounded just like the little Dolly Haze did in my mind as I read the book.

1244159,5,B00001IVFF,"Vladimir Nabokov described his best-known novel as ""a chronicle of my love affair with the English language"", and good lord, it is.  Thus, when I heard that they were making a movie, I was suspicious.  At least half of the pleasure of the book is Nabokov's intricate, loving, artfully stylized language.  How, I was concerned to know, was Lyne going to put that on film?  With intricate, loving, artfully stylizing cinematography, it turns out.  I have never in my life seen an adaptation of this kind where watching the movie provides the same ""feel"" that reading the book does, but that is exactly what Lyne achieves.  The juxtaposition of stylized, artistic composition with mundane details so real you can almost touch them, a hallmark of the novel, is perfectly realized onscreen.  Dominique Swain gives an extraordinary performance, expressing perfectly the movements and mannerisms of Dolores as described in the book.  Jeremy Irons is as superb as ever, and the sets and visual design bring Nabokov's grimy post-war America to the screen with all the perverse love for roadside motels, cluttered backseats, and bad taste that comes through in the novel.  My only misgiving with the adaptation is a tiny one: the replacement of Humbert's lovingly described .32 automatic with a terribly dull .38 revolver.  This admittedly geeky detail aside, this film still stands as the single finest adaptation of a novel I have ever seen.",988761600,12,1433,5.059574468085106

Jeremy Irons' amazing voice is just made for the voice-over, and the opening scene where he speaks for the first time is spellbinding.  Dominique Swain really captured the essence of Lolita; I find Lolita very annoying myself, but nevertheless she played the role well.  It's weird how the older-man, younger-girl relationship has been milked so much, but not much of the older-woman, younger-man relationship has been explored at all.  Why is that, I wonder. Overall, a great movie, great direction, the only criticism I have is some of the use of ""imagery""-the sharpening the pencil worked okay, but the bananas got a bit stupid.  Anyhoo, a great movie.

He finds that in young Lolita. She is virbrant, joyful, and full of energy. He falls madly in love with her and they go on a long roadtrip that eventually has deadly consequences.
""Lolita"" is a tale of lust, deceit, betrayal and love. It is a classic tragedy beautifully written and acted. Dominique Swain is magnificent as the young nymphette who Humbert Humbert falls in love with, and Jeremy Irons is excellent as the middle aged professor.",986083200,2,627,4.460869565217391
1244162,2,B00001IVFF,"Thank heavens Nabokov wasn't around to see this.
There is little sense of the peculiar, breezy humor in Nabokov's book, for one thing.  Director Lyne's cop-out textual ending of 'what happened to Lolita' is reason enough to dismiss this overly sentimental film as a misinterpretation of the novel.
The character of Claire Quilty is so poorly realized, I could only conclude that Lyne produced this for people who don't have the ability to read the book... that way, his audience couldn't say he got it wrong.  There's just one oddity after another in the interpretation.
Best thing I can say is that Dominique Swain makes a better nymphet than Kubrick's Sue Lyon.  Another plus is the perky, pleasant art direction.  Everything light as a summer's day.  But on balance, this tends to just make the whole thing strangely sappy and sentimental, with an added effect of placing the controversial plot in a time and place that no longer exist.  I have to wonder if Lyne was just too scared of what people would say.
For a rather better adaptation (considering especially the era of its production), do buy and watch (over and over) Kubrick's creepy stunner of the same title.  Kubrick really understood Nabokov's ability to suddenly show a situation from another, startling way... just watch how the demise of Claire Quilty is edited, and Nabokov speaks!",985046400,4,1350,4.920704845814978
1244163,5,B00001IVFF,"This isn't the book.  No filmmaker could possibly put the whole book on the screen and capture Nabokov's magic.  But this is so faithful an adaptation that it has to be put well above Kubrick's well-shot but cringe-inducing misfire.
How faithful is it?  Almost ALL the dialogue is directly from the book.  There's even a couple of points where the editing reflects the book!
Adrien Lyne shows us a side we never saw in ""Flashdance.""  He's understated, attentive, and caring for his actors.  Jeremy Irons and Dominique Swain (one wonders where she went) perform beautifully as Humbert Humbert and his Lolita.  Melanie Griffith is surprisingly good; I disagree with a previous reviewer, the point of Mrs. Haze isn't that she's repulsive but that she manifests everything Humbert finds repulsive about America.  The screaming, the violence, the pretending to be ""cultured"" when you're not.  Griffith is quite good at getting on your nerves; you can hardly blame Humbert for finding the woman intolerable.
This is a classic film and should be in your collection.  The minute I have the money, it goes into mine!.",980553600,3,1108,5.005464480874317
1244164,5,B00001IVFF,"when people hear that 'lolita' is about a guy who falls in love with a 12 year old girl and marries her widowed mother to get close to her, they are generally disgusted. but the way nabokov portrays the story, it makes absolute sense. adrian lyne's movie captured that sense of rightness perfectly, with the help of some ingenious actors. nobody could have been better for the role of lolita than domonique swain. her voice, face, body, and attitude are all those of a true nymphet. and jeremy irons is exquisite as humbert humbert, almost persuading us that it is perfectly natural for a forty year old man to be sleeping with a 13 year old girl. and the movie is so faithful to the book that most conversations can be recognized as verbatum. as 'vanity fair' said, 'lolita' is the only convincing love story of our time.",978825600,10,822,4.5608108108108105
1244165,4,B00001IVFF,"The first thing amiss with Adrian Lyne's ""Lolita"" is that Melanie Griffith is entirely wrong for the part of Charlotte Haze.  ""The Haze woman"" must be unattractive.  Shelly Winters in Kubrick's Lolita (1962) was perfect for the part because she was a woman who had lost her looks.  Charlotte must be unattractive as a contrast to Lo (and not just in Humbert's mind); furthermore the references to her as a ""fat cow"" and Humbert's disinclination to make love to her, do not play well if she's attractive.  Melanie Griffith is actually better looking than the young star, Dominique Swain, who plays Lolita.  Swain is pretty enough, however, and although not the great beauty that Sue Lyon (who played Lolita in the original) was, she does the coquettish muggings better than Sue Lyon did and she is allowed more latitude.  Humbert never even kissed Lolita in Kubrick's version!
Nonetheless, the second thing wrong with this interpretation is Swain herself.  Although wonderfully directed, she is ironically too old to be Lolita.  She is hardly a nymphet.
Jeremy Irons does a superior job of making us feel how sad and trapped Humbert is.  Frank Langella as the libertine Claire Quilty is excellent and wonderfully cast, but his role is limited.  Whereas Peter Sellers played several parts, including the school psychologist, Langella speaks in only two scenes, briefly at the Enchanted Huntress as a spats-wearing past-post Romeo, and then of course in the finale.
Where the Lyne film is clearly superior is in the minutia of the late-forties world of highway America: the country and western stations on the radio, the ""Notices"" on the back doors of the motels, the movie magazines and comics, the jaw-breakers and the gum under the dashboard, the many mid-drift children's outfits that Swain wears, the vintage motel and gas station signs, etc., etc.  Lyne also does a number of nice visuals.  The price tag hanging from the dark glasses Humbert is trying on as he desperately tries to see through two windows inside the gas station to what Lolita is doing with whom on the other side of their station wagon is an example.  And then there is that symbolic single cow at the end in the field with Humbert and the station wagon, suggesting a reincarnated Charlotte Haze observing what has befallen Humbert.
Unfortunately Lyne's attention wanders at times.  He has Humbert stare at Lolita in the important scene when he first spots her on the lawn much, much too long so that Charlotte could not help but notice his noticing.  And in the scene on the front porch, with the three of them together on the swing, Charlotte would have to be blind not to see the sex play between the two. And when Melanie quotes Humbert from his diary calling her ""that fat cow"" we can see by just looking at her that she is anything but.  And the scene with her on his lap while he is trying to read at his desk is totally ineffective since Melanie is quite fetching and most males would be happy to carry her off to bed.  Corny and tiresome were Lo's vanilla ice cream and milk mustaches.  And we could have been spared the obvious and trite ""symbolism"" of the bananas and lipstick as Lo rides in the car thinking of Quilty.
But it is entirely right that Lyne makes the motel rooms sorted and cheap.  He shows a sign advertising ""Children under 14 free"" at one of Humbert's choice stopping places, slyly reminding the cognoscente that Nabokov's nymphet should be younger than Shakespeare's Juliet, who was thirteen.  (Given the puritanical nature of the American psyche, neither Lyne nor Kubrick was able to make a ""true to the book"" film.)  She becomes a prostitute, effectively speaking, as she negotiates with Humbert over coins for her favors.  When Humbert tries to grab her saved-up money for fear she will use it to escape him, she shouts indignantly, ""I EARNED that money!""
The really terrible thing about Nabokov's tale that both directors got right is the unrelenting possessiveness of Humbert.  That was his undoing of course, and really shows the perverted nature of his love for her.  If he had really loved her, he would have stepped aside and let her live a normal life.  That's what fathers do.  That he loved her as a woman is not as much a tragedy as the jealousy and control.  Lolita makes this clear when as the pregnant ""Dolly,"" looking common and matronly in a cheap house with a working-class husband, she sees Humbert for the last time.  He begs her to go with him, but she tells him she would almost rather go back to Quilty.  Lyne adds a final wound by having Humbert ask her if she can ever forgive him for what he did to her, allowing Lolita to reply (addressing the dog) ""Molly, say good-bye to my Dad.""  ""Some Dad!"" is Lyne's message.
This interpretation will be more agreeable to some since it reenforces the idea that teen sexuality is wrong.  As usual, we see that nobody cares about the girl.  The feminists know she has the sexual power, and they are jealous.  They want her off limits so that they have a better currency themselves.  This is the political position of the sexual wars, and Lyne has fallen into it.  I think we need a French Lolita, as done by somebody like the late Louis Malle.  I don't expect this for another hundred years, however.  This film ought to kill the theme for quite a while.",978307200,18,5319,4.686759956942949
1244186,5,B00001IVFF,"Director Adrian Lyne's powerfully disturbing remake of the Nabokov novel benefits from perfectly realized performances by Jeremy Irons (as the obsessive Humbert) and Dominique Swain (in the title role).  Simply put, the 1997 ""Lolita"" is superb filmmaking and an improvement over Stanley Kubrick's uneven 1962 version. Unlike Kubrick, Lyne is more faithful to Nabokov in terms of atmosphere and narrative structure.  The postwar period detail is flawlessly evoked, while the supporting performances of Melanie Griffith and Frank Langella are more grounded in reality.",977011200,11,566,5.807228915662651
1244187,4,B00001IVFF,"This movie is well-directed and acted. Period music fills it with an authentically '40's feel. I think the film has a touch of film noir as  well. (There are some rainy night scenes, several scenes of shadows,  darkness, blue light and smoke, and some mysterious characters and plot  twists.) Also, Lolita and Humbert are ""on the run"" for much of  the film, which adds some suspense (and makes it even more film noir). (I  find it funny that Amazon includes this film in its ""Murder and  Mayhem"" category. I didn't know there was such a thing!)
In any  event, I think that's what I loved most about the film, the constant  travelling, moving on. I thought it was interesting too that the only  constancy between them as they drove from place to place was each other,  and that it was in this way that they really got to know one another and  love each other, two souls meandering. It seems an altogether American  story (road-trip/adventure) in that sense. I also liked seeing the actual  cars from that era, and the hotel rooms with the coin-operated music  players, etc. I think the director did a nice job with all of these  details.
Critics of the subject matter should know that this is not an  all-or-nothing movie, and that part of the tragedy of the story lies in the  very thing which creates it, ie: Humbert's obsession with girls who are  almost, but not quite yet, women. In other words, no one escapes  scot-free.
Jeremy Irons, true to form, digs deep into his character and  does an amazing job at showing the depth of Humbert's feelings, both the  elation he feels in his love/lust/relationship with Lolita, and the despair  when he realizes he can never really capture her in the way he wants/needs.  Lolita is his heaven and his hell.
Swain gives a solid performance as  Lolita (""Dolores Hayes""). She captures well all the  (contradicting) elements of graceful ""nymphette"" and awkward,  un-ladylike teenage girl. (It is this very contradiction that Humbert  himself tells us would not likely be enough for a ""normal"" man,  but which transfixes Humbert to his very soul.) With such a well-acted  first role, she shows great promise as an actress.
All in all, an  interesting way to spend an evening.
PS: The video I rented included a  behind-the-scenes segment which featured commentary by British director  Adrian Lyne and the cast. I found it interesting, but would suggest  watching it *after* viewing the film, because it shows scenes from the  whole movie, and may take some of the magic out of watching the plot unfold  by watching the film itself.",966297600,8,2570,4.750566893424036
1244188,4,B00001IVFF,"Ultimately, the great novel transcribed or adapted to the screen must fatefully fail.  Unavoidably, the comparisons between the two Lolita films must come about.  The original Lolita (1962) was directed by the late  Stanley Kubrick and was adapted for the screen by Nabokov himself.  To keep  things short in this review...the modern Lolita lacks one thing that the  earlier one had: a striking irony in the view and substance of the Lolita  character.  The original version depicts the nymph Lolita much more  convincingly.  Both films benefitted from a wonderful cast, although I  believe that Melanie Griffifth's (sp?) casting was somewhat of miscast.  Her performance was good, but I could never get the Shelley Winter's image  out of my mind.  Lastly...I felt something else missing from this version.

1244189,4,B00001IVFF,"This is no doubt a better and more faithful film adaptation of Nabokov's novel than Kubrick's 1962 attempt.  Humbert's European experiences, totally ignored in Kubrick's film, is mentioned.  Quilty's character was a  flamboyant and comic presence in Kubrick's film, is dark and mysterious  here, exactly the way depicted by Nabokov.  And of course, this film  portrays sexual feelings and behavior much more frankly than Kubrick's film  could have done in the 60s.
The DVD version contains Lyne's commentary,  footage of Swain's screen test, a featurette, 3 screenshots of the script  (why only 3? ), and 4 deleted scenes (including one where Humbert tries to  grab the apple from Lolita -- chapter 13 in the novel).",962496000,3,716,5.147826086956521

The movie poses the question, ""is Lolita a victim"" or is  she merely an opportunist? The film is full of delicious black comedy as  well.  Ultimately the destruction of Quilty and Irons himself suggest that  Humbert WANTED to be caught....Society never figured out what Humbert was  doing, the Priest at the school didn't catch on, Mrs Haze either committed  suicide or died by accident, The owners of the many hotels didn't suspect  anything, and so forth.  Humbert dreams of being caught, police bursting  in, detectives on his trail....He ""catches"" Quilty, and by this  action reveals his own self hatred and his desire to be caught.  The film  is unforgettable, simply beautiful to look at and marvelously acted, though  I do agree with other reviewers that the gorgeus Melanie Griffeth is sorely  miscast.

The  controversy around it went way out of proportion and may be done this film  a disfavor, unlike to other films.  Irons is so predictable and familiar  that viewers, who know his previous roles, can practically guess his every  gesture.  On the bright side, however, the overall take on Nabokov's story  is an interesting one. I enjoyed Mellany Griffith (her character playes a  significant part in the story, albeit she is given very little film time).

I was so affected by  Jeremy Iron's incredible performance as Humbert Humbert that I am still  shaking from its aftermath. That final scene in which Humbert stands on the  hilltop, his face speckled with the blood of the man he felt had destroyed  his happiness and in which he fully regrets his past actions that have lead  to the destruction of a young girl's innocence, will stay with me forever.  Kudos to you, Mr. Lyne for your integrity in standing firmly beside a film  that you obviously believed in very strongly.

Jeremy Irons is (almost) always good and Dominique  Swain is someone we'll all hear a lot more about in future. Stunningly  beautiful to look at, this movie adaptation of the Nabakov novel is I think  the way Nabakov would have wanted the story to be told.  I really can't  understand the references by other reviewers to the novel's being a comedy  -  to me it could not really be seen as other than a (modern day) tragedy.

1244194,5,B00001IVFF,"Adrian Lyne`s LOLITA will one day receive its due from film historians as the greatest cinematic work of the last two decades of the 20th century: a prize denied it at the moment as we war with one another over how we are to  face sexual and social reality. As Maurice Girodias wrote of the novel  ""Lolita"": ""I sensed that LOLITA would become the one great  modern work of art to demonstrate once and for all the futility of moral  censorship and the indispensable role of passion in literature."" So  does this speak also for Lyne`s film. Jeremy Irons, as Humbert, opens the  film with words from Nabokov`s novel. As he first catches sight of Lolita  (Dominique Swain), the camera focusses slowly and lovingly on her form as  she reclines on the lawn, surrounded by the wetness, lushness, humming  honey-dew freshness of the garden; reading a book, from which she looks up  at Humbert and smiles tenderly, tauntingly, knowingly - radiantly. She  returns to her book, but with a smile of realization; aware of him yet far  from troubled; silently already conspiring with him. Thus we meet Dominique  Swain, proving herself already in this opening scene one of the most  accomplished actresses of our time. The camera moves to dwell on her feet,  raised behind her as she lies reading, glistening against a backdrop of  floral beauty; nature wordless, far more eloquent than words. The camera  frequently focusses lovingly and interestingly on her feet. In a later  scene she sits beside him on the veranda of the Haze house, and Miss Swain  is so skilful an artiste that her movements and mannerisms are not at all  feigned, but are the natural movements, expressions and mannerisms of the  girl she plays, as though the camera were not there. The carefree jerking  of her bronzed legs and arms against his; the brush of her hair, carelessly  and as if unknowingly against his cheek. Her smile lights up the screen.  Her eyes mock society: its bigotry, its prejudice. ... ""I should call  the police and tell them you raped me, you dirty old man,"" she tells  Humbert later, smiling tauntingly and affectionately, her retainer showing,  making him smile too. She asks ""Want to see my chin wobble?"", and  wobbles it, making us with Humbert want to press our face, laughing,  against hers. She takes her retainer from her mouth and drops it in his  drink while her mother has left to get some ice. Frantically, he has to  fish for it and get it back in her mouth before her mother sees. He also  has to quickly dispose of her bubble-gum and pop it into his own mouth  before her  mother espies it. As out and out bigots condemned this movie  for its frankly realistic portrayal of love, so many of its half-hearted  defenders displayed cowardice in their would-be sympathy, disowning and  neutralising it with: ""...Of course, we know what Humbert is doing is  wrong,"" and ""... Of course, we cannot sympathise with  him.""!  And other such timid sell-outs and non-committal verbiage.  (Together with the academic so-called ""psychopathological  analyses"" etc., which are all so much garbage, and which Peter  Sellers` Quilty in the original Kubrick film version mocked so well!)
A  truly great film - one of the most moving and realistically performed of  all time - and a superb work of art for the more enlightened people of the  future to appreciate much better than we today are able to!

1244216,5,B00001IVFF,"Adrian Lyne's film is like a piece of art. Unlike Kubrick's version, I feel that this film is the epitome of Vladimir Nabokov's brilliant novel. From the opening scenes to the end, I feel a sense of satisfaction - it  completely captures the novel's essence. Every line is uttered with feeling  from the talented cast. Jeremy Irons, Dominique Swain, and Melanie Griffith  truly understand the characters. The cinematography, location, acting,  costumes, script, and music all blend so wonderfully together. If you want  to see a great adaptation from book to film, see this one!",946512000,4,578,5.1063829787234045
1244217,5,B00001IVFF,"There is a moment in Adrian Lyne's LOLITA that effectively captures the twisted, yet surprisingly innocent feeling that Vladimir Nabokov wanted to portray with his novel. When Lolita, wonderfully played by newcomer Dominique Swain, is rushing up the stairs to say goodbye to Humbert Humbert  (Jeremy Irons), before she leaves for summer camp, you realize that the  look of excitement in Jeremy Irons face, and the nervous posture he has is  that of an innocent child in love.
Indeed it is true that Humbert is a  child at heart, a fact which becomes clear early in the movie, when we  learn a little bit about Humbert's first encounter with love and its  subsequent painful and unexpected loss.
It seems impossible to not  compare Lyne's version with Stanley Kubrick's version, made over 35 years  ago. I have to admit that I am an avid Kubrick fan, and that I always  thought his version of Nabokov's novel, if not faithfully reproduced, was a  classic. So it was that with apprehension (and some morbid curiosity) I  decided to watch Lyne's version. Boy was I blown away.
It is a terrible  thing that our society as a whole, at this day and age, can't see pass the  taboo that apparently clogs the story. It is sad because Lyne's LOLITA is  an excellent and beautiful film in every respect. From Lyne's carefully  crafted visual style, to the outstanding performance given by both Swain  but especially by Irons (this is his movie), to the heart-breaking music  score by legendary composer Ennio Morricone. Everything is in place  here.
It is clear that Lyne has a profound understanding of the novel, he  successfully directs the story in a way the slowly engulfs you and never  seems to fall into the traps that plagued Kubrick's version. There are a  great many things that you will discover in this movie, not the least of  which is the realization that, deep down inside, there is a place in each  and everyone of us where love seems to have no age. In the end you  understand the reasons behind the story, you will see Humbert's joy  reflected in your eyes and his tears will fall down your face, but perhaps  most shocking of all, you will feel like him.
Please, do yourself a favor  and see this movie on DVD. Trimark has done an excellent job by including a  very insightful commentary track by Adrian Lyne, a wealth of deleted scenes  (some of which I wish were on the film), theatrical trailers, and perhaps  the most wonderful feature of all, a casting session with Jeremy Irons and  Dominique Swain, where you see them rehearse a scene, and later get to see  the final scene. Highly recommended.",945734400,145,2610,4.680616740088106
1244218,5,B00001IVFF,"Lolita is a tragic melodrama, both sad and sensitive. Professor Humbert takes one look at Lolita and is immediately both obsessed and devoted. As a viewer, I was able to both admire him and see his hollow selfishness.  Admirable for the poignancy and dedication of his pursuit and selfish  because he saw her for her sexual precociousness.  Now, I didn't think  the movie was able to establish a clear path between her innocence and her  sexual episodes with Humbert. As a viewer, I was caught off guard by her  first open-mouthed kiss with him. She begins the movie as an innocent child  who leafs through pictures of movie star photos, then Humbert shows up and  she sees the way he looks at her and engages in playful flirtation, and  this leads to manipulation on her part, such as when she asks him to try  and dissuade her mother's plans. I viewed this as the behavior of a playful  and perceptive girl who was intrigued by the new-found power she was able  to exert.  Even agreeing with Humbert's assessment of her as a nymphet, I  was not convinced of her leap as someone who was newly conscious of her  sexual influence to someone who sought to engage in sex with a man in his  forties. I think part of the problem is that the movie was narrated and  seen by Hubert's perspective and we were not shown a very clear view of  Lolita's motivation. However, once their relationship was established I  found it to be thoroughly convincing.  Also, are we to believe that  Humbert honestly felt and guily towards what he had done? After three years  without Lolita, whereupon he had time to examine their relationship, his  only course of action was to go to her home and ask here to leave with him.  An action that would uproot her from the stability of her new home and  satisfy his obsession. It is only after this rejection, that he asks for  her forgiveness. He later goes to Quilty's house, what many feel - in a  state of self-hatred and regret. Given support by his statement, ""You  cheated me out of my redemption."" But I think this is the wrong  conclusion. After three years of reflection, he decided that he still  wanted her, and it is logical to assume that he didn't go to Quilty's house  out of self-hatred, but out of anger and jealousy - that he took her away  from him.  It is only in one of the final frames of the movie where he  expresses the magnitude of what he has done. How he has taken away her  childhood. But this doesn't come until the police have closed in on him and  there is no hope that he will be reunited with her. And as much as I want  to, I don't believe him when he says, 'It was not the poignancy of Lolita's  absence by my side, but the absence of her voice in the children's chorus.'  I believe it to be the converse statement and that his sadness is a result  of Lolita's forever absence by his side.  Finally, I wonder if Lolita was  truly a victim in these events. There are arguments to be made that Lolita  benefited from her relationship with Humbert. Even despite Lolita's own  opinion near the end of the film where she is unwilling to forgive Humbert.  Her opinion, which is shared by the majority of people - that a 40 year old  man's relationship with a 14 year old - doesn't make it correct.  There  are arguments to be made that her sexual precociousness is consistent with  her sexual behavior towards Humbert and that his devotion towards her is  something to be admired. She even continued to have friends and act in a  school play while under Humbert's wing. However, I think back to her  playful exchange with her friend on the front lawn after a tennis match and  the modern dance she invented and I think it is wrong to dismiss her  childhood so easily. Ultimately, she was mistreated despite a devotion  displayed on Humbert's part that would be seen as beautiful if it were  guided towards the right person.",945302400,,3875,4.457142857142857
1244219,5,B00001IVFF,"This DVD is the ideal way to see Adrian Lyne's ""Lolita"".  Any tecnical quality lost in not seeing it in a theater is more than made up for by the collection of supplemantal material.  It includes a nice  informal director's running commentary, a ""casting session""  between the two stars, and an excellent collection of scenes that mostly  had to be left out for reasons of time. My favorites of these are a fantasy  drowning and a scene where a face on a wanted poster transforms into that  of the narrator's character.  The latter was actually at the direction of  the original author.  In the novel, he says something like, ""if you  make a film out of this book, do this...""  It's unusual that a great  novel gets made into two great films.  Stanley Kubrick's 1962  ""Lolita"" was the box office hit it deserved to be, but is often  underrated by critics now. On the other hand, Lyne's version was not the  hit it deserved to be be, but I can picture that it will age well. It's a  great period piece, and well acted by Jeremy Irons, Melanie Griffith, Frank  Langella, and above all by Dominique Swain.  Hers must be one of the best  debut performances on film. I enjoyed Sue Lyon in the Kubrick film, but  with Swain, I felt as if I was watching Nabokov's Lolita.",944352000,16,1264,4.451754385964913
1244220,5,B00001IVFF,"I guess the best movies generally have a lesson for life, which we can use to do good for both ourselves and those we love. Lolita is the story of a man who becomes transfixed on a young lady called 'Lolita'. It is a story  of love and total devotion; had she not have been so young, one would  marvel at the dedication he showed toward her, and the sexual power she  exerted on him. But she was young. The imagery and the plot in this version  are so deep and penetrate the depths of the psyche. Both inspire sorrow for  both stars, and awe. Most importantly, one can see that a love such as  this, while initially with pure motive, (in his mind) ultimately darkens in  its results, and always does untold and immense damage to the one that you  would love in such a way. A lifetime of consequences. Even several  lifetimes. One could extend this to everyday life, where a parents desire  to give a child all he/she desires can lead to a manipulation of the parent  and ultimately to the childs demise. This video is the best I have seen.",943920000,10,1039,4.304123711340206
1244221,5,B00001IVFF,"Nabokov's ""Lolita"" is a masterwork of psychological fiction of such complexity that one marvels that it could be rendered into film, but Adrian Lyne's version is a splendid success.  Jeremy Irons is perfectly  cast as Humbert. His superb portrayals of obsession include: Damage, Dead  Ringers, M. Butterfly, Swann in Love, and Betrayal, so it is not surprising  that he is so convincing as Humbert.  What is astounding is the chemistry  between Irons and Dominique Swain as Lolita.  Swain who had no previous  acting experience simply either cues off Irons or puts her own natural  instincts as a fourteen year old in Director Lyne's hands and delivers not  only a stunning nymphet portrayal, but its destructive effect upon her  life.
In the novel Humbert maintained he, ""...had the utmost respect  for ordinary children with their purity and vulnerability....But how his  heart beat when, among the innocent throng, he espied a demon  child...maidens who, to certain bewitched travelers, twice or many time  older than they, reveal their true nature which is not human, but nymphic  (that is demoniac)"". It is this delusional obsession of his that traps  Lolita.  Ultimately in the depths of his remorse and self-hatred for what  he has done to her,and to cleanse himself of his obsession, he murders the  debauched Quilty,who has ""cheated me of my redemption"".  Viewers  will want to read the novel to experience Nabokov's marvelous art and the  full range of Humbert's ironic intricate character.",943747200,31,1500,5.158333333333333
1244222,5,B00001IVFF,"Nabokov gave us a classic novel.
As deeply as was possible almost 40 years ago, Stanley Kubrick, James Mason, Peter Sellers, Shelley Winters and Sue Lyons, in 1962, brought to the screen at least a taste of the flavor of  this haunting tale of obsession and outcome.
At long last, Adrian Lyne  has broken the final barriers to a true presentation of what lies behind  one of the the forbidden doors of the human psyche. While performances by  Frank Langella and Melanie Griffith were slightly stilted, Jeremy Iron's  portrayl of Humbert was masterful and truly exhibited the emotional  ""roller coaster"" Nabokov intended for this character. No less  impressive and charming was Dominique Swain's Lolita. Her performance  embodies Nabokov's intent to show the effects of such a total obsession as  Humbert's on the transition of a girl to a woman. Swain pulls this off with  total aplomb. The final scenes between Humbert and Quilty far surpass the  1962 efforts of Mason and Sellers.
This is a truly delightful film with  perhaps moralistic lessons for all of us. It should defintiely be on any  film lover's shelf.",941760000,17,1114,4.956756756756757

7914376,5,B00001IVFF,"This 1997 version of ""Lolita"" maintains the integrity of the original book and contains some stellar performances, particularly Jeremy Irons' portrayal of Humbert Humbert. Unlike the 1962 James Mason/Sue Lyon film,, there is very little comic relief here. Instead, this is the tale of a man damned by his own personal demons and desires. Irons is a more appropriate Humbert for the 21st Century; the actor somehow managing to create a tortured but slightly sympathetic character.  Frank Langella--a dark and menacing Quilty--will leave you feeling a bit contaminated. His Quilty is so soulless that, in the end, you may find yourself rooting for Humbert--the most ""anti"" of all anti-heroes.
There are no comedic turns here to lighten the tone of the story, as opposed to the original 1962 film, which was directed by Stanley Kubrick with a screenplay by Nabokov himself. That original version uses a heavy dose of black humor, designed to make this strange tale of obsession more palatable for Kennedy-era film goers. And that the author's obvious winks at the audience hurt not one bit. But Peter Sellers, as an almost silly Quilty, dominates that version, which sometimes seems to take none of the narrative very seriois! y. Sue Lyon is also obviously no twelve year old. Young though she was, she was a bit too sophisticated for Nabokov's child-woman-nymphet.
But if you are a Kubrick fan or in need of a humorous approach to this fractured fairytale, the 1962 version is your best bet. Chances are you will enjoy James Mason's urbane, witty Humbert and Shelley Winters' childishly clingy Charlotte Haze.
For purists, who are interested in a more serious cinematic adaptation of the book, this Adrian Lyne adaptation is really your best bet.
In the end, cinephiles really should watch both versions and appreciate them, not just as good movies, but also as reflections of their respective eras.. 1962 and 1997 never seemed so far apart.",1520035200,3,1939,5.040498442367602
