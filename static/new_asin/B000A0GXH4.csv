2348775,5,B000A0GXH4,"Clint Walker with his broad shoulders did what no one could do resurrected Warner Bros and made me an avid western fan. In 1959 i bought a LP of TV westerns by Geoff Love and on the cover in the centre was a a big picture of a smiling clint surrounded in smaller sizes by other western actors like Horton,Arness,Lorne green,Fuller etc .Thats how popular and big he was. But yet what do we get a measly 3 episodes. I guess Warner bros is carrying on with the fight they had with Clint when he walked out of the show over the remuneration .Legitimate complete season shows have been released for Rifleman,Bonanza,Wanted Dead or Alive,Have gun will travel and even Lassie...But not for Cheyenne

I guess there are a few idiots in warners who may not understand the significance of Cheyenne. Cheyene starring clint is a Legendary status TV show .For heaven sakes and for the sake of the numerous fans give it it's due and also include a nice interview by clint. Give it a nice Box packing

and it is GUARANTEED to be a sellout.

Long live cheyenne and long live Clint Walker.

Just to let warner know how popular Clint is let me tell you that i am from India .Please also release Bronco with a larger number of episodes. Bye the way this a nice reproduction of the Black and white episodes from the fifties.",1128988800,14,1303,4.439330543933054
2348776,2,B000A0GXH4,"I was a great fan of the ""Cheyenne "" series back in the 1950s and when I saw this DVD for sale I was quick to buy it.

Now I wish I hadn't. Sure the quality of transfer in sound and vision is very good and for what you pay it appears good value for money. Looking at other reviews on this site actually made up my mind to buy as all the reviews are good, but none of them mention what I set out below........

The DVD content offers poor value. First there are no Scene Selections, which O.K. you can live without, but what is really a crime is that all three episodes have about 15 minutes chopped out of them.  One of the episodes is supposed to star Ty Hardin as ""Bronco"" but he is nowhere to be seen, even though his name appears in the credits, all his scenes have been cut and there is no mention of him the episodes.  Unless you are a real avid fan of ""Cheyenne"" do not consider buying.

For me the savage cutting of these episodes has destroyed all pleasure of watching them.  Warner Home Video does not deserve any sales of this DVD.  If there are future episodes of ""Cheyenne"" I will not be buying them.",1128729600,26,1113,4.1013824884792625
2348777,5,B000A0GXH4,"I wanted more after watching this cheap offering-three episodes is simply not enough-how about 5 or 6 at the least.  Anyway, this is a classic Western series and deserves to have ALL of its episodes released on DVD.  Hey, if ""Have Gun Will Travel"", ""The Rifleman"", and ""Wanted Dead Or Alive"" can all have numerous box sets (and I love them all) there's no reason to leave ""Cheyenne"" in obscurity.",1128729600,6,396,4.642857142857143
2348778,5,B000A0GXH4,"Three (GREAT) episodes are the appetizer, now how about the full course Warner Bros.? There are a lot of western fans who would love to own each season of this classic series.  Clint Walker was an absolutely perfect western hero: tall, broad shouldered and a man of few words.

Love the episode transfers, wish there could have been some extras (even an onscreen written summary of each episode), but hey,  bare bones is better than nothing.

I hope WB will test the waters further with episodes of ""Bronco,"" ""Sugarfoot"", ""Lawman"", ""Colt .45"" and  ""The Dakotas.""",1127865600,106,562,4.873684210526315
2348779,5,B000A0GXH4,"A great release on DVD. Cheyenne was, and still is for those who watched the series back in the 50s and 60s, one of the best and most popular westerns in television history. Big Clint Walker was perfect as Cheyenne Bodie. The show was Warner Brothers first venture into television and the first of a succesfull series of westerns produced by the studio: Maverick (also released on DVD), Sugarfoot, Bronco, Lawman, Colt .45. For this DVD Warner picked up 3 episodes from different seasons (1st, 2nd and 6th). A good choice. We can watch 2 episodes from 1956 and 1 from 1961 and see that the series kept the quality from the beginning to the end of the 7-season running show. Cheyenne remains a classic of the genre. But now, a big complaint! Warner Bros. is celebrating 50 years in television productions, yet the only DVDs released to preserve the memory of Warner's first years on TV were a mere sample of 3 episodes each of Cheyenne and Maverick. This is an extremely poor commemoration of an important event for Warner Brothers. DVDs featuring complete seasons of both Cheyenne and Maverick should be the real and right celebration and an opportunity for the studio to restore the good shows of past years to the new audience. Hey, Clint is still around and some commentary by him on the series would be an excellent extra for the DVD.
The ""Disappointed Fan"" review by R. Waddingham was not fair to Warner Bros., neither to the Cheyenne DVD. Mr. Waddingham stated that all three episodes on the DVD have about 15 minutes chopped out. This is not correct. The first episode, The Storm Riders, has a running time of 43 minutes, which is the correct time for all (or most) Cheyenne episodes of the 1st. season, when Warner used some 10 minutes after the show for a ""behind-the-scenes"", promoting the studio movies. The other two episodes are 49 and 50 minutes each. This is the original running time. Nothing was cut. And Ty Hardin was not supposed to star in The Young Fugitives episode. For the 1961-62 season Cheyenne and Bronco alternated as part of The Cheyenne Show, so the ""starring Ty Hardin as Bronco"" in the logo didn't mean at all that Hardin was in the Cheyenne episode.
However, the loud question remains unanswered: Why not full seasons for Cheyenne, one the best classic westerns in television history?",1127779200,21,2317,4.70935960591133
2348780,5,B000A0GXH4,"I am thrilled to have even just this 3 episode DVD, but of course now I am going to want more!

The transfer looks great and one of my favorite episodes, THE TRAP (with guest stars Sally Fraser and Rhodes Reason), is included.

Now, how about releasing the whole kit and ka boodle! Clint Waler is still around and I would bet he would love to do commentary on a couple of episodes!",1127779200,10,381,4.205479452054795
2348781,4,B000A0GXH4,"OK, it's just a 3-episode ""sampler,"" but at least we have a few episodes of ""Cheyenne"" to enjoy on DVD and it does provide an evening's worth of solid Western entertainment.  ""Cheyenne"" has historical value as it was one of Warner Brothers' very first forays into television production and it was also one of the earliest of the so-called ""adult Westerns"" that began airing on network television in the mid-1950s.  One can only hope that this DVD (and the 3-episode ""Maverick"" DVD) sell well enough that more episodes might be made available.  Clint Walker, ""The Big Guy Himself,"" is excellent in this series and some episode commentaries and/or interviews with Mr. Walker would be welcome and important additions for any future DVD releases of ""Cheyenne.""  In this regard, Warner Home Video should have borrowed a page from its subsidiary Rhino Home Video, which released ""The Life and Legend of Wyatt Earp"" on the same day as this and included interview material with the star of that series, Hugh O'Brian, along with a more substantial 26 episodes on four DVDs.  As it is, there are no extras on this release, though the episodes look excellent for a series that began its first broadcasts in 1955, a major reason for obtaining this disc.

This release of ""Cheyenne"" (and ""Maverick"") is like the proverbial potato chip; once you have one, you want more.  How about it, Warner Home Video???",1127779200,77,1392,4.872881355932203

I watched this the following evening after I had watched ""Maverick"" the evening before. Maverick was most enjoyable, and was looking forward to another entertaining evening with ""Cheyenne"".
The acting was terrible. Nothing wrong with Clint Walker, but I felt some of the key supporting actors efforts were a distraction to the extent that I could not tolerate more than 25% into the second episode.",1210118400,,502,4.91764705882353

It was nice to see at least one season again but these were disappointing in a number of ways and it may very well not be the fault of the current copyright owner. And that is they are all around 40 minutes in length and the theme was different than I had ever heard before, not that shows were beyond changing their theme. The old reliable theme which I was most familiar with was not there and at the very least there should have been some sort of explanation. There wasn't even an explanation that this show alternated with others and therefore was NOT on each week for some 6-8 months of the year for every week. Now, let's see the next few seasons along with the best of them all Maverick which warner has to know is a real gold-mine.

2348832,5,B000A0GXH4,"Clint Walker as the impossibly handsome, honest cowpoke, who tries to avoid trouble, but will fight for common decency, honesty, and values is the epitome of the western hero. Great episodes of an EVERYMAN that we need for this day and age. Themes of Good versus EVIL, weave through every episode. It's a simple formula, but brings back memories of simpler times in 1950's America. This three show DVD brings back the  adult westerns. Not just shoot-em-ups, but with drama as a major component.

ABC. So I don't remember much about the show. Other than my parents loved it, and were crazy about Clint Walker. They also liked the other shows in the rotating series. Bronco and Sugarfoot.

 I got this disc because I became a fan of Walker, from seeing

some of the movies he made after his show ended. Even some of his made for tv movies from the 70's were pretty decent!

 But my complaints about the release of this disc is, that it was so limited. Only three episodes. Why not six, or a complete season.

 The only other episodes of Cheyenne that I know to exsist, are

on vhs. One is titled ""Iron Horse"". The other is ""the White Warior.(featuring a very young Michael Landon.)
