Little did they know but they would be teaching the daughters of some of the world's most famous monsters (Dracula, Mummy, Wereworlf, Ghost, etc.) The girl ghouls are kidnapped by the evil Revolta and the boys spring into action to rescue the girls Scooby style!

I grew up watching this movie and it is perfect for a Scooby fan. However I am not the most appealed to the movies with the entire gang and we watch those one more than this but it doesn't mean this is a bad movie. There are special features included in this DVD which include the back to school game, how to draw Scooby, how to draw Scooby and Shaggy, 2 music videos, trailers of various Scooby and other family favorites.

Overall it is a great movie to add to your collection but just be prepared you might have some questions from your little Scooby fan about where the rest of the gang is (and maybe who Scrappy is as he isn't in a WHOLE lot of shows).",1420502400,,1031,4.392670157068062

Its a boarding school and scooby and the gang get a job their as gym teachers but when scooby and the gang meet the girls at the school they are more gouls than girls! Seeing a young vampire, mummy, frankenstein girls arrive get introduced into the story to welcome scooby and the gang each in their unique creepy and misunderstood way, is very entertaining and will leave children on the edge of their seats.

1391113,3,B000053VEG,"The 80's was a weird time for Scooby. This movie, preceded by ""Boo Brothers"" and followed by ""Reluctant Werewolf"", follows the formula of the early Scrappy episodes with just Shaggy, Scooby and Scrappy, and the monsters/ghosts are real. Though Shaggy is sporting his outfit from The 13 Ghosts of Scooby-Doo. This movie isn't as good as it's predecessor or it's successor. It is better than the early Scrappy episodes that ran for three seasons where instead of half hour mysteries it was just 7 minute comedic shorts (3 per half hour). Most of the monsters daughters got on my nerves, except for the little mummy girl. I hated all the boys from the opposing school next door. The script is full of so many bad puns (i.e. Fangtastic, bat-tub, ""my mummy taught me how to swim a Nile"" just to name a few), I'm pretty sure Draculas daughter didn't have a line without a pun in it (every other sentence she says ""fang-tastic""). I can't give anything Scooby below three stars, because it's sacred to my childhood, and it's still worth seeing and owning for any die-hard Scooby fan or completist. You just won't go back to re-watch it much, only when the classic formula starts to wear thin will you feel the need to see this again.",1409875200,,1225,4.623853211009174

1391188,1,B000053VEG,"I picked this up for $5 at Wal-mart, expecting another fun full-length Scooby feature in the vein of ""Camp Scare"" or ""Witch's Ghost."" Wrong.

There are so many things that make this film painful to watch. First of all, it doesn't even make sense. Scooby, Shaggy and Scrappy are headed to teach P.E. (huh?) to an all-girls school (huh?) where the students are also the daughters of the world's scariest monsters (huh?) who are REAL monsters, not men in masks (huh?) as they're gearing up for a volleyball tournament with boys from a local military school (huh?) outside their creepy mansion.

Secondly...there's no Mystery, Inc., no Mystery van and...NO MYSTERY. Shaggy and Scooby are great characters, but the movie feels empty and foreign without the rest of the gang.

Thirdly...THE CHARACTERS!! Okay some people think Scrappy is bad, but he's actually a likeable character compared to the rest. Revolta is simply fugly, and a weak villain at that. The monsters are ridiculous. And the girls...they might just be the most annoying cartoon characters I've seen in a long time. The phantom daughter is screechy and squealy, the werewolf's daughter sounds constipated and howls constantly, Frankenstein's daughter sounds like they were trying to make fun of mentally handicapped people and walks around calling her dad ""dada"" even though she looks at least a teenager. The only one that was semi-cute was the mummy's daughter, but her voice was still a bit irritating. Miss Grimwood was the only one with a pleasant voice, and I thought the little dragon/dog was pretty cute.

Possibly the WORST thing about this movie was the dialogue. There's literally a really REALLY bad pun every 30 seconds. They start out as a bit eye-rolling, but it gets cringe-worthy and, about 30 minutes into it, downright torturous. There's one in about every other line, and some of them are recycled multiple times throughout the film. (Just count how many times Dracula's daughter says ""Fang-tastic"" for starters)

Finally...there's no real plot. It's incredibly boring and at 1 hr. 33 minutes it lasts longer than some non-children's movies, which makes it even more drawn out and lame.

Seriously, avoid this at all costs. It doesn't feel like a Scooby Doo movie...at best, it feels like a really bad spinoff. Like if Luna and Neville from Harry Potter moved to America and started bakery in New York City. That's about how this film fits in with traditional Scooby repertoire. Don't waste your time and, especially, your money!!",1351900800,2,2512,5.0264423076923075
1391189,5,B000053VEG,I first seen this movie as a child and I loved it. When I found it on amazon I absolutely had to buy it from my children they love the movie and it was a good flash back to watch the movie again,1351728000,,194,3.5348837209302326

1391233,5,B000053VEG,"Awesome old cartoon classics. I totally loved it. Besides Scrappy which I always dislike, the cartoon is great. It's even better than some of the new ones. A must have for collection.",1327276800,,183,4.75
1391234,2,B000053VEG,"So the basic overview of this Scooby movie is this:  Scooby, Shaggy, and Scrappy are all hired on to a finishing school for girls (ghouls such as werewolves, mummies, vampires, and frankensteins in this case) to be a volley ball coach.  They finally get over the fear of their strange company and become at home.  However, an evil witch named Revolta is trying to take control of the girls and their powers.  That is basically it.  Bland right?

First of all, I don't care for Scooby and Shaggy being stand-alone characters.  They are great characters, but they need the support of Mystery Inc.  There is nothing wrong with that, there are just some characters that are supposed to be part of a whole group or they don't work.  The attempt to pad this with having Scrappy Doo come along is disappointing.  It doesn't feel complete.

As one reviewer pointed out, there are many plot holes.  There is no mystery, so the story line seems to be distracting in itself.  Nothing really matches up.  Shaggy has never been athletic so why is he all of a sudden a coach?

The very fabric of Scooby Doo is ripped apart by this movie.  Until now, I believe all the villians have simply been bad guys in masks.  Yes, real monsters have worked as in Zombie Island or the live action movie, but here its so out of sorts.  It doesn't even feel like Scooby Doo, but rather a bad spin-off.  What if a movie was made about Alfred from Batman selling time shares in Australia?  Doesn't make sense right?  Really out of place?  Thats the feeling that Ghoul School sends.

Oh my God if you want bad puns this is the place for you!  Every single line (no exaggeration) has one!  The writers must have really thought they were on their game when they did this.  It makes the movie unwatchable for the older crowd.

My first impression was this Scooby Doo is aimed at a WAY young audience but I'll be honest, its a little bit creepy for younger kids.  Even the heroes are disturbing.  I think young children will have a problem handling Revolta and Creeper.  While most Scoobys are lighthearted, this one deals with a real diabolical subject.  I would avoid getting this to entertain the little ones.  And that puts this movie in a bad place; too immature for older audiences too dark for younger children.  So who is left to watch this?  No one.

Honestly, I have to say avoid picking up this (and Arabian Nights).  Its going to be a disappointment.  If you are a collector of Scooby Doo movies like myself, then maybe its worth it.  But I wouldn't get it for its entertainment value.",1307404800,,2561,4.498910675381263

- The monsters, though friendly, are real
- The plot makes NO sense at all... something about Shaggy being a gym teacher for an all girls monster school and they are playing volleyball against some jerks from a military school.  And then there is some witch trying to capture the kids
- The voices of the Ghoul Girls are irritating beyond belief... specifically the little girl ghost that has the screeching laugh.
- The mystery machine isn't even here

1391317,1,B000053VEG,"Eesh! What is this supposed to be? Shaggy and Scooby's solo outings usually make for good movies. But Ghoul School comes nowhere near the surprisingly good Boo Brothers or Reluctant Werewolf and is so far behind modern Scooby Doo animation. It really is the cheapest, shoddiest Scooby effort I've ever seen.
There isn't even a mystery, thus explaining the lack of the Mystery Machine (an ugly red van is the replacement). So why on earth they bothered to make this a Scooby Doo movie is puzzling if they weren't deliberately exploiting a popular character.
It's just all wrong! Shaggy gets a job in an all-girl (actually Ghoul) school teaching Phys. Ed. I'm sorry but when did Shaggy become a qualified Gym Teacher? There's some pointless story involving a volleyball competition with a Military School next door that isn't good enough to distract from the bore and then after that some old hag called Revolta turns up and turns them all into zombies. Uh...yeah.
Shaggy obviously saves the day but by this point I had dozed off. It bored me to sleep!
The 1.33:1 full frame picture shows how cruddy the animation is and the sound is plain old mono. Aside from the usual 'how to draw' extras this DVD also features a trailer that cheekily uses lots of footage of modern Scooby animation and mixes it with Ghoul School to make it look new. I wasn't fooled.
Don't buy this. Rent it for the kids if there is really nothing else.",1086393600,13,1423,4.673306772908367

The 3 heros were very knid to help the girls get ready for the big volleyball game and I,m happy to say that the training and excercising made them win against the military school next door. However i,m kind of sad that the rest of the gang is not in this film,but it is still a great film to enjoy.",1085011200,2,398,3.9875

Original Mysteries and Creepiest Capers are by far the best. They contain the actual cartoon shows.  Ghoul School, Reluctant Werewolf, and Goes Hollywood are movie cartoons.  Scooby Doo Goes Hollywood is the only one I don't really care for because they're not running from monsters or ghosts.  Overall, it's a pretty good 5 pack of Scooby Doo Dvd's that would be great for any Scooby fan collecting the Dvd's.",1068768000,6,605,4.96039603960396
1391347,4,B000053VEG,"It is a very rare movie that does have the rest of the Scooby Doo gang (Fred, Daphne & Velma). This movie just has Shaggy, Scooby and Scrappy Doo. If you have seen the series or any of most of the movies , it is always Fred, Daphne, and Velma that makes Shaggy and Scooby to do stuff, they don't want to do. I wish more epoides and movies like this. And if the gang has to be around, then I wish that Shaggy and Scooby boss around the others, and making them do things they don't want to do. As the movie opens, Shaggy (Casey Kasem), and Scooby-Doo and Scrappy Doo (both voiced by the late Don Messick), are on the road like for Ms. Grimwood's finshing school for girls, but they run find Calloy Miletary School, and the school they want is next doors, which turns to be Ms. Grimwood's school for ghouls.

The one flaw that this DVD has is SCRAPPY DOO!! I HATE Scrappy Doo. He gets on my nerves. This movie could have been so MUCH better without Scrappy Doo.
Now, that I have gotton out my hate for Scrappy I will talk about the DVD it's self. It is a SUPER movie. It has a great plot with great characters, minus Scrappy Doo. Oops, sorry I mentioned my hate again over Scrappy Doo. Oh, well. This film is very entertaining. One of my favorite characters in it is Dracula's daughter. Dracula has a daughter? He sure does.

1391350,5,B000053VEG,my 3 yr old son really loves this movie. we are on our 3rd copy,1032134400,,63,3.2666666666666666
1391351,3,B000053VEG,"Having seen the original series as a little girl, I was always concerned that Shaggy was too frequently picked on by other members of the group. He may have been more cautious, but the character seemed so much more nicer than any of the other ""meddling kids"".
Thus, despite the inclusion of Scrappy (the reason for the taking away two stars) I actually found a lot to like about the movie.
Apparently fusing the ""Adams Family"" (the ghoulish stuff) with the ""Facts of Life"" (the movie is also a comedy about an exclusive girls boarding school)this addition to the Scooby cannon is very creative. There are some slow moments in the screenplay, but they do not detract from the overall plot (which has some lessons about women's educational equality hidden throughout the film).
Shaggy, Scooby (and unfortunatley, Scrappy) head to a ""ghouls finnishing school"" where Shaggy will be working as a coach and instructor for the children of Hollywood's most famous and infamous classic monsters. Even though it is never revealed what educational training and professional background Shaggy has, it is clear throughout the film that he is serious about doing a good job in his new role and does not consider teaching at an all-girls (he intially believes the instituion is for humans)is any less important or serious.
Befitting his afforementioned non-critical nature, Shaggy is truly the most tolerant human in the scooby gang--neither the gender or monster status of his students (or their parents) matters as much as the fact they are happy and safe. Here we see the best side of a historically underutilized character, who clearly demonstrates leadership skills in his own right (when it would have been easier to pack up and leave the school at the first inkling of trouble).
Yes, the plot is light compared to other products in the scooby empire (even if the villan in this installation is actually supernatural) but this video is supposes to be more about tolerance than the supernatural underworld.
For delivering such a message on a level all audience can understand without being condescending, the video deserves it's three stars.",1019260800,8,2131,5.022598870056497
1391352,1,B000053VEG,"I watched Scooby as a kid and fortunately missed this one. I rented it for my kids and watched it with them. It was painful to watch. First, there is virtually no suspense AT ALL. And there is no mystery. There is also no Mystery Gang, which really makes this feel like something is wrong. The animation and sound effects reminded me eerily of The Smurfs, which is not a compliment.
That said, my 3-year-old DID seem to enjoy it - but only through one viewing. They have not asked for it since, but still ask for other Scooby movies (especially Cyber Chase). Good thing I rented it first, but even that seemed to be a waste of money.",1018051200,2,633,4.3277310924369745
