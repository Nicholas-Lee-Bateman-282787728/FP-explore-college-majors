8739546,5,B017JPW5BU,I have binge watched Taggart Complete Collection and it is great.  The stories are great and the cast wonderful.  It is really hard to figure out who is the killer.  The toughest thing about the shows is getting used to the Scots accent.  I love how the cast pronounces police and murder.,1519862400,,288,4.480769230769231

8739548,3,B017JPW5BU,"Have seen McManus episodes  and format was tv-formt, however the DVD description specifies widescreen - can someone tell us what the aspect ratio is for each series season/year? Thank you.

The McManus episodes are complex, and you have to spend attention as the ending is not always predictable.",1471996800,2,296,5.145833333333333
