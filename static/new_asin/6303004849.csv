539613,5,6303004849,"my boys and i love watching these old cliffhangers and we have a great time doing it. this one is full of great stunts and has a good(if a little cheesey)story. the transfer is good but not great,so if great transfers are what you look for then you may not want to get this.

  the other thing is if you love the comicbook then be ready for this,this is not the captain america from the comic.his name is different and he isn't a product of a super soldier serum like the comic. otherwise this is great fun!!",1148601600,3,508,4.216494845360825
539614,3,6303004849,"Captain America was one of the most popular comics during WWII as he battled his arch-foe the Red Skull and other stereotypical Nazi villians.  He got his powers by drinking a super soldier formula.

Unfortunately this Republic serial bares little resemblance to the comics.  Captain America is no longer Steve Rogers, the goldbrick soldier...he is Grant Gardner, a Discrict Attorney.  He's no longer battling Nazi villians bent on world domination, but common, every day crooks....What's more is that Caps Shield is gone and in it's place is a pistol!!!

Dick Purcell does a decent job as Grant Gardner / Captain America, although he wasn't the best physical match for the part. In fact, he really looks quite flabby in the form-fitting tights.  Lorna Grey makes a surprisingly sexy sidekick as they battle a villian called the Scarab, who's name is much more sinister as the villian himself.

While the action sequences are pretty good, and there are fights aplenty, it's obvious that a more trim stuntman was filling in for Purcell.  The fights all become pretty repetitive after a few episodes.

The one saving grace to the Serial is the presence of Horror Heavy Lionel Atwill playing yet another mad doctor role, this time as museum curator Doctor Maldor.

As serial go...you could do much worse than Captain America but you could do much better as well.",1101168000,25,1359,4.947136563876652

Cap is quite the brawler in this serial. One other thing: one of the episode title cards comes up as ""Return of Captain America"".

539839,1,6303004849,"The only thing you're paying for is the DVD case and the artwork. This is the same copy you, and I suspect the person making this, can download for free at the Internet Archive website. It's a free and legal download as this is in the public domain.

Another issue with this burned disc is that the audio start to go out of sync at times, in the last few chapters. It gets to be around a second late, so while it is annoying, it's not so off that you won't be able to follow the action.

As others have mentioned, the chapter stops aren't set to go at the beginning of the next episode. They're just thrown in at random intervals.

Amazon should be more clear when they're selling a DVD-R and a DVD.

The story itself isn't bad unless you're coming in specifically because you want to see Captain America. The only relation to the Captain America in this serial compared to the one from the comics is in name only. If you can get past that and enjoy watching other Republic series, you'll probably enjoy this.

If you're on the fence, I'd watch it online first and if you don't know how to make a DVD out of the files, and don't know anyone else that can help, then it's worth a purchase. I strongly suggest making your own copy as if someone is going to sell something they got for free, they should really put in some effort into the technical aspects, such as the tiny amount of effort it would have taken to get chapter stops correct.",1386460800,16,1438,4.272058823529412

  This is a collection of the action serial from the 1940's, all fifteen episodes are included as well as some fun trailers for other series from the 40's and 50's.
  New fans of the Cap will be disappointed the the distinct lack of ""shield action"" in this film. Although the original Cap used both pistol and shield, whether for lack of writing or cost, this series has Cap going into action without it. According to this serials Wiki page the script was originally not about Captain America, and was quickly rewritten after the studio acquired the rights to make a comic book adaption. Viewers will notice how the alter ego is no longer Steve Rogers, and not even a soldier. Whatever the changes may be, I still enjoy this series and If you are a completest you must have this film.
  The copy I purchased was lacking in the menu department, as there were no real screens just a generic Cap picture at the title screen and written words for the viewing options. There were no special features, even though previous copies made by others have featured several behind the scenes looks into the making of the film and fun facts about the character of Captain America. I was able to find these features online and was planning on making my own copy, however needing to have A professional cover on all the dvds in my collection drove me to purchasing a copy from someone who could produce said end products.
  If I had the means to put a professional cover on the dvd I would not have purchased this exact copy but if you like me just need that professional look I suggest picking up a copy from this seller.",1355616000,,1877,4.4678362573099415
539844,3,6303004849,"Great serial plenty of action and cliffhanger suspence, although it's all on one disc and picture isn't too sharp a bit on the grainy side.",1329264000,2,139,4.6
539845,2,6303004849,"Movies always make a few changes when adapting characters from comics to screen. They are different media, after all. But the Captain America sequel tops them all in that it changes EVERYTHING about the character. Secret identity? Different--he is now crusading D.A. Grant Gardner fighting crooks. Super-soldier serum? Gone. He's just a regular guy. Military adventures fighting Nazis and saboteurs? Nope, it's a revenge plot with the members of an archaeological expedition dying off one by one. Even his costume has been modified, although it does bear a little similarity to the comics costume.

That being said, The serial is actually pretty good if you pretend it's not actually, you know, Captain America. This was supposedly the most expensive serial Republic ever made, and the sets are huge, often with two levels so Captain America can start every fight by jumping down on someone. Lionel Atwill makes a good villain, as well.

Where this product really falls down is in the DVD itself. This is a very cheaply made product. The cover take the gorgeous old poster (which contains the title) and pastes a blue box over it with the title in a plain font. The back cover contains no information about the product, except that it was released in ""2009."" All fifteen chapters are on one disc, so the compression is really bad, and the menus are as bare bones as you can get. The serial is good, as serials go, but this disc doesn't do it justice.",1327708800,4,1450,4.819277108433735
539846,1,6303004849,"First of all, this dvd is not what I expected, but let me make it clear that I am referring to the presentation of the dvd NOT the serial itself; for the serial is great! I am very disappointed with the presentation of this dvd and if I had known it was going to look the way it does then I would not have wasted $15 on this. It does not look legit in simple terms. In fact, like another person has commented it is a burned copy and for that reason, $15 is way too much for this dvd.

But my main complaint is this, I was led to believe that this dvd was BRAND NEW and sure it was packaged as such BUT when I opened it and checked the dvd there were finger prints, scratches and scuff marks all over the disc. This IS NOT BRAND NEW condition! It is for this reason as well, that I warn any future buyers of this product to be cautious because there is a high chance you may be disappointed with what you recieve for the price you pay.

Amazon, if you monitor these reviews then do the right thing and stop selling this dvd. It is not legit and you have another unsatisfied customer and potentially many more.",1318723200,8,1108,4.054794520547945

539889,5,6303004849,"Republic's 15-chapter serial ""Captain America"" was released in 1944, directed by John English and Elmer Clifton, and is loosely based on the comic book character created in 1941 by Joe Simon and drawn by Jack Kirby.  One's tolerance of the ""improvements"" made by Republic depend largely on whether it is approached as a serial, or a representation of the original character.

The plot changes Captain America's other identity from a soldier to District Attorney Grant Gardner (Dick Purcell), investigating a series of murders, hyped in the newspapers as ""The Purple Death"" owing to traces of a chemical found in the victims' blood.  Dr. Maldor (Lionel Atwill) is secretly ""The Scarab"" who has been using a deadly and mind-controlling substance extracted from a rare orchid, forcing his victims to withdraw large amounts of money in cash from their bank accounts before they kill themselves.  He is systematically killing the other members of his Central American Mayan expedition, claiming that they managed to gain fame and wealth, while he ended up only the curator of a small museum.  But, as he explains to his latest victim, Professor Lyman (Frank Reicher) he has interests other than money; rare jewels, paintings, and from Lyman, ""The Scarab wants the plans to your Thermo-Dynamic Vibration Engine"" since the device could be used as a powerful weapon.  Unfortunately for the Scarab's underlings, while trying to get the plans from the late Professor's safe they run into Captain America, and leave behind a package of flasks, glass ""Purple Death bombs"" that contain the deadly chemical.  The District Attorney and his secretary, Gail Richards (Lorna Gray) soon track down the florists responsible for growing and processing the orchids (LeRoy Mason and Stanley Price).  But The Scarab has just started on his treacherous schemes.

Some criticism has been made of the lack of Nazis in the plot, but while the war wasn't over, it wasn't directly included in the plot of ANY of the serials released in 1944.  Even Universal limited the Nazis to occasional mention in ""The Great Alaskan Mystery.""  The producers apparently didn't want to risk representing a war that was over, or significantly changed by the time the films got released.  Captain America's peace-time job may seem slightly at odds with his origins.  It is likely, as suggested elsewhere, that Republic already had a serial scheduled and cast for a different character, and when the rights to Captain America became available a quick adaptation was done instead of a carefully-planned new serial.  1944 was also the year that Republic made ""Zorro's Black Whip"" where ""Zorro"" isn't mentioned in the dialogue, also owing to issues with film rights to the character.

So why would the District Attorney need an alter ego, Captain America or otherwise?  Why did Steve Rogers need one in the original version?  Doubtless the usual excuse, that he wants to be able to do things that bend the law without getting caught, and the disguise is supposed to induce fear in his adversaries.  But mostly Republic wanted to feature a comic book character.  The costume looks like it was done quickly and cheaply, not quite up to Republic's usual standards.  It has a lot of wrinkles showing, and when in that costume Dick Purcell displays a slight stomach overhang.  While not really fat, he has more of a ""District Attorney"" body build, but if he doesn't look as heroic in tights as did Tom Tyler, the dialogue is delivered well.  He, and stunt double Dale Van Sickel make the action fairly convincing, but regardless of identity, he wears clumsy-looking ""District Attorney"" shoes.  Can he pull them through the legs of his trousers when changing into Captain America?  At least they help him land on his feet when he falls into a mine shaft.  The rest of the cast is about as good as it gets in a serial.  Lorna Gray, as Gardner's secretary Gail Richards not only looks good, she gets directly invovled in the action, even shooting a couple bad guys.  Lionel Atwill hams it up more than a little, but his cool, unflappable character oozes evil, and is...is....a lot of fun anyhow, so we don't need any ""comic"" relief.  His main henchmen are Gruber (John Davidson), the scientific brains of the organization, and Bart Matson (George J. Lewis) who does most of the dirty work.  They are aided by several well-known assistant bad-guy actors, including brief appearances by Kenne Duncan, Crane Whitley, Tom London and John Bagni.  On the side of Law and Order are Charles Trowbridge as Commissioner Dryden, Russell Hicks as Mayor Randolph, Hugh Sothern as Professor Dodge, Tom Chatterton as J. C. Henley and John Hamilton as Hillman, these last three members of the Mayan expedition.  Robert Frazer appears in one of his last roles as Doctor Clinton Lyman, brother of the late Professor from Chapter One.  The musical score, by Mort Glickman is of the usual ""pulse-pounding"" variety at close to its 1940's best, if with a flubbed note or two from the trumpets that wouldn't have been heard in better days, including one in a frequently repeated excerpt.  While action director William Witney wasn't available for this serial, his old partner John English, with Elmer Clifton do quite well with the many fights.  The special effects range from quite good to fairly disgraceful, but there is a minimum amount of stock footage, and no dreaded ""retrospective"" chapter.

There are currently two DVD editions listed by Amazon.  The one from PR Studios is cheaper, supplied on a single DVD-R disc.  The print used has several minor defects that match the one used for the old Video Treasures (Anchor Bay) VHS edition; PR's copy has better image quality but otherwise less integrity.  The opening titles for the first eleven chapters are all from Chapter One, the only chapter in the original to have the ""mug shots"" of the main cast members.  The top of the frame is cropped in the titles, slightly clipping the top of John Davidson's head.  The end credits are all missing except on the last chapter.  The image isn't bad, most of it not cropped as badly as the titles and fairly sharp, but the contrast is a bit high.  Faces don't go blank, but sometimes lack normal tonal range.  A few places have dirt and small scratches but the print was mostly clean, though there are a few minor ""digital compression"" artifacts especially in the opening titles, likely due to fitting the serial on a single disc.  The sound is a worse problem, some distortion, sibilants tend to be ""explosive"" and there is a ""gurgle"" in the background, probably caused by a noise-reduction process similar to that used by others to get ""hiss-free"" sound.  Even the substandard sound of the Video Treasures VHS edition is better.  And the sound runs about half a second late, out of sync with the picture in the last three chapters.  The disc layout is not good; ""chapters"" are present, but not numbered the same as those of the serial, and go to a point after the chapter start.  There is no index for the last chapter of the serial.  And for no apparent reason two movie trailers have been included; for the 1956 feature ""The Lone Ranger"" with Clayton Moore, the copy having jerky action and also bad color, and for the 1959 Hammer Films version of ""Hound of the Baskervilles"" with Peter Cushing as Sherlock Holmes.  The packaging has no information about the contents except for the image of a Chapter One lobby card on the outside of the case, and also on a paper insert inside, the reverse of which is blank.

Reelclassicdvd's edition, on two DVD-R discs, is from the 1953 reissue titled ""Return of Captain America"" and is much better than the one from PR Studios.  All credits are present, and have the correct MPPDA numbers and copyright dates -- the first few chapters from 1943, the rest 1944.  Made directly from a film print, without any analog intermediary steps, the result depends to a large extent on the quality of that print.  Here, things are a little hit-and-miss, but the image is properly framed, even slightly ""matted"" and quite sharp.  There is a small amount of dirt, some apparently from the negative, and a few very minor scratches, but it is not as ""grainy"" as the print used for the PR release.  The gray scale is more of a problem; while usually quite good, some of Chapter One is fairly murky, and occasionally there are sudden changes in brightness, sometimes within a scene.  After watching four chapters I finally noticed a ""logo"" in the lower-right corner of the screen for a couple seconds; just the letters ""RCDVD"" and fairly small, so not a major issue.  The sound is also variable in the amount of noise, both ""hiss"" and a little sprocket-related buzz, usually low level but occasionally more than just noticeable.  It is still far preferable to the garbled, processed ""noise reduced"" sound heard in the PR edition.  The packaging is ""generic"" for Reelclassicdvd's releases, with just the title on the spine.

This is a good serial, for those not concerned by the changes made to the title character, though as usual with serials, leaving a day or more between chapters is best.  While neither DVD edition is ideal, it is great to find one as good as Reelclassicdvd's release.  While more expensive than the PR Studios edition, and still on ""burned"" DVD-R discs, it is easily worth the extra cost.",1311292800,9,9354,4.855072463768116

It has great production values,great special effects and fantastic fight scenes. The villian played by Lionell Atwill is great and Lorna Gray as the heroine is beautiful. Dick Purcell as the hero is however only serviceable. The biggest problem with this movie however is the fact that the hero really isn't Captain America. His secret identity is no longer that of U.S.Army soldier Steve Rogers. Here he's crusading DA Grant Gardner. There's no shield,no kid sidekick Bucky and his costume is missing more than a few of it's accessories. And even though it was made during WW2 the good Captain isn't taking on the Axis powers here. This has to be one of the worst adaptations of a comic book to the screen,ever. Once again it's a good serial,but Republic would have been better served calling the hero the Americommando or something similair.

539896,5,6303004849,"Captain America--the Star Spangled Avenger--minus the shield, his youthful sidekick, Bucky Barnes, and the Red Skull. The late Dick Purcell plays the crusading district attorney Grant Gardner in one of Republic's finest cliffhangers; who, attempts to uncover and stop the evil/cunning Scarab's ""Purple Death"" plot. Sadly, Purcell passed away before this serial's release. Lionel Atwill is great as the sinister Museum Curator, Dr. Cyrus Maldor. Maldor has been killing off members of his South American expedition to gain control of their wealth and stewardship of the museum. Lorna Gray is superb as Gardner's faithful assistant and the damsel in constant distress. The omnipresent George J. Lewis carries out the Scarab's evil plans as badguy, Bart Matson.

Cap must even combat Professor Dodge's (Hugh Southern) ""Dynamic Vibrator""-- ouch! Can Cap thwart the evil doctor's plans? Will Maldor manage to gain complete control of the scientific museum for his evil plans? Cap fights for truth, justice and the American Way!!!",1265932800,3,1024,5.481012658227848
539937,4,6303004849,"This serial has nothing to do with the original comic book Captain America but is still entertaining. Some people considered the star, Dick Purcell, to be pudgy but this is simply not so. He just had a more realistic body type than a male growth hormone guzzling freak like Sylvester Stallone. The men of Dick Purcell's era had survived the Great Depression and when they were hungry they ate meat and potatoes. Go take a look at your own gut sometime! Overall, Purcell made a pretty good serial hero, tough enough to do the job convincingly, a reasonably good actor, not wearing his angst and self doubt on his shirt sleeve like some modern sissy boy hero. While not as great as Buster Crabbe or Tom Tyler, he was better than Kirk Alyn (sorry, Kirk).

This serial has lots of excellent fight scenes and great cliff hangers. Also, there is a sequence where Captain America rides the Republic motorcycle, which was also seen in 'Spy Smasher.' The villain, Lionel Atwill, is probably one of the best serial villains, perhaps even better than Charles Middleton as Emperor Ming.

Perhaps it would have been wiser to do this in the usual 12 chapters, as opposed to 15, but then again, if I minded wasting my time, why would I watch these old serials? Overall, this is a pretty good serial, and as such it has a higher value for escapist fun than most modern super-heroic cinema.

One significant criticism I will make, however, is the inexplicable exclusion of all references to WWII. When it's WWII out there, and you have Captain America, a character created to fight WWII, yet the story has nothing to do with WWII, well, that is an awfully big elephant in the room. It would be akin, say, to a nation that spends $200 million a day for 9 years on a war, with the public having no reliable knowledge of the causes, progress, or effects of the war.",1260230400,7,1845,4.56797583081571

539942,1,6303004849,"Captain America is a fine serial, if you don't mind that it is not faithful to the comic books.  Lionel Atwill as the villain is good, the direction is good, and Lorna Grey as the D.A.'s assistant is great.  In this day and age of high quality DVDs, though, I was expecting a much better presentation.  First of all, you can't select the chapters from the menu!  There's just no excuse for that.  The menu contains 3 items: a Lone Ranger trailer, a Hound of the Baskervilles trailer, and Captain America.  Click on ""Captain America"" and it begins playing 4 hours of 15 chapters all strung together!  If you don't watch all 4 hours all in one sitting, good luck finding your place again.  Or say there's a chapter you really like and you want to pull out this DVD and watch it.  Forget it; you'll spend all day trying to find where it starts.  My biggest complaint, though, is that the picture quality is poor and the sound gets fuzzy.  Watching this DVD feels like watching a VHS tape, and a poor quality one at that.  (Maybe a tape would be preferable since you would be able to resume watching where you left off.)  I suspect that squeezing 4 hours of video onto one DVD-R disk took it's toll on the picture and sound quality.  Anyway, you have probably gathered that this is not the official DVD issued by the copyright owner, and it pales in comparison to official DVDs like&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Superman-The-1948-1950-Theatrical-Serials-Collection/dp/B000I8OM94/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Superman - The 1948 & 1950 Theatrical Serials Collection</a>&nbsp;,<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Batman-The-Complete-1943-Movie-Serial-Collection/dp/B000AQOHNA/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Batman - The Complete 1943 Movie Serial Collection</a>&nbsp;, or&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Batman-and-Robin-The-Complete-1949-Movie-Serial-Collection/dp/B0007G89FU/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Batman and Robin - The Complete 1949 Movie Serial Collection</a>&nbsp;.",1241568000,55,2086,6.248251748251748
539943,4,6303004849,"While the old Video Treasures VHS release of the Captain America serial actually claimed on the box to contain comic-book style adventures of Captain America and Bucky fighting the Nazis, hopefully purchasers of this DVD will know they are getting a fairly typical Republic serial of its period, with no connection to the comic book beyond the name and costume.  It has been plausibly suggested that the scenario was originally developed for Mr. Scarlet, a Fawcett comics hero who was secretly District Attorney Brian Butler and was aided by his secretary, who knew of his double identity; like Captain America, Mr. Scarlet was originally drawn by Jack Kirby.  Timely Comics apparently was so pleased by Republic's previous adaptations of the Fawcett characters Captain Marvel and Spy Smasher that they offered Republic the serial rights to Captain America at no charge, and Republic decided to switch the story to the much better known character--or at least to switch the name and costume.  Timely reportedly was not pleased with the resulting mongrelized portrayal; and in any case, as others have noted, there is no rationale for the D.A. character to don any costume at all, since he gets into the exact same type of scrapes whether in costume or not.  Despite that, and unusually for a mid-forties Republic serial, really solid performers are cast as both heroes and villains (usually one or the other fell short); on the downside (also unusually), some special effects are almost pathetic, though others are as terrific as expected.  The fight scenes, the main selling point for most Republic serials, are certainly good, but, oddly, less reminiscent of Simon and Kirby's comic-book fight scenes than those in many other cliffhangers from the studio.  As for the DVD itself, I've seen several copies of this serial on VHS and one other on DVD, apparently all deriving from the same film original, and this is second to none: not restored from archival materials, but very watchable quality from public domain collector sources.  ON THE OTHER HAND, the fifteen ""chapter"" breaks on the DVD do not in any way correspond to the actual fifteen chapters of the serial!!!  So if you watch one chapter, put the DVD away, and come back to watch the next chapter a day or a week later--the recommended way to watch these old serials at home--you are going to have some trouble finding where it was you left off.  People, this is not the way to do it--there is just no excuse for not making the DVD chaptering match the actual chapters of the serial.  (As of August 2010, CultRetro, the video alter ego of A. C. Comics, is offering this serial on 2 discs with correct chaptering.)",1240617600,64,2676,4.887417218543046
539944,3,6303004849,"For people who like classic theatrical cliffhanger serials, this is a fun serial to watch.  However, it saddens me that Republic Pictures chose not to be true to the comic book version when it made this serial abck then.

Captain America fans know that back in the 1940's, Captain America was secretly U.S. Army private Steve Rogers.  He had an indescrutible disc shaped shield, and he had a kid sidekick named Bucky (Bucky Barnes, company mascot).

In the serial, however, Captain America is two-fisted, crusading District Attorney Grant Gardner.  He does not have a shield.  It has been replaced with a hand gun.  There is no Bucky, his kid sidekick.  ""Buck has been replaced with Grant Gardner's secretary who is is assistant.

You are left to wonder as to why Grant Gardner bothers to put on a costume and a mask to disguise his true identity.  Grant Gardner fights the bad guys whether he is in costume or in civilian clothes.  The bad guys consider Grant Gardner and Captain America both a threat that both need to be gotten rid of.

Grant Gardner was not given the Super Soldier formula that turned 4F Army Reject Steve Rogers into Captain America in the comic books.  There was no reason for Grant Gardner to put on a costume and a mask to disguise his identity to work secretly as teh mysterious Cpatain America.

From this serial, you are left with the impression that Republic had already written the script to do another serial with, but decided when they got the rights from Timely Comics back then (Now named Marvel Comics), they decided to have the script altered and re-written to have the hero, Grant Gardner, make a change in wardrobe and put on a mask in some scenes.  But as I said, there was really no good reason for Grant Gardner to have to change into a costume and a mask, because he fought the bad guys whether in costume or in civilian clothes.  He did not play a mild-manered person or bungler in his civilian guise.  Again there really was no good reason at all for him to masquerade as a masked mystery man.

However, if you do like classic theatrical cliffhanger serials by Republic Pictures, then you may enjoy this serial just for that reason.  But if you are an avid comic book fan and insist on movies being true to the comic book version, then you will not appreciate this serial.",1236384000,5,2316,4.577669902912621

However, this 15-chapter serial delivers plenty of action in the classic Republic tradition. Cap does not have his mighty shield, but his fists make a powerful impression as he takes on the evil Scarab - played to the hilt by Lionel Atwill. Though not among Republic's all-time best chapterplays, a solid cast (look for Edward Van Sloan and John Hamilton in small roles) and vigorous stuntwork remain major assets. Due to budget overruns, ""Captain America"" emerged as Republic's most expensive serial with a final production cost of $223,000.

How wrong I was.

The Starry Night Productions version of this is complete trash.  I know that finding decent versions of the film can be trying, however that does not explain the production value of the DVD itself.  This DVD has the entire serial set up as one chapter.  You have to start the whole serial with chapter one each time you start the DVD.  This is really unhandy, as this DVD also shuts down, for no particular reason, in the middle of the movie. A single chapter for the disk is rather idiotic, since I know from experience how easy it is to create chapters when making the master DVD.  It is also fairly easy to make a decent DVD menu, so  why Starry Night Productions failed to do so is beyond me.
