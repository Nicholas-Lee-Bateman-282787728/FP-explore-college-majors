393222,3,6301969308,"The Kennedy assassination was probably the first news event I can vividly recall. I was eight years old and we lived 20 minutes from Washington in the northern Virginia suburbs when it happened. We sat glued to our TV sets the first two days, but we were standing in line several blocks from the Capitol building -- waiting to view the casket -- when Jack Ruby gunned down Lee Harvey Oswald in Dallas.

We went to see this when it ran in theaters, and I had not seen it again until just a few days ago. From a cinematic viewpoint, I'd give it five stars plus. I own a LOT of video on this subject, including actual coverage from all three networks, and am a researcher by trade and training, and it contains quite a lot of footage not available elsewhere.

However, all conspiracy theories aside, I'd give it about a minus one or two from an historical point of view. I nearly gagged during Richard Basehart's description of the transfer of power because we now know that was pure fiction. -- Kenny O'Donnell would have cut his wrists before calling Lyndon Johnson ""Mr. President.""

In fact, recently declassified documents show that Johnson was deliberately kept in the dark by O'Donnell and other members of Kennedy's staff for nearly 45 minutes after the shots were fired, and that it was a member of Johnson's own Secret Service detail who told him that Kennedy had died.

There were other instances of style over substance, which the Kennedy family probably had nothing to do with. That was during a time when people were still more or less expected to believe what they were told.

Watch it for the wonderful video and pacing, but please do NOT look at it as even remotely an accurate portrayal of a lot of what actually took place.",1294876800,,1738,4.57556270096463
393223,5,6301969308,"this is a truly good account of one of the worst days in history
 i think it is a important movie to add to anyone wishing to get a feeling of how the events on november 22 played out and, all the aftermath.
 i hope one day  to see this on dvd i have the video copy but, its gotton old and worn out and a dvd would be just fine",1258156800,,327,3.5774647887323945

393225,5,6301969308,"Whether you believe Oswald acted alone, was part of a conspiracy, or was nowhere around, this film is worth the price.  As a native Dallasite, I found the film footage of my hometown when it was still a great place to live to be priceless.  Golly, remember when people still shopped downtown?!  The film offers a very realistic flavor of both Dallas and America in pre-assassination times, it's almost unnerving to see an America that still trusted its elected representatives and institutions of authority.  Richard Basehart's narration is excellent, and Kennedy's presidency as well as his trip to the south is well explained to even a complete Kennedy novice.  The ""man on the street"" interviews that give us the reaction of both famous heads of state and average Americans immediately upon hearing the news of the assassination are interesting and sad, and the entire film will serve to transport you back in time as no present-day piece on this subject can do.  Much of the second half of the film deals with the planning and execution of Kennedy's funeral, and this comes as close as anything I've yet seen to recreating what those days were like.  If you're too young to remember this event, this film is a must see.  Even us conspiracy theorists can overlook the assumption of Oswald's guilt (an assumption that, unlike post-Warren Commission material, is not shoved down your throat).  I have been researching Kennedy assassination materials for years, and I find these contemporary efforts such as ""Four Days in November"" and Mark Lane's film ""Rush to Judgement"" to be far more valuable tools than latter day efforts, as the waters have now been so muddied by disinformation that we lose the real feel of these tragic events.  Highly recommended.",1137974400,6,1756,4.942176870748299
393226,5,6301969308,"""Four Days In November"" is my all-time favorite program dealing with the assassination of President John F. Kennedy. You really get a sense of ""re-living"" the events of November 22-25, 1963, when America's all-too-young, 46-year-old leader was gunned down on the sunny streets of Dallas, Texas.

This 1964 black-&-white documentary, skillfully narrated by actor Richard Basehart, was filmed only months after the events, making the ""re-creations"" that were filmed for this movie all the more effective, since the people involved, the locations, the landmarks, and even the automobiles had not changed to a great degree (if at all) since the tragedy occurred.  I truly had the sense of being there BEFORE it happened because of the very good re-created scenes.

This wonderfully-edited chronological documentary guides the viewer through all four of those dark November days that shocked the nation in late 1963. An integral part of this program lies in its outstanding musical score, by Elmer Bernstein. Mr. Bernstein's stirring score fits just perfectly here, adding emotional impact to each portion of the film.

In addition to many re-created scenes, there is a hefty amount of stock news footage presented throughout this 123-minute film -- some of which you probably have seen before, and some you probably haven't. The Joan Crawford/Richard Nixon clip was one I'd never seen in the past, as well as the footage of Lee Harvey Oswald's funeral, which nearly no one attended.

One particular ""re-created"" scene in the film that has an especially ""eerie"" feeling to it is the scene where we see Wesley Frazier driving his 1953 Chevrolet sedan toward the ""drab bulk"" of the Texas School Book Depository Building, which looms ahead in the foreground. Frazier was the 19-year-old Depository co-worker of Lee Harvey Oswald's who gave Oswald a ride to work on the morning of the President's assassination.

The ""Zapruder Film"" is not represented in this documentary. It was to be yet another 11 years before the public at large was to see Mr. Zapruder's infamous film. ""Four Days"" does include a sequence from the ""Nix Film"", however.

Wolper Productions sidestepped all the conspiracy theories [thank goodness] and stuck by the Warren Commission Report for this documentary.

Many of the facts surrounding JFK's assassination have been disputed and debated by researchers for decades. And this tragic crime will likely remain a topic that shall cause heated discussion for many more years to come.

But what the film ""Four Days In November"" does accomplish is to allow the viewer to re-live those sorrowful November days, in the order in which the events transpired, based on the evidence available. This is definitely one program that deserves to be in anyone's JFK collection.",995500800,22,2776,5.192393736017897
393227,5,6301969308,"If you are a student of the Kennedy assassination (lone assassin or  conspiracy believer) this is a must see, MUST HAVE, video.  Yes, it's  screenplay is the Warren Commission Report, but more importantly, it is the  actual film footage of the last days and burial of John F. Kennedy.  It's  historical value is unparalleled.  If you were alive then, you will  remember and reflect.  If you weren't, then watch it and you will  understand how the world stood still during those four days in November.",959558400,7,500,4.776470588235294

7818555,5,6301969308,"I was in 2nd grade at a Catholic grade school that weekend.  Watching this was going through a time warp.  I was hoping this would show up somewhere on DVD, but this was fine.  The narration and music is outstanding, along with the reenactments throughout.",1362873600,,256,4.644444444444445
7818556,5,6301969308,"Though they recreated some events for this 1964 film, they evidently used the real people involved, so we see pretty authentic stuff from the likes of an Oswald co-worker who drove the assassin to work. This 2 hour film was made very soon after the facts depicted, and it holds pretty well. It perhaps lingers a bit too long and is quite maudlin about the funeral aspects. But the days leading up to the shooting are the really valuable parts of this. We see JFK in Tampa a few days before the killing. And we see more of his Texas trip than usual, including a lot of footage from Houston and Fort Worth. This was made when people still believed official accounts of government events, and it's fun to relive the naivete of those long-gone days. The events surrounding the transfer of power to LBJ have been updated a lot since this film was made, and we now know there was great tension between the JFK people and the LBJ people. This is a long-overlooked gem in the JFK assassination canon. Check it out.",1362700800,,1006,4.4728260869565215
7818557,5,6301969308,"I agree with the last review...This is the first comprehensive coverage of the Kennedy assassination and the days that followed that I watched. There was so much footage pre and post assassination that I had never seen before. Even though this film follows the accepted ""Warren Commission"" finding of what happened it is facinating...It would be approriate at the 50th anniversary this year that this was offered on DVD. Very moving",1358294400,,432,5.098591549295775
7818558,5,6301969308,"This 1964 documentary is excellent!! It is a film by David Wolpher about the JFK assassination. Turner Classic Movies, to my surprise, ran this film on the evening of November 21, 2013 in widescreen. I caught it by mistake about 18 minutes in to it. I had never seen a widescreen copy of this film. It was GREAT! Nice to know it's out there, but not in the consumer's libraries. It has only been released on VHS many years ago. It runs a solid 2 hours in black & white. All archival historical footage. I write this review on 53 anniversary of the JFK assassination. Please release ""Four Days In November"" on DVD. Please.",1348790400,,621,4.456140350877193
7818559,4,6301969308,"This is a well done documentary that came out in 1964, when the JFK assassination was still fresh in everyone's mind.  We now have proof  that Lee Harvey Oswald was the sole assassine, which this film elucidates. In any case the atmosphere of mourning is captured well and it's just like you are actually there in Dallas and DC. The whole world was grieving and LBJ rode the wave to pass unheard of civil rights legislation, but also get us into Vietnam at the behest of JFK's advisors. We now know that Lee Harvey Oswald pulled the trigger from the TSBD in Dallas. But that's not what this film is about, this is about capturing the moment when the nation and world mourned a great leader at a crucial point in history.",1327104000,,720,4.446969696969697
