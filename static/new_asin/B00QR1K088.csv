8692413,4,B00QR1K088,A shower and kind of a fight scene with about 10 women giving full frontals. Three other women are topless only. 2 - 4 other women give full frontal. No baldness in this film. 1 woman has fake ugly breasts. The rest are beautiful real ones. The fight scenes are atrocious. Wished the lead female would have appeared in the nude.,1521417600,,328,4.39344262295082

8692415,4,B00QR1K088,"While some DVD reviews say this isn't the one, the Amazon Video streaming version as of July 2016, is the apparently uncut (at least as much as the VHS tapes I've had of it) Ray Sharkey, Judy Landers 1985 ""Hell Hole""

Only, it's in HD, and 16:9 widescreen. Quite an improvement of an openly sleazy movie. Watch it like this and recycle the old VHS tape.",1469750400,3,353,4.348484848484849

With the rising fan base in the genre of horror films it was inevitable that along with the good there would be bad movies made. For the most part the horror genre of the late seventies and early eighties leveled off in the good to mediocre level. But on occasion a movie came along that was so bad all you could do was sit and watch and wonder how anyone could be given the money to make a movie this bad. HELLHOLE is a prime example of that.

HELLHOLE opens with a woman murdered in her home by a psychopathic hitman (Ray Sharkey) looking for some documents she has on hand. Her daughter (Judy Landers) witnesses the murder but escapes the killer. The documents being sought were from a doctor her mother worked for that would have destroyed his career. Landers suffers intense amnesia from the incident and this same doctor sends her to an asylum for help so he can keep an eye on her.

The usual problems ensue with terrible help working at the asylum and Sharkey turning up trying to discover what Landers knows so he can find the documents. This asylum is one that always seems convenient for exploitation films as most of the time the female inmates spend taking showers or in various forms of undress. Apparently security and hiring proper staff is not something this institution is interested in. It is interested in strange techniques to explore and the main doctor there (Mary Woronov) experiments on patients she deems unfit to stay with the group.

I could go on to tell you about the young orderly who dresses like he stepped out of a MIAMI VICE shoot rather than in the normal orderly uniform but that would make it seem a tad more interesting. In fact this movie is so terrible it doesnt even qualify for the usual so bad its good standard that many bad movies end up in. Even playing as background noise this movie is not worth the time or money. It would even be a chore to watch if they paid you to do so.",1443484800,4,1980,4.416438356164384
8692417,1,B00QR1K088,"Not the Judy Landers movie described in the product details, editorial review and the cover photo. Not new as it was described. Did not come wrapped in plastic. The case and disc look used.",1443312000,,189,4.588235294117647
8692418,5,B00QR1K088,"I purchased this very recently and it is, in fact, the Hellhole starring Mary Woronov and Ray Sharkey; the same movie I saw on Cinemax way back in the mid 80s. It's good, fun genre trash. It's definitely ripped from a VHS, but given the rarity of this picture, it's not a bad deal. Cheezy Flicks usually puts out good stuff, although those expecting top notch a/v quality are likely to be disappointed. I wasn't. I knew what I was in for and it delivered.",1434153600,5,455,4.364705882352941
8692419,4,B00QR1K088,"Tina G's review is spot on.  The cover art art is from a classic WIP film Hellhole which takes place in a mental institution.  It stars Ray Sharkey, Edy Williams, Judy Landers, and the legendary Mary Woronov; and is directed by Pierre De Moro.  As far as I know, it has no dvd release, unfortunately, as it totally deserves one

I did not buy this dvd, so I cannot be 100% certain, but based on the synopses, and the performers listed, I think this dvd is actually a Cirio Santiogo feature called Women Of Hell's Island.  That said, I like both WIP films. If you like films like, Savage Sisters, and Caged Fury (not the one with Erik Estrada), then you should like this one.

Buyer Beware.",1428624000,,689,4.3858267716535435
8692420,1,B00QR1K088,"Warning: this movie is not the awesome cult classic starring ""Ray Sharkey"" as Silk. Do not be fooled, for some reason they have the same box cover!  It will not let me post a review without rating it a star. This movie does not warrant any sort of star.",1426896000,5,253,4.163265306122449
