8212266,4,B000U713V8,"In IT HAPPENED AT NIGHTMARE INN, two homicidally insane sisters named Veronica and Margot set out to rid the world of women that they consider to be wanton or promiscuous. They make such females disappear forever from within their hostel! Enter Judy Geeson (FEAR IN THE NIGHT) as a beautiful guest at the INN.  Will she figure out what the two killers are up to before they include her on their ""to die"" list? This is a macabre creeper w/ a wonderfully grim finale...",1381881600,,467,4.559523809523809
8212267,4,B000U713V8,"This movie, about two religious, but twisted, sisters, is suspense ful, but may have been edited. Judy Geeson is searching for her sister, when she stays at the inn, run by the above mentioned sisters.  Both have a hypocritical nature (however) but that doesn't stop their bloody methods in dealing with young women that they feel are immoral or immodest, with some gruesome results. No horror classic, but interesting.",1282608000,,419,5.072463768115942
8212268,2,B000U713V8,"Not really sure what ""it"" was that happened at ""Nightmare Inn"", but the lovely Judy Geeson is the only reason to make an reservation at this ""Inn""!!",1236297600,2,148,4.518518518518518
8212269,1,B000U713V8,"In spite of the running time on the package (120 min.), this is in fact a severely cut version, running 67 minutes. I had hopes of a version more complete than the 83 minute version with Dutch subs that I already own. The first murder (that of Judy Geeson's sister) is completely missing - an important plot item! Other cuts have been made, particularly to the small amount of nudity in the film. Too bad, because the quality is quite good for such an obscure movie.",1197504000,18,466,4.430232558139535
