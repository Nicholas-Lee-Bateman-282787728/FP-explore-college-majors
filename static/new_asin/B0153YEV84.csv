7428709,5,B0153YEV84,Amazing audio quality and photography.  Includes 2 shows.  Must buy.  Really well done.,1453334400,,87,5.538461538461538
7428717,5,B0153YEV84,"It's amazing to see the crowds reactions to this hybrid metal group. Acceptance of them is debated. Are they metal or are they hurting the genre? I can attest that I'm aware of ""Metal"" and some forms of it; but I've never was into the music. But Babymetal has opened a door for me to look into something I was wasn't into. Being into Jpop music prior helped me a little as well. As a whole I think it helps music lovers in general regardless of music taste. The live show in London proves that you don't have to be closed minded and you can enjoy music regardless of origin or genre.",1475884800,,583,4.214285714285714
7428718,2,B0153YEV84,"Two concerts in one Bluray pack, that's great. However what isn't gray is the apalling low quality of the picture. The Bluray has a grainy and blurry look to it that is very distracting, sometimes even appearing pixelated. That's how bad some segments can get.

I don't know where things went wrong but this is not the crisp and clear image you come to expect from a Bluray disc. It's as if they just put burned the DVD version of these concerts into Bluray format. I'm very disappointed with the quality of this set.

When you compare it to the high quality of the Live at Budokan Bluray then you see the jarring difference.

Get this set if you love BABYMETAL like I do and want to support them, don't get it if you're expecting a high quality set. You're probably better off watching a stream in that case.",1475452800,4,809,4.416107382550336
7428719,5,B0153YEV84,Forget the live show videos recorded by fans that you've seen of Babymetal. This DVD is so much better. There are plenty of close-up shots. The audio is so much better as well.,1471737600,2,176,4.363636363636363
7428720,5,B0153YEV84,"Two great shows from this crazy thing called Babymetal! Second show has first performance of Road of Resistance! Only complaint is the Blu ray doesn't have any extras. I know that's to be expected with this entity, but still, *something* extra would have been nice. Oh, and Blu ray works fine with US players, same region (not so much with DVD).",1470096000,3,345,4.672131147540983
7428721,5,B0153YEV84,"While both concerts in this set were great, the Brixton show was better.  Something I have discovered about BabyMetal is that the bigger the stage means the better the show. These young ladies need room to move.  BabyMetal is refreshing, innovative, and just plain fun!",1469491200,,269,4.955555555555556

7428724,5,B0153YEV84,"If you love Babymetal as I do, then you will LOVE this 2 night dvd, as it has 2 venues, 2 seperare sets, and a ton of fun. Babymetal shows why it has captured the herats if metalheads around the world in this dvd. Grab it while you can",1465430400,,235,3.816326530612245
7428725,5,B0153YEV84,BABYMETALS 4th concert DVD that includes 2 concerts! Great shows in a great DVD! Great picture and sound! Ignore the hefty price tag cause it's so all worth it! Check out eBay cause that's where I got my copy cheaper. BABYMETAL Forever!!!,1460332800,,238,4.690476190476191
7428726,5,B0153YEV84,Two terrific indoor concerts in London. Epic performances by the girls and the kami band.,1453766400,,89,5.0
8732594,5,B0153YEV84,Got my DVD of Babymetal concert couldn't go to one but this is the second best. Concert tickets are too much money for them. Everything was good. Nothing negative to report.,1527206400,,173,4.612903225806452
8732595,4,B0153YEV84,"The concerts covered in this BD aren't as flashy as some of the other BABYMETAL BDs that cover their headline concerts in Japan. However, if you're a hardcore BABYMETAL fan, this is basically the only professional coverage outside of fan-cams on the Internet of ""Metal Resistance Episode II"". The BD comes with a map of their 2014 World Tour which I thought was nice.",1524009600,,367,4.75
8732596,1,B0153YEV84,"Love Babymetal to death and picked this up on my quest to collect all their live DVDs. Concert is 10/10... however, this is not a Blu-ray DVD. It comes in a Blu-ray pack, but the quality is low. Defiantly not HD. The case says 16:9 and 1080p but the picture is extremely grainy and pixelated.",1523232000,,292,4.327272727272727
8732597,5,B0153YEV84,"Two amazing shows by Baby Metal in the UK. Both shows are very similar, except for the last number or two. The girls and their band are full of energy. Unlike many other bands they're not vulgar or political. They're just fun to watch. I wish I could see them live. See you!",1521849600,,274,4.188679245283019
8732598,5,B0153YEV84,"The two concerts on this Blue-Ray disc are simply amazing. The videos give us multiple views of Babymetal, the Kami Band, and the audience as the performers and audience display an incredible level of mutual  love and admiration. Both concerts were in London. In both, Su-Metal was 16, while Yui-Metal and Moa-Metal were 15. The first concert was July 7, 2014 at the Forum. Because the Forum has a shallow stage, when the curtain fell, the girls were suddenly faced with a very exuberant audience about 15 feet away. For a second or so, they were startled by the intensity of the audience's reaction, but then they quickly connected. For the entire concert, there was an exchange of music and mutual admiration as Babymetal performed and the audience responded. The result was a joint performance by Babymetal, the Kami Band and the Audience. Su-Metal encouraged the audience to sing songs I never saw her try with other audiences and their response was awe-inspiring. Clearly, everybody had a wonderful time. The girls seemed reluctant to leave, but they had places to go. The second event was in November at the Academy Brixton. The audience was about 15 feet further away, but no less exuberant than the first. In this second show, the Babymetal girls are even more energized by the crowd, delivering another amazing performance. At the end, they are even more emotionally uplifted, almost to tears as they each thank the audience before their final ""See You."" These videos are a chance to see how Babymetal draws energy from an appreciative audience and how wonderful a concert can be.",1503014400,4,1589,4.907063197026022
8732599,5,B0153YEV84,"First of all, there is one review here that gives the Blu-ray only two stars, and that is based on the fact that the picture quality is no better than an ordinary DVD. Yes, that is absolutely true. This looks like they took a DVD and just transferred it to a Blu-ray. HOWEVER. I'm still giving this 5 stars because these are such exciting performances. Sure, it's the same set as the Budokan concert, which is much more spectacular. But if you are a hardcore BABYMETAL fan (is there any other kind?) you won't want to miss this.

For one thing, it's only $21. And because there is no huge revolving stage, the camera stays on the girls and their choreography way more than the Budokan, Wembley or Tokyo Dome DVDs. I'll give you an example that only a BABYMETAL fan would understand. You know the dance at the beginning of Road of Resistance where the girls look like they are riding horses? None of the other videos show that whole dance, and this one does, and it's great. They are so fantastic.

 Also, the girls seem really fired up to be playing in England. These shows prove they don't need huge stages and giant TV screens to blow audiences away. You also get to check out the fact that BABYMETAL can switch out guitar players and drummers like it's nothing. The drummer for these two shows is not the guy from those other three concerts, but he's just as amazing. As usual, the band is explosive and astounding, and the audience loves it. I just watched it for the first time and I think it's a bargain.",1499990400,2,1510,4.424460431654676
