7539043,4,B018373PJ4,Solid anime with a lot of action. Story is kinda all over the place at times and the series itself is too short for the amount of characters. Would like to have seen a little more background on some. Animation is gorgeous and the dub cast is particularly good. Nothing spectacular or unique about this anime. Wold recommend if your looking for a solid a me to pass some time. Overall 3.5/5.,1456617600,10,390,4.430555555555555

8741282,5,B018373PJ4,"Tokyo is under attack by espers...people with immense psychic powers that intend to make it a esper sanctuary. Our only hope is the mysterious White Girl and her companions, friendly espers with a close history to the Professor, the leader of the terrorist faction. Can justice and hope prevail?

I wasn't particularly expecting this series to be good, but I was pleasantly surprised. It starts with nail biting action from the very first episode, and constantly raises the stakes. The heroine and hero are both wonderful, real people who suffer for their ideals, and the supporting cast is also excellent. The esper battles are fun but not consequence free, and done in wonderful, vibrant animation.

The only issues are that 12 episodes are too short to tell the story. The series ends way too soon, and barely explains enough of its world. Don't get me wrong, the world is still engaging in spite of it, but with 24 episodes this would have been even better. There's also some random silliness in there that feels out of place, like a certain tribute to a couple of movie actors, and the weird get-up of one of the mentor characters. It's a credit to the anime that it still holds your attention despite that.

Definitely an enjoyable anime. It's very close to Psychic Squad/ Zettai Karen Children in tone, so if you loved it, you will definitely enjoy this series. A nice sleeper hit that makes you wish for  a second season.",1503878400,,1429,4.7269076305220885

===========================================================================================================

- Comments: This was a pretty cool anime. Lots of superpower in it. Some fan-service. Has a small but interesting cast that I found likable.
I would say if you liked animes like K, then you will most likely like this one too. Oh yeah, and waifus.

This anime has an interesting diversity of characters and powers. It was entertaining seeing some of the social interactions between them, as well. Watching powers collide with each other as they struggle to dominate their opponents in battle was also suspenseful and entertaining.

- Features: English and Japanese audio, as well as English subs. Includes 12 episodes on 2 Blu-rays, and 12 on 2 DVDs with a run-time of about 5 hours. Rated TV-MA for some fantasy violence, and moderate fan-service.

8741288,2,B018373PJ4,"To be as honest as i can about this, i'll start from top to bottom. This design is beautiful, very pretty lighting and character movements are smooth as butter. Characters seem interesting but with 12 episodes you don't really get much background, even worse is that the last few episodes throw even more characters into the mess. Story is interesting but i don't know if good is the word, not bad but not good. So much gets thrown out the window of thiings that could have been explained, like why does the main villain play the piano in a forest? Or why some of the characters turned good when they were bad, I cant say more without spoilers.

This anime could have been so much more, but in the long run was ruined by the producers desperation to throw in ideas about people being able to do greatness and the importance of history or how everyone should be friends, etc. etc. that sort of bullcrap. If anything that was the part that made this anime hard to watch, when the characters talked about walking in the espers shoes to understand them or history being such an importance on peoples lives. Its junk like that where an anime just becomes a personal mess from the producer. It starts out like 90% of other animes where the main character has some special purpose/power and is very weak to the point of being annoying when they get beaten in every fight until they get trained (which really doesnt change anything). In the later episodes i ended up liking the so called ""villains"" because they had more of a reason, a much better reason to do what they were doing, why were the ""heros"" fighting? Because it was the right thing to do? Dont lie to yourself, the creators obviously just had an idea of what they look like and that was all, no background, no depth, and no reason to care for them. The ending was just garbage, out of everything that happens nothing actually changed and it left off on a huge cliffhanger. That all being said it was just a waste of my time, I really hope the studio doesnt make a second season,  and if they do i'll be rooting for the people with a real reason to fight

This was a bad anime and thats all i will say about it, nothing really jumps out unless you are one of those weirdos who think they have special powers or purpose in life, then everything this anime trys to say will speak to you. If you are normal then its like watching a fight with unstable women on 4chan",1464652800,,2417,4.378619153674833
8741289,5,B018373PJ4,I just finished watching the wildly entertaining and intensely immersive Japanese Anime series entitled Tokyo ESP!  It has a pretty satisfying conclusion which left several plot points unfinished instead of neatly trying to tie up every loose strand.  The ending was neither happy nor sad.  This bowl of porridge was prepared just right!,1462665600,,337,5.320754716981132
8741290,3,B018373PJ4,"It was ok , cant say it was nessecarily bad or good. Might watch a second season but wouldnt be disappointed if it never came out. Story backtracked way too much.",1462060800,,162,4.258064516129032
