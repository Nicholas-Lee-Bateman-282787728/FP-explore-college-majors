6897815,4,B00R1MMO3G,"This set brings together the two 3 episode series and the Christmas special with John Hamm.
Each story is unrelated and seems to follow a ""what if..."" thought that entered Charlie Brooker. The plots vary from bizarre to shocking and the twists are more often unpredictable than initially thought. Several of the episodes will leave the viewer questioning their own views on society.
Overall a good series. I drop one star as the special expanded on an idea in one of the earlier episodes, but then again perhaps that's the point - it was another extension of a ""what if...""",1455321600,11,573,4.74

6897827,5,B00R1MMO3G,"The pilot episode is definitely a trial by fire.  It was enough to turn me off completely, until several friends recommended the show emphatically so I gave it another go.  This being an anthology (no running connecting plot line), I would encourage people to skip straight past the pilot (""National Anthem"") without fear of missing anything.  You can come back to it if you really want to after you get a feel for how dark the show can go if you're very, very curious.  Trust me, the rest of the series is a picnic compared to the pilot.

People who judge this show based solely on the pilot are being hugely unfair, because the rest of it will leave a permanent mark on you (and I mean that in a good way).  If you're like me and have despaired of ever finding really good psychological horror and truly surprising twist endings again, this is the show for you.  Series 3 is a lot lighter (with even one very sweet tearjerker episode), but the entire show is uniformly extremely dark and cynical (and yes, depressing.  Though not as depressing as real life has become lately).  Most episodes make you think, sometimes for days and days.  Top marks go to ""White Bear,"" ""Men Against Fire,"" and ""Hated in the Nation"" (which is movie length and absolutely outstanding).  (And full disclosure, I watched this on Netflix so those last two aren't included in this set).

Very few eps aren't quite as strong, but for my dollar this is the best show on TV right now.  I can't say enough good about it.  See for yourself.",1486598400,4,1513,4.514705882352941

6897833,1,B00R1MMO3G,"Watched Season 1 - Episode 1 on Netflix. Can't rate this low enough. Hopefully I can save someone from this depravity. Sure you expect a dark show but this was obscene in concept.  Acting was good (for the most part) but this first episode was enough to have me turned off for the entire show. Never showed anything directly but the content and images that it invoked was more than enough. The number of 5 start reviews here and the ratings from RottenTomatoes, IMDB and others make me worry about how sick people must be to find this entertaining. I will do my best to forget ever watching this. This show reminds me of Human Centipede (movie) which I never watched but read reviews of.  Read those reviews and a description of that movie.

And if you like that sort of book (movie), then you'll probably like this series. The different societies depicted in each episode are a little disturbing. And each episode seems to feature a different or alternate reality. Certainly makes you think about your use of screens, especially the smartphone.

It's a little ironic that it's a commentary on screens in our society, and yet we are watching each episode on a... screen.",1480896000,4,600,5.122448979591836

6897838,5,B00R1MMO3G,"The episode, San Junipero is an immediate classic piece of television writing and directing. This is not the dark sheen of most Black Mirror episodes, but more like when Twilight Zones' Rod Serling would go nostalgic, write for and from the heart. Beautifully acted, photographed, and directed, this episode takes us to a place (literally) that we will all one day face.",1477612800,2,370,4.983870967741935
6897839,1,B00R1MMO3G,"Not at all even remotely akin to Twilight Zone. I understand they want to shock the audience and try desperately to incorporate a technology based effort to do so. Sex and deplorable actions are what sell videos these days. I do agree that the acting is superb. The sound tracks work very well. It's got good video angles and editing. It's a very good BBC style series but, frankly, I was disappointed after watching. It is not the frightening, nightmare scare that very good horror films induce and it is not anywhere near the quality classic of the 1960's nor the 1990's psychology thrillers. It's a series representing the depravity of humans in the 21st century. But the themes are predictable. My daughter said it, there is so much second hand embarrassment that it is difficult to watch. They are obviously geared at getting the common person to go ""ooh ahhh!"" <insert tittering here>. It has no esoteric or exotic or amazing factor. It's heavily sensational and steals from the Matrix, 1984, and other stellar movies and books. There is no imagination at all and definitely not of the mind bending quality of Twilight Zone. I know others disagree with me but I say, don't waste your time.",1477526400,3,1195,4.75
6897840,2,B00R1MMO3G,"Very depressing...  I initially thought it was pretty good, but when none of the characters seems to get a break, I just couldn't watch anymore.  One particular episode. ""National Anthem""  which dealt with Beastiality was beyond the point of depressing.  OK, so the name of the Show is ""Black Mirror"" and you can pretty well imagine that the stories are not going to be pretty... but there isn't anything redeeming.  There is a Horror aspect to the stories...  I like scary stories, but there is something...unfulfilling about what's going on in these stories...  There is a ""twilight Zone"" quality to the series, but the morals of the stories are so darkly twisted somehow as to be un worthwhile...  I think the acting and directing was good... but otherwise, you're gonna need a couple bottles of Zoloft to watch this series...",1477353600,5,829,4.871428571428571
6897841,4,B00R1MMO3G,"Season 1 and 2 are appropriately creepy, but it's with the first episode of the third season that I think the show hits it's stride.
The episode is called 'Nosedive,' and it concerns a young lass who is bound in on all sides by her social media popularity scale. She finds it necessary to structure her life around getting approval ratings from highly ranked people, and there are real-world consequences for failure: credit ratings, airline stand-by seats, even access to services like medical care and car rentals are governed by approval ratings. Get low enough, and you go to jail.

6897845,5,B00R1MMO3G,"A friend recommended this series to me - he said it was imaginative and told amazing, thought-provoking stories. So I checked it out on Netflix and realized it was even BETTER than my friend said and I wanted to own it so I could watch it again and again in the years to come. So I bought this non-U.S. region DVD since computers play PAL... and it worked on my computer for the first disc. However, the second and third discs wouldn't play unless I reset the DVD Region on my computer. But I didn't want to do this, because you can only reset the DVD Region on your computer only 4-5 times before it ""locks"" and you can only play that last Region. But not a problem - this series is so fantastic that I quite willingly bought a SONY S6700 Region Free Blu Ray-DVD Player - now I can watch this plus any any other discs from overseas that are not available in the U.S. And the Upscaling feature on the SONY S6700 is fantastic - it makes DVDs look as crisp as Blu Rays. This solution might seem like overkill, but to me it was well worth it, to be able to watch BLACK MIRROR whenever I want.",1475625600,16,1089,4.165876777251185
6897846,5,B00R1MMO3G,"I love the Twilight Zone and abstract concepts. I was hooked on the show ever since I saw it on Netflix and I knew that I had to own it.

This series of episodes after the first episode all surrounds social media and controversial technology and processes with the first episode starting in the present and the rest set in the questionable present/ future.

Even though it says it is region restriction. I looked at the region number and it's region 9 which means it is able to play anywhere, to all of my knowledge.",1469664000,3,516,4.421052631578948
8693696,1,B00R1MMO3G,"I have watched this on Netflix. Apparently this DVD set on sale here won't play in the US. Anyway, the vision of mankind offered by this show is offensive, sick and twisted, without any redeeming value. It's the Twilight Zone, if the TZ were populated solely by the worst sort of people. Do NOT think you'll see a glimpse of Rod Serling anywhere near this dreck. I'm not the kind of person who says ""that is indecent,"" but that was my exact thought after watching the first episode, ""The National Anthem."" The other episodes were less grotesque, but really, BM takes place in a world I hope I never live to see.

8693700,5,B00R1MMO3G,"This series systematically takes one technical invention that is already developed or that is going to be developed in the near future and transpose it in a not so far future when these inventions have become predominant. The common point of all these episodes is that the control any individual believes they have over their own lives is negated by the use of this or that invention by people who weaponize them into control tools.

Then either the criminal side of the individual who is taken control of by the unknown manipulator is absolutely unacceptable by all possible standards, like pedophilia, and that becomes the leverage of the manipulator who blackmails the culprit into doing something even worse. Or the invention is pushed into some kind of society where nothing is under the control of any individual at all and the society that emerges is a society of eugenics, dictatorship, brutality, perversion, etc.

At times some episodes get to some kind of empathetic science-fiction, like a paradise on earth for those who pass over and are able to live forever in a pleasure town known with some exotic name where they are young forever. Unluckily along this line, we can also find those who want to get some revenge on the people who use twitter or some other social media to be nasty with someone, anyone, provided it hurts and provided you are one in a long list of participants who are the real target.

Friend becomes the very synonym of ""hostile enemy"" and to befriend someone is to announce and utter their soon to come death, demise, destruction. Yet along that line the most ignominious are those who implement some eugenics to clean up society and get rid of all those they consider as pest, cockroaches, roaches for short, no matter what the imperfection may be, though apparently not the skin color, and actually the Blacks in such situations seem to be those who find it difficult to go along with this discrimination that implies elimination and annihilation.

Far from being a series for those who are afraid of modern technology and mass media, it is a series for those who are conscious of the dangers these technologies and mass media can convey if they are used by criminal minds, if protection is not waterproof, and true enough protection can never be waterproof or airtight. So enjoy the thrills you can get from the deepest layers of your unconscious or at least secret impulses, drives, instincts, etc.

The one I find most disturbing is pedophilia in a boy who is hardly of age and who probably has not integrated the fact he is an adult and no longer a child. It is then not surprising that he can kill another older pedophile just to survive and be arrested by the police with the prize money he had himself robbed from a bank. And it all started with a love cake.

Good nightmares to sensitive minds and fragile beings. Apparently, the passage from Channel 4 in the first two seasons to Netflix in the third season makes the series a lot more gloomy and poignant if not sickening.
