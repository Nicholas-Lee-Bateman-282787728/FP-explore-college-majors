8435281,2,B004LXBKDI,"Ostensibly, this DVD is about Stonehenge and the megalithic monuments and cultures that created them. While there is so much we don't know because they were created by pre-literate societies and the gulf in time is so great, there is much we can know about these monuments and their construction.

This is what the DVD was supposed to be about and what I hoped it would be about. Unfortunately, the primary thrust of this DVD seems to be about the numerous societies and groups of people who believe themselves to be ""Druids"". The DVD begins with a ""Druid"" - a modern man claiming to be one at least - complaining that he and other fellow ""Druids"" are not allowed to ""practice their religion"" within the Stonehenge complex.

The problem here is that Druids - including the real, historical ones - had nothing to do with Stonehenge. The only written accounts we have state that Druidic worship took place in sacred groves of trees. The Stonehenge monument, as well as other megalith complexes - predate the Celtic Druids by many centuries. To hear the ridiculous, modern, wannabe Druid interviewed on this DVD is a complete waste of time for the viewer.

I was very dissatisfied with this DVD. There is very little useful information on this DVD and I would certainly caution those wanting to learn about Stonehenge and other monumental structures that they will learn little from this DVD. I thought much of the cinematography was quite good and many views of these monuments very good. That's why it got two stars instead of one.",1371081600,2,1530,4.766037735849056
