8199646,5,B000R9CO5I,"Wow. A short film about adultery in 1915. A simple plot about lust heightened by the performances. The soundtrack is so infectious (yes, that crazy laugh over the music) that I'd still love this short film, just based on the music score. Highly recommended. A+",1391040000,,260,4.8
8199647,2,B000R9CO5I,"Fatty's Spooning Days, 1915 film

Fatty plays a piano for the maid and is chastened for being too kind to the help. They go to a park and sit on a bench. A policeman sits in a tree to watch for any couple that breaks the law (""spooning not allowed""). Fatty and his girl are brought in (""$30 or 30 days""). They make a telephone call for help. Their fines are paid and they are released. [This would probably be better if there was an audio track to better explain the events.] It records the culture of that era.

Roscoe Arbuckle had a sudden fall from popularity when he was wrongfully accused of a vile crime that led to a woman's death. Do people have a hidden desire to hate popular entertainers? Does this remind you of Bennie Hill's comedies?",1322179200,,747,4.328571428571428
