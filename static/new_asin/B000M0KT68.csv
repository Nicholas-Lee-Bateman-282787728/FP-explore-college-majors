2718006,3,B000M0KT68,This system is very difficult for me to enjoy. I find it uncomfortable. The disc does help to explain it a little better so maybe with practice I will improve. Good teaching aid.,1389225600,,178,4.424242424242424

2718008,5,B000M0KT68,"I was working out, and getting in shape at a gym when I had an accident that left me in a wheelchair, and then on two walking casts for a year. I gained back all of the weight I lost, and a whole ot more. My muscles also turned to jello.

After that, as a senior pushing age 60, I simply gave up. I have a horse, so I did get some exercise, but that was it, and it wasnt' enough.

I'm now in my mid-60s and determined to get in shape. I used Groupons to learn about Yoga and pilates, and in between, I use the beginner sculpting circle DVD. It's a terrific workout for beginners. It doesn't take too long to learn albeit at first you may not get the hang of it. It doesn't matter if you do everything perfectly, you still feel the results IMMEDIATELY, and you get better each session. The best part is your core feels stronger very quickly. I believe that for me, the short workout is far more effective than the hour and a half I used to spend at the gym.

I highly recommend that people interested in pilates get a magic circle (I got mine at Amazon), and get going!&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Winsor-Pilates-Sculpting-Circle-Beginner/dp/B000M0KT68/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Winsor Pilates Sculpting Circle Beginner</a>",1376956800,29,1270,4.84331797235023

2718011,5,B000M0KT68,This is a nice addition to any workout at any level.  I got a Windsor companion DVD and it was really helpful.,1363046400,3,110,4.0
2718012,3,B000M0KT68,Is it just me or is every one of Mari Winsor's Winsor Pilates DVDs the same? I have three of these DVDs and Im so bored with doing the same exercises over and over again. This is a workout using the circle and it's basically the same thing as her 20min circle workout. If your a beginner this might work for you. But if you have any previous experience with Pilates don't waste your time or money.,1361836800,11,397,4.1688311688311686

8165522,5,B000M0KT68,"If you think that am sculpting circle is an easy workout, you are either very advanced in Pilates, or have never picked one up. Even with this beginner video and having not picked up my circle in a few years, it was a challenging workout. As I get stronger it will become easier to manipulate the sculpting circle, but after that it all about form, form, form and combining that with breathing and holding your core while manipulating the circle.",1459814400,12,446,4.5875
8165523,5,B000M0KT68,"When I was in my late 40's I came down with problems with sciatica. I was told by a colleague who was also a massage therapist that I needed to stretch. I researched and came across Mari Winsor and the Sculpting Circle Video. I began to do the video every other day and stretched daily. My bouts of sciatica issues disappeared, my body felt supported and I got out of bed one morning and felt as I used to when I was younger. Nothing hurt! My body felt stronger and my core was able to support my body again. This video was a godsend.",1456963200,12,534,4.144230769230769
