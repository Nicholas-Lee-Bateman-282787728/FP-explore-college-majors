At this price you have nothing to lose.  If you like Danielle Steele's books, then you'll like this movie.",1110844800,8,487,4.465909090909091

Bernie (nickname from Jane) runs into a little girl who is very lost and Bernie decide's to help her out while at the parlor her mother Liz come's to pick up her seven year old daughter Jane Calloway. Bernie and Liz unfortunely fall in love and get married (much to the liking of Jane) everything goes well cause shortly after their marriage Liz gives birth to a son but it seem's the doctor's decide that Liz has to stay in the hospital for a while and when Bernie asks why they said that she must be tested for something but they never do mention to the overly concered husband. A week later Liz is out of the hospital and with Bernie she find's out that she is a victim of the deadly disease cancer. Liz soon grows so weak that she looses her life and the long and painful journey for the young step-father Bernie has finally hit the most saddest dead end. Well Bernie's mother said since he is mostly catholic (Due to his father's raising skills) and part time Jewish that she is glad that he married such a beautiful woman with a great daughter. Bernie has no trouble at all raising Alexender and Jane all by himself then one day Bernie is told to come down to the office and when he arrives right in front of him stands Jane's biological father and Bernie believes that custody should be his because he abanded his wife and daughter the man explains that it was a mistake and it will never happen again. Bernie doesn't believe him but somehow the man gain's custody of his daughter then all the sudden Bernie hears from his agent that Jane is the middle of a drug smuggling havoc in Mexico and Bernie begs to the police that he should go with them to rescue her the police at first refuse but then standing outside a motel in Mexico the police tell Bernie over the line to come out and help. Bernie drives down to the motel and is told to hide in the truck the police wait for a good 20 minutes the agent finally has Jane out of the motel and back in her father's arms. The rest of the story is simple and all ends well so don't worry!
Why I Like It: Because it's about the most cutest Jewish-Catholic boy and his life as a father to a little girl and his realtionship with her school nurse.
Recording: The recording process (that I have been waiting and waiting for) will take place at 4:00 tomorrow Saturday, June 14 2003. I can't wait and if you really like this movie tune in to watch maybe even put it on tape if you really care for it.

1178358,5,B0000039D6,I absolutely LOVED this movie.  Such a pity that I cannot find it for purchase on VHS anywhere.  It's an all-time great in terms of a love story mixed in with real life obstacles and teeth clenching suspense.  Tracy Pollan is spectacular and made a fan of me in this film.  Please tell me it will soon be available for purchase.  I saw it on TV and want to see it again!,977875200,,370,4.083333333333333
