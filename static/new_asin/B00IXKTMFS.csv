6303719,3,B00IXKTMFS,"While this is well-produced, I'm very disappointed by how little there is of Gregg in this concert. All the clips I saw included him so I thought he was going to be singing most of the songs or doing them as duets. I really don't care a whole lot for quite a few of his ""friends"" so this show is lacking anytime Gregg's not onstage.",1484265600,2,332,4.123076923076923
6303720,5,B00IXKTMFS,Great concert put together by this music icon.  Superb performances by all participating artists. Must have if you are a Gregg Allman fan.,1479340800,,138,5.0

6303726,5,B00IXKTMFS,"If you're a Gregg Allman fan, and/or you love Southern rock, boogie and blues, you're gonna love this concert. Filmed and recorded at the Fox Theater in Atlanta it is the perfect venue as well. Several one of a kind performances, particularly by Warren Haynes. The duo with Jackson Browne is also worth the price. Gregg Allman is one of the all time greats and most likely the best white blues singer who ever lived. You will not be dissapointed.",1458000000,2,446,4.5875

6303734,1,B00IXKTMFS,"While I love the music, I have to say that the quality of this blu-ray is very poor.  I am on my 3rd blu-ray and my player will not load it.  Its odd as I have many other Blu-Rays (in many states of wear) that load consistently without issue.  Its just this one that won't load.  Its unfortunate because I have watched this concert and it is good - particularly Gregg's sets.  So, Gregg - love you, but this blu-ray is not up to standards.",1441324800,,439,4.117647058823529

6303737,4,B00IXKTMFS,"Overall it's a great disc if you're a fan of Gregg Allman's music.  My favorite songs were those he sang with Jackson Browne:  ""These Days"" and ""Melissa"".  Those alone were worth the price.  Some of the songs by Gregg's friends where he's not even onstage got a little long for me.
But after watching this disc, I bought tickets to see Gregg Allman live in Las Vegas! (October 9, 2015)",1439942400,,385,4.457142857142857

6303743,5,B00IXKTMFS,"is one of the best celebrating an artist like Gregg can get and it is an amazing concert with so many diverse musicians who all give their soul and do fire up this amazing Blu-ray, the absolute highest for me personal is the ""Whipping Post"" performance !!!",1429660800,,256,4.468085106382978

6303745,5,B00IXKTMFS,"The Blu-ray is great!  I really enjoyed this tribute show.  This is the best production of any Allman Brothers DVD. No more moogis !
Former Allman Brothers band members Jack Pearson (lead guitar) and Chuck Leavell (keyboards)  anchored the show and were  just super from start to finish.  It was all great but I think standouts were Jackson Browne, Trace Adkins,  Eric Church, Zac Brown and Vince Gill.  If you like the ABB, you have to get this DVD.  FIVE PLUS!",1426291200,,462,4.617283950617284

6303749,4,B00IXKTMFS,My only complaint is that Gregg doesn't appear until later in the show.when he does show up you can immediately hear how much better his voice sounds than anyone else on this disc.he makes them sound like amateurs.audio/video on the blu-ray is excellent. gregg and the band doing DREAMS and WHIPPING POST is awesome. Keb Mo and Susan Tedeschi are very good too. Worth the money.,1423958400,,378,4.742424242424242

6303755,3,B00IXKTMFS,"I loved and followed the AB and Gregg A in the late sixties and until ""Brothers and Sisters,"" then we sort of parted company. I WANTED to love this thing with all 5 stars.  I had just finished reading Galadriel Allman's beautiful book about her dad, and last year had read Randy Poe's ""Skydog.""

What a disappointment this mess is!!

For starters, pardon my ignorance as I do not follow the gossip about musicians, but where was Dickey Betts?

Some names were new to me, among them Sam Moore, Brantley Gilbert, Pat Monahan, Trace Adkins, Martina Mcbride, and Eric Church, so I guess I am not really up on the ""scene"" vis a vis Gregg A's milieu.

I had never seen drummer Kenny Aronoff perform:  WOW!!  Also, incredible guitar by one of the backing band, Jack Pearson....he really held this thing together.  Don Was is legendary of course, but again I had never seen him perform.  Very solid.  Chuck Leavell is a treasure.

People who should have stayed home:  Brantley Gilbert, Trace Adkins, Pat Monahan, and Martina Mcbride.  They brought nothing but useless posings to this affair.  The last two especially.....their best hope is karaoke.  Dr. John was practically comatose.  Incredible energy as always with the incendiary Robert Randolph, et al.  Electric moment!  Taj Mahal, may he live forever!!

And now to the main villain in all of this:  the unforgiveably HORRIBLE sound!!  I watched it via my klipsch surround-sound system powered by my denon amp and 5.1 surround-sound....a solid combination which can bring out the best - and worst - of most videos.  Both the separation and levels were uniformly terrible.  The McCrary's, backup singers, may as well have stayed home.  This was especially noticeable in the AB numbers near the end.....Hayne's guitar sounded like he was in another room, while Truck's guitar came across fully.  As I watched the whole thing a second time, just in case my mood or something was off the first time, it was just as noticeable.  Lousy.

I see on this page I can sell this thing for $5.....might just do it!!  What a damn shame....",1419292800,2,2073,4.796033994334278

6303786,4,B00IXKTMFS,"Okay, I'm a huge Gregg Allman fan, ABB fan, and many other bands.  This is well worth the money, but there are some artists on here that I would have second thoughts about ""doing"" a Gregg Allman song.  I'll let you be the judge of who should not have been on the compilation.  I have to give credit to Jack Pearson on guitar, Kenny Aronoff on drums, and Chuck Leavell on keyboards - they are awesome.  My personal favorites are Keb Mo' doing Just Anther Rider, Stand Back by Susan Tedeschi and Derek Trucks, and Jackson Browne and Gregg on These Days and Melissa.  I would have given it 5 stars, but there are more than a couple performers that seemed a little ""out of place""...",1403654400,13,678,4.349206349206349
6303787,4,B00IXKTMFS,"I enjoyed this very much. The picture and sound was wonderful. I'm not gonna get into the music because no one is gonna like every artist or performance and everyone's taste in music differs. So if you like Greggory and some of the listed artist, this is probably a safe purchase.

I gave it only 4 stars because of the lack of bonus material. I would have liked to have some interviews and perhaps some backstage footage..",1402876800,,423,4.4935064935064934
6303788,5,B00IXKTMFS,"This is the DVD of a tribute show in Atlanta on Jan. 6, 2014. I was fortunate to attend this amazing concert. Now, I can watch it again and again. Some of the musicians who sang Gregg Allman's songs were: Taj Mahal, Martina McBride, Jackson Brown, John Hiatt, Keb' Mo', Widespread Panic and the Allman Brothers Band. Trace Atkins did a killer version of, ""I'm No Angel"". A trio of Vince Gill, Zac Brown and Gregg Allman was fabulous on ""midnight Rider""! The musicians who were playing through the whole show: Chuck Leavell on keyboards, Jimmy Hall on mouth harp and Jack Pearson on guitar! I am a big Gregg Allman fan and this tribute was well-deserved!",1402790400,7,653,4.589743589743589
6303789,5,B00IXKTMFS,"As always, not every musician they wanted was likely available, but the lineup they got was great! Even the basic backup band, that featured old ABB friends Chuck Leavell and Jack Pearson, was well worth seeing! What a treat to have big names such as Vince Gill and Jackson Browne along.

I thought the music sounded great, the video editing was on target and it was a really nice production all the way around. Gregg is one of my all time favorite artists and this was such a fitting tribute to his life and career!",1402272000,2,516,4.431578947368421
