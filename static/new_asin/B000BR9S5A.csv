8091344,5,B000BR9S5A,"a wild ride for the anime buff. A laugh roit. But be warn, it not for kids. Adults only, mature themes.",1360022400,,103,3.9523809523809526
8091345,3,B000BR9S5A,"The series remains cute but with only a few episodes left, it seems that they had one final spurt of... let's call it creativity that the staff felt the need to get out. The first three episodes are entertaining in their own way I suppose but the few seconds of foreshadowing in each one do not make them any more worth watching than they would be otherwise and so you can completely get away with just watching the last episode to set yourself up for the series finale. I won't be sorry to see this one end but with over twenty episodes of build up so far, I would be lying if I said I weren't the least bit curious about how they plan on wrapping it all up.",1213747200,,659,4.116279069767442
8091346,5,B000BR9S5A,"This series is hilarious.  This DVD is one of the best in the series.  Sometimes childish in its humor, but lots of belly laughs.",1152835200,2,129,4.333333333333333
