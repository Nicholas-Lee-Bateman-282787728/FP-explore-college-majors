7588173,5,B01A3FEXNG,"In this two hour treasure trove of insightful dot-connecting, rare /secret archival footage, candid interviewees, bold storytelling technique, exceptional cinematography, and energizing music, director Jacob leads us on a highly intuitive and daringly poetic adventure. 'Packing for Mars' is an essential piece for any serious student of the global space /mind control program.",1462838400,2,377,6.132075471698113
7588174,5,B01A3FEXNG,"I watched the film twice in total silence. What a masterpiece of Consciousness and skill intertwined! This is a very tricky subject to expose and I feel that the filmmakers did it extremely well. Every aspect was impeccable, and I say this as an experienced filmmaker. The movie left me in awe! It's a must see for everyone with an open mind!",1462838400,3,342,4.532258064516129
7588175,5,B01A3FEXNG,A stunning motion picture documentary that really gets you thinking! A top quality production that deserves to be seen on the big screen. The film takes you on a journey around the world and across the solar system providing an insight into what is really going on. Includes footage never seen before supported by credible scientists and researchers. There's so much to take in I've watched the film several times now. One of the best motion picture documentaries of this genre I have seen in years.,1462838400,3,499,4.813953488372093
7588176,2,B01A3FEXNG,"I can't comment on the contents of this documentary, as I was unable to finish it. The sound mix was so poor that it was very difficult, and sometimes almost impossible, to hear the voice-over and interviews over the music. I tried various volume settings, all the way up to max, on good quality equipment, but was unable to find a volume that was not a great strain to listen to. Even turned up to the point of distortion, much of it was unintelligible to my ear. Add in the fact that there were no subtitles, and that some of the interview subjects spoke with heavy accents, and it made for a very unenjoyable viewing experience. I learned in film school that an audience will forgive all sorts of poor quality picture as long as they can hear the soundtrack, but they will not forgive poor quality sound. This is, unfortunately, an example of the latter.",1462320000,2,857,4.5

7588178,5,B01A3FEXNG,"Wow!  These film makers have a real talent for blowing my mind!  ""Packing for Mars"" is amazing in that it answers a lot of questions about ""why"" things are happening!  It's everything a documentary should be: intriguing, understandable, convincing, thought-provoking, and entertaining.  But, it's also poetic and visually captivating. Watch it on a big screen! And open your mind to the secrets... Major kudos!",1456358400,2,410,5.359375
7588179,5,B01A3FEXNG,"Mind officially blown...many details i've never seen or heard before. The Screen Addiction team gathered personal accounts across the country from numerous eyewitnesses, connecting all the dots that after years of personal research I was unable to do. This film lays it all out with regards to secret Mars and Moon bases, Tesla's suppressed teleportation technology, governmental coverups and more. Instead of fear mongering, the producers present the facts in a clear, thought provoking and fast paced manner. It's a film that awakens and empowers citizens with information that has been suppressed for generations by governments fearful of losing their control over the masses. This movie NEEDS to be on the big screens across the US and the world!",1456099200,6,750,5.310924369747899
7588180,5,B01A3FEXNG,I thoroughly enjoyed it!,1475798400,,24,5.25
7588181,5,B01A3FEXNG,Very interesting movie (if your into this kind of topic) Makes a person with an open mind wonder what's really going on behind the scenes with our govt.,1474761600,,152,4.464285714285714
7588182,3,B01A3FEXNG,I was very disappointed and I am generous with 3 stars.  This film is not scientific enough for me.  After it started I felt like lighting up a joint and taking a trip.  The music is great (for lighting up) but sometimes to loud and over whelming.  I could not here the narrator.  The man who made this film put himself into the film too many times.  I found that unnecessary.  I found it hard to follow as well.,1474588800,2,412,4.139240506329114
7588183,2,B01A3FEXNG,"For such an incredibly important subject, this was sadly Not a powerful presentation on any level.  I have for years been intensively studying, researching, and supporting disclosure of the secret space program....and more recently have been closely & intensively examining raw images released by NASA from the Mars Rovers, along with so many others who have expertise to share about doing this without CGI or Photoshop that others use to fake the images.  All of that readily available evidence alone is enough for developing documentaries that would be so absolutely fantastic and mind-blowing, that no further ""production"" would be necessary to get the truth clearly and easily available.

Frank Jacobs has IMO sadly tried too hard to mix ""artful filming"" with an effort to make a strong impact, and absolutely failed in a Big way, on both counts.  Too much ocean & new wave atmosphere shots, and street walks, and useless film.

Just in the basics, the film has terrible sound, with mediocre music horribly overpowering the message all the way through.  I found myself wanting to shut off the music (if that were possible) because it was so horribly distracting and too loud for the narration--but you can't..  Really cheezy result.

The most incredible part of the basic production failure is that you cannot pause the video without going all the way back to the beginning, and have NO WAY to get back to where you were, without being thrown back to the beginning and running it in real time from about 5  minutes into the film or in huge segments that are really unusable as ""chapters.""  Unbelievable.  The technology has been around for an awfully long time to have made this DVD Much more user-friendly!

I will not go further, other than to say that sadly---really sadly, Frank's audio interviews are much more impactful and impressive with content than this pitiful video attempt will ever be.  I hope he steers clear of producing videos, or greatly improves his skills before attempting what I consider to be such an important endeavor in the future.  I truly wish I had not spent the money.  It was twice as much as I have ever paid for any DVD I felt to be really important, and it was worth less than any of those.  Please, Frank.  Stick to research and audio interviews if you have substance to offer on this subject matter!",1472601600,3,2339,4.8075

7588187,5,B01A3FEXNG,"This documentary is both thought provoking and compelling.  The production values were top notch and it was presented in a way that captures your interest from beginning to end.  I watched it almost the same way I would watch the landing of a flying saucer. It definitely grabs you and I would recommend it to a friend even if he/she wasn't that interested in the topic as I am certain that you will equally enjoy their reactions as much as you did upon first viewing.
Wonderful uplifting movie. HIGHLY recommended!!",1463097600,5,516,4.722222222222222
7588188,5,B01A3FEXNG,"I can't stress the importance of this film enough. This is one of the most powerful and eye opening documentaries ever made.  For those of you who have no background information on the secret space program, this will bring you closer to the shocking truth.  Be brave and open your eyes because there is more information to support most claims made in this film.  So get your popcorn and an extra clean pair of underwear ready.........You just might need them.
GREAT FILM",1462924800,5,470,4.7073170731707314
7588189,5,B01A3FEXNG,I loved it!  Great documentary and very interesting!  There is so much that is being kept from the masses and this film is an eye opener!,1462838400,,137,4.230769230769231

8746441,4,B01A3FEXNG,"I was able to watch this film on AMAZON PRIME and I found it to be informative. I have seen several other segments on this very topic and found this one to report the same information on this subject from different sources. If there is any truth to these claims I believe it is time for disclosure, if it wasn't time to tell all we wouldn't watching these types of documentaries to find out...now would we.",1523836800,,406,4.355263157894737

8746443,5,B01A3FEXNG,"I just finished watching this film. by Frank Jacob. I found it extremely well done and very timely. I have researched many of the anomalies of this planet for over 40 years and I can assure you that he has given you first hand experiences with the artifacts and key players in each of the stories,  These concise reports are well done brief synopsis' of many of these global anomalies. For those who have not done any research into the anomalies of earth's civilizations or the many, many strange artifacts that have been found and reported globally; Read the books of Charles Fort, Michael R Corliss, and Michael Cremo and you will see that what we have been taught about our early civilization's history is far from complete. Frank's search and his concise and exact reporting on these findings is excellent. And it then allows the viewer to follow-up and expand one's knowledge and the relationship of the stories  farther.. We are learning now a great deal about what we have not been told , for a long time, about what has been and is really going on around us. Start reading and researching and you will begin to  see. Frank has and he gives you a magnificent concise and beautiful presentation. Everyone should see this presentation and realize that there is a huge mass of truth here. And just because you haven't seen it on the evening news does not mean that it is false. The artifacts are real; the reports are real; the technology is real; and the witnesses are real. View this movie and learn from it because  your going to look pretty stupid when you see it bigger than life, on the evening news.",1501286400,,1610,4.579861111111111
8746444,5,B01A3FEXNG,"Brilliantly written and directed - cogent, concise and easily digested.  The Director deftly covers the most important issues/questions in our modern world; however, he doesn't Sell, he simply Tells the story, allowing the audience to come to its own conclusions.  A must see for seekers of truth that can't find guidance via main stream media.  Thought provoking without being aggressive or preaching.  Definitely worth seeing!",1501113600,,428,5.538461538461538

I especially loved all the interviews and the journey Frank takes us on. I've watched it 3 times now and every time I find something I missed. Packing for Mars is packed with vital information for every spiritual seeker.,1479772800,2,340,5.089285714285714
