8097643,5,B000CCSFVM,"The Complete Superman Collection consists of the following films.

1. Superman: The Movie is the best movie about the caped crusader hero. It combines drama,humor,tension and suspense in one complete package. Aside from that,the casting was perfect from Marlon Brando as Jor-El,Gene Hackman as Lex Luthor,Margot Kidder as Lois Lane and of course,Christopher Reeve ,who turned out an iconic performance as the both the bumbling Clark Kent and the hero,Superman. Aside from the adventures of the superhero,it also gives us an idea of his character,humanity and his vulnerability. In summary,this movie is a timeless delight.

2. Superman II:The Richard Donner Cut would have been an epic if it was completed. After viewing this film,it was definitely a lot better and more dramatic than that was released theatrically back in 1980. Lois Lane was more clever in catching that Clark Kent is Superman. Marlon Brando's presence elevated the film into new heights. Aside from that,there was less comical scenes which turned the original Superman II some sort of a slapstick comedy. Also,the existence of the Supervillains were fully explained as well. With regards to the actors involved,we can see that they are more energized with Donner than with Lester especially those who did re- shoots like Reeve,Kidder and Stamp. Finally,the plot was less predictable and clichd as compared to Lester's theatrical version. Overall,it would have been the better movie had it been completed that would probably hold a candle to the first Superman movie and I give this one a perfect rating inspite of its not being finished as well.

3. Superman III turned into becoming a different film compared to Superman:The Movie and Superman II:The Richard Donner's Cut for it became a comedic film especially with Richard Pryor's presence. Aside from that,Vaughn's villainous portrayal of Ross Webster was an uninspired fill-in for Lex Luthor or the Supervillains. Of course,the big blame goes for Richard Lester,a director who more into comedy rather adventure films like Superman. It would have been better that they have retained Richard Donner for the Superman franchise,who could have done a better job with it. Added to that,the absence of Gene Hackman and the near-absence of Margot Kidder,who was limited to 5 minutes of screen time by Salkinds for expressing her disgust on the firing of Donner,proved disastrous to the film. Obviously,the love story between Lana Lang and Clark Kent isn't as interesting as compared to Lois Lane and Superman/Clark Kent after what they have gone through in the first two films. The only good thing about it is the performance of Christopher Reeve,who proved himself to be have great acting skills when portraying the good and evil Superman. Overall,if you are looking for some laughs,the Superman III is the film to watch!!!

4. Superman IV:The Quest For Peace is the least interesting of the four Superman movies done by Christopher Reeve. If the first two films were a classic and Superman III was entertaining enough for good laughs,the fourth film was definitely horrible. The performances of the cast were simply decent. Christopher Reeve does not look to be in top shape as the Man of Steel and he looks tired as Superman and Clark Kent,who was relegated from a bumbling man to a dork in this film. Aside from that,the other cast like Hackman and Kidder look uninspired in their portrayal as Lex Luthor and Lois Lane respectively. The others gave average performances. As for the story,the movie was definitely predictable from beginning to end. Nuclear Man was simply a horrible villain and the least interesting as compared to the Supervillains,the evil Superman and even Gus Gorman. In summary,the action is boring. The special effects look cheaper. And most of all,nobody appears interested in where the story is going. Sidney J. Furie's direction simply is lackluster.

This collection of Superman films will definitely be enjoyed by many fans of the caped crusader especially those who like Christopher Reeve from the best one - Superman:The Movie - to the least favorite one - Superman Iv:The Quest For Peace.",1414108800,,4139,5.162444113263786
