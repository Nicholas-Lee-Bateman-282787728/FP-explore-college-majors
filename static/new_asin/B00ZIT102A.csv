7283017,1,B00ZIT102A,"Horrible movie. The outright unbelievable storyline has more holes than Swiss cheese.
All for a 200 million score from robbing 10 banks at one time... And to do it they will basically take over the 911 system and divert one pair of cops that will allow all this to happen.
Here is a fact that shouldn't get in the way... No local bank has 20 million in cash on hand in the first place, so never mind 10 local banks all within one section of town that is all controlled by one 911 operator alone!!!
And there are about a dozen more equally stupid impossibilities.
Like the pair of cops are first involved in an accident... Leave that scene. Then take another pair of cops to another scene where one of those cops dies. Are allowed to leave that scene.... To go to another place to shoot a suspect and somehow leave that scene too... I mean are there no captains anywhere in that department at all?

After watching this DVD I threw it away so I never mistakenly watch it ever again.
Better off watching a good movie for the 50th time then this POS for the first.",1448668800,,1060,4.326633165829146
7283018,1,B00ZIT102A,"This is the worst movie i've ever seen in my life. The action scenes could have not looked more fake. I have wasted time and money on this movie, and I would suggest not wasting yours either.",1448064000,,191,4.1891891891891895

7283021,2,B00ZIT102A,"The film opens with clumsy burglars and a fire. Young Cassie (Riley Bundick) survives the fire, but mom, dispatch operator Pamela (Mischa Barton) is ""crazy mad"" at dad, Officer Jeremy Miller (Luke Goss) for leaving her alone at home. They are now separated. At work Pamela receives 911 phone calls from Ving Rhames who instructs her to send her husband all over Atlanta where accidents happen after he arrives.

We really don't know why this is happening and even after we find out, it still didn't make a lot of sense to create diversions in this manner. We have seen similar style stories and for the most part, they were better. For some reason we have to add Jeremy is 5 months sober, even though it never factored into the film. Apparently rehab is the latest vogue aspect in Hollywood films. We have gone from drinking and smoking cigarettes is sexy and cool to non-smokers in a 12 point program.

Guide: F-bomb. No sex or nudity.  Go watch 12 Rounds 2 instead.",1445126400,,967,4.6104651162790695
7283022,2,B00ZIT102A,"Cross Halle Barry's 911 operator thriller The Caller with 12 Rounds and you get Operator, a lackluster straight-to-video thriller about a 911 operator's day from hell as her daughter is kidnapped and she is forced to follow a mysterious caller's series of instructions in order to keep her alive.  The instructions involve sending a police car with her ex and his partner to a series of crime scene moments before a crime actually occurs.  Eventually, it becomes apparent (just like in 12 Rounds) that the calls are a smokescreen meant to distract from a completely different, much larger crime.

Sending one police car careening around the city isn't really the distraction the filmmakers seem to think it is--this would have made a lot more sense if the individual crimes were more showy and more police were involved than the single car.  A late movie twist concerning the identity of the man-on-the-phone is pretty ridiculous and sloppy in terms of storytelling----there's a half-hearted attempt to frame someone for the crimes, but that wouldn't survive even the most basic investigation since the real culprits kill someone while she is in police custody and also attempt to flee, so apparently that's just another distraction as well--which pretty much sums up Operator as well which tries (in vain) to be flashy enough to distract from how idiotic everything that's going on actually is.

The directors (brothers Amariah and Obin Olsen) stage a couple of surprisingly effective action sequences for a straight-to-video film, but a much better script would be needed to determine if these guys are actually talented or not--Operator's lazy lifts from The Caller and especially 12 Rounds, and this makes the original 12 Rounds which was a 3rd rate Die Hard 3 knock-off look like a classic in comparison, pretty much make it impossible for the movie to be anything other than mediocre, although if you are already in the habit of watching lousy straight-to-video action thrillers then Operator might actually feel a tad above average.  It's certainly not much worse than straight-to-video sequels to The Marine, 12 Rounds, and Death Race--although that's pretty praise at best.  Operator might be diverting enough if you are too tired and lazy to turn on something else, but it's not a movie you're likely to remember much about the following morning.",1444089600,,2356,5.0880829015544045
