8073320,1,B000A2W9IE,"I've only seen 1 movie and it was so bad and I'm not sure I want to try another.  At this point I give it a big thumbs down.  The story line was terrible.  There were lots of scenes that made no sense and scenes bounced from one to another with questions like, ""what just happened -- why is that guy without a horse all of a sudden, etc.""  I will probably donate this series to Goodwill.",1388966400,2,387,3.987012987012987
