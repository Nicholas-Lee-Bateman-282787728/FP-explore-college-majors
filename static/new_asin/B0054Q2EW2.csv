8456839,3,B0054Q2EW2,"The name of this Video should be Basic AR-15 Tactics because the AR-15 is the Rife that the training was about . If you are Military or Law Enforcement you know these basic moves already. Nothing really advanced about what is presented in this Video..  If you are like me, some moves shown here you might not even agree with.
 I know I might sound a little too critical as this is an instructional  Video, but  could have been better with better scenery and back ground. etc.  Better angles etc..  It is Filmed in 4:3  The Video Quality is ok.
 It  appeared  to me that one of the instructors was not all that great speaking on Camera and getting his words jumbled.. Including  a little Humor is always a good thing I think.. Nothing humorous included here.
  All in all some good points and review.  If you have no training at all and are just figuring out the difference between a Turbine and an AR-15 Carbine this video can help you.",1410566400,,936,4.39766081871345
