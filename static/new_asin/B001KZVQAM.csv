8316754,5,B001KZVQAM,This is a good geniune real bio of the President. He tells his own story verbally to David Frost. He is a gentle warm soft spoken humble person. He will be remembered in history as one of the best President we ever had( not as great as Lincoln or Washington).  I recommend this to everyone to see.,1307404800,,297,4.2105263157894735
