4533851,3,B0053GJ77I,This was just an ok movie.  The story line lacked and was alittle stale.  The only good thing about this was Matthew Montgomery which the movie was worth getting for fans of his.,1320883200,,178,4.363636363636363
4533852,1,B0053GJ77I,"This movie is slow, boring and predictable. The acting is not great, except for Rebekah Kochan of course, love her, she should be A-list. What I found funny is how they called Matthew Montgomery, whose acting is not bad, a hot guy. This is not a porno of course, but again, since the story line is boring, you would at least want the lead character to be a good looking guy. Other movies Matthew was in were more captivating so his looks didn't matter (to me). If this movie gets any good reviews, it is only thanks to Rebekah, gotta love her! Of course you don't have to agree with me, so form your own opinion and respect other's.",1320796800,4,632,4.319327731092437
4533853,2,B0053GJ77I,"i usually love these actors, so I bought the movie.  I really wish I hadn't.  There was just no ""fun"", just really boring.  find Mr. Wright could have been so good but it was just ... just.",1318464000,5,189,4.054054054054054
4533854,3,B0053GJ77I,"Finding Mr. Wright is a typical romantic-comedy, predictable yet sweet. I am a fan of Rebecca Kochan's, and while it was great seeing her in this movie, she isn't given near as much fun things to do here as in the Eating Out series. I now have a crush on David Moretti, who plays Pierce in Finding Mr. Wright. I had already seen him in The Lair, but here he is playing a really good character and his acting has improved. Also, he is so sexy and dreamy while wearing those glasses! And I like his hair, too! Anyway, Finding Mr. Wright is worth watching if you like romantic-comedies. I was just hoping that it would have been funnier, and a David Moretti butt shot wouldn't have hurt.",1315872000,7,684,4.3515625
4533855,4,B0053GJ77I,"Clark Townsend (Matthew Montgomery) is a talent agent, whose most time-consuming client (also his best friend) is actress Eddy Malone (Rebekah Kochan, most would remember primarily from the ""Eating Out..."" videos), whose self-destructive partying is threatening to end her career before it really gets established.  The time and efforts Clark puts into keeping Eddy out of trouble cost him any chance of a social life of his own, and he has long ago burned out on the guys he meets there in West Hollywood.  At a party of business associates, Eddy's feisty lesbian publicist, TJ, brings along her gay buddy Pearce Wright (David Moretti, who was featured in the made-for-gay-cable series ""The Lair""), who takes an immediate interest in Clark, although Clark is obviously closed off to such possibilities.  A life coach who specializes in helping his clients adopt a more healthy and productive lifestyle. Pearce suggests that Eddy would benefit from a ""wilderness therapy weekend"" ... and everyone ends up going, including Clark's ex and his fledgling porn star new boyfriend, who immediately aim their sights on Pearce and Clark, respectively.  It's a strange weekend, looking for love and new beginnings, while dealing with lots of old baggage that just won't let go.

Directed and produced by Nancy Criss, who has a lot of experience in television, this film has a ""sitcom"" feel to it, not necessarily a bad thing, but don't expect groundbreaking cinema.  To her credit, she does a commendable job with a rather complex story with many character interactions, and gets a credible performance out of the main actors. A bit uneven in parts, some very minor sound problems, but otherwise an amusing and enjoyable diversion, appropriate even for a mixed gay/straight gathering.  There are no DVD extras except two versions of the trailer, and the film is unrated (PG would likely suffice, as there is no full nudity or simulated sex.)  I give it four stars out of five.",1314835200,13,1967,5.049382716049383

I bet you already know how it's going to end.  (Which might be the best reason for actually watching it - a little mind numbing ""romance"" is sometimes called for if only it were a better movie).

For me I just didn't connect with the film, I watched till end hoping that ""love is the answer"" was not once again not going to be trotted out as the fairy tale resolution.

 This movie could have been great if you concentrated on the blossoming love story.
 Instead we also have to follow sex-crazed characters jumping from bed to bed. Can't forget the character who wants everyone to roll on E. Such a cliche.
 Then you have to have the crazy butch-like Lesbian. While the acting wasn't great; their was much more potential.

Just like in all his other movies, he huffs & puffs, sighs, rolls his eyes, shakes his head and shrugs his shoulders. The world only exists to annoy him. The rest of the cast consists of stereotypical peripheral characters;
A self centered bleach blond (with dark roots) best friend who abuses alcohol, and whines a lot,
A transexual who seems to think that being a real woman consists of a blonde wig, too much makeup and drag outfits.
A too good to be true nerdy guy with glasses, and 6pack abs.
A lesbian, you can tell she's a lesbian because her hair is short and she's angry all the time.
And a couple of other guys who I don't even know why they're in this movie.
I think any of these characters could be pulled from this movie, dropped into any of Montgomery's other movies, and no one would be any more the wiser.",1475366400,2,888,4.387878787878788

4533915,1,B0053GJ77I,"I just finished watching this movie and felt I had to review it immediately or else I'd completely forget everything about it.  Now, I'm hoping I WILL completely forget everything about it, as it was that bad.  I always roll my eyes when I read the 4 and 5 star reviews of such an awful film as this one is..  I continuously come to the conclusion that EVERYONE who was a part of making this movie begged their families and friends to go on Amazon and write a positive review.

Truthfully, going in, I really wanted to like this movie but unfortunately it was awful in every single aspect.  The writing was dreadful, with ultra-stereotypical, morose, undeveloped characters, language offensive for an LGBT film (use of the word ""tranny""?  Ugh!).  The plot is like a ramshackle road trip and lines that are not funny but instead awful one-liners, condescending anecdotes and overly used innuendo .

The acting was wooden, uninspired and phony - definitely below subpar.  At times it seemed like some of the supporting characters were delivering their lines from cue cards and ""effectively emote"" are two words not in any of these players' vocabulary or skill set.  I've come to the conclusion that Matthew Montgomery and Rebekkah Kochon are, indeed, one-note performers.  That becomes grating in movie after movie.

The direction was all over the place, never put forth a point of view and failed to string together the tired, unfunny vignettes into a cohesive whole.  The director, Nancy Criss, should absolutely NOT quit her day job.  As for production values, a heads up - THERE AREN'T ANY! Case in point - more than half of the movie is supposed to take place on a ""wilderness weekend retreat"" but more than 98% of that part is filmed INDOORS in a cramped, pseudo-cabin.  And the only outdoor bits look as though they're filmed in a small piece of hilly suburban L.A.

All in all, don't waste your time with this movie - unless you can appreciate the fine art of horrendous movie making.",1472169600,2,1990,4.741279069767442

The movie is about 30 minutes too long, in my opinion.  There were extraneous scenes (not to mention characters) that felt like padding.  Goldie, Gage and TJ could have been eliminated or reduced as well as the strip poker scene.  This is usually the trouble with filmmakers that write, direct and edit their own material.  Sometimes they are too close to the project to make informed decisions and make the film better.  I was getting to what felt like the natural end of the film and there was still 25 minutes left!  I love David Moretti in the few things I have seen him in and Rebekah Kochan is a fresh comedic talent that needs to get more work.  I'm iffy on Matthew Montgomery.

There are ex-partners, a gay porn star who wants to bed the main character, a movie star who is a spoiled brat, an anal-retentive agent, and the two main characters...a success-driven talent scout/agent and a psychologist (whose parents were also psychologists).  Clarke (talent agent) thinks he is too busy to have a relationship.  Pearce likes Clarke, but is having trouble getting Clarke to open up.  Finally Clarke realizes that he needs someone in his life, and can have both a career and a love life.  The touching bonding at the mountain retreat at the end of the movie is what love is all about.",1385510400,3,684,4.666666666666667

Over protective and work obsessed film talent agent tries to shepherd his cigarette smoking, hard drinking actress client who is always screwing up. They go away for a mountain retreat with friends, ex-lovers, and a life coach to repair her career and the life coach and the main character play avoidance/flirtation games all weekend. However, the acting was poor, the directing poor, the camera work poor. This film is like an amateur attempt by novice film makers to create a gay love story but the characterizations get in the way, the poor script seems to go nowhere, and the production values are lacking. My partner and I laughed at it, not with, as one trite scene after another came on screen. The Day for Night scenes were soooo bad. We did like the dog however.

4533955,3,B0053GJ77I,"I bought Finding Mr Wright purely because of Rebekah Kochan. I think she's a great actress and comedian. I watched the film yesterday and found it to be a decent romantic comedy about a man who puts the need to be needed above his own need to need someone else.

The cast were all great in the roles, although about three quarters of the way through the film I couldn't for the life of me figure out why Gage and Pierce were both in love with Clarke. Frankly I was hoping they'd hook up. I found the character of Clarke to be annoying and self-obsessed.

Finding Mr Wright is a good movie that is an easy way to spend a couple of hours of an afternoon watching. The supporting characters, rather than main love story were what held my attention. For me this film was all about the star turn of Rebekah Kochan and I really hope to see her in many more films.

Montgomery is as handsome as he is talented, and no two performances are EVER the same.  Kochan is as lovely as she is funny, and while many of her roles have been similar, who can fault a casting director for putting her in a movie that calls for a beautiful blonde with strong comedic timing and with a willingness to look ridiculous for the sake of the role?  Is this movie deep and meaningful?  No. Is it good and escapist entertainment?  Oh, yeah, it is.",1355961600,8,566,4.564356435643564

It is the first gay movie that I have ever watched and I was really impressed with the writer's ability  to convey a very sweet almost innocent love between two men.  The characters were very down to earth and some of them hilarious.  It is hard to decide which one was my favorite.  There were parts that had me laughing out loud and parts that made me tear up.  If you are looking for a steamy gay movie, this is not the one for you.  But if you have a gay son and want to connect with his real world, this movie with make you feel more comfortable about the life ahead of him.  It leaves you with the feeling that the love in a gay relationship is not any different than the love between two decent straight people.  Like I said, it's the first gay movie for me and I was totally impressed.  I hope this writer writes more movies like this for gay people as well as straight.",1332633600,3,945,4.171270718232044

The story line could have worked except for the horrendous acting and the horrendous directing.  There isn't one actor who I made an emotional attachment to.  Many times ts seemed like they were just trying to remember their lines.  Apparently the director, Nancy Criss, thought Montgomery had some special quality about talking on the phone.  He is terrible at it.  Check out Bob Newhart if you want to see a real actor talking on a phone can do.  There was one scene when Montgomery's phone rang and you could tell he was just hiding around the corner and he pops out clumsily to answer the phone.  Terrible acting.  The movie was shot in a beautiful setting but you really wouldnt know it.  The beauty of the outdoors was wasted and neglected.  So if you are looking for a good Saturday night movie to watch, start streaming this movie then leave the house and find a real movie in a theater to go see.
