8412259,5,B002LZAZW0,This is one of the best instructional kite videos I've seen.  This doesn't go into the very basic details of kiting like setting up and basic riding but is excellent for the intermediate to advanced rider looking to do more tricks.  Kristen style is super smooth and the video does a really good job of breaking down each move without boring the viewer to death.  Great Video that I highly recommend!,1347667200,2,400,4.605633802816901
8412260,4,B002LZAZW0,"This is a good overview and review of beginning to advanced kitesurfing all in a single DVD.  It is not as in-depth as the Progression series, but offers good value if you don't want to purchase the more expensive series.",1299542400,2,221,4.525
