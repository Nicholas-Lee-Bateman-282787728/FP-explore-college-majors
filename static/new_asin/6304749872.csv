7877842,5,6304749872,"If you enjoy listening to music sung extremely well then you should buy the Petula Clark Spectacular.
Criticism can be levelled at there being only a medley of songs during the first part of the show but that is subjective, because I personally like the first part of the show the most, as one song effortlessly glides into the next producing a tremendous sense of pace and liveliness. Also a favourite part is a segment which includes, ""Elusive Butterfly"", ""Imagine"", ""Come Rain Or Come Shine"" and ending with, ""Just Say Goodbye"".  Here in particular you witness the power and fulness of Petula's voice. She really is a great singer with a voice of very pleasing tibre. She was John Lennon's favorite singer no less. The only other note of criticism is not showing Petula singing a full version of  Downtown at the end.  Perhaps there were contractual reasons for that.
The guest in the show is Harry Belefonte.  Harry and Petula made TV history when she grasped his arm during the duet of ""Path Of Glory"". That was seen by some as quite controversial in 1968.
Typical for the time there is quite a lot of dancing by the dancers on set. I don't think dancing is Petula Clark's forte, but she manages well enough. The dancing is entertainment in itself. Watch out for the comic element involving the guys and the gal.  An added bonus is that the video retains the original sponsor advertisements.
The sound reproduction is to to be noted, for it is excellent. I believe the show received praise ,if not awards at the time for the quality of the sound recording.
I am a Petula Clark fan, but I believe this show is required watching for any music lover, the songs and the singing transcend time.  A good  song and a great singer will always be that.  The whole show exudes quality and care in the making.",1025654400,2,1803,4.577639751552795
7877843,5,6304749872,"I remember seeing this when it was first broadcast on television and thinking how incredible it was, even though I was just a teen. Now that I am an adult, and have purchased this video, I am amazed at the quality of the production. I love the different scenes.. the medleys of songs..how each scene segues into another so smoothly. My favourite, however,is ""We Can Work It Out"". Beautifully done and far ahead of it's time with social commentary. And the close-ups of Petula....amazing! All in all it truly is a Spectacular!",998265600,4,525,4.717391304347826
7877844,3,6304749872,"I am a big fan of Petula Clark's and was looking forward immensely to watching this video. What a dissapointment! With the possible exception of her duet with Mr. Belafonte, they don't show her singing a SINGLE FULL song! Some of my favorite songs, just as she got into them, they'd cut her off and she'd start singing something else. And when she finally got to Don't Sleep in the Subway, the one that was really going to be like a dream come true to see her sing, she sings the FIRST VERSE and then stops! ""You try to be smart..but you take it to heart.."" All I wanted out of the whole video was to see her utter those words! And she stopped the song before she got to the second half of it. And then, what's more, at the end when they FINALLY get to Downtown, Pet's 1965 crowning achievement, that maybe could have salvaged the experience for me, you know what they do? They have the CREDITS roll over her face so you can't even see her as she sings it! If I just wanted to hear the song, I could play my CD. I wanted to see HER singing it! Couldn't the editors at least had enough dignity to let us see her FACE as she sung her signature song? Don't get me wrong, it was wonderful to see the first lady of the British Invasion singing, but the ommisions almost made it not worth it for me!",988761600,3,1293,4.134920634920635
7877845,5,6304749872,"I remember this show, but I would like to say that this was not the first time two people of different races touched. I saw a Dean Martin show where Lena Horne was the guest and they held hands. This show was in the early 60's.",982627200,,227,3.9565217391304346
7877846,5,6304749872,"Little did Petula Clark realize when she innocently set her hand down on  guest Harry Belafonte's arm during a duet in ""Petula"", her April  2, 1968 NBC-TV special, that she was at that moment making U.S. television  history.  Never before had two persons of different races touched on TV . .  . and both NBC and the show's sponsor, Chrysler, were aghast at the  possibility of losing viewers because of it.  Petula, shocked at the  uproar, ordered husband (and the show's producer) Claude Wolff to destroy  all other takes of the number, and it was delivered to the network with the  touch intact just days before the scheduled airing.  The program drew rave  reviews and among the highest ratings that season.
If it was a publicity  stunt to guarantee viewership, it wasn't necessary.  Petula Clark in her  American debut special is superb, her voice rich and pure as she tackles  both hit material, old standards, and everything in-between.  From the  opening strains of ""Music"" to the final notes of  ""Downtown"", Clark is fresh, bright, and stunning.  Highlights  include ""Come Rain or Come Shine"", ""Just Say Good-bye"",  and the entire opening sequence which features the star in a series of  costume changes and dance routines in search of an answer to her plaintive  hit, ""Who Am I?""  And of course, the ""infamous"" duet, a  breathtaking version of Clark's self-penned anti-war anthem ""On the  Path of Glory"".  A wonderful bonus are the original Plymouth  commercials featuring Clark touting the latest in luxury cars.  This is  truly a spectacular 60-minute ""Spectacular""!",965779200,12,1577,4.996124031007752
7877847,5,6304749872,"This 1968 NBC special is the only music video of Petula currently available(apart from guest appearances).It shows Petula at the height of her popularity in America ,and both sound and picture quality are amazing  considering this is 30+ years ago. Highlights for me are of course the  classic ""On the path of glory"" duet,and also her knock out self  composed ""Just say goodbye"",as well as some of her hits. Buy  it,you won't be disappointed!",955843200,5,442,4.9324324324324325
7877848,4,6304749872,"Clark's 1968 NBC special is best known for the moment when she touched Harry Belafonte's hand, causing NBC censors to go ballsitic. The video does not include a studio audience, except at the end. Pet's voice is in top  form. She does perform ""Downtown"" ""Don't Sleep In The  Subway,""""Who Am I,""  and ""Color My World,"" but  concentrates more on album tracks like ""Las Vegas,"" ""Just  Say Goodbye,"" ""Life and Soul of the Party,"" ""Have  Another Dream On Me,"" ""The In-Crowd,"" ""Imagine,""  and ""We Can Work It Out."" Harry Belefonte sings one number then  is joined by Pet for ""On the Paths of Glory."" (Watch her hands!)  Clark went aboard The Queen Mary for one sequence. A must for Pet Clark  fans, others may not be so enticed.",931996800,10,722,4.6141732283464565
