8322740,5,B001N0LE9W,"If you enjoy Indie films (ie low budget, local stage actors, etc) then you'll love this fun film about compounding mistakes and consequences to actions. For a B film, it actually turned out pretty dang good! It received rave reviews at the College of Southern Idaho and Idaho State University.",1376006400,,293,4.88
8322741,1,B001N0LE9W,"I bought 2 other Jimmy Stewart movies and this one was listed ""People who bought my ""Jimmy Stewart"" movies also bought ""this"" movie.  This movie C rated piece of garbage that doe not star ""Jimmy Stewart"", at least not the Jimmy Stewart the world knows and loves.  This is the last time I choose one of Amazon's recommended ""picks"".  Garbage movie!",1355529600,,347,4.655737704918033
8322742,5,B001N0LE9W,"""In Convenience"" is an entertaining movie whose value can rival films with big actors coming out of a certain Californian region. I'm not comparing this movie to Oscar winners (or even nominees), but this was a movie made entirely on the backs of volunteers, and the picture, audio, and story show a quality just as good as you would expect from a movie you went to see at a theater.

It's even more amazing when you realize that this movie had close to NO budget, and yet is miles beyond even a more recent $500,000 independent picture (*cough* ""Moving McCallister"" *cough*). The writer & director took a huge gamble and has spent a huge amount of his time making this the best picture he could given those circumstances, and everyone pulled behind him offering up a talent pool that Hollywood should keep its eyes on.

While it may not end up being your favorite movie, that doesn't mean this movie doesn't belong on your shelf. Jimmy Stewart's take on the lovable oaf, Roach, is more than worth the purchase price.

Also, You'll love the DVD menu: It shows a love and care that most studios don't bother with on their discs.",1228521600,2,1127,4.597014925373134
