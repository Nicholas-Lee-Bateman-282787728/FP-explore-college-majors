2194817,4,B0006SSREC,"I searched and searched for this DVD - It was worth it. I was lucky enough to be in the audience in The Village in 1961. The show was new - the music was new - and when I left the theatre the music sang in my head and heart as if I had memorized it all. The performance stands out as one of those magical memories for me. After 42 years in the same theatre, it proves my response was that of many, many people. This DVD is well done!",1446422400,3,433,3.769230769230769

2194819,5,B0006SSREC,"I love this version of ""Try To Remember"".  It shows Jerry Orbach's great talent.",1431734400,2,80,4.714285714285714
2194820,1,B0006SSREC,"Brings back great memories from over the years. Jerry Orbach was incredible in his role of El Gallo.......
Well worth purchasing....and watching many times over....",1423958400,2,164,5.6
2194821,5,B0006SSREC,"The DVD was delightful. We did the play when I was in college, but I never knew much about its history. All the many artists involved, the very fact that it was done in that tiny theater, with the players practically in the audiences' laps, the staging and music~ it was all very innovative, unique, and exciting. Add in how much it became woven into the fabric of New York culture, and the play took on a life of its own. It was a story and a phenomenon unto itself. I found the DVD extremely interesting, and would recommend it to anyone who is interested in the play, or in musical theater itself",1416700800,3,599,4.3097345132743365
2194822,5,B0006SSREC,"This documentary commemorating the closing of this musical after 42 years in NYC is only an hour long, so it may seem pricey unless you are a Fantasticks Fanatic. However, if you have a special fondness for the work, as I have, you must at least rent this. My relationship with the show began in 1962, when my college was one of the very first to get the rights to stage a production away from New York. Joining our drama department's cast of talented students and faculty members was an actor who had just finished playing the boy, Matt, at Sullivan Street. I think his name was Jack Black (no, not the current Jack Black.) I was the drama and film critic for my college paper at the time. The show just stunned me, and I have been a sucker for it ever since. I never got to Manhattan to see it in its original setting, but I have watched half-a-dozen productions in the past 40 years in four states. This DVD is a very nice tribute, featuring the people responsible for the music, the lyrics, the script and the staging. I was sorry when it ended, and wish they had expanded the film to at least two hours...any show lasting 42 years in the same theater deserves a good historical record.",1164844800,13,1190,4.364864864864865
2194823,5,B0006SSREC,"This is a wonderful documentary on one of the best musicals ever written. Granted that after running for 42 years there are many more stories, but the DVD would have to have a length of 42 years.

Any DVD that shows even small portions of the original staging is to be enthusiastically welcomed.

To clear up one point in a previous review, it is clearly stated that Liza Minelli appeared in another production of the show NOT the New York version. That is why she is not interviewed.",1156896000,12,484,4.488636363636363
2194824,5,B0006SSREC,"Very nice documentary on this legendary show

Dont know what that other reviewer is talking about; Liza Minnelli was never in The Fantasticks - is he confusing the show with Flora the Red Menace",1147392000,4,194,4.705882352941177
2194825,1,B0006SSREC,"There was so much more to The Fantasticks, but this video didn't show it.  The passing of the legendary Jerry Orbach leaves many of his inside stories untold.  Liza Minnelli wasn't even interviewed.  The story told by the composer and lyricist was interesting, but I still felt there was so much more to be said.  It's on a par with the disappointing film version of The Fantasticks.",1127088000,7,383,4.6716417910447765
2194826,5,B0006SSREC,"This is the first review I have written for anything I have purchased from Amazon...and I have purchased many items!

This is a wonderful documentary capturing the magic of The Fastasticks from the creators' early collaborations through today.  Learning the story of the original producer, who stayed through the end of the all the performances AND also played one of the fathers for 16 years was one of the many things I learned from viewing this film.

I have many films I've purchased and not even watched yet.  This I watched within an hour of receiving it today.

Don't miss it whether you ever saw The Fantasticks at The Sullivan Street Playhouse or not....

I'm fortunate that Hurricane Gloria did not hit New York City  in the way it was predicted because that was the weekend of my first wedding anniversary and I had tickets to see The Fantasticks at The Sullivan Street Playhouse.  That was September 23, 1985 the first and only time I saw The Fantasticks.  I will never forget it.  Because of Jerry Orbach's death I discovered the existence of this DVD and am thrilled to have it.  I never saw Jerry Orbach on Broadway or The Fantasticks, but I always think of him as El Gallo and a great stage actor.

Enjoy!",1106784000,45,1221,4.601851851851852

8043056,5,B0006SSREC,"Somewhere in a misty memory there are hidden songs we try to remember, and then we do.
And if you have a memory of live theater, you do remember--so easily staged, recognizable characters, and music that lingers, and lingers.
If you haven't seen the play, watch this----and you will.",1478908800,,283,4.795918367346939
8043057,5,B0006SSREC,"This was a great look back on a show that makes people feel good in the end.  The intimacy of the theater was perfect.  I was able to see it last year and the funniest part was when El Gallo was doing the exaggerated death scene and wound up face to face with my friend who is 6'6"" and 457 pounds.  Even the actor was taken aback which made it even funnier.",1477094400,,357,3.9305555555555554
8043058,5,B0006SSREC,"A delightful and entertaining look at the history of one of the most performed musicals to ever simply grace any stage, professional or community or educational.
