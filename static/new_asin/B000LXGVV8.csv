8164825,3,B000LXGVV8,"This movie begins as a romance, when Ayaan (Salman Khan) meets model Ahana (Shilpa Shetty) and falls in love with her.  After finding her diary, he woos and marries her with the help of the information her diary provides.  Then the movie becomes a domestic drama, with their marriage on the rocks--with the diary as the apex--and the viewer is left wondering if love will be enough to reconcile them.

The plot starts off interesting, but after a while, the arguments become tiresome.  The resolution happens too quickly, and is not fully believable.  Khan goes from charming to stubborn well, but the viewer will be conflicted as to whether he is in the right.  Ahana's character is too spoiled and sullen to be fully likable; whether this is the fault of the actress or the writing is uncertain.  There are some quite good songs, but the choreography is below average.  Overall, this is an okay movie, but not one I would universally recommend.",1501804800,,946,4.7607361963190185
8164826,3,B000LXGVV8,"The movie starts off kind of slow and Salman Khan's character and Shilpa Shetty's character both fall in love and get married. The movie gets really good after they get married. The scenes where they get in arguments keep the viewer interested.  Eventually Salman gets really angry and slaps Shilpa Shetty so she leaves. After that the movie gets beyond ridiculous. All the way from the ""fake police man"" to how Shakti Kapoor finally puts his wife in line by slapping her twice. Moral of this movie - the way to stay married and keep your wife under control is to slap her. That is why I had to cut two stars off the review; I thought that was absolutely ridiculous.  The only reason it gets three stars is the movie does keep the viewer entertained throughout it, even though the story has some holes in it.",1172188800,4,808,4.489795918367347
