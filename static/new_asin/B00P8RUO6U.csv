6790889,5,B00P8RUO6U,An Excellent post-war move based on a real person who was on site both as a minor actor and as a technical advisor.  Almost all of the members were former soldiers which added a great deal of authenticity to the movie.  I recommend it to all action and adventure movies buffs,1429833600,4,275,4.372549019607843

6790896,5,B00P8RUO6U,"Dirk Bogarde is an Excellent actor.  Even though, I'm not usually a fan of War Movies, this film kept my interest at all times.  The element of humor is used very effectively in ""The Password Is Courage"".",1475625600,,204,4.486486486486487
6790897,4,B00P8RUO6U,"A good movie--combines humor with suspense and drama.  Although it isn't an exact representation of actual events, it is based on actual events in World War II.",1475366400,,160,4.925925925925926
6790898,4,B00P8RUO6U,Would be a great movie if the Germans were shown for what they were rather than showing them mostly as clowns.,1470700800,,110,4.285714285714286
6790899,4,B00P8RUO6U,The movie is exactly what you'd expect from an early British 60s black and white WWII war film. Highly enjoyable.,1468540800,,113,4.7

6790903,2,B00P8RUO6U,"The Password is Courage is a 1962 black and white WW2 POW film based on a 1954 memoir of a British Sergeant Major. The film is a blend of The Great Escape (1963) and Stalag 17 (1953) but unlike these great films, Password doesnt succeed. The comedy isn't all that funny and the suspense isn't all that exciting. Indeed, the film makes it seem like living in a WW2 POW camp could be a hoot, which obviously it wasnt. And all Nazi officers were not stupid or greedy.

Variety said the film has pumped into its untidy 116 minutes an overdose of slapstick humour. Result is that what could have been a telling tribute to a character of guts and initiative, the kind that every war produces, lacks conviction.

There are a few good action scenes and some nice special effects. But there are far better POW films including Stalag 17 (1953), The Colditz Story (1955), and The Great Escape (1963).",1464220800,2,889,4.515527950310559

8686966,5,B00P8RUO6U,"Based upon the book by the same name: ""The Password is Courage"". The ""Great Escape"" portion of the film is only the last 25-minutes. Most of the film is highly entertaining escapes and sabotage in the camp. The ""Great Escape"" portion of the film is different enough to be interesting even if you have already seen the other film. So, if you have seen the movie, ""The Great Escape"" there is so much additional things here that you will enjoy the film.

Sergeant-Major, Charlie Coward, spoke German and made 7 escapes; often impersonating a German officer. Thus, the seemingly unbelievable scene in  the trailer of him being wounded and awarded the Iron-Cross medal by the Germans in a hospital is true; though embellished a bit (He was wearing a German officer's uniform in real-life). Sergeant Coward has even more exploits in the book than shown in the film. For instance; in the book; he saves Jews at Auschwitz by bribing German guards to give him the clothing of dead, non-Jews, which he gives to living Jews to then impersonate gentiles. Some say, Sergeant Coward was not involved in the ""Great Escape""; though that escape is a true story by others; except for the female love-interest. ""Truth is stranger than fiction"".

The British soldiers sing some good songs while covering-up their plotting, which makes this a musical too.",1507680000,,1334,4.86784140969163
