8516149,5,B000H4GRPQ,"This video sure had some exciting footage, even some humorous moments! One exciting moment is a bowhunter in British Columbia walking up to 2 fighting Bull Moose and got so close to shoot, they didn't pay attention to him and kept fighting. One funny moment was a Turkey hunt with Georgia hunter Derek Fowler, who's also on Realtree's Pro Staff, encountering a strutting and gobbling hen, thinking she was a tom. Another scene I remember where a member of Realtree's Pro Staff featured in the Home Videos series was Home Videos 3 where another longtime Realtree Pro Staffer Joe Drake, also from Georgia, was Turkey hunting in Texas and called in a Peacock! This is an exciting and entertaining video from Realtree and I'm glad I added this and Home Videos 5 to complete my Realtree Home Videos collection.",1491782400,,805,4.798561151079137
