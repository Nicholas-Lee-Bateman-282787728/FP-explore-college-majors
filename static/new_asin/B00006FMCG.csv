7967936,1,B00006FMCG,"As informative as the first ""FOX"" documentary was about the creation of the studio on up to the mid 60's, this one is a phony, fascist, self promoting hype-o-thon. It's slightly informative up through the early 80's, though not really showing anything any cinema student doesn't know about Star Wars, 60's Musical Flops or the impact of Planet of the Apes and Patton, then goes into the ""groundbreaking brilliance"" of films like Last of the Mahicans, Home Alone, True Lies and Independence Day??!!

This is BS propaganda at it's worst, yes the latter films were hits, but to rave about them in even the same category as Butch Cassidy or Patton or Apes or even Young Frankenstein is ridiculous and insulting. I actually felt bad for James Coburn having to spew narration about the ""wit and genius"" of Home Alone, having seen the truly amazing films he himself starred in from the 60's and 70's. I guess it's take the money and run...",1298678400,3,932,4.717791411042945

7967938,5,B00006FMCG,"20th Century Fox was and to this day still is one of the major studios in Hollywood. The studio has a long and distinguished history and has made some of the most enduring classics in film. From tiny superstar Shirley Temple to the massive nearly crushing drama surrounding ""Cleopatra"" and beyond into a 21st century mega-studio this documentary leaves no stone unturned as it majestically rolls along. Great clips are presented along with reminiscences of some former Fox stars.

A must have documentary for any film fan or historian. And for me it brought up so many memories of hours spent watching some of Hollywood's most enduring films. For new buffs it is like opening a hidden treasure trove of films and will wet the appetite for exploring our rich and wonderful cultural history as preserved in celluloid.",1238716800,17,815,4.905797101449275
7967939,5,B00006FMCG,"If you are a movie buff like myself, then this dvd is a MUST for your collection.  The clips of past movies is both enjoyable and entertaining.  This was the era of grand movies, unlike what is being made today.  Sit back and relive the days when going to the movies was a really great treat.",1235606400,10,292,4.178571428571429
