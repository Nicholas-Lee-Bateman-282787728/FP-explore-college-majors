8759908,5,B01F0XQB4U,"Any resemblance to this version of ""THE VIRGINIAN"", and Owen Wister's novel and it cinematic representations, is purely **coincidental**.  But in no way am I putting the film down.  Like the 1931 film ""FRANKENSTEIN"", this film uses only the **bare, basic-essentials** from, the 1902 novel, and adds enough action to make it a very worth-while film for **any** Western enthusiast to enjoy.  As for the film ""DAWN RIDER"", it was not exactly mu cup-of-tea.  But then, I didn't much like the original, either.",1503100800,,505,5.048192771084337
