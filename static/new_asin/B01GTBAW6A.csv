8763494,5,B01GTBAW6A,"This is the sweetest little cartoon. It is Hungarian but there are no words, just music, so it is suitable for all language speakers. Basically, it is a magical rabbit that helps  children solve various problems. Each episode is about 6-7 minutes and ideal for a preschool or elementary child, although I must say that I also enjoy it as an adult.",1509580800,,347,4.596774193548387
