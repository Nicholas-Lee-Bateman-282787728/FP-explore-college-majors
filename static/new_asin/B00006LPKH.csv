1785939,3,B00006LPKH,"OK acting and the dialogue is real-to-life.  The movie does pretty well in developing the characters, but there was no real focus or plot so it was hard to be sympathetetic towards anyone.",1388188800,,188,4.696969696969697
1785940,5,B00006LPKH,"I like this movie because it opened my eyes to the salvage realities of seeking to be rich in black ghettos' by any means necessary. For example, the home invasion scam was tyrannically scary. To think that beautiful black woman would come alongside thugs and become accessories to murder in order to go on shopping sprees is unconscious . If you want to see how far some folks self-esteem has dipped watch this movie. And if you want to see a good example of what goes around comes around or the rooster coming home to roost watch it.

What I did not like about the movie is it did not have enough substantive content in the narrative showing how children are negatively impacted when a parent is murdered by home invaders.  Black on black crime is  worst when  criminals know that their robberies and murders will destroy black families but they still put money before people.",1387929600,,878,4.608974358974359

1785955,3,B00006LPKH,"Compared to the other movies on Amazon which are already on Netflix this is worth watching.  Particularly if you are into urban drama! This movie suffers from having a low budget but conveys a good storyline. The acting is good by the major characters and lacks with others. Like the guy who plays Sha's husband and the scenes involving her family! Its painful sitting through those boring, dry scenes.
As the story develops towards the 2nd half of the film that becomes overlooked!
Its not a great film. However if your looking for a movie on Amazon Instant that is not already streaming on Netflix then this is worth it!",1378425600,,622,4.654545454545454

1785961,4,B00006LPKH,"Durdy Game is a movie along the same vein as other regional hood movies such as New Jersey Drive, Menace II Society, Juice, and others. The key difference was the culprits weren't necessarily drug dealers, or gang members. The conflict comes with the bad decisions individuals make due to lust, and falling to peer pressure from so called friends. Durdy Game was a good watch, and if you are a fan of good urban movies, you will definitely want Durdy Game in your collection.",1302220800,,475,4.666666666666667
1785972,3,B00006LPKH,"This movie was alright but what disappointed me was the ending,  Now they could have done better than that. The lessons are evident. Nobody knows anybody and people are like the weather, changing and unpredictable.
This is the kind of movie you borrow and return .  A 7 in my book.",1292630400,,281,4.490196078431373

1785976,5,B00006LPKH,This was a pretty good movie for it to be a low budget film.  The message in it was pretty self-explanatory. I dealt with everything from envy to very scadalous people that's in the game. It also let you know that you can't even trust your significant other 100%. Even the woman that the guy was in love with and married to played him.,1183334400,,335,4.234375
1785977,3,B00006LPKH,this movie was much better than i expected. and the eye candy was real nice to.,1173312000,,79,4.0
1785978,4,B00006LPKH,"A couple of years ago, my (at the time) 17 year old niece recommended this film to me.  I had seen it in the $5 bargain bin at Wal-Mart several times before, but once she suggested I watch it, I couldn't find it anywhere.  I check for it just about everywhere, to no avail.

Several months ago, while looking up other films I came across the title again and looked it up and decided to purchase it, via online.  It arrived in the mail and I placed it with several other dvd's waiting to be viewed.  Somehow or another it ended up, blended in with the rest of my video library (over 600 DVDs), and I just came across it a few weeks ago.

Over this past weekend, I had the opportunity to watch the film and enjoyed it.  In spite the fact that it isn't the best quality of material or acting.

Not sure why a few others referred to this as porn, because I have seen far worse in other films.  The only deciding factor I can come up with is the fact that the characters are African American and not from the most desired social background.

Take the same type of graphic sex scenes, and place them in a ""Hollywood White"" film and all of a sudden, it's acceptable?

I enjoy what I consider ""Hollywood White"" films, just as much as the next person, but always try to support the efforts of my people.  If we don't support each other...who will?  Maybe once others see how we can come together for the good of our own, they will start to extend their support in our direction, the same as we have for them for many, many years.

I recommend this film to others.",1170633600,2,1554,4.206081081081081
1785979,3,B00006LPKH,"I was in the video store looking for a movie.  I pretty much saw everything in the store (I am a huge movie buff).  Anyway, I notice this movie ""Durty Game"".  The cover had three very sexy black women.  I new from reading the back of the cover that this was an indie (the cover came off as non-hollywood).  The story synopsis wasn't original, but I wanted to watch a movie and it didn't look boring.  So I rented it.  Me and my girlfriend watched this movie right after watching a big special effects Hollywood movie and we enjoyed ""Durty Game"" more!

This movie does not have big fancy stunts, gunplay, or special effects.  There are no A-list stars featured either. HOWEVER, the story played out very well and the dialogue between the girls was very entertaining.  And the sex scenes were hot too. The DVD has extended sex scenes in the deleted scenes special feature section for those interested.

In short.  The dialogue was funny.  The situations messed up.  And the ending, all I can say is - Karma is a bi**ch!

The girls are the reason why I rented this movie.  All though unknown, they are sexy enough to carry a movie, which these three women do very well.  The acting is bad in some parts, mostly during argument scenes.  But not too bad that you can't get into the movie.  If you like hood movies, and this is a ""hood"" movie- sex, drugs, money, cars, women, clubs, guns, etc.. then this is worth the watch.  If you're from the hood, you can definitely relate.  If not...check it out anyway.  You might learn something.

basically it is about 3 independent women that have to make a living and get theirs. but they soon realize that getting theirs has its price to pay....

the acting was not the best but you can kind of relate to the characters and they do make an effort to show a little depth....

1785994,3,B00006LPKH,"This is not a Hollywood movie and therefore should not be judged by the same standards. In the music industry, you don't compare an album made by a band on a huge record label to an album made by a band on a small label. Therefore, I don't believe it's necessary to do it here. This movie is about three young ladies who are obviously frustrated with men. One of the ladies convinces the other two that the best way to get revenge on men is to get their money. The way they chose to do this is to romance various men with a certain amount of wealth, scope out their houses and belongings then make plans to have someone else break in at a later date. I found the plot to be thin and unoriginal however I enjoyed how the actors portrayed each character. While none of the actors are A-list (or even B-list for that matter), I like their idiosyncrasies. Some of them over act while others don't do enough acting. To me, it makes for an interesting mix. The movie drags on for a certain amount of time without much happening while setting up the fall of the ladies ""scam"". I won't reveal exactly how that happens but let's just say that you reap what you sow. I must say that I didn't enjoy the soft porn aspect of this movie. In my opinion, it was just eye candy and that depends on the set of eyes viewing. But overall, the I did find this movie entertaining. Could I watch it multiple times?

What sets this film apart from the rest is that it is based on a true chain of events.  The lead characters are well developed and definitively identifiable. They are modeled after women that many of us know. These elements give the events of the movie a deeper feeling of reality that other films in its genre lack.
The menus on the DVD are highly stylized and I loved the addition footage.  This is another element of the DVD that sets it apart from its competition.  When it is all said and done this is one of the best stories of the power of karma in recent years. Viewers may quite possibly think twice about committing their next durdy action.

7971953,4,B00006LPKH,"The casting director deserves a pat on the back, because he did that! All three actresses are cuties and sure to keep your attention while on screen ( especially if you're a man). The story line was good and I love movies that have a twist. The reason I rate this as a four star movie instead of a five star movie is because the acting at times wasn't grade A, and the ending was rather unfulfilling. I will say that "" Sha"" did an excellent job playing a jaded seductress. I found myself getting turned on by her coyness, accent, and flirtatious moves. There were a few scenes that I felt contained some shoddy acting that should have been reshot, but the acting by all three ladies was good enough to not detract from the movie.

Purchasing a low budget movie that one has  never seen before is always risky business, but I liked this movie. It was worth the purchase.",1497916800,,869,4.3580246913580245
