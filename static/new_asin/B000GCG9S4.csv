I intially was just going to ""humor her"" as the show is called GIRLY and all the posters and stuff are pink. I was totally expecting to be male-bashed or bored. I WAS LAUGHING MY BUTT OFF! It was really funny! One sketch reminded me of my mom, the next my sister, another my girlfriend, etc., etc. I really enjoyed myself and laughed a lot. Later my girlfriend bought the DVD of the show and I was like, ""Hey, play that cheerleader sketch again!""",1160956800,,536,4.37
8130577,5,B000GCG9S4,"Girly is great!  The comedic styling of Leslie Link and Kris Duncan leave the laughing enthusiast begging for more.  But be careful what you wish for, these funny girls make good on their promise to make you pee.  It's a classy collection of clean, fresh routines that explore the hilarious quirks, psyche, and endearing qualities of the postmodern female.  Don't worry fellas, there's plenty here for us to bust-a-gut over.  Here is your license to laugh at all those crazy idiosyncrasies about women that you just never get.  Enjoy!!!",1160006400,,536,4.966292134831461
8130578,5,B000GCG9S4,"Girly is an unbelievably funny DVD that kept me laughing the whole way through.  After I saw the show in person, I knew I had to own the DVD so I could watch at home whenever I wanted and laugh all over again.  Like I said, this DVD is a MUST HAVE for people who enjoy smart and fun comedy!",1160006400,,290,3.816666666666667
