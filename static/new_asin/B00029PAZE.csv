The better cartoons, Super Chicken & Tom Slick have not been included.  I would suggest getting the original 8, the asking prices of the used copies reflects the popularity of those over these.

THE GOOD NEWS: These three tapes are recorded in the SP quality mode and closed captioned!

See original tape volumes for story details.

Tape 1 ""MONKEY BUSINESS"" includes
""Witch Doctor,"" (aka The Malady Lingers On) (from Vol. 1)
""Chi-Chi Dog,"" (from Vol. 2)
""Oo-oo Birds of a Feather,""  (from Vol. 2)
""Monkey Business."" - THIS IS THE NEW-TO-VIDEO CARTOON - Kidnappers take George's Ape to sell him to a TV show producer who wants to make a jungle show.  But Ape would rather act like a human, just as he does around Groege.

Tape 2 ""JUNGLE FEVER"" includes
""Gold Mine,"" (aka Treasure of the Sarah Madre) (from Vol. 3)
""Dr. Scrupritzer, I presume,""
""Mr. Noodnick,"" (aka Kings Back-to-Back)
""Ring-a-Ding Circus."" (aka Big Flop at the Big Top) (from Vol. 7)

Tape 3 ""ANIMAL POWER"" includes
""The Sultan's Pearl,"" (from Vol. 5)
""The Agent,"" (aka The Forest's Prime Evil)
