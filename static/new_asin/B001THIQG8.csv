3790574,2,B001THIQG8,I could not finish this movie. Got too boring in the first half hour. Sad cause I like Diane Keaton.,1323216000,,100,4.05
3790575,3,B001THIQG8,"Another screwball comedy with a good cast, this one with Diane Keaton as a kooky woman who comes to stay with her son and his wife during a fight with her husband. At first it's more irratating than funny, but it does have some good laughs as the film progresses(the Funeral is a highlight). It's nothing special, but it's not all that bad either.",1272758400,4,347,4.4375
3790576,3,B001THIQG8,"I have an inexplicable fondness for this slight, oddball 2008 comedy. It's not the catastrophic train wreck others would have you believe it is. Instead, director/screenwriter Vince DiMeglio has concocted a screwball farce with off-kilter characters that alternate between endearing and irritating, often in the same moment. The film is by no means a significant milestone in cinema, but it does generate some unexpected laughs mostly due to Diane Keaton's freewheeling performance. The Oscar-winning actress may appear to be slumming here, but her dexterity is put to the test as one incredibly needy and critical mother.

Usually a second banana in films, Dax Shepard (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Baby-Mama/dp/B001BL96K2/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Baby Mama</a>) plays Noah, a physical therapist who gets fired and wants to change his luck by starting his own practice. Married to Clare, a schoolteacher who wants to have a baby badly, he finds his wife's cousin Myron, a dweeby screenwriter wannabe, parked on the couch. Later, Noah's mom Marilyn drops by unexpectedly after a big fight with his father. She moves in with her five dogs, all named Sammy Higgins, and together they find jobs at the carpet store where Noah used to work. Her flighty incompetence gets them both fired, and things get even worse from there.

Shepard relies heavily on a deadpan delivery to carry his performance. Liv Tyler (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Lord-of-the-Rings/dp/B000X9FLKM/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Lord of the Rings</a>) is sweet as Clare, and Mike White (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Good-Girl/dp/B0000797IO/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Good Girl</a>) manages to make his creepiness oddly likeable. But it's Keaton who amps up her innate zaniness to draw a beleaguered level of sympathy to a character that could have been buried in sitcom-level clichs. For evidence, watch her work the scene in the Denny's-style restaurant or trade barbs with Shepard in the funeral scene. Production values are on the modest side. The 2009 DVD features an entertaining commentary track from DiMeglio (who reveals that the story is somewhat autobiographical) and a brief making-of featurette.",1266364800,8,2312,6.110769230769231
3790577,3,B001THIQG8,"This film was okay so I cannot recommend it unless you are big fan of Diane Keaton, Liv Tyler or Dax Shepard.

The movie had some pretty funny moments (most of it is crude) but the bad acting (Liv Tyler's delivery was wooden), over acting (Diane Keaton was over the top) and lame script did not make for a great comedy.  There are better overbearing mom movies out there to watch (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Monster-in-Law-New-Line-Platinum-Series/dp/B000A343RI/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Monster-in-Law (New Line Platinum Series)</a>&nbsp;comes to mind).

This movie was watched while I was sick and taking NyQuil D so I might have added a star too many.",1262044800,,698,5.823529411764706
3790578,2,B001THIQG8,"This movie has a funny concept that usually can't fail - overbearing parents. However,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Smother/dp/B001THIQG8/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Smother</a>&nbsp;just isn't that funny. Rather than being funny, Diane Keaton's character often just appears annoying and crazy. Rather than smothering her son, she seems like she should be put in an insane asylum. I don't think I laughed much at all throughout the movie. At the end, I just ended up feeling depressed about the characters complaining that they had wasted their lives. I was also upset when Dax Shepard yelled at the geese. Not funny.

If you want really funny comedy about a smothering mother, check out the sitcom&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Everybody-Loves-Raymond-The-Complete-Series/dp/B000UR9TKK/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Everybody Loves Raymond - The Complete Series</a>.",1258675200,,954,7.2956521739130435
3790579,2,B001THIQG8,"Oh . . where to begin. First of all, I love Diane Keaton - in fact I like all of the lead characters. But this movie is SO bad - I couldn't believe how bad it was. It supposed to be about Diane Keaton being a 'smothering' mother - huh?? You don't even see her do that much. Maybe it's the writing, I don't know. It just didn't make any sense at all. Except for Ken Howard (Diane Keaton's husband) - he was the best of the lot - the second star is for him.",1245542400,6,455,3.8
3790580,3,B001THIQG8,"Figured I would give it a try in the store and see how people take Keaton these days. She was cast well to play the thoroughly irritating and overbearing mother, in tow with the token dog pack and oblivion to her psychoses.

Dax Shepard plays her married son who must deal with all of his pre-mid life crisis happenings in a way that can entertain an audience for 92 minutes. Liv Tyler plays his wife, and even as admitted in the writing she is present only as a ""sperm receptacle"", her screen time gathered no accolades. After playing it several times the reactions of customers were mixed. Most swayed towards enjoying some of the comedic moments, but any prolonged viewing garnered irritation. It became apparent this would be one of those films some of the gals would watch solo, because in every group people would look at each other and laugh how cliche or contrived it felt.

The DVD documentary lasts 8 minutes about how awesome and perfect everyone is to work with. Dax actually had funnier lines of self importance in this than in the movie. Gets a nice Ben Stiller slam in there. Recommend as rental for the Keaton fans, and maybe an owner for the Dax fans that want to see him try to carry a non-slapstick light comedy on his own.",1241049600,3,1242,4.515555555555555
3790581,5,B001THIQG8,"I love Diane Keaton's acting and she's terrific in ""Smother"", but WHY did she have to smoke (UGH!) Dax Shepard's dry wit is a hoot and Liv Tyler is a pleasure to watch. The bonus features should be interesting.",1240531200,2,210,4.410256410256411

3790590,1,B001THIQG8,"Although I've long been wary of any movie with Diane Keaton in it, I went ahead and rented this because of Dax Shepard. That was a mistake. We loved Shepard in the hit TV series, Parenthood. Unfortunately, he apparently only knows how to play the same character, and it didn't work in this pathetic excuse of a film. We were so disappointed in the utter lack of laughs that we shut it off a quarter of the way through.

As for Keaton, she's much better in straighter roles, e.g., opposite Michael Douglas in And So It Goes. She fails miserably in the I Love Lucy/Meg Ryan goofball schtick, instead just coming off as completely annoying..",1476144000,,638,4.547826086956522

3790621,2,B001THIQG8,"I love the stars in the film and the idea wasn't bad, but writer and storyline was terrible.  With a good cast like this you would expect a better plot, but it is the storyline that suffers badly.  The mother didn't come across as smothering, but just annoying.  With all of her dressed dogs you probably could have gotten some funny moments with that, but it wasn't explored.  Instead they had a goofy cousin staying with them played by Mike White who didn't even need to be in the movie.  The Mom was so annoying you felt great for the father who was beginning to enjoy her being gone.  Storyline - the obnoxious mom leaves the dad after an argument and moves in with the son along with her five dogs who all have the same name.  You feel like the writer and director sat around trying to figure out what other stupid things they could put in the movie.  Not ""Hilarious"", maybe amusing in some spots.  You might pass some time with this one, but you probably will not enjoy it.  Not family friendly.",1417910400,,1001,4.3621621621621625
