8684687,2,B00OS9SYRA,"Skip the John and Donna interviews. The rest is wonderful. The interviews with John and Donna are illusions, delusions and absolute garbage. Case in point: Donna was born Donna Louise Carvalho. NEVER A ROBERTS at all. When she divorced her husband Charlebois in NH, she ""took"" her mother's maiden name of Roberts as her own. To imply that she was an O'Bomsawin Abenaki? Indeed her ancestor back in the 1700's was brought to Quebec, Canada who for a small period of time had interaction with Quebec Indians/ perhaps Abenakis, but he thereafter always lived as a Frenchman, married French etc. So how does that make Donna Carvalho an Abenaki today?

Sorry, but fast forward through John and Donna's interviews. The BIA didn't think much of John Scott Moody's methodology as a genealogical research etc either back in 2005 or 2017 regarding his take (or faulty opinions) of the alleged ""Abenaki"" group up in Swanton, Vermont.",1496620800,,922,4.948387096774193
