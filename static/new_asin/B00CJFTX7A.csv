8582502,5,B00CJFTX7A,"Picture a man and a women, man with sawed off shotgun, suspected murderer, surrounded by more that a dozen machine gun carrying  officers being allowed to walk into a church and take hostages during a Christening! Moronic but not as bad as the sentence of those in this series that go to court. Murder a cop and your wife and get ten years in prison. My suggestion, if you want to murder someone, invite them to any Scandinavian county and spend a few years getting in shape for the next.
I do enjoy these shows on MHZ but couldn't continue with this one after some of this.  I just hope this fiction isn't reality.",1437868800,,615,4.385964912280702

8582505,5,B00CJFTX7A,"I was blown away by this series. The characters have grown so much over the three years, and the crime stories are even more fascinating. One of the best things about watching a non-American tv show is the fact that it is not as formula driven as American shows. The acting, writing and production quality of Unit One keeps getting better and better. I can't wait for series 4 to be available, and I will be trying other Nordic series.",1400025600,4,435,4.45
