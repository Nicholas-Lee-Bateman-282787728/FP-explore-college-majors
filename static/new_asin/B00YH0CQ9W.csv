7213317,5,B00YH0CQ9W,"By now all of you know the story so I won't comment on that. I'll remark on the 3D Blue Ray transfer. Guys, the 3D version looks phenomenal on my LG OLED TV with Passive 3D. This is one for collection and entertainment for those who love 3D Home movies",1501632000,,252,4.06
7213318,1,B00YH0CQ9W,"The 3D disc was fine... however, the digital copy of the movie is only good in either England or Ireland. Since I live in New Mexico, the digital copy part of the package is worthless. Therefore, I'm returning it.",1501286400,2,213,4.487179487179487
7213319,5,B00YH0CQ9W,This should be on every top 10 list for 3d movies.  In my opinion it was much better than 3d Avitar.  So far it is the best 3d movie that I have seen.  Bought it the day after I rented it at a local movie rental store.,1498435200,2,218,3.595744680851064

7213322,5,B00YH0CQ9W,"this is a awesome movie. they finally made another great Jurassic park film. when I heard about this one I thought it was I remake but it's not it's a continue off the other films. in this movie john Hammond gives the park to a new owner and he reopens the park and it is available to the public. but when a science project gone wrong starts terrorizing the park it's up to owen(pratt) to save the day. this movie is just as good as the first 3. I'm glad that this is not a remake. the story is good, the acting is good and the special effects is good. and this is the first time they introduce a water dinosaur. great movie hope there will be more. if you have not seen this movie then I recommend you do",1449792000,,705,4.042857142857143
