7866960,1,6304291817,"Complete waste of time and money.
One of the poorest quality videos I've ever soon. The sound goes in and out, you continually have to adjust tracking (even with auto tracking) so you can try and watch a grainy image of 80s era, silicone-enhanced models who obviously have zero knowledge about Tai Chi.
Don't waste your money; I'm sorry I wasted mine for a video that's now in the trash after 10 minutes.",1467244800,,404,4.5479452054794525
7866961,3,6304291817,It's a joke really...strippers with fake boobs pretending to do T'ai-Chi. Good for a laugh but that's about it.,1442620800,,111,4.894736842105263
7866962,4,6304291817,"well made have used it to loosen up, and it was a pleasure to have the ladies show the moves",1358640000,,92,3.65
7866963,3,6304291817,"This video is obviously about naked women in interesting poses and it succeeds.  I get a particular kick out of the fact that the women seem to disappear as the video goes on.  Probably either got disgusted and quit at some point or just had somewhere else to go.. The nude women are attractive.  The video is idiotic, but if you're looking for high production values in a vid entitled ""nude tai chi,"" you probably have a screw loose anyway.  It's fun or exploitative or both depending on your proclivities.",1312675200,,507,4.6
7866964,5,6304291817,"I can see that all the previous people who rated this video were men. All they talked about were the women's bodies. I am a female nudist, and I bought the video because I like working out in the nude. If you look beyond the women, you can really get an awesome and uplifting experience. Whenever I work out with this video, it leaves me feeling at peace; and all that has bothered me throughout the day just disappears. GUYS! Don't just look at the ""naked"" women. There is more to experience here than that. You are missing the whole experience!",998784000,20,546,4.415841584158416
