1658674,2,B00005T303,Didn't like because there was too much cursing. Movie would've been better without all those dirty words.,1264550400,,105,5.235294117647059
1658675,5,B00005T303,this is a very good movie about a barrio that is involved by gangs that control it.  the movie pertains to one main character a teenage boy that is in high school and  his uncle was killed recently because of a gang.  also his living brother that is older is the main man of a gang and does not want his little brother to be in the gang. this movie is for any person who wants to see some action and a great film. its a must see.,1056067200,2,429,3.852272727272727
1658676,2,B00005T303,"I love movies that feature people of color in Chicago, but this is no ""Love Jones"" or ""Soul Food.""  This was just a low-budget ""Boyz N the Hood"" set in Little Village.  The actors aren't as hot as the men in ""The Street King.""  This movie veres on the long side and has many subplots that lead nowhere.  Even the ""drive by"" of the title is not significant.  This movie is filled with violent deeds such as gang-initiation rape, murder-suicide, and several homicides, but the acting is so terrible that it becomes funny, rather than sad.  Every man in this film sports a leather jacket: c'mon!  Chicago isn't that cold!  There's one great scene where a mother loses it at her son's funeral.  I'm glad Latino actors and Latina actresses are getting hired and paid, but this movie was on the poor side.",1029801600,2,799,4.531468531468532

1658697,1,B00005T303,"To put it bluntly this was not a good movie. Don't get me wrong Ilike all types of gangster flicks, but things went bad from the beginning to end. The storyline was horrendous, acting low rate, and whoever held the camera must have been paid a mint just to film through all of the takes.",1417824000,,287,4.236363636363636
1658698,5,B00005T303,"This is a surprisingly well-done film that was all made on location in Pilsen and Little Village. The acting was very good, the camera work excellent, and the editing was perfect.

It makes me want to know more about the lives of people in this culture, parts of the vast urban latino areas of Chicago. I like the authenticity and compelling personalities.",1416096000,2,356,4.741935483870968

7953227,3,B00005T303,A bit less polished than this viewer likes to see. The street patois does not ring with authenticity. Things move a bit stiffly.,1457308800,,128,4.608695652173913
