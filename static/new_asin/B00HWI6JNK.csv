8636930,3,B00HWI6JNK,Not used to hearing kix brooks by himself. The songs are good. Worth giving it a listen.,1469750400,,88,4.235294117647059
8636931,5,B00HWI6JNK,The CD alone is worth the price and I did like the movie. I really liked seeing local scenery. I enjoy any movie that I recognize where it was filmed. It connects at a deeper level.,1460332800,,181,4.055555555555555

8636933,4,B00HWI6JNK,"I was impressed with this western movie because their was not an abundance of of foul language, sex and violence  It seems the new Westerns that are being produced can't tell the story without it and then there is No Story!  The Music background was fantastic as you would expect from Kix Brooks .  I think this is worth watching and listening to.  I hope Kix does more.",1414886400,2,370,4.397058823529412

8636935,1,B00HWI6JNK,"Total boring garbage and an annoying over the top and intrusive soundtrack of crap songs. Not sure what others were watching or if they were part of the crew BUT this predictable and poorly acted ""film"" deserves less than one star.",1400716800,,231,4.658536585365853
8636936,5,B00HWI6JNK,both are great and we enjoy the cd greatly and we watched the dvd with our family and/or with friends .,1399680000,,103,3.9523809523809526
8636937,4,B00HWI6JNK,"If you are a fan of Kix you will really like the movie and will really love the soundtrack.  Kix is not going to win any Oscars for his acting but there are many who are far worse!  The movie is a good and solid western shoot-em-up and worth a watch.  The songs on the soundtrack are excellent and have a great country-western sound, with good use of guitar and good lyrics.  Randy Houser really kills on ""High in the Saddle"".  Kix either wrote or co-wrote 10 of the 12 songs and performs 5 (3 are instrumentals).  I bought this for less than $15, you can't beat the price for great music and an entertaining western.",1390867200,5,617,4.275862068965517
