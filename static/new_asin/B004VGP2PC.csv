4482604,4,B004VGP2PC,"I love this novela. It does have some scenes missing from the DVD's( I know you can't put the whole 165 episodes on DVD's), but you get the
essence of the beautiful love story between Estrella Marina(Zuria Vega) and Victor Manuel(Mario Cimarro). Great novela.",1347148800,3,259,4.909090909090909
4482605,1,B004VGP2PC,"This was one of my favorite telenovelas, I had to have it on DVD but when I get and watch I am totally disappointed because of the fact that what was on the dvd was not the original telenovela that I saw and loved on tv, it was missing very good parts that I truly enjoyed and hoped to relive but was badly disappointed, for those looking to buy this be warned!!! This is not the original version rather a shorter less enjoyable version of the original soap opera.",1332374400,3,464,4.224719101123595
4482606,5,B004VGP2PC,"Wow..great romance and heart stopping eye candy.  The Mexican male actors make American and Canadian actors look like wimps!  lol  I have to applaud the editors since most of the telenovelas, and I believe I own 99% of them now, make a smooth transition between scenes and the scenes that are skipped the dialogue in future scenes fills you in!  YES, THERE ARE ENGLISH SUBTITLES!!!!!!!",1325289600,16,385,4.876923076923077
4482607,4,B004VGP2PC,"Ordene este Dvd, me llega en unos dias...
Espero que Contenga un Buen Resumen con Las Mejores Escenas de la Telenovela.
No tube Oportunidad de ver la Telenovela en forma Completa, espero que el Dvd valga la Pena, la Presentacion esta Muy Bonita, me gusto mucho el Dise&ntilde;o.
Cuando lo tenga y lo vea les cuento que tal esta el Resumen y demas...
1/11/2011: Me Gusto Mucho el Dvd, pero podria haber sido mucho mejor, tiene un Buen Resumen, solo que le Faltan Numerosas Escenas de la Telenovela, sobre todo la mayoria de las Peleas de Oriana con Estrella, algunas de las Peleas de Coral con Oriana y las de Coral con Estrellita.
La Pelea de Oriana con Luz en el Dpto esta pero cortada, no se ve cuando Oriana patea la silla y le dice a Luz que sea el quien la heche del Dpto.
El Dvd esta Muy Bueno solo que podrian haber hecho otro Disco mas con Resumenes, hubiera sido lo mas correcto pero bueno...
Del Gran Final Contiene lo Mas Importante, en eso Quede Muy Satisfecho, pues el Ultimo Capitulo Original solo fue puro relleno y Escenas de recuerdos, dejaron Lo Mas Importante, La Boda, el Final de Casilda y Guillermo y el Final en la lancha, que despues de todo era lo que realmente valia la pena.
El Dvd Contiene la Primera Entrada Oficial y los Creditos Finales tal como se Transmitio en Television.",1319500800,3,1305,4.464435146443515

4482617,4,B004VGP2PC,"Mar de Amor (Sea of Love - 718 minutes)

Estrella is our little virgin, happily catching fish and spreading happiness in her little village by the sea. Her piano teacher gives her a book and she promptly falls for the handsome, successful author because his picture is on the back cover.

Of course they meet and we spend the whole first disc dealing with rapes, past, present and future, the children who result, the emotional wounds and a lifetime of suffering.

The next disc gets better with a villainous bald guy who looks like American actor Gary Cole when he puts on a wig as a disguise.

Our author soon returns the love of the fisher-girl, to the dismay of HIS girlfriend and eventually, HER boyfriend, a doctor.

Insanity, murder, rape, this one has it all, along with undying love and nice people just doing their best.

Good to see this one available on Amazon.",1372982400,,873,4.6
