744405,5,6303949703,"I have fond memories of this movie as a child. This movie should be put on DVD because there is a market of buyers out there waiting for it. This is one of the best sequels to a movie that I have ever seen. The characters are  very powerful and memorable. The message for this movie is clear to all that see it (unless your asleep). My friends and I are waiting for this movie with bated breath, your attention in this matter would be greatly appreciated.",1207785600,4,455,4.2298850574712645
744406,4,6303949703,"I played Douglas Wright Jr. in this movie.  At the time, approximately 1972, this was an All star cast.  This movie will make you laugh, reminisce, and is thoroughly entertaining.  You won't meet two more determined and committed detectives who are truly concerned about their community.  This was my first movie and the cast was so nice to me.  At the time I was 12, so it was all new to me.  Luckily, my father took off from work to accompany me on set every day my role was filmed.  Talk about support.  This was a wonderful experience and I was fortunate to meet so many accomplished actors and film crew.  I have the VHS and I am waiting for the DVD, to add to my collection.  Go for it, get ""Cotton comes to Harlem"" while you're at it!

All the best

744781,3,6303949703,"I enjoyed this film but it was not as good as the original. Cambridge and Jacques were great in their roles. The film was good but it seemed to spiral out of control during the chaotic climax. The film is funny and the villain is despicable just as in the original film. The main villain has several sidekicks who steal most of their scenes. There are several criminals in this film that Coffin and Gravedigger must confront. They have their hands busy. There is plenty of action, fights and shootouts to keep your attention. This film would be rated PG. There is no sex or nudity. I wish they would've made a third film. Recommended for fans of the original film.",1422316800,,664,4.4958677685950414

744853,1,6303949703,This was a very poor quality copy.  This DVD appeared to be nothing but a VHS transfer.

744861,5,6303949703,"This movie should be on BLU RAY by now,COTTON COMES TO HARLEM has been for a few years. It should at least be available on remastered commercial DVD by now. These two films are two of the best 70's crime/comedy thriler films of the time. Forget most of the badly written/acted ""blacksploitation"" fims,other than SUPERFLY,SHAFT & DON'T PLAY US CHEAP,which is fantastic but still only on VHS i think. Both ""CHARLESTON BLUE & COTTON COMES TO HARLEM are based on the great crime thrillers by CHESTER HIMES.If you dug these films,check out his crime novel series available in paperback currently.
  I still also can't believe ""UPTOWN SATURDAY NIGHT"" hasn't made it to BLURAY yet,a true travisty. MR.BILL COSBY/SIDNEY POITIER/HARRY BELEFONTE/RICHARD PRYOR.These are some the true cinematic gems of 70's black cinema,& 70's cinema in general, films that should be paid their due. Try watching ""WATERMELON MAN"",again w/ the great GODFREY CAMBRIDGE,rip sweet man. It's a whole different film uncut,Thank you MR.MELVIN VAN PEEBLES!",1405900800,3,1021,5.257668711656442
