8324603,4,6303082742,"""Tales of Terror"" features adaptations of Edgar Allan Poe's stories, all of which are produced and directed by the talented Roger Corman. The first story ""Morella"" is about Lenora, a young girl (played by Maggie Pierce) who returns after many years to her ancestral home, only to find her estranged and almost deranged father (Price) stumbling about the house in a stupor, and horrors of horrors, still keeping the remains of his dead wife, Morella in one of the bedrooms. Not long after, Lenora is 'visited' by the vengeful spirit of Morella and all hell literally breaks loose. This first story is the shortest of the trio. The next story ""The Black Cat"" is actually a combination of Poe's ""The Black Cat"" and ""The Cask of Amontillado"" which brings together the dark and comic talents of both Price and Peter Lorre, and is quite entertaining (look out for the head tossing scene). Price especially plays his role to comic perfection. In the final story, ""The Case of M. Valdemar,"" Basil Rathbone plays a mesmerist (hypnotist) who decides to experiment with the unknown, i.e. putting a man (Price) into a state of hypnosis at the point of death, with horrifying results.

All in all, I'd recommend this to fans of Vincent Price and classic horror with a high dose of Gothic suspense and atmosphere.",1347926400,,1299,4.825112107623318
