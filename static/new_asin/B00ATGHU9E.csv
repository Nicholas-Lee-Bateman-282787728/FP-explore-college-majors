5509461,5,B00ATGHU9E,Great 'feel good' movie with great international pool stars.  Good story line with action and romance.  Jennifer Barretta was a surprising good actress considering she is a international pool star in her own right.  Good clips with the Black Widow and Allison Fisher.,1368057600,,267,5.162790697674419
5509462,1,B00ATGHU9E,Save your money. No pool here.,1420761600,,30,4.166666666666667
5509463,2,B00ATGHU9E,As an avid 9 ball player I was looking for more competition in the movie.  The story line was weak.  I felt like it was an hour and a half APA (American Pool Players Association) advertisement.,1418860800,,193,4.333333333333333
5509464,1,B00ATGHU9E,"Poor direction, bad acting, weak story line. As an avid pool player was hoping for a decent story at least with some cool pool playing, no such luck. Trust me skip this one.",1416009600,,173,4.2727272727272725

5509467,2,B00ATGHU9E,"If you're into billiards this is not the movie for you.  It had a cheap, 70's style, x-rated movie feel. It was by no means x-rated but I think the poor acting and camera work gave it that feel. But that aside, it was a poorly acted movie with a bad storyline. I only watched it to the end because I thought some great pool match was coming. A total waste of my time.",1410393600,2,367,3.9594594594594597
5509468,1,B00ATGHU9E,This is definitely the worst pool / billiard movies ever produced.  It is just a shameless plug for the APA (a national pool league association for those that do not know).  The B rated acting and very weak story line is bad enough then the poor production and actual pool scenes are very bad. For an alternative try Pool Hall Junkies.  It is one of the best if not at least the most under rated Pool movies out there.,1401667200,2,418,4.265822784810126

5509470,1,B00ATGHU9E,"Wooden acting paired up with horrible story line.
I feel COMPLETELY ripped off.
What this was is an advertisement for APA pool leagues and you're expected to pay to watch it.",1388361600,3,174,4.645161290322581
5509471,1,B00ATGHU9E,"In my lifetime I have not seen a movie quite like this.  I purchased the movie because I enjoy any movie that deals with billiards, e.g."" The Hustler"" or ""The Color of Money"" etc.  This is without a doubt the worse movie that was ever made.  How anyone could rate this movie higher than one star is UNBELIVEABLE.  Please save your money.",1387238400,5,337,4.387096774193548
5509472,1,B00ATGHU9E,Hardly a movie. More like a home video. An ad for the apa basically. Terrible acting too. Waste of money,1386720000,2,104,4.25
5509473,1,B00ATGHU9E,"Wooden acting paired up with horrible story line.  I rented this with a friend due to him being a fan of Jennifer Barretta.
I feel COMPLETELY ripped off.
What this was is an advertisement for APA pool leagues and you're expected to pay to watch it.
This just might qualify as the worst movie that I've ever seen.",1386201600,3,312,4.379310344827586
5509474,5,B00ATGHU9E,"I watched this movie twice and was very surprised on how the story turned around. It was a great screenplay!
I love pool and anything related to it. Jennifer Barretta and Jennifer Lee were featured: Two pool champions and pretty darn good looking women!

For not being professional actresses, they did a great job with the supervision of the movie directors!

The country band, Richie Fields, was awesome too! Love their songs and performance.

I definitely recommend it!!",1384214400,,472,5.0256410256410255
5509475,3,B00ATGHU9E,It seems like a fairly large marketing scheme for the APA. But Jennifer Barretta plays a mediocre-decent role playing gail never having acted professionally before. If you are a pool junkie that likes to see husle based movies. Go ahead and watch it!,1378771200,,250,4.837209302325581
5509476,2,B00ATGHU9E,"But I see a lot of movies. 9 BALL  ranks in the all time top 10 movies about billiards. Unfortunately there haven't been very many such movies, and the number of truly great ones can be counted on the fingers of one negligent punch press operator's hand. The mostly amatuer cast, highlighted by Jennifer Barretta, makes an honest effort  but are undone by a cliche-ridden script and poor direction. Tony Palma's true talent is in raising money for very low budget films... not so much in making them.",1374451200,3,500,4.670454545454546
5509477,5,B00ATGHU9E,Great to see a new classic style pool movie out there recognizing women in the game. It was inspirational and promotes league play as opposed to hustling. Very enjoyable.,1373241600,,170,4.896551724137931
5509478,3,B00ATGHU9E,"Writers should have watched the two most famous pool movies ver before writing the script, i.e. The Hustler and Color of Money. They both had lots of pool in them. This movie lacked that. Pity.",1371859200,,193,4.542857142857143
5509479,2,B00ATGHU9E,"If you are considering this movie for the pool...stop. This movie is a cheesy lifetime special long before it is a pool movie. Nearly every scene in the movie had an APA advertisement in the background. The characters were unbelievable, the ""hustling"" was contrived, and the acting was horrible. The music seemed like it was stolen from an early 90's, straight-to-tape movie.",1370563200,5,375,5.064516129032258
5509480,3,B00ATGHU9E,Not a bad movie at all. Not a bad plot. But as it has been said the APA stuff a little too extreme. Reminds me of Waynes World when they make fun how people sell out to the sponsors and yet Wayne and Garth are using all the stuff and it makes their movie funny...however the APA does it in the movie and they're serious so that takes the cheese scale of the movie from a 3 to an 8 easily. It's been a very long time since someone has put out a good pool movie and this one isn't going to win any awards but still entertaining if you're in the mood for a pool flick.,1368489600,,565,3.8376068376068377
5509481,1,B00ATGHU9E,"From the start, this movie,  if you want to call it that,  was a scratch in the side pocket.  It felt like I was watching an ""after school special.""  The acting was sub par and very predictable.  Yes, the movie featured pool greats, Jennifer Barretta, Jeanette Lee and Allison Fisher, but they should stick to what they do best, play pool.  The whole movie looked like a commercial for the APA pool league, which is endorsed by Jeanette Lee, especially the part where Jennifer Barretta's character meets Jeanette Lee.  I purchased this movie in hopes of seeing some good pool footage.  There was minimal pool playing and terrible acting.  Do yourself a favor, don't waste your time.",1368144000,2,682,4.760683760683761
8557548,3,B00ATGHU9E,"I never review films, but this one was too good to pass up. I don't mean it was actually good, because the film was incredibly bad. But, I do think it was one of those films that was so bad it was funny and in a weird way charming. There is hardly any actual pool being played except for the beginning and end of the film, with some shameless trick shot plugs in the middle. However, I have to say it was kind of a kick watching it and finding myself laughing at the horrid screenwriting, acting, and music choices. The way the story develops is just staggering. A lot of characters never even finish their development and the ending is just incredible. It's right up there with ""Kiss Shot"" for the most anti-climatic endings of all time. That's why I have to give this film 3 stars. I honestly believe there is a charm to it's poor film making quality.",1527984000,,853,4.304347826086956

It will give you a good laugh about how bad it is. But sometimes i do want a pool movie to actually be about pool.,1459209600,,311,3.727272727272727

But then I forgot all about it for awhile and after just seeing it wish I had never remembered. I had expected B movie acting and storyline, but perhaps at least a little good pool to make it interesting and enjoyable for those of us who love the game. But to call it a B movie would be an undeserved complement.  That, and there's basically no pool anyway, except for the shameless advertising for APA and Lucasi.  Jennifer should just go ahead and stick to pool, and of course more bikini photo  shoots",1430006400,2,593,4.276785714285714
