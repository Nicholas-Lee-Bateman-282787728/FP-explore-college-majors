8623187,4,B00GHH9ICG,"I was surprised to be the first amazon.com reviewer for this movie--I found it to be absolutely charming. The comedy is very well done, but more than this, it's a drama of substance that makes one think about what's really important in life.

Ms. Kherici's character, a fashion designer trying to foster her career, is shown in some of the opening scenes riding high in the night life, strutting through crowded clubs, confident, dressed in impeccable, sexy fashions, ruling the scene with her girlfriends. People who can't compete are duly snubbed. An air of cruel superficiality permeates the setting, and the fashion industry is shown as something over-priced and shallow--but *that* is easy to do...

...what's really interesting, and what I think does Kherici great credit, is how she juxtaposes this with the designers' passion for what they do. Put aside the nasty office politics and you see artists poring over the materials of their craft, working on their sketches, frustratedly putting aside what isn't working and trying again, harder, to come up with something new. There is this side to the fashion industry, too, and like any fair assessment of things, the pros and cons must be weighed together.

Kherici does a great job of presenting the paradoxes that make up our world; you see it in this depiction of the fashion industry, in the balancing of the comedy with the more serious business of character development, and in the conflicting forces of the film's subplots.

Of course there's no drama without conflict, and without giving out any spoilers, our heroine faces challenges in succeeding in her career. The path to her success involves grappling with these hurdles and she ends up a better person for surmounting them--which is pretty much what happens in any movie, but the lessons learned in *this* movie are so true and applicable to real life, I think this tale goes several steps beyond what we usually see.

My research on Ms. Kherici was not very successful--is this her first film? If so, I hope she keeps making them--to create something so great the first time out shows remarkable talent and promise.
