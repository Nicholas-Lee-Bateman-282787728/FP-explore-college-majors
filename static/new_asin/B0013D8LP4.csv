3103394,3,B0013D8LP4,"Having been looking forward to this release for sometime now I finally bought this yesterday and sat down and watched it last night and was a bit disappointed. But first the good, the filming, picture and audio are fantastic and the performance is good.

Here's the downside though. If you have The Complex Rock Tour Live DVD then you basically have this performance with a few new songs added in. Personally the The Complex Rock Tour Live DVD is much better is several ways compared to this DVD. On The Complex Rock Tour Live DVD the singers are better and more energetic, there's better interaction with the Blue Men, and the Blue Men on the The Complex Rock Tour Live DVD are much better. So having been spoiled on the The Complex Rock Tour Live DVD seeing basically the same songs again left a lot to be desired. Not sure why they didn't try something fresher and not rehashing the older songs? I kept waiting for something to bring me to my feet but it never happened.

So if you don't have the older DVD you'll enjoy this one thoroughly, but if you do have the older you may not want to waste your time on it unless you want the documentary which is very good!",1207353600,8,1166,4.393518518518518

3103396,5,B0013D8LP4,"After wearing out my copy of ""The Complex Live"" DVD I could only wonder ""How to be a Megastar Live"" would compare. It's AMAZING!
All the Blue Man traditions are there, ""Drumbone"", ""Time to Start"" and so on. However, they have added an even greater twist with the ""How to be a MegaStar"" instructional video that takes the Blue Man on a high energy rocking adventure.
Great new arrangements of songs like ""Sing Along"", and new songs ""Rock and Go"" and ""Light Suit"" just add to the excitement that is Blue Man Group.
The Video and CD are a great combo for any Blue Man fan. Get it, cause it's HOT!",1207094400,,593,4.351351351351352

I'm also a Mute Math fan, and there are many similarities in the way the two groups tackle a rock performance! As an audiophile, I must say, this is without question a 10 out of 10 on the Dolby Digital 5.1 audio.

I'd never heard of BMG (they are only now performing in Australia for the first time) but I absolutely loved the concept of these three innocents trying to make sense of their 'new' world accompanied by the most overblown rock band ever!

Unfortunately the content (but filmed at different concerts) of 'Complex Rock Tour' and 'How To Be A Megastar' is predominantly identical; maddeningly, one has elements that the other has, and vice-versa. So if you're obsessive, buy both; if not, flip a coin, then wait for some truly new material from these amazing talents.",1373068800,,632,4.962264150943396

I'd like to take them to the theater, but prices have doubled since then, they're $100 each, so this is a passable alternative to being there, especially if you have a large HDTV and a decent surround system.

3103469,2,B0013D8LP4,"I just saw the Blue Man Group in Vegas last week and was blown away!  This DVD just blows - perhaps that's a bit harsh.

I bought the DVD knowing it would be somewhat different as shows vary from city to city, year to year.  However, I had no idea that they would abandon what makes Blue Men so great. It's as if the producers of the DVD didn't have faith that the Blue Men could carry a DVD performance.

I was stunned when I saw the band at center stage and heard vocals.  Instead of a true Blue Man performance we got a rock concert by some seemingly anonymous group with the Blue Man bits sprinkled throughout. There was no singing at the Blue Man show in Vegas.  Only a computer generated narrator to supplement the performance art.

Short of it: this is not a true Blue Man Group performance.  However, I hope they produce one someday so I can share it with friends.",1334448000,,872,4.242424242424242
3103470,5,B0013D8LP4,"Christmas usually brings a few music CDs and DVDs and this year was no exception. One of the gifts was the ""Blue Man Group: The Complex Rock Tour LIVE"" DVD. I'd heard of the Blue Man Group and had seen a few brief clips on TV, but I'd never witnessed a full live performance. The DVD was very interesting, enjoyable and entertaining. I wrote up a review and submitted it to Amazon. The next time I got together with the fellow who gave it to me I thanked him and told him how much I had enjoyed it. He responded by lending me his copy of a second Blue Man Group DVD: ""How to be a Megastar LIVE.""

The ""Rock Tour"" and ""Megastar"" DVDs are very much alike. It's basically the same group of artists done up in very similar fashion and presenting very much the same material. Either presentation is excellent and I could give either a five-star rating were I not aware of the other. However, in viewing the two performances, I have a preference for the ""Rock Tour"" version and I will slant this review into trying to  explain my reasons. In both cases, the Group performs in a very large auditorium on a raised stage. On this stage, is a raised and tiered  superstructure holding the band members and singers. The Blue Man Group, three excellent and highly animated percussionists perform on the main stage level in front of the raised superstructure. The superstructure, I might add, is also the platform for a rather spectacular light show.

It's an excellent band in either DVD, but I'd say it's slightly larger and plays with more vigor in the ""Rock Tour"" DVD. The singers are either dispersed within the band or come down front on the level with the Blue Man Group. The singers are excellent with one exception. Annette Stean and her version of ""I Feel Love"" on the ""Rock Tour"" DVD could only be described as outstanding. A show stopper! Another singer sings a good, but lessor, version on  the ""Megastar"" DVD, but that DVD has part of the Stean version as extra material. Well, personally, I'd suggest that you somehow view and listen to Stean's dramatic version on the ""Rock Tour"" DVD if you ever get the chance. It's sensational! I'd have to say that both the light show and the band are better on the ""Rock Tour"" DVD, but the photography of the concert is better on ""Megastar.""

The Blue Man group itself performs down on the main stage with their strange variety of percussion instruments. Personally, I think the Blue Man act is better on the ""Rock Tour"" DVD. On the ""Megastar"" DVD there's just too much filler and some ""acting"" is little better than that characteristic of professional wrestling matches. It get a little tiring in places.

The Megastar"" DVD comes with a lot of somewhat interesting extra materials which true fans will like. Also, the ""Megastar"" DVD package come with a concert CD, which some might like for whatever purpose (like playing in the car, for example. So, I'm inclined to give the concert experience on the ""Megastar"" a four star rating and not quite up to the level of the ""Rock Tour"" DVD. However, the Megastar"" package contains more, and I think that deserves upping the rating to five stars. Hey! You can't go wrong with either one.

3103477,4,B0013D8LP4,This DVD was awesome. I have never seen the Blue Man Group before but heard alot about them. The creativity of this group is very good.

3103480,5,B0013D8LP4,"If you're a BMG fan you should get this DVD.  Although it's an updated version of the 2003 Complex Rock Tour, it contains many new songs and stunts.  Make sure you do the setup and select 5.1 sound...the default is for 2 channel stereo.  There are also several ""extras"" that were not only entertaining, but show many clips from the original Blue Man Group theatrical show.  The 3 BMG originators discuss the origin and philosophy of the BMG characters, and how they were developed and grew.  I missed Tracy Bonham and Venus Hum (who were on the Complex Tour)...but their replacements were great.  Another plus is the CD, which contains the soundtrack from Megastar...audio quality is really good...play it in your car....(loud)  And...as always......when you're watching the DVD, crank up the volume (especially if you have a quality 5.1 surround sound system and a nice flat screen TV.

3103498,2,B0013D8LP4,"Much of the same as the Complex DVD with a few extra songs, but inferior in every way.  The stage production dragged at some parts, the guess singer was not on par with the ones in the Complex, and the band wasn't as good as the West Coast band; it may have just been the sound production (they were in an arena vice their sound stage for this one).  I don't think any of the founding members were in this DVD.

Overall, if you're looking for a Blue Man Group DVD, get the Complex DVD, you'll get more enjoyment out of it.  If you have the Complex, don't get this, you'll be wasting your money.  Going to give my copy to a friend.  Final note, if you think you're getting a deal with the free CD, compare the list of singers on the Complex CD with this one and you'll see why this one is free.",1211932800,4,793,4.051282051282051

3103503,4,B0013D8LP4,"The Blue Man Group return to their rock concert experience in their latest DVD, captured during their ""How to Be a Megastar 2.0"" tour.  If you already own ""The Complex"" much of this material will be familiar as it nearly the same format as the group's previous rock concert tour.  That's not necessarily a bad thing.  As in ""The Complex,"" ""How to Be a Megastar"" opens with ""Above,"" which if you've seen/heard from ""The Complex"" you know is simply an amazing song.  The concert presentation is exciting, with a screen obscuring the stage and only shadows of the Blue Men projected on the screen as, one by one, each takes to their PVC instruments to begin the melody, with a swirling of images of the band and the Blue Men as the song launches into guitar, drums, keyboards, bass, and percussion in an explosive cresendo.  Awesome.  The remainder of ""How to Be a Megastar"" essentially follows the same progression as ""The Complex"" with some new material and new rock conert movements.  The premise of the tour is the Blue Men have purchased an ""updated"" rock concert experience manual from an infomercial and are incoporating the new material into the show.  The band is amazing, as it was before in ""The Complex.""  I miss the guest vocals of Tracy Bonham and Annette Strean of Venus Hum.  Annette was gorgeous and belted out an exciting cover of ""I Feel Love"" in her unique style in ""The Complex"" and is replaced on the current tour with a new vocalist.  She's fine, but it's hard to follow in the footsteps of Annette and Tracy.

Bonus material includes a music video for ""I Feel Love""; a piece of comedy called ""Mono Makes a Plea -- Save the TVs"" campaign (bemoaning the switch to digital signals which will effect us all...) and finally, and perhaps most importantly, a documentary called ""Inside the Tube.""  It features the founders of Blue Man (Phil Stanton, Chris Wink and Matt Goldman) as they discuss the group, the philosophy of the Blue Man and the evolution of Blue Man from a theatrical presentation to the rock concert experience of ""The Complex.""  It's a fascinating insight; Stanton, Wink and Goldman are extremely intelligent and creative individuals with a lot of passion for what they do.  As far as I know the documentary aired only on PBS during a fund raising drive, with the documentary being sold as an incentive gift for new PBS members.  If my memory is correct the documentary was being sold for a $75 contribution; now you can watch it for free!

If you already own ""The Complex"" and are on the fence about purchasing ""How to Be a Megastar,"" I would suggest it primarily for the documentary included in the DVD extras.  The DVD also includes a CD version of the concert, so for less than $20 you're getting a DVD and audio CD; a great deal.  If you are new to Blue Man I would recommend starting with ""<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Blue-Man-Group-The-Complex-Rock-Tour-Live/dp/B0000DBJ9P/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Blue Man Group - The Complex Rock Tour Live</a>"" to see what you think.

3103504,5,B0013D8LP4,THE BLUE MAN GROUP HOW TO BE A MEGASTAR TOUR 2.1 IS AN AMAZING PERFORMANCE. I GOT THE CHANCE TO SEE THEM LIVE IN MARCH WHEN THEY CAME TO MY HOMETOWN. ALL I CAN SAY IS WOW. GREAT ENTERTAINMENT.  AND I BOUGHT THIS DVD WITH CD THE DAY IT CAME OUT.  I CANT STOP LISTENING TO THE CD ON MY IPOD AND WATCHING THE DVD. MY FAVORITE SONG IS PERSONA.  THEY USE AN INSTRUMENT CALLED AIRPOLES WHICH ARE HOLLOW BOAT ANTENNAE MADE FROM FIBERGLASS AND ALSO A FAVORITE OF MINE IS CALLED ABOVE WHICH IS AN AMAZING OPENING SONG.,1207699200,,509,4.121212121212121
3103505,3,B0013D8LP4,"First off, I love the Blue Man Group.  The creativity, the maddening rhythms, the crushing guitars, all add up to one infectious musical marshmallow.  However, I was hoping that after ""The Complex"" Tour DVD, which I own, that Blue Man Group would step up and deliver the knockout punch to the senses that I could show proudly to my kids, or to a whole classroom of kids, and blow their collective minds.  Unfortunately, after the 5 years that has passed since the last DVD, not a lot has changed in their show (although it is updated in some of the dialogue and humor bits) and it is pretty much the same thing we saw on ""The Complex"" Tour DVD.  Right down to some of the gross-out gags, like the down-the-throat thing.  So, if you have the last live DVD, you might want to reconsider buying this one, especially if like me, you were hoping for a more ""G-Rated"" version.",1207526400,5,870,4.446540880503145
3103506,5,B0013D8LP4,"When Blue Man Group created a touring rock concert with The Complex, they recorded and released a DVD. It was, at best, a tease to get you to see the stage shows, since the tour ended about the same time. The DVD was horribly flawed. It wasn't mastered correctly as anamorphic widescreen, but rather it was letterboxed. The audio mix was questionable. There were visible compression artifacts. The exposure during dark parts of the show was poor, and they tried to compensate with bad video effects. The editing was terrible too, with visuals not matching audio, and countless shots of a lame crowd. This new DVD corrects all of that.

When the How To Be A Megastar tour launched three years later, the show had been heavily tweaked. Through five legs of the tour, changes were made at least three times, and various performers came and went. The last iteration of the tour is what's represented on this DVD (and CD), and it's easily the tightest version of it.

Almost the entire show is represented, with a lively crowd and a great performance by the excellent band. The arena experience is captured with a lot of great wide shots, including a camera in the ""crappy seats,"" to give you an idea of how ""big"" the show feels. The scope is much bigger than the fixed theatrical shows, though many of the same comedic bits are shared.

The video clips for the ""Megastar"" manual are included here, played by Fred Armisen of Saturday Night Live fame, as well as the Floppie the Banjo Clown clips.

Peter Moore is the male vocalist for the show. He sang on several of the recorded tracks for The Complex, and on the original tour. The guy is all-pro and has a bit of a rockstar quality. He left the tour shortly after this show to pursue a solo record. Adrian Hartley is the female vocalist, who replaced Tracy Bonham during one of the interim tour legs. She gets a lot of crap for little reason other than not being Bonham, but she's capable on most of the songs. ""I Feel Love"" was delivered on The Complex tour (and recording) with Annette Strean from Venus Hum (who also opened on that tour), and admittedly it's hard to stack up against her pipes. The absence of Bonham also means that they have no violinist for ""Baba O'Riley,"" but I maintain that it's just different, not better or worse.

As I said, the music is a lot tighter throughout the show. Where we were once left with just the Blue Man Voiceover guy, the band plays. Several pieces from the theatrical show are therefore worked in to the show, and it flows more like a Top 40 radio station than an orchestra concert with an intermission. It keeps the energy level up. We get some fresh arrangements on a number of songs as well, and Moore and Hartley complement each other well. ""Sing Along"" in particular is given a Mexican feel (if Mexican music used air poles), complete with the horn section from a Mariachi band. Newer pieces like the adaptation of the wire man routine from the stage shows, in this case ""Light Suits,"" drive toward the fake ending, and the newer song ""Rock and Go"" really capture the old fashioned rock concert finale the way few ""real"" rock concerts do.

The special features include the original ""I Fell Love"" (with Strean from Venus Hum) and a video piece that was dropped mid-tour, with Armisen assuming the role of ""Mono"" with a guitarist called ""The Side"" (like U2, get it?). He makes his plea for saving old CRT TV's. It's followed by the TV routine made famous in the stage shows.

They've also included the documentary ""Inside The Tube"" from PBS. It has been edited slightly for the DVD. For example, the original program had a bit where they showed video for the light suits, something they were ""working on,"" but has since been worked into this tour and also some of the stage shows. The biggest benefit here is that you don't have to sit through half-hour intermissions of PBS asking for money.

The CD is really the icing on the cake. Just as the iTunes-only release of the stage show from The Venetian, you get an appreciation for how good the band is live. My only complaint is that seem to mix the giant bass drum too low, which is odd because the show is so much about percussion.

Overall, this is the video that I think Blue Man Group fans have been waiting for, for a long time. My hope is that it's also a turning point, because much of this material has been around now for a lot of years, and I think fans are dying for something new. What we've seen to this point has been more of an evolution than anything else. At this point, they need something new.",1207526400,39,4560,4.497584541062802
3103507,2,B0013D8LP4,"Caught this on HDNET today. Watching it in HD was great, but its 99% the same as Complex Rock Tour. Venus Hum was replaced with some other lady. Song Arrangement was almost the same as well. The guy who sings Will You Sing Along and a few of the others is the same as last time. I won't waste my money on this, But I will tell me DVR to keep it around. I was hoping for a new show.. no luck. Although i will admit, the DVD concerts are NOTHING compared to seeing them at the permanent locations!  Do it if you get the change, Their Permanent Emplacement shows are INCREDIBLE. Instead of being relegated to a ground floor stage, they build a entire complex of stages. ones very high up from the ground, etc to use some very large PVC instruments. I'd guess up to 30-50ft long. Resulting in very deep tones.",1207440000,5,805,4.2272727272727275

So if you don't have the older DVD you'll enjoy this one thoroughly, but if you do have the older you may not want to waste your time on it unless you want the documentary which is very good!",1207353600,8,1166,4.393518518518518

Great new arrangements of songs like ""Sing Along"", and new songs ""Rock and Go"" and ""Light Suit"" just add to the excitement that is Blue Man Group.

I bought the DVD knowing it would be somewhat different as shows vary from city to city, year to year.  However, I had no idea that they would abandon what makes Blue Men so great. It's as if the producers of the DVD didn't have faith that the Blue Men could carry a DVD performance.

I was stunned when I saw the band at center stage and heard vocals.  Instead of a true Blue Man performance we got a rock concert by some seemingly anonymous group with the Blue Man bits sprinkled throughout. There was no singing at the Blue Man show in Vegas.  Only a computer generated narrator to supplement the performance art.

Short of it: this is not a true Blue Man Group performance.  However, I hope they produce one someday so I can share it with friends.",1334448000,,872,4.242424242424242
3337967,5,B0013D8LP4,"Christmas usually brings a few music CDs and DVDs and this year was no exception. One of the gifts was the ""Blue Man Group: The Complex Rock Tour LIVE"" DVD. I'd heard of the Blue Man Group and had seen a few brief clips on TV, but I'd never witnessed a full live performance. The DVD was very interesting, enjoyable and entertaining. I wrote up a review and submitted it to Amazon. The next time I got together with the fellow who gave it to me I thanked him and told him how much I had enjoyed it. He responded by lending me his copy of a second Blue Man Group DVD: ""How to be a Megastar LIVE.""

The ""Rock Tour"" and ""Megastar"" DVDs are very much alike. It's basically the same group of artists done up in very similar fashion and presenting very much the same material. Either presentation is excellent and I could give either a five-star rating were I not aware of the other. However, in viewing the two performances, I have a preference for the ""Rock Tour"" version and I will slant this review into trying to  explain my reasons. In both cases, the Group performs in a very large auditorium on a raised stage. On this stage, is a raised and tiered  superstructure holding the band members and singers. The Blue Man Group, three excellent and highly animated percussionists perform on the main stage level in front of the raised superstructure. The superstructure, I might add, is also the platform for a rather spectacular light show.

It's an excellent band in either DVD, but I'd say it's slightly larger and plays with more vigor in the ""Rock Tour"" DVD. The singers are either dispersed within the band or come down front on the level with the Blue Man Group. The singers are excellent with one exception. Annette Stean and her version of ""I Feel Love"" on the ""Rock Tour"" DVD could only be described as outstanding. A show stopper! Another singer sings a good, but lessor, version on  the ""Megastar"" DVD, but that DVD has part of the Stean version as extra material. Well, personally, I'd suggest that you somehow view and listen to Stean's dramatic version on the ""Rock Tour"" DVD if you ever get the chance. It's sensational! I'd have to say that both the light show and the band are better on the ""Rock Tour"" DVD, but the photography of the concert is better on ""Megastar.""

The Blue Man group itself performs down on the main stage with their strange variety of percussion instruments. Personally, I think the Blue Man act is better on the ""Rock Tour"" DVD. On the ""Megastar"" DVD there's just too much filler and some ""acting"" is little better than that characteristic of professional wrestling matches. It get a little tiring in places.

The Megastar"" DVD comes with a lot of somewhat interesting extra materials which true fans will like. Also, the ""Megastar"" DVD package come with a concert CD, which some might like for whatever purpose (like playing in the car, for example. So, I'm inclined to give the concert experience on the ""Megastar"" a four star rating and not quite up to the level of the ""Rock Tour"" DVD. However, the Megastar"" package contains more, and I think that deserves upping the rating to five stars. Hey! You can't go wrong with either one.

3338000,4,B0013D8LP4,"The Blue Man Group return to their rock concert experience in their latest DVD, captured during their ""How to Be a Megastar 2.0"" tour.  If you already own ""The Complex"" much of this material will be familiar as it nearly the same format as the group's previous rock concert tour.  That's not necessarily a bad thing.  As in ""The Complex,"" ""How to Be a Megastar"" opens with ""Above,"" which if you've seen/heard from ""The Complex"" you know is simply an amazing song.  The concert presentation is exciting, with a screen obscuring the stage and only shadows of the Blue Men projected on the screen as, one by one, each takes to their PVC instruments to begin the melody, with a swirling of images of the band and the Blue Men as the song launches into guitar, drums, keyboards, bass, and percussion in an explosive cresendo.  Awesome.  The remainder of ""How to Be a Megastar"" essentially follows the same progression as ""The Complex"" with some new material and new rock conert movements.  The premise of the tour is the Blue Men have purchased an ""updated"" rock concert experience manual from an infomercial and are incoporating the new material into the show.  The band is amazing, as it was before in ""The Complex.""  I miss the guest vocals of Tracy Bonham and Annette Strean of Venus Hum.  Annette was gorgeous and belted out an exciting cover of ""I Feel Love"" in her unique style in ""The Complex"" and is replaced on the current tour with a new vocalist.  She's fine, but it's hard to follow in the footsteps of Annette and Tracy.

Bonus material includes a music video for ""I Feel Love""; a piece of comedy called ""Mono Makes a Plea -- Save the TVs"" campaign (bemoaning the switch to digital signals which will effect us all...) and finally, and perhaps most importantly, a documentary called ""Inside the Tube.""  It features the founders of Blue Man (Phil Stanton, Chris Wink and Matt Goldman) as they discuss the group, the philosophy of the Blue Man and the evolution of Blue Man from a theatrical presentation to the rock concert experience of ""The Complex.""  It's a fascinating insight; Stanton, Wink and Goldman are extremely intelligent and creative individuals with a lot of passion for what they do.  As far as I know the documentary aired only on PBS during a fund raising drive, with the documentary being sold as an incentive gift for new PBS members.  If my memory is correct the documentary was being sold for a $75 contribution; now you can watch it for free!

If you already own ""The Complex"" and are on the fence about purchasing ""How to Be a Megastar,"" I would suggest it primarily for the documentary included in the DVD extras.  The DVD also includes a CD version of the concert, so for less than $20 you're getting a DVD and audio CD; a great deal.  If you are new to Blue Man I would recommend starting with ""<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Blue-Man-Group-The-Complex-Rock-Tour-Live/dp/B0000DBJ9P/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Blue Man Group - The Complex Rock Tour Live</a>"" to see what you think.

However, I was hoping that after ""The Complex"" Tour DVD, which I own, that Blue Man Group would step up and deliver the knockout punch to the senses that I could show proudly to my kids, or to a whole classroom of kids, and blow their collective minds.  Unfortunately, after the 5 years that has passed since the last DVD, not a lot has changed in their show (although it is updated in some of the dialogue and humor bits) and it is pretty much the same thing we saw on ""The Complex"" Tour DVD.  Right down to some of the gross-out gags, like the down-the-throat thing.  So, if you have the last live DVD, you might want to reconsider buying this one, especially if like me, you were hoping for a more ""G-Rated"" version.",1207526400,5,870,4.446540880503145
3338003,5,B0013D8LP4,"When Blue Man Group created a touring rock concert with The Complex, they recorded and released a DVD. It was, at best, a tease to get you to see the stage shows, since the tour ended about the same time. The DVD was horribly flawed. It wasn't mastered correctly as anamorphic widescreen, but rather it was letterboxed. The audio mix was questionable. There were visible compression artifacts. The exposure during dark parts of the show was poor, and they tried to compensate with bad video effects. The editing was terrible too, with visuals not matching audio, and countless shots of a lame crowd. This new DVD corrects all of that.

When the How To Be A Megastar tour launched three years later, the show had been heavily tweaked. Through five legs of the tour, changes were made at least three times, and various performers came and went. The last iteration of the tour is what's represented on this DVD (and CD), and it's easily the tightest version of it.

Almost the entire show is represented, with a lively crowd and a great performance by the excellent band. The arena experience is captured with a lot of great wide shots, including a camera in the ""crappy seats,"" to give you an idea of how ""big"" the show feels. The scope is much bigger than the fixed theatrical shows, though many of the same comedic bits are shared.

The video clips for the ""Megastar"" manual are included here, played by Fred Armisen of Saturday Night Live fame, as well as the Floppie the Banjo Clown clips.

Peter Moore is the male vocalist for the show. He sang on several of the recorded tracks for The Complex, and on the original tour. The guy is all-pro and has a bit of a rockstar quality. He left the tour shortly after this show to pursue a solo record. Adrian Hartley is the female vocalist, who replaced Tracy Bonham during one of the interim tour legs. She gets a lot of crap for little reason other than not being Bonham, but she's capable on most of the songs. ""I Feel Love"" was delivered on The Complex tour (and recording) with Annette Strean from Venus Hum (who also opened on that tour), and admittedly it's hard to stack up against her pipes. The absence of Bonham also means that they have no violinist for ""Baba O'Riley,"" but I maintain that it's just different, not better or worse.

As I said, the music is a lot tighter throughout the show. Where we were once left with just the Blue Man Voiceover guy, the band plays. Several pieces from the theatrical show are therefore worked in to the show, and it flows more like a Top 40 radio station than an orchestra concert with an intermission. It keeps the energy level up. We get some fresh arrangements on a number of songs as well, and Moore and Hartley complement each other well. ""Sing Along"" in particular is given a Mexican feel (if Mexican music used air poles), complete with the horn section from a Mariachi band. Newer pieces like the adaptation of the wire man routine from the stage shows, in this case ""Light Suits,"" drive toward the fake ending, and the newer song ""Rock and Go"" really capture the old fashioned rock concert finale the way few ""real"" rock concerts do.

The special features include the original ""I Fell Love"" (with Strean from Venus Hum) and a video piece that was dropped mid-tour, with Armisen assuming the role of ""Mono"" with a guitarist called ""The Side"" (like U2, get it?). He makes his plea for saving old CRT TV's. It's followed by the TV routine made famous in the stage shows.

They've also included the documentary ""Inside The Tube"" from PBS. It has been edited slightly for the DVD. For example, the original program had a bit where they showed video for the light suits, something they were ""working on,"" but has since been worked into this tour and also some of the stage shows. The biggest benefit here is that you don't have to sit through half-hour intermissions of PBS asking for money.

The CD is really the icing on the cake. Just as the iTunes-only release of the stage show from The Venetian, you get an appreciation for how good the band is live. My only complaint is that seem to mix the giant bass drum too low, which is odd because the show is so much about percussion.

Overall, this is the video that I think Blue Man Group fans have been waiting for, for a long time. My hope is that it's also a turning point, because much of this material has been around now for a lot of years, and I think fans are dying for something new. What we've seen to this point has been more of an evolution than anything else. At this point, they need something new.",1207526400,39,4560,4.497584541062802

I won't waste my money on this, But I will tell me DVR to keep it around. I was hoping for a new show.. no luck. Although i will admit, the DVD concerts are NOTHING compared to seeing them at the permanent locations!  Do it if you get the change, Their Permanent Emplacement shows are INCREDIBLE.

8250027,3,B0013D8LP4,"I have seen the Blue Man Group in Vegas, Chicago and Slat Lake City on a concert tour. The Vegas show was the best when I saw it. It is now shown in a different casino now so it may have changed. I don't care much for the concert tour format, which is what this DVD is. I also don't like ""live recordings"" with audience noise and prefer live attendance more.

I loved the music and the theatrical aspect most which is what made them famous with the special effects and funny skits.

I watched this DVD once and may never watch it again.",1427587200,,536,4.144230769230769
