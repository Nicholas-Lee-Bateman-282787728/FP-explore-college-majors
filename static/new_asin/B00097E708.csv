8058029,3,B00097E708,"I bought this film simply because I discovered that Carmen Maura was in it.

Other reviewers have provided a good synopsis of the movie so no need for a repeat.

I will only add that I thought this movie was a bit long and possibly due to her role and/or dialogue I did not feel the magic that I usually do when watching Carmen Maura perform. She is one of my favorite actresses but this movie lacked somewhat.

If an unknown actress played this role the film would probably not be worth seeing. Carmen helped make the movie work but I felt as though this role pulled her down.",1306972800,,577,4.275229357798165
8058030,3,B00097E708,"A Spanish ""thriller"" that lacks thrills but is a well played story.  The film itself is visually compellling, the acting above mediocre, but the plot rather thin.

No Alfred Hitchcock, and certainly not memorable, this film, La Promesa is an okay way to spend 2 forgettable hours.",1216857600,2,280,4.9361702127659575
8058031,5,B00097E708,"This is an excellent psychological thriller from Spain. It stars the veteran Carmen Maura, one of Spain's finest actresses. Maura plays a meek, overly religious housewife who has lived for years under the thumb of an abusive husband. One day she cracks, sticks a knife in him, packs her bags and flees to Galicia. There she befriends a little boy whom she saves from being run over by a truck. His grateful mother gives her a job as their housemaid. More than a little unhinged, constantly praying and talking to God, she believes the child and mother are being tormented by the authoritarian father. After all, aren't all men the same? Urged on by unseen voices, she takes it upon herself to save the family. Will it end with murder? Half the time we can't be sure what we're seeing is true or a product of her crazed mind. It is wonderfully riveting. Savour the multiple twists at the end. Deliciously warped.

""La Promesa"" was shot in the picturesque province of Galicia on the northwestern coast of Spain. The photography lovingly captures its verdant green hills, azure blue seas, towering cliffs, dark woods and rolling mists. TLA Releasing has produced an excellent DVD with the film transferred in its original 2.35:1 widescreen (enhanced for widescreen TV). The picture quality is splendid with bright vibrant colors, good blacks levels and natural skintones. The source print is pristine with no dirt or defects to speak of. Sound is in the original Spanish 2.0 stereo or Dolby 5.1 remix. Optional English subtitles are provided. There is a 19 minute long ""Making Of' featurette, the original theatrical trailer and four other trailers of TLA releases. Thoroughly enjoyable and warmly recommended.",1120953600,4,1707,4.968531468531468
8058032,5,B00097E708,"Some of the most intellectually terrifying films, stories that are imbued with religious symbolism, mysticism, and surrealism, are products of Spanish filmmakers and LA PROMESA is no exception.  Writer/Director H&eacute;ctor Carr&eacute; finds just the right amount of credibility in the prelude to his psychological thriller to make the following strange events teeter on that thin line of delusion and reality.

Gregoria (the redoubtable Carmen Maura) is a fragile woman, married to an abusive, unfaithful husband Roberto (Juan Francisco Margallo) and is confined to her house by order of her husband  who taunts her for being barren. She is fanatically religious, obsessive compulsive, and walking closely to the abyss of insanity.  Strange visions and incidents happen: in one instance she witness the fall of a housepainter who despite a fracture of the skull tells Gregoria of his perfect little hometown in Galicia, a story that opens Gregoria's hopes for a better life.  How she manages to depart her miserable life for Galicia involves an incident with her husband that for the sake of the viewers needs to remain occult.

In Galicia she changes her name to Celia, saves a small boy Daniel (Santiago Bar&oacute;n) from an accident, and because of her courageous act observed by the boy's mother Dorita (Ana Fern&aacute;ndez) she is invited to the palatial estate where she ultimately gains employment as a maid and nanny - with some reservations from the boy's father Leandro (Evaristo Calvo) who sees Celia's dark side.  Celia and Daniel become devoted to each other and Daniel introduces Celia to the strange 'hauntings' of the house and community and reveals the strained relationship of his parents. Also in the mansion Celia meets the cook Felisa (Luisa Merelas) and gardener Sen&eacute;n (Julio Lago) who watch Celia with suspicion.

Daniel leads Celia to a mysterious church where Celia explains the saints, prays, and witnesses bizarre happenings.  Always returning to this gothic church for solace Celia begins observing problems in her new 'home' and gradually her love for Daniel makes her mind bend around ridding the child of his parents, thus making Daniel her own child.  Finally her sanity breaks and she is involved in murderous acts that are not what they appear to be.  To say more would disrupt the story of how a deranged mind mixes delusions and actions to gain resolution to defaced dreams.

As Gregoria/Celia, Carmen Maura again demonstrates the brilliance of her acting career. She makes us love this deranged, pitiful character while maintaining an atmosphere of madness and threat.  The entire cast weaves in and out of this maze of reality/delusion and Director Carr&eacute; manages to keep us confused about what we are watching in an extraordinary stance of the how the dysfunctional mind works.  The settings are lovely, and the old church is terrifyingly beautiful with all lighting coming form tall tapers and votives and otherworldly light as captured by cinematographer Juan Carlos G&oacute;mez.  The musical score by Suso Rey and Manuel Varela enhances the mood of the piece with compositions that could easily stand alone.  This is not an easy film to watch, not because of violence (though there is some), but because Carr&eacute; never lets us know the exact truth of what we are watching: is this all in Celia's broken mind, is it real, is the story really happening, etc?  Highly recommended for lovers of Gothic tales.  Grady Harp, June 05",1119744000,6,3490,5.157801418439717
