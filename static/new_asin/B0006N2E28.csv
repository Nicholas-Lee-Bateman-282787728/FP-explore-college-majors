The other comments on this posting sound more like jealous comments or people that did not take her advice regarding pacing and stretching.  If you hurt yourself, take a look at you own self before you blame others.  How are you warming up, how are you pacing, how are you cooling down, etc.?  She is very clear in this that you need to do things based upon your own ability.

FYI - she was an All American runner....so I would heed her advice.",1371859200,,681,4.31496062992126

8041906,5,B0006N2E28,"In this well-produced, fully-chaptered workout, Shari begins with a 5-minute warm-up and stretch, then leads two other exercisers through a 20-minute intermediate step workout (A-steps, V-steps, straddling the bench, knee lifts, etc.) She concludes the cardio portion of the workout with a five-minute cool down.  This is followed by a great 20-minute all-over body toning routine (abs, triceps, glutes), then a five-minute stretch.  I found the music to be motivating and the instructor warm and encouraging.  All-in-all, this was a solid 45-minute workout!",1182988800,2,558,5.698795180722891
8041907,1,B0006N2E28,"This video is not as beneficial as Shari claims it to be. In my opinion, it is an enormous waste of money. Shari has admitted to having serious orthopedic problems with both her feet and back. Obviously, her injuries are the result of unsound fitness practices. She really needs to invest in a better education in her self-proclaimed area of expertise. It is not very surprising that her only positive review was written by herself!!!!!",1136678400,2,436,4.826666666666667
8041908,1,B0006N2E28,"I have heard it from the horses mouth, Shari wrote her own review, which is the only review on this site.  How can you trust someone who writes their own review?!  Sickening!",1128211200,3,174,4.40625
8041909,5,B0006N2E28,"It is a shame that someone out of spite has tried to make this very well done exercise DVD sound so bad.  I think this DVD is great and someone is either jealous, or can't recognize hard work because they can't achieve her physique.

There are a lot of great moves and it is obvious when you see it that it is a lot of fun.  Don't miss this DVD, I am sure you will enjoy it and benefit from it.  She really takes the time to explain proper moves and safety.  Thanks for this DVD!",1107216000,6,479,3.9479166666666665
