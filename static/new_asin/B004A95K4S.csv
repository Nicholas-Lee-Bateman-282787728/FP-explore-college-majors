8419806,5,B004A95K4S,"This live worship experience DVD is stellar from first song to last.  The original music heard and shown here sticks with you long after the screen goes dark.  Harmonies and song melodies are engaging, fresh and well recorded.  Many of these songs could stand alone or be described as worship ""hits.""  I watch this again and again whenever I want to be part of an uplifting worship and praise service.",1404000000,,401,4.685714285714286
8419807,5,B004A95K4S,Brian Doerksen needs no rating as he is beyond the need :) Once again he's written and performed such soul stirring music! Only this time he's added personal stories to inspire and bring love and light!,1356998400,,202,4.638888888888889
8419808,5,B004A95K4S,This dvd touches everyone who sees it!  You see how intimate worship can be and the variety of ways we can worship and how people's lives are touched by the gift of JESUS through GOD's grace!  This is fellowhip and worship and communion at its best!  You need to see this for yourself.  I cant do it justice.,1325462400,,308,4.258620689655173
