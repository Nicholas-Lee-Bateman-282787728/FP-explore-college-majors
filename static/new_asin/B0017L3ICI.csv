OY-SAMA (Miss Oy)
(1951, Japan, 94 min, b/w, English subtitles, Aspect ratio: 4:3, Audio: Mono)
Mizoguchis first film for Daiei certainly wasn't one from the heart. He really wanted to do The Life of Oharu, but he did Oy-sama as a favor to his long-time producer (and Daiei board member) Nagata Masaichi and his old primary school pal Kawaguchi Matsutar who provided the original treatment (an adaptation of the famous Tanizaki Junichir novella Ashikari [1932]) for screenwriter Yoda Yoshikata to work on. Furthermore, the studio vetoed Mizoguchis initial desires to retain Tanizakis original flashback structure and the novellas original title, and also insisted Tanaka Kuniyo be cast in a role at least 20 years younger than she was in real life. Alien material, narrative interference and miss-casting all prevailing, its perhaps surprising that the final result is so accomplished, the limitations transcended by careful re-writing, meticulous mise-en-scne and phenomenal camerawork which turn a perverse domestic situation into a weighty meditation on unrequited love. Furthermore, with the exploration of a woman sacrificing herself for others, the presentation of the over-bearing strictures of patriarchal society, and the emphasis on male indecision, Mizoguchis thematic universe is presented so thoroughly that one would never guess the directors mind was really elsewhere at the time.

The films central perverse love triangle is set in Mizoguchis favorite Meiji era (1868-1912) and concerns the daughter of a rich Kyt-based family named Oshizu (Otowa Nobuko) who agrees to marry a successful carpenter Shinnosuke (Hori Yji) knowing that he really wants to marry her sister-in-law Oy (Tanaka), and thinking that Oy in turn likes him back. Oshizu insists her marriage be in name only and that she and her husband remain as siblings just so that Oy can remain happy. Oys husband has died, but her son continues to tie her to Oshizus family. She is not free to re-marry and society dictates she maintain a blank to protect the family honor. She lives a life of luxury, but is cut off from real emotion except for the sister-love she feels for Oshizu. Oy has resisted Oshizu marrying any suitor before because she doesnt want to be left alone. Seeing Oy and Shinnosuke liking each other Oshizu sees her chance to make everyone happy except of course herself. It is a situation that can only end in unhappiness for all, especially as Oy only belatedly realizes Shinnosuke has been burning a torch for her from the very beginning. Oshizus wrong-headed sacrifice for her family (who want to marry her off) and for Oy casts her as a typical Mizoguchi heroine who thinks nothing of throwing away her life so that others can be happy.

Also as per usual with this director, it is male vacillation and indecision that leads to Oshizus suffering. Shinnosuke has to be perhaps the weakest male in any Mizoguchi film I have seen. He just cant be honest with his own emotions and tell Oy his real feelings for her. He has the chance to early on when he rescues her from the sun and takes her into his friends house, laying her down and visably resisting the impulse to kiss and fondle her as she lays passed out. When she comes to she tries to convince him to marry Oshizu unaware that she has just been mentally raped, and he weakly allows himself to agree simply because it is what Oy most wants. He has to declare his feelings for Oy right here. Then she would see the foolishness in pushing him to marry Oshizu and perhaps (if she reciprocates his feeling) even see a way of committing to him long term herself once her son has grown up and she is free from the family. But no, Shinnosuke gives no sign and allows himself to be pushed into a love-less marriage so that he can be near Oy, but of course without her knowing his real feelings for her. Through not being honest with his own emotions and in submitting to marriage Shinnosuke not only destroys Oshizu, but also both Oy and himself as the film eventually demonstrates.

Personally, men in Mizoguchi films are usually weak and in this film especially so, but it is the over-arching patriarchy of society which exerts the biggest suffering, and here the biggest victim of all is Oy. She is imprisoned by her in-laws and while the trappings of domestic luxury make things comfortable along with her son and the relationship with Oshizu, she is not free to choose her own life. When the family sees she is spending too much time with Oshizu and Shinnosuke a scandal ensues and the sons death is taken as a welcome excuse by the family to get rid of her. Shinnosukes real feelings for her finally made known to her by Oshizu, she has no choice but go back to her village. There her brother proves less than welcoming and instantly marries her off for money to a rich sak merchant who we never see but we hear is a womanizer who never stays at home and gives no domestic comfort. The films final scene makes clear she has been emotionally destroyed by the patriarchy to which she has always had to bow. It is only the receipt of Shinnosuke and Oshizus baby which rescues her and gives her reason to live. In a patriarchy women must either be mothers or sex objects and the film graphically shows what happens when a woman is neither. She is passed from man to man as mere chattel to be used and abused as they see fit. Emancipated from patriarchy and Oy would be free and well within limits for Shinnosuke to approach from the beginning. But then there would be no story, Mizoguchi structuring his film in a way which clearly shows how all the characters are victims of a patriarchy dictating how they must behave at all times. The attack may not be as cuttingly 'social realist' as it is in saka Elegy and Sisters of the Gion (both 1936), but it remains omnipresent and very much central to Mizoguchis worldview as demonstrated by the even more devastating The Life of Oharu made the following year. There, the womans destruction at the hands of patriarchy is total.

Further emphasizing Mizoguchis questioning of patriarchy is the way Oy is depicted throughout the film as a typical Heian lady. The Heian period (794-1185) is known as a time of artistic and cultural sophistication centered in Kyt in which women had unprecedented freedom in Japanese history. This was the time of Lady Murasaki and her novel (reputed to be the worlds first) The Tale of Genji. It was then that sophisticated gagaku court music was developed, the koto especially dating from this time. Mizoguchi filters his visual presentation of Oy through the admiring eyes of Shinnosuke who is portrayed as a sophisticated man much enamored of traditional Japanese culture. There are six scenes in which Oy is presented through his eyes and the gliding camerawork emphasizes the rapture with which he beholds her as well as the rapture with which Mizoguchi recreates the Heian atmosphere. This is felt especially in the first two scenes which depict courtly ceremonial events, the first being an outdoor tea ceremony party in a park presented in a series of tracks and pans which create the effect ofa scroll painting opening steadily, so that we expect all that lies in the individual characters line of sight to unfold before us in due time (McDonald). The viewer of course is Shinnosuke as he mistakes Oy for his possible bride to be Oshizu. His desire swells rapturously as he gazes through the trees and the composition of the party sitting on the grass dwarfed by an enormous parasol which squeezes them into the bottom of the camera frame particularly suggests a courtly atmosphere. The second scene stamps the Heian connection very explicitly as Oy (dressed in a Heian-style kimono and wearing hair down her back to her waist) gives a koto recital, the burning of incense and shots of a calligraphy set and a vase all emphasizing high courtly culture. Tracks and pans here give way to cut-aways showing Oy playing behind screens always partially obscured as if from Shinnosukes (and Mizoguchis) idealizing eyes. Audience reaction shots emphasize the very special nature of the event. The central scenes between the three characters brings Oy down to earth (especially the third which presents Shinnosukes botched chance to declare himself to her), but she remains a courtly Heian lady until the end of the film. In the fourth meeting the three get out of a pleasure boat typically used by the Heian aristocracy and in the very last scene where Shinnosuke observes Oy again playing the koto before leaving his baby we notice the building is reminiscent of the shinden style (used by Heian court nobles) and again her courtly kimono and her sophisticated koto which Mizoguchis camera pans down as she reads Shinnosukes letter. There is irony here in that Oys Heian lady evokes the idea of female emancipation, but actually she is as imprisoned here by patriarchy as she was at the beginning of the film in Kyt.

What gives this film its tremendous power is the way Mizoguchi universalizes his story, making the central triangle emblematic of natural emotions felt by everyone in a way which cuts across both time and culture in a meditation on the implacable unchangeable nature of the human condition. Every man knows about unrequited love, every sister knows how feelings of a sibling are easily hurt, and every woman knows the difficulties of surviving patriarchy. Most Asian societies are arranged like this to this very day, and in the West women have only really started to wake up to their new freedoms within the last century and are still not totally emancipated. The universal application of the films central story is reflected in the visual scheme of the film with its use of day and night, summer and winter, and with a particular emphasis on water and its connotations both positive and negative. The first two scenes of the film which reflect Shinnosukes aroused passion for Oy are set at the height of summer with shade and tea offered as relief in the first, and the koto music offered in the second. His third encounter with Oy is rendered with her caught in the sun as she passes out through lack of water. In the ensuing scene Shinnosuke has the chance to declare himself to her (to give her water), but the chance is spurned and from the moment he agrees to marry Oshizu the water takes on dangerous threatening connotations. In the fourth meeting (shot at night) there is a walk along the lakeside full of hidden menace and potential disaster. Shinnosuke and Oy are left alone and wondering about Oshizu who is found standing by a pond possibly contemplating suicide. Then in the fifth scene where the three finally break up, the scene is announced with a low camera shot of water dripping menacingly in a pond to suggest the approaching crisis, and then the sound of a boat leaving (taking Oy away if not physically yet then at least mentally). The breakfast scene where it is announced Oy actually has left is followed immediately by a high shot of a beach with waves crashing in and Shinnosuke wandering down to the waterline. Again physical suicide is twinned with emotional destruction. After Oys departure the couple move to Tky and their house is shown as standing next to a swamp (sick water) as we see his failed business reflected in his poor house. Finally, after Oshizus death in childbirth, his observance of Oy giving her koto recital in courtly splendor takes place over a pond across which maids have to find the baby he has left, and then in the films coda he arrives on a boat late one evening and wanders off in the reeds of a swamp to die singing the same noh song (another connection to court life, but not of the Heian period  noh came later in the late 14th century) he sang with Oy in an earlier scene and which we heard over the opening credits which is about ill-fated love. Water that initially offered the promise of life in the blinding light of the summer sun finally promises death in the spooky light of the winter moon. Keiko I. McDonald notes the theatricality of the films concluding coda and especially Mizoguchis connection with shinpa, one which was life-long. Here he reaches through the immediate story at hand and expresses with great subtlety the tragic nature of the human condition in a way which is truly breathtaking.

8266313,5,B0017L3ICI,"Kenji Mizoguchi's movie 'Miss Oyu' is simply masterful. It is based on a short story (The reed cutter) by Junichiro Tanizaki. But, while the motives and the emotions of the protagonists in the short story are sometimes rather ambiguous, they are totally purified in the screenplay.
The protagonists exemplify traditional family roles and are confronted with these traditions, like in this movie a widow with children. She cannot remarry, because she must stay in her husband's family home to raise her children.

The main topic of the movie is forbidden love, and more generally the impossibility of being happy in this world, which are very characteristic themes in Kenji Mizoguchi's films.
The film illustrates also some typical aspects of J. Tanizaki's work, like the 'physical' (facial) influence of a mother on the future emotional life of her son, or the fear of scandal and of losing one's face in society.

This film shines through the purity and the intensity of the emotions of the protagonists (hidden for a long time, they erupt violently), through the marvelous performances of the actors and through its forceful message about the all importance of love.
A must see.",1372291200,,1180,5.077319587628866
