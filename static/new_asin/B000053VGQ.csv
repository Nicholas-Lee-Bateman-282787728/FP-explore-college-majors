7930371,1,B000053VGQ,"This movie is for the average Joe, who doesn't mind watching an average martial arts flick. This is so uncharacteristic in style and performance of Chang Yi. Very poor, lame performance, bordering on stupid. Wang Tao and the great Delong Tam also was out of there normal sophisticated style of performances. I think the director of this movie was very inexperienced and had no depth or conscise story line or screenplay knowledge. Wang Tao, Delong Tam and Chang Yi, in later years went on to do greater movies nonetheless, but this flick does not do them any favors.

My idea of a great Chang Yi movie would be Shaolin Mystagogue. My idea of a great Delong Tam movie would be Snake Crane Secret. My idea of a great Wang Tao movie would be Secret Rivals pt. 1.  Again, this flick is nonsense and is not your typical Chang, Wang and Delong...!",1179360000,,841,4.562913907284768
7930372,3,B000053VGQ,"CHALLENGE OF DEATH (1978) is a follow-up (but not a sequel) to THE HOT, THE COOL AND THE VICIOUS (1976) and reunites the two stars and director of that film for a similarly styled tale of kung fu opponents who wind up working together to root out shadowy criminal activity protected by powerful higher-ups. While the earlier film dealt with counterfeiting in a remote Chinese town, this one deals with weapons being smuggled to local warlords during the Chinese civil war of the early 20th century.
Tan Tao Liang (aka Delon Tam) again plays a character named Captain Lu while Wong Tao plays a gambler whose ex-girlfriend is a broker for the shadowy weapons supplier, making Wong useful to Captain Lu as a way of infiltrating the operation. Tan is a dragon fist expert (and high kicker) and Wong is a snake fist fighter; when their elusive enemy turns out to be a spider fist expert, they realize they have to combine their skills in order to beat him. The film's story moves along well and serves as an excellent showcase for the talents of its three fighting stars (the third is Chang Yi as the main villain). Director Lee Tso Nam made a string of highly-regarded kung fu films in Taiwan in the late 1970s-early '80s, including EAGLE'S CLAW and GREEN JADE STATUETTE.",1006646400,3,1267,4.660714285714286
7930373,4,B000053VGQ,"Tan Tao Lang, Wang Tao, and Chang Yi star in this amazing film.  Tan Tao plays a local law enforcer who arrests Wang Tao.  The two journey back to town but not with out their problems.  After many attempts to escape and many fist fights Tao is shackled up. After a while the two men begin to actually pay attention to each other and talk.  Both realizing soon after that they are both in search of the same man, and have similar goals.  Their similar goal is to stop the evil Spider Chang Yi.  Together the two fighters decide to try their luck against Yi.  Tan Tao using his feard Dragon Fist, and Wang Tao using the Snake style they attempt to stop the spider in his path.  What they didn't expect was the power and speed of his till then invincible Spider Kung fu.  Together can they Stop the Spider?  or do they get caught in his web?
  Fights well choreographed, unique styles (spider kung fu is amazing), and an all-star cast.  Gotta have this one if your a collector.",994809600,2,974,4.314917127071824
7930374,4,B000053VGQ,"Not Really...(I rate it more like 3.75 stars)
Starring: Tan Tao Liang, Don Wong Tao, Tommy Lee Tso-Nam, Chang Yi (1980) (Corey Yuen Kwai as a gang villian with no fights or skills)
Billed as the sequel to ""The Hot the Cool and the Vicious"" it has nothing to do with the first movie. The fighting was much better and a lot faster as well as more crisp than the HCTV. Tan Tao Liang looked a lot better in this movie as he not only used his superior kicking skills, he also used the Dragon Claw technique while Wang Tao utilized his snake fist. Tommy Lee actually played a gang villian in this movie while the main villian was played by Chang Yi. (His name is Chang Yu in the opening credits).
The story was a bit more interesting than HCTV, with even a bit a light comedy that actually worked and made the movie a bit more entertaining. Tan plays a policeman while Wang Tao plays a womanizing gambler/crook.
There were more fights in this movie, and the interesting Spider fist technique worked as well. (I'm not sure if that's a true technique, however, I do know fighters don't shoot web's...hehe)
Overall slightly better than HCTV.",984009600,2,1132,4.473429951690822
