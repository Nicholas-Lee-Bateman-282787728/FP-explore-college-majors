900540,5,6304586809,"David Attenborough and the BBC team have outdone themselves with The Trials of Life.

This is quite possibly the greatest nature documentary ever made. No other film has come so close to capturing the true spirit, the exotic locations, the trials, the triumphs, and the beauty of the wild. Prepare to have your jaw drop at the sight of great migrations, riveting hunts, floods, fires, births, deaths, and the good ol' cycle of life. Prepare to be informed and educated by David Attenborough's informative but NEVER boring narration.

If you have not seen this film, then do so immediately. You will not regret it!

Strongest recommendation! 5 Stars!

P.S. Our earth is precious. Protect it while we still can!",1352419200,,709,4.932773109243698
900541,4,6304586809,"GREAT CRIMES AND TRIALS OF THE 20TH CENTURY is simply one of the best Documentary Series ever made. Produced between 1992 and 1996, and originally broadcast on BBC2, this fascinating series examines some of the greatest criminal cases in history. Bizarre Deaths, Unsolved Murders, Serial Killers, Legendary Trials, War Criminals, Gangsters, Kidnapping Cases, and more are profiled in these fascinating episodes. Solely making use of archive footage, stills and interviews, GREAT CRIMES AND TRIALS OF THE 20TH CENTURY was produced in an era when ""true crime"" television was dominated by dramatised reconstructions, a genre that became popular in the 1980s. Everything about this series is great: the many different cases covered, the narration, the information given to us, the special ""atmosphere"" created by the music and the voice of the narrator... This is a wonderful series and I highly recommend it to anybody having an interest for True Crime, murder cases and Real life mysteries. Enjoy !

On this VHS you'll find two episodes: The Zodiac Killer and Green River case, & The Sacco and Vanzetti trial. Each episode is 26 minutes long.

Episode 1: The Zodiac Killer and Green River case
This episode examines two famous cases of Serial murderers, both of them were unsolved at the time this episode was produced. The seemingly random brutal murders of five people in California's Bay Area in 1968 and 1969 and a series of taunting cryptic notes sent by their killer terrorized Northern California for years. The killer later gave himself a name: The Zodiac.... The Green River Killer; the name of this case is derived from the Green River, a river that begins in Washington State and empties into the Puget Sound in Seattle. This killer murdered at least 49 women between the early 1980's and the 1990's, and the real number of victims will never be known. In 2001 Gary Leon Ridgway was arrested for the crimes and he later admitted being the killer. He was sentenced to 48 life sentences with no possibility of parole and one life sentence, to be served consecutively. He was also sentenced to an additional 10 years for tampering with evidence for each of the 48 victims, adding 480 years to his 48 life sentences.

Episode 2: The Sacco and Vanzetti trial
The 1921 murder trial of the young Italian immigrants Nicola Sacco and Bartolomeo Vanzetti was one of the most controversial trials in U.S. history. For some observers, the trial was a way to bring two criminals to justice. For others, the two men were innocent of the crime but were found guilty because they were immigrants and political radicals. Defenders of Sacco and Vanzetti waged a fierce legal and public relations battle to save their lives, but the men were executed in 1927.",1351036800,,2749,4.945887445887446

900543,5,6304586809,"I have this collection on VHS, and now on DVD, it's AWESOME!!! I love the documentaries with David Attenborough, his accent is cool. And for the price: MUCH lower than what I prev spent on the VHS, and VHS set is going on Amazon for 100 bucks or more!!! This documentary is VERY informative in the life of animals; all the obstacles of life that they, we, have to go through to live together and survive from generation to generation. A MUST HAVE for any nature-lover, esp. animal lovers. And all 12 VHS tapes shrunk down into 4 discs of 3 episodes per disc all in a standard 4-disc DVD case, that's totally cool also. I waited for this set to hit DVD for years!!! Now I hope they do the same with my Predators of the Wild Collection.",1292716800,7,734,4.287769784172662
900544,5,6304586809,"I had this a long time ago and loved it so it was a replacement. David Attenborough is one of our families heroes. My daughter and I always loved this and she is now going to college to be a zoologist. I am sure James Herriot, Jack Hanna, the Krat Bro.s and Steve Irwin (God rest)and her Moms obsession had something to do with this as well but David, well he is a charmer!
This series has stuff that may now be old news but when it came out it was like WOW I can't believe animals are that smart. I can't wait to build on my collection.",1268092800,3,537,3.9814814814814814
900545,5,6304586809,"I was mesmerized when i saw this British documentary series on US television c. 1993, and viewing it 14 years later i was still awed.

Quite simply, this is the best nature series i've ever seen, and i've seen hundreds of them, since i fell in love with ""wild kingdom"" as a kid back in the early 1970s.

Better than the classic 1960s Disney nature films? Yes.
Better than the classic Jacques Cousteau specials? Yes.
Better than the classic National Geographic specials? Yes.

Better than the other Attenborough nature series, Life on Earth and Life in the Freezer? Yes.

Better than the 2006 Planet Earth series? Yes.

Better than anything ever done by the PBS Nature series or by Discovery Channel or Animal Planet? Yes.

Trials of Life is the best 600 minutes of Nature footage ever released to the public. All 12 episodes are great, not a clunker in the bunch.

If you like nature shows and have never seen this, buy the DVD immediately. You can actually get it cheaper from Amazon-UK.

The only way this could be improved is if they released it on Blu-Ray, but for now, DVD is the best option available.",1240358400,10,1107,4.583756345177665
900546,5,6304586809,"This is the 3rd entry in the David Attenborough Life series following The Living Planet. The groundbreaking first series Life on Earth was based on evolution and started with bacteria making its way up to modern humans over the course of 13 episodes. The Living Planet was 12 episodes long and dealt mainly with adaptation over a wide range of environments that also incorporated more Earth science along with the life science in terms of geology and environments. The Trials of Life is all about animal behaviour.

While the first two in the life series are very similar The Trials of Life is a little different in that Attenborough has less screen time because animal behaviour needs to be captured discreetly. So most of it is one large narration however there are classic moments where Attenborough does appear. So be prepared for a little cutback in how often you see him engage wildlife.

This is also the harshest of the three and nature red in tooth and claw does emerge more often. For example this is the series with the classic footage of killer whales crashing onto beaches to capture seals and then taking them out to sea only to toss them into the air using their tails before eating them. We also have Chimpanzees hunting and killing monkeys with their bare hands. Sea lions take out their aggression on pups. So be prepared for it.

The 12 episodes are mainly about births, growth, finding food, hunting and evading, navigation, housing, communities, fighting, interactions, communication, courting and mating. It is a wonderful series and worth hunting down if you can find it even if it does sometimes redo some of what was in the first two series and not so much Attenborough, however The Trials of Life is worth it for the Killer Whale scenes alone.

As a note some of the animal behaviour covered in Richard Dawkins' books that where written before The Trials of Life are filmed in this series.",1230076800,5,1915,4.759036144578313

900653,5,6304586809,"After starting to watch Planet Earth, and seeing the producers reminesce about Trials of Life, I had flashbacks to when I was a toddler, and Dad woud show me the episode on Hunting because it had those mesmerizing killer whales on film. As I remembered this, I set out to get a copy of the tapes. What shocks me after watching it 20 years later is realizing, as a kid, I had ignored some truly high-quality footage of other animals. While Planet Earth introduces new and unique footage of animal interactions and also brings to the table an increased perspective of the majestic habitats and ecosystems occupied by those animals, these original Trials tapes represent an encompassing and foundational library of organism-centered interactions on film including fungal parasites, plants, insects, birds, fish, crustaceans, and mammals.

900659,5,6304586809,"Attenborough is one of the great videographers of all time, and I have never seen anything by him that I didn't like.  What sets this series apart is its central focus on animal behavior.  Even after all this time, the illustration of key concepts in the study of animal behavior is generally spot on. Some of the videos such as the killer whales attacking seals on an Argentine beach or the birds of paradise courting are among the first of their kind, and thus have a place in history in terms of documenting behavior that had not been filmed previously, or not been filmed well.  I wish it was available in the US format; however, these DVDs can be read by certain players (I use VLC media player) on your PC without monkeying with your DVD player's region settings.  And, if you have a Roku or equivalent, they can be streamed from your PC to your TV.  Be aware that the resolution of video is NOT high-def.",1356307200,3,911,4.431137724550898
