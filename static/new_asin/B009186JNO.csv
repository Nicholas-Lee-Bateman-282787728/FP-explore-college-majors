5240795,5,B009186JNO,"I watched it twice in two days during the same time I was reading the book Mick Jagger by Philip Norman (which I also recommend). It was great to see the gents as their epic journey was beginning. Brian Jones was articulate and playful; his ending quote was ironic. Jagger was ego, but playful, articulate, intelligent, and oy!!! what a performer. Keith was playful, Bill Wyman was ironic, and Charlie Watts (thus the title) was engaging and animated. Who knew!?!? Having attended RS concerts, this footage showed me that I wish I had seen them at the inception of the RS. They were truly their bluesy selves. The Irish audience was in awe and quite unruly. Check-out the priest - even he got into the funk. Charlie is My Darling is worth the price. It can be viewed for a variety of purposes; but it all goes back to the gents. Andrew Oldman, who was in charge if this footage and the RS at the time, deserves some credit for documenting these important moments in music and cultural history.",1352678400,32,993,4.553072625698324
5240797,5,B009186JNO,"So very glad to see the release of Peter Whitehead's film ""Charlie Is My Darling,"" he is also responsible for Allen Ginsberg's ""Holy Communion"" from '65, ""The Beach Boys In London"" from '66... shot with the road band while Brian Wilson perfected ""Smile"" at home... and ""Tonight Let's All Make Love In London"" featuring incredible stage riot footage of The Rolling Stones, Syd Barrett-era footage of The Pink Floyd and other great insights to the legendary mid-'60s ""Swinging London"" era.  It should be said that The Rolling Stones, though their career has been very long, have a prime, and ""Charlie Is My Darling"" is shot right at the crest of that prime.  Brian Jones is still a healthy, motivating force in the band, and without him, The Rolling Stones lose a ton of dynamics in their recordings.  So it can be said that the first five or six Rolling Stones albums are the hardcore goods, and that ""Charlie"" captures the personality of this legendary combo when those first six releases were the focus.  The work they are doing at this stage of the game was the primary inspiration to all of the great American '60s Garage Punk bands later compiled on the ""Nuggets"" series of box sets and LPs (along with The Yardbirds, Them, Kinks, Pretty Things and Beatles).  A good indicator of the Rolling Stones' range is the inclusion of the early ""long"" song ""Goin' Home,"" which soundtracks a montage of the group's road experiences.  The segment in its own way delivers a more realistic version of what The Beatles captured in their first movie ""A Hard Days Night,"" or, something more like the Maysles Brothers film of The Beatles first U.S. visit... but with a more proto-psychedelic touch.  ""Charlie Is My Darling"" is a rare open book to one of the high points in rock 'n' roll history... it may not appeal to hard rock fans, but that's just it; the original Rolling Stones were an actual rock 'n' roll band, based in a more '40s/'50s R&B thing than predictable '70s ""rock.""  Their music was based in the real folk blues, but expanding right before your eyes within the context of this film.  - Domenic Priore, author of ""Riot on Sunset Strip: Rock 'n' Roll's Last Stand in Hollywood"" (2007 Jawbone Press, London, available on Amazon.com)",1352505600,81,2234,4.737113402061856
5240798,4,B009186JNO,The quality of the film and sound are pretty good considering it was made in 1965. Pretty good in equal interviews of each Stone. Neat behind the scenes footage. Another great item for the real Rolling Stone's collector.,1352332800,7,220,4.815789473684211
5240799,3,B009186JNO,"First off, this is a movie about The Rolling Stones!!! I thought this was going to be a sequel to ""Charlie Bit My Finger""!!!

 Okay, I just had to get that out of my system. But seriously folks, watching this movie is a lot like watching old 8mm movies of your kids and grandkids. And, I really don't mean that in an unkind way, but that's just the way I see it. Lets face it, there just isn't too much film out there featuring Brian Jones and it's worth the small price of this movie to see and hear Brian talking. I haven't watched the Directors cut yet, but the main feature clocks in under 1 hour. Maybe 15 or 20 minutes is the Stones in action. Another 15 to 20 minutes of interview clips with the band. The rest is comments from the teenage fans, way too much of that! Never-the-less, every true die hard Stones fan will want to own this movie!

I found a website for home theatre buffs, and their DVD listing (UPC 038781100893) was 16:9 view.
This is confusing, and I hope someone at Amazon can help. I certainly don't want a ""pan and scan"" version if the film was originally shot in 16:9.",1351900800,14,419,4.358974358974359

This DVD was filmed during a tour of Ireland back in 1965 and shows the Rolling Stones when they were still a younger band and having fun. Brian Jones is particularly noticeable as an energetic musician, before the drugs took their toll on him. Mick and Brian are both featured in interview segments which show them as intelligent men who had lives outside of the band. I also enjoyed some after-hours sessions with Mick and Keith having a few  drinks and working on their music/clowning around.

5240820,3,B009186JNO,"This was OK. The live footage was great, I just wish there was more of it. The interviews and screaming girl scenes got boring quick. Mick and Keith jamming on two Beatles songs was really cool though, but the long winded interviews kept this from being a highly entertaining rock movie like A Hard Days Night. More music, less talking please. I love the Stones as a band but I really don't give a frig about Mick Jagger's opinion about anything. And of course, the one Stone I would be interested in hearing from, Keith, is the only one who doesn't get interviewed.

5240828,5,B009186JNO,"This is worth it just for the extra live concert footage added that were never before seen. The original only showed bits of The Last Time and I'm Alright. This shows both of them in there entirety. It also adds Time is on My Side, Satisfaction and a few others. Mick Jagger and Brian Jones stand out the most live. Brian Jones cranked out the Last Time. Keith Richards cranked out Satisfaction. Two of the mid 60's best guitarists. Keith and Mick also do an unplugged version of Tell Me. The rest of the movie is OK. Basically just a film of the stones on tour. If you like rare early live performances eith the late Brian Jones this is definitely worth it.",1417478400,,658,4.357723577235772

Bill Wyman, Charlie Watts, and Brian Jones are interviewed (not sure why Jones is made to look bad by the interviewer though), Jagger acts like an idiot with manager Andrew Oldham, and Keith Richards is almost cut out entirely except in performance.

I love that brief little window in the British Invasion before media and ego and drugs transformed them and the rest of the artists.  Still, even in a short film, there were too many junk scenes where, to be blunt, nothing remotely significant or noteworthy transpires. that really belong on the cutting room floor unless you are a super hardcore fan.

The Stones had just recorded ""Satisfaction"" and their fame was about to grow beyond their die-hard fans.  They come across almost innocently in the interviews.  It's kind of fun to see them offstage, with Keith playing guitar, and the concert footage mostly shows the craziness that erupted during these Irish shows.",1414022400,,479,4.888888888888889

5240843,5,B009186JNO,"I was a teenager in 1965, and those times it was possible only to hear them at the radio.
I'ts an emotion to see images of that generation who changed the world (at this point, however, I don't know if in better or in worse, but we tried).

If a band still stands after 50 years, means that they are really big and must have a place in our bookshelves.
I suggest the DVD to both the ""old"" and ""new"" teenagers.

To those who blame the quality of the documentary, I remember that 1965 was not a multimedia world: good images could be taken on by cinema movies (film) cameras or important broadcast companies' television-cameras.
We can then suppose that the source of many parts of the video were amatorial and nowadays post-processed.

Travel back in time to Ireland when the Stones had just started performing in small venues. You can witness the strong bond between the band members and their manager.

Private moments, like Mick's impersonation of Elvis are shown, as well as Keith playing the piano -- I never knew he played anything but the guitar.

The interviews with Stones members are refreshingly unaffected,  Jagger in particular comes across as insightful and self aware during his interviews in this context, something he hasn't managed since.  Even the notoriously taciturn Charlie Watts expounds for more than a grunt and a snarl, genuinely answering questions from an off camera interviewer.  Hard to imagine that the footage was gleaned from only 2 or 3 days during an Ireland tour in '65, this is a brilliantly edited slice of life within the Stones maelstrom at their very early peak.  The sound is big and full, the stage footage from the wings is electric, fantastic film making on every level, 5 stars for this recently remastered doc from 47 year old 35mm reels.",1367452800,,886,4.926174496644295

At just over an hour, you see a bunch of young guys goofing around, hanging out, trying to take it all in, but they're all having fun and none of the debauchery (at least on camera) they became notorious for later on. It's good to see Brian Jones being funny and thoughtful before it became the Mick & Keef show and watching him in his decline on the ""Rock and Roll Circus"".

If you've seen ""The Beatles First US Visit"", it's pretty similar. No naked groupies and smashing TVs.

I know they have a deluxe edition of this, but I can't imagine the quality on Blu Ray for this film looking any better than the regular DVD. I would've liked to have seen a single live disc either included with the DVD or sold separately, instead of withholding it so people could buy the box set (and prob. could be found on a file share site).

Also on the DVD, you can see the work they put into restoring this in the bonus section.

5240891,5,B009186JNO,"Unless you are a ""youngun"" who just started listening to the Stones, this is a Must-Have item, IMO. Kids today may well enjoy it.

It's a really nice introspective to the Rolling Stones in their early rise to stardom. Mick and Keith are both in fantastic voice, Bill Wyman actually manages to crack a smile or two, and Charlie is, well, Charlie.

I cracked this open and played it for my brothers on Xmas day. I first saw the band in '81, but they had the chance to see them from the late '60s on. We all enjoyed the trip back in time.",1357776000,,535,4.184466019417476
5240893,5,B009186JNO,This is old footage of the guys way before Jagger knew how to rock out on stage. He was still developing his act and dance steps. It was fascinating to see their reaction to crowds of fans. It was as if they were seeing a tsunami wave coming at them.,1357603200,,250,4.02

5240897,5,B009186JNO,"To  begin the photography was stunning.  I love the black and white filming with the very artful and beautiful compositions that were made by the photographer, who showed the Stones  off at their most beautiful.  Very stylish.  It was really fun to listen to them jamming together especially interspersed between interviews.  In particular, I loved Keith  singing ""Santa bring my baby back to me;""  He sounded exactly like Elvis.  Unfortunately, Mick stuck his face in after only a few seconds and it was bye, bye Keith.  ""Satisfaction,""really rocks.

 I never realized how much Keith resembled an urchin out of a Charles Dicken's novel.  The interviews with Brian revealed him to be fragile in my estimation and foreshadowed what was to come.  Charlie was charming as was Bill.

The media questions were so insipid as in, ""Why is your hair long?"" Nothing has changed in that Department.  As the boys walked off at the end, Bill Wyman stuck his tongue out at the camera which was sort of a buzz kill.  All in all, I watched it six times during my first sitting so it was mostly great fun.

For a movie titled, ""Charlie is My Darling,"" it is interesting that no one has less screen time than Charlie.  I was also annoyed when Keith started to sing, ""Santa Bring my Baby Back to Me,"" and after only a few seconds the camera went to Mick's face. I sometimes get annoyed by having to overdose on Mick.  He's not alone up there but you'd never know it.",1357344000,,1447,4.578125

5240904,2,B009186JNO,"The overly effusive reviews notwithstanding, this thing is a bloody mess.  The reason it was never released widely when originally made is painfully apparent.

The Stones are great on stage but the filming of the group playing live is terrible.  The camera angles are mostly from stage left or from behind the group.  Worse yet, it was filmed with an often out-of-focus and jittery hand-held camera!  The band is never seen in full from the audience's point-of-view (as they WERE seen in the T.A.M.I Show).  We are only shown brief snippets of individual group member's faces up close and at odd angles (usually from stage left or from behind).  The shots of Charlie Watts dully pounding out the same beat from song to song never seem to vary at all!  Keith Richads, way over there at stage right, is barely seen.  Also, the cameras never focus on Brian's guitar work.....you just see bare glimpses of him playing and smiling.

The footage of the band offstage is dull and off-putting.  It's no wonder that this band was always ranked a distant 2nd to the Beatles.  Their stature rose to the titanic proportions they enjoy today only after the Beatles disbanded.

A Hard Day's Night this ain't.....it's more like just a Hard Night.  Even die-hard Stones fans Can't Get No Satisfaction from this crude, inartfully constucted film.",1356912000,3,1329,4.848888888888889
5240905,3,B009186JNO,"This is OK for a collector perhaps. I watched it once and put it on the shelf.

5240908,4,B009186JNO,"While this does not really come off as a full narrative, and certainly doesn't have the well crafted quality of A Hard Day's Night, Charlie is my Darling is a fascinating look inside the life of the Stones in the early 60's.  I can't believe we watch Mick and Keith song writing, and hear them sing covers of Beatles tunes, and a rousing Londoner anthem!  They also seem to be having such a wonderful time - it's a pleasure to see.",1356220800,,431,4.308641975308642
5240910,5,B009186JNO,"I am the Stones Authority. Cool film. Thank you Andrew Loog Oldham and Allen Klein. Thanks for preserving this all these years. I know that it has been out in various forms befre, but it is now generally available for everyone, not just aficionados who'd pay stupid money to see anything ""Stones"". Great footage of the guys that is nicely restored. I like also that it is a peek behind the scenes of one of their small tours. We are not in L.A., London or New York. We are in Ireland. And I think that you get to see an authentic look at what touring bands of the early 60's experienced.  Small and oddball venues, with not much staging for fans who were there as much to see this still relatively new ""spectacle"" called Rock and Roll, as they were to see the band themselves. Certainly new for those Irish kids, that is for sure. It is also nice to get a couple of moments where we see Mick and Keith hashing out a couple of songs that would later make their appearance on a record, such as ""Sitting On a Fence"". One of my favorites. The film has a very strange vibe all the way through, but it is a valuable record of this band as they are breaking out in '65. A record of not just the band, but also of the age and the place. A wonderful time capsule - nearly 50 years ago. And you can also see that they are a very good band, a tight outfit. They can play. Given the limitations of the technology and audience expectations of that time period the audio is all in all not that bad. And the interviews - of which I wish there was more to them - are very good. English schooling of the period certainly paid off in general, because you notice that they can actually form and speak ideas. They weren't just a bunch of yobs. And Jagger is a sharp cat. Even then. As the films ends he speaks what will be remembered as his all time greatest quote - as far as I am concerned. ""There is no secret to our success. It is all rather obvious"". And obviously one of the best outfits to have ever done it. Their potential greatness clear to see from the beginning, if you know what to look for.",1356048000,,2084,4.171215880893301
5240912,4,B009186JNO,"This is a nice throw-back to the real Rolling Stones, before they became charicatures of themselves. Exiting to watch, except that the film seams very herky jerky much of the time, perhaps it was taken with a small hand held camera. Sometimes it's difficult to watch because of that.",1355788800,,283,4.795918367346939
5240913,5,B009186JNO,"This is a great documentary on the Stones. The fact that they've been playing together for 50 years & be able to look back on a slice of time from 1965 is amazing. I saw the Stones in the late 60's at the Hollywood Bowl when 'Satisfaction' was number 1.
  If you were around to experience the 60's or if you just want to take a look back at a great Rock 'n Roll band from the 20th Century, I highly recommend this piece of work! It is truly real!",1355702400,,446,3.9444444444444446

5240916,5,B009186JNO,"This DVD shows us a journey undertaken by the Rolling Stones in their early careers. A chronological look at a couple concerts held in Ireland. We see the flight to Ireland and back again. and the step-by-step events while on this mini-tour. The original film has been restored and works well at a number of levels.

What is charming about this film is the innocence of the Stones. They are captured before alcohol and drugs became so much a part of some of their lives. One thinks of the wonder in them that, at this point in time, they were still continuing, enjoying their work, and progressing in their careers. This is when the original Stones were honing their act--Mick Jagger, Keith Richards, Brian Jones, Bill Wyman, and Charlie Watts. We get a glimpse of whom each one was.

We get footage of two concerts. The first features ""The Last Time"" and ""Time Is on My Side."" The audience goes wild and--then--some of them ran up to the stage and started holding onto or grabbing the musicians. Police entered and a mini-riot broke out, with the Rolling Stones skedaddling from the melee. The second concert features ""Around and Around"" and their first mega-hit--""Satisfaction."" It is fun to watch Jagger dancing, even then pretty fluid on stage.

Highlights include reflections by the Stones (and their manager, Andrew Loog Oldham) in a room, Keith playing an acoustic guitar while Jagger sings in a room. There is something almost sweet about the portrayal of the musicians--they were not yet jaded. The cinema verite approach works nicely.

For an ""up close and personal"" look at the Rolling Stones early in their careers, this is a fascinating film.",1355529600,4,1655,4.837455830388692
5240917,4,B009186JNO,"A chance to see the group before they became formula driven.  Jagger actually had some intelligent comments.  Interesting concert footage.  Worth the money, no doubt about it.",1355443200,,175,5.407407407407407

This is the ultimate film to see and to own if you're a die-hard fan of the band, especially in its early days with Brian Jones.  Keith Richard(s) was quite funny and there's even a glimpse of Nanker Phelge composing songs like Sittin' On The Fence!",1355270400,,340,4.557377049180328
5240919,5,B009186JNO,"""Charlie Is My Darling"" is a fantastic document of the Rolling Stones early days. I enjoyed it MUCH MORE than ""Crossfire Hurricane,"" which was a document of their first 10 years as a band. ""Charlie"" was put together by ousted manager/Producer Andrew Loog Oldham, who played a VERY significant role in their development. He WAS given his due in ""Hurricane."" This really showed what it was like to be on tour with this band. It is more telling than The Beatles ""Hard Days Night."" There are scenes of Mick and Keith making fun of then-current Beatles songs. This is a great DVD to own. Most of you know I am a big Beatle devotee, but I also have great respect for Mick and his merry band of degenerates. Great insight by Brian Jones in this film also..",1355097600,,749,4.474452554744525

5240922,5,B009186JNO,"Intimate look at the young ""innocent"" Stones.  Want to see backstage Pepsi sipping instead of Jack Daniels chugging?  This film has it. An eerie prophecy is made by Brian Jones that in hindsight is very chilling. Listen closely, because this turns out to be a major part of this document. Songwriting sessions in the hotel room, private dining room dinners, train rides through the Irish countryside, whilst Keith Richards sings his favorite nursery rhymes?  Yeah, all that is here too.  What a wonderful film. You kinda feel like you really get to know them better after watching it.  This is a great piece of history for the person interested in knowing what were like before they became mega-stars.",1354665600,,701,4.906779661016949
5240924,5,B009186JNO,"Towards the end of the footage there is a 2 or 3 minute segment where some of the Stones are standing / sitting at a piano, drinking what appears to be white wine or vodka, and playing around. They seem to be a bit tipsy or maybe just very tired. The time frame is mid to late 1965, just after the hit Satisfaction has been released and the Stones are in their creative prime, touring in Ireland. Keith and Mick go off on an Elvis rant and begin to sing snippets of the King's hits. Included are That's When Your Heartaches begin, Blueberry Hill, and Are you Lonesome Tonight. Keith, on the piano, does a very good singing rendition of Santa Bring My Baby Back to Me. Mick has the sneer down. There is a mocking tone to their impersonation, but also respect is paid to Elvis. You can tell they have been positively influenced by the King of Rock and Roll. There is an absolutely hilarious moment where they repeat the phrase ""Ah Ha huh"" a la Elvis of the King Creole era. This small portion of the DVD was particularly fascinating.",1354233600,2,1031,4.347150259067358

5240927,5,B009186JNO,"Fantastic early footage when Brian Jones was around. This dvd is the best so far for including interviews with all the members of the stones (not just Mick).

5240929,4,B009186JNO,"One thing to get up-front is that the actual running time of The Producers cut is only 1:02 which is 62 minutes. The Directors cut is only 36 minutes, most of which, appear in the Producers Cut. So, to begin with, one must take the short duration into account. In terms of the footage itself, there is incredible live moments that truly capture lightning. They play live The Last Time, Time Is On My Side, It's Alright, Play With Fire,. During the mini-riots at the Irish & stage invasions it was wild to see some fans jump up on stage & approach each member of the band. There is one scene where 2-3 boys take Brian down off-stage. Leave it to your imagination as to what happens next. One other character that makes sure he was included was Andrew Loog Oldham, who was the band's manager & musical Svengali. Mr. Oldham was responsible for guiding the Stones regarding money, musical direction, and public relations. He seemed to fit in quite rightly with the boys in the band. In the other live musical concerts, they play Everybody Needs Somebody, Pain In My Heart, Round And Round, & Satisfaction. Actually as The Stones were touring, Satisfaction was ruling the charts as # 1. So , essentially, this was the Stones playing live as they were nearing their peak. Their is intimate footage of Mick, Keith, & Brian collaborating on a tune which turned out to be ""Sittin On A Fence"". The film captures the boys working together on writing a song. Rather ironic that the tune was actually a throw-a way in the US as it didn't come out unti The Flowers LP came out in 1966. So you have to pay to see The Stones play with such conviction & musical fire. You really only get about 25 minutes of raw, live footage. The reaction of the fans is revealing because you see that The Stones were not yet used to getting mobbed by fans as their popularity exploded. Eventually, they would get used to it. The Special Features were not really Special. A 4 minute doc on the restoration process plus interviews already shown do not make a Special Feature section. The restoration is good but one must consider that the original was source was from 16 mm stock. I have early boots of Charlie but they are pretty washed up & fragmented. To me, with the Stones coming out with The Last Time, Satisfaction, & Get Off Of My Cloud, you just can't beat the 65 Stones, when Brian was still with them. Brian does emerge as the most shining star in this dvd. If the Documentary were at least 80 minutes, I would give it 5 stars. At the very end of The Producers Cut, you see the Stones carefully crossing the railroad tracks on foot to escape their frenzied fans. The Stones choose to cross the dirty tracks themselves. The shot reminded me of The Beatles running down the main platform to elude fans when George fell down from A Hard Day's Night. There is even a very cool shot of Andrew Loog Oldham laying his head down on the railroad tracks & then lifting it off of the tracks just before a train crosses the tracks. All in all, it depends on how much of a Stone fan you are. If you have the $, then you NEED this dvd. If you don't have the cash, you don't need it right NOW. Down the road, you probably could get it at a cheaper price. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!! SMRZ!!!",1353801600,,3245,4.400998336106489
5240932,5,B009186JNO,"Excellent footage! The restoration work these fellas did to this film is truly amazing. The image is so clear and crispy, and the mono sound is perfect and it totally rocks in a good amp system. This is (in my humble opinion) the best era of the Stones (followed by their early 70s), and the footage of old Ireland is completely amazing: downtown streets, the country side, the people, the kids. I never imagined I would be able to see and hear the 60s Stones that clear! This is a true gift for all the true fans of the lads. I have to admit that it's obvious that Andrew Oldham was an awesome manager, that knew quite well that this footage would be soon mythic. I wish the Beatles could have that foresight (Mr. Epstein?). And in spite of Jagger's and Brian's sardonic ego, it's clear from the first second that the engine behind the Stones is Keith, an impression I've already had since I've heard the Satanic Sessions (available in internet) and saw the Rock'n'roll Circus DVD... He was the boss all the way! I just hope that the Stones have more hidden jewels from those high times. I've already got their TAMI show, Sympathy for the Devil, Rock'n'Roll Circus, Gimme Shelter, Ladies & Gentlemen and Some Girls in Texas.

And I'm still waiting for MORE!!!",1352937600,19,1260,4.5506607929515415
8533855,5,B009186JNO,"The Stones' version of Hard Day's Night.  It's their 1965 Irish tour, and they're on top of their game.  They haven't yet become The World's Greatest Rock 'n' Roll Band, with Mick dressed up as the devil-in-leotards and a junkie Keith with a headband and a cigarette hanging out of his lips, crouched down low and bashing power chords.  Which is the Stones we know best.  This is a glimpse of them as they were just coming into their own, just starting to write their own songs.  Mick reminds you how well he could move in a small space, like James Brown, before he took choreographed lessons to prance about in 60,000 person stadiums.....and what a great harmonica player he was.  Brian Jones is eerily prescient in some of his little remarks about thinking he'll either be dead or have left the business within 3 years.  And while Brian is lying about mewling and whining, Keith is off in a corner inventing new licks, never doing anything except playing with his guitar, and belying the notion that Jones was the musical genius, just because he played a few flute and sitar notes on some hits....Keith was a MUCH better musician than Brian, and actually practiced his craft while Brian moondogged about looking forlorn.  Plus, well, Keith wrote hits, while Jones did nothing except look cute while strumming a Vox Teardrop.  This little time capsule is a real gem, and any Stones fan -- nay, any 60s music fan -- will find it impossibly charming.",1529539200,,1449,4.673228346456693
