5351354,4,B009M4KT8I,"1. Here Comes the Neighborhood - Kendra and Hank finally have a home in L.A., but are challenged by the uncertainty of Hank's football career and Kendra's obligations as a sexy celebrity.
2. A Fine Bromance - When Hank whisks Kendra away for a romantic and surprise-filled south-of-the-border trip for their second anniversary, one of the surprises is that pals Jon and Julie Dorenbos tag along. When the trip turns into more of a bromance than romance, Kendra is determined to ""bring the sexy back.""

4. Meet Your Match - While Kendra helps Little Hank's nanny prepare for a blind date, Hank seeks out career opportunities in New York.
5. Family Matters - During a personal appearance trip to her hometown of San Diego, Kendra confronts her longstanding issues with her mother, Patti.
6. Fathers and Sons - As Hank anxiously waits to see if he'll be picked up by an NFL team this season, both Kendra and Hank fret about whether or not to have Little Hank's luscious locks clipped. Everyone gets some much-needed perspective on all fronts when Hank Sr. opens up about his recent battle with lung cancer.
7. Lovitz or Leave It - When Kendra discovers Jon Lovitz wants her to audition for a proposed television show, she struggles to prepare with various media trainers. Hank then boosts her confidence with some much-needed -- and very creative -- encouragement and support.
8. Booking It - Kendra's book tour take her through every city she and Hank have lived in since they got married. Along the way, Kendra catches up with old friends and acquaintances, including pal Julie Dorenbos and the shock jock who once accused Kendra of having lost her sexiness - Erich ""Mancow"" Muller.
9. The Homecoming King - Kendra confronts Hank's past, including his ex-girlfriends, when they attend his high-school reunion.
10. Homeward Bound - Kendra helps Hank deal with his fears of returning home without being part of a football team.",1355270400,4,2118,4.886111111111111
