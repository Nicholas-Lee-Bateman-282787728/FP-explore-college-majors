And the kid? He'd just as soon spear-hand your trachea as allow you to steal his pog collection. The guy in the back is the weak link in this triumvirate of fearsome martial artists. Grimacing, uncertain, he appears to be shielding his eyes as he tries to get a glimpse of a solar eclipse.

Throughout this video, Deborah Magone will regale you with many slow-motion and regular-motion sequences of her pummeling attackers. Even the kid pummels attackers. The wimpy guy just takes a lot of punishment.

Between beatings, Magone appears in civilian clothes to dispense general safety tips. Walk with a buddy at night. Beware parking garages. Stuff like that.

If ""Your Good Defense"" and ""Your Better Defense"" aren't cutting the mustard, try ""Your BEST Defense"" with Deborah Magone. You won't be sorry--but your assailants will!",1472688000,,997,4.887573964497041
