7970477,5,B00006JMPV,"I'm a huge collector of anime. I started to read the manga a few years ago and got hooked. Unfortunately Suncoast went under years ago, so I couldn't buy the discs from them. Our blockbuster also went under, so I couldn't go and see if they had it for cheap, and everywhere else that I looked would've charged $29.99/disc--providing that they even had individual and not box-set of it... Finally came on here and was able to find them used, at a relatively cheap price--probably paid less for these discs than if I had gone out to buy a new disc or box set of it (starting at $29.99/disc, probably closer to a little over $100 for the boxset...). Very pleased with it since it runs like a charm and isn't too beaten up (doesn't skip, unlike some other discs I've gotten from sellers).",1361318400,,784,4.451388888888889
7970478,5,B00006JMPV,"I have been collecting this series for a very long time now. I have enjoyed this dvd series for the longest time now and now it is finally complete. This dvd starts with motoko going on a exocist mission and the group ends up finding out that it was a set up by keitaros buddies shirai and haitani. Thanks to them Naru now thinks that Keitaro is a major pervert (not like she wasn't thinking that earlier). Naru is now starting to show some emotions towards Keitaro even though some of those emotions are hostile. New things start to heat up at the hinata apartments when kaolla's older brother comes into the picture and wants to marry Su. The problem is that does Su really want to marry him? Your gonna have to watch this dvd to find out and a new promise has been introduced. This one seems to be the most awkward, but a promise is a promise. This one happened to be a promise to a doll named Moe. No its not pronounced MOE, its pronounced Mo-e and its a girl doll so theres nothing funny business going around. I highly recommend this dvd to those who enjoyed the first 4 dvds of this great series!!!",1123113600,,1105,4.291866028708134
7970479,5,B00006JMPV,"Love Hina volume 5-
Naru possessed by an evil spirit,the girls in yukata, Kaolla's older brother, and a doll named Mo. Cotains episodes 17-20, both subbed and dubbed.
Highly recommended if you liked the previous four discs.",1086566400,,223,5.054054054054054
7970480,5,B00006JMPV,"A ghost is trying to kill Keitaro, Kitsume seems to show an interest in the Professor (much to Sarah's unhappiness), Kaolla tries to eat Tuma (which is frankly, kind of normal), a Prince shows up to marry Kaolla, and a mechanical doll is found in the apartments that thinks Keitaro is his grandfather.
That's right, it thinks and moves and seems to be alive.  Lots of magic in this DVD, plus the characters get to sing and we get to see a side of most of the characters that we rarely get to see.  It's nice to know that Kitsume has a soft side and that Keitaro, as shown in his dealings with the doll, can be calm and collected when he needs to be.  It renewed my interest in where the anime was going!",1079136000,,703,4.192592592592592
7970481,5,B00006JMPV,"Are you into cute dramas that moves you and makes you laugh? Then Love Hina is IT. This is truly one of the most popular anime hits in America because it delivers these themes exceptionally well. It's a very cute story, has great laughs, good character development, and by the end you'll fall in love with all the characters. Definitely a must watch for those that are into this genre.",1044748800,,385,4.514285714285714
7970482,5,B00006JMPV,"(There's a reason I call myself Mutsumi Otaku, you know)
Mutsumi appears for real this time in the last two episodes on the disc, so I am very fond of this. Mutsumi is my favorite character, and the more I see of her the better!
The first episode involves Naru getting possessed by an evil spirit and Motoko learning her school's ultimate technique. The episode after that has everyone going to a yukata festival. Haruka and Seta seem to know each other quite well (in the manga, the two were once dating, but the anime is unclear on this) and Shirai seems to be a little too interested in Haruka. Naru goes to the festival with a clueless Seta (The guy makes ME look socially adept sometimes), and Keitaro ends up taking Shinobu (who looks even cuter than usual in her yukata) to the festival, which makes Naru angry.
In the next episode, everyone has gone back to the Hinata Apartments, and Kaolla's brother Lamba Lu shows up to marry Kaolla! She is less than willing to do this, and the residents end up finding and bringing Amalla Su to the Apartments. Amalla's apartment and Mutsumi's were connected, so Naru finds Mutsumi when she finds Amalla and Mutsumi tags along back to the Apartments. There is much bizarreness, and all the girls end up dressed in the wedding dresses of Kaolla's country (including Mutsumi, who looks really good like that). The last episode involves a doll named Moe who has come to life after being in the possession of the Urashima family since Keitaro's great-grandfather bought her. (Incidentally, Haruka is Keitaro's cousin, not his aunt. The word for aunt in the Japanese version can also mean ""old woman"" which is how Keitaro uses it.) Keitaro, Mutsumi, and eventually Naru can all hear Moe speaking to them, even though no one else can (Sara theorizes that only those who have failed their exams can hear the doll).
In short, this one is very good. If Mutsumi were in it even more it would be even better.",1041552000,3,1943,4.6347826086956525
7970483,5,B00006JMPV,"This was one of the best dvds so far. I enjoyed every minute of it. I am glad that I will be able to see all 25 of the Love Hina episodes, plus the Christmas Movie, and other movies. I hope you buy this dvd, because I know I love it!",1041120000,,233,3.588235294117647
7970484,5,B00006JMPV,"Volume 5 of the Love Hina series continues the antics and adds a serious note to the story. The first three episodes contain the expected humor and laugh inducing fun. An encounter with an evil spirit tests Makoto's skills and inner strength. Naru, who gets posessed by the spirit, is saved by the combination of Keitaro's love and Makoto's new focus. A secret about Kitsune is revealed in the second episode, as Keitaro attempts to move his relationship with Naru forward. The third episode brings the appearance of Su's ""brother"", and she is forced to make a decision about growing up.
The fourth episode was a bit sad. During this episode, we learn the depth of Keitaro's heart as he fulfills a promise. Will it be enough to finally tie Naru and Keitaro together?
I guess I'll have to wait for Volume 6, eh?",1035417600,,810,4.631944444444445
7970485,5,B00006JMPV,"This is an awesome series in general, and the episodes they spent by the sea were phenomenal.  Just do yourself a favor... turn off the English Dub. It's awful.  Subtitles can be a pain, but your ears will thank you later.
This is a real turning point in the series because all the main characters have been introduced and all the exposition put aside, the real development begins. The premise is that the Hinata Inn owns this little beach side restaurant- so the residents go work there during the summer to raise money.
In one episode, Keitaro tries to romance Naru by taking her to a scary pirate ship-  his two idiot friends talk him into it-  But Naru ends up being possessed by the spirit of a woman who hates men and tries to seduce them for the purpose of killing them.  And the only way to free her from the hex is for Motoko to master a technique of her older sister which involves cleaving and destroying non-living objects, although living beings (ie Keitaro...repeatedly) are in the way of the sword.  Can Motoko learn this technique while doubting her own abilities? Well, it does end badly- but that part has nothing to do with Naru being possessed.
And, the carnival episode.  Sara decides to make a nuisance of herself- but Kaolla always beat her to it and gets the two of them trapped on a remote island.  Keitaro takes Shinobu to the festival; Naru-chan thinks Kei-kun is being a pedophile pervert.  You also find out who Kitsune has been in love with all this time.  Then, Kei and Naru end up together, holding hands under the moon- watching the fire works.  The entire cast breaks out into the theme song of the series- Sakura Saku- which is a beautiful song- only they sing it slowly for once.
Coming back from the beach, everyone has a tan.... especially Urashima (Kei-kun).  When the suave, debonaire tanned version of Keitaro returns, all the girls are quick to swoon.  Only Mitsume, the one who faints all the time, realizes it's Kaolla's (step)brother.  He's come to marry her and take her home.  But as Kaolla says to her brother, ""Keitaro would never say there's nothing we can do about it.""
Just what is the meaning of a promise?  It can be a ghost from the past that revisits you again and again.  Previously in the series, these ghosts did not take physical form; they only manifested themselves in memories, emotions, and motivations.  Here, the significance of even the smallest promise by a small child takes physical form... inside a life-size clock-work doll.  And while the others are worries about the mononoke who's going to steal Keitaro's soul, Kei-kun just wants to be true to his promise of old.  Memories and promises are real, and they do take a life of their own... and no matter how far buried or forgotten- they come back.
This is a wonderful series, and this set of episodes is especially good.  Just do you and me a favor and watch the Japanese voices with subtitles.  You'll thank me later.",1032652800,,2942,4.606525911708253
