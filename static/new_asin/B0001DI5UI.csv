1990729,3,B0001DI5UI,"This movie was banned in 99% of the world. They had to splice parts togather for nr version so it is rough going some times.

 Don't take it to heart it's just an old movie!!!",1133481600,,175,3.9714285714285715
1990730,3,B0001DI5UI,"I remember seeing ""Scalps"" years ago, but it was one of those infamous, chopped up versions, so I was pretty excited to see a restored version released on DVD. No, this isn't nearly the bloodfest that ""Evil Dead"" is, but considering it's time of release, ""Scalps"" was a pretty hardcore horror film. And there really wasn't a complete copy on video. Despite what some other reviewers say, this is still basically an 80's slasher, and that is a good thing, and that is probably what you want considering your reading reviews on ""Scalps"". The gore effects are pretty good, and the acting and story are pretty good too. ""Scalps"" has it's tense or scary moments. Overall I would recommend you add this to your horror collection if you are a fan of 80's horror. The only reason I would deduct any points from ""Scalps"" is that the movie desperately needs to smooth out the rough edges. Scenes will jump-cut to the next scene jarringly, and with the restoration and adding censored scenes in, it's obvious where the master print was played with. Still, ""Scalps"" is a cool little movie.",1094515200,13,1077,4.703703703703703
1990731,4,B0001DI5UI,Scalps was a highly ambitious low budget horror flick that should be in everyones horror collection. The story is well written and proves as an interesting spin on the slasher flick. Instead of making the evil killer a crazed lunatic like in most of your horror films from this time frame(the early eighties) it uses a evil native native american spirit as its vehicle for massacre. I think this makes it scarier than most of the traditional slasher films. The movie is filled with gorey and darkly frightning scenes. The only problem I had with the movie was the sometimes inappropriate lighting it used during some of the nightly killing scenes. It seems to be daytime sometimes in the middle of the night??? And also some of the acting is sub par but an the whole is pretty decent. I really like some of the slow motion chase scenes near the middle of the movie and also the hauting indian face that flashes in the fire and through out the film. Chilling!!!.......Jerry,1085616000,16,972,4.656976744186046
1990732,3,B0001DI5UI,"I vaguely remember seeing this film on Continental Video in the mid 80's and considered it OK.  I puchased the original movie poster a couple of years ago and then went on a quest to find a VHS copy of it.  No luck.  Then I heard about Retromedia and Fred Olen Ray Along with ""The EEL"" decided to do the 20th Anniversary eddition.  I bought it.  Basically Fred Olen Ray had to go through hell trying to piece together a print to Scalps.  Most of the footage shown is grainy from a blow up of a 16mm print to 35.  The cut scenes that were added in are from a Vidoe transfer from the 80's U.S. VHS release and Canadia 3 quarter inch tapes.  Watch the movie once through and please forgive the grain.  The viewing may seem like the film is over 2 hours because it drags and drags on.  The best scene is the throat slashing.  In my opinion it is one of the best throat slashings I have ever seen on film.  I had some time to kill and decided to view Scalps once again with the commentary track on by Lee and Fred.  The commentary is great.  I learned information about the making of a film.  From script writing to finding financing.  The commentary taught me a lesson on filmmaking.  How to make a film with no budget and the tricks to shooting with what you got.  Fred Olen Ray explains about shooting day for night, shoestring budgets, how 21st century cheated him out of $ and the secrets to some special effects that were used for the murder scenes.  I recommend the viewer to watch the film once without commentary then watch it with the commentary.  The movie is not great, the image is grainy and poor but the make-up and gore is pretty good.  The commentary is the best.  Fred's voice over is much louder than Lee's but Fred is much more fun to listen too.  3 stars for gore and commentary.",1085529600,14,1795,4.245562130177515
1990733,3,B0001DI5UI,"The packaging of Fred Olen Ray's ""Scalps"" leads one to believe that it has been banned virtually everywhere and is usually only seen in highly censored versions. I doubt this is a true statement and comparisons with ""The Texas Chain Saw Massacre"" are unfounded. If you do not watch the film expecting it to be some sort of forbidden fruit of graphic gore and unrelenting horror you will probably enjoy it. The setting is a familiar one to those who know horror; a group of young people end up stranded in a remote area and stumble upon an ages old curse that engulfs them all. The acting is terrible and the film does not ever betray its low budget roots. The one amazing thing about the film is an extremely brutal throat slashing sequence that might be one of the ""best"" ever. This scene alone makes the film worth watching as well as cameos by Forrest Ackerman, Carrol Borland and a general revisiting of early eighties horror. I especially enjoyed the virtual immediate ""freak out"" of one of the group who resorts to some priceless dialouge during a scene when they hear ghostly drumming. (Its from hell). The DVD transfer is barely acceptable and there is even a disclaimer stating that it was culled from many different sources to present the most complete version possible. What is odd is that I am not clear as to why this was needed as there is nothing in the film that would indicate the need for massive censorship. My thought is that the film was basically ""lost"" and it was pieced together from whatever footage they could find. Anyway, while I seem fairly negative about this movie, I did enjoy revisiting ""Scalps"" and would recommend it to slasher movie completists.",1082073600,17,1681,4.6632996632996635
1990734,3,B0001DI5UI,"Briefly, college students digging where they shouldn't.  End result,  student possessed by spirit of Black Claw, an avenging Native American spirit exacting his revenge via the forgotten art of scalping. A creepy movie with a very familiar theme (...).
The film ""stars"" many of the director's standard cast - most of whom were key players/extras in later films (Tomb and Biohazard).  Notable names include Forrest J Ackerman (B-movie bit playa) and... well just Ackerman.
This is the 20th Anniversary Deluxe Edition, featuring a new letterboxed transfer, audio commentary by Fred Olen Ray and writer Lee (T.L.) Lankford, the original trailer, and an exclusive still gallery.",1080518400,5,674,5.4
1990795,4,B0001DI5UI,"Fantastic transfer of a classic, gritty 80s slasher. Fun extra features like a clip from ""Blood Desert"" (a remake?) and the fan-made sequel. Cool interviews with the director and some people involved. The music and atmosphere in this film are top notch. Recommended!",1459814400,,266,5.209302325581396
1990796,2,B0001DI5UI,Bad quality and bad film in general,1458518400,,35,4.142857142857143
1990797,5,B0001DI5UI,"Okay, this movie really isn't that great.  It's boring.  The gore is...meh.  The story isn't really compelling.

So why give it five stars?

Fred Olen Ray is one of the great b-movie directors.  His pedigree speaks for itself.  The thing with this BLU-RAY release is the commentary track.  It's enlightening, interesting, and tells a lot of great production stories.  All of Fred's commentaries are informative.  Plus, you get the interviews and dumb fan films.  It's the Blu-Ray Package that I'm giving the five stars, not the movie itself, though the movie does have its moments.

If you're buying this blind, or you're not a Fred Olen Ray mega-fan, you should rent some kind of version of it first, and you'll quickly know if you're the audience for this movie or not.

Another thing, I really hope Fred keeps putting out Blu-Rays of his older movies.  Would love to see one of The Tomb.",1457136000,9,890,4.73202614379085
1990798,4,B0001DI5UI,"Excellent effort!! If you know this movie,you will not be disappointed. SCALPS was shot on 16MM, so consider this in your evaluation. The reinstated cut portions look almost as good as the orignal material, Very interesting for fans of this sort of movie, Recommended!!",1456358400,,269,5.136363636363637

1990800,5,B0001DI5UI,"I remember renting this one on a double feature with The Slayer back in the VHS days and I loved it .The Blu ray (as i am watching it now )is a little grainy but not too bad for a low budget 80s drive in style grindhouse flick , but thats just how i like it .It gives the movie a certain vintage feel when they leave some flaws in. Dont listen to the negative reviews this is a good little horror movie .Those who gave it 1 and 2 stars probably enjoy movies like Twilight. However true horror hounds will definitely appreciate this one , it has all the ingredients like memorable characters, great gore scenes, the harbinger (old man who warns the kids), and it even has the trademark campfire scene. 80s horror at is best.",1454544000,16,723,4.246376811594203
1990801,4,B0001DI5UI,"Blu Ray Review: Retromedia version. This Blu Ray comes with an audio commentary by the director, a 22 minute featurette, a trailer, some stupid Blood Desert remake thing, and a moronic fan film. The picture quality is a little bad. It's grainy, scratchy and fuzzy but is watchable enough. Besides, that's how I like it: Crappy! The audio is tolerable. And above all, the good thing is the Blu Ray is actually cheaper than the DVD. Well, thus far.

Movie Review: Some idiots go hiking the mountains and discover an Indian burial ground. They decide to dig it up and acquire Indian s***. This pisses off an Indian ghost and the ghost possesses one of the idiots and kills the rest of them off. Yes, this is a very corny slasher movie. A big hunk of mozzarella. I liked the movie because of the gory murders (NO I WATCH SLASHERS FOR THE PLOT AND GREAT ACTING! Morons.), the piss poor direction and the bad acting. However, the only thing I didn't like was that the pacing is slow as hell. Scalps is for slasher aficionados at best and since I am one, I LIKED THIS MOVIE, B!T(#!!

Conclusion: 4 stars for the Blu Ray (mostly due to bad picture but that was expected) and 3 1/2 stars for Scalps.",1454198400,5,1190,4.429223744292237
1990802,2,B0001DI5UI,"Got suckered by this one as a blind buy because I love 80s slasher films. Dull super-low budget movie with some fleeting amusement (mainly in the form of bad acting). The ""2K Scan transfer"" is a stretch. For fans of this film ONLY.",1454112000,7,231,4.395348837209302

1990804,4,B0001DI5UI,"Despite being as disjointed as it is, I enjoyed it.  The video quality isn't all that bad.  The presence of Kirk Alyn, Carroll Borland, and Forrest Ackerman made it a must buy for me.  After watching, listen to the commentary as that explains a lot about the problems of this theatrical version.",1452211200,,295,4.634615384615385
1990825,1,B0001DI5UI,"I bought this movie as I am a huge fan of 80's horror movies and hadn't heard of this one. As soon as I started watching, it became obvious why I hadn't heard of it. The movie itself feels like it was shot on video and quality of the actual story isn't much better. Avoid unless you are an 80's horror completist only.",1443571200,,318,4.063492063492063

1990827,2,B0001DI5UI,"Not sure where this reviews are coming from. This is not a good 80s slasher movie. I've seen some bad ones before and I'm not saying it's the worst, but it's pretty bad. It has some decent gore and affects, the acting is horrible but I expected that. It's weird that through out the entire movie there is some sort of music or sound going on, I think it was a way to try to divert the audience from the terrible acting. I think it has a decent plot, but there just isn't enough action or suspense for me. It could have been way better...",1412812800,,537,4.123809523809523
1990828,5,B0001DI5UI,"Highly entertaining, despite its low budged but it has a creepy feeling. The Indian chants put the hook in me really and the gory scenes good for a low budget.
I recommend it!",1408665600,2,175,4.333333333333333
1990829,2,B0001DI5UI,"Movie was a typical 80s horror/slasher film. Very low budget picture quality. This was even worse when viewed on a second rate dvdr (fake) copy sold to me by (deep_discount_dvd). buyers beware this is not a real dvd copy they are selling dvdr,and passing them off as real. I wanted a real dvd to enjoy, but instead got this cheap imitation. The movie would have been more enjoyable with a better REAL format,but if you like fake blood,fake acting,and want to remember the 80s.this is it.",1372291200,,487,4.674418604651163
1990830,4,B0001DI5UI,"I loved this movie when I first saw it on video-tape back in the 1980's. The DVD version looks great and it seems to have  been produced using different sources, the quality is fine. But, I don't remember the background music which plays for 30 minutes straight from the video-tape. Maybe it was on the tape, but I can't remember... but it's kinda annoying. Still, not a bad release.",1365984000,,383,4.550724637681159
1990831,3,B0001DI5UI,"but to start the quality of the DVD stinks. First of all it is not a studio made DVD. it is burned in DVD -R format. Looks like it was transferred from VHS. Again it is better than nothing because I like the film. Some good gore scenes, decent acting. 3 stars",1324166400,2,259,4.0
1990832,2,B0001DI5UI,"This movie quite easily had the budget of the sweet kung fu short i shot in high school for my video and photo class.

the long and short of it: college kids are sent out to the middle of the desert (which doubles as a haunted, indian burial ground) to search for artifacts. a native spirit picks the terrible actors off one by one. there's a twist. sorta. kinda? eh.

the idea, while not entirely pc, is decent but it's execution is very hit or miss.

i will say that the scalping scene was cool. one of the coolest low budget gore scenes i've seen, actually.

the transfer ranges from ok to terrible. you're warned about this prior to the movie beginning. i won't fault this flick for that.

2.5 / 5",1237507200,4,701,4.28030303030303

1990834,3,B0001DI5UI,"Oooooof!  Where do I start?  If you are a lover of the film SCALPS then you will be happy to know that this DVD is shown in wide screen format
and uncut(unlike the VHS copy I use to own)and has audio commentary from the makers as well as a trailer.  That being said this is a very BAD movie but!!! If you enjoy movies like Plan 9 and The Manitou(which was good) then I believe you will enjoy this movie. A stalker is possessed by a ancient Indian demon and ""SCALPS"" as well as stabs his victims.  This has some of the worst acting I have ever seen in a film(and friends I have seen a lot) seriously the acting in this made the actors in CANNIBAL FEROX look like THE GODFATHER.  Still it does however bad it is have its moments.  The possessed killer does look FREAKISH in a Linda REAGAN Blair sort of way and has cameos from Kirk(SUPERMAN)Alyn-Carol(Mark of the Vampire)Borland and the biggest CLASSIC MONSTERS fan of them all J.(No not you J.from Amazon)J. Forrest Ackerman.  If so bad why 3 stars?  Because this is great in a M.S.T.3000 sort of way, I mean we have a fight scene where the guy kicks the face of another but in no way does his foot even come close to the head yet still we hear a big ""WHAP"" and their is lots of BLOOD!!!  Had to laugh for their is a scene with a actor who is dead and has blood all over him but yet you can still see him breathing???????????  Anyway buy SCALPS!  Yes its bad...But in a good way",1223510400,5,1428,4.156363636363636
8010562,3,B0001DI5UI,Allot of folks give this one a bad rep but it is slasher legend stuff. Highly recommended if a slasher fan. Not quite sure how anyone can take this genre too seriously.
