2385919,5,B000ADWCYY,"Im very excited for this release....Anyone who thinks that this is the beginning of Sout Park's ""downward Spiral"" is not a true south park fan. I mean come awn!

*** Those, in my opinion, are the best of season 6. The other episodes aren't bad by any means...but not the highlights of the season. IF YOUR A SOUTH PARK FAN WHY WOULD YOU NOT GET THIS?",1123200000,14,1036,4.942196531791907
2385920,5,B000ADWCYY,"Ok so Cartmans voice changes, big deal, this season still kicks butt. The Russel Crowe episode is hillarious! Pay no attention to those losers who gave this DVD a bad review simply because they cant take a joke. They need to develop a sense of humor or find something else to do with their time besides sitting in their parents basement writing stupid comments online all day. IF YOU DONT LIKE IT DONT WATCH IT! I don't need to hear you b#%$@ and complain! Hippies",1123200000,,464,4.470588235294118
2385921,5,B000ADWCYY,"This season's a good one... so are all South Park's (Kenny's not in this one though... sorry for Kenny's fans). Once again, it treats of both political issue perception and just joking around, having fun , sort of a blast on every things that come to Trey and Matt warped minds... Considered as sick, even blasphematory by some, but it really ain't. It may even mean to educate uninteressed people with thoughts of good will. Episodes are listed as:
601 - Freak Strike (Butters has testicules under his chin)
602 - Jared has AIDES (Jared reveals his terrible secret)
603 - Asspen (co-propriety benifits)
604 - The new Terrance and Phillip movie trailer (""Oh! My god! it's Russel Crowe"")
605 - Fun with veal (not veal: baby-cow)
606 - Professor Chaos (Butter's vendetta)
607 - The Simpsons already did it (Tribute to the Simpsons)
608 - Red hot Catholic love (priest Maxi seeks J-P II's help)
609 - Free hat (Raiders of the lost Ark re-released)
610 - Bebe's boobs destroy society (They do!)
611 - Child abduction is not funny (""F*** you Mongolians! Don't break down my wall!"")
612 - A ladder to heaven (USA government: ""We must... bomb heaven."")
613 - The return of the Lord of the Rings to the 2 Towers (""I want my Precious..."")
614 - The death Camp of Tolerance (Lemmiwink: the gerbil's quest)
615 - The biggest Douche in the Universe (""Ladies and gentlemen: John Edwards"")
616 - My future self 'n' me (parental hypocrisy)
617 - Red sleigh down (Santa goes in Irak)",1123113600,5,1467,4.624521072796935
2385922,3,B000ADWCYY,"This the season where Cartman's voice gets less funny, and where the plots get weaker.  BTW, Matthew Hollman, or whatever your name is, your not funny, and the whole ""We have to defend Bush no matter what"" thing is getting old.",1122940800,3,227,4.536585365853658
2385923,4,B000ADWCYY,"To the first reviewer, who broke every episode down, you had me, then you lost me!  As for the this season, I give it 4 stars, being that the Russell Crow, and Raiders Of The Lost Arch episodes sucked!  As far as reviews go, I give the very first person who wrote a review for this season a NO vote for being a brainwashed, white trash redneck.",1122940800,7,344,4.119402985074627
2385924,5,B000ADWCYY,"I admit I was not a fan for the first couple of years but by season four SP had evolved into a much more satrical, intelligent show and by season five it had also added dark humour to its comedy cannon (scott tenorman, butters very own episode)

Due to shows evolving humour and characters, the creators began to play around with the story telling of the show (if you bought the season 5 dvds you would hear Trey talk about how they began do more simple stories other than complex ones as this allowed much more breating room for humour)this playing around with storytelling led to the creators killing off Kenny for real, as his character was becoming a prop (if you watch season 5 you'll notice most of the kenny deaths come right at the end of the episode, are usually very uninspired and only really used to keep up appearances) Yes, we all know Kenny rejoins the cast at the end of this season but anyway...

Season 6 is probably the most Butters packed season ever, this cute lil guys role had been increasing from episode to episode since his first speaking role in season 3, and its this season where butters really is the star when he is brought in by the boys as their replacement friend for Kenny, from the first episode onwards they promptly torment and abuse him until eventually firing him as their friend, Oh but the butters fun doesnt stop there, for after that he becomes a super villian, the evil ""Proffesor Chaos""

Another cool thing about this season is the sheer amount of experimenting with characters and situations, an episode focusing on a rarely seen character bebe, the introduction of the city wok guy, miss chosondik dying, mr slave introduced, LEMMYWINKS! So much is new. All of this while at the same time creating completely fufilling episodes in terms of storyline and humor, as well as the usuall social commentary, celebrity bashing and movie parody, which in this season is the most dense and rich it has ever been.

This is not the season to get if you want to get the overall character profile of south park, theres alot of moving things around here, and episodes often have continuity from one to the next in this season (something not usually done in SP) but in terms of humour this is as good as it gets

The special features I assume will be the same as season 5 (mini commentaries from matt and trey) while it would be nice to have more features I feel the commentaries here are often very interesting, no doubt it will be the same in the season 6 set

SP is currently in its ninth season and, in my opinion, still very good, but season 6 is one to be especially excitied about, being one of the absolute best.",1122681600,11,2653,4.4937759336099585
2385925,5,B000ADWCYY,"I love the entire series of South Park. Even after 9 seasons Trey and Matt can not stop with the non stop humor. I hope south park goes past 10 seasons because I love it!

I would highly reccomend this season over all the others because it is the best...Duh. In this season Butters takes over Kennys spot in the group and trys in everway to be like kenny and fails.

Cartman is funnier than ever and is maturing a lot. This is the season were cartmans voice changes a lot compaired to seasons  1-5

Humor - 9/10

Animation - 5/10

Sound - 8/10

Season 6 Overall - 8/10

Anyway I am going to pre order this dvd, I hope you will do the same.

Thank you for reading my review, I hope it was helpful.",1122595200,4,696,4.0588235294117645
2385926,5,B000ADWCYY,"Look to have the 3-5 Minute minies at the start of each episode just like seasons 3,4, and 5

""Jared Has Aides""

In this episode the boys seize upon an opportunity to make money with a weight-loss program that's sweeping the country. Subway Jared has assistances calls them ""Aides"" but the town and everyone thinks he means ""AIDS"" good stuff.

""Asspen""

The boys head to Aspen, where the slopes are superb and Stan gets into a showdown with the lodge's expert skier. THe parents are scammed be a 90 Minute Time Share Condo Brief that lasts the entire weekend. I just got caught up in one of these in Florida but I made sure it only lasted 90 minutes.

""Freak Strike""

The gang decides to put Butters up as a guest on a talk show thinking that they will get special favors. The creation of the Ball Chinieans done long before MIB II.

""Fun with Veal""

The boys try to save baby lambs from the slaughterhouse. In this story the boys find out what happens to you if you are a vegetarian.

""The New Terrance and Phillip Movie Trailer""

The boys look forward to the newest Terrance and Phillip movie. The only boring episode.

""Professor Chaos""

When Butters is rejected by the kids, his alter ego Professor Chaos is unleashed.

""Simpsons Already Did It""

Professor Chaos sets up another sinister plot to destroy the world; The boys invade Mrs. Choksondiks autopsy. Great one.

""Red Hot Catholic Love""

The Catholic Church scandal begins to effect the town.

""Free Hat""

The boys try and stop famous directors from ruining their favorite films by enhancing and re-releasing them. They offer free hats if you join the cause and the ad simply says Free Hat and Hat turns out to be a baby murderer so the nation wants to know why they want Hat freed.

""Bebe's Boobs Destroy Society""

When a female classmate begins to develop the boys friendship is threatened.

""Child Abduction is Not Funny""

The overprotective parents of South Park will do anything to keep their children from being kidnapped.

""A Ladder to Heaven""

The kids when a shopping spree in a candy store, but Kenny was holding the winning ticket. Kyle, Cartman, and Stan decided to build a ladder to heaven to get the ticket from their deceased friend so they can claim their prize. I hate Allen Jackson so this was good cause he is made fun of.

""The Return of the Fellowship of the Ring to the Two Towers""

After watching The Lord of the Rings, the boys are inspired to go on a difficult quest to return their copy of the film to the video store. Great Episode

""The Death Camp of Tolerance""

The boys are sent to a camp where cultural sensitivity is taught.

""The Biggest...""

Cartman takes desperate measures to try to rid himself of Kenny's spirit, including traveling to Scotland. This time Psychic John Edwards is ripped on and let's face it any one named John Edwards or even John Kerry for that matter deserves to be ripped on.

""My Future Self N' Me""

Stan is forced to look at his life 30 years in the future; Cartman tries to launch a new business.

""Red Sleigh Down""

Cartman tries to score some points with Santa Claus by asking him to deliver presents to the needy children in Iraq.",1122076800,31,3153,4.541740674955595

2386150,5,B000ADWCYY,"There is no season of South Park that is as funny, as gross, and politically incorrect as season 6, and that's what I love the most about it. It stars out normal enough with the humorous, yet unimaginative, episode ""Jared had Aids"" where it is reveled that the Subway spokesman Jared has managed to lose all that weight because of his aids... then followed up with another funny episode called ""Aspen,"" but that episode also fails to deliver the political and social hummer we all love so much. No, when this season really gets going is in episode 4, ""Fun with Veal"" where Stan and Kyle find out that Veal is just ""tortured baby cows"" and make it their mission to save them by kidnapping, uh, cow napping, them and locking themselves in Kyle's room. From that moment on season 6 is full of laugh out loud episodes and social/political commentary that thrashes the Catholic Church (Red Hot Catholic Love), Rushal Crow (The New Terrance and Philip Trailer), Steven Spielberg (Free Hat), George Bush (A Ladder to Heaven), and much more.

Some of the best episodes in all of South Park are found in this box set. Red Hot Catholic Love where it is reveled that Catholics really just worship a giant spider in the Vatican. Child Abduction Isn't Funny, where South Park gets an Asian man to build a giant ""great wall"" around the city to keep out potential child abductors, only problem is that Mongolians keep knocking it down. Then there are my two favorite episodes, The Return of the Lord of the Rings to the Two Towers, and The Biggest D**che in the Universe. The Return of the Lord of the Rings to the Two Towers (or tRotLotRttTT, hmmm) is a giant spoof of my favorite movies of all time,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Lord-of-the-Rings-The-Motion-Picture-Trilogy-Platinum-Series-Special-Extended-Edition/dp/B000654ZK0/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Lord of the Rings - The Motion Picture Trilogy (Platinum Series Special Extended Edition)</a>, in which Stan's dad accidentally puts an adult video into the Lord of the Rings case, and sends it over to Butters house. After watching the tape, Butters terns into Gollum after Stan, Kyle, and Cartman come to take the video back to the movie store, calling it his precise. Meanwhile the 6th graders find out about the tape and scope the town for it.

After Cartman drinks Kenny's soul in The Biggest D**che in the Universe, Chef takes the gang to New York to see the ""great"" John Edwards who can supposedly speak to the dead. It is here that we have South Parks greatest quote,
Edwards, ""Everything I tell people is positive and gives them hope, how does that make me a D**che?""
Stan, ""Because the big questions in life are tough, why are we here? where are we from, where are we going? But if people believe in a55whole d**chey liars like you we're never going to find the real answers to those questions. Your aren't just lying, your slowing down the progress of all man kind you d**che.""

Oh yeah baby, the greatest South Park quote ever. And I haven't even mentioned brilliant episodes like The Death Camp of Intolerance, Freak Strike, or Red Sleigh Down. Let's just say that they are all great. You are not a South Park fan unless you've seen these classic episodes.

2386158,5,B000ADWCYY,"Unlike the Simpsons which hasn't really been that great since season 10 or 11, South Park arguably never seems to have one outright bad season (even season 7 had its moments). And so we have season 6 which has some average episodes but not really any filler. There's some show classics, season highlights and episodes that may not be as memorable but will usually contain an incredibly hilarious moment.

Jared Has Aides: A misunderstanding regarding Aides and Aids leads Jared of the Subway commercials to become hated in town. Not really a favorite but it's definately got funny parts including the City Wok guy.
A**pen: The gang goes to Aspen with Stan reluctantly having to save a youth center in an obvious poke at 80's sport movies.
Freak Strike: The boys try to get a free prize by pretending Butters is deformed on the Maury show. Not bad but kinda gross.
The New Terrance and Phillip Movie Trailer: The boys have to suffer through Russell Crowe's tv show to see the titular trailer. Very funny trailer when they actually show it.
Fun With Veal: Stan kidnaps baby cows and barricades himself in his room to avoid the cows turning into veal. Not bad.
Professor Chaos: Adorable Butters snaps when he's fired as the 4th friend and creates his alter-ego intent on doom and destruction.

Simpsons Already Did It: Butters/Professor Chaos can't seem to come up with a good scheme that the Simpsons haven't already done.
Red Hot Catholic Love: They take on the Catholic church when priests admit they've molested young boys.
Free Hat: If you hated the changes to the Star Wars trilogy and E.T, this episode is up your alley.
Bebe's (....) Destroy Society: Kind of meh episode when Bebe's growing body attracts the boys without them knowing why.
Child Abduction is Not Funny: A hilarious episode with parents overreacting to new abduction studies. City Wok guy steals the show.

A Ladder to Heaven: In a comment on the 9/11 sentimentality, everyone think it's cute the boys try to build a ladder to heaven to see Kenny.
The Return of the Fellowship of the Ring to the Two Towers: The boys roleplay when they have to return the movie to the video store, only it's mixed with a (....).
The Death Camp of Tolerance: Mr. Garrison tries to get fired so he can sue for wrongful termination while Lemmiwinks, the class gerbil takes a perilous journey...inside Garrison's teacher's aid.
The Biggest Douche in the Universe: Kind of okay. Massive pot shots against John Edward and Rob Schneider's movies as of late.
My Future Self N'Me: Future Stan visits to scare Stan into not trying drugs. Butters lines about the newspaper ads are hysterical.
Red Sleigh Down: Santa is shot down over Iraq and the boys and Jesus have to rescue him.

Like many South Park seasons, each episode is great in its own way save for some average ones but rarely do you find an outright clunker. May not be a perfect season, but it's sure a funny one.",1171843200,,2919,4.706457925636008
2386159,5,B000ADWCYY,"First thing, WHO said ""Jarred Has Aides"" wasn't a great episode? In fact I believe it to be one of the FUNNIEST of its particular season. Although, this season which has some fantastic episodes the subsequent 2 seasons are EVEN stronger, but this is a great followup to season 5.. with only a few.. well no real flat out duds, there's always SOMETHING in there.. but it doesn't quite stack up to the seasons around it.

Still.. Free Hat, Red Hot Catholic Love, Jarred has Aidea, The Return of the Fellowship of the Ring to the Two Towers were some of the FUNNIEST episodes of the series.. and are easily in the top 25, the show reached its 100th episode in the 8th season with ""I'm a Little Bit Country"".

South Park amazingly hits it right out of the park.. or just nose dives, but even the nosedives can be.. just, that you're not really into that particular aspect.. for example the 8th season, ""Good Times with Weapons"" really works better I think.. on someone more into the anime style that the episode mocks, whereas the episode Asspen from this season, much like the baseball episode of season 9, mocks 80s movies. The Asspen episode I LOVE in particular that it mocks, to me anyway, the John Cusack flick Better Off Dead (watch it and TELL me they weren't having a bit of fun with it). Much with the baseball episode, from Stan trying to lose the baseball games to the rockin sound of ""You're the Best"" (from the Karate Kid) to Randy training Rocky III style.. At its best.. the episode is a smart social satire. and at its worst, sometimes it doesn't appeal to everyone at once.. cause not EVERYONE gets the joke.. but, the show always comes back.. that's part of the magic.. and this season definitely has it.",1157846400,4,1719,4.506410256410256

The Terrance and Phillip Movie Trailer: (4/5) South Park's first and only real-time episode!

Professor Chaos: (4/5) Get introduced to Professor Chaos, Butter's alter ego!

The Simpsons Already Did It: (5/5) One my top three favorites of this season.

Red Hot Catholic Love: (4.5/5) Great episode!

Free Hat: (5/5) One of my top three favorites! Hilarious and SO true!

2386172,5,B000ADWCYY,"The sixth season is as hilarious as any season of South Park.  The episodes overall are toned down somewhat from the extremes of the fifth season's turning parents into chili and Butter's mother trying to kill him, with some exceptions.  This season's humor is a little different, somewhat more absurd, and definately funny.  If you're looking for a season to buy on DVD, this is one of the best.  There's no more killing of Kenny, but you'll find Butters to be pretty hilarious.

Memorable moments:

-Debut of City Wok owner in ""Jared Has Aides"", as well as his Great Wall building sequence in ""Child Abduction Is Not Funny"".

-Professor Chaos unleaches havoc on the world in ""Professor Chaos"", and learns that none of his schemes can be original in ""The Simpsons Already Did It"".

-Return of Chef's parents in ""The Biggest Douche In The Universe"".

-Butters.  From putting balls on his chin in ""Freak Strike"", to getting a liposuction in ""Jared Has Aides"", to his obsession with the porno tape in ""The Return Of The Lord Of The Rings To The Two Towers"".

-Lemmiwinks and Mr. Slave debut in ""The Death Camp Of Tolerance"", and Lemmiwinks goes on an adventure to become Gerbil King.

Favorite episodes:

""Professor Chaos""- Butters unveils his dark side.  The boys hold a contest to find a new fourth friend.

""The Simpsons Already Did It""- Professor Chaos can't come up with an original evil scheme.  Cartman creates an underwater civilization with his formula ""Sea People + Sea Men = SeaCiety.

""The Return Of The Lord Of The Rings To The Two Towers""- The boys embark on a quest to return a very powerful copy of The Lord Of The Rings to the video store.

""Red Sleigh Down""- a classic featuring the boys, Mr. Hankey and his Poo-Choo-Train, Santa, Jesus, and the Underpants Gnomes.  One of those characters also dies.",1148688000,3,1816,4.744408945686901

It was their opinion that perhaps the later shows tended to be better.  I couldn't agree more!  The first two discs of this season are pretty lame.

The story arc of Kenny's soul being trapped in Cartman's body is fun to watch, and you will not believe the real motivation behind ""Red Hot Catholic Love.""

Lots of bad taste and edgy humor in this season.  Subway Jared loves eatin' ""sammiches"" and thinks ""everyone should have aides"".  The Simpson get ripped on, or maybe paid homage, funny episode either way.  The infamous Lord of the Rings parody where Butters turns into Gollum under the influence of a misplaced porno tape.  Jesus Christ Action Star.  And on and on.  This is a great season!

I deduct one star though, because the special features are even worse than usual.  Many episodes don't even have mini-commentaries.  Comedy Central needs to do better on this, until they do, I'm more inclined to just TIVO the episodes and forget about shelling out for the DVDs.",1135900800,4,869,4.726666666666667
2386211,5,B000ADWCYY,"South park has matured in the past seasons and it still continues as far as it goes season 6 was the first season without Kenny but it was still hilarious. This season doesnt miss funny episodes as `the return of the fellowship of the ring to the two towers`wich is one of the funniest south park episodes ever.

Season 6 is one of the best south park seasons and

If you like Butters then you will enjoy this season as he appears a good part of the season,as he is replacing Kenny,becomes proffesor chaos. For all of the season they have problems with Kenny`s replacement as it was first Butters then Tweek. But that doesnt stop the show from being good.

There aren't a lot of bad episodes the only ones i don't like is `jared has aides`and `the new terrance and philip movie trailler`exept that the season was solid. The best episodes are;`the return of the fellowship of the ring to the two towers`,`Professor chaos`,`the simpsons did it`,a ladder to heaven` and others.

This season has a lot of stuff happening like Butters and Tweek replacing Kenny,Kenny `soul gets trapped into Cartman`s body,the lord of the ring parody,Tweek almost gets abducted and many more season 6 is rich in weird plots and humor. As season 4 showed lot of Timmy,season 5 showed Jimmy season 6 now shows a lot of Butters.

The episode list;

disc 1

602-Jared has aides(jared says he has aides and people think its aids`)

603-Asspen(the kids `s families decide to go sking in asspen)

601-Freak strike(they put balls on butter`s chin and sent him to a disfigured people show while cartman goes to a show for the most uncontrol kid to win )

604-Fun with veal(the kids tries to save cows)

605-The new terrance and philip movie trailler(the kids have to watch russel crowe to see the terrance and philip trailler in the comercials)

606-Professor chaos(Butters become proffesor chaos and tries to dominate the world)

 disc2

607-The simpsons already did it(every plot professor chaos comes up with,the simpsons did it)

608-Red hot catolic love(occurs with catolic sex abuses by mens to kid)

609-Free hat(the guys tries to save directors from remaking their movies)

610-Bebe`s boobs destroys society(the boys gets over bebe after they discover she has .....)

611-Child abduction is not funny(Tweek almost gets abducted and the parents wants a brick wall around the towns)

 disc 3

612-A ladder to heaven(the boys build a ladder to heaven to reach kenny)

613-The return of the fellowship of the ring to the two towers(stan`s parents give a mission to them ;go give the lord of the ring tape they rented to butter`s parents,but they left a porno in it)

614-The death camp of tolerance(m.r garrison tries to get fired from his job as the boys`s teacher)

615-The biggest douche in the universe(They try to get kenny out of cartman`s body)

616-My future self`n`me(the parents pay a guy to be stan`s future self to get him to never touch drugs but stan discovers it)

617-Red slight down(cartman has to do a nice one to get a christmas present as he helps santa,m.r hankey and jesus to bring christmas to iraq)

One of the best season of south park ,they leave the kiddy humor of the first seasons and instead bring in the mature humor to make a great season you can see here that the plots are more mature and there is nothing wrong against that. There are about no special features only short comentaries comedy central quickies.

Despite Kenny`s death they were still able to make a great season with awesome episodes i congradulate Trey parker and Matt stone. Its the most recent season released as south park season 7th comes out march 21.

I recomend it!",1135900800,2,3645,4.73968253968254
2386212,5,B000ADWCYY,"...this is the best SP season so far! Here is what I think of each episode:

607- The Simpsons Already Did It True indeed, yet Simpsons sometimes steals from South Park! 9/10
608- Red Hot Catholic Love Okay, NAMBLA was cool, Fat Camp also cool, Proper Condom Use a little disturbing but THIS drew a line! 8/10

611- Child Abduction Is Not Funny More CITY WOK! 10/10
612- A Ladder To Heaven What an excellent way to start the Spirit Run, especially with Saddam! 11/10

615- The Biggest Douche In The Universe Rob Schenider, you crack me up 9/10
616- My Future Self N' Me I never knew THIS was coming! 10/10
617- Red Sleigh Down Possibly the best Xmas episode, welcome back Kenny! 13/10

2386213,5,B000ADWCYY,"South Park gets better and better with each season.  Matt Stone and Trey Parker keep the shows relevant.  Season 6 has some of the best SP episodes (especially on disc 3).  I find I'm watching SP DVDs way more than The Simpsons.

Disc 1:

Jared Has Aides-A simple misunderstanding causes the people of SP to want to execute Subway poster boy Jared.  Meanwhile, the boys hope to create another Jared sensation with Butters and City Wok. (5 Stars).

Asspen-Butters' parents get the boys' parents to attend a time share presentation at Aspen ski resort.  Retro 80s music includes A-Ha (with a really bad rendition of ""Take on Me"" at the end), Men w/o Hats, and Simple Minds.  Thumper the ski instructor and Tad the ski bully are very annoying but the lengths that the time share company goes to in order to get the boys' parents to sign up keeps this episode entertaining. The side story with Stan and the ski bully is an obvious take-off of some cheesy 1980s movie(s)(3 Stars).

Freak Strike-A union of disfigured people who do the talk show circuit go on strike for better prizes and are skeptical whether Butters, who the boys got to put testicles on his chin to go on Maury Povich Show, is a genuine freak.  Cartman goes on the show too as an out-of-control kid who dresses like a slut, ""Whatever, I do what I want!"" (very funny).  The ""Look for the True Freak Label"" jingle is hilarious.  The union includes the kid from Mask and Liza Minelli. (5 Stars).

Fun With Veal-After seeing where veal comes from, the boys (well, mainly Stan and Cartman has his own agenda) want to rescue the animals.  They barricade themselves in Stan's room and end up negotiating calves for fire arms.  This episode ends with a convincing case against vegetarianism (uh,... yeah). (3 Stars).

The New Terrance and Phillip Movie Trailer-The boys have to suffer through a Russell Crowe TV show to see the new T & P movie trailer.  It's ironic that Crowe's recent actions further justifies their spoof. (4 Stars).

Professor Chaos-The boys let Butters know that he is not the right fit to be Kenny's replacement and ""fire"" him.  The boys hope to find a new friend ""Bachelor"" style.  Meanwhile, Butters is so mad at his rejection he creates a new persona and he and his ""minions"" set out to unleash destruction on the world.  (5 Stars).

Disc 2:

Simpsons Already Did It-The boys think they've killed Miss Choksondik with sea-people and then accidentally create a sea city.  Meanwhile, Prof. Chaos tries to think of ways to destroy the world only to keep coming up with ideas already used on the Simpsons. (4 Stars).

Red Hot Catholic Love-The parents of SP are so worried that their kids will be molested by the local priests they become atheists (The ""Catholic Boat"" scene is hilarious).  The local reverend tries to mend the reputation of his church and finds he's up against more than he bargained for.  Meanwhile, Cartman discovers a new way to eat.  One of the funniest SPs ever. (5 Stars).

Free Hat-The boys are on a mission to stop the director changes to classic movies and go up against George Lucas and Steven Spielberg.  A group of supporters confuse the boys' plan with a movement to free a convicted child murderer.  As with the Simpsons and Family Guy, I never care much for episodes that feature celebrities as I think the regular characters are more interesting. (3 Stars).

Bebe's Boobs Destroy Society-After a two-week hiatus, Bebe comes to class with developing breasts and gets the attention of all the boys who turn into cavemen.  (3 Stars).

Child Abduction is Not Funny-The parents are swayed by all the news reports about child abductions to the point of having a wall built around the town and having their kids sent away (Stan-""Dude, sometimes I think our parents are really stupid"").  Very funny but the City Wok/Mongolian sideline gets annoying. (4 Stars).

Disc 3:

A Ladder to Heaven-The boys want to see their dead friend Kenny again so they can get a ticket stub for a free candy shopping spree and begin building a ladder to heaven (of course, their parents think the kids have the sweetest of intentions).  As would be expected, Japan competes with the U.S. to reach heaven first.  Meanwhile, the government discovers a new location of weapons of mass destruction.  In addition, Cartman mistakes Kenny's ashes for chocolate milk mix and starts having memories through Kenny's eyes.  Jam-packed and hilarious.  One of the best SPs ever.  Interesting note:  the U.S. govt intelligence proves very accurate in reporting on the fate of Saddam Hussein (I wonder if Parker and Stone realize they made the govt look very competent that one moment).

The Return of the Fellowship of the Ring to the Two Towers-Stan's parents accidentally put a video of mysterious powers (a.k.a. a porno) in a Lord of the Rings box.  After Butters is affected by ""my precious,"" the boys must return it to the Twin Towers video store before it wreaks more havoc on middle earth.  Great stuff! (5 Stars).

The Death Camp of Tolerance-As the new 4th grade teacher, Mr. Garrison (with the help of his ""teacher's ass."" Mr. Slave) does whatever he can to get fired for gay discrimination.  Also includes a sideline featuring Lemmiwinks the gerbil. Highlight:  the sleeping Mexican janitor at the Museum of Tolerance.  Episodes featuring Mr. Garrison are always winners (5 Stars).

The Biggest Douche in the Universe-With Kenny's soul in Cartman's body, Cartman and his friends go to New York to go on a show featuring psychic John Edward.  Stan questions Edward's intentions when Kyle thinks Edward spoke to his dead grandmother and decides to join a Jewish private school.  Cartman visits Chef's parents in Scotland to undergo an exorcism (love this part).  Dropped a star because Stan is overly self-righteous here. (4 Stars)

My Future Self `N Me-Stan and Butters' parents hire actors to play their kids in the future to warn them to stay away from drugs.  When Stan and Butters find out, they go to Cartman (complete with Mexican workers) for revenge. (5 Stars).

Red Sleigh Down-Massive episode!  Cartman finds out he has to do the greatest thing ever to make up for all his bad things he did during the year so he can get a cool Christmas present and decides to bring Christmas to Iraq.  While Jimmy sings ""The Twelve Days of Christmas,"" the boys, Santa, Mr. Hankey, and Jesus join in an adventure that includes bombings, torture, death, and Cartman singing fake Christmas songs in the back of the sleigh.

2386215,5,B000ADWCYY,"The sixth installment of the classic cartoon South Park delivers laughs just as consistenly as the previous couple seasons did, featuring many memorable episodes, and with writers Matt Stone and Trey Parker effectively insulting celebrities.

""Jared Has Aides"" strongly opens Season 6, with Jared from Subway being near death because people think he wants to give them his ""AIDES"". Butters has a great moment in this episode with his lipo-suction surgery. ""Red Hot Catholic Love"" is a disturbing, but nevertheless hilarious episode with a side story of society puking crap out of their mouth. In my opinion, Butters seems to really shine throughout this season, and has basically two complete episodes put forth to his characters, as he wreaks chaos on the world as ""Professor Chaos"". ""Simpsons Already Did It"" is another great episode.

Maybe my favourites in this DVD set is the ""Ladder To Heaven"" and ""Free Hat"". The most hilarious aspect to ""Free Hat"" is that people are hoping that a criminal named Hat McCullough is released from prison, despite admitting to the killing of 23 babies. ""The Biggest Douche In The Universe"" has some great laughs too, and makes fun of John Edwards, making him out to be a phony pyschic and a douche.

Overall, this is a classic TV show and a great DVD set for any South Park fan, and therefore I would highly recommend it. Buy it!",1133913600,2,1367,4.858369098712446

There is the episode later on when one of the parents accidentaaly puts a pornp tape into one that says another children/teenager movie. Theparents send Cartman and pals to retieve it saying it has an evil affect on people not telling them it's a porno. Overall, best season but like other season's south park can be a bit gross at times but good social commentary through a cartoon show not really meant for children to young to watch some episdoes.",1131926400,4,620,4.594594594594595
2386237,5,B000ADWCYY,"Trey Parker and Matt Stone's irreverent cartoon comedy series South Park first aired in the late 90's. I recall still being in high school (junior and senior years) when this wildly popular show made up most of the lunch table conversation. ""Did you watch South Park ?....."". The first seasons were mostly non-parody comedic episodes that introduced us to the small town of South Park, Colorado (a fictional town) that is nestled beneath a possibly active volcano. Kyle, Stanley, Cartman and Kenny (and later Butters) are the principal characters. They are a group of foul-mouthed, adult-inside-children's bodies. Stanley is of Jewish parents and has a Canadian brother who is adopted. Cartman has a promiscuous and seemingly sweet mother. Kyle has a girlfriend Wendy who has a best friend named Bebe, the most colorful of the girls in the school. Their adventures later on made room for satire and Matt Stone and Trey Parker didn't have mercy. Among their targests include Barbara Streissand, Jon Edwards, magician David Blaine, Jesus, God, the Devil, the Anti-Christ a boy named Damian, and many other celebrities. After more than six years, South Park is still hilarious but seems to have gone on the wayside and had a bigger impact in the late 90's and up to about 2004. A film, South Park Bigger Longer and Uncut was released in 1999. Stone and Parker also released Team America in 2004. But it is for South Park that they will always be remembered. Even more than The Simpsons (which let's face it is tame compared to South Park) South Park is a kind of mirror to society and current culture. Let's hope it continues to stay current as well. Comedy Central still airs new episodes.

ABOUT THIS DVD: On this DVd The Biggest Douche in the Universe is a hilarious spoof on the John Edwards Show. Kyle catches on to Edward's trick (he doesn't really talk to the dead but uses mind control gimmicks) but the people of South Park are so dum they don't realize this and offer Kyle his own show instead. It's a hilarious joke about the fraudulent psychic business. In ""Professor Chaos"" Butters, trying desperately to be accepted into the inner circle of friends that are Kyle, Stanley and Cartman (Kenny is dead and doesn't get to come back for a while). To extract revenge on the ""society that shunned him"" he takes on a new role - the villain Professor Chaos. In the ""Aspen"" episode the gang takes a trip to the famous Ski resort and the whole thing is a spoof on 80's movies in which a fraternity or group of friends, usually underdogs, win the tournament and get the girl. If you love the 80's, this episode will be a delight. Featured songs include ""Take on Me"" and ""Don't You Forget About Me"" from the Breakfast Club. My favorite episode is Freak Strike, an outrageous parody of the Maury Povich Show in which Cartman dresses up a skanky teenage girl out of control just to win prizes.

In Jared Has Aides, the famous Jared from the subway commercials (not so famous now) admits to losing weight because he has aides which gets confused with ""AIDS"" and hilarity ensues. The Simpsons Already Did it without being crude, makes fun of the Simpsons, the only cartoon series that rivals South Park and actually surpasses it. In The Terrance and Phillip Movie the gang is excited about the new release of the Terrance and Phillip movie but have a dilemma: they don't have a tv in which to watch the previews and must constantly move from one place to another to watch it. In Bebe's Boobs Destroys Society, Bebe develops breasts prematurely and makes the boys go nuts and act like primates. It's hilarious because a surgeon actually tells her to get implants instead of reduction and when Wendy gets breast implants, hilarity ensues. In ""My Future Self"" Kyle gets to meet his future self ( a lazy, drug-addicted 32 year old loser)but finds out it's a ploy by the parents to get the kids off drugs. This is a great season and marks the apex of South Park's long running series.",1131062400,6,3973,4.682403433476395

2386240,4,B000ADWCYY,"South Park is the name of a cultish animated TV comedy that has gained an ever-growing band of devoted followers, as the show intentionally pokes on every aspect of the American culture.  Everything in the United States seems to slide towards South Park, Colorado, where a small ensemble of youthful children with foul mouths fully experience the complete American lifestyle through rather crude, yet amusing, adventures.  Nothing is too offensive, or too sacred, not to be exposed on South Park.  Thus, South Park intends to attack the whole American establishment with parody and a heavy dose of irony.  However, if there is something that the creators Trey Parker and Matt Stone might have left out, they cover themselves with the disclaimer that states, ""We apologize if South Park has left you out.""

The fans of Kenny McCormick, and the traditional Stan Marsh scream ""Oh my god, they killed Kenny!"" will unfortunately be dissappointed, as Kenny will not appear during the 6th season season, in live form.  Kenny was permantely killed at the end of season five, as he always suffered some dreadful death in every eposide until the end of season five.  However, three boys Stan, Eric Cartman, and Kyle Broflovski will build a ladder to heaven in order to visit Kenny, and he will return to possess Eric Cartman in another episode.  Besides the encounter with the otherside, these three boys will together with two newcomers, Butters and Tweek, continue their bellyaching adventures through American current events such as child molestation within the Catholic Church, child abduction, Lord of the Rings, and intolerance.

The appearance of using stop-motion with the help of construction paper (it is actually computer animated) brings South Park a feeling of being homemade.  This homemade atmosphere provides a mood that makes it hard to take the TV show seriously.  Even the opening vignette, accentuates the comical approach, by declaring, ""The following program contains coarse language and due to its content it should not be viewed by anyone."" among other things.  All of the small things that Parker and Stone do with the South Park show through irony augments the parody within the show.  This softens the shock value within the show and makes it much more amusing.  The incorporation of satire into contemporary issues is also an element that Parker and Stone use that enhances the humor.  The intentional spoofs in South Park are occasionally very cruel, yet exceptionally entertaining, as season six continues where five left off while the audience should be prepared for Kenny's reincarnation in the beginning of season seven.

South Park Season 6 offers some of the best episodes that ever have been aired and it leaves the audience with some gutsy parodies.  Personally, I miss Kenny, but it is a nice change not to have him being physically abused by Parker and Stone.  This show is definitely worth a purchase, and is something the viewer could enjoy whenever there is a brief moment of peace that can be turned into turmoil.",1128816000,8,3046,5.045908183632735
2386241,5,B000ADWCYY,"As you all know, the animated satire South Park is the story of four crude yet loveable boys in a Colorado mountain town.  Stan is the leader and peacemaker of the group and seems to have the most common sense.  He also has a weak stomach, especially when it comes to girls.  He lives with his average parents and his abusive older sister Shelly.  Kyle is the smart kid who thinks for himself and is also the only Jewish kid in SP.  He lives with his stereotypical Jewish family; his dad a successful accountant, his mom a bossy political activist, and his adopted Canadian baby brother Ike.  Then there's Cartman, the star of the show.  He is fat, dumb, mean, racist, selfish, immature, obnoxious, ill-tempered, and extremely loveable.  He also has a pretty good singing voice.  He lives alone with his single mother, who spoils him rotten (don't even ask about his father).  Finally, there's Kenny, who always seems to have the worst luck.  He's poor, his parents are alcoholics, and he dies in almost every episode.",1127952000,3,1018,4.694915254237288

2386243,4,B000ADWCYY,"""...and fightin' 'round the world!""  From the moment you hear Russell Crowe sing the chorus of his children's show (sung to the tune of The Mickey Mouse Club theme), it gets stuck in your head, and you smile every time you sing it thereafter.  I've been singing it since '02, waiting for the day I can once again watch Russell Crowe attempt to teach kids about far off places and get caught up in beating up random folk in the background.  That day, friends, is rapidly approaching.

This episode, however, is just the tip of the iceberg for yet another great season of South Park coming to DVD.  Though the masterful comedic writing of Trey Parker and Matt Stone still carries on in recent seasons, it was right after the first few that they truly shined, spiking with the tremendous season 5.  The sixth season carries over most of the hilarity , with clever jabs at Subway's Jared, pedophile priests, Rob Schnieder films, tolerating homosexual teachers, the fact that the Simpsons have done everything known to man, and a hysterical parody of the Lord of the Rings trilogy.  Sadly, there are a few episodes that don't quite hit the nail on the head.  The ""Asspen"" episode, though a nice spoof of 80's teen films, probably won't make you fall out of your chair laughing (but Butters' ""Hitler"" comes close to it).  I'll also admit that I haven't seen every episode from this season (I somehow never catch the ""Freak Strike"" and ""Child Abduction is not Funny"" episodes), but I'm willing to bet that the South Park kids didn't slow down there too much.  The bottom line is, you're going to laugh through this season.  A lot.  Dispite a few minor flaws, it's still pretty much a must-buy for South Park fans everywhere.

Also, to answer the question posted earlier...the Paris Hilton episode, ""Stupid Spoiled Whore Video Playset"", isn't until Season 8.",1126569600,9,1850,4.725856697819315

2386245,5,B000ADWCYY,"According to Trey Parker and Matt Stone themselves, Season 5 is where things started to heat up. And the fact that they killed off Kenny ""for good"" by the end of that season just makes this one even more outrageous! I can't wait to get this.

One thing, though. I've recently purchased the 5 season pack, mainly because I was waiting for the series to be sold in other regions and it didn't happen. Now, while I do prefer the mini-commentaries over the vignettes found in seasons 1 and 2, the lack of English subtitles is very annoying. I wish whoever puts these boxes out would reconsider and bring back those subtitles, as they help out a lot of International fans who sometimes have trouble understanding the boys' lines. And also, finding extra content other than Comedy Central promos would be a big plus. Stuff like the ""Dead Friend Sketch"" or the ""Spirit of Christmas"" are sorely missed.",1126483200,,894,4.658227848101266

2386269,5,B000ADWCYY,"The sixth season of South Park saw creators Trey Parker and Matt Stone using the animated Comedy Central cash cow to poke fun at anyone (Jared from the Subway commercials for one), everyone, and really, anything that pops into their heads.  Beginning with Stan, Kyle, and Cartman deciding to make Butters their fourth friend (replacing the late Kenny, who actually stayed dead, for a while anyway), and the later after he gets fired, he becomes the villainous (or so he thinks) Professor Chaos; bent on world destruction, even though everything he thinks of has already been done on the Simpsons (the instant classic ""Simpsons Already Did It"").  Also during this season, the kids and their parents take a trip to Aspen, the kids have to watch Russell Crowe's reality series so they can see the trailer for the new Terrence & Philip movie, the boys visit a farm and decide to hide the baby animals, the boys meet psychic John Edwards, and a China-esque wall gets built around the town.  The bawdy, irreverent lunacy of past seasons is maintained here to full effect, and this is animated cable TV comedy at its very best.  The only downside of season six of South Park is that after this season, the writing took a bit of a downward slide for a bit, but make no mistake, South Park still remains the reigning king of original animated cable comedy.  Definitely a must own for longtime fans of the show.",1125100800,56,1401,4.678861788617886
2386270,5,B000ADWCYY,"After five seasons of non-stop laughs and political incite, South Park began 2002 with a bang in its sixth season. This season was a season for experimenting with new ideas that would take the show in a whole new direction. For starters, Kenny McCormick, who had previously served as one of the main characters (the one who would die in almost every episode) was dead and burried. Replacing him for the first five episodes of this season was Leopold ""Butters"" Stotch. He was then fired and replaced by Tweek. Also in this season, the kids' fourth grade teacher, Ms. Choksondik, is killed and replaced by the old third grade teacher, Mr. Garrison, who instead of toting around Mr. Hat is now shoving small animals up the ass of his new teacher's assistant and boyfriend, Mr. Slave.

The following 17 episodes are included in this boxed set:

Jarred Has Aides - A great start to a great season. This episode rips on Jarred, the man who became famous for losing weight while eating at Subway. Butters quickly steps forward as one of the main characters by becoming fat, then having liposuction surgery in a plot to say that he lost weight eating at City Wok.

Asspen - Another classic episode. In this one, the boys visit Aspen, Colorado, where Stan takes on skiing to save a youth center.

Freak Strike - A fairly average episode. In this one, Butters goes on the Maury Povich show with balls on his chin, then Cartman goes on as an out-of-control child.

Fun With Veal - The boys become eco-terrorists as part of a plot to save baby calves from the veal factory, but then Stan grows sick with vaginitus.

The New Terrance and Phillip Movie Trailer - One of the funniest episodes of the season. The boys travel from house to house to watch the Russel Crowe: Fightin' 'Round the World show so that they can see the trailer for the new Terrance and Phillip movie, Asses of Fire 2.

Professor Chaos - In this landmark episode, Stan, Kyle, and Cartman fire Butters and hold auditions for a new fourth friend. A vengeful Butters then vows to bring terror and chaos to the world as he becomes Professor Chaos.

Simpsons Already Did It - This episode kicks off Tweek's reign as the fourth friend. Ms. Choksondik dies, Cartman creates a sea-ciety, and Butters comes up with diabolical scheme after diaboloical scheme only to find out that ""Simpsons did it!""

Red Hot Catholic Love - With all the priest molestation cases taking place, the boys' parents decide to become atheists. Cartman bets Kyle $20 that if you eat with your butt, you'll crap out your mouth... and wins. Meanwhile, Father Maxi journeys to the Vatican to put a stop to the priest molestation and save Catholicism.

Free Hat - Stan, Kyle, Cartman, and Tweek journey to George Lucas's house to save Raiders of the Lost Ark from being another victim to movies remade and ruined by their directors.

Bebe's Boobs Destroy Society - This is the only episode of the season that I don't like. Bebe develops boobs, the boys start acting like apes, and a horribly out-of-character Wendy gets breast implants.

Child Abduction is Not Funny - But this episode sure is. Tweek is abducted and the parents order Lu Kim, owner of City Wok, to build a city wall around South Park. With all the media reports of increased child abductions, the parents send their children off to live on their own and they become Mongolians.

A Ladder to Heaven - Tweek appears to have been fired as the fourth friend. In this, quite possibly the best episode of the season, Stan, Kyle, and Cartman build a ladder to heaven in an attempt to get their winning ticket stub back from Kenny so that they can go on a candy shopping spree. Cartman consumes Kenny's ashes and his soul starts living on inside of Cartman's body. The president is informed that Saddam Hussein is building weapons of mass destruction in heaven and decides he needs to bomb heaven.

The Return of the Fellowship of the Ring to the Two Towers - A hilarious spoof of the Lord of the Rings trilogy. Stan's parents accidentally mix up their porno with the Lord of the Rings and Butters becomes obsessed with the porno.

The Death Camp of Tolerance - Mr. Garrison is hired back as the new fourth grade teacher in place of the late Ms. Choksondik. He gets a new teacher's assistant, Mr. Slave, and shoves the classroom gerbil Lemmiwinks up his ass. Lemmiwinks goes on a Hobbit-like journey to escape from the gay man's ass while the boys are sent to tolerance camp for not tolerating their teachers' homosexual behavior.

The Biggest Douche in the Universe - Cartman is running out of time. Chef takes the boys to see John Edward so that he can communicate with Kenny's soul. Realizing that John Edward is a douche, Chef and Ms. Cartman take Cartman to Scotland so that Chef's parents can perform an exorcism on Cartman. Kyle is convinced that his deceased grandmother wants him to attend Jewleeard and so Stan tries to prove to the world that John Edward can't talk to the dead and is nothing but a douche.

My Future Self n' Me - Stan's future self comes back to the present and he's a total slob. Stan then discovers that Butters also has a future self. After some sleuthing, they find out it's all a plot by their parents to keep them off of drugs and away from alcohol. With a little help from Cartman, they plot their revenge.

Red Sleigh Down - Upon discovering that he's getting nothing but coal for Christmas, Cartman decides to bring Christmas joy to Iraq. Instead, Santa's sleigh gets shot down and he is kidnapped by the Iraqis. Stan, Kyle, Cartman, Mr. Hankey, and Jesus have to journey to Iraq to save Santa and bring Christmas joy to the people. Santa is saved, but Jesus is killed. Kenny returns at the end of the episode. Jimmy sings The 12 Days of Christmas.

This is a great season and will make an excellent addition to anyone's DVD collection. Also be sure to check out the first five seasons of South Park!",1125100800,30,5918,4.592417061611374

2386272,5,B000ADWCYY,"DEFINITE recommended buy, especially for the occasional South Park viewer. Normally, someone would tell you to buy Season Two for the fact that it contains 'definitive' episodes that describe the show. But, when Matt Stone and Trey Parker get good, it's usually later, as in the case of South Park: Season Six. Maybe a small sampler of early episodes on Comedy Central (runs all the time and they love to run the early ones), just to introduce yourselves to the characters, and just tell to yourself ""Kenny's really dead, like, for good"", and this season is awaiting.

Here's a rundown of the episodes:

Freak Strike: With Butters as the new ""friend"", they get him to appear on the Maury Povich show as a freak (""ball chin boy"" is his nickname), but runs into trouble when the freak union goes on strike and wants him as one of its mascots. Great episode solely for Cartman dressing up and acting like a trashy 16-year old whore.

Jared Has Aides: If you remember into the past enough (South Park is extremely current, this tradition continues onto today's episodes), you'll remember a certain guy named Jared who lost 200 lbs by eating Subway. Well, he comes to South Park and the boys find out his dirty secret: he has aides. No, no, no! Not the disease, but actual aides who helped him lose weight. Feeling guilty, he shares his secret upon the world...but only verbally...and without explaination. What follows his a hysterical ""Three's Company""-esque episode that Jared is totally oblivious of. It has not reran outside its premiere date (well, very rarely) on Comedy Central due to the last scene, which you'll have to see for yourself, as it's very offensive to some.

Asspen: A parody of old '80's ski resort flicks, the parents want to go on vacation, so they arrange to go to Aspen at a time-share hotel with the boys. Expecting only a 30-minute time share meeting, the parents are scammed into spending every single second there. Meanwhile, Stan is taken on by a jock who seems to be surrounded by a different world, for which Stan is somehow now a part of. Focuses mostly on Stan (though there is a great bit with Cartman and Butters about a prank called a ""Hitler"") and the parents, but it features the first incarnation of the Montage song, later to be heard in Team America.

The New Terrance & Phillip  Movie Trailer: An unique episode that really does take exactly thirty minutes, the boys are uber-excited about a trailer for the new Terrance & Phillip movie, a sequel to the film that spawned a war in the SP movie. But, they must stick through most of the strange show ""Russel Crowe Fightin' 'Round the World"", which is pretty much what the title implies. Unfortunately for them, living rooms in South Park are increasingly being filled, and the boys wind up running from one television console to the next, trying to make it just in time for the commercial breaks. This is the only episode of SP, or any tv show on DVD perhaps where it will be sort of a downside to not having commercial breaks, as the episode's entire structure comes from this. Whenever Stan says ""oh boy, the next commercial break!""...we go to black for 2 seconds, and then back. A bunch of flow is ruined there, but besides that, it is a fantastic episode and the Russel Crowe show is major fun to watch, just for his great one-liners.

Fun with Veal: The boys visit a farm, where they see baby cows waiting to be turned into veal. Stan is shocked, seeing how cute they are, and decides to become a vegetarian. Soon, he puts it even further by suckering the other boys into taking the same baby cows and hiding them into Stan's room. It's a matter of time before the media and their parents find out, and the boys stake out for days. The conclusion is bizarre, but shockingly funny. Not one of the best, but the ending with be stuck with you for quite a bit.

Professor Chaos: The boys have a tough decision to make...they have to fire Butters. He isn't good enough as Kenny, and he's not working out. His heart destroyed, Butters vows to make sure nobody experiences happiness again, and becomes Professor Chaos, bringer of no-good. He tries out many evil plans along with a new sidekick, all of which don't work. Meanwhile, the boys begin a search for a fourth friend involving their classmates in a Bachelor parody. This one is a classic, and the reality show b-plot is just icing on the cake.

Simpsons Already Did It: The previous episode abruptly ties things up by telling us three things: Butters' plans did not work, Tweek is the fourth friend and Mrs. Choksondick, the teacher, is dead. Cartman buys sea monkeys, believing that they will bring him to nirvana. Except, the sea monkeys turn out to suck, so they stick them in their teacher's coffee before she dies. Through a set of bizarre coindindences, the boys believe that the sea monkeys killed their teacher, and set off to remove the evidence. Meanwhile, Butters' continues with being Professor Chaos, coming up with now great plans with just one snafu: they all were already done on ""The Simpsons"". A great tribute to the long-lasting animated series (that paved the way for South Park) , but the Cartman/sea monkeys plot is equally hilarious. Wonderful sequel to the previous episode.

Red Hot Catholic Love: The parents feel too unsafe with the church, with the recent news of priests molesting children. They become atheists after consulting their children on what happens during Sunday School, which get them confused, especially one question: if you eat through your anus, will crap come out your mouth? Meanwhile, Priest Maxi is shocked to find he is the only priest on Earth who does not have sex with children, and sets off to the Vatican to set things straight. Watch pretty much only for the Love Boat parody and the excerpt with Martha Stewart, the rest is pretty much throwaway, one of season six's weakenesses.

Free Hat: Oh, this is a good one. This is an episode that  prevented a theatrical release. The boys are sick of going to theaters and seeing chopped-up, digitized re-releases of their favorite movies, so they set a campaign to rid the box office of this filth. Cartman advises a free gift, so they add ""Free Hat"", for which everybody thinks that the boys want to free a certain baby murderer from prision. So now its up to the boys on their own to confront George Lucas before he unleashes another special edition unto the world. This episode is so funny and true that it scared Lucas from touching up and re-releasing ""Raiders of the Lost Ark"". A must-watch episode.

Bebe's Boobs Destroy Society: Because of their teacher's death, the kids were given a four-week reprieve (in which the previous two episodes took place)...but they're back, with one difference: Bebe's breasts have developed slightly, but just enough to where the boys cluelessly notice. The have no idea at first why they are all attracted to her, but the girls, especially Wendy, do. What follows is a subtle commentary on the treatment of women in the real world, but nonetheless a laugh riot, especially when Bebe's breasts start to communicate to one another.

Child Abduction is Not Funny: ""Damn you Mongolians! Trying to break down my wall!"" The parents are scared. Child abductions are all the rage on the news, and they are watching their kids like hawks. To prevent invaders, the city has Mr. Kim (owner of City Wok) build a huge China-esque wall around the city...but maybe that isn't even enough to protect the kids. If you ask anybody about this episode, they most likely will remember only Kim's one-liners, and that's about it. Good thing, since that is the best part of the episode. The rest is mostly filler compared to it, but a good episode anyways.

A Ladder to Heaven: The boys won a candy spree in a contest they entered six months ago and Kenny has the needed ticket stub. One problem, though: Kenny is dead. To find Kenny, the boys start to build a ladder to heaven out of materials from the city dump. Town citizens are inspired and huddle around the tower, crying, remarking on how sweet the boys' mission is, eventually turning into something only South Park could do...a parody of 9/11, and a damn tasteful one at that. And it turns out the boys may not need the ladder after all when Cartman accidentally eats Kenny's ashes and soul. Meanwhile, the US government monitors the boys ascent into the skies, convinced that Saddamn Hussein (who, thanks to Satan, lives in Heaven) is building bombs up there. Hysterical, and one of the most un-PC things I have ever seen, especially at that time.

The Death Camp of Tolerance: Mr. Garrison, the newly-out-of-the-closet teacher is being promoted from kindergarten to the fourth grade, placing him as once again the boys' teacher. The reason? New laws state that if Garrison would not be promoted or if were to be fired, because he's gay, he can sue for discrimination (and millions at that!). So, he decides to act super gay to be fired, but the school does not budge, yet the students are frightened. Especially once they meet Mr. Garrison's new assistant: Mr. Slave. A gut-busting episode featuring a spot-on parody of Schindler's List. Noteworthy to watch for the change between Mr. Hat and Mr. Slave, who is prominent in later seasons.

The Biggest Douche in the Universe: Cartman is unfortunate for having such an unlucky soul like Kenny to be trapped in his body...he almost dies on multiple occasions. Chef tells Liane that Cartman could be saved if they go to see John Edwards, so they all (including Kyle and Stan [Tweek mysteriously disappears in ""Ladder to Heaven""]) fly to New York. Too bad John Edwards sucks, so Chef, Cartman and Liane go to Scotland to Chef's parents to perform an exorcism. Kyle and Stan have a plane to Colorado when Kyle takes belief into a tidbit that John Edwards gave him about his grandmother and attends a Jewish school in New York. Stan decides to head to John Edwards to help him convice Kyle to go back to South Park, but finds less than he expected. Relies on current humor, such as the Rob Schnedier film parodies, and is easily the most dated episode of the bunch, but still funny if you had a TV in 2002.

My Future Self 'N Me: Stan gets a shock when his future self appears and turns out to be a drug-addicted bum. But when Stan finds out that Butters also has a future self who is a drug-addicted bum (who likes the show Becker), something seems fishy. Meanwhile, Cartman sets up shop for a new buisness: exacting revenge on your parents by smearing crap all over the walls of your house. Smelly, but effective. A great episode with an overlay of commentary about anti-drug campaigns.

Red Sleigh Down: A treat for long-time viewers of South Park, and a shock to all those who believe in the term ""Politcal Correctness"". Cartman finds out he has to do the nicest thing ever to get a certain gift for Christmas, so he convinces the boys, with the help of Mr. Hankey, to head to the North Pole and try to bring Christmas to Iraq. Unfortunately, Santa is bombed and held hostage in Iraq, and the boys recruit Jesus to help them on their journey to the middle east to save Santa and Christmas as we know it. The season truly goes out with a bang, and the ending makes the season, as it totally abolishes everything that evolved in the show's structure that season with only a swift fifteen seconds. This is why you should watch this season in order if you haven't seen this one (or, in that case, seasons 7, 8 and 9) yet, I wouldn't want to ruin the surprise.

Well, that's South Park season six in a nutshell, and one hell of a season to own. Sure enough, there will be Matt and Trey's mini-commentaries, basically introducing the episode and saying if anything intresting happened while writing/making it in about five minutes time, but this isn't about the extras, this is about the definitive SP season to own...and this is it.",1124064000,20,11899,4.662535748331744
2386273,5,B000ADWCYY,"This is the last season of South Park that I will buy! I don't want to spend 40 dollars with the future seasons (7,8,9...).

Season 6 is full of GREAT episodes like the Rossell Crowe episode, the Simpsons episode and Lemiwinks episode. Another popular episodes are Lord of the Rings, The Marihuana, Profesor Chaos and The Rapist Priests. The Season is full of good jokes, memorable moment with the boys and the MOST IMPORTANT THING is that Butters and Tweek are the new STARS of the show.

Important Fact:

Season 7 is maybe is worth buying it because it was SOOO hilarous, but there isn't any CLASSIC episode. I think is better to record some of the episodes on VHS or buy a DVD with some of the great episodes instead of buying the ENTIRE season.

Season 8: The ONLY good episodes were the Anime and Paris Hilton episodes, the rest was SOOO weak, predictable and slow. There wasn't any HILAROUS episode (No joke after joke episodes) and no memorable moments with the boys, except for Passion of the Jew witch was good but only because Mel Gibson is CRAZY.

Season 9: WEAK until now!! If Keanu Reeves is everybody's savior then he should make the creators of South Park to go on with better ideas for the next episodes.

P.S: Don't get me wrong! Everything in South Park is funny but they could come up with some REALLY good episodes.

Adios.",1123977600,2,1343,4.524793388429752

-This one isn't that funny. Mainly because it's so dated. If you didn't/don't know/care about John Edwards, about 90% of the jokes are worthless.

* Professor Chaos

A pretty good episode, but repeated a lot. My mother loves Butters so if you like him then yes, you'll like this episode.

* Asspen

A few moments, but a pretty slow moving episode with a lot of jokes that are just reaching. The best moment is the Montage song (also in Team America movie with slight changes).

* Freak Strike

A cartman/butters episode. Cartman's role is much funnier. Again, a bit light on the quality jokes, but in this case the episode as a whole manages to piece together into a pretty decent ""overall"" joke. Rarely repeated.

* Jared Has Aides

I don't remember this one too well, but it's never been repeated that I've seen.

* The Terrance & Phillip Movie

Again, I don't remember it very well. Also rarely repeated.

* Fun With Veal

Only saw half this episode. Kind of a Cartman's an ass/social commentary episode. Not that great. Rarely repeated.

* Simpsons Already Did It

Decent episode, but repeated constantly. Another Butters episode.

* Red Hot Catholic Love

Good episode, kind of falls apart at the end (seems like they are trying to apologize for it almost). Rarely repeated.

* Free Hat

Very funny episode, if a bit autistic. I've never seen this repeated, but have been told it has been once.

* Bebe's Boobs Destroy Society

Never saw this episode, so obviously rarely repeated.

* Child Abduction is Not Funny

Go**amn mongolians! Break down my sh**ty wall! Good episode.

* A Ladder to Heaven

Very funny episode, but also dated. Fortunately if you remember the godawful capitalizing off the 9/11 tragedy during 2001 and 2002 (commemorative coins selling for $25 anyone?) most of the jokes will ring true. Again, I've never seen it repeated.

* The Death Camp of Tolerance

One of the best episodes ever. lemmiwinks. Again, almost never repeated.

* My Future Self n' Me

Mediocre episode, kind of lives in the shadow of Cherokee hair tampons (lacks cheech and chong). A few moments, but another social commentary episode that really seems frivilous.

* Red Sleigh Down

Pretty decent episode, but possibly the most sacriligious South park ever. If you have a good sense of humor however, it's quite funny.",1123545600,7,2354,4.781094527363184
