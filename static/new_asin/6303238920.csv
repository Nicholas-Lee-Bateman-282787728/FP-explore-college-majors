7841478,4,6303238920,"~ Not a bad documentary of her ""Last Days"" alive. Many theories are presented, without absolute certainty proof of any of them. It's an overview of what ""could have"" happened, but not necessarily what DID happen, exactly. What I liked about it the most was that it was filmed directly at Marilyn's Last house on 5th Helena Drive, Brentwood. The film's narrator's are from a TV program formerly known as ""HARD COPY."" The program itself is in color and runs about 1 hour in length. The conclusion lets you, the viewer, decide on your own what may have happened and I found it thought provoking and intriguing.
If you own a VHS/DVD recorder, you may dupe it over to a blank DVD. It worked for me and came out great at speed 1 hour. That was the best quality. Recommended viewing for any Marilyn ""fan"".",1454976000,2,798,4.510344827586207
