Well acted and shot this film leaves and impact that may affect you even if you never gave much thought to animal rights or are an opponent.  Especially poignant is the film's inclusion of the AETA - animal enterprise in terrorism act, a bill passed that makes an animal rights activist subject to prosecution as a terrorist.  Imagine if civil rights activists were considered terrorists!  Cameo by my dear friend portraying a lawyer.  See this film no matter which side of the issue you happen to be.",1464739200,,622,4.712962962962963

8652263,5,B00JLV4LX6,"This ""movie film"" about animal rights is the most thorough, thought-provoking animal film I have ever seen and I've seen them all in my years of being an animal rights person since 1982.

Bold Native covers all the levels of passion from animal people and it does an excellent job! I loved the film from beginning to end.

The acting is well done, and the cinematography is terrific. You'll laugh, cry, get angry, raise your fists...show all kinds of emotion as you watch Bold Native. Even though it's a ""movie"" it tells the facts.

This film needs to be redistributed to theatres again because the message is still fresh today and needs to be told over again to the general public.

Check out their website too for more information!

Loves it!",1370131200,3,744,4.648854961832061
8652264,5,B00JLV4LX6,"I loved this film. It was warm and touching, yet horrible and made me sick to my stomach. Everything that the film intended to do. It presented any argument you could need to stop eating meat and supporting the factory farming industry. The reactions to the activists were in my mind the ones that stuck longest. I have become vegan after seeing this film and will organise a showing of this film at our university in Sweden. Thanks for a wonderful film!",1333929600,,454,4.548780487804878
8652265,5,B00JLV4LX6,"This movie delves into a ""topic"" that is too horrible, but true, to be discussed or viewed on ""mainstream"" media.
It is realistic,interesting, and presents this subject in a way that can be absorbed by the average person.
It needs to be PROMOTED by all people interested in eliminating the abominable way animals are treated in this culture.
I can't believe it hasn't won ANY awards by independent film societies, Sundance, animal groups, etc.
Watch this movie, and tell others about it.",1329264000,5,487,4.951219512195122
8652266,5,B00JLV4LX6,GREAT MOVIE. A real look into animal activists actions and lives. They are so villianized when all they want to do is the right thing and for these companies to do the humane and moral thing for animals. RIVETING,1325289600,2,212,4.461538461538462
8652267,5,B00JLV4LX6,"This is an incredibly well done independent movie that I highly recommend. It is a well balanced, artfully presented look at the animal liberation movement. Don't miss it!",1311724800,8,171,5.142857142857143
8652268,4,B00JLV4LX6,"Astonishingly, nobody has written a review yet on Amazon of this most laudable film.  More astonishingly still, nobody seems to have even heard of this quality, independent production that deals with a social issue of fundamental significance, as opposed to the synthetic fluff that reliably dazzles Lefties and that the Sundance channel seems relentlessly intent on serving up to its devoted following of politically very-correct viewers. A travesty of justice and decency going on that you can personally witness without traveling to Haiti or Chechnya or Darfur or wherever else in the world the newest humanitarian-crisis-du-jour is abrewing; something whose dark outline you can perceive by going no further than the nearest Kentucky Fried Chicken or IHOP restaurant.  ""Bold Native"" deals with the Animal Liberation Front, the number one domestic ""terrorist"" threat on the FBI's list of bogeymen. The movie follows one ALF operative (played by Jaoquin Pastor) as he attempts to organize a simultaneously-executed, cross-country series of ALF raids on research laboratories and factory farms.  Along the way we encounter other disparate members and factions populating the animal rights movement, from a conscience-stricken legislative lobbyist to latter-day hippies to an FBI snitch.  Randolph Mantooth, the only professional actor I recognized in the film, plays the lead figure's father trying to rescue the son from his errant radicalism in a remarkably affective performance.  We also learn about something called the Animal Enterprise Terrorism Act, overwhelminigly passed by Congress in 2006, which effectively equates people who rescue animals from abusive situations or sabotage the machinery of their torture with crazed jihadists intent on crashing airliners into skyscrapers! (Apparently, the ACLU lobbyists who assiduously watch over our rights and freedoms were out-of-the-office or too busy worrying about gay marriage laws to have noticed when this bit of proto-fascist legislation was being proposed and ultimately passed by all of 5 congressmen present in the House.)
  Everyone associated with this film, from the director to the camera man to the bit actors, deserve critical acclaim for the technical skill, professionalism, and courage with which they tackled a subject that other independent film producers apparently thought insufficiently trendy or, more likely, their corporate sponsors found too hot to handle.  Anyone who wishes to understand what the ALF is about and what motivates its participants should view this film.",1310342400,12,2554,5.650130548302872
