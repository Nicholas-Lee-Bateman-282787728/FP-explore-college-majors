8016148,4,B0001Q23S0,"The Konchalovscky epic, 'Siberiade', casts a gloomy brush over the backwoods community of Yelan, for centuries connected to the greater world by a river which freezes during winter. A road is swathed through the surrounding conifers, commenced in pre-revolutionary days by a crazed, visionary axeman. It is completed through the agency of his son, after the uprising, in the quest for oil to run the new republic's machinery. The cold star that guides men through the murmuring forest to the swamp where the black gold lies, is a key recurring motif and assists the pantheistic notions of the director(the earth as a sentinent being often purveyed in Tarkovsky's films, also). It's an ambitious plot, replete with internecine rivalries, lusts and so on, reminiscent of the Cartwrights on the Ponderoso, in short, a Bonaza of Siberian proportions. And though the dialogue isn't great,it is the landscape, Konchalovsky's own visionary reading of it, that is the rivetting star of the film, its mood and magnitude - the one indubitable, obstinate fact that he doesn't regard with pity or sarcasm. The brilliant war scene (reminiscent of Tarkovsky's,'Ivan's Childhood'), shot in black and white, the derangement awaiting Alexi in the swamp, and the destruction of the oil derrick are great stanzas in this big picture.",1109635200,4,1314,5.232227488151659
