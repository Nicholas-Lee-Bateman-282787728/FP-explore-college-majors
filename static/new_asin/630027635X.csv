310224,5,630027635X,"Boy, do I EVER remember this movie! I was about 10 when it came out and I remember loving it so much. I've been looking for this movie for awhile, but I couldn't exactly remember the title. I knew it had the words, ""Spell and Freedom"", but that was it. I'm happy my determination paid off. :) It was inspirational enough for me to have such an impact to remember this almost 20 years ago. I do hope they'll release it on DVD soon. There are just too many movies out there that haven't had their turn on the DVD list. I hope ""Girl who spelled Freedom"", is on one of the top lists.",1126656000,21,579,4.087719298245614
310225,5,630027635X,"Very inspiring movie. I saw this movie in the 80's on TV. Despite the terrible war in her country, she and her family escaped the nightmare and later settled in north America. This Cambodian girl and her family knew nothing about US and english. Linn Yann fought hard to win the Spelling Bee Contest.

If you have children, this true story of Linn Yann can be a good role model.",1092614400,16,378,4.4
310226,5,630027635X,"I saw this when it was featured as the Disney Sunday Night Movie back in the '80s!  I have it all memorized (except the foreign language parts...).  This is a story about a young girl who escaped the horrible life she had to endure in her own country.  They have to learn everything about American life.  I love this movie and reccommend it to EVERYONE.  It's definitely a family movie because I saw it first when I was 10 or so (I'm 22 now).  If I could, I'd meet Linn Yann.  It's a real dream of mine.",1017273600,10,503,4.123711340206185

7809527,5,630027635X,"When I was a kid, this VHS was at my local library. I made my mother take it out over and over. I thought the story was so touching, and it dealt with very heavy issues (war, refugees), but in a kid-friendly way. It's a shame it's not on DVD.",1386547200,4,242,3.86
7809528,4,630027635X,"A shame that they haven't released it on DVD yet. It is a great movie and I remember it well. For the longest time I couldn't figure out what the name of the movie was, but always new it was an Asian girl who was in a spelling bee. Hey Disney, re-release this movie from your vaults!",1377302400,3,283,3.982456140350877
7809529,4,630027635X,"Just saw this film again on VHS, after seeing it so many years ago, and it is still such a good film. I too wonder why it is not on DVD. I also think that it is very important for American kids to see this, now more than ever, as kids' feelings of  entitlement have gone through the roof. Linn is just heartbreaking, with her courage, spirit and amazing intelligence!

The two things that bothered me, and I have seen this also in accounts of international adoptions from the 1970s, were that it didn't occur to the Thrashes to learn ONE word of Cambodian, in order to make even the most basic communication possible. There was a scene in the film where Mr. Thrash is learning the names of some body parts in Cambodian, but they had been there for many weeks by then, with no way to communicate, and it was done more as a game than as a basis for actual communication. People used to feel that English was the only language, and that those coming here had to learn it or lump it. I sincerely hope that people adopting internationally now have a more humane and accepting approach. The other thing that bugged was the Thrashes' daughter, who was absolutely spoiled rotten. She spoiled the movie for me the first time I saw it too. Even though she knew the level of deprivation and loss the Yanns had suffered, even though she knew of the courage and strength it took for them to come to a new world and try to survive, all she did was whine and complain about not getting new sneakers or because her mama wasn't there to see her cheerleading tryouts one time, as she continued to live in her comfortable home with everything she wanted around her. Poor baby!!!  I wanted her parents to have a ""come to Jesus"" meeting with her but they never did, just went on coddling and apologizing to her.

Otherwise, great film, and after Googling, I have learned that all the Yann kids went on to successful lives! YAY!",1374364800,,1906,4.40625

KEEP TO REMBERS ALL GROW UP ACTION GREAT.",1314921600,,112,3.9130434782608696
7809531,5,630027635X,"This is one of the best movies for young people to see! I want to show it to my kids at school. Can't something be done to make it available? So many American kids do not understand how wonderful this country is. They don't understand how grateful they should be to live here and have what they enjoy. The sense of entitlement I see deeply saddens me. This film, telling the story of a Cambodian refugee who ecaped war and abject poverty, is incredibly thought provoking for middle schoolers and high schoolers. Afterschool programs need to be showing films like this instead of the latest Spongebob and other films of that ilk. Disney, you've made some good movies. Why aren't they available? This is just one of my list!",1283385600,9,722,4.604651162790698
