3049208,5,B0010K4Y5Q,This is an excellent history of the Armenian people and their ability to survive despite incredible circumstances over the years.  The Armenians always survive and move on with or without a country.  Extraordinary. My grandfather survived the Hadjin massacres and made it to America eventually where he raised his family in peace.  His attitude says wonders about the Armenian people.
