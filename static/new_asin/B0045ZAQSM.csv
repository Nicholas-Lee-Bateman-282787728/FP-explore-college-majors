4263889,3,B0045ZAQSM,"As we all know it, food is federative. In American movies, like in Stanley Tucci's&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Big-Night/dp/0767802535/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Big Night</a>&nbsp;for instance, culinary delights serve more as a way to abolish social classes differences or to fulfill the ever vivacious American dream. But Fatih Akin is a German, of Turkish parentage, living in Europe so he uses this theme differently and emphasizes the power of food in the fight against racism or xenophobia. Isn't the Greek Zinos' backache finally cured by a Turkish (Greece and Turkey still have a big problem to solve) physical therapist ? Enjoyable.",1322179200,,688,6.252631578947368
4263890,5,B0045ZAQSM,"This is a German production, with English subtitles. The star is Adam Bousdoukos, who masterfully portrays Zinos Kazantsakis, owner of the Soul Kitchen Restaurant in Hamburg. When the film opens, the Soul Kitchen's menu is simple and features things like fish steaks with French fries. The sound system blares soul music. (The soundtrack is excellent.)  There seems to be a small, but loyal, customer base of working-class folk who like cold beer.  The building is old and poorly maintained. We get the impression that the Soul Kitchen is doing little more than scraping along.

Zinos is an honest man, a loyal man, straightforward in the way he handles people.  His instinct is to trust others. Too bad that some of the people close to him don't share these qualities. His brother is a problem (big problem) gambler. His beautiful girlfriend leaves him for a job assignment in China.  He hires a chef (a chef in this joint?) who has an explosive temper and turns out haute cuisine that drives away faithful customers.

I don't want to say more about the plot, but the big question becomes: Can Zinos handle all that life throws at him? Life throws all kinds of stuff at him. There's a lot more than what I hint at above.

This production is often tagged as a comedy. But I did not laugh much at all.

Watch it and see how funny you think it is.",1313452800,,1345,4.598326359832636
4263891,5,B0045ZAQSM,"This film follows the life of a restaurant owner - a greek living in Hamburg - through various ups and downs.  It starts off slowly and builds and builds....  the various characters and threads of the story come together so well, that by the middle of the movie you can't wait to see what happens next.  And what happens is funny in various different ways - some of it quite subtle, but with a fair amount of overt slapstick.
  Although the title is ""Soul"" Kitchen, the music is a mix of funk, r&b, soul, jazz, and rock.  I thought it was better that recognizable musical artists and hits were not used.  A fair amount of the ""action"" occurs without dialogue - you watch events unfold as the music continues to play.  More recognizable artists might have been distracting in this context.
  I think the point of the movie might be summed up by an early conversation between the restaurant owner and his new high-end chef.  In that conversation the chef suggests they make ""food for the soul"", but I think the actual word used might have translated better as ""food for the spirit"".
  I had seen Head On by this director, but that [excellent] film bears little relation to this one, except that they are both very well made [and a few actors are in both films, not that you'd know - the characters in Soul Kitchen are quite unique!].
  Watch this film! - you WILL laugh at the twists and turns...",1304726400,,1394,4.476190476190476
4263892,5,B0045ZAQSM,"one of the best films i've seen in a while. funny, with a bit of romance. you never know what's going to happen next!",1304035200,,117,3.9166666666666665
4263893,4,B0045ZAQSM,"If you're expecting Fatih Akin as the serious master ""The Edge of Heaven"" and ""Head-on"", you won't find him here. ""Soul Kitchen"" is a nifty little comedy, set in a seedy restaurant in the seedy bohemian Wilhemsburg district of Hamburg.  Owner Zinos, a young Greek German whose back is out for most of the story and whose girlfriend is off in China, makes junk food that his puffy longtime customers down with beer.  Everything changes, though, in the throes of neighborhood gentrification.  Everything.  Running a restaurant is a thinly-veiled allegory for filmmaking--whether you give people the junk they want, or make fabulous food and find/cultivate an audience to love it.  There's a great love of humanity here.",1296259200,,717,5.094017094017094
4263894,4,B0045ZAQSM,"I caught this at my local cinema and had very few expectations except that I knew the protagonist looked a lot like Jim Morrison and that the film got its title from a Doors song. The script to this film is very tight, particularly because it centers the action around one location (a rundown fast-food joint) and then populates it with a diverse cast of characters, all with their peculiar quirks and believable motivations. The plot moves well and it would be hard to finish this film without smiling. Definitely worth watching.",1295395200,,530,4.771739130434782
4263895,4,B0045ZAQSM,"This frothy, light, slightly shapeless but endearing comedy is further proof of the protean nature of Akin's amazing talents.

While nowhere near as good as his great, dark comedy-drama `Head On' or his complex. philosophical `The Edge of Heaven', or even his delightful music documentary 'Crossing the Bridge' - all of which are must-sees - I appreciate that Akin seems more interested in exploring different genres and stories than creating a signature style.

This is the kind of comedy that makes you smile more than laugh, and is stronger on character and acting than on comic set pieces, but even the jokes that don't work aren't annoying.  Its too sweet and full of life to get cranky at.

A shaggy, likable young Greek man living in Germany tries to start his own restaurant, juggling his ex-con brother, his out-of town girlfriend,  his slightly insane chef, and a rival who wants to take over his space and develop condos.  It's not an `important' film, but it captures something wonderful about being young and trying to find your place in the world.",1293667200,3,1061,4.866666666666666
4263896,4,B0045ZAQSM,"I must admit I'm not familiar with this director's previous works and didn't know what to expect here. I saw the trailer and it looked good so I thought I'd give it a go. Glad I did.

Zinos owns a joint. They serve basic, burger level food, as well as alcohol, to the middle of the middle of society. It's all nondescript. His gal is leaving him for a big promotion in Shanghai. His brother, a daytime parolee from prison wants a job in name only so he can continue his nefarious ways. The guy who rents the back of the industrial building they're in, to finish his boat, never pays his rent. His friend who's in a rock band needs the restaurant as a practice space. The local health department wants to shut him down. The tax collectors are after him for back taxes and a real estate developer wants to buy the building. Oh yeah. He's also thrown his back out.

Things aren't going well for Zinos. He's being pulled in a lot of directions and a lot of bad things are happening to him. But he is what he is, and because of this the stars finally line up and a lot of good things begin to happen. Many disparate circumstances converge and things take a turn for the better. Way better.

This is a good-hearted movie. You love the characters. They're a goofy lot with good souls. And when things turn good you couldn't be happier for them. What really works here is the unexpectedness of it all. Were this made in Hollywood you could write it yourself and set your watch to it. But little that happens here is on any map you've traveled. So many great and wonderful things happen here it becomes a simple pleasure to watch. But, even as the really good things happen here, the really bad things continue to happen, so the viewer is never really certain how all this will turn out.

Zinos is a great character. He's a Greek in Germany and that alone puts a cock-eyed edge on things. His brother, who is a ne're-do-well on the outside, steps up and becomes a more complex character as things move on. Lucia, though not the main focus, still sticks with you as a memorable character. Her developing romance with Zinos' brother is interesting. The production values, though not extravagant, are good enough to make you forget you're watching a movie. One of my only gripes here is that I wish they'd have come up with enough trump to afford some genuine American soul recordings instead of the weak covers.

This is a weird and wonderful movie. It's a joy to watch. Some of the scenes might be a bit too comic but it's a minor quibble compared to the overall greatness of the movie. If you like leaving the beaten path this is a great journey.",1293062400,7,2637,4.395491803278689
4263897,5,B0045ZAQSM,"If you're a fan of the German-born (of Turkish heritage) filmmaker, Fatih Akin, you will - like me - run not walk to see his latest creation, 'Soul Kitchen'.  Akin's masterpiece is, of course, the unsurpassed&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Head-On-Gegen-die-Wand/dp/B0009VND0E/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Head-On [Gegen die Wand</a>] - one of the best five movies you'll ever see.  His&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Edge-of-Heaven/dp/B001DB6J82/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Edge of Heaven</a>&nbsp;comes very close to repeating that magic.  Fans of Akin know that in those two works he delves deeply into Germany's rich and widening cultural and demographic ties with Turkey.  In fact, 'Edge of Heaven' starts in Turkey and takes us back and forth across the two countries.

Here, Akin turns his storyline to another ethnic community deeply embedded into the fabric of German society: the Greeks.  Adam Bousdoukos (Akin's co-writer here - he had a bit role in 'Head-On') and Moritz Bleibtreu (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Baader-Meinhof-Complex-2pc-Ws-Sub/dp/B0030Y1282/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Baader Meinhof Complex (2pc) (Ws Sub)</a>) play brothers Zinos and Illias Kazantsakis respectively.  Zinos is the entrepreneur in the process of re-inventing his erstwhile greasy spoon restaurant.  Illias is his ne'er-do-well brother who needs Zinos' support to make his terms of prison parole stick.

Unlike his two previous films, Akin displays a flair for comedy here, though - Akin being Akin - even the laughs have an edge and manic verve that gives you a product a fair pace from light, breezy Rom-Com or Judd Apatow territory.  That fact is underscored when the inimitable Birol nel pops on to the screen as tempestuous chef, Shayn Weiss. nel's trademark intensity is seared into the eyeballs of anyone who's seen 'Head On.'  His portrayal of Cahit Tomruk in that film was nothing short of remarkable.  nel plays a supporting role here, but you can't take your eyes off of him any time he's on the screen.  In 'Soul Kitchen,' Chef Weiss' irascible nature hardly conceals his immense talents in the kitchen.

Also good here are: Pheline Roggan as Zinos' long-time first girlfriend, Nadine; Anna Bederke as bartender/waitress/object of brothers' affection, Lucia; Wotan Wilke Mhring as over-the-top property developer/villain, Thomas Neumann; and - best of all - Catrin Striebeck as an imperious, exacting restaurant inspector.  She's a unique beauty who never holds anything back on-screen.",1287705600,14,2620,6.13972602739726

It's a great fun and funny movie anyway (as Moritz Bliebtrau movies often are).  It has the qualities needed for a language learning movie (which are rare) - the dialogue takes place mainly in short bursts, the speaking referring to concrete events that are happening at that moment.  Comedies are generally better than dramas for this.  If you like this movie, also check out Bliebtrau's ""Im July""  (In July), a similar classy, hilarious romp perfect for practicing German>",1487203200,,649,4.8545454545454545

8416920,5,B0045ZAQSM,"Soul Kitchen's storyline has been related in previous reviews and needn't be rehashed here.  The movie is about life in Hamburg.  All the characters are so quintessentially Hamburg it is like taking a dive into the city and coming back out at the end.  The soundtrack is wonderfully complimentary and adds another dimension to the movie.  Fatih Akin has captured the essence of the city in such a direct, unsentimental and unaffected way - it's simply marvelous.  Truly a masterpiece.",1381276800,,484,5.0
8416921,4,B0045ZAQSM,"But very easy to watch. It had enough humour to remain engaging; even a few belly laughs such as the Skype encounter, the scene at the family funeral and how to fix a dodgy back-a scene not for the faint of heart. Overall, it was a birdbath of a feel good movie, where it was easy to see what was coming. Too full of beautiful people-but then did watch it after an episode of a Norwegian TV series where being ugly was an art form. ""Soul Kitchen"" has a tidy ending, great photography but falls over with a story dressed up as something anarchic-which it was not. Somewhere between a feel good-and guy-chick flick-still gave it a four because it works.",1366848000,,651,4.3884297520661155
8416922,5,B0045ZAQSM,"I grew up in Germany for the first few years of my life and have gone back regularly. Its always hard to find a good German film thats not only funny but tells a good story. Soul Kitchen however does just that, it makes me want to cry but laugh the whole way through. This is a must must buy for any film lover of international film  or even other Germans out their wanting to see a great film. Think Ramsay's Kitchen Nightmares but in a German light comedy.",1362355200,,458,4.146067415730337
8416923,3,B0045ZAQSM,"Soul Kitchen, along with Fatih Akin's only other comedy film (as far as I know) is once again an intelligent, light hearted affair filled with themes of romance, class, quirky characters and most of all good but simple comedy.

It tells the story of a Greek/German man trying to juggle a realtionship with a girlfriend who's relocated to China and a restuarant that is barely making a profit. You throw in a caring but irresponsible brother who's has repeated day release permission from prision, an ex classmate who's a real estate dealer that tries everything to get our main charcacter to sell the restaurant in order to sell it to a wealthy investor, an eccentric and volatile chef, an old time sailor that lives on the premises (for free as he can never pay the rent) and some of the brothers' criminal friends, you get a good set of varied enough characters that help create the comedy and drama.

In my opinion it's the least best of the 5 Fatih Akin movies I've seen (having also seen edge of heaven, short sharp shock, head on and in july) but nevertheless it's definitely enjoyable to watch and like all his films (although i can't remember how head on finishes) it ends on a positive note that provides the charcater with renewed hope for the future and puts a smile on the film watchers face. Overall, don't expect the heavy, powerful impact of head on or edge of heaven (which i prefer) as this is obviously a comedy, unlike those two. Just sit back and enjoy the dialogue, comedy and drama that is derived from this fast paced and upbeat movie. Romantics will defintely enjoy it too.",1356825600,,1597,4.6
