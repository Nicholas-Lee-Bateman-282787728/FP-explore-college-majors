8575619,4,B009WS9TD0,"This is a MYSTERY, and not a children's film.  I would definitely not show this film to a small child.  It was probably misclassified because the little boy gave an excellent performance.  Four of us watched the film together and we all tried to guess the ending.  We didn't succeed until the very last minute.  Although it was a cop story, it was not violent.  Probably if you like MURDER SHE WROTE, you would enjoy this film.

The actors were good, but sometimes it seemed like the actresses were over directed and not real women.  There were a couple of serious moments when we broke into spontaneous laughter.  The subtitles could have been better.  The sheep mentioned throughout the film was a goat.  When there were closeups of Chinese documents, there should have been subtitles. Overall, it was a good story and one I will watch again.",1359763200,,844,4.673469387755102
