8411344,3,B000NOKMD8,"This is a 2 disk set-periods 1 and 2 are on disk one, period 3 and OT are on Disk 2-which is not called out in the description. Quality is stellar until the OT period on disk 2, at which point the images become shaky and blurry. Tried disk on 3 DVD players to no avail. Does not appear to be an issue on my laptop DVD player though. I have an email in to NCAA on demand to hopefully rectify, but I would be hesitant to purchase this item as the OT period is a crucial piece of this game.",1175990400,,487,3.8316831683168315
