8121537,2,B000EBGFBI,"I purchased this video as well as several others that focus on the sport of drifting.

This video centers on two things:

1. The driving demonstrations of the Drift Alliance in several locations, including Costa Rica

2. The antics and wild partying of the Drift Alliance members on those locations prior or after the demonstrations

The video is organized by location, and each segment includes both parts above stated (driving video and party video). There are some minor comments from the Drift Alliance members as well.

Video quality varies from place to place. Notably, most of Costa Rica's footage is out of focus. I'd say everything seems to be filmed with a handycam.

Sound quality and volume varies very much between the different segments. Notably, I always cranked up the volume during the comments sections hoping they had something interesting to say, and got startled by the immediately following driving sections that are play along with hard rock music.

So, about the driving:

The Drift Alliance members are highly skilled professional drivers, and they perform great shows in the video. No wonder they have a sponsor such as Falken.

However, there's no instructional value from their drifting as there is practically no talking about the car's set up or techniques they use. There virtually isn't any in-car cameras focusing on pedalwork or the use of e-brakes or weight shifting. Most shots of their driving is from exterior cameras either mounted on the cars or from the spectator's point of view.

Still, it's enjoyable to see the demonstrations if only from a spectator's point of view.

Now about the partying:

It would seem from the video that these guys only do driving and parties. The partying however tends to feature mostly drunk people, people drinking, guys in underwear (drunk), people hitting each other or general bashing.

This is the part that I did not enjoy, and is the part that could set a bad example for younger audiences, as it can be associated to the ""cool"" drivers that the Drift Alliance are.

Moreover, there is the obvious no-no of doing drinking and then driving. (Remember you can still have the effects of alcohol even one or two days after ingesting it)

If you want to really learn more about drifting and some of the Japanese culture, I'll recommend much more the JDM Option series. There's are funny (some japanese characters behave almost like the cartoons) and fun to watch. And they teach you about the sport and have a lot of in-car footage so you can see how the drivers drive. I personally like the ""Drift Like Nomuken"" volume.",1176768000,2,2594,4.890410958904109
