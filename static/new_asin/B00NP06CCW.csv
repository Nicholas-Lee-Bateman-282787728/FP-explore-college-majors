6674963,2,B00NP06CCW,"Look, I am a Cher fan of her music. Her movies, so-so. Only Mask appeals to men, she makes chick-flicks. Out of all the things to put on Blu Ray they chose these ?

It was awful. How about some more Sonny & Cher Comedy Hour shows on Blu Ray ?

Or her older concerts.",1411344000,2,266,3.8181818181818183
6674964,4,B00NP06CCW,"I'm SO glad to hear this is finally coming out on something other than VHS. This was a wonderful play that Robert Altman directed on-stage with the same cast -- on Broadway. It was well-loved at the time -- especially the star power! It may have dated a little in the intervening years, but it is wonderful to know we'll have those performances on film. While the play was having its run, Altman arranged to direct the film -- in 16mm! -- in a studio in Manhattan, so in the evenings, the cast would head over there and they filmed it on what was basically a recreation of the stage set on Broadway. So this is a unique look behind the scenes at an interesting play about women who have a lot in common -- and a few things NOT in common -- and is fun, funky, and ultimately heartwarming. Looking forward to the release!",1411084800,29,819,4.290322580645161

Didn't get much attention.
Cost $800,000 to make.
Made: $2,300,000 total world receipts
We've lost Karen/Sandy and Director Altman.
BUT CHER..always shines.  She just puts a smile on your face, be it in a movie or see her live in concert (D2K Tour '14).
So its worth purchasing / streaming or renting.",1411084800,15,322,4.75
6674986,5,B00NP06CCW,This has been one of my favorite movies for years. It finally came out on DVD...finally. All of the actresses did a great job and the movie has some of the best dialogue I've ever heard in a movie. I have probably watched this movie a dozen times and enjoy it every time.

The performances are uniformly great, and no one unravels a story like Robert Altman. This is Cher before her movie career took off, when everyone thought her career was cold as ice after her TV show ended. This movie shows why she became a great film star and eventually won an Oscar. Sandy Dennis (a twitchy, nervous actress I don't often enjoy) is excellent as a twitch, nervous character.

Great performances by all, astounding performance by the most regretted Sandy Dennis.  I've been waiting for years for this DVD to finally come out.  This is a cult film, but so good that it should be much better known than it actually is.  Bravo, Altman, you've always been ""out there"" on the edges, onn the brink, ahead of the curve..

Although this is a 5 Star movie..the digital transfer is shameful.

One of my all time favorite films. Been waiting an eternity for it to be released on DVD..and then when I heard it was a Blu-Ray..I was over the moon...until i started watching. Seriously..why bother with the transfer at all. I think my worn out VHS copy looks better. This transfer is far from what any of us expected...this is a sad sad tribute to such a wonderful film experience. To charge $25 for this is an even sadder blow. Don't waste your money...this film deserves a REMASTER not a crappy transfer from VHS.

Back to the drawing board and back to waiting for this film to get what it deserves.

For me - each and every actor is amazing to watch. Sandy Dennis was a unique talent and the camera catches each and every one of her mannerisms, all of them a joy to watch. And Cher - absolutely amazing and emotional in her performance. Throw in a young Kathy Bates and the talented Karen Black and it's friggin' HEAVEN! I hadn't seen the movie in years - last time was in the 80's on a very ""dirty"" VHS tape. To have it now preserved on DVD is great so that I can watch it over and over.

6675027,5,B00NP06CCW,"...as it did for The Disciples of James Dean to be reunited (1955-1975 for those of you playing at home). I'll add to the chorus of laments that there is only one extra but even in ""Altman"", the coffee-table book retrospective recently released in Dec. '14, this film just has a few pages of shoot history (and almost no reminiscences of the Broadway run, which was a disappointment). For those who love this movie as much as I as I do and want to know more, seek out Pauline Kael's review in ""Taking it All In"" (apply titled 'The Magician'). As for a more detailed film history, 5 & Dime fans will probably have to wait for posthumous biographies of Kathy Bates or Cher; this movie jump-started their film careers.",1421020800,,715,4.507692307692308

6675033,4,B00NP06CCW,"Terrific to finally have this on disc. I had the laser disc, from 20 years ago, and it remained one of the only Altmans that wasn't on dvd. I am a big Robert Altman fan. The fact that this is blu ray was a great thing, but since the film was shot in 16mm, the added boost wasn't really all that necessary. It looks very nice, much different than the laser. I was disappointed there was no commentary. I saw this film when it was first released, and a couple of years ago, at a screening of it in Columbus at the Wexner Center with the author in attendance. The original play premiered in Columbus. So, I figured they'd have him do a commentary. There is, though, an excellent interview with him.",1419984000,3,695,4.2727272727272725
6675034,5,B00NP06CCW,"Who knows who, where or when some new trend, some new icon will hit the population right between the eyes, will speak to some unnamed, maybe un-nameable, feeling that makes a person whole for a few minutes. You can name the icons in a couple of minutes though the ones that strike your own generation most easily come to mind and that for my generation would include the unseen subject of Come Back To The Five And Dime Jimmy Dean, Jimmy Dean,  James Dean. Not everybody, including this reviewer, did like the women from that small Texas town did and form a club, create a shrine to, or commemorate the personage of James Dean but many drew some kind of sustenance from his life, his story, and that mumbling confusion about what was happening to him in a world that he did not create, and which he had no say in creating that he projected on the screen. That look stirred many more people than those aficionados like the women in this film.

This is an intriguing film in many ways from the single set setting of the inside of a Woolworths Five and Dime store to the dramatic secrets that these women have held within themselves since they formed the James Dean Fan Club in 1955 and had enshrined his memory psychically and psychological since his death that year. There was probably no more iconic site in small town America in the 1950s beside some steepled church or the post office on Main Street than the local branch of the national Woolworths chain. That home for every cheap gimcrack known to humankind was central to the growing up experience of lots of small town baby-boomers and their older brothers and sisters who bought their first small gifts for some sweetheart there, or had something to eat at the lunch counter (make mine a grilled cheese sandwich and lime rickey in season, please at the one I frequented in Uphams Corner), or, and here is where we separate out the generations, find out who was touched by the Dean glow, played the jukebox three songs for a quarter that was conveniently located within arms reach at that counter. Later events, the sit-ins of early 1960s down south to integrate those damn counters (and support efforts by those in the North who picketed in front of the store in Boston) would seriously tarnish the image of that idyllic scene as would the triumph of the mall in finishing such stores off in small town downtown.

Strangely this film although it is about devotees of the James Dean mystique is very little about him and plenty about what drove the various personalities to join the club  and to keep the flame alive twenty years later. And the almost mythical hold that his person held in their lives, for good or evil. Apparently James Dean cast spell on the ability of the women to tell the truth, if only to themselves. Starting with the leader of the club, Mona (played with great aplomb and feeling by Sandy Dennis) who was so hooked on the Dean legend that she created a separate universe for herself claiming that the illegitimate child, Jimmy Dean, that she conceived was Deans child, moving on to Sissy (played by Cher with that world-weary and wariness that she has brought to many roles) who has lied to herself that her husband was coming back after he had rejected her after her breast cancer operation), and, finally, to the other central figure, Joanne (played by Karen Black with that slippery sexuality she brought to many roles) who as it turned out had been, back in the day, a guy, Joe, who it turned out had been transgender and had had  an operation to prove it. Oh yeah, and who back in the day had impregnated Mona and thus the other unseen Jimmy Dean of the title. Nice work, Robert Altman.

Of course some films are meant to further some storyline which others like this one are conceived to highlight the interplay between characters and in this film that is exactly what you get. Get the interplay between the characters (including the lesser characters which fill out the cast, tough and cynical Stella Mae, fertile Edna Mae, and the older woman, Juanita who managed the store) through flashbacks to events in 1955 interspersed with the 1975 actions all confined to that single store. Moreover the interplay between the characters at any given moment made you think the whole experiment could blow up any minute as the deep secrets keep slowly getting revealed to show, well, to show that these women were made of ordinary human clay, just wanted something to believe in, something greater than themselves and their ordinary human clay lives. Join the club sisters, join the club.",1419984000,2,4566,4.65179677819083
6675035,2,B00NP06CCW,"The image quality of this Blu-ray disk is simply atrocious.  The grain is heavy, the colors unrealistic and unstable.  If there was a restoration of this valuable film, the producers of this disk certainly did not use it.  If you are a N@tflix member, rent the movie, as I did, before buying it.

6675050,5,B00NP06CCW,"This film has been a favorite of mine ever since the VCR rental days of the 1980s and it's great to finally have a restored DVD copy to own.

Sadly, there are no commentaries as it would have been great to hear from Cher and Kathy Bates, but the movie still packs a wallop and being somewhat of a period piece, it hasn't really dated at all. That being said, it all takes place on a single set and is totally dialogue-driven, so if you're looking for fast-paced action or lots of plot twists, this probably isn't your cup of tea.

This film plays like a stage play set in a run-down Woolworth's store in 1975 (the Five and Dime of the title) during the 20th Anniversary Reunion of a now-defunct James Dean Fan Club. The mirror at the soda fountain is used as the window to all the flashbacks to 1955 in which we learn how the characters came to be where they are now. Sandy Dennis plays the twitchy, almost schizophrenic Mona, who was ""chosen"" by James Dean all those years ago when she was a movie extra, and has a mentally-challenged son fathered by the late star; Cher plays the sassy, sexy, foul-mouthed waitress Cissy, who hasn't given up on her dreams--even though she's pushing 40; Kathy Bates is the flashy, fast-talking successful one, and Marta Heflin the shy, dowdy and perpetually pregnant shrinking violet. The proprietress of the joint is played by the wonderful, scene-stealing Sudie Bond, whom I've loved ever since she was appearing in nearly every Norman Lear sitcom ever made in the '70s. Her no-nonsense, God-fearing Christian character is the most entertaining of the bunch. Into this mix comes the mysterious yet intriguingly familiar Karen Black as Joanne whose arrival stirs up long-forgotten painful memories for a few of the other characters.

While the fate of most of the characters is somewhat depressing, the movie ends up leaving the viewer more satisfied than sad at the end.",1417910400,9,1907,4.703592814371257

The set is remarkably used in such a way the viswer never feels it's limits.sandy Dennis as Mona is perfectly neurotic and engaging. Cher is a tonic as Sissy-brazen and vulnerable in her first major acting performance( I don't count her 60's efforts).

I am surprised and delighted that this study in an incredible ensemble acting piece is finally being made available, hopefully in it's full Super-16mm format as it was filmed. I'm sorry that Amazon or other places do not include the fact that Kathy Bates is also in the cast in one of her first film roles. You can sense the beginnings of a truly remarkable career in her scenes she does as she interacts with the other cast members. Each member of the cast gives a  stand-out performance! I regret that I did not get a chance to see this production on Broadway, but watching it put on film is a totally immersive experience.
  I first saw it in Washington, DC  in 1983 and was glad to be able to get a copy on a Laser Disc. It is truly a study in fine ensemble acting. EVERY cast member is totally immersed in their character, giving polished performances that were honed by many stage presentations. This film should be required viewing at schools of acting. It is a true study of the human condition and quirks of nature at the time it was produced, and should not be missed. I am looking forward to a better copy in my library!",1411776000,29,1311,4.274193548387097
6675064,1,B00NP06CCW,"Recall seeing this way BACK when.  Movie brings BACK memories of old oral surgery.  Perhaps it is unfortunate it was not even further BACK.  Why Blu-ray - it belongs to be put BACK on Beta.  Put it on the Back of your viewing list... WAY BACK!

Well... it truly has one missing SONNY, were he BACK instead of Cher.",1411689600,,314,4.254237288135593
6675065,5,B00NP06CCW,"I am so glad to see that this treasure of a 'film' is finally going to be released in bluray and dvd format! Every one of these actresses gives a stellar performance here! Cher is....well, just as you would expect her to be- someone that you know you would be able to sit down and have a normal chat with. Sandy Dennis shines in her role. Karen Black is excellant. I don't know if this is Kathy Bates first film role, but she is also outstanding here. This is a play that is filmed as a movie, but you can tell from the set(s) that it's 'different'. Everyone in this film has a secret. Everyone! The dialogue sparkles, the humor is funny and the drama may bring you to tears after all of the secrets are exposed! Cher  and Karen Black both have secrets that are gut-wrenching and heartbreaking. This film deserves to be seen by a wider audience so that one can appreciate what real acting is all about. Sure, it's 'dated' now, but so is Casablanca and Gone With The Wind, both excellant films. If you want to know what life was like for females in a small town in Texas back in the day, then this is a good film to start with.",1411689600,49,1126,4.212962962962963
