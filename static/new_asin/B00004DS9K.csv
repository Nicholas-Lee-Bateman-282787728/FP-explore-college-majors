7920560,5,B00004DS9K,"Dr. Michael White and the PBS crew did a great job of presenting the understanding of the apocalyptic - from its ancient heritage in Judeo-Christian Literature through western cultural history to our own present time.  Apocalypse, within a variety of understandings, is almost a cultural meme for us and this video provides significant insight into its multi-valent roots as sources of meaning-making across time and cultures.",1483833600,,426,5.454545454545454
7920561,3,B00004DS9K,This was a gift that I searched for for quite some time.  The picture was grainy.  I was disapointed with the quality.,1389916800,,118,4.318181818181818
7920562,5,B00004DS9K,"All points substantiated well, confirms what I have believed for over a decade: All ""prophesy"" from bible was meant for the time it was written, and is not wisely applied to the future (like the last 200 years) because the authors OBVIOUSLY were directing their attention at the circumstances of the times. All these modern writers predicting the end of the world don't have a leg to stand on after they read this. Sure you can argue against it, but from faith and NOT from historical fact.

Also confirms my belief more that the ancient Persian Zoroastrians laid the foundation for many Jewish ideas, which later influenced Christianity and Islam. This all historical fact of course, and not faith oriented.

If you hold tightly to the current ""end times"" theology prevelant in most evangelical fundementalism, you won't like this video. This report eliminates interpreting scriptures for modern times, both based upon the historical conclusions and the overwhelming repeated failures of interpreters trying to guess when the end will come. The END of the way things were DID arrive, back around the time our ancient prophesies were written. Don't take my word for it- watch the video.",1383523200,,1186,5.045918367346939
7920563,5,B00004DS9K,"A terrific, scholarly, incisive documentary with a clear focus: the obsession and need for an apocalyptic world view. I thought this one rose above the normal PBS or Frontline standard.",1214006400,2,185,5.2
