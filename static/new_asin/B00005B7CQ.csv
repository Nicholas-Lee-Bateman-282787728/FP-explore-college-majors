7937018,4,B00005B7CQ,"The final season begins, and nearly the entire cast shows up in this volume(except for Kodachi and Dr. Tofu, who didn't disappear like in the manga).  All of the episodes are original stories not based on the manga, but they're all still pretty funny, well except for the second episode.  The first one has Kuno becoming the substitute principal when his father takes some time off, and naturally, he opts to take Ranma out, and both Gosunkugi and Nabiki are working with him!  Can Ranma, Akane, and Ukyo get the two on their side and get rid of Kuno?  The second episode is a bit more serious, as Ranma competes in a martial arts festival, where if he fails, he'll never be able to become a true martial artist!  Although the humor doesn't show up until the end(no, I'm not spoiling it), I do think it's also a nice way of seeing exactly what makes Ranma tick.  The third episode, arguably the best, features the Jusenkyo guide heading to Nerima, as it seems he's found an extension of the Spring-Of-Drowned-Man!  Which means Ranma, Ryoga, Mousse, and Genma can be cured!  Of course, don't expect things to go as expected(or else the series would end!).  Nevertheless, this episode is pretty funny, my favorite scene being the part with Ryoga and the explosive Akane doll(you'll have to see that for yourself!).",1067904000,,1312,4.6943231441048034
7937019,5,B00005B7CQ,"This is so great! I was overwhelmed! After seeing only two of the tapes, this has already become one of my favorite animes (along with Nadesico and the Slayers)! This is good for Ranma Newbies and Seasoned Ranma Otaku!",1027123200,,218,4.615384615384615
7937020,5,B00005B7CQ,"I must say this is great!!! It is very funny. Though there is no action as in fighting, it is very interesting!  It's just so funny!  Ranma and Akane acting as if they were married?!?...
A must have, as most Ranma 1/2 products.",1014768000,,227,4.255813953488372
7937021,5,B00005B7CQ,"The Ukyo's Secret sauce episodes parts 1 & 2 were too funny! The part when Soun Tendo used his spookiness technique was cool! Ukyo drove him away with the stench of the terrible okonomiyaki sauce. Ranma really made the sauce, but Ukyo thought it was her fault.
  A Teenage ghost story was cool. Quite a twist at the end, but I won't ruin it for you. Kogane, the ghost, is really strange. Kuno doesn't know what he's getting himself into...",1014508800,2,439,4.475
7937022,3,B00005B7CQ,"Although these episodes are very funny--it's hard to find Ranma episodes that aren't--I'm not sure how they qualify as ""best of."" I can think of a number of episodes off the top of my head that I found more amusing than these, and most of these come from the show's low point of art quality. It's accessible for fans and non-fans, and it's a good price as compared to the usual VHS prices...but if you have a DVD player, you might be better off investing in the first season and/or OAV box set(s).",1014249600,2,497,4.354838709677419
7937023,5,B00005B7CQ,"Ranma is the best because it is so zany. It's watching and wondering how he's going to get himself out of those sticky situations that makes this series so great. Also the cliff hangers at the end of the continuing episodes draw you back. The first time I watched Ranma I was wierded out, but I had to watch on...",1009584000,,313,4.233333333333333
