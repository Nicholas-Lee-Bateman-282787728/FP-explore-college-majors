8690941,5,B00Q9KZG7C,"The largest words on the cover of this Blu-ray from Dresden are ""Letzte Lieder,"" Last Songs -- not ""Four Last Songs,"" as concertgoers and record collectors are accustomed to call a composition Richard Strauss never created. As the distinction of the words ""Letzte Lieder"" suggests, this June 2014 concert commemorating Strauss' 150th birthday offers an extra-ordinary performance of Strauss' final songs and of his most ambitious orchestral work, ""Eine Alpensinfonie,"" featuring soprano Anja Harteros, conductor Christian Thielemann, and the orchestra with which Strauss maintained his closest relationship.

Grand occasions don't always produce great recordings, especially with Blu-ray technology's added layers of complexity. But in this instance, the efforts of performers, audio engineers, camera crews, video editors, sound mixers -- even the astute Dresden audience -- all coalesce into a stunning home theater experience, the most outstanding concert I've seen in this medium.

After Strauss died in 1949, Ernst Roth assembled four songs the 84-year-old composer had written and orchestrated in 1948 as individual pieces -- ""Im Abendrot,"" ""Frhling,"" ""September,"" and ""Beim Schlafengehen"" -- and published them as ""Four Last Songs"" in 1950. Strauss didn't call them that, not knowing they would be his last songs. And in fact, they weren't, for unbeknown to Roth and the public, Strauss had written a final song, ""Malven,"" given privately to celebrated Moravian soprano Maria Jeritza, with piano accompaniment, and found hidden in her safe after her death in 1982. In what has become the traditional order in which the Four Last Songs are performed -- ""Frhling,"" ""September,"" ""Beim Schlafengehen,"" and ""Im Abendrot"" -- ""Frhling"" is left standing somewhat apart from the other three. Into this sequence, the brief ""Malven,"" which refers to ""delicate blossoms that are summer's companions,"" fits in nicely after ""Frhling"" to make a seamless transition from springtime to ""September,"" as it does in the discreet orchestration furnished for this concert by Wolfgang Rihm.

Since 1950, the ""Four Last Songs"" have received a host of worthy recordings -- Schwarzkopf, Janowitz, Jessye Norman, to name but a few. How does Harteros measure up? She is magnificent. Instead of blathering in superlatives, I'll simply say I have never before been so moved by these songs. If she doesn't melt your heart, you don't have one. With the Dresden musicians providing ideally balanced support, Harteros never slackens in a delivery both highly polished and deeply emotional. After the soft piccolo trills fade away in the dying light, the Dresden audience reacts in a way Americans haven't yet learned. Instead of leaping to their feet and obnoxiously yelling ""Bravo,"" members of this audience remain quiet and still, respecting others' right to savor their private experience. Applause begins only after Thielemann and Harteros relax their postures. And it is for Harteros that the Dresden audience, steeped in the nuances of Strauss performance, offers up its highest praise. Remaining seated, the audience as one begins stomping its feet when she takes her bows, bestowing upon her their stamp of approval, delivered in no small measure. Harteros deserves every bit of it.

By this point, including Rihm's 12-minute ""Ernster Gesang"" (Serious Song) for small orchestra that opens the concert, this C Major Blu-ray has already earned its keep, and the main course is yet to come.

Strauss is not generally given credit as a deep thinker, and ""Eine Alpensinfonie"" is often regarded as nothing more than an elaborate, if dazzling, exercise in cinematography. Thielemann demonstrates both these generalizations are false and does so by the simplest of means. Most recordings of the 22 interlocking segments that make up the one-movement Alpine Symphony, including Thielemann's own 2000 CD&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Richard-Strauss-Eine-Alpensinfonie-Rosenkavalier-Suite-Christian-Thielemann-Wiener-Philharmoniker/dp/B00005AAFA/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Richard Strauss: Eine Alpensinfonie / Rosenkavalier Suite - Christian Thielemann / Wiener Philharmoniker</a>&nbsp;with the Vienna Philharmonic, run about 50 minutes. Solti charges up and down the mountain in 44. Here, Thielemann imperceptibly backs off on the throttle, and his evenly proportioned 54-minute traversal promotes a more reflective reception of the underlying message Strauss is striving to deliver.

Strauss said of the Alpine Symphony that ""it represents: moral purification through one's own strength, liberation through work, worship of eternal, magnificent nature."" What's important is not Strauss' more or less inadequate expression -- verbal profundity was not his gift -- but the word ""represents."" That is, he clearly intended the Alpine Symphony to be more than just a musical accompaniment to a superficial, pictorial program. Through pacing and attention to detail, Thielemann helps us grasp its more substantial philosophical and psychological layers of meaning, much more so than in the concert on Blu-ray from Salzburg in 2011&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Renee-Fleming-Live-in-Concert-Blu-ray/dp/B007PQ511U/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Renee Fleming Live in Concert [Blu-ray</a>] in which Thielemann conducts the Vienna Philharmonic.

Our everyday speech tends to separate the ""religious"" from the ""profane,"" and a different, holistic concept of spirituality is difficult to elucidate. In his studies during the 1960s and '70s, American psychologist/philosopher Abraham Maslow struggled to find the vocabulary to describe what he termed ""peak-experiences"" -- those rare moments of euphoria that consist of an elevated form of perceiving reality, of being totally ourselves and simultaneously of being one with both the entire physical and spiritual universe we inhabit, of an awareness that, in Maslow's words, ""the sacred is in the ordinary ... everything is miraculous."" Such a view of the world is what Strauss actualizes in the Alpine Symphony and which Thielemann and the orchestra that's so well in tune with him present.

Sketches for the Alpine Symphony go back to 1899, but Strauss took up the work in earnest after the May 1911 death of Gustav Mahler, intending in part to write a tribute to his fellow composer. Strauss was at the height of his powers, having achieved international success with the January premiere that year in Dresden of ""Der Rosenkavalier."" He continued working on the symphony for some four years, during which time he was also creating ""Ariadne auf Naxos"" and ""Die Frau ohne Schatten."" (In 1912, coincidentally, German novelist Thomas Mann began writing The Magic Mountain, published in 1924, which has many features in common with the Alpine Symphony.) Strauss dedicated ""Eine Alpensinfonie"" to the Dresden orchestra and conducted that group in the work's premiere on Oct. 28, 1915.

The Alpine Symphony begins in the darkest, pre-dawn hours and begins by quoting the five-note descending line from the opening of Schoenberg's 1899 string sextet ""Verklrte Nacht,"" although Strauss extends the bassoons' descent for three full octaves. Even a cursory glance at the score's first page reveals the complexity with which the piece is assembled. First violins, second violins, violas, cellos, and even basses are each divided into two separate lines, creating a dense polyphonic texture. Out of this chaos of darkness and unconsciousness emerges a blazing and radiant sunrise, both more natural and more spectacular than the hackneyed opening of ""Also sprach Zarathustra."" The sunrise theme (at 46:31 on this Blu-ray) is of paramount importance and recurs at the symphony's key moments.

All the incidents prior to reaching the summit are executed marvelously, including the well-positioned offstage brass, and the excellent camera work helps make us aware of how sparingly Strauss employs the gargantuan forces he calls for. In its focus on soloists and sections, the piece could be described as a concerto for orchestra. Seldom is the full panoply engaged, and in only two of the 22 sections does Strauss call for the volume to rise to triple-forte. One of those occasions is not -- as we might expect of movie music -- the arrival on the summit at the start of segment 11, and the brief moment of exultation by the trombones is cut short by an unexpected oboe solo, played with affecting finesse by Cline Moinet, looking down from a great height on the petty cares and squabbles of the ""civilized"" world. Maslow explains this aspect of peak-experiences by saying, ""The perceiver can more readily look upon nature as if it were there in itself and for itself, not simply as if it were a human playground put there for human purposes."" The full orchestra then returns, with the horns leading a full-blown exposition of the sunrise theme, basking in transfigured daylight instead of night.

The summit, however, is not the Alpine Symphony's center or its climax. The midpoint comes at the beginning of the following segment, ""Vision"" (1:10:14). ""Vision"" refuses to fit with a cinema music concept of the symphony, taking us into the part of peak-experience Maslow describes as a ""characteristic disorientation in time and space, or even the lack of consciousness of time and space,"" like ""experiencing universality and eternity."" As the music regroups and finds its way forward, the organ makes its initial, weighty entry (1:13:20); and for the first time, the full orchestra is called upon to play triple-forte, underlining this section's centrality in Strauss' overarching conception.

We humans cannot remain at peak altitude, unfortunately. The descent begins as mists rise, the skies darken, and nature unleashes its full fury in a devastating storm that sustains a triple-forte volume level and involves every instrument you can think of -- and then some -- reminding us we are at the mercy of an external universe that takes no notice of our existence. Throughout this performance, Thielemann's economy of movement in communicating with his musicians is as phenomenal as the music itself and of their execution of it.

The storm dissipates. As we find ourselves back on the flatlands from whence we started, a glorious sunset engulfs us (1:25:08), and the camera catches Thielemann in an unusually demonstrative gesture, clasping his fists together as though he's swinging a hammer to bring in the violins in a fortissimo quotation, in a different key, of the ""bridge of fire"" passage from the finale of Mahler's Ninth Symphony. Here is the tribute Strauss gives to his departed colleague. Even so, we have still not reached the crux of the Alpine Symphony. An organ chorale opens the penultimate segment, ""Ausklang"" (1:28:13), a German word for which there is no English equivalent. We might call it an ending, a summing up, a conclusive settling down. The organ chords, from the first four notes of the sunrise theme, evoke the atmosphere of a church and are seemingly out of place in the musical credo of the non-theistic Strauss. Maslow ran into the same problem trying to explain the spiritual nature of peak-experiences, saying that in such matters, we often have no acceptable lexicon to fall back on other than the religious.

After the organ chords are repeated, the climax of the entire Alpine Symphony arrives, as the solo horn -- Dresden principal Robert Langbein -- recapitulates the sunrise theme heard on the summit. This exposed mezzo-forte entrance on the F at the top of the staff is so difficult to pull off at this stage of the performance, but Langbein shows no strain in producing the ideal, clear tone that here combines the sacred and secular into a holistic unity, absorbing the peak-experience as a permanent feature of the personality to be carried forward henceforth. Without this process of internalization, the peak-experience is meaningless, forgotten. The ""Ausklang"" reaches its culmination as the whole orchestra takes up the sunrise theme, before the closing section, ""Nacht,"" recalls the music from the symphony's very opening, as the restfulness of sleep returns.

The Dresden audience remains still, too polite to break the spell. Sweat pours from the ordinarily cool Thielemann's brow, and applause doesn't begin until he releases his pose. In an uncharacteristic display of emotion, he embraces concertmaster Matthias Wollong, gestures for the entire orchestra to stand, and then turns to receive the audience's accolades. At his curtain call, his face glows as the well-informed Dresden audience expresses its unreserved appreciation. The second time Thielemann returns, he motions for horn soloist Langbein to stand -- and that's when the foot-stomping starts. Soon, all who have participated in this wonderful event are recognized.

Thielemann's guidance makes it clear that Strauss' Alpine Symphony is not some kind of travel-film soundtrack, but music of a worshipful attitude toward living in the actuality of the natural world. We are left, to quote Maslow, with ""a sense of the sacred glimpsed in and through the particular instance of the momentary, the secular, the worldly."" In realizing Strauss' peak-experience, Thielemann and the Staatskapelle Dresden have provided those of us who couldn't attend this concert with our own peak-experience. It's a treasure.",1457827200,10,13409,5.511424404472533
8690942,4,B00Q9KZG7C,"The first piece, ""a song for orchestra"" by Rihm, will probably never get played again (by me anyway), but the 5 Last Songs by R. Strauss are wonderful and include a 5th and last thing he wrote (nicely orchestrated by the same Mr. Rihm).  The over-the-top performance of Strauss's tone poem masterpiece, An Alpine Symphony, is worth the DVD alone. Travel to the alps without the TSA!  It will fill your head with gorgeousness for days afterward.  Not to be missed.",1431993600,2,463,4.691358024691358
8690943,3,B00Q9KZG7C,"I do not wish to be critical toward one the of the most respected, renown, orchestras on this planet BUT something went wrong in this recording.  They were at times, very uneven and disjointed.  Other times they did not follow the maestro in the beginning of the compositions. This continued with the last four songs but to a lesser degree.  Very sad to state this soprano lacked the vocal strength in voice to interpret the last four songs.  She slid here and there, trying to excuse her lack of vocal prowess and interpretation.  Her voice was at times timid and lacking the strength these gems require. Other times too much vibrato, other times expressing a not knowing (uncertainty) of what to vocally do. But then again, Strauss wrote these songs as a declaration of ones life, a passage that is pensive and insightful even to its very demise.  They require a voice that can express those elements. A voice that can penetrate and pierce the heart these compositions possess. (Ah Strauss!  Want to hear truly a soulful, heartfelt expression (interpretation) of the last four songs? Get the DVD of Jesse Norman's or the cd recording interpreted by her of the LFS. There you will hear and feel what these gems are all about. Your inner self will spiritually resonate with her interpretations of the last four songs.",1428883200,2,1317,4.775330396475771
