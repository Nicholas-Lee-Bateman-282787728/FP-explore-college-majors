If you'd like to be broken out of the Matrix and see how far down the rabbit hole goes, buy this film and watch it three times at least? I am going to show this one to my friends to freak them out.

And another thing,
To see my favorite movie, ""The Shining,"" taken apart and exposed as a series of secret messages from the director to the viewing audience was nothing less than brilliant, not to mention genius.
Multiple viewings are required to get all the info in this powerhouse of a documentary, it's super rich with great theories, visual evidence, and aha moments.
Every kubrick fan should own this film. I want the other two films to come out, NOW!?

The final word.....Awesome!",1302912000,43,773,4.507142857142857
4444256,5,B004PF0FJM,"First off, let's set the record straight, at no time does Jay Weidner say we did not go to the Moon. What Weidner states is that much of what we saw was faked. What he does nicely is show how this was done technically and does so convincingly. He then demonstrates how this explains much of what Richard Hoagland and Mike Bara have detected in NASA footage and photos from the Moon.

The second half of the video is brilliant. This is where the author goes through The Shining on a level that is nothing less than mind-blowing and is alone worth the price of the DVD.

For those who think Weidner is reaching or grasping at straws, I recommend taking one course on films, either on-line or at a community college. I learned from a course on Westerns that there's more in the most basic John Ford Western than I imagined possible. In addition, Kubrick was the 'man of a thousand takes' supposedly using as many as 148 takes on a single scene. If it's in a Kubrick film, it's there intentionally.",1302566400,45,994,4.426229508196721
4444257,5,B004PF0FJM,"The idea that Stanley Kubrick faked the Apollo moon landings is not new (probably because it's true) and (also probably because it's true) CBC even went so far as to create a ""mockumentary"" about it called ""Dark Side of the Moon"" to try and ridicule any attempt to prove this idea.  Jay Weidner, however takes a completely different approach and instead of twisting the words of interview footage to portray deceptive conclusions as CBC warns against, Jay finds clues in Stanley Kubrick's own films as to what Stanley was going through at the time, many of them remarkable.  He also finds telltale signs in the techniques used in the Apollo moon landing footage such as ""front screen projection"".  There is obviously something fishy going on with NASA and this film adds some common-sense credibility to trying to solve the mystery.  Also very entertaining.  I hope he succeeds with this film in exposing the illusion that we were all led to believe.",1302134400,12,950,4.875776397515528
4444258,5,B004PF0FJM,"Stanley Kubrick is one of  my favorite filmmakers. I was so taken with  2001 A Space Odyssey, that I went to see it  7 times when it first played in the theater. Over the years I have followed Jay Weidner's  articles concerning  the symbolic imagery and messages Kubrick placed in his body of work. So I was delighted to see that this DVD had been released. Hearing Mr. Weidner  speak about the work on various radio shows peaked my interest even more. But seeing Kubrick's Odyssey  really brought me to a new level of understanding  of Kubrick's work.

Like a good detective, Mr. Weidner step by step presents his evidence that Mr. Kubrick was hired to fake the moon landings. It is interesting to note that he says that we actually went to the moon but what the public was shown was not the real deal. Then he moves on to demonstrate the techniques used in the fake coverage such as front screen projection, a technique used in 2001 A Space Odyssey. Finally, he describes and demonstrates how Kubrick revealed this secret mission  in his film, The Shining. For many this story may seem way out but it certainly presents another perspective on Stanley Kubrick's work. Kubrick's Odyssey also awakened me to the possibility that so much of what we are told by the mainstream media has a very specific agenda behind it.",1302134400,14,1317,4.613733905579399

I was especially taken by the expose of ""The Shining"" and how the story all started coming together.  Having been a fan of Kubrick for many years, I always thought that there was more going on in his movies and this movie proves it.

I highly recommend this film to anyone who is a serious Kubrick fan- or, for that matter, anyone who watched the Apollo moon landings and bought into it at the time.  Very eye opening stuff!",1302134400,10,566,4.403846153846154

4444267,1,B004PF0FJM,"This is the first DVD in a series by which the author will reveal to us how the world is being secretly governed by some secret occult society, the Rosicrucians, the Masons, or some such pyramid society, I don't know, he doesn't say, he wants to you buy the next disc to find out. There is no science in this documentary and the stuff you've heard by word of mouth about the faked footage is far more intelligent and interesting that this conspiracy theory sickness.

There is a mentally ill person who is blowing up photographs of the moon's surface and using the film grain to show how the moon is actually covered by a vast network of glass ruins from some ancient civilisation which NASA is hiding from us, and the DVD goes downhill from there.

Also included is a poor interpretation of The Shining as Kubrick's admission to making the fake footage. It centres around the 'All' in 'All work and no play...' being code for A11, Apollo 11, and the scene where the child is playing on the hexagonally patterned carpet which is supposedly patterned after the launch pad patterns. It builds from these points and it is just sad to watch.

Perhaps there was faked moon-landing footage, but you won't find out about it from this disc.",1377129600,7,1232,4.5656108597285066
4444268,1,B004PF0FJM,"The basic gist of ""Kubrick's Odyssey"" by Jay Weidner is that ""2001: A Space Odyssey"" was a primer for Kubrick to fake the moon landing footage (even though according to Mr. Weidner, we DID go to the moon), and ""The Shining"" was a confession by Kubrick about the process of faking that footage. Mr. Weidner is very reminiscent of Fred Leuchter, who was featured in Errol Morris' documentary ""<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Mr-Death-The-Rise-Fall-of-Fred-A-Leuchter-Jr/dp/B00009MEBK/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Mr. Death: The Rise & Fall of Fred A. Leuchter Jr.</a>."" Fred Leuchter was an execution technician who incorrectly deduced that Jews were not gassed at the concentration camp at Auschwitz.

The main problem, and what the extremely fragile existence of Mr. Weidner's theory rests on is the difference between the way one decodes works of art and the way one uncovers facts about the real world.
When interpreting a work of art, a legitimate interpretation can just focus on just the artwork itself, within a vacuum (though context is often important). However, you cannot determine historical events based on fictional works, as Mr. Weidner does in this documentary. Just because ""2001"" has very impressive special effects for its time, and there is Apollo/American imagery in ""The Shining,"" it does not follow that Kubrick staged the moon landing (that is the argument in its essence).

Tellingly, Mr. Weidner appoints himself as the sole decider as to what evidence is relevant, and how to interpret it. The documentary features no experts outside of himself to provide any collaborating testimony for his theory. The reason for this is obvious. He's built a house of cards on practically no reality, and any legitimate reasoning person from the outside world would easily knock it over. It also goes to show that in truth he doesn't really believe in his theory, because he does not subject it on camera to any other voices that might mediate or contradict it.

Some examples:
*When he distorts photos taken on the moon (by boosting their brightness and chroma levels), he points out patterns that he believes prove that rear screen projection was being used. Because he never asks any experts, it's never even brought up whether distorting photographs in computer software is a legitimate way of getting information - perhaps the distortion adds artifacts to the images. He also never explains where he got the images from - perhaps the machine that processed the negative, or scanned the image digitally introduced the patterns he sees? These basic questions are never considered, he quickly jumps to the extreme conclusion.

*He offers additional ""proof"" that the moon landing was staged as when he speeds up the footage, he finds that the astronauts are walking at a normal speed....

*He argues that there is an obvious break along the horizon on the photos that were taken on the moon set, that half of the shot was on a stage, and the other half was the rear screen image. He argues that the two portions landscapes don't ""match"", which is an obvious sign that they were faked. Tellingly, the well-established notion of Kubrick as a perfectionist who would have noticed and corrected such obvious ""errors"" is never addressed. Nor is any geologist brought to the documentary who would have validated his idea, as there are none who would.

The final note I'll add, is that in an atrocious manner, without any note of shame, Mr. Weidner also declares that Stanley Kubrick's widow is an accomplice in the cover-up.

Unfortunately for Mr. Weidner, I get the impression that he is the type of person who considers any denial of his theories a confirmation. I don't think there are any facts that he would be interested in hearing, he finds the game he is playing with himself far too enjoyable.",1374278400,18,3845,5.12280701754386
4444269,1,B004PF0FJM,"Now, I'm not trying to be mean about this with the title of my review, but it was the honest thought that came to mind when listening to the filmmaker's slow suggestions about certain scenes of the Shining. I love anything and everything Kubrick and have jumped on my first chance to see documentaries about him since he was such a secretive and complex artist. I really enjoyed Kubrick's use of film to tell stories within stories. But I highly regret putting out money for this badly edited/choppy film. So many of the theories are based on amateur examinations by people who clearly aren't experts at photography and such. Ideas and information herein are inconclusive at best.

They WERE on the moon and that footage was the REAL footage.

I was also not impressed by these intermediate horizon lines that Weidner seems to see all over the moon pictures which he outlines in Photoshop as proof that Kuberick was involved. Almost ALL photos have some kind of composition line like that in them so that's no surprise but he even seems to see these lines where they don't even exist.

In closing, I see no reason why the US government would have even bothered to fake anything. The Russians had spies all over the U.S. and Canada (AVRO). They copied  all sorts of technology from here so getting a few pictures of some already landed craft on the moon? Who cares.",1343520000,8,1017,4.231958762886598
4444274,5,B004PF0FJM,"This production is the first of a 3 part series by Jay Weidner, and may I say, the bar has been set high.

First of all I want to reiterate what so many others have said, that Stanley Kubrick was a genius, top of the line intellectual and also a master chess player amongst other things. When the American government saw the feat he achieved in recreating the B-52 bomber in Dr Strangelove they knew this was the man they needed to fake the apollo moon landings.

In the first part of the film Weidner shows the tell tale signs of Front Screen Projection (a filming method) which Kubrick perfected in 2001 and ultimately used in the filming of the moon landings.

The second part of the film is an absolute knockout. Weidner uncovers the hidden meaning of The Shinning, which was made as a secret confession by Kubrick. A confession that when deciphered, leaves me in no doubt that Kubrick was involved in faking the moon landings.

For any Kubrick fan out there that wants to understand the true meaning behind the mans films, this production is a must see.",1340928000,3,1058,4.523560209424084

synchronous effect comes to mind. But that does not mean Pink Floyd
set their album to the Wizard of Oz. It's called a coincidence.
Kubrick made 2001 during a zeitgeist of space exploration enthusiasm.

4444277,5,B004PF0FJM,"As usual, the debunkers come out in force. Notice their tried and true tactics of ridicule, scorn and innuendo. Check out the Amazon reviews for any book or DVD questioning the Kennedy assassination or the 9/11 false flag operation and you will find almost identical types of negative comments that are now being marshalled against Weidner's fine documentary on Kubrick. Astute observers will notice that they are very short on factual rebuttal and long on sarcasm and repeat the usual lame arguments claiming how ""conspiracy theories"" aren't true, are stupid, etc.

If you still believe that Oswald killed Kennedy alone (or at all for that matter) I suggest you take a look at Connally looking over his right shoulder in the Zapruder film AFTER Kennedy reaches up to grab his throat in response to being hit with a bullet. Problem is that both men had to have been hit at the same instant for the single bullet/lone assassin story to be true. Connally himself said that he was not hit until several seconds later when he turned to face forward. Or perhaps you still believe the official story of 9/11. If so go to YouTube and check out videos of building 7 collapsing straight down into it's own footprint at freefall speed for 8 floors and the BBC reporting it's collapse 'due to damage from falling debris"" over twenty minutes before it actually came down demolition style. It was all scripted and someone screwed up the timing of some of the cover stories being fed into the mainstream news media matrix.

The fact is that Weidner makes a compelling argument for Kubrick's involvement, or at least knowledge of the faking of the Apollo 11 moon landing. In The Shining, why did Kubrick put an Apollo 11 design on Danny's sweater in the scene before he is attacked by the ghostly woman in room 237? Of all details Kubrick could have chose, why did he decide on that one? And why did he stipulate in his contract with Warner Brothers that his final film Eyes Wide Shut be released on the exact date of the 30th anniversary of the Apollo 11 moon launch? In that film, which contains an extended sequence showing a weird sex magic ritual, Kubrick shows two masked figures, one wearing a triagular mask with an eye near the top (Eye of Horus in Freemasonry) and another wearing, you guessed it - a crescent shaped moon face mask. The debunkers will have you believe that these details, along with the unexpected death of Kubrick days after his final cut was turned over to Warner Brothers, are mere trivialities, which I personally find hard to reconcile with common sense.

I assumed it was going to be a thoughtful video essay on general hidden symbolism etc. in Kubrick's films. What I got instead are the ravings of a typical conspiracy theorist whackjob.

The basic jist posited on this DVD is that the US govt. was so impressed by Kubrick's technical savvy displayed in Dr. Strangelove that they hired him to direct all of the moon-landing footage that the world has ever seen, all fake. And that The Shining is actually a coded message from Kubrick, trying to tell this to the world. It is magnanimously conceded that the US did actually go to the moon. It's just that no *real* footage has ever been shown to the public. Only Kubrick's fake footage.

I literally laughed out loud when he started showing photos of the surface of the moon and superimposing lines on them which were meant to designate where the physical part of the studio set ends and the rear-projected ""fake backdrop"" begins. All he was actually doing was delineating the foreground and the background, something that naturally occurs in virtually all landscape photography. Not to mention that in several cases his drawn line didn't seem to coincide with anything shown in the photo.

4444279,1,B004PF0FJM,"This is one of the most foolishly constructed videos I have ever seen. The creator of this bizarre, nonsensical ""documentary"" has taken a paranoid and easily dismissed notion (the Apollo moon landings were faked, yet again) and has concocted a wildly unsupportable theory that Stanley Kubrick - the ultimate anti- establishment director - was somehow blackmailed into a conspiracy with NASA and the U.S. government. Mind you, Kubrick was already a British subject by this point.

Even overlooking the fact that only the most ignorant or paranoid fanatics believe at this point that we didn't make it to the moon, almost everything Weidner brings up in his video is either an extreme stretch, or the same kind of manipulation he claims NASA and Kubrick pulled. For example, he claims there are lines in the NASA photos separating the foreground from a rear screen projection, just as there are in 2001. On close examination, the lines in the photos are simply natural berms on the landscape (watch and notice how the 2001 lines reach across the screen while HIS moon lines don't . . . just as in real life berms don't).

This is just one example of the kind of refutable and fact-bending evidence Weidner promotes throughout this silly video, and the further he gets, the more unbelievable his theories become. The section on The Shining is especially outlandish, and only serves to prove that symbolism can be twisted any way by anyone to support even the silliest premises. (The eagle statue sitting with other similar nicknacks symbolizes the power of the U.S. and happens to be the name of the first lunar lander? Indeed? Room No. can be made into ""Moon Room?"" This is supporting evidence?? The rug resembles a launch pad? Seriously? The tennis ball represents the U.S. government asking Kubrick ""to play?"" Please tell me you're kidding.)

I've been subjected to some pretty wild claims by some strange sources, but I have rarely sat through something so obviously contrived as this video. What's sad is that Weidner seems to think he's being brilliant by stringing this empty material together, and that several others seem to believe Weidner has validity.

You only have to look in the Stanley Kubrick Archive, London, to see where he was and what he was doing, on an almost daily basis. In other words, the SK Archive proves this film to be a total fake.

4444282,2,B004PF0FJM,"The ONLY thing this video shows is how gullible and easily manipulated people are. The video talks about a line that seperates the sound stage (where he claims the video was shot) from a screen of glass beads used for front screen projection to create the backgrounds. And when he's talking about it you can kind of make out the lines. Although sometimes I would see different lines than the ones he indicated. So I went to Google images and pulled up some large photos of the deserts on Earth. Guess what - they all looked like that too. So I guess all those pictures must have been faked the same way. Gee and those desert photos looked so real! I wonder what deep insideous motive those photographers had to go to all the trouble and expense of faking them on a sound stage instead of just taking real shots of the desert.

The narrative moves on to talk about how the men who walked on the moon seemed to be moving much slower than men normally move. As if normal motions had been photographed then slowed down to make them look different. He kept insisting that men under lesser gravity would move quicker than normal because there'd be no gravity to slow them down. I guess that's why NASA didn't pick this genius for the space program. Apparently he's too stupid to slow down and move carefully. So he'd probably end up floating off into outer space if he had to go outside the capsule and repair something.

That's as far as I got in the program because its just too dumb to keep watching. But seeing how many people couldn't think their way past this horse manure I can now understand how the GOP stays in business. People are stupid!",1323129600,11,1643,4.437086092715232

4444284,5,B004PF0FJM,"Kubrick's Odyssey is a film with an intriguing thesis, and an unique way of laying out the provided ""clues"" to the theories. Half of the film is a technical analysis, with the other half being the connective narrative of the filmmaker. While the film doesn't provide absolute proof in many regards, there is more than enough evidence to spark the curiosity of most. Those that seem to dismiss the thesis of Kubrick's work seem quick to dismiss what appears to be rather ingeniously subtle clues.

 The film starts off by debunking several bits of Apollo 11 footage with the stage tricks of the era that were specifically incorporated into Kubrick's film 2001. The filmmaker lays this out along his theory of details such as how Kubrick was hired by NASA in a way that is needed for his interpretations of Kubrick's personal story (but that is not proven and stated as a matter of fact rather than conjecture). Many additional details are indeed addressed within his thesis with evidence, but some are simply not.

 The second part of the film is a pretty interesting read of Kubrick's film with the theory laid out in the first half. The second half of the film is almost entirely cuts from Kubrick, along with the narration of the filmmaker. Many of the filmmaker's interpretations seem like dead-ringers, some as possibilities, and very few as not very plausible. Once the pace gets rolling it really draws your interest, but unfortunately the film comes to an abrupt end after just 65 minutes.

 The filmmaker has made the incredibly poor choice of attempting to milk his audience by breaking what should be a single film into at least three.

4444285,2,B004PF0FJM,"Slow meandering presentation of one guy's wild theory presented as indisputable fact. The filmmaker doesn't even pretend he has sources or proof for his idea that Kubrick faked the moon landing but he narrates it all authoritatively as though it was proven beyond doubt. What ""proof"" he ends up offering is his ridiculously convoluted attempt to turn ""The Shining"" into a veiled confession of Kubrick's sins. There is basically not a single shred of evidence to support his claim.

I never even felt the filmmaker believed the things he was saying. In fact I wondered if he was even human because it often sounded like a computer voice-simulator was narrating. Perhaps this film was assembled by some CIA artifical intelligence (OMG HAL??!) as disinformation to dupe the public from the real purpose behind the moon landings, namely to investigate all the alien artifacts lying around up there. Maybe a wacky theory but not much more wacky than what this guy is saying.

He even goes out of his way trying to discredit Richard Hoagland, claiming Hoagland misinterpreted the anomalies he found in NASA photos as alien debris when it was actually evidence it was shot on a soundstage. The filmmaker makes the mistaken (or mendacious?) claim that Hoagland found these anomalies after putting the original photos through an imaging process. This is false. Hoagland clearly stated the photos he was working with in that case were ORIGINAL NASA photos saved from destruction by a conscientious NASA member who had been told to destroy them. Hoagland's claim is that the background images in the ORIGINAL NASA photos were later blacked out before they were shown to the public. So Hoagland's claim is actually the OPPOSITE of what this filmmaker states. (See Hoagland's book&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Dark-Mission-The-Secret-History-of-NASA-Enlarged-and-Revised-Edition/dp/1932595481/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Dark Mission: The Secret History of NASA, Enlarged and Revised Edition</a>- well worth a read!) Either the filmmaker has not done his research on Hoagland or he specifically wants to discredit him. Amusingly, Hoagland has often made the claim that the whole ""moon landing was a hoax"" story is government disinformation deliberately designed to obscure the issue of what NASA is really up to, up there!!",1315440000,14,2355,5.538888888888889

4444287,2,B004PF0FJM,"The song that begins this DVD - ""Under the Masonic Moon"" - written by Greg Mucin and performed by the Elders of Zion is a very catchy melody with controversial lyrics and is performed beautifully.  Top-shelf song!

But the premise of this ""documentary"" is so bizarre that I don't know if Jay Weidner is presenting his findings with his tongue-in-his-cheek or if he actually believes everything he talks about during the 70 minutes of this DVD.

It is one thing to make conjectures.  It is quite another to blatantly state something as a fact with absolutely NO corraborative evidence whatsoever.  How does Weidner know that the Pentagon and NASA contacted Kubrick after seeing the film ""Dr. Strangelove"" (which was released in 1964) and that they offered a deal to the director - ""a deal with the devil"" in Weidner's words - to direct faked footage of the future moon landings?  As ""jennifer sacramento"" says quite well in her own review - where is one single person-in-the-know to help us believe  this ludicrous theory of Weidner's?  In essence, Weidner is saying that Kubrick worked in secret with NASA and the Pentagon to fake the moon landing films and that we should just swallow his conspiracy theory as fact - with nothing other than his word to back it  up!  Who is Jay Weidner anyway?  Where is the Deep Throat to help confirm any of his speculations? Because that is ALL they are.

And how did NASA know - in 1964 - that they would need Kubrick's services for the phony footage of a moon landing that would not happen for another five years?  And the special effects work in ""Strangelove"" is not all that impressive at all.  There were sci-fi films in the '50's that had better special effects than the flying bomber in the ""Strangelove"" film. Heck, in the early '50s ""Abbott and Costello Go to Mars"" the rocket flight special effects are much more ""realistic"" that the ""Strangelove"" sequences.  And if Kubrick struck his deal with the Devil in exchange for total control over his future films, why are there no hidden clues in ""2001"" - his sci-fi masterpiece of 1968?  Why are there no clues revealing Kubrick's torment in living with his secret in ""A Clockwork Orange"" or ""Barry Lyndon""?  Why did it take over a decade before he started to crack and put secret clues into ""The Shining""?

Since Kubrick dealt with NASA directly in his pre-production of ""2001"" it would be more believable that it was at that time that NASA may have approached the director - or one or more of his many special effects team members  - with the offer to film phony footage so that the Russians would not be privy to our actual hardware.  (Yet...why would we care if they saw what we had achieved and how we had achieved it, once the mission had been accomplished and the Eagle had landed?)  The special effects for ""2001"" dealt directly with the moon and space (whereas ""Strangelove"" did not) and were much, much more sophisticated than ANYTHING seen in films dealing with spacecraft and the moon up until that time.

Weidner goes on with the b.s. by saying that if Kubrick did NOT take the offer made by the Powers-that-Were back then, ""they just might get rid of him.""  In other words - kill him! Again, there is not one scintilla of evidence that such a ridiculous offer was ever made.  None at all:  only Weidner's word.  He goes on and on about how Kubrick and NASA ""negotiated the deal"" twixt them - yet we are given NO whistle-blower testimony, not even a scrap of paper to aid in our acceptance of the ""deal with the Devil"" Kubrick made according to Weidner - and ONLY according to Weidner.

When, exactly, was Kubrick supposed to have worked on the faked footage?  Weidner hints that it was 1964.  That is when Kubrick was supposedly working on how to make the bogus footage authentic and realistic.  But if he did his dirty work for NASA before or during the making of ""2001"" then it is impossible for him to have aided NASA in their hoax.  Why?  Because ""2001"" was not released until 1968.  We landed on the moon in 1969.  Kubrick's recreation of the surface of the moon in ""2001"" was primarily based on scientific guesswork - and, as it turned out, the moon surface as it appears in ""2001"" in no way looks anything at all like the moon surface in the NASA footage.  This, in itself, sinks the Titanic of Weidner's theory.

If Weidner had left Kubrick out of the equation completely - and he should have since there is not the tiniest bit of evidence of Kubrick's involvment in any NASA trickery allegedly used to hide our technology from the Russians - but if he had left the director out...the segment of this DVD dealing with Front Screen Projection does raise concerns over the stills and footage provided to us by NASA.  If, indeed, front screen projection can be authenticated in the NASA footage and photos, then the NASA imagery is fake.  Richard Hoagland - a huge proponant of the Face on Mars controvery - believes the backdrop anomalies reveal glass structures on the moon.  (There are segments on this DVD from Hoagland's lectures wherein he adjusts the contrast in the NASA data to reveal the alleged glass structures.  Weidner disagrees with Hoagland's assessment and believes, instead, that the background anomalies reveal use of Front Screen Projection.  This is, in fact, much easier to believe than the notion of mile high glass structures on the meteor bombed moon. Glass? Despite Hoagland's moon theories, his Mars conjectures are much more convincing.  I lean towards agreeing with Hoagland that the strange structures on Mars are, indeed, possible evidence of artificial construction.)

So...back to this DVD's analysis of NASA footage using front screen projection - it is very thought-provoking.  I would love to hear a counter argument that explains WHY Weidner's analysis on the background scenes shot on the moon are wrong, if indeed they are wrong.  This issue of the usage of front screen projection is the most ""convincing"" portion of the entire DVD.

The second part of this DVD deals with ""The Shining.""
Weidner feels it is packed with clues by which Stanley Kubrick was attempting to reveal his covert operations with NASA.  While he presents many interesting findings in ""The Shining"" he also serves up much absurdity as well.  A few of the absurd insights should suffice:  Jack Nicholson's character is representitive of Kubrick himself. This is partly based on the fact that both Kubrick and Nicholson had black hair and smoked the same cigarettes.  The snow scenes - as well as the young psychic son's toy teddy bears - hint at the Cold War we had with Russia during the time of the space race.  It doesn't matter to Weidner that the snow scenes are firstly in Stephen King's novel.  Did King include them to represent the Cold War?  Hardly. The storyline's built around the fact that the Nicholson character's job is to see to the maintenace of the Overlook Hotel during the winter months when the place closes! This originates in King's book - and not in Kubrick.  Barry Nelson's character - the man in charge before the place is closed up for the winter - is, according to Weidner,representative of JFK who vowed to see a man on the moon before the '60s were over.  And why is Barry Nelson a symbol of JFK?  Because his hairstyle and look resemble Kennedy a little - and there is a flag on his desk.  The former caretaker's twin girls - hacked to death with an axe - supposedly are a hidden reference to the Gemini space program.  Scatman Cruther's character's death at the hands of Nicholson's character means that someone who blew the whistle - or who might blow the whistle - on NASA and Kubrick's dirty little secret would be offed. In the film's closing photo of Nicholson's character at an Overlook party from the past, Weidner says there is a secret message in the photo as well.  In Nicholson's right hand is a piece of paper - and what do you suppose is on that piece of paper?  According to Weidner....we have all just found out (in watching his film.)  But the piece of paper in Nicholson's hand is so small as to be practically anything.  It could be a cigarette lighter or a bandage or a napkin.  It actually isn't Nicholson's hand either - as only his head was matted into an existent photo from the actual past. It goes on and on - and Weidner also lets scene sequences from the actual film go on and on, even when the scene is no longer needed to bolster Weidner's wild speculations.  These scenes just amount to padding.

I truly believe in conspiracies.  I think JFK's death was the result of a conspiracy.  In our current day, we have all heard a dozen different ways in which Bin Laden went down and we still don't know the true story.  When the space-shuttle Challenger blew up, we were all led to believe that the crew's deaths happened in an instant, that they were blown up and never knew what hit them.  But that wasn't true.  Just like Iraq's weapons of mass destruction was untrue.  The government lies constantly because people, alas, lie constantly.  Cover-ups happen all of the time, both on personal one-on-one scales to larger scales with global implications.  The moon landings or the films of the moon landings may very well have been hoaxed.  I have an open mind to every possibility.  That was why I bought this DVD.  The trouble is, though, that Weidner should have left Kubrick out of his faked NASA footage premise - for the simple reason that it is offered to us as fact when all it is is pure speculation.  The main reason that proves Kubrick was not involved...is that Kubrick's moon looks nothing like the actual moon - and, though it doesn't ruin the majestic power of ""2001"" - the fact that the real moon's appearance did not match Kubrick's educated guesswork as to its appearance bothered him.

Anyway - there are some excellent points made over the potential use of front screen projection and even great insight into the Overlook Hotel being symbolic of America - but they do not prove one-tiny-bit that Kubrick had anything to do with staging phony moon scenes for NASA...and that if he ever told anyone about his involvement he would be axed - as was Scatman's character in the film ""The Shining.""

Great packaging (using for its cover, I believe, the very fonts used in the credits for ""2001"") and a great title song.  But the DVD is nowhere near to being a smoking gun proving Kubrick faked the moon landing film.  There is no trace of gunfire smoke in the air at all. All-in-all...this DVD is akin to the faked Roswell alien autopsy some years back.

I have a conspiracy theory of my own.  Weidner faked the story of Kubrick's involvment in a lunar film hoax...because if Kubrick's name were not associated with Weidner's speculations, sales of his DVD would be negatively impacted.  Bottom line:  a big disappointment.",1306022400,20,10817,4.666842661034847

4444290,3,B004PF0FJM,"For sheer entertainment value, this documentary is riveting and oddly compelling, however, since this film asserts several truth claims that can't be substantiated, the rating for the film must suffer accordingly. The film relies on the methodology used to support most conspiracies: when a certain artifact is viewed from an unorthodox perspective or is juxtaposed against something which seemingly has no relationship to the artifact, then the shocking truth is revealed. You can see this approach in the Darkside of the Rainbow theory: Because certain Pink Floyd songs are eerily synchronistic when played against classic films, then, unequivocally, Roger Waters and the rest of Pink Floyd must have purposefully timed their tracks to these movies (never mind corroborating this conjecture with 3rd party evidence and other sources or comparing this theory with more parsimonious explanations--it has to be the truth because a strange coincidence is the sole determining criterion)!

Perhaps Weidner's greatest leap of faith is taken in the first 5 minutes of the film, as he asserts that the Pentagon and U.S. government contacted Kubrick to fake the Moon landing. This assertion is based on two primary conjectures: (1) Because the B-52 scenes in Dr. Strangelove were so convincingly realized (at least for its time), Kubrick was the man for the job to fake the Moon Landing and (2) The U.S. wanted to fake the film evidence of the Moon landing so as not to reveal their state-of-the-art technology to the U.S.S.R. With this central premise, the rest of the film analyzes Kubrick's oeuvre in this light.

After making this audacious claim, Weidner sees no need to substantiate it with 3rd party evidence, and there are at least two ways in which Weidner could have easily bolstered his position: (1) If, as Weidner claims, the whole impetus for faking the film for the Moon landing was to conceal the technology from the Russians, why not get at least one of the presumably thousand of engineers that worked on the NASA equipment to state that the technology displayed on video and film broadcast to the public bared no resemblance whatsoever to the craft, etc., that they designed. (2) Kubrick's activity during the mid-to-late sixties is well-documented. Weidner suggests in the film that not only was Kubrick leading a double-life, privately faking the Moon landings, but that the time and effort required to convincingly fake the Moon landing was so labor-intensive as to drive him to the edge of madness. If this is so, show us the evidence that he was missing for long stretches of time, and make it certain that he was taking huge scheduling breaks from the pre-production and production phases of 2001, a movie that was known for it's extremely demanding schedule.

Weidner then suggests that the films made after 2001 are double-coded; they are on the surface Kubrick's adaptations of popular works of fiction, but on a deeper level, they are vehicles through which Kubrick can inject his own autobiography and his own ordeal over his involvement with the Moon landing. There are several problems with this thesis, but here are a few: (1) If Kubrick's ambition was to double-code his films with his own autobiographical struggle, why was the project that he spent his greatest passion on--a film that was to be the pinnacle of historical accuracy--the Napoleon project, a film that he couldn't inject autobiographical details into? (2) If the Shining was to be a concealed autobiographical statement, surely the documentary of the making of the Shining by Vivian Kubrick would have caught some overt or covert slips, clues, ""wink winks"" to this conclusion, but, there are none. (3)Finally, if the characters in the Shining are to mirror Kubrick's real life, then why would Shelley Duvall (a woman who is the antithesis of Christiana Kubrick in every way: appearance, temperament, background) be chosen to play Kubrick's wife?

Given these failings, however, I would still recommend the film for entertainment value and interesting viewing. Just as Weidner suggests there is a compromise ""third"" position that falls in between the two main positions regarding the Moon landing (one position firmly believing it was a hoax and one position adamantly defending the veracity of the Moon landings), I would suggest a third, compromise position to this film. Judging from the reviews on this film, people are either blown away by the evidence that Weidner puts forth or radically dismissive of the film. I think a third position is in order: one that allows one's self to be entertained by the film and to give Weidner credit for the lengths he goes to support his position but to also realize that the assertions made in this film are too incredulous and implausible to be regarded as the definitive case on Kubrick. In many ways Weidner's analysis of Kubrick's films (particularly the Shining) are mind-bending and brilliant, at least on the merit of creativity (to digress, Weidner's analysis of the Shining begs the question: What strain is Weidner smoking and is it widely available for public consumption?), but a lot more legwork needs to be done to make these hypotheses anywhere close to truth claims.",1303430400,12,5218,5.0922897196261685

8437617,3,B004PF0FJM,"My first impression was that this was going to be a very sophomoric and amateurish documentary edited on a desktop home computer by a conspiracy nut who was clearly reading into Kubrick's films whatever meaning he wanted just to make it fit his conspiracy theory that postulates that Stanley Kubrick made a deal with the devil, like Jack Torrance does in The Shining.  Remember Kubrick fought for autonomous control of his films after Spartacus and didn't want to make films for anyone else calling the shots but himself after that.  However, even the most ardent skeptics will have to admit that the strategically placed symbolism found in The Shining with regards to the Apollo 11 mission i.e. the American eagle on the desk behind Ullman and the conspicuously placed American flag on the desk next to him as well as his very JFK looking hairstyle were very thoughtfully and meticulously staged by Kubrick who seeded a myriad of visual clues in his shot compositions as well as the blatantly obvious ""Apollo 11"" rocket and name on Danny's knitted sweater are beyond meer coincidence.  There's definitely more going on in this film than meets the eye on a subtextual level and Kubrick was the master of shot composition and ambiguity.  You may think that the ideas presented here seem outrageously ludicrous but there's no denying that there's a very intentional and deliberate connection associated with Kubrick and the Apollo conspiracy whether you believe he helped the American government perpetuate the greatest lie in human history or not.  Was Kubrick trying to tell us or was he just being playful because people actually believed that he helped fake the moon landings after filming 2001: A Space Odyssey?  ""All work and no play makes Jack a dull boy.""  Whether it's complete poppycock or not it WILL make you think twice and you will never again be able to view The Shining the same way after seeing the connections made and the obvious details pointed out you may have simply ""overlooked.""",1510963200,,2000,4.916913946587537
