7930279,4,B000053V80,"This is the 4th volume of Sailor Moon's 1st season. Most of the episodes on this tape are filler episodes. By this point, the SM formula is pretty obvious: Serena has a problem, villain sends out monster, defeat monster, solve problem. It's pretty basic, but if you like it, this is the series for you.

Episode 13: Wedding Day Blues - One of Serena's teachers is getting married. A contest offers a trip to Hawaii for anyone who knits a wedding dress. Serena and Raye hope to win that trip for themselves, but Nephlite uses this as an opportunity to gain more energy.

Episode 14: Shutter Bugged - A young boy photographer is awarded for his excellent work. He becomes a local celebrity and Nephlite's latest target. Under the power of the Negaverse, the boy looks for girls to photograph and steal their energy.

Episode 15: Dangerous Dollies - Serena's brother, Sammy, is friends with a girl who makes dolls. After accidentally ruining her prize winning doll, Sammy feels terrible and wants to make it up to her. Nephlite targets the girl for her energy and it's up to Sailor Moon to save the day.

Episode 16: Who is that Masked Man? - Nephlite realizes that Sailor Moon's weak point is Tuxedo Mask. Nephlite sends notes to every junior high girl, claiming to be Tuxedo Mask, looking to meet in the mall. Molly, in love with Nephlite's alter ego, goes to the mall early and is attacked by Nephlite. Sailor Moon and the real Tuxedo Mask join forces to escape Nephlite. While in peril, Tuxedo Mask reveals that he doesn't know his past and feels as though he knew Sailor Moon long ago.",1105315200,4,1587,4.597173144876325

7930281,1,B000053V80,"This video is not so bad what ticked me off was that they cutted a few things from the episodes its so0o unfair
In `wedding day blues` remember the part where raye goes to serena`s house and asks her mom to sew her a wedding dress?
well serena`s mom hits her by the tray she is holding this was cut out! its suppose to be funny and also when amy goes to raye`s temple (it is actually a shrine!! not a temple, big difference!!)raye`s grandfather chases raye all over the places she bumbs amy then after that raye`s grandfather talks to amy DIC cuts out this little tiny moment where raye hits her granfather by a broom stick!! see how annoying is dic? and the cover of this video is horrible!! its soo ugly! i cant bear to look...who ever thought of these covers? pioneer is soo much better than these people...........and in shutter bugged when serena was making a speech to peter while doign that peter pushes serena and bumps her head on the display then she stands up to transform..and in dangerous dollies they shorted this scene where the dol demon chokes serena!! of course it was cut..The japanese version is much better...and the background music is changed it is not the same as in the japanese version ...i recommend this video for kids...but watch out elders where you're going to experience dic`s sailormoon.",1006819200,3,1320,4.5974576271186445
7930282,4,B000053V80,"Well... This video includes some of my favorate episodes, and I was sure glad to have it.  If you are a Sailor Moon fan, and haven't seen these eps, I highly recommend them.  If you are a SM fan and don't like these eps, well, I'm sorry.  Try the dub.  This is an excellent video, completely commercial free.  I recommend it highly!",974764800,7,332,4.290322580645161
