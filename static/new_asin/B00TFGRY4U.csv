7006012,4,B00TFGRY4U,"The tale takes place in a fictional time and place years after ""The Great Wars"" when all races now live together. Bartok (Morgan Freeman) is an old master or lord whose days are numbered. He has no heir and hands over his lands to his ""retainer"" Raiden (Clive Owen) a person of dubious background, but who now has honor. Bartok is required to make additional tribute to the first council (Robert Russell) which he finds objectionable. Things go downhill from this point and for awhile we have to deal with another drunk Hercules movie.

This was a fairly decent knight/fight film having the right amount of plot. I liked the little flashback details. Clive Owen played the role in a fairly deadpan fashion. He would not have been my first choice. Freeman does have  lengthy rant about taxes, bribes and extortion generic to all government systems.

Always seemed like the betrayed warriors could have been doing something more productive and efficient with their time.

Clive Own, Cliff Curis, Aksel Hennie, Tsuyoshi Ihara and Awn Sung-ki were cast well and did well as actors.  They seemed to fit their roles.  Most of the rest seemed to have been chosen based on the flip of a coin.  I don't have any idea why they were there and most of the time they didn't seem to either.  Morgan Freeman came across more like a peevish sociology professor at a community college than a knight.

The movie aimed high with its attempt to tell a tale of knightly nobility, chivalric codes, etc. but then completely missed the mark.  The ""noble knights"" would stoop to any level imaginable in order to further their Machiavellian scheme for vengeance.  The movie was described as if it was going to champion themes of virtue and nobility, but ended up as yet another ""stoop to any scheme imaginable in order to kill your enemies by any means necessary"" movie.

To make matters even worse, the fight scenes were absurdly done with such poor choreography it's as if they expected the audience not to be aware that being stabbed deep in the chest might at least slow someone down.",1498262400,2,1179,4.6028708133971294

  The sets looked REAL! Filthy, dirty, muddy...and teaming with MASSES OF down trodden ""peasents."" Disease ridden corpses walking around COVERED head to toe in squalor. The battered armour. The attention to EVERY scruffy detail, is what made this vid, way above average. This is the story of post glory. This is a movie where the brilliant sheen of glistening armour, is now nothing but pitted rust. All respect for the shinning kingdom, is not only GONE, but turned into a horrible warren of slums, and filthy decadence... The once, proud Knights are now only good for one thing: A target for constant humiliation. The brunt of tasteless jokes, and vile derision. what was once strong and beautiful, is now just a pile of muck. And it looks like it's going to stay that way. After all, if no one NEEDS a knight errant anymore...they all fade away...

This is easily one of the best movies I've seen in the past 10 years. It has great acting, plot, story, character development, and it creates a world of fantasy far superior to more higher budget movies and television shows. This movie is a real gem. It has action, terror, and amazing plot all wrapped up into one. It is rated R which allows for more violence and more realistic story telling unlike something like Lord of The Rings where it is bound by PG13 rules and restrictions. This movie could easily get it's own multi episode HBO series and succeed. If you know what is good for you, watch it now. People clearly don't know good film anymore if this has four stars.

7006057,5,B00TFGRY4U,"Unexpectedly, oddly good movie. A great story with really good writing and some fantastic ideas, all with a level of depth that repeatedly and consistently surprised me. The fact that it's plagued by an X-Factor of cheesiness or amateurish style is either heightening my appreciation of its positives, or gaslighting me into trying to figure out exactly what the undefinable negatives are. Within 5 minutes I was trying to understand why 2 heavyweights would have agreed to this movie. After about a half hour, it made complete sense. In a vacuum, this movie would be spectacular. Maybe they just needed better marketing, a better DP (although I can't find anything wrong with the cinematography beyond it being a little hollow), or a different director? Different music? I think the lines between outright fantasy and ""historical"" fantasy were too vaguely drawn. It doesn't stray far enough away from normalcy, so the diversions from a believable reality (like the anachronistic ethnic pluralism and nebulous melange of asiatic and European cinematic and literary norms) become almost more distracting than compelling. But again, I really liked basically everything about this movie and think that in someone else's hands (god knows whose) it could have done really well.",1485043200,,1272,5.270935960591133

7006059,1,B00TFGRY4U,"1.5 stars. A dopey Japanese/Eurotrash ripoff of Game of Thrones + Arthur. Ridiculously simplistic fantasy-game plot, horribly clunky dialogue, long passages of dull exposition with no action, presumably to save on the budget. Except for Owen and Freeman much of the cast are European and Japanese, who speak English like their mouths are full of chestnuts and would likely be lousy actors in any language. It all adds up to a dull, grim slog. Watching it is like staring into a clogged sink filled with dirty dishwater. Half a star for Freeman, who gives his silly role gravitas before exiting early (and no doubt gratefully), one star for Owen, who's just repeating his Arthur thing but oh why not if they were willing to pay him for it. Zero stars for all the rest.",1484784000,,767,4.731343283582089

7006062,4,B00TFGRY4U,"To cut to it I thoroughly enjoyed this flick.  I don't usually review movies on Amazon or otherwise however I thought this movie undeservedly underrated so I thought I would chime in.  I'm a life long movie fan though admittedly I'm no Rodger Ebert able to methodically break down the merits of a film.  Instead I prefer to judge movies on how they effect me emotionally.  When I was a young kid my Dad took me to Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade at an old time ornate theater complete with balcony, private boxes, and red carpet (pretty much the theater depicted in In Glorious Bastards only in the U.S.).  The feeling when I left that theater after the movie with my Dad was absolute bliss.  That was a five star movie experience for me and would be hard to replicate hence the four stars I've given Last Knights which is high praise for me personally.

Again as a movie buff I was surprised that this had gone under my radar, was this direct to DVD?  I found it on Amazon and how can you go wrong with a Morgan Freeman movie add Clive Owen that ought to be good right?  And it proved quite entertaining.  This from a guy who enjoyed Fast 5 even though the laws of physics were completely ignored (the back of my scientific mind were screaming ""that makes no sense!!!"").

To be honest I also enjoy the new Star Trek movies which have departed from science reality.

But I digress.  The world this is set in was confusing otherwise it was an enjoyable movie and I would recommend.",1484265600,2,1483,4.388278388278389

7006086,5,B00TFGRY4U,"In addition to being an action film loosely set during some kind of medieval period, Last Knights is all about the code of the warrior, with a mixture of unquestioned obedience to the warlord and head of the clan, total loyalty, honour and vengeance. Despite the reference to knights, this code can (and does) in fact refers to practices of multiple sets of elite and mostly aristocratic warriors across history and continents. For instance, it fits Japanese samurais and Asian aristocratic warriors more generally, but also Celtic or Germanic comitatus warriors perhaps even better than latter medieval knights. Because the film does not take place in any specific region and the Empire seems to be worldwide, the warriors belong to numerous races.

The settings are also interesting. The action takes place in an Empire with the Emperor  and his costume and some of the buildings of his capital in particular  being clearly of Byzantine inspiration. The aristocratic warrior clans, of which clan Bartok (headed by the ageing and ailing Morgan Freeman) is just one, are each headed by the descendant of a warlord and his retainers  all professional warriors but none of which seem to hold land from him, no more than the clan leader holds his own extensive lands from the Emperor.

The point here is that this is not a feudal system, and the clan heads do not seem to owe their lands and power to the Emperor in any way, although his supreme and unquestioned authority is recognised by all. The Emperors principal minister is greedy, power hungry, corrupt and eager to dominate all of the noble clans under the guise of asserting the Emperors dominance and levying increasingly crushing taxes to finance the Empires expenses (armies, roads, bridges and so on). While you are never quite told whether this minister  the arch-villain of the film  heads his own clan, you get the distinct impression that he is an upstart. It is rather clear that he is no warrior, totally ruthless and unscrupulous, cruel and sadistic, quite devious and somewhat of a coward. He does however have both the power and the money to have his own military household and following of professional warriors whose commander becomes, unsurprisingly, the rival and enemy of Raiden (Clive Owen), the commander of all the warriors of clan Bartok and  naturally  the best warrior of the lot.

The head of clan Bartok gets unjustly accused and condemned. The clans lands and possessions are seized and confiscated. The clan is dissolved and all of its members are evicted from what was their land and thrown rather brutally on the roads. While I will refrain from mentioning anything else about the plot, it is rather easy to guess what follows: the clans warriors will seek revenge over the wicked and powerful Minister against all odds and try to get at him in his fortified palace.

You can, of course, expect a lot of sword fights and rather desperate and quite impressive struggles. These are well shown, entertaining and exciting, although perhaps a bit exaggerated at times. One example is a scene at the beginning of the film where Super Clive kills five warriors single handed without receiving as much as a scratch. The assault against the Ministers palace is however simply griping and full of heroic swordplay (and bits of axe play as well!).

The three main actors playing the Head of the clan, his commander (Clive Owen, whose character is largely similar to the one he played as Artorius in King Arthur) and the evil prime minister are rather good in their respective roles, even if the Prime Ministers script borders caricature a couple of times. Other characters, the Emperor or the Prime Ministers commander of warriors in particular, are also pretty good, particularly the later who is clearly shown as doing his duty despite despising his master and respecting his enemies.

7006174,2,B00TFGRY4U,"I was embarrassed that actors of such tremendous talent were somehow lured into a predictable and over-reaching script. The script was for a younger up and coming actor who is trying to ""makes his bones"" in an action blood-filled period piece. From the outset this viewer knew the whole story was a set-up for a last valiant and supposedly epic battle full of blood and astounding heroics.  It was gratuitous and self-serving from the start. The only thing that even came close to saving this movie was the brilliance of Clive Own and Morgan Freeman. The story line was not left to the viewer's intelligence, but had to be explained in long tedious and, frankly insulting, diatribes from each of the characters. Movies of this sort are overly ambitious and always fall flat. The Movie ""Seven Samurai"" was the definitive movie for this kind of plot.

Morgan Freeman shows up too which makes this film the most ethnically mixed yet still massively incorrect casting exercise I've seen in a while. I hope everyone got paid well, I know this will not be high on anyone's resume.  I think the script may have also been translated from Japanese into English by the folks that write the instructions for the assembly of any cheap Chinese merchandise.

7006329,2,B00TFGRY4U,"Byzantium with Christianity wiped from our collective memory.
When I see Gentile writers authoring scripts that wipe Judaism from Palestine, then we will know we are not being propagandized via electronics used to imprint us with emotional reaction.
How is it possible that you could make a movie about what is obviously Byzantium without showing what was described as a sea of churches, some with golden vaults in the most elaborate city in the world?

Well... you have a propaganda goal to wipe our historical memory and in the case of this film leave us only with ""honor,"" which is the theme of the movie, fighting for our 'Lord."" One can only assume this is to inure us further to the idea of perpetual war,  much like the U.S. is now the disgraceful foot soldiers of... for a new world Imperium.

By the way, I am not a Christian but recognize it as the moral core of the West before it became a tool of Zionist goals and the security state's mind control... to enable its insider corruption.

As for the movie; I would give it 3 stars, for very fine performances by its leads all around and an interesting action adventure story, but its story is relentlessly dark, gray actually. So, it is impossible to be sympathetic about any characters unless we know them better as human beings. The few and I mean few, scenes where some light is allowed in this submerged gray world, don't help much.

In the end we can not care about the deprivations of a daughter and family and so on because we don't know enough about their love, some, but not nearly enough. In this Morgan Freeman is ill used in that he can so easily show warmth AND authority. But the tone of 'honor' of the movie would have had to have been broadened into... a spiritual reason for that honor and this was not part of the agenda.

The authors' message is that -  this is a once and future world... where ""retainers"" give an oath for life and that defines them as people and their world from that point on, is completely circumscribed by that oath for they are not really good for anything else but killing for their masters.

Is this really what America has come to? A country that watches fantasies about  what is called a New World Order really a Nazis takeover of America after a faux ending of WW11 or whatever Amazon is pushing... and never make a film about the Bolsheviks, who they were most often at the top and how they slaughtered 65 million approximately... in Russia with the help of their American secret society ""retainers,"" and the same subgroup's financial elite on Wall Street, all as a historical piece in the 'Great Game' of world domination for it is... nothing more than that... when one peels away supposedly higher goals and religious obsession.

This is a film to make... no really conjure...  young men who want to assuage that longing for glory and yes honor,  that they all have and transform it into servitude forever.",1448064000,,2916,4.565134099616858

I do not understand why the critics panned this movie???

Maybe in this age where virtue is mocked, the movie critics don't understand the appeal of strength and honor. Men standing up against tyranny might be a novel concept for a generation that is being conditioned to be a bunch of nice boys.

This was a great action movie but not over the top like most of the recent action movies. Great Character development. We need more movies with real heroes. Enough of the conflicted, anti-hero.

The acting was subpar that you have to wonder ""What is Morgan Freeman doing in this movie?"". Clive Owens was decent and he did not look out of place in the movie since he played similar roles before. That bloke that played Gezza Mott (Aksel Hennie), was terrible. He sounded like he was reading his dialogue, he should keep playing roles with no lines like his role in Hercules.

The production wasn't so bad. It did not look low budget. The cinematography was decent, there were some excellent shots. The fight scenes were decent, no shaky camera employed and the fight choreography was not over the top. I cannot stand the sword props though, long swords with no guards/tsubas. I can understand they don't want it to look like a katana since the plot was stolen from a Japanese plot.

Since the outfits and weapons clear didn't belong to any actual period in earth's history (not to mention Morgan Freeman played a Lord and there were not any medieval kingdoms with predominantly white subjects with black rulers).  So I was excited to explore this new world of knights, battles & honor.  I thought this was.going to be some post apocalyptic future or a Game of Thrones esq fantasyland. It turns out, there is practically no attention given to explaining the world in which the story is set. It might as well have been set in the crusade era middle east  It kinda reminds me if Cold War thrillers where half the Russians have horrible accents and the rest sound American or British and they're wearing Levi 's. This could be forgiven if the story was original and well crafted. But it was boiler plate hero's fighting the oppressive government villains. I barely made it all the way through.

7006458,5,B00TFGRY4U,Wow! Wow! Such great action and acting. The good overcoming the evil when all seems hopeless. Morgan Freeman delivering incredible lines that had so much truth in them. The performance by Clive Owen and the rest of the cast. The only negative was that the landscape was always dark and dreary as if they filmed the picture by candle light. I suppose they wanted to show a land that was harsh and the toughness of the people who had to survive in it. I pretty much cannot say enough about this movie and wonder why it was not a box office smash. I did not even know it was playing on the big screen and that is my lament<----why didn't it play in my town.

It was fairly predictable but such is the case with 90% of movies made today.

7006526,4,B00TFGRY4U,"Brief:
I enjoyed the alternative culture with the whole eastern/persian blending of concepts like Samurai honor and european knighthood.

Pros:
Decent Action Sequences
Morgan Freeman!
Clive Owen!
Cool environments
Neat world
Excellent acting
Very Samurai Meets Chivalry meets Persia

Cons:
Everyone in power is dumb, yo.
The pretense is a little lightweight
I didn't feel a genuine connection between characters.

Recommended for people who like:
Braveheart
Rob Roy
the Last Samurai
Gladiator
Troy
Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon.
47 Ronin

Details:
The video is great, and the acting and atmosphere is great. I felt however that not only was the emperor kind of a dunce, but so too was Morgan & Clive's characters. I suppose without the blatant lack of insight or strategic thought then there wouldn't have been the story we saw in the movie, which while well told, wasn't original in any way, as it is quintessentially the tale of the 47 ronin. I think I would've preferred to see a story where, instead of a ""vengeance/ronin flick"" it would have been interesting and fresh to see Clive cut down the emperor during Bartok's trial, and the story be about the aftermath of THAT kind of crazy.

Overall, it was good. I just didn't see what the point of Lord Bartok's position was during the trial or what he really was hoping to accomplish. I also didn't understand how Clive's honor wasn't broken when he carried out Bartok's order, but I guess for most of us honor is maybe more of a set of guidelines than rules per say? (shrug) I'm sure others would disagree.

It was good, it was well thought out for the most part. I have to say the Minister's character probably had the most genuine involvement with their personality and expression, while the rest of the characters didn't offer much to connect to. The Minister was a pretty messed up puppy, but I felt like out of all the characters, he was the most emotionally invested for the audience, excepting maybe the commander who was able to very subtly reflect strong character. I liked him (the Minister's Commander) more than Clive or his buddies, and more than Freeman's character, because essentially Morgan was just playing his normal type of character.

So, without too many spoilers - it's absolutely worth watching if you're into any of the movies above, and I would've been more disappointed seeing it in theaters because triple the cost and twice the headache would've magnified the deficits. Watching it at home, on my nice 40+"" TV was well worth the money.",1437609600,,2519,4.857808857808858

7006530,5,B00TFGRY4U,"Last Knights was an unexpected delight. Although that plot pacing starts slow by spending time to set up the story narrative and the relationship between the lead knight and his lord, after 30 minutes the pace and plot engagement does pick up nicely. There are several superb moments of writing combined with the acting (Morgan Freeman's defense to the Emperor was a compelling interpretation)...dealing with the nature of honor between soldiers (Clive Owen generates a natural esprit de corps in the role as lead knight), role to the nation, and fidelity to one's lord. It is essentially the storyline of the Japanese epic ""The 47 Samurai"" meets ""The Count of Monte Cristo"" placed in a surrealistic, western feudal state. Unlike previous versions of ""The 47 Samurai"" the plot tension in Last Knights is easy to grasp for Western audiences (quite an achievement in contrast to previous renditions of the novel to the Big Screen). It is well worth a full rental or buying a ticket for a theater experience. If you enjoy movies about warriors (""Gladiator,"" ""The Eagle""), the virtue of personal honor (""Last Samurai""), and are intrigued by creative nature of revenge (""Count of Monte Cristo,"" ""Hamlet"") then you will especially enjoy this flick.",1437523200,4,1242,5.0634146341463415

7006577,3,B00TFGRY4U,"While not a great movie, it does a somewhat solid job in the end, of ""opening one's eyes"" to a newer, ""better"" code of honor than that of the older traditional Bushido Code of the Japanese samurai. Morgan Freeman's Lord Bartok is the embodiment of the older code of honor, in which he is recognizing that he has not fully lived up to his duties from protecting those he should be protecting by standing up to tyrannical dictatorship and corrupt masters. Mainly because of the potential retributions that would be returned to his family, and to the families of those who would follow him into acting against the Emperor, Lord Bartok never took the path of being the people's warrior, and instead only stood up politically against the Emperor, in hopes to check his power by having other lords hopefully side with him. While the other lords secretly agree with his words, they fear to take action. Thus, Lord Bartok is executed by Clive Owen's Raiden. While this was not as thoughtfully represented in the film as it could have been, deeper consideration into Lord Bartok's actions come to this conclusion.

Raiden (also Raijin) is a god of thunder and lightning in Japanese mythology. While not living up to any myths, Clive Owen's Raiden is the storm that's coming. Aksel Hennie's Gezza Mott is the ""misbehaved child"" waiting for the storm to pass. His greed and hunger for power brought on the demise of Lord Bartok, and the storm that is Raiden, begins.

One of the problems with the movie is that the First Act is a slow-paced 35 minutes. The Second Act is also an equally long and slow-paced 35 minutes. The audience witnesses the political and personal motivations between Gezza Mott and Sung-kee Ahn's Auguste, as well as Gezza Mott's lengths to ensure his own protection. It appears that Raiden is falling into his old ways, drinking, whoring, and gambling - but that's merely a ruse. Eventually, you get to see the planning that took place over the course of a year for Raiden to exact his eventual revenge once Gezza Mott lets his guard down. The Third and Final Act is the strategic execution of that planning.

However, the build-up to the Final Act is a little bit of a letdown. While you can see a bit of the fighting ability of the knights under Raiden's lead, and a glimpse of their discipline, what you don't see are their tactical strengths. It is assumed that his knights are just good fighters, and five of them in an open area could hold hundreds of guards at bay for a while. What would have been better is if the five knights fighting to give Raiden time to get to Gezza Mott would have used a tactical chokepoint where they could realistically fend off a large group of opposing warriors. What makes them able to hold off a horde of guards is that they're Raiden's knights, and that's just disappointing, especially for a 80-minute build-up to the final fight scene between Raiden and Ito.

The swordfighing scenes are not as well choreographed as it could have been. It relies on spin moves, which is not really a good fighting move, a lot of slow motion and quick camera cuts, and very simple strokes of the sword. It doesn't focus on footwork, parrying, countering, or other maneuvers that make swordfighting actually exciting. It merely tries to make the heroes look good and build tension with the music and slow motion.

The movie tries to do too much with too little, and there lies its faults. It focuses too much time trying to fool the audience, and needless time building up minor characters to no real emotional impact. Cliff Curtis's Lt. Cortez and the youngest knight in training's death scene did nothing for me. The face off between Raiden and Ito also had no real impact, other than their mutual respect for the other's obligation to duty and honor.

Tsuyoshi Ihara, who plays Ito, the loyal retainer to Gezza Mott, also represents the more traditional code of honor to obey his master, no matter how corrupt he may be. He fails in the same way that Lord Bartok failed, but in a different manner. While not vital to any real part of the story, there could have been more emotional impact if they decided to spend some flashback time with maybe Raiden and Ito fighting together in the Great Wars and being war buddies, but Ito's sense of honor forces Raiden to also sacrifice the life of his friend in order to get to Gezza Mott.

At any rate, I'm not a movie reviewer, and don't pretend to be, but sometimes I wish movies went a certain way so I could enjoy them better. The movie is at least 2 and a half stars, but had potential to be a 4 star movie.",1436486400,,4592,4.585870889159562

The scenery, cinematography and ambiance set in the movie were great with the right feel of the time.  Morgan Freeman as always plays the role very well and Clive Owen as the brooding knight does an admirable job in the role.  Even the supporting cast all play their roles well.  The movie is a bit slow though, especially through the first half of the movie.  It is one of those you have to stick with to really enjoy.  Some of the scenes were a bit too long and the ending a bit drawn out.  But by the time it was finished I felt entertained but at the same time felt that the movie dragged through portions as well.  This is a decent movie to watch though as long as you hang with the slow portions as the story is pretty good.

I'm so thankful that Amazon customers have independent minds and are open to ignoring those reviews and deciding for themselves. Otherwise, I might have missed seeing this movie, True, it's not the best film, but certainly worthy of watching. The beginning is good; the middle can be considered draggy, but the end is good. In fact, they left the end open for a sequel. But, since it wasn't a box office smash, that seems improbable. However, if some movie company could see past that and envisions the possibility to build a better sequel--it could be one of those movies where the sequel is better than the original.

7006646,5,B00TFGRY4U,"Why this wasn't released in theaters is beyond me.  The story is solid with great writing.  Only to be eclipsed by the exceptional performances of the actors.  I mean wow, just some amazing performances.  What's really refreshing is that the story drives the movie, not special effects and explosions. Take that Hobbit and Michael Bay.

This is a refreshing take on the dark hero.  With a villain, you can really hate.  It also creates an amazing world, of which we only scratch the surface.

Rent it and be entertained!",1432857600,,520,4.764044943820225
7006647,5,B00TFGRY4U,"I can't believe this film didn't get more publicity. I rented this simply because Morgan Freeman was in it and Clive Owen is nice to look at :) Little did I know how much I would enjoy this film. Let it be known that I am huge fan of sci-fi, fantasy, King Arthur tales, etc so the time period and premise was right up my alley. While the characters weren't super developed, they were developed enough. The action was excellent and I felt the movie was over too soon.

7006648,5,B00TFGRY4U,"How's this production as illustrative of our Global Village: A film based on a classic Japanese story, filmed in the Czech Republic by a Korean director and Korean technical staff, with extras from Asia and Central Europe. and three leading roles played by an Englishman, an American and a Japanese. WOW! Who could forge all that diversity into a satisfying esthetic whole?Well, the simple answer is - this very production succeeds admirably. You cannot go wrong with Morgan Freeman and Clive Owen. Morgan Freeman commands the first 45 minutes with his authority and gravitas; and you feel his moral presence throughout, even after he departs the script. And Clive Owen - Can any actor approach him in the convincing portrayal of the traditional hero? His acting is economical but totally persuasive. And the Japanese actor who plays his antagonist is a good man serving a bad master; his characterization of a man who is trapped by a code of (dis)honor is poignant. The setting is a medieval world in winter under a perpetual dark sky; this is a society oppressed by power, with no sweetness or light. It is, in fact, the latest remake of the 40
Ronnin, a classic Samurai epic tale, obviously transposed in time and place, but still embodying the ancient martial wisdom. This is a respectful remake by people who truly believe in the values of their story, and intend to do it justice and honor. They succeed admirably.",1432512000,4,1420,4.847736625514403
7006649,5,B00TFGRY4U,"This is a really good adaptation of the real story of the forty-seven Ronin.  A few twists to the plot also kept things very interesting.  Not sure what all any bad reviews are about but if you like this sort of film, then I feel you are in for a treat.  I happened to like King Arthur with Clive Owen and I feel that this is a better movie.  Morgan Freeman plays a limited but pivotal role (think Lord Ako in the story of the forty-seven Ronin and Clive Owen plays a pseudo Oishi, Lord Ako's commander.  Again, there are some refreshing twists that separate the two stories while adhering to the martial code.
Hope you enjoy.

One good thing is that Owen gets to shine as he does best towards the end of the film (won't spoil it.)  This is however another movie that I will recommend you rent not buy.

7006667,4,B00TFGRY4U,"4 1/2 STARS --- A RICHLY FILMED AND MORE UNIVERSAL (multicultural) RETELLING OF A JAPANESE NATIONAL EPIC

WHAT IS A CHUSHINGURA?  SEE HISTORICAL NOTE BELOW AND THIS QUICK DEFINITION:  ""Chushingura"" is a Japanese term specifically for a fictionalized stage version of historical events surrounding the Ako Incident in 1703 (with impetus in 1701).  We often call it ""The 47 Ronin"".  It's kind of like a passion play.  The Chushingura is a national Epic of Japan and has countless tellings.  (Different people have different tastes and that's completely valid, but please accept some effort to give background even if the movie approach itself doesn't suit all fans)

A RE-IMAGINING OF A CLASSIC TALE -  It's true not everyone will enjoy the somewhat fantasy approach to this adaptation.  But the Japanese themselves have countless versions used to inspire loyalty and honor over the centuries.  Those Japanese versions range from the fairly accurate to the very far out.  Many Westerners are familiar with the tale of the 47 Ronin (masterless Samurai) through the classic 1962 film by Inagaki.  However, some may not be aware this is far more than just a Japanese legend and is based on real events.  This particular iteration of the Chushingura charts a different course with a multicultural approach.  The opening narration spells it out, speaking of an empire with people of all ""color, creed, and faith"".  Though it appears medieval, this movie is a fantasy in that it belongs in no defined time or place.  It incorporates elements of many times and countries.  Whether medieval castles, Indian crenulations on buildings, Asian fighting styles,  Ottoman architecture, Baroque palaces, or the interior furnishings similar to Ancient Rome - the design elements of this film are stylistically dazzling (if a bit busy at times).  The cinematography brings it all together in haunting ways like grey scenes of foggy, snow-draped countryside contrasting sounds of a female classical Arabic singer that channels the legendary Ofra Haza.  The multicultural cast strongly reinforces the theme.  The Chushingura is expected to be retold in many forms to preserve it in human memory.

THE PLOT (No spoilers):  Lord Bartock (Morgan Freeman) is nobleman from an ancient house.  Commander Raiden (Clive Owen) is chief commander of all his forces, but also treated as a son though he is not of noble birth.  Raiden's past is dark and violent, but he was taken in by Lord Raiden who saw great potential.  Raiden is now a man of great conviction to the unbreakable code of elite soldiers: ""possess a noble heart of courage, right conduct, and absolute devotion to one's master"".  This is a take on the Bushido Code.  One day a courier arrives with a summons for Lord Bartok to appear before the new minister, Gezza Mott, who is also favored to become the next First Council to the Emperor himself.  Gezza Mott is utterly corrupt.  Though the summons mentions discussing new protocols, implicit in this message is that Lord Bartok must bring a bribe to the powerful minister.  However, Bartok is the most honorable of men.  As he explains, wounds of honor are self inflicted.  Lord Bartok and his retainers travel to the capital and he meets with Mott.  However, the private meeting turns into confrontation, and from confrontation into altercation where Mott is lightly wounded.  Lord Bartok now must face trial for raising a sword to an official of the Emperor's rule.  Grave offence has been committed in both directions according to law and tradition of the code.  Commander Raiden is now faced with dire consequence and obligation.  He and the other retainers owe absolute allegiance to their lord's honor, but cannot raise a hand to Gezza Mott without consequence of death.  Raiden's youthful demons appear to haunt him again and threaten to destroy his world.  Meanwhile, the code and honor demand that accounts be settled or honor is lost.

OTHER THOUGHTS:  I am not saying this is a perfect film and to be honest the title threw me off.  However, I was amazed at the substance this movie possessed if understood correctly.  You don't have to care about the 47 Ronin to enjoy this movie.  But it does add depth for those that do.  Both the slight fantasy element and the retelling of 47 Ronin may put some viewers off.  That's understandable because everyone has different tastes.  There are some melodramatic moments.  All I can say is that for a movie I had never heard of in theaters, I was amazed at the effort and quality put into this film.  I believe the inclusion of 18th century palaces in the architecture was no accident in a world that is otherwise medieval.  The original Ako Incident happened at the beginning of the 18th century in feudal Japan.

HISTORICAL PERSPECTIVE ON THE CHUSHINGURA AND THE 47 RONIN: As I mentioned before, the Ako Incident is the true historical occurrence while Chushingura is a reference to the same tale fictionalized in plays, Kabuki, literature, and film.  It is one of, if not the most, famous of Japanese epics and has been used for centuries to inspire and teach a nation.  Though the names are changed for this adaptation, the characters in most traditional renditions are represented with their real names.  The short version of their names being Kira (Protocol Official) and Lord Asano.  The end of this movie is a little different and mysterious than the real event.  I had mixed emotions about that.",1431648000,31,5443,4.951381215469613

PROs
+ Awesome filming locations in the Czech Republic provide castles and a medieval vibe
+ Proficient cinematography, including magnificent scenes shot during snowfall
+ The ninja-like Ranger Regiment swordsmen were kind of fun to watch in battle; clearly this is fantasy with no illusions of being our world (e.g., conforming to the laws of physics), so just be prepared for that

CONs
- The villain meeting his doom at the hands of the protagonist is an all too obvious ending
- Plot lacked complexity
- If you don't respect a military values system, then it's hard to be impressed by Last Knights

It's entirely within the fantasy/mythology mold, which has never entertained me.  I enjoy fiction within a genuine historical context, but simply inventing fictional history-as-you on a very broad scale, I find exceedingly boring.  It doesn't require much writing talent, and it tends to fall into very timeworn and predictable patterns.  Sure enough, I found myself dozing at several points through this yawner.  The pace is grandiosely plodding, and the plot is has been portrayed over and over again.  As another reviewer noted, within the first 15 minutes, you were never left guessing as to what was going to happen.  You could easily predict the entire subsequent unfolding of the story.  How much more boring can you get?  Excellent acting, but not good enough to overcome a very tired script and exhausted storyline.",1430265600,,958,5.116129032258065

7006728,4,B00TFGRY4U,"While this is a medieval tale is not, unfortunately, an epic tale. This despite the fact that it mirrors, with a few subtle changes, the classic Japanese story (and later movies), 47 Ronin. If you are familiar with that then most of the plot devices are obvious and, particularly in the second act, heavily over played. I think it is the second act that really keeps this movie from becomes excellent and instead drags it down until I found myself internally yelling at the screen, ""I get it! Move on already!"". Had they taken the act in a more original direction then, perhaps, the later reveals and ""twists"" would be more dramatic. Still, the fighting sequences are good and the third act is satisfying.

All of this might come across as more negative than my rating suggests. But I did enjoy this movie. The cinematography and costume design lends a very distinctive feel. The cast is deep and generally well done. On a 10 point scale I would probably give this a 6.5 for being a good weekend action movie.",1429833600,,1009,4.605555555555555

The settings and costumes are fabulous, but the film suffers from poor directing and script writing. Even the title is hokey.  And it is sloooow, however, I can see this developing a cult following as a martial arts type movie.

This film is a Bushido samurai Story... But made for a Americans. So instead of Samurai they use knights. Instead of everyone being one race, they use a mixture. Instead of a historical time, this film is set in a fantasy world that is similar to a medieval kingdom with the above mentioned changes.

This plot is based on a real group of samurai who lived in 18th century japan and avenged the death of their master, exemplifying the bushido code. Obviously based on that story like 300 and its sequel are based on what happened in Greece when the Persians invaded. Its a movie after all for entertainment, they just take a well known story plot in Japan and built a world and cast of characters around it for Americans to enjoy.

7006779,3,B00TFGRY4U,"I had heard that this film was a Medieval tale. I feel that is misleading. The setting is an unspecified age after the ""Great Wars,"" and the melting pot of races and massively walled cities could suggest a rebuilding after a post-apocalyptic period. Unfortunately, the work never really goes in that direction, and rather than embracing what could have been a richer tapestry of Steampunk or Mad Max-esque contraptions, the film settles for a world wherein all technology is pretty much left at a Medieval pace - swords, bows, and stone construction. In this vein, the movie title borrows the term ""knights"" from Arthurian legend, but ""samurai"" would be more accurate. Of course, that theme has been done before, and this film echoes the legend of the 47 Ronin. Religion is conspicuously absent (as the Emperor still represents the only God figure), and while the performances are fine, and a fair sampling of the warrior's philosophy is portrayed, there is no new ground in the telling. Less time could have been spent on our hero's fall from grace, but I do respect the depth of that commitment.

Still, it would have been nice to experience an added twist or two folded into the plot. The movie has a good pace with the opening battles, both physical and political, but then lingers while we await a determination of whether revenge will or will not be exacted upon our villainous minister, who while thoroughly detestable, fails to rise beyond that of a political toad. Indeed, one might really consider the minister's lead retainer, to be the opposing force to our hero, bound by the unbreakable warrior's code requiring defense of his master, just as much as our hero followed his own duty. Yet one must ask, if you serve an evil or unworthy lord without question, what then does that make of yourself? Does the warrior's code sustain cowardly acts because the only thing that matters is absolute fealty? I'm not a fan of this worldview, and perhaps that sour taste carries over to my impression of the film as does Morgan Freeman stating that sometimes we cannot fight, but we can protest. He regrets not taking his chance to slay the minister, and I regret it too. Next time, run the bastard through... although, there is also the metaphor that one cannot kill ""corruption,"" it is an ongoing contest that humans wage forever.

Parental Warning: There is no nudity, cursing or extraordinary gore. You do have the expected results of swordsmanship, suggested sexual situations, and women are given no role in this society apart from wives (one abused) and prostitutes. That's another slam in my book, but I get the idea of being consistent to the fantasy that was written. I just don't like it. There is some redemption in the relationship between our main character and his wife, but not enough to remove the taint.

Overall, there are no fatal flaws in this movie, and the actors and cinematography were solid. It's really the story that prevents this from getting a better review. I wouldn't let that stop you from renting the movie, just don't go into it with high expectations.",1428364800,13,3088,4.811676082862523

In this mythical land there is an Emperor, his council, free peasants and people who live aligned in clans, each clan headed by one family.  When one councillor becomes too corrupt, Morgan Freeman, head of the Bartok family, makes a decision.

I will be looking forward to purchasing this on bluray... something that I don't do often.

Update: I feel it is important to mention that if you are expecting something historically based or fixed in a certain century, then maybe the movie is not for you.  This is purely a fictional story with clear Asian cinematography and a beautiful score.  Elements from the 17th century and every single one before seem to be combined, which created a unique viewing experience.
