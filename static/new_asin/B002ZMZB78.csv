4041985,4,B002ZMZB78,"Alan Alda is the perfect host for this series-smart, self-depricating and a genuine intellectual curiosity about what could be a very dry subject.  The work with young children was fascinating.  Woth every minute of your time to watch and learn.",1361491200,,245,5.1
4041986,4,B002ZMZB78,"Enjoyable to see how we evolved.  Sometimes it felt like Alan Alda was a bit too over the top, but I think he truly enjoyed the assignment, and to be honest, I would too!  I often thought he had an agenda re:  why Neanderthals were unable to 'catch up' or evolve.  It was explained to him many times that there were much fewer Neanderthals than our forebears, and, therefore, since learning occurs in groups, and occurs faster and better in larger groups, Neanderthals were at an evolutionary disadvantage.  They did, however, survive a tremendously long time and obviously their mode of survival was effective, obviating the need for change.  Aside from this annoying focus, I did enjoy his enthusiasm, learned a great deal about where we came from, and, on the whole, feel a bit more enlightened about the 'human spark.'  I do recommend this series.  If, however, you believe that life has only been on this planet for nigh on 2,000 years, stay away!  You will swear this show is the devil's work!  : )",1360540800,,1004,4.653409090909091
4041987,5,B002ZMZB78,"This documentary was so interesting that I watched all 3 episodes practically in a row. Very well done, well researched and very informative. Alan Alda is sometimes funny, always witty, and full of good information. Really enjoyed it!",1340841600,,234,5.184210526315789
4041988,4,B002ZMZB78,"First off - I've always appreciated Alan Alda's humor and self deprecation. A nice treat from big egos.

Secondly: I spent most of my life creating products and nutrition to help make people smarter, faster, longer lasting. Like a good gum.

This series is really great. I can share it with my kids, or simply take it in and gain bits and pieces of the Big Picture that may have escape me in my research.

Seeing Alan's gray matter light-up is cool. Understanding how the brain is effected by various stimuli is uber cool.

My questions now involve:
1) How would his brain light-up if inspired by software (programs that challenge thinking) like&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Brainstorming-and-Creativity-Software/dp/B004EFJRX8/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Brainstorming and Creativity Software</a>
2) Under the influence of Nootropics (natural neural stimulants) like&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Real-NZT-48-Experiential-Brain-Nutrients/dp/B00AS662GC/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Real NZT-48 - Experiential Brain Nutrients</a>, how much more progressive would his results be (in both illuminating the fMRI, and illuminating his thoughts)?

Brain research continues to progress at an incredible rate. The ability to dampen the effects of Alzheimers and dementia - even reverse them, is incredible. We're no longer victims to our condition, but quickly becoming less allergic to our environment and the march of time.

Looking forward to more of these shows. And BONUS!: With your Amazon Prime account, these babies are free. Very cool.",1337472000,,1623,6.3881278538812785
4041989,5,B002ZMZB78,"My 9-yr-old son used the episode, So Human, So Chimp, to make a Venn Diagram for school about the differences and similarities between humans and chimpanzees.

What is it that makes us, that is humans, different from other beings on planet Earth?  This difference is the HUMAN SPARK, the subject that's analyzed in this fascinating documentary hosted by M*A*S*H*'s Hawkeye Pierce himself, Alan Alda.

In order to answer this big question, other questions are answered such as:

(1) What is the origin of the human spark?
(2) When and why did the human spark ignite?
(3) Why didn't it ignite in our cousins, the Neanderthals?
(4) Why didn't our present-day relatives (chimps and other apes) never get the spark?

Alda travels all over the world to talk with those actively engaged in research to answer the big question and the other questions that follow from it.

This documentary is in three episodes.  Each episode is composed of six chapters.

The first episode is entitled ""Becoming Us.""  Here our earliest ancestors are examined.  My favourite chapter has the title ""Crash-Course in Primitive Tool-Making.""

Episode number two has the title ""So Human, So Chimp.""  Here there is examination of our closest living relatives.  My favourite chapter is called ""Apes vs. Humans.""

The final episode (and my personal favourite) is entitled ""Brain Matters.""  In this episode, neuroscientists in Boston scan and analyze Alan Alda's brain.  The last chapter of this episode is particularly important and interesting.  It is called ""The Essential Human Spark.""

Watching Alan Alda host this documentary, you get the sense that he could teach basket-weaving and make it interesting, relevant, and fun!  You can't help but like him and his curiosity about the subject is infectious.

Finally, the DVD itself (the one released in 2010) is perfect in picture and sound quality.  It has one extra of deleted scenes.  (Note that the title for the second episode given on the DVD menu is incorrect,)

In conclusion, this is a fascinating documentary that attempts to answer an equally fascinating question about humans!!

4041991,5,B002ZMZB78,"Alda does a pretty good job seeking out and chatting with interesting and well-informed people doing up-to-date research into what makes humans human.  We saw the three-part series on PBS and thought enough of it to buy a copy for the family.  Unless you actively and regularly seek out reports of current research into the evolution of the human mind and brain, you'll almost certainly find much of interest here.",1281225600,2,414,4.9
4041992,5,B002ZMZB78,"Despite comments by others, Alan Alda makes a great narrator for this series. His wonderment (real or acted) in the science he is discussing is infectious and draws the viewer in.

4041994,3,B002ZMZB78,"I missed this show on PBS, so I had to wait for this DVD release. The show is broken up into 3 distinct parts, each 60 minutes in length. The first part explains how the human species evolved, and why we charted one course of evolution as opposed to another. The focus is on anthropology, evolutionary anthropology, and archaeology. The second part focuses on the similarities and differences between humans and our closest relatives, chimps. And the final part was about the brain and how brain imaging can provide clues about our thought processes and language. The show, combined as a whole, was about what makes us uniquely human (or not); we are actually very similar to other animals. Alan Alda is the host and narrator - he was just average as a host; he's extremely old, not very knowledgeable about the subject and looked tired the whole time. If you have ever read or watched Guns, Germs and Steel by Diamond (and enjoyed it), then this is similar and would likely be of interest to you. The good thing is that because the episodes are in 60 minute segments you can pick and choose what part you do/don't want to watch.

4042004,5,B002ZMZB78,"I am an Alan Alda fan in spite of his politics and occasionally sappy remarks, and he does a very creditable job in this documentary.  It is challenging research he is presenting and a scientist can find some flaws in some of the experiments.  Nevertheless, it is a good job well done and very worthwhile of the time if you have any curiosity about why we are so different than our many quite close relatives.  I was one day staring into the eyes of a chimp at a well known zoo.  He and I examined each others eyes for what must have been at least five minutes, and were unaware of the crowd surrounding us.  I have often reflected on that interlude and marvelled at what must have gone through each of our minds during that time.  It was a humbling and acute experience, and one that I would like to repeat.  We are so close genetically, and yet so far from each other in capability.  Why?",1402704000,,890,4.287425149700598

4042018,2,B002ZMZB78,"This could have been much better.  Focusing on, and in many ways mocking, the Neanderthals seems to exclude the other branches of the human ancestry that migrated into Asia and Australia.  Evidence of ancient mariners over 800,000 years old has been found in the West Pacific archipelagos.  And as far as the Neanderthals are concerned, they had quite a run without seeing much need to change anything, and might have still been around if another species (us) hadn't shown up.  Sorry but I wanted to like this, but when the story stopped short of following the natural path of migration around the coastal plains of southwestern Asia, I zoned out.",1393977600,,647,4.8545454545454545

  Alan Aida is a natural when it comes to programs like this and he approaches this complex question of why we are the way we are with the wide-eyed speculation of a child. He insists his questions are answered in a such a way that we in the audience feel like participants in the proceedings.

  Ultimately the viewer comes away feeling that Mr. Alda is acting as an inquisitor for the common man which makes the show informative and intriguing. He delves deep into the workings of the human brain and why the 'human spark' as he calls it came to be. This spark, he posits, somehow sets us apart from the working brains of other animals and he questions its origin in us.

4042053,5,B002ZMZB78,"I've read and watched many, many discussions about what separates our version of human from all the extinct lineages.  This one gets to the heart of the matter and has more depth than most.",1374883200,,189,4.5588235294117645
4042054,5,B002ZMZB78,"I enjoyed seeing how things work.
Everything was explained real well.
I phoned it so entertaining I watched all the episodes.",1371168000,,125,5.0
4042055,5,B002ZMZB78,"This is a well organized, fast moving discussion that looks into what genetic change made it possible for humans to think and create in ways that are so much more advanced than other animals.",1370044800,,191,4.647058823529412
4042056,5,B002ZMZB78,Alan Alda makes Science easy. As a professor I feel that all my students must watch this particular series so they can understand better the learning process.,1367280000,,158,4.888888888888889
4042057,5,B002ZMZB78,"Fun tour through some interesting research on social and perceptual differences that make us ""human"".

Alan Alda brings enjoyable curiosity and humor to what might be a dry subject (digging in a cave for the last thirty years).",1367107200,,227,4.973684210526316
4042058,4,B002ZMZB78,"The scenery is lovely and Mr. Alda's attitude of a ""learner's mind"" makes this series interesting. I watched all 3 episodes in one sitting.",1366416000,2,139,4.833333333333333
4042059,2,B002ZMZB78,"Never heard of this series before I saw it listed under Prime; now I know why.

Hawkeye sets out to ""explore"" his somewhat dubious, anthropocentric premise with murky interviews of a bunch of class B sci-talent, strung together with his patented smarmy narration.  I had to quit after about half an episode, fearing that, if I had to listen to old B. Franklin repeat the title phrase ""The Human Spark"" one more time, I might slash my wrists.

Surely Alan can fund a quiet retirement with the residuals from his classic series without having to subject us to this kind of sad mish-M.A.S.H.  I wouldn't tune back into it for Alda kimchi in Korea.",1365811200,2,644,4.62280701754386
4042060,5,B002ZMZB78,"Most documentaries are thinly-veiled propaganda for whatever pet-theories the producers want to indoctrinate upon viewers.  (ie-  Loose Change)

The Human Spark is great, and Alan Alda does a great job asking simple questions about the ""spark"" of intelligence that makes humans different from animals, and those questions lead him to scientists who have been testing the same ideas. Each scientist has an agenda, and the creators of this series shows both the arguments and counter-arguments, and show real examples of these scientific arguments being tested.  The beauty of the film is that it doesn't lecture you on which theory is right.  The viewer is presented several theories and examples and tests of each, and is allowed to form their own opinions.  I wish all documentary filmmakers shared that sort of neutral-bias.

Alan Alda as non-scientist is the perfect host to ask such questions.  The series is easy to watch because all of this ""hard science"" is reduced into conversational terms and the producers do a great job to ""show me"" when the subject matter gets complicated.  This is well produced, easy to watch, and accessible even to the ""low information"" viewers.  (I hate that term)

I strongly recommend this series to all animals on Earth that walk upright on two legs.",1365811200,7,1288,5.056872037914692
4042061,5,B002ZMZB78,New look at what makes us different from other animals & how or minds work. Why & how or brains got so big.,1365465600,2,107,3.6956521739130435
4042062,5,B002ZMZB78,"This three episode series explores both human similarities and differences with our closest ape and hominid cousins. Just what is that factor that makes modern humans behave so differently than any other animal on earth? Alan Alda adds his own wit and charm to this wide ranging study that brings anthropology, archaeology, and modern technology to bear on this question with some surprising answers.",1363305600,,400,5.265625
4042063,3,B002ZMZB78,"Would have been a 5 star, but the video quit streaming and went into a loop about 3/4 of the way through. This happens too often.",1361664000,,129,4.0
8385187,4,B002ZMZB78,interesting... not as good as PBS program but it was interesting enough to watch all three episodes,1449100800,,99,4.882352941176471
8385188,5,B002ZMZB78,Fascitating - I learned so much.,1431561600,,32,4.5
8385189,3,B002ZMZB78,Its ok worth watching I guess.,1419552000,,30,4.166666666666667
8385190,5,B002ZMZB78,Enjoyed the program.  Just wish he would have continued onwards.,1419465600,,64,5.4
8385191,5,B002ZMZB78,Wonderful documentary lead by Alan Alda. Definitely worth getting.  Tells what the fetus/infant can do at each stage of the pregnancy and how the nerves fit together and how each part intertwines with each other. Fascinating.,1419292800,,225,5.25
8385192,5,B002ZMZB78,This is a fascinating series!!!  It really answered questions about the role social interaction played on the development of our brains.  I highly recommend it!,1418169600,,160,5.36
8385193,4,B002ZMZB78,Must see,1417305600,,8,3.5
8385194,3,B002ZMZB78,"It goes the long way around to show what most of us already know.  Speach, self-awareness, analytical thought processes, cooperation",1417219200,,132,5.6
8385195,4,B002ZMZB78,"Some very interesting segments on what makes humans different from all other creatures and when ""the spark"" originated. Also many shocking similarities I would comfortably say most do not know. Includes fascinating tests of chimps and children for instance that may be eye opening to many and the entire series gives much food for thought... enjoy!",1416528000,,348,5.232142857142857
8385196,4,B002ZMZB78,Very informative and interesting. Alan Alda makes the perfect host because he seems so genuinely curious all bout the topic and is having fun exploring the concept if the human spark.,1416528000,,183,4.935483870967742
