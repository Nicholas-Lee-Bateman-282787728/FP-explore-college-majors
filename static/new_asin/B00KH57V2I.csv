6426408,5,B00KH57V2I,"Wonderful anime for lovers of memory-loss driven romance with lots of bland and unnecessary drama. That may sound like a con for most, but I fully enjoyed this anime and bought it because I liked it so much. Sure it has flaws, but if you love romance with drama and jazz, you will enjoy this anime. I have both parts, and I wish they were in one collection. Other than that, the Blu-ray is the best quality and you get what is described. Wonderful addition to my collection.",1432857600,,474,4.3977272727272725

6426410,5,B00KH57V2I,"The protagonists struggles with each other from the beginning bring a realistic feel to the characters as the main protagonist banri and kouko both convey their interest in to the person they believe their in love with while at the same time as the story progresses they start having natural feelings and attraction for each other and from then on things get funny, unexpected and exciting as love triangles form, overall an amazing anime and story and its just the first half of it all.",1424649600,3,487,4.741176470588235
6426411,4,B00KH57V2I,"My review for this collection is strictly based on the product itself and not the actual series. I'm assuming if you are buying this you have atleast seen part of the anime and already know what you're buying.

Like all of Sentai's releases, the release is very minimalistic. You get the discs, a case, and cover art. No fancy inserts, or series related extras ( besides the usual clean OP + ED ).

With that said, I prefer everything to be of the upmost quality. Which brings me to my first complaint. The art thats printed on the discs is very bad. It looks as if they designed the disc art in a very low resolution and blew it up to fit on the discs. The images are very pixelated and the text is slightly blurry. Almost what you would expect to see from a home made bootleg.

My second complaint is more subjective. I really wish they would have dubbed this series. I know anime is still a pretty niche market, and majority of viewers still prefer the original Japanese dub due to how bad English dubs where back in the day. But now we have quality voice actors and production studios that have proven their abilities in producing quality dubs.

And lastly, I hate when series are released in 'parts' and not all at once. I know Sentai is probably under strict guidelines from the original Japanese producers on how and when they can release a series. But i'd almost rather wait an extra few months and get 1 complete set than have something released in 2 or more parts months away from each other.",1419724800,16,1502,4.411552346570397

Sentai Filmworks does A Bad Job For a Great Anime because Of The DVD,so We Pay  More Money For Part 2  Just To Complete The Series  plus no English Dub too",1408665600,3,353,3.942857142857143
6426413,4,B00KH57V2I,"Tada Banri moves to Tokyo to attend collage and escape his past. Yanagisawa Mitsuo chooses to attend the same collage instead of his parents first choice in order to escape his obsessive childhood friend, Kaga Koko. The two meet when they get lost on the way to orientation and immediately become friends. Unfortunately for both of them, their past is catching up.

When I started this show I had zero expectations. I wasn't really that interested in it, but I heard from a friend that it was supposed to be good and read one positive review, so I figured I should set aside my reservations and give it a shot. Im glad I did.

This show is really about the romance between Koko and Banri. It is sort of love at first sight for him, but for her it takes the development of friendship and *spoliery stuff* before she realizes that Banris willingness to accept her obsessive personality is really what she needs. Watching a relationship develop between a very strong willed person and a very mellow person is pretty entertaining.

But what fun would a simple romance be? Though Banri and Koko enjoy a fairly solid relationship, they are still young and unsure. But even better, there is amnesia and a high school sweetheart involved! Then there are their friends and their relationships. Unrequited love, broken hearts, and love triangles all enjoy appearances. Not that this show is all about love and tears. It has a healthy dose of comedy as well. All in all it is fairly well balanced.

I watched this show on Crunchyroll in Japanese. It is 24 episodes long and tells a complete story (no cliffhangers, probably no second season). This set contains the first 12 episodes.

PS If you are a Miss Monochrome fan, keep an eye for her, as she has cameos twice in the first half and once in the second.",1408665600,8,1797,4.620689655172414

8658592,5,B00KH57V2I,"This is one of the better romantic animes out there.  The art is very good and the plot is very nice.  The story is based on a boy with amnesia as he attends college.  he falls in love with a beautiful girl with some admittedly clinging issues.  the problem is that as his love life is escalating, his prior memories are starting to come back with his past love and the flashbacks make him forget his ""new"" life.  What will happen if his old life returns and he forgets everything else?",1466899200,,486,4.2967032967032965

8658595,4,B00KH57V2I,"Golden Time is an enjoyable watch, but has significant squandered potential.  ToraDora (same author/studio)  is an all time personal favorite for me and seeing this as its spiritual successor of sorts has colored my perspective.  It's been a while since I watched this, but I'll hit on what stuck with me.

Pros:
-Koko is shockingly likable.  She's obsessive to the point of being almost utterly unhinged, yet... somehow consistently enjoyable as a character.
-Linda/Koko dynamic.  One of the most pleasantly refreshing aspects of Koko's character is her regard for Linda.
-ToraDora association/nostalgia.

Cons:
-How they approached Banri's issues later in the series seemed a crippling choice of direction.  It detracted from the earnest drama and came off as jarringly out of place.  Which factored into the...
-Arguably botched finale (this is partly influenced by ToraDora's exceptional finish).

Overall I do recommend it fairly enthusiastically.  But after watching this, go buy ToraDora.",1439424000,,995,5.52317880794702
