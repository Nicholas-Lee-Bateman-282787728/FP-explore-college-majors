8076236,1,B000A8AX1I,"Once again, we are treated to a sloppily remastered public domain DVD set. This time, it is the Diamond Corporation/TGG Direct reissuing basically the same old thing that the other DVD companies did with many other previous editions regarding the episodes from the first and second seasons that had fallen into public domain. Likewise with those others, they simply replace that much loved theme song The Ballad Of Jed Clampett with the same old shoddily played banjo riff that the other companies who issued these same episodes that fell into public domain once their copyrights had expired. The show in itself is still wonderful, classic and still as funny as heck, but these sets leave so much to be desired.

One more time, I understand that The Ballad of Jed Clampett is protected under copyright. But this company could have simply asked to be loaned the copyright to that much loved and much familiar theme song. I know that it isn't that simple, but still, the copyright owner probably would have loaned it to them if they asked. It would have made the issues of these episodes more complete and for nostalgia reasons. It would have been much better if they could have had the original theme music.

One more time, if you want more remarkably remastered DVD sets of these first and second season episodes, then your best bet is to get MPI's The Beverly Hillbillies Ultimate Collection Volumes 1 & 2 and MPI's The Beverly Hillbillies/Petticoat Junction Ultimate Christmas Collection, which has the episodes digitally remastered using the original negatives, which are the property of the Paul Henning estate and are the only sets approved of by the Henning estate. Those sets are much better than any of these public domain DVD sets any day.",1326240000,,1748,4.882154882154882

8076239,3,B000A8AX1I,"Alpha has re-released these classic episodes of THE BEVERLY HILLBILLIES, which are amongst the many eps from Season One to somehow fall through the cracks into public domain.
