347354,5,6301696190,"This video contains another collection of classic Thomas episodes, from when the series was shot with live-action models, not computer animation.

This video contains some of the first Thomas stories ever filmed, and shows how Thomas acquired his Branch Line and Annie and Clarabel.

Narrated by former Beatle Ringo Starr

1. Thomas Gets Tricked -After Thomas teases Gordon about being lazy, Gordon decides to teach him a lesson by dragging him along with the Express.

2. Edward Helps Out -Edward helps Gordon when his freight train gets stuck on a hill.

3. Come Out Henry -When it begins to rain, Henry stops his train in a tunnel and refuses to come out, as he believes the rain may spoil his paint.

4. Henry To The Rescue -Henry is still in his tunnel and feeling very sorry for himself, but gladly jumps into action to pull the Express when Gordon has a break down.

5. A Big Day For Thomas -Thomas finally gets his chance to manage coaches all on his own -only to pull away accidentally leaving his entire train behind.

6. Trouble For Thomas -Thomas is eager to handle freight cars for the first time- and quickly learns what trouble they are when he loses control of his train.

7. Thomas Saves The Day -After Thomas bravely rushes to James's aid after an accident, Sir Topham Hatt rewards Thomas with his very own Branch Line and two coaches named Annie and Clarabel.",1348444800,,1378,4.637860082304527
347355,5,6301696190,"My young son was/is a HUGE Thomas the Tank Engine fan.  As he was growing up I purchased many of these VHS Tapes and later DVDs for him to watch.  It was my observation that he enjoyed hearing Ringo Star's voice as the narrator above all the others, and so, many videos were watched more repeatedly than others.

They are all fun to watch, with beautiful scenic backgrounds, and beautiful model trains.  The voices and scenarios are both fun and educational, and every episode comes with a lesson to be learned in it.  This particular video also came with a toy train that fit his collection, and could be used on the same wooden tracks.

While my son is older now - seven and no longer two or three (the pinnacle of his Thomas days), I still get nostalgic seeing these, and will occasionally put one into the DVD player when no one else is around.  Great fun for kids and parents alike.",1327536000,2,887,4.404907975460123
347356,5,6301696190,"I bought three of these older original Thomas stories for my niece's son so haven't actually seen them myself. However, my niece said that her son loves them and she thinks they are better than the newer ones she has bought. These are the original stories narrated by Ringo Starr that my son loved, age 21, along with my husband and I, quite a while ago. I think the words my niece used were more quaint and innocent than the newer stories. I think that they would be the best ones to introduce Thomas and his fellow engines to any child. Look for narration by Ringo Starr and next George Carlin. These are the earlier ones.",1300060800,,624,4.387931034482759

347391,4,6301696190,"Well, as far as graphics and animation goes, these movies are pretty crude. The only moving part id trains and a static wooden tiny pieces are used for everyone else including people. Except for the trains talking part the stories are short, simple and very realistic. Not all stories are good-feel, many-a-times stories have rather sad endings like a train ending in accident. The idea is to stress on the lesson learned from each short story.

Although can't complain much, as my 3 years old love to watch them!",1227312000,5,513,4.764044943820225

It introduces us to the first five characters: Thomas, Edward, Henry, Gordon, and James. I don't know about you but I don't like Percy and this is one of those rare ones where you don't have to see Percy at all. On a scale from 1 to 10, this one gets a 10 from me.",1095465600,2,382,3.848101265822785
347397,5,6301696190,"This was Thomas's first video ever. It establishes Thomas, Edward, Gordon, and Henry as characters they would be for the next ten years. Edward is a kind engine who likes to help people. Gordon's an express engine who loves pulling coaches and he hates pulling freight cars. Henry is a engine who doesn't like the rain but he is willing to do his work. Last but not least Thomas is a cheaky little engine who wants to see the world. In this video Henry gets stuck in a tunnel and he won't leave becasue it will spoil his lovely green paint with red stripes. He finally comes out to help Edward pull the express when Gordon can't. This tape also introduces James but he's not really in it until the last episode and he doesn't have a speaking part in that one. James learns a Lesson helps establish James in the next video.
