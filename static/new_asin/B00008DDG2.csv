The Disorient Express
-The Trans-Europe Super Express is transporting a racehorse from Italy to France. But the collected valuables of crime boss Don Marcino is also aboard that train. His true objective is to get his ill-gotten gains out of the country. Lupin's coming after that juicy target

Now Museum, Now you Don't
-A long-con that has been spanning years comes to a rocky spot as a master of ukiyo-e paintings had one more to go, but his failing health requires a new set of hands to make the swap. And Lupin's is just the right ones for the job

ZenigataCon
-It's a who's who con. Nobody is being themselves this time and it's confusion galore as there's four Zenigatas in Scotland Yard? Which is the real Zenigata and which one is Lupin?

Who's Vroomin Who?
-Lupin's entered himself in the Monaco Grand Prix, but there's just one little snag; A crooked casino swindled him out of his cash and his formula car. Now the only way to race is to be sponsored by the scheister who scammed him

The Sleight Before Christmas
-The gang is out to steal a priceless bottle of wine that used to belong to one Napoleon.

7981457,5,B00008DDG2,"As a huge fan of Maurice Le Blanc's orignal book series, I love all things Lupin. Lupin the 3rd has been my favorite anime since I first saw it in the 90's. Love this series!!!",1365379200,,176,4.057142857142857
7981458,5,B00008DDG2,"Classic show, the grand daddy of adult anime.  I first caught this on Adult Swim and loved it ever since.  The price is a bit unless you go with one of the other sellers but it is worth it.  I love how Zenigata chases Lupin in much the same way Wile E Coyote chases the Roadrunner!",1201219200,,281,3.982142857142857
7981459,4,B00008DDG2,I loved this show based in the comic books of Monkey Punch. It follows the adventures of master thief Lupin the Third nephew of the French Arsene Lupin and his gang composed by Goemon Ishikawa a master samurai and Deitsuke Jigen a cold blooded gunman. Sometimes joins to the band Fujiko Mine a bussom beautiful lady expert in conning and also thieving. Where the most valuable or expensive treasure or antique is Lupin the Third and his gang trying to rob it. The Dvd has 5 episodes that are in order as they originally broadcasted with the preview and even the commercials break. The series are well translated and the voices of the dubbers are quite similar to original japanese. The only flaw in this Dvd is that the English subtitles are the translation of the Japanese version not the English dubbed version. Sound and picture quality are more than average. I will wait for next volume.,1142467200,,891,4.681528662420382
7981460,5,B00008DDG2,It's So Funny. I Seen This Befor On Tv. And I Was Just Blown Away By It. Now My Friends And I Watch It. And It's So Cool. Lupin Is Our Favorite Character On The Show. So I Hope Everyone Buys This. You'll Be On The Edge Of Your Seat When You Watch This. And That's A Fact.,1128556800,,271,3.689655172413793
7981461,5,B00008DDG2,"Lupin the Third is the worlds most notorious gentleman thief along with his three cohorts Daisuke Jigen,Goemon Ishikawa,and the lovely Fujiko Mine Lupin travels the world stealing the worlds greatest treasures just think of him as the father of Carmen Sandiego. Lupin steals from anywhere and anything all while being pursued by inspector Zenigata of Interpol. With a charm and wit that makes James Bond look like a amature. It is a rather funny cartoon I was greatly impressed when I saw an episode on Adult Swim and I was hooked. This is pretty good considering it was done in the late 1960's. It is fun to see Lupin go around and steal things you wouldn't believe, with great one liners and a jazzy soundtrack to fit it nicely. It will surely steal your heart and not all the money in your wallet.",1091318400,,800,4.601398601398602
7981462,5,B00008DDG2,"Lupin is one of those series that never loses its charm.  This old time animation has a cast of characters that just make you laugh.  the dvd package itself is decent, not great but pretty good.  The cartoons are clear, voice acting is dead on and the menus are nice.  I give it 5 stars for the fact the studio did not screw this thing up, unlike other  series out there.  This is Lupin in the original glory, nudity, guns, violence, one liners all the stuff that made this show hilarious to begin with.  Even if you have never seen this show, pick it up just for laughs, believe me there are plenty of them to be had.",1055808000,4,618,4.186440677966102
7981463,5,B00008DDG2,"I've absolutely loved ""Lupin III"" ever since I first caught an episode on Adult Swim. Lupin is something like James Bond's goofy little brother. He can be suave, but he can also spaz-out if the situation calls for it. The dubbing in this series is great, in my opinion, though sometimes it's a bit anachronistic, i.e. the president of the U.S. looks like Jimmy Carter and yet sounds remarkably like Bill Clinton. The characters sound just as they should though, especially Lupin and Zenigata. Overall, it's simply a hoot.",1054857600,4,521,4.865168539325842
