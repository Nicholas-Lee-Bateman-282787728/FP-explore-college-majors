8366695,5,B00080ZG8S,"The onset of the ""street"" video craze is captured at its finest in this film.  Karlton Hines represented the glamour and the terror that drug dealing, street basketball and the New York underground breed as represented in today's popular music and film.  A strong Bronx native destine for fame on the court, who couldn't remove himself from the excitement that would eventually consume him, the Karlton Hines story is not one to miss.  Strap yourself in for a reality ride through the ghetto with what could be characterized as ""amazing and authentic accounts of a true life rise and fall drama"".",1122595200,2,596,4.881188118811881
