8255913,4,B0006VQO12,I've waited a long time for a copy of this video to surface.  Its not exactly what I thought it would be however if your a fan of Chrysler then its a must have for your video libary.  The Iacocca years have some never before seen footage which was very interesting to watch.  The picture quality was less than expected but I think my seller may have sold me a bootleg copy since the lables were generic with no copyright information.,1288569600,,433,4.320987654320987
