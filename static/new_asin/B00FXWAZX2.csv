6036943,4,B00FXWAZX2,"This movie was well-acted, and I can relate to addictions taking control of me, and having to learn ways to cope with them. I call this a dark romantic comedy. I like to feel good after watching a movie, and this film certainly does that for me. Alecia Moore (Pink) is the stand-out in this one - she adds a spark that otherwise would have made this movie a bit dull.",1388966400,2,367,4.183098591549296
6036944,4,B00FXWAZX2,I liked this movie but it isn't a comedy as the previews would have you think.  I would recommend it.,1388966400,,101,4.05
6036945,1,B00FXWAZX2,"The movie is well enough acted, but it basically ends up force feeding that sex addiction is a disease, which I don't think it is, and lumps all sexual behavior that isn't what some shrink decides is ""normal"" as a made up disease.  It is filled with some awful stereotypes and falsely linked cause and effect.  It feels like I watched one long PSA against the ills of sex and by telling tales of drug and alcohol addicts adjacent to the ""sex addicts"" weakly tries to give it credibility.  This felt full of the worst of modern medicine and psychology where anything a human does can and is labelled a disease to be treated.  Fail of a film.",1388966400,2,640,4.398305084745763
6036946,4,B00FXWAZX2,"""It's like trying to quit crack while the pipe is attached to your body."" Adam (Ruffalo), Mike (Robbins) and Neil (Gad) are all addicts that are trying to deal with their addictions. Things are going good for Adam until he meets a woman who finds out his secret. Mike encounters problems when his son returns home and Neil's life is crumbling around him because of his problem. This is billed as a romantic comedy but do not be fooled. I would not call this a comedy at all. The movie deals with very serious issues but the acting is the thing that really makes you feel for the characters. Very early on you start to root for everyone in the movie and you live their ups and downs with them. You almost find yourself talking to the screen and yelling NO at certain temptations that face them. This isn't really a movie I can describe you really should see this one to understand. Overall, a very good movie that deserves to be seen but do not expect a comedy. This is a straight drama that leaves you with a feeling you can't describe. I liked it. I give it a B+.",1388880000,34,1064,4.298507462686567
6036947,5,B00FXWAZX2,"My wife and I decided to see Thanks For Sharing having read a synopsis of the plot online. Although the film is listed as a comedy/drama (I have even see it called a romantic comedy) it is more serious drama.  (Spoilers follow) The subject of the film is sex addiction and the film's main focus is on three characters: Adam (Mark Ruffalo) who is a successful consultant, Mike (Tim Robbins) a small business owner who was addicted to alcohol and has a son who is addicted to pain killers and Neil (Josh Gad) who is a doctor.  Adam has been a sober sex addict for five years when he meets Phoebe (Gwyneth Paltrow) whom he falls in love with but can't find a way to tell her about his addiction. Mike's son Danny returns home having served time in jail and is welcomes by his mother (Joey Richardson) but not Mike who thinks his son weak in fighting his addiction. The comic relief in the film is provided by Neil who has some funny scenes pedaling around on a bike. Pink has an excellent supporting role as Dede, a hair stylist who needs help navigating from her sex addiction and finds a soul mate in Neil.  (end spoilers)

The film follows the three main characters as they succeed in controlling their addiction, falter and struggle to pull their lives back together. The screen play by director Stuart Blumberg takes a hard look at addition and living with the disease daily and how it can destroy relationships. The film has wonderful performances by all of the actors involved. Mark Ruffalo and Tim Robbins are especially excellent in their roles appearing pillars of strength but maintaining vulnerability as they face their addiction and help other overcome theirs. You care about all of the characters in the film and become involved in their lives, successes and failures. Thanks For Sharing is a film that should not be missed but I would categorize it as a drama that deals frankly with addiction.",1383004800,66,1907,4.633136094674557
6036948,3,B00FXWAZX2,"THANKS FOR SHARING is another in a long line of movies about addicts and the effects of the addiction on family & friends.  However, because alcohol and drug addiction has been presented over and over and overthis film is about sex addiction.  That adds an element of titillation that is missing from movies about alcoholics!

If my tone seems a bit dismissive, its because THANKS FOR SHARING is a very skin-deep movie that mostly pretends to have something deep or meaningful to say.  Its a breezy drama/comedy about a serious and damaging topic.  The movie is not without value or interestnot at all.  But I want to get out of the way right at the beginning that for all it accomplishes, one thing it does NOT do is really make me understand much about sex addiction.  As one character in the movie says (and Im paraphrasing): Is sex addiction a real thing?  I thought it was what husbands used as an excuse when they get caught cheating.  While Id like to think my attitude was a bit more understanding, this is a subject that is a bit fuzzy to me.  Drugs/alcohol I can comprehend.  An alcoholic drinking a lot is bad because they damage their health and do dangerous things.  A sex addict does WHAT exactly?

Anyway, THANKS FOR SHARING is more of a relationship movie.  We have our lead character, Mark Ruffalo, a recovering sex addict (5 years sober) who has spent a sexless existence with no home access to the internet, no TV and full of little tricks to help him focus on his sobriety.  Now hes interested in venturing into the dating world again, and he meets Gwyneth Paltrow, a cancer survivor who has been burned by previous relationships with addicts.  The two spend a lot of time smiling at each other and laughing at each others bad jokes and terrible repartee.  They MUST be in love, because if not, theyd find each other insufferable.  Both actors can be VERY charming, but somehow they don't work well together.  Ruffalo is much better in his NON Paltrow scenes, particularly towards the end, when his character takes a dramatic turn.

Tim Robbins plays the nominal leader of the support group.  An addict himself, he appears to be addicted to providing support.  He is full of pithy sayings and knows just the right times to put arms around shoulders in an encouraging way.  In many ways, he is deeply unlikable because he never really shows his real self.  Yes, he helps the addicts and thats a good thing.  But he is so smug and self-satisfied, with his self-loathing just beneath the surface.  He relates to the addicts because he is superior to them.  But his wife (Joely Richardson) is someone he can barely relate to because he carries the guilt over the horrible things hes done to her during his time of no sobriety.  We never get any specifics, but he clearly resents HER for the things she knows about him.  This relationship and Robbins character are far more interesting.  And when their adult son (Patrick Fugit) a drug addict and ex-con, comes home seemingly to make amends, some very difficult and bristly old business comes up.  Its a bit clich&eacute;d, all of itbut this portion of the movie has the most oomph.

For decent comic relief weve got Josh Gad (from Broadways BOOK OF MORMON) as a newly recovering addict and his growing friendship with fellow addict Alecia Moore (better known as the singer Pink).  They establish an easy rapport and Gad has nice comic timing and Moore is nearly his equal.  Their growing relationship, although a little hard to swallow, is also far more interesting than Ruffalo and Paltrow.

The trailers for this movie (and the poster) make it seem like this is a comedy, with some dramatic undertones.  That is HUGELY misleading.  The laughs are mild and infrequent.  Its more of a drama about some people who crack a lot of jokes.  It is never dull, even as most plot points play out so predictably.  Movies about addiction are a lot like sports moviesthe path is well-worn and familiar.  Sure, they may occasionally drift off to look at something different, but they always return to the path.  THANKS FOR SHARING is very much like that.  It felt familiar and comfortable, but a bit threadbare and well-worn too.  If a comfort drama about sex addicts sounds good, by all means check out the film.",1382313600,35,4267,4.662198391420912
6036949,4,B00FXWAZX2,"""Thanks For Sharing"" (2012 release; 112 min.) is billed as a comedy-drama, but really is mostly a drama about three guys in a 12 step program to deal with their sex addiction. Mike (played by Tim Robbins) is the 'elder statesman' of the group, who seems to have everything completely under control. Adam (played by Mark Ruffalo) is the middle-aged guy who's been on the wagon for 5 years, and now meets and falls for Phoebe (played by Gwyneth Paltrow). Then there is Neil (played by Josh Gad), a twenty-some loveable slob who is desperately trying to get on the wagon. He befriends Dede (played by Alecia Moore, a/k/a P!ink). Last but certainly not least there is Danny (played by Patrick Fugit), the 30 yr. old son of Mike and his wife, returning home unexpectedly after years away. To tell you more of the plot would ruin your viewing experience, you'll just have to see for yourself how it all plays out.

Couple of comments: this movie has gotten a lot of less than positive reviews by the so-called experts/film critics, and hence I went to see this with low expectations. As it turns out, this movie played out very nicely, in particular when staying away from the comedy aspects (which weren't all that funny), and instead focusing on the impact of addiction to lives and relationships. The performances were generally speaking pretty darn good, but for me the best work is done by P!nk, and even more so by Patrick Fugit, who you may remember as the wide-eyed teenager in Cameron Crowe's ""Almost Famous"" back in 2000. Fugit is now a man, and his role as the long-lost son is the most memorable in the movie for me. Please note that the movie has a great soundtrack, both as to the songs (featuring the Heavy, Elvis Costello, St. Vincent, and Family of the Year, just to name those) and the instrumental film score, and both of those are available here on Amazon.

""Thanks for Sharing"" opened on just 2 screens for all of Greater Cincinnati last month. The screening I saw this at was not well attended, and I'm being mild (three people, including myself), which did not bode well for its success on the big screen (in fact the movie disappeared after just a couple of weeks). But I wouldn't be surprised if this is one of those movies that finds a second life when the DVD is released. All that aside, don't be spooked by the so-called experts/film critics. ""Thanks For Sharing"" is a solid movie, and I would recommend you check it out, be it in the theatre if that still is possible or on DVD/Blu-ray.",1381968000,121,2510,4.575555555555556

6036958,5,B00FXWAZX2,"One of the most honest movies to date on the matter of sexual addiction. Depicts characters as real human beings, with actual challenges, and does not in the slightest make inappropriate fun of what this demon is actually like to live with. I can't sing enough praises about this movie. I was just flat our impressed. If the world took addiction as seriously as this movie does maybe we could move passed the stigma surrounding addiction, and mental illness.",1524960000,4,458,4.810126582278481
6036959,5,B00FXWAZX2,"Amazing movie. It's not a comedy in the laughing out loud sense. It's a comedy in the Greek or Shakespearean sense in that it's not tragic.

It is, however, heart wrenching. I highly recommend it.",1524787200,,196,4.6

6036963,3,B00FXWAZX2,"While this was an interesting film it certainly cannot be described as a comedy.  There were many serious scenes and I think it was a good story which explored the characters as they struggled with their addiction and supported each other on a daily, sometimes hourly, basis. It would have been a better film if someone other than Gwyneth Paltrow was cast for the role as Phoebe. All the other actors were perfectly cast and brought life to their characters. Paltrow lacked emotion and did little more than flip her hair and smile - she was simply unbelievable in this role and the film dragged when she was onscreen.",1523750400,2,617,4.660550458715596
6036964,5,B00FXWAZX2,I really liked it. We always hear about drug addiction but rarely about sex addiction. Sometimes we tend to forget there is such thing or we take it less serious than a drug addiction and this movie does a good job in showing how the life of a sex addict really is.,1523750400,,265,4.115384615384615

It reminded me that I like Mark Ruffalo as an actor, and hey -- Tim Robbins is back! One of the characters is rather horrifying and then endearing, and made me like the movie even more. But, there is some darkness, and it really is not a date night/rom com.

6036967,4,B00FXWAZX2,"An interesting movie portraying the path to recovery of people struggling with compulsive sexual behaviors. I appreciated that the addiction wasn't glamourized or to the contrary, downplayed in this movie but rather, the characters had very realistic struggles. The acting was good and the story as well, I'm just not a fan of all the nudity, even if it is a story heavy on the topic of sexuality.",1522108800,,397,4.852941176470588
6036968,4,B00FXWAZX2,I am surprised I watched it all the way through.  It was a subject that is not fun to watch.  A job well done showing the trials and tribulations involved in addiction.

6036969,3,B00FXWAZX2,"This had an all-star cast, and was well-acted (Pink has a natural talent), but I just get impatient with addict movies.  Too far out of my realm for me to find true empathy.

6036970,3,B00FXWAZX2,"The film showed the ups, downs, lies and trust issues that are wrapped up in addictions both in those who are addicted and those they are connected to. The characters were real and at different (fluid) stages with grappling with their addiction. I didn't like how they showed explicit sexual activity and nudity. The story could have been told without it, but it seemed like they were going for the in-your-face effect.",1521676800,,419,4.833333333333333
6036971,5,B00FXWAZX2,"Excellent movie about real folks fighting real problems. But also upbeat, uplifting in a real way. Fell in love with all the main characters.  You will love the interplay between the main couple.  Only wish there had been a longer ending. Maybe they want to make a tv series of it and that's why its not longer?

6036976,5,B00FXWAZX2,"This tragicomedy treats the imposing subject of addiction with a sweet sadness that points toward hope and redemption found in struggling together.  Beyond sex addiction, it takes us deeper into the nature of humanity.  Quickly and easily it depicts how we have splattered sexuality everywhere, cheapening and robbing sex, making it a mindless play toy or a placebo for unmet needs.  But more importantly, the movie reminds us--humorously and a bit sacrilegiously--that we all have personal challenges, some to the point of addiction and its life-robbing dysfunction.  We have addictions: fitness, food, gambling, alcohol, medication, work, affirmation, etc.  Unmet needs are painful.  And as a society, we rub salt in one anothers wounds, selfishly making life more difficult for one another. To the sex or food addict, everywhere he or she looks there is an invitation to indulge.  Everyone struggles.  Our world is imperfect because of us.  And we need each other to navigate the brokenness of our world.  Surprising to some, personal perfection is impossible, but in honesty and togetherness we can improve.  More movies like this can foster a sensitive and compassionate society.",1521244800,,1184,5.345945945945946

Great cast.  Great plot.

Someone talked about this being a dark comedy. Um.  No.  It is real life.  As time goes on and addiction is more of an epidemic, this is a reflection of how hard it is for everyone involved.

6037002,2,B00FXWAZX2,"Set Josh Gad and Pink aside for a second and there is nothing left worth watching. The preview was a bit lighter than the movie which was rather dark if delusionally optimistic.

All I could think is that society creates monsters and then punishes them. There is no cure for those with no self control except for self control. Anybody willing to throw the people's lives they love away for their own passions is without hope.

Self destruction in all its forms has but one answer, to be found in self control and giving yourself over to a cause worth surrendering your life for.",1519689600,2,578,4.548076923076923

6037006,5,B00FXWAZX2,"This very well written movie seemed like it wanted to be a lot of different things all at the same time. I do not think of this movie as a comedy, at all. Here is where for me the mood of the film is just way off; this is real life hard terrible stuff. Also, the whole sex addiction that is the major struggle is portrayed in a way similar to alcoholism and other addictions that follow the 12 step program. That is what makes this a quality relevant film for all of society today.

Alcoholism is rampant in this country and it seems like every day it just gets more and more popular to drink craft brews, special whiskeys, wine, wine and more wine.

I have struggled as a child of an alcoholic parent and also with my own addiction issues in the past, and found this movie to be accurate and very open and honest about ALL addictions. The books by Melody Beattie (sp?) have been total life savers for me. I used to carry her book, ""Codependent No More,"" with me every single day. She helped me so much!

I'm not familiar with sex addiction but I thought the characters showed the most important aspect of what consists of  addiction:
When it takes precedence over your life
You can't think about anything else
You have to have it regardless of the consequences

This is an excellent movie. I still felt the tone was too lackadaisical and out of whack. The best most real story was Tim Robbins, his wife and son. It was heartbreaking to watch. This is the true everyday horror that families all across America are dealing with. They got everything right on this whole scenario.

I like Mark Ruffalo and Gwyneth Paltrow but didn't think it was a very convincing performance by him. I thought Gwyneth Paltrow was more real and open than he was.

P!nk is Amazing :) She was really positive and trying hard in the program. Her character was like pure sunshine and forgiveness to Josh Gadd's totally hopeless character who I had next to zero sympathy for. Zero. And look what P!nk did. She gave him some light. Beautiful. That is true humanity.

This movie really makes you think about your life. It is excellent for introspection and personal inventory. It will keep you on your toes! I tried the Al-anon meetings a long time ago but felt they weren't for me because they made me more depressed about my childhood. They kept me mired in a tragic period that I needed to rise above. The meetings took away my own power and made me feel helpless and hopeless. Plus, I hate holding peoples hands. I hate it. Especially strangers! And I tried very very politely to say I have a phobia and don't want to hold hands or get hugs and people got mad at me. I tried to be Anonymous and they kept saying I wasn't anonymous they all ""knew exactly who I was"". The last straw was when the woman leading the meeting said to me in front of everyone, ""I know who you are. I took your mother's job."" My mom was dead from Breast Cancer. Nobody ""took"" my mother's job. She got sick. And she was very sick for a long time trying to just stay alive. And then she died. I got up and left that meeting and never went back. I didn't need that or them. And frankly it felt a little cult like to me.

I wouldn't even say this movie is specifically about sex addiction ( though to be fair, our society does bombard everyone all the time with images and lyrics and video's all about sex) this is something in today's world for any teen with a video camera phone and all of that ""sexting"" has got to be confusing. When I was little, watching ""The Facts of Life"" or ""Magnum P.I."", was considered risque.

This movie, ""Thanks For Sharing"", seems more about over coming addictions in general. And that is mostly why it's important for everyone, not just sex addicts.",1516752000,,3729,4.383502170767004

6037151,4,B00FXWAZX2,"The movie was in our experience sharp and well-done.

The IMDB (6.4) is so-so and the Rotten Tomatoes (49%) is unconscionable, Comments at the latter suggest total ignorance of how people might be damaged -- and, more importantly, how we change and are put back together again. That is flippin' odd considering that one of the characters in the movie who is ""not"" messed up kinda sorta finds out how that might actually not be the case.

Several elements of the actual work of movie really, well ... work. Focusing on sex addiction, e.g., focuses attention because 1) it's not the usual Alcoholics Anonymous thing and 2) some might start watching with an attitude of, ""Pfft. What's wrong with lots of sex with random people?""

Well, the movie says *this* is one thing that might be wrong, or rather three, since there are three couples in the story -- another technical point in the film's favor, as it does a pretty good juggling act therewith.

Heavy stuff. Worth the time.

As heavy stuff often is.

It's really more of a drama with some comic arcs to lighten the subject, which is addiction. (While the focal point for the principal characters is sex addiction, it reaches further than that.) There are some really strong performances in this movie, and some of the scenes are beautifully shot. And yes, the film starts off with a light comedic touch, but it spirals in to dark and heavy, leaving the ""comedy"" behind. After it's over you find yourself trying to remember the last scene or line you laughed at.

I am not perfect and I too have flaws that are habitual and embarrassing.

There are so many types of addiction.
This movie is about sex addiction, but also discusses other addictions, such as to alcohol, drugs, and food.
Different views on the seriousness of addiction are shown, with just a little bit of humor so that it is not depressing.
The story was very good and the acting was very good.
This movie was also full of hope.

SPOILER ALERT.

There was a really powerful scene that touched me.
Adam, a recovering sex addict, relapses and is about to have sex with a woman, Becky, whom he used to ""act out"" with. They get out of control, and Becky becomes hysterical. It becomes obvious that something was just triggered for her about past sexual abuse. She locks herself in the bathroom and overdoes on pills that she finds in Adam's medicine cabinet. That experience gets Adam back on track again.

There was another scene that touched me.
Neil is a sex addict, lying to everyone in the group, by saying that he is doing well in recovery.  The truth is that he just got fired for acting out at work.  He  breaks down and opens up in group, and says, ""I'm out of control. I'm scared.  And I need help.""  I could feel his pain and desperation.",1440201600,3,1214,4.4125560538116595

A story of struggle and perseverance from those who ""struggle"" and ""persevere."" So take your right shoe off and put it on your left, then take a walk around the room. Not so uncomfortable after it warms up, eh?!

Beneath it all, it doesn't matter what marks you bear or how big your cross is, every human feels similar emotions. Stress, anxiousness,  fear...it's all physiologically the same. What it is attributed to, related by, transposed upon, is what gives it negativity. Heights, public speaking and small spaces do the same things to people.

6037373,4,B00FXWAZX2,"Thanks for Sharing is a quirky, honest film about addiction and relapse. Though the vice in question is sex, not substances.  Mark Ruffalo's character is the centerpiece of the whole film, as a recovering sex addict with five years' sobriety behind him, thriving on his meticulously organized, ritualized life in which he's removed all of the obstacles to his recovery.  Of course, that would be quite an uneventful film, so a couple curveballs are thrown his way, and it makes for an entertaining ride.  I absolutely loved Gwyneth Paltrow's character Phoebe in this film, who was likable, self-deprecating, and real as a potential love interest to the main character.  The film takes awhile to hit its stride, and the graphic scenes in the first few minutes may turn some viewers off (much like in Don Jon, which actually mellowed out quite a bit in the end), but if you get through that, you're in for a very interesting movie filled with a lot of great dialogue.

6037448,4,B00FXWAZX2,"Although I've seen other good movies about sex addiction (Shame comes to mind off-hand), this movie deals with life in recovery, which I really appreciated.  As I was watching the film, it dawned on me how much we focus, as storytellers, on hitting bottom, as those stories tend to have more drama, and rarely do we focus on the challenges that we face as we recover and heal.  And these challenges can be great, albeit more subtle.

It wasn't the greatest movie I've ever seen, for numerous reasons, but I do think it's worth watching.  In my opinion, using an ensemble arrangement detracted from some of the storylines.  I could have seen each of them fleshed out more.  But I still cried at the end without realizing, so it definitely hit something in me.",1435363200,4,758,4.619402985074627

It was raw at times, but not gratuitously shocking.  I found it eye-opening; moving past judgment and stereotypes to peak beneath the surface of fallible humans.  I'll pretty much watch anything with Mark Ruffalo, and was not disappointed here.  Also really got into Pink's performance - she can hold her own among A-Lister's.

This movie may be about sex addiction but it really hits someone like myself that is a survivor of alcohol addiction of the worse kind.  I've been clean and sober for 25 years now and don't miss it.  I cried quite a few times during the course of this movie because of how the actors delivered their lines, the content of what they were saying... all very powerful to me.  The first catch in my throat was when Pink (Alisha Moore) gives her first speech in the group meeting.  That woman is so good at so many things, I'm such a fan but never realized she could act too.  WOW... blew me away.  There wasn't one poor performance in the whole movie. I highly recommend a watch.  There are some funny scenes but the over all tone of this movie was about addiction and how powerful it can be over someone suffering with it.  Go into this movie with an open heart and mind and while some may think it's stupid, you obviously DON'T understand addiction the way I do.  Thanks!",1429920000,4,1055,4.358974358974359

6037624,5,B00FXWAZX2,"First off, this is NOT a comedy. Let's just get that out of the way. That said, ""Thanks for Sharing"" is a well crafted and cast drama about a very difficult subject: sex addiction. I'd not heard of this film before having it show up in my ""comedy,"" recommendations, but I'm so glad I gave it a shot. Inter-personal relationships are complex enough when they don't act as triggers to addictions, but when the line between inter-relating and acting-out becomes blurred, things become very tricky. I've not seen this subject handled in a film in any serious way before, and for that, found this very refreshing. Sex addiction is one of those things that no one wants to talk about, and when they do, it quickly leads to joking. This makes it even more difficult for those dealing with sex addiction to feel comfortable opening up to loved ones about it. As Mark Ruffalo's character states in the film to a friend who has battled cancer, ""It's different...there's a stigma."" (There's no stigma to cancer?) ""Cancer gets you sympathy. My thing gets you judgment."" Well done film on many levels. Highly recommended.",1428451200,,1108,4.776041666666667

And otherwise nice folks will become deviant if they engage in it.  Extramarital sex is consistently portrayed as the equivalent of drug and alcohol addition - once one begins it takes total control of his or her life.  Oh, and by the way, masterbation is fully demonizing and addictive, too.  I found this to be more than a little too heavy-handed.  The title ""Thanks for sharing"" derives from Alcohol Anonymous therapy sessions when expressed as a form of appreciation to people reveal their personal weaknesses, sins, failures, and transgressions.",1426377600,,675,5.146788990825688

There is a reason the names of all 12 step programs contain the word ""Anonymous"" and this movie captures the reason for that well although far from perfect.  But then again this movie was made by people who understood that ""perfection"" is the domain of God's; for us mere mortals we must be happy with ""progress"".  If you're interested in recovering from an addiction or in learning more about the recovery process from an addiction, then this movie is ""must viewing"".

6037802,2,B00FXWAZX2,"We all love stories of addiction and recovery. And Hollywood loves giving them to us. It may have something to do with the prevalence of addiction. Many of us are dealing with addiction issues - either as addicts or friends and relatives of addicts. However, Hollywood does tend to run out of addictions. How many alcoholism movies do you want to watch? Heroin movies are fun but hard to make. No one wants to make a movie about hoarders. So this movie gives us the novelty of sex addiction.

Unfortunately, it doesn't deal with the myriad problems of sex addiction. First, it's hard to say if sex addiction is even a real addiction. Many of the self-described sex addicts come from religious upbringings that place masturbation in the same category as shooting heroin. I once read a biography of a ""wife of a sex addict"" and it was obvious that this woman was crying and bullying her husband because he looked at porn - not on a regular basis even - but one time was enough to make her crazy. If you take an online sex addiction quiz, you will find yourself answer questions like ""do you feel like you look at too much porn?"" and ""do you ever hide your sexual activity from others?"" The first question depends on the definition of ""too much"" while the latter question can only be answered in the negative by asexuals or exhibitionists. One is very tempted to assume that ""sex addiction counseling"" is in the same vein as gay-to-straight therapy - something that only applies to extreme rightwing religious types who have been brainwashed into believing that sexuality is dirty and wrong.

The movie does not necessarily address these objections. I understand that movies are not expected to cover all the bases, but beyond one question being asked by Gwynneth Paltrow that is dismissed with a grunt, no one raises the issue of how far is too far. In other words the movie relies on the actors to sell the addiction counseling. The movie does show that the Josh Gad and Pink characters are definitely hurting from their behavior, but the program seems more extreme than is healthy. The Mark Ruffalo and Tim Robbins characters are pushing a sex addiction program of almost total abstinence where there is no masturbation. Even when one character falls off the wagon, it feels like he's just acting normal.

I realizing I'm focusing on external factors when it comes to enjoying the movie itself, but the fact that I am asking these questions is a problem. If the movie was working, I wouldn't be wondering what was going on every few minutes. I wouldn't be questioning the emotional health of the recovering addicts. I wouldn't be wondering why Joshua Gad's character is not in a much more intensive therapy program since he has displayed much more predatory actions than the rest.

Unfortunately the overall tone of the movie is very prudish and it gives the extreme version of sex addiction counseling and that does not leave much room for nuance.

This prudishness extends to all the characters. The Tim Robbins character is a bully and a slave driver and yet he's the voice of reason. Mark Ruffalo and Gwyneth Paltrow have no chemistry so it doesn't seem like Ruffalo's character is struggling with his addiction. Josh Gad and Pink have the one story that has any sweetness or genuine feeling but they are obscured by the rest of the movie. Ultimately this movie is about characters that you want to see fall off the wagon.",1424304000,,3426,4.712854757929883

I realize that a movie about sex addicts is going to be a little dark at times, but it was billed as a comedy I just didn't find it all that funny, darkly or otherwise. I found it to be more emotionally draining than anything else. It didn't help that I didn't particularly like most of the characters. I outright despised Gwyneth Paltrow's character (and for the record I have no strong opinion about her as a person and I usually enjoy her in movies). The character is bitchy, unsympathetic and down right unlikable. Character's should have flaws but they also have to have something to root for as well. The scene that especially made me hate her was when strips in front of Mark Ruffalo's character and he asks her to please stop and she continues even though she knows he's an sex addict and he has told her that what she is doing is triggering for him. I will gives props to Pink, who actually proved to be a very good actor and to Josh Gad. Despite finding his character rather disgusting at the beginning of the film (and I think you're supposed to) their story and friendship is about the only compelling aspect of the film for me.

6037960,2,B00FXWAZX2,"I give this movie a lot of credit for bringing to light a realm of addiction which is often overlooked, or swept uncomfortably under the rug... however I found it disturbing in its finality and portrayal of a life in recovery.  This movie made these recovering addicts look hopeless, still compulsive, and always at arms length to their next relapse... how depressing.  None of them had healthy sustainable relationships - and were constantly falling back into their old coping mechanisms.  This is not what recovery in any anonymous group teaches -- there are people in recovery that really love life, give back, and have existences so far removed from addiction that their old selves pale in comparison to the light they give off sober.
Now I am not a sex addict, I am in recovery from alcohol, drugs, food, work, and neurotic patterns -- a third of my life dedicated to learning to thrive... and I love who I am and who I am with.
I had hoped that this movie expressed that for those that suffer with compulsive sex behaviors... and sadly it really didn't.  In fact it made them look doomed.  I do not believe that is not true.  I hope there will be more positive light shown on the recovery aspects of addiction rather than the glorification of being an addict.  I hope that there will be a movie that shows someone in recovery that moves beyond the chaos onto bigger and better things -- and not like ""Arthur"", who amazingly got it all together in 3 months.
This is a life long, yet daily, climb up and out, and beyond.  Not everyone relapses.  Not everyone is white knuckling their days.  There are people who truly change everything about themselves, love themselves, and have deep, meaningful relationships that last their whole existence.

Best to you all.

6037964,3,B00FXWAZX2,"Depressing and no laugh out loud moments (although they are trying constantly to be funny and cute). Let's face it, making a movie is an extremely difficult thing. It seemed to me that everyone in this film was trying very hard to do wonderful work. At the beginning my wife and I said to each other - we're not having fun. This was under romantic comedies and it was not fun to watch. But, we watched the whole thing - expecting something to bring it all together and make it better than we thought it was while watching it. We knew it had to kick in at some point and hook us. It didn't. It left us feeling hopeless. The writer of the story cares about the sexual addiction theme/message. They tried. The actors were good. The production quality was good - (except for the male actors makeup which was just distracting). The problem was they were all too self aware of doing a great job and it never seemed real. It never pulled us in. I think the marketing failed this movie. To put on the box ""Laugh Out Loud"" and file it under romantic comedy sets the viewer up for the wrong expectation and when it is not a LOL romantic comedy (although there could be funny moments if you thought they were funny and there was romance or at least flirting) - the viewer rates it more harshly than it deserves. This is a revised review. Our initial review was 1 star filled with frustrated words. The filmmaker is trying to do something serious in an off beat, funny, and romantic way. It never worked in this case. We didn't connect or really feel for any of the characters.",1418515200,,1565,4.363013698630137

6037987,4,B00FXWAZX2,"I really enjoyed this movie- probably because I work in behavioral health field and therefore appreciated the themes.  In particular,  the father/son recovery storyline was realistic and gripping. I also LOVED Alecia Moore in her role.  Not a straight up comedy, as some other raters have pointed out, but if you ever had anything to do with recovery and or mental health you might find and appreciate the dark, hidden humor in this movie.",1417910400,,439,4.905405405405405
6037988,5,B00FXWAZX2,"I agree with other reviewers that this movie would be better classified as a drama. I found it to be well written, and the acting very believable. The subject matter is daunting, and the story could have been depressing. As someone who was once married to a sex addict, I found that the story was realistic (considering the time constraints of a movie plot) and hopeful, while showing some of the angst and confusion that is inherent in this particular addiction. I'd recommend this one for anyone wanting to know more about addiction, and specifically sexual addiction. There aren't many films covering the topic, and this one manages to show the characters' pain, while still leaving their dignity in tact in the process.",1417824000,,723,4.8861788617886175

6038004,4,B00FXWAZX2,"Not everybody's cup of tea for sure. There are themes of not just sex addiction but addiction in general and some of the scenes get pretty intense and graphic. I don't know that you could do a movie of this subject matter and not have some of that in it. So if that kind of thing bothers or offends you, DO NOT WATCH.

I also really appreciated learning about sexual addiction because I had not really understood that it  was indeed another one (addiction). Very sad. Clearly, if it meets the criteria for addiction (something like it negatively affects your life, work/home, I'm not up on it), it can devastate your life, and it's an addiction. And it's hard to forgive or trust an addict. Like the heroine, I have a cardinal rule that I will absolutely not date an alcoholic.

It shows the struggles people need to overcome and yes, there are times you fall back.  However, it does show hope..

The humor is situational and gives you pause rather than a bunch of obvious setups and snarky one-liners at someone's expense. They didn't feel the need to make every character have a love plot, and they shied away from the predictable happy endings while still giving very satisfying and warm ones.

After working with sexual abuse victims for 20 years, it was very difficult to watch and would probably trigger many horrible memories for a sexual abuse victim.  Film makers need to watch what they put in movies.  They don't realize by advertising this as a comedy what could happen to men and women who are either addicted or sexually abused.  I won't watch it again.",1414195200,,636,4.478260869565218

6038323,2,B00FXWAZX2,"Before you watch this make sure you know it is pure drama, not a comedy in any way shape or form (don't be fooled by the laughing and joyful pictures on the cover).  This is a harsh look at dependence through the lens of sex addiction.  If you have a loved one/family member with any addiction this is a painful reminder of the tragic and devastating repercussions of addiction.  This movie has bitter scenes of self-destruction and demonstrates the blast radius effecting those around them.  Because it focuses on sex addiction there are some uncomfortable and almost pornographic scenes.  The actors are all good and this demoralizing movie might be interesting and educational for those not already touched by someone with addiction.",1412812800,2,736,5.0

6038334,4,B00FXWAZX2,"""Thanks for Sharing"" is billed as a romantic comedy, and the promo image features a ""Laugh Out Loud!"" quote. This movie is much deeper and darker than that, so adjust your expectations. Yes, it's a comedy in a broad sense, but fundamentally, it is an exploration of the question, ""How can you cope with addiction?"" I appreciated the mostly honest and unflinching treatment. The casting is top-notch. Mark Ruffalo, Tim Robbins, Pink, and Gwyneth Paltrow's characters are completely believable. There were false notes in Josh Gad's role...an embarrassing stereotype for the first third of the movie, but the script eventually allowed his role to become more consistent with the honesty of the film.

They had difficult roles and certainly had to use more technique playing characters who are primarily considered outcasts in society, even though in both cases, it was due to their upbringing.  Well done, for a low-budget movie which dealt with a behavioral problem which turns into addiction when people get away with it.  They make you feel like you are in reality with elements of hope.  You see strong points in these struggling individuals which even they did not realize they had in their characters.  The young doctor who exposes himself to the addiction group about his unusual sexual fantasy behavior which cost him his job, yet he connects with Phoebe (who is played by Pink) and Phoebe, who struggles herself, reached out to him as a friend.  The interactions of relationships results in a resiliance that makes you feel good about humanity itself, when people are encouraged to do the right thing.

The humor in this movie is off and on, but if you pay close attention  you can catch it all. Oddly, the best part I thought in the movie  was when Mark Ruffalo tries to have sex with Becky(stage name). I found it really disturbing how some people really suffer and even attempt to kill themselves from sex addition. Overall I rate this movie a 4 stars not because of the humor but more because the actual understanding on sex addition. It open my mind to a new world.",1411948800,,639,4.361344537815126

The demons that these characters have to deal with in day-to-day life really helps you reflect on your own life and the things that you do.  I don't think it was ""Laugh out Loud"" how the cover states, but it sure is something I would recommend to a select few for the depth of emotion it evokes and the friendships that can come from the most unlikely places.  It shows that even when you are at the bottom, there can be hope.
Also, I enjoyed that it showed a good light on Addiction groups.  They've got such a stigma and it shows that they don't have to be stuffy, awkward (unduly) and religious.  Just a ""higher power"" and help.  Which is what we all need in our own ways.",1411862400,,839,4.1419753086419755

6038425,4,B00FXWAZX2,"I was surprised by this movie, as the subject matter isn't exactly light-hearted and I like maybe two of the actors. It's really well-told and enjoyable. You'll get laughs, groans, and some sad moments, and you'll actually NOT come out feeling like you were in therapy. I do like Mark Ruffalo, and he has a stellar performance in this. I'm not a fan of Tim Robbins or Gwen Paltrow, and I still enjoyed them in this. In these roles, none of the actors seem like they're acting. The script is great, and everyone seems natural to the point of being themselves. Also, for anyone who's been through or knows someone who's been through a 12-step program, the utter reality of the portrayal alone is worth seeing the movie (so many flicks get it all wrong).

Likes:
 I loved the soundtrack, which imitated the brain patterns of an addict
 Josh Gad, who served as a great comic relief and delivered a solid performance
 The lovely Gwyneth Paltrow who surprised me with her talent

Dislikes:
 The dialogue was shaky/ awkward at times

6038600,3,B00FXWAZX2,"Amy Holmes had a poignant comment during Tiger Woods' sexcapades... considering he was married to a knockout model and this is a ""sex addiction"", then why wasn't he addicted to sex with his wife?

Because, in reality, this is not ""sex addiction"" as conventional wisdom has labeled it. If you were really addicted to sex alone, it would be adequate to have frequent sex in various forms with your partner. But usually the partners play NO PART in the acting out of the addiction.
Unfortunately, this movie, and popular culture, fail to recognize there is something more than just addiction to sex. It is sex and SOMETHING, and the sex is part of it, only because a person becomes so vulnerable during sex. What that SOMETHING is, I do not know for sure. Religious people would give it the old fashioned name of SIN... Secular people would give it a more avant garde name like SYNDROME.

An Alcoholic does not keep a bottle of booze at home that he ignores to go out and cheat with strange bottles of booze. A cocaine addict does not ignore his home stash to flirt with the cocaine at a bar. Yet a sex addict will ignore a beautiful and willing partner to risk his marriage and life to have sex with a complete stranger.

There is no such thing as a ""sex addict""... With the sex drive of a human male, we can ALL pretty much be labeled ""sex addicts"", just like we are ""oxygen addicts"", or ""water addicts""... the addiction is something else, and until that something else is identified, I don't see what purpose is served by pretending it is an addiction to ""sex"" alone.

That being said, the movie was nicely acted by the cast. But like the other reviews indicated, it had an identity crisis... is it a drama or a comedy? For me, perhaps it would have been better leaning more to the comedy, because it was too shallow a treatment of so-called sex addiction to be a drama... and that is where the movie failed to be a great movie, just an OK movie, despite a great acting job by the cast. If this had been done like ""Shallow Hal"", this would have been much much better.",1410048000,,2067,4.431578947368421
6038601,3,B00FXWAZX2,"This movie speaks to addiction, sexual addiction. which is just as destructive as the others we all know of. Be prepared for the story line to turn darker as it progresses. Why it is billed as a comedy is beyond us. It did reach a point where my wife and I turned it off.

6038659,5,B00FXWAZX2,"This movie was an accurate depiction of the recovery process from sex addiction.  Mark Ruffalo's and Gweneth's performances were beautiful and displayed the frustration between a recovering sex addict and a ""normal"" person with great accuracy.  The scene where she ""dresses up"" and dances for him, expressing her sexuality in a fun way, and the fear and anxiety that crosses his face are particularly telling of the difficulties of the recovering addict and his/her partner.  Imagine a recovering drug addict being offered a line, or an alcoholic being offered a drink.  Yet, unlike drugs and alcohol, and more like food, the recovering addict has to reconnect with sexuality that is non-compulsive and non-destructive and that is very difficult to do. Mark's character was effectively sexually ""anorexic"", as many of us are for the first 5 years or so. But total abstinence can lead to a binge/purge cycle which was portrayed in his ""slip"".  Of course Gweneth's character is hurt, confused, frustrated and angry, which is completely understandable, because she is relating to sex from a ""normal"" perspective.  I hate to use the word ""normal"", so let's just replace it with non-addictive, non-destructive.

It is very difficult for spouses and significant others to understand sex addiction. The hurt and betrayal that they feel is just part of the destructive path of this addiction.  Just like the chaos that drugs and alcohol can put loved ones through, sex addiction will also devastate a relationship. Unlike drugs and alcohol, there is an element of betrayal that is more intimate, more emotionally caustic, more at the center of the heart, so it can be difficult for the betrayed one to see the betrayer as an addict.  This is why it is so important to seek help from people trained in sex addiction in particular. A licensed CSAT therapist is a good place to start.  For the addict there is SAA.  For the partner, there are other resources. The best success rates are for couples to both be involved in the process of recovery.  Recovery is a difficult, challenging road.  But it can be an expansive, meaningful experience if walked together.  Fortunately, this subject is beginning to be treated with some clinical understanding and compassion.

I thought the movie was well done from the point of view of someone in recovery.  I don't feel qualified to judge it from a film making perspective, but I thought there were some pretty remarkable performances.  The only character that was a little out of place was the Doctor who lost his career because of deviant sexual behavior. The fact that he lost everything was not out of place, rather that is the norm for addicts and hopefully becomes the ""bottom"".  What was out of place was that the character was played for comic relief and I felt that unfortunately fed into making fun of the stereo type ""sex addict"" . But I get it, trying to bring some comic relief to an otherwise sad story.  Tim Robbins was great as usual and I thought Pink was very convincing. But it was Mark Ruffalo's performance that I completely connected with.",1409529600,,3091,4.8982725527831095

6038678,5,B00FXWAZX2,"I was pleasantly surprised by this film.  The film is about the recovery process of sex addicts and the movie hones in on four distinct characters.  The four characters all represent different types of addicts.

Mark Ruffalo plays a single professional guy who has been sober for five years and also has abstained from dating.  He takes us through the perils of dating as a recovering sex addict.  Opposite him is Gwyneth Paltrow who has to deal with the baggage that comes with dating a recovering sex addict.  The scenes and the conversations are so real, my heart was literally racing in some of the scenes (NOT because of the racy scenes) but because of the intensity the addiction brings to the relationship.  They have great chemistry and I love the rawness of the dialogue.

Tim Robbins is a family man with a prodigal son, who has not yet returned.  His story gives us an insight into the life of a family that is affected by addiction.  His son is played by Patrick Fugit and I was pleasantly surprised by his performance.  There's also Josh Gad who brings in both humor and vulnerability to the story.  His ways of acting out are downright perverted and added to that is his relationship with his controlling and clingy mother.  He experiences huge loss because of his addiction and it's really neat to see that process of tranformation on film.  Lastly, Pink represents the female sex addict and although a small role, she adds a great warmth to the whole story.

Just to add, I don't usually like movies with too much unnecessary steamy scenes (which most movies push to have) but I'd say the scenes in this movie were all very intentional and necessary in part of the story telling.

My personal take-away is that I gained a better understanding of the struggles of a sex addict.  To be perfectly frank, the idea of sex addiction used to gross me out.  I was one of the non-believers, but I have recently met some 'real' sex addicts who really want to get out but are struggling to.  The movie really helped me understand that this addiction is real and the effect it has on people's lives is a very sad story.",1409356800,5,2123,4.568783068783069

6038682,4,B00FXWAZX2,"Really not what I expected. All actors had great supporting roles. Tim Robbins as a recovering alcoholic who leads a sex recovery / mania group. ( not sure of proper classification ) Mark Rufalo  decides he need help and meets Gywn Paltrow, and decides it's not the right time to talk about his ""problem "" Although she's a exercise freak and enters every multi bike / run / swim  marathon  in the metro area and is close to perfect.
  Who was the guy who worked at the hospital and got fired for angeling  a hero camera up his supervisors skirt. I've known people like that. Maybe not as blatant. He goes into recovery and meets a very nice girl - o.k. not nice when we were first meet her, but she turns out to be a diamond in the rough.
  Added sub plot of Tim Robbins son, another recovering addict ?, who returns and builds the family a fish pond. Then prescription drugs disappear...

Three obsessive characters and the people around them make for an interesting movie. If it weren't for the boring scenes, I'd have given this movie five stars. Maybe next time I watch it, I'll understand it better, at which time, I might give it 5 stars.",1409184000,,759,4.6992481203007515
6038692,4,B00FXWAZX2,"Several addicts (but mainly sex addicts) live their lives with their illness and support each other through their support group.

Sounds like a simple plot. And it is. But you can see that it is anything but easy for these folks. I am glad that Hollywood (actually anyone in this country) is taking a real look at America's newest problem--sex/pornography. I find it an epidemic. Most just laugh it off. ""Sex is fun, right?"" But when you are consumed by your sexual cravings and it breaks your life it isn't ""fun"". It is a serious mental disorder. I actually feel it is a soul infecting disorder. I heard a radio promo last year on a station I regularly listen to about a seminar geared toward men in the local area. The promo starts out with several different women telling a man that he is ""such a great guy"" and ""one of the last good guys"" etc. But then the man's mental thoughts are read aloud where he is saying that he isn't ""good"". And if ""you only knew"" what I can't wait to watch and do in private. Etc. Then the promo goes into what the seminar is about. It encourages men who haven't been successful in stopping their sex/porn addiction on their own to come out and be with others who have and get help. Of course, as t his movie has shown women are just a big sex/porn addicts a men. Anyway it is as crippling as drug and alcohol addiction. More destructive actually, in some ways. Anyway, this movie does try to be serious but yet ""entertaining"". It strikes a pretty good balance. I feel that the horrible side effects of sex/porn addiction could have been highlighted to make people stand up and take note of how horrible this is. I mean learning that a man gave his wife a STD moves the moves in that direction. Seeing a guy sleeping with some woman who was obviously sexually abused as a kid and the woman breaking down mentally is an even bigger movement to spot lighting the problem with this illness. There is more and more horrific. Look at the Liam Neison movie ""Taken"", for example. Very gritty portrayl of the sex slavery/trade. But they at least tried here. I felt like they wanted to keep things a little light so not to scare people off, maybe. But showing how just walking down a street in America inundates you with sexual images was pretty revealing, I hope.",1409184000,,2287,4.445238095238095

6038718,4,B00FXWAZX2,"Stuart Blumberg, writer of the incredibly overrated THE KIDS ARE ALL RIGHT and the incredibly underrated THE GIRL NEXT DOOR, in his directorial debut, has crafted something pretty surprising. THANKS FOR SHARING is a dramedy about something that most people either take very seriously or don't believe is a real problem, which is sex addiction. We are introduced to three generations of men who are sex addicts who are in a support group together: The elder statesman and super-sponsor Mike (Tim Robbins) who has had his share of various addictions over the years; the up-and-comer and five years sober Adam (Mark Ruffalo), and the newbie Neil (Josh Gad) who is in a hell he can't get out of because he is refusing to do the work.

All three of these men have trigger points to deal with throughout the film; Mike's addict son Danny (Patrick Fugit) has returned after a years-long absence claiming he's clean; Adam falls hard for the beautiful Phoebe (Gwyneth Paltrow), a breast cancer survivor and a very sexual woman who, after a long relationship with an alcoholic, has sworn off addicts for good; Neil is a doctor who is addicted to rubbing up against attractive women on the subway, and is actually court-ordered to be in this group. All of them struggle, but only one can really start to claim success when newcomer Dede (Alecia Moore aka pop star Pink) comes into the group. Mike can't trust his son, but also can't forgive himself for what his addiction has done to his wife Katie (Joely Richardson). Adam and Phoebe, despite being seemingly perfect together, have serious issues with one another as far as trust is concerned as their relationship deepens. Neil befriends the wild child that Dede is, and they both end up helping each other in starting to overcome their addictions.

The film is a real step up from the ""affluent-white-people-with-problems"" that plagued THE KIDS ARE ALL RIGHT, although some of those do creep in. There is maybe once character of color in this whole film, and he's relegated to the sidelines. All of the characters are very well-to-do, which gives the film the opportunity to focus on their addictive tendencies, but still rings a little false that there is very little diversity in the cast and the characters. It's easier to overlook the flaws in this film, however, due to the super-strong performances given by Ruffalo, Robbins, Paltrow and particularly Gad and Moore, who really shine.

The film's direction is subtle and the script is smart to never demonize nor revel in the addictions of its characters, allowing us to make our own judgments and relate to the characters on a human level. This isn't like Steve McQueen's brilliant SHAME, which is rightly so all about how awful and overwhelming it is, but rather a film about how there is a light at the end of the tunnel for these characters. Moments of dark and light populate this film which is probably its greatest strength. It never sways too far one way or the other.

THANKS FOR SHARING is a film with some problems, but they are largely overcome by the strength of its cast and its characters.",1403136000,,3101,4.801498127340824

This helps to tell of the struggles of the addict,what drives and motivates them, the stressors that contribute to relapse the struggles with others to understand their addiction.  The movie also touches on the crossgenerational nature of addiction and that it runs in families.  The movie has heart, compassion, understanding.  It touches on how difficult it is for the family to trust the addict again.  Additionally it shows the fellowship of twelve-step programs and how important it is to be able to reach out to one another to help prevent relapse and to get support after relapse. I loved Pink in this movie. As a female sex addict she brought a lot to the movie.  She showed how difficult it was for her to relate to men and through the movie to be able to make a male friend and have him just be a friend. And yet when they were dancing with each other( both of them sex addicts)there was a moment when it looked like the disease was going to take over and then the recovery side won.

I thought it did a great job of making me like Mark Ruffalo (which I always do), even as a serious sex addict, and not get who he really was until he fell off the wagon.

It may be the best portrayal (spoiler alert) of a relapse I've ever seen, in terms of seeing so clearly the immediate and complete personality change/shift that happens to a person when they have been in sobriety and then relapse.

Obsession with sex gets old quick. Pervs don't make good quirky indie (wannabe)characters. This film tries so hard to be quirky and witty it comes off annoying and contrive. This film wants to come off funny but can't because of the serious subject matter, if it were funny at many points it would be offensive. If it was just dramatic it wouldn't sell. But this film tries to be both and fails pretty badly. Interesting idea turned really bad.

6038756,4,B00FXWAZX2,"I first read an overview on the Blu-ray cover while at our neighborhood's movie rental store which was all I had to go on for a writeup of the film.  Its description basically stated; 'Four obsessive people meet within a support group to set into motion a lifechanging journey. A very different kind of romantic comedy'.  With the former explanation along with a varied and interestingly cohesive cast; What's not to like?  Co-written and directed by Stuart Blumberg, I was a little confused in that the main focus of their obsession was sex, and they all were addicted in some fashion to some degree, sans Phoebe (Gwyneth Paltrow).  After my initial discovery, I found this film very interesting and very well acted throughout, exploring a world that I didn't really know very much about.  It offered an opportunity to find out a bit about it.  I also learned so much from the character of Dede (Alecia Moore - ""Pink""), being a lively, free spirited, and a much appreciated for her candor part of the cast.  She seemed to portray issues with a straight up style in the most relatable way for me to understand, as in the whats and whys. Alecia Moore is candid and we love her for it, she and Josh Gad really stole the show, at least for me.  Their leaning on each other was realistic and helped to show that we all need that special someone who just understands us for who we are and appreciates that fact.

Their support group (which is a part of the disc's description) apparently functions just as the well known twelve-step programs do.  The different participants have sponsors to aid them with working on their addictions, having similar issues to discuss.  Some have more than just one, including dual diagnoses of alcohol and narcotics abuse along with problems with sexual behaviors compounding all their struggles.  The head of the group is Mike (Tim Robbins), who has been involved with this for a long time and also is in a long-term marriage.  He and His wife, Katie (Joely Richardson), have a son, Danny (Patrick Fugit), who really triggers his ire when he returns home after being gone for so long while living with, then battling his own, drug addiction. I found that there would be a lot to focus on just in this family's dynamic alone.  Danny's father, Mike, runs the meetings while, unlike his Dad, he chose to white-knuckle it until he kicked his own habit. His father does not agree with his method and is not trusting of his son ... Yet.  Mike sponsors a couple of the men, but mainly Adam (Mark Ruffalo), who has been successful in abstaining from his personal obsessive behaviors for five years now by intentionally taking it one day at a time.  He will go to any and all lengths, even having televisions removed from the hotel rooms he may be staying in. He most certainly takes his sobriety as his first priority.  The third man focused on has just begun coming to the group and is quite far from being on the wagon as of yet. A young emergency room doctor, and loveable goofball, Neil (Josh Gad), has now gotten himself fired from his hard fought position due to his ill thought out behavior while at the hospital.  He is quite conflicted and seems unable to stick to any of the decisions he has made thus far.  At this point, his heart is not in it.

As I mentioned before, Dede is part of the group while acting out in a similar sexually addictive fashion.  She needs to, and certainly wants to, stop participating in these destructive behaviors in her life.  Just like Pink herself, Dede is unafraid, real, unpretentious and gritty.  She quickly finds a blossoming kinship in her ""Big Man"", Neil, and they become great friends as time goes by.  It is with her personal help that he is able to get healthy and stronger with her sincere urging.  Even more, their strong friendship is what they love about each other.  I admired how honest the two are with their issues, how they tackle them, and how one will guide the other down the right path in a relationship emergency.  This group is full of intense friendships and deep understanding of an addiction that people 'just don't talk about at parties'.  When someone is in dire straits, even if in the middle of the night, they take care of one another - they will always help.  I was continually impressed with their lack of taking a judgmental position towards anyone.

There does come a time when Adam is advised by Mike to try dating again after such a long length of sobriety and sticking to the program as well as he has.  With much trepidation, he meets Phoebe who has had issues concerning her own physical health. These two take a shot at a relationship, after telling a purposely silent Adam that 'she will not get involved with an addict ever again' because of happenings in her own past.  Like most movies of this kind which look deeply into the different aspects of human nature, there are some situations when the pots boil over, setbacks, and decisions that change the courses of a lifetime.  The cover of the Blu-ray that I read said, ""Laugh Out Loud Funny"".  I didn't get any of that from this, although there was a couple of comedic moments.  I actually found the movie to be a drama that gets quite heavy at times, definitely more thought provoking than funny, giving me somethings to ponder while opening the door to discussing addictions of all types and what they truly mean.",1394323200,6,5376,4.59958071278826

6038769,4,B00FXWAZX2,"One of the best things found in the world of movie lovers is a film that you expect nothing of but that offers so much that you are stunned by how well you like it. This is one of those movies. I had heard virtually nothing about this movie other than it was something Redbox chose to highlight as a pick of the week. If it played in theaters locally it wasn't for long. Too bad because even with the sensitive subject matter it deserved more viewers.

The story revolves around three men all involved in various stages of sex addiction. I know, you're probably laughing at the topic but the truth is it's a very serious addiction that more people are falling prey to these days. The reason why becomes obvious as the film opens to find Mark Ruffalo as Adam making his way to work and confronted with various displays of women half clad in billboard and poster ads plastered everywhere on the streets of New York. Adam is a successful at work but struggles with the daily confrontations. In spite of those he is 5 years ""sober"" which he brings up at the SA meeting he goes to.

We also meet Mike (Tim Robbins), a small business owner who remodels homes and who is also an addict. But Mike is more than just a sex addict, he's been through various other addictions as well like alcohol. The twelve step programs Mike has used to bring him back to reality have worked but also become his newest addiction. He is a support person for Adam as well as others in the group and more often than not lends his help to them more than he does his own family. The tension between Mike and his son Danny (Patrick Fugit) is palpable in part due to Danny's past problems with drugs and poor choices made when he was young. Where Mike might forgive his addictive friends he rarely thinks the best of Danny, now clean and sober and trying to make things right.

The third member of the trio lends the comedic aspects of the movie in an attempt to lighten things up a bit. Neil (Josh Gad) is a doctor who's been ordered to go to SA meetings after some incidents involving inappropriate behavior. But Neil isn't taking things seriously enough as we witness when he presses his body up against a lady on the subway. Adam is his sponsor but isn't willing to help him since he doesn't take it seriously. Events happen that force Neil to confront the person he has become and Adam, along with fellow SA member DeDe (Alecia Moore aka Pink), might actually make it out of this alive.

Along with these three characters and their stories we're introduced to a woman Adam meets and begins dating, Phoebe (Gwyneth Paltrow). Encouraged by Mike to start dating, he meets her at a party and they get along with ease. Once it looks like they might be doing well, she mentions to Adam that her last boyfriend was an alcoholic and her intentions of never being with another addict again. Rather than inform her then, Adam feels things are going so well he hides his problem only to be forced to confront this deception at a later date.

While this may seem like more information than you need just to watch the movie, it does offer just a glimpse of what is to come. It sets the stage for the drama and comedy that unfolds as we watch these three separate people deal with varying stages of the addiction they all suffer with. And while most would joke about the term sexual addiction you have to admit that the influence of sex in our lives has gone to extremes from movies to pop stars to commercials for Victoria's Secret airing during prime time. How could there not be a problem arises from all of this?

Each of the actors does a tremendous job of fleshing out their characters in the small amount of time they are given. While Ruffalo and Robbins might get the most attention it is Gad who does the best job of the three, showing that comedic side that attempts to disguise his addiction but eventually letting it all flow freely in his cry for help. While he offers the biggest surprise here Moore does a great job on her first outing in a major role as well.

If you're afraid of the touchy subject matter, that's understandable. But don't let it prevent you from watching some great performances as well as getting to hear a story told well.

6038778,5,B00FXWAZX2,"Stuart Blumberg is a director who takes chances (The Girl Next Door , The Kids Are All Right, Keeping the Faith). Using a screenplay he wrote in conjunction with actor Matt Winston he approaches a subject rarely touched upon (or even known about to the general public) - sex addiction - and with the very capable assistance of a superb cast of actors he brings it off. The film may disturb some, especially those easily offended by the degree of self indulgence that story addresses, but stay with this story to the end and be enlightened and touched by the triumph of the human spirit over seemingly insurmountable odds.

The story centers around three sex addicts who must attend 12 step meetings, have a sponsor, and refrain from onanism or frottage or viewing pornography, sharing their shortcomings at eh meetings of fellow addicts. Adam (Mark Ruffalo) is an environmental consultant whose has been `sober' for five years and has as his sponsor Mike (Tim Robbins), a small business owner married to the supportive Katie (Jowly Richardson) with whom he has a disowned alcoholic son Danny (Patrick Fugit), and who is sponsor to the obese foolhardy voyeuristic frottage obsessed ER Doc Neil (Josh Gad) whose mother Roberta (Carol Kane) has no clue about her son's debilitating condition. The three men - Adam, Mike, and Neil - interact in needy ways and each faces a crisis he must address: Adam finally meets a girl to whom he can possibly relate, breast cancer survivor Phoebe (Gwyneth Paltrow); Mike must deal with his son Danny's return to the nest; Neil becomes tied to Dede (Pink) who is a sex addict of the first order and desperate to change. It all works in at times confusing ways, but always with a focus on the fragility of the addicted human being - no matter the source of dependency.

The film has its light moments, but it is certainly more of a drama than a comedy - except for the fact that  `all of life in the human comedy.' It is good to see a capable group take on a controversial subject and deliver it well. Grady Harp, February 14",1392508800,10,2057,4.661157024793388

6038784,4,B00FXWAZX2,"This is a good story about people battling sex (and other) addictions. It sheds light on what is still a misunderstood addiction that is as potentially damaging to one's life and family, as drugs, alcohol, and other seemingly more serious addictions.

This is a drama/comedy, but there's more drama than comedy. It centers around main characters; Adam (Mark Ruffalo), Mike (Tim Robbins), and Neil (Josh Gad) and their various stages of recovery from sexual addiction. It is a multilayered story as it also shows us how their addictions and attempts at recovery affect their personal lives and relationships. Adam's new girlfriend (Paltrow) shows us a very realistic portrayal of how a single woman would react when she discovers Adam's addiction. At one point when Adam confesses that he is a sexual addict, she says something like, ""Isn't that what men say they have who just want to sleep around with a lot of women?"" which unfortunately, IS how many view this very real and very damaging addiction. Joely Richardson, who plays Katie, Robbin's long-time (and long suffering and patient) wife, does a great job playing a woman who has been through the ropes throughout a long marriage with a spouse who has had his ups and downs - with both sexual and alcohol addiction.

True to virtually all addictions; anyone can ""fall off the wagon"" at anytime no matter how long they've been ""clean"" or ""sober,"" and the movie does a good job of showing us this.

This is certainly a unique story and well played out, and therefore interesting and entertaining but there are some gritty moments (scenes) that are true to the nature of an addiction of this sort so if you're looking for a light hearted comedy, this is not the movie for you. However, if you're interested in a multilayered story about how addiction affects people in the real world - and how they cope (or not), then you will not be disappointed.

What I especially liked about this movie is that they also present a woman who is battling sex addiction (played quite well by singer, Pink) as many people assume that this is just a man's problem. Neil (Gad) gives a great performance as a young doctor who is just beginning to attempt recovery and yet at the same time, still holding on to  his self-destructive behaviors.",1391731200,,2276,4.78117048346056

This is a generally good movie with some good actors giving good performances.  Unfortunately the script is a bit suspect and the film moves back and forth between a serious drama about addiction and a romantic comedy.  Certainly, the movie was marketed as a romcom and even the jacket cover displays quotes like ""Laugh-Out-Loud-Funny"" and ""Romantic, Smart, Funny.""  And while there is romance and there is humor, for the most part, the film plays serious.

While no one chuckles about alcohol or drug addiction and the efforts to treat as diseases, sexual addiction is, let's face it, a bit harder to accept.  With Josh Gad playing a medical doctor named Neil (funny to even think about) with a sex addiction you can perhaps understand the misclassification.  The story centers around Adam (Mark Ruffalo), a businessman who is  5 years clear of sex (of any kind).  He regularly attends an AA meeting geared toward those similarly afflicted.  His sponsor is Mike (Tim Robbins), a recovering alcoholic.  His wife Katie (Joely Richardson) isn't clearly addicted to anything, but does keep a bottle of Percocet handy.

Adam has one of those cute meets-at-a-party involving Phoebe (Gwyneth Paltrow).  They end up going to lunch and get more and more serious.  Eventually Mike has to come clean on the sex addiction thing, although he doesn't spring it on her for some time in typical Hollywood fashion.  When these things happen in movies, we all know what the reaction will be.  Now while Phoebe isn't addicted to anything, she is compulsive about several things.  Her food for example.  No clashing colors touching.  Small portions.  Training for a triathlon.

Patrick Fugit plays the son of Mike and Katie.  They haven't seen him in years and yep, you guessed it, he's a drug addict.  All of these characters intermingle and add to the drama.  It gets to be a bit much and occasionally swerves into melodrama.  The performances are all very good including one by Alecia Moore, aka Pink, who plays one of the few female sex addicts in the movie.  For those looking for a more tradition romantic comedy, look elsewhere.

The Blu ray disc comes with a 1.78:1 aspect ratio and 1080p resolution and it looks very good.  While this digitally shot film isn't one of those eye-poppers we sometimes see, it is satisfying with good clarity and color accuracy.  The audio includes a DTS-HD Master Audio 5.1 track which much like the video isn't awe inspiring but very consistent, clear and directionally interesting.  Some of the best displays using the surrounds are in the several scenes in Manhattan, especially with the traffic.  Extras include a commentary track featuring director, Stuart Blumberg, a gag reel, some deleted scenes and a making of featurette called ""One Step at a Time.""

6038805,4,B00FXWAZX2,"If you have not read any reviews of this movie, I must start by saying I'm going to mention the topic, which was for me, a bit of a surprise. I had no idea what to expect from this movie. FAIR WARNING: the spoiler alert has been sounded. Read no further if you want to be surprised. Sex addiction is a byproduct of familial dysfunction (similar to substance abuse). For those who struggle with this addiction, they face daily challenges that many of us do not recognize. Kudos to the writers, director and actors in this film, who quite successfully raise awareness of what the struggle of sex addiction is for some. The behavior of the medical resident in the film (portrayed by Josh Gad), is true to life. I have personal experience in a biomedical setting in which a medical resident was apprehended in the library using a mirror to look-up female skirts. The addiction is real. The addiction crosses all social, ethnic, economic lines and boundaries. Does Mark Ruffalo ever turn-in a bad performance? Maybe. But I haven't seen one yet. The cast is so good and because of their talent, this addiction can come-out of the closet, into the light of day.  Dysfunction's products (various addictions) do not go away. There is no cure for any of the behaviors that are a result of this human condition. The best we have are strategies for providing daily comfort and solace which for some may require more than support or cognitive behavioral therapy, but with films like this one, perhaps the stigma of sex addiction will dissipate and folks can without shame, seek the help they desire.",1390521600,,1586,4.705035971223022
6038806,2,B00FXWAZX2,"One truly can become addicted to just about anything that offers any amount of pleasure or relief from pain.  The issue (for me - in this movie) is whether or not sex addiction is a disease; it is not.  Listening to them call it a disease over and over in this film actually made me angry because of all the people that actually have a legitimate disease due to no fault of their own.  Sure, repeated/obsessive behaviors can ""rewire"" brain synapses to an extent, but clinging to this is akin to throwing up your hands and telling the world that you're not responsible for anything.  It's a pity-party western world where there is no longer any right or wrong but somehow everyone's a victim.  And oh, by the way, eating bugs is all the rage... all the cool kids are doing it.  So go catch some grasshoppers and save the world.  To this I say, you first, Gwyneth - the actress famously quoted as saying she would rather die than allow her kids to eat Cup-a-Soup.  <sigh>
I found this movie neither funny nor poignant.  While not a horrible movie, it's just too preachy and whiny to be anything more than a mediocre drama filled with whinging from the insulated and over-indulged.

Read Pia Mellody's 'Facing Love Addiction', Susan Forward's 'Obsessive Love', Patrick Carnes 'Don't Call it Love'.
And look at 'Sex and Love Addicts Anonymous' pamphlet 'Anorexia' (Not about food) - about being 'starved' for healthy human connections.

Was just in the mood for a comedy, and believe me, this was not funny even though the reviews said it was a comedy.  I can't believe these actors would even consider acting in a movie this bad... totally disappointing.",1389571200,4,290,4.666666666666667

6038829,4,B00FXWAZX2,"this movie gives the general public a inside look at the real world of sex addiction, the struggles and victories with a addiction that destroys relationships ,peoples lives and is one of the most misunderstood addictions around.most people doubt the validity of the disease and discount it as a excuse for men or woman cheating on their  partners. But in reality it is a devastating sickness and compared to alcohol and drug addition one of the toughest if not impossible addictions to get under control. The damage left behind when the person finally attempts to understand and work on living with the disease, leaves all those involved devastated. And the understanding in that its a life long recovery process, requiring therapy ,meetings and help from other addicts. The movie touches on several points and puts a light hearted spin on something so real in the sexualized world we all live in. I hope it helps those not battling the disease a better understanding of a growing problem in our society.",1389312000,32,1005,4.911764705882353
6038830,4,B00FXWAZX2,"I'm not exactly sure what I thought this movie would be like, but I had a feeling that I would probably regret seeing it. I do not like movies about adiction, but maybe it's just drugs or alcohol that bothers me. Most movies that cover that subject matter are really depressing and I watch movies to be entertained. I actually didn't understand exactly what sexual addiction was so I was surprised by the content.
The acting was great and the story-line compelling. Give this movie a chance and you might find yourself saying ""Thanks for sharing this deeply moving story.""  It's absolutely NOT a comedy, by any stretch of the imagination, but it is an uplifting drama.",1389312000,,668,4.7094017094017095
6038831,4,B00FXWAZX2,"I knew nothing about this movie, so I watched it based on the cast list. It had some awkward moments, but as a long time member of 12 step recovery, I was very impressed with how truthfully the subject of addiction was enacted. The script was honest and exact in its depiction of the struggles that addicts (whatever their ""main drug"") have in changing obsessive behaviors and readjusting to life in the real world. I also appreciated the actors seriousness. They didn't slide into a mundane rehashing of ""addicts"" normally done in the media, but really seemed to grasp the characters they were asked to present with thoughtfulness. I more than liked this movie. It touched me in ways that so-called better movies about this subject have not. I also disagreed about it not being funny. I found some of the comic scenes very funny. I would recommend this movie to anyone who is interested in a good film about life on life's terms.",1389225600,11,930,4.676829268292683
6038832,5,B00FXWAZX2,"I work in the field of Sex Addiction.  This movie is a very accurate portrayal of the events and dynamics that go on with the addict, their spouses, partners and children.  There were one or two funny lines in it, but I would not classify it as a comedy.  It may be triggering for an identified Sex Addict to see this movie, but I think for spouses and partners who feel left out of the recovery process, it could be very enlightening.  Would be glad to address any questions regarding the Sex Addiction issue at insideout@insideoutcounseling.org.

Gwyneth Paltrow and Mark Ruffalo's characters bond very well.  I was excited to see those two performing together as this kind of movie is where they both shine.

6038836,5,B00FXWAZX2,"Being an addict myself this movie hits home for me because too many times I too didn't want to believe I had a problem until going to celebrate recovery and meeting other men and women with the same issues I have. The society we live in now FILLED with sex everywhere it's worse then pot, heroin, crack cocaine but we as a society don't want to bring it up because it's embarrassing and admitting that sex controls your life makes you feel ashamed, vulnerable to hatred, looked upon as a person with a contagious disease, outcast but getting help with this is no different then alcohol, drugs, depression the sooner you make a plan of action instead of keep on denying it you would be amazed to how better it feels to know your not alone and better things come into your life with help.",1388966400,2,786,4.427586206896552

8619330,5,B00FXWAZX2,"For the audience that believes in and practices the ideas of self-care and active self-improvement, I give 5 stars; otherwise, this is a 4 star movie in my opinion.

I'm not familiar with 12-step programs, though I know of them; I am familiar with groups, classes and workshops aimed around amplifying the healing power of a person by the healing powers of the group he or she is in.  And that is what this film captures, so for that 5 stars.

It was inspiring, with moments of poignant drama well acted, and also some really funny moments and great dialogue between the characters.  Very well done.

That said, I think the reviewers here have sold it short, probably because of the bent on the 12-step program, but if you read the title and plot, you know what you're getting.

My favorite lines which I've never heard before, but supposedly come from 12-steppers: ""Worry is just meditation on shit,"" and ""Feelings are like children. You don't want them driving the car but you also don't want to stuff them in the trunk.""

The cast is stellar and so is the writing.  For a free watch on Prime, this is a great 1 1/2 hours, well spent.",1531958400,,1136,4.507317073170731
