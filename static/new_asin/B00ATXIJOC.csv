I have been to Ayutthaya  to where the film was recorded and its just as you see in the movie.  The martial arts displayed in the movie of Muay Thai boxing has been told to me by Thai police as well as one Government official ,  that this is whats called Ancient Muay Thai and is not currently taught in modern Muay Thai for it is restricted to those guarding the Royal Family.

5509997,1,B00ATXIJOC,"When making a movie that deals at all with history I have one bit of advice, at least try. If not, then just set your useless plot in a modern city and run about without cause, like a Jackie Chan film. I shouldn't be too surprised that I would find a piss poor historical action flick in the film Yamada: The Samurai of Ayothaya, which is the wrong spelling. Or, as titled in it's U.S. Release, Mauy Thai Warrior, because Americans like simple words in their movie titles, otherwise we don't watch them.

 This film is based, and I use this word as loosely as allowed, on the life of Yamada Nagamasa. Nagamasa was a trader who lived in the early 1600's in a Japanese colony in the Kingdom of Ayutthaya( correct romanization ), in what is now modern day Thailand. He was part of the refugees who fled Japan after Tokugawa Ieyasu become Shogun. He rose in prominence with the royal court and obtained governorship over Nakhon Si Thammarat, a province that has maintained it's importance over the centuries. His historical importance is being a person in a long line of foreigners serving Thai kings. Many people from varying walks of life came to the ancient kingdom and decided to make it home. They served at all levels of society and were accepted. Nagamasa stands out due to his high rank. He is also famous for saying something along the lines that Thailand was the home of his heart, and while he came from different soil, it is this soil that will cover him in death. Nagamasa, the historical figure would make an interesting movie, no doubt. It's too bad that is not what the film makers did.

 Mauy Thai Warrior is a terrible film. The Nagamasa in this film, played by Seigi Ozeki, is apart of a mercenary group of Japanese exiles who serves the King of Ayutthaya. When he discovers that his boss is behind some murders and thefts the boss tries to kill Nagamasa, with a small hoard of ninja. This failed because Thai warriors from the King's personnel guard witness the fighting and go to help the underdog. These four Muay Thai experts mop up the ninjas and take the wounded Nagamasa back to their little village, which is also the capital city of Ayutthaya. There Nagamasa learns the ways of Thai people, and falls in love with the simple life they led as well as a young Thai mother, Jumpaa, played by Kanokkorn Jaicheun. Nagamasa also wishes to learn the fighting style of his saviors. They decide to teach this foreigner their ways and of course he becomes one of the best. Nagamasa becomes close to one warrior, Khaam, played by Thanawut Ketsaro. When Nagamasa feels he can complete his unfinished business with his ex-boss who is still hurting the interests of the Thai king, he goes at it alone. He challenges his former boss to a duel, which of course quickly turns into a fight against a horde of ninja, because Japanese ninja hide out in Thai jungles all the time. Khaam learns what he is doing and follows Nagamasa to help. The two end up facing the boss and Khaam is killed. Nagamasa in a rage kills his ex-boss, who I don't remember ever being named. Nagamasa goes back home, honors his friend by marrying his sister, who is Jumpaa, no loss there, and lives his life.

 The writing in this film is almost non-existent. It feels like there is no script and the director just had the actors say whatever they think their character should say. That may explain why so little is said to start with. The acting skills are so lacking I would not be surprised that the whole cast is an unimaginative lot and would find improv extremely difficult, if not down right impossible. The best acting came from the little girl who played Jumpaa's daughter. Whether to blame the script, the director, or the cast is truly pointless. They should all be ashamed. Another problem with this film is the back drop. It takes place in the once Capital of Ayutthaya, a wealthy and large city for it's time. Yet the film is shot in the modern ruins of the city. So, are you trying to tell us that it looked the same then as it does now, or that you didn't have enough money for a crappy CGI rendering?

 The pull of this movie was the athletes involved. There were four world renowned Muay Thai fighters portraying warriors in the film, but the actor playing Khaam wasn't one of them. Which I don't understand, because clearly acting skills were not important to the producers. So, a person would want to watch this film to see the martial art of Mauy Thai being practiced by masters. There are two kinds of Mauy Thai, one that westerns might be familiar with as kickboxing or just Thai boxing. It is a sport with rules and a point system. Then there is the ancient art of Mauy Thai, which is for combat. It is meant to defeat an opponent as quickly and as painfully as possible. Getting to see this form in action is rare, so that naturally became the selling point for the film. The problem is that the fight scenes are far and few between, unlike the long and painful scenes of village life in the modern ruins of Ayutthaya.

 The film can't decide if it is a historical film about an important person in Thai history or an action flick. Because it tried to accomplish both it accomplished neither. The film holds no dramatic content whatsoever and so little fight scenes with their Mauy Thai professionals that it can't even qualify as kung fu porn. If Mauy Thai was the point of this film it should've had a modern setting, like Ong-bak, then whatever poor acting and writing it showcased could be ignored for the rousing action scenes it produced in a chaotic modern metropolis. If the point was Nagamasa, then it should have focused on the real facts of his life and tried to tell a story of why a foreigner fell in love with Thailand and how they left their mark on the Kingdom. Instead, they just made a crappy movie which will be forgotten as quickly as anyone who watches it can achieve.",1380326400,,5895,4.506080449017774

5510011,3,B00ATXIJOC,"Apparently, 16th century Siam was quite a melting pot.  Japanese immigrants are hired as mercenaries for the good King Naresuan.  He wants to live in peace but King Nandhabureng of Hongsawdee keeps sending people to attack the village of Ayothaya.  The samurai known as Yamada Nagamasa (Seigi Ozeki) repels such an attack, only to discover that the assailants are Japanese disguised as Hongsawdee.  When he briefs his superior about it, the jerk responsible overhears and sends men after Yamada, who is saved when Kham (Thanawut Ketsaro) and a few other residents of Ayothaya use their superior Muay Thai skills to save him.  He is taken inside the peaceful village and nursed back to health by Kham's sister, Champa (Kanokkorn Jaicheun).  As he regains his strength, he is surprised how receptive everyone is to his presence.  No one seems to mind that he's not from their country.  When fully recovered, he decides to try his own martial arts skills against Sua (Buakaw Banchamek), best in the village and bodyguard to King Naresuan, who easily gives him quite the thrashing.  He then starts training with the Buddhist monk who trained Sua.  Will he gain the skills necessary to exact his revenge on the Japanese jerks or will the tranquility of Ayothaya wash away his bloodlust?

I can't say this was awesome but I definitely enjoyed it and had not heard of it before it fell into my lap.  It's based on a true story but little is actually known about Yamada.  Supposedly, the attacks on Ayothaya were carried out by Burmese immigrants but I recall no mention of this in the film.  So the movie could've been Japan vs Burma in Siam.  The story is not bad and definitely a cut above the norm for most Thai films I've seen, regardless of historical (in)accuracy.  Despite being a foreigner, Yamada did indeed become a guard for the King and eventually governor of the province of Nakhon Si Thammarat.  That no one in the village has a problem with the fact that he's not one of them was unexpected and extremely refreshing.  Usually, in most films, an outsider has to prove himself and earn the respect of whatever local culture he finds himself immersed in.  Ayothaya seems to be a kind of monastic village where peace & tolerance are emphasized.  Of course, the message of harmony is somewhat contradicted by the village's preemptive strike of bloody violence, which reminded me of ""Billy Jack"" (1971), except instead of hippies, there are male fighters, all with muscular physiques, short pants, Rollie Fingers-like mustaches, and pompadour haircuts.

The fights are simultaneously disappointing and cool.  There's really no fault with the actual choreography but goofy camera tricks (like undercranking and that annoying ""wavy"" look) and ridiculous amounts of CGI blood mar what might have been fantastic scenes of native martial arts.  I have seen at least half-a-dozen films that highlighted Muay Thai but I've never seen moves quite like this.  These dudes almost adopt a semi-standing/semi-fetal position before sudden bursts of fists, feet, knees, and elbows come flying in from every which way.  The fights are still interesting and well performed, except for Seigi Ozeki, who is otherwise fine, but appears noticeably slower than his Thai co-stars.

The unrated DVD from Epic/Mamagaap has good widescreen (16.9) picture quality with 5.1 surround and a running time of 102 minutes.  Spoken language is Thai/Japanese with subtitles only available in English.  I recommend this but with reservations.  At the very least, King Naresuan is the coolest monarch seen on film since Ernie Reyes, Jr. in 1993's ""Surf Ninjas"".  3.5 out of 5.

5510025,1,B00ATXIJOC,"Firsty, it was wise of them to rename The Samurai of Ayothaya to ""Muay Thai Warrior"" so that anyone who may have seen the film under its original name might not know better on this release.

Let's get this out of the way: It's pegged as an action film, which it's not. There's a couple of fights in the very beginning, then about 70 minutes of nothing. We have two battles near the climax. I've sat through movies like this before to be excited in the final act by some incredible stunts. Not here.

The action consists mainly of cgi hack-n-slashing to the point where I wondered if any of the stuntmen ever made it into the same room together for filming. The cgi was BAD as well. There were several impalements where you see the sword stick out of a guy's back complete with wound, and when the blade went away SO DID THE WOUND! Not to mention that 90% of the deaths occurred with the bad guys turning their backs on the camera to cut costs on cgi wounds! Awful, awful action direction!

Now that we've established it's not an action flick, and what action there was is basically watching a guy's back while cgi blood sprays side to side, let's discuss the story to see if it's worth watching.

Long story short, nope, not at all. The story is about a Japanese native who, after being betrayed by his countrymen, ends up being healed by the villagers of Ayothaya, and he falls in love with this new land and rises to defend it.

Nothing spectacular and it would be passable if not for one major problem: where most movies have themes behind the story and the dialogue, this movie turns the themes into literal mantras for the characters to CONSTANTLY spout out. It's almost as if for each scene the actors pulled a subject from that hat to repeat: 1. How it is good to die an honorable death. 2. How it is good to protect your country. 3. How you can be born one place, but truly live and die for another place. 4. How our Japanese hero and the Ayothaya warrior who saved him were like brothers now.

Over and over and over and over again the same dialogue, preached rather than spoken back and forth by all the characters.

Oh, and the little girl actress broke the fourth wall.

Ugh.",1365120000,,2187,4.369458128078818
5510026,3,B00ATXIJOC,"From director Nopporn Watin comes the martial arts action film ""Muay Thai Warrior"" (also known as ""Samurai Ayothaya"" or ""The Samurai of Ayothaya"").  A film loosely based on the Japanese adventurer Yamada Nagamasa, who became influential in the Ayutthaya Kingdom (a Siamese kingdom that existed from 1351 to 1767 and known for its foreign trade and Ayutthaya was one of the wealthiest cities in the East) in the 17th Century and would become the governor of the Nakhon Si Thammarat in southern Thailand.

The film ""Muay Thai Warrior"" was created to celebrate 124 years of Japan and Thailand relations and now the film will be released by Well Go USA on Blu-ray and DVD in March 2013.  The film would feature Japanese actor Seigi Ozeki (""The Odd Couple""), Sorapong Chatree (""Ong Bak 2 and 3, ""Beautiful Boxer""), Winai Kraibutr (""Bangkok Revenge"", ""Bang Rajan"") and K1 fighter Buakhao Paw Pramuk.

""Muay Thai Warrior"" takes place in the 17th century and a time when Thailand had a small Japanese community, many who were ronin (samurai warriors with no lord to serve) hired by  the Ayothaya as soldiers (because Ayutthaya was being invaded by other foreign invaders) and that foreign trade was popular between Thailand and Japan.  Among those working for King Ayothaya is a young soldier named Nagamasa Yamada (portrayed by Seigi Ozeki).

VIDEO:

""Muay Thai Warrior"" is presented in 1080p High Definition.  Picture quality for the most part is good as the areas of Siam are shown as a colorful area.  Beautiful scenic areas but on the otherside of this film is showcasing the brutality.  From people getting stabbed by swords and also showing blood flying everywhere, even towards the lens of the camera.  But for a martial arts film, picture quality for the most part is good.  Closeups are full of detail and black levels are nice and deep.  I did notice some areas where there was aliasing and artifacts.  But probably for one scene where things looked a bit messy.  But for the majority of the film, ""Muay Thai Warrior"" looked very good on Blu-ray.

AUDIO & SUBTITLES:

""Muay Thai Warrior"" is presented in Thai and Japanese 5.1 DTS-HD MA. Dialogue and musical score are crystal clear.  I didn't notice a lot of use of the surround channels during my viewing but for moreso for ambiance.

Subtitles are in English.

SPECIAL FEATURES:

""Muay Thai Warrior"" come with a theatrical trailer.

EXTRAS:

""Muay Thai Warrior"" comes with a slipcover.

JUDGMENT CALL:

When it comes to martial arts films such as ""Muay Thai Warrior"", those who enjoy films such as the ""Ong Bak"" will love the martial arts in the film.  The action sequences are pretty cool to watch and the fighting choreography was definitely impressive.

But when it comes to the actually story, it all comes down to the viewer.  For one, Nagamasa Yamada is a historical figure in Siam (Thailand) history.  Known for his trade activities, what we do know that in the kingdom of Ayuttthaya, around 1,500 Japanese lived in a community known as ""Ban Yipun"".  We know that many Japanese who converted to Christianity and also ronin samurai fled to Siam to avoid persecution from Toyotomi Hideyoshi and Tokugawa Ieyasu.  It was also known that the Thai King respected the Japanese colony because of their military expertise.  And Nagamasa Yamada became the head of the Japanese colony.  From the time he was in Siam to the time of his death, he was instrumental in creating trade relations between Thailand and Japan up to his death (in which he was killed in combat) in which Japan then went through a period of seclusion.

Interesting about Nagamasa Yamada is that you read the positive depictions of him in Siam but you dig a little bit more and you will also find out that he may have been a pirate in the seas who plundered Dutch Ships.  Rumors continue to persist that Yamada has buried his treasure in Australia.

Fact or fiction, Nagamasa Yamada is an intriguing character that connects Japan and Thailand and to celebrate their longtime relationship, why not a joint collaboration for a film.

In the film ""Muay Thai Warrior"", one should not watch the film as historical fact but to watch the film as a straight-up popcorn action film full of martial arts action scenes and awesome choreography.  The film does have its cute moments as Nagamasa Yamada is being tended to by a beautiful woman and her young (comical) niece.

But for those interested in the Muay Thai fighting genre will probably be interested in how the fighting is depicted in the film, especially the use of fighting and swordfighting.

In the aspect of martial arts, the fight choreography was impressive, the story was of course farfetched, but typically when it comes to Asian cinema about a historical character that involves martial arts, more often, you'll find that the films are 90-95% fiction.

But for a Thailand martial arts film, what I see in a film such as ""Muay Thai Warrior"" is an improvement in production and special effects.  But still, the original ""Ong-Bak: Muay Thai Warrior"" from 2003 still manages to be the film that other Muay Thai films will be compared to and its understandable as the first ""Ong Bak"" film, in my opinion, is still the best that I have seen so far.

As for the Blu-ray release, picture quality is good, with some areas that had artifacts and aliasing issues, but the majority of the film looked very good and lossless audio was clear and subtitles were easy to read.  I wish there were more special features other than the trailer.

Overall, some may feel that ""Muay Thai Warrior"" feels like ""The Last Samurai"" with Muay Thai but if you love Thai popcorn martial arts action films with cool fight choreography, ""Muay Thai Warrior"" is for you!",1364601600,11,5716,4.810450819672131
