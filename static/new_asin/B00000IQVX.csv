1227568,5,B00000IQVX,"Yet another masterpiece from John Hughes. I have always had a lot of respect for John Hughes and there are a number of films that I enjoyed. This film I have seen many times and I like it more every time I see it. It is pretty twisted and hard to predict, however it has a powerful story behind it. A story about mistakes and getting a second chance at making a new beginning!! If you haven't seen it, please do!! Allessandro Nivola is a great actor and he was wonderful in this film!!!
I highly recommend it!!!",1006387200,3,511,4.224489795918367
1227569,2,B00000IQVX,The characters were unlikeable and the set looked low budget.  The thing that stands out like a sore thumb was McEntire's soundtrack. It's too bad John McEntire and his click got stuck making music for such a dull nineties  flick.,942624000,3,230,4.725

7911292,5,B00000IQVX,"I like very much this DVD and find it excellent.  I like the way the Craig Hempsted explains all the details of each exercise, insisting so much on the safety. I think he is a very good instructor and a talented communicator.",1398556800,,225,4.357142857142857
7911293,4,B00000IQVX,"Wish it was available on DVD, like lots of people apparently... At first appears to be a mildly amusing movie, small town formula... bratty kid - although artfully passive aggressive, bumbling police dept. Well-meaning Sheriff confronted with an infuriating boy. The kid is so innocent that you KNOW he's guilty, but prove it... It works because it's set in a small town, none of the tricks would work if it wasn't, but getting away with it isn't the point. I did wonder why Robin was so determined to drive the Sheriff around the bend, yet he never looks hateful doing it. Sneaky, sneaky boy... and you want to think he's just immature, but that isn't quite it either... He obviously wants attention, *and badly* but why? Well, it's complicated. I will say that although he resembles a guy I thought was cute in highschool, none of the boys in my small town were that brilliantly warped... the character behind the mask makes the attractive young actor pretty hot. It isn't how he looks, but how he thinks. He's definitely settling some things, going through something, finding his way - his place. If you look into the snarky dialogue (again, WHY were none of the boys in my small town like him?) there is a depth and consideration to what he says with all his sarcasm and manipulation. I ended up liking the characters more than I would have thought. I really do think this is a good movie, providing you have the attention span to appreciate the journey, even with it's notes of overt spoof.",1369872000,,1495,4.645283018867924
7911294,5,B00000IQVX,"Le titre franais est ""Le Temps d'un Orage"" et le temps est suspendu, ce film est magique, le charme opre, il aurait pu tre une adaptation d'une nouvelle de Tennessee Williams...Je ne l'aime pas, je l'adore, ""que du bonheur !""

7911295,2,B00000IQVX,"Yes. He spends a lot of time exalting ballet as some form of ""superior"" dance technique. I take it he is neither well travelled nor enlightened otherwise he would know that ballet is just a different style and in no way superior or a ""grandmother"" to many more ancient practises that are still used today.

Like some other reviewers have pointed out, this is not a follow along video. If you have the time, watch the dvd through. Feel free to fast-forward a bit to get an idea then make some time to practice.

I must add something here: there is no ""mild"" contortionism anywhere in sight. This is just like many other ""extreme"" stretch dvds the likes of Stacey Neymour, Pavel Tsatsouline and Thomas Kurz. What do they and a MILLION other ""full body"" beginner stretching dvds have in common? 99% of the dvd contents are lower body stretches. That's right! Even full body programs don't realize that your back and shoulders should be stretched. The most you get is a warm up with roll downs and neck rolls and MAYBE a bridge but the actual stretching practise is ALL lower body! Yes, I would like to transform my lunges into splits but what if I want to transform my bridges into backbends or chest stands?!!

I only mention this since they claim to give advanced flexibility and this dvd claims to have mild contortionism and the last time I checked, contortionists are marked by what they can do with their backs/spines and shoulders. At the very least, dedicate a significant portion of the dvd to BASIC upper body stretches OR name your dvd appropriately- Reach: LOWER BODY Flexibility and Stretch! I wish all these instructors would take a pointer but doubtful.",1313884800,3,1665,4.675767918088737
7911296,4,B00000IQVX,"Just to clarify, this is not a workout dvd with routines to follow along with.

Video quality is fine for an instructional video (neither poor nor excellent) and looks like it was filmed on the stage of a church or small hotel.  Mainly you see the instructor sitting in a chair and explaining or demonstrating the moves and explaining (mostly the latter.)

Instructor demonstrates moves and gives pointers for three levels of stretching:  everyday, athletic, and extreme (these are my terms, not necessarily the ones in the video.)

The everyday stretches are for anyone and can be used if you are on a plane or at your desk.  Athletic is where splits and those types of stretches come in.  Extreme are those acrobatic moves that only the chosen few will aspire to.  The instructor was low key, engaging, and informative.

For myself, coming from a marital arts background, I wondered if dance approached stretching differently (instructor's background is listed as ballet and cirque) or if there are any other tips to be learned.  I enjoyed watching this and plan to try some of the moves he is demonstrating.

Only downside is that I wish the price were a little lower (nowdays workout dvds run around $15) . . . but specialty type videos are often priced a bit higher so it was not that shocking, either.",1286409600,10,1307,4.738938053097345
7911297,5,B00000IQVX,"wow this is a great stretch dvd. if you are working on really getting your range, well here it is.  don't try this with any previous pulls or tears.",1272758400,6,148,4.103448275862069
7911298,5,B00000IQVX,"This DVD is an excellent and simple to follow step-by-step guide through the fundamentals of flexibility and stretch offering a range of exercises from relieving stress in your neck, shoulders and legs, proper warm-up, improving your flexibility to mild contortionism. Very informative and well done.",1272067200,6,300,5.688888888888889
7911299,5,B00000IQVX,"This is a great DVD for those who are already flexible and those who want to be flexible. The instructor gives many great exercises of all levels, many of his stretches I have never seen before. He also gives a quick tutorial on improving ballet technique. Great DVD.",1258848000,10,267,4.583333333333333
7911300,2,B00000IQVX,"John Hughes must've been enamoured of the batch of naval-gazing indie/slacker dramas of the early-to-mid 90's when he made his own contribution to the nascent genre with this low-key affair. The most interesting element of it, is it seems a re-tooled version of a sequel of sorts to ""The Breakfast Club"", in that the story revolves around a John Bender-type of troublemaker--still stuck in a dead-end town, as well as the dead-end role of town outcast. Time has passed him by, and when Brooke Langton, in the surrogate Molly Ringwald role, shows up to let him know in no uncertain terms that the roughneck schtick no longer flies with her, we see this could have been how the Bender/Claire relationship was ultimately to have played out. Interesting as well, is the fact that the monied, North Shore suburb of Shermer seems to have fallen on hard times; no longer a comforting sea of green lawns, there's a pall of desperation that has been settled over it, and our hero's life as well. Hughes seems to have wanted to go deeper with the material this time, but it's pretty much a talky, stagy kitchen-sink drama that, like the main character, never charms the way Hughes used to. It's a compelling curio for the fact that A. It feels as if you're getting a glimpse of what ""Breakfast Club II"" might've looked like, and B. That it's probably Hughes' least known film (with the exception of his early 80's pirate film ""Nate and Hayes""...) It's
fascinating to see how Hughes was trying to connect again with the teen audience he had cultivated in the last decade, as they were now in their 20's, cynical and in a kind of existential funk. But what the movie does that is unforgivable, in the end, is that it casts a dark shadow over this sleepy little Rockwell-esque hamlet where zeroes could become heroes when they create their own woman, a geek could get a girl to lend him her panties, a clever little kid could hold down the fort and fight off burglars when he's suddenly left home alone, Duckie could get a date for the prom, Uncle Buck could make spectacularly large pancakes, and The Griswolds, Neil Page, and Dutch could return from disasterous road trips to find their idyllic little town a comforting refuge from the big bad outside world. Unless you were Mr. Rooney, of course. He would never rest until he was able to get one over on...BUELLER.....",1201996800,2,2358,4.657074340527578
