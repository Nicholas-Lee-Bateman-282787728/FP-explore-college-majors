The teen who watched it with me hates ""Hallmark"" style movies (I love them), but she really enjoyed this one.  :)",1374192000,3,274,4.42

4990779,4,B006IRQUMQ,I rented My Future Boyfriend because it seemed like it might be a pleasant movie to watch.  It is a nice fun story-not a great movie but an enjoyable watchable movie.  The premise was different and the plot unusual but it all added up to be a nice way to spend an evening watching this movie.  I purchased it because I have not seen it on TV and knew I would like to watch it again.,1356393600,8,382,4.0
4990780,3,B006IRQUMQ,"The concept behind this movie has a lot of potential. I love the idea of a time traveler meeting the love of his life in the past. However, this is a made-for-TV movie and it shows. The acting is doesn't convey any emotion at all - a problem for a love story. This is especially damaging because with such a far fetched plot, the emotion needs to be all the more real to convince viewers that the two are in love. However, what really drags this movie down is that it goes by way to quickly. It is about 1 hour 20 minutes, about average length for romantic comedies, but it seems like very little happens during that time. At least very little that's memorable. I guess I shouldn't expect to much. The movie certainly works as a date movie, but for such a cool idea for a romantic comedy it's too bad the director didn't get more out of it.",1344470400,,840,4.22360248447205
4990781,4,B006IRQUMQ,"So says Fred Willards's character, and indeed, one needs to let their brain go in this very lighthearted, short ABC Family Movie released by Gaiam.  Willard saves the day with his goofy presence in this slow starting, sit-com-like romantic comedy.

It begins with an excavation during the 32nd Century of an ancient site.  The hero finds a paperback, romance novel which mentions love, passion, lust, and sex- unknown, forbidden terms in his sanitary world.  With the help of his colleague(Willard), he travels back to our time to find the author and discover the meaning of love.  Catch is: he has only 48 hours to do it.

The author works as a journalist, and is, of course, soon to be engaged to a man that's not right for her.  She's given the assignment to interview and write a human interest story about this guy who claims to be from the future.  Yes, we know where this is headed.  There's fun and romance as the time traveler is a fish out of water and an innocent to our ways and the ways of love.

There's some cute and hilarious scenes that redeem this flick.  There's definitely not much meat on it, but that's OK.  Family friendly, but the kids will be bored.  It says PG-13 on this page, but I don't know why?  There's a drinking scene, and they say the word sex, but that's it.

Mildly amusing, Willard cracks me up.  3 1/2 stars.",1332028800,10,1347,4.481481481481482

4990797,4,B006IRQUMQ,"This is a made-for-TV movie that is set in New Orleans. The idea is that an excavation team 1000 years in the future discovers a romance novel from the past. In the idealized future, concepts like love and lust have been eradicated as viruses. A curious archaeologist decides to use a time machine to go into the past to meet the author and learn about love. The movie isn't too heavy on science so even though the scientific part of the plot is a bit tacky, it doesn't get overbearing. There are just enough interesting future-references and moments of chemistry between the main characters that the movie is watchable. It's definitely a low-budget movie that requires a lot of suspension of disbelief to get through, but it's fairly enjoyable for this kind of thing. You can kind of see the ""surprise"" ending coming from a mile away, but that's OK.",1430611200,,850,4.673333333333333

The movie isn't overtly bound to quantum-science worries, so, don't expect any rocket science.
There are interesting future-references. The main characters are enjoyable in their roles. It's a
low-budget movie that requires checking your brain WITH your coat before entering your home
cinema... but is better than MOST, attempts at fiction... with accurate science. The ""surprise""
ending doesn't just drop in your lap, but that's all right; I liked it!.",1463270400,2,723,5.464285714285714
