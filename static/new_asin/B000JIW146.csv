2670825,5,B000JIW146,"Over the years, I've done my best to see all films with Humphrey Bogart. The Return of Dr. X convinces me that Bogey either desperately needed the money or he lost a large wager.

Its hard to believe that this film was made only a few years before High Sierra and Casablanca. It's OK though, it's still Bogey.",1296345600,3,309,4.327586206896552
2670826,5,B000JIW146,This movie is priceless and unique. Who is greater than Bogart? What a rare role for him. I've seen this about 35 times over the years. So glad I found it on Amazon after years of hoping to see it again.,1253577600,4,203,3.975609756097561
2670827,3,B000JIW146,"First of all, kudos to the Hollywood Legends Of Horror series to make these DVD transfers so nice-looking.  Now, on to this two-disc DVD.

Doctor X  -  wow, what a shock - a 1932 color movie! Well, sort of......only two colors, but they look great. The two-strip Technicolor looked fantastic.  Immediately there is a street scene of green and brown that looks tremendous....and eerie. You would think that only black-and-white might make this look eerie, but not so - that combination of green and brown was very effective and made this a fascinating visual film. Hats off to the UCLA film restoration team, which made this 75-year-old film look really good.

As for the story, well, let's just say it doesn't measure up to the visuals. It starts off looking like a fun movie, even - surprise - a comedy as the newsman ""Lee Taylor"" (Lee Tracy) cracks a few corny jokes. However, it settles down into a crime story (more than horror) and we wind up with a whodunit and a room full of suspects, a la Charlie Chan or Sherlock Holmes.

The suspects are all scientists working in the Academy of Surgical Research. A bunch of recent hideous crimes by the ""Moon Killer"" were all done in the vicinity of the academy, so they're the prime suspects. Even the head man at the academy, ""Dr. Xavier,"" looks a bit suspicious. He is played well by Lionel Atwill.

The police give ""Dr. X"" 48 hours to find out if any of his employees are the killer before they totally take over the investigation and ruin the reputation of the scientific institution. All of the scientists, by the way, look and act creepy which adds to the mystery. Heck, they all could be serial killers.

After a long middle part which dragged, we finally see who the real killer is and that part is fun to watch and he transforms into a hideous monster-like man. I guess this why the film is called a horror film instead of a crime movie. I won't give the ending away but I admit, it's pretty good.

As for ""The Return Of Doctor X,""  it  really isn't a sequel to the 1932 film ""Doctor X."" Too bad....it might have been better had it been. Not that this is bad; it isn't, but isn't anything to write home about, either. Thankfully, it's only 62 minutes. Had this been 20 minutes longer, it would have been a yawner.

This, too, for a ""horror"" picture, this isn't much horror. Actually there is no horror, nothing in here that is going to frighten the most timid of souls. The only strange-looking person is Humphrey Bogart and all classic film buffs will do is laugh when they see ""Bogie"" in here. With a plastic-looking face and some weird hair coloring, you want to laugh out loud when you first see him.

Wayne Morris and Dennis Morgan are the real stars of the film. They are in almost every scene, with Morris as reporter ""Walter 'Wichita' Garrett"" and Morgan as ""Dr. Mike Rhodes."" John Litel plays a Dr. Frankenstein-type character in ""Dr. Flegg,"" a key member of this cast.

This movie is almost all talk until the 59-minute mark when ""Dr. X"" makes a run for it and gets involved in gunfire. Yet, it's never boring, either. The scenes move quickly from place to place and plays more like a crime film than anything else. Typical of early '30s crime movies, we get some corny humor from one of the characters, in this case from Morris.",1234224000,5,3295,4.50503355704698
2670828,3,B000JIW146,"This DVD set contains 2 films from Warner Brothers, two of a mere handful which they released in the 1930s in the horror genre. While the films share a common name, they are completely unrelated.

""Doctor X"" was released in 1932, an exciting story masterfully directed by Michael Curtiz and filmed in 2 strip technicolour. It tells of the investigation by a journalist of the moonlight murders whereby victims are killed and cannbalised by a full moon. Doctor X runs a research institute with as weird a collection of doctors as any horror film could want. The film moves to a climax at a gothic house by the ocean. The lighting is filled with sinister shadows. Lionel Atwill is riveting as Doctor X. The print has been restored by UCLA but a lot of white vertical lines appear and it is frequently hard to see what is happening. The 2 strip technicolour is more sepia, greens and browns, than colourful. The DVD comes with an interesting though verbose commentary. The commentator has his tongue firmly in cheek and he combines copious production information with pointed comments about the cornier aspects of the film. He is very entertaining. Also included is the trailer of the black and white version of the film which promotes it as much as a comedy as a thriller.

""The Return of Doctor X"" is another thing altogether. It is an assembly line B film released in 1939 with an astonishing Humphrey Bogart in the role of Doctor X. The story bears no relation to the earlier film other than the use of a nosey reporter and a theme relating to the creation of synthetic blood. In the earlier film, it was synthetic flesh. Typical of a B, the film moves quickly with holes in the plot and curtailed scenes. The climax is more like a gangster film. The print of the film is excellent and there is a commentary attached. The commentator nicely paces details about the film and it's evolution with an interview with the director, Vincent Sherman, who was 99 at the time. Sherman provides interesting information about working in the Warner Brother's factory.

The DVD set is OK value but will really only be of interest to fans of the horror genre who will want to see the earlier rare film.",1183334400,25,2188,4.634020618556701
8150484,5,B000JIW146,"""Doctor X"" is a very underrated horror movie of its time and is rarely seen on TV or sold in stores.

It was one of the first attempts at color filming using a Two-Strip method.  Also was the last movie to deal with taboo subjects (cannibalism & a minor nod to prostitution) before the infamous Hayes Code was enforced by Hollywood in the 30's.(movie is considered as 'pre-code').

Had seen the movie in B&W on local TV when I was growing up in the 70's, the color print had not been discovered at that time.  The monster in the lab scene was one of nightmares I remember as a kid.

Flash forward 20 years later, was able to buy the color print on VHS.  But always had wanted it on DVD.

This edition is the best that is out there for this movie on DVD.  Quality & sound are good.  As mentioned by another poster, the commentary is too much information at times to digest....oh well, at least the guy knows his stuff.

As for the companion film, ""The Return of..."", I was not really that impressed.  Not really a sequel to the original, the film is brief, plot is bland and the acting is uninspiring, especially for Humphrey Bogart.  But there are no other editions of ""Doctor X"" on the market solely in DVD, so in some way, consider yourself 'stuck' with this add-on film.

Still a worthy purchase, in my view.  Get this before there are no more editions available, and the only chance to see 'Dr. X' is possibly on TCM....whenever that will happen.",1486512000,,1450,4.382022471910112
8150485,5,B000JIW146,"I was a little disappointed that they colorized Doctor X, but not surprised as the cover shown it so. They probably did this to cover up the poor quality of the film. I'm not complaining. It's wonderful that the film was preserved at all.  The Return of Doctor X was great. Good b/w quality. Love those old movies.",1480636800,,314,4.413793103448276
8150486,1,B000JIW146,"The one I received of this individual dvd was a bootleg. In investigating how that could have happened, I found out that this was not actually released as an individual case, two film, single disc release. It was only available from the set with the other two discs. So, if you buy this, it might be from a set someone has broken up due to damage or loss of another disc, but, it might be a bootleg like the one I got. So, beyond the issue of whether you got a pressed disc version or an MOD dvd-r (as both were made officially), you have the issue of people making copies some of which are ending up here. I ended up paying far too much for the original set after receiving this particular disc and, while it was not worth the money, I'd rather have the original release than a lower quality copy.",1466035200,3,798,4.222222222222222

8150492,4,B000JIW146,"Although Universal was particularly famous for horror movies, it didn't have a lock on the genre, and during the 1930s most major studios took a crack at it.  Warner Bro.s was famous for gritty, slice-of-life melodramas and crime dramas, but the studio also created two of the greatest shockers of the decade.  Both DOCTOR X and MYSTERY OF THE WAX MUSEUM were popular tickets of the day, but while 1933's WAX MUSEUM remained famous over the years, the slightly earlier 1932 DOCTOR X was rarely seen or mentioned--even though it was probably the more innovative of the two.

Very, very loosely based on a mildly popular New York play, DOCTOR X finds reporter Lee Taylor (Lee Tracy) on the track of serial killer who first stabs his victims at the base of the brain and then cannibalizes the corpse.  The killer, known as the ""Moon Killer"" because he strikes during the full moon, is tracked to a medical research center headed by Dr. Xavier (Lionel Atwill), who works to unmask the killer through a bizarre experiment that forces the suspects to watch recreations of the crimes and then measures their reactions.  Ultimately, the killer goes after Xavier's daughter Joanne (Faye Wray), who is saved in the nick of time by the pesky reporter she has grown to love.

It may seem somewhat tame to us today, but in 1932 audiences hadn't been exposed to a glut of cinematic serial killers, and certainly not to serial killers that practiced cannibalism.  The very idea was gruesome beyond imagination--and it was backed by beating hearts, blood spattered lab coats, strange experimental devices, potential rape, burning bodies, synthetic flesh, and a particularly grotesque bit of make-up.  What's more, it was all in Technicolor.  The technique was still young and somewhat primative and tended to emphasize blue-greens and brown-golds, but this actually helped the tone of the film, giving it a darker, more mysterious tone than it might have otherwise had.  Although it may not be as famous as some, DOCTOR X is indeed a pre-code landmark, and any fan of 1930s horror should seek it out.

And then there is THE RETURN OF DOCTOR X, which has absolutely nothing to do with DOCTOR X.  The story concerns a reporter (Wayne Morris) and doctor (Dennis Morgan) who team up to uncover a killer known for draining the blood of his victims.  The role of the killer was originally written with Boris Karloff in mind, but when that didn't pan out Warner Bro.s crammed an extremely unwilling Humphrey Bogart into the zombie-like role.  Bogart despised the film and didn't mind saying to anyone who would listen, and indeed it is a very silly movie and Bogart is very silly in it.  THE RETURN OF DOCTOR X is watchable, and even amusing at times, but ultimately this is the sort of thing you watch in order to say you've seen it, nothing more.

Both films have been given a good transfer, and the elements are about as good as you can get.  DOCTOR X has a very nice audio commentary track by film historian Tom Weaver.  THE RETURN OF DOCTOR X has a commentary featuring historian Steve Haberman with no less than the film's director, Vincent Sherman, who was ninety-nine at the time the commentary was made.  It is interesting, but it is a bit too scripted for true enjoyment.

8150493,5,B000JIW146,"As other reviewers have pointed out, Dr. X is a little classic of 1932, filmed with a color experiment of the day, starring a first rate cast, led by the redoubtable Lee Tracy, and masterly direction by Michael Curtiz. It has chills, atmosphere and laughs, with no waste moments. A joy for any film buff and for most ordinary viewers who are willing to watch something in other than high tech.
Dr. X Returns is a B picture, made to fill out the requisite double feature programs initiated to draw an audience during the Great Depression. Forgive Wayne Morris, who leads the cast, since he was later to prove an authentic hero, as a Marine Air Ace in the Second World War. Humphrey Bogart is still paying his dues for his later stardom as is Dennis Morgan.  For a routine time-filler, it is OK, but not recommendable, fare.",1317513600,2,822,4.554054054054054
