7608163,5,B01ASMCH46,Love the DVD!  It is just the right pace.,1495152000,,41,3.5555555555555554
7608164,4,B01ASMCH46,I am very happy with this DVD as a self described advanced beginner. For me the Flow Yoga section goes a little too fast but I probably just need to practice it more often. The Core and Power sections are challenging but not intimidating or overwhelming. At my level the whole DVD gives me room to advance. Rodney Yee is a great instructor with a soothing calm voice. His instructions are clear and not distracting from the flow of the postures. It is basically broken down in to 3 20 minute sections that I usually do two at a time or combine with other DVD workouts. I only wish there was a 40 or 50 minute option so that you were not starting and stopping to get a longer workout.,1488067200,3,683,4.2615384615384615

7608166,4,B01ASMCH46,"Excellent dvd for intermediate yogis. I've been practicing at home for about two years, and this challenges me a bit (although I could definitely push myself farther). Rodney really does a bit of everything, and even challenges you to crow pose in two of the three workouts. I find the cardio workout to be the most challenging, due to its nature of a fast-paced flow practice. The power yoga is nothing to snooze at, either. The core isn't so bad; I feel he could have stepped it up, there. But overall, this is a solid addition to my collection. I would recommend this to anyone who wants a challenge. If you're a fan of Rodney's (which I am), you will not be disappointed.",1484006400,2,675,4.495934959349594
7608167,3,B01ASMCH46,"It's mostly flow yoga, just don't like it that much. I liked an old DVD for beginners much more.",1474329600,2,96,4.105263157894737
7608168,4,B01ASMCH46,"This DVDs summarizes many of Rodney Yee's yoga moves.  His fans will enjoy this video, although those looking for more variety or challenge may find it a bit old.",1469145600,,162,4.586206896551724

8748244,4,B01ASMCH46,I have many DVDs of yoga and of Rodney Eye.  This one with 3 workouts is very good.,1537142400,,83,3.611111111111111
8748245,1,B01ASMCH46,"I love everything Rodney Yee, but thse were horrible videos. I hated doing them. No nice scenery, and too clinical.",1530835200,,115,4.8
8748246,4,B01ASMCH46,Like it.,1530230400,,8,3.5
8748247,5,B01ASMCH46,"Love it, but will take time to get it, lol. My usual routine is Rodney Yee's 5 a.m. work outs; super chill,  nice way to wake up, or wind-down.
Best of yoga has much faster & challenging poses, super energizing!",1525392000,,211,4.275
8748248,5,B01ASMCH46,"I purchased one for myself as well as a friend. We now refer to him as ""our pal, Rodney."" The 20 minute sessions are perfect, especially the power yoga. I am a beginner and was easily able to follow along and enjoy. Additionally, because the flows are so logical, I can practice this even when I don't have the DVD.",1522454400,,315,4.266666666666667
8748249,4,B01ASMCH46,"Rodney Yee is probably my favorite yoga instructor.  When I first started practicing, I found his precision cueing to be extremely beneficial, and now that I'm a teacher myself, I value his instruction even more.  Admittedly, I don't usually enjoy his faster, vinyasa-style routines, but there are several of his DVDs that I love.  I was able to purchase this DVD deeply discounted, so I couldn't resist!

Best of Yoga offers three routines, each around 20 minutes:  Flow Yoga - Core Yoga - Power Yoga.  Each segment features Yee teaching alone via voiceover in an indoor studio space.  I have provided breakdowns for each below.

FLOW YOGA (23:59)
Yee mentions at the beginning of this that it is important to link the flow to the inner body.  Unfortunately, I found this difficult to do, as Yee moves VERY quickly through most of the moves.  He starts off more moderately with slow, modified sun salutations, but he quickly picks up the pace with jump switch lunges.  Yee moves through several fast flows, such as downward dog to triangle to warrior 2 to side angle and downward dog to one-leg dog (with balance) to half pigeon.  There are vinyasa flow transitions between virtually every sequence, and the sequences become more challenging, such as low crescent lunge to warrior 2 to revolved side angle.  Flow postures include cobbler's, bow pose, windshield wipers, simple twist, one-leg twist, one-leg forward bend, and cross-leg flying pose, but Yee returns to upright to come into crow, thunderbolt, and reverse table.  There is a short (about 1.5 minute) relaxation at the end, and then Yee concludes with a very brief seated meditation.  There is just too much packed into this short routine, and I didn't enjoy it.

CORE YOGA (18:27)
This was a nice routine in which Yee focuses on both stretching and strengthening the core muscles.  Yee begins lying on the back, arms stretched overhead for what he calls ""pond pose.""  He brings one knee for a situp with leg lower.  Next is happy baby pose, eventually moving into half happy baby with a situp.  After coming to a tight ball, Yee performs a double knee twist with hover.  This move is repeated, this time extending the bottom leg.  Returning to pond pose, Yee moves into a side situp with hold.  He then comes to seated for cobbler's, staff, and a seated one-leg extension holding the thigh.  He finished the seated work with simple cross-legged flying pose.  He then moves from plank to downward dog to standing, adding in a standing side bend.  Moving back through dog pose, gate pose follows.  The next series includes downward dog, triangle, and half-moon.  On the belly, Yee performs half locust and full locust, and then he moves back through downward dog to return to standing for powerful pose (chair) and three versions of a standing backbend.  Yee returns again to downward dog, this time for two versions of three-legged plank.  He finishes on the back with bridge, constructive rest, and a very brief (30 seconds) relaxation before concluded the practice seated.

POWER YOGA (19:37)
With the ""power"" title, I was braced for another super-fast practice, but instead, Yee emphasizes strength here.  He starts standing but transitions to a downward dog-plank series.  Yee remains on the floor for downward dog and modified side plank, eventually working up to full side plank.  Yee returns to standing for tree into warrior 3.  Thunderbolt (chair pose) appears between many of the standing moves.  At one point, Yee states that all of the postures performed so far are going to be repeated in a flow, but in the flow (which moves slowly), he adds new poses such as warrior 2, 1-legged downward dog, and pigeon pose.  From a seated position, Yee does a flow that includes staff pose, cobbler's pose, wide-legged forward bend, half boat, and boat pose.  He also moves from a cross legged flying pose to crow pose.  This routine has only a brief rest (about 30 seconds!), and Yee concludes seated.

Overall, I thought Yee provided a nice variety on this DVD.  I will probably mainly use the second two practices, but those who like fast flows might enjoy the first as well.  This is definitely NOT a DVD for those new to yoga or even beginners; Yee does little cueing (unusual for him!), so a significant amount of familiarity is required.",1517788800,,4308,4.845205479452055
8748250,4,B01ASMCH46,I like the 3 20-minute sessions,1517011200,2,31,4.333333333333333
8748251,5,B01ASMCH46,"I have purchased 5 of Rodney Yee's Yoga videos and definitely the right instructor to follow!
I deal with a lot of back pain and I'm now just starting to use his videos to rehab, strengthen and stretch my back!
The value is excellent!",1516924800,,234,4.340909090909091
8748252,5,B01ASMCH46,"I absolutely love this DVD, but it's not for beginners. There are three yoga workout sets:  flow yoga, core yoga, and strength yoga. Flow yoga is a bit more fast-paced and goes through a lot of mountain poses to forward bends to down dogs. Core yoga focuses on the abs. Strength yoga focuses on arms and back, so there is a lot of planks to pushups. I feel challenged by all three sets. I don't sweat a ton or anything, but I do feel like this DVD pushes me more than many of his other ones.

If you are looking for something more simple and slow, I'd recommend:
