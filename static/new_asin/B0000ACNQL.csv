7996779,5,B0000ACNQL,"I found this video very informative even for a man of my mature years. I cannot say I learnt much, but still found it very informative and not the least obtrusive. The video was easy to view and is a video you would have no fear in showing someone close to you, as it explained the facts of the information it was reviewing. I would have no hesitation in informing others that it is a video well worth obtaining, especially for younger married couples.",1140220800,4,452,4.392857142857143
7996780,1,B0000ACNQL,"I would just like to thank the Sinclair Institute for robbing me and the other 4 million people who bought their videos of our money.

I cannot believe that someone would produce something that is this terrible.

Let me save you some money.  This video reveals no ""SECRETS"" to sex and no ""AMAZING"" positions.  The Doctors that give the advice provide a lot of Medical Mumbo Jumbo.

Let me save you some money.  The video has bad actors filmed in a terrible setting.  It looks like a bad 70s adult flick.  Yes a 70s film.  Nothing from this millennium that's for sure.

As for an overall synopsis: Pay attention to your lover and try to satisfy them.  Try different places and positions for sex.  And oh yes, men and women love oral sex.  Come on Sinclair, everyone knows that.

Thanks but no thanks...",1111536000,60,801,4.510489510489511
7996781,1,B0000ACNQL,"I purchased the Better Sex Videos with my boyfriend because we were looking for something new for our relationship.  Well I purchased this DVD with their Sexual Positions For Lovers - Beyond the Missionary Position.

What a mistake.  When the DVD arrived I noticed that the couples are not attractive (turn off for both of us), the quality was terrible, and the information provided was basic information that everyone knows.  As for the positions, they are general positions that anyone knows.

This company claims that they have sold 4 million videos.  I wonder how many returns they have gotten out of those 4 million.

I would give this and the Sexual Positions For Lovers - Beyond the Missionary Position zero stars if I could.  Don't be fooled. Save your money.

If you are looking for a great sex position DVD, try: Sex Essentials Videos: Seductive Sex Positions.  Also another great DVD (for the females out there) is Female Masturbation : Every Woman's Orgasm is Unique.",1108252800,39,979,4.878787878787879
