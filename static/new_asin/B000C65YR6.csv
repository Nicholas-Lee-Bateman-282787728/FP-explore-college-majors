2453127,5,B000C65YR6,Great purchase.  Fast delivery and good service.  Recommended.,1407024000,,62,6.625
2453128,4,B000C65YR6,Its a good quality copy. I noticed in a review that the video appeared grainy to someone but it was fine to me. It hasn't been digitalized or anything like that but its good quality. These older movies do a lot more plot development and the people in them are more normal than what you see in more modern movies. Its easier to believe the actors and become more involved in these movies than most of what you see on the big screen today. The dialogue could be better but these are two movies you just can't go wrong with.,1393804800,,521,4.22
2453129,4,B000C65YR6,"The film is a classic Hackman film made during his Hey-day.  Unfortunately the quality of the recording was somewhat less than stellar, as if has been copied off a VHS tape.",1379462400,,173,4.580645161290323
2453130,4,B000C65YR6,"I bought this video because I had recently read the book ""The Domino Principle"" and wanted to see the movie.  As an added bonus, the movie ""March Or Die"" was included.  Both films were enjoyable to watch and I recommend them to anyone interested.  Gene Hackman has always been a favorite of mine and he didn't disapoint here.",1243123200,2,325,4.568965517241379
2453131,4,B000C65YR6,"This is a French Foreign Legion movie with some flavor, March or Die that is. Great scenic viewing, it looked realistic. Gene Hackman was great as always in the lead role. This movie can give the viewer an education on the charasmatic Moroccan leader Abd el-Krim and the Riff wars 1911-1927, they portray him as an honorable and noble yet brutal leader. March or Die can be used as somewhat of a history lesson for this period in world events. A decent buy for a two for one price even though production quality is lacking. The Wind and the Lion would be a good companion movie.",1236643200,2,578,4.462264150943396
2453132,4,B000C65YR6,"This review is of the second feature of this double feature disk 'March or Die' with Gene Hackman and Terrance Hill. A friend of mine mentioned that he saw this movie about 30 years ago when I was just a kid. I never saw it until just now. Let me start with a minor complaint. I do like these 'double feature' disks especially the ones that have movies that are not well known as both of these are. But I must say that they didn't put a lot in to producing this DVD. The copy quality is not all that great. It is definitely watchable but it looks like somebody copied it off of TV and then transfered it. That being said the thing that saved the movie is the great story and acting. I was throughly enthralled by this tail of the French Foreign Legion and I thought it was an excellent flick. The climactic battle scene reminded me a lot of the movie Zulu's final battle. And the build up to the last violent battle is done really well. Gene Hackman plays a very good tough as nails ramrod of a commanding officer and Terrance Hill is perfect in the role of the charismatic charmer who joins The Legion so as not to go to jail.

You may have issues with the production but I can't and don't have any problems with the film itself. I enjoyed it very much.",1190419200,18,1254,4.181818181818182
2453133,3,B000C65YR6,It is strange that MoD has never been released in its full form. IMDB will tell you what is missing. Without seeing this version I can only surmise that since it is P&S-F/S (per the previous reviewer) then it is unrestored. What a shame that a full battle scene (during the desert journey) and the full ending (won't spoil it) has never been released. I do not believe that even the Euro releases have these edits.,1138147200,16,414,4.4605263157894735
2453134,1,B000C65YR6,"I was so excited to see this on the rack of new releases at TOWER Records today...until I turned to the back cover to find...BOTH FILMS are presented PAN AND SCAN FULL SCREEN!  I urge fans of these films to boycott...aborted versions...these aren't saturday morning cartoons..we want the full aspect ratio as presented in the theatres!

If you are a film  buff..AVOID this edition.",1138060800,30,381,4.921875

8095834,4,B000C65YR6,"I like both of these movies a great deal. March or Die is a classic adventure film, and The Domino Principle is a wonderful paranoid political thriller on par with the Parallax View and similar films.",1493683200,,200,4.583333333333333
