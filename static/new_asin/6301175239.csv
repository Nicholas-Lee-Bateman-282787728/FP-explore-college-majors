319715,1,6301175239,"I recall watching this as a naive child. Watching it again as a middle-aged adult I found it creepy. The cheap chintzy animation is offensive to say the least and I can only wonder if this was produced south of the United States border. Also, Magoo dances in getting ready to play a stage version of A Christmas Carol stating outright that the play is a pretense and removing any suggestion of (moral) reality.  Pity. The cartoon has none of Dickens' wit or poetry and in essence is as bad as all the musicals.",1513900800,,510,4.425531914893617

319722,5,6301175239,"""Mr. Magoo's Christmas Carol"" is a classic holiday cartoon with heart. A friend told me this was his favorite Christmas Carol movie and I have to agree that it is a cartoon that evokes a wide variety of emotions and has a beautiful ending. What makes this especially endearing is all the musical numbers. There are scenes that are a bit scary like the graveyard with a flash of lightening. But mostly the ghosts are not as scary as in other movies. As you watch the transformation of a greedy man to giver you can't help but think this cartoon has affected many for good. There are also some funny parts like the spooking of the horse. So this is funny and a little scary and mostly just perfect.

It did a great job of presenting Dicken's timeless story of redemption of spirit, without it being quite a scary as some of the movie presentations. Mr. Magoo cartoons were well known to us in those days, and were one of Jim Backus's sources of fame (before GIlligan's Island).

This is a great show to introduce your younger kids to ""A Christmas Carol"", and in fact is the reason I bought it. We all watched it with out granddaughter and then presented it to her as a gift.

When I first saw this as a child my mother noted that it finally explained how Mr. Magoo could live the way he did.  He was an actor who was too vain to admit his age and wear glasses.

The backgrounds are limited animation and impressionistic.  They are nostalgic art.

Jim Backus, however, misreads ""nothing the world commends so much as wealth"" as ""nothing the world condemns so much as wealth"".  He should have put his glasses on.

Englishmen watching it may need an explanation for the nonsense words in the scene of the Cratchits' dinner.  It is a satire on the bewilderment of generations of American children trying to understand the terminology of 19th century English cuisine when was presented without explanatory notes.",1486771200,3,927,4.701863354037267

Backus had a dispute over his compensation for this work and the cartoon disappeared for decades. I saw a poorly duped version on YouTube a few years back a renewed my annual ritual, but was disappointed when YouTube removed it.

Fantastic Review here:

One other Thing.  I ordered this in November 2014, when it was $13.00 (and available) and it would seem Amazon ran out of it immediately after, and put it on Back-Order for me.  Amazon was very nice about it and apologized about not having enough for Christmas.

On the other hand, just before Christmas, and obviously caught-up in the overwhelming Christmas Spirit, ""Through The Stacks LLC"" started selling this at $199.99 - Just charging a tidy ""little"" profit on this, likely when they noticed Amazon wouldn't have it for Christmas.

Considering the basic heart of this fantastic Moral Play, I wonder if ""Through The Stacks LLC"" has much thought about the Irony of their actions...

I'm still waiting on mine from Amazon and I'm assuming it will eventually be available again.  In the meantime, I think it's good to know who the soulless After-Market Opportunists are.",1451174400,,1265,5.570680628272251
319966,5,6301175239,1962 Classic. Considered the first animated Christmas special. Was the first version of Christmas Carol I saw. Hews surprisingly close to source material.,1451001600,,154,5.739130434782608
319967,5,6301175239,"It's now Christmas Eve and I just finished watching this DVD. I saw the film on TV back in 1962 and ever since then I've been hooked on it. This film is truly a treasure. It ought to be in the Library of Congress if it already isn't. This DVD was put together very well. No scenes were cut out. As years went by it seemed every time they showed it on TV more of it was cut out to squeeze in more commercials. The last time I watched it on TV was around 1993. That's when they cut out the entire scene where Bell sings ""Winter Was Warm"". It was as if they ripped the heart out of it. Ever since then I've been watching it on home video players. The bonus material is superb with musical score playing while beautiful authentic preliminary sketches that were used in making it are shown. From an artistic standpoint I can't praise this film enough. The techniques used to create it were discontinued a long time ago. This was made back in the days when artist guilds labored to produce fine art that had heart and soul in it. Instead of creating a Disney-type animation that pays close attention to fine details these old school artists decided to focus on the overall composition and the feeling it evokes in the human spirit. They created this film using a pallet of only about 15 colors, the least amount of lines possible, well-loved popular voices of the times and a musical score that is absolutely wonderful. The result is a classic masterpiece of artistic expression that has withstood the test of time. Future generations will see this and appreciate what real artistry is. Unfortunately most of the artists involved in making ""Mr. Magoo's Christmas Carol"" are not around anymore. It is to them I dedicate this review.",1450915200,4,1725,4.514376996805112

319988,4,6301175239,"Just this morning the song where Tiny Tim keeps bringing the topic back to ""wazzlebewwy dwessing"" was kicking around in my mind. I think there's a recipe for ""Razzleberry Dressing"" somewhere online, specifying just what berries are to be used. Anyhow, I grabbed this DVD a couple of years ago here and couldn't help but notice that the sad ballad ""Winter Was Warm"" sung by Belle, young Scrooge's one-that-got-away girlfriend, seemed unfamiliar. Then I read other reviews on here (plus mention of this film in Wiki) that said that song had been cut from some broadcasts. The obvious reason seems to be time factors, but it strikes me that the song is unusually deep, not exactly consistent with the light tone of the other songs--indeed, the film as a whole. So if the broadcasts in question were aimed at a target audience of younger kids, the sappy ""love stuff"" wouldn't belong. For each exhibitor, it would depend on the market. But the song does fit in with the Dickens book, where an unnamed fiance from Scrooge's young manhood leaves him, explaining that he just didn't seem to love her as much as he did his profit margin. I can still recall the ""observer Scrooge"", brought from the future by the Ghost Of Christmas Past, raging unheard at his younger self; ""Go after her, you fool!"" As such, ""Winter Was Warm"" is more consistent with the later Albert Finney version ""Scrooge"", in which the same scene brought the after-the-fact lament by Scrooge; ""You...you were new to me"".",1446508800,2,1481,4.7890625
319989,5,6301175239,I couldn't wait to watch it.  The movie brought back many memories of growing up and watching it during the Christmas season.  Great quality and would recommend it to everyone.,1446249600,,176,4.833333333333333

320007,3,6301175239,"My first experience with the story of Dickens' ""A Christmas Carol"" when it appeared on TV in 1962, this version keeps remarkably close to the original story. Throw in some memorable songs by the Broadway team of Jule Styne and Bob Merrill (most famous for ""Funny Girl"") and you've got the first real animated Christmas classic. Great voice talent (Jim Backus as Magoo, of course, but also Jack Cassidy, June Foray and Paul Frees) makes it even better. The animation is the minimalistic, off-register style typical of the early sixties (think ""Rocky and Bullwinkle""), and the framing device of Magoo appearing in the play on Broadway is a bit lame and interferes a bit with the arc of the story. However, it really is much better than you might expect!",1441843200,,751,4.7846153846153845

320154,5,6301175239,"It's one of the first televised Christmas specials and, in my opinion (and that of many others), it's up there in the Alastair Sim/Reginald Owen canon of Christmas Carol presentations.

The frame to the whole thing, which isn't strictly necessary, is that the whole thing is being presented as a Broadway play. However, we're only reminded of this at the very beginning, at the ending (the cast takes bows), and when returning from the commercial breaks, when we're given an audience-eye view of the stage. Other than that, don't even bother worrying about how whatever you see is being presented on a stage, because the creators certainly aren't.

This version of ""A Christmas Carol"" hits all the highlights of the original story, although it kind of cuts the Ghost of Christmas Present a little short, in order to spend more time with Scrooge's past But in my head, this gives the viewer a better look at the forces that shaped the present-day Scrooge and allows him to see the places where he's made poor choices in life, something we lose in the Reginald Owen version. We also lose the entire subplot involving Scrooge's nephew Fred.

A scene that appeared in the original, but has been cut in the intervening years, involves Magoo being brought to a country home that turns out to be the home of a now-older Belle and the family she made after leaving Scrooge. This scene does NOT appear in this edition.

Given these changes--and a couple of other, minor ones--to the story, it's still remarkably faithful to Dickens' original story and dialogue, and isn't dumbed-down for the presumably younger audience that would have been watching this.",1420588800,3,1646,4.867857142857143

In my opinion, it is also the best. It's the songs that especially make it so memorable and, in the service of Dickens' immortal tale, always powerfully emotional. If you can watch it today, even as an adult, without once shedding a tear, then you're simply incapable of absorbing the proper Christmas spirit. I prefer the blu ray package, which includes both that version as well as the DVD edition presented here. It also features excerpts from a book about the making of the special (see it's special enough to have had a ""making of"" book written about it).

320236,5,6301175239,"This is a great version of the Christmas Carol. According to one survey a few years ago, Mr. Magoo was named as the best actor to play Scrooge by more respondents than any other actor. I tend to agree, though I do enjoy most versions of the Christmas Carol.

But on TV, it was 53 minutes. This DVD is advertised as being one hour, 18 minutes long. Is this a remake, or where did the extra 25 minutes come from. I hope people that know will add a comment to this review so that I can learn more.

Mr. Magoo's Christmas Carol was the second non-real-people holiday special that was ever created for television instead of the theaters. Only a 1953 marionette special, ""The Spirit of Christmas,"" is older than Mr. Magoo. Source: en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Spirit_of_Christmas_%28TV_program%29 (censor alert, this is not advertising)

This means that Magoo is the first animated holiday program ever produced specifically for television. It aired originally in December 1962 when I was 11 and my brother Dave was 9. He still remembers lieing on our green carpet watching it. The stop-motion Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer did not get aired until two years later.

I was very fortunate this year that the CW channel chose to air this animated special on Christmas Eve, 2014. The originally one hour program (53 minutes of original content) had 30 minutes of commercials this time to end up with an airing that started at 8 pm and ended at 9:23. The original 30 minute Merry Madagascar special finished out the two hour time block with 37 minutes total.

All of the content (that people complained was removed for earlier holiday reruns) was added back for the CW special.

BUT is this the 1962 version, or did they somehow do a remake that most reviewers don't realize? Perhaps the added time is to account for the length of the additional cartoon on the DVD, when Mr. Magoo babysits for the McBoingBoing character, who played Tiny Tim.

Some people complain about the animation. For its time, this was a wonderful program. Yes, 1962 animation is not as good as 2014 animation, but for its time, it is FIVE STAR animation.

The music is the type that will keep you humming it for days.

You'll want to go out and find some Razzleberry Dressing, and of course, Woofle Jelly Cake. I'm not sure if I'll try to bake them. I might be missing a few important ingredients.

Since this is a Christmas movie I can also get used to the fact that with the exception of the beginning and the end you see nothing of his nearsightedness. Mr Magoo is always funny.

320362,5,6301175239,"Jim Backus always had a way of putting a hard edge on Mr. Magoo's voice that let you know he was a no nonsense kind of guy who had retired from big business.  Mr. Magoo always reminded me of those retired successful businessmen who after having worked hard to make their millions then, fought hard to keep their millions and most importantly knew when to stand up with their hard won money and leave for care free retirement.  Mr. Magoo simply let himself go to truly enjoy retirement to the extreme.  Mr. Magoo was not hobbled by is cognitive and visual disabilities since from his perspective it was the rest of the world that was disabled, he was fine.  Mr. Magoo drives where he wants, does what he wants, says whatever comes to mind without thinking of its political correctness this is essentially who Mister Magoo is.

Mr. Magoo brings all his most hard edged cold big business conservative like values to the character of Scrooge and voiced by Jim Bacus Mr. Magoo is instantly believable as a tough, street wise, penny pinching old miser.  Mr. Magoo does not take easily to the lessons shown him as the three ghosts visit but subtly at first one see's his transformation start taking shape.  Of course when the final spirit visitor points to his grave the transformation completes with lightening speed as, the business Man Magoo see's the BOTTOM LINE of his previous life.  Mr. Magoo leaves his ghostly visitors a changed man and awakens to Christmas Day reborn. His body is still old as it had been but his spirit was renewed and no one epitomizes this transition batter than Jim Backus as his over the top treatment of Magoo's change is just right.  As a child MR. MAGOOS CHRISTMAS CAROL captured the spirit of Christmas for me.  As an adult MR. MAGOOS CHRISTMAS CAROL COLLECTORS EDITION BD/DVD COMBO [Blu-ray] reminds this old Magoo like man I've become to remember \ honor the better angels of my nature and live accordingly!  This is a great lesson and memory pleasantly presented for just a few dollars spent.

I'm autistic and my vision is terrible.  I've always been a total geek and nerd.  in my youth I wore glasses too,  When I was young people used to call me Mr. Magoo and at the time I felt extremely insulted.  Now that I am older, successful and I do what I want say what I feel and much of it not politically correct, I'm honored to be called Mr. Magoo.  Watching Mr. Magoo's Christmas Carol is a fun and funny affirmation for me.",1402012800,3,2456,4.5580865603644645

Well then you don't have to read any further open your wallet and don't look back because this is one of the most beloved Christmas specials of all time and it looks even better on Blu-Ray.
This has become a Christmas staple in our home over the last three years as we have watched it on Netflix and then on Prime.  The thought of it not being available drove me to find it on Amazon and low and behold there was a special edition on Blu-Ray (double Prizes).
This story is perfect for the family and is one of the more faithful animated specials to portray Charles Dickens characters.  Another interesting note is that this is considered to be the first animated TV Christmas special ever!  So pick it up now and then save it for the holiday season or if your like my third son then everyday is the day to watch Christmas movies!",1400025600,4,921,4.368421052631579

The unforgettably beautiful songs, some of them hilarious and some of them heartbreaking, are by Jule Styne and Bob Merrill (who also wrote the music for Funny Girl) and are brilliantly performed. Highly recommended.",1399680000,2,344,5.634615384615385
320377,5,6301175239,"Just as there are different DVD versions of the silent NOSFERATU vampire movie with the KINO DVD version being at least one of the best DVD copies of this old classic horror film with a great original composed music score, so there is more then one DVD version of this classic Christmas favorite! I only just found out that MAGOO'S CHRISTMAS CAROL was the first made for TV Christmas special and so it began a long list of Christmas favorites from Rankin Bass's RUDOLPH THE RED NOSED RHEINDEER, A CHARLIE BROWN CHRISTMAS, HOW THE GRINCH STOLE CHRISTMAS and so on and so on.

I recorded this special last year on to DVD with my DVD recorder off an NBC broadcast. But when I played it back I was dissapointed because all the min. of Mr. Magoo driving his car to Broadway to play his Scrooge role in a theater and the gags showing his near sightedness messing up the play's directer were cut out! This has been an increasing problem when modern TV show old programs that come from a time when there were much less commercials! Even the SIMPSONS have been a victim of this when episodes of that series are rerun in the early evening on FOX network! THE SIMPSONS started out with episodes that were 24 min. long without the commercials. But as the ads increased the episodes decreased in length to 21 min. So the older episodes were edited down for increased advertising! So it's only on DVD sets that you get all the episodes uncut!

When I spotted the MAGOO CHRISTMAS CAROL on DVD on TCM SHOP website I thought I would get it uncut, but TCM admitted that their recording was missing the Broadway framing that showed Magoo was performing a Broadway play! TCM said,"" There are no existing versions showing this framing device!"" But wait, when I discovered the same special title was advertised on amazon.com I discovered that another MAGOO CHRISTMAS CAROL DVD with a different cover and a longer running time exists! It's a 2004 DVD release sold by sellers on the amazon site that IS NOT the 2011 edited down release! This dvd 1 disc set has a scowling, angry Magoo as Scrooge on the cover in close up with the Cratchet family shown below him. This older DVD has the complete U.P.A. special with the Broadway gags and a remastered picture with vibrant colour! The cover also says the special is 60 min. long. The  edited Dvd cover says 52 min. long!

There's also a Magoo cartoon short with Magoo meeting Gerald Mc Boing Boing. And Gerald is back to his talking with just sound effects! It's as Tiny Tim that Gerald actually spoke in english! The U.P.A. team must have thought of the cartoon short: STAGE DOOR MAGOO which showed Magoo performing in a stage opera for the theater background of MAGOO'S CHRISTMAS CAROL. (See my review of MAGOO'S THEATRICAL SHORTS on amazon.com) Anyway getting this dvd was very satisfying and nostalgic! The remastered colour brings out the bright, vivid colour textures in the 2D backrounds that became a trademark of U.P.A 's modern art design and it shows their ability to be able to say a lot visually with very little detail!

It's an interesting contrast to the beautifully detailed Richard William's A CHRISTMAS CAROL special which in my opinion, is the most incredible hand drawn animated Christmas special I have ever seen!! It's hand drawn animation is a spectacular version of the detailed illustrations that illustrated early books of Dicken's CHRISTMAS CAROL! The characters look like Daumier caracatures in exquisite detail! Check out this video on You Tube to see what I mean! I want this special on DVD so much!!! Are you listening CLASSIC MEDIA?!! Interesting that Mr. Magoo's portrayal of Scrooge brings him back full circle to his being a crotchety old coot in his first short RAGTIME BEAR!

So if you want this special as it was originally shown get the ""Bah Humbug!"" expression Magoo Scrooge cover DVD NOT the smiling Magoo Scrooge cover! I got mine for $19.00 plus $ 7.00 expedited shipping from seller california books! I LOVE the ending of the special with Magoo taking a bow with his back to the audience and when he brought out the play directer his foot got tangled in the backdrop ropes which caused the backrounds to fall CRASH on the directer as the directer said, "" OH NO!!!"" Mr. Magoo got the last word as he said,""Oh Magoo ! You've DONE IT AGAIN! You've brought the house down!!"" This part IS MISSING from the 2011 release!!",1399593600,4,4384,4.6576227390180875

Once the theater setting is established we close in on the show and we lose the feel of a theatrical play and become immersed in the tale. A couple of times throughout the movie and at the end we are brought back to the theater setting.

I assume the Magooisms character was used largely for marketing purposes. And the quality of the animation, even after taking into consideration when it was made, is third rate.
But the quality of the songs is another matter entirely. When the young Scrooge sings I'm All Alone in the World, my wife and I cannot keep our eyes dry even after years of viewing. Because of the music this is the one Christmas show we look forward to each year.",1388188800,,617,4.517857142857143

320565,5,6301175239,"When Walt Disney saw Mr. Magoo's Christmas Carol, the first animated Christmas special, airing in 1962, he called up Lee Mishkin to tell him how wonderful he thought it was, and to say it would endure from generation to generation, to be watched with his grandkids and ever after. It's been over fifty years, and Walt's been proved right. The only thing that could improve this special would be to remaster it so the colors were as sharp and bright as half a century ago, and to provide interviews with voice actors and commentary by Darrell Van Citters, author of the definitive and delightful coffee table book that goes behind the making of the special. Done and done.

This 2011 rerelease DVD edition, while very reasonably priced, includes all that and more. Darrell's book provides a marvelous addition, as two of the bonus features on the disc feature storyboards, along with the completed art from the show. Unfortunately, people are scalping the book on Amazon, at such a ridiculous price I can't even print it. One may have better luck with Van Citters' book on Jay Ward Studio art, which is just being released at the end of 2013.

It's a must see and will be apart of my yearly holiday line-up.",1386547200,,349,5.140350877192983
320572,4,6301175239,"Even though I was familiar with Mr. Magoo, unlike many people, I had never seen MR. MAGOO'S CHRISTMAS CAROL on television. Therefore, I don't quite have the same affection for it that many people seem to.

In terms of story, MR. MAGOO'S CHRISTMAS CAROL is a show-within-a-show: Mr. Magoo is starring as Scrooge in a Broadway adaptation of Dicken's A Christmas Carol. He plays the role well and the story is fairly close to the original story. However, things are enlivened a bit by the typical sight gags that always accompany Mr. Magoo. The Broadway show is bookend by segments of Mr. Magoo's journey to the theatre and his destruction of the set pieces after the show has ended. The special features the vocal talent of the delightful Jim Backus as Mr. Magoo as well as several other famous voice actors of the time (the show originally aired in December 1962).

Although the story follows Dicken's basic outline, there are some major differences. The biggest difference is the music because this isn't just a cartoon that's about a show on Broadway: it's a musical, too. The music was written by Jule Styne and Bob Merrill. Besides Mr. Magoo, it is the songs and music that people seem to remember most about this special.

Other changes in the story include the appearance of the Ghost of Christmas Present before the Ghost of Christmas Past, the elimination of Scrooge's nephew Fred, and the eradication of the metaphorical children Ignorance and Want. Personally, I found the switching of the ghosts of Christmas Past and Present to be confusing and I didn't like that Scrooge's nephew Fred doesn't exist in this version of the story because I've always found Fred to be a character that made Scrooge seem more human and feel even more like a real person; Fred's the only family he has and the only thing in his life before the ghosts appear that really attaches himself to the man he once was. The animation was fairly top-of-the line for the time it was made. However, there are moments (such as what the Ghost of Christmas Present is and how it appears) that seem rather crude nowadays.

Overall, MR. MAGOO'S CHRISTMAS CAROL is an entertaining, musical Christmas cartoon. It has more appeal for those who grew up watching it and those who are fans of Mr. Magoo, but there are elements that have a special appeal for modern audiences who have no attachment to or nostalgia for Mr. Magoo.

The Blu-ray of the special includes a slipcase with an illustrated booklet about the making of the special and a DVD copy of the special. Special features on the Blu-ray include a commentary.",1386288000,2,2588,4.742222222222222

It was rerun on TV, and they really butchered it, commercials would come on in the middle of conversations, they deleted whole scenes, and the flow of the story was ruined. The quality of the DVD is very good, the musical numbers were exactly as I remembered.

320597,5,6301175239,"First of all, contrary to another reviewer, the songs in this adaptation are EXCELLENT and if you do NOT cry when you hear the song that Scrooge duets with himself as a boy left behind in school (""I'm All Alone In The World"") then you are made of stone! In fact, the music was composed by Jule Stein and Bob Merrill, who wrote the songs for Hello Dolly and ""Funny Girl"" (the song ""People"")...so you DON'T write Academy Award winning songs and then slouch through the rest of your work! I happen to be a professional songwriter myself and I know how difficult this work is - the score itself is provocative and emotional - and VERY Christmas-y! I also highly recommend other songs in the score as well...I tend to review based on the music and,as an EMMY award winner myself, I'm telling you that this is wonderful.
A song is given to Scrooge's former love (here she's called ""Belle"" instead of ""Fran"")and her song is beautifully sung with haunting accompanying visuals. The other great song is ""We're Despicable"", a comic treatment song given to the Laundress, the Charlady and the Undertaker - very clever lyrics by Mr. Merrill!
Finally, the song representing the Cratchit family is equally excellent, heart-tugging yet hopeful as the Cratchits themselves were ... with the voice of Jack Cassidy (David Cassidy's dad) as Bob. Also, listen for the great Morey Amsterdam (""Buddy Sorrell"" from the Dick Van Dyke Show as one of the three men discussing Scrooge's death when he's being lead around by the Spirit Of Christmas Yet To Come! He says: ""What has he done with his money?""
As far as the rest of the presentation, the colors are brilliant, the transfer is tight and the film was originally a TV show so it's not that long and yes, it was ""freely adapted"" ... but I own almost every Christmas Carol version and I'll tell you right now that Patrick Stewart (the captain from ""Star Trek Next Generation"") must have reviewed this film when he made his excellent version - there are references to ideas presented in the Magoo version that are not in others!

The way it is presented to the TV audience is not as an animated movie, but you the audience are given a front row seat to a Broadway play.

Millions of hands to shake in the world, Why can't my fingers reach...  ...I'm all alone in the world.""  Living an isolated childhood this impacted me greatly and I immediately claimed this as one of my favorite holiday cartoons.

320645,4,6301175239,"I owned this show on DVD but decided to upgrade to BluRay for the 2012 holiday season.

The visuals on the BD are really good - crisp, clean, clear. Much better than even the DVD version. The soundtrack isn't as spectacular, which is a little disappointing, as it would have been nice to have Jule Styne's fabulous score available in updated and remastered sound. Mind you, there aren't any faults with the sound (drop-outs, etc), it's just a bit cramped, which is to be expected from a mono source.

This is a nice musical version of Dickens' classic tale, though I would hardly call it ""the best"" available movie/video version of ""A Christmas Carol,"" as have some reviewers. Pride of place for *that* claim remains firmly with Alastair Sim's 1951 version, which received an excellent remastering in 2011 from VCI that was reissued once again in 2012. That film version really captures the spirit of Dickens as no other has, or probably ever will.

Still, Magoo's Christmas Carol is well worth having. There's more depth to it than meets its cartoon eye. It respects Dickens on its own terms and succeeds in delivering the essence of this well-loved tale. One can't imagine TV producers today doing as fine a job as was done back in the 1960s with this holiday classic. And, it isn't played and overplayed on TV during the holiday season (as are ""The Grinch"" and ""Home Alone I & II""), so it's nice to have on one's shelf.

320654,5,6301175239,"The best ever.

  Let those words penetrate. I state them in reference to the titular work under review and, mind you, I have seen every film and telefilm `straight' version of Charles Dickens' classic A Christmas Carol, plus almost every humorous take on it- be it spoof or satire, from lame musical adaptations to modernized updates to the brilliant reworking of the tale in the first season of the great American television sitcom, The Odd Couple. But, the animated Mister Magoo's Christmas Carol is the best version ever of the tale, and that includes Dickens' own often too heavyhanded morality play itself. The reason is that the cartoon takes on all the best elements of the source work, mitigates that work's flaws, deepens its positives, and adds a goodly amount of its own improvements. It is, in short, one of the finest examples of television cartoonery ever made, and, interestingly, try as I might, I cannot find a single objective flaw in it. But, there is a flaw, albeit in my own criticism. I just stated that Mister Magoo's Christmas Carol is `one of the finest examples of television cartoonery ever made,' and that is incorrect. In fact, it is THE finest example of television cartoonery ever made, with the caveat that I have only a great knowledge of American cartoonery. It is also a great example of pop art made for children that succeeds on other levels, not unlike such films as The Curse Of The Cat People and Godzilla's Revenge.",1359676800,,1457,4.773809523809524

Children were always smiling and anticipating Mr. Magoo's next mis-step. Magoo's Christmas Carol is just such a tale.  The story line follows the original story written by Charles Dickens, but the writers have adjusted it to the world of Quincy Magoo.

It  is very carefully crafted as the ""filming"" of a Broadway play, and at each commercial break, ""the camera"" pulls back to reveal the audience and the fact that Mr. Magoo is on stage to give younger sensitive children a chance to recover from the sadness of the drama before the final satisfying happy resolution (and there are other moments of comic relief and cuteness). ...I have always been haunted by the beauty of the music.  Looking at the back of the CD now 50 years later, it made perfect sense that the composer of all the songs was one of the Masters of the American Songbook (though he was actually British) Jule Styne! He wrote ""All the Way"" for example - I think one of Frank Sinatra's most affecting songs.  I didn't know if this production would match my very high expectations of childhood memory, but it was actually even better than I remember.

320737,1,6301175239,"Watching ""Mr. Magoo's Christmas Carol"" was a tradition in my family and was happy when it was released for DVD. The TV airings of this fine special were scarce over the years, that is, until 2012 when NBC decided to take it out of the archives and air it on December 22nd.  I knew I'd be in for a dissapointment with the passage of time, because commercial time in 1962 is not the same as 2012 and you knew there had to be scenes cut out. Boy, was I right!  What they did to this classic feature was an astrosicity. They cut the whole beginning song ""It's Good to be Back on Broadway""  and there was no indication that this was Magoo's stage-play. All the scenes with the curtain opening and the mock audience were cut out. Some of the musical numbers were shortened including my favorite with the three hags. I think the worst was the way it ended abruptly with the finale of ""The Lord's Bright Blessing"" gone entirely. Even the ending credits were gone which had beautiful music played over them.  You didn't get the same effect. Do yourself a favor, watch the DVD as it was intended to be shown and write a nasty letter to NBC.

Bonus features are rather lame, although the unused overture which underscores the Production Montage Slide Show bonus feature is rather nice. Missing is the Magoo short that was found on the 2007 DVD. This Blu-ray is a rather mixed bag in my opinion.

We were always amazed that he could get himself into such predicaments because he couldn't see what he was doing, and yet he would come out unscathed!  Cartoons were so much simpler back then.

This set includes a regular DVD and Blu-ray version of Mr. Magoo's Christmas Carol.  It is based of course on Charles Dicken's novel about Victorian era England, a time of great divide between the rich and very poor.  Mr. Magoo is Ebenezer Scrooge, a wealthy but stingy man with no heart, and his transformation into a man of great caring as a result of being transported through time by three ghosts.  There are many lessons to be learned in this great classic story, and amazingly this animated version is one of the best versions of the movie ever made.

The DVD and Blu-ray both have vivid color and clarity and excellent sound.  The real treasure of this classic version of the story is the music.  There are some unforgettable and touching songs that are ONLY in this version of the movie.  In particular, the songs ""Alone in the World"" and ""The Lord's Bright Blessing"" are my favorites.

This Christmas classic is one of my husband's favorites, and he considers it to be one of our Christmas traditions he most looks forward to...watching this with the grandchildren.  So having it on DVD ensures that he doesn't miss it, like he often did when he had to wait for it to come on television.

Well, there needn't have been any concern.  I have not seen this particular classic TV special since my childhood.  (It arrived in 1962...I arrived a year later.)  I have no particular affinity with Mr. Magoo or his antics...but he proves to be a perfectly fine Ebenezer Scrooge.  Mr. Magoo becomes Scrooge because in this story, he is a modern Broadway performer, debuting in the new musical version of the classic Dicken's story.  So we are briefly introduced to Magoo as we might normally see him in another cartoon...but quickly, the curtain rises and he becomes Scrooge, with only minimal Magoo-like characteristics.

This telling of the classic tale is breezy and fast-paced.  It's very faithful to its source material, including taking lines directly from Dicken's writings.  Because this is a 1962 production, there is not really the irony that we see in so many current versions.  It tells the story with sincerity, and this sincerity might be appreciate by parents who would like their children to just know the story without so much special effects clutter or modern cynicism.  The show is also a musical and features a number of songs by Jule Styne (Broadway great...FUNNY GIRL, etc.) and Bob Merrill.  Not every tune is a homerun, but many are quite funny (many of the best visual jokes accompany the songs) and a couple are fairly moving.

The animation for this early color TV special is pretty rudimentary.  This is not Pixar or even classic Disney.  It's early TV, but honestly, it has a late `50s/early `60s flair & style to it that make it quite fun to watch.  The whole thing feels DESIGNED, rather than just low-budget.  The animators did a great job, and even better, the voice actors bring so much color and life to the proceedings.

The new blu-ray / DVD combo set is lovely.  There's a nice booklet talking about the history of the show.  There's a postcard of Magoo & Tiny Tim, ""signed"" by Jim Backus (who played Magoo, of course) and there are more bonus features than I would have expected from a 50 year old TV special.  They are brief and while I wouldn't call them ""essential viewing"" they DO add to an overall understanding of how the show was put together.  This collection is a very fitting tribute to what was, after all, the first true animated Christmas classic for TV...paving the way for RUDOLPH, CHARLIE BROWN, FROSTY and more.  I'd rank it right up there with the best of `em.",1354406400,7,2678,4.709677419354839

Mr. Magoo's Christmas Carol was the first animated Christmas special to be produced. It predates pretty much any other Christmas special you can think of, really, and it is...surprisingly good.

You know the basic story, I should hope. A miserly man is visited by three spirits on Christmas Eve night (well, technically four, and it's more like Christmas morning in the very, very wee hours), these spirits remind him of what his past was, show him the present and give him a glimpse of the future. This has a salutary effect on the man, who vows to be a better person and is soon beloved by all.

Now, then. This is an animated version of this classic Dickens tale and features Mr. Magoo (voiced by Jim Backus), in the Scrooge role. Beyond that, it is a surprisingly straightforward and faithful adaptation of the story. We don't have (many) scenes of Scrooge bumping into things and apologizing to them (which wouldn't work for his character anyhow), and while there are songs, there aren't that many, though one of them did remind me that I probably saw this as a little kid back in the 1970s.

In addition to the show, you get a raft of bonus features, including a bit on the making of and a bit of audio commentary. Not bad for a TV program that could predate the birth of the grandparents of some of the children likely to view this.

Overall I found this a charming, entertaining program. It was far better than I expected, and I really think it's worth picking up if you want a friendly, sweet, good adaptation of the Dickens story.",1353715200,,1612,4.56401384083045
320772,4,6301175239,"Mr. Magoo is an old classic. Who doesn't remember watching his original cartoons with his bad eyesight and odd vocal cadence. I can't say that I remember watching this cartoon much though so it was somewhat new to me when watching it 50 years after it's release. The translation to Blu-Ray is good but I did have trouble with the audio. My kids and I all had trouble picking up words, especially spoken by Mr. Magoo. I know that is often his usual way of speaking but it was frustrating. The musical breakouts were also fun but not my favorite thing. I guess it's a personal preference.

The bonus stuff was good and always adds value to the experience.

It's nice having on Blu-Ray but I'm not sure if it really makes a difference watching this on Blu-Ray or DVD.

Although (and I know this is not the popular opinion) this is not a holiday favorite of mine it has been packaged and presented very nicely.

320773,5,6301175239,"Nearsighted senior Mr. Magoo is an actor returning to Broadway to play Ebeneezer Scrooge in ""A Christmas Carol"" for this 1962 holiday special that is recognized as the first ever animated Christmas special, and a much beloved one at that! Once the curtain rises and Magoo takes on the role, the tone turns pretty serious, as we get a reasonably straightforward and loyal, animated interpretation of the classic story by Charles Dickens. And, despite being done in the limited animation style of the day, the truly great songs, the lovable characters (including Gerald McBoing-Boing as Tiny Tim!), and the timeless Dickens tale make this one a special that endures!

Now available in this Blu-ray/DVD combo pack from Classic Media, ""Mr. Magoo's Christmas Carol"" has never looked so good! The quality of this Blu-Ray release is completely gorgeous! And we're given a respectable set of bonus features to boot! In addition to a booklet sampling a new book on the making of the television special and a collectible card, both the Blu-Ray and bonus DVD carry a fine audio commentary with some of the creators, plus art to film comparisons and a song demo. This really is a fine set! The only gripe I could possibly make on it is that some Magoo short cartoons would have been nice bonus features as well. Regardless, if you're a fan of Magoo, Christmas specials, or anything else about this film, I highly recommend it! A heartwarming special with a famous voice cast and excellent songs by the team behind ""Funny Girl"", this Blu-Ray makes it very easy to see why this special is such a classic!

320775,5,6301175239,"""Mr. Magoo's Christmas Carol"" is a great family classic that looks great on both the Bluray and DVD included in this ""Collectors Edition"". My wife introduced me to Magoo's Christmas Carol some twenty five or so years ago and we literally played several video tapes to the breaking point.

The story loosely follows the main plot lines of the Charles Dickens original classic, but with Mr. Magoo in the lead role and a great collection of memorable songs to highlight the main scenes. We have seen this so many times that even my teens automatically sing along with the majority of the songs, but especially enjoy ""Ringle Ringle"" and ""Razelberry Dressing"", while my wife really likes ""Winter Was Warm"". It was interesting that what you are seeming is actually a play staring Quincy Magoo as Ebeneezer Scrooge, but it all works.

The picture quality is very good, considering that this was made in 1962 and was the first animated Christmas special made for TV. The ""Bonus"" content is a interesting collections of commentary and storyboards, and also includes a booklet on the special and a nice picture. The extras are nice, but the main show is the reason enough to pick this up.

Highly Recommended!

320778,5,6301175239,"Many of have our own special memories of Christmas movies, and one in particular for many generations is ""Mister Magoo's Christmas Carol.""  Mr. Magoo, a loveable, but someone klutzy visually impaired character showed up on the screen in this now classic film in 1963.  At the time, most of the actors, especially Jim Backus, who is the voice for Mr. Magoo/Ebenezer Scrooge, were familiar faces and voices many baby boomers will remember.  Of course, if you belong to one of the more recent generations, you will probably remember this classic spoofed by the Simpsons.

Keeping up with the times, this new collector's edition includes both the BLU-RAY and DVD, a bonus for many families who may have DVD, but are planning to convert.  Inside the box there is a nice commemorative booklet based on the book&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Mister-Magoo-s-Christmas-Carol-The-Making-of-the-First-Animated-Christmas-Special/dp/0692001557/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Mister Magoo's Christmas Carol: The Making of the First Animated Christmas Special</a>&nbsp;and a movie still that shows Tiny Tim hoisted on Ebenezer Scrooge's shoulder.  Of course it has a faux-signature penned by Jim Backus.  The film rights were once owned by Paramount Studios, but were renewed in 1990 by Classic Media.

My favorite scene in the film is when old Quincy Magoo, who has taken the part of Ebenezer Scrooge, practically and almost literally brings down the house at the end of the film.  I can still laugh at the slapstick humor after all these years.  I do like the bonus features that this film has to offer.  For example one can check out their favorite scenes by clicking on what are called ""Chapters.""  The only drawback I see is that the language selection is somewhat limited as only English and French are offered.  The slideshow montage that shows clips of penciled drawings and the end results were fascinating.

Many people in the cast were well-known radio, television, and film actors in their day, perhaps only to be remembered in ""Mr. Magoo's Christmas Carol.""  The push to BLU-RAY while keeping a DVD in the package made this collector's edition all the more appealing to me.  If you're into classic Christmas tales, you simply have to add Quincy Magoo to your list as he plays the part of miserly Ebenezer Scrooge.

320779,5,6301175239,"This wonderful DVD/Blu-ray combination is a collector's edition and is a copy of the 1962 Mr. Magoo Christmas special.  It is the retelling of the story written by Charles Dickens in 1843 titled A Christmas Carol.  In this version we have the blind and bumbling Mr. Magoo playing Ebenezer Scrooge in a Broadway play.

The presentation and story was portrayed wonderfully by the audio cast of the special.  I wanted to see the reaction of today's generation to this old classic since today's cartoons have come a long way in digital graphic arts.  My nine year old grandson watched the movie with me and he rated it a 5 stars.  He loved the story and when it was over I asked him what he had learned from watching the cartoon and he got the message clearly and in great detail.

I won't go into the storyline since we have all heard it for generations but it is a classic for all times that teaches sharing and love are more important than greed and being lonely.  One of the classic lines that Magoo sings in the film several times hits home to the theme and it is, ""Millions of grains of sand in the world why such a lonely beach. I'm all alone in the world!""

The set comes with a Blu-ray disk and a DVD nicely packaged in a dual case inside of a beautifully decorated theme box.  It also includes a short book about the making of Mister Magoo's Christmas Carol with insight into the production, songs, cast and history about how wildly the classic was accepted by audiences and critics combined.  There is also a card with the signature of Jim Backus (The voice of Mr. Magoo) showing Mr. Magoo carrying Tiny Tim on his shoulders.  The disk set features bonus content that includes storyboards and song demos.

This is a very good cartoon with a life lesson in it for all to enjoy.  It brings back a bit of nostalgia to the older generation while teaching everyone about the joy of Christmas and about love and sharing.  My grandson and I recommend it to you!

I received a sample of this DVD evaluation and I promised to provide a fair and honest review.",1351382400,,2057,4.430851063829787
320780,4,6301175239,"Mr. Magoo (voiced by Jim Backus) is starring on Broadway as Ebenezzer Scrooge.  And this hour special follows the story from the book.  Scrooge is a miser who can't see the point of Christmas until he is haunted by three spirits who show him the error of his ways.

I've got to admit I had never managed to see this special over the years, so I don't have the warm nostalgia to it many others do.  Still, this is a very good version of the classic story, especially for the 52 minute running time.  They leave some characters out, but I can understand that since the story is compressed.  What bothers me more is the change of order that the ghosts visit Scrooge.  It just doesn't work as well as the original order did.

What works so well here are the songs.  They are very close to Broadway quality and convey so much emotion from the characters.

One reason I had stayed away was because I didn't see how Mr. Magoo, a comedy character, could play Scrooge.  They actually keep most of the comedy to the Broadway wrap arounds and play the story itself straight, so it works well.  And this might be the least scary version I've ever seen, although Marley could still frighten very young kids.

This Blu-ray set is great for fans.  The picture looks absolutely amazing.  I have nothing to compare it, too, but I can't imagine it looked any better with previous releases.  The sound is full surround, but the back speakers are pretty much just used for music.  Extras include an interesting audio commentary hosted by Darrell van Citters.  There are also some storyboard to finished scene comparisons and a gallery of background art in progress and finished plus a demo of one of the songs.  You also get a booklet with some of the behind the scenes stories.  All this plus a DVD copy of the special as well.

While this will never be the definitive version of the story for me, I can certainly see the appeal.  New or old fan, be sure to watch this year.

NOTE: I received a copy of the Blu-Ray set in exchange for my honest review.",1351209600,,2033,4.435135135135135
320781,5,6301175239,"While a few of the other classic holiday shows can still on rare occasion be spotted on TV around Christmas, Mr. Magoo's Christmas Carol seems to have gotten lost in time somewhere. Years ago, the show was just as highly anticipated each year as many of the other classics, but as time has gone on, many have forgotten about poor Mr. Magoo. In this film, Magoo, just as nearsighted and suborn as he usually is, plays the roll of Ebenezer Scrooge in the Charles Dickens classic A Christmas Carol. Magoo of course is perfect for this roll, since he's already got the same look as Ebenezer, just not as scary and he is oh-so comical, since he's almost blind as a bat. This film comes with two disks, one Blu-Ray and the other a DVD, so you are certain to be able to play it on which ever player type you have. And you can even share this Christmas classic with a friend or family member, by giving them the second disk of the movie you are not using. This cartoon of Mr. Magoo's Christmas Carol is a well loved Christmas show that was almost lost in history, but now can live on in the homes of those who love him.

The cartoon is produced as a ""stage production"" with Quincy Magoo driving hazardously to the theater, arrving late, and causing mayhem, but... as soon as the curtain opens and the music begins, the whimsical Quincy Magoo melts away into the background and his character Ebenezer Scrooge is faithfully portayed. All of the characters are empathically represented.  There is lightness and humor as well, as when Scrooge is returned to his boyhood days and his employer's Christmas ball.
This being a musical production, all the music produced plays into the plot seamlessly, and there is an alto solo that will melt your wintery soul.

MR. MAGOO'S CHRISTMAS CAROL (1962) is a one-hour Rankin-Bass cartoon that was the first animated holiday special ever produced specifically for television. It opens with Magoo singing ""It's Great to Be Back on Broadway.""

During this sequence we see flashes of newspaper headlines that includes ""NET TO BEEM (sic) 'CAROL' VIA TELSTAR,"" a reference to America's first two commercial communications satellites (owned by AT&T). There's some backstage funny business and the show begins. At both commercial breaks and returns, we see the stage from the audience's viewpoint.

There's a number of memorable Jule Styne/Bob Merrill songs here, such as ""Ringle, Ringle,"" which in the coda has Bob Crachit (Jack Cassidy) wailing a plaintive ""Coal"" counterpoint to greedy Scrooge's self-satisfied coin inventory. The woeful ""Alone in the World"" is heard during the Christmas Past segment, with young Ebenezer (Marie Matthews) tearfully lamenting having no friends, while old Ebenezer remembers, cries along, and harmonizes. Later, he very effectively reprises this tune while sitting atop his own grave.

Jane Kean, who played Trixie Norton on later Jackie Gleason Show Honeymooners segments, surprises with a lovely voice in ""Winter Was Warm,"" Belle's sorrowful goodbye to Ebenezer. ""We're Despicable (Plunderer's March)"" has a horror movie look, with three comically creepy robbers selling off items stolen from a freshly-dead victim (we know who, if Scrooge doesn't). ""The Lord's Bright Blessing,"" the Crachit family's holiday celebration anthem, features Tiny Tim's many references to ""razzleberry dressing"" and ""woofle jelly cake.""

Besides those mentioned, also heard are the voices of Morey Amsterdam, Joan Gardner, Paul Frees, Royal Dano and Les Tremayne.

With perhaps 40 non-music minutes available, teleplaywright Barbara Chain had to cut major portions of the Charles Dickens story, including Scrooge's nephew and long-dead sister, his ruthless progress in business and teaming with Jacob Marley.

320841,5,6301175239,"Mr. Magoo was a cartoon favorite during my childhood.  It was fun to watch the antics of the near-sighted man about town. Contrary to politically correct pundits of today, we did not think of Mr. Magoo as making fun of visually impaired people.  We saw him as overcoming his handicap, dispite the gaffs and comical situations he never realized he was in.
Mr. Magoo, voiced by beloved Jim Backus(Thruston Howell of ""Gilligan's Island""), was the perfect vehicle to introduce Charles Dickens' ""Christmas Carol"" to children and adults.  In his whimsical ""bumpers""(which in following years were cut out for commercials) we see the character of Magoo in full glory.  His bumbling, the frustrated cast, crew and director, and Magoo going on not realizing the chaos he is creating.
The story comes through all of this in shining songs and dialog.  It was the old version of the ""Mr. Magoo's Christmas Carol"" that I remembered.  Also, it was a time when religion was politically correct and the song ""The Lord's Good Blessing"" was cheering to hear.
The special bonuses on how the show was drawn and the story boards were wonderful.  It is a learning experience on how much work used to go into animation before CGI.  I am glad they have survived.
All in all, sentimental reasons aside, I think this is a great piece of animation and worth the price.
(By the way, my neices liked the song where the hired help was selling Scrooge's personal belonging, especially the chorus of ""La-La-Lah"" close-up of the snaggle toothed maid.  It used to make me cringe.  Anyone else experience that?)",1324598400,,1575,4.843283582089552
320842,4,6301175239,"If they ever showed Mr. Magoo's Christmas Carol on television during my childhood - and it was reportedly shown well into the 1980s - I never saw it, so I don't have the fond childhood memories that many of my fellow reviewers have.  When this Christmas special debuted in 1962, it was something audiences had never seen before - television's first truly animated Christmas show, predating even the old Rudolph and Charlie Brown standards.  As such, I can see why it obviously had such a lasting impact on young viewers of the time.  At the same time, I must say that it doesn't possess the same magic for me, watching it now for the first time as an adult.  The very thing that others seem to love the most - the music - proved to be the least enjoyable part of my viewing experience.  Frankly, I was surprised to learn that the music was written by the heavyweight Broadway duo of Jule Styne and Bob Merrill because I found the songs simplistic and intrusive to the story.  Even as I was watching and listening, I thought to myself that kids today probably wouldn't enjoy this music - and thus, the show as a whole - very much.  Maybe I'm wrong about that, but that's still my opinion.

If you're wondering how dear old Mr. Magoo could possibly portray a Scrooge in real life, I'll tell you.  Mr. Magoo is actually playing the part of Scrooge in a big Broadway production; apart from his unconventional arrival at the studio and his ""bringing down the house"" bows, we're actually watching him perform in the show.  While much was cut out in order to fit it into a one-hour television special, the story does remain faithful to the original Dickens classic for the most part - the one major difference being the fact that the Ghost of Christmas Present precedes the Ghost of Christmas Past in the spectral visitations.  That is just weird to me, and I have no idea why they chose to jumble up the order like that.

Along with the Christmas special, you also get the Mr. Magoo treatment of Washington Irving's story of Rip Van Winkle - you know, the guy that fell asleep for twenty years.  I actually found this to be more enjoyable than the feature presentation - probably because there was no singing involved.  Getting back to Mr. Magoo's Christmas Carol, though, I will say that this is probably one of the best and easiest to comprehend adaptations of Dickens' story for children.  In the end, though, I just don't see twenty-first century kids clamoring for Mr. Magoo's Christmas Carol the same way they would Rudolph or Frosty.",1324512000,,2534,4.575221238938053
320843,4,6301175239,"Okay, okay, Mr. Magoo has fallen on hard times in the PC era. But this special was an annual holiday treat for me as a kid, and it still works. I showed a three-year-old this film today... he was pulled in and almost in tears at ""I'm All Alone In The World,"" transfixed by Belle's song, laughed at the four thieves in their number, and literally jumped into my arms, buried his face and yelled ""hide!"" at the first appearance of ""The Ghost of Christmas Yet to Come."" 'Course, he has a vivid imagination, heartily encouraged by grandpa... but I digress.

Let's get the PC issue out of the way first. I'm nearsighted, and have had retinal surgery to boot, and truthfully, I think the offense taken at Mr. Magoo's nearsightedness over the years is overstated. I've always viewed his gung-ho self-regard and pluck at letting nothing stand in his way as positives, and most of his antics as pure slapstick, a lost taste to be sure. I consider myself quite sensitive to stereotyping, but this is a cartoon, b'gosh; how complex does one expect it to be? Isn't Rudolph's Yukon Cornelius a bit of a ""fat"" joke? Yet I'll concede the point that many people see Magoo as little more than a lampoon of the nearsighted and the cranky elderly.(So what about ""Grumpy Old Men""?) That said, there's very little of that in this film, mostly in the opening and closing framing bits and in a couple of stray Magoo jokes in the main story (see his myopic Christmas turkey bit with the little boy and the grocer near the end....)

The framing device -- Magoo ""baack, baack, baack..."" on Broadway -- is the film's weakest element. In fact, after years away from this film, when I opened my gift video of this a couple years ago (thanks, honey... and thanks, Amazon), I'd forgotten all about it. I guess when I was little, we were still settling in in front of the TV with our hot chocolate during that sequence... It's okay but not brilliant. Again, consulting my three-year-old critic, he loved the slapstick bit at the end, the whole stage set collapsing on top of the stage manager.... as if little kids can't discern that mild cartoon violence isn't real. ('Course, he does play throw-the-ball-at-Grandpa's-head a lot, but he'll learn... another digression.)

It's in the main narrative of Scrooge and ""Carol"" that this becomes magical. I wouldn't go so far as some of my fellow vid-honks in rating this on a par with ""War and Peace,"" yet it is quite special in the genre. First, Barbara Chain's adaptation, in cramming Dickens into one hour with commercial breaks, is a deft simplification of the dense Victorian narrative, retaining its flavor, its main points and even some of its language. (Though no English accents -- you won't miss them at all.)

Jim Backus' Magoo is really quite brilliant casting as Scrooge, and unexpected, a twilight serious role in a career as a slapstick comedian, like George Burns in some of his latter films. His cranky irascibility believably transforms into his giddy joy later on. He gets great voice-work support from the likes of Royal Dano, Jack Cassidy, Morey Amsterdam, and cartoon-voice masters Paul Frees and Joan ""Rocket J. Squirrel"" Gardner.

The animation is old-fashioned, yet gets the job done, and some of it is really quite expressive. (Note the sad and pensive facial characterizations in ""I'm All Alone"".) Again, in this age of a busier, ADD-inducing animation style, these hand-drawn cells are a throwback, but they do capture a kid's attention, and they're a nostalgic treat for adults. (Think of the dancing in ""Charlie Brown's Christmas"" -- you mock it, but you love it.) And the simplicity is some of what makes these images fun (the blackout displaying the only-a-couple-of-teeth singing mouths of the thieves; the post-visitation Scrooge bouncing and floating about), or chilling (the starkness of Christmas-Yet-To-Come, the just-as-stark tracking shot through the motionless graveyard as Scrooge reprises his lonely lament), or even poignant (the snow-globe sleigh and changing-of-the-seasons montage, the swirling leaves in ""I'm All Alone"").

Ah, the music. I have read that Jule Styne was struggling to get ""Funny Girl"" on Broadway when he was approached about this special; given that context, ""Back On Broadway"" is a great inside joke. One of my fellow Amazon vid-critics has rhapsodized that he wonders why there's never been a Broadway adaptation of this score. Puzzle not, for there's not really enough songs to comprise one, and they're all really short. But what songs they are! Forget, for a moment, the serviceable-but-forgettable ""Back On Broadway."" There's a couple of fun novelty tunes (the Thieves' Song -- ""LAAA, LAAA, la-la-la-la-LAAA..."" and ""Ringle, Ringle"" with its contrapuntal chorus for Cratchit). Both have some clever lyrics; I always loved the forced rhyme of ""ani-bules"" and canni-bules"", and Scrooge's wise post-revelation thought about accumulated wealth (coins) -- ""give them away and nobody can rob you..."" The Cratchits' Christmas song goes from cute (""wuffle-bewy dwessing"") to stirring. And then there's two songs as good as any popular songs ever written:  Bette's wistful ""Winter Was Warm"" (sung by Jane Kean like a healthy-young-Liza Minnelli ballad). And the heartbreakingly sad ""I'm All Alone"", which to this day, makes me cry. It is as good and effective a Broadway lonely-child ballad as ""Where Is Love?"", ""Castle In A Cloud"" or ""Maybe"", and you wonder why it hasn't entered the kids' repertoire like those. Sung by Marie Matthews -- what has she done since? --  and in duet and reprise by Backus, it really makes effective use of childlike simplicity and Backus' creaky voice characterization.

A word about Walter Scharf's under-appreciated incidental scoring. He makes great use of ""Winter"" as an opening theme and of the other Styne tunes as underscoring. And the kettle drum as accompaniment to the silent third Spirit is very effective, a poor man's John Williams ""Jaws"" theme as a minimalist creep-out device.

No, this is not the best ""Christmas Carol"" ever made; Alistair Sims and George C. Scott can duke it out over that. But for a non-literary introduction to that dark tale, this is excellent. And it gets a solid thirty minutes of attention from Casey the three-year-old Roger Ebert. As for us adults -- pop in the cassette, head off to the kitchen to warm up some hot cocoa, and by the time you hear ""Winter Was Warm"" tuning up, settle in for a warm winter's treat.

320890,5,6301175239,"One of the first animated Christmas specials for television, Mister Magoo's Christmas Carol (1962), is an adaptation of Charles Dickens' classic tale A Christmas Carol, featuring the nearsighted and basically good hearted character Mr. Magoo (voiced by the incomparable Jim Backus).  While the adaptation is not quite a perfect fit, it delivers Dickens' cautionary message in a memorable and endearing way.  The premise is that Quincy Magoo is an actor playing Ebenezer Scrooge, in a stage production of Dickens' story that is highlighted by a number of musical numbers.

With the understanding that Magoo is just playing the role of Scrooge, makes his being a cold-hearted and mean character more acceptable, as Quincy Magoo is not a man who is deliberately cruel to people.  From there, it's pretty easy to get drawn into the very familiar story, as the ghosts of Christmas visit Scrooge to show him the error of his ways.

With the Ghost of Christmas Present, Scrooge visits the home of his loyal hard working employee Bob Cratchit (voiced by Jack Cassidy) who does not have the financial means to provide as much as he would like to for his family.  Cratchit's family is blessed with a great deal of love and togetherness, but his youngest son Tiny Tim is in need of some monetary assistance to save his life.

With the Ghost of Christmas Past, Scrooge is taken back to the days of his youth where his quest for wealth cost him a chance for love with a beautiful young woman named Belle.  Of course the most poignant and terrifying moments occur when the Ghost of Christmas Yet To Come arrives, and Scrooge is heartbroken upon learning of the passing of young Tiny Tim.  Scrooge also learns of as his own death, and views his own grave.  There is great emotion and power attached to this Ghost, who's quivering pointing bony finger carries great condemnation and dread.  It's pretty scary stuff for a cartoon, and it's easy to understand why Scrooge had a change of heart.

The musical numbers are mostly fun, and help to reinforce the overall message of the story.  The music is by Jule Styne, with the lyrics provided by Bob Merrill.  ""The Lord's Bright Blessing"", featuring the voices of the Cratchit family, is especially memorable, introducing ""razzleberry dressing"" to several generations of viewers.  ""Ringle, Ringle"" is Scrooge's ode to money and the sound that coins make.  ""Winter Was Warm"" features the voice of Jane Kean as Belle, singing about how love and happiness has been lost.  ""Alone In The World"" features a duet between the young Ebenezer, and the hardened older man.  ""We're Despicable"" is a nasty but fun tune sung by Paul Frees, who provides the voices for some characters who have looted the deceased Scrooge's belongings.

Mr. Magoo's Christmas Carol is available in several versions on DVD, and is also included in several holiday special collections, however the Bluray edition is presently available only in this Bluray/DVD Collector's Edition combo, which looks terrific, and is a great value.  The 52 minute feature looks marvelous on Bluray, with bright vibrant saturated colors, good color separation, with few visible flaws or signs of dirt.  The presentation on DVD is nearly as good.  Both discs contain some impressive bonus features, including a highly informative commentary track, with contributions from author Darrell Van Citters, and many who worked on the production of the classic.  In addition there is a beautiful booklet 16 page booklet written by Van Citters, with all loads of information about the production.  And finally, a replica of a cell from the movie, signed by Jim Backus, is included.

All together, it's a wonderful package assembled with love, care, and appreciation, that is highly recommended to fans of this classic animated Christmas special.",1321315200,4,3813,5.004754358161648

Yea, it's THAT good!  It's not a comedy, there are some very dark moments, but I think young Kids will be fine watching it(I certainly was!)

320971,3,6301175239,"Why ghost stories became associated with Christmas in the Victorian mind (which led to Dickens's original of this animated TV special) remains one of the great unanswered questions.  But, as has been noted by other reviewers, video adaptations of the story often are too scary, gloomy, or both for little kids, while this one is for the most part upbeat and sunny.  Quincy Magoo, voiced by Jim Backus, is playing Ebenezer Scrooge in a Broadway musical, and his portrayal of the famous miser is no more sinister or misanthropic than any grumpy neighbor with whom kids might be familiar.  The storyline has also been considerably simplified: there's no sister Fan Scrooge, no nephew Fred, little emphasis on Tiny Tim's declining health (and only three siblings for him instead of five).  Some of what happens (like the spirits' transparency or the falling snow) was probably rather far beyond stage technology at the time, but children won't care, and the songs are good.  One does wonder how Magoo managed to learn his lines, given his infamous eye problems, or how he gets around the stage without falling over anything!

It's dated in too many ways when compared to modern animation. In fact, part of its arch charm is that it is indeed so quaint.  Admittedly, no adult seeing it for the first time is going to pay it much mind.  This is simply 60s-era holiday kitsch.  So I'm unabashedly confessing that the sole reason I bought this was the nostalgic fancifulness.  A modern child might still find that the songs have memorable hooks, which said child won't realize until many years later, like I did.  Before AMC aired this about ten years ago, I hadn't seen it in some forty years.  I was suddenly warmed by the instant trip through time, and surprised how many of the little phrases from the choruses I recalled, albeit if just a gist.  The memory of Tiny Tim's sweet lisp in sharing his enthusiasm for razzleberry dressing was distinctly vivid, and I was smiling to myself as he chimed in with his reminder.  Then there's Magoo as Scrooge singing ""ringle, ringle"" and a more innocent Scrooge singing ""I'm all alone in the world.""  There's no way I can convince anyone else of the value of all of this who isn't already coming here to warm their hands by the fire.  It's a sentimental journey, as they say, and I'm here because I know there are so many kindred spirits who're experiencing this the same way I am.  It's to those folks I'm writing.

So, my fellow spirits from Christmas long past, I ask you rhetorically: Aren't modern times ironically wonderful, that we can take these trips down the proverbial memory lane anytime we want, thanks to entertainment technology?  Isn't it a cause for celebration that whoever owns the keys to those vaults of old shows have kept us in mind?  And, look!

If I didn't already own the DVD, I'd probably take the BD option, but, alas, it came too late.  For everyone else, there it is, if you want it.

Anyway, it's past 12 midnight now, so it's officially Christmas Eve.  It's been nice sharing this warm moment with my fellow fans of this Yuletide confection.

This DVD is a terrific gift for office and other Christmas parties where you have to bring a gift worth under $10.  Its funny to see who wants it.  Sometimes its the middle aged people, like me, who remember the Christmas special so fondly.  Sometimes its people with kids.

321065,5,6301175239,"Mr. Magoo's Christmas Carol is a rather fast-paced cartoon rendition of Dicken's ""A Christmas Carol"".  Depite Magoo being a rather dunder-headed character in the cartoons, this Magoo - as Mr. Scrooge (spoken (and sung) by the great Jim Backus), is a perfect Scrooge!

I have seen Jim Carey's version and the Muppet's version of this play, and I have to say I enjoy Magoo's version, mostly because the heart of the message of a repentant heart rings clear, and the songs presented throughout the play are wonderful, meaningful, and catchy.  I find myself still humming the melody to several songs years after viewing the video.  I just completed introducing this classic to my children, and they loved it as much as I did.

Being faster paced than the other two versions mentioned, Magoo's Christmas Carol will hold the interest of young viewers, who will absolutely delight in the music, and the sheer joy of the play. CArey's version is too dark and creepy, while the Muppet's version is somewhat distracting with all the Muppet characters.  Michael Caine's ""Scrooge"" is also a rather listless.  Having seen all three, my children vote overwhelmingly for Mr. Magoo's version.

This is a classic.  I wish it was presented on TV yearly at Christmas time, but I have not seen it on TV for many years, perhaps decades.  I decided to purchase it just to show it to my children,as I was entranced by it as a child.  It was well worth the price. It will  be something we watch every Christmas now.

For younger kids, (and even adults) this is a real treat.

321102,5,6301175239,"The reviewer for Amazon demonstrates a lack of understanding of the art of animation coupled with just plain ignorance and the combination is breathtaking. This animated short represents a milestone in television history, because it was the FIRST made-for-TV animated Christmas special. It set a standard that others tried to emulate and few matched. The songs, far from being forgettable, are as fresh to me today as when I first heard them forty-odd years ago. Jules Styne, one of the giants of the American songbook, wrote the songs, and took time out from writing ""Funny Girl"" to do so. The animation, which is highly stylized, is a form that was popular in the 1950s. It is not Disney, and it is not Warner Brothers, but it is a sophisticated, witty and freeform. Magoo was based on a character that Jim Backus created for himself-- he used to do routines at parties for his friends-- and those who don't understand the subtlety probably shouldn't bother with this video or any of the other Magoo stories. But those who appreciate sly humour will enjoy this immensely.",1261180800,5,1073,4.836956521739131
321103,5,6301175239,"The Amazon Review for this classic, which states: ""This 1962 special marked the last hurrah of Mr. Magoo"" or, ""The play-within-the-show features forgettable songs by Jules Styne and Bob Merrill..."" demonstrates incompetence of the highest order.

First, due to its popularity, this Christmas special inspired an entire prime-time television series featuring Magoo in classic stories such as ""Don Quixote"" and ""The Count of Monte Cristo"".

Second, there are countless public responses specifically recalling the music from this master-work of musical storytelling.  I too am among the many who cherish this musical treasure, especially for its memorable tunes, rivaling the best of American musical theater.

For those who were around for its first broadcast of Magoo's Christmas Carol in 1962, one of the unforgettable songs, ""Alone in the World"" deeply resonates within so many of us who yearn for any number of simple family experiences, lost to another era.

Using a simple form of animation combined with an uncompromising Broadway musical score, ""Alone..."" garners a profound level of depth and insight.  The elder man encounters his youth, and for the first time, realizes the one thing that has crippled his ability to love--long hidden from himself until that moment of true reflection when he reaches out and confronts his lost childhood, replacing loneliness with compassion.

And if you choose only to view the public responses to this unique telling of the care-worn Dickens Classic, you'll find an overwhelming outpouring of statements regarding the memorable music.

After all, a plethora of better productions with live actors are available. The animation is far from Disney-quality. And, of course, many people can't stand Jim Backus' Mr. Magoo character.

However, this cartoon Christmas Carol has a number of virtues, including a strict, if abbreviated, fidelity to the original story, a great score with quality production and catchy/heart-rending songs, and the voice of the late, great Jim Backus.

The versions shown on TV have been brutally edited. It's definitely worth buying the DVD if you enjoy the show, and it's a great introduction to the story for children.",1215388800,,724,5.278260869565218

You see, this story is not just the old tale, but a stage adaptation with music and the occasional bit part from the very harried director.

Also included on this disk is a history of Mr. Magoo, which is unfortunately only written for you to scroll through and read and a wonderful Mr. Magoo original cartoon.  It's all very well done, but I was very much hoping for more of a history than just something I could have read off a pamphlet and that's my reason for the one - star deduction.

Mr. Magoo makes a perfect Ebenezer Scrooge and it is really entertaining to watch him stumble his way through this one while learning the lessons the ""spirits"" are trying to teach him.  You pity him more than loathe him especially when he is in his past with his younger self singing the telling ""All Alone In The World"".  The Cratchits are also more prominent in this version.

321291,5,6301175239,"""Mr. Magoo's Christmas Carol,"" made, according to one online source, during the ""decline"" of the UPA animation studio that produced it -- is one of the most affecting, unforgettable works of art I've ever seen. There, I've said it.

I'm realizing that I'm putting ""Mr. Magoo's Christmas Carol"" in the same category as other works of art I've seen, including epic films like ""Lawrence of Arabia,"" sculptures like Michelangelo's David, and novels like ""War and Peace."" Don't get me wrong - I loved all these works of art. ""War and Peace"" is a mighty fine piece of work.

What I'm saying is that this little cartoon made me cry, and moved me, and frightened me when I saw it as a child, and that I never forgot any of those reactions. It also made me sing. ""I'm all alone in the world . . . millions of grains of sand in the world . . .why such a lonely beach?"" ""We have the lord's bright blessing, as long as we're together..."" I've been singing these songs for decades. With no prompting, I've remembered the lyrics - not the way you remember an annoying advertising jingle, but with genuine gratitude that I had these songs in my head, and with real emotion.

I saw ""Mr. Magoo's Christmas Carol"" when I was a small child. I haven't seen it in the decades since. I was given the DVD as a Christmas present. As soon as the images began to appear on the screen, I was transported. The cartoon's imagining of The Ghost of Christmas Yet to Come appeared. I shuddered! Utterly without irony! I wasn't shuddering for old time's sake. I wasn't shuddering as a salute to my childhood self. I was shuddering because that crude, two-dimensional cartoon of the Ghost of Christmas Yet to Come, an image so simple I could sketch it myself, scared the beejammers out of me!

The images kept having an impact. Scrooge slams his door on a lone child caroler. I started to cry! Scrooge sang an ode to his coins, while Cratchit sang about how cold he was. Their harmony was terrific! Professional! Sophisticated! I wanted to see this number on a Broadway stage, with a full, live, chorus and orchestra backup! I wondered why I haven't heard a similarly tuneful, memorable, song, that drives the story and conveys the gist of the characters and their relationship, in a recent musical.

The illustrations are simple and yet evocative. The subtly, pastel-colored snowdrifts in the child caroler scene are reminiscent of the lovely snowdrifts in the Caldecott-Medal-winning children's classic ""The Snowy Day."" Simple lines trace the essentials in all scenes: the patches on the Cratchit's rugs, the coal scuttle in Scrooge's office, Jacob Marley's sunken, toothless cheeks. The only complaint I have with the illustration is that I wish the editing had been smoother, and I wish that young Scrooge, when tracing his hand on a blackboard, had been given five, instead of the usual four, for a cartoon figure, fingers.

The fear I felt for the scary Ghost, the rejoicing for Scrooge's redemption, the glow cast by the love of the Cratchit family, the overwhelming compassion and empathy I felt for the lonely boy with his face to the wall -- I've gotta tell ya, i want to jump into the cartoon and rescue that kid: this cartoon aroused the panoply of emotions one associates with Christmas.

I had to stop watching the DVD and look up the talents behind this. Jack Cassidy wonderfully voiced Cratchit. Jim Backus, of course, was Scrooge. The songs were written by Jule Styne and Bob Merrill, Broadway and Hollywood professionals with lengthy and impressive resumes. The whispery, tender, challenging Ghost of Christmas Past was voiced by Joan Gardner.

On the web I read other salutes to this cartoon. I read more or less the same thing, again and again: ""Saw this as a kid . . . never forgot it . . .still my favorite.""

Some modern movies with much larger budgets, working much harder to frighten or move me, often arouse no feeling. Do I cherish ""Magoo's Christmas Carol"" so much, am I moved by it so greatly, because I saw it as a child? Am I just reliving strong, stored reactions? Is that why we baby boomers post as effusively as we do about this?

I don't think so. I saw a lot of pop culture as a child. I've forgotten most of it. I sometimes see these things again and they just look silly to me.

I do think that something special was going on with the making of this cartoon. I do think, too, that there is much to be said for the bare essentials. That little caroler in the snow on whom Scrooge slams a door: there's nothing extra in that scene, and your mind fills in all kinds of blanks. You imagine a back-story for the kid, imagine why that kid has to sing for his/her supper, imagine why he/she lagged behind after the other carolers were chased away. Before you know it, you have fallen into the scene. It's Christmas Eve; you are shivering on a gaslit street and the richest miser in town has just slammed his door on you. Would that movie makers today could learn something from such craft.",1198540800,8,4987,4.592134831460674

The musical score of Jules Styne is still simply the best and most memorable of any of the musical versions. The vocal talents of such past greats as Jim Backus, Jane Kean,Jack Cassidy,Morey Amsterdam and Les Tremayne and songs such as ""Winter is Warm"",""Ringle Jingle"",""La-La-La"", ""Alone in the World"" and ""We'll have the brightest Christmas"" make this the most infectious and accessible of adaptations. This version first appeared on television in 1962 and it ran every Christmas into the '70's. The DVD is crystal clear and the sound is magnificent. Perfect for all ages and highly recommended for pure enjoyment. It helps to understand the character of Magoo as a near-sighted bumbler before watching this so that the inner jokes about him being ""too cheap to by a pair of spectacles"" is not lost.",1197244800,,1141,5.240437158469946

I found the VHS version accidently  back in the late 80's, but what a delight to now have it on DVD. It's  become a tradition to have it on every year as we put up our tree.
 It is a wonderful version of Dickens, that manages to cover most of the book, has wonderful songs added, and still gets the message across. The score by Jule Styne and Bob Merrill is gorgeous, should have been recorded by more performers, and several songs should be Christmas staples. The voices are all broadway and hollywood veterans, led by  Jack Cassidy, Jane Kean, and of course, the immortal Jim Backus as Mr Magoo/Scrooge.
While the animation is primitive by today's standards (tho kids don't seem to mind), it still holds up beautifully some 45 yrs later. Get the DVD, your kids AND you will be delighted!!

PARENTS, TAKE NOTE: The story is terrific, the songs are delightful, and every kid loves Mr. Magoo. And it manages to get the positive love-thy-neighbor message across in 52 animated minutes, with every famous moment and famous line intact--a lot easier on smaller children than the many 2-hour movie versions with live actors.

The songs are delightful, ranging from a tune sung by Ebenezer as a child which will make your heart ache, to a sweet family song (with razzleberry dressing), and a riotous song delivered by some unsavory creatures.

This version is one of the shorter (and therefore more suitable for small children). But the bare bones of the story have been fleshed out by a score that is so memorable and moving that I'm amazed Broadway hasn't taken notice.

It's also a seminal version of the story--many current animators have referenced this production. (I would be very much surprised if Genndy Tartakovsky has never seen it, for instance.) This influence is a tribute to the power the film has over anyone who saw it in childhood.

An added treat is the gorgeous singing voice of Jack Cassidy (known to fans of ""Columbo"" as one of the two ""three-time"" villains, and to fans of ""The Partridge Family"" as the father of David), and the presence of famed Disney (and Boris Badenov!) voice-actor Paul Frees, who contributes the voices of several characters.

Dicken's story has been retold dozens (if not hundreds) of times, and it's always interesting to see what is emphasized and what is left out. This version is one of the shorter (and therefore more suitable for small children). But the bare bones of the story have been fleshed out by a score that is so memorable and moving that I'm amazed Broadway hasn't taken notice.

It's also a seminal version of the story--many current animators have referenced this production. (I would be very much surprised if Genndy Tartakovsky has never seen it, for instance.) This influence is a tribute to the power the film has over anyone who saw it in childhood.

An added treat is the gorgeous singing voice of Jack Cassidy (known to fans of ""Columbo"" as one of the two ""three-time"" villains, and to fans of ""The Partridge Family"" as the father of David), and the presence of famed Disney (and Boris Badenov!) voice-actor Paul Frees, who contributes the voices of several characters.

The songs are show-stopping and the rousing chorus rendition of ""We'll Have the Brightest Christmas"" at the end of the show is downright infectious.  I just had Christmas dinner with a group of fellow working professionals and during the meal we talked about this animated classic and how we all have a special place in our hearts for it.

Lots of show-tune style numbers, some comedy and a little artistic license add a dose of holiday cheer to the story of Ebenezer Scrooge.

MR. MAGOO was a sensational broadway actor in the early 1960's, despite the fact that he was blind as bat. In 1962 Mr. Magoo and his company, put on a live rendition of the beloved Charles Dickens classic to be broadcast on national television. The result is this hour long masterpiece Mr. Magoo's Christams Carol.
This is one of the best versions available, especially if you have kids and want them to enjoy too. The music will surely have the kids singing, and it's pretty catchy throughout. Actually, its a shame that there is no soundtrack available, because some of these songs are really good, (my favorite is the one sang by the gang of theives in the future...""we're di-spicable...""
Mr. Magoos razor sharp wit shines throughout, and is sure to catch a good amount of laughs. That eccentric S.O.B sure has good comic timing. Also good acting from Gerald Mc Boing Boing who plays the role of Tiny Tim. Do it for your family, this is a holiday must for your family DVD collection.",1133481600,6,1165,4.632850241545894

Jim Backus' legendary voice of Magoo highlights a fantastic production filled with great voice actors including Jack Cassidy, Morey Amsterdam, and the great Paul Frees.

The special was Directed by Abe Levitow who was a veteran animated directing working for both MGM and Warner Bros.  But what makes this a real standout are the great songs by Jule Styne.  The songs are lively and catchy and still remembered well almost 40 years later.

I only wish you could find those songs on record (yes, I said record) back then.  It is available on the Nick At Night Classic Cartoon Christmas CD.

You can watch 100 versions of Dickens classic, by every T.V. and Cartoon character imaginable.  But the two best have to be #2-Mickeys Christmas Carol (I have it on VHS and have not seen it on DVD) Mr. Magoo (#1).  No matter how many times you watch it you find yourself caught up in the ""Broadway"" type presentation and you don't want to move or make a sound until the show is over.  The original songs and lyrics are a wonderful addition that makes this version stand out!  You can't help but be touched deep in your heart when a young Scrooge left alone for the holidays at boarding school sings ""A hand for each hand was meant for the world, why don't my fingers reach?  Millions of grains of sand in the world, why such a lonely beach?  Where are two heels to click to my clack, where is a voice to answer mine back?  I'm all alone in the world.""  As a child, I remember it was at that point that I began to pity Ebenezer instead of loathing him.

Regardless of age or familiarity with the Magoo character, everyone will enjoy this holiday classic.  It's truly timeless.  My five year old God-daughter, her 30 year old mother (my niece) and I (40) watched it together recently when we got in a ""Christmas In July"" kind of mood and every one of us enjoyed it.

I first saw it when I was five--and it scared the willies out of me. As I grew older, I grew hooked on all the wonderful songs, just like everyone else.

It was not until I was an adult that I finally taped it off USA Network--this was back in the early 90's. It had been edited significantly, and I found myself scratching my head...wasn't there some scene with Magoo in Times Square singing something about being 'Back,Back,Back on Broadway?"" Wasn't there an argument in a dressing room? Something about 'bringing the house down' (I actually stole that line during a play when the scenery did collapse during the show--but I'd forgotten where it came from originally)? And what about 'Winter Was Warm' and Belle and her snow globe at the window?

I knew the 'Grinch' had been clipped of a few verses of ""You're A Mean One, Mr. Grinch"" and the last seconds of delicate harmony of ""...glory to the new-born King"" axed from Charlie Brown. And what about the full-lenght 'Misfits' song from the earliest version of ""Rudolph""? But it seemed like about 15 minutes of Magoo was missing somewhere.

I was never a fan of UPA's styling but it beats Hanna-Barbera for style and heart by a mile. To me there are a few specials I MUST see every holiday: The Grinch, Charlie Brown, and Magoo. And...yes...my mother DID make 'razzleberry dwessing' every year. Oh, and savy Toonheads will quickly argue that the voice of Tiny Tim is absolutely NOT June Forray! Listen carefully--Ms. Forray has a slight husky throatyness to her voice--Smurfette is a perfect example and you can hear it in Rocket J. Squirrel, too. This voice is absolutely smooth. Compare it to Cindy Lou Who and you'll agree--aside from the fact that she would definitely have been credited as usual, as she is argueably the greatest of all female voice artists, and in the top three with Mel Blanc and Paul Frees.",1108684800,6,1997,4.635593220338983

Over the years I've heard numerous radio adaptations and have seen dozens of film, stage and TV reincarnations but the voice talent and musical score keep this one at the top of my list.  I don't know why the Amazon reviewer didn't like the score.  True, the ""Razzelberry Dressing"" is a bit irritating but most of the tunes are quite enjoyable and memorable, most notably ""When You're Alone In The World"" and the understated ""Winter Was Warm."" The latter song could easily become a Christmas standard, but no one has ever run with it. It's certainly as good as ""Holly, Jolly Christmas"" from the ""Rudolph"" animated classic.  Unfortunately this song is usually cut from the TV showings because it's not a ""kiddie"" song like ""Razzelberry Dressing.""

Somehow, the June-Foray-as-Christmas-Past error is now being perpetuated via the internet, with even original producer Lee Orgel's son now joining the chorus of the uninformed.  Note that Ms. Foray's name does not appear on the closing credits of the original show; considering her fame as a voice artist at the time, she surely would have been listed if she had actually performed on the soundtrack.

Additionally, Morey Amsterdam (also a very popular name in 1962)appears only briefly on the soundtrack---as one of the businessmen that Scrooge meets on the street in the future (""When did he die?"") and as the singing voice of Cratchit's oldest son (you clearly hear his voice during the words ""And on the tree a star of shining Christmas gold.."" in the song ""the Lord's Bright Blessing"").

321470,5,6301175239,"""Mr. Magoo's Christmas Carol"" has always been my favorite musical version of Dicken's classic tale for the simple reason that the songs have been better than all those other versions, including the most recent attempt with Kelsey Grammar.  Since the music and lyrics are by Jule Styne and Bob Merrill, the same team that did ""Funny Girl,"" this is not surprising.  I have just finished watching the show again and I finally noticed that there are only four songs.  They just happen to be four really good songs and even when there is not singing three of them are used to great effect as background music.  No wonder that as soon as you hear the opening theme on the DVD the feelings and memories coming rushing back.

Once you get past the framing device of Magoo showing up for the performance and taking a curtain call as he brings down the house at the start and the end of the show there are only a few moments where you are dealing with Mr. Magoo's nearsightedness.  For the most part Barbara Chain's script does ""A Christmas Carol"" straight up and it works, mainly because when Mr. Magoo scowls and does his whole ""Bah, humbug"" bit you buy it.  As we all know Jim Backus does the voice of Mr. Magoo/Scrooge, while Jack Cassidy does Bob Cratchit, Royal Dano is Marley's Ghost, Les Tremayne voices the Ghost of Christmas Present, the great June Foray (a.k.a. Rocky the Flying Squirrel) does the Ghost of Christmas Past, Joan Garnder is Tiny Tim (who is ""played"" by another cartoon character from the 1950s, Gerald McBoing-Boing), and Paul Frees' recognizable voice does several characters.  Frees and Foray sing together on ""The Bandit Song"" and Jane Kean sings ""Winter Was Warm"" as Belle, the woman beloved by the young Scrooge.

All things considered, ""Mr. Magoo's Christmas Carol"" is my favorite animated holiday show and it is not Christmas unless I see it, ""A Charlie Brown Christmas,"" and ""Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer."" I love the finale when they all sing ""The Cratchit Family Dinner Song"" (a.k.a. ""We'll Have the Lord's Bright Blessing). It does not matter that the animation is bare-boned (the audience never moves) or that there are some completely comic supporting characters, because the songs are so wonderful and the emotion of the story comes through. Watching your favorite holiday specials brings back memories of Christmas as a child, and there is not much in this world sweeter than that.

They are so special, and rememorable, that I would go so far to say that this was the nicest music ever written for a Christmas special.  These were very special composers, remember.  Not only had they also teamed up for the Broadway smash ""Funny Girl"", but Jule Styne had worked with Frank Sinatra for many years, teaming up with other great composers (lyricists) such as Sammy Cahn.  Anyone who knows about Sinatra knows that he had a reputation for only working with the best.  The songs for this little Christmas special were written by some of the best.

321516,5,6301175239,"Charles Dickens knew what he was doing a century before Alice Miller came on the scene when he wrote the Elder Scrooge weeping in sympathy for his Past Self as an abandoned child. So far, this is the ONLY version I've seen of ""A Christmas Carol"" that includes that first crucial moment of Scrooge's healing process. (In seeing the other versions, we've come to believe he was guilted or scared into changing -- but without recovering empathy for his own childhood plight, he never could have done it, as Dickens was instinctively aware!)
As a child, I got the message directly in my heart and soul, which is what this wonderful program does best. The songs/lyrics are fantastic: a live stage version could easily be performed based on the music. I've seen many versions of ""Carol"" over the years, and this one touches me more than any of them for many reasons, but most of all, because it emphasizes that child abandonment is often the first step in creating unhappy adults like Ebenezer Scrooge.",1072224000,6,996,4.7298850574712645

Charles Dickens certainly wrote a story that would be retold in various forms 100's of times.  However, MISTER MAGOO'S CHRISTMAS CAROL really captures the viewers imagination both young and old alike.  Emphasis on the young viewer.  Children, much like myself 25 years ago, really respond to this films animation and great songs.  I still enjoy singing along with the various songs in this film as do my children.  They are very catchy.
All the important aspects of the book are here in this version.  Even though I like other film versions of this story this version holds a special place in my heart.  Also, for all those that think RUDOLPH THE RED-NOSED REINDEER was the first animated Christmas special, think again it was this film.  I firmly believe you will like this film.

Yes, but limited animation can be rewarding when the design work (for which the UPA studio was famous) is as beautifully executed as the work done here - the graveyard scenes and the changing visual landscapes that accompany the song ""Winter Was Warm"" (more about that below) are particularly striking and memorable. ""...forgettable songs by Jules Styne and Bob Merrill""?!! First off, the man's name is JULE Styne - a ""professional"" critic might at least get the composer's name right. Secondly, the score is the most wonderful part of this thoroughly entertaining film, as noted by every single Amazon customer that has lovingly recommended it. JULE Styne and Bob Merrill (""Funny Girl"") were at the peak of their creative powers when they wrote these songs, many of which have resonated with viewers through the years. ""All Alone In The World,"" sung by the neglected child Scrooge, beautifully and poignantly expresses the emotions of many a left-behind child. Particularly gorgeous is ""Winter Was Warm,"" a ballad of loss and heartbreak wistfully sung by Jane Kean, and long overdue for rediscovery by the cabaret set. One could buy this JUST for the score! The story has of course been edited to fit a one-hour tv time slot, but the dialogue is surprisingly faithful to Dickens, and the voice work (including of course Jim Backus, Jack Cassidy and June Foray) is top-notch.

321562,5,6301175239,"How delighted I was to see ""Mr. Magoo's Christmas Carol"" on DVD for the holiday season 2002. My children grew up with this since 1962 when it first aired on TV. Then my grand children when they came along. At our house, it was not Christmas without viewing Magoo's Scrooge at least once.
  A few years it was on TV 2 or 3 times.  Some years not at all.  We were always disappointed when it wasn't shown.  When the DVD came out, I bought us all a copy for Christmas.
  The telling of Scrooge and his tight fisted ways became more understandable in this version with Belle, his long ago sweetheart who had released him from their engagement when he became more and more interested in money making and hoarding wealth.
  Dickens tells how young Ebeneezer was left alone at school when everyone else had gone home for the holidays.  His loneliness was made even more apparent by the song, ""A Hand for each Hand was Planned for the World.""  More than any scene I've watched in other Scrooge movies, this song tells how being by himself so much changed him, why he withdrew over the years, more and more away from people and into money, which provided his warmth and security blanket.
  Music can be such a vital element to any scene, binding it together.  ""The Lord's Bright Blessing,"" ""Ringle, Ringle, Coins make such a Jingle,"" ""Razzleberry Dwessing,"" and ""We're Despicable"" are wonderful songs too, really fun to sing and bringing to life the feelings of each scene.  Belle singing ""The Winter was Warm,"" tells of their love and why it grew cold. How his growing concern for making money had replaced feelings.
  I've wished that all the music scenes were provided separately in the ""special features"" section and that it should be done with every DVD. We love these songs and would SO MUCH enjoy being able to sing along with all the music together.
  Jules Styne and Bob Merrill did such a wonderful job with these songs, that it made ""Magoo's Christmas Carol"" very special.  The catchy tunes and lyrics convey action and feelings better than words spoken in other versions.  Thank you, Jules and Bob for this fabulous music you provided over 40 years ago.
  Because of the songs, it holds up well even after all this time and makes the cartoon version alive and meaningful. How I wish the sheet music of all the tunes and lyrics were offered!! I would want at least 2 or 3 songbooks.
  I recommend this movie highly, especially while children are young and have so much mediocrity and sometimes sleaze thrown at them.  It's still one of our favorite family attractions during the holiday season each year and I watch it several times myself.  It never grows old.",1070150400,8,2663,4.622601279317697

Mr. Magoo (voice of Jim Backus) returns to Broadway to star in a musical adaptation of Dickens' ""A Christmas Carol.""

In an inspired moment, we view the play as if we are in the theater audience. We even have to peer around a lady wearing prominent horn-rimmed glasses. The curtain rises and falls with each act of the play. A lot of talent went into the making of this Christmas tale, including the voices of Jack Cassidy and Morey Amsterdam, but the original songs put this feature in a class all its own. The Cratchit family dinner includes the lively song about the Christmas that is more glorious than grand. Tiny Tim keeps chiming in about ""razzleberry dressing"" and ""woofle jelly cakes."" This is certainly a high point of the story. The tender song ""The Winter Was Warm"" prompts heart-tugging emotion truly unusual in a cartoon. Magoo manages a chuckle-headed charm as the cranky Ebenezer Scrooge. Humor is never far away amid the holiday sentiment. Note the ""We're Despicable"" song and dance routine, even down to the rat that is alarmed by Scrooge and the Spirit of Christmas Future at the window.

_Mr. Magoo's Christmas Carol_ was the last hurrah for the once-great UPA animation studio, which produced a string of Oscar-winning short films during the 1950s.  But UPA never found a way to incorporate its revolutionary new style of animation into feature films, and thus never found a way to expand into more lucrative theatrical markets.  By the late 1950s UPA had effectively lost its creative edge, and found itself working in low-budget television animation.  (UPA's sole attempt at a feature film, _Mr. Magoo's 1001 Arabian Nights_, deservedly flopped in 1959, which sealed the studio's fate.)
_Mr. Magoo's Christmas Carol_ is an example of UPA's low-budget television animation, which, though a far cry from UPA's glory days, is not quite as bad as one might expect.  The animation is more subtle and the acting more nuanced than Hanna-Barbera's work from the same period (proof that UPA's creative spark was not completely extinguished).
The real glory of this television special, however, is in the soundtrack.  Songs by Jule Styne and Bob Merrill are more than serviceable, and at least one (""Winter Was Warm"") is a little-known gem of a show tune.  Orchestrations are lush, and the vocal talent (singing and speaking) is consistently top-notch.
The most jarring aspect of the production is that the soundtrack seems too lavish for the bare-bones, limited animation -- as if low-budget television animation deserved a soundtrack to match.
The DVD release is acceptable, but no better.  Occasionally the colors seem faded (although at other times they seem perfectly vivid), and the film shows considerable grain.  But, having seen this special on television, I can say that the print has undergone fairly considerable restoration for this release (though much more could still be done).  More importantly, the sound is clearly subpar, and could easily benefit from a new remix.  Still, this Christmas special probably hasn't looked or sounded better since its initial broadcast.
Extras are minimal, but worth a mention.  Several short text pages provide information on Mr. Magoo, Styne and Merrill, and key voice talent.  A theatrical poster advertises a cheap children's double-feature entitled ""Mr. Magoo's Holiday Spectacular,"" assembled from this special and ""Little Snow White"" (another television program featuring Mr. Magoo).  Finally, the DVD features a brief, amusing short (""Magoo meets McBoingBoing"") made for television.",1008460800,5,2586,5.355555555555555
321611,5,6301175239,"I thoroughly enjoyed ""Mr. Magoo's Christmas Carol"" when it first was broadcast on television back in 1962.  Not only did it feature the then well-known lovable bumbler Magoo, as played by the great Jim Backus, but the musical score was absolutely wonderful. All of the songs in this ""Broadway""-style rendition are catchy, and some of them are truly touching and memorable.
Since this brief animated production was created nearly forty years ago, there have been countless new ""Christmas Carol"" productions featuring everyone from George C. Scott to the Muppets to Fred Flintstone (really!) And yet the VHS release of the Magoo version, still apparently as appealing now as it was decades ago, is my own children's favorite version of Dickens' classic yuletide tale.  In fact, my younger son at age three used to beg me to play this video again and again at Christmastime, calling it ""Back, Back, Back,"" based upon the opening song in which Magoo sings about how it's ""great to be back, back, back on Broadway.""
This cartoon is reasonably true to the details of the original story, and yet adds its own bits of humor and whimsy. There also is a generous dose of Magoo ""nearsightedness"" humor associated with the premise that Magoo is playing the role of Scrooge in a Broadway production.
As other reviewers have indicated, the casting overall is first-rate and the production is superb throughout.  This is truly a gem of a Christmas video and I cannot recommend it highly enough.",1008288000,113,1479,4.931726907630522
321662,5,6301175239,"I am one of 5 siblings who absolutely LOVE this cartoon version of Dickens' classic;  we watched it on Dec 18th, 1962 (Network premiere) and have followed it ever since.
Yes, it's mostly due to the MUSIC...not only the great songs written by one of Broadway's best teams at the height of their fame, but the FABULOUS BACKGROUND SCORE by Walter Scharf as well....it is beautifully shaped to the emotional context of the show and exqusite in it's orchestral textures and sounds (check the moment when Magoo/Scrooge's bed curtains flash with light to reveal the Ghost of Christmas Past----we hear (in quick succession) tympani and xylophone, a rattle of maracas, and a luminous ""ahh"" from the chorus, with a repeated glockenspiel note, as the chorus recedes into a tranquil hum.  Superb stuff!
The high, divided string writing during the second verse of ""I'm All Alone in the World"" and the touching harmonies and colorings of ""The Lord's Bright Blessing"" are but a few of the inumerable touches of brilliance in this (almost continous) score--a real feast for the ear (and heart!)
Incidentally, ""The Lord's Bright Blessing"" was released on a Nick at Nite CD entitled ""A Classic Cartoon Christmas Too"" in 1997 with OK sound.  Why, oh Why has the full soundtrack NEVER been released????  The endlessly overused term ""CLASSIC"" really applies to this one!
Regarding the casting of the voices---what's all of this ""June Foray"" stuff???  She's not in the cast---it's just a mistake that's being perpetuated via the internet. (Even the son of producer Lee Orgel now mentions her.) Her name is NOT listed in the credits, and the voice which she supposedly does (GHost of Christmas Past) is OBVIOUSLY read by the same actress who does Tiny Tim--Joan Gardner.
Regarding Royal Dano, the impressive actor whose superb rendering of Jacob Marley's lines is one of the highlights of this version----I had the pleasure of spending THREE HOURS with Mr. Dano in his Santa Monica living room in September of 1988.  He had an incredibly VIVID memory of his 40 year career in stage, TV and movie production, and could recall the tiniest detail about anything he had appeared in.  His comments on ""Magoo's Christmas Carol"" were quite fascinating.  (...)
Anyway, Magoo's Christmas Carol is a CLASSIC!  Get it!",1008028800,7,2284,4.973753280839895
321663,5,6301175239,This was one of my favorites when I was a child. Now me and my daughter enjoy it together. The story is done very well and the music is above average for a cartoon. The DVD picture and sound are excellent.,1007596800,3,205,4.024390243902439
321664,4,6301175239,"I just watched the new DVD of ""Mr. Magoo's Christmas Carol,"" and it seems as good a representation of the program as we're ever likely to see.  I doubt it looked much better when it originally aired in 1962, but considering the video technology of that time, no home viewers would have seen it at its best then.  There may have been some very infrequent white specs on the image, but if you're not consciously seeking them, you're not likely to see them.  They are so few, they're barely noticeable.  As some viewers have remarked that the colors seem washed-out, I have a radical suggestion.  Turn the color intensity up on your TV.  I did so, and the colors looked solid and well-balanced throughout the program once I'd adjusted the intensity to a reasonable level.  I directly compared this DVD to a copy of the laserdisc edition, which has been much sought-after by collectors since going out of print years ago.  They are almost identical, except for a slightly sharper image on the DVD.  An audio re-mix, maybe even in stereo, would have been great, but certainly costly.  I wonder if the original studio tracks are even available for this anymore.  In any case, the mono soundtrack works fine, and is practically distortion-free.
If you watched this as a kid, and haven't seen it since then (like me), I can only say:  Wow, what a strong jolt of nostalgia it is!  I find it hard to agree with Amazon's editorial reviewer, who characterizes the songs in this production as ""forgettable.""  That may be because I first heard them in 1962 at around the age of nine, and haven't quite forgotten them since.  I suspect I'm not alone in this, either.  This program isn't high art, and an adult who doesn't have that nostalgic connection to it may not be able to embrace it, but for those who remember, it leaves you with that warm, fuzzy feeling.  I'm very happy to have this DVD edition.",1007337600,3,1889,4.607784431137724
321665,5,6301175239,"Mr. Magoo's Christmas Carol has been my favorite retelling of the classic Dickens story for years, but I was always embarrassed to admit it, given the simplistic presentation.  Finally, I realized that it was that very simplicity, and brevity, that makes this version so appealing.  Without benefit of Technicolor storybook pictures or breath-taking effects, these animated characters give an honest, concise telling of the story of Scrooge's redemption.
Any animated feature is only as good as the voices that speak for the characters and this one is chock-full of winners.  Jim Backus moves beyond his usual Mr. Magoo voice to find new colors to fit Scrooge's character.  The transformation from penny-pinching miser to good-hearted soul via a Scrooge terrified by the visitations is complete.  Jack Cassidy is a sympathetic Bob Cratchit and the multi-talented June Foray (of Rocky and Bullwinkle fame) is the Ghost of Christmas Past.
Surprisingly, even in a 52-minute format this version sticks carefully to the Dickens story line and retains all the essential story elements, something that cannot be said for the majority of the filmed versions which feel compelled to ""explain"" Dickens with extraneous dialogue and scenes.  The only addition -- other than the preliminary play-within-a-play set-up that shows Mr. Magoo arriving at the theatre to get ready to go on stage - is the songs.  And what delightful songs they are!  ""The Winter Was Warm"" is a beautiful ballad, ""I'm All Alone in the World"", sung as a duet between the old and young Scooge is a real tear-jerker, and the ""La, La"" chorus of the rag-pickers, has me laughing just as much now as it did the first time I saw this in the early `60's.  What is it about those wide open mouths and visible tonsils in close-up?
Viewing Mr. Magoo's Christmas Carol at least once (usually more) each year is part of my Christmas celebration.",1007337600,,1895,5.009554140127388
321666,5,6301175239,"[...] Despite its limited animation and bizarre story framing (I never could understand why Abe Levitow thought he needed the Broadway subplot - the story does not require it), this is one of the top five greatest Christmas shows of all time.  I include in that top five movies and TV programs such as Alistair Sim's ""Scrooge"", ""A Charlie Brown Christmas"", and ""It's a Wonderful Life"".  I'm a grown man, hard and cynical after all these years, but at Christmastime there are still things that can bring the tears to my eyes.  Sim's Scrooge apologizing to his nephew and his wife is one; ""IAWL""'s final scene and the words 'Remember no man is a failure who has friends' is another.  But the one that really gets me, every year, is the young Magoo, abandoned at school for the holidays, singing ""When You're Alone In The World"".  It's amazing that this cartoon could convey so much emotion through its crude animation.  Much of the credit for that must go to the Styne/Merrill songwriting team.  It's a shame how this cartoon has been forgotten all these years - back in the 1980s, the only way to see it was if you were lucky enough to stumble over it during a Saturday/Sunday afternoon channel surf of small local stations during the holiday season.  Thank goodness this is finally available on DVD, so that all can rediscover this classic piece of film and remarkable performance by Jim Backus.",1006992000,3,1395,4.688524590163935

How often do you get a great composer like Jule Styne and great lyric writer like Bob Merrill to write a fantastic score for a children's cartoon. They took a little time off from what was their then current project ""Funny Girl"" to write the unforgettable songs. The vocal talents of the cast are great. Jim
Backus' Mr Magoo is always in character as Scrooge. Jack Cassidy
June Foray and the rest of the cast are equally fantastic.
The DVD itself is fine - The colors are well represented and the image itself is sharp - not as sharp as a film made today but remember this is from 1962!! and though it has been put through a
Dolby noise reduction the sound track has some tape hiss which is to be expected for a mono track from this time. The disc has some
nice extras. Over all it a great disc and it's a must for family holiday viewing . Glad to have it on DVD!!!!!!!!!",1006128000,11,990,4.2712765957446805
321669,4,6301175239,"I should preface this review by stating that I am somewhat prejudiced as my father, Lee Orgel, conceived and produced this classic animated TV special.  I believe it is the finest thing he was ever associated with.
The Christmas Carol is presented as a show-within-a-show, with the premise being the myopic Mr. Magoo playing the role of Ebeneezer Scrooge on Broadway.  While there are the usual sight gags in segments that bracket the main story, Magoo plays it straight while in character.
The script, by Barbara Chain, is a very faithful condensation of the Dickens classic.  All the story elements are preserved, though necessarily shortened to fit a 52 minute time frame.  Bob Crachit, Tiny Tim, Marley's ghost, and the spirits of Crhistmas past, present, and future are all there.
Voice talent, provided by Jim Backus (as Magoo), Tony Award winner Jack Cassidy, Paul Frees, Morey Amsterdam (The Dick Van Dyke Show), June Foray (Rocky and Bullwinkle), and others, is a cut above other animated TV specials of the era.
Where this show really shines, however, is the songs.  Composer Jule Styne, whose work includes the Broadway hits ""Gentlemen Prefer Blondes"", ""Gypsy"", and ""Funny Girl"", and lyricist Bob Merrill, who penned 18 top-ten songs in the 1950's, and collaberated with Styne on ""Funny Girl"" and other Broadway hits, provide songs which other animated Christmas specials cannot touch.
This considerable assemblage of talent provides a truly special show.  Sometimes lighthearted, as when Scrooge's belongings are sold by ragpickers, and sometimes poignant, as when we see the departed Tiny Tim's crutch by the fireplace, this show will move you.  Since Tiny Tim comes out at the end and takes a curtain call, even young children will be able to enjoy the show.
My only negative comment, and the only thing that prevents me from giving this DVD 5 stars, is the washed-out colors in the transfer.  Obviously GoodTimes DVD doesn't have the budget to restore the original colors to the production.
That quibble aside, I believe that you will find this to be the finest animated Christmas special ever made, one that will enchant the entire family.",1006128000,24,2155,5.050704225352113
321670,5,6301175239,"When I was little I used to watch Mr. Magoo cartoons every Saturday morning, and I remember watching his version of ""A Christmas Carol"" and liking it very much. Over the years it would be shown on TV occasionally, but it was getting harder to find. I ordered it last week from Amazon and watched it as soon as it arrived. The original songs are precious, and the funniest part is the scene where the ragpickers sell Scrooge's belongings that they have stolen after his death. This version is great for everyone in the family.",1005609600,3,525,4.536842105263158
321671,5,6301175239,"""Mr. Magoo's Christmas Carol"" has always been my favorite musical version of Dicken's classic tale for the simple reason that the songs have been better than all those other versions, including the most recent attempt with Kelsey Grammar. Since the music and lyrics are by Jule Styne and Bob Merrill, the same team that did ""Funny Girl,"" this is not surprising. I have just finished watching the show again and I finally noticed that there are only four songs. They just happen to be four really good songs and even when there is not singing three of them are used to great effect as background music. No wonder that as soon as you hear the opening theme on the DVD the feelings and memories coming rushing back.

Once you get past the framing device of Magoo showing up for the performance and taking a curtain call as he brings down the house at the start and the end of the show there are only a few moments where you are dealing with Mr. Magoo's nearsightedness. For the most part Barbara Chain's script does ""A Christmas Carol"" straight up and it works, mainly because when Mr. Magoo scowls and does his whole ""Bah, humbug"" bit you buy it. As we all know Jim Backus does the voice of Mr. Magoo/Scrooge, while Jack Cassidy does Bob Cratchit, Royal Dano is Marley's Ghost, Les Tremayne voices the Ghost of Christmas Present, the great June Foray (a.k.a. Rocky the Flying Squirrel) does the Ghost of Christmas Past, Joan Garnder is Tiny Tim (who is ""played"" by another cartoon character from the 1950s, Gerald McBoing-Boing), and Paul Frees' recognizable voice does several characters. Frees and Foray sing together on ""The Bandit Song"" and Jane Kean sings ""Winter Was Warm"" as Belle, the woman beloved by the young Scrooge.

All things considered, ""Mr. Magoo's Christmas Carol"" is my favorite animated holiday show and it is not Christmas unless I see it, ""A Charlie Brown Christmas,"" and ""Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer."" I love the finale when they all sing ""The Cratchit Family Dinner Song"" (a.k.a. ""We'll Have the Lord's Bright Blessing""). It does not matter that the animation is bare-boned (the audience never moves) or that there are some completely comic supporting characters, because the songs are so wonderful and the emotion of the story comes through. Watching your favorite holiday specials brings back memories of Christmas as a child, and there is not much in this world sweeter than that. I do not know if this show can win over a new generation of fans, but if you have ever seen this one you know you have to see it again.",1005523200,83,2544,4.714606741573034
321692,5,6301175239,"After waiting for a number of years, this animated classic has finally been re-released including on DVD. The images a crisp and clear. The sound track is fantastic.
The single flaw in the DVD version is that the 'chapters' should have conformed to the curtain breaks (original version was released for TV and that's where the thousand copies of Kid's World, etc. toy store commercials were inserted). As a matter of fact, the last few times I saw this broadcast, a number of important scenes (e.g., the scene with the two men asking Scrooge to donate monies) was deleted in order to fit in more commercials.
The DVD extras include a retrospective of composer Jules Styne & lyricist Bob Merrill who are both renown for their work on Broadway plays and pop hits from the 50s through the 70s (Funny Girl [both], How Much is That Doggie in the Window?
