8630792,5,B008G588OQ,"Not for the faint of heart...and no dull moments whatsoever...everything has a spirit around the man reaching out into the air, to fly!  Really well done documentary and compelling story of how Dean Potter learns - struggles? - to control fear through his experience, his friends and, well what do you expect, love!  Wonderful cinematography and a dramatic forehead view of the sheer drop while he line walks across the top of Stawamus Chief, by Squamish BC. Story within a story...really really great first person narrative of an awfully dangerous sport that challenges mind and body to the extremes.",1395878400,2,601,5.0606060606060606
8630793,5,B008G588OQ,"Amazing documentary, Dean Potter is a rare breed who has taken human flight and exploration to a new level.  Wingsuit flying, free climbing, and slack lining without the use of safety harnesses or ropes is something only a handful of people have ever done.",1395878400,2,256,4.818181818181818
