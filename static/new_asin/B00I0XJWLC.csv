8638172,5,B00I0XJWLC,"I was looking for some practice material in the Bebop style. Sheryl Bailey's 50 Essential Bebop Licks fits the bill. Although it is a guitar method book, it works well for keyboard and other instruments. I just transpose each lick into all twelve keys. After years of buying books and videos with un-hip licks that are thrown together with poor descriptions, it is great to find a no nonsense collection of licks you can use. She describes each lick in correct musical language and demonstrates exactly how to play each example, and where to use them. This is one of the best and most useful instruction videos I ever used.",1423526400,4,623,4.672727272727273
