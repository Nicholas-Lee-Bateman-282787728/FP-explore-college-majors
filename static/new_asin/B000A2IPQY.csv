2350965,4,B000A2IPQY,"I almost gave this movie 5 stars, but I caught myself after comparing Unleashed to movies such as The Boondock Saints and The Lord of the Rings trilogy.

Jet Li gives his best preformance in this movie as far as acting and as far as stunts. Unlike Kiss of the Dragon (also a great movie) Unleashed delivers fast-paced fights without resorting to the use of wires and CGI too much, although there is one or to parts where the use of wires was obvious. The plot is not oscar worthy in my opinion, but it definately goes above and beyond the typical martail arts beat em' up flciks.

Combining some of the most amazing fight scenes in reccent cinimatic history, and flowering it up with an effective- if overdone- story directed with dark style by Louis Leterrier, Unleashed delivers as a heart-pumping Jet Li movie easily worthy of 4 stars and maybe a bit more.

(I would advise that children under my age of 16 watch this movie!)",1128988800,4,928,4.511904761904762
2350966,5,B000A2IPQY,"This was a breakthrough performance for Jet Li. It was nice to see him get away from just being the amazing fighter, and seeing him in a little bit more of a serious role. Of course Morgan Freeman was simply brilliant, and Bob Hoskins did an amazing job as a villian.",1128988800,,267,4.254901960784314
2350967,4,B000A2IPQY,"Let's admit it, Jet Li and Steven Segal have no shot at an award but as concerning acting alone Jet was amazing. If Mel Gibson or Tom hanks played this role they would be winning an award for such a well done performance. Martial artist in general are not well known for their acting but it would do Hollywood well to look down once and while and see that there are some fine actors in other fields. Actors, like with any profession can improve their skills. Jet Li is proof a martial artist does not have to be known solely for his physical abilities, he played the role of Danny with near perfection. Maybe this was the right script for Jet. I highly recommend this movie, great storyline and the funny part is I was actually disappointed with lack of fighting. I would watch Jet fight for 55 minutes of a 60 minute movie but this movie has a story with character development etc... I will give it four stars for too much story and not enough fighting. LOL",1128643200,,958,4.35754189944134
2350968,5,B000A2IPQY,"As a martial arts fan, I will admit that Fist of Legend and Drunken Master 2 still have better fight scenes than Unleashed. But as a movie fan, and a movie critic, I will say that Unleashed is the best Jet Li movie out there. Period. And this includes his chinese films. Jet Li actually acted in the movie, and convincingly too. Morgan Freeman is at his usually best, and I thought along with the girl, they make a convincing family on film. Bob Hoskins was terrific as a villain as well. There are several plot holes, but they do not ruin the movie experience.

As for the fight scenes, I say the first fight in the warehouse is one of the best fight scene I watched in a while. The fights are kinetic, brutal, and wonderfully choreographed by the renowned Yuen Woo-Ping. The last fight with the bald guy was very good also. I think people that brought this movie for the fights are not going to be disappointed. But at the same time, they will also be rewarded with great characters and story.",1127865600,,995,4.378378378378378
2350969,5,B000A2IPQY,"If you go beyond Amazon's reviews, you'll find the majority of the public and the ""critics"" giving Unleashed above par to high rankings. I read a bulk of critic reviews and was amazed to find all of them actually enjoying aspects, if not the entire movie. Well, the movie does speak for itself.

Danny (Jet) is raised similar to an abused dog by Bart (Hoskins) somewhere in Scotland. Danny basically lives in a cage with a few possessions: punching bag, blanket, A-B-C book, and a stuffed animal. He knows no social skills, only to obey Bart. His world changes when he comes in contact with a piano which triggers some memory. Eventually, the piano links Danny to Morgan Freeman's character. This is where the movie shifts gears and we get to witness Jet Li's best performance in an English dialogue movie. Without giving too much away, you literally watch Danny's new life unfold as he discovers humanity; tasting ice-cream, going to the supermarket, wearing pajamas, etc. There is actually sweet humor due to the innocence played by Jet.

There is so much complaints about how children are being desensitized to violence; However, Unleashed just may resensitize one. I'm not recommending parents to allow their children to watch this, because it isn't even close to being suitable for them. What I mean is this movie shows us how violence is definitely not the answer and I actually found myself rooting for Danny(Jet)to no longer fight. You want him to just take all what he has learned in the months he has spent w/ his new family (there also is a 18 yr. old daughter in the mix) and apply it to the situations. Well, he does try, but ... it is a Jet Li movie and therefore it will have Jet Li action.

The fights are pretty brutal and harsh. There is no sweet wushu fluidness that Jet has so often displayed in the past. He basically goes ape nuts while applying some martial arts. This movie displays the 2nd most punishment fighting scenes I've witnessed; still a far cry from what you can view in ""Ong Bak.""

Having said all that, we all know Morgan Freeman can act, Bob Hoskins (who is normally connected to Roger Rabbit and Super Mario Brothers) does a fantastic job as a cruel slime, but surprising is Jet Li. He may have few lines, which fits his character's mentality, but he sure does make it up with body posture and well trained eyes. If you ever felt sorry for a broken down dog being abused and neglected then you'll truly be able to identify with Jet Li's portrayal. If he wasn't considered an action star...he would win an oscar.

P.S. There were a few sniffles in the audience at the end. I heard the European version, ""Danny the Dog,"" has a little different ending...w/ tears.",1126224000,33,2698,4.6125
2350970,4,B000A2IPQY,"Finally, Jet Li has a movie that displays his acting talents. Everyone knows he is close to fantastic when it comes to action sequences, but in this movie, he plays someone who has been trained to be a killer and to shut off emotion. I like the lead characters or hero to have weaknesses, something the character has to overcome. Li does a very a very good job at best. The fight scenes are great, and the acting by the other members of the cast is not bad. Morgan Freeman helped Li along the slow parts of the movie.

This is an action flick with emotion, not as good as KISS OF THE DRAGON or HERO, but BETTER than THE ONE, BLACK MASK. I'm buying the DVD when it comes out.",1126137600,2,674,4.145038167938932
2350971,5,B000A2IPQY,"I was a little sceptical about seeing this film - chop socky films are all well & good but plots sometimes can be a little.. thin.  And Bob Hoskins, luvable cockney geeza that he is, hasn't done anything vaguely as good as The Long Good Friday.  Until now.  Bob overacts and hams it up something rotten, which is a good thing.  Jet Li shows some depth of character and the chop socky is, well, frankly, amazing. And plenty of it.  Oh and violent as well.  The sentimental mushy story part is well done and doesn't detract one bit.  If you haven't seen it, do yourself a favour and buy it!",1125705600,,588,4.290909090909091
2350972,5,B000A2IPQY,"This film although is quite slow..still has a brilliant feel good popcorn entertaining storyline with great martial arts as usual..and jet li does serious acting with style..(Im a big fan of bruce lee, jackie chan, tony jaa, jet li)..jet li does the best serious acting..apart from enter the dragon-bruce lee",1124409600,2,308,5.18
2350973,5,B000A2IPQY,"When I first saw Unleashed, I was not expecting this movie to be as sentimental as it was. Yes the fights are brutal and bone jarring but the ""warm"" parts in the movie made this movie a jewel in its own right. Not everyone is a Jet Li fan and for those that are, we expected an all out fight to the death type of movie but when the mood of the story turns, the acting turns very warm, sentimental, giving you a fuzzy feeling inside at the simplicity of Danny's life and the hardships he now faces. Morgan Freeman literally helped the story along, being more of a father than a friend to Danny and being well natured as he is, he helped bring out the humanity Danny had been missing in his life along with Kerry Condon helping in discovering his true self. This is a well made movie, more of a joy to watch than anything else.",1123545600,7,825,4.1625
2350974,4,B000A2IPQY,"This was a very good action flick.  Decent storyline, fast paced.  Easily one of Jet Li's best performances, with excellent support from Morgan Freeman.  There is a good bit of humor as ""Danny"" becomes acclimated to living as a normal human being.

However, this film is BRUTALLY VIOLENT!  The fight scenes are not your typical martial arts kicking and punching.  Danny breaks bones, breaks necks, rips people apart and the sound effects can be disturbing.  The R-rated version was definitely not for the under-sixteen crowd, and I'm sure the unrated cut will be even more so.  Cautiously recommended.",1123200000,70,601,5.061224489795919

2351038,4,B000A2IPQY,"This is an orgy of violence amid some great acting. Bob Hoskins and Morgan Freeman are excellent, and Jet Li puts in a pretty convincing performance, made all the more remarkable by the fact that he was still playing young men in their teens and 20s when he is 42 years of age as in this film. A must if you love Jet Li and some great fight scenes, a complete slaughtering match that will make you cringe as every bone breaks if you don't.",1457049600,,439,4.176470588235294

There is very strong character development in this film; probably the strongest in any Jet Li films I have seen. You can't help but just flat out feel bad for the main character, and while it's a pretty damn violent film, it's drama and sad tone should definitely be noted.

2351167,3,B000A2IPQY,"Jet Li plays Danny, a man that has lived most of his life as a pet to a criminal 'uncle' (Bob Hoskins).  After a hit is made on the loving 'unc', Danny is taken in by a blind musician/piano repairer (Freeman) and his stepdaughter, and they treat him with a kindness that he has never known.  Sound a little ridiculous!?  It is but it's salvaged from the too silly bin by Li, the ever reliable Freeman, and the genuine affection that develops between the members of this newly-formed family.  Undermined, more than once, by HK style fight sequences that were old DURING The Matrix and are so boring now that they are almost laughable (despite the athleticism clearly shown).  There's also something cheap and off-putting about US/UK/Euro co-productions......don't know quite why that is.

How Jet Li could have accepted such a script, I don't understand because Bob Hoskin's behavior clearly reflects on the whole film. What does Morgan Freeman say of him at the very end?: ""That man can talk a serious shit!""

2351205,4,B000A2IPQY,"This movie depicts how a human might react if they were treated like a dog.  Put into a cage, taught to fight on command, ignore pain and damage until the other individual(s) is down or dead.  Yet redemption is still available as a memory of his childhood clings to him in the form of a piano tune.  It is through this manner that a ""chained dog"" becomes surface civilizied where he overcomes his incredibtly brutal upbringing to rise above and claim his humaity before the curtain ends.  A bit of a leap in the transformation, but it is supposed to be a redemption movei and you can't have your hero staying ""chained"" to his past unable to break free.  Good movie, lots of violence, some over the top; but when compared to some of what's in theaters today, it can seem almost tame.

2351225,4,B000A2IPQY,"I'm not even sure how to describe this movie.  You can read a plot synopsis above, but it really doesn't do justice to how bizarre it is.  Whatever else you may think about its quality, the fact that it exists is a marvel.

Of all the great kung fu action heroes, Jet Li is probably the best actor.  Unlike most action stars, who play the same heroic character in every movie, Jet Li has demonstrated an ability to lose himself in a wide range of roles.  But he's never played a part quite like this one.  Although the character may not make a lot of sense, Li commits himself to the role so fully that you may actually find yourself buying it.  Seeing him succeed in such a bizarre experiment is probably the best reason to see this movie.

He's surrounded by some great actors, as well.  Morgan Freeman does an impressive job of fleshing out a character that is even more incomprehensible than Jet Li's Danny.  And Bob Hoskins chews up the scenery so ferociously that Al Pacino and Nicolas Cage would be jealous.

As for the action, it's pretty sparse but expertly handled.  I think there are only 3 fight scenes in the entire film.  But they're choreographed by Yuen Wo Ping, so you know that they're creative and jaw-dropping.  They're also brutally violent, but if you can handle the pain you won't be disappointed.

On the whole, this movie may be better for renting than owning.  Jet Li has certainly made many better movies than this.  But he's never made anything else quite like it.  If you're a fan of kung fu cinema, you have to see it at least once.",1334966400,,1562,4.440140845070423

You keep rooting for Jet Li and in the end he learns the truth of what happened to him and to his mother. He finally gets free to be himself.

2351227,4,B000A2IPQY,"This is 4 stars because it involves a lot of suspense, extra detail, and a positive moral with a twist of reality.
 The main character is owned by his uncle, who makes him wear a collar to control his killing. The uncle uses Danny, (Jet Li) his nephew, as his own hit man. The only times he uses Danny is when he goes to collect what others owe him or to enter him in fights that he gets paid for, if Danny kills the other person, which usually happens. After a tragic accident an old man (Morgan Freeman) takes Danny into his responsibility and keeps him in a safe environment and plenty of food to eat while he and his daughter, Victoria, teach Danny the ways of life and how to play the piano.
 A few months ago, I wanted to see a new movie without going to the movie theatre so I searched at Wal-Mart, which is where I stumbled upon this film. From the moment I pushed play it kept me interested till the very end.
 One thing this movie didn't lack was suspense. Every scene is packed with fear. For example, when wakes up at someone else's house, he is terrified. Another example may be when he fights seven men at once, all by himself.
 Second, this film is stretched into massive detail, which helps someone visualize themselves in this situation. In return, this may cause extra emotion for someone.
 In my opinion, this film has a positive moral behind it. Personally, I believe the moral is that no matter what your past is, there can always be a new beginning.
 Third, this movie grasps the fantasy of reality and adds a twist on it to make the viewer feel more indulged in the film.
 One downside to this movie may be foul language and/or an inappropriate scene. Young children may not need to view this movie or anyone else that may be offended by cursing.
 On the other hand, if you enjoy watching action movies and neither inappropriate scenes or cursing make you feel uncomfortable, then this is a wonderful product for you to watch.",1333497600,,1949,4.4094707520891365

A boy was taken from a family and grown up as a killing martial art machine a hypnotic crime-master was switching-on by taking a binding collar off Danny's neck. That is why ""Unleashed"" is an English title while an original is ""Danny the Dog"".

String of semi-miracles ushered this being into a family of a blind piano artist transforming this young man into a human being.

Actions are wonderful, Danny a Fighter is superb and the most amazing this being can speak also was treated worse than a Kipling's Jangles Boy.

Probably, the most important a man knew his little brother's reason for.",1323043200,,645,4.732142857142857
2351229,5,B000A2IPQY,"I really can't speak highly enough of this film, plain and simple. In his vast Hong Kong experience, Jet Li may have made a movie that was more satisfyingly dramatic and a better action spectacle, but as far as his limited western outings went, ""Unleashed"" here takes the cake. It's not an easy statement to make about a man who's made as many great ones as Jet has, but the film you're looking at here is one of his absolute best. Buy without apprehension.

The story: Danny (Li) is a human wrecking machine controlled from childhood by the manipulative loan shark Bart (Bob Hoskins,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Mona-Lisa/dp/B00003CXBJ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Mona Lisa</a>) to do his bidding. When opportunity allows him to escape his life of violence, he finds a new home in the care of a blind pianist (Morgan Freeman,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Shawshank-Redemption/dp/B000P0J0EW/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Shawshank Redemption</a>) and his adopted daughter (Kerry Condon,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Intermission/dp/B0002V7SOS/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Intermission</a>), whom he will need to protect when his old life catches up with him.

What immediately sets this movie apart from all of the other Li films is its dramatic content. Most anything that&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Luc-Besson/dp/B0006GVJEE/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Luc Besson</a>&nbsp;writes is worth checking out, but rarely has a separate director interpreting his screenplays done such a good job of giving a movie his trademark feel. Serious credit also goes to the two performers who bookend Li and support him dramatically: again, Li may have experienced the Asian equivalent of them when he was working in the east, but in the case of Europe and Hollywood, Freeman and Hoskins are hands-down the most talented and acclaimed actors he's ever worked with (with the possible exception of&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Mel-Gibson/dp/0790738953/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Mel Gibson</a>, but drama wasn't the focus of that one). These aren't the outright best performances of their respective careers, especially Freeman's, but it's nevertheless nothing short of amazing how easily they can project and interact with a performer who's not really known for his dramatics and plays the majority of this role through body language. Their output elevates the movie by default, and I personally think their experience motivated Lee to give better-than-average performances of his own in future flicks, like&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Warlords/dp/B003DVB7F0/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Warlords</a>.

And the fight content? Woof, I say.&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Ong-Bak-The-Thai-Warrior/dp/B0009VBTQY/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Ong-Bak - The Thai Warrior</a>&nbsp;was released in America the same year, and while Tony Jaa might have had Jet Li's number when it came to stuntwork, the quality and intensity of their respective fight scenes are pretty even. You wouldn't think Li could fight like a real brawler, rather than the wushu guy he usually is, but jeez is he ferocious here: five or six lengthy brawls (among them a one-on-one encounter with&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Silvio-Simac/dp/B000K7UC2Y/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Silvio Simac</a>) reaffirm Li's status as one of the top fist-to-fist guys in the business by playing a surprisingly gritty fight game while still maintain the fluidity and violent grace of his classical work. It's one thing to see the 5'6"" Li spinning and twirling on wires, but it's another to see him literally beat his opponents to the ground and repeatedly drive his fist and elbows into their upper torsos. Sometimes he bites opponents, and the exchange he has with&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Mike-Lambert/dp/B000OAG1Q8/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Mike Lambert</a>&nbsp;in a bathroom easily matches the&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Bourne/dp/B001F12J0C/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Bourne</a>&nbsp;movies for close-quarters brutality. Choreographer Yuen Woo-Ping would promptly return to fancier wire-fu following this one, but ""Unleashed"" proves that he's as capable of staging an outright brawl as he is a martial arts duel.

The one possible fault I can find with the movie is that its switches from its action portions to its dramatic ones a bit too starkly: its middle half-hour is almost devoid of action and kind of feels like it belongs to a separate movie. Other than that, I really consider this one almost perfect, and beyond compare to anything else Li had produced in the last decade. Fans of everyone involved should be sure to pick this one up.",1319068800,6,5058,6.7530674846625764
2351230,4,B000A2IPQY,"I'll admit that upon first look this film seemed like just another run-of-the-mill revenge action flick with mediocre writing and substandard acting, yet I was very pleasantly surprised by how deep and emotionally involving this film actually was! While Jet-Li has never been known for his acting talent, he shines here as young man is taken under bondage by his sleezy and greedy uncle who uses him as a sort of pitbull fighting dog, who makes his uncle vasts amount of money in underground street fights by keeping him sort of captive through the use of a electronic metal collar. How this collar works exactly is never really explained, but given how engrossing the film is, it doesn't really need to be. Danny also deals with a struggle with how his mother died and what exactly happened to her.
Jet-Li's character Danny soon becomes separated by his uncle and gang and gets taken in by a blind piano repair man played by Morgan Freeman (who surprised me that he actually decided to be in this film), and his stepdaughter Victoria (played by unknown actress Kerry Condon who puts on an absolutely charming and adorable performance as a young and extroverted high school senior - you know, the sort of young woman every man dreams of finding and marrying... really, she's that good). All in all, Condon and Freeman steal the show, as without these two actors playing middle-class citizens in London just trying to get by this film would most likely just be another substandard washout. Jet-Li also puts on a surprisingly good performance as we see his character develop from a somewhat very shy and introverted mute to an more open and joyful young man who is reborn into a new life.
Things soon get dicey when it is discovered that Danny's uncle is not actually dead as originally thought, and Danny's two worlds collide.

While the film is only 95 minutes long, and doesn't really do anything that other films have already experimented with, it is the performances that keep you involved. Yes, there are some great action scenes and good fighting choreography in this, but what is relieving is that the fighting is not what is meant to keep your attention during this movie, but instead it is the characters and their relationships, their growth and emotional involvement. You come to care about the characters and what happens to them, you begin to feel bad and worried for Danny as well as his new family. This is just good writing.
Now, sure this movie could have been better if the script was more tweaked and more time was put into the few plot holes that exist or things that aren't readily explained, the villains also could have been more ""hate-able,"" and there could have been room for more sideplots involving the new family... but really, as you watch the film, you just accept it for what it is and do come to like it. So in another sense, this film can't immediately be dubbed an ""action film."" While there is action in it (fairly violent at many points) there is good dialogue and drama, so this could be placed in the borderline action/drama category. The Unrated version is only 1 minute longer than the theatrical version (both version exist on the disc), and I'm sure plenty of brief violent scenes are restored, although I have only seen the Unrated version.

As for the Blu-ray transfer, I must honestly say that it's pretty good, but not great. There is some grain that is left over so while the picture is good, it is no Lord of the Rings Blu-ray quality, but it is quite a few hairs better than what a DVD would be. The sound excels over the video as the audio comes out even across the entire film, and things sound plenty rich and crisp and crystal clear. I would say in some ways the audio in this film exceed many of the more mainstream Blu-ray hits. So definite Kudos for the studio on that one. As far as extras, don't expect anything, you don't get any behind the scenes or anything like that, but considering the price, you won't miss it.
So for action fans this is a good pick up and flick to watch over the some dinner or with some friends. I definitely recommend it, even for those non-action fans.",1318291200,4,4137,4.611940298507463

I say it is moderately violent but many viewers would find the violence extreme.
Simply put, this is a great movie.
I am not easily wowed by sheer action and spectacle and have high standards when it comes to movies. What makes this a truly good movie is it's story. Rest assured, the action is spectacular and Jet Li shines in this film. But it is the story that makes this such a good movie.

You could see the evolution of his character's mindset, all while trying to understand kindness and humanity. Also, great action scenes!

You can't go wrong with Bob Hoskins and Morgan Freeman, either. It was clearly good vs. evil, but those two guys can give nuance and depth to even the most basic of plot points.

The Blu-ray version is clean and crisp. No pixelation even with the intense action and darker surroundings of the fighing pit and Freeman's apartment. Nice extra's as you get a chance to hear Jet Li's take on the character and why he wanted the role so much.

Been a while since I'd seen this movie. I used to own in on DVD and saw it something like 3 times before selling it to make room for the transition to Blu-ray. It took a while, but it's good to finally see this title on BD. And after so many years, I have to say I actually like it a lot more now than I did initially. Danny the Dog (aka Unleashed in the U.S.) is the story of Danny (Jet Li), a poor soul raised from childhood as a human attack dog that does the dirty work of small-time Glasgow kingpin, Bart (Bob Hoskins). Danny is literally treated like a dog given a collar to wear 24/7, is fed food from a can, and lives a pretty desolate life as nothing more than a mere animal. But one day, Danny befriends a blind piano tuner named Sam (Morgan Freeman) who, through a stint of piano tuning, manages to elicit some of Danny's human side, if but for a few minutes. Then, when an accident injures Danny and sets him free from the grips of his cruel master, he seeks out Sam, who accepts him with open arms and offers to care for him with the help of his stepdaughter, Victoria (Kerry Condon). And in their time together, the two manage to re-humanize Danny and salvage his broken spirit from the dark depths of violence and emotional turmoil. This couldn't have been a more perfect role for Li. As apparent by his other Hollywood films, while he does show some actual acting prowess (though more so in his Chinese work) from time to time, the language barrier has always been his weak point. And what better a way to utilize his not-so-good English than with a character that's more about movement (which Li is a master technician of from all that wushu) and less about dialogue? Throw in the opposing fatherly-forces in Hoskins and Freeman (who play outstanding contrasts to one another) and some cutesy lighthearted bonding moments with Condon, and you've got a fairly gripping story. Needless to say, it's also a Jet Li movie choreographed by Yuen Wo Ping, and the action is absolutely brutal when you get down to it. But what surprises me the most is how the entire film manages to be not just an entertaining romp, but also a touching tale and character drama. This is easily Louis Leterrier's best film to date with a little help from his mentor, Luc Besson, in the writing department, and soon-to-be director, but current DP, Pierre Morel. In fact, speaking of Besson, I'd even go so far as to say Danny the Dog was this decade's Leon, albeit a tad less developed, but excellently portrayed, nonetheless.

Video - 4.5

It's been too long for me to remember what this looked like on DVD, but thankfully the extras are in SD, which is enough to remind me of the difference in quality. That being said, Pierre Morel's photography looks excellent. With Leterrier wanting to achieve a film noir-look, colors aren't particularly vibrant. In fact, just about any scene outside of Danny's bonding moments with Sam or Victoria are very cold, drab, and opaque. There are lots of blues, whites, grays, and charcoals used in a majority of the gangster life sequences when we see Danny living as a dog. From his dirty clothes to the grimy streets of Glasgow, the production design gives off a depressing quality befitting of the life Danny has lead to that point. Contrast is also slightly more desaturated in these scenes, though black levels are maintained very well throughout. During the happier times in Sam's apartment or in the various other non-criminal locales, hues are much fuller and create a sense of warmth to counteract the coldness of the former. Contrast and saturation feel more natural making flesh tones appear very lifelike and just a lot more pleasant to the eye. Image detail is actually a lot sharper than I remember and especially in comparison to some of the SD shots from the extras giving the visual presentation a nice sense of depth and HD pop. For instance, you can see all the little indentations of the food at the supermarket, the lining of Victoria's braces, or the fuzzy textures on Danny's teddy bear. The film also possesses a fine layer of film grain to keep the picture feeling gritty, and there appear to be no signs of DNR. There are some instances of Edge Enhancement and some scenes of the movie are a bit nosier than others (like the really, really dark scenes), and there are occasions of dirt and debris popping up here and there, but overall I'm very satisfied with the quality of the picture, especially in comparison to those SD shots from the DVD port. I think all the various color schemes, filters, and whatever other methods they used to portray the different outlooks of Danny's life are a great way of compliment and contrast for another.

Audio - 5.0

In addition to an excellent video transfer, Universal also outputs a booming and reference-level audio experience. The DTS-HD track has quite a bit of rumble to it. LFEs are the most prominent feature making their mark through the pounding bass of the music and various low end sound effects (like dramatic whirring and such). Dialogue is crisp and clear from the center with no distortion or dropout problems, while a majority of the sound effects are not quite front-heavy per say, but slightly more towards the front as a result of the sound design. It's not until guns start blazing that the rears get their fair share of noise distribution, which for all intents and purposes sound awesome because there really aren't that many sequences of it till around the end of the movie. But being most notably a martial arts-centric film, a majority of the effects come from the frequent punching, kicking, whacking, and body thuds. Again, much like the gunplay, there's not an incredible amount of the stuff, but when the violence starts, you can really hear and feel it. I was very happy to feel the thumps and wuds emanating from the sub-woofer and wouldn't expect anything less from this genre. The music by Neil Davidge and Massive Attack give the film a great balance of upbeat ambience for the action and slow, mellow piano/orchestral pieces for character development. Again, directionality and separation don't do a whole lot and are more sporadic in the first and second acts of the film, but immersion is excellent when the fighting ensues. Obviously, the best parts you could use for reference are Danny's fight in the arena and his battle against that bald-headed, wannabe Shaolin monk white guy (never liked his look, but he did a pretty good job keeping up with Li). The arena fight has a lot of sound immersion from the crowd and music with some great body hits and weapon clash effects. And the white guy battle is reference brutality, when they start fighting in the toilet room and literally beat the crap out of each other I can't help but find that scene violently beautiful. The clarity of the smacking of fist on head, fist to body, then foot to head are quite rousing.

Extras - 2.0

While everything else about this disc is great, the extras are very underwhelming and a bit of a disappointment. First, there's a 5-minute clip of Leterrier talking about the film where he basically gives the premise, tells a little bit about the kind of picture he wanted to make, all the star power involved, and how great it was to work with all of them. It's very short and not a bad watch, but an audio commentary would've been nicer. Then there's the feature ""Serve No Master,"" which basically shows the fight choreography for the scene in the arena with some snippets of commentary from Li rounding out to about 10 minutes. Most of it is the fight itself taken straight from the movie with a little bit of P-i-P comparisons from the filming. This one is pretty skipable. Next, there's ""The Collar Comes Off,"" which is a little bit more in-depth about the overall filming and writing. It recycles most, if not all of the commentary and interviews from Serve No Master, though does have some input from Freeman, and a little more from Hoskins. This feature is about 12 minutes long, but again is severely lacking in depth. And lastly, there are a couple of music videos featuring the music of Massive Attack and The RZA. Altogether these videos are about 4 minutes total and are nothing more than highlight reels of the fight scenes. The extras aren't shabby, but they're not that interesting either. Oh well, better than nothing.

Overall - 4.0

Danny the Dog is probably my favorite non-Chinese Jet Li film to date (although I'm not really sure which side I'd put The Forbidden Kingdom on, it's Hollywood-made, but for the most part was made in China..). It's a riveting story about an unfortunate person who came to live a sad life, but was saved from it with a little bit of kindness and lotta' bit of martial arts to take his pursuers out. Ever since Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon set a new standard for me in terms of wushu/wuxia movies with a story, I've found some pretty good gems since then in Hero, Danny the Dog, Huo Yuan Jia (aka Fearless), and maybe even Chi Bi (aka Red Cliff) if I ever get around to watching part II. But I definitely can say is this another one of the greats. With excellent video and reference audio (though a disappointing amount of extras), Danny the Dog (or Unleashed, or whatever you're used to calling it) comes highly recommended.",1284854400,21,9301,4.632121212121212

2351251,3,B000A2IPQY,"If you like Jet Li's brand of high action martial arts films then `Unleashed' will work for you, in parts.  The reason I add the `in parts' part is because the film is not a straight action film by any means.  The action here is intense and it is brilliantly choreographed, but the bulk of the film is a much slower paced exploration of one man's mental upbringing and the chance he is given to rethink his life.

Walking into `Unleashed' (the original title, `Danny the Dog', was much better in my humble opinion) I was expecting something shocking, brazen and violent.  I got that, but only in calculated segments.  In fact, after some brutally explosive scenes of violence the film cools down for quite a while, while Li's character, Danny, starts to find his inner `human'.

The film tells the story of Danny, a lethal fighting machine trained from infancy basically to live like an attach dog.  He wears a collar that `holds him back', but when he ruthless owner (a gangster named Bart) unleashes him, he turns into a savage killing machine.  By chance, Danny meets a blind man named Sam who unlocks a desire to live more civilly, so when he finds the opportunity to escape he does just that.  Danny winds up living with Sam and his step-daughter Victoria, where he learns to trust and love and just live.  Bart wants his prize fighter back, and so he sets off in hot pursuit of him.

Then there is more violence.

Honestly, and this is coming from someone who prefers a good story as apposed to a hodgepodge of action scenes, the middle section of this film just doesn't really work.  The entirety of this film is HIGHLY unbelievable, but the center section is just preposterous.  I think what makes it more so than the outlandish violence is the fact that you half expect your `action' films to be improbable.  In fact, you relish in action sequences and fight scenes that push all boundaries and exploit your senses.  On the other hand, you want a little more reality in your drama.  You want to `believe' it, and this film doesn't give you that.  The relationship formed between Danny, Sam and Victoria is just too unbelievable for its own good.

That, and the fact that Bob Hoskins MAKES this movie, and he disappears when Danny finds his `new' home.

Yes, acting wise, this film rests on Hoskins shoulders.  Li is a capable action star and a decent actor, but he is nothing special (and the whole dramatic element of this film fails him).  Freeman suffers from a poor character, and Kerry Condon is just, well, there.  Hoskins, on the other hand, is all sorts of seething brilliance.  I mean, he is Oscar brilliance here (I have him on my personal Supporting Actor ballot).  His sheer vileness is outstanding as he crafts a sinister character that is the farthest thing from a mere caricature.  He is a living, breathing monster...and you BELIEVE him.  I wanted him to be in every scene.  This may be one of the greatest `villain' performances of the decade, resting EASILY next to the likes of Ledger's `Joker', and miles better than Bardem's expressionless hit-man.

In the end I recommend this film, but with reservations.  I give it a C+, verging on a B-.  See it for Hoskins and for the gritty explosiveness of the fight scenes, but don't expect to love this movie.  It is uneven, but in the end it is worth a gander, maybe even two.",1269561600,,3349,4.585858585858586

[Danny the Dog]

(France/UK - 2004)

Aspect ratio: 2.39:1 (Super 35)
Theatrical soundtracks: Dolby Digital / DTS

Raised as a fighting machine by thuggish Glasgow loan sharks, a young man (Jet Li) finds happiness after falling into the care of a kindly old piano teacher (Morgan Freeman) and his musical-protg granddaughter (Kerry Condon). But Li's past catches up with him, threatening the safety of his newfound family...

Terrific combination of heartfelt drama and bone-crunching action scenes (choreographed by Yuen Wo-ping), anchored by strong performances (including Bob Hoskins as Li's brutal 'mentor') and a finely-tuned script by French action maestro Luc Besson. Grainy filmstock and an excess of closeups (typical of the ghastly Super 35 'widescreen' process) render it less cinematic than it ought to be, and the narrative is predictable, but the movie works on a visceral level whilst simultaneously pulling the heartstrings. Li's best non-HK film since KISS OF THE DRAGON (2001).",1254960000,,1004,5.5
2351266,3,B000A2IPQY,"Interesting concept regarding a man who was brought up as though he was a cage fighting dog.  He lived in a large metal cage that had all the amendities of prison plus a children's ABC picture book.  Later, we learn that his mother who was murdered by thugs (you'll have to watch it to find out which thugs), was also a brilliant pianist, which was why he had a heightened interest in pianos. So when, by chance, during a thug operation, he met a blind man who was piano tuner, tuning some pianos in the same warehouse the operation took place, a seed of decention was formed.  Later, he ran off and was taken in by the blind man and his daughter where he was treated with love and humanity.

However, certain glaring problems arose.  Being raised in that cage from boyhood, who taught him to fight?  I suppose he can't read and write since all he had was the ABC book.  And I can't see how someone who has grown up with such violence could suddenly develop a conscience.  Or if one had a conscience, would not have shown signs of resistance in some passive aggressive way against their captors.  When he was taken in by the family, it was like he returned to where he left off as a boy.

I think this movie was not meant to be analyzed.  It was entertaining.  The collar thing was interesting.  Of course, the fight scene was fun.  The family was enduring.  A good movie to watch when you want to unwind.",1253232000,,1405,4.329501915708812

2351268,4,B000A2IPQY,"When UNLEASHED was first released on DVD I began watching it with the expectation that it will be filled with the martial arts fight scenes that Jet Li is famous for. And since the fight choreographer was Yuen Wo Ping, arguably the best in the world, I knew they would be spectacular and entertaining. The movie does not disappoint. All the fight scenes are brutal, uncompromising, and not filled with the wire-fu style that Ping usually puts in them. But the movie began to surprise me in many ways. The story is much deeper than a typical Jet Li movie--even a little bit ingenious. Jet Li actually has to act in this film, which he proves he is capable of. And the ending features a final scene that made the biggest surprise for me.

To begin with the story. The basic premise is that a ruthless loan shark named Bart(Bob Hoskins) has taken in a young boy and raised him to grow up into a human attack dog. Li is the dog with the name Danny and wears a metal collar around his neck, traveling everywhere with the shark. When someone owes Hoskins money and doesn't pay back, he takes the collar off and orders Li to attack. Li brutally pounds everyone in a room in a violent frenzy until Hoskins is satisfied. The loan shark puts the collar back on and takes the money the client owes. This is a very clever premise and Bob Hoskins demonstrates in this film to be an actor who can play someone truly sadistic and evil and make you believe it. Bart takes Danny to an antiques wherehouse and orders him to watch for a blinking light as a signal to go into a door. Danny meets up with Sam (Morgan Freeman), a gentle and blind piano tuner. Sam has Danny help him tune a piano and we begin to see flashbacks in Danny's life before Bart became a part of it. Danny's past and how he ended up becoming Danny the dog are revealed during the movie in a way that I found to be well done. Sam is intrigued by this young man and even accepts at the time that Danny won't reveal his name.

Danny soon escapes from Bart and Sam takes him to his home where he lives with his stepdaughter Victoria (Kerry Condon), a music student. Victoria is intrigued by Danny and along with Sam they show Danny a kind, gentle, and better way of life. I won't reveal how this is accomplished but will say that one of the key things they show him is the beauty of classical music, especially piano music. It is during the scenes with Freeman and Condon that Jet Li demonstrates his acting ability. Li's acting technique isn't to overplay the emotion but to interact with the other actors in simple manner, and we begin to see how Danny is awakening into this more joyful life. (Jet Li proved that this movie is not a fluke and demonstrated his acting talent again in FEARLESS, which was supposed to be his last martial arts epic although that turned out not to be true.) Morgan Freeman demonstrates once again why he has been a good actor for so long. He plays a man of extreme patience: a way of acting that he proved in DRIVING MISS DAISY, and BRUCE ALMIGHTY. Kerry Condon plays her character in the only way it will work as a girl who is gentle but also filled with energy and love of music.

Of course, Bart has to come back into Danny's life and it becomes clear that Danny will end up defending himself and his newfound family against this ruthless man. Hoskins' remaining scenes in the film actually strenghthen his believability in playing such a sadistic evil person. He has played evil characters before, but he can also play characters on the other side of the coin and even throw in a little bit of edge in them. (This is true in his performance of WHO FRAMED ROGER RABBIT).

Now for the biggest surprise of the movie. The ending actually moved me into tears. Film critic Roger Ebert once wrote that a scene can move him to tears not because of sadness but real happiness. That's what happened to me at the end of UNLEASHED, and it actually raised the movie to be much more than just another Jet Li martial arts film. I wouldn't even dream of revealing this ending. All I can say is that the film starts with a very violent fight scene, then switches between the gentle and the violent, and ends in a really beautiful way. If you can withstand the extreme violence in this film, (and believe me, some of it is really extreme) you might react to it just as I did.

FOOTNOTE: May, 2014. Bob Hoskins died of Pneumonia at age 71. UNLEASHED should be remembered for the virtues that actor demonstrated whenever he played a villain. I have also seen him at the other side of the coin when he played a good guy like in WHO FRAMED ROGER RABBIT. And as far as I know, he was a gifted Shakespearean actor as well. He played Iago in a stage production of OTHELLO. Judging by his performance in UNLEASHED, he probably made you believe in it.",1251417600,,4810,4.363839285714286
2351269,4,B000A2IPQY,"Seriously, the company or person in charge of the putting the previews together did the movie an injustice, because based on that I thought this movie would be a mindless action movie.  This movie did have a story, and it was a good one.  As action goes, this movie was not all that creative or inventive.  If you like action movies, there is something here for you, if you want a movie with a story to go with it, despite how the previews look, there is something here for you as well.

Okay, because the preview sucked, I'll give you a brief synopsis. Jet Li's character is a person, trained to fight for his master.  Forced to live in conditions that you wouldn't allow your own pet to live in, this goes on until his master pisses the wrong people off.  After the accident Li's character finds himself with Morgan Freeman's character, yes, that is right, even though you didn't see him in most of the previews, he has a stong part in this movie.

one day a hit is taken out on his owner and company. after things quiet down and the smoke clears Danny is the only man left breathing. he takes his first steps out of the car and to freedom.

2351288,4,B000A2IPQY,"This was thrilling and disappointing all at once.  It takes western martial arts movies to a whole new level, then lets you down gradually, instead of sucking from the very start.  As much as I love Jet Li, most of his American movies suck, which is not his fault in the least.  Nor is it the fault of his choreographers like Cory Yuen, or in this case, Yuen Woo Ping.  These large Hollywood companies just butcher the hell out of the fights in post-production, and this is almost an exception.  Does Hollywood believe that that's what we want to see?  Six angles for one punch, filmed on a shaky hand-cam?  Not me.  I hate that.  This is still easily Jet's best film since he came to America and blows away crap like ""Cradle 2 the Grave"" and ""The One"".  Though I must admit that for some reason, I loved ""Kiss of the Dragon"".

Jet plays Danny, a ""dog"", raised since childhood by gangster Bob Hoskins to help with collections and other assorted tasks.  Hoskins will warn potential deadbeats by threatening to remove Danny's collar, which has a Pavlovian effect on Danny where he knows it's time to kick the tar out of everyone.  An accident later leaves Danny injured, wandering, assuming that Hoskins is dead, and into the care of kindly old blind piano-tuner Morgan Freeman and his step-daughter Victoria.  Under their influence, Danny starts to come out of his very shy shell and appreciate the nicer things in life, like music, ice cream, warmth (temperature and human), cleanliness, and non-violence.  Hoskins isn't dead of course, and Danny will have to fight again for his own freedom.

What bothers me about this movie is that is sets up a silly premise and almost, ALMOST pulls it off.  Which wouldn't have bothered me as much if I wasn't so engrossed in Danny's plight.  The acting is good all the way around, with an especially impressive performance by Jet.  He really pulls off a combination of vicious and deadly under the care of Hoskins, and sweet, shy, and inquisitively wide-eyed under the care of Freeman.  It totally sucks you in to the contrasting duality before falling short.  It certainly raises some interesting questions about our own feral nature and the effects of civilization.  Even more so than Tim Allen's ""Jungle 2 Jungle"".

The fights are really what attracted me to this, as it should be.  After all, this is a Jet Li movie.  It likely won't disappoint.  All the fights are good, but I am bothered by a film that fails to improve on the opening rumble.  The final fight is flawed only by its absurdity of origin, otherwise it rocks.  Jet and a bald dude duking it out in a bathroom that's barely larger than a phone booth.  These brawls are quite a bit different than any that Jet & Woo Ping have done in the past, together or otherwise.  Again, they are over-edited, but in the grainy, dark, ""Snatch""-like film quality, they don't suffer nearly as much.

If you like American martial arts films (even though it's technically European), you should see this.  It's in a league far beyond most, if not all, in that genre, and nearly transcends several others too... but not quite.

2351289,5,B000A2IPQY,"This was my first Jet Li film and won't be my last. What I expected, I did not get, meaning real fight scenes. What I did not expect, I got, meaning a really touching story.

Danny (Jet Li) was raised by Bart (Bob Hoskins in a unbelievably brutal and inhumane performance) as a dog, a pit bull, to fight when ""unleashed."" Early on, the director gives the impression that Danny cannot talk, that he really is like a dog. However, the scene with Sam (Morgan Freeman playing Morgan Freeman, a wise and kind man), Danny reveals he is human, he does respond to humane treatment, and that he is a sweet person inside the dog collar. This is the part I love--the touching story.

Sam and his step-daughter Victoria (Kerry Condon), an accomplished pianist, awaken Danny's deeply dormant sweetness and bring him back to life and eventually help him solve the mystery of his life: Who is he? Where does he come from? Where is his mother?

What I expected was violent fighting, but what I saw was skilfully choreographed martial arts. Other reviewers praise this, but it did not look real to me. It looked choreographed. I could literally see them NOT making contact. A much better movie for realistic fighting is ""Ong-Bak: A Thai Warrior"" with Tony Ja. Now that fighting looks real!

I really like this movie for its story: for the rebirth of a person from brutality, unkindness, vulgarity, violence, skulduggery. What results is a family, love, kindness, compassion, things that make us better than we are. Add to this the soft kiss of a young girl and the sublime music of a concert hall. Danny is unleashed all right, from a poverty of spirit into a largess of love.

What a fine film this is! Highly recommended!",1199318400,3,1706,4.635761589403973

Li actually acts in this flick and is supported by a strong cast, Morgan Freeman and Bob Hoskins. Luc Besson was clearly behind this project and it shows through the story telling.

2351291,1,B000A2IPQY,"Something strange is going on in the world of film. Pathetically pointless narratives are being made into big movies and sold on the basis of a few images and who is in the starring and supporting roles. I don't know whether to blame the director or the script writer, but this is just utter garbage. All of the characters are caracatured. The whole film seems to be an excuse to repeat a mix between The Matrix and Hero, but with none of the style of either. Mr Morgan Freeman: What are you doing in this film? Bob Hoskins is a decent actor, but why did he take this role? Jet Li: Surely someone can write you a better script than this. Herzog, the great German director, believes -- and I agree with him -- that we are living amid a collapsing civilization, in part evident in the paucity of its images. This film is horrid, from beginning to end. Even the violence is totally lame and unreal. Fake blood appears to be wiped off in the next frame. It's so sloppy and bad it makes me sad, not angry. I'm not even going to watch the ""special features"" on the DVD. I'm just going eject and try to find something better. DO NOT waste your money on this. Luc Besson, if you read this, if you can't do better than this, please don't ""do"" anything further at all.

2351293,4,B000A2IPQY,"For a martial arts picture, ""Unleashed"" was above average because it had some heart and soul to it.....not just people beating the crap out of one another for two straight hours.

However, be wary of those who claim this isn't an action film. That's not true: there is a lot of action, quite a bit of brutality and profanity, mostly by Bob Hoskins' character ""Bart"" in this movie. Hoskins plays profane, nasty slave-owner who has locked up and trained ""Danny"" (Jet Li) to be the ultimate fighting machine. Once Danny is ""unleashed"" (literally) he's a killer and helps the gangster Bart in his criminal work.

Later, Danny escapes his captors and winds up at the house of an older blind American, ""Sam,"" played by Morgan Freeman. He and his 18-year-old daughter ""Natalie"" (Kelly Condon) befriend young Danny, slowly bringing him out of his ""animal"" state. Everyone discovers Danny has some very human characteristics and is basically a nice, gentle guy. The family helps uncover that through music (piano playing, to be exact). These are all touching scenes.

But then - and this is almost a clich in these kind of films - the bad guy comes back, snatches him away and his former bad life comes back....except Danny is a changed man. How he can get out of this latest predicament and what happens to this new ""adopted"" family, takes up the rest of the story. That last part has the same thing: ultra-violent and touching scenes.

Jet Li does an excellent job in here, not only displaying his amazing physical talents but also showing us he has warmth in his face and heart.

Overall: a brutal, yet touching film: an odd combination.",1190073600,3,1631,4.749116607773852

2351305,4,B000A2IPQY,"Jet Li's martial arts acting career has shifted from pure martial arts either as the hero or villain to roles that require him to radiate emotion in between the fight scenes.  In UNLEASHED, he continues this mid-life metamorphosis as Danny, a very confused mob muscle enforcer who wears a dog collar when not carrying out his boss's lethal orders.  Bob Hoskins is Bart, the evil boss whose frequent ruminations about the philosophical underpinnings of evil bring to mind a similar role from MONA LISA.  Here, he takes off Danny's collar as a symbolic unleashing of the brute canine desire to rend that he is sure lies just beneath the surface. And for the first half of the film, we are as sure as Bart that Danny is exactly as Bart sees him.  Danny shows no emotion as he quickly dispatches hordes of flunkies who suffer the great misfortune to be late on their mob loans.  He shows even less emotion as he seems adjusted to living in the human dog cage that he calls home.  But little by little, Danny begins to shed his canine surface.  Indeed, for a while we are not even sure if Danny can speak.  When Danny meets a blind piano tuner Sam (Morgan Freeman), we can sense that the bullying that Danny has endured at the hands of Bart will be replaced by the infinitely wiser and gentler hands of Sam, who sees in Danny a young man who can help him in that now Sam has a reason to teach the intricate art of piano tuning to a worthy student.  It is when Danny escapes his collar that he becomes fully human, and when he confronts an unwilling Bart who attempts to reconnect Danny to his canine roots, we can see that Danny has made the light years long jump from unthinking dog to thinking man.

The fight scenes are of course well done and Jet Li's fans will find no fault with them.  But for those recent fans who have become used to a Jet Li who can command center stage with a flick of the eye rather than a deadly kick, UNLEASHED is an action film that adds just enough human drama to showcase him as an actor who can fight rather than a fighter who can act.",1180224000,,2064,4.321243523316062

2351307,2,B000A2IPQY,"This was an interesting movie to watch because of Jet Li's amazing martial-arts skills. He truly is gifted. Unfortunately, Jet Li alone can't keep this from being unbelievable and silly. I was hoping it was going to be more along the lines of LA FEMME NIKITA and LEON: THE PROFESSIONAL, two very good movies, but I was wrong. They both had better scripts and plots that were well-developed. This movie seemed to be ad-libbed as the camera rolled. It was just too hard for me to suspend disbelief willingly. For example, at the end of the movie, after Jet Li fights a small army of goons half-destroying an aprtment building in the process while beating most of them up, a handfull of gun toting bad guys shoot hundreds of bullets through windows and doors and then vanish. Danny (Jet Li) confronts his master Bart (Bob Hoskins) and pummels him before Sam (Morgan Freeman) smashes a flower pot over Bart's head to knock him cold, preventing Danny from killing him and thereby saving Danny from reverting back to his previous trained attack-dog nature. What happened to the other members of the gang? Where were the police during the battle? Why, in the next scene, do we see Danny and Sam in tuxes at Sam's step-daughter's piano recital? Was the connecting scene left on the cutting room floor? I guess you'd have to really like martial-arts action to enjoy it.

Oh come on..... don't most of us guys have one of ""Those"" movies that we like to pop into the machine and just watch the violence wash over the screen? There is something to be said for the show a guy like Jet Li can put on with his furious feet and ... um... hellacious hands!

I don't even want to admit the number of Jet Li movies I have bought hoping that it would be different and I could actually stand to watch more than just the fight scenes.

I would say that with this movie, I have finally arrived at a movie where I can press play, and put down the remote till the movie is over.

There is actually a half way decent story hiding in here. Plus, you get to see Jet Li work his magic. Granted, the story is not going to make this a movie your girlfriend or wife is any more likely to sit through, but at least you will be watching it long enough to finish your adult beverage.

So why only three stars? Well, I think I would give it a 3.5 if possible. It an ""okay"" movie and that seems like a 3 to me. While the fighting is good, its not amazing - but still good. So the fighting gets a 4 or 4.5.",1174521600,,1258,3.9801587301587302
2351310,4,B000A2IPQY,"I went into UNLEASHED expecting something far different than I received. However, while I was surprised, I must say that I was quite happily surprised and even impressed by the quality of this film. Of course, I went into the theater expecting pure action after reading the plot description: A man (Jet Li) has been caged for years as an ""attack dog"" for a local thug, trained to unleash his aggression whenever his dog collar is removed, suddenly finds himself without his master and must learn to cope with the real world under the guidance of a blind piano tuner (Morgan Freeman). And there certainly was enough action in this film to fulfill my expectations. The martial arts sequences are stunning and the environment of the deadly pit fights is not-of-this-world. I guess I just expected to see Jet Li a bit more ""unleashed"" than he is in this film.

That being said, however, I will tell you that UNLEASHED offers something we don't often see in a martial arts movie: a real sense of story and a cast of developed characters. Sure, the plot is a bit tried in some ways. But we get to see Jet Li attempt a truly significant amount of acting under the guidance (both figuratively and literally) of Morgan Freeman. In fact, the brutal violence in this picture (and it is brutal) actually weaves into the storyline of this picture and helps support the drama, not the other way around as is all too common for these pictures. In fact, my only real complaint is that the very ending of this film is a bit awkward.

On the negative side, this is a movie with the kind of plot holes one expects in a 1970s-era Hong Kong chop-sockey film, not in something with Bob Hoskins and Morgan Freeman. At times it bordered on silly.

Among the many distracting holes, Li's character has been enslaved by Hoskins, and is then taken in by Freeman and his step daughter. In the few months that they care for him, they don't seem all that disturbed by his almost complete lack of knowledge of the world. Then, when the team reunites with Hoskins, Hoskins still has injuries from the incident that separated him from Li, despite the passage of a few months and Li's complete recovery. Silly. I could go on, but you get the drift.

Also, the fact that Danny was a slave to his ""uncle"" seemed unbelievable. It's hard to believe that a grown man could be that docile unless he was mentally impaired. Danny wasn't completely isolated, he saw the outside world and I think that he would rebelled a long time ago.

My last comlplaint is that the death of Danny's mother was never fully explained. Why exactlty was she killed? She was a young and talented piano prodigy. Why would she be mixed up with those thugs? Where was Danny's father during all this? And most of all, how in the world was the uncle able to live through that horrendous car accident and shooting?

2351319,4,B000A2IPQY,"Unleashed, also known as ""Danny The Dog"", is one of Jet Li's most unusual movies, combining a touching story with very caring people, along with violence and down right dirty people.  Danny, played by Jet Li, is torn between his nasty owner, Bart (Bob Hoskins), and his newfound family, Sam (morgan Freeman) and Victoria (Kerry Condon).  Danny struggles throughout the movie, trying to evade Bart, evade killing, evade fighting, and to stick close to his new family.  Bart doesn't give up so easily, and continuously attempts to convince Danny that he is his his master, and a dog obeys his master.  I enjoyed the story in this movie, the stuggle Danny goes through, and the 2 sides he is presented with - a new life of comfort or an old life he has been brainwashed into.

Unleashed isn't quite as action packed as a lot of Jet Li movies, a large focus is on story and internal conflict.  There is enough action to please, and as usual, Jet Li's fights are well choregraphed.  The directing is plesently refreshing, with less closeups, giving the viewer a fight that looks more real as if you were standing nearby.  I expected more ""cage fights"" in this one, but there was only one, although technically not in a cage but that kind of fighting.  Its an intense scene, that erupts from one on one to eventually one on four with weapons.  But this is the only cage fight scene in the movie.  The final fight was disappointingly shorter than I hoped, and not too intense, against some guy that Bart hires to go after Danny.  The fight does bring some originality, with most of it taking place in a very tight spaced bathroom.  Its fun to see the moves in such cramped quarters.

If you are looking for a pure action flick, Unleashed focuses more on action, characters, emotions etc. than most Jet Li films, making it overall a great movie.  It is an interesting combination of dirty violence and bad guys followed by warm, comforting, polite and loving people.  Fans of pure non-stop martial arts might be dissapointed.",1161820800,,2017,4.6394366197183095

Morgan Freeman and Kerry Condon bring the human side to the story as the loving family that accidentally adopts Danny (Li) after he collapses while talking to Sam (Freeman). Freeman and Li work very well on screen together and some of the best moments are when Sam and Danny are shopping at the grocery store. Bob Hoskins was incredible as the villain Uncle Bart. He generates hate and the want of his death, which is exactly the right feelings you are supposed to have for a villain if the actor portrays the character right, and Hoskins did exceedingly well.

I mean if you are into that sorta thing. Some people don't like the story, but I actually think the storyline is one of the greatest strengths of the movie. I enjoyed watching Danny (Jet Li) go from being basically a slave/enforcer/dog, then find a new life with Sam (Morgan Freeman) and his daughter that is basically the exact opposite, and finally realize he can choose his own life, and fight for his choice. Jet Li is particularly good in this movie by going from a ""mad dog killer"" to portraying a sort of innocence and sweetness of a child - or a child's mind basically stunted by his so-called ""uncle"".

Jet is a killing machine that has literally been raised like a dog by a cruel master who uses him to enforce his extortion racket as well as using him to fight in an illegal combat arena where victory only comes with your opponents death.  Li escapes his lifelong captures and takes up with a blind piano tuner(Morgan Freeman) and his daughter who teach him that there is something more to life than killing.  But of course his former master wants him back and all hell breaks lose.  This is a great action picture with a pretty good story if you suspend a little belief.  For example there are no police around despite daylight street fights and gun battles, and no one ever questions why a rag tag Jet Li is walking around with a dog collar on.

He didn't over-act, or play it too much outside.  The fight scenes were incredible.  Choreographed very, very well.

I highly recommend this movie to anyone who wants a good action movie with a great story.  I think with actors such as Morgan Freeman and Bob Hoskins, the movie has some weight to it.

2351336,4,B000A2IPQY,"Luc Besson's signature style is all over the writing of this very fine little film. His ability to push the buttons on the most violent screen business while gradually developing a tale of warm sentiment is well served by director Louis Leterrier and a perfect cast of actors. UNLEASHED is one of the few examples of how martial arts and bona fide drama can be mutually supportive in creating a film that is at once thrillingly athletic and gently tender.

Bart (Bob Hoskins) is a brutish loan shark thug who makes his 'collections' accompanied by his 'dog' Danny (Jet Li), a silent man Bart has raised form childhood to be a caged killer, a human with a dog collar that when removed unleashes a ferocious beast who kills on command of his master Bart. Bart keeps him in a cage, feeds him, and uses him solely for his criminal doings. Danny unleashed is simply a Pavlovian animal and when the collar is replaced, he becomes docile with the sad eyes of a puppy.

During a 'collection' gone bad, Danny escapes and finds shelter in an antique shop basement where he meets blind piano tuner Sam (Morgan Freeman), a gentle man who gradually introduces Danny to music, trains him as his assistant, and introduces him to his 'family' - his step daughter Victoria (Kerry Condon). With the two of these welcoming, tender people Danny discovers how beautiful life can be. The story from this point is how Danny chooses between his Pavlovian response life as a killer and the simple life of Sam and Victoria. The journey is not without stressors and it is a difficult transition that keeps the viewer on seat's edge.

The wonder of this film lies in the extraordinary performances not usually associated with martial arts films. Jet Li does some of his finest athletic fighting on film, but thankfully at the same time creates a character who is multidimensional and memorable - a very fine acting job by Li. Bob Hoskins is brilliant as the despicably cruel Bart, Morgan Freeman adds a luster to his fine portrayal of blind Sam, and Kerry Condon makes Victoria zany and lovable at the same time. The action is superbly captured by cinematographer Pierre Morel with the aura of darkness in Danny's caged life serving as a perfect foil to the martial arts sequences. In short, this is a fine little film about characters worth knowing and provides audiences with both action and drama of a very high level of achievement.

2351337,5,B000A2IPQY,"The new Jet Li/Luc Besson/Louis Leterrier opus, Unleashed, is such a rich cinematic experience, one almost wonders how it ever got made in the first place. A brutal, yet thoughtful, action picture in the vein of Besson's La Femme Nikita and Leon, Unleashed is the ultimate hybrid genre picture.

The story of Danny (Li), a Chinese boy raised from a toddler by a brutal loan shark (Bob Hoskins), trained as a fighting dog, brutalized and demeaned his whole life. With a metal dog collar around his throat, Danny becomes a hound from hell when the collar is removed, doing whatever his ""master"" says.

When he is freed one day (by an assassination attempt by a ""business associate"" of his master), Danny begins a new life with a blind piano tuner (Morgan Freeman, sturdy, sagely as ever) and his step-daughter. They teach him, quite beautifully, of the wondrous little joys of life, something he never knew before. When his master comes to reclaim him, Danny fights with all his might to leave behind his violent past.

Li, as an actor, has never been more effective. His turn in Unleashed is astonishing, subtle and rich, as great as any other dramatic actor has delivered this year.

Leterrier (The Transporter) has proven himself striking genre formalist. Unleashed is a vast improvement over the entertaining but flawed The Transporter. He has crafted a stylish, affecting thriller, the year's best film IMO.",1156636800,6,1410,4.936708860759493

2351339,4,B000A2IPQY,"I'm not a huge Jet Li fan - yeah, he's talented, but some of his films aren't so hot. This one is. The first fight is cracking! Okay, it was carefully choreographed, but it looked so realistically brutal. Incredible.

Then there's the added joy of watching superb actors at work. No, not Mr. Li! Messers Morgan and Hoskins. Both brought an extra dynamic to a genre which usually overlooks the fact it is there to entertain with quality acting and not just wow with staggering action. Okay, I don't think Morgan or Hoskins will be sticking it at the top of their CV, but it was a welcome joy to see actors of such stature performing in such a film.

The story? Ok. A little more depth than Li usually goes for, but I doubt it'll be studied in Film Schools across the world very often.

A good film, with some excellent action. Li fans will not be disappointed. A film most people will enjoy, not just martial arts enthusiasts.",1154995200,,925,4.429411764705883

Highly recommended!",1154908800,,289,4.78
2351341,4,B000A2IPQY,It was a good story with lots of action. I found myself wondering if such brutality exists and realized it probably does somewhere. Maybe here in the USA. Humans are are capable of great acts good and evil. Jet Li was very good in this. I've never heard of him before but I hope he does other movies. Morgan Freeman was his usual fantastic self.,1153958400,,345,4.323076923076923
2351342,5,B000A2IPQY,"The outlandish plot concerns Danny (Jet Li), who has literally been trained to be an attack dog by a vicious loan shark named Bart (Bob Hoskins).  He wears a collar that makes him docile; when it is removed and his master gives the word, he becomes a vicious killer that can take on any ten men in the vicinity at the same time.  When he becomes seperated from Bart, a blind piano tuner (Morgan Freeman) and his goofy step-daughter (Kelly Condon) take him in and he begins to recall his past and become reacquainted with his humanity.  Of course, it wouldn't be a movie if that went smoothly...

As ridivulous as the premise may be, the conviction of the cast and crew make it hugely entertaining.  Working from a script by Luc Besson, director Louis Leterrier attacks the savage fight scenes and the sweetly eccentric humanistic scenes with equal conviction.  Jet Li shows that he has some acting chops.  As fearsome a warrior as he is, the ultimate impression he leaves of his character is rather timid and sweet.",1152403200,3,1015,4.636871508379889
2351343,3,B000A2IPQY,"Well one thing we learn in ""Unleashed"" is that unlike Chuck Norris, Jean Claude Van Damme and others, Jet Li perhaps can act. The soft parts where he learns of his mother, her music, and his first kiss (""hmmm. wet. hmmm. nice) under the tutelage of Morgan Freeman show some nice movement and facial expressions.

The other thing we learn is that he may be the best of the martial arts fighters, Mr. Van Damme having put on a little width, Mr. Chan having just turned to what only can be termed as martial vaudeville, and Mr. Norris, well Chuck's hung up his spurs.

But the movie is so bloody grim that who would want to see it much less buy it? Bob Hoskins, not just evil but stupidly so, and his entourage of baseball carrying thugs and smarmy gunslingers. There's a plot here somewhere and it ain't Pygmallion.

So, if you like the fights it's probably worth it. Not much else. 3 stars. Larry Scantlebury",1150329600,2,907,4.451807228915663
2351344,4,B000A2IPQY,"Unleashed is about a man named ""Danny the Dog"" (Jet Li), raised like an animal since childhood and trained to unquestioningly obey his master (Bob Hoskins). With his collar on, he is docile and emotionless, but when his master takes it off he turns into a powerful, unstoppable killing machine. When Danny is injured and separated from his master, he is taken in by a kind old piano tuner, Sam (Morgan Freeman) and his equally friendly granddaughter, Victoria (Kerry Condon). With their compassion and the solace that Danny finds in learning to play the piano, he tries to regain his humanity and escape physically, mentally, and emotionally from the oppression that had been forced on him for so long.

Directed by Louis Leterrier, Unleashed deals with familiar themes, but within completely different circumstances. Sure we've seen movies about people who were trained since they were young to kill, and we've seen movies about dogs that run away from their abusive owners, but combining the two concepts creates a very original and intriguing storyline. Though it seems like it could easily become weighed down by its implausibility, Li's honest portrayal of Danny makes everything work. That kind of extreme contrast, of being a violent murderer and yet still being nave and innocent, is incredibly hard to pull off, but Li does it flawlessly. Hoskins also does an excellent job as the cruel antagonist of the story, and the scenes when Li's character confronts him are all intensely convincing.

If you haven't guessed by now, this is not a typical Jet Li martial arts movie. It focuses more on the drama and underlying emotions than on the fights themselves, but that's not to say the fight scenes weren't extremely well-done. All of the fights were elaborate enough to be interesting without being over the top, keeping the special effects at a refreshing minimum. And even though these scenes were also very gory, the bloody violence was used to show the contrast between the two worlds that Danny becomes engulfed in; it wasn't just thrown in for looks.

The only thing about this movie that annoyed me enough to comment on it was Freeman and Condon's characters. Both actors did a great job with their parts, but...how many people would unconditionally take in some mystery man that they found on the streets who wouldn't even tell them his real name and who hid under the bed whenever they tried to bring him food? As much as I'd love to believe otherwise, pure-hearted philanthropists like that are one in a million, and the fact that Danny just happens to encounter two of them is almost too coincidental. Almost.  But everyone was so perfectly cast and the story flowed so smoothly that for 1 hour and 43 minutes I could just forget about that minor detail.

Unleashed has just the right mix of drama and action, with a nice touch of humor, to create a truly compelling movie. It takes fears and desires that many of us have felt before and portrays them in new and original context. Recommended for fans of music, Jet Li, or good movies in general.",1149206400,5,3063,4.826666666666667
2351345,4,B000A2IPQY,"""Unleashed"" is the tale of Danny (Jet Li) bred to be a killing machine. He wears a metal collar with little hasps and a catch on it: if the collar is released, he beats the Enemy to death.

That is his job, his purpose. He is exceedingly good at it

Until he finds out about the piano, and discovers there's more to life than treeing somebody else's quarry.

Now: ""Unleashed"" in many ways was poorly served by its trailer, which promised hyper-kinetic brutality, done fast and fierce and foolish, and delivered with skull-crunching finality by Jet Li (who plays Danny, the aforementioned Dog).

""Unleashed"" is much less than that---it really moves at a snail's pace for an actioner, which no doubt rendered it a real sleeper when audiences got impatient for the thing to deliver the skull-whacking goods---but it's also something much more.

""Unleashed"", for me, was a triple-roundhouse of the Unexpected: it's a marvellously intimate little flick, alternately brutal and tender, delivering at least four stunning performances (no, not Jet Li's feet and hands...sheesh), and serving up its engaging little tale with an unexpected dash of tenderness and whimsy.

It all goes down like a latter-day ""Oliver Twist"": Danny (Jet Li) plays the unwitting muscle to petty London crime-boss Bart (Bob Hoskins, who positively chomps the East-End scenery, strutting and fretting, screaming and spitting, and then getting all Mommy Dearest in a nasty motherly turn...brrrr). They drag him along to one extortion after another, and the business proposition is always the same: pay me, the collar stays on. Be difficult, the collar comes off, and Danny pounds you blokes into the pavement.

That is, until a well-heeled sadistic stranger gets a glimpse of Danny's rare art, and makes Bart a business proposition of a very different sort: bring the Dog to fight in a London gladiatorial arena and get paid top-dollar---er, top-Pound---for the bloodshed. Danny goes from being part of the show to the star attraction, but still has to sleep in a cage, wallow in his own blood, and eat oatmeal through a mesh screen. Where's Don King when ya need him?

Until a little unexpected vengeance---and a Deus Ex Machina with teeth---shows up, and Danny sets off alone into a forbidding world. And the movie either slows to a crawl, or really takes off, or a little of both, depending on your point of view.

Like ""Oliver"", Danny is set adrift in a world far less menacing---and certainly more confusing---than the one he knows, where he is at first tended by the goofy, awkward ministrations of Sam (Morgan Freeman, the only veteran actor I know who actually *chills*, man, *chills* when he chews scenery), a piano tuner, and his motormouth daughter Victoria (the delicious Kerry Condon, a quirky discovery).

Danny finds there is more to life than alternating bouts of bloodletting and idle disgrace: there is ice cream, and the piano, and music, and tenderness, and above all things, getting kissed.

The question is: will Bart and his vengeful Black Crew let him get away with a little R&R from Hell?

The really astonishing thing about ""Unleashed"" is just how good Jet Li is in this understated role: an exceptionally gifted physical actor, he can say more with furrowed brows and a glance than most can with reams of dialogue. Freeman and Condon are no slouches either; Freeman really gets his groove on with this oddly intimate little flick, and Condon sells the deal---or at least, just what is at stake.

But Bob Hoskins---my god!---Hoskins brings the flick alive with his Bart, a grim, grimy, feral, maniacal nightshade of a creature, a master manipulator, a man sunk so deeply in the Pit that he might even believe his own lies. How can tenderness and whimsy fare in the face of this white-suited Monster, who jockeys about his homely domain various ill-fated white luxury rides?

You'd be surprised.

Just goes to show that every dog really *does* have his day.

2351346,4,B000A2IPQY,"Trained from childhood to become a killing machine for a mobster (Bob Hoskins), Danny (Jet Li) is literally a caged animal. When bills need to be collected upon, the gang brings Danny along. If payment isn't made, they release him from his steel leash and Danny becomes a barbaric war machine of unspeakable fury, using lightning-quick hands, feet, elbows, head-butts, and any other tool at hand in staccato blasts. The gang always gets paid.

But when his boss crosses the wrong crew one day, Danny suddenly finds himself wounded badly, bewildered and homeless. With no social skills whatsoever, he staggers back to the scene of one of his recent battles, where a piano and a blind piano-tuner (Morgan Freeman) had briefly captured his attention. Bleeding profusely, Danny collapses at Sam's feet.

Recognizing that Danny has special needs, Sam and his adopted daughter nurse the youth back to health and begin to integrate him into polite society. Danny becomes a set of eyes for Sam, helping with chores like shopping and escorting Victoria back and forth to school. Over a period of weeks, Danny becomes an adoptive member of the family. It is on a typical daily shopping sojourn that one of the old gang spots Danny. It turns out that Bart, the boss, has survived to live another day. He wants his old enforcer back in the fold. And this is where things get really ugly.

Li, Hoskins and Freeman all do fine work here. Hoskins obviously has the part of Glasgow mobster mastered and you probably couldn't find a more convincing actor to play the role. Freeman is, well, Freeman. He's convincing without being overwhelming and is the warm, stable center of the film. And Li is not only a gifted fighter, he's also convincing as a human being raised in unspeakable living conditions. All told, the film is far more than a cookie-cutter action flick. It's enjoyable, escapist fun with some pretty fine acting to help drive the story.",1148860800,,1934,4.836858006042296
2351347,4,B000A2IPQY,"""Unleashed"" is dark and action-packed, combining elements of noir with martial arts.  While the premise may not be all that believable, it's already understood that when you see one of these movies, you're going to have to suspend the rules of reality to buy into it all.  If you do that, then you're on your way to enjoying a different type of fight/action movie.

Danny isn't your typical guy.  In fact, it's hard to find any signs of humanity in him as he's been brought up by a ruthless and heartless crime boss, who has literally brought Danny up as nothing more than a dog.  He uses Danny to do his dirty work.  When he takes the collar off, Danny does his bidding and turns into a violent killing machine.  When the collar is on, he's shy, harmless and not so responsive to the world outside of him.  When an ""accident"" happens where Danny is able to escape, he's taken care of by a blind piano tuner, Sam.  Him and his stepdaughter try to show Danny a life outside of the darkness.  Things get complicated when the crime boss wants Danny back, and is willing to do anything in his power to make it so.  In order to protect the ones he loves, Danny will have to transform himself into the fighting machine he was trained to be.

The action in the movie is very rapid and fast-pace, but they give you enough space for story and character development.  The look and feel of it really drags you into this dark and raw atmosphere, which is why we can buy into everything that happens.  Make no mistake, you're not going to walk away from ""Unleashed"" with the hopes of seeing a modern masterpiece, or something very thought-provoking and awe-inspiring.  It is an action movie with a cool twist to it and nothing more.  Take it for what it is and you'll be able to appreciate it for what it is.

As violent as this movie can get, I was actually expecting more carnage and mayhem, although I have to say that the fight sequences that are in the movie are stunning and amazing.  Jet Li has all of the moves and nobody can take that away from him.  Also, it was neat to see an action movie presented in such a fashion that I hadn't experienced before.  Again, the story may not be completely plausible, but does it really have to be?  In this kind of movie, you realize that anything goes.  It's a question of if you're allowed to be dragged into the movie and go for the ride.  The DVD includes some behind the scenes featurettes, music videos, and also allows you to watch the Unrated version or the Extended version.  I don't know what the difference is, so I just went along with the Unrated version.

""Unleashed"" is a dark and enjoyable action flick with a very nice overall presentation.  Those who don't like violent fight movies would be wise to stay away, but for everybody else I can honestly say it's worth giving it a shot.  It's not a masterpiece, but it is something.  It's nice to see that the same thing isn't being done over and over again and that people are using different approaches and presentations to these martial arts movies.  -Michael Crane",1148601600,,3065,4.432915921288014
2351348,4,B000A2IPQY,"After getting stuck in a few pointless, hip-hop flavored actioners paired with DMX, Jet Li finds himself in the best film he's starred in in years.

Naturally, Bart and his goons come looking for Danny, who soon proves that you can teach an old dog new tricks.  While the action is brilliantly coreographed, it's Li's sympathetic and vulnerable turn as the tortured Danny that makes Unleashed worth checking out, and Hoskins is a rabid dog himself as the obscenity spewing gangster.

2351349,4,B000A2IPQY,"Unleashed (Louis Leterrier, 2005)

What a surprising little film this is; Luc Besson's script is the best he's turned in since Leon, Jet Li gives us evidence he can actually handle a dramatic role that involves more than hitting things, Bob Hoskins is back in form after a string of mediocre-at-best movies, and who's this Louis Leterrier guy? (A funny name for someone directing a movie called Unleashed, no?) And the bets part about it is, they make you feel like an idiot pretty early into the movie, and you can't help but appreciate them for it.

Danny (Li) is, for lack of a better term, an indentured servant to mob boss Uncle Bart (Hoskins), who keeps him on a collar-- unless he wants someone hurt or killed. Then the collar comes off, and Danny attacks. All this changes when Danny has a chance encounter with a blind piano tuner, Sam (Morgan Freeman).

The trailers for this movie made it seem like it was going to be your basic brainless action film, and so does the first twenty minutes. This is where Besson and Leterrier are deceiving you; it's anything but, and it turns out to be the most pleasant of surprises. Oh, don't worry, there are still a whole lot of fights, but they're not the focus of the film; Danny here is reminiscent of Mathilda (Natalie Portman) in Leon, so you know Besson's on solid ground in his script, and he treads it well.

If you decided to avoid this film because it looked like your basic action picture, reconsider. One of the most pleasant surprises I've had in the past few years. ****",1147910400,2,1532,4.5398550724637685
2351350,1,B000A2IPQY,"This movie is pretty terrible.  I've seen pornos that have better plots than this.  Basically Jet Li is this dude's personal one-man-army on a leash, and whenever his owner removes the leash Jet Li hands out beat downs.  Eventually Morgan Freeman's character befriends Li, and teaches Li about art and culture.  In the process Li learns to appreciate human life, and decides he doesn't want to fight anymore.  However Li is forced to either defend himself or die, as he is literally thrown into battles throughout the movie.  The storyline is corny to begin with, and the acting is subpar as well.

The fight scenes are well done though.  Some of the moves Li pulls off are amazing, but they aren't enough to save the movie. I painfully watched about 30-45 min of this movie before I gave up on it.  After that I just fast forwarded to all the fight scenes.

If you are a die hard fan of martial arts movies you might appreciate ""Unleashed"" more that I do.  I admit that I'm not the biggest fan of martial arts movies.  However, I am a fan of good movies in general, and ""Unleashed"" definitely does not belong in that category.

PS-Even though I don't like this movie, I can't deny that Jet Li is a bad a**.  I don't know of any other 120 lb dudes that could beat me up, but Jet Li would definitely kick my a**.

Li plays Danny, a near ""dog"" to his cruel benefactor, the malicious Bob Hoskins, in a strong performance.  Li is surprisingly effective as the childlike Danny, who when he is ""unleashed"" is a mad dog to say the least.

Along with Freeman's teenage daughter, Victoria (Kerry Condon, quite charming), Danny learns to play the piano, cook, eat ice cream and shop.  Fate intervenes though when the supposedly dead Hoskins turns up alive and wants his dog back.

UNLEASHED has some brutal action sequences, which are stunningly choreographed, and it has some incredulous plot lines, but Li is so convincing and the chance to see him have a real family so poignant, you can forgive UNLEASHED its minor flaws.

2351379,5,B000A2IPQY,"ugh, you people who are giving bad reviews to this movie with such childish and unsympathetic and narrow-minded reasons make me sick. you're all the typical ""mindless violence, no emotion"" movie-goers. how about you try to be a little empathic for once in your lives? you think that entertainment should just be non-stop action with no human emotion or thought. well, i have news for you: deep emotion  and understanding is what makes you, me, and all the world human. so maybe the next time you watch this movie you should be a little more open-minded and caring about the human condition and the effects of such extreme circumstances. and there actually have been extreme cases where young children have been raised as dogs... by dogs. children who act just as any stray dog might. even, literally, growling and barking, without the ability to speak. so, you see, it's not so far-fetched as you so many of you seem to think. the human mind is flexible and multi-tiered, which is what this movie is trying to portray. but you obviously didn't understand the movie or Jet Li's character, saying that he changes in the blink of an eye. which, to even the casually intelligent and perceptive observer, is quite untrue. from the very beginning of the movie i could see that deep down Danny did not want to be what he was. he always had that desire for something more (emotionally) and at the same time, something less bellicose and noisome. he had this readily evident passion and inclination for music, apparent due to his fascination with the pianos in the antiques shop basement. music was his soft side, his human side; and it's what he yearned for at all times until his collar was taken off. then his base, violent animal side took over his whole self. and he became the killer dog he was trained to be. so when Sam came into his life and brought with him the music that he craved so much it *brought out* his soft, human side. it wasn't just magically there and it wasn't an instant transformation either. seeing as how he beats and kills a few more guys after that before he really becomes human again. and even after he regains his humanity he beats the hell out of a bunch of guys. if you watch the behind the scenes, Morgan Freeman speaks of the ""juxtaposition of the violence and non-violence."" and it is this theme, of the truly violent but at the same time loving and kind nature that exists within all of us, that i think attracted Freeman to this film. and in my opinion this juxtaposition is beautifully done. i love movies and stories where human nature is pushed to such extremes, especially when they're filled with such love and compassion, and such anger and violence; such opposing emotions that co-mingle and blend and fight one another and then ultimately co-exist to form, not a well-rounded individual, but more of a bumpy elliptical human being. because who in all the world is truly well-rounded? we all have our ups and our downs and our shadow-selves that must be delt with. so please view this movie as what it is: a tour through the human soul. and not what it definitely isn't: your merely typical, mindless ""feux-uber-American/British-Kung Fu"" movie entertainment. but i agree, it did end a bit abruptly. (not as abruptly, though, as The Goblet of Fire) and i would've liked to see a little more development and delving of Danny's life and hardships and personality before he met Sam and his daughter. but i understand that movies have time constraints and budgets so i'll forgive them. i also think there was some wonderful acting in this movie. Morgan Freeman was great, of course. (even though his character did seem like a Ray Charles wannabe, as previously stated, but that wasn't his fault) Jet Li, in my opinion, was absolutely magnificent. this is the most (and best) *acting* i've ever seen him do. he wonderfully portrayed a stray dog in human form, living with new, unknown people who are family, *not* owners. he was shy, skiddish, terrified, and warm and eager for knowledge and new things all in the right places and with remarkably convincing acting. i haven't seen a lot of his movies, but i've seen a few. and this has to be one of his best. one random thing: to the person who spoke poorly of the fact that the daughter accepted him right off even though he acted like a thief who's just been caught. if you had paid attention it was mentioned that Danny had been there unconscious for two days. meaning that she would have already known he was there and Sam definitely would have described what kind of person he was. so she knew what to expect, really, when she first came into contact with him. Bob Hoskins also did a wonderful job as your quintessential slimy, evil petty thug Boss. a man who's in the lower-middle ranks of the organized crime world and trying to scrape his way higher. and to all of you who say you didn't like the martial arts in the movie. well, that's because there isn't really any martial arts. because as Danny is essentially a dog, he essentially fights like a dog: savage and brutal and unorganized, attacking whoever is closest first and sticking with them (for the most part) until they're out of the fight, then switching his focus to the next closest opponent. overall, i found this to be a marvelously enjoyable film and will be recommending it to all my movie enthusiast friends and family. i am liking ROGUE Pictures very much after Shaun of the Dead and Unleashed. thank you to all who read this whole thing and kindly listen to what i have to say.",1139097600,9,5536,4.626016260162602
2351380,5,B000A2IPQY,"What happens when a person is raised from childhood to be the perfect killing machine?  With no moral compass, no knowledge of right or wrong?  Simply conditioned to obey one man's commands to commit horrible acts of violence.  These questions are posed and answered in the newest film starring Jet Li (""Hero"" and ""Lethal Weapon 4"") and Morgan Freeman (""Batman Begins"" and ""Se7en""), ""Unleashed"".

""Unleashed"" is the story of Danny (Jet Li), a man raised to basically be a brutal attack dog for a gangster named Bart (Bob Hoskins).  Bart raised Danny from childhood under barbaric conditions and abuse, all in an effort to create a person with no self-respect or independence, also to have no knowledge beyond that of a toddler in terms of what is right and wrong.  Really the only thing Danny knows is how to kill other people at the behest of his 'Uncle' Bart.  After living this way for years, fate intervenes on behalf of Danny in the form of a car accident that appears to have claimed his uncle's life.  With no family to take him in, a blind piano repairman (Morgan Freeman) along with his stepdaughter, take Danny into their home, and begin to show him the world outside of the brutality he is accustomed to.  Living a peaceful life with his new family, Danny begins to come out of his shell and experience all of the great things life has to offer.  But it seems that fate has a cruel sense of humor, as Danny's evil 'Uncle' Bart didn't die after all, and is looking for his former 'dog'.  Now Danny must choose between the past that haunts him or the new family that loves him.

""Unleashed"" would without a doubt have to be one of the biggest surprises in terms of enjoying a movie for me.  I normally don't like Jet Li's movies, at least not the ones where he is the main star, but this one was a very pleasant surprise.  Truth be told the only reason I gave ""Unleashed"" a chance is because of Morgan Freeman and Bob Hoskins.  I figured with these two accomplished actors in the movie, it must have some possibility for greatness.  Written by Luc Besson (writer of ""La Femme Nikita"" and ""Leon:  The Professional""), whose trademark fusion of sentiment and violence serves perfectly to propel this movie along, creating the perfect movie environment for Jet Li to finally show off his acting ability, not just his martial arts prowess.  Outstanding action scenes that will rattle you to the bone, with just the right amount of drama and humanity to elevate ""Unleashed"" from your standard run-of-the-mill action/martial arts movie to an action/drama that is extremely effective and entertaining.

Fans of martial arts movies will definitely not be disappointed with ""Unleashed"", and those who aren't generally too keen on watching just another martial arts movie should really give this movie a chance before forming a premature judgment.

""Unleashed"" is available in both rated and unrated versions.  I haven't seen the unrated version, but I have read that there are some differences in several scenes being either shortened or extended, or completely new scenes added in.

""Unleashed"" is rated R for violence, language, and sexuality/brief nudity.  The unrated version contains all of the elements listed for the R rating.",1138924800,5,3232,4.815217391304348
2351381,4,B000A2IPQY,"Unleashed was written by Luc Besson, the man responsible for some unique action films (La Femme Nikita, The Professional, and The Fifth Element) as well as a few train wrecks (The Transporter and The Messenger painfully spring to mind). This time Besson falls back on the basic outline he created in La Femme Nikita and The Professional: emotionally dead action hero(ine) finds his/her humanity. It's kind of like The Professional, but with a feral Jet Li and not quite as much pedophilia.

In my opinion, this is the first successful American Jet Li movie. It is about time someone wrote an actual character for him. Supposedly Besson wrote the script with Jet Li in mind, and I kind of wish Besson had directed the movie as well. At times the director at the helm doesn't know what to do when the action slows down, and assuming no one has an attention span, he reverts to quick cuts and wacky camera techniques. I must admit, though, that when the action begins he seems to know what he's doing.

This films has great choreography, and if anyone is actually bored with the attempts at characterization, they should be pleased when the music starts to pick up. These fight scenes are brutal. The director seems to relish the cringe inducing sounds accompanied by people getting bitten, hit in the crotch, and (my personal favorite) getting head-butted.

The music is provided by Massive Attack, and while it probably won't be a great soundtrack on its own it's interesting enough without being distracting. It also is a unique use of electronic music in an action film that doesn't just turn the base up when the action starts.

Oh, yeah, and it turns out that Jet Li is actually an actor! I would never have guessed because not a single American film has treated him like one. Here he does a good job that could easily have been laughable. Bob Hoskin is great in just about everything he does, and this is no exception. Of course a movie like this it dips into sentimentality once or twice, but thanks to Morgan Freeman it doesn't get out of hand.

I have been starving for a good action movie for a while, and it's nice to finally find sustenance. The movie has its share of flaws (don't even ask about all the stuff that's unexplained), but that's a small complaint when there's a unique premise and some great action.",1138665600,2,2323,4.642335766423358
2351382,4,B000A2IPQY,"This is probably the best Jet Li movie I have ever seen. I haven't seen many but most of them appeared to be long on chop socky and short on anything intelligent. You can see Luc Bessons hands all over this movie and because of this the movie has depth. It has its violence and incredible fight sequences but it also has emotion and tender moments. A friend of mine who couldn't wait to see it because he is a big Jet Li fan said, "" I thought I was going to see a Jet Li movie and I ended up watching a chick flick"". I liked the blending of the two. Also Bob Hoskins as the evil villian is GREAT.",1138579200,2,596,3.9338842975206614
2351383,5,B000A2IPQY,"As a movie critic and wanna-be filmmaker, I have particular tastes on how the camera moves, the emotions that must be seen onscreen, the music that is used, and how engaging a story must be. With that in mind, I have movies that are in my ""favorites"" list because they achieve one facet or another of my tastes.  ""Unleashed"" is one of the few films that achieves them all.  With that in mind, my review may be somewhat misleading for I don't think this is a film that would please everyone.  But it has to be said, I LOVE this movie.  If I were to make an action film, it would be ""Unleashed"".

The trailer alone had me intrigued.  It portrayed Danny (Jet-Li) as the subject all first-year Psychology majors would talk about.  Then I realized it was a ""chop-socky"" film produced by Hollywood.  My expectations dropped significantly... but this was all to be premature disappointment.

The movie is about an extortionist named Bart (Bob Hoskins, in what seems to be his best performance in a long time) who has been successful in his business by having the ultimate killer dog.  It's been done before.  You train a dog to be nice and docile while his collar is on.  But when you take it off, he becomes a ruthless, almost rabid killing machine.  What Bart has done differently is to use a man instead of a dog.  Danny (Jet-Li) was trained by Bart since boyhood to be a docile puppy with adorable demeanor so long as his collar is worn.  But once his collar is taken off he is a sadistic martial-arts mastered killer who blindly obeys his master.

This situation alone would have made a decent action film.  But the mix was thrown to better pastures when Danny finds himself apparently master-less and winds up in the care of a blind piano tuner named Sam (Morgan Freeman)  who shifts Danny's world from a cold gritty place to a warm quilted bed with milk and cookies by it.  Danny also finds a friend in Victoria (Kerry Condon), whose further innocence propels him into a world he had never seen, and experiences genuine kindness for the first time.

What I projected before me in the theater was a mixture of several film genres seamlessly meshed together.  It was brilliant.  It had the gritty character of ""Snatch"" and the heart of ""Good Will Hunting"".  Throw in the now patented Yuen Wo Ping kung-fu action (refreshingly almost sans ""wire-fu"") and the eccentric urban music of Massive Attack and you've got an unbelievably unique action movie that seems to have escaped the `90s where it would have been ahead of it's time.

Jet-Li brings his best performance since ""Hero"".  Good direction pays off for Jet-Li's limited acting abilities are used to an advantage as he plays the collared Danny.  Movements are exaggerated but innocent.  Emotional reactions are simplistic but appropriate.  Bob Hoskins plays a believable Bart, who has an unruly demeanor yet has a true affection for his human dog.  Morgan Freeman is masterful as usual as Sam, who plays the part perfectly and makes the movie work.

But if I were to pick one element that would make this film stand out from all other action movies, it would be the fixation on the piano.  Once Danny was being taught to play ""Habanera"" I knew this film was something special.  It was easily the brightest and most subtlety shining movie-moment I have seen in a long time.  The inclusion and importance of Mozart's ""Sonata in A K331"" (one of my personal favorites) made this movie all the more so rich in charm.

""Unleashed"" brings my faith back in action movies and is, in my opinion, the way things should be done.",1137801600,2,3568,4.6289808917197455
2351384,3,B000A2IPQY,"Jet Li (Kiss of the Dragon, The One) plays Danny who at a very young age was taken away by the sinister Bob Hoskins (Who Framed Roger Rabbit?, Super Mario Bros The Movie) who beat and made Danny into a ferocious fighting and killing machine when he takes the collar off around his neck. On a job at the antiques store, Danny is sidetracked when he meets a blind man played by none other then the great Morgan Freeman (Se7en, Batman Begins). Freeman teaches him notes on the piano. When his master Hoskins gets shot up, Danny leaves him and goes to Freeman and Freeman and his step-daughter Victoria, played by Kerry Condon (Ned Kelly, Intermission) try to get Danny to do normal every day things. Victoria sees a real man inside of Danny and she even takes off his collar and he doesnt attack her. But Danny cant escape Hoskins as he is brought back to him and he even doesnt want to kill people anymore. So he escapes Hoskins again, going back to Freeman and he tries to find out more about his mother because she died when he was little. The action is intense and raw and Jet Li is outstanding both in the bone crunching action sequences (unrated version is more crunching) and also when he isn't fighting...Li really is that good. Freeman is the wise old blind black man piano teacher (was he trying to do Ray Charles or something? I know he was half blind in Million Dollar Baby, here he's fully blind) Condon is also impressive and Hoskins got that snarling look in his eye....I was like, hey look, Mario is trying to be mean. This delivers the goods and who then Luc Besson to deliver them in his written. Surely better then some of the sludge that came out last year.",1137110400,,1674,4.4207119741100325
2351395,1,B000A2IPQY,"I would give NO star if there's an option. The story line is very very BAD. I didn't see much of the fighting...maybe only 1 or 2. Even the Karate Kid did fight more!!

It's the best....well before the ""Tom Yum Goong"" or Onk-Bak part II released. He's the only one who use No stunts.",1136937600,,463,4.333333333333333
2351396,3,B000A2IPQY,"This film was recommended to me by a friend; otherwise, I would certainly have completely passed it by. I was aware of the film, It's just I found the basic premise to be a little...ah hum...""far fetched"" for my taste.

I was still apprehensive as the opening credits began to roll, but I soon noticed Luc Beeson's name attached, and for me that gave a reassuring level of credibility to the film. Unfortunately, despite Beeson's alchemistic-like reputation for turning lead into gold, my skepticism returned as the opening sequences veered from unbelievable to just plain ridicules. The acting was trite, the imagery bleak, and the storyline was down-right banal, but in-the-end, I guess Beeson's gift is that he is somehow able to persuade you into accepting that a film does not necessarily have to be deep or even make much sense in order to be entertaining.

About 15 minutes into it I abandoned any hope of finding any redeeming quality and decided to just accept that I was going to waste approximately two hours of my life. Oddly enough, I found that after succumbing to this vulgar, yet strangely endearing mess it began to coalesce into something quite compelling. For it is only after abandoning logic that you understand that this is pure escapist fantasy and really designed for nothing other than to separate you from your so called logical thinking and obsession with time.

Ok...so therefore the whole thing wasn't a bust, but I'll never get back that 15 minutes I wasted thinking this movie was actually trying (but failing miserably) to be something profound.

All Luc Beeson projects should come with this warning up front:

In order to enjoy this film, you should not take ""it""...or your time very seriously!",1136851200,,1728,4.904109589041096
2351397,4,B000A2IPQY,"This is a solid action film.  The fight scenes are amazingly choreographed and the locales used for shooting the movie are gritty and grimey and add to the ""doglike"" existence that Danny has been confined to.

This movie really allowed Jet Li to display his acting skills.  He gives a heartfelt performance as a man who has been conditioned to hurt people on command by a wannabe Godfather-type gangster.  He shares some very touching scenes with Sam (Morgan Freeman) and his step-daughter, played by Kerry Condon.  Good action, good drama and solid acting makes this a worthwhile movie.

The Bonus Material includes a few featurettes, a video by Massive Attack and a miserable video by the RZA.  Other than the RZA's weak contribution, the bonus features are very entertaining, providing extensive insight into the development of the film.",1135900800,6,840,5.043478260869565
2351398,5,B000A2IPQY,"Unleashed tells the tragic tale of a man who has been enslaved literally as a dog for most of his life. His captor/master, Uncle Bart, utilizes Danny's lethal fighting skills to supply the brawn for his selfsih financial gain and underground criminal machinations(entering Danny into human fighting arena matches--- the equivalent of illegal dogfights---afterall, Danny IS a dog to Bart).Uncle Bart is no uncle. He collects from those who owe him big time. Any trouble, and Bart unleashes Danny as insurance to collect his profits!...When not being used as a killing machine, Danny spends his time in an imprisoned hell beneath a caged floor in Bart's central lair. He looks at a child's book. Whether he can read or not is another matter. The book is very symbolic like a timepiece or watch that has been stopped by an outside traumatic and blunt force. The book is a painful remnant of the early age and childhood that was stolen or stopped by something or someone. As a viewer you want to know how Bart acquired Danny like a prize fighting bulldog or an enslaved subhuman creature for his sadistic musings. What is Bart's connection to Danny's past?It is a very important marker in his life. Soon, Danny begins to question his self worth and wants answers about his past,family,mother, which he has no clear recollection due to early childhood trauma. Danny is asking the kind of questions Uncle Bart doesn't like. Bart always finds ways to deflect those questions...Then, an event occurs which releases Danny from the vile clutches of Bart into the free world. Danny is befriended by a blind man named Sam and his daughter Victoria who take him in. Sam, a piano tuner and restorer, is the father figure and mentor that Danny so desperately needs in his life. Sam is the voice of reason,logic,intelligence and civilized culture. He begins to instill in Danny his true worth as a human being as a man in the realm of human civility. Is Danny's new found family and freedom too good to be true, is it all a cruel hoax? Will something from his past catch up to him that will destroy his new world and family? With the help of Sam and Victoria, Danny begins to put the pieces into the puzzle in the hopes that he can locate his mother for more answers to his childhood and enslavement. However, time is running out, as a dark shadow of the past is about to catch up to him....

Unleashed is absolutely not what I expected. In fact, the first 15-20 minutes, at least to me, began to bore an uncanny resemblance to Guy Ritchie's Snatch. Right down to having a British character whose street dialect was difficult to decode at times (Bob Hoskins as Uncle Bart). Some of the comical and sarcastic banter between Bart and his thugs resembles that type of comedic angle used in Snatch. The music provided by Massive Attack also gave an ambient feel of the similar music used in Snatch. Fighting sound effects are slightly muted to almost non existant. Massive Attack is not only the soundtrack music but also the effects for this film's key fighting sequences! Low and behold, Unleashed is no Snatch. All similarites end there...Instead, Luc Besson's film style(despite the fact only being credited as a writer or producer) is stamped all over. Think of a male version of the French original La Femme Nikita with it's industrial and gritty look and feel. It's the pygmallion theory put into effect for a man. There are also tones of Leon;The Professional presently and sporadically placed throughout Unleashed. It's all very stylized but for the story's soul purpose and not for superficial show.

Jet Li over the years has developed a popular cult(an oxymoron?) status for those who like martial arts action films with pretty good and palpable story lines. He is not Jackie Chan. Nothing against Chan, but Li adds that innate quality that keeps his audience's attention. His dialogue in  most films is very limited. What he does express is the meaning of those words through his intense eyes and powerful physical fighting gestures. Chan's acting and martial arts skills are often too smooth,choreagraphed,and just downright lighthearted that say, ""I'm an entertainer"". Li's all seem to say, ""I take this all very seriously and to heart!"" Just two completely different martial arts actors with different styles. Jet Li's moves are more raw and natural, and still manage to hit the target...As for his acting skills, he does turn in a much more stable and better performance than what I have seen him turn in in the past (including Hero, though Hero was a cinematic work of art in it's own rights).Don't be fooled, but there is an intense underlying emotive quality ( maybe not in this film for some) that in a future project, he will unleash(please, no pun intended) stronger acting capabilities...

While Morgan Freeman's Sam may be playing second fiddle to Li's character, he still handles his limited screen time persona with all the finesse and dedication of a true actor. Sometimes showing less is more. He could have turned in an over-the-top performance as a blind man a la Ray Charles/Jamie Foxx. He didn't. He could have hogged the screen, yet he humbled his role quite a bit. Afterall, it is the actor's service to contribute to the story telling of a film and not the other way around (can't always be the larger than life central character).It's refreshing to see most major and seasoned actors take these small screen time character roles. It shows that they have not grown into a swollen head and that they strongly believe in their craft. It was a wonderful performance piece. I liked it very much!

Bob Hoskins portrays one nasty son of a gun the likes I have never seen him play before (maybe I have missed one of his past films as the bad guy,don't know).His thick British,cockney street lingo is so thick , yet so befitting for his role. To think this was a role that would have gone to Anthony (Hannibal Lecter)Hopkins or Michael Caine. Both of those actors are too dignified and a tad laid back to play the level of nastiness and under the surface level of sarcastic comedic wit required for Uncle Bart. I mean all of this in a complimentary and of utmost respectful way to Bob Hoskins and his acting chops! By comedic, just look at the scenes where Bart has to do his own fighting due to Danny's ""lack"" of obedience or absence. Bart looks downright like a bumbling buffoon. Glad Hoskin's (not Hopkins) got the role!

If anything, just see Unleashed for it also contains very strong emotional elements and twists that actually surprised me for a Li film. The closing or ending fade out scene with Li is a heartbreaking one that is both undeniably memorable and a stamp of approval that Li can act !",1135382400,,6713,4.738237810094097
2351399,5,B000A2IPQY,"I think people are looking to far into this movie.  Of course it could never happen and the story is not to original. Is it entertaining? yes very much so. Does Jet Lee kick ass and take names? He does some of his most brutal fighting ever. Does the supporting cast breath life to the script. Of course, Bob Hoskins and Morgan Freeman should allready be in the actors hall of fame.

2351400,5,B000A2IPQY,"Hong Kong Kung fu man Jet Li along with Bob Hoskins and Morgan Freeman in a movie together? I looked at the cover and said, is this a typo on the cover? Seriously? Freeman? Shawshank Redemption was in my head here. And I see Jet Li on the cover. HMMM... Sounds odd for anyone who knows movies, but believe it or not, it turned out to be a fantastic movie. Now we come to Bob Hoskins. Bob Hoskins is mostly remembered for playing the lead role as (Detective Valiant) in Who Framed Roger Rabbit as the alcoholic detective. It's been a long time since he's really done anything and it was nice to see him again as I feel he's one of the better actors out there. Too bad he's a bad guy this time, but he's still great on-screen.

Morgan Freeman, a bit out of his norm here, meshed quite well with the action star Jet Li. The scenes between Morgan and Jet Li are acutally very touching to the soul but don't think this is a drama movie, this is still action, but having Morgan Freeman along for the ride is a nice addition.

The storyline doesn't look very good on paper, but it turned out fine onscreen. Danny (Jet Li) is a man raised to be a brutal human attack dog controlled by his boss (Bob Hoskins). He didn't know any other life, until he met Morgan Freeman. Freeman showed him a normal life, and expressed there is more to life than just killing and serving a cruel boss. The scenes with Morgan and Li are simple breaks from the rest of the action and violence the movie offers. But it works somehow and I was glued to the movie without question.

The movie is basically 50% action, the rest with Freeman and Li is him enjoying his new life without the dog collar. Jet lie enjoying ice cream, cooking, shopping in groceries, learning to play and tune pianos, and a little relationship with a young beautiful blonde. Weird? Yes. Works? Yes. But don't jump to conclusions here, action fans will love it too.  The action scenes are fantastic, no computer generated graphics, just some simply fantastic fight sequences. This unrated version is violent for sure, but it's not anything we haven't seen before, so you know what to expect. Good music, good acting, and the bond between Li and Freeman works very well. It is true that opposites attract!",1134864000,2,2247,4.433414043583535
2351401,2,B000A2IPQY,"I have seen both the R and Unrated version and this review speaks to both versions.  I was quite surprised to see the positive reviews of this movie. I am a big Li fan and really enjoy his movies. This movie doesn't work for me and is quite corny, borderline Van Dam'ish or (recent) Seagal movie. To know where I'm coming from, I enjoy realistic (as realistic as you can get with these movies) fighting scenes. Although exaggerated for the big screen, you can still see the basis/foundation of the Li's fighting moves which I always enjoy. I never go into these movies expecting Oscar winning plot lines and acting, but there has to be a minimal level of each to support the fighting. The problem is the contrast between Morgan Freeman and Jet Li. You can't help but wonder ""What is Morgan Freeman doing in this movie?"" He's a very good actor that seems so out of place (he's too good). Jet Li's acting through the transition of his character from pure animal that will wipe out an army at the snap of a finger to a soft spoken uber-kind victim is way off. There are these soft, sappy, corny scenes when Li meets up with Morgan and his ""daughter"" that are unwatchable...I'm on the Fast Forward button through all this (because it just went on way too long)..there is no place for the soft side of Jet Li in these movies, except to be funny, e.g., Romeo Must Die or to mourn the death of a love one which triggers a massacre. Also, writer/director never develop Li's character enough for you to sympathize or feel his pain. Of course what happened to him was bad, but it just isn't enough to tie it all together. The whole piano thing is ...well..who knows--you'll judge for yourself if you watch the movie. In the end, I shouldn't even have to think this much when I watch these movies--that's not the point. The point is butt kicking (maybe even a little comedy) and good Kung Fu. It's worth catching on cable (for the fight scenes), but it is definitely not worth owning on DVD or buying on PPV.

2351402,5,B000A2IPQY,"this is a superb action movie from the mind of writer luc besson, who fans will doubtless remember from other great genre-bending action flicks like ""the fifth element"" and ""leon"" (aka ""the cleaner"" and ""the professional"").

the world of the film is gritty, grey, and highly stylized, evocative of the criminal underworld that li's character danny inhabits at the beginning of the film. li's command of the character is impressive, as he plays both danny's disarming childlike qualities and his uncontrolled animal nature with equal believability. li also brings a lot of humour to the part as danny gradually discovers how to live in human society. danny captures the audience's sympathy with ease.  the film features several other strong performances, including those of freeman and condon, whose portrayals of danny's adoptive family paint these characters as intelligent, kind, and charitable without becoming overly maudlin. hoskins is brutal and manipulative as danny's ""uncle"" bart, although the character is also revealed to be relatively helpless without the aid of danny's fighting skills.

the plot moves quickly, plunging headlong to the film's conclusion, and though it contains elements of mystery and intrigue concerning danny's true identity, it cannot be denied that the ultimate draw of the film comes from its unique characters and violent, over-the-top action sequences that leave the viewer's heart pounding. as always, it is a pleasure to watch li show off his martial arts skills. however, li's fighting ""style"" in this film displays none of the discipline or finesse seen in his other work; instead, he literally fights like a dog, brutally maiming his opponents. the fact that this does not detract from the audience's sympathy for the character is a testament to li's incredible charisma. the film's violence is horrifyingly realistic, as in the death sports arena where fighters battle to the finish for the amusement and financial gain of spectators. one of the films' most exciting scenes takes place in this arena, after ""uncle"" bart has retrieved danny from his adoptive family. danny is at first reluctant to fight, opting to use defensive moves only (a staple of many martial arts movies that distinguishes the hero from the villains), but eventually he cracks skulls in an attempt to save his own life.

the film is equally exciting and touching, displaying besson's ability to write both action-oriented and emotionally satisfying content. while the plot is certainly not without its imperfections, and in many ways plot elements and in-depth character development take a back seat to explosive violence, this film is still an incredibly well done action movie that all fans of luc besson and jet li will enjoy.",1134432000,,2746,5.248291571753986
2351403,4,B000A2IPQY,"Given I saw it on PPV, I'll assume I got the Rated version as opposed to the more gruesome (or so i hear) Unrated version. I can see where people might get turned off by the story, since it involves a lot of nice fighting in the first quarter of the film, but then goes on for a big part of the movie to illustrate the relationship that builds between the Morgan Freeman character (who seems strangely out of place here) and Jet Li. Ultimately, the fighting does pick up - which of course is one of the main reasons behind wanting to watch a Jet Li movie in the first place - but this ""inaction gap"" is pretty evident.

Firstly, although the fighting can be intense, it seems hampered by the movie's R rating. An all-out, uncensored depiction of the action is definitely the way to go, so if the ""unrated"" version's like that, I'd go with that. Secondly, your liking of this flick will depend highly on whether or not you appreciate the long-winded story between Jet Li, Morgan Freeman, and his daughter, which has a clear purpose of putting the movie's fight scenes on the backburner - a good or bad thing depending on what you signed up for.

In the end, I didn't mind the change of pace and enjoyed how these separate characters serve to try and redeem Jet Li from his troubled past. The ongoing (predictable?) clash between Li and his previous master (played excellently by a Bob Hoskins) is also developed well until the end, where we get a fantastic showdown between Li and his oppressors.

Not the best Jet Li flick, but it's got great fight scenes, and it's a pretty fun movie overall.",1133913600,4,1593,4.448630136986301
2351404,4,B000A2IPQY,"I marginally recommend the movie. The movie's premise is far fetched, but writers and actors do what they can with it. A gangster keeps a man captive like a vicious attack dog. Li's character, Danny, is leashed during the day and caged at night. When the leash comes off, he is preconditioned to attack anything Hoskins tells him to. The driving force in this movie is how Jet Li's character becomes human again. Jet Li is starting to show some emotional range. His humility, which allows him to play dumb and silly, serves him well here. His charisma really shines through. The fights scenes are very good. The ferocious intensity he displays during the fight scenes early in the movie is incredible. The skill he shows in the last fight scenes is impressive.

Freeman and Hoskins are very good. The dialog is okay. The sets and backgrounds are good. The movie met my meager expectations and I enjoyed it.",1133481600,2,906,4.69811320754717
2351405,2,B000A2IPQY,"I was quite surprised to see the positive reviews of this movie.  I am a big Li fan and really enjoy his movies.  This movie doesn't work for me and is quite corny, borderline Van Dam'ish or (recent) Seagal movie.  To know where I'm coming from, I enjoy realistic (as realistic as you can get with these movies) fighting scenes.  Although exaggerated for the big screen, you can still see the basis/foundation of the Li's fighting moves which I always enjoy. I never go into these movies expecting Oscar winning plot lines and acting, but there has to be a minimal level of each to support the fighting.  The problem is the contrast between Morgan Freeman and Jet Li.  You can't help but wonder ""What is Morgan Freeman doing in this movie?""  He's a very good actor that seems so out of place (he's too good).  Jet Li's acting through the transition of his character from pure animal that will wipe out an army at the snap of a finger to a soft spoken uber-kind victim is way off.  There are these soft, sappy, corny scenes when Li meets up with Morgan and his ""daughter"" that are unwatchable...I'm on the Fast Forward button through all this (because it just went on way too long)..there is no place for the soft side of Jet Li in these movies, except to be funny, e.g., Romeo Must Die or to mourn the death of a love one which triggers a massacre.  Also, writer/director never develop Li's character enough for you to sympathize or feel his pain.  Of course what happened to him was bad, but it just isn't enough to tie it all together.  The whole piano thing is ...well..who knows--you'll judge for yourself if you watch the movie.  In the end, I shouldn't even have to think this much when I watch these movies--that's not the point.  The point is butt kicking (maybe even a little comedy) and good Kung Fu.  It's worth catching on cable (for the fight scenes), but it is definitely not worth owning on DVD or buying on PPV.

2351406,5,B000A2IPQY,"This all-star cast seemed to make Jet Li's acting come out.

But still there was awesome action sequences in it that will thrill all Hong Kong action freaks - or, better yet - The Matrix fans - into submitting on their knees that Jet Li is unequivicably today's Bruce Lee.

But here, Jet Li's acting is clearly improving. A fantastic, and sometimes eye-popping movie that will surprise some people.

I dragged my wife to this one, (who didn't even want to see it, mind you!), and she absolutely loved it!

A great and absorbing storyline, along with great actors, and with action sequences of various kinds - all add up to a solid movie going experience. I've bought it on DVD, and it looks great on my 65-inch HD TV.",1133222400,3,717,4.492307692307692
2351407,3,B000A2IPQY,"The publicity for this film claimed that Jet Li's fight scenes were 'so intense that test audiences were leaping out of their seats'. Well, I didn't find it to be that way. Danny the Dog (I simply refused to call it Unleashed) works best as a character drama with only a few silly fight scenes in between.

Writer Luc Besson gave Jet Li a choice of either doing a sequel to Kiss of the Dragon or something a bit more serious. Li opted for serious and Besson wrote the script exclusively for him. With the director of The Transporter giving the orders one would expect this film really kick ass. Instead it merely smacks bum.

Danny is an orphaned boy taken in by mob boss Bart (Bob Hoskins in a role that Albert Finney, Michael Caine and Brain Cox turned down) and forced to be a guard dog who eats raw food out of cans and is kept in a dank cellar with his favorite teddy bear. Danny is somehow trained in the deadly arts and will massacre everyone threatening his master in the blink of an eye if his steel collar is removed.

When Bart is taken out in a gangland slaying Li wanders the streets until he is taken in by blind piano tuner Sam (Morgan Freeman in one of his most surprising choice of characters) and his step-daughter Victoria (the oh-so-cute Kerry Condon). As they bond as a (somewhat dysfunctional) family, Danny learns, through music, what it's like to be human, have real feelings and emotions. But when Bart returns and wants his dog back (why doesn't he just get a real dog?) a bloodbath is threatened. What we get is a bloody nose and that's about it.

The film has a very dank and miserable feel to it. So it's only appropriate that it should be set in the most depressing city in the world (that would be Glasgow, it chills me to even say the name). A lot of audiences have been puzzled and critical that everyone in the film is either American or English, but if you've ever heard a Glaswegian accent you'll understand why the filmmakers were keen to avoid it. Of this I will say no more.

It sounds far-fetched but it's actually very well acted, especially by Jet Li, who as an Asian actor with English as a second language proves he's way more than a Hong Kong Fooey. Where the film fails is in the very silly and often totally unconvincing fight scenes. 'Leaping out of their seats' my reptilian ass! These have to be the tamest punch-ups that Cory Yuen has ever staged. Kiss of the Dragon and even the PG-13 rated Transporter have much better action than this. And why the film is rated 18 I'll never ever know. I've seen plenty of gorier, harder action films than this get a lower rating. Since hardly anyone dies and there's barely a drop of blood to be had in the whole film (by comparison at least) the 18-rating is completely undeserved and only helps promise something that the film ultimately doesn't deliver.

In no way is it a bad film, just a bit too tame from what we've come to expect from Besson and co.

The action was not that great.  Jet just punches bunch of rogues repeatedly and I really could not see the beauty of martial art except the challenging the baldhead white guy toward the end. (I don't know what you think.  this guy kinda looked like Bruce Willis but maybe skinner?).

Story was okay but highly unpractical plot.  But i understand almost all action movies are not realistic.  Jet Li's intimacy with the girl(18 yr orphan girl) and Morgan Freeman(the blind piano tuner) is quite exaggerated.  Seriously, how can a girl like him whom she never saw before?  Without being scared a stranger in her apartment and Jet Li looking(or acting) like a thief trying to be away, how can she come to the blind piano tuner saying, ""he looks cute"", after putting her grocery basket down??? Quite unrealistic.  There are more but I can't think all of them now.

Anyway, Let's focus on action since it is hardcore action movie. Movie was violent most of the time.  Not a children movie at all.  As for Jet's action, I think he acted well for his ability.  And this movie was a little different because he had more dialogues than his other English spoken movies.  Yeah, you will feel a little unique taste of Jet Li.

Big, big mistake. Jet Li's acting is so awful that I couldn't focus on what where a couple of decent fight scenes. Morgan Freeman wins an oscar for the very well done Million Dollar Baby and turns around and does this? Not that he does a bad job in this, I don't think he could do any movie poorly, but this was not very challenging for him. He should never, and let me stress NEVER play second fiddle to some martial arts wannabe actor who's credits include Black Mask, Kiss of the Dragon and Lethal Weapon 4!!!!

Whew, that felt good, sorry folks, but movies like this really piss me off, You take an amazing actor and give him nothing to work with cuz the director and producers are too concerned if they get the lighting or music right for a Jet Li kick to the head!! Also, Bob Hoskins really didn't work for me, one minute he is sympathetic to Danny (Jet Li's character) the next he is smacking the crap outta him while cussing his brains out. Plus his accent is awful and he plays a gangster about as well as Jet Li plays, well, any role.

Positives? um, okay, I'll try. The fight scenes are pretty cool and violent, and let's face it, besides Tony Jaa, Jet Li can kick plenty of ass, and he does alot of it here, but then its all lost when he opens his mouth. Also, the female lead here is rather boring and about as attractive as your nerdy, glasses-wearing computer nerd cousin.

My advice: stay away from this, if you want awesome action and amazing fight scenes rent Ong-bak, with Tony Jaa, you'll enjoy it much more then Unleashed.

Academy Award-winning actor Morgan Freeman gives a memorable performance as a blind man who takes Jet's character, Danny, into his home and makes him part of the family.  Also, Bob Hoskins takes his acting to another level as a crime boss who raised and treated Danny as a dog.  Now, I can't stop writing this without talking about the action.  The action scenes are incredibly unique, choreographed by the same person who designed the fighting for the Matrix films and the Kill Bill films.  Danny's fighting style has never been seen before.  He fights LIKE a dog.  This is an absolutely incredible film and definitely one of my favorites.  Trust me.  I consider myself a conosseur of films.  They are my life, and I love all of them.

2351413,4,B000A2IPQY,"Jet Li as always demonstrates miracles speaking of martial arts. ""Unleashed"" is a very violent film and... very good-natured. It's like ancient fairytales with their confrontation of good and evil. I wouldn't go that far as recommending this movie to small children but actually it could teach them the basic rules of morality. And I'm not talking here that in the film we can see bad guys beeing punished severely - that's questionable morality. I'm talking that here the good opposes evil so evidently even a child would see the difference. The characters played by Morgan Freeman and Kerry Condon are so positive and virtuous we can't have double thoughts about what's real kindness and warm human relations. ""Unleashed"" shows very straight that violence is a bad thing even if it's turned against bad people. In a moment of soulful climax Jet Li's character beeing attacked simultaneously by three persons says: ""I don't want to hurt people anymore"". And that's the main message here. And that's why I think this movie would be very useful for children because the message is rather comprehensible and clear.

I can note also that it's the best work of Jet Li to date as I think. Some of us didn't know but he appears to be a very good actor.",1130976000,,1246,4.768518518518518
2351414,4,B000A2IPQY,"Unleashed is a rare movie. It's definitely a martial arts movie, but it also has a lot of very convincing drama. It's about a seemingly innocent man named Danny who was trained to go absolutely ballistic when a special collar is removed from his neck. But soon into the movie something happens and he finds a new way, a less violent way, and falls in love with this new way of life. This way of living demands of him certain things, however, and he seeks out his past and of ways to distance himself from his previous ""owner"". This obviously fails, and once again he's back in the world he's grown to hate.

This movie has many great moments, including the great, gritty action scenes. When watching, you'll notice imperfections in the choreography, such as misplaced punches. These imperfections made the action much more realistic.

The story itself plays out excellently with the help of Morgan Freeman and Bob Hoskins. The surprise, though, comes from Jet Li. Though definitely the more serious of the three Chinese action stars (Jet Li, Stephen Chow, and Jackie Chan) he still hasn't done anything in America that was too dramatic. Here is that movie. While not so dramatic as to seem like more than a martial arts film, it has just enough drama to make Jet Li very convincing as a leading man and not just an action superstar.

I'd recommend this movie to anyone who enjoys martial arts film but want something a little more than the common beat-em-up.",1130889600,,1458,4.6875
2351425,4,B000A2IPQY,"Luc Besson's signature style is all over the writing of this very fine little film. His ability to push the buttons on the most violent screen business while gradually developing a tale of warm sentiment is well served by director Louis Leterrier and a perfect cast of actors.  UNLEASHED is one of the few examples of how martial arts and bona fide drama can be mutually supportive in creating a film that is at once thrillingly athletic and gently tender.

Bart (Bob Hoskins) is a brutish loan shark thug who makes his 'collections' accompanied by his 'dog' Danny (Jet Li), a silent man Bart has raised form childhood to be a caged killer, a human with a dog collar that when removed unleashes a ferocious beast who kills on command of his master Bart.  Bart keeps him in a cage, feeds him, and uses him solely for his criminal doings.  Danny unleashed is simply a Pavlovian animal and when the collar is replaced, he becomes docile with the sad eyes of a puppy.

During a 'collection' gone bad, Danny escapes and finds shelter in an antique shop basement where he meets blind piano tuner Sam (Morgan Freeman), a gentle man who gradually introduces Danny to music, trains him as his assistant, and introduces him to his 'family' - his step daughter Victoria (Kerry Condon).  With the two of these welcoming, tender people Danny discovers how beautiful life can be.  The story from this point is how Danny chooses between his Pavlovian response life as a killer and the simple life of Sam and Victoria.  The journey is not without stressors and it is a difficult transition that keeps the viewer on seat's edge.

The wonder of this film lies in the extraordinary performances not usually associated with martial arts films.  Jet Li does some of his finest athletic fighting on film, but thankfully at the same time creates a character who is multidimensional and memorable - a very fine acting job by Li.  Bob Hoskins is brilliant as the despicably cruel Bart, Morgan Freeman adds a luster to his fine portrayal of blind Sam, and Kerry Condon makes Victoria zany and loveable at the same time.  The action is superbly captured by cinematographer Pierre Morel with the aura of darkness in Danny's caged life serving as a perfect foil to the martial arts sequences.

In short, this is a fine little film about characters worth knowing and provides audiences with both action and drama of a very high level of achievement.  Grady Harp, October 05",1130457600,2,2443,4.7176470588235295

This is an awesome movie if you like martial arts, action, and a good story. This movie has a good story because it's about a guy

named Danny (Jet Li) who is a part of a gang. He met a piano tuner (Morgan Freeman) and he shows him his family. Now Danny wants to find out about his family.

This movie has a lot of action. At the beginning of the movie the gang leader makes Danny wear a collar to control him, but when he takes it off the leader just tells him what to do and he will do it. The leader is a loan dealer he loans people money and expects more money in return, but if they don't give him the money they will have to deal with Danny. He tells Danny to kill the guy that owns money to him. To get to him he had to take on 7 of his henchmen.

The martial arts are the best part about this movie. When Danny took on 7 henchmen he was using a lot of martial arts. He used spin kicks, side kicks, roundhouse kicks, and a lot of other moves.

What a ridiculous mess this is. The story, which isn't even worth a mention here, was written by a 13 year old ADD victim with an IQ of 60. Which just may be brilliant strategy on the part of the producers seeing as how it's catering to that very same demographic. WHO GREEN LIGHTS THIS POO POO!?! This one makes me long for a Steven Seagal movie. How sad is that?

If you fast forward through this junk, you'll find very little martial arts action with only about 3 minutes of it being any good. The rest of the story is just juvenile tripe!! How can you take a premise as ridiculous as a trained killer in a dog collar and then add serious undertones to the story? I would have pitted him against a few more trained martial art dogs and left the backstory out. Maybe I would write it so everyone turns into dogs. The unhousebroken screenwriter made a mess on the newspaper and should be banned from the Writer's Guild. As a member of the Guild, I'm working on that now. I know Labradors who are smarter than this.

The opening fight scene in HERO between Jet Li and Donnie Yen, alone, is worth ten movies in Jet Li's entire American film catalog. I think this is an American/British production, so the British get their share of the blame. American audiences must be unaware of Jet Li's Hong Kong action flicks, because the reviews are just far too forgiving. I hope Mr. Li gets some new management because his talents are being wasted in Hollywood. He needs to work with more Hong Kong directors who won't squander his gift.

I HATE YOU ROGER EBERT. I HATE YOU RICHARD ROEPER. DID YOU HAVE YOUR EYES DILATED WHEN YOU SAW THIS? A couple of juggleheads.

This Jet Li vehicle is brutal, brutal and brutal. The story is adequate enough of a hook to keep the audience interested when Jet Li's is not emptying a 6-pack of whup-ass on whoever is in his way. Bob Hoskins nearly steals the film with his over-the-top portrayal of Uncle Bart. His performance is almost as good as Sir Ben Kingsley work in Sexy Beast. But anyone who goes to watch this film is there mainly for the fight scenes.

The fight scenes is very well done. None of the rapid-fire editing some of the past Hollywood martial films --- action films for that matter --- have relied on too much. An affliction I've called the ""Michael Bay"" disease. All the fight scenes are done with full-screen takes and barely any use of close-ups of perspective shots. When Jet Li is whupping his way through combatants you see everything. I've watched martial arts films all my life and can pretty much tell if wire-work is being used and just like Luc Besson's Kiss of the Dragon I couldn't tell if they used any or not. It all looked pretty much just standard fight-stunt and very tough stuntmen. As much as I like the wire-work when they're done right, I prefer this brutal style of martial-arts filmmaking.

It sounds like a tiny gripe, but I think it makes a difference to how you feel once the film is over.

Besides fighting Danny knows nothing about the rest of the world until his master is injured in a car accident and he stumbles upon a blind piano tuner named Sam (Morgan Freeman) Sam teaches Danny about the world of music and eventually Danny comes customed with his new life of eating icecream and shopping. However Bart recovers and won't give up easily once he finds out what had happened and sends his henchmen to hunt Danny down and return him to his former life of killing. Now Danny is in a tight decision whether to continue his favorable new life or go back to his master to a life of mistreatment.

The action is very well done, however more brutal and violent than some other movies. Jet Li breaks ribs and throws people through windows. Good action for Jet li fans. Even if you're not a big fan of action the plot behind the fighting is very solid and really brings out the movie. Whether you're there for the fighting or the plot of the move itself Unleashed is in my opinion one of the best Jet Li movies!",1129248000,,1328,4.372469635627531
2351434,4,B000A2IPQY,"I feel like I have been watching trailers for ""Unleashed"" for about a year before it finally came out on DVD this week.  So if there was one thing I knew it about this movie it was that Bart (Bob Hoskins) has trained Danny (Jet Li) like he was a dog.  While Danny is wearing his collar he is nice and calm, but when the collar comes off Danny is (altogether now) unleashed and becomes a fighting if not killing machine.  Then Danny meets up with Victoria (Kerry Condon), who does not treat him like an animal, which suggests that he does not have to behave like one the next time the collar comes off.

You know what sort of action sequences to expect in a Jet Li movie, and on that score ""Unleashed"" does not disappoint.  But in coming up with this story writer Luc Besson (""La Femme Nikita"") and first time director Louis Leterrier (who went on to do Besson's script for ""Transporter 2"") are trying to provide Li with some depth, or at least a role out of the ordinary.  However, the most important things they did in putting this movie together was to get Hoskins, who does one of his patented mad dog routines, as the villain, and to get Morgan Freeman to sign up as Sam, the blind piano tuner who is the first to treat Danny the Dog like a human being.  There are not many sins in a movie script or plot line that cannot be forgiven if Morgan Freeman is there to keep things together.

If you are expecting wall-to-wall action from ""Unleashed,"" that is not the case.  There is also as much piano playing as there is martial arts.  But the fighting actually represents an escalation for Danny.  The basic gig was that Bart loans people money and if they make the mistake of not paying him back he turns Danny loose.  But now he has a found a new arena, literally, where guys fight to the death for the betting enjoyment of high rollers.  Here we go from the extreme of Danny being too good in the sense that he is too skilled as a fighter and the fights should last longer than a second, to being too good because he does not want to hurt people any more so that he is given the incentive of more opponents (just to make things fair).

The results are engaging enough and I know that some of my disappointment in ""Unleashed"" is simply because I it had such a big buildup in mind after watching the trailer a couple of times each month (I have no idea when it went from ""In Theaters Soon"" to ""Coming on DVD Soon"" so it really does seem like it has been all year).  But I have not seen that many Jet Li movies (""Ying xiong"" is the only one that comes to mind and ""Unleashed"" is not in that league) so I am not jaded on all the punching and kicking.  Still, I enjoyed the scenes between Li and both Hoskins and Freeman more than the fighting, so Besson certainly succeeded in giving Li something different to do this time around.",1129075200,,2830,4.251865671641791
8072497,5,B000A2IPQY,Great action and Super-Great acting -- love this film -- saw it many times over and over again.  Morgan Freeman is a classic actor best of the bunch and Jet Li is top of the line with karate action stunts plus a good actor too.  This has got to be his best acting yet.  The young girl that starrs in it is also very good.  And of course the English actor (famous actor but forgot his name) does a great job at being the bad guy.  This film is highly recommended by me.,1525392000,,468,3.989247311827957
