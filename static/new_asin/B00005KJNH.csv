7943620,3,B00005KJNH,"I've seen one of the documentaries included on this DVD, ""Realm of the Killer Whales"". The operative word seems to be ""realm"", since the killer whales are almost incidental to what is really a nature documentary about invertebrates and fish around Vancouver Island. Seals, seaweed and scientists are shown, too. And cormorants?! Good if you like slow-paced nature shows, but probably a disappointment if you want to save Willy. And where's Bigfoot? Everyone knows he swims across this particular strait. Right?",1375315200,,510,5.308641975308642
7943621,4,B00005KJNH,"Haven't yet seen ""Realm of the killer whales"" for my interest was on ""Sperm whale oasis"" wich I find very difficult to surpass. The narration is enough interesting ( though conventional) but there are at least 30 minutes of images beyond all expectation for their beauty as for their interest, creatures so rarely seen can be here observed as never before. Only comparable with that one about the search of the giant squid by National Geographic.",1050451200,,446,4.881578947368421
7943622,2,B00005KJNH,"If you want facts about herring look no further. If you were silly enought to buy ""Realm of the Killer Whales"" To learn about orcas you will be very disappointed. Id say 85% of this over priced pile of DVD was about the plight, breeding, and harvesting of herring. They talk about alot of animals that have nothing to do with the killer whales outside of living in the ocean.
Most of the killer whale scenes are above the water. The only thing that saved this dvd is the last 5 or 6 minutes showing killer whales under the water engaging in the unusual behavior of rubbing the bodies along a pebble beach. That was pretty cool. No hunting, no up close, no shark cage perspective. I didn't even see an ivory orca tooth from begining to end. I haven't watched the Sperm whale documentary. However when I do I expect to learn alot about the life cycle of freekin tunas or something. I GOT ROBBED.",1046649600,,893,4.385542168674699
