1337178,5,B000042OIM,"This You Can Make It program is very detailed and me being an inexperienced sewer I was very happy to see that little extra effort put forth to help me learn the very basic skills such as cutting out patterns  and reading the guide sheet. I can see the time,consideration,effort,long  hours and detail in all the videos. Of all the disney movies I've watched  with my kids I'd say this beats them all. I have bought all five of them  each one is unique in it's own way. I began knowing nothing and now I am  almost as good as Pam.",947203200,7,530,4.207920792079208
1337179,5,B000042OIM,"Last year, I bought levels 1 through 4 of the You Can Make It series.  These videos helped me to save hundreds of dollars, not to mention time, while I learned to sew the correct way.  My only experience with sewing was  through home economics in high school, but I'm now sewing my own evening  dresses and furniture covers.  I highly recommend it to everybody who wants  to learn how to sew.",947203200,8,392,4.375
1337180,5,B000042OIM,"The video was GREAT! It was well thoughtout and presented.  The projects shown have real value.  Speaking of value, I think the information presentated compared to books our classes is more focused and detailed than  you could find elsewhere.",947030400,5,242,5.153846153846154
1337231,2,B000042OIM,"It seems like a large company produces these videos (probably in the 70's or 80's) but it I still can't believe that this is part of a series! Is seems like someone made them in their basement.  I can't attest to whether there is really great sewing info in it, because I can't force myself to keep watching it.

The woman is reading from a script like a first grader that just finished hooked on phonics.  Extremely monotonous tone, I can't stand to watch her and I keep falling asleep... really falling asleep!

Other people had mentioned how boring it was, but I didn't think boring mattered if I just wanted sewing info.  Boy, was I wrong.

The other goofy thing they do is start ""showing"" you how to read the back of a pattern package, but then they forget to zoom in on it so you can't even see what they are pointing to.

Why so much money?  This video should be a $10 movie (or less)",1163116800,44,891,4.261904761904762
1337232,2,B000042OIM,"Boring, speaker very unenthusiastic, not enough sewing information",1155427200,10,66,7.375
1337233,4,B000042OIM,"When I purchased this tape I knew nothing about sewing,only how to thread the machine which my mother actually did for me. But I really wanted to learn how to sew and this video has helped me so much. I learned how to read a pattern which I had thought was impossible,how to lay out the fabric and cut it, and then there is the sewing which she actually shows you at the machine. I really love this tape. It has started me on the wonderful world of sewing. If you really are a green beginner then this tape is for you. I even completed the skirt and it looks great. Highly recommended.",1148601600,29,585,4.185840707964601
1337234,5,B000042OIM,"This video is a must for anybody who wishes to improve their sewing skills.  The presenter instructs clearly in an unhurried style, which gives you confidence to have a go yourself.  Even the experienced sewer would benefit because of the comprehensive explanations and sewing tips shown in great detail. I have watched videos by other presenters but would place this video on the top of the list.

My first purchase was a level 3 video as I have some sewing experience, and decided to buy level 1 and 2 to update and refresh my skills.  This video is highly recommended.",1122595200,5,571,4.68
1337235,5,B000042OIM,"I am just learning to sew and it was like sewing with Pam side by side. I did learn proper way to set up patterns and I did complete a skirt:) The only thing is that they are a little out dated, but all the skill are there. Enjoy sewing............",1081468800,5,248,3.98
1337236,4,B000042OIM,"I will preface my review with this information:  I have enrolled in and dropped out of two sewing classes (one at a junior college and one at a sewing store).  Several people have tried to teach me to sew, but I have always felt like a hopeless case.
I bought the ""You Can Make It - Learn to Sew - Level 1"" video a few weeks ago.  I had no sewing experience, as I dropped out of the previously mentioned classes before I actually made anything.  This video was very helpful for me.  You really can sew a skirt with the help of this video.  I made a skirt for my toddler and am very proud of the way it turned out.  The first project was fairly simple.  Of course, learning anything new takes some practice, but the video does show the skills you need.
I watched the video completely through one time and then I watched each segment right before I started working on that segment.  A few times, I would watch the segment more than once.  That is the great thing about this video -- you can rewind it again and again.
I would give this a five star rating, but the video seems a little outdated insofar as production.  I'm not sure if it is the music or the instructor.  It is certainly a minor point and I believe the sewing instruction a beginner receives is worth putting up with a somewhat dull presentation.  The instructor does say some amusing things, but her voice is monotone and it is hard to tell when she is being serious and when she is being light-hearted.
One of the final segments is hemming the skirt.  The instructor advocates hand hemming and does not show how to machine hem.  I have recently found a message board for sewing support and many of the people there do machine hem for everyday items such as kids clothes.  I know an important aspect of these videos is to learn ""correct"" methods.  I think you will have to learn short cuts such as machine hemming elsewhere.",1061856000,20,1888,4.333333333333333
1337237,5,B000042OIM,"I have seen Video #1 and was viewing it for the purpose of teaching.  Although, I didn't get to teach from it.  It was very simple to follow and the instructor very detail in the explanation of all steps involved.  I  would highly recommend this video for beginners and those who need a  refresher course in sewing.",948153600,18,315,4.456140350877193
1337238,5,B000042OIM,"I have been sewing for many years and felt that I needed to brush up some of my skills and bought the ""You can make it"" videos. I found the teaching techniques excellent and the video lessons were well staged and I  enjoyed them. Congratulations on your good work. Hope to have many more  lessons",947635200,12,296,4.363636363636363
1337239,5,B000042OIM,"A very helpful video; the quality of the film is amateur-ish in many ways, but  it definitely lives up to its name!",947203200,4,115,4.2272727272727275
1337240,5,B000042OIM,"I love to sew, and I am self-taught.  I have been unhappy with my sewing because while I know some complicated things, there are easier things that totally evade me, and I am not always sure which procedure to use.  These  Video's are a joy.  They are the answer for me and worth every penny I  have spent on them.  If you want to learn to sew this is the way.",947203200,23,360,4.0
7919639,5,B000042OIM,Sewing made simpler. This DVD is filled with information to improve sewing or put a beginner on the right track to success.,1383177600,,123,4.636363636363637
7919640,5,B000042OIM,"At least this video steps you through and works up from a basic pattern and then through the levels. The other sewing videos jump all over the place. It may be ""boring"" but it's an instructional video, it moves you through step-by-step. This first one has you making a basic elastic waist skirt.",1378080000,,295,4.584905660377358
7919641,4,B000042OIM,"I bought the whole set of videos years ago when I was starting out.  The Level One video is a great place to start if you have never sewn before.  Pam goes over every step in great detail, so you will learn it well.  Many books and videos gloss over reading patterns, pattern layout, fabric selection, etc., but Pam shows you all of it in detail.
There are, however, a couple of omissions throughout the series.  For example, she never covers seam finishing, which will make your garments look better and last.  She does go over french seams and flat felled seams in later lessons, but this should be a basic skill, to learn many seam finishes.  Also, she does not instruct to prewash the fabric to prevent shrinkage and puckering.  Lastly, she never covers working with knits on any of the levels.
Aside from that, I think Level 1 is a great place to start, but you may want to supplement with a good manual on sewing construction, as well as a good book on pattern fitting (which Pam does suggest).",1361491200,,1000,4.461538461538462
7919642,5,B000042OIM,"I bought this as a start to teach my grandkids to sew. Didn't read others' reviews first. Glad I didn't. I watched this DVD last night and although much has been said about the quality of the ""movie"", I found it to be quite good from a skill progression standpoint. I have been sewing since I was 8 and I'm now on Social Security. This IS supposed to be for someone who does not know how to sew at all. It met that purpose perfectly IMHO. One reviewer mentioned not being able to see the print on the back of the pattern. All patterns look the same on the back. Knowing what each section was for is the object, not being able to read THAT specific pattern. The one thing I did like, specifically, is that this DVD gives me the chance to view it with the GK and while it is playing, teach them things that I would do differently and why, i.e. wasting so much fabric on the skirt layout comes to mind. I am sorta gagging over the price of these DVDs in the series and may have to resort to looking in the library for the next levels or trying to rent them online. As I said, I'm on SS.",1281744000,4,1083,4.065420560747664
7919643,4,B000042OIM,"After reading the reviews on this product I purchased a 2nd hand copy of Level 1 with great reluctance because I was certain I would be bored stiff but I am definitely pleased to share that I found the instruction thorough and well set forth. My husband and 4 children even sat through the entire DVD with me!

Truly you would not purchase this for the cinematography or for entertainment quality but it well serves its purpose and that is teaching one to sew and to sew well. I am looking forward to purchasing Levels 2 and 3 next (though as a bargain shopper I wish I could find 2nd-hand versions for $29.99 or less also - LOL)",1256688000,5,629,4.330508474576271
7919644,1,B000042OIM,Waste of money.  I purchased all 7 and gave them away.  Hard to watch.,1233619200,2,70,3.9285714285714284
7919645,5,B000042OIM,"I can't Tell you how much I love these videos! I really love how you took the time to organize selected patterns to go along with each tape,And you give us a nice selection to choose from.
I recently viewed tapes 1-4 and they are fabulous. They are Sew good that I just ordered the altering pants Video. I am a teacher and really do appreciate the organization that went into producing something as massive as teaching sewing. I always knew how to sew but I never wore my clothes due to poor fit. Then I lost interest in sewing until I found your wonderful tapes.
I especially like how the instructor speaks slowly, every word is towards direction and explanation. No small talk or busy talk. I love how the tapes build on each lesson, and I especially like it when we have to do lessons not covered in the pattern for our sewing bag. WOW! This is sew great!",1220918400,6,858,4.3354037267080745
7919646,1,B000042OIM,"I was eager to find a DVD that should show me how to sew! But I was dissappointed when I received my DVD. It was probably recorded way back in the 80s. I had really problems following the steps the Lady showed. I found it rather boring to watch, and it is still standing on my shelf, and I'm not sure, if I will ever watch it again. I would rather recommand a sewing class to someone, who wants to learn how to sew, than paying almost 50 $ like I did for this old and boring video. It's not worth the money!",1205625600,9,507,3.9320388349514563
7919647,1,B000042OIM,"Poor production from the early-mid 80's cannot be corrected with a ""remaster"" attempt. I purchased it directly from the company a few months back. With the greatest respect for the lady giving the sewing instruction who can be your best friend's mom up the street, the production values are so low and filming techniques so outdated as to be useless to observe.  They make use of a mirror on her work surface, a camera does not go right into her work much of the time and contrasts are low.  Editing was also very choppy at times.  The resolution is so poor that I could not see critical details. It just isn't easy to see what she is doing half of the time.

Good solid information is given for beginners but I cannot recommend this product. Not good value for the price.  I honestly believe the company should scrap it (and the series assuming the rest are like this) and start over.",1191801600,14,885,4.472049689440993
7919648,3,B000042OIM,"Yes, the production quality is like something out of the third grade.  Yes, they were done in the dark ages when big, REALLY big glasses were in. Yes, the woman who teaches has terrible delivery, and uses her own giggly little girls as models. BUT, these DVD's really do teach you a lot of what you need to know to sew.  I have gone through the first five so far, and I have two skirts, a blouse, a jumper and a pair of pants that all fit and look great. They take the mystery out of altering.  After you watch these, you will know a lot about how to sew. One critical fault: I wish she had said something about finishing seams.",1183334400,6,628,4.131147540983607
