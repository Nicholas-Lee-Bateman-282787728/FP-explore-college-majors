8378592,5,B002RC6LA2,"Ive seen a lot of videos about caves in North America and this is, by far, the best.  A lot of caves are in this area (Sequoia N.P) and Crystal Cave is the most popular.  This video is very well done, and offers a unique look into one of the most interesting caves in North America.",1254787200,,282,4.017857142857143
8378593,5,B002RC6LA2,"When this film was first released, it was reviewed in the December 14th, 2004 LA Times. Here's what they had to say:

  ""You don't need a headlamp or neoprene undies to enjoy Steven M. Bumgardner's style of caving.
The California filmmaker-photographer's DVD on Sequoia caves is spelunking at its safest and sanest.
From the vantage point of a dry warm sofa, you can scoot down tight twisting passages, ogle 25-foot,
milky white calcite curtains, ford gurgling underground streams and observe the occasional millipede.

Bumgardner's valentine to the little-known caves of Sequoia & Kings Canyon National Parks (more
than 200 mapped so far) follows cavers as they plumb the recesses of Lilburn Cave, Hurricane Crawl
and Palmer Cave, three of the most fascinating caverns in the 860,000-acre park system. Lilburn, at
20 miles (so far) is one of the longest and most complex cave systems in western North America, and
Palmer boasts two of the biggest cave rooms in the state, including one of the most pristine, untram-
eled and diversely decorated caves in the West, Hurricane Crawl, which was mapped in 1986-88.

The only drawback to this 60-minute gem is that the interviews are sometimes gee-whizzy.
Otherwise, it's a serious pleasure to navigate some of America's lesser-known speleological wonders.""

As the filmmaker, I was pleased with the review, despite the fact that they got a few facts wrong.
As a filmwatcher, I hope you'll enjoy ""The Underground World of Sequoia National Park!""
