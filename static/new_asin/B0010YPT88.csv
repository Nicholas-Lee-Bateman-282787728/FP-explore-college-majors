Although there may be studies that show babies can learn different languages if introduced early, that was not our intention when buying the DVD.

My son is just starting to talk and I thought the ba-ba-ball and other words they had in the description would be perfect to advance his communication skills. The dvd is nothing like the description. It spends way too much time on foreign languages and not enough time on baby's first sounds! Like the other reviewer said, your child won't learn anything from this...except sheer boredom! My son has no desire to watch it and he loves almost all the other Baby Einstein dvds. It really makes me wonder if they had a children's focus group watch this!

3056579,5,B0010YPT88,When my daughter is cranky I just put this on and it calms her down. She absolutely loves it and she's 7 months. Don't think an older baby would be as interested. For the comments about the other lauguages. 1st it's meant to learn sounds not words. Sounds are universal no matter the language. Mmmmm is the same in Spanish French and English. So it doesn't matter.,1375401600,,364,4.447761194029851

3056582,4,B0010YPT88,"My sons LOVES LOVES the puppets and when they makes the 'sounds' in this video.  He gets a big kick out of hearing the monkeys go 'E-e-e-e' for the 'E' sound, and the sheep going 'baa' for the 'B' sounds. He giggles throughout this video.

My pet peeves with it though
- My son has learned NO sounds by watching this video, even with me trying to reinforce the sounds.
- Mix of languages.  Spanish, French, English and I think Mandarin (not sure though).
- The stories are cute, but after watching this DVD atleast 40 times, I still don't understand what is being said (as the stories are in French, Spanish, etc) except knowing the story is either Little Miss Muffet, Little Bo Peep...

Don't expect you child to pick up on any words from watching this.  The puppets and the sounds are absolutely cute though.  My son has picked up words like 'Hi' and 'Cat' from us actually READING a book to him and pointing at the pictures.",1324857600,,927,4.423529411764706
3056583,3,B0010YPT88,"If you're going to buy a children's video, by all means buy this video for your two year old and older child. I highly recommend it compared to other kids' videos because it is engaging, fun, educational and not cartoon animated or fast-paced.

Having said that, I am unhappy with the title ""Baby Einstein"" and implying that this will make babies smarter!! These videos may be okay in moderation for kids, but tv/videos are generally are NOT good for babies' brains!

After some research I found out that: 1) brain wave activity in babies is slower when watching television than when sleeping. 2) for every hour of television a baby watches a day, their chances of acquiring an attention deficit disorder increases by 10%, and 3) consistent, heavy television viewing (more than 2 hrs daily) throughout early childhood can cause behavior, sleep and attention problems. Interestingly, there is even some odds increase for bullying later on, for every hour of television viewed daily at 4 yrs old.

The American Academy of Pediatrics recommends no television for children under 2 and no more than two hours of media (tv, videos, video games & computers) daily after age 2. Of course, I realize that this is probably not realistic for most people. There are studies that recommend preferably sitting with your child and watching t.v. together rather than just propping them in front of the tv by themselves, to make the experience more enriching and interactive (within reason of course and not longer than the recommended time). But I wanted to put this information out so that other parents and caregivers could make better informed parenting decisions. Maybe it will encourage some to limit television usage for babies and children and look for other outlets when possible.

For those looking to calm babies and build better brains, I recommend baby carriers because studies show that infants who are carried an extra 3 hours per day cry 40% less, and this effect is lasting over time! Frequently held babies pick up verbal skills faster and develop better core muscle strength and balance. Also, learning to communicate in sign language can reduce frustration and tantrums, accelerate language development and promote parent-child bonding in infants and toddlers.",1316649600,,2263,5.075268817204301
3056584,1,B0010YPT88,"So my daughter is just getting to the age where she is becoming interested in TV. I heard a lot about Baby Einstein so I decided to give this a try.... ugh! It looks like this was made in someone's basement with a home video camera and a power point presentation. It talks in all different languages and in my mind, is just a little creepy to boot.
Classic Sesame Street comes to mind when I remember what 'good' children's programming is like. I learned SO MUCH from that show and they did it in a way where parents wouldn't be insanely bored watching it with their kids. They used all different art forms and the puppeteering  was the best there was to date. Very thought out show.
THIS however, looks like it took 2 hours to put together. Total waste.",1315958400,,754,4.347517730496454

3056587,5,B0010YPT88,"My baby is only 7 weeks old, but I thought you can never be too young to start hearing your first sounds. The DVD is entertaining even to me with the vivid array of colors, sounds, and characters. The fast pace ensures that your child doesn't get bored while the various approaches to the sound education are fun. These different methods include real life children playing, puppets, toys, and animation. It's a lot of fun and very interesting. As my son gets older, I know it will keep him entertained and help him learn. I fully expect that he will begin saying his first sounds much sooner than the average baby because of this video!",1299110400,,636,4.539130434782609
3056588,4,B0010YPT88,"I'm surprised at some of the negative reviews! Our baby enjoys this video very much. Hes just turning 7 months and he will sit up in bed and watch intently, smiling when the Bee comes on and other familiar scenes.  He loves the ""Bah- Bah -Bahhhh"" sheep and when I sing ""Do Rae Me"" along with the flowers.  I learned how to say hello and goodbye in several languages myself! It has lots of colors, shapes and sounds I think its a good beginning video but I guess people who hated the video expected their baby to become an overnight genius or something.  From our experience,its colorful and engaging and perfect for a new baby.",1291507200,,627,4.434782608695652
3056589,5,B0010YPT88,I've bought a few other Baby Einstein dvds and this is by far the best. Babies a few months old don't know the difference in languages...the point is them getting to know how to pronounce certain words! This DVD is both entertaining and very educational. My twins love it. They get to watch it only at mealtimes and that makes my job A LOT easier. To see their face light up when it comes on and at their favorite parts is the best feeling in the world.,1281744000,,453,4.218390804597701
3056590,2,B0010YPT88,"This product was not what I thought it would be.  I thought that this would teach my baby the different sounds of things like baby, mama, papa, etc. like it said on the package.  And then it would have different options to do the languages.  Like the Language Nursery it is all jumbled up in there together.  I don't mind the baby learning different languages but hearing a whole song or nursery rhyme before learning it is English is confusing for me and my baby.  My three year old was watching it with us and he did not even try to repeat the different languages when they came up he just said what they were in english.  And this is a child who watches Dragon Tales, Dora, and Handy Manny alot and always says the spanish. I personally think that they should have english then another language but not all four together. It is just to much.

If you are already multi-lingual or live in multi-lingual household then this might be great.  But I will be attempting to take advantage of their DVD guarantee.

My baby did like the bee, the other puppets,the shots of other babies, and the music. But that can be found in any baby Einstein.  We have several of their DVD's and for the most part we really enjoy them.
If you are wanting one that teaches words then try Baby Wordsworth this one also teaches some American Sign language.",1280361600,,1332,4.422131147540983
3056591,1,B0010YPT88,I have given baby einstein several tries and these dvds are just not good. This is last one I am purhcasing. Like for this one again why is everything almost in every other language yet only a few things in english. I would like it if my 7 month old was exposed more to english first since he cant talk yet versus 10 other languages.,1266019200,,333,4.138461538461539
3056592,1,B0010YPT88,"I gave it 1 star for the images and NOT the first sounds sound... images are good but the DVD is NOT what you believe it to be. I took it out of the dvd several times thinking maybe I bought the wrong language...then i thought ..maybe i will change it to english settings...no luck so I sat it through and then they started speaking some english.

I thought this dvd was teaching first sounds in english BUT this is not the case. I believe first sounds sound be the foundation to language and should be in 1 language, his native language.

I love the baby einstein collection and so does my 8 month old BUT we differ on this dvd... he likes it cause he loves the characters and I like the characters too but I don't like the different language aspect.

 If you don't mind the 4 languages then it'll be a great buy.",1265673600,,814,4.198717948717949
3056593,1,B0010YPT88,"While I have to admit that my toddler will watch this DVD all the way through, it is only because we have lost all the other great Baby Einstein DVD's we owned when our 11-year-old was younger.  One reviewer could not describe it as anything but weird, and I echo that sentiment.  The classical music snippets are OK, but the original music is just not good.  Remember how the Bach and Beethoven DVD's taught a basic musical scale?  The one clip in this DVD that almost does that is the video showing the blocks stacking up (strangely) on top of each other, which involves a half scale and then a major chord, but then as the blocks disappear, the scale descends and then just becomes odd notes that have no logical relationship to each other.  Not sure what that particular clip is trying to teach.  And the little dancing finger bit is flat-out ridiculous.

Then there is the issue with all the languages.  I am fine with teaching my child different languages, but the DVD goes way overboard with entire nursery rhymes being spoken in French or Spanish.  I only know how the stories go based on the visuals, but no way can my toddler process all of those words and make a connection to what he is seeing.  And why does baby's first sounds have to be limited to languages?  How about birds chirping?  Car or motorcycle engines?  A train?  Rain, thunder, the ocean, wind?  More animal sounds than a lamb and cow?  I guess the sound of a hippo slurping an entire pond through a straw is interesting enough, but there was just way too much emphasis on pronouncing words in different languages than introducing the real first sounds that a baby hears.  Take advantage of the Baby Einstein recall on this one.",1264809600,,1705,4.537704918032787
3056594,5,B0010YPT88,"This is the only dvd of all the Baby Einstein DVDs I own, that my son will watch again and again.  He has watched this from 3 months old and it still holds his attention at 19 months old.  I remember thinking that I wished I had another one like it so that I could play something else he would like just as much.  I purchased it after visiting my sister who owned this, and this allowed us a little time to do other things while my nephew and my son watched it over and over.  I couldn't say that about any other dvd at that time.  I think people who are confused by the many languages are confused, but I don't think the babies are confused at all.  I normally don't even write reviews on products I have purchased as it is very time consuming, but felt the need because of the negative reviews.  All babies are different.  My other friend recommended the World Animals one, and my son couldn't care less about that one.  Oh well, live and learn with your little one.",1264291200,2,968,4.1891891891891895

It is the second Baby Einstein dvd we've received as a gift and I feel bad that we won't use it.  Show your baby Sesame Street.  That would be much better than this.,1252195200,,324,4.366666666666666
3056600,5,B0010YPT88,"This DVD is my son's favorite.  He's been watching it since he was about 6 months old, and he's now 16 months.  This is digital board book, so the more that you watch it with your child, the more he/she will get out it.

What I like...
1.  The quality of the DVD is wonderful.  The animation and the pictures are vivid and colorful.  It's extremely engaging for little ones.
2.  The basic sounds are simple enough that my son can imitate them.
3.  The puppets (especially the little lambs and the bumblebee) really help draw the child in.  My son jumps for joy whenever the bumble bee comes on screen.  (In the tradition of Baby Einstein, the bumble-bee is the host, so you'll see her often.)  The little bee makes sounds like she is talking right to the baby.  So, my little one talks right back.
4.  There is a huge variety of animals (dogs, ducks, turtles, lambs, and hippos, just to name a few).
5.  The music is excellent and very soothing.  Its perfect for night time since it doesn't get him all worked up.
6.  The beginning of the DVD has lots of little kids from all over the world saying ""hello"" in their various languages.  My son waves to them all.  Now that I've seen it a couple of times, I say hello back while he waves to the children.  I don't speak any languages fluently, so it's a language lesson for me.

At the end of the DVD, you'll hear goodbye in multiple languages as well.  I think its great to hear the different sounds that you'll never hear in English, and I firmly believe that when children are exposed to these sounds when they are young, they'll pick up languages faster later on.  Having spent a lot of time with multi-lingual small children, I think that kids don't get as confused as we adults do.
7.  It's a great intro to phonics.
8.  I absolutely love how it reinforces the idea of a loving family. You'll see moms with babies, dads with babies, and moms and dads together.

What would I change?
You'll hear Twinkle Twinkle Little Star about 4 times during the video in various languages.  Twice is good, but 4 times?  But it doesn't seem to bother my son, so I'm not too worried about it.

Overall, I think this a great DVD.  I look at it this way.  My son now points to his arm when the lady on the DVD says, ""ah...ah... arm.""  My husband and I never taught him that.  If I wanted a DVD to teach my son English words, any DVD can do that.  Besides, I think my child will have no problems picking up English in our household. Because this DVD is meant to get them to DISCOVER SOUNDS of all kinds, I think Baby Einstein accomplishes this task.",1250035200,7,2583,4.2815734989648035
3056601,1,B0010YPT88,"We have a large collection of Baby Einstein DVD's and like most of them.  This one, however, was a HUGE disappointment.

- It barely focus on making sounds
- It has too many languages -- confusing for adults, and most likely confusing for children as well
- The lady speaking the Spanish words seems to have a lisp or something weird -- it's not even clear!
- My kids that normally LOVE Baby Einstein DVD's were bored with this and paid no attention to it

3056604,1,B0010YPT88,"I get teaching your child different sounds and basic words, but trying to do that in like 4 or 5 different languages just confuses a baby.  For a DVD aimed at infants/toddlers that don't speak yet (hence the name), this was a big disappointment.

Here's an example.  My child is just beginning to sing twinkle twinkle little star (well make the sounds to it) because of one of his favorite cd, so when that song came on on this dvd he started to sing along.  However when the Spanish version started later he stopped as if confused.  This will happen throughout the entire DVD.

I can even understand having a bilingual DVD, but this many languages for a child that isn't even 1 if not 2 years old is just silly.

Though the ""Ba ba baby"" section is helpful (two animals sound out the word, then you see a picture of a baby etc.), it is a shame that the rest of the DVD is not created in this easy to understand, helpful fashion.  Having a DVD that did this for all the main things babies see around them, like Mommy, Daddy, tree, car, cat, dog etc. was what I was hoping for but instead got a waste of time for my child and money.

Having tried several with my daughter for variety, this one is actually her third favorite, after Beethoven abd Language Nursery! It combines introducing new sounds with a variety of languages. Since I am trying to make sure my baby hears some foreign languages regularly, this was a goot fit for my little talker. Now, some of the words they introduce are more designed to fit the visual images the writers/producers wanted to include. For example, for the syllable ""ma"" they do Mama, and marionette.

Also, they show different examples of fathers with their children but the word they teach the baby isn't the word you'd think:""Daddy"" or ""Father"". Instead they say ""Papa"" in an Italian accent which sounds way too close to ""Ba-ba"" which is what many babies know as their bottles! I mean who really calls their fathers papa anyway?

Now at 1 year old I can ask her for all her part bodies in english or spanish and she can identify them whitout any problem.
What I know is that at this stage, the baby's brain is learning a lot of stuff that will use as reference in the future. Not that they will ""learn"" all the langugaes on the DVD but they get used to the different sounds, so later they will be able to reproduce them if they choose to learn a new language.

My pet peeves with it though
- My son has learned NO sounds by watching this video, even with me trying to reinforce the sounds.
- Mix of languages.  Spanish, French, English and I think Mandarin (not sure though).
- The stories are cute, but after watching this DVD atleast 40 times, I still don't understand what is being said (as the stories are in French, Spanish, etc) except knowing the story is either Little Miss Muffet, Little Bo Peep...

Don't expect you child to pick up on any words from watching this.  The puppets and the sounds are absolutely cute though.  My son has picked up words like 'Hi' and 'Cat' from us actually READING a book to him and pointing at the pictures.",1324857600,,927,4.423529411764706
3291080,3,B0010YPT88,"If you're going to buy a children's video, by all means buy this video for your two year old and older child. I highly recommend it compared to other kids' videos because it is engaging, fun, educational and not cartoon animated or fast-paced.

Having said that, I am unhappy with the title ""Baby Einstein"" and implying that this will make babies smarter!! These videos may be okay in moderation for kids, but tv/videos are generally are NOT good for babies' brains!

After some research I found out that: 1) brain wave activity in babies is slower when watching television than when sleeping. 2) for every hour of television a baby watches a day, their chances of acquiring an attention deficit disorder increases by 10%, and 3) consistent, heavy television viewing (more than 2 hrs daily) throughout early childhood can cause behavior, sleep and attention problems. Interestingly, there is even some odds increase for bullying later on, for every hour of television viewed daily at 4 yrs old.

The American Academy of Pediatrics recommends no television for children under 2 and no more than two hours of media (tv, videos, video games & computers) daily after age 2. Of course, I realize that this is probably not realistic for most people. There are studies that recommend preferably sitting with your child and watching t.v. together rather than just propping them in front of the tv by themselves, to make the experience more enriching and interactive (within reason of course and not longer than the recommended time). But I wanted to put this information out so that other parents and caregivers could make better informed parenting decisions. Maybe it will encourage some to limit television usage for babies and children and look for other outlets when possible.

For those looking to calm babies and build better brains, I recommend baby carriers because studies show that infants who are carried an extra 3 hours per day cry 40% less, and this effect is lasting over time! Frequently held babies pick up verbal skills faster and develop better core muscle strength and balance. Also, learning to communicate in sign language can reduce frustration and tantrums, accelerate language development and promote parent-child bonding in infants and toddlers.",1316649600,,2263,5.075268817204301

Classic Sesame Street comes to mind when I remember what 'good' children's programming is like. I learned SO MUCH from that show and they did it in a way where parents wouldn't be insanely bored watching it with their kids. They used all different art forms and the puppeteering  was the best there was to date. Very thought out show.

I thought that this would teach my baby the different sounds of things like baby, mama, papa, etc. like it said on the package.  And then it would have different options to do the languages.  Like the Language Nursery it is all jumbled up in there together.  I don't mind the baby learning different languages but hearing a whole song or nursery rhyme before learning it is English is confusing for me and my baby.  My three year old was watching it with us and he did not even try to repeat the different languages when they came up he just said what they were in english.  And this is a child who watches Dragon Tales, Dora, and Handy Manny alot and always says the spanish. I personally think that they should have english then another language but not all four together. It is just to much.

If you are already multi-lingual or live in multi-lingual household then this might be great.  But I will be attempting to take advantage of their DVD guarantee.

My baby did like the bee, the other puppets,the shots of other babies, and the music. But that can be found in any baby Einstein.  We have several of their DVD's and for the most part we really enjoy them.

One reviewer could not describe it as anything but weird, and I echo that sentiment.  The classical music snippets are OK, but the original music is just not good.  Remember how the Bach and Beethoven DVD's taught a basic musical scale?  The one clip in this DVD that almost does that is the video showing the blocks stacking up (strangely) on top of each other, which involves a half scale and then a major chord, but then as the blocks disappear, the scale descends and then just becomes odd notes that have no logical relationship to each other.  Not sure what that particular clip is trying to teach.  And the little dancing finger bit is flat-out ridiculous.

Then there is the issue with all the languages.  I am fine with teaching my child different languages, but the DVD goes way overboard with entire nursery rhymes being spoken in French or Spanish.  I only know how the stories go based on the visuals, but no way can my toddler process all of those words and make a connection to what he is seeing.  And why does baby's first sounds have to be limited to languages?  How about birds chirping?  Car or motorcycle engines?  A train?  Rain, thunder, the ocean, wind?  More animal sounds than a lamb and cow?  I guess the sound of a hippo slurping an entire pond through a straw is interesting enough, but there was just way too much emphasis on pronouncing words in different languages than introducing the real first sounds that a baby hears.

What I like...
1.  The quality of the DVD is wonderful.  The animation and the pictures are vivid and colorful.  It's extremely engaging for little ones.
2.  The basic sounds are simple enough that my son can imitate them.
3.  The puppets (especially the little lambs and the bumblebee) really help draw the child in.  My son jumps for joy whenever the bumble bee comes on screen.  (In the tradition of Baby Einstein, the bumble-bee is the host, so you'll see her often.)  The little bee makes sounds like she is talking right to the baby.  So, my little one talks right back.
4.  There is a huge variety of animals (dogs, ducks, turtles, lambs, and hippos, just to name a few).
5.  The music is excellent and very soothing.  Its perfect for night time since it doesn't get him all worked up.
6.  The beginning of the DVD has lots of little kids from all over the world saying ""hello"" in their various languages.  My son waves to them all.  Now that I've seen it a couple of times, I say hello back while he waves to the children.  I don't speak any languages fluently, so it's a language lesson for me.

At the end of the DVD, you'll hear goodbye in multiple languages as well.  I think its great to hear the different sounds that you'll never hear in English, and I firmly believe that when children are exposed to these sounds when they are young, they'll pick up languages faster later on.  Having spent a lot of time with multi-lingual small children, I think that kids don't get as confused as we adults do.
7.  It's a great intro to phonics.
8.  I absolutely love how it reinforces the idea of a loving family. You'll see moms with babies, dads with babies, and moms and dads together.

What would I change?
You'll hear Twinkle Twinkle Little Star about 4 times during the video in various languages.  Twice is good, but 4 times?  But it doesn't seem to bother my son, so I'm not too worried about it.

Overall, I think this a great DVD.  I look at it this way.  My son now points to his arm when the lady on the DVD says, ""ah...ah... arm.""  My husband and I never taught him that.  If I wanted a DVD to teach my son English words, any DVD can do that.  Besides, I think my child will have no problems picking up English in our household. Because this DVD is meant to get them to DISCOVER SOUNDS of all kinds, I think Baby Einstein accomplishes this task.",1250035200,7,2583,4.2815734989648035

Here's an example.  My child is just beginning to sing twinkle twinkle little star (well make the sounds to it) because of one of his favorite cd, so when that song came on on this dvd he started to sing along.  However when the Spanish version started later he stopped as if confused.  This will happen throughout the entire DVD.

I can even understand having a bilingual DVD, but this many languages for a child that isn't even 1 if not 2 years old is just silly.

Though the ""Ba ba baby"" section is helpful (two animals sound out the word, then you see a picture of a baby etc.), it is a shame that the rest of the DVD is not created in this easy to understand, helpful fashion.

Now, some of the words they introduce are more designed to fit the visual images the writers/producers wanted to include. For example, for the syllable ""ma"" they do Mama, and marionette. Now get real, what baby will say marionette. But beyond this I have no complaints.",1229212800,,708,4.717741935483871
3291105,1,B0010YPT88,"First off, you have to learn to walk before you can run. Same applies for kids in America; you have to learn ENGLISH before you learn Spanish, French, Italian, etc. This video devotes too much time to foreign languages.

Also, they show different examples of fathers with their children but the word they teach the baby isn't the word you'd think:""Daddy"" or ""Father"". Instead they say ""Papa"" in an Italian accent which sounds way too close to ""Ba-ba"" which is what many babies know as their bottles! I mean who really calls their fathers papa anyway?

 Save your money and pass this one up unless you want your toddler ambling around the house singing ""Twinkle Twinkle Little Star"" in French.",1225843200,2,692,4.75
3291106,1,B0010YPT88,"It spends way too much time on foreign languages and not enough time on baby's first sounds. If you are going to do foreign languages, make sure to have a seperate track option. Keep english to english track, spanish to spanish, chinese to chinese track. Do not put them all together!!!",1222905600,3,286,4.627450980392157
3291107,2,B0010YPT88,I would have given this DVD a 5 star review if it were in English only.,1219276800,,71,3.5
3291108,5,B0010YPT88,"This is my son's favorite Baby Einstein DVD.  He listens to the sounds, enjoys when they say sounds he can say.  It doesn't bother me that there are foreign languages in it, it's the sounds he is learning.  The bee is his FAVORITE!",1215388800,,231,4.325581395348837
3291109,5,B0010YPT88,"Don't hestitate on buying this DVD. As with all products some babies will like it and some don't. Mine love it and enjoy all the sounds of the different languages (maybe because since her birth see has been exposed to english, spanish and french at least; remember that all the baby einstein DVD's have the function of choosing the language and I use them all with her). Now at 1 year old I can ask her for all her part bodies in english or spanish and she can identify them whitout any problem.
What I know is that at this stage, the baby's brain is learning a lot of stuff that will use as reference in the future. Not that they will ""learn"" all the langugaes on the DVD but they get used to the different sounds, so later they will be able to reproduce them if they choose to learn a new language. (ie, for the english spoken people is very hard to pronunciate de ""RRR"" sound that mexican people use as in ""perro"", because they never heard that sound as babies and never used it.
I really, really recommend this DVD as a tool for they future development.",1214438400,,1057,4.29
3291110,5,B0010YPT88,"I was hesitant to purchase this DVD for my daughter based on the poor ratings that reviewers provided.  Boy, am I glad I did NOT get sway by these reviews!!! My daughter has all the Baby Einstein DVDs and she loves this DVD!!! This DVD is very well done.  It is colorful, rich with real life human interaction scenes, tastefully animated with the various Baby Einstein characters, and teaches much more than just single syllable sounds.  The song ""Twinkle, twinkle, little star"" is sung in various languages throughout the video. Segments of the DVD contains scenes spoken in languages other than English but it is quite obvious what is being identified or spoken.  The introduction of language is wonderful as it exposes children to different tones and inflection.  You will not be disappointed with this DVD purchase!!!",1210550400,,821,4.963503649635037
3291111,5,B0010YPT88,This Baby's Einstein DVD is one of their best!  The production is well put together and music that our little one loves.

3291113,1,B0010YPT88,"If this whole dvd was in english... that would be neat. if this whole dvd was in spanish... that would be neat. but why would you take a dvd for a baby that is learning ""da-da"" and ""ma-ma"" and throw in ""Las Manzanas"" in there (Las manzanas, sorry if i spelled it wrong, is what the dvd said when it showed apples). This dvd would show one or two items and say what they are in english, then it would show something else in another language.
my rant is just the same as the other reviews, ""stick to one language.""",1209513600,,512,4.13
3291114,1,B0010YPT88,"This series has been a boon to my now 2 1/2 yr old. Even though she's too old for an intro to talking, the shows are usually just fun to watch. Confidence in their product line made me buy this right off the shelf without reading any reviews. I've seen other Baby Einsteins (Meet the Orchestra & Baby Santa) poorly reviewed and held off only to find that they weren't bad after all. I personally think the only truly mediocre ones until now were Baby DaVinci and Baby Newton (which even Disney apologized for with Discovering Shapes). The true fans will spot too much reused old footage. The foreign language is confusing. Puppet bits go too long and it ruins the pacing which is what usually makes the videos so rewatchable. I apologized to my daughter and promised not to put it on again.",1209340800,,790,4.493055555555555

The video spends way too much time on foreign languages, and not enough English.  I would like my son to learn a foreign language, but after he masters English.

He is not even speaking English yet, I do not need him watching a DVD with more German, French, and Spanish in it.",1207008000,,387,4.065789473684211
