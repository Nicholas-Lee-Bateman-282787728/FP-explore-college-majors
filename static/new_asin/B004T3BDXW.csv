4465130,3,B004T3BDXW,"I was really looking fwd to receiving this.  For over a month I had planned to create my on DVD copy of the coverage of the day.  Unfortunately, the tornadoes of April 27 left the northern third of our state (AL) without power until the next week.  So I really wanted this to be good.  But, the coverage was boring.  I am hoping that someone can tell me where to get a dvd memory of the day that is done by ABC, E channel, FOX, or some other quality form of media.",1306454400,,464,4.0
4465131,2,B004T3BDXW,"This is a beautiful memento of that very special wedding day.  Very nicely done, however without CC or subtitles.  My copy is flawed in that sound and picture are not synchronized.  Perhaps mine is the exception.",1306454400,2,212,4.833333333333333
4465132,5,B004T3BDXW,"as a person who does not have cable, i had watched the live broadcast on abc with little complaint other than the early hour. that being said, the bbc coverage is far preferable!

this dvd may not be presented in hd, however the quality is top drawer. it begins minutes before princes william and harry depart for the ceremony, and concludes with the balcony kiss (kisses). one of the best features of the complete coverage is the sparing use of commentary. it was a perfect amount of information without being bothersome.

for some reason watching the dvd made me more choked up than watching it live did! ah, the human brain. or my human brain.

the other great part about this dvd is the extra feature on william and catherine's courtship. as with all other things bbc, it is a solid piece and a welcome addition to the already affordable dvd.

i am certain i will purchase not only an extra copy for myself, but a couple extras to send to relatives.

i can not recommend this highly enough!",1306281600,81,994,4.5307262569832405

It also has a special feature on the courtship and engagement of Will & Kate. Excellent video. I'm really happy with it. I preordered this video when it was $5.99. Amazon has reduced the price to $4.99 so they have given me a $1.00 refund. Great service! Thank you, Amazon!",1306281600,8,382,4.550724637681159

We are on the brink of spoiling our planet of vital natural resources, yet we watch in awe a luxurious, over the top, glamorous wedding, while at the same time, thousands of children die of hunger and disease caused mainly by centuries of said colonialism and enslavement.

4465137,5,B004T3BDXW,"The recent English Royal Wedding, betwixt Prince William and Miss Catherine Middleton, broadcast on TV on 29th April, 2011, was a lovely wedding ceremony betwen two people very much in love.  Much pomp and circumstance was seen, as well as fashions worn by guests to the wedding, and the awesome interiours of Westminster Abbey, itself.  It was a royal wedding to remember, that's for sure.

However, the earlier Swedish Royal Wedding, held on 19th June, 2010, betwixt Crown Princess Victoria, and Daniel Westling, (a gym owner and her former personal trainer), was every bit as spectacular -- and in some ways, even more so.  Like the English Royal Wedding, it united, in love, a person born royal, and an extraordinarily uncommon commoner.  In the English Royal wedding, it was the man, (Prince William), marrying the wealthy and highly intelligent lady commoner, Kate Middleton).  But in the Swedish Royal Wedding, it was the lady, (Crown Princess Victoria), who was royal, and the gentleman, (her highness's personal trainer, and the owner of a several gymnasiums), Daniel Westling, who was the commoner.  In both cases, grandparents and parents on BOTH sides of the families wanted to be SURE that these royal/uncommon-commoner marriages would last...and a l.o..n...g period elapsed, in both cases, before even an official engagement notice was issued. Both of thse wonderful Royal marriages are indeed love matches, and both weddings were indeed spectacular.  But, just as the English Royal Wedding featured the surprising, and totally delightful post-wedding sight of the newlyweds driving around the area just outside Buckingham palace in a motorcar, on a level with their to-be, (and simply delighted), subjects -- something that was not seen in the Royal Swedish marriage, there were some things in the Royal Swedish marriage, during, before and after this marriage, that were not in the English Royal Marriage.  At least, that is, they were not shown to the public, to any large extent....

The Royal Swedish Wedding was not shown on televison.  No -- it was shown, perhaps even more intimately -- in a webcast, only.  This, of course, left out those people who do not have their own, or who were not near, computers at the time.  But for those fortunate enough to own, or be near a computer at the time the wedding was held, it was a breath-taking ceremony, and the pre-and-post wedding celebrations were just as breat-taking and beautiful as the ceremony, in their own, just as joyous, but less formal ways.

At the pre-wedding concert, wedding party members and their guests -- just about all of whom were Royal -- came, dressed in lovely evening attire.  For a royal-watcher, it was a delight to see these people, whom one had seen only in still photographs, come ""to life"", as it were, moving in line and waving at the crowd, as they entered Stockholm Concert Hall.  First to enter were, of course, Crown Princess Victoria and Daniel Westling.  Princess Victoria wore a beautiful, pink lace gown of intricate design, and Daniel looked SO handsome in his black-tie suit.  (There was only one ""snag"" in the entire pre-wedding, wedding, and post-wedding activities -- and it happened at this pre-wedding concert.  Princess Victoria's dress literally DID become caught and was almost snagged on the cobblestones outside the concert hall.  How delightful to see Daniel so gallantly come to her aid, and un-tangle the dress before any real damage could be done.  Daniel was SO careful to take the dress off the cobblestones in just the RIGHT way.  Victoria was SO happy to see him, and SO relieved when the dress was finally free.  You could FEEL their love, in this totally un-planned for and un-wished for, incident!  One wishes this ""snag"" had never happened, but, since it did, it will always be recalled as a candid  moment of high drama, and deep affection, showing true and unrehearsed feelings of the deepest love and affection, and will always be remembered by those who saw it.

Princess Victoria patiently posed for photographers before going into the Stockholm Concert Hall.  Watching it, I marvelled at her, and Daniel's. composure and patience, as thet stood there, with what seemed to be two or three hundred photographers and journalists facing them, each photographer and journalist seemingly asking for ""just one more"" photograph.  Finally, one of the photo-journalists was astonishingly bold enough to actually ask for a SPEECH from the eager-to-get-into-the-concert pre-nuptual pair!  I didn't blame Crown Princess Victoria one bit as she smilingly waved a finger at this journalist, saying ""No!""  And yet, they STILL stayed there for a few more photographs, before entering the Concert Hall.  They were followed inside by the Royal guests, each one dressed so magnificently.  (One of the few commoners present, Filippa Reinfeldt, wife of present Swedish Prime Minister, Frederick Reinsfedt, showed her eminent good taste and sense of protocol, by wearing a short dress -- in a striking, simple, tourquoise colour -- whcih contrasted with the long and far more formal gowns worn by the other -- and Royal -- ladies present.)  At the end of line, were Crown Princess Victoria's family -- Prince Carl Philip, Princess Madeleine, Queen Silvia and King Carl XIV Gustav. The concert featured the soon-to-be-married pair entering the Concert Hall in a blaze of lights, and had both traditional and modern music.  The camera was permitted to show all the Royal guests to this concert, truly and completely enjoying themselves, at tiems clapping with the music and
really getting into the spirit of joy that the musical pieces brought.

The wedding ceremony was incredible.  Princess Victoria arrived in a large limosine, and from the moment of her alightment from it, eager viewers could catch a glimpse of her dress.  It was SO simple, with a batteau neckline, tiny cap sleeves, a wide self-sashed waist line, and flowing skirt.  At first I was a bit disappointed at the simplicity of it -- but then realized, with growing awe, that this dress, though updated the tiniest bit in design, truly seemed reminiscent of a fourteenth-century ladie's attire!  On her head, Crown Princess Victoria wore the traditional, (and magnificent), Swedish wedding tiara.

The ceremony was full of  beautiful music, and meaningful glances.  Of bride to groom.  Of groom to bride.  And of wedding guests to both of them.  Their love for each other shone brightly during the ceremony, and was so touching to see.

After the wedding, bride and groom entered a small barge, royally decorated with gold and turquoise.  They arrived at the Royal palace,
and the camera caught their walk up the long, paved sidewalk which is in the middle of two areas of beautifully-manicured lawn.  Then, up the many outside stairs, to the royal balcony, where members of both bride's and groom's family awaited them.  The architecture of the lawn, and the steps leading up to the balcony, were truly magnificent, and lent much to the fairy-tale setting of this Royal Swedish Wedding.  But of course, the love between Bride and Groom matched and even surpassed this!

Later, a post-wedding reception was celebrated.  Costumed players greeted the guests, and, at the head table, Daniel -- now PRINCE Daniel, began a speech.  He began his speech in English:  ""....Victoria, Princess of Sweden, Princess of my heart...."", then continued it in Swedish.  But one did not need to know either language to realize what was in their heaets -- and in the hearts of all the well-wishing guests!

This DVD, THE ROYAL WEDDING ( DET KUNGLIGA BROLLOPET) { NON-USA FORMAT, PAL, Reg. 2 Import - Sweden), truly DESERVES and NEEDS to be put into a Region 1 format, for Royal-watchers and Royalty-admirerers, in the United States and Canada.  Both the English, and Swedish Royal Weddings celebrated love, marriage, and devotion -- and, like the two people that make up any marriage, should BOTH be made available for those who wish to view these quintessential celebratioons -- over and over, and over again!",1304553600,3,8072,5.049811320754717
4465138,5,B004T3BDXW,"The world watched after the long wait. Those who had to give up sleep for the event, did so without complaint. It is undoubtedly the biggest wedding affair of the century, and will remain so for decades, likely. There is a myriad of collectible items for sale. Mementos that will help recall the days up to the wedding and the actual event. But what better to own than a DVD of the event? These will surely become as precious as the Lady Di related DVDs/CDs. The torch has finally been passed. The world watches William and Kate. Let's face it, around the world, all take notice of the British monarchy--forever. It will be so 100 years from now. Own a piece of history.

And who better to produce the filmed record of such a wonderful event? The BBC is relentless for great TV production. This is a no risk purchase, and Amazon is providing such a discount that it is a value for sure. Best buy 2, because when your friends find out you own a copy, they will be borrowing.

Family friendly, historical, beautiful, and BBC enchanting.",1304380800,136,1034,4.49468085106383

4465171,3,B004T3BDXW,"As an avid fan of the royal family and the Duchess of Cambridge in particular, I absolutely had to own my own copy of the BBC coverage of the royal wedding in 2011. While I am pleased with this DVD, I agree with several of the other more critical reviews: where is the Blu-ray version? And why is this copy somewhat choppy and unfinished almost (I'm referring especially to a particular scene when William and Kate are standing on the balcony after their wedding and the camera instead pans off the to right side and stays for a moment on the empty balcony!)? I was also disappointed to see no coverage of the Aston Martin drive away.

Others may disagree with this but I personally wanted more information provided in the video. Some more continuous narration and interesting facts (as opposed to the BBC live commentary which, while nice, leaves me wanting much more information) and a more polished edit of this DVD would make it an all-time favorite. Perhaps by the time I have burned holes in this disc after watching it for the hundredth time, a newer more comprehensive version will be available. Maybe even with coverage from the Royal Tours the Duke and Duchess have done since their wedding (one can only hope).",1397520000,,1221,4.652777777777778

Run Time: 120mins Approx.
Special Features: 50 minute documentary of Royal Engagement

I'm a Brit ex-pat living in the U.S. and I had the excellent misfortune of not being able to sleep the morning of the royal wedding. Waking up (quite by accident) at around 4:30am that day, I remembered that it was the Royal Wedding day and flipped on the television. That said, I was rather bleary-eyed, missed some of the start, and therefore was very pleased to find this DVD! If you're expecting much more than we were presented on television the day of, you will be disappointed! It really is just a video presentation of the newscast, however for my purposes (filling in some gaps) it suited me just fine.

There is, of course, the bonus documentary on the engagement (which was shown several time on American television leading up to the wedding) and it is also a great addition to your Royal Wedding collection.

Overall for the price this is an excellent DVD, containing enough high-quality footage to appease even the most dedicated fan! As long as you are not expecting too much more than what was presented live, I would highly recommend it.",1352678400,,1151,4.745
4465204,5,B004T3BDXW,Very Good !  Exactly what we wanted.  It is a complete replay of the wedding day as it played on TV the day of the wedding.  I would highly recommend it to anyone interested in this wedding and British Royalty.,1349654400,,210,4.2
4465205,4,B004T3BDXW,"I bought two wedding DVD's, this one and the one put out by NBC. Of the two I'd have to say this is the better value by far, I really have only two complaints . The commentary is kept to such a minimum that if you don't know who some celebrity guest was- you won't find out ( that would be more important thirty years from now than today), and if you don't get some bit of dialog you're out of luck, no captioning.
I think much of the wedding footage must have been shared but with this one you get no idiot reporters, nothing but what you really want and a very clear image at that. If you can afford only one wedding video get this one.",1346544000,,638,3.9921875
4465206,5,B004T3BDXW,A closer look at William and Catherine. Very interesting as the royal family has always fascinated me. It takes a closer look at them both as a couple and individually.,1345593600,,168,4.633333333333334
4465207,3,B004T3BDXW,"I purchased this DVD largely because the wedding ceremony was beautifully executed, and the music was chosen and performed brilliantly. Additional narration would have made viewing the ceremony more enjoyable.

Another disappointment I had with this version of the wedding cerermony itself is that many human interest ""touches,"" noticeable when this ceremony was available for viewing on the Royal Channel, had been edited out.

My most important problem with this DVD is as follows: the DVD I received was flawed. It contains a program about the wedding ceremony and a program about the development of the relationship between Prince William and Miss Middleton.

During my playing of this latter program, the playback simply stops at a certain point, and I can not make it go forward.

I called Customer Service at Amazon.com and requested a replacement copy. When the replacement copy arrived, I played it. I found exactly the same flaw.

I contacted Customer Service a second time to resolve this issue.

My experience with this DVD persuades me to believe that other flawed copies are probably in circulation. In other words, I ask that whatever company produced these DVDs be asked to check its stock and discard other flawed copies of this DVD.

When a perfectly manufactured copy of this DVD becomes available for sale, I would like to purchase a copy of it.

Amazon.com has an e-mail address for me on file. I ask that, when Amazon has a flawless copy available for sale, Amazon send me a message to that effect.

In its advertising, Amazon.com proclaims that it is striving to provide excellent customer service.  In what I have written above, I am offering Amazon.com an opportunity to prove that its advertising means what it says.

My thanks to anyone who reads thhis review.

4465210,4,B004T3BDXW,"If you got up early to enjoy the royal wedding, you'll like this video.  It's also a very relaxing and beautiful ""background"" video.  Some quibbles:  I would rather have seen more of the guests arriving to the church, and less of the inane babbling from the ""fashion"" commentators about the dress.  Also, they did not include the newlywed's exit from the palace with William driving the vintage Aston Martin.  That was a special moment, and I'm disappointed it wasn't included.",1341446400,,477,4.9125
4465211,4,B004T3BDXW,"The BBC did a good job in filming the wedding, though there are two things that I am disappointed that they didn't include on the dvd.

4465214,5,B004T3BDXW,"This must be the official version approved by the Royal Family.  It is an excellent keepsake.  It starts at the right point, with coverage of Prince William & Kate's wedding from the Hotel where Kate & her father are preparing to leave while the Rolls Royce waits outside.  Then it switches scenes to Prince Willaim and the royals leaving the palace headed for Westminister Abbey.  Covers all of them in the procession through the streets of London heading to Westminister Abbey to the entrance of the church.  It covers the wedding procession inside the chruch, and then the street procession back to Buckingham Palace, and ends at the right point where Kate & William exchange the long-awaited kiss on the balcony, while the Royal Air Force fly overhead in salute.  Some quiet narration here and there, but not disruptive. I say ""Buy it"".",1333152000,,840,4.839160839160839

The gown is so pretty.  So many people from around the world came to see, including from the US my country.  Their marrage will be so different from his father and mothers.  For one thing they are different people and have been together for more than five years.  Kate already has more experience than Di did, so she knows what to expect already.  I recomend this video.",1332633600,,540,4.428571428571429

4465218,5,B004T3BDXW,"After a few hint hint's to my sister, she bought me this dvd for Christmas. It is really worth having if you are a big fan of Kate (or as I should say, Her Royal Highness Catherine, the Duchess of Cambridge) or of the whole royal British family. I think BBC did a great job. Since I did dvr and watched the full BBC broadcast, I notice that they cut out a few not so important arrival but I was ok with that. And since I also watched the wedding live on American TV I can say I very much prefer this version. There is BY FAR a lot less commentary during the ceremony which is great! I can here the vows and the singing! And the William and Kate: A Royal Engagement is really nice. It has a great background of each and talks of there relationship.  It really is a great dvd and I would recommend it to anyone.

And if anyone is hesitant to buy it because it is only 2 hours long, don't worry! The WHOLE ceremony, the carriage procession to Buckingham Palace, and the balcony bit are ALL THERE!",1325721600,,993,4.11340206185567

4465221,2,B004T3BDXW,"I recorded the whole Royal Wedding in HD as a computer file. On British television we saw everything, all day long - over and over again!  I later purchased the BBC DVD of the event as a keep-sake: and what a disappointment that turned out to be. Why haven't they released a Blu-ray version yet? The BBC boasted that they were broadcasting the Royal Wedding to 180 countries, and yet they saw fit to produce what is in my view an inferior product for this word wide audience to own and enjoy as a precious souvenir of a stunning occasion. The lighting, the sounds, the ceremonials, and all that scarlet and gold requires the best media that modern technology can provide. For those folks who couldn't see all this in High Definition, they really don't know what they are missing. That much abused and overused American adjective, ""Awesome"" is a truly accurate description of that wonderful day. To quote one of the Duke of Edinburgh's colourful phrases, ""They (The BBC) should get their finger out...!""; and publish a Blu-ray version as soon as decorum allows.",1319846400,,1060,4.72972972972973
4465222,5,B004T3BDXW,BBC adds a great perspective to this event.  A lot more substance with less commentary. As an American we tend to get more talk about the event and less of the splender of the occassion.,1319846400,,186,4.314285714285714

4465224,5,B004T3BDXW,"I think the reason they may not have shown Michael lifting her veil may have been because they wanted to give him the very  last oppertunity to do something for his daughter before she officially entered the public eye.  Any channel that records  programmes & releases DVDs / videotapes on Diana or Prince William should be given credit

Guys they may have cut the DVD short but if all the companies who released wedding DVDs like these had more then one disc in the pack & released more than one multiple disc pack (such as Lifetime who released a 3 disc pack & another 2 disc pack) they'd all be very expensive and they wouldnt be unique and only one would actually be purchased from one company only.

Therefore if someone doesnt have a TV box (such as Starhub)to record it or forgets to record it they're the ones that lose out.  OK let me put it this way to yeh.  LIVE AID released a single 52 minute DVD & a 4 DVD boxset.  Not ALL of the concert was recorded between those 5 discs Why? Well as regards it people wouldnt have bought them because they would have been too expensive & the purpose of these DVDs would have been lost because no money would have been made for the poor people in Africa

If somebody is in a situation where they don't have a TV box like Star Hub ask your friends or family to burn what's on their TV box from the wedding onto DVDs for you",1316649600,,1371,4.242307692307692

4465239,5,B004T3BDXW,"I love watching the wedding of William and Kate again...and again...and again. I enjoyed the BBC's coverage of the wedding on this DVD, they did very well. I live in the U.S., California to be exact, and I watched the wedding coverage on ABC. ABC showed Kate's mother and brother arrive at Westminster, this DVD does not, and that angered me a bit. When you watch the wedding many times you are able to see small things that are a bit funny, they are listed below.

1. Prince William seems a bit impatient, or concerned about the time schedule, when he tells his brother as they begin walking to the abbey, ""Come on Harry."" I guess Prince Harry was taking too long talking to the guy who greeted them when they got out of the car.
2.  As the Queen, Prince Philip, Prince Charles, and Camilla line up before walking down the aisle to their seats, Camila takes a while to figure out where to stand. She begins by standing way ahead of Prince Charles and then she backs up to stand near him, all the while Prince Charles seems puzzled as he notices how far away she is standing.
3. Once Kate arrives to stand by William, Prince Harry is staring at her like he wants to eat her.
4. As William is saying his vows, you can see his cousin, Peter Philips, in the background smirking a bit.
5. When Kate's sister, Pippa, walks away with the bouquet you can see the Queen staring at her intently, why, I don't know.
6. While The Address is being read and William and Kate are sitting down after their vows, you can see Kate stare aimlessly a couple times, its like smile girl you just married a prince!
7. William, in my opinion, was supposed to put on his hat and gloves before walking out the doors of Westminster, not at the carriage, that angered me. Prince Charles put on his hat and gloves before he walked out the door when he got married.
8. When William got into the carriage, he sat on the opposite side, his poor nerves. You can see two of the guys standing near the carriage smiling at the fact that he sat on the wrong side in the carriage.
9. Once William and Kate arrive at Buckingham Palace you can see William do a really deep sigh just before the carriage stops, watch closely.

I really didn't have to purchase this DVD online, I saw it at a Best Buy while it was being shipped to me, darn. I hope some of you also notice the small things during the wedding that I found funny. I give the DVD 5 stars because BBC does well with the coverage, I didn't need any extras or pop up bubbles with information, I already know a lot about the couple, family, and guests.",1310860800,2,2570,4.283950617283951

The DVD did not play after ten minutes, on any of my DVD players, TV, desk top, lap top and DVD player. Shame on BBC for selling such shabby material.  I am VERY, VERY disappointed, I so looked forward to this. I would like a replacement, does anyone know who I can contact???. It would have been good, had I been able to look at it.  I am still in unbelief at the quality of the DVD, and the fact that it stopped playing after a few minutes.  It never got to seeing the bride out of her car!!!. I am disappointed!.",1310256000,3,593,4.077586206896552

The wedding, the ride back to the Palace, and of course both kisses were shot beautifully. I'm glad I have this in my DVD collection to share with generations to come.

4465245,5,B004T3BDXW,"I enoy reading anything I can get my hands on about Great Britain's royal family, especially Diana, Princess of Wales and her sons. My maternal grandmother was born in London, England in 1886, therefore my mother, brothers and I have a profound interest in the British Isles. My brother has made at least 8 trips to Britain and I have been there 3 times myself. So, since this was Diana's eldest son marrying I got up at 4:00 AM to watch the event live. This book is very good and describes the wedding very well. I enjoyed reading it and undoubted will reread it many times. Thanks for providing such wonderful books, DVDs and CDs on Britain.

4465249,5,B004T3BDXW,This is a lovely video.  It comes with a video of their engagement and that is good also.  The only thing I really missed is the very ending of the wedding senario where Will & Kate drove out of the castle in their little car.  That would have been the best ending for this video.  That was a real let down.,1309132800,,307,3.9836065573770494

4465251,5,B004T3BDXW,"I think this was great, but I think since it was BBC, it should have included more. There were scenes in it that NBC didn't show. NBC showed them leaving Buckingham Palace in Prince Charles car and also pictures of them at the reception.

It was one of the loveliest parts of the day. Also, given that this is the BBC, there should have been some news footage of the two princes greeting the crowds the night before the wedding and there are bits missing from the ceremony,such as when the father of the bride lifted her veil, lovely moment, again, not on the dvd.  WHY NOT??????  They could have made this a 2 disc dvd and had the BBC news footage from the day before, day of the wedding and also the day after when the newlyweds got in a helicopter to fly off for a private weekend.

I watched it on TLC (in America, obviously) and it was in HD and the picture quality was outstanding, felt as if I were actually there. The only thing that bothered me about TLC was the commercials and the constant babble about the wedding dress. I decided to order the BBC DVD so I could have an uninterrupted version of the ceremony, but the image quality of the DVD is terrible. It's not in HD.",1308009600,2,454,4.352941176470588

The pictures were lovely, clear and bright - the sound excellent. Prince Harry and Pippa Middleton (Best man - Maid of Honour) were a joy to behold.  History in the making and this video gives us a front row seat taking us right back to the morning of April 29th, 2011. One could not help but think of Princess Diana, how happy this day would have made her.

But for those of us (all) who wanted this as a keepsake of this magical, iconic event, the integrity and keepsake value of this DVD is vastly and sadly reduced, because of the glaring, glaring, absence of even one single milisecond of one sngle frame of one single shot of the unique, unprecedented, and now LEGENDARY ride in the blue Aston Martin, one of the (if not THE ) most memorable shots of this most historic event.  Without it, shame shame shame. Someone in the BBC editing room, and his/her supervisor, made a huge mistake.  Bad form, BBC.

 (My so-called friends were giving me crap about buying something like this, and I told them, whatever I like that I see on TV appeals to me, doesn't mean you have to rip me apart for liking something that I think is a beautiful and lovely moment shared between two people that love each other.)

The only thing I didn't like, that there are no close caption on the DVD. But who cares!!!!!!!! This is the best money I ever spent. For those who hate romance, you don't know what your missing.

4465267,3,B004T3BDXW,"Since I am an avid Royals watcher, I was most anxious to get this DVD of THE wedding. I was sorely disappointed as I had wanted more background of all the 'Goings On'! This is a simplified edition of the day with very little commentary. On the day of the wedding, I watched the TLC channel and heard all their insights and extraneous information they had on this spectacle. They said  her lace had been specially woven,just for her as I would have expected!, at Hampton Court! And yet the BBC commentator wondered if indeed the lace on Catherine's dress was Brussels Lace. The BBC should have done more homework for the event....hardly would the future Queen of England have 'foreign' lace on her wedding dress! If you are into vintage cars, this is the DVD for you! They go  into quite a lot of detail about each of the cars that transported them to the wedding. They also were very detailed about the various carriages that returned them to Buckingham Palace. I was just interested in a more details of that splendid day. Well, as I say this, how am I to know if I know any more now than what I saw that day! This DVD was a bit disappointing.",1306886400,12,1144,4.3915094339622645
4465268,4,B004T3BDXW,"It was on July 29, 1981, when we saw The Royal Wedding of His Royal Highness Prince Charles and Lady Diana.
 Diana Spencer was a beautiful, blushing bride. The wedding was held inside St. Paul's Cathedral and we won't forget the opera singer Kiri Te Kanawa who sang ""Let the Bright Seraphim"".
  Now 30 years later, HRH Prince Charles and the late Diana, Princess of Wales' first-born son, HRH Prince William, has his Royal Wedding with Kate Middleton. He is 28. She is 29. The Royal Wedding took place in Westminster Abbey on April 29, 2011.
  The whole world was watching this wedding with excitement on television, radio, the internet and big screens outside. They believe more than 34 million people watched The Royal Wedding on television including 23 million viewers in the United States.
  One thing the couple did differently was, the procession to Westminster Abbey was in modern SUV's. However, the procession after the wedding to Buckingham Palace was done in the traditional horse carriages.
 Also something new was maple trees were placed inside the church as a sign of strength. I thought it was a very nice touch and appropriate.
  The entire immediate British Royal Family was there as well as many Royal dignitaries. Her Majesty Queen Elizabeth II looked so happy and glowing.
  BBC America had 6 hours of LIVE television coverage of the Royal Wedding without any commercial interruption, however on this single-disc, you will only see highlights of the arrivals, including HRH Prince William and HRH Prince Henry arriving at the Abbey, as well as, the Duke of Edinburgh and Her Majesty Queen Elizabeth II.
  From the time of the bride's arrival, you will see The Royal Wedding in its entirety. You will not miss a thing.
  The ceremony is followed by the Carriage Procession to Buckingham Palace and then William, Duke of Cambridge with the Duchess will appear on the balcony to greet the awaiting spectators and share their first wedded kiss.

 Running time: 2 hours, 07 mins.

Bonus: William & Kate: A Royal Engagement (47 min.)

The television picture is crystal-clear, however the picture is slightly-squeezed on my small 13"" television screen. Upon having a 24 1/2"" television screen, the picture was normal. It was not squeezed in.

  Televised Royal Weddings are very rare to see. After Prince Charles & Lady Diana's Royal Wedding in 1981, their was The Royal Wedding of Prince Albert & Sarah Ferguson (now divorced) at Westminster Abbey on July 23, 1986 and The Royal Wedding of Prince Edward & Sophia Rhys-Jones in St. George's Chapel at Windsor Castle, June 19, 1999.

  The next Royal Wedding will be of HRH Prince Henry of Wales to Ms. Meghan Markle in May 19, 2018 in St. George's Chapel at Windsor Castle.
  HRH Prince Andrew, Duke of York could have another wedding, but he is single at this time having been divorced since 1996
.
  After the Royal Wedding of Prince Henry of Wales and Meghan, we won't see anymore British Royal Weddings for 20 to 30 years, until the next generation finds the love of their life: Prince George of Cambridge and Princess Charlotte of Cambridge.

  Buy the Royal Weddings for your DVD collection. 20 to 30 years is a long time to wait for the next wedding.",1306713600,4,3220,4.817518248175182
