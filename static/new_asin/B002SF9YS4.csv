8379350,1,B002SF9YS4,"I have ordered and received this DVD twice now and each time, my DVD player (even Blu Ray player, tho this DVD is not such) refuses to play the movie. So I have no idea what the movie is about or whether it is any good or anything.  I am writing this just to warn prospective buyers that they may have the same problem.",1277078400,2,319,3.984375
8379351,4,B002SF9YS4,"This is a pretty good New Zealand horror thriller about a couple of private nurses stuck in their patient's mansion in 1932, with a nurse killer on the loose in the nearby community.  They see television reports about other nurses being horribly killed by this maniac and he appears to be coming towards their location.  There's a certain psychological edge with the goings on, and the banter between the two nurses is excellent while they prepare for the worst.  This movie looks and sounds extremely good, with a superb soundtrack.  The bumps in the night are executed with precision, and the scares are effective right up to the time you might all ready see the twist coming.  I thought I had figured out alot of the plot, but I got fooled especially at the end.  Made for only $35,000, the movie is amazing on such a small budget.  Listening to a little of the director's commentary is very revealing on how they created the visual effects to compensate for lack of funds.  I liked it, it sets up that sense of dread right from the beginning, and never lets up in its 80 minutes.",1265068800,2,1083,4.546391752577319
8379352,5,B002SF9YS4,"It's the 1930s in rural New Zealand. Two nurses are resident in a country house caring for a young invalid. The setting is apparently tranquil - but somewhere in the area roams a deranged killer with an apparent predilection for strangling nurses. As night falls, a series of odd accidents leaves the two nurses shuttered in the house, with a building fear that they may not be completely alone.

This debut feature from New Zealand writer/director Alex Galvin is a slow-burning thriller that rewards close attention. The film eschews cheap frights early on to build up a gradually mounting tension, aided by an effectively eerie score. When the suspense breaks, there are some genuine scares and unnerving twists that leave the viewer perched on the edge of the sofa.

Impressively slick for its reportedly low budget, When Night Falls has some clear Hitchcockian touches, but it also brings to mind an Agatha Christie-style closed room mystery, while the disorienting movement around the cavernous old house at times give the film an almost David Lynch-like creepiness.

Tania Nola does well in the lead role as the nurse whose head-girl positivity is gradually eroded as things repeatedly refuse to be what they seem. As mentioned, the score is highly effective.

Verdict: definitely one to relish after dimming the living room lights.",1263340800,3,1338,5.095890410958904
