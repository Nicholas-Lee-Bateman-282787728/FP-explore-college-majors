5322983,4,B009ERK1ZO,"I bought this set because I have wanted to watch ""Love Among the Ruins"" again - I remember this teaming of Laurence Olivier and Katharine Hepburn from when it first aired (made for television film in 1975) and loved it.  It is a charming December/December romance -- two people who'd been lovers as young adults, were separated by circumstance and reunite when she is sued for breach of promise by a young man (Olivier is asked to become her lawyer -- and is appalled to discover that she doesn't remember their youthful romance).  It is as charming and witty as I remembered it -- I highly recommend this Edwardian period film for anyone who enjoys watching two consummate performers do what they do best.  The John Barry musical score is delightful as well.
The other three films included in this set are worth a look.  Ive never been a fan of the Vivien Leigh version of Anna Karenina, but she and Ralph Richardson turn in fine performances.  The Inheritance based on a story by Louisa May Alcott is a delightful Cinderella-esque story  well acted and visually pretty.  I haven't been able to get through St. Ives (based on a story by Robert Louis Stevenson); it bored me and I gave up on it.
The video quality is actually quite good for all four films.
This set is worth your time, especially the delightful Love Among the Ruins.  Recommended.",1364342400,18,1347,4.630252100840337
5322984,4,B009ERK1ZO,"I've been looking for 'Love Among the Ruins' for years.  It has never been available on dvd before, that I know of.  I had taped it off tv.  VHS tapes only last but so long.  This is a wonderful movie and how can you do better than Hepburn and Olivier?",1362787200,13,252,3.98
5322985,4,B009ERK1ZO,"I have had Love Among the Ruins on vhs for many years.  Finally it's available in dvd, even if it's in a four pack.

5322986,5,B009ERK1ZO,"LOVE AMONG THE RUINS, made for TV and starring Lawrence Olivier and Katherine Hepburn, charmed a huge audience and swept the Emmys c. 1975.  What a thrill to see a pristine clear sharp picture in DVD instead of a fuzzy 2nd gen. VHS.  This is treasure, a delight half a lifetime ago and even more fun now. Treat yourself to a delicious Edwardian courtroom drama with unexpected twists, told with the warmth and wit of a Julian Fellowes and acted with the charm of a dowager countess.",1361318400,8,482,4.528735632183908
5322987,5,B009ERK1ZO,Love Among the Ruins is a little known production that should be considered a classic. Masterfully written and beautifully acted by two icons of the twentieth century.,1360108800,7,167,5.222222222222222
5322988,3,B009ERK1ZO,"The first two movies mentioned below are made-for-TV films I've seen before, dearly love and will undoubtedly watch again and again. Not so the other two.  The third one I vaguely recall having seen before, found it to be ""just okay,"" and now that I've seen it twice, am highly unlikely to ever watch it again. The fourth, the ""classic"" 1948 ""Anna Karenina,"" I simply couldn't drag my way through. So, rating this DVD  package as a whole, the star count ends up as middling, with an  extra half star thrown in for its bargain price.

THE INHERITANCE  is a 1997 made-for-TV movie based on a Louisa May Alcott  story. There's nothing British about it: not its author, characters,  accents or setting--Americans all.  It stars  Meredith Baxter, Tom Conti, Cari Shayne and Thomas Gibson (who, at the time, was also ""Greg"" of ""Dharma & Greg"" and now stars in the TV series ""Criminal Minds."") Here he's the tall, dark, rich and handsome eligible bachelor that a wealthy family is trying to marry off to their visiting cousin, but his heart has other ideas. Has great potential as an annual Valentine's Day flick.

LOVE AMONG THE RUINS, a 1975 made-for-TV movie, is far and away the best made, best written and best acted film on this disc and the only one that seems to have never been sold separately on  DVD.  Starring Katharine Hepburn and Laurence Olivier, this is the story of an aging actress who finds herself in need of a defense attorney in an  alienation of affection case,  but  unbeknownst to her, the lawyer she hires turns out to be a long forgotten former lover, who's still pining for her 50-some years later.

ST. IVES (pronounced ""snEEV) is a 1998 movie  based on a Robert Louis Stevenson story set during the Napoleonic wars. It tells of  a  swashbuckling French soldier who gets caught and sent to a Scottish prison where he meets a  beautiful young woman visitor,  escapes, sets out to find her, while, at the same time,  eluding  pursuit by the Brits--ofttimes with considerable derring-do. Running toward love while running away from the Brits--especially when it involves hiding in a balloon basket--adds unexpected challenges to both pursuits.

Leo Tolstoy's ANNA KARENINA is the story of an extramarital affair between aristocrats in 19th century Russia.  It's  been filmed 24 times so far, according to IMDB,  and is promoted here, as ""the greatest love story ever told."" This version is  NOT the  Oscar nominated 2012 film of the same name  with Keira Knightley;  Nor is it the 1997 version with Sophie Marceau.  This is the somewhat wobbly black and white 1948 ""classic,"" starring the beautiful Vivien Leigh. The actor who plays her lover, the allegedly irresistible Count Vronsky, looks like a totally resistible dork to me and some of the reviews I've been reading from way back when suggest critics at the time seemed to think so too.  The background music grates on the ears like Great Granny's Victrola. Time has not been kind to this one, at least what I saw of it; I gave up after about 30  minutes. For those who've seen the Knightley version (I haven't),  it might make an interesting 64-years-later contrast & compare.

As with other films in the Miramax ""British Cinema Collection"" series, there are no extras, no subtitles, no closed captioning. A few annoyances: The films here are divided into ""chapters,"" but they're just numbered, with nothing to show you where in the story a click would land you, and all too often that'll turn out to  be smack dab in the middle of a key scene; also, the  DVD opens, not with a screen shot of titles to select from, but with the title page of one of the films; if that's not the one you want, you click on ""NEXT"" instead of ""play"" and keep doing that until you get to the title page of the movie you DO want to watch, at which point you click ""play.""  Still, for the money, probably forgivable and a pretty good buy.

P.S. None of the four is in widescreen.",1359590400,40,3932,4.666666666666667

5323027,5,B009ERK1ZO,"The first (and last until now) time that I saw ""Love Among the Ruins"" was on TV in the late 70's or early 80's, before we even had a VCR.  All I remembered was that it was witty, even hysterical in places, and naturally well-acted with these stars.  I wanted to watch this movie over and over, so I searched in vain for it on DVD for the last 15 years, and eventually gave up.  I finally stumbled on to it this week and ordered it immediately.

It was even wittier, funnier, and more hysterical than I remembered.  Also, this ""movie"" is almost liked a filmed play, having many VERY long scenes between Hepburn and Olivier without any cuts or camera changes at all.  These are two masters of their craft giving it their all up close and personal.  Even when Ms. Hepburn's dress snags on a bench, she and Olivier both just circle back to free it up and the dialogue just keeps on rolling as if it was just one of those things that sometimes happens.

And of course I'm about 35 years older myself now, and more personally acquainted with one of the topics of the film, the effects of aging!  All the better to appreciate the trials and tribulations experienced by the main characters.

I'm not sure if I'll ever get to any of the other films on this DVD, perhaps on a sleepless night.  But I will be watching ""Love Among the Ruins"" many times now, and never a chance of falling asleep during that one!",1393545600,,1399,4.32183908045977

5323036,4,B009ERK1ZO,"This DVD has four films on it:

THE INHERITANCE (1997)
This is a historical film set in 19th century New England based on a story by&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Louisa-May-Alcott/dp/0140436669/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Louisa May Alcott</a>. Edith Adelon (Cari Shayne) is a beautiful, young orphan employed as a paid companion to the daughter of the wealthy, prestigious Hamilton family. When she falls in love with a visiting eligible bachelor who is supposed to be there to court a young cousin of the Hamiltons, Edith's previously secure position in the household is put at risk.

LOVE AMONG THE RUINS (1975)
This is a period piece set in London of 1911. Almost 50 years ago in Toronto, starving, young law student, Arthur (Laurence Olivier), fell madly in love with beautiful, young actress, Jessica (Katharine Hepburn), and they spent three torrid days and nights together. Jessica agreed to marry Arthur after he got established as a barrister in a few years, but when he returned to England ready to claim her, he learned to his horror that she had married a much older, wealthy man. They have now reunited, both of them around 68 or 70 years old, when Jessica hires him to defend her in a case of breach of promise brought by a man young enough to be her grandson. Arthur is as much in love with Jessica as he was in his passionate youth, and he has never married, proclaiming to the friend who brought Jessica's case to him that she ""spoiled me for all other women."" Unfortunately for Arthur, it is obvious that Jessica has no idea who he is.

LEO TOLSTOY'S ANNA KARENINA (1948)
This film is based on the classic&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Russian-novel-of-the-same-name/dp/0143035002/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Russian novel of the same name</a>&nbsp;by Leo Tolstoy. It stars Vivien Leigh (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Gone-with-the-Wind/dp/B002W7IH0Y/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Gone with the Wind</a>) as Anna Karenina. It is the tragic tale of an illicit affair between Anna, a married noblewoman, and the handsome, dashing Count Vronsky (Kieron Moore).

ROBERT LOUIS STEVENSON'S ST. IVES (1998)
During the Napoleonic Wars, a young, French officer (Jean Marc Barr) is captured in battle and brought to a prisoner of war camp in Scotland where he falls in love with a beautiful local woman (Miranda Richardson).

The entire reason I purchased this collection was to get my hands on a DVD copy of ""Love Among the Ruins,"" which is an absolutely wonderful, made-for-TV movie from 1975. It was directed by George Cukor as one of the final films in his long, sterling career. He won an Emmy for Outstanding Directing for this film. It stars the incredible actors Laurence Olivier and Katharine Hepburn in their only on-screen pairing, and both won Emmys for Outstanding Performance. The rich, rolling cadences of their speech is ecstatically gorgeous to listen to. I loved the two of them individually and collectively--their chemistry together onscreen is riveting, and their golden-years romance is both hilarious and emotionally compelling. Seeing two such masters of acting interact with each other is a cinematic experience not to be missed. On top of that enormous pleasure, the witty and often quite poignant dialogue in the screenplay is astoundingly well written, and I frequently paused to replay and relish especially amusing or poetic phrases. The screenwriter is James Costigan, who won an Emmy for his contribution to this film as well. (In his illustrious career, he also won two other Emmys, one for ""Little Moon of Alban"" from 1959 and ""Eleanor and Franklin"" from 1977.) This film alone is worth the cost of this DVD. I rate this fantastic film 5 stars.

I found ""The Inheritance"" a 3.5- to 4-star experience. It was entertaining. The acting is well-done and I enjoyed the romantic elements.

I would rate ""St. Ives a 3.5- to 4-star movie. It, too, was entertaining to me also because of the acting and the romance.

I can't fairly rate Anna Karenina because, even though this is a classic, well-acted version, I am not a fan of tragic romance making it to me, because of that alone, a 2-star experience.",1372550400,,4264,5.334821428571429

5323038,4,B009ERK1ZO,"My favorite movie in this collection is ""Love among the ruins."" Lawrence Olivier is marvelous and Katherine Hepburn gives a strong performance even with evidence of essential tremors. I immensely enjoyed Lawrence Olivier's earlier performance in ""Pride and Prejudice,"" and have sought his films ever since. I also own several of Katherine Hepburn's performances. Seeing them together is a real treat. My appreciation of ""the Inheritance"" has grown with several viewings.  I, at first found ""St. Ives"" quite amusing, but now I find I have sort of lost interest in it. I was looking forward to seeing Vivian Leigh in ""Anna Karenina,"" but was disappointed in this interpenetration of Tolstoy's work. I much prefer the version starring Greta Garbo. The character in this version has a  much stronger self image and is more likable.

It is outstanding in every way for a TV film (ABC Circle Film, 1975). A must have for Laurence Olivier or Katharine Hepburn fans. I have owned the 1989 VHS tape of this for almost twenty years and like many other reviewers have wanted a top quality DVD of the film. What is currently available(2013)on DVD in the multiple British Cinema Collection(4 or 8 films, issued 2012)is better than the VHS print but, alas, is not a cleaned up and restored print for American audiences. If you have a new HD TV (as I do) you can make many adjustments to the color, contrast, and sharpness to somewhat improve the print quality, but comparing it to my old VHS copy on the same TV, I am still waiting for whoever owns the rights to this great production to please make available to us who cherish the film a print that we can fully enjoy on Twenty-first century TVs and players. It deserves a stand alone issue of highest quality possible. This film was made for TV before the days of widescreen presentation, so is in a 4 x 3(squared)format on your widescreen TV, as originally broadcast. No harm in that.

It was a fairy tale come true for Edith.  It was hard to imagine how such snobbery can exist in certain societies in the US.  And yet the people accepted this in this New England society and fit themselves into somewhat of a caste system.  To maintain a good character and integrity in light of this system allows you to rise above it and understand the littleness of people at times.  Katherine Hepburn was wonderful as always.

8540746,4,B009ERK1ZO,"Four stars for LOVE AMONG THE RUINS and ST. IVES, one star for the two other films.

LOVE AMONG THE RUINS is a classic story, the wisdom of which I appreciated when I first viewed this film - decades ago - long before I became a ""ruin"" myself. Katherine Hepburn is perfect for this role, and her feisty, incorrigible performance is a scream.  Pure Hepburn, at her best.

Unique, but paradoxically, universal story, with a bittersweet perpective.

I hope that LOVE AMONG THE RUINS does not disappear into oblivion, it's a gem, a classic gem.

The surprise - a very gratifying surprise - in this selection of four films, is ST. IVES.  One's initial impression of the film is that it is irredeemably corny and insipid.  However, stay with the film, very gradually become disarmed, and then be rewarded.  Come to appreciate the very clever and uncommon acting style which the director has deliberately adapted, with great insight, humor and effectiveness. Unique, and humorously stilted, characterizations. A joy and rare treat - very rare treat.

The other two films are clunkers.",1464912000,,1077,4.906077348066298
