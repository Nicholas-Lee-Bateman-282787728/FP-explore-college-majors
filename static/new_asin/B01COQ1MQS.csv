8753581,5,B01COQ1MQS,"One of my top comedy favorites. Definitely a movie for every man cave. Very underrated. Great story line, great dialogue and characters. Craig Robinson of Office fame is priceless as a high school dropout successful rap star whose stage name is ""Horsedick.mpeg"" and insists on people calling him that...and corrects anyone who leaves off the .mpeg , hilarious.",1487808000,,360,5.224137931034483
