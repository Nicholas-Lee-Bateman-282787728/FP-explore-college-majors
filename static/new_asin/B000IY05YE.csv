2664163,5,B000IY05YE,"In 1971 there was an acclaimed new production of Die Zauberflte at the Hamburg Opera directed by Peter Ustinov; this was during that house's golden period under the artistic direction of Rolf Liebermann. The production was taken into a TV studio and filmed, using the original sets and costumes, and this DVD is the result. It was shown on German television and wildly praised at the time. As far as I know this is its first release on DVD. There are only some mild drawbacks. First, the video quality is slightly grainy when compared with today's digital video. Second, the sound is in mono, very clear and lifelike mono to be sure, but mono nonetheless. Otherwise this presentation is absolutely first-class even by today's standards. Indeed, the casting is so amazing rich and deep  that I doubt it could be matched these days.

For sure, the plusses far outnumber the minuses. Can you imagine casting so luxurious that the small part of The Speaker is taken by Dietrich Fischer-Dieskau? Most of the cast were at the very height of their powers, and every single one them physically attractive as well as in good voice. The young (and handsome) Hans Sotin as Sarastro, laser-voiced Cristina Deutekom as a musically thrilling and spookily dramatic Queen of the Night, Franz Grundheber as a comically threatening Monastatos. The young, full-voiced American baritone William Workman as Papageno is a comic gem. His Papagena is taken beautifully by the pert American soprano Carol Malone.

Best of all, though, are the leading couple: a still-young Nicolai Gedda, in splendid voice, as Tamino, and the gorgeous and gorgeous-voiced Swiss soprano Edith Mathis as Pamina. This is a dream couple, believe me. The production is under the musical direction of the redoubtable Horst Stein and the Hamburg Philharmonic in the pit is excellent. The Hamburg chorus is full-voiced, capable of causing goosebumps in the ceremonial choral passages.

Peter Ustinov's direction is both traditional and creative. We have none of the liberties so often taken by European opera stage directors, yet Ustinov manages to give us small felicities (and not just of the comic bits) as Tamino and Pamina make their way to the final denouement.

I absolutely adored the Colin Davis/Covent Garden DVD of 'Magic Flute' and gave it a rave review three years ago. But this 35 year old production goes right up there to the top of the list with that one. I know I'll be viewing it again and again. (And for what it's worth, my 22-month-old grandson sat unmoving on my lap, transfixed by the comic action and colorful costumes as well as -- one likes to imagine -- the music. It's never too early to introduce the young ones to Magic Flute, right?)

Enthusiastically recommended.

8147639,5,B000IY05YE,"This production brought goosebumps and tears into my eyes, all at the same time.  It was divine.  All of these great names, from Nicolai Gedda and Dietrich Fischer-Dieskau, all the way to Edith Mathis, to see and hear them so young and fresh.  The only drawback was the Queen of the Night, with only fair vocal ability, and zero acting ability.  Now, how can one have a 5-star Magic Flute without a great Queen of the Night?  Well, that's how magnificent the rest of it was!",1381017600,,474,4.465116279069767
8147640,5,B000IY05YE,"It is wonderful to have this document of Gedda in the theatre. He was born in 1925 which made him 46 years old at the time of this production. His debut at the Stockholm Opera was in 1952 and he was singling leading roles all over Europe within 1-2 years. His debut at the Met was in 1958. Gedda's voice was best heard in French, German, and Russian roles where he was not required to push his lyrical voice. In Italian he is best heard in lighter Donizetti and Bellini. He had ease with the high notes but not when volume was required. Listen to the Met Vespri Broadcast from 1974 with Caballe, and Milnes. Gedda makes it through the role but is pushing his voice way too hard. If you want to sample his voice three of my favorite LPs with him are, German Opera Arias -Angel S-36624, Great Tenor Arias from French Opera Angel AV-34055,, and Arias and Duets by Donizetti and Bellini with Freni Angel S-36397. There is a CD anthology with most of this music. There are multiple full opera recordings and broadcasts.  Tamino was one of his best roles. He recorded it in a famous studio recording by Klemperer about 10 years before this performance. His joy in singing Tamino it is clearly displayed here. The remainder of the cast is very good to excellent. The production is dated by today's standards but it is Mozart's music and the singing that matters most. This is a wonderful video document of a great tenor with a wonderful cast.",1377993600,,1435,4.477099236641221
8147641,5,B000IY05YE,"die Zauberflote (The Magic Flute) is a perfect 1st opera, even for kids. Naturally the music by Mozart is great.
This production of it doesn't have to much scenery used though, but is very well sung by all and a must for opera lovers. It was produced for German TV. Nicolai Gedda's singing is excellent.......of course I'm a tenor........ :)
Highly recommended.",1376352000,,361,4.838709677419355
8147642,5,B000IY05YE,"This was a fairy tale come to life.  Musically and visually excellent.  Gedda was the perfect Tamino, Workman and Deutekom also superb.",1369353600,,135,5.090909090909091
8147643,5,B000IY05YE,"What a shame that this splendid performance is buried on page 4 of Amazon.com's listings of the Magic Flute.  In a nutshell, this is as good as it gets.  The singers are brilliant (Edith Mathis is especially awesome), the direction by Peter Ustinov is superb, and the DVD sound and picture are of the highest quality. What a musical and theatrical delight!",1301961600,,356,4.725806451612903
8147644,3,B000IY05YE,"I first saw this as a film in the 1970s when it was shown here in Australia by
the Goethe-Institut and was knocked out by it. More than 35 years later, my view is
different. On a technical level, the colour in this DVD is a bit washed out and the
sound somewhat thin. The problem seems to be more than just that it is mono.
Gedda is too old to play the handsome young Tamino and Deutekom is stolid.
The portrayal of Monostatos is, by today's standards, racist.
On the positive side, Edith Mathis as Pamina is the star of the show alongside
Hans Sotin as Sarastro. William Workman is,well, workman-like as Papageno
and Carol Malone adequate as Papagena. Fischer-Dieskau is superb in the cameo
role of the Speaker. But, in a word - disappointing.",1236124800,3,744,4.477941176470588
8147645,5,B000IY05YE,"This is a wise and delightful production, caring both for Mozart's solemnity and his comedy; in ways it feels like Bergman's Magic Flute, only lacking his cinemographic imagination.  The cast is excellent; all the major performers singing both movingly and very well.  The innocence of Edith Mathis' Pamina, the forthrightness and innocence of Gedda's Tamino, the calm wisdom of Sotin's Sarastro, and the humane comedy of Workman's Papageno all shine.  Fischer-Diskeau's performace as the Speaker is a bonus here.  Horst Stein's conducting is fine, if not extraordinary, and Peter Ustinov's staging the best I have seen other than Bergman's and less self-indulgent than Bergman's.",1188259200,10,680,5.509615384615385
8147646,5,B000IY05YE,"This FLUTE make strike some as old fashioned; and yes it is in the best sense of the word.  It sure beats the latest Flute from Salzburg Mozart22.
The cast is ideal; in fact  perfect.  The production values are true to the composer, score and libretto.  We even have a Papageno who has feathers and is really a bird catcher.  Nicolai Gedda is in rich, free full voice.  A virile Tamino.  Only Fritz Wunderlich outshines him.  Cristina Deutekom is a true STAR FLAMING QUEEN.  One of the great ones.  Edith Mathis is ideal as Pamina.  Hans Sotin is a perfect resonant Sarastro with a full rich low F.  The sets and costumes work and are never distracting or as in more recent productions ludicrous or disappointing.  Mono sound and an older video technology will only prove a problem to those who demand the newest and highest in sound and video.  The sound can be a little strident at times in the strings.  The orchestra and conductor are fine.  I HIGHLY RECOMMEND THIS MAGIC FLUTE; IT TRULY HAS SOME MAGIC ABOUT IT!!!",1183593600,3,1018,4.541436464088398
8147647,5,B000IY05YE,"Here is a real find: a 1971 film on DVD of Die

For me, this film ranks as one of the ""best of"" releases

this year. Yet another outstanding release of this opera. I didn't know this film existed, but I am sure

glad all these treasures are being pulled out of the

vaults. This is one of the supreme examples of Mozart

performances of its time. Peter Ustinov's work created

fantastic results: whimsical, grave, and altogether

delightful. Everything, sets, costumes are on the

traditional side, but they are colorful, truly

fairy-tale-like ~~~ it's a magical concept. Even the

lip-synching of the music is done better than you might

expect; it doesn't look too obvious (well, most of the

time).

The most striking and magisterial performance here is Hans

Sotin's truly God-like Sarastro. The role has, in my

estimation never been better sung. Or acted. Tall, very

distinguished, handsome and noble in bearing, the youthful

bloom in Sotin's tone is of a refulgent, sappy beauty you

rarely hear in this role. I was totally unprepared for

this. The line, legato and phrasing are of the first rank:

only Ulrik Cold in the Bergman film can vie for a majestic

Sarastro of the highest order.

Nicolai Gedda's Tamino. Perfect diction, full-bodied tone,

welcome from the nasal tenorinos you usually hear, and

exquisite phrasing throughout. He looks a bit old for the

role with a terrible wig, but he acts and portrays the

young prince with a surprising degree of involvement.

Here we have the young Edith Mathis, a beautiful Pamina,

both in presence and voice. Creamy, appealing tone, a

superb actress, expressive, winning and very touching. The

aria is ideal.

The two love birds, William Workman and Carol Malone, are

wonderful. Workman has an open, friendly face and fresh

tone, and is an endearing Papageno. He and Malone are funny

and sweet together, their mating duet marvelously charming.

Cristina Deutekom - a rare opportunity to see her preserved

on a filmed document. At the time, an unparalleled Queen.

Big, glinty tone, dramatic, and thrusting. The high Fs

spark off like hammers on anvil: this is one Queen you

NEVER will think sounds younger than the daughter.

Disappointingly, she does not act very effectively for the

camera; much of the time she just stares right into it. Had

this been the way she was directed? In the first aria, the

camera is simply fixed right on her. She doesn't move - at

all. The voice is far more expressive than her face. She

comes off much better in the second aria, and boy, does she

wallop the high Fs (it is a pity that somuch of her

dialogue was cut). It is much the same as on the Solti

recording. The gargled, famously disconnected notes in the

triplets are much the same. Nevertheless, this kind of a

voice in this role surmounts all reservations.

Dietrich-Fischer Dieskau is luxury casting as the Speaker.

He looks slightly bemused, but the gravitas works.

Franz Grundheber is a merry Monostatos, reveling in his

debauchery.

So, then, another excellent Zauberflte on DVD. Best of

all, a standout of a historic document. None of these

singers were often captured in a visual format, and this

one does them all proud.

Highly recommended.",1165968000,40,3617,4.941373534338358
