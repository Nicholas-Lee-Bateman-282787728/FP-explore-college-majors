8218357,5,B000VE4UKQ,"I've always been a huge, huge, HUGE fan of Standard Deviants.  I used their series of DVD's to teach myself enough that I was able to test out of English 101, English 102, Psychology 101 and even Growth and Development when I first started college (at the age of 38). I also used their videos to help me get good grades in Anatomy & Physiology, Algebra, Chemistry and Microbiology.  Their videos can be a little juvenile, but when I used them in my late 30's, I couldn't have done as well as I did without them. I'd recommend them to every student!",1385769600,,548,4.362745098039215
8218358,5,B000VE4UKQ,"I bought all three volumes of the videos and they helped me ace my statistics class!  Watching a video engages and reaffirms what the textbook says, if the video is of high quality; these statistic videos are and they help relax the viewer by carefully timed humorous examples.  I highly recommend the extra investment to ensure a well-rounded understanding of statistics--sometimes a scary subject!",1366848000,,399,5.21875
