 made for Region 3. I had to return them unseen.",1375574400,,115,3.7916666666666665
7900046,4,7799819774,gave this as a gift to my mother (age 91) whose first language is chinese and who read and understood the original.  she enjoyed the TV show.  the plot line lends itself to soap opera treatment and no one is the poorer for it.,1360022400,,226,4.113636363636363
7900047,5,7799819774,"This sad story will make  anyone interested in Chinese history and culture very happy.  To read the English subtitles, however, one must use the pause button on the remote because some of them are shown too quickly.  The costumes,sets, and acting are most excellent. I'm studying Mandarin so it helps to listen.  too bad they use the simplified characters when the show new characters.",1355356800,,385,4.96875
7900048,5,7799819774,"I have seen many productions of ""Dream of the Red Chamber"" or ""Dream of Red Mansions"" and have read it as well. Although my older Chinese friends don't prefer this version (perhaps for sentimental reasons), I do.

The production is impeccable, beautiful and deeply moving. For the western viewer who is not thoroughly familiar with the story, there are many undertones that are easy to miss. Puritanical production values (and good taste) preclude showing some parts of the story graphically so it is not necessarily clear why a young beauty commits suicide or a young man is banished from home.

This story combined with ""Romance of the Three Kingdoms"", ""Warriors of the Marsh"" and ""Journey to the West"" define an apex of world literature that has been shut off from us westerners for too long.

The scenes of what happens to Lady Jia at the end remind us why great literature must remain a part of civilized life no matter how technically advanced we become.",1348531200,5,960,4.806060606060606
7900049,5,7799819774,"I have read many versions of the book in translation over the years. It's wonderful to see it dramatized so well. The characters as just as I pictured them.

It's a little tricky to figure out how to enable the English subtitles.",1299456000,8,229,4.4523809523809526
