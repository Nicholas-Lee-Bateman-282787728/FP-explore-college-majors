1666636,5,B00005UM46,"Some things you just don't question. This anime happens to be one of them. But, to warn you ahead of time, an average person will go through one of these three reactions: You will watch it and love it; you will pound your head against the TV and try to make sense of it; or you will stare blankly at the TV and think to yourself: ""WHY did I buy this?!""
Me? I belong in the first reaction. I bought the DVD because the cover looked cool. But, I've learned that covers aren't everything. I loved this series from the opening animation to the ending credits. It IS a bit obscure (as several other reviewers mentioned...), but that's the appeal of it. There are lots of anime out there that leaves the watcher wanting to delve deeper into the ultimate question: Why?
I think that this anime series acheives this better than any others that I have previously watched. The lack of detail in the animation and the use of darker colors add a depth to the plot and animation that I love. Some people WILL be turning up their noses at this anime. I say that it's their loss.
The confusion of the main character is tangible---you wish that you could fall into the plot and just help him; make sure that everything will be alright. The main character is plunged into situations that he doesn't understand and has an innocence...a naiviety...that is so hard to find in anime or real life. It will either attract you or repel you.
I DO recommend this anime series. I love it. There are lots of anime series that I LIKE, but very few that I LOVE. It is completely worth the ...+ you'll be forking over. Just watch it and find out.",1029888000,7,1615,4.368770764119601
1666637,1,B00005UM46,"I would have to agree with some of the other reviewers here that the detail is amazing, but that does not make up for this title's shortcommings.
The bigest problem I have is that the scenes don't really connect. It's almost like watching a manga.
The characters movements didn't really seem smooth either. Not what I'd expect from a modern anime.
Another problem for me was the colors. There wasn't much use of natural colors. Each scene had aporx 6 colors to it (almost like they didn't have enough $$ to make the film).  Each scene also had different colors than the previous. That added to the disconnected feeling.
Overall it gave me a headache. The plot was very average. If you are a liberal arts major you might like how abstract it is, but it's pretty bad in my opinion.",1028678400,,779,4.524822695035461
1666638,5,B00005UM46,"I remember picking up Trigun, another of Pioneer's animes, two years ago. It was awesome but obscure in the anime scene. Now, it's become more mainstream than anyone could have imagined it would be two years ago.
The Soultaker, I believe, will follow suit.
The story starts out fairly simple. Kyosuke, a seemingly normal teenager, is stabbed and fatally wounded by his mother. Buried, a woman named Maya digs up Kyosuke's body, having a feeling he is not yet dead. And indeed, for some reason, Kyosuke lives. That's when the story gets complicated and calls upon you to pay close attention to the story. Why would his mother do such a thing? And how in the world is he still living? Before any questions can be answered, Maya is kidnapped by a mysterious organization and with the help of a mysterious stranger, Shiro, sets out to rescue her, revealing secrets to Kyosuke's past and pertaining to Maya.
The story is absolutely gripping. This is one of those anime's in which you have to really watch it to enjoy. It leaves you hanging almost every time wanting more. The sheer mystery of the plot draws you in. The characters themselves have a very human feel to them, especially Kyosuke, whose dedication to save Maya at all costs is very genuine.
The music is awesome especially the Opening theme ""Soultaker"" and the ending theme ""Memory."" But the music is really just icing on the cake...
The drawing style is what will either draw in fans or garner criticism from people. MOST of the scenes consist of only a couple colors and are not very detailed, adding style to this anime. However, this very lack of unnecessary detail is what turns away most people from this supreb anime. To each his own. To be honest I was quite uncomfortable with it during the first episode, but it really grows on you. Most creative style I've seen in a while.

1666639,4,B00005UM46,"Well where to begin... I have a friend from japan who is very cool. He sends me all the new anime. A long time ago he sent me soultaker and at first I thought it [stinks].The animation was weird and seeing as I speek no japanese I had no idea what was going on. By the way i loved the music. When I next talked with my friend he explained what the hel.l these people were saying. The story is actually a really unique one. A virus and a very messed up family, I mean I never saw shiro being the VPs Brother. oops  don't wanna give anything away. Anyhow the animation is actually great if you look at it from an artistic point of veiw. Its not like a lot of anime it holds a very distinct stile. So its not perfect but its ok. And seeing as you cant really dis the story if you can get past the unusual animation its flawless. Just see the end. WOW.",1019692800,,848,3.988235294117647
1666640,1,B00005UM46,"Hey I'm not a professional critic who compares the intensity of a character and the color scheme the director used blah, blah, blah! All I know is what I like and what I don't like. I personally think the animation in this anime is horrible. Every scene feels like I'm looking at a Pablo Picasso drawing but hey that's just me. For you guys who think the animation is awesome, whatever floats your boat. The story is boring and to be honest I fail to see one and what little story it gives fails to peek my interest what so ever. Perhaps the following eps really puts things into prospective and really makes this anime good. Otherwise from this DVD alone it makes me feel I just wasted good money on garbage. I suggest if you guys want to see a good anime see Vampire hunter D: Bloodlust or a short film that leaves with a lot of unanswered questions but the story peeks your interest and the animation is excellent watch Blood: the last vampire. Those are the most recent out that I feel people would enjoy seeing.",1019174400,,1016,4.380952380952381
1666641,4,B00005UM46,"I begin this review first with that I almost never write reviews on any of my viewings or purchases,but this one raise my browe. Plain and simple, the first EP puzzle's if not wierds you out then the second captivates you.
the third one completes the addiction to this series in which I found to be very intertaining on many level's
My list of rating this animation is EXCELLENT!!! the storyline
SUPPERB!!!! the character's are VERY INVOLVING TO SAY THE LEAST
thou the main character is a little annoying "" what what what's happening"" HA HA HA ,  But to say  the least  you won't feel ript off if you purchase this excellent series.
I'm also one to encourage poeple to rent first, dvd's aren't exactly a dime a dozen, get my drift, you may like something different ""ya know"" I hope this been helpful like I said idon't do this much.",1017532800,,832,4.4605263157894735
1666642,3,B00005UM46,"Soul taker overall is pretty darn good. However don't feel bad if u are confused by the first few episodes. Overall things do pick up and it becomes very cool and worth watching. If you like horror, science ficion and mystery, this is the anime for you.",1016841600,,253,4.404255319148936
1666643,4,B00005UM46,"First, many will compare this with FLCL (which is an earlier release in Japan), and even say that it's an anime made hot on the trails of it's predecessor (I dit it at first). Both start with situations that will leave you wondering what's going on, and quickly develop on a full complex story.
There's where they're different. While FLCL focuses on comedy with lot's of action (there are a lot of references on the Gainax universe on this one), Soul Taker focuses on action, with some comedy touchs.
As any new release, the quality of image and sound is terrific, and being enhanced for widescreen TVs is a plus, for sure. The colours on this one are bright and vivid, sometimes the contrast of colors, as bright red against a black background, green and blue against white, adds a nice sense of aesthetic which is found nowhere else on anime (only the Utena movie has come closer to this). Not much of the plot is given on this disc, but you wouldn't think that it would happen so early anyway.
As a side note, there's an interesting bit of translation that may be interesting for you to know. The ""flickers"" are spelt on japanese as FURIKA, which is a way to say in engrish, english words being used with japanese phonems, the word ""freak"", which is a more appropriate way to describe what the flickers are when compared to regular humans on this title.",1016496000,2,1356,4.538775510204082
1666644,5,B00005UM46,"WOW!!! Amazing, a great title this Soultaker. Top notch animation with deep storytelling. Vibrant colors and great character designs, Tatsunoko are giving it all here. This is a great series with high production values and i enjoyd every minute of it. 75 minutes of action and drama. All this is worth four stars, then why give it five? Well, it's because of the great extras that comes with the dvd :-)
Creditless opening and ending secuences are what every one wants.",1014940800,,469,4.802469135802469
1666645,5,B00005UM46,"This is definetly a great anime, one of the best in a while. Superb animation is the first thing you will notice. There is not one normal angle on a shot, the colors are vibrant and detailed, and it is all blended so very nicely. Character designs are top-notch as well. The story is super deep an after these first three eps, you'll need to know the whole story. Do not believe what you may hear about the plot. It is confusing only for the first couple eps. After words you can enjoy the energy given off by this title. I have seen the whole series and it is worth every penny. I don't know about the dub, though, the eps i saw were all in subs.",1014076800,6,647,4.102362204724409
7955144,4,B00005UM46,cool looking anime never seen anything like it but the downside is it's hard to see it because it's too dark it's hard to see the anime and some scenes,1426464000,,151,4.066666666666666
7955145,2,B00005UM46,"Anime: 6/10 (above average)

Product 2/5

7955146,5,B00005UM46,"Soultaker is a great series I would give it 4.5 stars if I could since it's not quiet perfect. Firts off a warnign this is  not a light happy series. This one bleeds darkness and seriousness. Which is nice, though there are a few jokes. There are plenty of twists and action to keep your attenion. The only thing I can hold against the series is that confusing way non-action senses are presented which can confuse the unalert. Hint focus on the words and faces not the ever shifting background. Other then that its a near perfect series. and since it only has four volumes that are rather cheap you don't an excuse not to buy this series.",1159228800,,639,4.415254237288136
7955147,3,B00005UM46,"This show is above average. As an action anime, it doesn't cut it, but the visuals and characters make this seris. The backgrounds and colors stand out and remind of an Art Nuvoue feel. The characters are unique, and even though you only know then for a short time, you tend to care about what happens to them.

The pacing is fast though. This is a show that needs to be watched a second time before the details are made clear, but it's still worth buying. This show spawned Komugi Nakahara, and if you have ever seen Nurse Witch Komugi, this is the precursor.",1134777600,3,560,4.384615384615385
7955148,4,B00005UM46,"The Soultaker series is really good. It is a little confusing in the beginning and it keeps you guessing.  However, it has a lot of action in it to keep glued to the TV. If you like that type of movie then this is the perfect series for you.",1120089600,,241,3.9183673469387754
7955149,4,B00005UM46,"Kyosuke Date is not a happy camper. Frankly he's justified in his rage. When we first meet him he's being stabbed in the back by his mother, who then dies. The second time we see him he's being dug out of his grave in which he's been buried alive. No, it hasn't been a good weekend for Kyosuke. To complicate matters he finds that he has a long lost sister somewhere that evil companies are trying to find and he can now suddenly turn into a mutant demon thing that can kick major butt. Not that Kyosuke's thrilled about the transforming into a hideous demon thing, but compared to the rest of his weekend, that's a fairly good point.

The Monster Within doesn't show it's hand very much when it comes to the major plot of the series. All three episodes are mainly concerned with Kyosuke trying to figure out who his sister is and random characters of the sinister variety keep popping up and looking threatening. There's also Shiro, a helpfully homicidal mystery man who looks slightly like a mime who's joined up with Kyosuke.

At it's heart, Soultaker is a gothic horror piece inflected with a good bit of angst and bullets. Kyosuke didn't ask to be put in the position he's in, but he's going to have to live with that now and make the best of it. While it's a little confusing since the audience knows no more than the main character, The Soultaker still deserves a place in anime libraries.",1097625600,2,1396,4.470588235294118
7955150,5,B00005UM46,"According to  Amazon reviewer charles solomon, SOULTAKER is a derivative of anime series like gasaraki & evangelon (does every title have to be compared to evangelon? sheesh!) I strongly disagree!
instead ST adapts elements from the DEVILMAN/GUYVER/GENOCYBER/DETONATOR ORGUN/X-MEN genre but with a touch of DARIO ARGENTO italian horror.
the plot/storyline may be confusing at first, but it your'e patient and suspend your disbelief you'll eventually be taken in
it's refreshing to see something slightly different from the contemporaly anime shows. the colors have a ""PSYCHO NOIR"" kinda feel and a style simular to Mike Mignola's HELLBOY Comics. the action/pacing is more appealing than the aforementioned series GARSAKI and EVANGELION which to me are very slow and tedious at times. Soultaker also has one of the coolest intro themes. another classic from the legendary TATSUNOKO studios (gatchaman94,Casshan,Hurricane polymar)SOULTAKER is a must have addition for the scifi, anime, comicbook enthusiast.",1076889600,4,1005,5.79054054054054
7955151,4,B00005UM46,"I was completely confused during the first episode.  I too felt that scenes were random, weapons were too strange (Hospital's needles), and any reason for watching was not given.  But I stuck through the first DVD and it all came together in the third episode.  If you give yourself at least three episodes then you should be hooked into the plot; a plot that is sure to take you strange but interesting places.",1069804800,,411,4.602739726027397
7955152,1,B00005UM46,"the soul taker to me is a running joke with my freinds. What WERE they thinking? The points of view were completely random, people were spitting out dialogue at random moments, it was like the characters were cast in stone, because trhey barely moved. AND WHAT IS WITH THE TEA??? I have never in my life seen an anime that people drank so much tea! The only anime that is more pointless then this was bey blade. One of the things that i really didn't get was..well there was a fight scene, then suddenly, SPARROWS?? There was randomly a flock of sparrows. And the artists, obviously had an odd obsession with stained glass windows because people were being dyed random colours. So my overall review is..DON'T WASTE YOUR TIME!!",1058572800,,726,4.635658914728682
7955153,5,B00005UM46,"The very first episode might be very confusing, but the second and third ones are better because then the creators sorta half explain what happened in a weird twisted sort of way.  Also, in the credits, I've recognized the Japanese voice actor of Duo from Gundam Wing and the American voice actor of Quatre of Gundam Wing(Kyosuke's voice). I love this series, the animation is great and it has a plotline that actually make a person think!",1036713600,3,439,4.701298701298701
