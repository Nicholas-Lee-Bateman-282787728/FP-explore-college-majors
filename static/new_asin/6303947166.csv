742044,5,6303947166,"Scott Bakula leaps into this action-pack film with both feet running. Playing a desperate pilot who must attempt to uncover and stop a plot to over-throw the Earth with the help of Elizabeth Pena, Bakula does a  wonderful job throughout the movie as he once again shows his wide range of  acting abilities. The movie has some good special effects although the  aliens leave a little to be desired. This is a great movie for those who  like suspence in science fiction, but don't want blood and gore. If you're  trying to quit smoking this movie is for you.",964569600,17,556,4.575757575757576
7857268,5,6303947166,"As a fan of the original show I found the premise of this remake to be interesting on the takeover of the earth.  ""Leave them to destroy the environment themselves"".  Corporate America must be full of implants!  On another note getting these tapes new was very cool.  Lastly I love Scott Bakula...I would watch him read the phonebook!",1459555200,,334,4.706896551724138

7857271,3,6303947166,"I bought the two-Video Cassette edition, and though the quality was fine on my old RCA VCR, the story itself frankly stunk.

Plots:

If you watched the TV series The Invaders with Roy Thinnes as the character who has seen the aliens and tries in every episode to thwart their plans of domination, you will most likely NOT enjoy this mini-series, starring Scott Bakula.

I have enjoyed Scott's later work on The Enterprise and Quantum Leap, and in this film his acting is pretty good despite the awful script.

He's a divorced dad and the film concentrates on relationships for a bit, but is very uneven in its tale.  The aliens when they die vibrate a lot.  They also vibrate a lot when they are taking over a human.  This never happens on the TV series.

This is supposed to happen in the same universe too.  Even Roy Thinnes shows up out of nowhere, gives Scott a book about aliens and goes away.  Huh?

The subway scene where the aliens want to destroy it so the Earth can pollute more (yeah, makes little sense).  I did enjoy how Scott saved the day here, with some modicum of suspense.

Bottom Line:

Unlike the TV series from the Sixties, there is no even plot on the film.  What are the alien's purposes for this planet?  Why do they vibrate rather than burn up?  Where was the Roy Thinnes' character all these years?

And who the heck is the annoying talk show host throughout the film?  Never explained and though he makes for fun copy, is literally annoying!

Not recommended.

Enjoy this instead:

7857273,5,6303947166,"This is a sci-fi thriller with a common 'plot' of an alien race slowly infiltrating the human race and taking over earth.  Of course.
The interesting thing is takeover 'symptoms' of these Aliens (smoggy and dirty air, flies swarm around them, they only eat steak & eggs), in my mind mirror what we see manifesting in our world now.  Chem-trails sprayed throughout the worlds skies for weather control, sun blocking, and much more (aluminum, strontium, barium, and human blood cells... Morgellon's disease), GMO's and pesticides massively corrupting the food chain, killing masses of bee's , animals, and water sources... if we continue down this path, the earth will be inhabitable by the current human. HERE'S THE 'RUB'!...
The Invaders have to have very dirty smog filled air, flies swarm everywhere they go, and want to change the atmosphere too.

Did you see the Fringe series to the end? Same thing, techno advanced psychopathic 'reptilian' Aliens need dirty air, and are taking control of the earth.

Anyways, I always like Scott Bakula, and it was a pleasant twist to have Roy Thinnes, reprise his role as David Vincent (also, starred as the hands-on-healer IRS Agent, X-Files).
It is an enjoyable sci-fi mini-series.",1373846400,3,1224,5.074626865671642
7857274,4,6303947166,Well I like Scott Bakula. He's a good actor and did a good job in the film. The problem I had with this movie is it did not follow the storyline of the original television at all. This head shaking vibrating business when the aliens were trying to control humans was NOT in the original TV show and actually was kind of ridiculous. If the movie had followed the original storyline and had similar but updated special effects the movie could have been a home run. It was obvious the writer was trying to create something different and unigue but that is where he or she failed miserably. That is not what people wanted to see. The people who went to watch this movie went to see the old Invaders but with better special effects. What they got was a poorly written film and mediocre special effects.,1301356800,6,797,4.428571428571429
7857275,3,6303947166,"THE INVADERS was one of my favorite t.v. shows when I was growing up; Roy Thinnes was superb as David Vincent, the man trying to tell the world that aliens were taking over the earth by inhabiting the bodies of humans.  Twenty years after the series went off the air, THE INVADERS became a made for TV movie, and obviously a pilot for another series that didn't come to fruition.  Hence, you're given a three hour movie that is not given commercial breaks; therefore, you have some tedious dialogue and redundant chases that ultimately bog the movie down.  The special effects, what little they are, are below average, and the direction needed some Geritol.

Scott Bakula as the new David Vincent tries hard but ultimately his actions seem foolish and he's never really convincing as the possessed human.  Richard Thomas gets by in his role, but he never possesses the menace he should.  Terrance Knox as Detective Coyle has a hard time showing the changes once he's been programmed.  His cocking of the head left and right is supposed to show his implant; it's actually hilarious.  Elizabeth Pena brings no life to her role as Bakula's reluctant assistant; needed an actress with more vitality and intensity.  Pena always seems to underplay her roles to the point she looks bored.  Thinnes himself makes a cameo appearance and seems as excited as a slug.

THE INVADERS is not awful; it entertains, even at its lengthy three hours; it's ending is also very disappointing.",1090800000,18,1471,4.820717131474104
7857276,1,6303947166,"Original version is far better that this ""pilot"" version. Special effects in the Quinn Martin Production were so real...  look at the way this version show the death of an alien.  Did you see the UFO's here? And the main character has nothing to do compared to the famous David Vincent role. Forget it!",981072000,20,302,4.574074074074074
7857277,2,6303947166,"Long before David Duchovny's Fox Mulder was chasing alien conspirators, Roy Thinnes in the person of David Vincent was on a one-man crusade to reveal the aliens among us.  This 1995 miniseries stars Scott Bakula in a  similar role.  Thinnes appears briefly as Vincent.  Richard Thomas, who  seems not to have aged a day since ""The Waltons,"" is one of the  humans taken over by the malevolent aliens.
A routine exercise in science  fiction politics, the film benefits from a knock-out performance from Jon  Polito, late of ""Homicide: Life on the Streets,"" as a harried  subway operator.  His is the only reason for viewing although he doesn't  appear until the film's last quarter.",964828800,7,680,4.929203539823009
