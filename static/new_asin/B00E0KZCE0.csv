8599791,5,B00E0KZCE0,I love this dvd. Im on dialysis and find myself always tired and have a hard time getting around. This dvd is my new way to start the day. It gives me energy I simply didn't have before. The routines start out simple enough that even a newbie like me can do it. I recommend this for everyone!,1524355200,,292,4.051724137931035
