8428705,5,B004GGS1J6,"Growing up with 'Monty Python's Flying Circus' led to other amazing PBS ""Britcoms"" and 'The Goodies' was always an extraordinary guilty pleasure. And now this collection is available to enable anyone to experience the full-throttle insanity of this classic trio. The kids will certainly enjoy family favorites like ""Kitten Kong"" and ""The Goodies & The Beanstalk."" But beware -- episodes like 'South Africa' take on apartheid with ruthless abandon, so keep in mind that this is a ""period piece"" and definitely contains some unfortunate epithets! No wonder the program languished on the shelves as long as it did. But be brave, and embrace the inherent goodness of Goodies. If you do, you will be rewarded by Bill Oddie's musical genius -- and Graeme Garden's crazed scientific mastery (the tricks on ""The Movies"" episode are breathtaking). And then there's Tim Brooke-Taylor, always doing his best to uphold the British ideals of the Queen and company. So if you're tired of stuffy and self-important comedy, check this out. It's part of a strong tradition of can-do comedy that stretches from The Three Stooges through The Monkees and Monty Python. And then, it takes it straight off the edge -- so be sure to pack a parachute!!",1337299200,2,1228,5.0245098039215685
