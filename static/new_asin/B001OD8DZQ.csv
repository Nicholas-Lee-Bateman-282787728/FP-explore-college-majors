3730131,5,B001OD8DZQ,"Beautifully done short film into the home ( to me , small country estate) where he spent as much time as he could , and you will see why in this short film. Beautiful and homey , with various pretty displays of their home life and a really nice peek into the personal side of the Churchhills . Many different objects of lovely small art decor and very well done paintings by Churchill himself. All kinds of interesting things to see. Loved every thing about the house inside and the views are soothing and pastoral. The one and only thing I did not car for was th dark wood in and around the staircase. Quite a talented , interesting WELL rounded man who was a gift to Great Britain , but then again I am a CHURCHILL fan , so those that are not , will I think still love the home and grounds anyway , if not the man. I stopped the video several times when I saw lovely objects of art , certain designs and many other things that caught my attention. Enjoyed it very much",1388707200,,970,4.164893617021277

3730133,5,B001OD8DZQ,"A beautiful home.  It seemed like a place where Churchill could have ""left"" the war for a few days.  The film takes you across the gorgeous landscape & the inside tour is beautiful.  The disc captured the beauty of the house & quiet beauty of the landscape.",1368921600,4,257,4.425531914893617
3730134,5,B001OD8DZQ,"It's hard to find fault with a guided tour of Churchill's beloved Chartwell with his own daughter, The Lady Soames, as your guide. Because she grew up there, and understood what it meant to her father, this DVD has a much more personal touch than the run of the mill tour of a famous person's home.",1270166400,5,298,4.339285714285714

3730146,4,B001OD8DZQ,A pleasing glimpse into Chartwell.  So much more time could however be spent to better understand the significance the old home had on one of the greatest figures of the 20th Century - and the history it therefore holds.,1441756800,,220,4.641025641025641

3730150,2,B001OD8DZQ,"I visited Chartwell and was delighted to see there was a televised tour guided by Churchill's daughter Mary.  Sadly, they appeared to have only 30 minutes of material for an hour long show, filling the rest of the time with lengthy shots of flower vases and open windows.  I would love to hear more of Mary's stories.  I just need to keep the fast forward button on my remote within easy reach.",1432857600,,394,4.444444444444445

3730160,4,B001OD8DZQ,"How lovely to tour Chartwell with Churchill's daughter.  I wondered what she was like ever since I read what she said to him as he passed: 'In addition to all the feelings a daughter has for a loving, generous father, I owe you what every Englishman, woman & child does--Liberty itself.'",1424390400,,287,4.627450980392157
3730161,5,B001OD8DZQ,"Having admired Winston Churchill for most of my adult life, it was a delight to see this film with Lady Soames, Sir Winstons daughter shareing her memories of Chartwell.

3730165,5,B001OD8DZQ,"I am a devoted admirer of WSC, and TEL also-- have been since my college days 40 years ago.  This video of Chartwell delivered a sense of WSC's human-ness.  No politics, no WWII history, just a look into the private life of a world figure when he was not 'performing'.  I am astounded at energy he poured into the place.  It would have been the life's work of an ordinary man, but he did it in more-or-less in his spare time.  Amazing.  For those who have been through the biographies, the ducks, and swans will be soulful reminders.",1404000000,,533,4.387755102040816
3730166,5,B001OD8DZQ,I love history and these old homes fascinate me.  Very well done!  I really appreciate the way they shared the history of the home and all that had happened to it throughout the years.,1402617600,,184,4.382352941176471

3730174,5,B001OD8DZQ,"Almost any story involving Churchill is bound to be interesting; this is no exception. This film explores both this beautiful country house that Churchill resurrected as well as the life he lived in it. His daughter's narration makes the story of Churchhill's life and of living in this house very close. I would consider Chartwell, certainly for any Churchhill fan, to be a destination attraction. That is, I would travel again to England just to visit this lovely place.",1389052800,,472,4.987341772151899
