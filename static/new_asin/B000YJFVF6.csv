8233074,4,B000YJFVF6,This was a decent show. However anyone familiar with the Doolittle raid will already know all of the information presented. There was little new information in it. However it was still worth the watch. Its best for those that are unfamiliar with the raid and the events leading up to it.,1474761600,,287,4.647058823529412
8233075,5,B000YJFVF6,"As a youngster, I knew someone, from my neighborhood, who was a Doolittle Raider. Inspiring story and important to know about. Very good book.",1461974400,,142,4.958333333333333
8233076,5,B000YJFVF6,"I thought this DVD was excellent for three reasons: 1) Oliver North's
insightful narration, 2) the historic films & photos, and 3) especially
the interviews with six of the surviving Raiders telling what it was
really like to be on those B-25s and the aftermath.  It sounded like the
first critic was more interested in amusement rather than real history.",1235174400,3,355,4.916666666666667
8233077,1,B000YJFVF6,"without a doubt the absolute worst program i have had the misfortune to witnes. everything about this program is the worst.his over dramatization.in my humble opinion the movie 'THIRTY SECONDS OVER TOKYO""is much easier to handle.",1200268800,,229,5.388888888888889
