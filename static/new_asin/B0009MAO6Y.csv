8062936,5,B0009MAO6Y,"As you may already know, this DVD concludes the Battle City season, which is the first reason to buy this - assuming you already own the rest of the epsidoes in this story arc.

The episodes in this DVD are:
140. The Final Face-Off: Part III
141. The Final Face-Off: Part IV
142. The Final Face-Off: Part V
143. One for the Road (incorrectly titled as ""One for the Road: Part I"")
144. Looking Back and Moving Ahead (incorrectly titled as ""One for the Road: Part II"")

These episodes continue the Pharaoh's awesome duel with Marik!  (The first two parts of THE FINAL FACE-OFF can be seen on the previous DVD in the series:&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Yu-Gi-Oh-Battle-for-the-Bronze-Season-3-Volume-4/dp/B0009CTTUG/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Yu Gi Oh -  Battle for the Bronze (Season 3, Volume 4)</a>).  To review what's happened so far, The Pharaoh and Marik's evil side are dueling a treacherous Shadow Game where Yugi will remained trapped in the Shadow Realm if the Pharaoh looses, but Marik's good side will get trapped in the Shadow Realm if Marik's dark sides looses!  What will the Pharaoh do?  Even though he has just recently played Obelisk the Tormentor, Marik can play the Winged Dragon of Ra whenever he wants with any of his numerous Magic Cards.  Although I will not spoil anything for those who haven't seen it yet, I'll just say that Odion plays a big part in this duel...  Though I won't tell you who wins, in ONE FOR THE ROAD, the tournament is finally over and Kaiba is eager to forget all about it because he lost, so he decides to blow up the island!  However, he did not think of everything because Alcatraz is set to explode in 1 hour but the Battle Ship's engines are not working and there's no way to get out!  Lastly, LOOKING BACK AND MOVING AHEAD basically summarizes all of the Battle City episodes through a number of flashbacks.  Plus, the end kind of hints the Pharaoh/Tea romance.

This DVD is great and it's definitely something you should buy if you're into Yu-Gi-Oh!  The episodes are cool and the whole plot itself is really well written and organized (it does deal with more than a card game - as you know, this season focuses heavily on Ancient Egypt).  I recommend at least seeing these fantastic episodes!",1198713600,3,2291,4.883720930232558
8062937,5,B0009MAO6Y,"In this set of episodes, the Battle City is down to the wire. My favorite character, Marik(not Yami Marik) is the center of the events. Most of his character is known in this set. It seemed almost if Yugi was only a side-note for a while. Even though I dislike dub, this was still good enough for me.

The scene when Marik talks to his brother for the last time (or so he thinks at that moment) is one of the most beautifully drawn of any anime I've seen. If only the voice actor sounded like Marik's age for once and kept the poignant music. And didn't use the gold stuff when someone's mind is snatched.

(And also a shame is that the Ishtars won't appear for many episodes after this with such a simple exit...)",1129939200,8,714,4.242647058823529
8062938,5,B0009MAO6Y,I love the Yugi vs. Marik battle it is the most intense and awesome battle I ever seen and in my opinion the best duel fought in the Yu-Gi-Oh series. I highly recommend this if you are a fan oy Yu-Gi-Oh!,1126137600,9,203,3.975609756097561
