8419972,5,B004AC6PSU,"The male lead in this movie, same guy from prison break, is freaking horrible. The acting is bad at best, but luckily the rest if the cast is pretty ok. The effects are really good and actually somewhat disturbing. I liked it quite a bit, it just sticks with u, the story and especially the ghosts.",1372809600,,298,4.339285714285714
8419973,4,B004AC6PSU,"I am the kind of person that likes movies like this so i thought i would
give them a try. The audio/Video were very good on this blue-ray
double movie deal and i liked both of them.

The Gravedancers started out a little strange,so thought it would not
be that good,but it started to get more interesting and ended up
being pretty good for me.

Wicked Little Things was interesting at the start,this too had some
strange parts,but i did like this one too.

I have seen better movies than this but then i have seen MANY
MORE that are not as good as these,so i am pleased with them.",1365206400,,580,4.254545454545455
