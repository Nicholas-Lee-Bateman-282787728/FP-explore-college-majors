It was pretty much impossible to follow the sequence of events with the poorly  integrated flashbacks. Gosh...got to say the ""lead"" role male was almost impossible to understand.  His speech was not at all clear.  One thing I felt confident about prior to buying this DVD was that the cinematography would be beautiful.  Another major  disappointment.  There were just a few short shots, or views of the landscape and seascape that captured a bit of the beauty offered at that location.  Someone really screwed the pooch on this as that could have been the only redeeming quality of this film.  The actors could not act, the soundtrack, or ""music"" in this film was shameless, it was very difficult to impossible to follow the story and the beauty of the area was very much overlooked.  I thought this DVD would be a nice little, quirky type of indie film but was one major disappointment.  Baja/Mx/pdc",1424563200,,1074,4.861878453038674
7888841,3,6305382093,"Tracing Cowboys is flawed, but oddly beautiful made more so by knowing of the death of the lead actor before the actual completion of the film.  The cinematography is the same. Sometimes overly ""artsy"" and sometimes beautiful.  The filming local in the Baja Peninsula is incredibly beautiful making it a worthwhile look just in itself.  Don't expect ""Great Expectations"", just enjoy it for what it is.",1342310400,2,401,5.045454545454546
7888842,5,6305382093,"A very touching and witty film, the whole production is one of the higest quality. I have  seen this so many times and it just keeps getting better, the whole story is one of depth and courage. Laughs are found in the most  unexpected of places,Such as the scattering of Ramon's and Drew's ashes,  it's a joyful celibration of love and life and the things that bring people  together.",943488000,6,384,4.521739130434782
7888843,5,6305382093,"I loved this movie.  Funny, touching, very realistic.  I have been searching for the soundtrack and the Video for almost 2 years.  It's a gay-aids movie that doesn't take you where you'd expect- It's everything  that ""Longtime Companion"" should have been with some of the best  acting I've seen.  I cannot recommend it highly enough.",921801600,5,333,4.963636363636364
