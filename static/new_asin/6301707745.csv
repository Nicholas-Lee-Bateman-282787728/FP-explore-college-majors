2794658,5,6301707745,I enjoyed this version of the Monestario plot - there were some scenes that were not in the original show. I wished that Disney and ABC never pulled the show off the air - the third season would have been the best and maybe we would have never lost Guy Williams to Argentina.

2794676,5,6301707745,When you mention Zorro there is only one actor that comes to mind and that is Guy Williams. The most realistic Zorro to ever come down the pike. Mr. Disney knew exactly what he was doing when he placed Guy Williams in that role.,1416528000,,228,4.204545454545454
2794677,4,6301707745,"Ever since I was a kid the Walt Disney's ZORRO was my childhood hero, the character, and the actor.and the art of fencing how he GUY WILLIAMS would do it. Over all it's good to watch.",1409702400,,183,4.111111111111111

2794679,4,6301707745,Just typical Disney series type rather than truly adventurous. Nothing like Douglas Fairbanks stunts nor the CG action of the Banderas versions. Nostalgic to when I was a kid but not much more.,1403222400,,193,4.878787878787879
2794680,5,6301707745,"Funny how current Zorro is.  A government dictator running wild and most people to scared to say or do anything.  All it takes for evil to rule is for good men to do nothing.  Zorro is something every young man should watch, just like the Lone Ranger.  Guy Williams supported by an excellent cast bring fun and entertaining version where men have manners and treat all mankind as equals.",1399939200,2,387,4.565217391304348
2794681,4,6301707745,"I grew up on Guy Williams as Zorro. I actually have the DVDs of the original Disney Zorro series. But there is a scene in this movie, which is why I bought it, that is not on the DVDs. When Diego decides to become the Fox, he puts the mask to his face, and looks in the mirror. That is not in the original series, but I felt it was a nice touch.",1392854400,5,345,3.73972602739726
2794682,5,6301707745,"I remember watching these as a boy and now am enjoying reliving those times.  I even had my own Zorro sword with chalk on the end so I could make the sign of the ""Z"".",1392422400,,166,3.742857142857143
2794683,5,6301707745,Great black and white movie.  A nostalgic movie of Zorro by Disney.  I enjoy it every time I watch it.  I actually use it as an audio as I drive through western USA.,1390348800,,165,3.9393939393939394
2794684,5,6301707745,"This movie, for zorro fans is exceptional.  Those old enough to remember Walt Disneys weekly black and white tv series starring guy williams are in for a real treat.  It always has ""good conquering evil, but does so in a much cleaner way than many movies today..",1389398400,9,262,4.553191489361702
2794685,5,6301707745,"If you like basic Disney movies, this is a classic retelling of the story of Zorro.  Not quite as good as the version starring Tyrone Powers, but still a very good family movie.

It reminded me of family nights when we all sat down and watched the Wonderful World of Disney.",1389052800,,274,4.352941176470588
2794686,5,6301707745,"I saw this when I was younger and loved it so much. I watched it so often that I wore out the VHS tape that I had it recorded from TV on. I'm really sad to see this gem of a movie only available on Instant Video but I am very glad it is because it is one of my absolute favorites. Guy Williams as Zorro is incredible. The action is fabulous and well choreographed. The story is true to the time period. It's a wonderful family movie for all ages! (Well maybe not teeny tots because of the fight scenes but there is no gore, this is Disney we're talking here!) The Instant Video version is bright and clear. I don't think the film has been remastered and there may still be a few flaws but overall a nice picture with no annoying technical disturbances. The sound track to this film is also very well done and sounds clear as a bell to this day. Can't say enough about this film! Watch it and you'll love it too!",1386979200,6,911,4.094972067039106
2794687,5,6301707745,This pilot episode brought back a lot of memories for me. Guy Williams was great in this show. Buying the whole seasons episodes was more money that I wanted to spend. But this pilot episode was very affordable. Sargent Garcia was a great character on this show.,1380844800,,262,4.595744680851064
2794688,5,6301707745,"""Sign of Zorro"" is a fun and quickly moving version of the Zorro legend that nicely blends action and comic relief into a very enjoyable movie.

No plot spoilers from me; the story follows the son of a wealthy California landowner that is mysteriously summoned home form his studies in Spain. He finds the political and military climate much changed for the worse over the three years since he left and he vows to fight the injustices he sees by becoming a vigilante, ""Zorro"" (The Fox).

The acting is a little over the top, but generally fun all the way around.

Highly Recommended!

2794689,3,6301707745,"If you own or have recently seen the early episodes of the TV show, there is nothing new here.  This ""movie"" is nothing more than the TV episodes strung together.  Now, having said that, I found the patchwork to be much smoother than some reviewers I had read.  The performances of Guy Williams, Gene Sheldon, and Henry Calvin are superb, and lived up to my memories of them.  The bottom line is that if you loved the Zorro TV series, you will love this, but do not expect anything more.",1358726400,3,487,4.377777777777778

2794693,5,6301707745,"The Sign of Zorro is one of my favorite films. I have watched it so many times I almost know it by heart. Don Diego De la Vega comes home from Spain to see military force had taken over california. Diego with his faithful servant Bernardo and his trustworthy horse tornado becomes zorro the fox. Who rides to save the people from harm in the dark of the night, while pretending to be interested only in books and music during the day. But when his father gets in trouble and covers not in sight zorro must risk his life to save his father.
 Nobody played zorro like Guy Williams. This flim is worth much more than you will ever pay for it. You will never regret buying it.",1087171200,20,672,4.25

8184792,5,6301707745,"Antonio Banderas and Catherine Zeta-Jones in the Mask of Zorro remains my favorite Zorro Film, but it simply would never have been on my radar had it not been for Disney's Zorro Television Series during the mid-twentieth century and Guy William's portrayal.  It was pure luck finding it on Amazon Prime Video and complete joy to watch this film.  I have often wanted to purchase the television series to recapture some of the fading memories of my youth.  The motion picture does a very good job of encapsulating key elements, if only it were possible to play-out the episodic cliff-hangers...",1492819200,,593,4.91
8184793,4,6301707745,"This is the movie and not the tv series. Same characters as the old series. It was good over all. Though,My 9 yr old son did dislike all the dancing scenes. (Just a heads up that that's in there in case you want to skip) :)",1486684800,,223,3.869565217391304
