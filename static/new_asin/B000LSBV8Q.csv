8164051,3,B000LSBV8Q,"OK, even though Mr. McCann is a great presenter and instructor, I was expecting more of this DVD for the price. He gave much explanation of different things and just concentrated on the pepper spray for a short time. Bottom line, I was expecting more that just pepper spray.",1428624000,,274,4.612244897959184
8164052,5,B000LSBV8Q,"I have been an avid fan of all of the books and DVDs put out by Kelly McCann.  His approach is always reality-based and you will not see any fancy and impractical techniques in his combatives programs.  This DVD (Minimum Damage Maximum effect) focuses on the use of various self-defense weapons on the market today.  One of the things he shows is the use of pepper spray.

 As a former Law Enforcement instructor of OC Spray, I question its value in a real life and death combat situation.  There have been many myths and out-right lies concerning the effectiveness of OC pepper spray.  I always explain to people, as Kelly McCann does, about being aware that pepper spray should not be considered the ideal weapon to use in all self-defense situations.  It also can have different effects on different people.  I have been sprayed numerous times and I never felt that I could not still fight.  Nevertheless, it can be an effective self-defense tool when combined with combatives and the use of other weapons.

This DVD also covers other weapons such as short sticks,knives and other tools.  McCann explains the basic use of these weapons in various street combat situations, but he also tells the limitations of using these weapons.  As I have mentioned previously, Kelly McCann specializes not in formal martial arts, but in realistic and practical street combat techniques and tactics.

In conclusion, if you are seeking simple and effective information on the use of weapons for self-defense, this DVD is for you.

8164053,4,B000LSBV8Q,"This is a good, basic tutorial for the civilian.  McCann's operational experience helps to provide a variety of options and techniques for people who want to do more than just stick a can of OC in their purse, pocket, or glove box. Well recommended.",1338076800,,249,4.659090909090909
8164054,5,B000LSBV8Q,"A Complete Guide to the use of Pepper Spray, Less-Lethal, and Improvised Weapons.

Realistic self-defense means being prepared for any situation, from a belligerent drunk to a ruthless serial killer. To do this, you need the right tools for the job - and the knowledge to use them effectively. In this unique video, renowned personal security expert KELLY McCANN presents a complete course in the use of less-lethal weapons - devices that can effectively incapacitate an attacker without having to resort to lethal force. McCANN begins by discussing common hand-held self-defense devices and teaches you how to determine the difference between a useless gimmick and true life-saving tool.

He reveals the secrets of improvised weaponry and shows you how to turn such common items as credit cards and ballpoint pens into powerful defensive weapons. Finally, he gives you a no-nonsense course in the realistic defensive use of pepper spray, including proper selection, carry, and deployment: street-proven tactical applications; and immediate backup plans for times when the spray alone isn't enough. This is one of the most eye-opening self-defense videos ever produced and a must for everyone concerned with practical self-defense.",1251763200,,1231,5.473684210526316
8164055,4,B000LSBV8Q,"This program offers some basic information on the use of non lethal devices and different types of pepper spray.  While this does not go into too much depth it does show several techniques to maximize the dispersion or pepper spray type aerosols, as well as methods of escape after release.  It also points out some of the psychological aspects of an attack that were interesting. The one thing that would have been good to show are the use of the techniques in a complete simulation of an attack from the stalking phase all the way to the escape.",1230681600,2,547,4.571428571428571
