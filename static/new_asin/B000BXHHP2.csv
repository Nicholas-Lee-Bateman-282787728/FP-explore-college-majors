2445257,5,B000BXHHP2,"We loved this video.  We have 1 and 3 year old kids and they both love wathcing this video.  The nature scenes, colors, shapes and music are captivating and relaxing.  The best part is the animation on Jack, The Cuddly Dog.  He is great.

Thanks to the creators of this terrific video.",1134172800,3,285,4.403846153846154
2445258,5,B000BXHHP2,"My 10 month old twins just love Jack, especially my son!  When I first played the DVD, he laughed out loud every time Jack came on the screen.  They love the shots of the animals, especially the dogs and horses.  Beautiful scenery, it flows nicely and the music is very soothing.  Great addition to our family library and we can't wait for the next Jack DVD!",1134086400,3,358,4.378787878787879
2445259,5,B000BXHHP2,"As a mother of 3 (under 3), I am very fond of ""Jack"".  This video captures my kids attention - it makes them giggle while learning.  It is a very serene video that parents will be pleased with.  The solo piano music is soothing, Jack is a cute, playful and identifiable character, and the real-life scenery is refreshing.",1133740800,2,321,4.5
2445260,5,B000BXHHP2,"Our daughter loved Jack when she was very young (9 months or so), and now, at 19 months, he's still among her top video choices. She digs out the DVD case, hands it to me and says, ""Jack dog! Jack dog!"" Her favorite is the dog section, in which she spends the entire time ""woofing"" at the TV. She also likes the farm animals section. And just recently, the flowers have captured her attention, just as they have outdoors. I think what's most interesting about this video is that it is very reflective of her world - with real dogs, flowers, animals (even if we only see them at the petting zoo), etc. It keeps her attention as she ages because she is making the connection between the outside world and what she sees on TV.",1132012800,,723,4.323529411764706
2445261,5,B000BXHHP2,"After sampling the standard fare for our little one, we are thrilled to have come across Jack.  It offers a great balance of education and emotionally-centered entertainment.  Our youngest (just turned 2) continues to enjoy it, and (against all odds) it manages to hold the attention of our 6 and 8 year olds too.  Also, the music is truly special.  We subject our youngest to many (questionable) styles of music, and when I sought a classical station on the radio to calm her down from a tantrum she said ""that's Jack music!""",1131926400,4,526,4.684782608695652
8093833,5,B000BXHHP2,"I recently purchased this for a friend's 2-year old son, who absolutely adores Jack. Every time I visit, he asks me to watch Jack with him. The video does a great job of combining real scenery, classical music, and, of course, Jack--a character kids are drawn to and love. I have since purchased this DVD for several of my nieces and nephews, who also love Jack. If you are in need of a gift idea, this is an excellent option!",1224201600,,426,4.3375
8093834,5,B000BXHHP2,"My son, now 2.5 years old, still loves to watch Jack.  I play it for him everyday when we eat lunch together before his nap.  This has been going on since he was about 8 months old (around the same time we tried Baby Einstein, which he completely rejected!).  The music is calming and pleasant to listen to if the movie happens to be on over and over (we've all been there!).  The scenery is beautiful.  Jimmy loves all the different dogs. ""Dog"" was one of his first words and I am pretty sure it was because of Jack!  Our copy is scratched from over usage and sticky fingers.  We hope a new Jack movie will come out soon.",1218758400,,622,4.176470588235294
8093835,5,B000BXHHP2,"We have a copy of Jack, the Cuddly Dog at our home so that when little ones come for a visit they can enjoy this engaging animated video.  Children have sat in front of the screen fascinated with this cute little dog's adventures. It's a wonderful mixture of animation with live animals and nature. I highly recommend this video for families with youngsters.",1218758400,,358,4.682539682539683
8093836,5,B000BXHHP2,"The beauty of this video is its use of live footage and classical music. I also really enjoy the child's voice as the narration - not too babyish and not too boring adult talk. There are great shots of a variety of REAL dogs and other animals. I can't tell you how many times our son belly-laughed and asked us to rewind the part where one of the dogs runs in circles chasing his tail. Out of the numerous videos we checked out from the library or borrowed from friends, Jack is the ONLY one that our son wanted to watch again and again. He particularly enjoyed it from age 16 months to about 2 years old. As other reviewers mentioned, however, he would still enjoy it now at 28 months. We can't wait for the next Jack to come out on DVD!",1217980800,,738,4.1678321678321675
8093837,5,B000BXHHP2,"We have just begun introducing videos to my 15-month old son.  We've let him view several age-appropriate videos, but most elicited yawns and disregard.  He watched the much-vaunted Baby Einstein for, oh, two minutes and lost interest. (They might be good for infants, but toddlers? Fuggedaboudit!)

Then we bought Jack, the Cuddly Dog. Wow! It is incredible how enthusiastic my boy has been about Jack from first viewing.  And he doesn't view this video passively -- he GETS INTO IT! My son talks with Jack, dances along with the music, points at all the images of natural beauty and talks about them.  It is so cute to see, and I love how much my son wants to interact with Jack. Whenever we turn on the TV now, my son walks over, points at the screen, and says Jack? Jack?

This one is a real treasure.  We want Jack II!!",1155254400,,824,4.489932885906041
8093838,5,B000BXHHP2,"We bought this video and sent it to a six-month-old.  His mother wrote that he never fusses when it is playing.

But first my wife previewed it by watching it with our grandchildren ages 7 and 10.  (She doesn't like sending something she has not seen or read herself.)  The kids were probably expecting a regular video with a plot.  But she reports that they watched with interest and did not get squirmy until the orange triangle.  Those of you who have seen the video may know how far into the video that this part is.

Just wanted to let parents know that this will work for kids over 2, surely up to age 4.",1142640000,,610,4.252173913043478
8093839,5,B000BXHHP2,"My twin toddlers, age 3, love this DVD---the colors and shapes keep their interest, as well as the colors and shapes and the music!!!!

They love to pretend that they are Jack---when the DVD is over, they want to play it again and again and againg---

8093840,5,B000BXHHP2,"My three-year-old son and his one-year-old friend both really like this dvd. My son likes the music, and the way Jack appears and reappears during the film. (""There's Jack!"" he'll say.) The one-year-old seems really taken with  the music, the babies, and all the shapes and colors.

As the grownup, I should add that this dvd is something I don't mind hearing over and over. The music is nice, and the video is beautifully done. The overall effect is soothing and uplifting.",1138320000,,474,4.7682926829268295
8093841,5,B000BXHHP2,"My little guy loves this DVD. We are very strict in limiting his TV time, almost to none, but this one is very healthy and positive in our view with its emphasis on music, nature, and just simple yet beautiful animation.

Most of all, our little guy loves it--he gets distracted very easily as most toddlers do, but this one just keeps him rapt. And he asks for it now too: he recently pointed in the direction of our TV room and said ""puppy""....thanks for giving him a positive memory!",1135641600,,486,4.4
8093842,5,B000BXHHP2,"Our 20 month old daughter just loves this video. She is in suspense when Jack leaves the screen, ""where's da dog?!?"", and giggles in delight when he reappears. It is very watchable for adults too. The music is enjoyable and Jack is the only animated character shown in nice, interesting scenery. All in all, a very good video.",1134604800,,326,4.637931034482759
