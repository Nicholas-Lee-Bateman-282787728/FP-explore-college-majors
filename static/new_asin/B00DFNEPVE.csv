8592822,5,B00DFNEPVE,I am happy that I was finally able to find Baywatch on DVD.  It has the original theme song on it.  This Region 0 DVD plays fine in my DVD player.  The only thing that I do not like is that it did not have an insert telling you which episodes are on which DVD.,1490745600,,260,3.690909090909091
