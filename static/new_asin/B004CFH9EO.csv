4326928,3,B004CFH9EO,"I am not an Asylum shill.  I do want to be entertained by the movies that I watch.  Some Asylum movies can do that, and some can't. ""Titanic 2"" entertains me.

""Titanic 2"" - OK, what do you expect from a movie entitled ""Titanic 2""?  An Oscar-winning movie?  If so, then you really need to watch less TV and movies and read more books and news magazines.  Big ship, separated couple, tidal wave, big ship sinking, couple united, and then the last few minutes of the movie.  Done and done.

Acting: Some of the pretty faces can't.  The big names can.  Bruce Davison is the best actor of the bunch.

Writing: Davison's character is believable as the senior government official and the concerned parent, though he is too calm and rational when he should be panicking.  Van Dyke's character is an unwaveringly confident person; this is unrealistic and rather boring.  Brooke Burns' character is a wildly inconsistent character who reacts to situations.  Burns' character is happy, strong, intelligent, or lovestruck; whether this is a realistic character or not is a matter of opinion.

Effects:  Good special effects.  Snow fields, tidal waves, ships, explosions . . .

Final Review:  Three stars because it was fun.  Better movies exist, but none are named ""Titanic 2"".",1284768000,22,1266,4.854460093896714
4326929,1,B004CFH9EO,"I knew what I was in for when I picked this up at the video store, but being a Titanic buff I just had to see it anyways. It is as bad as you would imagine with grade z special effects, bad acting and terrible writing. Shane Van Dyke did seem to acquire alot of hot looking no talented women to appear in the film. The rest of the passengers and crew seem to be assembled from Shane's drinking buddies and people he pulled in off the street. You never once believe that any of the 20 or so passengers that are shown could actually afford a ticket on a luxury liner. While there are a couple of longshots of the ""Titanic II"" that look ok, you never feel like you are on-board a replica of the Titanic. It could be any old passenger ship. The Titanics appeal was the luxury and majesty of the ship and that is never even hinted at here. There are long segments during the films ""climax"" that are so dark you honestly cannot see or understand what is happening. I would not recommend this film even for laughs. That being said, I think the plot actually had some undeveloped potential. It was an interesting idea that remained undeveloped and filmed that way. It is too bad that Van Dyke did not go and find some writers with true talent who could have made something out of this.",1284595200,21,1277,4.2592592592592595
4326930,1,B004CFH9EO,"When a director{van dyke} is in his own movie  BEWARE! Its cheap  the acting is juvenile and laughable. Its painfull but at times entertaining,BUT not long enough. Sad because it could of been a camp classic  like Plan 9 from outerspace  or glen or glenda instead its just a painfull experience.

4326931,4,B004CFH9EO,"Is bigger better? The people behind TITANIC 2 are hoping fans will think so. Arguably the most eagerly-anticipated sequel in cinematic history -- James Cameron's original was the first movie to make over a billion dollars world-wide, remember -- TITANIC 2 arrives on dvd (sorry kids, no sign of a blu-ray yet) in a visually opulent widescreen presentation that's sure to please fans and historians alike. While no one could have expected this belated follow-up to surpass Cameron's Academy Award-winning classic, TITANIC 2 nonetheless has a charm all it's own; the film is lightning-paced (you won't need to set three hours aside to watch this puppy!), and while Brooke (BAYWATCH) Burns is no Kate Winslet, her performance is riveting and real. Also, special effects have come a long way since TITANIC smashed the box-office record book over a decade ago, allowing director Shane Van Dyke to do things Cameron could only dream about in 1997.

So, is bigger better? According to the producers of TITANIC 2, the answer is a resounding yes, and while no one's going to forget Kate and Leo, TITANIC 2's greatest strength is that, unlike most sequels, you don't have to have seen the original to know what's going on.",1282867200,3,1212,4.9411764705882355

Marie Westbrook steals every scene she is in,and deserved she is in almost all.
Bruce Davison in awesome father role and has some nice scenes,Wish Brooke Burns could have supported him more in those.
The effects are really good and makes film look bigger,Could we get more people in peril please .
The `Queen Mary' attraction in San Diego,Ca. is used mostly as stand-in for TITANIC 2 ship scenes and some CGI when in deep water.

4327053,5,B004CFH9EO,"Ok, first thing people should know: THIS NOT A SEQUEL TO THE JAMES CAMERON FILM, but is rather a stand alone. I mean, what's Titanic about anyways? Titanic. What's Poseidon about? Poseidon. So is Titanic II about Titanic II? Yes. And despite being a ""stand alone"", rather than a sequel to the super succesful Titanic, it could be considered a fictional sequel to true events. I mean, don't get me wrong, I know there's films with better sound effects and visual effects. As a matter of fact, I've never heard worse sound effects. But it's a TV movie and Asylum movie, people. Even Tremors: The Series, which kept part of the cast members from Tremors 3, was in the same line with the crappy effects, but I KNOW Tremors fans like the show. Anyways, The Asylum did disappoint me with The Terminators, but ignoring everything that people criticize about Titanic II, I did enjoy it.

On the 100th anniversary of the original Titanic's departure, Titanic II sets sail from England to the United States, following the same route as the original ship. Everything is fine accept a massive tsunami from Greenland (yeah, that's right, Greenland) pushes a giant piece of a glacier right into Titanic II around the same location that the original Titanic sank. Chaos ensues and the ship capsizes, splits in two, and eventually sinks. There's also a romantic subplot between the two protagonists, Hayden (Shane Van Dyke) and Amy (Mary West).

Besides the title, the first thing anyone should know about TITANIC II is that the movie is made by The Asylum. For those who don't know, The Asylum is the daddy of mockbusters (aka copy cat tie-ins). Each year they produce a handful of movies that are cheap imitators of big budget movies that are release around the same time. The movies don't get a film release and go straight to DVD and cable. Oh, and they always make money. Of course, if you've seen an Asylum picture, it's not difficult to see why. The sets are unrealistic, the writing is substandard, and the acting is usually really bad.

TITANTIC II is not an exception. The engine room of the ship Titanic II has concrete walls. The dialogue is so funny that you will either laugh or cry because having no reaction is not an option. As for the acting, there are a few moments here and there were some real acting occurs, but for the most part, the actors seem to have just showed up to pick up a paycheck.

With that said, there are a few positives about the movie. The language is fairly tame and there's no nudity or sex. Also, the character of Hayden is portrayed by Shane Van Dyke, Dick Van Dyke's grandson. Unfortunately, he doesn't seem very interested in his role here and actually did a better job at acting when he played on DIAGNOSIS MURDER.

As a complete side note, the only other thing I can say about TITANIC II is that basic scenario of the film (a new version of the Titanic being built and following the same route as the original ship) is something that I thought was ridiculous. However, it's something that will actually become a reality in two years with the announcement of Australian billionaire Clive Palmer to do exactly that in 2014.

Overall, TITANIC II isn't a very good movie. However, there are just enough campy moments to make it actually funny here or there. If you want to watch a really bad Asylum picture rent SUNDAY SCHOOL MUSICAL or 2012 DOOMSDAY.",1337126400,,2603,4.637744034707159
4327090,3,B004CFH9EO,"It does say Asylum and the name is Titanic II. Expectations should remain at a minimal. Asylum, having stock iceberg footage left over from their smash bargain box hit ""Ice Age 2012"" opted to create another film around icebergs...but what?

The movie runs as two subplots. A group of people are examining a glacier spelling out gloom and doom without mentioning ""global warming."" However they expect a huge iceberg the size of Rhode Island to break off and cause a tsunami, which is not a problem for ships...unless the tsunami carries an iceberg with it! Captain James Maine (Bruce Davison) is on the glacier getting a run down by the scientist with an excellent ice age back drop. Perhaps the biggest change I have seen in an Asylum production is that this Navy Captain was actually wearing the correct lapel pin for his rank, and it remained the same throughout the film! I must say ""bravo"" to Asylum, but alas, I have lost a source of entertainment watching the insignia rank change from scene to scene.

Meanwhile James' daughter Amy (Marie Westbrook, the Denise Richards of really ""B"" movies) is on the maiden voyage of the Titanic II. Her ex-boyfriend (Shane Van Dyke) is there with an entourage of four lovey ladies. As the subplots collide we are treated to another ""Poseidon Adventure.""

As an Asylum film goes, this was a cut above. The acting had some acceptable moments. The science was not horrifically bad. The dialouge and plot left much to be desired. I will give this 1 star movie 3 stars for showing improvement. All Asylum needs now is a script writer. A well written script can cover a multitude of sins.

Titanic=great, Poseidon Adventure=okay, Destination Infestation=terrible.  A cross between the three?  EPIC FAILURE!!!  Titanic 2 was totally a piss-poor attempt to recreate Titanic.  You have a lookalike ship with almost the exact same name that hits an iceberg in almost the exact same place (the coordinates heard on the sub were the original Titanic's coordinates of impact), starts going down stern-first, almost splits in half, and sinks.  Of course, it capsizes before it sinks, just like Poseidon.  There aren't enough lifeboats, just like before, and those lifeboats are totally unrealistic (our current lifeboats look nothing like those mini-subs).  The Captain is killed on the bridge, just like Captain Smith.  Naturally, our two main characters get themselves into tight spots trying to escape like a modern-day Jack & Rose.  Of course, our modern-day Jack dies, with our modern-day Rose saying ""Come back,"" just like she did in the original movie.

I would say that the filming and animation here was total crap, except that doesn't even begin to describe it.  Horrible CG, lots of identical scenes of people running everywhere, with the ship in the exact same position that James Cameron's version of it was in.  And the dialogue?  Never seen or heard anything tackier--except maybe the nurse's uniforms.  Figure-flattering blouses and pencil skirts?  Come on!

This movie was a complete rip-off of James Cameron's 1997 Titanic.  It was just an attempt to recreate it and I did not do it justice here, describing how much it failed.  Worse still, it was an utter mockery and one of the worst insults possible to the passengers and crew aboard the actual Titanic.  James Cameron's 1997 movie, while exaggerated and focusing on a love story, at least told a true story of the terrible catastrophe that occurred on April 14th and 15th, 1912.  In a way, it honored them by shedding light on their story.  This didn't do that.

4327096,1,B004CFH9EO,"Having studied the ill-fated Titanic since I was a pre-teen and seeing every film and documentary of the ""ship of dreams"",  I wanted to like this movie but going into this film I knew what to expect from Shane Van Dyke. If the story, acting and special effects weren't bad enough, Van Dyke just seemed to go into this film without a care in the world. Cameron's ""Titanic"" was a bad enough film to begin with (and although ""Titanic II"" is in no way related to that film) and a different league of it's own, the worst and most obvious part of this movie is the fact that Van Dyke paid no attention to hide the fact that this film was shot aboard the Queen Mary in Long Beach, CA. Several long shots of the exterior of the ship are obvious that this three-stack, yes three-stack not four, ocean liner is, in fact, the Queen Mary. The funniest part of this movie was when the ship left port to set sail on the high seas. The rock wall that houses the Queen Mary around her resting place in Long Beach is clearly visible. I guess the ""Titanic II"" ship was suppose to break through the rock wall and set sail on the open seas!! The other obvious factions of the movie is the sign ""Queen Mary Hotel"" {or something to that fact) is visible (where real tourists visiting the ship board when checking in to get to their rooms) as the ""Titanic"" passengers come aboard ship and the city of Long Beach is clearly visible in several scenes. I realize that Van Dyke was obviously not given much money to film this 'film'?? but cameras could have been positioned to not show these intentional errors as they were in the original ""The Poseidon Adventure"" back in 1971. Van Dyke really needs to learn a lot more about film-making, and acting for that matter, if he intends on making this his career.",1333411200,,1781,4.380664652567976

4327098,1,B004CFH9EO,"I'll try to keep this review as brief and concise as possible.  I wasn't expecting much from this, after all made-for-TV movies don't usually get my hopes up in the first place.  Often times the scripts and plots are less than realistic, the acting leaves a lot to be desired, and it's one of those things you turn to watch when you've got nothing better to do.

Enter Titanic II...

From the opening scenes of the surf-boarder taking advantage of(falling?)ice from a glacier in the Antarctic, I knew I was in for a real treat.  Basically, the premise of the movie is that a new vessel, Titanic II, is making her maiden voyage exactly 100 years after the first tragedy.  Along the way, a massive tsunami PUSHES an iceberg into her path and of course all hell breaks loose.  I kid you not when I say that this might have been the most utterly pathetic boring movie I've ever had the misfortune of watching.  The ""special effects"" looked like they were done by a high school drama department. They relied so much on computer imaging and enhancements that the ship ended up looking like a cartoon at times. The acting(haha)was so bad that it was funny--there were scenes that were meant to be tragic and dramatic where I literally found myself howling with laughter(case point: the scene where one of the extras walks up to Shane Van Dyke and yells ""It's all your fault!"") I DARE anyone not to laugh...

This movie is full of shenanigans and tomfoolery from beginning to end. It's basically a bunch of people running around a doomed ""vessel"" having absolutely no point or purpose. Even Bruce Davison's normally passable acting is painful to watch here. The characters spend most of the movie running around like chickens with their heads cut off. I can't say I blame them. Had I been acting in this, I would've wanted to jump ship too(pun intended).  Virtually everything is wrong here. Nothing ""feels"" or looks real.  From the dining-room scenes which look like they were shot in a high school gymnasium, to the ""engine room"" with its CONCRETE walls--it just doesn't work folks.

Like I said, after the saga was finished, I couldn't believe what I just witnessed.  Not only is it(IMO)an insult to a great liner, it's an insult to the memory of all who perished on her.  It certainly begs the question of why this movie was allowed into production in the first place? Like other reviewers have said, the acting is horrid, the storyline is  completely ridiculous and nonsensical, and after all is said and done, everyone looks like they are standing around just waiting for their paycheck from this thing. Due to those factors, this perhaps ends up being one of the funniest(in a bad way)movies ever made. I laughed so hard several times I nearly soaked my pants. Trust me folks, don't waste your time. Even if your curiosity peaks, pass this one up.  How they even got away with this garbage mystifies me.",1329091200,,2902,4.671905697445973

I love the part where they tape a credit card to a bleeding blonde bimbo's chest to keep her from dying during the sinking.

4327100,4,B004CFH9EO,"Is bigger better? The people behind TITANIC 2 are hoping fans will think so. Arguably the most eagerly-anticipated sequel in cinematic history -- James Cameron's original was the first movie to make over a billion dollars world-wide, remember -- TITANIC 2 arrives on dvd (sorry kids, no sign of a blu-ray yet) in a visually opulent widescreen presentation that's sure to please fans and historians alike. While no one could have expected this belated follow-up to surpass Cameron's Academy Award-winning classic, TITANIC 2 nonetheless has a charm all it's own; the film is lightning-paced (you won't need to set three hours aside to watch this puppy!), and while Brooke (BAYWATCH) Burns is no Kate Winslet, her performance is riveting and real. Also, special effects have come a long way since TITANIC smashed the box-office record book over a decade ago, allowing director Shane Van Dyke to do things Cameron could only dream about in 1997.

So, is bigger better? According to the producers of TITANIC 2, the answer is a resounding yes, and while no one's going to forget Kate and Leo, TITANIC 2's greatest strength is that, unlike most sequels, you don't have to have seen the original to know what's going on.",1326412800,,1212,4.9411764705882355

4327102,1,B004CFH9EO,"""Titanic II"" is just as ridiculous as you could possibly expect, except with much lower production values. Written by, directed by, and starring Shane Van Dyke as Hayden Walsh, an uber-rich tycoon who has commissioned the ""Titanic II"" to sail on the 100th anniversary of the tragic voyage of the original, the movie entertains every clich possibly related to the genre (shoddy construction, trying to break a speed record, his ex-girlfriend happens to be a doctor on the ship, iceberg perils, etc.) while centering itself on the currently faddish plot of a green global warming calamity. This sailing is supposed to complete the journey started 100 years earlier with a new ultra-modern ship (that looks the same on the outside.) Some very basic research may have assisted the creators of this masterwork: it's difficult to miss that the ship's going the wrong way as it cruises past the Statue of Liberty during its departure from port (of course, the real ""Titanic"" was going from England to New York,) but such trivialities matter little.

It's clearly obvious that the film rented out the ""Queen Mary,"" now a permanent museum ship (and a beautiful and genuinely charming place to visit) to turn into the ""Titanic II"" for a few days. The location shooting at Long Beach is the best part of the movie, as the ""Queen Mary"" is a gorgeous vessel, but you will definitely notice the jarring differences between the actual bridge of the ship at the outset (I can just hear the ""Queen Mary"" staff telling the actors not to touch anything!) and the hilarious bridge set seen later on which looks like an elementary school multipurpose room. The entertainment value of such camp potential is overpowered by the stench of badness here, though. The melodramatic script infuses a terrible script and ridiculous premise with absurdly horrible acting to become tedious very quickly.

The film is also a preachy anti-global warming diatribe which fails on every level, particularly on the level of basic science (it wouldn't even skate past a group of disinterested Geology 101 students who just needed a science class to graduate.) You see, the icecaps in Greenland are cracking off and producing a mega-tsunami of ice that moves supersonically and will destroy everything in its path. Of course the ""Titanic II"" is the latest of technological wonders, but even as it's going 50 knots (!) it has to shut down in mid-Atlantic because the engines can't take it. (Huh?) Hayden Walsh (in an apparent and grossly inaccurate homage to the late J. Bruce Ismay from the original tragedy) knows much more about ""Titanic II"" than either the Captain or Chief Engineer do, which leads to extremely hokey conflict and hilariously bad dialogue (""The lifeboats are deathtraps!"") Walsh knows so much about the ship for instance, that he recommends using the elevators when the ship is sinking and on fire. Good thing he's on board. In the end Walsh tries to make up for everything that went on earlier in his life and has to be the hero, die a cold and wet death, and leave the love of his life as a survivor. Has that ever been done before? In a film? About a sinking ship? The swimming in the passageway scenes also remind me of something else, but I can't quite put my finger on it....

Everything about this film smells. The acting smells like feet, the script of a teenage boy's gym locker, and the hack science like a dead skunk. All things considered the whole production stinks like fetid cheese, and should be avoided at all costs.",1316649600,18,3513,4.822553897180763

So the plot....Millionaire Hayden Walsh gets his inheritance and decides to rebuild the Titanic, to show how far technology has come.  This Ex-girlfriend Amy is also aboard the ship as well. Amy's father works for the coast guard and has been informed of the fact that tsunami's are being caused be glacier's melting in Greenland. These melting glaciers are creating giant waves out at sea that are carrying icebergs within the waves (WOW).

Everything everyone has said about the acting being terrible, the special effects being pretty much on par to what a college student could do in a graphics arts class, and the story being just totally lackluster....The scenes of panic are honestly, more funny than sad, and the emotional conclusion is also very laughable....

I don't think so. There's lots of running through hallways, but the hallways CURVE! Curved hallways- on a ship? NOT! The ballroom is obviously from some hotel. There are lots of closeups of actors, done strictly to camouflage the real settings. And what in the world is up with the captain's hat being so HUGE on his head??? Did they lose the actor it was designed for? His head must have been enormous! No ship's wheelhouse looks like this, either. Then there are the special effects...The CGI work might have been passable if they's bothered to actually putt the name of the ship on her while she's moving. As it is, she has no name in those scenes, even though she does when they've used the Queen Mary as her stand-in. Totally unacceptable.

Marvel-level CGI, a love story more dramatic than the first Titanic, and a compelling plot with more twists and turns than Inception. I spent days after viewing this masterpiece pondering the insight it gave on the secrets of the universe. Please, if you love yourself or are seeking enlightenment, watch this movie. It is the best $6 I have ever spent.",1521158400,,452,4.8076923076923075

8422977,1,B004CFH9EO,". Save your money ,  because this is the worst piece of garbage ever to be produced . For example, when they film the bridge, it looks like it was done in someone's living room with shutters covering the windows and paneling on the walls from back in the 60s, this movie is so bad I did not even bother watching the rest of it because I cannot stand another minute of this piece of garbage .  , even though I paid a little over six dollars for this piece of garbage. I feel it was way too much and even giving this a one star rating is too much. The only thing that looks good is the, artwork on the front cover. . As far as the rest of this movie. , . You can put it in the trash",1511740800,2,680,3.8156028368794326

8422980,1,B004CFH9EO,"An absolute waste of money, packaging and product. This extremely low budget film was a combination of poor CG that, if they spent a dime, would be over budget. It was filmed at the Queen Mary hotel in Long Beach and in a HOTEL of all places. The ""climbing"" scenes were a poor copy of Batman and Robin climbing buildings. And, like all low budget films, the ""starlets"" were over-inflated, having their own life preservers.
