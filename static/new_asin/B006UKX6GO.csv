5020075,4,B006UKX6GO,"Have been a fan of exploitation film from the '70s for many years (my fav being The Women in Prison flicks) and was thinking upon hearing of this release that I have died and gone to drive-in heaven! These four nurse films are classics of exploitation in my book. This two DVD set has two films per disc in anamorphic widescreen for the first time! The only down side to this set (which is why I gave it four stars) is the lack of special features. There are two. That is it! One is an interview with Roger and Julie Corman (the best special feature I have seen in years) and the other is with the two directors of Night Call Nurses and Candy Stripe Nurses (it is cool to see Jonathan Kaplan remember making his flick). With the status of these four classic films where are the trailers!? And I would love to hear Jonathan Kaplan for eighty minutes talking about his bout with exploitation cinema. But NO ONE can look or sound as excited as the great Roger Corman! Man, I could listen to him talk for days about his cheap filmmaking techniques.
I am VERY disappointed that Stephanie Rothman's (one great female director under the Corman belt) The Student Nurses was not included with this set. Preferred to have ALL the nurse films in one set! But that one quibble aside, this still is great to have if you are a fan of sleazy drive-in fare from the '70s. These are great looking transfers that are bright and colorful compared to the terrible DVD releases from the past.
Now the question lies, Where are The Teacher films at? Come on, you got me hungry for more... The Student Teachers and Summer School Teachers I know need the love and care these Nurse films got. One can only cross his fingers and hope that they too (along with Student Nurses) gets a DVD release in the future.
More reason to love Shout and the great work they keep giving us fans!",1335139200,59,1853,4.405247813411079

5020077,1,B006UKX6GO,Candy Strip Nurses was above average but the other 3 they should just give away for free.,1430006400,,89,4.294117647058823
5020078,5,B006UKX6GO,"very enjoyable,because I like the retro movies",1426291200,2,46,5.714285714285714
5020079,3,B006UKX6GO,"Candy Stripe Nurses was a pretty good movie - Night Call Nurses and Private Duty Nurses were not as good.  Have not watched Young Nurses yet, one can only hope that it will be as good as Candy Stripe Nurses.",1423267200,3,207,4.175
5020080,5,B006UKX6GO,Great sexy femme fatals raising blood in the groin & in the heart!!!,1422316800,,68,4.3076923076923075
5020081,2,B006UKX6GO,not good,1416009600,,8,3.5
5020082,3,B006UKX6GO,This collection is backseat drive in movie classics at their greatest heights. Forget the bad acting and over dubbed love scenes. The cars and fashions is worth this trip down memory lane.,1411689600,3,188,4.90625
5020083,3,B006UKX6GO,These are OK. But the story lines and dialog are really bad. They are good for a time killer and that's about it.,1405814400,4,113,3.9565217391304346
5020084,5,B006UKX6GO,Now these are truly drive in movies this is what you saw in the 70zs drive inns and they are good movies every one of them kinda a funny looking back,1402704000,8,149,3.838709677419355
5020085,2,B006UKX6GO,"These films are all about nurses who seduce their patients and have sex with them, but you don't see the real sex!  Roger Corman has edited out all the real sex and is trying to make money and not deliver the goods.  The films have been edited out and you can tell.  Very bad for the producers for when these films first came out, they included all the sex and it was acceptable then and now we are being short changed.  You better off finding people who have the original films on vhs and making copies from them.  The quality may not be so great but at least you will view the films in its entirety.",1378425600,5,601,4.146551724137931
5020086,5,B006UKX6GO,It was great.,1377129600,,13,3.6666666666666665
5020087,4,B006UKX6GO,If you like Roger Corman movies this will be up your alley. The plots on all 4 movies are good. Not great but good. The girls are SEXY as expected of a Roger Corman movie. The movie quality as expected is Drive-in move style. I like the movies and I think they are a good buy.,1375228800,7,276,3.9464285714285716
5020088,1,B006UKX6GO,These movies tried to touch on the erotic and sentual but were only a cheep spin off of the ture original Candy Stripe movies of the late 70's and early 80's. Was not at all what I expected and would love to return it for credit towards another movie I would watch. No would not recommend this to anyone!,1372809600,,304,4.169491525423729
5020089,4,B006UKX6GO,This came on time and in very good condition. What the movies were about I really don't remember but it was at a great price so it's okay.,1364860800,,138,3.9642857142857144
5020090,3,B006UKX6GO,A collection of Roger Cormans early work.  They are still funny and sexy and a look into history at the same time.  The sets and props are amazing to see from a period gone by.  Of course the acting and scripts are typical low budget Corman yet they are still fun to watch.,1358294400,11,273,4.113207547169812
5020091,5,B006UKX6GO,Was really young; since I'm now old; since I saw and enjoyed these dumb films. But who knew that 30+ years later they would show up on DVD. Thanks for the memories. Came fast and package right.,1357430400,8,193,4.243243243243243
5020092,3,B006UKX6GO,"I don't know if a nurse movie is a genre in itself, or only something Roger Corman makes. These movies collected here are suppose to be cult classics, but I don't know what all the fuss is about. These movies aren't really that entertaining, but I think there's some formula to a nurse movie. Which sort of make all these movies similar, since they're all nurse movies. I learned nudity was a prerequisite, and that was the main reason I bought these movies, hoping to see young nurses nude. But I think the movies are a keeper.",1350345600,7,528,4.453608247422681
5020093,3,B006UKX6GO,"This film does take some time and thought..It was done in an aera when scary movies were not as intense as the Exocist are today..But its good entainment and at the right price,with great on time delivery.",1348790400,12,205,4.5675675675675675
5020094,1,B006UKX6GO,"Not lighthearted, playful or funny or whacky as expected.
Often on the twisted and abusive side with few revealing sexual scenes, but cute well figured girls -  Plots bland and mostly disconnected with being a nurse.",1348617600,4,216,5.0
5020095,3,B006UKX6GO,"some boxed set. it excludes the first film that started the series, student nurses. quality is WAY better last student teachers/student nurses boxed set though. guess us corman fans have to take what we can get. the price was right at least",1335398400,15,240,4.738095238095238

8504613,1,B006UKX6GO,"I expected something much more sexy and titillating out of Candice Rialson as a nurse.
The whole thing wasn't very interesting.",1501632000,,127,5.095238095238095

8504615,2,B006UKX6GO,The kickstand part of the case does not work as a kickstand in either orientation. Two stars because the case is slim.,1494028800,,118,4.409090909090909
8504616,5,B006UKX6GO,With other things this comes to mind when being in an hospital. The joy terror and emotional backlash of what happens when things don't go the way you want. Letting go and laughing at what they are.,1493251200,,198,4.378378378378378
