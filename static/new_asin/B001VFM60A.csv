3822098,5,B001VFM60A,"Probably the best live LP performance. And it's on Blu-Ray to boot. Has a few more minutes of the concert than the CD contains. The second singer (cant remember his name) goes on a political rant, but at least they segmented that part so a quick press of the button will forward you to the next song and spare you from this band's political viewpoints. Some people think they are famous, therefore important politically. Kudos to the producers for allowing us to skip that part and move on to the music.",1357084800,2,503,4.538461538461538
