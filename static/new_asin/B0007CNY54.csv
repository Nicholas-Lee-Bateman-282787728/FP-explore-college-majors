2208630,5,B0007CNY54,"Thank you to Universal for bringing back a classic television program that features REAL teen idols: Shaun Cassidy, Parker Stevenson, and Pamela Sue Martin.  I must also applaud the supporting cast of William Schallert as Carson Drew and Edmund Gilbert as Fenton Hardy.

Universal, please do not keep us waiting for seasons two and three!  The season two premiere found Nancy and the Brothers Hardy working together for the very first time - a concept which has since found its way into many novels.  For fans of the Hardy Boys/Nancy Drew Casefiles (novels written in the late 1980s), I encourage you to check out these DVDs! The Casefiles would've inspired some wonderful scripts for this series. It's unfortunate they didn't come along a decade  earlier. Overall, the Hardy Boys/Nancy Drew Mysteries is a very cool tv series that deserves to be seen in its entirety once again. Let's show a new generation a Frank, Joe, and Nancy who value respect, trust, independence, perseverance, confidence and so much more!  After all, REAL idols are so difficult to find these days.",1109116800,95,1074,4.972067039106145
2208631,5,B0007CNY54,"This isn't so much a review as a wish. Much as I loved the first season with the alternating shows, much as I adored Pamela Sue Martin's inimitable essaying of the role of Nancy Drew - this is more a wish that the season two boxed set isn't far behind. Season two features the team-up episode when they meet Dracula with Nancy's hysterical eye-rolling comment, ""the amateur hour"". And that rare Christmas episode which somehow never ended up on syndication or on the VHS edition.",1109116800,18,479,4.647058823529412
2208632,5,B0007CNY54,"Finally! Quite nearly three decades after this show appeared, it's BACK!  This series starred Shaun Cassidy, Pamela Sue Martin/Janet Louise Johnson, and Parker Stevenson, and was shown on ABC from January 1977 to to January 1979. The Hardys alternated with Nancy Drew once a week in the first season. By 1978 the Nancy Drew series was failing. In a last ditch attempt to save the series, ABC combined the Hardys and Nancy for a few episodes. This didn't work and Ms. Drew was canceled in the fall of '78. The Hardys followed this fate early in 1979. Thus season two is the only FULL season out there.

If you enjoy Hart to Hart, Magnum PI, or even Murder She Wrote, this classic DVD set is for you -- and they'll even throw in a poster of Shaun!

2208633,5,B0007CNY54,"As a true Nancy Drew fan, it is certain to say that only Pamela Sue Martin could ever really bring Nancy to life; She brought true moxie to the role. That, and a nice touch of sarcasm for those who were too afraid to enter the haunted lighthouse (George)or just too oblivious to notice that a mystery needed to be solved (Ned).  Although there is no Bess or housekeeper Hannah, as in the books, the characters are great.  William Shallert makes a seamless transition into attorney Carson Drew, Nancy's supportive father.  ANY Nancy Drew fan will appreciate Martin's performance, she was beautiful, smart, quick-witted and just very ""Nancy"".  These are a must have for any fan.  Plus, there are some great guest star appearances before they had acting lessons (Jamie Lee Curtis). And in regards to the Hardy Boys...it only took one Nancy to do what it took two Hardy boys to do.  (Universal-PLEASE don't make us wait long for Seasons Two and Three).",1108771200,24,948,4.75
2208634,5,B0007CNY54,"For those of us who are nostalgic fans of this 1977-1978 ABC Sunday night show, the word that this first season would be released on DVD is pure magic.  This is the great first season, when Parker Stevenson/Shaun Cassidy alternated with the beautiful Pamela Sue Martin in a series of weekly detective adventures.  This is the season with the underrated, divine Lisa Eilbacher as Callie Shaw, the Hardy Boys' best friend and frequent helper.  This is a show one could never have expected would come to DVD.  Until now there were SOME episodes on videos  (not all easy to find), and the usual Ebay bootleg crowd with lousy picture quality.  So, if you were a fan of this great late '70s innocent fun, get ready for March...we've waited a long time for this.",1105747200,126,755,4.639097744360902

2208640,5,B0007CNY54,"This first season was memorable as that of--after 50 years-- Callie Shaw AS THE CO-STAR!

When Frank once said ""Without her we couldn't have solved the mystery"" WAS REFERRING TO HIS FALCON MISS PEREGINE. Callie had sadly acknowledged HER role--or lack of--as the anti-Nancy Drew, Last-in-the-Cast Callie, back in 1929: ""I wish I was a boy. They have all the luck. Boys get to go. Girls  have to just stay home."" She was not even ""his girlfriend"" UNTIL 1971, just ""favorite date"" until then immediately  disappearing from the plot after it. Being  BIG help on cases for her would be  driving the Hardys to the airport, polishing
a ""spooky mask"" the Hardys found, with ""Among all the squiggles might lay the secret.""

Her JACKET was kidnapped, should have been WEARING it, at last counted FOR SOMETHING. AS it happened, he ONLY  Enemy who
ever even  KNEW  of her existence and  connection  to Frank, they actually FACE-TO-FACE him posing as door-to-door salesman,  did NOT
bother to kidnap her just--spit on ground for emphasis-- A GIRL after all and instead  tricked her into blowing-up the gang's barbecue at the fairgrounds, causing a panic and SETTING IOLA MORTON'S HAIR ON FIRE!

There had been two prior filming of the Hardys for TV. In the 1950s Walt Disney did  adaptation of first Hardy novel The Tower Treasure
(1927) titled as  Mystery of the Applegate Treasure and an original follow-up Mystery of Ghost Farm (both can be seen online) and in a stroke
of genius HE USED IOLA, NOT CHET! She was brilliant, truly funny,  as the stand-in for EVERY boy's nightmare--The Annoying Kid Sister of
his orpal's, getting involved, in the way, driving Joe plain crazy but in the end accepting, ""Well, MAYBE she's all right.""  A 1967 TV pilot Mystery of the Chinese unwisely ditched the girls with two minutes at the start, Callie one line, Iola lost as extra in gaggle of girls on the
beach, forgotten in seconds. Chet Moron was  instead shoved center stage full-blown bloated buffoonery on display, proving beyond question  what  a catastrophically  uncomical character he always was, and how so dreary ALL guys, All the time, can be. It rightly went
unsold and the producers a decade had  learned from that MAKING CALLIE THE CO-STAR!

Attractive Lisa Eilbacher, age 21, played  Callie. Unusual background, born in Saudi Arabia, father oil executive, raised in France, was
already veteran, starting at 13. She was not Frank;s ""favorite date"" but Fenton Hardy's part-time assistant working in the Hardy home. What
Callie  lost in innocence she made up for in opportunities, AT LAST, for involvement.

The pilot  episode, Mystery of the Haunted House, though, WAS AN UTTER  DISASTER  for her.

 Callie's  entire role ONE MINUTE AT BEGINNING in evening brusquely walking out with ""none of my business"" Mr. Hardy may have been (WAS!) in danger, ONE MINUTE AT END next morning  finding out she slept through the case about a navy officer with amnesia and stolen
secrets, kissed Frank on cheek, ""my hero,"" looking  A FOOL, truly The-LAST-in-the-Cast, embarrassment emphasized by yet being  BILLED
THIRD even  over Mr. Hardy and Aunt Gertrude! It made one SO fear for Callie's future on the show.  (The last scene besides humiliating Callie was also disgusting  for the sheer  galling, in-the-viewer's-face,  sight of those two other Navy officers,  smug,  rotten, worthless,  good-
for-nothing CREEPS, WHO BEAT UP, BOUND AND GAGGED MR. HARDY  jaw-dropping, unbelievably, incredibly  ARE GUESTS IN THE
HARDY HOME, SERVED HOT DRINKS BY AUNT GERTRUDE!! She obviously does NOT know, IF she did, ANYone could tell you, she'd
heat the creeps' drinks to a flesh-searing  BOIL, throw it in their  rotten, smug,faces, smash the mugs and anything else she could get her
hands on over their worthless,  good-for-nothing  heads, chase them from the house---and RIGHTLY!)

The next episode, Secret of Witches' Hollow  CALLIE EARNED HER BILLING.

 As niece of missing Captain Maguire she WENT with the boys and--unfortunately--Chet MORON, on spooky, stormy, night ride, soon was
 chased through woods by wild animal, trapped in fire. (It was based on Clue of the Screeching Owl in which she did not even appear.
Thankfully  Joe and Captain Maguire NOT tied up as in story. Fortunately film makers saw how unfair, embarrassing, that would be with her around ""Franklin W. Dixon,"" of course, would NOT have cared, been happy to humiliate them.)

However, unfortunately, unhappily,  Moron squeezed her out of climax confrontatiuon, ruined the ending--she had the RIGHT to be in it, save her uncle. The film makers luckily learned from that how there was not enough room, time, for both so, correctly, rightly, it was MORON who
deservedly got the--literally---bum's rush, delayed  justice for Callie after embarrassingly enduring  50 years' being Last-in-the-Cast to such a bloated  buffoon, clod, clown, dimwit, dope, dunce, fool, freak. idiot, imbecile,  jerk, joke, numbskull.

The Disappearing Floor had this MEMORABLE exchange:

Callie: ""Now all the two of you have to do is prove it.""

Frank: ""No,  now all the  THREE of us have to prove it.""

Callie had a BIG smile.

IF ONLY  ""FRANKLIN W. DIXON""  HAD THE BRAINS FOR THAT  IN 1927 WHAT THE SERIES WOULD HAVE BEEN!

 Callie's BEST episode, for that and climatic scene WITH the Hardys  in the old house with the spies and  the overhead shot they  running
after them, showed where  Witches' Hollow WENT SO WRONG WITH MORON..

Her other episodes varied. In the Flickering Torch Callie showed intuitive searching  for, finding, the cruciual wrecked car and was spared
the pretended-to-faint-said-she-saw-a-mouse-scene of the book, and also Frank was also thankfully spared being tied up, and no Lefty the
Informer tied up. But she was  unhappily outranked in the end by a young technician kidnapped, bound and gagged, story turned into search for him she dropping out  at least was not at the conclusion for his rescue, would have been deeply embarrassing for BOTH of them.

 She left behind again  from Mystery of the Flying Courier though missed little, weak episode, at least before exiting  had had  the best scene of it joining Hardys in nighttime chase through junk yard, the high point for her presence, showed how would have helped--both boys and episode--had she continued,. Wipe Out aptly described her--though billed she was NOT in it.

 In Secret of the Jade Kwa Yin she had a decent  exit from the series,  finding  the shop in Chinatown plot centered around, showing courage investigating the docks alone at night, this time saw the case again through to the end.. (It did throw away  chance to put Callie in peril, NOT be Frank and Joe's fault, the boat blowing-up she just witnessed as the Hardys dove off. While talking to Joe Frank should have gotten call
from Mrs. Shaw asking when Callie was coming home from work, Frank, surprised, thought she had, then got the radio message  from her, at dock,  there on her own.  Frank should have line, ""Callie, you're out there ALONE? You shouldn't be. Go home RIGHT NOW."" Then  they
hear her scream, voice say, ""Take her to the ---we'll dump her overboard  in the morning."" Boys board, find her bound and gagged, shot of finger ashore pushing button, Hardys, Callie hear ticking-- TIME-BOMB, TRAP-- jump overboard as boat EXPLODES!)

Callie was left behind in Bayport  as show shifted to cases out of town,  around the world, team-ups with Nancy Drew. The Hardys NEVER
had anyone as good in the van AFTER. (That INCLUDE Pamela Sue Martin as Nancy Drew, wooden,  cold, completely lacking the charm
crucial to her character, why she ultimately failed in the role. Parker Stevenson  and Shaun Cassidy never had the chemistry with her they did with Lisa Eilbacher.) It was too bad she did not at least return for guest shot in Campus Terror, go undercover at the terrorized sorority, gotten kidnapped--wouhave been HISTORIC, first time for her,  raised stakes for Hardys saving her, But it was best she was well, far,  removed from the humiliating scenes in Mystery of the Hollywood Phantom Joe captured by title Enemy while  Nancy got away, be struggling bound hand and foot, gagged, at very same time Nancy is  shown walking around perfectly safe and yet even WORSE from failed final  half-season dreadful, disgraceful scene, WORST MOMENT  EVER for character, even worse than Iola mocking him at end of While the Clock Ticked (had to be that  BAD! to be worse) of JOE HARDY  BOUND AND GAGGED BY ONE PRETTY GIRL, RESCUED BY ANOTHER,
better had been NO season to have AVOIDED that. Eilbacher, Cassidy, Parker Stevenson were all lucky While the Clock Ticked, all-time WORST Hardy story, NOT filmed, recreating that SHAMEFUL  cover (Nancy Drew was NEVER depicted bound and gagged on one) in the title montage wasbad ENOUGH, filmed would have KILLED  show, Hardys made FOOLS rescued twice by Chet, COWARDS not admitting it
to Aunt andfriends accepting their cheers AS ""the heroes"", topping it  ""CALLIE GIGGLED""  like fingers across a blackboard, WORSE than the time-bomb's ticking,  with Iola alone  KNOWING truth, covering it up,  would have been UNENDURABLE  to watch, hear. (See my review with
ALTERNATE plot where is it's not ""Callie giggled"" BUT ""CALLIE GAGGED"" SHE'S WITH THE TIME BOMB NOW!)

Lisa  Eilbacher  ironically was one from the show to go on to a long career, notably the cadet struggling to climb the wall in An Officer and a
Gentlemen, so Callie DID come out ahead of Frank, Joe, and Nancy. Callie Shaw herself FINALLY had her day AFTER 60 YEARS to co-star, in the great Casefles series (1987-1998), such as the outstanding #1 Dead on Target, tied up (FIRST time) with Frank and Joe and the
terrorist bomb set to blow up Bayport Mall, #80 Dead of Night, eerie epic set, appropriately, on Halloween. . In the regular series running to #190  Motocross Madness, 2005, she also  finally had a few co-starring roles, notably #112 Demolition Mission, 1992,, bound and gagged
only time in it in trunk of junker Joe is at the wheel of in a demolition derby (even ""Dixon"" realizes  for once could NOT  have been Cretin Chet, elephantine  idiot would NEVER  have fit in thetrunk, his weight BURST THE TIRES). .

 In the first of the concurrent Super Mysteries team-ups (1991-1998), Double Crossing, Nancy surprisingly asks Frank, ""How's Callie?""--- the ONLY  record  they've met, the circumstances NEVER explained, the LAST great mystery  (see my review for MY speculation, Last-in-the-
Cast Callie meets Name-Above-the-Title Nancy, bit-player solves case, saves superstar, yes as MUST suspect--- IT'S A COMEDY). Callie NEVER  took part though Bess, George, EVEN NED DID, especially unfair  time  everyone was  together on spring break,  later Frank will tell
Nancy , ""As much as you mean to me, I'm in love with Callie"" (LONG way from ""favorite date""!)

Sadly, Callie Shaw has disappeared from the books as TV,. In 2005, Undercover Brothers #5 Rocky Road, she encountered Frank out while
jogging. They surveyed the vandalism  of Bayport High. ""We said our good-byes,"" Frank narrates, and she jogged away.

As of 2018, over 40 novels later, THERE HAS NOT BEEN SO MUCH AS A MENTION OF HER.",1445558400,,11174,4.961102106969205

2208646,4,B0007CNY54,"Mystery lover that I am, I'm sure it's no surprise to learn that I used to read both The Hardy Boys and Nancy Drew books as a kid.  I remember loving them, too.  (Well, until I found Trixie Belden.)  Somewhere along the line, I learned about The Hard Boys/Nancy Drew Mysteries, a series based loosely on the books that aired on TV during the late 70's.  Since I wasn't old enough to watch the show when it originally aired, I never saw it, but I recently caught up with the first season on DVD, and I enjoyed it.

For the first season, the show split time equally between the Hardys and Nancy.  While they never solved a case together, one week featured Frank and Joe Hardy (Parker Stevenson and Shaun Cassidy) while the next week was a Nancy Drew (Pamela Sue Martin) mystery.  For the first season set, all seven of the Hardy Boys episodes are features on the dual sided disc one while Nancy gets all of her cases on the dual sided second disc.  Since each episode is independent of each other and the two sets of characters never meet, the fact that the episodes are in order for the characters but not interspersed as originally aired doesn't really matter.  Heck, you could watch these episodes in random order and not really notice anything.

Probably the biggest thing that the loyal readers will notice is how characters have been shifted, combined, or deleted.  For example, Frank and Joe's mother is never mentioned, their best friend Chet only appears twice, and Joe's steady girlfriend is nowhere to be found.  Instead, they are supported by their dad Fenton (Ed Gilbert) and Callie (Lisa Eilbacher) who appears to be Fenton's secretary more than Frank's girlfriend.  Aunt Gertrude (Edith Atwater) does appear for a little comic relief.

The characters in Nancy's universe faired a little better.  Gone is the housekeeper and Bess, but her friend George (Jean Rasey) and potential love interest Ned (George O'Hanlon, Jr.) are present.  William Schallert also plays her father Carson.  In the first episode, none of the characters seem like themselves, including Nancy, but soon they start to right themselves and find characterizations that work for the show.

So what kind of cases to the characters take on?  Frank and Joe investigate a haunted house, try to save a rock star, and trap a ring of thieves in Hawaii.  Along the way, we even get to hear Shaun Cassidy sing a couple of times.  Nancy, meanwhile, investigates a haunted lighthouse, takes on a motorcycle gang, and investigates a group of actors in a local play who are acting very strangely.  None of these cases are pulled from the books, although two of the Hardy Boys episodes do share titles with the books, and many of them sound like they could be titles from the series.

The mysteries are surprisingly good.  A few I figured out early on, but most of the time I was left wondering what the heck was happening until the very end.  Yet things always make sense at the end.  There's one episode each that weren't up to the normal standards, but that's to be expected with anything.

The acting is fairly decent as well.  Don't get me wrong, this is definitely late 70's cheese, and it shows up just about everywhere from obvious Universal Studios town sets to obvious stock footage.  And yes, even the acting.  But the acting is good enough to make the shows watchable, and the cheese adds some fun to the mix.

And can I comment on the clothes?  Can we scream 70's any louder?  This is especially true in the Hardy Boy's episodes when Frank and Joe go around in the shortest shorts I have ever seen guys wear.  It's perfect for a laugh at how styles have changed.

There are no bonus features in this set, just the 14 hour long episodes on two double sided discs.  The picture is full frame and the sound is stereo in keeping with how they were originally broadcast.

There's nothing deep about these episodes; they are simply escapist fun.  And if you keep that attitude in mind, you'll enjoy the first season of The Hardy Boys/Nancy Drew Mysteries.",1432339200,2,4030,4.639830508474576

2208660,5,B0007CNY54,"Season one of one of my favorite crime fighting duos, is finally on DVD.  I wanted to let those who are interested, know that the DVDs aren't perfect.  There are a few frames that are a little blurry, but then go right back to virtually perfect again on the next scene.  Also, there is a little bit of back ground noise in a few of episodes. Heck, It might just be my player because I noticed it on Remington Steele too.  I'd like to go through the episodes for you, at least the Hardy Boys ones, as those are the ones I've seen the most of. However, imperfections or no, it is still a great show to watch for Hardy fans, and I highly recommend.
Here are the Seven Hardy Boy Episodes on the discs, and as far as I can see, there's no commentary or extras at all.
The Mystery of the Haunted House - this is about my #3 episode on the disk.  I really think the only reason they made this the first episode was so that Frank could mention that his dad, who on the show, never hardly ever solves a case, was in the New York Police Department fo over 20 years.  But, it is just an episode where, for some reason, the boys are following their father, even though he is supposed to be on a fishing trip.  The coolest thing about this episode is the Haunted House Disco they go to.  I wish they had one of those around here:)
The Mystery of Witches Hollow is about my favorite episode, and it is the 2nd Hardy Episode.  It is the most like a HB Book, and I think was written based on The Clue of the Screeching Owl.  The boys, Chet, and Callie go to Callie's uncle's house in Witches Hollow to investigate the strange things that have been happening there.
The Disappearing Floor is the third HB episode on the disc, and very loosely based on an HB book, I think.  I read a rebound edition of this one, as a kid, and I think that older version was an entirely different story than this is.  I would rate this as about #4 or #5 of the six HB episodes on the disk...mainly because they just didn't have the CG for it back then.
The Mystery of the Flickering Torch is next, and I find myself liking this one more every time I watch it.  It still ranks close to #7 of the seven episodes though.  It does have Ricky Nelson in it, and is very, very loosely based on one of the books.  Don't worry, you can read the book and/or watch the video, and it isn't going to ruin the book or video for you.  In this episode the boys are searching for a missing sound technician, who sets up the sound for Ricky Nelson.  It is amazing in this one, how Frank comes up with the answer to the mystery just as Ricky is taking off on his plane for London.  All of a sudden, Frank seems to have knowledge he didn't have before.
Probably my 2nd favorite episode, probably because it debuts Joe as a singer, is the Mystery of the Flying Courier, where Frank spots a girl that his dad had searched for, and failed to find, three years earlier (another failure for Fenton, people should hire the boys), at a teen disco where Joe is singing.  This is where the background story of Frank leaving every time Joe sings, begins.  Though you'll notice, he stays for Joe's last song of the episode..the entire song.  But I like the way the HB's handled this issue.  I saw the same issue on Remington Steele, and liked the Hardy's version a lot more.
The next episode is ""Wipe Out"", where Frank has saved for 18 months to go to Hawaii for the Pipeline Surfing Tournament, but while Frank is surfing, the boys' room is ""wiped out"" by crooks.  So, to earn enough money to stay on the island, the boys go undercover to work for the police, to try and catch these guys.  Guess what - they never fail:)  I will put this episode at about #3 on my list of episodes during the first year.
In the final episode, they finally dealt with orientals, which when I was a kid, seemed like they were in about every book.  They must have gotten re-written out of most of the stories when they re-wrote the books in the 50's I think, or around 1960?  Because, the books I read in the 60s had a lot of Chinese people in them.  The name of the episode is The Secret of the Jade Kwan Yin.  In this one, the boys are helping Callie with a school project, getting something off the ocean floor - they don't really say what she's collecting or doing, or why she's dressed kind of funny.  While helping Callie, a Chinese chest just about falls on one of them, on the ocean's floor.  It's been dumped by someone on a boat.  They take it home, find what is inside, and Callie says she can find where it came from, in China Town.  So, they go to China town, Callie does find the item, and they ask the Chinese girl (later to be Miles O'Brien's wife in Star Trek) about it, and she sends them to her Uncle, who is supposed to know all about it.  When her uncle meets the boys, he wants to speak with them in private, and the boys end up promising to bring the item to him.  But, while the boys were in China Town, the two Chinese crooks, who were going to pick up the Oriental Box originally, break in to the Hardy's home and steal it.  The boys give chase, but a van blocks their way.  This is the one episode that the boys really don't solve, but end up winners in the end - one of the few times they don't solve the crime totally.  I'd rate this one in the 4 or 5 range of the 7 HB episodes on the disk.  It has one of my favorite parts, when the Chinese guy attacks the boys, and Joe moves a gong behind a curtain in the next room, and the Chinese guy goes through the curtains, and gets a heck of a headache!
The first season was the best...I can only think of about 3 episodes that measure up in the 2nd season, and you can't even compare the 3rd season to the first.  They made some strange choices after the first year, perhaps they were to help keep Nancy Drew alive, I don't know.  But, they pretty much abandon Bayport in the rest of the series.  You see about a minute of Bayport in the 2nd season.  And, because of that, they write Callie out of the show, and I thought Callie was a valuable member of the show, and also wrote Chet out of the show...but he wasn't in it much - only two episodes, I think.  And Witches Hollow is the episode that he spends the most time in, by far.

What I don't understand, is why they don't ever film these shows the way they were originally portrayed in the book.  I got a partial answer during an interview on youtube with Parker Stevenson (who I also thought had such a classy sounding name, only to find that his last name is really Parker, and his middle name was really Stevenson.)  But, Parker said during the interview that they decided to do things, like write their own mysteries due to the constraints of television.  You know, each episode is approximately 48 minutes long, and they have a commercial break approximately every 6 minutes.  And, if you've noticed, on shows like this, they like to break for commercials on brief cliffhangers.

Now he didn't explain why Lisa Eilbacher wasn't his favorite girl in the show, like she was in the books.  I'm guessing it is because they wanted to have each story available for Frank to have a love interest.  Frank and Joe didn't have girlfriends in every show, but, in probably 75% of them.  The same goes for Joe, no steady girl - in fact no Iola at all.  No wife for Fenton, even though Mrs. Hardy played a small part even in the books.

But, IMO, the best season is the first, so don't miss it.  A few of the episodes have titles either exactly like or similar to HB books.  But, the only book that I could see that was quite a bit like an episode is ""The Mystery of Witches Hollow"", which is built on the story  ""The Clue of the Screeching Owl"".  Even if you've read the book, the episode is still worth watching.  It is one of Chet's only two episodes in the entire show, and true to form, he's always eating something.  Chet is also in the ""Mystery of the Flying Courier"", briefly.  In his brief roles, he's actually pretty funny.  So, those are the only characters from the books who are in the TV Show - Chet, Aunt Gertrude, Callie Shaw, the Hardy boys, and Fenton Hardy, Oh and Chief Colig, who is always grousing about something..  I don't know why Callie was removed from the series after season 1, I would have liked to have seen her go on through  more of the rest of the show.  But, I'm guessing she wasn't in the show much after the 1st season, because the show wasn't in Bayport hardly at all, after the first season.

As Parker said, I'm not sure how close they came to emulating the actual Hardy Boys, but it was an enjoyable show, and a show you could watch with your kids.

Also, in Season 1 is where they begin the myth that Frank doesn't want to hear Joe sing, and therefore runs off every time he sings.  But, Frank is largely innocent, and circumstances cause him to have to miss Joe sing, more than anything else.  And, he doesn't run off the last time Joe Sings in the Flying Courier.

I haven't written about Nancy Drew, as I've only read about 4 of her books.  So, I'm just not sure how well it matches up to the books. I know that Bess doesn't show up until season 2, and she's supposed to be blonde and slightly pudgy.  But, IMO, Ruth Cox, who played Bess, was blonde and very attractive - certainly not pudgy.  Joe ended up getting a smooch or two from her while they were trying to build a romance between ND and Frank.  But, again I'll say, the stories in Season 1 of ND are probably the best, whether you've read ND or not.  And, they eventually phase her out in season 2 - or she phases herself out.  I'm just guessing her Season 1 ratings weren't nearly as good as the Boys.  They also change George Fayne in the 2nd season, and I liked the first one.  And, the first Ned was nothing like the real Ned.  They change Ned for one episode, and replace him with Rick Springfield? (I think).  Anyway, he was much more like Ned in the 2nd season.  Plus, no housekeeper in the series.  And, if you are an ND fan, make sure you watch the 3 or 4 old movies with Bonita Granville playing the part.  They are really good!

Anyway, don't miss this DVD, if your a fan.  I you aren't a fan, then entertain yourself with something else, I guess.

I think I liked the first season the most because it was the only season that was set predominantly in Bayport, or the Bayport area.",1414368000,3,10333,4.201522842639594

2208674,4,B0007CNY54,"THE HARDY BOYS MYSTERIES & NANCY DREW began in the Winter of 1977 as separate series alternating in the same time slot on ABC. Early the following year, the casts combined, and in the Fall of 1978 the Nancy Drew thread was dropped and The Hardy Boys Mysteries continued on alone.

This abbreviated 1st Season boxed set captures the twin-series idea at its most ambitious, with adolescent brothers Frank and Joe Hardy, created by author Franklin W. Dixon, sleuthing for clues one week and Carolyn Keene's Nancy Drew investigating crimes the next.

Actually, as fans of the books know, Dixon and Keene were both pen names used by Edward Stratemeyer when he created those characters in 1927. Just as the young detectives have been updated in print every so often to accommodate successive generations of readers, so too did the TV show present Joe (Shaun Cassidy, brother of David Cassidy of The Partridge Family), Frank (Parker Stevenson), and Nancy (Pamela Sue Martin) as thoroughly 1970s kids.

The boys are outfitted with motorcycles, Joe enjoys a retro-pop singing career, and Nancy has a certain freedom of movement only the hippest of dads in a permissive age would allow. Hardy Boys finds the always-amicable siblings following in the footsteps of their father, Fenton (Edmund Gilbert), a private detective, as they untangle capers that take them from haunted houses to Hawaii.

The Hardy episodes make for brisk, family viewing, much better than the bubblegum reputation that built up, undeservedly, around the series. Slightly less interesting are the Nancy Drew programs (despite a more entertaining supporting cast), but only because the heroine is less focused and distractingly man-crazy, and the storylines are less exotic.

An emphasis on the supernatural and science-fiction themes lends a Scooby-Doo vibe to several programs in both series, though the best stories are the ones with straightforward, meat-and-potatoes detective work.

Among the directors on either series are Jack Arnold (The Creature from the Black Lagoon), Winrich Kolbe (Star Trek: The Next Generation), and actors Vince Edwards and Stuart Margolin. The Hardy Boys Mysteries and The Nancy Drew Mysteries Trivia
* Jamie Lee Curtis and Robert Englund, who played the biker couple Mary and Gar in an episode of this series, started acting in horror films during this era.

Follow the clues to mystery, adventure and thrills as Season 1 of the THE HARDY BOYS NANCY DREW MYSTERIES comes to DVD for the first time ever! Teen sensations Shaun Cassidy, Parker Stevenson and Pamela Sue Martin star as brave super-sleuths in 14 spooky episodes loaded with spellbinding action and smash-hit pop songs, including Shaun Cassidy's #1 hit ""Da Doo Ron Ron.""

Inspired by the hugely popular books and with an amazing lineup of guest stars, including Jamie Lee Curtis, Mark Harmon, Bob Crane, Rick Nelson and more, it's no surprise that THE HARDY BOYS NANCY DREW MYSTERIES is an open-and-shut case for fun!

This detective drama takes me all the way back to my childhood days to when my babysitters used to watch it every Sunday night on ABC and was shown in reruns on TV Land briefly back in 1999 too, but after THE HARDY BOYS tanked in the Winter of 1979, Pamela Sue Martin played Fallon Carrington Colby on the astonishing prime-time soap opera DYNASTY from 1981-1985 and Parker Stevenson did BAYWATCH as courageous  Los Angeles County Lifeguard(Craig Pomroy)from the Fall of 1989 thru the Spring of 1990 before it tanked.",1389830400,,3492,5.089160839160839

2208686,5,B0007CNY54,"This show debuted when I was in 7th grade and I loved it.  I got the first two seasons for Christmas this past year and I look forward to getting season three.  I was a huge fan of The Hardy Boys and Nancy Drew.  It was a travesty to lose Pamela Sue Martin in season two.  I always thought it was a shame that she didn't at least finish the season.

I take issue with Amazon's review saying that her episodes showed Nancy Drew being more boy crazy than in solving the case and I don't agree with that.  Nancy Drew was portrayed as a very serious part time ivestigator as she liked to put it.  In fact she is kind of oblivious to her friend Ned Nickerson who clearly likes her as more than a friend.

Overall, these DVD's are a must for anyone who enjoyed watching the show in the 70's.  They are fun and it takes you back to a simpler time.  If the show were being filmed now, we'd see the Hardy Boys and Nancy Drew with cell phones and other high tech gadgets to help them out which could also be interesting but this show captures a more simpler time for detective work and it's just plain fun to watch them.",1360627200,,1110,4.097222222222222
2208687,2,B0007CNY54,"Noramlly, I am a 70s addict! Having grown up in the 80s, I can't say that I watched any of the great shows like Starsky and Hutch or The White Shadow when they were actually on television, although they are some of my favorite tv shows ever. When I came across the Hardy Boys on DVD, I thought I was in for a treat! Since Starsky and Hutch lasted only 4 seasons and they stopped releasing White Shadow on DVD after the 2nd season (something I hate about old tv shows ... sometimes they release one or two seasons and then stop pulling the rug out from fans), I figured the Hardy Boys would satisfy my craving for all things 70s. Boy, was I wrong!

I can deal with the fact that the acting is on par with most porno movies. There is one episode where they are in a lab at some company and one of the Hardy Boys is riding with a girl who might just give one of the worst acting performances of all time on film. Seriously, she makes informercial actors look like Jack Nicholson. And the camerawork and editing resembles a local public access television production. The special effects are laughably cute with some of the worst green screen effects I've seen. Although, it was the 70s and there was no CGI or computr animation. Even the opening sequence uses an incredible cheesy Beetlejuice-esque model with little fake trees. THIS is the good part of the show ... the 70s cheese. Now for the bad ...

The weak storylines and incredibly scripted performances are what takes me out of the element. Unlike a show like Starsky and Hutch or Diff'rent Strokes where you actually care about the characters and invest in them, I find myself watching the Hardy Boys and not liking them. It really seems like watching a high school play. The characters don't connect with each other the way Jack, Janet, Chrissy and Larry do in Three's Company or any other successful show with a cast. The characters seem empty and bordering on annoying. Two handsome young kids who fake cheese smile through the whole episode and seem as though are reading cue cards located just off camera. I really root for the bad guys against them most times. And the other actors/actresses lend nothing to the show at all other than a robotic delivery of lines that leads you through the script. After 5 episodes, I couldn't even tell you any other characters besides the Hardy Boys and their father although there are several reoccuring characters.

Interestingly enough, Glen A. Larsen is the executive producer. He went on to produce some of the most successful shows of the 80s, including my all time favorite, The A-Team. You would recognize his name from Magnum P.I., Battlestar Gallactica, The Fall Guy and Knight Rider. While nobody would suspect any of those shows would win the Pulitzer Prize for writing, all of them seemed to have a single congruent plotline that includes an easy resolution and fairly good suspension of belief. The Hardy Boys seems to go in a dozen directions even though the 'mystery' is pretty much solved in the first 5 minutes. The rest of the show consists of the Hardy boys chasing people and being chased by people and looking for evidence. It is almost as if you could see the kinks being worked out by Larsen's team before stepping into the major leagues with shows like the A-Team and Knight Rider which have much more likable and well developed characters. Even a lot of the plotlines of episodes (someone trying to kill a well known rock and roller, etc.) are later recycled in episodes of the A-Team and Knight Rider such as the terrible Boy George A-Team episode or the horrible Knight Rider episode when a famous singer falls in love with Michael Knight while he tries to save her from murdering managers.

In terms of suspension of belief ... each week the Hardy Boys foil some fantastic plot to kill someone or stop some evil corporation bent on world domination from completing a sinister plot to take over the world. Yet the next week, nobody believes them when they find simple evidence to stop the next plot. One week they are stopping an evil company that is using holograms to take over the world and the next their father and the police chief are scolding them 'Oh you young kids. What trouble are you causing?' as they find pieces of evidence others overlook. I understand that the premise of the show is two kids who help their father solve crimes but after they save the world 3 times in the last second before armageddon, you'd think people would start to believe their theories. And there are some situations which just leave you shaking your head. Such as when they are trapped in a closet of a room that is on fire yet someone locked the door of the closet. So, rather than kick down the door and escape, they find some powertools including a drill and a jigsaw in the closet (because who doesn't leave their jigsaw and giant drill in a closet in an entertinament agency?), kick a hole in the wall (which the entire wall moves up and down when they kick it ha ha) to find electrical circuits and strip the wires so they can hardwire the powertools into the electrical system and then use the powertools to cut a hole in the door. Again, I understand the whole 70s cheese thing, but this is just annoying to watch.

I honestly really wanted to like this show. I was so excited to watch it. Normally I can watch 5 or more Starsky and Hutch or A-Team episodes in a row but I can't get through more than 2 Hardy Boys without wanting to take a nap. I will not be buying seasons 2 or 3, which says a lot. That is like a crack addict saying no thanks. I think anyone who gives this show more than a couple stars is doing it because they watched the show while growing up and has a soft spot for it. Which I can completely understand because Silver Spoons is one of the worst shows in the history of TV but I still love to watch it because I can remember watching it as a kid and eating fruit roll ups and drinking Capri Suns. But as someone who is a fan of 70s television ... I just can't get into the Hardy Boys no matter how much I try. Watching the poor production values and bad quality of the video it is amazing to me that the Robert Conrad show Hart to Hart or Three's Company was made at around the same time because the quality is so much better. It looks like someone filmed The Hardy Boys through a pair of pantyhose.

I'll skip this series and instead re-watch my White Shadow or Starky and Hutch or even I-Spy where you really get into the well developed characters more than the one dimensional constant high school yearbook smiles and feathered hair of the Hardy duo. I will say that I am surprised nobody has spoofed this show on Saturday Night Live yet. Probably because the show in itself is like a spoof of 70s television in general. The only fun part is to watch out for all the reoccurring character actors who used to be on all the shows of the time. And of course the announcer who might have one of the best voices in all of television history. 'And now the Hardy Boys in the case of ... '",1360368000,2,7031,4.433874709976799

Both the Hardy Boys and Nancy Drew shows are great, but a word about the Nancy Drew ones.  My daughter enjoys them very much; we have so few shows with a heroine and these are among the best. Nancy solves the crimes with her fierce intellect and determination. Good qualities to exemplify for girls.

If you are looking for Oscar-quality writing / acting / drama, this isn't it.  If you are looking to see some classic childrens' lit transferred lovingly to the small screen, I don't think you'll be disappointed, even if you didn't grow up during the 70's.",1329609600,,928,4.377906976744186

2208703,5,B0007CNY54,"I grew up with this show and recently caught a few episodes on a retro t.v. station and decided that I must buy the d.v.d.s . Great fun ! Feathered hair ,groovy outfits,teen idols,jet setting detectives,pop hits by Shaun Cassidy,cool locations,mysteries, and interesting guest stars make for a fun time. I mainly purchased this for the Hardy boys episodes but also enjoyed Nancy Drew. When I was young,I never liked her character,thought she was too much of a goody two shoes ( plus I was jealous of her,working with the Hardy boys and all- silly teen girl thoughts),but I see now that she could be a feisty,intelligent and even ,at times,a pretty cool girl. My favorite episodes were ""Mystery of the fallen Angels"",Nancy poses as a carnie! With Jamie Lee Curtis and Robert Englund-both fun to see in different characters. My other favorite was Wipe-out"" with the Hardy boys in Hawaii. I did enjoy all 14 episodes. Simply classic !",1285200000,,931,4.825
2208704,5,B0007CNY54,I bought this as a birthday present for my 45 year old mother who had all the books and watched the show when she was younger. She loved it!

2208709,3,B0007CNY54,"The Hardy Boys, and Nancy Drew, are both fictional detectives, in long running series of mystery books, written for juveniles.  The format of this Glen A. Larson series, was to alternate episodes of The Hardy Boys, with Nancy Drew.  There would be some crossover in the second season, but in the first season, the characters in the two shows were entirely separate, with seven episodes of each program produced.  Both shows appeal to fans with 70's nostalgia.  The series' writers were limited to those subjects that maintained a wholesome image, as the characters did not get involved with sex, drugs, guns, violent crime, or murder.  While the series is more kid friendly than most in this era, it might not hold as much interest to those seeking serious mystery.

In 1977, nineteen year old Shaun Cassidy's singing career was red hot, powered by his #1 hit, a remake of The Crystals's, Da Do Ron Ron.  Casting him as Joe Hardy, was sure draw for his primarily female fan base, and Cassidy got first billing over Parker Stevenson (25), who was cast as older brother Frank Hardy.  Ed Gilbert played their father, private investigator, Fenton Hardy, and Lisa Eilbacher as Callie Shaw.  Like the books, these stories are targeted at a teenage audience, and feature clean cut brothers Frank and Joe, mostly racing around wide-eyed, playing detective.  They don't use weapons, get into fights, or even chase girls much.  Mainly they poke around politely, asking a lot of questions, discuss the case with each other ad infinitum, collect fingerprints, and make sure that one or other are not hurt.  The Hardy's appear to be college age, but apparently do not work or attend college.  Although post high school, they often act much younger.  Kid detectives can be cute, but adults that fumble and bumble around, make excuses, and hide behind their father, may be kind of hard for most adults to take seriously.  You need to be in a certain frame of mind to appreciate the Hardy's, who operate like the kids in Scooby Doo, trying to solve mysteries, and convince adults to listen to them.  Their van, conjures up visions of the Mystery Machine.

The Mystery of the Haunted House, a very poorly written episode, was somehow selected as the pilot.  The most noteworthy aspect, is an appearance by Richard Kiel (Jaws from the Bond movies), dressed as a Frankenstein lookalike.  In The Flickering Torch Mystery, Frank and Joe lock themselves in a closet, and barely get out before being overcome by smoke.  Sometimes, these guys are a real danger to themselves.  It takes up to episode five, The Mystery of the Flying Courier, before Cassidy fans get to see Joe Hardy perform live on stage, and Frank actually get into a fight.  The Hardy's highlight, is probably Wipe-Out, where the boys get ripped off while in Hawaii, and go undercover to get evidence on a ring of thieves preying on tourists.  Wow, and the guys even hang out with a couple of girls.  It is back to the ways of Scooby Doo, in the season finale, The Secret of the Jade Kwan Yin, where Frank and Joe, stumble into a jewel smuggling scheme, tangle briefly with some martial arts experts, and play catch with a valuable jade statue.

The situation regarding Nancy Drew is a little different.  Pamela Sue Martin was 24, and had experience working on the blockbuster, The Poseidon Adventure (1972), but she had no huge teenage fan base to appease, so the writers played it straight with her character.  Nancy is very serious about being a detective, and being indecisive, or making goofy mistakes, would undermine her credibility, so she mostly avoids the kind of blunders the Hardy's are prone to.  As a proper young lady, she is even less likely to get into fights, or engage in physical violence.  Veteran character actor William Schallert, as Nancy's father, lawyer Carson Drew, brings class, with a twinkle in his eye, to whatever he does.  Jean Rasey makes a good sidekick as Nancy's pal George Fayne.  There is plenty of yakking with her friends, and subpar acting, but overall the Nancy Drew Mysteries is more serious and focused, and features a much stronger cast of guest stars.

A Haunting We Will Go, is a mystery set in a theater, involving the cast of a play that Nancy is performing in.  The distinguished players include Victor Buno, Bob Crane, Carl Betz, Dina Merrill and Pippa Scott.  The Mystery of the Fallen Angels, is another episode with a notable guest cast that includes Beverly Garland, Robert Alda, A. Martinez, Jamie Lee Curtis, and Robert Englund.  Nancy pretends to be a runaway, and gets a job at a carnival, and then does some fancy motorcycle riding to escape from a gang of thieves.  As Miss Drew's adventures often do, this episode features the police showing up just in the nick of time.

The first season of The Hardy Boys Mysteries, is a not a very well written.  The writers were subject to a number of constraints, and in catering to a teenage audience, they did not do a very good job.  It was all too common for things not to go the Hardy's way, and for people not believe them, like the boy who cried wolf.  It's a running gag, but one that gets old fast, and featuring Shaun Cassidy, at times was a distraction.  In the second season, there were radical changes as The Nancy Drew Mysteries almost disappeared as a separate program, and Nancy became more of a recurring guest star in the Hardy Boys' cases.  The quality of the Hardy Boys improved, with better writing, exotic locations, and more prominent guest stars, however with her role reduced, Pamela Sue Martin left the series before the conclusion of the second season.

Young stars, Stevenson, Martin, and Cassidy, are attractive and talented, but there is simply no way for the actors to overcome poor writing.  The first season is recommended mainly to Nancy Drew fans, and those seeking light fluffy adventure, or kid friendly mysteries.",1262217600,,5896,4.766502463054187

Does Amazon contact the companies that produce the TV show DVD's?? If so will you request they complete the seasons of other shows as soon as they can and maybe suggest they put them out in competed series packs then I would be more inclined to buy. I worry when they put out only a few seasons then stop like ""The Flying Nun: Season 3"" with Sally Field I have the 2 seasons but their is still one more to complete. But if they put out the complete series I would jump on them and order quick.

There is very little that could be offensive(ie sometimes are there are some girls in bikinis, but that is not the norm).  The mystery stories are intricate & challenging to figure out.  The writers make the audience suspect more than one person, so it's hard to figure out.  Very well done.  We love it!",1235520000,,365,4.46969696969697

Now as an adult, you can definately  find alot of plot problems, cheap sets and chances on seeing Shawn Cassidy or Parker S. shirtless! (not that it bothers me, but what sluts!!!  remember the Fitzpatricks??) The writers must have been smokin' lotz of Wacky Tobaccy when they worked this show, but so did the Krofft Brothers. There lots of bad dialogue and direction to quibble on Hardy Boys.
Then , why was Nancy Drew such a better show? Acting, better. sets still cheap, but i liked this half of the double bill. Actually, the shows were shown back to back by weeks (one week Boys, next week Nancy) I maybe mistaken, but the episode format may have changed over the years. I believed Boys was a lot more popular than Nancy.

I like Pamela Sue Martin.  Just wish she was in all the Nancy Drew episodes.  There are a few episodes with two different actresses playing Nancy.  Not as good as the original.

Imagine my surprise when I started watching Season 1 that I was so bored with the Hardy Boys and wondering why did I like them so much. Then I started watching the Nancy Drew episodes and loved every minute of it. Nancy's episodes seem to hold up much better than the Hardy Boys. Nancy's episodes were well written and acted.

It is classic T.V. and I get a kick out of the fashions, etc.  More importantly I still follow the stories and they do bring you along, especially the Halloween episode.  It feels erie.

2208723,3,B0007CNY54,"The Hardy Boys episodes are by far the better in this series.  The characters conform pretty well to the Frank and Joe of the books - Frank a bit more responsible, Joe younger and more impulsive, and the interaction between the two of them is amusing and enjoyable.  (It's also fun - and sometimes downright scary - to revisit the late '70's and the fashions thereof.  As, for example, Rick Nelson's rock star duds).

However, Nancy is a disappointment.  While Bonita Granville's version, in the 1930's, was silly and hyperactive and immature, Pamela Sue Martin's version is truculent and sullen and strident.  The Nancy of the books, confronted by someone who underestimated or looked down on her her because of her youth or her sex, simply smiled, solved the case, and impressed the socks off of the doubter.  This Nancy argues, in a really whiny, annoying way.  That Ned Nickerson is a boring nerd and George Fayne seems to have switched personalities with the Bess Marvin of the books just make things worse.

I'm now watching the mid-1990's Nancy Drew and Hardy Boys produced in Canada, and plan at some point to see the movie that came out this summer (2007).  While hope springs eternal that some day someone will get Nancy right, things aren't looking good so far.",1192838400,,1272,4.767123287671233

No violence or adult language, just good clean fun. My husband has managed to stay in the same room while they are on, and has been able to find humor in how terrible the acting and plots are.

2208726,4,B0007CNY54,"I gave this product four stars, because I would have prefer to have the Hardy Boys set instead of the Nancy Drew set. I feel that the Hardy Boy Series were more enjoyable than the Nancy Drew series, because it's more interesting, comedy, adventuresome, plus the actors, Frank (Parker Stevenson)and Joe Hardy (Shaun Cassidy)are so cute to watch.

In my opinion, the detective Nancy Drew (Pamela Sue Martin) was not a very good actor and I was bored with the stories. I prefer the Nancy Drew books alone than the movies itself. I wish the company had sold them as individuals so my money would be better spent on the Hardy Boys.

Although, the series are in excellent colors, closed captioned, and it is good to see the Hardy Boy TV series again. Sure wish they had a better luck with this series like the Magnum P.I. or Murder She Wrote TV series did. Because they would have plenty of books to make a good run of TV series for a long time.

2208727,5,B0007CNY54,"It took me some time to decide and buy the first season of THE HARDY BOYS/NANCY DREW MYSTERIES on dvd. I remember the show including the opening theme music and of course Parker Stevenson, Shaun Cassidy, and Pamela Sue Martin as the Hardy boys and Nancy Drew, but I couldn't recall any specific episode. So I figured that either the show wasn't that good or I would change the channel right after the opening (because something else would come on at the same time).

Anyway, I decided to buy it along with the season two release. And I have to say that I was surprised. The story lines are intriguing and held my interest throughout the set, which was pretty good considering the plots are really G-Rated. No violence or gore, and there's only the slightest hint of bodily injury to either the Hardy boys or Nancy Drew when they investigate cases...but the episodes are still exciting to watch. Great for the whole family or when you just want a break from the real world.

The 14 episodes are on two double-sided dvds and no extra features. From what I understand, when THE HARDY BOYS/NANCY DREW MYSTERIES show was airing they would alternate the two shows from week to week. One week would feature the Hardy Boys and the other would feature Nancy Drew. On this dvd set all the Hardy Boys episodes are on one dvd and Nancy Drew is on the other. The picture and sound quality are pretty good and it's fun to see the hairstyles and fashions of that period.

One thing that did get on my nerves was Shaun Cassidy's singing. I liked his songs back then, but now I felt like the show was really exploiting the singing thing. Cassidy has a nice voice and they did keep the song numbers to a minimum, but they kept popping up with regularity throughout season one. But that's my only gripe!",1183161600,6,1784,4.483076923076923
2208728,4,B0007CNY54,"Teen sensations Shaun Cassidy, Parker Stevenson and Pamela Sue Martin star as the famous super detectives in season 1 of this classic Glen Larson television series, which premiered in 1977. Based on the books by Franklin W. Dixon and Carolyn Keene, the charcters come to life in a unique and most original way.

Shaun Cassidy and Parker Stevenson star as Frank and Joe Hardy while Pamela Sue Martin portrays Nancy Drew. In the first season, the writers and producers really stuck as closely to the original books as much as they could,making it the best season of the entire series. Shaun Cassidy performs his hit songs ""Da Doo Ron Ron, That's Rock 'N' Roll"" and a couple of others as well.

Shaun Cassidy and Parker Stevenson's portrayl of the Hardy Boys was great and original, but Pamela Sue Martin's portrayl of Nancy Drew was even better. She fit the part so well-the clothes, the hair, her voice, her mannerisums, etc. Everything about her was pure Nancy Drew. Her stories were also much better and much more intruiging and suspensful than that of the Hardy Boys.

The prints are in very good condition and the audio is good as well(2.0), with the voice over at the beginning of each episode. All of the episodes are great, but my favourites are: ""The Mystery of the Haunted House, The Mystery of Witches' Hollow, The Mystery of Pirate's Cove, The Secret of the Whispering Walls and The Mystery of the Solid Gold Kicker."" There are no features of any kind in Season 1, but I am just so thrilled it as finally been released on DVD.

2208731,2,B0007CNY54,I was rather disappointed in season 1.  I never missed this show on TV and thought it was the best but what does a kid know?  It just does not hold up after all these years.  My husband and I were bored stiff watching these episodes.  I would not recommend this to anyone unless like me you were obsessed with Shaun Cassidy back in the day.  (I took my 3rd grade pictures in a tshirt with him on it).  However I think we have all grown up and this just doesn't have enough to interest adults today.,1173484800,12,498,4.082474226804123
2208732,4,B0007CNY54,"I used to rent these shows from a video store when I was a kid, and I was thrilled when I found out that they were on dvd.  Some things have been changed from the original stories, such as the elimination of certain characters from the books (Bess and Hannah from the Nancy Drew stories and Iola from the Hardy Boys). Ned Nickerson, who was Nancy's boyfriend in the books, is kind of a geeky guy who now works for Nancy's father, and Frank's girlfriend from the books, Callie, now works as a secretary for Fenton Hardy.  Modern kids will also notice certain things that date the shows, such as the references to records instead of CDs and the kids using CBs in their cars to communicate with their parents instead of cell phones.  Still, these are really fun shows.  They have little violence (just a brawl or two with the bad guys) and no swearing, just good clean fun and excitement with some nice humor thrown in for good measure (ex. ""You think he's suspicious of anything?""  ""What's suspicious about two men carrying a sarcophagus down an alley at midnight?""  ""You're right, good."").

I believe that the Nancy Drews have unfairly been given kind of a bad rap, even though Ned's cluelessness and George's craveness do make me squirm a bit (they weren't at all like that in the books).  However, they I don't think that they're that bad, and in fact, I think that A Haunting We Will Go and Mystery of the Ghostwriter's Cruise are the two best episodes in this set.  A Haunting We Will Go has more humor in it than the others, and Mystery of the Ghostwriter's Cruise is really rather clever because it does a good job of making all the suspects look equally guilty.  For awhile, I really wasn't sure who did it.

I was also happy that the only previews occur on disc 1 and that they even provided a notice before they begin that you can skip them entirely by hitting disc menu on your remote.  I have other dvds that don't let you do this.

Here's a list of the episodes included on the two dvds:

Hardy Boys:

1. The Mystery of the Haunted House -- Frank and Joe's father, a private detective, has been acting strange and sneaking around town when he's supposed to be away on a fishing trip.  Then, someone breaks into the Hardys' house in the middle of the night.  Frank and Joe must brave a haunted house filled with spooky mazes and a graveyard to find their father and the answer to this mystery.

2. The Mystery of Witches' Hollow -- Callie's uncle, a former policeman, says that some strange things have been happening around his cabin in the woods that need looking into.  However, by the time the Hardy boys arrive, he has disappeared.  Could there be any truth to the local legends about a witch in the woods?

3. The Disappearing Floor -- Frank and Joe are tailing someone for their father when they see something really amazing: a flying saucer.  Upon further investigation, they find a house nearby with many odd things in it, including a floor that isn't really there.  Sound confusing?  Imagine how the Hardy boys must feel, especially since no one else has seen these things or believes that they even exist.  There is an answer, though, and it may have something to do with a mysterious missing scientist.

4. The Flickering Torch Mystery -- Frank and Joe are helping their father investigate the disappearance of an audio engineer who worked for a famous rock star (who is played by Ricky Nelson).  Soon, they come to believe that the rock star's life is in danger.  The question is, who is behind it all? (Note: They never actually mention it in the show, but the Flickering Torch is supposed to be the name of the rock band.  The show was based on a book of the same name.)

5. The Mystery of the Flying Courier -- Joe's band is making its debut in a club near the airport.  While Joe is singing, Frank spots a girl that he used to know who ran away from home years ago.  It quickly becomes obvious that the girl is involved in something dangerous, but what is it?

6. Wipe-Out -- What's this about Frank and Joe turning into hotel thieves? The Hardy boys take a trip to Hawaii for a surfing contest, but if they don't watch out, they may get wiped out by something worse than a wave.

7. The Secret of the Jade Kwan Yin -- While diving for seashells with Callie, the Hardy boys find a Chinese statue that has been thrown overboard from a boat.  Before they can return the statue to its rightful owner, it is stolen.  Can they get it back and catch the thieves before it's too late?

Nancy Drew

8. The Mystery of Pirate's Cove -- Nancy and her friends see some strange things at a local lighthouse that has been empty for years.  Then, a strange man offers to buy it, telling them an even stranger story about the place.  Could the lighthouse really be haunted?

9. The Mystery of the Diamond Triangle -- Nancy is flying in her glider (Of course, Nancy can fly a glider!  She can do everything!) when she sees a car accident.  However, when the police go to investigate, not only is there no car but also no way to get onto that section of road because of a bridge that has been washed out.  Nancy is determined to prove that what she saw was real and find the missing car.

2208736,4,B0007CNY54,"The 1970""s version of Hardy Boys/Nancy Drew mystery was created by Glen Larson, the creator of the classic Battlestar Gallactica, Buck Rogers, Quincy, Knight Rider and The Fall Guy (Guy is not available on DVD-WHY ISNT?).

in the late 1970's, These shows aired in the family hour on Sunday night against 60 minutes. These family friendly shows were good adventures in a vein like Disney had in the same family hour. Larson wrote some of these modern updates without talking down to the audience and with satire and humor built in

Teen idol Shawn Cassidy & (a pre-Baywatch) Parker Stevenson starred as the Hardys. A pre-Dynasty Pamela Sue Martin played Nancy Drew. These shows were also filled with minor celebrities ala Love Boat, Fantasy Island and Murder She Wrote

On Dvd, this collection is good family fare. There are NO extras on this collection, just good TV work-buy it and enjoy with your family. It does not date itself from its original airings and can be enjoyed for a new generation

So Universal, when you putting out volume two?

2208738,5,B0007CNY54,"The Hardy Boys/Nancy Drew Mysteries season one is a welcomed addition to my DVD collection. It brings me back to when television was entertaining and fun to watch. The stories are definitely hokey and dated by today's standards, but as a fan of the show they are still entertaining and fun to watch. The video transfer is pretty decent and the sound comes through clean and crisp on my sound system. The best part of season one is the opening theme music for the show, its still one of my favorite TV themes. With all the reality junk on TV today, season one of The Hardy Boys/Nancy Drew Mysteries is still good clean fun for the whole family to enjoy. Now you don't have to wait each week to join Joe, Frank, Fenton and Nancy Drew; they're all here in season one. My only complaint with this set was the use of double sided discs by the studio, other than that the set is great! I hope the remaining seasons of this series are on the way so I can complete the series.

This is, if I recall correctly, not the original order of how they aired it seems like they would air a Nancy Drew episode and the next Sunday air a Hard Boys episode....finally in the later seasons I think Nancy & the boys finally joined as a team for a few times....of course it has been years so I could be mstaken.  But watching these after not seeing them in almost 30 years brings back lots of memories and they are ""new"" to me in a sense because I hadn't seen them in ages.

2208749,5,B0007CNY54,"Boy....you talk about a step back into Television nastalgia, Teenage classics.... Do I remember this show...

Every Sunday evening, which is when the network in our area aired it, we anxiously gathered around the TV to tune into our favorite Teen idol, Shaun Cassidy, and of course his counterparts ""Frank"" and ""Nancy Drew"" as they would excitedly solve impossible, yet thrilling crimes.

Now you may consider our emotional level back then a bit cheesy-tolerable, but for the late 70's, and with Cassidy in one of the lead roles---well, Teen television just didn't get any better than this!  Be it that some episode's didn't fair quite as good as some others, but we ALWAYS tuned in, no matter what.  And some later episodes (much stereotyped as 70's TV filmed back then), 'Frank' and 'Joe' even got to mix with some fun Romance issues.  Whoooo. Just watching Shaun Cassidy light up the television screen for a few moments with some girl was worth the fantasy ((!!))  Hey---it was Shaun Cassidy. His acting credentials counteracting those of Stevenson (Parker) proved he was much more than just a pretty face who could belt out ""Da Do Ron Ron"", back then.

I am looking forward to soon owning the entire series out on DVD now.",1145491200,3,1226,4.809523809523809
2208750,5,B0007CNY54,"""The Hardy Boys / Nancy Drew Mysteries"" has always been one of my favorite `70's TV shows.  I've watched this entire series about twice, and have alternated between the episodes.  Parker Stevenson and Shaun Cassidy are so believable as brothers, and Pamela Sue Martin makes a great Nancy Drew.  Each episode is enjoyable to watch and very entertaining.  I've always enjoyed the Hardy Boys, including the books while I was growing up, and Disney's The Hardy Boys, starring Tim Considine and Tommy Kirk, was also much loved and very entertaining.  A new version of Nancy Drew is about to be released to the theaters sometime this year, and I hope it inspires the studios to release more seasons of this great TV series.  I've been waiting for additional seasons of other TV shows such as, ""Charlies Angels,"" ""Happy Days,"" ""Laverne & Shirley,""  ""Dynasty,"" ""Fantasy Island,"" and of course, ""Hardy Boys / Nancy Drew Mysteries,"" and decided to contact some of the studios for possible release dates.  The reply I got from two of them was rather disappointing, stating that, ""if the series you're interested in has not had an additional season release after a one year period of time, then it is more than likely that the series will have no future seasons released.""  Let's all continue to e-mail, petition, and do whatever else it takes to get these studio heads to listen to the consumer of these great TV shows.  If you release it, we WILL buy!!

2208754,4,B0007CNY54,"This TV series was produced by and sometimes written and directed by Glen A. Larson. If you're familiar with his name then you'll know exactly what to expect. Actually compared to some of Mr. Larsons' other efforts this series is a step up.

Nothing too ""heavy"" here, just very light and FUN entertainment. Keep in mind that this series was not designed to confound anyone with plot twists or a complex mystery, it's all just light, fun entertainment! The characters are all very likable (something you don't see that often in todays television world) and that's a huge part of the fun. Casting for the characters was perfect!

This is a great time capsule for those who were teenagers in the late 70's and early 80's and it's that age group that will enjoy this series the most! Viewers accustomed to the overly graphic and pathetically bleak CSI (and other modern TV series forged from the same ""grungy"" mold) may find that the innocence contained in the Hardy Boys is lost on them.

This is a great, fun TV series that will bring back many great memories, and hopefully it will generate a few ""new"" memories for those who have not been too jaded by todays television. Let's hope they release the other seasons soon!!!

By the way, I wonder why this series is not listed on the Amazon menu of ""TV series"" along with everything else? Hmmm. a mystery to be investigated!! :)

2208757,2,B0007CNY54,"I remember watching these shows when they first aired, and I remember liking them.  But now, they seem AWFUL!  And it's not because they are dated.  Obviously, everything from that long ago seems dated now, and ordinarily I love the nostalgia of watching older shows.  But in this particular case, it's not the fact that this show is dated that bothers me, but the fact that the show was so poorly produced.  The acting is incredibly bad.  The scripts and music are pretty bad, too, but it's especially the bad acting that made me unable to get through more than just a couple of episodes.

I'm disappointed, because I do have warm, nostalgic feelings toward this show and I really wanted to try to like it while I was watching the episodes on DVD.  But alas, I just couldn't get past the poor production values and so I ended up throwing the DVDs away after just a few episodes.  What a waste of my money!  I will be much more careful in the future when desiring to take a trip down memory lane.  But I did give this 2 stars because of the nostalgia factor.

2208771,3,B0007CNY54,"The Hardy Boys/Nancy Drew Mysteries DVD features 14 episodes in this 2-disc set. Seven Nancy Drew episodes are on one disc, while the seven Hardy Boys episodes are on the other.

I've been a fan of the Nancy Drew books since I was a little girl. In fact, I read them all by the time I hit Junior High. I read a handful of the Hardy Boys books, as well.

When this show hit TV, I wasn't able to watch it clearly. I lived in a rural area, and the station that was airing the episodes was very fuzzy. But I was oh-so-intrigued by the haunting theme song! As a fan of the books, I yearned to be able watch the TV show-and squinted my eyes to try to make out the dialogue and the action.

I was delighted to find the Hardy Boys/Nancy Drew Mysteries on DVD, and purchased it from Amazon.com Surprisingly, I enjoy the Hardy Boys episodes *much* more than the Nancy Drew ones. In fact, the glaring discrepancies between the Nancy Drew books and the TV episodes are downright irritating. For example, in the books, Ned Nickerson is an athletic college student that Nancy dates when he's in town; Ned sometimes joins Nancy and her friends for sleuthing, but isn't in every book. Hannah Gruen, the beloved Drew housekeeper who serves as a mother figure to Nancy, makes an appearance in every book. Bess Marvin and George Fayne are two female cousins who accompany Nancy on her adventures.

Yet, in the episodes on this DVD, Ned is now a shy, serious, bespectacled geek who works for Nancy's attorney father, Carson Drew. With way too much air-time, he's in every episode. Bess Marvin isn't in any episodes (in fact, she's never mentioned)-and fearless tomboy George, who is paired with Nancy (played by Pamela Sue Martin) in every episode-is a girly scaredy-cat. (In the books, Bess is actually the scaredy cat.)  And housekeeper Hannah Gruen? Nowhere to be seen.

The Hardy Boy episodes are a bit more faithful to the original books, with the fearful character Chet Morton making the occasional appearance. Aunt Gertrude, the stern but loving older sister of Fenton Hardy (the father), is also featured. Feeling the need to ""balance"" the Yin/Yang element (I suppose), there is another character added for the TV show: Callie Shaw, a young female assistant to private detective Fenton Hardy.

On the DVD, each episode is 41 minutes long. There are no extras, save for a Parker Stevenson/Shaun Cassidy pin-up from Dynamite! Magazine. (Remember that one, gals?! Gosh, I had a huge crush on Shaun Cassidy, and was so jealous when my childhood friend got his lunch box AND album.) Another irritation is that the Hardy Boys DVD includes trashy previous of Miami Vice and other shows; I have to usher my 6 year old son out of the room or tell him to close his eyes! Sheesh.

There are some goofs in the episodes, as well. For example, the Hardy boys will be driving a van at night, but then the camera pans to a scene of them driving in broad daylight...then back to a night shot! In the Secret of the Jade Kwan Yin, one close-up focuses on a jade statuette. In another close-up, the statue looks completely different...as if it were made of plastic. In Wipe-Out, the boys go undercover and cleverly hide jewelry in an ice tray. One shot shows the jewelry encased in ice, while another one (a few seconds later) shows them dumping a mass of dry jewelry out of a completely dry ice tray. Still, I was utterly delighted with most of the episodes, especially the Pilot and The House With the Disappearing Floors.

Here are the 14 episodes and a short synopsis:

HARDY BOYS

Disc 1 Side A

1. The Mystery of the Haunted House (Pilot) - In this pilot episode, Joe and Frank Hardy (played by Shaun Cassidy and Parker Stevenson) find themselves involved with an amnesiac ex-soldier and the many people who are out to get him. The chase takes them to a club called The Haunted House, where they find mazes, mirrored rooms, trapdoors-and a killer.

2. The Mystery of Witches' Hollow - When the brothers travel to visit a family friend, a strange woman claims the man has disappeared and is the latest victim of the mysterious forest known as Witches' Hollow. The brothers are in for the fright of their lives as they try to rescue the man from the eerie shadows of a place said to be haunted.

3. The Disappearing Floor - This sci-fi adventure finds the boys doing research work for their P.I. father, which leads them into a case involving a mystifying house, a missing Russian scientist and a UFO. Even in another dimension, Joe and Frank must crack the case-or else.

4. The Flickering Torch Mystery - While doing routine investigation for their detective father, Joe and Frank uncover a part to murder a famous pop star. When the singer's sound engineer suddenly disappears, the young detectives become body guards in a race against the clock to save two lives. (Ricky Nelson guest stars as Tony Eagle)

Disc 2 Side B

5. The Mystery of the Flying Courier - Joe's singing debut hits a sour note when Frank recognizes a girl at the club who's been missing for years. What begins as a record piracy case leads a motley crew of shady music industry personalities-and maybe even murder.

6. Wipe-Out - When the brothers hit the beaches of Hawaii for a surfing contest, they find themselves victims in an outbreak of hotel robberies. The two join forces with local police and everyone's in for a surprise when the duo finally uncovers the truth. (Shaun Cassidy sings ""Surfin' USA"" in this episode)

7. The Secret of the Jade Kwan Yin - While snorkeling, Frank and Joe discover a wooden box containing a priceless-and stolen-Chinese treasure. What starts out as just another day at the beach leads into a dangerous smuggling ring where their lives are on the line.

NANCY DREW

Disc 1 Side A

8. The Mystery of Pirate's Cove (Pilot) - In the pilot episode, Nancy investigates a mysterious beam of light coming from a supposedly haunted lighthouse. When a ""ghost hunter"" and a curious professor try to stop her clue gathering, it's up to Nancy to throw a little light on the crime surrounding the desolate place.

9. The Mystery of the Diamond Triangle - Nancy witnesses an accident from a sail plane that ends with a car plunging into a ravine, but when she reports the tragedy to the sheriff, no one believes her since there's no evidence and the road has been closed for years. Nancy investigates, driven to find the secret to the missing accident scene.

10.  The Secret of the Whispering Walls - Terror strikes close to home when a thief steals important documents from Nancy's aging aunts. But when does some sleuthing, a series of strange events-and even stranger neighbors-reveal that there may be even more danger lurking around the corner.

11.  A Haunting We Will Go - The stage is set for mystery when Nancy and her friends decide to launch a 20 year old play for charity at the allegedly haunted Palace Theatre. Surprisingly,  all the original cast members volunteer for the production, but when tragedy strikes backstage, it's up to Nancy to read between the lines.

Disc 2 Side B

12.  Mystery of the Fallen Angels - A case of missing jewels leads Nancy to a rebellious biker gang. In order to crack this case, she's going to have to go undercover for the ride of her life. (Guest stars Jamie Lee Curtis and Robert Englund a.k.a. Freddy Krueger)

13. A luxury cruise gets turbulent when a world-famous mystery writer and his daughter are attacked on-board. With trouble mounting on the high seas, it's up to Nancy and George to stay one step ahead of the mystery assailant.

14. Mystery of the Sold Gold Kicker - There's danger on the playing field when a start quarterback (guest star Mark Harmon) is accused of murder. Now Nancy must kick-off an investigation of the crime before Chip is benched for good.

Too bad this DVD set doesn't include interviews with Shaun Cassidy, Parker Stevenson, and Pamela Sue Martin-or, at least, a documentary about the amazing popularity of the Hardy Boys and Nancy Drew mystery books.

If the Nancy Drew episodes were as good as the Hardy Boys, I'd give this DVD series 4 stars. But with the cheesy acting of the Nancy Drew episodes and departure from the book characterizations-as well as the lack of extras-I must award this DVD series only 3 stars.",1118880000,88,8274,4.64770390678547
2208772,5,B0007CNY54,"I really get a kick from these reviewers who say ""this is so dated"", duh! These were produced in the seventies. What did you expect, Frank and Joe cruisin Bayport in a new BMW? Gimme a break. This is pure kitsch. And I cannot wait to introduce my son to these clean, wholesome stories.",1118880000,9,285,4.296296296296297
2208773,5,B0007CNY54,"What a wonderful dvd collection to own.  I watched this when I was a kid and now my 10 year old daughter has watched it.  She loved it and wants to see the second season.  It was so refreshing to see a show that doesn't use violence, language, and poor manners.  This show reminds me of a time when kids and adults were polite and used manners.  Buy this collections, it is wonderful.",1117670400,6,384,4.205479452054795
2208774,5,B0007CNY54,"I thouroughly enjoyed watching these Hardy Boys / Nancy Drew Mysteries again!!  I was always a huge fan of the Hardy Boys, (and even more so of Shaun Cassidy) back when the series first ran.  It brought back great memories!!  I only hope that Seasons 2 and 3 are not far behind!!  I do hope that Universal will make every attempt to have commentaries added to the future sets.  It would be great fun to hear the rapport between Parker and Shaun, and hear what little tidbits they could reveal from the set.  I also think it would be nice to have something of a ""blooper"" or gag reel. And lastly, how about a bonus CD of Shaun's 1st or 2nd album release??  I would love to hear those songs again. Are you listening, Universal?  I can hardly wait to see what you bring us next!!",1117411200,4,776,4.267123287671233
2208775,1,B0007CNY54,"I was so excited when I found out about this DVD.  I couldn't wait to get it home and watch it.  So far, I have been unable to watch two of the Hardy Boys episodes all the way through because the DVD is defective.  The disc gets stuck on a frame and shuts off.  I can't return it, so I guess I'll keep trying to watch the episodes that play.",1115078400,7,341,3.8285714285714287
2208776,5,B0007CNY54,"Yay Universal! This set was a real surprise to me! Gosh,I don't think I've seen this for 25 years. I remember this show vaguely and this set brings this show back in all it's glory! Bring on the rest!",1115078400,6,200,4.153846153846154
2208777,4,B0007CNY54,"This was my favorite show the entire time it was on.  Unfortunately, because it was on Sunday evenings, it was too often pre-empted by sports.  I'm beyond thrilled to have it on DVD.  The picture quality is beautiful and the sound quality is incredibly clean.  The actors were better than some of the scripts.

I have a soft spot for the episode with Rick Nelson -- one of Shaun Cassidy's own music heroes.  Cassidy is an often overlooked teen idol.  Probably because he doesn't buy in to the teen idol nostalgia drek put out by VH1.  He has become an important go-to guy in Hollywood.  He's an incredible writer (American Gothic, Roar) and a director (Cover Me), and producer (Cold Case, The Mountain, The Agency).

Parker Stevenson was once married to Kirsty Alley.  He did a lot of tv shows -- some big names like Melrose Place, North and South, Judging Amy, Baywatch Nights.  He's more talented than his body of work seems to indicate.

Pamela Sue Martin was the stereotypical, notorious Fallon Carrington in the first few seasons of Dynasty.  Very talented but mostly under the radar since then.

Universal, hurry and get seasons 2 and 3 out!",1114214400,10,1147,4.693467336683417
2208778,5,B0007CNY54,"Coming across this on amazon.com was a great find!!!I missed a lot of episodes when I was younger.  It's great to be able to watch the entire first season.  Hopefully, the second and third season will be released on DVD soon!  Any ""extras"" that can be added would also be a bonus.",1113782400,7,280,4.346153846153846
2208779,5,B0007CNY54,"I'm SO glad the first season of Nancy Drew & the Hardy Boys has been released on DVD, and I have really enjoyed watching the episodes.  I think most women who are now in their 40's, were in love with either Parker Stevenson or Shaun Cassidy and for me it was Parker (sigh).  In the 70's I wasn't into Nancy Drew so much, but now that I am older I am really liking the episodes a lot.  It's great to have a set that is so nicely packaged.  There are 14 episodes all together, on two two-sided DVD's that are separated into one DVD for each Nancy and the Hardy Boys.  They have also been nicely restored.  I have a couple of the HB videos that I bought a while back and I was startled at the difference in quality.  There aren't extra features on the DVD's which I hope will come with future seasons.  They do include a Hardy Boys poster, a copy of an original one from the 70's, which is really neat.  Living in Canada with only 2 channels, I was not able to get all the episodes as a teen, so I am really looking forward to being able to watch all of them.  I'm just 'dying' for the 2nd and 3rd seasons to be released.  The 2nd season combined Nancy & the HB for a number of episodes and had just the Hardy Boys for the 3rd season, I guess as that was who all us girls wanted to see!  They did afterall, have tons of sex appeal.

There are some really good episodes in the first season and Shaun Cassidy made his singing debut.  I enjoyed George O'Hanlon Jr.'s portrayal as Ned Nickerson, Nancy Drew's friend, and am sorry he didn't continue in the part after the first season.  He also did not appear in the last episode of the first season.  The character appeared one more time in the 2nd season, but it was played by rock idol Rick Springfield.  The beautiful Pamela Sue Martin also did an excellent job in her portrayal of Nancy Drew.  Anyway, this first season is a really good presentation of an excellent series and I would certainly recommend it.  It sure brings back wonderful memories that cannot be replaced.",1113609600,11,2020,4.2408376963350785
2208780,4,B0007CNY54,"Being a big fan of the books, shows, and especially Parker Stevenson when I was in junior high, I was elated to see them out on DVD so I could share them with our three kids.  But what's up with the violent and TOO sexy previews from other 70's shows like Miami Vice (including a close-up of a woman's almost bare bikini/thong clad bottom) that I could not skip AND definately did not want my kids to watch.  Come on, Universal. Let's clean it up for our kids, please!",1112572800,13,468,4.247191011235955
2208781,5,B0007CNY54,Universal have outdone themselves releasing this high quality series on dvd. Picture and sound quality look like it was shot yesterday. Please release seasons 2 and 3.,1112572800,9,167,5.222222222222222
2208782,4,B0007CNY54,"I was very happy to see Season One of these great 70s series finally released on DVD.

Although I'm primarily a Hardy Boys fan, seeing the Nancy Drew shows was a nostalgic blast from the past.

It's great to see Shaun Cassidy and Parker Stevenson portraying the famous boy detective duo in these pristine, uncut versions of the show.

The only reason I didn't give 5 stars is due to the lack of ""bonus"" extras. Hopefully if seasons 2 & 3 are in the works, bonus background extras will be added.",1112486400,9,494,4.406593406593407
2208783,4,B0007CNY54,"These DVDs aren't just for people on a nostalgia kick.  I wasn't even around when the series first aired, but as a fan of the books, I couldn't help but love the show.  The only reason I'm not giving this set 5 stars is the lack of extras.  Would've loved to hear cast commentary or maybe watched a few bloopers.  This is a short season, only 14 episodes long.  Hopefully Seasons 2 and 3 will come out soon.",1112140800,10,407,4.166666666666667
2208784,5,B0007CNY54,"Back when TV was fun (ie the 1970s) came this little show that has, over the years, developed a considerable following. Before Murder, She Wrote, there was Nancy Drew...and she certainly made a lasting imperssion on me. As portrayed by the delightful Pamela Sue Martin, this Nancy has spunk, sass, a sense of humor and a whole ot of charisma; she was, and always will be, the epitome of what Nancy was all about. Despite the popularity of the Hardy Boys at the time, the Nancy Drew episodes retained more entertainment value over the years, with sharper storylines and a genuine sense of mystery (no UFO's for Nancy!).

That said, this box set is a must have for nostalgia fans, mystery buffs, and fans of 1970s television. Even the Hardy Boys remain fun to watch; watching Shaun Cassidy belt out the ""Do Ron Ron"" is a cheesy delight. The only downside? Universal neglected to add any extras to this set, aside from a cool mini-poster of the Hardy Boys (sadly, no poster of nancy Drew). It would have been cool to hear from the stars and hear their stories from this entertaining, enjoyable slice of 1970s heaven.",1112140800,13,1113,4.649746192893401
2208785,5,B0007CNY54,"First, I'd like to thank Universal Home Video for releasing the Hardy Boys/Nancy Drew Mysteries on DVD. I was also very surprised to see it come out on DVD. Definitely worth the wait.

I'm more a fan of Nancy Drew, but also like the Hardy Boys. I first bought all the Nancy Drew episodes on tape through Amazon and watched them over and over again, surprised by how good they were. The show had a great cast and the episodes were well written. Pamela Sue Martin was perfect as Nancy, and I really liked George O'Hanlon as Ned, Jean Rasey as George(and didn't like it when another actress took over the part later on), and of course, William Schallert as Carson Drew. Shaun Cassidy and Parker Stevenson are fabulous as the detective brothers. I'm a big fan of '70s cinema and TV and pop culture, and this show along with the Hardy Boys has always been one of my favorites.

It's good to see both shows restored and uncut, and the packaging is nice and colorful. I was hoping for some bonus features, like perhaps commentary by cast and crew for both shows. It would've been nice to hear from Glen Larson especially, a great man behind so many terrific 70s/80s TV shows.

So if you're a fan of these shows, or of '70s pop culture like I am, this is highly recommended.",1111968000,14,1266,4.424892703862661
2208786,5,B0007CNY54,"This DVD Set is absolutley delightful.  I was a big fan back in 1977 when I was 15 years old.  I was madly in crush with Parker Stevenson!  I thought I would get it for nostalgia sake but found myself really enjoying the stories.  They are great little mysteries and relaxing to watch.  Exciting but not too violent, just perfect for a rainy saturday afternoon.  If you are an early 40 something this is a definite must have.  It will make you smile and feel young again.",1111795200,11,471,4.344827586206897

I don't even care if this is considered by some to be ""dated"" now - and I can't believe it's been nearly 30 years!  I was at that perfect age when this show was on to get all giggly every time Shaun Cassidy was on.  Even now I still remember some scenes from favorite episodes.  Can't wait to re-watch these and if you've never seen them think of the show as a kids version of Starsky and Hutch with ocassional singing.  Studio's if you're out there and listening to us we do want more seasons and I'd love to see some special features in future season releases.
