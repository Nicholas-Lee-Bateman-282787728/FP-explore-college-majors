8330045,5,B001OAMUTE,"KISS. I WAS AROUND AND LOOKING FOR A UNIQUE SOUND IN THE 70S. SAW EM FIRST IN CREEM MAGAZINES NEW BANDS - THEY LOOKED UNIQUE. THEN THE VINYL WAS GREAT AND THEN IN CONCERT,THEY WERE OPENING FOR ZZTOP!  THEY ROCKED THE CAPITAL CENTER AND MY WORLD THAT NIGHT. AFTER THEIR SET, LIGHTS UP TO PREP STAGE FOR ZZ TOP,  I NOTICED THE CENTER WAS RAPIDLY CLEARING OUT. WAS THERE A HOT DOG/ SODA SALE?  WHABAM! IT HIT ME
 1/2 PEOPLE THERE HAD COME TO SEE KISS AND NOT ZZ TOP SO THEY WERE LEAVING!  AT THAT MOMENT KISS BECAME MY IDOLS AND MY LIFE CHANGED FOREVER, FOR THE GOOD. I SILL CONSIDER KISS TO BE GODS AND EVEN THOUGH I HAVE NO IDEA WHAT KISSOLOGY B IS AND WHY.ITS GOT 12 DISKS AND IS $250+  BUT LIKE I SAID B4, IF ITS KISS, IT GETS 5 STARS FROM ME. THANKS FOR READING
 SO WHAT IS THIS KISSOLOGY B? ANYONE?",1326672000,,801,4.0
