He also attracts the attention of a beautiful and wealthy young woman. This silent movie is filmed in classic black and white with a jazzy/funky soundtrack that adds amusementa unique, contemporary film. It is similar to Chaplins The Kid, but even without The Kids pathos and Chaplins artistry, it is still well worth watching.",1512000000,,493,4.811764705882353
7921459,4,B00004RWWH,"I managed to see this film on PBS over 20 years ago. I can assess it's quality by the fact that it's stayed with me all these years. Although it's derivative of Chaplin's&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Kid/dp/B0010WF6K6/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Kid</a>, Charles Lane definitely delivers the goods as the film is funny, charming, poignant, imaginative, and socially aware (in this regard it even trumps Chaplin). This is an important film that absolutely needs to be available so audiences can appreciate it. I rate it 4.5 (out of 5).

Will never forget the moment when the little girl offered consolation by patting him on the back.  Add; ""unforgettable"" to that list of descriptive adjectives.",1310601600,,270,5.209302325581396

When you explain that there is no dialogue just music, people are either intrigued or uninterested.  I would love for everyone to see this film so I hope it does come to dvd.  I am waiting......",1152144000,5,368,4.126760563380282
