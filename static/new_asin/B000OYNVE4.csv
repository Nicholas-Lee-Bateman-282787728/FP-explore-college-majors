8494821,5,B000OYNVE4,"I'm a huge fan of What Not To Wear. With the show having gone off the air, I'm now monthly buying on Amazon episodes from the first four seasons that I've never seen (which means the show hasn't ended for me ... woot, woot!)
Anyone reading any WNTW review I do should know:
1) I'm only doing these reviews to give the ep 5 stars; I will give EVERY ep 5 stars as a nod to the general greatness of WNTW. I admit it, I'm biased. (But really, if the knowledge, fun, and drama aren't enough, the brilliance and wit of Stacy and Clinton push every ep to a 5 anyway.)
2) While I don't have time for big writeups on each DVD, a few observations: It was nice to see Maria, who'd already been on WNTW and nominated her sisters, Connie and Diana. C and D were really something, constantly pushing each other's buttons like only sibs can do, but in an overall loving way. I laughed when Stacy delightedly exclaimed that they sounded like cocker spaniels, which was true. But S and C, while infinitely patient with C and D, also weren't afraid to lay down the law when they occasionally went off the rails, which was a very good thing. C and D each seemed to learn a lot and had quite the lovely transformations. This was in no small part because of Nick, who did double duty and should have gotten quadruple the pay for taming their thick and wild 'dos, and Carmindy, who amazes in always knowing the right color or shade, tip or trick.
3) Oh yeah, the cost ... $19.95 per ep? WTF! I'm a big enough fan of the show, and have the resources, to buy them. But do I see anybody else purchasing them? Nope. NEW: I can't get anybody at Amazon to confirm, but I AM coming to the realization that maybe having had to pay for a DVD, label it, and package it, is the reason for the $19.95 figure, when you can download eps on iTunes for $1.99 and seasons for $20 or so (and no packaging). But that said, the price still seems too high, and is why I'm happy to recently have snagged with holiday gift cards a bunch of eps at the temporarily lowered cost of $14.50. Sure hope you keep up what seems like a December tradition.",1452038400,,2101,4.215880893300248
