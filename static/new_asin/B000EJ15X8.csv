8110714,5,B000EJ15X8,"I recently fell in love with the Japanese/Taiwanese thunderbolt fantasy show and was curious to see what else I could find pertaining to pili international multimedia (the company responsible for these amazing puppet dramas). This was one if their early works that fortunately made it to Japan and eventually to the west. It's totally awesome. If you are a fan of Pili or thunderbolt fantasy thus should be a part if your library. If you aren't a fan yet, this is a great place to start.",1472515200,,487,4.674418604651163

8110717,5,B000EJ15X8,"Absolutely fascinating! A ""must see"". You won't see anything like this anywhere. You will throw out all of your Kung-Fu films after you see this. There is also a marvelous special video with it - and - contrary to the review there are English and Chinese subtitles (the dialogue seems to have been in - or dubbed in - Japanese where it was, apparently, originally released. An absolute must for all puppeteers and lovers of film!",1363478400,,429,4.657894736842105
