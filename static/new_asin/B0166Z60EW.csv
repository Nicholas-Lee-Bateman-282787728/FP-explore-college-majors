Maybe that's why the project was finished when it was started. I wish I hadn't seen this show.",1450051200,,266,4.134615384615385

7456617,1,B0166Z60EW,"I have grown up with such films as The Dark Crystal and Labyrinth. I was excited to see a new film by the Jim Henson workshop and I have to say I was extremely let down. The film was playing with the modern idea of mythical creature live hidden among us. However this concept is surrounded by an extremely weak script and terrible acting. The main problem with this film is how un interested the main actors were throughout the film, Mary Steenburgen seemed bored and uninterested and her character was one dimensional. The father and child actors seriously need acting lessons but mainly better lines, when one of the characters uses the term "" conscious uncoupling"" there is a problem. The villains in the film were such hillbilly stereotypes it borders on offensive. The only shining light among this mess was in fact the creatures, which by the way I was disappointed when they were contastly referred to as monsters in the film instead of the usual uniqueness that the Jim Henson brand brings ( hello the dark Crystal). I really hope that they come back to form. The concept deserves re exploration and a serious revision. The Jim Henson name deserves better than this.",1448668800,8,1174,4.703883495145631
7456618,5,B0166Z60EW,"Watched this with my three year old. I can say she sat through the whole movie. I found little hidden jokes for adults and jokes she understood. Plus, the monsters are so ugly they're cute! Can't wait to purchase the dvd.",1448150400,4,221,4.414634146341464
7456619,5,B0166Z60EW,Great family holiday movie and I love those musical monsters. Thank you Jim Henson for your vision and legacy.,1447718400,6,110,4.842105263157895
7456620,5,B0166Z60EW,"I think I expected to say, ""it's a great movie for a ___________"" with the blank being filled with one of so many things, considering it's a Lifetime movie, a ""family film,"" a puppet movie, a movie with kids, a holiday film, etc. etc.  I initially was interested mostly just to see what the deal is with these creatures.  Instead, what I discovered was a great movie, not ""for a _____"" but just an overall fun viewing experience.

It's as if every happy moment of my childhood existed within this very film... if only they sold plush versions of the monsters, I'd be ordering one of each so I could hug them myself!  Although I'm well aware that there is a new Muppet tv show airing and it's always good to have them back on tv, THIS is what makes it feel like Jim is still alive and well.  Is it too soon to hope Lifetime is going to soon announce plans for a sequel?",1447459200,15,868,4.236363636363636
7456621,4,B0166Z60EW,"Very Enjoyable Holiday movie. Definitely worth watching if you enjoy Disney like holiday movies, like Halloween town series.",1500595200,,124,5.944444444444445

7456623,1,B0166Z60EW,"Well that was disappointing! A super clunky script and really stiff acting made for two crippling blows to a movie that really should not have the Henson name attached to it at all.  Except that the ""Musical Monsters of Turkey Hollow"" was a story that Jim Henson wrote himself and wanted to bring to film. He wrote a treatment, and even did some initial puppet making and photography for it. If you are curious about his original idea for the film, RUN away from this movie, and purchase instead the graphic novel adaptation by Roger Langridge published by Archaia and/or Boom Studios. The cartoonist was given access to Jim Henson's original story and notes and attempted to create the most faithful adaptation possible. It really is delightful and worth your time. Unlike this film.

The best part about this movie is the puppets themselves, which is fitting in a Henson film, but in this case, the puppets are too little too late after the human characters and awkward script drag down the story at every turn. Again, the book ""The Musical Monsters of Turkey Hollow"" by Roger Langridge is a really wonderful story that truly earns the Henson name attached to it, and is worth looking into if you are a Jim Henson fan at all. My only hope is that since this adaptation was SO BAD and ""made for TV"", MAYBE we will get a feature film in the future that lives up to Jim's original ideas. Fingers crossed!

7456637,3,B0166Z60EW,"Jim Henson's Turkey Hollow is an originally made for TV movie (by Lifetime) from 2015.  It's a young child friendly mild adventure/thriller.  From the DVD cover image I thought it might be a bit more of a horror or scary vibe to it, but it's neither of those things.  Basically the plot has a brother and sister being taken by their recently divorced father to their great aunt's house who they haven't seen, well ever, the last time she saw them the oldest was a baby.  She lives near a small remote town in the woods, the town's claim to fame and tourism draw card is a bigfoot style statue and gift shop, where the retailer tells visitors the creature known as Howling Hoodoo roams the woods.  The younger brother is of course fascinated by this first interesting thing about this town (whose Wi-fi does the opposite to makes sense thing and cuts out when you pass the welcome to the town sign) and of course believes it to be real.  The sister is still as bored and upon meeting their aunt, isn't any more thrilled to be there, especially when her house doesn't have fancy things like radio, television or meat.

Like all kids films the young boy of course ignores the rule of not venturing into the woods.  He wants to find the Howling Hoodoo, but instead leaves the gate open at a neighbouring turkey farm.  The owner demands justice for his loss of $10 000 worth of birds, kids movie style the local government has a law that if you owe someone money and don't pay it in 36 hours or something, they get to take your house. The Aunt has been pestering her neighbour about his turkey farm practices for decades and he's eager for this opportunity for vengeance and to get rid of her as a neighbour.  Even though the boy's father is in the room at the same time the policeman brought him home, for some bizarre reason that is never explained the aunt's house is the one at risk and not his. The father and Aunt don't have the cash.  Finding a reward of $10 000 for a photo of Howling Hoodoo advertisement in an old newspaper, the boy sneaks out to find and photograph the creature.  His sister sees him sneak out and follows him into the woods.

The movie is watchable and the puppets are well done, and easily wouldn't have been out of place on The Muppets or Fraggle Rock.  They are more realistic in the fact they aren't brightly coloured like the ones on those shows so would be fairly camouflaged and not seen by the public.  The story is very simple though and could have offered a bit more for adult viewers watching it with their kids.  There is an odd sub story of the cop making sexual references by mistake to the aunt as he clearly is secretly interested in her.  But that's really it for adults, and it doesn't really go anywhere other than being constant slips of the tongue, plus you're wondering why he sees in the elderly woman in that way.  There's also aspects such as a car chasing people on foot who keep running further down the road instead of where the car can't follow.  For some reason  this movie has an on screen narrator who appears every now and then, unless he's famous from some kids show I've never heard of, I didn't see the point to his appearances, as they just interrupted the movie.  The film would have better without them.  As it would the long fade to black moments where obviously the TV commercials appeared when this was on TV.",1482883200,,3375,4.409677419354839

Thought about rating as 1 star, since the whole family found it bad, but we finished watching it, so I guess that's worth a 2.",1481760000,,389,4.27027027027027
