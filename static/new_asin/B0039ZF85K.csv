4099640,3,B0039ZF85K,"The title of this DVD I believe is a little bit misleading. Jackie - as far as I can tell IS NOT one of the kids.  Although the kid's movies were entertaining, I was expecting to see more movie features with Jackie actually in them.  Only the ""Killer Meteors"" has Jackie doing any acting.  The ""Jackie Chan Invincible Fighter"" is more like one big commercial.  That particular promo was quickly made after Bruce Lee's untimely death, and seems more like an attempt by the Chinese film industry to divert people's attention elsewhere. IF YOU BUY THIS ONE, DO NOT BUY ""Jackie Chan Superstar Edition"" because you'll get the same 4 films.  That detail is not clear enough on the Amazon selling pages.",1280880000,10,696,4.672131147540983

8392671,2,B0039ZF85K,We were looking for the young dragons movies and found it here but had hoped in purchasing it would have been a better quality picture (picture is very old grainy quality) and offered more options (ie subtitles instead of dubbing but only has dubbed version). Also was initially confused when it arrived with only one disc and couldn't find the movie we were looking for. Finally realized there are movies on both sides of the dvd.,1436227200,,431,4.684210526315789

8392675,5,B0039ZF85K,I really like 4 out of the 8 films that were in here.  It remided me of how funny these Chinese boys were when they were fighting.  I loved it!,1402963200,,143,3.7333333333333334
8392676,3,B0039ZF85K,They were good movies just not exactly the ones that I was looking for. I'm still looking for the other movies of the Kung fu kids.,1395532800,,131,4.076923076923077
8392677,5,B0039ZF85K,Great seller. I got this one mainly for the karate kids portion. Jackie chan had no affiliation with the movie previously and I suspect this package was to capitalize on the Jakie chan karate kid movie (which should have been kung fu kid as it was not Karate used) The movies with the kids in this one are totally seperate from the jackie chan stuff in this set and have no relation to each other. But if you like old imported (poorly dubbed) martial arts movies from the 80's this might be a treat for you.,1374537600,,507,4.291666666666667
8392678,3,B0039ZF85K,"I feel that most people will buy this for the Young Dragons movie (because every other film is relatively easy to find).  The first two Young Dragons movies are amazing, however this is the english version.  It is an older dub, so obviously it sucks, however that is not the main issue.  The main issue is that they changed the music for the english version, and a lot of the tone and atmosphere of the show is lost due to that.

Its still a good movie regardless, just a bit disappointed that there were no chinese option.",1359763200,4,523,4.360824742268041
8392679,5,B0039ZF85K,I made this purchase solely for the movie I remember watching as a kid. I bought it was a gift for myself and my sister.,1358294400,,120,3.84
8392680,1,B0039ZF85K,The disc I received was a poorly-copied bootleg. Most of the videos were such bad copies that they were unwatchable. Waste of money.,1349740800,,132,4.782608695652174
