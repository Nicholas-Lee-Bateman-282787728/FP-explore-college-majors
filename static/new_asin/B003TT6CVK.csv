8497390,5,B003TT6CVK,"These guys have a great show on BlogTalk Radio for beginner internet entrepreneurs.  These guys are so practical and this CD takes you from having a web site dream to a web site reality and it really is unbelievably fast.  I see why Wordpress is the platform of choice and with this CD you can even get (great looking!) multiple sites up and running so quickly.  I'm thinking about taking this CD and just handing it to an assistant so that she can put up sites quickly whenever I get a new online business idea.  Thanks, Jonathan and Russell!",1279929600,,543,4.454545454545454
