8194825,3,6305889260,"This is undoubtedly a movie that I probably saw back in the 70s, yet was largely indistinguishable from countless other kung fu films of its kind.  The plot meanders, sometimes tortuously, leading to several fights largely in the second half of the film.  As you would tell from the name, no animal fist or animal form is on display here, no more than the Northern style or Southern style.  The musical score are those outtake fragments that have been retread in so many other kung fu films of that day.  The film suffers from a dearth of recognizeable faces--- even recognizeable dub voice talent.  There's the more than average comedic tone throughout much of the movie, that slightly goofy comedy with bumpkins speaking in either wallowing voices or shrill whiney voices.  You know the voices I'm talking about.  This is one of those films in which two guys are fighting in a house, they both jump out a window, and magically, they're now fighting in some wide open grassy field.  This is one of the few movies I can recall that the villian, in the end, was not killed, but simply ""subdued.""  As I think back to the days when I saw movies like this in theatres in the 70s, this would undoubtedly be a ""third"" movie on a triple bill--- the kind of movie you would sit through ambivalently throughout the movie, maybe get some popcorn, stretch your legs, not care if you're missing a fight or two, pretty much eagerly awaiting the ""marquee"" film of the triple feature that you sat through three movies to see a second time.  I rate the movie a 3 on entertainment value, and a 4 on nostalgia.",974073600,2,1592,4.554385964912281
