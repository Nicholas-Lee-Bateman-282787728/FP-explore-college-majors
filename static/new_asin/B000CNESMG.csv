2466339,5,B000CNESMG,"A great movie, really cool and of course it includes two extra episodes of Zoey 101. The ending was a shame and you wish it didn't end like that but hey, still an awesome move! Highly recommended.",1144713600,8,196,4.324324324324325

  This was one of the best movies ever. If you are a fan of the show, you would love this movie. If you have ever watched the show, you should know that Chase loves Zoey, but will never admit it to Zoey, although everyone else knows it-except Zoey.

Summary: (If you haven't seen the movie, and want to see it, skip all this below until the /\/\/\/\/\'s. This part is for people who haven't seen it, but want to know about it.)

  Logan takes the gang on a trip to his ""Summer-House,"" which turns out to be a very fancy place. Logan's Dad is using the gang as a 'Test Run' for his new TV show, Gender Defenders. In addition, as a thanks for them trying out his show, he gives them all a PDA called a 'TekMate.' Michael keeps trying to convinse Chase to tell Zoey that Chase loves her. Chase sends a text message saying these exact words: ""For the billionth time, no. If I tell Zoey I love her, it could ruin our friendship."" Although, he soon finds out, he sent this message to Zoey by mistake, and he goes crazy. He steals her PDA and deletes the message, although he couldn't put it back. The girls find out he took it, and think he cheated. Zoey thinks hid did try to cheat and says she'll believe him if he tells her why he took her TekMate. Chase still won't say he loves her though.

  They are soon at the end of the 2nd Event, and there is a tie. The tie-breaker is a baton battle on pillars on a pool. The object is to knock the other person into the water, and the first person to get knocked in 2 times loses. Zoey and Chase are the fighters. Zoey is knocked in, then Chase is knocked in. But Chase knocks away Zoey's baton, and takes a fall for Zoey.

  Logan's dad tells them that instead of just a Test-Run, the whole thing was taped by hidden camera, and will be shown on National TV. Chase doesn't come though. Zoey goes to find Chase, and he is on the side of a big water fountain. Zoey asked again why he took her TekMate, and he says that he sent a message to her by mistake, and had to delete it, but that she ran off before he could put it back. She asked what the message was, and Chase ALMOST tells her, but they are pulled away to watch the TV show. During the show, Chase sends this message: ""The message was... I LOVE YOU."" Most would assume he wouldn't send it, but he indeed did send it. Sadly, Zoey's TekMate fell out of her pocket, and was lying on the side of the fountain. When the message popped up, the TekMate vibrated, and fell into the fountain.

  I loved the movie, and got so sad when the TekMate fell into the fountain. What a Great way to end a movie! I was just hoping the movie would have lasted longer... It was only an Hour long. ='(

My Rating:

Excitement: 8.3/10.0

Good Drama: 7.9/10.0

Sad Moments: 10.0/10.0

Overall: 10.0/10.0",1142640000,16,2840,4.269158878504673
2466341,5,B000CNESMG,"Too many of you crying like a baby over the end. I was expecting nothing less. That is tv. That is good TV, they keep the suspsense. If he told her, and she liked him that would end. Trust me. The writers know what they are doing. They don't get together just yet but toward the end of the season or the end of the series they will. They do that. Look at rfr, on the Degrassi channel's, WB shows. So don't get ur underwear in a wad. I loved it. It was rather short, and I have a lot of opinions on this movie but yes.
To the loser who wrote:

Cast of no talent actors. Not true, all very good, Sean Flynn, last name Flynn so I am sure he has the talent. Yes, a ladies man like his grandfather possibly, he is very cute yes but I am sure he has the talent in his blood, and his father is a producer and mother is what? Trust me, sure there's practice I believe(me and my sis played golf, and my grandparents are good at it, although that is a later/older set for them but same thing here.)

Poorly written scripts. Um no. Normal

In other words, a worthless show from the Nick Kids channel. No, well if you over 20 then maybe to you yes but they do a kids show so it is. It is a fine teen show. TEEN, I hate the damn morons who say preteen for TEENS, get it in your head! Teen is 13 so especially high school students et are TEENS. 12 is not 13. OKAY. Under 12 is preteen, 13 is TEEN. I am no longer a teen but god it bugs me.

Is it full screen? Send me a message. Cuz the second showing is widescreen. I think the ratio is full screen though.",1142294400,2,1543,3.888888888888889

2466370,5,B000CNESMG,My kids and I love Zoey.  It is to bad it isn't on anymore.  Their grandfather likes it too too.,1358035200,,96,3.75
2466371,5,B000CNESMG,I bought this for my daughter because she started watching Zoey 101 again on television. This seemed like the best bet because it was more reasonable than buying a whole season. It has the Spring Break-up special and 2 other episodes. She really likes it and pulls it out whenever she wants to watch something up-beat!!,1304467200,,319,4.714285714285714

2466374,3,B000CNESMG,"This dvd is o.k., but they should really have the complete first and second season out! And another thing, I'm soooooo glad they got rid of Dana Cruz! Dana was a real bitch! Even when Dustin was sick and asked for her help, she closed the door on him! Thank god they replaced her with Lola Martinez!!! Lola is much sweeter than Dana will ever be! Also, I hope Nicole comes back from that all girls school! (For those of you who don't know, Nicole was sent to an all girls school because of how much she thought about cute boys!) Nicole Bristow was my favorite character! She was always so cute and happy! Even when she said something stupid, it sounded so cute! Anyway, this dvd is o.k., but I'd still say they should come out with seasons one and two! What's the point of buying only half the episodes?!?",1161043200,2,805,4.337748344370861
2466375,3,B000CNESMG,"I don't know...maybe bcz its 4 kids.
There r many momments that prove that its not real and something reminds u every minute""Hello! They are acting"" and every time u try 2 believe that its really happening...something has 2 ruin it!

1. When Zoey was sitting beside the fountain with chase..her friends came and destroyed their momment..ok..but I rewinded it..I saw that when she left, her tekmate was with her, but then i don't know how it got 2 be on the fountain.
2. When Dustin was in the sea pretending that his bathing suit was taken away by a wave, it really shows that he is wearing black shorts!
3. How could Dustin eat the fish in the sea when the fish fell in the sea, he ate it with nothing in his hands!
4. When they were bathing in the sea..and got out, their hair was dry, their clothes were dry 2, and its like they never bathed in the sea!

Why is it called a movie when its not! This is a T.V series!
When the 1st episode ended and the tekmate fell into the fountain and it ended i thought that it was the worst movie i've ever seen, but then i don't know why i just seeked forward and discovered that there r more episodes!
 Believe me its so lame!
Maybe Jamie Spears is ok, she should act in movies, bcz this  not good enough 4 her, she  deserves better than acting inthis!",1153612800,3,1293,4.19758064516129
