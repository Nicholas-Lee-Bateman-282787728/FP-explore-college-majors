8747949,5,B00VR9C22M,"This is seriously one of the best and most memorable anime series I've seen in a long time. The animation quality is way above average, the soundtrack is legendary, and the characters are phenomenal. The plot can be a bit slow at times, but overall, it was very well done. If you're looking for a good anime to watch, you should definitely check out Yuki Yuna.

This collector's set is very pretty, but for the price that they're charging, I kind of wish they included some more stuff in it.",1450915200,4,491,4.455555555555556
