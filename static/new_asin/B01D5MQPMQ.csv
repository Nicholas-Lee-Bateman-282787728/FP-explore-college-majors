7697835,5,B01D5MQPMQ,Loved this anime since I stumbled across it after I watched Arslan. I bought it the day they allowed me to preorder it. Son Hak rocks as well as the other companions in Yona's group but I hope that there will be another season for me to buy because I would like to see most of Miss Lili and her bodyguards in color and to see Hak with all his bloodlust reaching for Soowon in HD greatness. I already bought the second half preorder hope they have the ova as well included in that box set.,1465257600,5,488,4.09375
7697836,5,B01D5MQPMQ,Love the this Anime!!!  I have the original with episodes 1-26.  I pray they continue the series!  They had to leave it on a cliff hanger ugh!!!  I'm really looking forward to see how the actual battle goes!!!  Won't give anymore details but I highly recommend this anime!!!  Loved it!!!!,1461715200,7,288,4.66
7697837,4,B01D5MQPMQ,"Yona lives a charmed life - only daughter of a gentle king in a prosperous land, she is surrounded by love and luxury. However, everything is lost when her beloved cousin leads a coupd'etat and she is forced to flee her home. Hunted, she begins a journey to find the four dragons and take back her throne.

I had great expectations for this series that were both let down and met. I had been hoping for a political thriller where a spoiled princess learns some lessons and events that were taken for granted turned out to have more meaning than expected. Well, Yona certainly learns to overcome her spoiled nature and the bad guy turns out to be a pretty darn good king, despite his dubious acquisition of the throne. On the other hand, Yona starts building a haram (not her intention, but still). This series was an odd mix of interesting storytelling and standard fantasy fare. Fortunately, while the average elements are fairly average, they aren't bad. Sure, Yona has a bunch of powerful, hot guys who would die to protect her, but at least the series tries to justify it, both through some lore and by allowing Yona to develop as a character.

The most interesting character is actually Soo-won (the usurper), though Yona gets the best character development. The other characters aren't terribly complex, but they are fun and easy to like.

Sadly, the anime only covers part of the manga series, so some of the best set up (relating to Soo-won), is never followed up on. The show ends with the last dragon being introduced, so you never get to see how Yona ended up at the border like she does in an early intro scene. I haven't found anything relating to a second season, so I think we are out of luck there. The manga of course is still running, now at 20 volumes.

This set only contains the first half of the series (1-12 out of 24). At the time of this review, the second set is due out 7/19/2016.",1461196800,11,1907,4.502890173410405

7697843,5,B01D5MQPMQ,I loved this anime But I don't want to buy the first season if they don't even come out with a second. The first season left of with a new character and I want to continue watching. Once they announce a second season I will defiantly buy the blue-ray!,1487289600,,251,4.142857142857143
7697844,5,B01D5MQPMQ,This is a wonderful anime and is one of my favorites that I keep watching. The characters and plot are terrific. My only concern is the actress they got for Yona in the dub has an annoying squeaky voice (not true to the character at all) compared to the actress that did the original subtitled Japanese anime version who has a lovely voice. Hak and the dragons sound great though. Hopefully they replace Yona for the next season and they make many many more! This is the one that started me reading manga to see more of the story. More Yona please!,1484352000,4,548,4.382352941176471

7697856,5,B01D5MQPMQ,"This story follows the plight of Princess Yona from her sheltered world after the unexpected death of her father and betrayal from a close friend. Yona flees the castle with her longtime friend, Hak, and thus the two embark on a journey to fulfill an ancient prophecy. Yona blossoms into a steadfastly determined and strong individual, taking up a bow and arrow, and vowing to never succumb to her former helplessness. Never have I seen such intimate and thoughtful character development in a shojo storyline; each character is given proper background and each adds a special quality to Yona's troupe. The art style is also amazing and not to mention, the soundtrack adds even more depth of emotion to Yona of the Dawn. This anime truly deserves more attention (and a second season!).",1466380800,8,784,4.902255639097745

8755067,3,B01D5MQPMQ,"I don't want to say I don't like it but for the price, it wasn't worth the buy in my opinion. Yona the character... i can't STAND her voice as an actor its so annoying I was having a very hard time watching it. She does seem to get less whiny, but barely. The story line has great potential but if they changed her voice actor I think the show would be more bearable. I don't think I will be buying the second season anytime soon which is sad because I love watching stuff like this...",1512691200,,485,4.0625
