2290321,2,B0009GX1XI,"Disappointingly morose for what is supposed to be a soft core (therefore thrilling) movie.  This combination of skin and tears really just didn't work for me.  And the camera work and editing, what a joke.

The first (and only) good striptease scene does get explicit with the nudity - if only they didn't keep intercutting it with every damn thing they could find elsewhere in the room!  Here's some pink ... here's some dudes in the audience watching ... here's some more sexy dancing and a little flash of pink ... here's more people drinking their drinks and watching ... here's some floor show stuff with some more quick pink shots ... here's the bartender looking on disapprovingly ... here's another passing shot of her dancing from behind who knows what obnoxious object silhouetting half the frame ... here's a close-up of some dude nodding and looking lasciviously ... getting the idea?  And what pink there is, you'll never see in a nice close tightly framed shot - it's always from far away with most of the stage and background in there cluttering things up.  Basically, they've gone out of their way to make it as useless as possible.

And that's the best this DVD offers - the rest is all that terrible simulation soft core where you see very little (other than some nudity) and you can clearly tell the action is all fake.  Even the girl-girl scene looks unconvincing (oh and again, they're not too happy to be there).  And lots more intercutting not once, not twice, not three times, but six or seven times on the guy's dumb mug as he watches.  WTF?

And NO, NO, NO, the second striptease does NOT give us the goods.  I counted at least five times that the crotch shots were entirely covered by her gloved hand so we can't see any pink.  She's fully nude, yes, but the way it's filmed is very obstructive which defeats the whole point of showing it at all.  There's a third striptease which is a little like the first (some flashes of pink) but again, what's with constantly having people walking in front of the camera, shooting from behind some dude's head, BS like that?  You can damn well bet that anytime the camera is stage side and she is kneeling with her legs apart, the camera sure won't capture anything below the waist.  Fourth striptease, again with two or three very brief and distant pink shots which cut to CLOSE-UPS of the dude's face (plus more of the dude's face after every other cut of her doing anything which you barely see through all the people between her and the camera).  Fifth striptease with the two girls, no pink and (I counted) thirteen cuts back to the guy's face!!  Why, oh why?",1421798400,,2630,4.571428571428571

2290326,2,B0009GX1XI,"I never thought I'd ever see a softcore film to make ""Showgirls"" look like a four-star film by comparison. If you care far more about explicit nudity and simulated sex scenes than you do about a believable story, realistic dialogue and accuracy then by all means ignore this review and buy this movie, because you will love it. OTOH, you could just buy a real porno..

Let's start with accuracy. No strip clubs in California (or most states) have ever permitted liquor and bottomless entertainment in the same venue--any strip joint patron knows that. The dressing room is restricted to employees, so no boyfriends, etc. are permitted. And where the hell was the dance pole or the stage tipping? No LA club in the 90s lacked a dance pole and all of them have seating aound the edge of the stage so the guys can get close and throw tips to the dancer. Did the writer ever actually visit a strip club?

Then there was the hackneyed, cringe-inducing dialogue. So many lame cliches all strung together, so much of it unnatural to the ear, and flat-out unbelievable. The dialogue was so bad it's hard to judge the acting because when an actor is trying to sell a poorly-imaged/written line, it becomes impossible to believe it and, thus, does the performance. The lawyer-lawyer dialogue in the court building hallway was the worst; my ears wanted to throw up. It makes sense the dialogue was so bad when the story itself was festooned with so many unrealistic moments--far too many to catalog here--and a cheesy ending to top it off.

I could keep on going but you get the idea. As a screenwriter and a filmmaker I find value in this film in one aspect: if you're going to write an exploitation film, use this film as a reverse template: do the exact opposite of this film when it comes to dialogue and story.",1418774400,,1804,4.596273291925466

2290329,3,B0009GX1XI,"The title suggests that you will see unrated Lap Dancing. Instead it shows mostly Pole Dancing on a stage. There are a couple lap dances but they are not very erotically filmed. There are some well known girls from the film industry but the ""explicit' shots are of the stage pole dances. It could have been a great film if it had more close up sensual lap dances and more lap sitting and grinding as the title suggests. Anyone that buys an erotic film for the story line or the acting probably cry's at chick flicks and buys their girlfriend tampons at the drug store too!",1415750400,,572,4.40566037735849

2290331,3,B0009GX1XI,"There is actually a hint of a plot here as the startries not to be a bitch or a prostitute but fails at both. In the end, she turns into a goody-goody, gives up hooking and probably dancing in about 20 seconds of film time.",1402444800,,223,3.977777777777778

2290333,5,B0009GX1XI,"The plot of this film is similar to the ""A movie"" plot of Demi Moore's STRIPTEASE.  A stripper (Josie Hunter) wants to get custody of her daughter, but the deck is stacked against her due to her occupation as an exotic dancer.  Unlike the bigger budget STRIPTEASE, this flick is WAY hotter and (believe it or not!) a better movie!

Josie Hunter is exquisite.  Like Micah Ashley, she can walk around with her blonde hair casually combed and she's still(!) drop-dead gorgeous.  If you like lots of nudity in your B movie flicks, then you cannot go wrong w/this one.  It is NOT a ""teaser"" flick as every babe in the movie strips down @ one time or another and there's not a homely woman in the bunch!  If nothing else, this flick is not short on eye candy.

One of the most remarkable things about the film is that it actually has a lawyer & a strip club owners who are good(!) guys.  Whoa!!  I didn't think that was possible, but they pulled it off!!  Usually,  lawyers & strip club owners are slimy & sleazy, but that's actually not the case here.  The lawyer is actually a ""knight in shining armor"" type of guy;  the same type of fellow that I've tried to be myself for damsels-in-distress.

If you're not aroused 30 seconds into watching this movie, then you may as well stop watching as the rest of the movie is more of the same.  However, if you're not aroused, then I have to question what your intentions were in buying a movie like this.  Again, while the women may not be going up for an Academy Award for best actress, that's really not the ""point"" here.  It's an enjoyable movie and it's not short on beautiful naked women.  Who could ask for anything more????",1395446400,,1669,4.395424836601308
2290334,1,B0009GX1XI,This is clearly a B flick......but its so bad that it really should be a C.....horrible. Acting was beyond terrible. I realize this isn't a film that will win an oscar. But I ready the other reviews and wanted to see a sexy movie with soft core edges. The edge is there but you cant get past that this girl cries everytime she has sex. It's ahrd for my wife and I to get into it when the actress herself cant. Save your money. Rip off.,1390953600,,435,4.069767441860465
2290335,4,B0009GX1XI,Erotic and sad at the same time a story of a girl who has to face her own obsession in order to gain custody of her child a good movie to watch.,1388016000,,144,3.53125
2290336,4,B0009GX1XI,"Some beautiful women in the usual and expected scenes.  Typical movie about a guy trying to get his girl to go straight and leave the adult industry.  Like most addicts, she can't get help until she crashes.",1377302400,,207,4.5675675675675675

But I have three DVD players and it didn't work in any of them. I'm not going to return it because for seven bucks it's not worth the time. Very dissapointed.",1355184000,,276,3.8596491228070176
2290339,5,B0009GX1XI,"This is relatively good movie with hot actresses.  The lead actress has a hot #10 body, but a not so hot face. Her facial expressions are harsh, but the body circumvents that!",1346025600,,175,4.46875
2290340,2,B0009GX1XI,"This film should be retitled ""The Agony Of Being A Hooker"".  This film takes it's message and theme very seriously.  From beginning to end the script, the acting and the soundtrack all pound the point home about how unhappy everyone is to be a hooker.

The film begins with Erica (Josi Hunter) crying in her bed about how bad her life sucks, and I'm not sure I saw her smile for the rest of the film.  Then we get to watch a series of fairly hot scenes of her living out her profession as a dancer, a lapdancer, and a hooker, in which she consistenly looks miserable and unhappy. (Apparently she serves a niche market of men for whom women who hate sex are a fetish.  Who knew?)  The scenes are good and well shot, but the repeated closeups of Erica-in-anguish get pretty old.  Later, another dancer does a little side work, but she too looks unhappy throughout her scene.

The jazzy soundtrack features jumping hits like ""She's A Victim Of The Night"", and other less memorable titles by the same unknown band, ensuring we know that being a hooker sucks but it's not her fault.

On the plus side, the full-length scenes of the stage performances are pretty good (other than the downer music), and whatever club they are at clearly allows the full Monty.  The highlight of the film for me was a fairly romantic and erotic scene between Jo (Amy Lindsay, billed as Lynsey Ames) and the club's owner.  Sadly, this is the only intimate scene involving Ms. Lindsay in the movie.

The plot has holes you can drive a truck through, even if it is a bit more coherent than other movies of this type.  It's never explained why the parents that drove Erica to a life of dancing and prostitution have custody of her daughter, and Erica is living pretty posh for supposedly scraping by (and obviously had the money for recent implants, as evidenced in several scenes that Ms. Hunter appears in.  Makeup, please?).  The ending is trite and difficult to believe.  Also never explained is how Erica has managed to avoid the normal self-destructive routes of alcohol and drugs in her descent into misery, but maybe I'm thinking about it too much.  Which is basically the problem with this film...I found my mind wandering around the set while the cast was still working, because who wants to watch someone being miserable?

Two stars for a good try, but really bad acting and a hamfisted message delivery hold it back.  If she would just have smiled now and then I'd might have given another star...",1323648000,,2481,4.585034013605442
2290341,1,B0009GX1XI,"I ordered this title from amazon.com, when it arrived from Clover Media, I first tried to play it on a new Sony DVD player I bought at amazon.com, and it would only play about 4 or 5 minutes before it froze. I tried fast forward and skip, and that was futile. I just watched another new DVD that evening. In a few days, I tried it on my new all-region Panasonic player from amazon.com. It played about 16 minutes before it froze. I have two more Sony DVD players from Sears and Wal-Mart, and it did the same on them. I wasn't sure how to return it, so I sent Clover Media an e-mail asking about it. They didn't reply but just complained about me. That's grossly unfair. I won't ever do business with them again. I couldn't find instructions on amazon.com about returns, so I just sent it back to the address on the original package. It has been a couple of weeks, and it hasn't been returned to me, and I haven't heard from Clover Media either. I don't know what to think or do now. I'm not ordering any more items from amazon.com until this situation is resolved. I put some items on my wish list for now to order when or if the situation is resolved.
I RATE THE TRANSACTION MINUS FIVE SINCE I GOT A DVD THAT WON""T PLAY; I CAN'T FIND INSTRUCTIONS ABOUT RETURNS; I E-MAILED CLOVER MEDIA ABOUT IT; THEY IGNORED ME AND COMPLAINED ABOUT ME; AND I'M STILL UP IN THE AIR ABOUT IT.",1319241600,,1375,4.251908396946565
2290342,5,B0009GX1XI,"OK, so it's a hot stripper flick with a lot of naked women and, for its 1997 release, surprising in its explicitness. On that point alone it could have landed four stars if not five.

But what will surprise you is the depth of characterization and the superior writing. I've seen tons of major releases that aren't written, directed or acted this well.

Josie Hunter's turn as the lead character is--dare I say it--almost brilliant. Her dialogue delivery is a little stilted at times but you can tell so much that she really connected with the stripper-slash-hooker-slash-mother. I mean for God's sake, she was crying during the sex scenes, while her body is doing one thing but her mind something else.

The story really takes us places, shows us how screwed up some women can be in the head when it comes to sexuality and love and emotions and motherhood. As much as we would like it to be the case, sometimes there are no easy answers. Erica has it all there in front of her and the audience can't figure out why she just doesn't take the best way out of her predicament. Yet she keeps on getting in more deeply even though she hates what she does and hates herself for doing it.

This is very realistic. Reminds me of one of my ex girlfriends actually.

The worst part of the movie probably is its title, which brings to mind much cheaper recent soft-core fare.",1278028800,,1365,4.510121457489879

It certainly is what we old timers might call ""late night cable fare"" but it's a heck of a lot better than most I've seen.
