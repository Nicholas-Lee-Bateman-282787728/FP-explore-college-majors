2074002,4,B0002ATCN4,"I remember watching this mini-series when it first came out.  I thought it was very well-done and a good ""What if?"" scenario.  I hope this series gets put to DVD sometime in the very near future.  I would buy it immediately.",1114992000,41,224,4.414634146341464
2074003,5,B0002ATCN4,"Amerika, the novel, explains more than the movie ever could.

The American President, supposedly Carter, receives a call from the USSR. Their communication satellites are really nuclear weapons, hovering over the US. The US has 8 hours to surrender or be destroyed. After confirmation, the U.S. President forces through the annexing of the US by the USSR.

The USSR, poor and starving, pillages the US of all it's resources. Money, food and anything that is not nailed down goes to the new owners, not to the people. Americans are forced into the same life as their Russian counterparts.

At the same time, the USSR props up the House, Senate and the figurehead President as puppets for Moscow.

Some of it is way too over the top. But, the thought of a bloodless coup is nothing surprising in today's society.

It is slightly scary, with some elements very timely in the age of a 9/11 society.",1103241600,23,894,4.741935483870968
2074004,5,B0002ATCN4,"Ready for a trip in the way-back machine?

When aired on TV during the 80s, I remember one part in which the entire congress is massacred (hope springs eternal). The camera pans over the horrific scene of hundreds of dead bodies on the floor... movie then cuts to ""alka seltzer to the rescue"" jingle. If only they could put this in the DVD release - directors cut anyone?

Anyhoo, this one ranks up there with funny late-cold war flix: Firefox, Rocky IV, Spies like us - and the all time greatest - Red Dawn.",1092096000,12,508,4.3936170212765955
2074015,5,B0002ATCN4,"I watched this series and found it deeply thought provoking even in the 80's. Would love to see it released on DVD. It seems the thought police are not interested in this being revived, and yet this movie will touch the soul of our great nation. It challenges the stale emptiness of a land who has lost her passion for the price of freedom. I did find a link on Utube to the original trailor. Kris Kristofferson delivers on his performance, and actually, at the time, caused my wife & I to seek out other films he was cast, as well as Sam Neil. If you get the chance to see it... don't miss it. IMHO",1242432000,8,599,4.172413793103448
2074016,5,B0002ATCN4,"What this movie boils down to is ,""This is what we have in store for you in the future"". This movie was showing the BLACK HELICOPTERS before people started to see the BLACK HELICOPTERS a few years latter in the 90's. There have been any number of movies over the years about this very topic, THE INVASION N TAKE OVER OF AMERICA! To prove my point that this movie told to much, try n find this movie anywhere, it's pretty much impossible to find. The powers that be have made sure of that. Ever wonder why?",1213574400,6,505,4.270833333333333
2074017,1,B0002ATCN4,"From what I heard, the producers of ""Amerika"" wanted to film the exact opposite of ""The Day After"".  They certainly succeeded.  Where ""Day"" had a lot of interesting characters, ""Amerika"" has a huge cast full of dull cyphers.  Where ""Day"" had horrific images of nuclear destruction, ""Amerika"" has...well, scenes of grey city blocks.  Where ""Day"" is still remembered twenty years after it debuted, ""Amerika"" is nearly forgotten.

The producers promised that we ""would see America as conquered by the Soviet Union"", but usually, death, destruction, and the End of Our Way of Life is a lot more thrilling than this.  In many cases, I wondered whether the chief Soviet torture method was ""talking the Americans to death"".  Scene after scene involves people droning past each other in dim rooms, or making long, dull speeches to crowds who inexplicably applaud.  Even lines that should be dramatic, like ""If you're so powerful...why are you so afraid?"" come out sounding like ""Please pass the salt.""  (And thank God SALT was passed, so we don't have to suffer any more movies like this.)

If you're someone who loves to scare yourself with fantasies about the Big Bad Soviets, then do yourself a favor and watch ""Red Dawn"" instead.  It's good trashy fun, the cast is cute, and there are lots of good battle scenes.  If you're looking for something that will lull you to sleep, (or if you're nostalgic for your most boring college professor's dullest lecture) then watch ""Amerika"" instead.",1189641600,6,1482,4.955465587044534
2074018,5,B0002ATCN4,If they released this on DVD I would buy it in a second.  The mini series etched a place in my mind as a child.  The Russians invade the United States and wipe-out the leadership.  I will never forget the scene where Congress is massacred.  It gave me nightmares.  This mini-series when viewed in its context of the Cold War and Red scare phenomenon is frightening.  I can't wait until they release it on DVD!,1181001600,21,409,4.386666666666667
2074019,1,B0002ATCN4,"i was 19 years old when this series aired on tv. I stayed up every nigh for 7 nights taping each episode and taking out the commercials. More tot he point. the $40 million ABC spents was well worth it. some may call AMERIKA propaganda, but it is just a 'what if' movie. but, it does make you think about your freedoms.

great performances all around, especially by sam neil, kris kristofferson and robert urich. Be sure to keep an eye out for a 17 year old LARA FLYNN BOYLE. she ws terrific.",1177113600,4,491,4.279569892473118
2074020,2,B0002ATCN4,"When AMERIKA originally aired on ABC 1987 as a mini-series its first two installments peaked in the ratings.  The remaining five nights of the mini-series nose dived into obscurity.  The simple truth is that AMERIKA suffered a malady similar to HEAVEN'S GATE in that the film was just too long.

ABC spent $40-million on this production.  No doubt the money was recouped from commercial sponsorship, but the film never achieved the success of ROOTS or NORTH AND SOUTH.  If AMERIKA had been cut back to two nights we would have been treated to a much quicker paced television movie without all the fluff.  AMERIKA instead belabors a story chock full of American apathy, useless cabaret musical numbers, and sympatheic Soviet occupiers.

In summary the United States has been pacified by a Soviet first strike ""Star Wars"" weapon and is forced to accept surrender terms.  Even the Soviet leaders are somewhat disappointed as to how quickly America has given up on itself.  On the surface life seems to go on as usual, except that the US Congress debates issues of little significance and the President has no real power.  To ensure that the United States never again becomes a world power the Soviets and their United Nations occupation forces -- most Soviet Client countries -- begin dividing up the United States into smaller nations.  The breakup of the country is actually facilitated by Americans, including the US Military, who see this as a means to further their own selfish causes.  A resistance movement belatedly strikes coordinated blows at the occupying forces in a kind of second American Revolution.  Unfortunately the mini-series abruptly ends with the senseless death of the anti-hero and without resolution.  In short:  No happy ending.  Some have speculated that this downbeat ending was in preparation for possible sequels.

Sam Neill and Robert Urich offer credible performances that are overwhelmed by the numerous subplots in the movie.  Kris Kristofferson's character is little more than a serious version of TAXI's  ""Jim Ignatowski"" as a former patriotic and maverick politician who has just about lost everything after years in a re-education camp.

AMERIKA generated more controversy before its airing than it ever did during its seven night run.  The Soviet empire was fast decaying and Soviet leaders were very sensitive to media that portrayed them as aggressors.  Moscow threatened ABC with the closure of its Moscow news bureau, but ABC weathered the storm as the issue garnered free publicity for the upcoming series.

Where RED DAWN succeeded, AMERIKA failed.  The dialogue drones on endlessly and the action sequences are limited primarily to the end of the film.  Despite the shortcomings of the production it is still something that might be more enjoyable on DVD in that you can watch it at your leisure and easily skip ahead of less critical scenes.",1173657600,13,2885,5.087234042553192
2074021,5,B0002ATCN4,"I also would like to see Amerika put on DVD, with at least one version skillfully edited to retain the important political and human truths in a more viewer-friendly length.

Amerika looks at the possibility of terrible human suffering in our country, from a materialistic point of view--which may make it more accessible to some viewers. In doing this, however, the story's mostly political explanation of how such things could happen here (and have already happened in other places) makes it a less effective preventative.

After the series aired, our local TV station broadcast a discussion open to everyone in the community. At that time, there were many people who had recently escaped totalitarian regimes--e.g., Vietnamese ""boat people."" They were adamant in telling viewers that Amerika's warning was neither wild-eyed paranoia nor idle speculation.

We still need to remember Amerika.",1144627200,18,893,5.364285714285714
2074022,5,B0002ATCN4,"Having just seen Kris Kristofferson in ""Dreamer"", it brought back memories of his performance in ""Amerika"". I'm amazed this has not found its way into DVD. As a baby boomer, I remember the times when it first aired on TV.

2074024,5,B0002ATCN4,"Having spent some years on the dark side of the Iron Curtain, I was amazed to see how well Donald Wrye has constructed his ""What If?"" tale. This is the way Russians behave on their good days. AMERIKA presents a sanitized version of  the way Russia has, under csar and commissar, ruthlessly crushed other cultures and civilizations. For two centuries Russia expanded its control by the land size of a Belgium per year. It has never produced anything anyone wanted beyond raw materials, these from stolen lands. It has prospered by the ability of its army to take goods from other countries.  It is instructive for Americans to see what might have been their fate had Russia dealt with them as they had with Poles, Estonians, Hungarians, Lithuanians, Tartars, Chechens, Khazhaks, Azeris, Armenians, Georgians, Chechs, Slovaks, Lativaks, Yakuts. Just watching AMERIKA gives one a feeling of gratitude to Reagan, JP II, Solidarity, the American people, and the others who brought the Evil Empire down.",1126224000,15,997,5.073170731707317

Yes, it could happen here.

Most of us would admit that possibility.
Especially with the current packing of our leaders with types that would not cry over a takeover by Ratchet-Fascism or force.

Do not hold your breath to see this on DVD with out putting out some big bucks on your part and converting it over yourself.

8025442,3,B0002ATCN4,"It's hardly surprising that this interesting, kind of funny right-wing propaganda film was released right in the height of the Reagan administration.  I've read the book several times and have seen most of this film and a lot of the anti-Russian rhetoric here appears to spout straight from Reagan and his cronies' mouths and esp. the inaccurate portrayal of Russians is actually ripped off any storyline about the 1930's Nazis and just supplanted with Russian and communist terms.

I have a close friend who has lived in Russia all her life and she lived through the Soviet communist era and she says that this film and book is really nothing like real Soviet life; in reality, Soviets did not live in the horrible poverty depicted in this story nor were they bent on world conquest like the Nazis were nor were they all miserable.

True, they did not have the same freedoms of most Western countries, but I always knew in due time, the Soviet people would rise up and demand more freedom in due time.

Few Americans realized back then that the Soviets also feared American attack as much as many Americans feared Soviet attack; they too feared American takeover or invasion (and like the States, they probably released films like this one in counterpart of a ""what if..."" take on a possible United States takeover of Russia).

It's actually an interesting piece for a history study of the propaganda used during the cold war and how both sides easily distorted facts to fuel the fire of hatred between the heads of two nations when in reality, most Americans and Soviets just wanted peace and freedom to conduct their different countries in their own ways.

Kudos to the Gorbachevs for breaking down the iron curtain of misunderstanding and mistrust between the two nations and for ending the cold war.",1245888000,5,1804,4.803225806451613
