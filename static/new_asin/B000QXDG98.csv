8311046,5,B000QXDG98,"If it weren't for the great characters and solid comedy that is delivered in each volume, this series would definitely fall into the `just another shonen' category. Twenty four episodes in though, I'm still finding myself interested in these characters and what happens to them next. I can't imagine that anyone who has watched this far into the series hasn't been sold on it yet but I know some people who weren't wild about the first story arc so if the series lost you early, this is another great chance to get back into it with minimal information to play catch up on.",1214092800,,573,4.572815533980583
8311047,4,B000QXDG98,"The first season of Bleach ended with Ichigo, Uryu, Chad, Orihime and the cat Yoruichi leaving the living world for the Soul Society.

But getting there isn't the least of their problems. ""Bleach Volume 6: The Entry"" continues our heroes' quest to rescue Rukia from a death sentence, but they run into a new set of obstacles. It's pretty divided between action, slapstick and exposition, but promises to get even better.

Ichigo and Co. narrowly make it into the Soul Society, almost losing Uryu along the way. But as soon as they try to infiltrate the Seireitei -- a walled fortress where the Soul Reapers live -- the little gang is met by Jidanbo, a building-sized Gatekeeper who has very strong opinions about manners. He also won't let them inside.

So for the first time, Ichigo gets to show off the new powers he's acquired -- but even after he defeats Jidanbo, he's confronted by a deadly Captain, the snakey Gin Ichimaru. The little gang is left sealed outside the slummy Rukon District, to plan the next move of their mini-invasion. Chad also meets up with an old friend who is living nearby.

But after a nasty run-in with some punky boar-riders, Ichigo is reluctant to go see the mysterious Kukaku Shiba, who may be able to get them into the Seireitei. Unfortunately, her brother Ganju is the guy Ichigo fought the previous night -- and even if they don't rip each other apart, Ichigo might accidentally blow up the house.

These four episodes kick off an entire arc in the Soul Society, and it's mostly composed of our heroes racing around causing general mayhem. But the sixth ""Bleach"" DVD is more about getting into the fortress in the first place, and finding out more about the Soul Society. Well, it's not as pleasant and peaceful as Rukia led us to believe -- in fact, it has even more weirdos than Ichigo's hometown.

As a result, the weirdos generate a lot of comedy, both physical (Ichigo almost blowing himself up in the ""cannonball,"" Ganju skidding across a street on his face) and verbal (""So your name's Ichigo, huh? That's a pretty cute name for someone who takes himself so seriously."" ""MY NAME IS NOT CUTE!"")

And like the episodes before it, these four have a good mixture of poignancy, action, comic slapstick, and wacky characters. Lots of Ichigo fighting powerful opponents and struggling to master new skills, as well as a wall-smashing brawl with Ganju. But there's also the sweet scene where Chad bonds with Yuichi the parakeet-boy.

This volume also introduces us to some the Shibas (""both of them nutty as a fruitcake""), who seem to have some nasty history with the Soul Reapers, and Jidanbo the honorable, kindly giant. The Soul Reapers themselves don't really do much here, except have a meeting and bicker.

""Bleach Volume 6: The Entry"" is a solid little setup for the Soul Society arc, and has plenty of action, comedy and kooky characters in the meantime.",1198281600,,2897,4.743538767395626
