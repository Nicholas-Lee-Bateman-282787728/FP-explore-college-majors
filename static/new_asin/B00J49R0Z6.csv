6332757,3,B00J49R0Z6,i chose  3 star because this is only the first season not the complete series the second season is still ongoing and airing...,1398902400,6,126,4.478260869565218
6332758,5,B00J49R0Z6,"Quick review about the series!

Date A Live is a very fun anime, with cute characters and HILARIOUS writing that comes from the characters who assist our main protagonist in successfully dating these cute girls, known as Spirits, and the Spirits not knowing much about the human world, resulting in great comedic situations.  Also, if you're into cute female characters, this series is full of em, and nearly all of them are likable.  Kurumi's my favorite, and her arc doesn't even get completed in this season.  Yoshino, the girl with the blue hair and the green bunny costume is my second favorite.  To be honest, the only girl I didn't entirely enjoy was Origami, but luckily, Tohka play's off her well, so, Tohka can get the humor across during most of her scenes.

I've only seen the series once, and it was a little while ago, so I'm still a bit fuzzy on all the details, but I can certainly say it had me laughing, and I loved the characters, for the most part.  certainly check it out!  I'm excited to see how the english dub was handled for this series.",1395964800,64,1062,4.523560209424084

6332809,5,B00J49R0Z6,"- Synopsis: Our main character is your average anime kid: just plain and ordinary. From mysterious spatial quakes, to mysterious spirits in the forms of cute girls; his life is no longer going to be the same. Reluctantly, he resolves himself that he would rather solves things by peaceful methods. This in turn results in him having the girls fall for him, and then kiss them to seal their destructive powers--that in turn will prevent them from being targeted by the military. The adventures of this lucky (or unlucky) guy will determine if the world will still be intact; depending on his romantic skill and the moods of the girls.

===========================================================================================================

- Comments: He generally is nice to everyone and is hesitant like many male protagonists are. The girls generally like to tease him. But most end up developing romantic feelings for him for plot reasons. Much of this anime revolves around the emphasis of relationships, which is relatable to real life. Since many of the interactions between people involve some sort of relationship: family, friends, acquaintances, and strangers.

- Analysis: Due to how kind-hearted he is, like many other main characters, Shido would rather risk his life for a more peaceful outcome. Many probably would agree. If a situation can be worked out without resorting to violence, why not attempt it? And so, our main character must struggle to win the hearts of his targets in order to save them from being captured or killed. What a nice guy. As he constantly is the target of being teased, the dangers and harem that surrounds him also increases.

Many people might have mixed feelings about a plain and/or weak protagonist that needs the protection of the opposite sex. In this case, I think it's more interesting that the protagonist isn't over-powered as one-sided fights tends to be boring. At least if he's weak, he'll have to struggle more towards victory. To be fair, the females around him aren't exactly delicate. They have their own unique powers that can make them dangerous. Part of having a weak protagonist can emphasize how strong other characters are.

- Features: English and Japanese audio, as well as English subtitles. Includes 12 Episodes on 2 Blu-rays and 12 on 2 DVDs. Runtime is about 5 hours and is rated TV-14 for some violence and fan-service.

- Conclusion: It's a pretty straight-forward anime and has some funny scenes. Doesn't get serious until it nears the end. Otherwise, it's mainly a pretty happy anime where you gotta kiss them all to save them all.

6332817,5,B00J49R0Z6,"I'm from Germany (so please excuse my lousy dictionary-supported english)  and I totally LOVE this Series. First I want to mention my only negative Point about it: Reading the description  on the backside means being spoilered in my mind. Without having to read it I think the experience of the Story would be much better for novices. I was lucky and watched it without knowing anything, and I think I would not have been that stunned and addicted after the first episode if i had known the things that are mentioned in the description.
So heres my Message for other european Fans and prospective customers: As you probably already noticed,  the Date a Live Anime is not available in europe. (Even Special manga/Anime Shops won't Import it for you; I tried it out two times. ) AND NOW I WARN YOU:  Buying the US-American Version here on Amazon is obviously the easiest Way. But its not done with ordering this Volume: For some reason Date a Live is One of the Small Amount of films and Series that is protected with a REGION CODE.  That means neither the DVDs nor the Blue-rays will be played by a European Standart DVD/Blu Ray Player. To watch it you will Need A PC or A Laptop. For the DVDs its sufficient to have the VLC- Media Player, but to watch the Blue-Rays you will Need a Blue-ray-Drive AND a Blue-ray Player Software, that plays Blue-Rays from All Regions (multi-Region Player). So you should be REALLY sure how much Money you want to spend for watching Date a Live on your own Blue-Ray. For me As a Fan, it was OK to pay about 150$ simply to have the first Season of Date a Live on Blue-Ray and watch it legally on my PC. (And we all know there are cheaper and less-legal ways to watch it on the Internet.)
Regarding this Product, fullfilled my expectations completely. Much better to see the series in HD instead of that pixelated Youtube rubbish. The best fact about the Series is, that the Plot is actually moronic, but you won't notice it because of the great character desing and the addicting storyline. And the best thing about this Product is, that it contains the series and  let's be honest here  what could be better than transparent blue-ray-discs with spirits on it?
I hope Funimation is going to synchronise the Movie DAL: Mayuri Judgement, too. And I wish more DAL-Merchandise could be imported to europe :-/

My Mates told Me: Watch Anime Series. Its a lot of fun. So I watched HOTD, and after that I watched Date a live. Date a Live, the second Series I watched in my life and probably the last one. Cause what could be a better Anime for me than Date a Live? Sorry mates, I think I found my Holy Grail.",1462579200,4,2632,4.46875

I recently bought the original japanese light novels, posters, figurines and a mousepad with Tohka on it. Its not even my favorite thing ever, its just addicting, funny, and awesome. I would recommend it to basically anyone, even if they don't really like harems. Anyways, I also want to know who Joel McDonald is. Date A Live is directed by some japanese dude I'm pretty sure.

Aside from that, which I think is just some weird mistake on Amazon's part, boy do I love this series.",1440201600,,578,4.401869158878505
6332862,5,B00J49R0Z6,"Date A live is an anime harem series that I couldn't recommend enough, I'll start by saying that, buy this! Now for the actual review. Date A Live stars a young teenage boy who lives in a world that has been threatened by an advanced alien race destroying cities and such with ease. However he soon learns that these destructive moments and these Aliens aren't so clear cut, they are being done by powerful Alien women who don't usually mean to, they just appear and end up wreaking havoc by accident. Our young hero learns he has a power thought, he can seal the Alien women's powers away by causing them to fall in love with him and then kissing them. Now he is tasked by a secret organization to date these aliens and save the world. It sounds ridiculous and it is but Date A Live thrives because of that concept. Our hero dates girls and his support team uses the concept of dating sim choices to help him catch the girls hearts, that's amazing. Animation wise Date A live looks good as well with some impressive visuals and fight scenes. The sound is awesome with the English dub being quite well done. Overall Date A Live is an epic series with only one flaw, the second season has yet to be released in dub! Yet otherwise this show is simply awesome.

Pretty much the idea is a secret organization run by the main characters sister had dedicated itself to getting the main character mad game with alien girls to keep them from destroying the world. Not that a solid plot like that is bad, but some of the girls do catch on that he is being fed lines to say on these dates. Still for whatever reason that doesn't bother them and they just act as if the guy is the one telling them all the romantic pickup lines.

My only qualm with this series was the fact that many character arcs were not completed in this first season :( The up side to that is of course the hope of more seasons! I can't wait until they come out with season 2 and based on how fast new seasons were dubbed for series like Haganai and Attack on Titan, hopefully we won't have to wait long! All of the characters in this series are lovable in their own way, but my favorite is Kurumi :) Unfortunately her arc is one I am going to have to wait for, but I will persevere! This particular series has plenty of comedy and some fanservice, but nothing over the top and no nudity. The basic premise is we have our typically clueless protagonist surrounded by ""Spirits"", or girls who have different other-wordly powers, that he tries to seal away by kissing them. Good news is our protag isn't a completely dense stone, but there are plenty of things that just go right over his head in a comical way. He bumbles through dates with these spirits with the help of a team of ""love's rejects"", a group who gives him the most asinine advice on dating, which results in plenty of comedic situations. If you liked Haganai then you will surely like this as well! Support the American anime market and pick this up for your collection today! Worth every cent!",1406764800,14,1399,4.447470817120623

6332937,4,B00J49R0Z6,"This series should be for kids because it's funny and amusing, but there is some very brief nudity.  This is centered around a few, ""oops I walked in and saw your butt while you were in the shower"" followed by Shido being punched out.  There is some fan service as well but it is by no means the focus of the show.  I would recommend this for ages 15+.

While this is a typical harem set up, it is well done and entertaining.  There is an English dub which is Ok, but I prefer the Japanese voice acting which is excellent!  The animation style is modern and the girls are cute.  There is also some range in the animation with mecha battle suites, different city locations, and various outfits the characters wear.  The girls who are Spirits battle the female defense force.  It's a premise to blow things up and adds some entertainment value.  The real point of interest is Shido goes on dates with each Spirit while receiving advice from an ear piece that is linked to a ""dating command center.""  The advice is often hysterically wrong and the ""advisors"" are amusing stereo types.  The objective is to make the Spirit girls happy and then kiss them to seal away their destructive power.  This makes them safe to join Shido in everyday life and battle for his attention.

The show does fall short of five stars for a few reasons.  Why are the Spirits here?  The show leaves it as, ""For some unexplained reason...""  By the last episode this plot point isn't resolved.  Overall the plot doesn't seem to progress.  None of the girls gain an advantage over their rivals in their pursuit of Shido.  The episodes are amusing and interesting and you don't really notice that season one is over until you see the credits.  There is a season 2 and a season 3 but the question remains on where to buy them?",1403568000,10,1796,4.464615384615384

I found it very funny to watch, the english dubbing isn't bad either. there are some changes in the lines but over all I think they made a good choice for the cast. the box it's self looks great with Tohka on the back, even the case covers them self's look great.

Overall I am happy with this set",1403136000,3,368,3.972972972972973

This is another that has become one of my favorites. The premise of it might seem silly to some ( find the spirit, make her fall in love and then kiss her to seal her power ). Yeah, it kind of sounds a bit corny, but the way it's done out it really is kinda cute.

This is one that is a pure enjoyment to watch..",1515456000,,405,3.697674418604651
