8634431,5,B00HQQQR2Q,"People get sucked into a game that depends on how well you figure out the challenges--big wads of money are at stake, so greed has a way of making folks conniving and manipulative. The heroine is one of those nice, naive girls who gets trapped in a game. Her only chance of making it through is with the help of the enigmatic, clever, con guy played by beautiful-faced Shota Matsuda.

It's really one of those engrossing dramas where you try to figure out the trick to each challenge and who is good and who is bad and how the naive heroine is gonna get suckered in yet again and how smart Shota is gonna help her out. Dizzying. And fun, too.

I'd have watched it just to enjoy Matsuda's magnificent face and attractive voice, but fortunately, there's a lot more to Liar's Game. (and if you liked the manga, the drama is fun)",1397433600,,825,4.38562091503268
