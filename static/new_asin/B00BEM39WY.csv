8567256,5,B00BEM39WY,"It's very informative and gives the viewer an authentic element of how Catch Wrestling is taught. Billy goes into full detail about every move and brings great energy to how to apply the holds and tackdowns. As a former student of the legendary Billy Robinson, Billy gives you a clinic of submissions and other moves that came from the legend himself in the Wigan Style of Wrestling. Amazing DVD and every MMA fighter should have this in his/her posession as it can amplify their game to a higher level.",1529798400,,503,4.662921348314606
8567257,5,B00BEM39WY,"This is the most important grappling instructional I have ever used. Great technical instruction, examples, and good coaching cues for common mistakes. This type of wrestling is a great complement to Jiu Jitsu and MMA.  All of these moves work and he shows you how to adapt to different challenges. There is a myth that says CACC is all power. I have personally found that it is more efficient than all my Jiu Jitsu instruction.  Its all about technique and positioning. I can see why people would think its power since wrestlers historically have been the most conditioned people on the planet as any fighter should be. Amazon says the DVD is 1 hr. Its actually 1:48:34! I have no doubt that you will learn something you haven't seen before and you will see better variations of moves you do know. Buy this DVD.",1525219200,,812,4.631944444444445
8567258,2,B00BEM39WY,"The moves shown were excellent. The execution of the techniques shown were sub-par. The style of the video is turn on a video camera, point and shoot, which is a style that that I like and fits this setting, but I wish it were more organized. The price point for the quality of this video is horrible which is why I am only giving it two stars. I would give it 3 stars if the price point was about $20 which I think its worth. The bottom line is you should add this video to your collection when the cost is more affordable, and if you have at least one year of wrestling/bjj experience, to make sure you have a decent knowledge and understanding of a good ground game base.",1479427200,,674,4.1923076923076925
8567259,5,B00BEM39WY,"If you're reading this review then you're probably interested in some form of grappling? Don't have this DVD - get it! Better yet,if you live close to Billy Scott's academy -GO TRAIN!! The only drawback ,as previously mentioned by another reviewer, is the lack of a menu/directory in order to quickly access a particular movement or concept. I would NOT hesitate to purchase any further material that Billy puts out.",1442188800,,416,4.957142857142857
8567260,5,B00BEM39WY,"Quality instruction by Billy Robinson's ""best American student"".
Good sequencing of techniques,
Covering both standing and ground work
I look forward for the second edition!",1440374400,,173,5.96
8567261,5,B00BEM39WY,"I received Billy Scott's DVD and watched it twice on the same day. Billy Scott gives you tons of Catch techniques with clear and simple instructions. One thing I really enjoyed throughout the DVD is how it would seem that Billy would move away from one instruction and go to a totally different technique only to return and show how they could all be chained together into a flow. Great material and I look forward to more of his DVD's in the future. If you want an affordable DVD with loads of material by someone who was taught by Billy Robinson himself, this one is it.",1436054400,5,572,4.40566037735849

8567264,5,B00BEM39WY,I enjoy this DVD. I trained in brazilian jiu jitsu on & off for 10 years. It was different than I was used to. Billy Scott is a great instructor! Recommend this DVD to any grappler.,1389571200,2,181,4.055555555555555
