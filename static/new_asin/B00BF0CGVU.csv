5612960,4,B00BF0CGVU,"As far as movies and their box office records go these days, Salman Khan seems to be competing with only himself. Since `Wanted', each one of his film have made more money than the previous one. As entertainers these work big time because Salman has carved a niche for himself and caters to only his select audience because he knows them well. In Dabanng, he does more of the same as he tries to put a fresh face to a sequel that was a game changing film for him.
A few things have changed since the last film, the original director Abinav Kashyap declined to do the film and Arbaaz Khan became the director. However as a new director he does not bring a fresh perspective because this sequel is nearly identical to the first film, just the setting has changed from Lucknow to Kanpur. The first fight was in a warehouse in the original film and in the sequel as well. The Dabanng song, has nearly identical dance steps. The mandatory shirtless fight scene. Even Munni makes an appearance. The sameness to the original film is in every frame.
Chulbul Pandey (Salman Khan) is relocates to take charge of Bajariya Police Station in the city of Kanpur. Pretty soon Chulbul locks horn with the bully, Bachcha Bhaiyya (Prakash Raj) and his two brothers - Chunni (Nikitin Dheer) and Gainda (Deepak Dobriyal). These confrontations come to a head when Salman kills Gainda at a wedding ( amazing sceene)
The fight scenes are amazing especially the scene at the truck stop. The scenes between Salman and Sonakshi are identical to the first film and so is the song in Dubai. Chulbul's scenes with his father (Vinod Khanna) and brother Makkhi (Arbaaz Khan) are pleasant. If you don't like Salman you won't like the film because this movie was designed to reassert his dominant position at the domestic box office. So the director takes the original film and makes some minor tweaks, but taking care to highlight Salman in every frame. I was expecting great stuff from Prakash Raj, the villain but he is feeble and scowls more than he does anything. I also failed to recognize his voice- was it dubbed?
If you don't like Salman stay away from the film, but if you do then this is a very entertaining film. If it had a well written script and dialogues, it could have been a far more awesome film.
I thought the film was just ok, for fans of Salman though this is a five star experience. 4 stars. 12/21/2012",1360800000,2,2392,4.565116279069767

5612963,5,B00BF0CGVU,So when i first saw Dabangg i was a little unsure how to feel about it.. it was a little too violent for me and i wasn't sure if he was good or bad! Dabangg 2 is still as violent although it seemed a little less so to me and he's still not good or bad but i can appreciate that most people aren't one or the other. This one i liked way better than the first which might be sacreligious to most people but that's just my taste! The music is better in the first one but this has some good songs too and i liked the way arbaaz directed this. In an interview salman says arbaaz is more commercial than the first director was and i think that's why i liked it better! If you liked the first you will definately like this one too!!,1398902400,,725,3.938775510204082

8567475,3,B00BF0CGVU,"As much as I like Salman Khan, he falls short in this sequel.  The movie feels as if the plot was pieced together as the cameras were rolling.  Most of the characters have lost their sparkle and wit.  The result is a tedious prodding through stunts and one liners from the first film.",1430697600,,284,4.320754716981132
