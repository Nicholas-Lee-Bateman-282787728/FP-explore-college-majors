3831801,5,B0021BSOHW,"I ALMOST passed on this spectacular anime series because I was initially put off by the main character at the beginning of the story. Boy am I glad I didn't and you shouldn't either!

At first, the set-up for Twelve Kingdoms is somewhat similar to Fushigi Yuugi: A rather annoying whiny schoolgirl and her friends get sucked into another world similar to ancient China. They can't get back home, they get separated, and undergo many harrowing encounters with alien beasts in an unfamiliar environment. Fortunately, the resemblance ends there.

The main protagonist Youko Nakajima develops from a very insecure and self conscious high school girl to a courageous and self-aware young monarch of the Kingdom of Kei. All the supporting characters including villains are complex and add to the multilayered storyline.

Twelve Kingdoms is a very detailed mythological fantasy that's like an Asian version of Lord of the Rings or Chronicles of Narnia without the religious undertones or allegory. The animation is gorgeous and the soundtrack specially the opening theme is epic in scope.

The best thing about this anime are the life lessons it teaches. It's just too bad the series is incomplete. Nevertheless this is one you should NOT miss.",1259625600,62,1237,5.108910891089109
3831802,3,B0021BSOHW,"I wanted to love this series, but it fell flat for me.

Researching the terms used in this series is a big helper before you even start watching. The main characters have interesting backgrounds and most of them seem to develop nicely as the story progresses, but I failed to become attached to any of them. The English dub is very well done; I haven't yet experienced it with the original Japanese voice acting. The character designs definitely are not my style. I understand that main protagonist is supposed to start as an average girl, but the design just doesn't appeal to me. The animation looks pretty good, and the grandiose world is well presented.

I'm going to give it another watch with subtitles at some point. Maybe it'll do something to create the magic I felt was missing. So, take my review with a grain of salt until I make an edit with a second run through. :)",1258502400,5,879,4.522012578616352
3831803,5,B0021BSOHW,This is an excellent anime. Awesome character development is involved. Story is fantastic! Its not your typical girl from another world anime. your on the edge of your seat the whole time!  Its 45 eps long but its still not enough i wanted more. saying that though doesn't mean it ends on a cliffhanger.  The show in the end wraps up very well and your left satisfied with the ending.  Any anime fan would love this series and won't be left disappointed.  Highly recommend it.,1251676800,28,476,4.564705882352941
3831804,5,B0021BSOHW,"In the long history of Japan's habit of being introspective, ""Twelve Kingdoms"" comes across as the best not only modern Japan can produce today, but the best modern man can produce up to this point.

  America has had too long a history of simplistic ""good guy"" vs ""bad guy"", partly to get the gullible to consider volunteering for the armed forces, in my opinion. Japan, on the other hand, with such a devastating loss from World War II, has learned to search for ultimate truth through the necessary sufferings of life (ultimate aloneness, the importance of compromise/give and take to survive, etc.), and to teach it to their future generations.

  So although it appears that the story is reflecting on issues that are uniquely Japanese, further reflection should reveal to the viewers that the issues ""Twelve Kindoms"" address are really not too far off from the plight of modern man in general.

  And to put it all in the context of a young teenage girl, along with the brilliant artwork and music that many Japanese animae are famous for, is the NHK touch of genius for which the world is grateful.

3831805,5,B0021BSOHW,"This was some of the best story telling I have ever heard or seen in an Anime Series.

There are many small stories and a few larger ones but they are all connected.

The main story ends on the second to last disc of the second season. If you continue to the very last disc of the second season there is a flash back story that was great and not what you'd expect as a lead-out. This story had a good message and I felt wrapped up the collection nicely.

This collection is worth buying if you can follow and enjoy complex stories.",1247616000,13,531,4.135922330097087
3831806,4,B0021BSOHW,"Well pretty much I have to say I am pretty pleased. I had been thinking about purchasing the premium sets but I couldn't make myself pay even the used prices for them. I went to the local video store and saw this version for about 20 bucks. I had heard such great things I really couldn't resist.

On the dvd itself. The case is poorly made, 6 dvds stuffed into a standard dvd case. When I bought it 2 of the dvd plastic holders were broken too so they keep falling out of place. I won't talk about the show too much because there are enough reviews on that.

I thought this was a really good deal for the price. I can't really notice any quality issues. Sound is fine, picture quality is fine, it even comes with english dubs, trailers, and more. I have bought a few bootlegs by accident before and hated them because there was an actual noticeable drop in quality (Bebop, Gundam, Berserk). However I had seen the good quality versions of those and never of 12 kingdoms.

All in All I think this is a great buy. I would prefer to have the premium sets but they are just too expensive right now. I know the quality has to be lacking because of the 45 episodes on 6 dvds but I honestly can't really notice any quality related issues. I am very impressed by this bootleg version...(never thought i'd say that) and would have to recommend it to anyone who is unable to purchase the premium sets. I'll probably purchase them eventually to compare but till then this is my review.",1220140800,3,1475,4.336956521739131

She learns just as much about herself as she does her new world. I watched the Japanese audio version, but I guess English is close to the same. I was blown away by the worlds detail and the interesting characters. I think even non-anime fans would find this a good watch. And just because the lead is a female shouldn't be a turnoff to male viewers (it isn't). It deserves to be made into a good movie series or something.",1360540800,,545,4.352941176470588

How did I decided to watch the second disc...well I saw the preview of the next episode and saw a gaint RAT. And so I said ...""I'll do it for the rat!"" It was a wise choice because Rakushun you are one good man.

PS This is based on the novel by Ono Fuyumi. The novels are very good too. You get way more information from it. But I love the art and music from the anime.",1357257600,,645,4.03125
3831814,5,B0021BSOHW,"This is without a doubt one of the best animated shows I have seen. It tells the story of a girl who is one day whisked off to another world and told she is the ruler of a kingdom. The first arc ( episodes  1 - 14) shows us how she acquires her kingdom . The second long arc ( episodes 21- 39) is about yoko learning about the difficulties that arise from ruling a large kingdom. Episodes 15- 20 and 40 -45 are stand alone arcs which focus on different characters. The story arc in episodes 15-20 is not fully resolved and this  is a cause for complaint.
What sets this show apart is that it manages to avoid every single cliche. Even though the main character is a girl and there are quite a few other female characters , the women are not hypersexualized one dimensional characters , but have their own unique personality. Heck there is no distracting romance in this at all , not even a kiss . There is no over the top slapstick comedy here, which you find in most anime shows, which distracts rather than entertains (I am looking at you FMA brotherhood). The action scenes are few but well done. Although there are scenes where you will see more than a little blood , I will not say that this show has excessive gore.
What I really love about this show is the music. Just one word to describe it - Wow. The music manages to haunt , soothe and thrill all at the same time . No western beats like cowboy bepop or samurai champloo ( i admit those shows did the western music thing well but most shows don't ).
The story is interesting. In truth it can seem especially in the beginning of an arc that the characters are whiners but they grow on you and develop as the story progresses. There are a lot of terms and names that can confuse the viewers , so attention is required.
When you come down to it , this show is a character driven show. If you are looking for DBZ fight sequences in a fantasy setting , you will be disappointed. If you are looking for girls in tight outfits , this is not the show for you. The show can be enjoyed by the whole family. The animation style is fluid and the dub is not too bad. So do give this show a try .",1347321600,,2143,4.136690647482014

This series is not necessarily about one person but about the world itself and it shows part of the world through the eyes of different characters.

3831818,5,B0021BSOHW,"The Twelve Kingdoms features many of the trappings of epic fantasy: a complex fantastic realm with plenty of back-story, powerful monsters, and spectacular sword duels. But at its heart The Twelve Kingdoms is really a wonderful study of how seemingly worthless people can be tempered by severe hardship into people of great character; from people you would avoid to people you would be happy to call friend. I actually felt like a better person when I finished it; not a feeling I normally get from watching anime.

But you should know a few things before you get into this excellent show: It features four separate story arcs, and only two of them actually involve the main protagonist Yuoko. I highly recommend new viewers only watch episodes 1-13 and 22-39; my five-star rating pertains primarily to just those episodes. The episodes in-between tell an unfinished and unrelated story, and are likely to leave viewers feeling frustrated. Episodes 14 and 21 are unimportant ""recap"" episodes I'd only recommend watching if you still feel confused after watching the first 13.

The first few episodes (1-5 and 22-29) of these story arcs can be tiresome, as the protagonists start as annoying, whiny characters; but I urge everyone to ""stick with it"" and keep watching as the payoff at the end is certainly worth it: Twelve Kingdoms features one of the best endings I've ever seen (at episode 39). It's important for us to see these characters as annoying and somewhat pathetic so that we fully appreciate the strong, self-aware people they become in the end. For this reason re-watching the series is a special treat; I recommend watching it again at least once.

The setting of The Twelve Kingdoms is complex and the myriad of special terms may put some people off; but I would again urge people to be patient; Yuoko generally knows less than us, and her lack of understanding is important to the story, so a bit of confusion on our part helps us to empathize with her.

Finally, I'd recommend watching the Japanese audio with English subtitles if you can stand to do so. Yuoko's voice is much more expressive on the Japanese track and features noticeable changes in tone that reflect and highlight the changes in her attitude as the story progresses. However, most of the other English voice-overs are actually fairly good.

Twelve Kingdoms is from 2002 and so the quality of the animation, while good, isn't quite up to par with modern animes like Moribito: Guardian of the Spirit. There is no sexual content of any kind (and although some characters are depicted taking baths, nothing racy is seen), and almost no romantic content whatsoever. There is no gore, almost no blood shown, and most deaths occur off-screen. While many episodes feature exciting and well done action, fighting isn't quite the focus of The Twelve Kingdoms and the entire first half of the third arc (episodes 22-32) features almost no action at all. Although the content is probably safe for kids, I can't imagine any kids being able to follow the complex plot, or deal with the intense emotions portrayed within. Twelve Kingdoms isn't tame for the sake of a PG rating; it simply understands its focus is storytelling and therefore doesn't need to delve into sex or violence to make for a truly entertaining experience.",1304985600,26,3297,4.89087656529517
3831819,4,B0021BSOHW,"Great stories must excel in one of a few things, usually including world-building, character development, and story telling. Twelve Kingdoms, with its heavy - and brilliant - uses of Chinese mythology and the complex but uncomplicated systems that govern the world make for an engrossing case of world-building.

Some of the character development can be painstaking, but always seem to come to rather satisfying, though not always expected, conclusions. The only thing that keeps this from a five is that the series cuts off too quickly. This rankles my Western conception of the story that brings plotlines to their proper conclusions, though it is more in line with episodic styles of narrative inherent in Chinese mythology. However, my judgments are mine own, and not being able to see certain plotlines reach conclusion (most notably Taiki's story).

All in all, this is a fantastic series that draws you in. Perhaps most telling is that, when it seems to cut off so suddenly (even after 45 episodes!) i was distraught by the thought that the tale had ended. always a good sign.",1290124800,,1083,5.011111111111111

I mean I was very surprised how great of an anime this is...Even if you're not a fan of fantasy genre, please take some time to enjoy this...

Pacing 5/5
-I love how the stories are told...so SAVOR every episode...i know some viewers don't want an episode of recap...you have to expect about 3 or 4...though they're not completely recap episodes...they're merely ""teaching episodes""...i mean the whole series is glutted with terminologies that work only in their own fantasy world...it's nice enough for the director of the show or whoever is in charge to include some episodes to guide the viewers through the series

Theme  5/5
-it's about taking on a role and learning about it (leadership to be more precise)

Characters 5/5
-there's a lot of characters but each of them contributed so much to help keep the viewers from getting bored...it's very multi-layered when it comes to characters....i also love how they developd through the whole series, though it's divided into 4 main arcs, each arc is very well-written, especially the 3rd one about the main character, Yoko, and the other 2 girls who seem to go through the same Yoko is in....that is one of the best arc i have seen in a long time

Music 5/5
-the music is very well-done...it will surely give you goosebumps...it's that good...

Animation 5/5
-very realistic...

All in all 5/5...what can I say it's worth it to buy it at $45...even if it's $90...i'd buy it in a heartbeat...

I wish Media Blasters had pampered this series more and packaged it in a very good-looking sturdy artbox...and i'd give (2/5) just for that...it's a shame...the series didn't deserve it...

So to everyone who hasn't seen this series yet, I HIGHLY RECOMMEND this to all of you...I assure you, you won't regret it...

This is just my opinion...I'VE LEARNED A LOT THROUGH THIS SHOW...and that's enough to recommend this to everyone...BTW I only watched the English-dubbed version, besides, I don't speak Japanese...anyway I hope you'll enjoy it...This should have a special place in your collection...and it certainly has in mine...",1280016000,,2241,4.8125
3831821,5,B0021BSOHW,"Twelve Kingdoms (TK) is an amazing epic fantasy, a favourite among my favourites, and for many anime enthusiasts, a defining experience.  I've watched it four times now and recommend it to anyone who can be bothered to listen to me gush (and those who took up the recommendation loved it as well).

TK (Juunikokki) is based on a series of light novels - young adult fiction - by Ono Fuyumi.  It has been compared to Fushigi Yugi and Saiunkoku Monogatari - based on its epic qualities, its fantasy element and its focus on a strong female lead - but it is truly in a class by itself.  I'd give a lot to find another series as strong and satisfying as this one.  The animation style is on the harder-edged side of the spectrum, not classically anime-cute, and colours are strong (think Moribito).  At first, I found it a bit off-putting, but not long in, I couldn't imagine it any other way.

There are 45 episodes in the series, and they basically cover four of Ono's seven volumes.  More were intended but to date have not seen - and are unlikely to see - production.  This edition contains all 45 episodes on 10 discs.

Ono has created an internally-consistent, complex world with a unique geography, monarchies, an overseeing heaven and fantasy creatures.  It's well-explained, and there's a fair bit of invented terminology to get under your belt, but I enjoyed becoming familiar with it.

The alternate world of TK exists parallel to our own, and temporary connections between the two can occur in violent, tornado-like storms (shoku).  During a shoku, inhabitants of one realm can get sucked into the other; returning to your home world is problematic but not impossible.  After some character-setting for the female protagonist, the story gets underway when the kirin for the kingdom of Kei (kirin are co-rulers of a kingdom and chose the king), goes to Japan in search of Kei's new king.  The kirin appears before Youko, an ordinary high-school girl with some self-esteem issues, and returns with her.  Unfortunately, they are separated.

Needless to say, she's upset.  Her denial and weeping can get irritating, but hang through it. It does get better! About 6 episodes in, things start to change, and there's sufficient along the way to keep you engaged.  Youko's is a journey to go home, and in the process, she discovers important things about herself that ultimately convince her to accept the rule of her kingdom alongside her kirin and aspire to strong, compassionate leadership.  In her travels she faces adversity (duh) and meets interesting characters, among them, the rat-human creature Rakushun, who is one of my favourites in the series (though it's very hard to pick).

The second arc tells the story of Taiki, the kirin of the kingdom of Tai (this is a story told to Youko).  The third arc tells of three girls (one is Youko) who follow their individual paths to become friends.  The fourth arc is a shorter story (also told to Youko) about an experience in the king of En's past.  Youko links these stories, as do several other secondary characters.

The anime has taken liberties with the novels, not just in making Youko more prominent, but also in adding several characters and plot elements that, in my opinion, improve the story. Even though the arcs are separate tales, everything still feels interdependent and satisfying.

What is absolutely delightful about TK are the characters.  Anime in general has a way of creating characters you tend to bond with; TK does this in spades!  That's not to say all characters are necessarily likable, but all are complex.  Even most of the bad guys have dimension.  Characters change in believable ways; you may start out not liking a character and yet come to feel very differently about him or her as the story progresses, and that shift in your perception feels natural.  Other characters you will gravitate to immediately and cherish throughout.  The plot elements are interesting.  The questions TK raises about governance are relevant and make you think.  The emotional subtexts are credible, rarely feel contrived and are thought-provoking.  The whole is treated with considerable intelligence (and you gotta love a story that doesn't talk down to you).  These are engaging tales extremely well told!

The biggest drawback to the series is that it's not complete, and not just because some of Ono's arcs are missing.  Taiki's story is left hanging in a sad, disturbing way (and what love you develop for Taiki and the king he chooses).  Part of the problem lies in the original light novels - Ono never concluded Taiki's story (though that circumstance hasn't stopped other series from making up their own endings).  Ono has subsequently revealed more of what happens to Taiki, but the ailing kingdom of Tai's fate is still unknown.  It will probably remain that way.  And that's a bit of an ache.  However, it shouldn't deter you from watching this series ... just be prepared for the lack of closure.

I can't speak to the quality of the English dub; I don't listen to dubs.  The seiyu are good character matches.  The subtitles are very well done.  I find the score appealing, subtle enough not to overpower the entire effect, strong enough to enhance the ambiance.  The opening theme starts lightly and develops a sort of Pirates of the Caribbean feel - it's epic, stirring and appropriate.

All volumes of Ono's light novels have been translated into French and German; TokyoPop is only now (and slowly) issuing the volumes in English translation.  At this time, four have been released.

3831822,3,B0021BSOHW,"This is probably one of the most well done fantasy anime I've ever seen.  I was initially drawn to the series because of the plot, which is so similar to one of my favorites, Fushigi Yuugi.  But this story is so much deeper than that.  Very dark at times, and focusing more on the political aspects of the world (as opposed to romance, which is sadly lacking) it is nevertheless a very powerful and gripping story.  The world is amazing, as are the characters (Chinese Unicorns, who can not love them?).

Unfortunately, due to circumstances, it was never completed, and ended halfway through one of the story arcs with many questions unanswered.  There has been no word (that I'm aware of) of this series ever being completed, either.  This is why I gave it only three stars.  It would have been the full five, otherwise.

Fortunately!  Tokyopop has licensed the original novel series by Fuyumi Ono that this anime is based on, beautifully translated with illustrations.  The books are hard to find (the first one is out of print), and they are being released slowly, but if you can get your hands on a copy, I highly recommend reading them to get the full story of this wonderful anime.",1274140800,2,1187,4.631578947368421

3831825,5,B0021BSOHW,"THE TWELVE KINGDOMS won't do ya if you're looking for a quick thrill or a one-and-done. This thoughtful anime works best if you have time to spare and don't get too fidgety at the focus on story and character development and the infrequent action sequences. THE TWELVE KINGDOMS - THE COMPLETE COLLECTION comes with ten discs and all 45 episodes, a looooong but gratifying viewing experience. Thank goodness I got sick and had to miss out on work. Yay for influenza.

The central character is insecure Japanese student Youko Nakajima, and you have to, just have to, hang around and give her a chance because she'll win you over. Youko is aggravating at the start because she whines and cries and wallows like crazy in self-pity, although I wonder how you or I would fare if suddenly unwillingly transported to a frightening, utterly foreign alternate reality?

Youko Nakajima begins to navigate thru a medieval world bristling with wild enchantment and terrible danger. Youko is a ""kaikyaku,"" a stranger from our world and regarded with deep mistrust by the natives of the Twelve Kingdoms. But she's luckier than the other two students who came along for the ride. Here, at least, Youko can understand the language and has a clear destiny, even if it's a destiny she chafes against. The Twelve Kingdoms are inhabited by sacred magical creatures called the Kirin who choose and then serve the Kings or Queens of the realms (thus, the throne isn't inherited). And the elegant (but sort of wooden) Kirin, Keiki, has chosen Youko Nakajima as the next Queen of the Kingdom of Kei. As protection Youko is granted a spirit (a Hinman) which resides within her body and takes over during battles. She is also given a mystical sword which allows her glimpses into the past, present, and future, except that this sword also comes loaded with a malevolent monkey-like entity which begins to plague her on a psychological level. So that sucks.

The lush fantasy elements are drawn from Japanese and Chinese folklore, and so we set eyes on monarchs become immortal by the Heavens' decree; we set eyes on wondrous, terrifying monsters (the Youma) and talking half-beasts called the Hanjyuu, with no Hanjyuu more endearing, by the way, than the gentle and wise young rat Rakushun who befriends Youko. And it's a given by now, with these fables, that the well being of the kingdom is intrinsically linked with its ruler and by how well he or she governs. One really interesting concept is that, in this strange world, babies don't originate from a mother's belly but, rather, are plucked from trees.

It's a dense, sprawling saga, the pace is deliberate, the tone is contemplative and character-driven, and you have to be in for the long haul because one episode tends to bleed into the next one. The animation is rich and detailed and vividly articulates the exotic elements within the Twelve Kingdoms. The only real downside I can find is that there isn't a resolution to the tale of the young Black Kirin Taiki.

The episodes are adapted from a series of novels by Fuyumi Ono, and while Youko is the most featured character, she's also utilized as a framing device to introduce the story arcs of other characters (like Taiki). But, to me, Youko Nakajima is the compelling character and I'm not as involved when the episodes are tracking the other characters. If you can get past the first six episodes - when Youko is at her whiniest - she becomes more sympathetic, and it's a natural progression, how she grows as a person and struggles thru the landmines of court intrigue and statesmanship. When you get to the 39th episode, when the Queen of Kei is at her most rousing, you almost shake your head at how callow she was when we first met her. Queen Kei is a great heroine and blessed by the Heavens. Raise the Dragon flag, yup.",1270857600,6,3815,4.756797583081571

3831827,4,B0021BSOHW,"There are about two reasons that would make you stop watching this anime from the start: A, it vaguely resembles Fushigi Yuugi, and B, you can't keep up with its characters and their confusing titles.  If you're worried about A, you shouldn't.  High school girl traveling to alternate universe is about all the resemblance there is.  And as for B, it's part of the necessary experience.  The story revolves around teen girl Nakajima Youko and how she ascends the throne to become the Queen of Kei.  Naturally, it'd be a chaotic and confusing time trying to figure out what's what in this new world she's been thrown into.  At the same time, this alternate world is also much more complex than the one in Fushigi Yuugi both in the social-political system, and in species classification.  Therefore, it is only right to be overwhelmed by that chock load of information even as a viewer.  Have a little patience and if fantasy genre is your thing, you won't be disappointed.  Generally I have a pet peeve for geometric/symmetrical structures for plot settings.  Think Avatar's Four Elements world, or Fushigi Yuugi's Long Lin Gui Feng world.  In almost the same way, Juuni Kokki's map looks suspiciously like the Bagua.  This sort of structure often feels a tad too confined in the way it defines the setting's characteristics.  But this is purely a personal nitpick that doesn't detract too much from the whole thing.

As the adaptation decided to revolve around Queen Kei with subplots weaved in between, the ending with regard to the Kingdom of Kei did not disappoint.  However, the title is after all ""The Twelve Kingdoms"" and one can't help but feel that there should be more to it.  For example, the Queen of Kyou was quite a character and it would've been nice to have her story explored.  And even if Queen Kyou is neglected entirely, the Kingdom of Tai certainly deserved a conclusion.  The series invested quite an amount of time on Taiki and the King of Tai's subplot.  Mystery and suspense were built up from their going MIA and we even know where Taiki had gone to!  Yet their ending wasn't addressed and for this I took away 1 star from the story.

As for this boxset, IMO it is very well worth the money.  Unless you're a collector freak, I wouldn't suggest investing in the pricier editions.  It comes without extra artworks but the inside covers are the same green & blue.  I can't justify spending 5X more unless I'm spending it on Taiki's proper ending.",1270339200,,2469,4.701631701631702

8348906,5,B0021BSOHW,"12 Kingdoms is a very interesting but unfinished anime. The series is broken into four parts with a couple of interlude episodes. (These are not recap episodes, though there are a few of those, too). These stories all interconnect somewhat, but the second of these stories remains unfinished because the anime caught up with its source material, a series of light novels. The light novels have since continued beyond where the anime ended, but the light novels themselves are still unfinished even now and I doubt the anime will continue until the light novels are finished, if it ever does continue. What has been adapted, however, is well worth a watch. The character development is the high point of the series, while the world building is captivating.

The animation is very dated and not of very high quality; however, it does improve over the course of the series and by the time you get about halfway through, it is hardly noticeable and some of the scenery and lighting is really beautiful. I personally liked the muted coloring. The character designs are very unique, which is really significant as this is definitely a character-driven series.

The music is very versatile and definitely lends a helping hand to the overall quality of the production. Some of it sounds celtic, and occasionally you hear some electronic pieces. There is one song that sounds so happy that you cant help but smile when you hear it, and there is a piano solo that is very emotive. The ending song, which has lyrics, is nothing special, and I found myself wishing for it to change.

This is a very slow-moving series with scenes of long conversations with little action. The character development is phenomenal, and the series builds much suspense by moving at a snails pace through many new developments, so I never found it boring. However, be prepared for the slow pace.

PART 1 (EPISODES 1-14): Rating: 4.5/5
I bought this series sight unseen, and there were a couple of times during the early episodes that I worried I had wasted my money. The series is pretty rocky at the start, with the first episode all but terrible and the second not very much better. I think one of the most difficult things a fantasy series can undertake is to draw characters from our own world into another. It must realistically cover the shock the characters experience and consciously introduce the other world as an unusual and unfamiliar thing, laboriously explaining everything as it goes in-between the understandable but tedious whining of the main characters. However, 12 Kingdoms does very little explaining, which is both a blessing and a curse. It does not bore you with long explanations, but sometimes you have no idea what is going on. Instead of constantly rewinding throughout the series, I just continued to watch and for the most part everything became clear.

The characters themselves are introduced very unnaturally. Watching their interactions on earth before things start to get crazy, I highly doubt anyone would be reminded of anyone they actually know. Once in the other world, the series has some cheesy moments and the main character, Youko, starts out a very whiny one. Constantly bursting into tears and crying to go home, she can be a real annoyance. However, she undergoes a very thorough transformation which is quite fascinating and rewarding. One of the more interesting aspects of this part of the show is her verbal and mental battle with a crouching, mocking man that only she can see, while she sees visions of the truth she fears. (He reminded me a little of the Truth from Fullmetal Alchemist).

Though this part of the series takes a while to get going, it ends up being a fairly complete and fascinating story about what Youko learns about herself and the world she has traveled to. This section ends on a somewhat bittersweet note with one characters story still unresolved, but it is continued in Part 3.

(Note: Episode 14 is a recap episode. I recommend skipping it except for the very last scene, which is new).

PART 2 (EPISODES 15-21): Rating: 4/5
If you have ever heard anyone say that this anime ends right in the middle of the story, they are no doubt referring to only the second of the stories, as all the others seem perfectly complete to me.

This section tells an extremely slow-moving story about a boy, Taiki, who is actually a Kirin, one of the fantastical beings with the task of choosing a king for one particular country. The story details his childhood and gradual uncertainty as he must step into his role as a Kirin and choose a ruler. It is a fairly good story that gives a lot of insight into some of the creatures previously unexplored in Part 1, and it would have been fairly complete had it not been interrupted constantly by flashes forward into a continuation that would never take place in the anime. This continuation actually looks more interesting than the story at hand, and most of the details can be clarified by reading a quick summary online of the light novel The Shore at Twilight, the Sky at Daybreak (there is no English language publication of the book). However, Taikis story is still unfinished even in the books.

Because this story doesnt ultimately go anywhere and doesnt connect with the rest of the series very much at all, these episodes can be completely skipped. But I found what there was of this story to be really enjoyable and interesting, and it added another layer to the world of the 12 kingdoms.

(Note: Episode 21 is a recap episode. It is a little more interesting and informative than the first recap episode, and so it may be helpful if you haven't kept up with some of the names and details so far. However, this too can be skipped, though I once again recommend watching the last scene).

PART 3: EPISODES 23-39: Rating: 5/5
This part of the series follows the journeys of three separate girls, one of which is Youko, the protagonist of Part 1, who continues to become an increasingly awesome and well-developed character. This part of the series really shines as it tells the stories of all three of these characters slowly and thoroughly, with much suspense and some wonderful character development. These characters are not perfect by any means; in fact, they can all be dislikable sometimes. But you cant help but take an interest in their stories, especially as they all converge. This story is really about how these characters suffering and experiences transform them in both good and bad ways according to their own reactions to what happens to them.

The plot itself is complex and builds up to the final climatic battle that was missing from Part 1. Combining this with the thorough and relatable character arcs, this is really the best part of the series.

(Note: Episode 31 is something of a recap episode, but it is not skippable because it has some new scenes, though parts of it could be fast-fowarded).

PART 4 (Episodes 41-45): Rating: 5/5
The last episodes of this series tell a short story about two secondary characters. Dont be expecting another grand finale to the series, as this story could have been inserted at almost anytime throughout and episode 39 is as close to a finale as you're going to get (and its a good one, too). But this is really a great, complete story that shouldnt be missed. It introduces a couple of new, interesting characters, while bringing back some of the great minor ones from earlier episodes. Once again, character development shines.

(Note: Episode 45 is yet another recap episode that can be easily skipped. But I definitely recommend watching the very last scene).

OVERALL RATING: 4.5/5
12 Kingdoms isn't for everyone. If unfinished stories are a pet peeve of yours, by all means skip Part 2. But if you enjoy sitting through long, slow character and world development, then give this ultimately rewarding series a watch.",1447891200,,7864,4.796159527326441
