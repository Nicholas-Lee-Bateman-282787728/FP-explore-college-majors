8016898,5,B0001WHUGE,"One of the funniest British comedies I've seen, and I've pretty much seen them all. The characters more than carry the show with their lovable and highly dysfuntional personas. If you enjoy humor 'British style', this series will not dissappoint.",1346889600,,246,5.175
8016899,1,B0001WHUGE,"This rating is only to alert to possible listing error, not the Black Book series itself.

I ordered this title used from Caiman.com. Before ordering I specifically checked for the Region and Format since other Black Book offerings are for Region 2 and PAL format.

I'm not certain at the moment whether a U.S. version actually exists. I used Caiman.com's on on-line service to print a postage-paid mail label and returned it.  I received a credit within a couple weeks.  Caiman.com is an awesome seller, and I highly recommend them, especially for used CDs and DVDs.",1147219200,3,567,4.875
