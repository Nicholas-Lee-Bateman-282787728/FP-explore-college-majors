8531172,3,B008VR7U66,"This film is NOTHING whatsoever like Akira Kurosawa's Seven Samurai, except for the trivial facts that it's in black and white, involves Samurai, and has a big battle scene at the end.  It has all of the strutting Samurai egoism of this genre of Japanese films, conforms to period conventions and involves some of the prominent actors of the 1960s, but none who appear in Kurosawa films.

The bad guy is a real jerk, the sole female player is very pretty, and the convoluted plot is hard to follow without a map.  As you should expect there is a lot of hacking, slicing, stabbing and blood spilled all over the place.  In one scene a Lord orders six men to commit suicide and they all start to do it before he tells them he was he was just checking how loyal they were.  They almost seemed disappointed at losing the opportunity to demonstrate their stupidity.

The psychopath brother of the shogun kills a peasant on the land of the Abe clan, merely for crossing in front of him.  He is chastised for the killing by the Lord of the clan whereupon he kills the Lord with an arrow in his eye.  Shogun officials cover the incident up and blame the Lord whose land had been trespassed upon and order the Abe clan to be abolished.  Abe clan retainers are given 30 days to accept this.

Several of the clan retainers vow to kill the nutcase brother.  The plot takes various twists and turns, failed attempts, close calls, the shogun rescinds the abolition of the Abe clan at the last minute but it still ends in a massive battle climax that, like Seven Samurai's epic battle, occurs in a driving rainstorm (minus the horses).

The closest comparison with other films would be 13 Assassins, but the filming is nowhere near as good and the transfer is mediocre.  There are too many shots of brooding and posturing Samurai, typical Japanese overacting (in western eyes), lots of shouting, grunting, slashing, hacking and improbable sword fight scenes where dozens of men get chopped up for no good reason.

On the other hand, the Japanese scenery is beautiful if poorly filmed and much of the individual acting is good.  If you understand and appreciate this genre it would be worth having in your collection but its far from the best example.  It's a typical Samurai B movie.",1353024000,24,2268,4.604477611940299
