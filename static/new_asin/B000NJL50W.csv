8178596,1,B000NJL50W,"Interested in hearing all the pro and con arguments concerning the authenticity of the Shroud of Turin, I bought this video expecting to gain pertinent information and possibly a coherent case for either position. Instead, I was presented with a video that was painful to watch. Lightly touching on or entirely omitting relevant scientific facts and heavy on personal speculation, the video is somewhat of an audio competition between rock music and the narrator's rambling conjectures to promote his altered state of self-consciousness theory. I couldn't help but feel that all the songs and digitally manipulated imagery were intended to entice the uninformed and distract from the weakness of the argument. If you fancy connecting Judeo-Christian religious icons to the sun god and spiritual enlightenment through circular logic and supposition, you'll love it. If you want insightful scientific details concerning the religious relics and their history, you probably want to look elsewhere.",1394236800,,994,5.546052631578948
8178597,5,B000NJL50W,"It's fascinating to look at what have long been considered religious symbols and look at them from different points of view. When you are not stuck in the ""box"" of a confining religion a great deal of things become much clearer in their significance. Highly recommended.",1374883200,,270,4.891304347826087
8178598,4,B000NJL50W,"Philip Gardiner skillfully blends history, spirituality, tradition, religion and myth in an engaging exploration of the Ark and Mary's shroud.  I visited Turin several years ago and have always been fascinated by the idea of the shroud.  This is a new, global take on this iconic symbol.",1206057600,,287,5.085106382978723
8178599,5,B000NJL50W,"Philip Gardiner takes viewers on a moving trek through cathedrals in England to Mount Sinai in his quest to identify similarities in the Ark of the Covenant, the Shroud, and Mary.  Gardiner makes some curious observations about secret societies and mystics.  He discusses the historical journey of the Ark of the Covenant and reveals theories that challenge whether it ever existed; yet, he also points out historical evidence supporting its existence, possibly in Ethiopia. The imagery in this documentary is beautiful and Gardiner elaborates on the ""altered state of consciousness"" that comes with spiritual enlightenment.  This DVD covers a lot of ground and all of it is interesting!",1205625600,,687,5.342592592592593
8178600,5,B000NJL50W,"Already having been a Gardiner fan even though my faith differs, I was excited to watch this DVD and he did not disappoint.  He facts were clear and interesting.  His passion for the subject made for an interesting documentary type film with great sights as well as information.  Great to watch!",1204070400,,295,4.745098039215686
8178601,4,B000NJL50W,"Author and filmmaker, Phillip Gardiner takes you around the world in an attempt to show the relationship between the Ark of the Covenant, the Shroud, and the importance of Mary. Gardiner is in his element linking these entities to secret societies and brotherhoods such as the Knights Templar.",1201219200,,293,5.125
8178602,1,B000NJL50W,"Dont bother.  This book was a total bore and where logic didn't work, confusion was the tactic.",1191196800,,95,4.588235294117647
8178603,1,B000NJL50W,"Tell me they're joking, the earlier reviewers.  This DVD is a dreadful piece of work.

Gardiner's arguments are all over the place, and time after time he makes assertions without any evidence at all, then treats them as fact.

As for the production, it's so OTT it's laughable, with the ridiculous over-use of jangling artwork and the music frequently drowning out the speech (though maybe that's not such a bad thing!).

Bad, bad, bad.  Save your money.  Avoid.",1185148800,,463,4.871794871794871
8178604,5,B000NJL50W,"As something of an expert in Sufi tradition I was surprised to see Gardiner speak about them in the book of the same name and equally surprised to find that what he had to say made complete sense. I was expecting some kind of fantastical concept of aliens or batteries and yet what I discovered was common sense missed by everyone. Suitably impressive is an understatement for this DVD, whereas exceptional entertainment and information equally does not seem to do it justice. A clever film that makes you seriously think and nice in these days of What the Bleep nonsense.",1175731200,3,572,4.73
