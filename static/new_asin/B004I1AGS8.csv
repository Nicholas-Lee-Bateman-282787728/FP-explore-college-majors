4381540,3,B004I1AGS8,"I can't really rate this product as the inconsiderate people at Amazon fail to let you know it doesn't come with subtitles, and I don't speak Spanish, so I missed the intricacies of the plot.  Fortunately I had read the reviews in advance so I had a vague idea of the plot and was sort of able to piece it together.  If you don't speak Argentinian Spanish fluently, don't rent this film.",1379030400,11,387,4.361111111111111
8429820,3,B004I1AGS8,An OK film but certainly not the best when it comes to the subject of unsupervised teenagers acting up.  Actually the kids in this film are about as exciting as watching paint dry. Fortunately the DVD of this film I purchased has English subtitles whereas other reviewers complained that their versions had none. It really doesn't matter if there are subtitles or not as I don't expect to watch this movie again unless I'm so bored that even this film seems exciting.,1484352000,,467,4.695121951219512

8429822,5,B004I1AGS8,"A good movie  about a group of rich children and  the big diferences betwen them and a poor boy, i see as the meeting betwen two wolds  If you don't speak spanish you shuld get it with subtitles. I love this flims because is a portrait of a group of rich children in a vacation without supervision of any relative adult, only the servat that invites her young brother.... we can apreciate the freedom int he behavior of the children (that becomes as debauchery; a kiss betwen cousins, invasion to  anothers homes  )  and the retiring behavior of the poor boy, that also becomes in  debauchery, because he is trying to fit .. is a interesting study of children and society  with some sad and sweet taste  (sorry my bad english )",1462406400,,727,4.446969696969697

8429827,2,B004I1AGS8,"this movie made no sense to me. it was written and produced for adults apparently, not a kids movie although primarily acted by children. with that said, kids have little depth usually. this is surely the case here. i also don't buy the ""Lord of the Flies"" motif. surely children left alone have no more risk of becoming Vandals than this thought assumes.",1399939200,,355,4.650793650793651
8429828,2,B004I1AGS8,"I watched this movie on Amazon Instant Video and it is in Spanish with no English translation. However, I don't think an English translation would have been much help for most of the movie.
The movie takes place in an affluent gated and patrolled neighborhood. Several children are alone in a home in the neighborhood. One teenage boy joins the others during the movie and he has a long wait to get approval to pass the guarded gate. The children are seen going to and from school and the front of the school is seen. It to is gated with guards at the gate. The older children are in their late teens and therefore old enough to watch the younger ones.
For most of the movie the children just go about routine activities. They eat, they do household chores, they watch TV (I think one of the boys watches an adult movie, a woman's breast are seen briefly on TV in the background), they sleep, they attend school (they are only seen coming and going, not inside the school), they swim (both in the pool at the house and in a public pool which I believe was inside the gated neighbor), and they also occasionally have minor arguments among themselves.
For the most part they are well behaved, and responsible. I say for the most part because they do occasionally enter another house through an unlocked window. In one scene a couple of the teenagers in their mid teens start horsing around in the other house and the scene ends with them kissing each other. Apparently (or maybe I should say hopefully) they are not all siblings. Toward the end of the movie the older teens go to a party where they drink alcohol after which they go a little wild. It is around this point and just after that I believe an English translation would be the most helpful.",1395100800,7,1749,4.46875
8429829,2,B004I1AGS8,I am trying to learn Spanish and still need subtitles.  Even Spanish subtitles would help.  I have not finished the movie yet and will go  back and watch when I have learned more  Spanish.  I looks like it might get more interesting although it starts out boring.,1381622400,,263,4.51063829787234
