The songs are great too! Amol Palekar and Deena Pathak are superb! A simple love story and a classic comedy! Above all, this is probably one of the best performances by the legendary Utpal Dutta! What a versatile actor! Fans of Bengali movies/ theater, are well versed with his talent already and in our humble opinion, this particular movie amply spotlights Dutt's genius in other languages too! A tremendously talented actor, who probably, did not receive all that should have been due to him.

Would recommend! Arrived soon and well packed. Thank You!",1395878400,,718,4.744
