8015637,2,B0001OGV4O,"This DVD collection is cobbled together from movie serials, movies and old tv shows.  The Robin Hood episodes are from a British TV series from the 1950s are are well done.  The Long John Silver episodes star Robert Newton who reprises the title role fom the Disney movie from the 1950s.  The Tarzan movies are lesser, non-Johnny Weismuller movies that will appeal only to die-hard Tarzan fans.  Many of these Tarzan films are condensations from movie serials.  Tarzan and the Trappers is a failed TV pilot.  The Zorro serials are ""Zorro Returns"" and Zorro's Black Whip.""  These are great Republic pictures efforts that are must see viewing for both Zorro and serial fans.  All in all, this package is a mixed bag.  Video quality is rough.  This can be blamed on the age of the material.  It is clear no attempt has been made to restore the video.  Be warned that there is often a ""Bug"" in the lower right corner of the screen that says ""Platinum Disc Corporation.""  This is an annoying and a very stupid practice that thankfully has not been copied by any other DVD producer.  If I had known about this ""bug"" I would not have purchased this collection.",1079136000,2,1153,4.615763546798029
