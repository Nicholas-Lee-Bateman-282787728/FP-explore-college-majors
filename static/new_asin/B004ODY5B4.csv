But for those who aren't, Lee Morrison teaches a no BS approach to the knife problem. Everything is well thought out and based upon his real world knife experiences and through studying of trends of the knife man. I highly recommend this DVD.",1440115200,,347,4.704918032786885

Having reviewed numerous knife defense or counter-knife tactics, it is refreshing to see more reality based methods being taught today.  Lee Morrison is a combatives instructor from the United Kingdom.  His perspective is unique because in England, you cannot carry a gun or a knife for personal protection, and there are numerous knife attack incidents in the U.K.  This has forced people like Morrison to develop the most efficient and effective counter-knife tactics.

This two-disc set covers the basic principles and tactics to defend against an edged weapon.  He first explains that there is no such thing as a fool proof system and emphasizes that if someone is really trained in using a knife, there is going to be a big problem.  Nevertheless, he has created an effective system to counter a knife attack.  The three scenarios he teaches include: Body language cues of the attacker attempting to get his knife into play, dealing with the attacker who already has his knife out and dealing with an ambush or hold up situation.

He moves into understanding the concept based system and explains various physical drills to deal with the above three scenarios.  He teaches the consequences of a knife attack and the offensive use of the knife.  He only covers three basic angles of attack which makes his knife counter system simple to understand and apply in realistic drills.

In Disc two he emphasizes three principles in dealing with an attacker who already has his knife out.  They are: Escape, if at all possible.  Equalize, pick up a bar stool or anything that you can place between you and the knife attacker.  Eliminate, this has to deal  with the mind-set you must have to take out your attacker.

In conclusion, this DVD would be of interest to martial artists, police instructors, combatives instructors and anyone who desires to learn a practical and effective knife counter system.
