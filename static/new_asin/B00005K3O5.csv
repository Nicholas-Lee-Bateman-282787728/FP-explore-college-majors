1616296,2,B00005K3O5,"Of all the bad Larry Buchanan movies ever made, this is one of them.  And, sadly enough, this may be his best.
Martians Tommy Kirk and Company, in vacuformed bodysuits with ""boing"" antennae, announce to the Pentagon that Mars needs women.  When America refuses to cooperate by providing a few suitable single females, Kirk and Crew baldly state that they will simply do their own informal poll and take some girls on the sly.  The Secretary of State informs the public that Martian kidnappers are on the move, and creates a think-tank to deal with the problem.  One of the think-tank's members, space geneticist Yvonne Craig, falls into Kirk's sights as a perfect inductee for the Martian breeding program  -  and, unaware that Kirk is in fact one of the Martians she is working against, she falls for him while he is in undercover guise.
This is one of the weirdest movies ever made.  It isn't a comedy, nor does it try to be one.  That it isn't good goes without saying  -  but it's really not that bad, either.  Strangely enough, the script would actually have worked, if given a halfway decent production.  It's all played serious as a heart attack, and only the incredibly cheap production values, drastically overused stock-footage padding, and a lack of rehearsal that make the performances come off as first dress night at the local community theater kill it.  It's got virtually no entertainment value, and yet the seriousness with which the story is undertaken almost hypnotically holds your attention.  It's sometimes amusing  -  and even interesting  -  in spite of itself.

This bit of drivel however was actually physicaly draining! After you pick apart the duct tape and peeling spray paint on the martians ""uniforms"", and laugh at the incredibly fake spaceship, and after you realize that the actors couldn't even get jobs as extras in soap operas, you still have an hour of the film to go!!! I ended up watching most of this film on fast forward, just stopping when it appeared that some sort of plot point might of been developing.(no such luck in most cases)

""It's only three words.... Mars Needs Women""
Well there you go, how's that for a plot? In the tradition of horrible 1960's B horror movies, this one is down with the Mushroom People, Sub-par Frankenstein movies, and King Kong versus Godzilla.
Anyway Mars needs to repopulate the planet because all their females died from a 'sickness'. They contact Earth and offer to purchase some, but of course our brave, nerdy scientists refuse. So now Mars is planning on an invasion to kidnap some earthly mates. I won't give away the ending, but you'll probably fall asleep half way through it and not even care. This was just bad.

I couldn't turn away! it just gets worse and worse! Men glare at hot young things and strippers twirl, but the fun is just beginning, cuz MARS NEEDS WOMEN!!!
The only thing I didn't like about the dvd itself is that the transfer is pretty bad. Not up to par with the only midnight movies that have been released in the series. It is only in pan and scan which for once is fine with me, cuz I didn't need to see the ample body parts of the women all over the screen. There wasn't a trailer.

1616371,1,B00005K3O5,"I will admit right away that the main reason I paid to see this film was because of beautiful Yvonne Craig. I am not faulting Ms Craig in any way. She was easily the highlight of this 'movie'. I knew it was going to be a very shoestring budgeted movie that would have terrible special effects. I even saw the trailer for it on youtube. So, it's my own fault for getting this movie in the first place. But I have to honestly admit that the ONLY thing that saved this movie in any way was Yvonne Craig. She was the only believable actress in the entire movie. It was slower paced than most any movie I have ever tried to sit through. With some simple but careful editing, the running time of this movie could be cut from 90 minutes to about 30 minutes without missing any major plot points at all. I can't believe this movie is even considered to be a 'cult classic' in any way. If you are a Yvonne Craig fan like me you can certainly choose to purchase this mess of a movie but it's just as well watching her on Batman. She even wears her hair exactly the same as she does as Barbara Gordon in Batman. Only in Batman she turns into the gorgeous form-fitting 'Batgirl' who is very pleasing to the eyes rather than this complete mess of a film. Be your own judge if you want but I would say don't bother with this one. It wasn't even worth the lousy $5.00 I spent to purchase it.",1417305600,,1376,4.157303370786517

1616375,4,B00005K3O5,"In reading some of the reviews, it's obvious to me that naysayers are totally missing the boat - or spaceship - on a movie like MARS NEEDS WOMEN (Azalea Film Co., 1967). Who would ever go into this Z-grade sci-fi flick expecting it to be something more than what it is? Kept in the right context, this thing's a lot of fun - the kind of ""don't take it too seriously"" mindset that today's film industry is incapable of producing anymore. It seems that nowadays every movie - no matter how silly it REALLY is - tries to masquerade as being oh so relevant to the point of nausea. Audiences accustomed to inflated budgets, inflated star egos, inflated running times, and inflated special effects expect a movie to have an inflated storyline as well. In the 1960's there were still some movies that were made to just lay back with and enjoy. People knew MARS NEEDS WOMEN wasn't meant to be thought of in the same league as a big, serious production from a major studio. Today, people are so 'sophisticated' that they can't tell the difference.

The plot of MARS NEEDS WOMEN is about a group of horny aliens who come to Earth in search of fertile females to take back to Mars. That's it??? Yep, that's it. Sorry to disappoint all you message-seeking intellectuals. Now that I've succeeded in 'alienating' about 75% of my readers, I can say to the rest of you that this movie's main attraction is Yvonne Craig as a brainy, bespectacled babe who is endeared to fans as Batgirl from the iconic '60's BATMAN TV show. The main Martian is played by teen heart-throb Tommy Kirk, whose deadpan earnestness works toward, rather than against the premise. There's some priceless unintentional humor throughout, particularly in the exchanges between the sarcastic TV newsman and the harrassed NASA Colonel. The stock ""computer communications"" sound effect that's laid over shots of famous world landmarks as news of the aliens spreads is hilarious. The best scene is at a press conference where Craig, the only woman present, becomes irritated with the sexist cracks of the reporters and threatens to end the interview if they persist.

Besides Craig, there's other comely maidens galore which, after all, is the whole point of this drive-in cult classic.  It's supposed to be a cool combination of '60's sci-fi and go-go girls. The shoestring budget that writer/director Larry Buchanan was working with (the film was shot in 16mm) prohibited elaborate sets and special effects, necessitating location photography in and around Houston, Texas. This gives MARS NEEDS WOMEN a great nostalgic feel and captures the era in authentic detail, a characteristic akin to many cheapies. The effects definitely are cheap, but they work with the tone of the film. As zany as it is, MARS NEEDS WOMEN contains some genuinely interesting scientific rhetoric, and manages to put across a poignancy regarding the budding but ultimately doomed relationship between Craig and Kirk that isn't out of place.

MGM Entertainment's DVD of MARS NEEDS WOMEN is gorgeous, fully reproducing the original color saturation of the 16mm stock. For those of you ""broad"" minded enough to enjoy this type of campy fare, you won't be sorry. It only improves on repeated viewings. It's no 2001: A SPACE ODYSSEY to be sure, but MARS NEEDS WOMEN is its own psychedelic trip that can be appreciated from the other end of the ever wide sci-fi spectrum.

1616378,3,B00005K3O5,"Larry Buchanan, the maker of the movie, sent me a letter concerning it after I discussed it on my Yvonne Craig fan site. His letter reads in part: ""American International pictures contracted me to deliver (as writer, director, producer) twelve Z-grade flicks, these to be churned out between my serious works. Each picture was budgeted at $30,000 script to screen!! (color, two young leads from Hollywood, feature length, shooting schedule, 9 days!) All of the pictures were profitable but the smash was 'Mars Needs Women'! Was it my contributions? Tommy Kirk as lead? The sci-fi genre? None of these. It was the classy, professional, elegant sex appeal of Yvonne Craig. While chaos swirled around her, she just flashed those beautiful green eyes and embraced her role like it was from Arthur Miller or Tennessee Williams. I adored her."" Martians, led by Kirk, come to Earth in search of females to help repopulate Mars. Yvonne Craig plays Dr. Marjorie Bolen, a gerontologist who is abducted by Kirk. Craig agreed to be in the film in part because they gave her a free trip to Dallas (where it was filmed), home to her family.",1326844800,2,1126,4.869791666666667

1616412,1,B00005K3O5,"The Mars Needs Women plot line builds a lightning quick romance between Mars man Dop, Tommy Kirk and Earth woman Dr. Bowen, Yvonne Craig.  A background premise of a 100-1 boy to girl lopsided birth ratio catastrophe (except for the girls of course) occurring back on Mars explains why there are 5 Martians on Earth and also gives the movie its name.  There is abduction of potential childbearing women, a man hunt, or Martian hunt depending on how you look at it, outrage over the Martian designs to steel off with Earth women, etc., etc...

It's just too damn serious.  I wasn't expecting that at all.

With a Title like ""Mars Needs Women"", ca-maaannn!  Lighten up.  I was expecting to see something like 40 or 50 horney Martian guys chasing after 1960s type sexy Earth chicks, accompanied by the quintessential garbage head or two buffooning around and adding to the laughs. Instead I get Yvonne Craig, a righteous dish herself, giving a not too shabby early 1960s lecture on the intricacies of DNA structure.  She was also the cutest thing in the movie.  Bubbles Cash wasn't too bad either.

I had a friend who used to say about movies ""If its stupid and its meant to be stupid, I can live with that. But if its stupid and its meant to be serious, I want to blow it up with a bazooka.""

1616413,1,B00005K3O5,"Now, what would really happen if a group of humanoid young men from Mars came to Earth to find female immigrants?  Wouldn't about a million hopefuls get in line?  The whole affair could run on TV as a reality show called Space Bachelor.  Of course, in this movie, it's rather befuddling as to just what fate awaits these women.  Are they to be mates of the particular travelers, sex partners of other (maybe many) Martians, or subjects of artificial insemination and experimentation?  These fourth-planet guys don't even seem to know whether they are to be snatched indiscriminately or chosen by appearance, assumption of fertility, personality, and/or smarts.  They must have initially figured they'd just grab a few gals and go, but somehow the beaming up didn't work.  The audience is never told why--whether the subjects disintegrated, got their molecules stewed with those of starlings, or were just beamed aboard dead.  So, the boys have to come down and walk the Earth, and--guess what--they end up acting just like Terran males, wasting time watching football, ogling an exotic dancer, and following a flight attendant.  One of them happens upon an excellent choice--a young, beautiful, brilliant astro-geneticist (whom the editorial review identifies as a reporter!)  But, instead of inviting her to Mars, he dillydallies around, going to a planetarium and other frivolities.  And, are the inhabitants of Terra terrified that nubile natives are being seized for probable ravishment on the red planet?  Not so much.  The cops surmise that any girl who goes missing must be an abductee.  But is the National Guard swarming over the streets?  Is martial law declared?  Are likely prospects for transport huddling in their homes?  Naw.  Pretty damsels are engaged in such perilous pursuits as sitting on the sidewalk drawing trees--and the attention of a Martian.  Not surprisingly, the choices are sixties sexual icons: a stewardess, stripper, beauty queen, and co-ed (i.e. advocate of free love).  As either intentional or unintentional parody, this feature is a total flop.  It's flat, boring, and unfunny.  The director apparently had one objective: beat in time for 80 minutes.  Otherwise, the outcome looks as if a camera operator was instructed to follow the noise and film whatever was making it.  But one space opera objective WAS achieved: these aliens come off as complete creeps!",1247443200,,2396,5.195822454308094
1616414,4,B00005K3O5,"Is Tommy Kirk wasted here? Yes.

1616415,1,B00005K3O5,"As every other reviewer of this says, it is terrible.  Terrible.  Not scary but horrendous.  A waste of film, film-developing chemicals, editing time, and even the time of filming it.  It's a wonder film projectors didn't, and DVD players don't, refuse to play it as a matter of self-respect.

But, not to worry: no good actors are wasted in it.  And I don't feel any pity for Tommy Kirk: there's no evidence that he was forced to participate in this: he did it voluntarily.  In fact, he should be jailed for life for allowing the use of his name to entice moviegoers to spend their hard-earned quarters to see this when it first escaped quarantine.

But none of that should matter: buy it, pop up a HUGE amount of popcorn -- 4-5 times the usual amount -- and FORCE yourself to sit through this.  I promise you'll enjoy throwing the popcorn at the screen; just don't throw a whole bowl at a time.

I give this one star because the only other options, which are criminally unacceptable, are to give it two, if one is snidely hostile, three, if one is petulant and nasty, four, if one is a sadomasochistic sociopath, or five, if one is hoping to be assassinated.",1231632000,,1160,4.480952380952381
1616416,1,B00005K3O5,"When the first minute of the movie involves a bad trick-cut of a woman disappearing during a tennis match, you know you're in for it.

I admit I have seen this movie twice.  Not because it was actually a good movie- far from it!- but because I felt the need to spread the joy to my friends; the joy that is Tommy Kirk's alien colleague explaining, completely deadpan, how great it would be for their woman-finding mission if one of the candidates was well-versed in sex and genetics, 'both fundamentally and as it applies to space!'

I give this one star because z-movies deserve nothing more.  If they are truly classics, as this one's title suggests, one star is a badge of honour.  MNW does not dissappoint in the cheese department and I was cackling out loud through most of it (and howling by the climax).

WARNING: Lots of stock footage here, folks.  Many Amazon viewers have mentioned how completely boring this movie was, most of which was due to a tiny tic in the director's brain that must have repeated to him over and over: ""I've got ten minutes of footage of a plane taking off, and by gum, I'm going to USE it!!""

  The premise, title, acting, plot and dialogue completely make up for this in my opinion, but feel free to fast-forward through the following scenes:

-The strip-tease that isn't really

-Hypnotization! (actually all the hypnotizing made me want to fall asleep)

-Another strip-tease

-A large part of a football game

-Any scene with a plane

The sad thing is, there is some sub-decent acting and intruiging symbolism buried under all the nonsense and wonderfully horrendous exposition.  However, the plot goes all over the place and can't decide whether its own characters are rapists, lechers or just lonely, and ends up being all three at times(creepily enough).

Yes, it might be a little slow in patches, but those priding themselves on B-movie stamina should definitely take this one for a ride.  All the elements are here: Laughably quotable dialogue, wooden acting, bizarre views on sex (all the more intruiging considering the lead, Tommy Kirk, was ousted from Disney for being supposedly gay), questionable science, misplaced 'drama', clumsy editing, bizarre leaps of logic not seen since 'Plan 9', huge gaping plot holes, bad special effects, incredible amounts of pure Swiss cheese and a phrase to rival that of ""Soylent green is people"" in terms of yelling value.

1616417,1,B00005K3O5,"I picked up ""Mars Needs Women"" recently but wish I would have checked the negative Amazon reviews before doing so, because this is a REALLY bad movie, and not in the good way.

Some movies are technically bad but fun nevertheless and highly entertaining. ""Village of the Giants"" is an excellent example of this (some would cite ""Plan 9 from Outer Space"" as another good example but I disagree; ""Plan 9"" is not so bad it's good, it's so bad it's BAD!). ""Village of the Giants"" possesses a wealth of great scenes highlighted by quite a few cute girls; it is therefore very worthwhile.

""Mars Needs Women"" would seem to be a movie of the same caliber for a few reasons: 1.) The name itself, 2.) the backcover description: ""WARNING: Sex-Starved Spacemen on the Prowl for Bodacious Babes!"" (which, of course, gives the impression that the flick will be full of bodacious babes), 3.) the casting of Tommy Kirk, who also stars in ""Village of the Giants,"" and particularly 4.) the casting of Yvonne Craig.

The fact that Yvonne stars in ""Mars"" was the clincher for me to pick it up. Unfortunately Yvonne doesn't really appear until 45 minutes into the picture (!) and you don't ONCE see her dressed in those alluring, skimpy, tight costumes that she wears in ""Batman"" as Batgirl or in Star Trek's ""Whom Gods Destroy.""

Is the film worth picking up to catch a few nice glimpses of some other notable 60's babes? Unfortunately no. A few scenes depict a Martian ogling a cute stripper, but these scenes are certainly not worth buying the movie for (or investing your time).

As for the production, sets and directing, you'd see better filmmaking by simply watching an episode of ""I Dream of Jeanie."" Not to mention that the dialogue is atrocious and the storytelling dreadfully boring -- filled with numerous scenes of stock footage. In fact, in the first half hour you would think that the paging speaker at the Airbase is a starring cast member.

I admit that I laughed out loud a few times because of how godawful this stinker is, so it may be worthwhile for this alone; other than that AVOID LIKE THE PLAGUE!",1098230400,7,2101,4.649595687331536

There are movies like Monster-a-Go-Go that are so bad they're simply torture.  But Mars Needs Women is a whole new kind of bad: it's a movie which is so incredibly boring that you'll need some heavy stimulants to stay awake through it all.  This film is only for the hardest of the hard-core bad movie buffs, and the only reason to watch it is to say that you did.  If you're in this category, my advice is to watch it for 20 minutes, do something else more interesting (you won't have any trouble finding something -- even staring off into space would do it) and then watch another 20 minutes etc. until you're done with it.  I give it one extra star because I actually liked what little plot there was -- properly edited, it would have made a decent half-hour movie.  I sleep now.",1092528000,7,916,4.321637426900585

First the Martians attempt to teleport some women but that is unsuccessful (we never find out what happened to them).  Now they are arriving in person.  While they wanted healthy and cooperative volunteers, the short press of time forces them to use hypnosis.
Teen idol Tommy Kirk is the Martian Leader.  Plans are going well until Tommy runs into a woman scientist played by Yvonne Craig (Batgirl).  It is them that he realizes that even though his race is dying, women are not enough.  There must also be love.  It is this love that causes the return of the other women as the Martians leave just ahead of the military.
This almost thoughtful film brings to mind This Island Earth where aliens use humans to save their civilization but stop for issues of conscience and morals.  The title of this film leads one to expect something a little more sensationalistic than thoughtful, but they would be disappointed.
The film was shot with an obviously small budget, but the plot and acting are respectable.  At one point you may even wonder why a certain loudspeaker did not get a mention in the credits as it is filmed almost like a central character for awhile.

The story, such as it: the Martians (who look suspicious like men with a Spandex fetish) have run out of women, so they nip next door in a spaceship that looks like an over-decorated pie pan to borrow a few.  Now, it happens that the ones they want lack brains, beauty, and God knows they lack acting talent, so you'd think Earth would be glad to see them go.  But no, Earth gets offended; the Martians decide to take 'em anyway; hostilities ensue.  Whoop-De-Doo.

Briniging to mind the work of a young Howard Hawks, the breathtaking scope of this feature leaves this reviewer baffled as to the lack of attention it received from that year's Academy Awards - perhaps the consequence of being light years ahead of its time in both theme and content. Even so, the incredible, timeless cinematography should have made it a cast-iron certainty for recognition.

Perhaps it was also a consequences of the Academy's well-known reluctance to recognise comedic brilliance, as few films can have tickled the ribs of so many as this work of outstanding genius.

I reccommend this film strongly to anyone with a genuine love of avant-garde cinema, and anyone who wants to see a sure fire winner for all the family.

Until the movie ""Man Conquers Space"" comes out, we have ""Mars Needs Women"".",1429401600,2,961,4.835365853658536
