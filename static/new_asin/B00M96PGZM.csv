8670823,5,B00M96PGZM,"Having taped this BBC six-hour documentary on my VHS when it was originally broadcast in 1967, I was delighted to find this 2 DVD set. Not only are the VHS tapes bulky but are disintegrating so to find them on disc was a ""bonanza.""  The one hour segments are: Episode #:1: ""The Birth of a Titan"" which tells about RKO being founded and includes footage and interviews from ""King Kong."" Episode #2: ""Let's Face the Music and Dance"" focuses on the unmatched series of Astaire/Rogers musicals and includes interviews with Fred Astaire, Ginger Rogers, Hermes Pan and Pandro Berman. Episode #3: ""A Woman's Lot"" concentrates of some of RKO's major female stars including Ginger Rogers and Katherine Hepburn. Episode #4: ""It's All True"" examines the War Years, film noir and the ensuing Hollywood Blacklist. Episode #5: ""Dark Victory "" features some of the classic dramatic films the studio produced and Episode #6: ""Howards Way"" is about the films of Howard Hughes, Jane Russell and the end of RKO. Ed Asner is the narrator and the series takes us into the soundstages, storage rooms and vaults which are now part of Paramount's Hollywood property. I find that this series is one of a kind and the DVD resolution is excellent.",1412294400,4,1220,4.837320574162679
