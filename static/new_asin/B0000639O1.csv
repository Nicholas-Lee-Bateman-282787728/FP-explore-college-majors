The teaching plans etc. were good, however, I'm not sure that they were worth the $30.00.",1172534400,,250,4.767441860465116

7958811,4,B0000639O1,"I recently purchased this DVD. As a new teacher, I found this to be an exciting, dynamic and engaging teaching tool. The performances helped my students understand the text and the interactive menus and DVD-ROM extras made my life easy...lesson plans, quizzes...a literary terms glossary! The commentary was also very helpful. I highly recommend this to both students and teachers alike.",1017964800,17,387,5.360655737704918

7958813,4,B0000639O1,"I found this to be an excellent condensed version of the play. I've never seen a DVD like this. It has a wonderful feature that allows you to jump to the text of the scene you are watching to look up words and phrases and back again. The video commentary is very insightful and useful. The DVD ROM extras are well thought out and organized. This thing is like a 21st century ""Cliff's notes"". Great for anyone studying this play in a literature class.",1017360000,5,450,4.369047619047619
