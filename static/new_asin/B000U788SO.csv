8739230,1,B000U788SO,"I've been doing dance dvds since I've got a barbie vhs one when I was 8. This is by far the worse I've got. I've done Hi-Lo before at the gym. the moves were hard unless you've done dane before. The music was too soft and Rob Gllick w as soft spoken without showing any energy. After 15 minutes I stopped it. If you want a dance dvd, i recommand a Richard Simmons one. Do not purchase this. It's a waste of money. Mine's going in the trash.",1249689600,,440,4.011363636363637
