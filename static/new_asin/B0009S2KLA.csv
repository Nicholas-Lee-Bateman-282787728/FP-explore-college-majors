8384219,4,B0009S2KLA,"There has been many anime that fall into the ""girls with guns"" category like Noir and Canaan, but they all seem to have two girls as the main characters. This show is different because the main character is a young man instead. He is known as Zwei and is thrust into the dark world of crime and assassination. His partner is a girl known as Ein, who is a very quiet and cute character, much like Rei Ayanami or Yuki Nagato, but very deadly.

This release is only 3 episodes long and is based on a visual novel game much like other anime like Fate Stay Night or Shuffle. The anime is fine, but is made obsolete by the redundant sounding TV series known as Phantom Requiem for Phantom. This is the same series, but is 26 episodes and looks a lot better. This other anime series is distributed by Funimation and is under their Anime S.A.V.E. line, which means you can get it for a very low price now. However, this product, Phantom the Animation, is distributed by Media Blasters. There is nothing wrong with this release; its just that this is a very short series, and you should probably get the TV series. Personally, I received this series second after I received the other series because I wanted to see the difference. I was not even aware of this product until I finished watching the TV series, and was just researching the title after finishing it.

In conclusion, a fine series, but get the other one if you have the option.",1380844800,,1431,4.437262357414449
8384220,3,B0009S2KLA,"We were in a funk because we had just finished the Samurai Champloo series, and were searching for something to feed our anime addiction.  For the past couple of years we've been hooked on Noir, Madlax, Fruits Basket, Saiyuki, R.O.D. and Cowboy Bebop.  Phantom is similar to other anime in the chick assasin genre, particularly Kite.  The pre-release reviews were good.  We were pleasantly surprised by Phanton, and thought it deserved the write-up.",1141603200,4,449,5.109589041095891
