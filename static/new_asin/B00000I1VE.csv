7909325,5,B00000I1VE,"of Goddesses Hekate,Lilith,Fergie of Black-Eyed Peas,The Morrigan (Diana..)and The Cailleach comes this life-changingly narrated conversation with the soul danced by Nancy Allison and others.""Ophelia"" my personal favorite--speaks to my soul in ways that remind me of the destruction I could have wrought as a troubled beyond repair almost teenager--Of the loss,life,triumph of love we see in ""Passage""--A dance that's ""part two"" almost of ""Ophelia"". Nancy Allison's ""baton carrying"" legacy of being Jean Erdman's dance interpreter in main--Relieves our soul--As past legacies have been used to only highlight the life of it's current torch bearer in ANY field. We see joy and are so happy when ""the sheer joy of movement"" as Erdman talks about in this film--Is evidenced in Nancy's graceful movements. We are reminded in watching her dance with this joy that it IS possible to love with no ulterior motive--Watching another person be simply free--to love and enjoy life without us there--PURE unadulterated Love with no thought of self--Evident this attitude will be brought out of you when you watch such pieces as ""Creature on a Journey"" and the erotically tinged ""Hamadryad""--An ode in my mind--to sheer inherent womaNly strength.""Medusa""--Danced by Muna Tseng--Reflects fantastically the narrative of Erdman when she says that Medusa ""Rages across the universe"" because the ""positive life energy was never fulfilled""..So fantastic and worth the money. John Cage has some wonderful piano pieces that go with some of these dances. His use of nuts and bolts inside of a piano in ""Daughters of the Lonesome Aisle"" make the piano sound like an exotic oriental instrument. Peace on all of you!",1277510400,,1691,5.360902255639098
