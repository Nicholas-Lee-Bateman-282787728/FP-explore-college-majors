5968256,5,B00F6IMD4C,"I have to say that I enjoyed the last part of this series.  The animation, particularly regarding the fight scenes, was crisp, fluid and incredibly well-rendered. The new characters, particularly Suguha, were charming and have been fun to watch. I believe one of my favorite moments in this arc is when all of the allies Kirito's gained in throughout his journey in Alfheim amass and combat the Guardian Knights so that he could  reach Asuna. The last couple of episodes also evoke the most emotional intensity when you witness the culmination of Kirito's struggles to save Asuna; at least in my opinion.  You can't help but feel happiness once you see them reunited.

I honestly can't wait until Season 2 is animated and we can begin the Gun Gale Online saga.",1397433600,,760,4.778625954198473
5968257,5,B00F6IMD4C,I love anime. SAO is one of my favorite one shows. I love them as fairies. this show was amazing.,1396915200,3,97,3.9
5968258,4,B00F6IMD4C,"Now, I've never read the light novels that this anime was based on so this review is completely on what I thought about the anime itself and not how the anime compared to the novels.

I'm also going to the separate the anime into two parts based on the world the characters were in - Sword Art Online (SAO) and ALfheim.

I absolutely love the SAO part. Only a select number of people get to play the game, and much to their surprise, they're trapped until someone beats it. No logging out and no turning the console off. Twist? You die in the game, you die for real. It's essentially a death match against the game itself and the other players which gives a whole sense of danger and despair. 5 stars.

Now we all know the main characters are going to live; I've seen very few animes where the main character(s) are killed off. So, I don't really consider this next part a spoiler, but anyway...

*SPOILER!!*

Of course, Kirito wins the game and everyone wakes up, yay, right? Wrong. Kirito wakes up, along with most of the other players, but the girl of his dreams, Asuna, is still sleeping. Which brings me to the second part of the anime - ALfheim.

Now I didn't enjoy ALfheim nearly as much as SAO. Without wanting to give any major spoilers, I'll just summarize what happens when Kirito wakes up and finds Asuna - some madman has her trapped in a birdcage in another virtual world called ALfheim so Kirito has to save her so she can wake up. For me, the second part of the anime is where it kind of went downhill. It becomes very predictable; we all know Kirito is going to save her, save the day, etc. It's so predictable, you could probably skip the last ten episodes and guess how it ends. It becomes slightly disturbing; his little sister has some weird incest crush on him and to this day, I have no idea why incest is such a common theme in anime. And it becomes just downright silly. Fairies? No really, a world full of fairies? Maybe 3 stars for ALfheim.

I really like the idea behind this anime, but it isn't too original. The novel Ready Player One and the .//hack series both fit in the VRMMO genre and go into it a lot more in depth than SAO. Not to mention, typical anime cliches are flung everywhere! The main character is extremely overpowered, well-liked by all the girls, super modest, and whines on and on about how he will protect everyone and when he can't, he becomes super depressed about it. To make it even more anime-cliche, he's only 16 years old, yet he somehow saves everyone (Naruto, Bleach, and countless other animes, anyone?). Makes me wonder how the Japanese think teenagers should be haha.

It's more of 3.5 stars than 4 stars due to the sheer silliness of ALfheim and the anime cliches thrown in that I see in almost every single popular anime out there. It really should have stopped after Kirito defeated the ""final boss"", but oh well. I had a day off and needed something to watch. It more or less kept my attention so I'll give 4 stars.",1396569600,,2981,4.407272727272727
5968259,1,B00F6IMD4C,"The entire series was better as 15 episodes. It could've easily ended then. But the rest of the series really wasn't as heartfelt, and incestuous relationships aren't my thing. As for Asuna, one of the main charactersin the first series, her story is bland and boring in this season and she isn't even in the last scene of the lasty episode. It's like her character was just completely forgotten after the first seven minutes of the last episode. My opinion? Not worth watching; a rather disappointing ending. Kirito didn't even seem to have interest in Asuna, of whom he went through so many more experiences with than his own sister Leafa/Suguha. The ending was a major disappointment..",1396137600,,688,4.888888888888889
5968260,4,B00F6IMD4C,"Cute ending. Same as earlier concerning the extras. If you've picked up the others, no reason not to add this one.",1396051200,,114,4.476190476190476
5968261,4,B00F6IMD4C,"Despite many obsticles, Kirito and his new friend Leafa make it the the World Tree.  Once there, Yui locates Asuna's gamer code and this sends Kirito charging towards the Grand Quest, to reach to top the the Tree and confront Oberon.  However Oberon is not wiling to give up his precious Tatiana, or his experiments without a fight.  Can Kirito and his allies challenge the Fairy King and bring an end to his twisted plans for the 300 players still trapped from SAO, but Asuna as well?

This part is more in line with the first season of SAO.  A grand quest to complete while under the surface a more sinister plot unfolds to ensare the unwary.  But this did have a good character development, heartbreak moments, and a sense of triumph as Kirito pushes himself to bring down a power hungry person and reunite with someone he was looking for.  Now we need to wait for them to start the third arc, which I believe will have more of the first arc feel.",1391212800,9,950,4.425287356321839
