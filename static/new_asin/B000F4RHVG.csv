2551436,2,B000F4RHVG,"The luridly titled PASSION AND PARADISE is based on one of the most fascinating unsolved murders in Caribbean history (which was also used as the basis of Nicholas Roeg`s EUREKA), that of Sir Harry Oakes in the Bahamas during WWII. A self made millionaire, Sir Harry Oakes (Rod Steiger), vigorously opposes both legalized gambling and the building of tourist resorts in his adopted home of the Bahamas. He also objects to his ""ladies man"" son in law (Armand Assante). When Sir Harry is found brutally murdered (he's beaten to death, then set on fire), it's his son in law who is arrested and tried for his murder. The film takes enormous liberties and license with the facts, even implicating the Duke and Duchess of Windsor, as well as mobster Lucky Luciano, in the scandal. Since the murder was never solved, the film is given a ludicrous hypothetical ending. Surely the real story is fascinating enough without the fabrications. Except for Steiger and Mariette Hartley as his wife, the acting is pretty lousy especially the dull Catherine Mary Stewart as the daughter. Michael Sarrazin and Kevin McCarthy co-star.

The Direct Source DVD is an acceptable full frame (it was shot for TV) transfer.",1316390400,,1198,4.930693069306931
2551437,4,B000F4RHVG,"I have been working my way through the Assante catalog and I've decided to concentrate my reviews on the films that have received only a few comments with an idea that hopefully it will persuade people to give the film a chance. This one has a nice budget, some excellent dialogue, location, and a better than expected cast, but really, it is the trio of heavyweight actors that make the film happen at all: Steiger and Assante I expected to make a meal of this material but the surprise for me was the mother, played by Mariette Hartley, she works as the dramatic and emotional pivot between the two men and these actors are both the better for it.

As to the story they did follow many of the details or facts with accuracy, however, if you Google any of the main characters it will be quite a let down when you see that the real Count played by Assante was no Assante! So, avoid the Google research and enjoy a nicely twisting plot, and if the acting by some seems a tad forced and artificial keep in mind their efforts to keep up with a Steiger or Assante was no small challenge and would likely have made a mess of anyone's acting by comparison. I thought many of the smaller roles, such as the two dueling lawyers, to be solid and even fascinating all on their own. If there was a weak spot it was the young woman who plays the daughter of Steiger and is Assante's love interest. I won't say more other than they did what they could to help her, personally I think any young actress would have been unequal to the role wedged between those two; that may be why Hartley's maturity allowed her to run with them throughout the film with nary a mis-step.

Along with the main story is one revolving around, of all people, Lucky Luciano, and even the Duke and Duchess of Windsor (who are savaged in this film; however, if it is in any way accurate, then that is a good thing!)

While this isn't the film of all films it does showcase the young Assante, it allows him to display all his many assets as an actor, one moment grinning with effortless charm or manic with anger, or frozen with self doubt and yet virile throughout in that old school way, and in the same way that Steiger was. It was a great pleasure to see them together in this film, if for no other reason get the film for their acting along with Hartley.",1301356800,5,2320,4.31651376146789
2551438,4,B000F4RHVG,"This movie was enjoyed by me because of the fact that the murder victim, Sir Harry Oakes was from the town I live in.  His family is well known and the history surrounding this man's life is very interesting.  He was a self made millionaire many times over.  He started at the bottom and worked hard to reach the top to success.  He had a love for the land he called paradise and was brutally murdered.  Rod Steiger did a fantastic job portraying Sir Harry and Armande Assante was a stunning, accused, son-in-law.  Fine movie!",1188172800,9,526,4.484210526315789

8117436,5,B000F4RHVG,"This movie ""Passion and Paradise"" is a true story of Harry Oakes (wealthiest man in the world then); the circumstances surrounding his life and death.  It stays close to the truth in both the greatest scintillating romance, and defense trial of the 20th Century.  My husband went through the Oaks' mansion, it was abandoned, and left as it is recalled here in this movie -- decades later (but now plowed under). One of our favorite movies of all time.  A best choice for a great date night.  Every sailor's ""MUST SEE"".  And should be ""Required Viewing"" at law schools.",1342828800,,568,4.696969696969697
