8568088,5,B00BGGIVJ4,"This was Glenn Ford's first movie.  I saw this when it was first released.  I hadn't realized that it was written by Dalton Trumbo, who was later Blacklisted for his liberal views.  Can you imagine? Persecuted for your beliefs?  That could never happen today, could it. Dalton Trumbo also wrote the screenplay for Spartacus.  It was Kirk Douglas who brought him back to Hollywood.",1387929600,3,380,4.875
