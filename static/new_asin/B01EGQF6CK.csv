7734974,1,B01EGQF6CK,"I love this movie.  I have seen it about a billion times on youtube and know the words by heart so I decided to make the investment.  Thats why when I received this DVD I was unbelievably disappointed. This particular version has all the 'love' scenes cut out.  What girl wants a movie where the kissing has been removed.  I don't think i would mind as much if it wasn't so badly done.  the scenes are cut and it skips and its very distracting...  needless to say i was pissed...  also, I don't know if it was just my copy or all but the sound during the last 10 minutes was terrible.  I had to keep turning the volume up and then it almost made me pee my pants when the sound would come back!!!  ugh!  so disappointing.  I contacted amazon and they gave me a refund.  its too bad.  one of my favorite korean dramas.",1378857600,17,816,4.153846153846154
7734975,4,B01EGQF6CK,"Awesome movie, but this particular DVD (produced in China) has two scenes edited out. The two missing scenes happen to be my favorite! 5+ stars for a superb movie in the full version; 4 stars for this somewhat abridged version.",1370390400,9,227,4.7
7734976,4,B01EGQF6CK,Although I enjoyed the movie its missing a scene. I want to see if there are two versions to this movie. and if so I would like the full movie. I hope someone can give me a good answer.,1370390400,3,185,3.769230769230769
7734977,5,B01EGQF6CK,"this film is about a romance between a shamed ex-boxer and a blind girl(well 99% blind). the near entirety of this film is both these characters, there are no meaningful side characters. for a film like this to work and not be turtle paced, the characters have to have chemistry and they have to be believable. this is something this film exceeds in. the acting is flawless.

this film has everything you need in a good romantic drama film. good pacing(very rare in asian dramas), dramatic, heartwarming, little comedy when needed, believable characters, and it is unique. this film is a story of a man who would do anything for the woman he loves, and it is presented marvelously. I recommend it to anyone.",1367020800,9,707,4.701612903225806
7734978,5,B01EGQF6CK,"the critical element in a romantic drama or comedy is a deep & believable chemistry between the two characters - as well as between the two actors - this drama has both

in this film - meeting cute means meeting in a dramatically satisfying way - with the blind girl intruding in the booth of a parking attendant - unaware that it's a new guy - why didn't the old guy tell the girl he was leaving - irrelevant - it was lucky he didn't

the blind girl is played by the luminescent newcomer Han Hyo Joo - and she has the responsibility of carrying the film cuz the male role of a damaged young man gives him fewer dimensions - but he's played by charismatic romantic idol So Ji Seob - who does a very good job with the limited role

i thought the ending a little weak - but the only major flaw for me was the one plot twist involving a huge coincidence - then - strangely - it was barely touched on afterwards - so - it really didn't need to be in the story - at least it wasn't fatal to the enjoyment of the film for me - since the chemistry remained intact

while the visuals are less pleasing than most Korean films - the story deserves 3 or 4 stars -  and So Ji Seob - and especially Han Hyo Joo - soar above the flaws - and turn the film into a must see for fans of romantic drama",1365465600,2,1283,3.9766536964980546
7734979,4,B01EGQF6CK,"I will admit to being prejudiced toward Korean movies and TV shows. Someone more objective than I would quite likely hate some of the things I enjoyed. I enjoyed the two main characters in this film and many of their interactions but I found that their relationship moved too quickly to be believable. (I know this isn't a documentary.) But I was still rooting for them until about the 95% point in the film. I 'enjoyed' the part where the girl (Jung-hwa) didn't recognize the boy (Chul-min) - but sensed something. Sad and suspenseful. (Viewers will know why she didn't.) But, c'mon, this attractive, intelligent girl doesn't have another relationship after two years? (Maybe I'm just not romantic enough to believe she still waits.) I don't know how much detail the 'burned man' gave her before she went looking for Chul-min about what happened the night of the car accident but that seems like a relationship-killer to me when it comes out. (Again, viewers will understand.) A reserved thumbs up.",1364601600,,999,4.882352941176471

7734982,4,B01EGQF6CK,"Now a favorite to add to my collection.  Great performances by both actors.  Your heart will share all that they endure.
Han Hyo-joo keeps surpassing herself each year with her talent.  Would have given it 5-star score if the kissing scenes had not been deleted.",1471824000,,262,4.777777777777778

7734985,3,B01EGQF6CK,"I love this movie, but I noticed some scenes were cut from the movie, and of course they were my favorite parts. Very disappointing, but great movie if you can buy it without scenes getting cut out.",1455062400,,198,4.378378378378378
7734986,5,B01EGQF6CK,"I love the movie, but don't order it. Some idiot decided to cut two innocent kissing scene s from the movie. Amazon refunded my money after returning video.",1452038400,,156,4.607142857142857

7734988,5,B01EGQF6CK,I do not own the DVD but saw that movie when it was available in Amazon prime. Some reviewer mentioned that the two love scenes are missing in the DVD. If that's true then it is real crime to steel them from the audience! This is one of the best romantic films.,1443744000,,261,4.038461538461538

7734991,5,B01EGQF6CK,This is one of my favorite Korean movie. So Ji Sub and Han Hyo-Joo are wonderful.,1436745600,,81,4.125
7734992,5,B01EGQF6CK,"I'm afraid I'm addicted to Korean soaps and films. A few of them I find inane and/or absurd but I found this film very moving and well acted. I couldn't avoid comparing it to the American film ""Rocky.""  The subtle and understated intense emotional commitment of the protagonists compared to the American version which tends to hit you over the head to make its point was, for me, a reinforcement of why I like Korean films. They do not always have happy endings, and rely on the intelligence and imagination of the viewer to  tell the unspoken and implied details of the story. Some of you may find my views overstated and perhaps even maudlin, nevertheless I found this film beautiful.",1434585600,3,686,4.661157024793388
7734993,1,B01EGQF6CK,"If you love SJS, you want this movie--however, do not buy it from this seller on AMAZON.  See the other complaints as they are all true.  The sweet love scenes are cut, yet the seller does not admit this video has been altered/censored.  Shame!

It is now finally on DramaFever, so watch there.

I am returning this censored video.",1431734400,2,331,4.5423728813559325

7734995,4,B01EGQF6CK,I recommend this movie it was a nice love story.,1429142400,,48,3.9
7734996,5,B01EGQF6CK,"I returned this movie to the seller. I have watched this movie many times through several different streaming sites so am very familiar with it.
Besides having boxing as a backdrop, this is mainly a romance story, so to have the two (already brief in the original) love scenes completely cut out is very disappointing. In the original cut, the two scenes that are missing in this cut are NOT graphic at all. 1) The couple's first, very innocent, kiss is abruptly cut. 2) The scene showing that now they are a true couple which has ZERO nudiity, in fact, both couples are fully clothed but they kiss (while sitting up) and you only ASSUME from the context that they would make love is COMPLETELY (and unnecessarily) CUT.

There are no deleted scenes on the DVD nor any other extras so no use in thinking the scenes might be elsewhere on the DVD.

If you want your DVD's completely with no inference of a physical relationship (even brief kissing), than this is the version for you. (Although, it has more than enough violence that has not been cut so...) I prefer to have movies that I buy in their original state. This DVD should at least be labelled across the front as ""abridged"" or ""censored"". Although, believe me, there is nothing on the original cut that a child or your visiting pastor shouldn't see.",1427241600,5,1307,4.581196581196581

7735000,3,B01EGQF6CK,First saw this movie on Youtube. I do not understand while this copy was edited.  The youtube version was longer this version had cuts in two areas.  I appears that the distribituor did not want to show the characters displaying any effection. The movie was spliced when every the two main characters were about to kiss.  The youtube version was PG so I did not understand the editing.  I thought it was two much trouble to send  back so I just kept it.  Besides it is a good movie.  Also the subtitles were a little off but I have come to expect that when watching Korean movies.,1421712000,,580,4.364485981308412

7735003,4,B01EGQF6CK,"I love this movie, and have watched it several times online.  The chemistry between the characters is wonderful, and the storyline, while sentimental and filled with melodrama cliches, is so well-acted and directed that that isn't really a negative criticism.  Unfortunately, the version I received from Asian Mall has had several scenes chopped, and I wish that sellers of this movie would note whether the version they are selling has been abridged.  I'd be willing to buy the full version for a higher price than I paid, but I am disappointed with this disjointed version.",1414195200,,575,5.031578947368421

There isn't anything I disliked about this movie and will recommend to my friends.",1394755200,2,314,4.413793103448276
7735009,3,B01EGQF6CK,"This movie had me crying rivers! I really enjoyed it1 I'm more of a drama than movies kind of person, but when I read what it was about I was intrigued. I must admit that I also saw it cause of So Ji Sub, but I think it made the movie better! It is cut in a couple of scenes. Maybe three in total. Its just the intimate scenes, I saw the movie online before I purchased it, so I know what scenes were missing. It still kept the main points and the ending is incredible.",1392508800,,469,3.8958333333333335

8758625,5,B01EGQF6CK,I have seen this movie but as a Turkish film called Sadece Sen. My review may not get published. I am still going to buy this movie because I love Ji Sub and want to see him in it. The story is such a poignant love story. An often used theme but still noteworthy.,1519603200,,263,3.888888888888889

8758632,1,B01EGQF6CK,"Love this movie, and any one who has seen the original can understand why I gave one star!  They cut out all the romantic scenes!  No kissing, from what I am reading they actually cut out 2 complete scenes, I wouldn't know as I was so disgusted with the hacked movie I quit watching.  If you want the original romantic love story do not buy this!!!  I am so angry, and am returning for refund.  So disappointed, all read to watch Ji Sub and then this....they really should tell people this this is a hacked up version.  The original is so beautiful....",1487376000,,552,4.362745098039215
