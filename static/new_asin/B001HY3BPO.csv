8310176,5,B001HY3BPO,The Junior's Giants movies are a great way to teach valuable moral lessons to your children.  They are entertaining and relate well to current day situations and events.  These movies are a favorite for my children.,1478908800,,215,4.944444444444445
8310177,5,B001HY3BPO,Great story line! My boys love Junior!!,1435449600,,39,4.714285714285714
8310178,4,B001HY3BPO,"Maybe not quite as funny as the first video (Anger's Everywhere), but still full with lots of laughs. The fast-paced, off-the-wall humor will keep you and the kids bursting out in laughter.",1409184000,,189,4.9375
8310179,5,B001HY3BPO,"This DVD fascinates the kids with a relevant story line while teaching biblically based truths. Plus, it's quirky-funny with 80's musical & visual homages. :-)",1406937600,,159,5.4
8310180,5,B001HY3BPO,This movie is great. I still love to watch it with my 13 year old. Great message in these movies. One day hope to get a copy of all for grandchildren.,1406505600,,150,3.870967741935484
8310181,5,B001HY3BPO,"These movies continue to get better and better! I now have all 3 ""thank you Jesus!"" I pop all these movies in regularly. This one is my favorite, I was a fan of pokemon and the parody to thoses types genres is truly funny. I cant wait till the 4th movie comes out.",1359936000,,264,4.0
8310182,5,B001HY3BPO,"I had never heard of Junior's Giants before walking into a local Christian bookstore one day. Thought I'd give it a try and my kids at church loved it.  I've purchased all three of the videos in this series and each one was a hit! There aren't many videos that elementary aged kids can relate to. These aren't too ""baby-ish"" and have a modern sense of humor that today's kids relate to. I only wish there were more than three.",1352764800,,426,4.325
8310183,5,B001HY3BPO,"I have always found Bible shows for my kids to watch. But as they have gotten older it has been harder to find ones they think are ""cool"". Juniors Giants are Awesome. They are the first series in a while my kids are asking to watch over and over. It is done with a modern style that switches scenes and type frequently, like God Rocks which is another one of our favorites!

This is a great series to add to your library and also one to purchase and give to your children's church ministry.  You and your kids won't be disappointed.",1341878400,,532,4.257425742574258
8310184,5,B001HY3BPO,"This cute cartoon teaches a positive lesson.  Our grandson asks to watch it over and over!  We give it two ""thumbs up"".",1341446400,,119,4.363636363636363
8310185,5,B001HY3BPO,"We love this video. It does a great job of being up to date keeping the childrens attention and yet sharing scripture truth. A great story about learning that we don't always need the latest newest toy out there. There are many more important things we can do with our money, like give it to someone in need. In this story, a little boy that hasn't ate in 3 days. Can't wait to see the other junior giant videos to see if they are just as good. God bless His Kingdom!!
