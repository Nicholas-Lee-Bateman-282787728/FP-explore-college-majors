8164456,2,B000LV6MEG,"The presentation attempt to portray a therapeutic process, but actually shows a dogmatic (and a bit boring) version of CBT. There is little or no dealings with complexities and dilemmas which could enhance the viewer. The client is an actor, much of the sessions are described briefly verbally between sessions as opposed to showing what has been done. For anyone with an already basic acquaintance with CBT for panic and depression, IMHO there is little to be gained from this DVD.",1215820800,,482,4.962962962962963
8164457,5,B000LV6MEG,"If you're looking for a good, systemic view and review of cognitive behavioral therapy, this is excellent. Donald Meichenbaum uses his clarity of thought and presentation to this well prepared and well-acted start to finish case study. If you were looking at how to apply the principles, you will be hard pressed to find a better example.",1194739200,5,338,4.947368421052632
