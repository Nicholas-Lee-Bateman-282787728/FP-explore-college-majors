4592752,5,B0056OZI0W,I don't know how this movie has bypassed me for all of these years. The story centers around the plot to kill Uncle. Little does anyone know Uncle is prepared at every turn. This story has surprise after surprise and does not let you down.,1342828800,,239,4.333333333333333
4592753,4,B0056OZI0W,"The movie is what I expected because of the cast members, they are in other movies I have and they were good as well.",1325376000,3,117,3.9166666666666665
4592754,5,B0056OZI0W,"This movie has a lot of good fighting scenes and the movie is very well acted.  There is so many twist and turns in this movie, I would called them power struggles.  I really enjoyed this movie, especially the end.",1324857600,9,214,4.325

4592757,5,B0056OZI0W,great movie with a lot of action,1408147200,,32,3.7142857142857144
4592758,1,B0056OZI0W,No English version. Will not purchase anymore.,1405382400,,46,5.714285714285714
4592759,5,B0056OZI0W,"Great action, great fight scenes, skillful actors.  The plots tend to always be the same (avenging a murdered master, rescuing a kidnapped girl, challenging a drug lord, etc.).  But I watch them for the great choreographed fight scenes.",1402185600,,236,5.184210526315789
4592760,2,B0056OZI0W,As an old-time martial arts film this seemed to be a good classic. It was very disappointing with the unnecessary nudity and the graphic way it was paraded. Had to fast forward several times. One scene is of a couple having sex and the other big one is of a rape.  I won't be watching this again.,1389312000,2,296,4.192982456140351
4592761,5,B0056OZI0W,This is one of my all time favorite Chinese Kung FU movies.  I saw it when it was released in Chinese and had an olds video and Chinese DVD.  I wanted a newer version so I could see it again.,1388707200,,191,3.75
4592762,1,B0056OZI0W,"This is a terrible  movie. Very disappointed. Please do not waste your money.
Story line & acting very poor. Its a shame that such poor productions are allowed to be sold",1370822400,,170,4.483870967741935
4592763,2,B0056OZI0W,"Ithought that the Shaw Brothers were suppose to be good directors, but in this film they must have been asleep and someone else made this movie.  There is a lot of killing and nudity in it and I must be truthful I have not made it all the way thru as yet.  Maybe after I watch it all the way thru I can give a more positive review.",1366243200,,331,3.8529411764705883
4592764,3,B0056OZI0W,The ratings I assign to a movie are based on environment.  Another person might have a different opinion.  Thats why there is freedom of choice.,1361836800,,144,4.72
4592765,4,B0056OZI0W,"As I have mentioned in my previous reviews, I have had a lifetime love of anything to do with the martial arts and numerous weapon systems.  I also love most of the Asian martial arts films, even though many times the fight scenes do not resemble in anyway real life combat.  Nevertheless, I do find most of them entertaining and fun to watch.

 This one (Killer Clans) is one of the Shaw Brothers classic collection.  They are probably the most well known of the early Asian martial arts film producers.  After the classic movie Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon came out and won tons of awards, interest in the Asian martial art films increased greatly. These older films, like this one came out on DVD and are still popular today.

This film is about two battling clans who are competing to control the martial arts world.  There are various complex deceptions and double crosses going on in this movie and it is sometimes difficult to determine who is supposed to be the good guys or bad guys.  This same kind of theme is often seen in these Asian martial art films.  Nevertheless, the weapon fight scenes in this DVD are well worth seeing.  The story moves along at a fast pace with plenty of martial art and weapon fighting scenes.  This is a fun movie to watch in my opinion.

In conclusion, if you like Asian martial arts films you will enjoy this film.

4592770,5,B0056OZI0W,This movie was fantastic! Especially for the price! Reminds me of watching Kung-Fu Theater with my father. Can't beat less than $10 for a little childhood nostalgia.,1358985600,3,165,5.148148148148148
4592771,5,B0056OZI0W,"Run Run Shaw another classic for the collection.  Great story line, chorograph, an plot all that good stuff that makes this a good movie.",1356048000,3,137,4.708333333333333

4592775,5,B0056OZI0W,"Where do I even start? The costumes are fantastic, the sets are gorgeous, the fighting (what there is) is good stuff, the performances are great (especially Ku Feng and Yueh Hua)...but the plot and the script are mind-blowing. This movie has enough plot twists and double-crosses (and triple crosses - all I can say is pay ATTENTION to what's happening and who's who) to bend your brain permanently into the shape of a pretzel. Secret passages, a brothel/clearinghouse for assassins, archers and ninjas waiting behind every door and pillar...this movie is a near-fatal overdose of adventure and intrigue injected directly into your eyeballs. And a few seconds of tasteless nudity! What more could you want?! Tragedy, you say? Some o' that...keep the kleenex box nearby. Stand-up-and-cheer villain-comeuppance? Check. The pimpest of pimpdaddys? Ku Feng, sucker. And a pinch of romance.

The word ""spectacular"" comes to mind. I'm not being sarcastic - it's an all-out entertainment assault. This is one I can't get tired of.",1352160000,13,1022,5.2317073170731705

8459871,2,B0056OZI0W,"I own over 300 martials arts dvds and it is very unlikely that I will ever watch this one again, First, the good news is that this film does possess an interesting storyline. A storyline that goes beyond the standard, ""You killed my Master"" revenge film. There is plenty of trickery and deception in the script to keep you guessing just who the good guys are. Now the bad news, the fight scenes are extremely anti-climatic, and that's being polite. And to make matters worse the movie seems to end in the middle of the story. There is zero hand to hand combat, just special weapons. The editing of the fight scenes was poorly done causing you to guess how they got from one position to the next.",1417478400,2,695,4.4375
