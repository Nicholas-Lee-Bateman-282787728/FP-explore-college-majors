3589780,3,B001G0MFIS,"This season's CSI was hugely disappointing after the departure of Sara Sidle (Jorja Fox), the death of Warrick Brown (Gary Dourdan), and the beloved character Gil Grissom (William Petersen). The new induction of CSI's, Dr. Raymond Langston (Lawrence Fishburne), Riley Adams (Lauren Lee Smith) and the training of David Hodges (Wallace Langham) and Wendy Simms (Liz Vassey) did not help the story lines at all. All the characters seem disconnected to each other and the crime and crime solving aren't as meticulous as past seasons. Sara Sidle returns to Las Vegas to attend Warrick's funeral and tells Grissom about her feelings of their relationship. Grissom isn't as motivated or thinking straight and decides to leave CSI Graveyard and hands over the team to Catharine (Marg Helgenberger). Conrad Ecklie (Marc Vann) takes over the undersherriff position after Undersherriff McKeen was arrested for murdering Warrick. Nick let his emotional side get to him after special guest star, Taylor Swift's character, dies in a freak accident in a chain of events. Greg usually works with Riley for the majority of cases and does not appear as much as Nick or Dr. Langston. Overall, change is sometimes good but in this case, it hasn't worked out for the series. Episodes I recommend watching are: ""Say Uncle"" (Where a multiple shooting in Koreatown occurs and no one will speak up), ""Leave Out All The Rest"" (Where Lady Heather appears again and helps Grissom with an S&M case) and ""Woulda, Coulda, Shoulda"" (Where Grissom confronts Natalie Davis the ""Miniature Killer"" from Season Seven).

Looking Forward To Season Ten:

3589781,4,B001G0MFIS,"Now, I have to say that the past years of CSI, have found me at the edge of my seat!!! Remembering back to how things have been, crimes commited, and the character developments, have blown me away. Like a new-age Murder she wrote. lol.. This season, for me was sad.. For one, having some main characters gone.. Having Sara leave was sad, and the worst part, no more William Peterson!!! Grissom is what made CSI to me, and it just wasn't the same after he left.. They should have made Catherine Willows as the leader.. Other than that, this season still packed a punch with twists, and good plots for the most part.. If CSI continues for one last season, I hope at least, to have camios with Sara and Grissom.. I think a great series finale would include a 3 part episode, that goes through Vegas, Miami, and NY.... That would be thrilling and a great way to end it...",1243209600,11,867,4.391304347826087
3589782,5,B001G0MFIS,"Great Episode: Emotions of the cast were conveyed without overdoing the drama. The episode was not drawn out like Sara's attempted murder by the miniature granddaughter. The team processed the data following their norm for investigations and were purposeful instead of recanting their past with Warrick. Very well directed, very well written, and very well executed by the actors. I felt like I was there during the process of finding the killer and for me that is entertainment.",1240704000,,479,5.153846153846154
3589783,5,B001G0MFIS,"To me this CSI is the best one on TV, with CSI Miami close behind.  Grissom is the balm as well as Worrick and Nick. Grissom Shows great leadership skills and explains as he is going.  It is just great.",1224979200,2,202,4.025
3589791,5,B001G0MFIS,"I really like this installment of csi. I think Fishburne did a fine job here. It  was a nice shake up for the series.  He portrayed a doctor quite effectively. He sounded like doctors I personally know. He sounded believable, not just spotting jargon. Also, it took the focus away from other characters for awhile, which I really enjoyed.",1505174400,,338,4.711864406779661

3589794,4,B001G0MFIS,"Have always loved this show.  I bough all the seasons and will have a nice CSI marathon real soon.  I missed Gil a lot but Danson filled in well.  I never did understand Fishburne's character and how it added to the mix.  He's awesome but it felt that his part never fleshed out.  The stories always were fascinating even after so many years.  I think it ended appropriately.  Just buy it, sit down for the long haul, and enjoy.",1500508800,,428,4.341772151898734

3589834,3,B001G0MFIS,"I was SO SICK and tired of this so-called love affair they kept pushing on the audience. Writing is supposed to reflect real life as much as possible. Real men chose women like Lady Heather because she's gorgeous and mature all the way around. The character Sara Sidle resembles a boy or a guy. There's nothing feminine about her slouchy walk, flat, boney body and worst of all, her spoiled brat persona. She was this annoying self righteous, holier than thou, who needed to be coddled from the time she came to Vegas till the time she left. The show could have did without this character just fine. CSI missed out on a great deal of issues they could have exploited and dealt with but lacked the courage to deal with the issues of keeping Gil and other characters consistent. Once you lose the ability or guts to keep the character consistent, you lose the ability for the audience to keep their suspension of belief alive. When that happens you kind of look at the show almost cartoon or sitcom like. Because, in real life, Katherine and everyone else would have stewed Grissom and Stewed him and Sara in a pot. Creating that kind of conflict of interest and not calling Grissom out for the hypocrite that he was after sermonizing everyone for years about integrity was a golden opportunity the writers missed out on to demonstrate how serious fireworks and deceit between co-workers can escalate and even affect long term friendships. They sacrificed what would have been realistic, juicy situations just to push the old TV employee love and sex scenario. They went the way of the Melrose Place. So they ignored it and completely went off script and turned Grissom into this guy that let everyone down by not being to follow his own rules and no one on his team felt betrayed by the character's hypocrisy. No one likes or respects a phony and that's what the character ended up being. You can't script a character's personality for years as an example of honesty and integrity and suddenly throw all that away just because Hollywood is obsessed with co-workers constantly screwing around with each other. There are people who work together and that's it. I don't know why Writers kept forcing this Grissom-Sara none sense because it made me nauseous because they kept playing around with it way, way too long and it go in the way of the show's cases to me. I wanted them to either get a room or knock it off already. In reality both would have caught hell and one would have been fired. There is so much fun they could have had with this scenario when they got caught but they really missed out on some high tension that could have added more intensity to the show. What a shame. Vegas isn't tough enough so they go off into the jungle-yeah ok. CSI really blew it this season trying to push this Romeo and Juliet stuff on us. And to show you it was just a bunch of none-sense they fell back on because they were too lazy to write about more realistic situations, they broke up as soon as he left. All that love and all that passion just to disappear the next season? Using a work related love affair as a crutch to just fill in story lines is not only lazy but stupid.",1468195200,,3171,4.516521739130435

3590009,4,B001G0MFIS,"This season was one that had some extraordinary episodes, but unfortunately loss a couple of good characters.  There some
sadness with the death of one of the CSI criminalists, someone I did not really like but felt emotionally sad at his passing.  Then
Sarah leaves and later followed with Grissoms departure.  I was very fond of Sarah and Grissoms leadership is clearly missed.
I am not a particularly fond of Willows; I sense she really does not like men and perhaps her fellow workers.  She shafted this
young man (who had a tainted past) by accusing him of murdering this young girl and when the public found out  cost him his
job, house and wife to be.  He confronted her, she pulled her gun on him, and simply said ""I just did my job"".  It did not bother
her that the publicity and the accusation which was false ruined his life.  And this is not the first time she showed she could not
care less about others.  Grandma Kate should have left, not Grissom.  Even Dr Sweets be  better than her!!
  Still, there is still a lot of good stuff in this season.  A few funny episodes, especially "" A SPACE ODDITY"", another show poking
fun at Sci Fi conventions and especially at the original Star Trek.  And there are other good, if not rather gooey stories.  The
production quality, music, stories and cast continue to be outstanding.  Fishburne is very good addition but he is not Grissom.
I gave the season four stars instead of 5 because of Grissom and Sarahs departure and because of Grandma you-know-who.
It is still a great program as are all the CSI series.  I got this, of course, from AMAZON.  enjoy!",1404691200,5,1609,4.524305555555555

3590077,1,B001G0MFIS,"Right out of the gate it screws the pooch. After Season 8 dealt with Warrick pursuing the mole inside the police department, the mole is discovered to be Under-Sheriff Jeffrey McKeen. The Season 8 finale FOR GEDDA left us for the entire summer of 2008. We all were in a fog that whole summer. In the Season 9 premiere FOR WARRICK, Warrick bleeds to death in Grissom's arms. The episode was bookended by our tears, the beginning watching Warrick slip away & the end with Grissom's eulogy. We learn Warrick had a son-Eli. Meta Golding was back as Tina Brown who had not been seen since BANG BANG in Season 6. When it came to Warrick's murder, both DVDs, Seasons 8 & 9 gave us the tip of the tip of the tip of the iceberg.

THE HAPPY PLACE-the sequel to Season 1's TOO TOUGH TO DIE. Pamela Adler dies in her hospital room. Tom Adler suspects Tony Thorpe whose rape put Pamela Adler in the hospital in the first place. Thorpe has an airtight alibi, he was shot in the back in 2007 & left paralyzed from the waist down. Netfa Perry was also back as Thorpe's mother. Sam Vega worked the Alder murder & also the Adler rape. ALL of the key people were back & TOO TOUGH TO DIE was the first Sara-centric episode. She became friends with Tom & never took Thorpe off her radar. Now she has to watch Tom be arrested for Pamela's murder. JorJa Fox, Aldis Hodge, Michelle Ann Johnson, Mtare Mwine, Netfa Perry & Geoffrey Rivas were all present. We never thought TOO TOUGH TO DIE would ever have a sequel but it was a sequel that blew us away. Also THE HAPPY PLACE had the team still reeling from Warrick's assassination. I call it assassination because Warrick was zeroing in on McKeen. It's an abomination that THE HAPPY PLACE was not given commentary.

LEAVE OUT ALL THE REST-named after the LINKIN PARK song of the same name, the song is also heard. LEAVE OUT ALL THE REST was also the last Lady Heather episode with Grissom. Lady Heather has retired as a dominatrix & is now a therapist. She presses Grissom on where his relationship with Sara stands, but also LEAVE OUT ALL THE REST was the episode that began the Nathan Haskell storyline. Haskell was not seen until 19 DOWN, but it was the murders of Justine Stefani & Ian Wallace that would cast light on the Dick & Jane Killer. This episode had arc significance & it still got no commentary. Melinda Clarke, JorJa FOx & William Peterson ALL should have done commentary. Also in another incident of the producers having no common sense, they named LEAVE OUT ALL THE REST after a LINKIN PARK song, a little is heard, but they did not include the video on the Special Features.

W0ULDA, C0ULDA, SH0ULDA-the return of Natalie Davis. After kidnapping Sara, Grissom had to testify with regard to Davis's state of mind. It has to be decided, will The Miniature Killer go to prison or will she be confined to a mental hospital. Like Lady Heather, Davis interrogates Grissom on his relationship with Sara. In another example of character development being ignored, Natalie Davis also has overcome her phobia over bleach. 0ccupational therapy got Davis to see bleach for what it is, a cleaning substance. W0ULDA, C0ULDA, SH0ULDA ends with Grissom in Natalie Davis's cell where he lifts a floor tile with a doll with string around the neck. It intimates that Natalie Davis committed suicide but her fate remains unknown. Peterson & Jessica Collins SH0ULDA been called in. Who knew after DEAD DOLL(8 premiere) that we would ever see Natalie Davis again?

YOUNG MAN WITH A HORN-A murder in 2008 leads the team to investigate a murder that took place in the 60s. So a period-themed episode with 3 BIG name actors in it, Bill Cobbs, Robert Guillaume & Tippi Hedren. Also Holt McCallany who played Detective John Hagan on the first 3 seasons of C.S.I. MIAMI makes his original series guest turn. Bill Cobbs-GHOSTS OF MISSISSIPPI, Robert Guillaume-BENSON & SPORTS NIGHT & Tippi Hedren-who worked with Alfred F()<king Hitchcock on THE BIRDS. 3 BIG names & this episode got the shaft. With no commentary from them or interviews, Taylor Swift again proves to be the exception rather then the rule regarding her commentary on TURN, TURN, TURN.

KILL ME IF YOU CAN-a man lives lives as 3 different men. It was a cleverly written show & Micheal Weston was so adept at playing different incarnations of the same character.

NO WAY OUT-The newest members of the team, Adams & Langston are held hostage in a basement drug lab. Using tips they gained from a gun training class, they were able to emerge from the crisis intact. Lauren Lee Smith never did commentary for her entire run on C.S.I. I wanna know why they never had her record for ART IMITATES LIFE. Riley Adams may have been a 1-season wonder but Lauren Lee Smith was great on the show. Laurence Fishburne I'm sure had things to say about this episode.

HOG HEAVEN-motorcycle gangs terrorize Las Vegas, Brass is put into the fray because the victim turns out to be an undercover cop, his widow an ex-girlfriend of Brass. Just like ELLIE(2), HOLLYWOOD BRASS(5) & from Season 6, BANG BANG & WAY TO GO, Brass gets character development & again Paul Guilfoyle is shortchanged on the DVD. Ally Walker was brilliant as the cop's widow whose jealousy gets her husband killed when his identity as a police officer is revealed.

Common sense is nonexistent on the minds of the DVD producers. If they could scrape together an ounce of common sense, then we would get better content on the DVDs. Taylor Swift's song, YOU'RE NOT SORRY was used in TURN, TURN, TURN. Common sense would tell the producers to include the video on the Special Features but as I have established, they don't wanna invest in content nearly what matches what we invest in the way of cold hard cash when we buy the DVDs. Take a look at FIREFLY on both DVD & later Blu-Ray. Joss Whedon is a man with common sense oozing out of his ass. Common sense is proving to not be common at all.",1365724800,,5924,4.582075471698113

3590086,5,B001G0MFIS,"The introduction episode is the aftermath from Season 8 (For Warrick) so you don't have to wonder what if. By looking at the cover of this season you notice that Laurence Fishburne is in featured here. He is a replacement for Gil Grissom, yes I know, how sad. Grissom decides to leave the force with Sara Sidle (never was a big fan of her for several reasons). Before Grissom leaves, he works on a case with Ray Langston (Mr. Fishburne) which I enjoyed very much due to a pathologist and the CSI's father figure teaming up to show two heads are better than one.

The episodes still have witty names that hint off to what the episode could be about (Deep Fried and Minty Fresh, A Space Oddity). If you love the first 8 seasons, I would highly recommend getting this season even though Warrick Brown is missed, Gil Grissom leaves, and Sara Sidle makes an appearance in four episodes.",1359417600,2,881,4.50625

3590114,4,B001G0MFIS,"....and now we come to the Ninth Season, the one which, for so many fans, marked the beginning of the end of CSI. The excellent but painful Eighth Season had already seen the departure of two key characters from the Las Vegas forensics team: Sara Sidle (Jorja Fox) and Warrick Brown (Gary Dourdan), and as with all long-running shows with ensemble casts, these holes represented very serious challenges to CSI's writers and producers...and to the fans who were emotionally invested in them. They were nothing, however, compared to what was coming. The basic formula of CSI was always that of a procedural, relying half on the forensic mystery element it more or less pioneered, but also half on the chemistry between the talented and charismatic ensemble of actors playing Grissom, Brass, Warrick, Kathryn, Sara, Nick, Greg, the various ""lab rats"", Doc Robbins, and of course, Super Dave. Fans were hostile to changes (me included), and tense about how the changes would be handled.

S9 opens with ""For Warrick"", an episode devoted to the aftermath of the cliffhanger shooting of Warrick Brown, which closed the previous season. It's the sort of strong, emotionally charged, plot-twisted show the series had become famous for, and featured some gut-wrenching performances from the cast. It paved the way for the arrival of Laura Lee Smith's abrasive Riley Adams, and also marked the beginning of the story arc which would see the character of Gil Grissom (William Petersen) pack up his kit and leave the show which was founded around him. All CSI seasons have a theme, or themes, which more or less define them. S8 centered around wrapping up the Miniature Killer storyline, Sara's mental state, and the Warrick - Gedda feud. S9 revolves around Dr. Raymond Langston (Laurence Fishburne), a college professor who is tapped by a soon-departing Grissom to help him solve his last open case, the horrible ""Dick & Jane Murders."" This two-episode story (""19 Down...""/ ""One to Go"") involving a jailed serial killer apparently able to commit fresh atrocities from behind bars, is a fitting send-off to William Petersen, and has an ending all CSI fans should greatly enjoy. Some other outstanding efforts were:

Let it Bleed: The mysterious death of a notorious drug kingpin's only daughter leads to a bloodbath of truly epic proportions.

Turn, Turn, Turn: A cleverly plotted and poignent episode which takes place over a whole year sees Nick develop a relationship with a troubled young girl played by Taylor Swift.

Disarmed and Dangerous: A story with more plot-twists than a twizzler follows the aftermath of a grisly murder of an FBI agent, and features a guest appearance by Frank Whaley.

A Space Odyssey: This tribute/send up of ""Star Trek"" and its hardcore fans must surely rate as the funniest and most imaginative of all CSI episodes, exploring the star-crossed romance between Wendy and Hodges through a series of hilarious fantasy sequences.

If I Had a Hammer - A man Kathryn sent to prison years before gets a new trial based on DNA evidence which wasn't available when she put him away, leading to the fact he may be innocent.

All In - The discovery of a horde of valuable old casino chips leads to a series of brutal killings and a plethora of suspects, including a hard-eyed, pavement-voiced ole cowboy hustler played by the great Gerald McRaney.

Now, I think we all know the departure of Grissom from CSI is roughly analagous to having Sherlock Holmes written out of, well, Sherlock Holmes, and it was an open question whether Raymond Langston would be able to fill his shoes. The long-run answer to that question has already been answered, but I have to disagree with the majority of my fellow CSI fans and say that in the short-term, meaning for the remainder of Season Nine, Fishburne/Langston did as good as job as anyone in trying to do the impossible, i.e. replace the irreplaceable. If the character ultimately proved a failure, that probably had more to do with the fact that he changed almost out of recognition by Season Ten (losing the coat and glasses, karate-chopping Russian gangsters, etc.). He wasn't a fool, as some viewers claimed, merely new to his job, nave, and painfully earnest.  As for claims Fishburne got too much TV time, that's true, but also understandable; people have to remember he had been hired as the show's STAR, not merely a replacement. Still, he was overexposed to a degree that made me feel as if he was being rammed down my throat instead of allowed to develop organically. As for Riley, she was too generic and contrived of a character to replace someone as charismatic as Warrick, but was axed at the precise moment she seemed to be finding her legs. Throw in the black holes created by the loss of Sara (who does appear in a few shows), Warick (God I miss Gary Dourdan), and the great Grissom, and you had a formula which left few people satisified. But for my money, Season 9 gets a bad rap. Considering what circumstances dictated, I thought the producers did reasonably well trying to minimize the damage all this cast-shuffling caused. The damage-control was patchy and didn't really hold...but that's more a subject for a review of subsequent seasons.",1348617600,,5213,4.8946772366930915

3590133,2,B001G0MFIS,"Let me start by saying Laurence Fishburn is a wonderful actor.  However, his character's back story is simply not believable.  Why would a doctor and a college professor whom one would assume is making a good living, leave to take an entry level CSI job?  It just doesn't make sense.  Then all the other characters are asking his opinion on things; e.g. ""Ray, what do you think of this?,"" Ray, come take a look at this.""  I find it simply not believable.  Rather than attempting to replace a Grissom type character, I would have made Catherine a stronger leader and hired Demore Barnes formerly Hector Williams on the Unit to replace Gary Dourdain's character.

3590156,5,B001G0MFIS,"I've followed CSI ever since the pilot episode.  Now nearly 11 years later, the show is still true to form and still as popular as it was when the show debuted on CBS.  I'll admit, I didn't watch CSI the first four years it was on. It was only after I rented the DVDs from Netflix that I got hooked.  I watched the first three seasons on DVD in under three weeks.  I'd get a disc, watch it and send it back the same day I got it.

When the characters in the show started leaving for various reasons, I was afraid the show would 'jump the shark.'  I was skeptical about the addition of Laurence Fishburne taking over the role of the departed Gil Grissom, but I was pleasantly surprised when he seemed to gel quickly with the veteran characters on the show.

I missed a lot of the 9th season due to different reasons so when I bought this a couple weeks ago, this was another instance of watching all the discs in one weekend and it reaffirmed to me that this show is still on top of it's game.  Most shows over the years deviate from their roots.  CSI has stayed true to their roots they planted in the first season and leading up until now.  Fantastic show with fantastic storylines (albiet a bit unreal at times - my brother is a real life CSI and watches this show so he 'knows how the public thinks crimes are solved') with amazing actors.",1279238400,,1342,4.227450980392157

Although it was a used copy it came in new packaging and was in excellent condition, just as I was told: it had a few scratches but played perfectly. I had no idea it would be so reasonably priced ($20 for 24 episodes). I chose the basic shipping and was surprised at how reasonable this was ($2 and something)--one reason I rarely order online is because the cost of shipping usually offsets the savings.  I received the package in the mail within 3-4 days, although they didn't promise it in that short of a time.  I will definitely go to Amazon.com in the future for anything I may want or need.",1276992000,,671,4.403225806451613

At the time of this writing I have watched most of it and I'll say that I do miss Grissom, but he left in a cool way! With Fishbourne there he does make it a little different but in a good way, him being a CSI level 1 kind of brings a new feel to the old show. The remaining old cast is as good as ever and welcome Fishbourne's character with open arms. To date, I have very much enjoyed the episodes I have watched and am looking forward to finishing the season!",1270166400,,554,3.955357142857143

3590163,4,B001G0MFIS,"After some rather soapy seasons (who's in mortal danger THIS season?!?!?!), season 9 seems to have gotten CSI back on the crime-solving track. Like many, I was fearful that William Peterson's departure would be the death-knell of the series and a number of desperate attempts to save the series would begin (like someone's long-lost hot cousin moving in, or a 14 year old savant joins the crime-solving force), but it was in the end a rather smooth transition.  Marg Helgenberger's character (CSI Willows) steps up ably as the new leader of the evening shift, former day shift supervisor Conrad Ecklie (Mark Vann) is now an under-sheriff, and darn it, he's even likable now! Fishburne's character develops a collegial relationship with Doc Robbins (Robert D. Hall), the ME, and is an interesting, convincing and engaging addition to the cast.  Although various character quirks among all the cast continue to emerge (and it is a good thing , it gives them multi-dimensionality), they do not overwhelm the main thrust of the series: catching bad guys, no matter how cleverly they try to cover their nefarious deeds.  The cases are as varied as ever, and the writing approached in a manner that combines the best aspects of being responsible to the facts and science of each endeavor, yet maintains the right amount of dramatic license to keep things moving in a believable manner. If you've been following the series, you already know this, if you let it go for perhaps some of the same reasons I nearly gave up on it, then Season 9 is worth looking at and renewing your acquaintance with this terrific show.  If you're new to CSI, I do strongly recommend starting at the beginning but you could certainly watch season 9 on its own and enjoy it a great deal.",1266105600,4,1757,4.80794701986755
3590164,5,B001G0MFIS,"In my review of Season 8, I stated that it was time to end this show, & in some ways I still think it has run its course, however this Season really impressed me, at first I was not going to get it, but after catching a few episodes on ""SpikeTV"" I knew I had to get it, & it was definately a vast improvement over Season 8, this one begins where Season 8 left off with the death of Warrick & the team's attempt to take down the bad cop responsible, like Season 8's opener where they search for Sara, they do the same here, searching for Warrick's killer, Sara Sidle(Jorja Fox) returns breifly to attend Warrick's funeral, but leaves yet again, Grissom(William Peterson) leaves also after 10 episodes, at first I balked at the idea of him leaving, after all, him, Sara, & Warrick were my three favorite characters on this show, however, the beautiful Lauren Lee Smith as new C.S.I. Riley(replacing Warrick) quickly made me forget about Jorja Fox, Smith is so easy on the eyes, they had better not even think of getting rid of her!, & I quickly to my suprise warmed up to Lauarence Fishburne as Ray Langston, true, no one can ever replace Grissom, but unlike many believe, I don't think Fishburne or the writers had that intent, his Ray Langston is a character in his own right, & I believe that Fishburne was a good choice, he is after all a great actor, & this role fits him perfectly, he has definately come a long way since playing a thug in ""Death Wish II"" or Ike Turner in ""Whats love got to do with it"", to the ""Matrix"" or Tom Cruise's arrogant boss in ""Mission Impossible III"", here, he proves once again how versatile an actor he is, all in all, this Season 9 brings the glory of C.S.I. back, no ridiculous episodes this time around, a must for any fan.",1265587200,5,1760,4.35258358662614
3590205,4,B001G0MFIS,"Let me start by saying that I am an enormous CSI fan. I own all the seasons, it's just an all-around great show. Despite the loss of many main characters, the show is still going strong. Catherine has always worn the pants, so it's no surprise that she's the supervisor now that Grissom left. Don't listen to people who say ""CSI's going downhill"" and all that because it isn't true. Just watch ""Turn, Turn, Turn"" and tell me that this isn't one of the best seasons around! There's also a lot of other great episodes, and if you're a fan of the Miniature Killer from season 7, she comes back for an episode in this season. I would have given this DVD set 5 stars, but there's one thing I hate...

What I am most disappointed about is the packaging for this season! The discs fall out all over the place and the plastic holding cases are totally worthless! All the other seasons had very good packaing, but they really didn't care much about making this one nice. Oh well. I'm gonna buy the blu ray version and see if that's any better. What a disappointment, though.

3590206,3,B001G0MFIS,I too think it's not the same without Grissom.  I also think Laurence F. is actually a serial killer far more brilliant than the miniature killer.  CSI needs Grissom to catch him and expose him for the mad man he is.  Bring back Grissom!,1263168000,,237,4.340909090909091

I was concerned that with the original team breaking up, Grissom, leaving in this series of DVD'S and with Warrick, and Sara off the series that it would not be the same.  This happens so often in many good programs.  ""It just isn't the same"" I hear people say.  Yes, this too is the same here, but in this case I think the program will continue on.  Lawrence Fishborne is a very capable and just perfect for this part.  The reason is not just the actors it is the team of people that write the scripts.  You guys are great.

We have all the seasons on DVD (cable not available and don't want a dish) and recently began watching this season. My dismay is not so much with the loss of characters but the increased shock value and gory-ness of the current season. Previous seasons focused more on ""solving the puzzle"" of the crime while this season seems to focus more on the portrayal of the crime (shock value.) The recent episode I watched had a whole sequence at the beginning where a woman was hunted down and strangled (took 1 -2 minutes.) Sorry, I just couldn't watch. The characters haven't really melded yet either which makes for awkward dialogue. Have put it aside for now, may come back to it later.....very disappointed. I guess it was to be expected, most shows don't have a run for this long without the edges starting to fray....",1258502400,3,911,4.595092024539877

To be honest, the only reason we purchased this was to see the conclusion of the Warick Dunn episode. The fact that Grissom leaves the show was a disappointment! Without Warick & Gil Grissom, this show loses all credibility. We do not normally watch this show when it appears on Tv so it doesn't spoil the effect of viewing uninterrupted on DVD. Fishburn is a complete joke and the entire show has lost it's effect from the past. This set starts out ok but then dies a violent death after Grissom leaves the show. We will not be making anymore purchases based on the revised format. I could have saved myself alot of money by not purchasing Season 9; don't make the same mistake I did, don't buy this; it's that bad!",1258502400,6,842,4.26875

NEVER had I been disappointed with a CSI episode and even when I got rid of my TV the only show I rented to watch on my laptop was this show.  And then the funeral of Grissom, Sara, and Warrick happened.  Urgh....I was so disappointed to see these characters leave - especially Grissom.  And I have to say, the mourning of these characters resonated throughout the season.  I still watched every episode but it really was not the same.  With different characters a change is to be expected but the intrigue and the x-factor of this show that made it stand out from the rest seem to have gone as well.  The original cast had an amazing chemistry and they made the show work.  And because of this, the writers were able to go on different tangents with the plot because it was safe to do so with this ensemble cast.  It seems that the episodes on this season were unoriginal and too straightforward for the audience who's been spoilt with such original scripts in the previous seasons.  The whole fun of watching CSI is the uncovering of the mystery in the most unexpected ways.  I couldn't say that about this season's episodes.  The writers need to create new chemistry and develop their characters to a new level quickly or the show may suffer - or worse, I might stop watching.  :(",1256256000,4,1331,4.450413223140496

3590236,3,B001G0MFIS,"This is my second go at this review. My first version said that only the first 10 episodes were worth watching, plus the Sci-Fi episode. However, after re-viewing the whole series, I think that the whole series is excellent. It's difficult, at first, to adjust to CSI without Grissom. William Petersen is such a fine actor, and when he leaves the show, there's a slight ache to be gotten through. However, the rest of the episodes are well-written, well-directed, well-designed and well-acted. All aspects of the show continue to be excellent. The only problems are: 1. Marg Helgenberger has lost her ability to show as much on her lovely face, which has seen too much smoothing out. One cannot fault her, as the pressure on actresses is immense. But her ability to act has been undermined by too much cosmetic surgery. 2. Laurence Fishburne's character is not given any back story. He wears a wedding ring, and this is highlighted in one or two scenes. But no mention of a wife is ever mentioned. We assume that she died. There is no inner conflict apparent. His character is flat. I don't know why his character is played this way. Fishburne is a fine actor. Perhaps the producers/directors/writers felt that the fans would be worn out with personal details, since the first part of the season is all but swamped with personal feelings and relationships. (At times I had to steel myself whenever Jorja Fox appeared, as I grew weary of her character.) But, even so, we need to see a primary character with more depth. That said, the Ninth Season is excellent. The rest of the cast, including the newest CSI and the guest actors, do a superlative job. And the behind-the-scenes team players continue to exceed expectations.",1255824000,,1723,4.785234899328859
3590237,5,B001G0MFIS,Bought this set for a gift. This completes her C.S.I. collection and at a really good price. She's very happy with it.,1255219200,,118,4.409090909090909
3590238,5,B001G0MFIS,"I can understand the disappointment exhibited here with some of the reviews about missing William Peterson's character of ""Gil Grissom.""

Imagine the difficulty for Laurence Fishburne in having to follow in the footsteps of such a popular TV role of iconoclastic ""Grissom""... who's unique approach to Crimes and his quirky love of insects made him almost irreplaceable.

Okay, we all miss Warrick, Sara, and Gil........but let's get a grip and look at this series with a fresh perspective.

I think the writing on this show, as good as it was before, has gotten even better; and the plots have remained fresh, creative, and well constructed.

The solving of the Cliffhanger from Season 8 of ""Warrick Brown's"" murderer was well scripted, with moving roles from all the cast members, especially of course, William Peterson.  When a Crime genre show makes this kind of leap into fine dramatic acting, one can only applaud and start believing in Hollywood scriptwriters once again.

And ""One to Go"".......Peterson's last and final episode was superb. The last moments with him finding Jorja Fox's ""Sara"" in the jungle, was so well directed and acted; it will remain as one of finest romantic scenes in modern television.

Now we all know why we miss ""Gil.""

But I think Laurence Fishburne is one of best actors in Hollywood today, and as inenvious a task as he had in replacing a beloved actor as this was, he is pulling it off with a quirkiness and intelligence that made William Peterson one of our favorites.

His ending scene with George Eads [""Nick Stokes""] in ""Turn Turn Turn"" was some of the best acting I have seen in this complete series.  Eads has matured in his role over the years, and his portrayal of complete frustration and dismay over losing a young teen girl to a tragic death was absolutely wonderful.

Perhaps the remaining actors upon the departure of Peterson, Fox, and Gary Dourdan will now have the freedom to expand their characters in a way that was previously not availed to them; time will only tell.  But a veteran like Fishburne, with 2 Emmys and an Oscar Nomination under his belt, cannot be a bad addition to an already excellent cast.

Like all things in life, ""The Show must go on.""

Five Stars again, for CSI, Las Vegas.",1254960000,24,2251,4.782945736434108
3590239,5,B001G0MFIS,"Some of these reviews are droll, asking for the show to be cancelled or saying it is nothing with Grissom, well that's just not the case!
Peterson's quirky character shall be missed, but Fishburne's somewhat naive yet attentive character is a pleasure to watch. Catherine, Nick, and Greg still remain on the team, each of them doing what they do best and the actors shine as usual. The lab techs are recieving more airtime and Hodges becomes an ever more present character (much to my enjoyment).
The storylines are as interesting as ever (there are quite a few dramatic and emotion-heavy storylines as well), always keep you guessing, and a lot suprises!
I have to say, if you are a true fan of CSI, meaning you watch for the show and not the popularity, this season is excellent, a definate buy.
I have been a CSI fan since the beginning and have no intention to stop watching anytime soon.",1253664000,,892,4.616352201257862
3590240,5,B001G0MFIS,"Television's number one drama has never sat on its hunches or been happy simply coasting along, and the ninth season of CSI: Crime Scene Investigation certainly demonstrated that. Although this season saw the departure of Gil Grissom (William Petersen), the addition of Laurence Fishburne to the cast alongside series fixture Marg Helgenberger - along with the rest of the stellar case - continued pushing the series forward. Once again, C.S.I. storylines grabbed viewers by the head and didn't let go until they were fully satisfied. The arrival of a new character - especially with such an incredible actor - gave the series even more incredible opportunities.

The six-disc set contains all 24 episodes from season nine with a running time of just over 17-hours.

Special Features

Although CBS has reduced the number of ""extras"" on recent releases of CSI seasons - as it has with most of the its TV shows on DVD - they haven't completely cut them out, and fortunately, what remains is the more interesting among them. In total, there are just under 80-minutes of special features, spread over the six discs.

At the top of the list are two Audio Commentaries - the same number as last season, but fewer than seasons prior. Players giving their take on the series and the season include regular actors, writers and executive producers.

The biggest extra, Episode 920 ""A Space Oddity"" - Rats in Space, encompasses a handful of interviews with everyone from producers and actors to director Michael Nankin, the set decorator, and members of the wardrobe, makeup, and costume teams. This nearly 30-minute featurette explores the challenges and technical issues involved in creating an episode based on a real murder at a Sci-Fi convention.

From Zero to 200 in Nine Seasons is another great featurette that explores and details the making of the 200th episode, including interviews with executive producers, director William Friedkin, and actors, who reflect on their experiences. The Goodbye Grissom featurette has similar interviews, explores the reasons for the actor's leaving, and includes a bit of behind-the-scenes footage of his going away party. Finally, a 15-minute featurette entitled Crime Scene Initiation offers interviews with the series' actors and executive producers. Not the most exciting special features, longtime fans of the show will nevertheless be excited to find out how Fishburne and Lee Smith were cast, as well as a bit of background information on their characters' development.

One of the more unusual extras - and one seen less frequently these days - is an option to watch select episodes in CSI Mode (Comprehensive Scientific Information Mode), which presents the episode in ""pop-up style"" with accompanying information on the forensic science behind the story. Finally, there are also about 10-minutes of Deleted Scenes (from six episodes).",1253232000,2,2877,5.227765726681128
3590241,5,B001G0MFIS,"I am a big fan of CSI going all the way back to season 1. They put together the perfect cast for this show. It is very sad that 3 of the main characters left the show practically at the same time. It's very hard for anyone to join an established cast like this without some resentment from long time fans.

Yes. It was really hard for me to watch the show in season 9 with Grissom leaving. And I initially thought that the Ray Langston character was not a good replacement (but you have to give Fishburne his props for courage in joining this much beloved show after Petersen's long tenure), but he grew on me. Yes, I think the writers did try too hard to highlight him, but I think the reviewers who have criticized that the other main characters have been pushed into the background are too critical. I think the other characters are coming along (not as much drama in their personal life as with Grissom, but we have to remember that Langston is new and doesn't know the personnel like Grissom did). It was very refreshing to see the writers giving the ""lab rats"" some face time out of their labs.  I enjoyed watching them expand their horizons (like taking biker gang members' fingerprints and the coroner taking a field trip with Langston to Reno for research).

It's very difficult to accept that Langston is now the main character because unlike Grissom he isn't the supervisor, like Grissom he is extremely intelligent which is great. It's going to take a little time for all the changes to gel and the new people to find their niche. Long time fans don't give up on the show just yet, give the writers and actors a chance to bounce back to their old glory. I like the direction the show is taking and I will look with anticipation for season 10. Remember, the show is different now because the new characters are different, lets give them a chance to grow.",1252800000,7,1865,4.447368421052632

3590243,3,B001G0MFIS,"CSI has been one of the best shows on TV over the last several years. Unfortunately this season is its weakest by far. That's in no small part to the loss of 3 main characters. The two replacements haven't brought much to the show yet either, and I think this show has run its course. With its high ratings, I'm sure they will want to keep this show going ala ER style for as long as possible, even if the whole original cast get replaced. I guess they figure it's the mysteries and tech that keep people watching, but that may be a mistake.
This show really went down hill after Grissom left and the replacement was not a good choice. The show still remains watchable, but it has fallen a great deal from where it was.",1251072000,41,719,4.255474452554744
3590244,3,B001G0MFIS,"Season 9 saw William Petersen leave in the 10th episode. Sara Sidle (Jorja Fox) had already left Vegas after a very traumatic kidnapping (season 8), then Warrick Brown dies at the end of season 8.

The opening episode is Warrick's funeral. Sara returns and she and Grissom have several GSR moments until she realizes she can not remain in Vegas. Over several episodes we see Grissom take a depressing down-turn--is it because of Sara's leaving or Warrick's death or the change he finds in Lady Heather? Grissom even visits Natalie, the serial killer, and discovers her little secret plan. In these episodes, there are more questions than answers. Grissom does leave to find Sara.

Two new CSIs come in. Riley Adams, a smart-mouth woman with some experience, flirts with Greg but doesn't add much more. We get Ray Langston coming in as a new CSI, level 1. And within a few weeks, CSI, as we've known and loved for years, changes to The Ray Langston Show. He's the center of every episode, except one. He knows all, sees all, can do it all--he's the star now.

The regular cast seems to disappear. Greg has few lines, Catherine melts into a background ghost, Riley becomes a wall, and Nick passes thru the episodes as a shadow. What happened?? Did Petersen leave and take all the writers with him?

While I will purchase season 9, I doubt I will ever watch the last half of the season. I'm willing to give Season 10 a chance, but this is not your former CSI.",1245110400,42,1456,4.588461538461538
