8709371,4,B00V5ONBOC,"I've seen all three:  I Spit on Your Grave (original), the remake and I Spit on Your Grave 2.  I enjoyed all 3, but I found ""I Spit on Your Grave 2"" to be the best of the 3.

It had several creative and unpredictable moments (I can't reveal much with out spoiling the events), extra and useful characters for plot progression, more sets to give us a better viewing experience, and more intelligent dialogue. We followed the main character as she made the difficult (and not altogether predictable) attempt at trying to recover from being victimized.

The director and writer allowed the film to take it's time and for us to gradually sense the character's development.

There are a few things I would have liked changed.  But it made for an enjoyable view nonetheless.

As for I Spit on Your Grave (remake), I recommend this over the original as the quality of the filming is better, and the original has not aged well over the years.  It's not that that original was bad, but the original ""feels"" like it's a movie from 40 years ago.  The dialogue is old, the film looks old, the murder scenes (at least the first looked implausible.)

In I Spit on Your Grave (the remake), much of this is cleaned up: the dialogue is smarter, the physical actions in the scenes are tighter and more believable, and the character logic is more reasonable.",1473552000,2,1339,4.564853556485356
8709372,5,B00V5ONBOC,"uh these movies made me feel uneasy.  But ... Hey that's why I bought them in the 1st place.
I liked the 1st one better than the 2nd but the 2nd is just a un-nerving... the 1st just had a better plot / story to be told.",1470096000,3,219,3.6595744680851063
