8021628,1,B000243DD0,"I WAS GROSSLY DISAPPOINTED TO FIND THAT THIS WAS NOT what I expected. I thought it was more wonderful episodes of the show, but it turned out to be nothing but bios of the actors. I love the actors, but that isn't what I wanted. There was nothing in the write up about it being a bio CD. Very disappointing.",1356912000,11,307,4.133333333333334
8021629,5,B000243DD0,"I have been a fan of Are You Being Served? since I was a little kid, watching it on PBS. I'm on my way to collecting the whole set. I have to be honest and say that this one was a little pricey, so it must be the ""hard-to-find"" disc of the 14 piece set.

On a seperate note, for those of you that are going to purchase it, it is not actual episodes ofrom the show, it is a highlight DVD of Mollie Sugden, John Inman and Wendy Richard.",1353888000,10,434,3.8222222222222224
