7851278,5,6303562981,"This was a really interesting show, probably the best MTV ever made. Too bad they canceled it when the second season came out that when their mission was over which was find special artifacts to save the world from the alien invasion. This show is a hell of a lot better then watching the Real World 24 hours a day. Too me this show was better then Beavis and Butt-Head not that I don't like it it's just that at least these people have sense and their not losers their hero's. And it's still comedy too.",1128470400,2,504,4.260416666666667
