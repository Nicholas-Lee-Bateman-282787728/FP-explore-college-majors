Buyer beware!!!",1171324800,6,148,6.4
8111807,1,B000ENZJJA,"There appears to be several of these sketchy CD/DVD sets floating around Amazon. Observe: all the product pages are seller created, all have the same glowing review by the same guy, and none are available through Amazon; surprise surprise, all of them are only available from one Amazon Marketplace Seller, probably the same genius who wrote all the glowing reviews. Stupid, greedy people. Get a job or something.",1150416000,18,413,5.088235294117647
8111808,5,B000ENZJJA,"Loved it, loved it, loved it! If you're a DAVID GILMOUR and PINK FLOYD fan, you can't go wrong with this excellent set performance. If you're particularly blessed with a large screen TV and accompanying surround-sound speaker system, crank up the sound and let 'er rip! I went to bed with it in my mind, woke up with it still in my mind. Enjoy",1141171200,3,343,4.375
