I know people talk about the old days being genteel and all, but this is overkill. I felt sorry for Loretta Young's character having such a mean ""mother"". Not a bad movie, but not a very realistic one either.",1496448000,,320,4.095238095238095
7836849,5,6303050182,"This is great!  Just what you want in an old movie - does not disappoint.  Farm girl makes it in the big city + Una Merkel doing cartwheels.  Glamor, humor, and (SPOILER ALERT) happy ending!",1428624000,,190,4.371428571428571

7836851,3,6303050182,"A Kansas girl joins a New York chorus and needs to be rescued from a villanious producer: Travelling salesman Jimmy Decker (David Manners, God help us all) falls in love with a young Kansas beauty Marion Cullen (Loretta, natch - at 19) even though he's engaged to Enid Hollister, his bosses daughter.  Marion is a talented composer, and when her foster parents reveal that she's really the illegitimate daughter of a showgirl, she leaves for NYC. Once there, she discovers Jimmy's engagement, and realising that he cannot do anything for her, she and dancer Dixie Dare (the cute, 29 year-old Una Merkel) interview with the notorious theatrical agent Ford Humphries (Louis Calhern - who was once married to Natalie Schafer in real life).  Humphries is impressed by Marion's talent and beauty and and he offers her the use of his apartment.  Marion gently turns down his ""kindly"" offer - but they keep seeing each other somehow...A fairly interesting flick for Pre-Code fans. Look for 57 year-old Elizabeth Patterson - aka Mrs. Trumbull - as Mrs. Cullen.",1043712000,3,1052,4.965909090909091
7836852,3,6303050182,"Although this is a typical pre-code melodrama, slow andpredictable, the stars are great to watch.  The beautiful LorettaYoung appears as the heroine, a small town 'good' girl, who falls for the guy from the big city.  After finding out that the guy is engaged, Loretta sets her sights on Broadway.  She meets Una Merkel while waiting for a show job interview.  Una is probably the best 'pal' supporting actress of her day.  She brings wit and charm to an otherwise slow production. (also a revealing lingerie scene!).  This film is recommended for fans of Loretta or Una Merkel or for fans of pre-code dramas.  I liked the movie and I really liked Loretta Young. She was one of the most talented actresses to come out of Hollywood in the 30's.",961718400,15,743,4.6692307692307695
