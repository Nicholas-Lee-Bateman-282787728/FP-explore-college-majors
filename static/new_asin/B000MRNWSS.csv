2744964,5,B000MRNWSS,"This dance fantasy inspired by Alice in Wonderland is quite unique. The music, costumes, and sets are all wonderful. A most lovely Alice and a stern Queen are the two main characters. Yes, this story begins with dark and sinister overtones, but that is to reflect the personality of the Queen and her subjects. As the story continues you will see how and why the tone changes, and that is the beauty of this story. Note the exchange scene and how Alice handles it (being vague to avoid spoiler). I love the symbolic gesture in that scene and how things change thereafter. I highly recommend this to fans of Alice in Wonderland and dance.",1208563200,7,637,4.5964912280701755

8171428,2,B000MRNWSS,"I bought this because I collect Alice in Wonderland movies and things.

I have to give this a bad review. Its less than half an hour long, and a lot of it is abstract to the point of not really being able to tell whats going on. The choreography is unimpressive, there is a lot of just hopping with intermittent wiggling and walking around in circles.

At the end of the day, its an obscure strange thing that I'm glad is in my collection, but if you are looking for just something to watch and enjoy there are far better versions.",1390694400,,531,4.247524752475248

It just didn't do much for me, though. Many vignettes within this came across as clever - the chess game and Tweedledum/Tweedledee, in particular. The Alice plot seemed a bit scrambled, and the conversion of Red Queen to Black Queen made me wonder whether part of the Sleeping Beauty plot had gotten mixed in.

Add in the fact that dance really isn't my medium. I can often appreciate the pageant, the athleticism of dance, and the grace of the human animal in motion, but I'm way out of my element in trying to ""get"" the choreography. On the whole, I came away feeling that this could be a great experience for a viewer that I'm not.

8171431,3,B000MRNWSS,"This is one in a series of reviews that will eventually be posted for every Alice in Wonderland title available on Amazon. When the Tim Burton rendition of AIW with Johnny Depp was due out in 2010 I thought it might be a good time to go back and watch the benchmark Walt Disney production from 1951, which I saw -or assumed I saw- as a child. It was a chance to get reacquainted with the many varied characters from the story as sort of a warm up for the Burton film. Upon viewing the Disney classic I was astonished to realize that I had likely never seen more than a few clips (at most) of that beautifully rendered Alice in Wonderland. So much seemed brand new. Nor did I have a memory of ever seeing any other ""Alice"" production. Then I realized that I had never read the book! Wait a minute. Where then did my memory of the Alice story come from? The curiosity sparked by that question ultimately led me over the next two years to accumulate every version of Alice in Wonderland still in existence. Well over 40 by the way!

This general commentary continues over in the review sections for both the 1951 AIW production from Walt Disney (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Alice-in-Wonderland-Masterpiece-Edition/dp/B0000TG9E2/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Alice in Wonderland (Masterpiece Edition)</a>) and the 2010 production starring Johnny Depp (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Alice-in-Wonderland/dp/B001HN694K/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Alice in Wonderland</a>). As these are the two most well known Alice's, rather then attempt to add yet-another-review for those two films, it seemed like it might be a more fun use of the provided space to muse a bit on the popularity and remarkable longevity of the story spawned by Lewis Carroll in 1865, as well as to share with you a bit of what I picked up while watching these 40 or so renderings of Alice in Wonderland. All other Alice productions listed by Amazon have a specific review for that title.

Review of this 1993 production of Alice in Wonderland...  (this review contains spoilers)

This production is a highly abstracted rendering of the Alice in Wonderland story. As I've experienced the various ""Alice"" productions from 1903 down through what is at this point the 90's, it becomes apparent that there is a very broad range of how much a particular production adheres to, or moves away from, the original Lewis Carroll story. Some efforts try to stick pretty close to the sequence of adventures in the original book, while other productions take liberties by dropping certain passages from the first book, or adding passages from the sequel... or both. Some films adhere to the basic Alice in Wonderland structure but severely depart in the enactments of the scenes, while others use the Alice story as a mere jumping off point on the way to telling a completely different tale.

This short ballet piece is in the latter range. While watching, you have to remind yourself that this is Alice in Wonderland. None of the familiar encounters Alice experiences in the book seem to occur here. In fact, only three of the original characters from the book are listed in the credits. I enjoyed the performance though. It is actually rather sweet, and the young lady playing Alice, Eva Zamazalova, is endearing (I normally list the age of the actress playing Alice, but I could not locate Eva's birth date online. She appears to be around 10).

I had trouble ascertaining the meaning of this performance though. Familiar symbolism was elusive. I would love someone who understands dance and ballet explain to me what was going on here. In the meantime, just for fun, I would like to take a poke at it...

The piece begins with Alice apparently frustrated with her ""black"" cat (known for their magical powers). The cat keeps climbing around on the furniture in Alice's room and irritating her. Finally Alice tosses a ball of red yarn in the cat's direction, but instead the yarn veers toward the mirror behind the cat. However, instead of bouncing harmlessly off the mirror the yarn ball passes right through it. This launches Alice into Wonderland, with a giant close up of the black cat leading the transition.

Then a bunch of performers emerge and start dancing in a way that seems to emulate a clock in the mirror running backwards (possibly). Then we see the black cat morph into a black queen! It seems Alice's cat is cross with her for the yarn toss, and is getting even. The black queen puts Alice through an ordeal, and to make a long story short, Alice survives the ordeal triumphantly. The dancers parade her around on their shoulders, pelt the black queen with yarn balls, and ultimately the queen crowns Alice, gives her back the red ball of yarn, and everyone is happy.

This is a very creative performance even if it's not very `Alice like'. I think one clue about how this production came to be is that it is actually based on the music, which is entitled ""Two Worlds"". Which explains the occasional dark tones.

To close, I would like to offer a comment to the reviewers who seemed put off by music, in terms of exposing their children to the performance. We should remember that the Alice in Wonderland story is itself somewhat dark. Alice is often shown to be scared as she encounters one contradictory character after another in Wonderland. Therefore some, although relatively few, productions attempt to recreate that mood. Point being, not all Alice in Wonderland productions are necessarily suitable for young children. ;>

UPDATE: Having finished ""Through the Looking Glass, and What Alice Found There"", a few weeks after posting this review, this dance fantasy makes more sense. The performance seems to be drawn more from this latter book. In 'Through the Looking Glass...' a black kitten is present when Alice steps through the mirror as well as when she returns from the other side. In fact Alice even ponders... almost accuses even.. the black kitty as having been the red (translates to black) queen in her dream. Furthermore, the rabbit in the performance is wearing a hat. A Mad Hatter style hat! Now I think I see why. The only two characters from the original book that show up in Looking Glass are the March Hare and the Mad Hatter. Although the name ""rabbit"" is given in the credits, the creature in the performance seems to be an amalgam of the aforementioned characters.

Wow. This is starting to make all too much sense (for Wonderland). It seems then that this dance performance is really emulating Alice's almost 'Divine Comedy' like journey that took place in Lewis Carroll's sequel. Mostly. Anyway. :>
