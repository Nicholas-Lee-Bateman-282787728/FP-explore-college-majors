7844597,5,6303366546,"Though it's not a masterwork like ""The General"" or ""Steamboat Bill Jr."", ""Go West"" perhaps has more heart than any other Keaton film.

""Friendless"" Buster, after being literally downtrodden in the big city, heads West, where he finds friendship in the most unlikely of leading ladies -- an equally forsaken little cow named Brown Eyes. Keaton manages to make this implausible relationship believable, which it has to be, since the logic of the film hinges on it. Pulling off this cinematic magic displays a new and surprising side of Keaton's virtuosity as an actor and director.

The pace is slower than most Keaton movies, and it lacks the spectacular and stunning acrobatic stunts Keaton is famous for, but don't let that deter you. It's still fresh and new after more than 80 years.

The two shorts, ""The Paleface"" and ""The Scarecrow"", are more typical Keaton fare, with clever sight gags, gizmos galore, and fine Keaton stunts - including a scene in which he crosses a river on his hands, I guess to avoid getting his shoes wet.

This trio of films would make a great addition to any film library, and would be particularly welcome in the collection of a Buster Keaton fan.",1252281600,,1178,4.788177339901478
7844598,5,6303366546,"This is one of my favourite Buster Keaton films. It was different, with Buster playing 'Friendless' who goes west looking for prosperity. He ends up on a ranch and meets 'Brown Eyes'-a cow. He becomes friends with the 4  legged beauty after removing a stone from her hoof. He protects her and  vice versa, until she is to be sent away for slaughtering, and Buster goes  with her, but can he save her, and get the thousands of cattle with her to  the stockyards? Superbly funny and sentimental, and the last time Buster  wore his traditional costume of baggy trousers, slapshoes and clip on tie.  Buster actually trained 'Brown Eyes' himself. In the film, Buster is asked  to smile during a card game, but does he-? THE SCARECROW is one of my  favourite short's. It is about Buster and his friend (Joe Roberts) who are  farmhands, and are in  love with the same girl (Sybil Seely). The opening  is spectacular, showing an amazing house full of tricks, which has to be  seen to be believed. The madness continues with Buster being chased by a  'Mad Dog', who is actually Roscoe Arbuckle's faithful mutt. It ends with a  chase and an elopement, and a river! Extremely funny and visually stunning.  THE PALEFACE is about Buster, who stumbles across Indian territory and is  chased away. It is madcap humour and fast paced with some amazing stunts in  the wilderness and crazy sight gags. All three films are in perfect  condition and show a variety of his skills. It is a great starter for  anyone wanting to see Buster!",955065600,2,1516,4.631578947368421
