8419890,3,B004AAJJTE,"I saw the movie on DVD that day and i checked out the release date here it says 2001, i was shocked Cos Sunny looks straight out of his ZIDDI days(1997) and Chunky and Naseer look younger Then i read the trivia which says the film had started in 1995 and had to have Sunny in a guest role which was extended and the film was sold as Sunny's film which led to a fight and the delay which shows

The movie is trite which was sold as Sunny's films post GHAYAL It has a mega loud and annoying Chunky Pandey who wears purple suits and orange pants It has Naseeruddin Shah doing nonsense and getting old in scenes(is it just me who noticed his white hair in some scenes) Sunny Deol is his usual self Neelam makes an appearance after HSSH where she was a side actress here she pairs with Sunny after the tripe VISHNU DEVAA(1992)",1302134400,,821,4.19620253164557
