4187601,2,B003S21TIY,"I really wanted to like this DVD.  I took a non-pregnancy bellydancing course years ago and had fun, so I thought this seemed perfect, especially with all the good reviews!  Unfortunately, it turned out quite dull.  You do a few stretches, then stand in place doing hip circles and hip figure-eights for the rest of the session.  There's virtually no difference between the beginner and advanced workouts.  The advanced one has you extend a stretch further, and you change motions a little more frequently.  My (very supportive) husband, who has never tried bellydancing motions in his life and may actually not know where his hips even are, could easily do both the beginner and advanced workouts along with me.
On the plus side, the scene is calming, and you do get some pleasant stretches in.  The instructor is calm and not overly talkative, which is great compared to some of the hyperactive instructors out there.
I did watch the instructor's labor story with interest.  While I don't know if I'll use any of her techniques or not, I do understand how rhythmic movements could help with pain management and relaxation.
I'm at 6 months pregnant now, and have done the DVD maybe 4 times between my 5th and 6th month of pregnancy.  I'm not sure if I'll pick it up again or not... I just felt it was boring and had no challenge.  I wish there was more actual moving around, or something to raise your heart rate a bit.",1295913600,5,1420,4.644
4187602,5,B003S21TIY,I am 39 weeks now and this is the only exercise video I still use. It targets the areas I need most at this point (HIPS/BACK/LEGS). It does help me relax especially when I have back pain or when I am tired. I enjoy the stretch exercises/movements. The music and instructions are okay but the entire exercise is easy to follow.  I am glad I bought it. Worth the money.,1291680000,3,367,4.242857142857143
4187603,5,B003S21TIY,"I am 6 months pregnant, and was having horrible sciatica, to the point where I could barely walk.  I got this dvd and it has totally helped me, I barely have pain at all anymore!  I like this dvd a lot, it feels great, goes at a nice pace, and I really like the teacher.  She is not annoying, and she is very warm and positive.  I also really like that she does not have a big fake smile plastered on her face every second like in lots of workout videos.
I did not exercise regularly before I got pregnant, but I have a really physical job and always running around, and I played drumset in a high energy band, so I think I was in pretty decent shape.  I'm sure if you were already doing belly dance before you got pregnant this would seem too basic, but it is great for me.  It is really fun, feels so good, and I am so happy that I found a way to relieve my sciatica pain.  Thumbs up!",1286668800,5,886,3.9717514124293785
4187604,5,B003S21TIY,I love the Perfect Pregnancy workout series.  Started doing this workout at 36 weeks and wish I could have gotten it sooner because it is absolutely awesome to prep for delivery.  I tried beginner the first week and switched to advanced after doing beginner 3 times.  The instructor is really knowledgeable and the movements are great during the 3rd trimester to get you moving your body in a fluid way that will really help with labor.  I feel sexy and empowered doing this workout and can't wait to use it when I labor!,1286150400,7,521,4.56989247311828
4187605,5,B003S21TIY,"This video is designed to teach you moves to use during labor to move you along and decrease your discomfort by isolating your hips and moving them in round, fluid ways.  I started using the video in my second trimester and I really expect it will help me on the big day.  I'm sure that all pregnant woman will benefit from this workout, regardless of how pregnant they are, their age, shape, and/or fitness level.

The DVD has a Beginning and an Advanced workout and each is 30 minutes long.  Unless you've taken belly dance before, start with the Beg session. Most of us aren't used to moving our bodies the way the instructor shows, but even if things feel awkward at first, you'll get the hang of it in just a few workouts.  The movements feel wonderful and the routine is fun. The time will fly by!

The best part is the clip that shows the instructor using these moves during her labor. It is so motivational!!!",1283472000,20,917,4.428571428571429
4187606,5,B003S21TIY,"Oh my gosh, I love this video!!  First of all, I had a rough first trimester and had to get back into exercising slowly.  I have been doing prenatal yoga and prenatal pilates.  This is the PERFECT addition to my workout library!  I so love this work out! To be more specific, here are some of the  reasons I LOVE this video:

1.  It is fun to do!  We all need to vary our routine, and this does the trick.  You won't be bored.

2. It feels good.  The flowing motions of bellydance are actually calming to me.  There are two levels, beginner and advanced.  I started with beginner to be on the safe side.  I found it very easy to do, but still felt like I got exercise for me and the baby.

3. The instructor is wonderful!  Elisa Llamido is very knowledgable and also pregnant right along with me!  I like the fact that she switches her right and left, so that to me, as I watch, I can follow along as she mirrors the movements.  You do not have to have any prior bellydance knowledge to do this video.  You can feel good about yourself and your body image. (even a little sexy!)  Elisa is an inspiration to me, because I watched the bonus on her labor and delivery story.  WOW!  That's all I can say is WOW, and thank you Elisa for being an inspiration and teaching me something.  If some of these techniques and movements will help me with my labor, then I am certainly going to try it!

4. The music is also great.  I enjoy the different drum rhythms that go along with the dance.  To me, it is very calming.

***** 5 STARS, and I will definitely do this workout throughout this pregnancy and for my next one as well.  A MUST have for preggie mammas!",1282780800,24,1652,4.17515923566879
4187607,5,B003S21TIY,"I'm just starting my third trimester and I've been getting more and more worried about labor. My sister had a really, really tough time and I was with her through it all. She had an epidural, but she was in labor for 17 hours without it before the doctor let her come to the hospital. I've been dreading the same experience.

I was a little skeptical about buying a bellydance dvd, but I was desperate and after I saw a video about this on YouTube, it seemed like it was worth a shot.

The first time I tried it I waited until my husband was at work and I closed the blinds before popping it into the DVD player. Seriously, I'm as big as a house- I didn't want to scare anyone or embarrass myself.

I was surprised at how much fun it was! The garden setting is really beautiful and the drums are very soothing and inspiring. Thirty-five minutes flew by and at the end of it I felt very loose and energized- better than I have in weeks.

I've done it three more times since then and I'm really starting to get into it. It makes me feel better about myself than I have in months and I find that it's a workout that I actually look forward to doing. I hope that it will make a difference in labor!",1278633600,15,1194,4.133620689655173
4187608,5,B003S21TIY,"Love this video. I exercised on a moderate basis before getting pregnant.  This included kickboxing, yoga, running and core workouts.  This video is good if you miss doing yoga and getting a good stretch. The moves were also a little challenging in the beginning if you have never done belly dancing.  When I am finished with this video I feel like I have gotten a good workout and also feel relaxed and stretched out.",1404345600,,418,4.621621621621622
4187609,5,B003S21TIY,This literally eliminated my back pain! It was easy for someone like me who couldn't handle much activity while pregnant and it gave me the energy I needed to get through the day. I highly recommend,1400803200,,198,4.527777777777778
4187610,4,B003S21TIY,"Easy to follow. Great for beginners, explains dance moves. Music can be annoying to listen to for others in the room since it's just drums, though it helps you to keep in rhythm.",1399852800,,178,4.424242424242424
4187611,4,B003S21TIY,This is a different type of workout (for me).  I thought it was good for abs.  I enjoyed the fact that it was different that the typical workout videos.  It was surprisingly hard too!,1399593600,,183,4.323529411764706
4187612,5,B003S21TIY,"Fun, and great for beginners through experienced belly dancers, this DVD offers a soothing and sexy way to keep in shape. This also offers a chance to stay in tuned with you body and its range of motion through pregnancy. I plan to implement the moves I've learned in this DVD during labor in hopes I can manage a four-hour labor just like the young woman instructing. Enjoy your pregnancy and this DVD.",1394064000,,403,4.534246575342466
4187613,4,B003S21TIY,"This video does soooo much for the ever changing body, The relaxing drums are amazing for unwinding and the moves definitely help with all the different body pains that come along with being pregnant,, especially lower back and pelvis.",1391990400,,235,5.051282051282051
4187614,4,B003S21TIY,"This workout is a good toning workout, nice and soothing. I can see how this will increase flexibility and maintain some shape during pregnancy.",1391126400,,144,5.041666666666667
4187615,4,B003S21TIY,My hip flexor was really tight. Workout loosen hip flexor and I got good workout.  Felt funny at first... Like a robot. But started to enjoy workout.,1379721600,,149,4.518518518518518
4187616,4,B003S21TIY,"I'm four weeks away from my due date, and this is a great video to wind down the pregnancy with as my thoughts turn to labor. I had been doing the Perfect Pregnancy Workout Vol. 1, which is amazing, everyday to keep myself in shape. However, in the past week or two my belly has just become so big, that workout was getting a little too intense. I think the belly dancing workout is a great transitional video to do to prepare your body for the demands of labor. She ends the two workouts on the video with a five-minute visualization during which you're supposed to get into an uncomfortable position and picture yourself in labor, doing your belly dance moves.",1379203200,2,662,4.479338842975206
4187617,5,B003S21TIY,"Perfect workout for me!! I had terrible problems with pinching discs while I was pregnant, osteopath only helped while he was working my spine. He recommended I needed movement, but I couldn't walk more than a few steps without excruciating pain... Bellydancing brought immediate relief and was the best thing I could have done to improve bloodflow to my back and my baby, while also strengthening my birthing muscles. I had a wonderful labour and 'danced' the baby down. Having put in the hard miles beforehand was what made my labour infinitely shorter than what it would have been otherwise. Thank you Elisa for a fun way to workout and ensuring my baby had the best start in life :)",1376784000,,686,4.725
4187618,5,B003S21TIY,"Fantastic workout. I feel great after I use it, especially my core and my back. Fun workout that teaches helpful labor moves.",1373587200,,125,4.7272727272727275
4187619,5,B003S21TIY,This is a fantastic DVD! It's short and very easy to learn! It is wonderful for any stage of pregnancy. The movements are wonderful for labor & birth. I would highly recommend!,1367625600,2,176,4.53125
4187620,4,B003S21TIY,"The cons: I have a background in dance (ballet and modern) and yoga, so I find the movements rather simple. I did the introduction to basic movement and the beginner workout once, just to make sure I was familiar with everything, and I now stick with the advanced routine. Even that isn't very difficult to master.

Obviously, most of the workout is concentrated on the core. You get a small amount of arm work through holding your arms in the basic dancing positions, but I wouldn't call this a full body workout.

The pros: I have felt my core getting stronger and more ""open"" thanks to the movements this workout teaches. I feel like the key to this workout is to learn the movements enough so that they will be second nature during labor, so the simplicity of the movements doesn't bother me. (I will try to write an update after my labor; I'm curious how well this preparation will work for me.)

The music is simple rhythmic drumming, which I find relaxing. The voice recording is quiet and meditative, and you can turn the voice cues off if you want. I sometimes like a good sweaty, high energy workout, but with the low energy levels that pregnancy can bring, I find myself gravitating more towards more calm workouts. I think this workout still gets the job done, I just don't feel exhausted by the end of it!

Overall: This, along with Laura Dutta's prenatal yoga and the 10-minute Prenatal Pilates workout, is my go-to exercise DVD. I highly recommend using this DVD within a diverse exercise regimen.

UPDATE: I did end up giving birth without medical interventions, and there were times during labor where I used my belly dancing practice. Belly dancing did not make the contractions painless, but it helped to move through them rather than to fight them. (I was a lot more comfortable when I was just using my Hypnobirthing relaxation techniques, but when I wanted to speed labor along I used belly dancing.) Near the end of my labor, the baby wasn't positioned correctly, and the doctor had to move her before I could push... I had hoped that belly dancing would help with baby positioning (see spinningbabies.com for more on that subject), so I was disappointed, but ultimately I was still able to have the natural birth I'd hoped for. So, I wouldn't say this DVD is a magic guarantee for an easy birth, but I would still recommend it as part of your preparations for an easy, joyful birth!",1367366400,2,2406,4.63849765258216
4187621,4,B003S21TIY,"I bought this DVD b/c I saw a clip on youtube about her using bellydance during labor, and how it helped reduce discomfort and pain while speeding up the delivery process. The intro ""warm-up"" became a bit repetitve, and some of the moves really stretch my abdominal muscles in a new way. But overall, I enjoyed doing all the moves, and do believe that they will help me during labor.

I really liked the instructor and the intros she gives into bellydancing and how they can help--I found what she said to be helpful and on point. I wish the people who made the DVD made the options more clear on the DVD menu--I totally missed her intros the first few times I watched it.",1365292800,,672,4.376
4187622,2,B003S21TIY,The lady stands there the entire time hardly moving. I got more out of the promo video. I tried several times to get into it but it was useless. Too much money for such a boring video. Charge half the prize and I would have let it slide.,1364947200,,237,3.9583333333333335
4187623,5,B003S21TIY,"Enjoyable workout, good for times I'd like to loosen my body but don't have a large time frame. I've used at home bellydance workouts since high school, so had no touble learning the advanced routine. I enjoy the reminder to kegel, I forget that otherwise! :D

Overall, I would definately suggest adding this to your repertoire of pregnancy/labor preparation videos.

(Currently 32 weeks pregnant)",1361404800,3,397,5.1875
4187624,3,B003S21TIY,I bought 3. This was my least favorite. The dance was fun but the warm ups were really repetitive. Not easy to skip to the next section.,1358380800,,136,4.074074074074074
4187625,5,B003S21TIY,"I loved doing this workout during the last trimester of my pregnancy, especially. It really helped to loosen me up. The movements are gentle and very helpful during those last few weeks. Great for loosening your hips and toning the abs. It also helped tremendously during labor. The hip circles really help you get through contractions. I couldn't have imagined not doing this workout!",1354924800,4,385,5.03125
4187626,5,B003S21TIY,I have enjoyed learning the various belly dance moves to use in labor. She goes through the motions slowly enough for even me to learn them. I am now in my 38th week and can follow her without a problem.,1349049600,3,203,4.1
4187627,5,B003S21TIY,"I had several exercise videos that I liked during pregnancy, but this was by far the best.  I did the moves sporadically in the beginning of my pregnancy (like a stretch day - the workout isn't too hard), but used it a lot later in my pregnancy (it ends up being a fairly challenging workout in the third trimester).  I also relied on these moves during my labor to get me through the contractions.  Also, my family (two sets of grandparents and my husband) really enjoyed watching me dance my way through labor!",1332806400,8,512,4.483870967741935
4187628,4,B003S21TIY,"I enjoyed using this as a workout during my pregnancy.  It's fast-paced and brief (30 minutes for each the beginner and advanced -- sometimes I'd do both back-to-back because one didn't feel like quite enough).  I was looking for more understanding of how to use belly dance during labor, though, and this really did not provide.  I enjoyed the brief documentary of the instructor's experience using belly dance during her labor, but would have really liked more specifics.  I found those and a much more extensive understanding of how to use belly dance in ""<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Dance-of-the-Womb-A-Gentle-Guide-to-Belly-Dance-for-Pregnancy-and-Birth/dp/B005LDE4HQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Dance of the Womb: A Gentle Guide to Belly Dance for Pregnancy and Birth</a>.""  That program has a longer warm-up and 6 dance chapters teaching specific movements, so it's more customizable to what your body wants on any given day.  There's also a beautiful 50-minute documentary of the instructor's homebirth using belly dance and a discussion with some Australian midwives talking about the benefits of belly dance during pregnancy and labor (the program is from Australia, so you also get the benefit of the great accent!).  I learned a huge amount from Dance of the Womb, and though it was a little more expensive, it was completely worth it (just think about how much in-person classes cost, and you'll see it's really extremely affordable for what it is!).  During my labor, I came back again and again to the movements I learned there and the visualizations that the instructor helps lead you through.  The two programs were a good balance to each other, though -- this briefer program came in handy on days when time was limited and I felt like moving faster, and ""Dance of the Womb"" when I wanted to move more at my own pace and delve more deeply into the movements.  Belly dance is an absolutely fantastic tool for birth -- it got me through a LONG labor with deep back pain to a healthy, natural birth.  (BTW, keeping up belly dance after the birth is a great tool for recovery -- enjoy!)",1329782400,6,2141,5.194767441860465
4187629,5,B003S21TIY,"I am finally sitting down to write this review and I can't say enough positive things about this DVD.  I used it as often as possible during pregnancy (a few times per week).  During pregnancy, it was very helpful to stretch out the muscles around my hips and pelvis.  It also helped out for heart burn issues.  The true value of this DVD came out during labor.  This was my second labor and I truly believe that this is the missing piece to labor preparation.  It works.  These belly dancing moves helped me progress through labor very quickly and also significantly reduced all discomfort.  There was a HUGE difference between my labors and I think that most labor preparation programs miss the importance of movement during labor.  Visualization and breath only gets you so far.  Belly dancing should be taught everywhere.  If/when I get pregnant again, there is no question that I will pick this DVD up again.",1328313600,23,913,4.715189873417722
4187630,5,B003S21TIY,"I have been hesitant with workout videos, because they tend to be too mellow, and I like a little sweat now and then. I initially did the ""beguinner's"" section of this dvd and was a bit bored, because it was too slow for me. But the next few times i've done the advanced section. It is so much fun, i love to see my belly in the mirror swaying, you can do your own versions of movements, get lost in the drums and just dance along with the instructor. The 30 minutes go by so quick, and you don't even realize it. I also saw there is an ""instructional"" section, where they break down the moves and explain them to you. I am not sure how fun that part is. But i do absolutely LOVe this video. I just wish you could vary the music, i guess i could always add my own soundtrack.",1323302400,2,775,4.038961038961039
4187631,4,B003S21TIY,"I was very excited to get this DVD in the mail. When it arrived (in a timely fashion) I quickly tried it out. I really had a lot of fun doing all of the moves and it was very easy to pick up the steps. I wouldn't quite call it a workout though. It was more relaxing than anything else. I didn't walk away out of breath or tired, and I'm not sure if it has actually toned anything, but it has kept me active after sitting at work all day.
I joke with my family and friends and tell them I am going to belly dance my way through labor, but I do plan to use some of these moves during labor as I am planning a natural delivery. I will let you know how that goes in a few months.",1319500800,3,675,3.76056338028169
4187632,5,B003S21TIY,"This video was immensely helpful to me during my pregnancy and I would recommend to all pregnant ladies.  I have never done belly dancing before and think that she actually does a good job explaining how to move your body during the workout.  The movements helped my pelvis/hips/back relax and felt very good to me and was fun.  I started doing this video a couple times a week when I was about 29-30 weeks pregnant and by week 42 it was the only video I could comfortably do.
This video also helped me get through labor and I actually used it during early labor.  I was able to have a medication free labor and I would attribute it to having a good plan for what to do through contractions.  My goal was to keep moving my hips through each contraction- using whatever move I could do; in addition to deep breathing/counting mental exercises.  The relaxation/visualization at the end of the program did help me in this- in addition to having a great husband coaching me.
I would not hesitate to buy this again and hope that others find this helpful.  I also recommend the Perfect Pregnancy Vol 1- it is a hard workout, and became too difficult towards the end of pregnancy but kept me strong early on.  Prenatal yoga was also invaluable.",1313452800,20,1237,4.515695067264574
4187633,3,B003S21TIY,"Oh Dear...I really, really, really wanted to like this DVD.
I loved her interview on You Tube.  She didn't look or sound kooky and she didn't look like she was using belly dance for some ceremony later on.  I just wanted the birthing, hip opening, baby positioning effect.

I'm sure she knows what she's doing but...a teacher she may not be.  I love DVD's for working out.  I can't afford to go to the gym and I have 3 kids (5,3 and 9 months and I'm 6 months pregnant).  I am 'into' natural childbirth and I know a great deal about my...pelvic bowl anatomy. :)  I own and do the Hab-It DVD, Hypnobabies for childbirth hypnosis and I love medical research...So, onto my review.
I tried to research what I thought was the best DVD, waited for it to come and tried it out immediately.  First a little background.  I'm in really decent shape.  I try to walk everyday on a treadmill at moderate/high speed and use weight training and cardio DVD's about 3-4 times a week.  And, I did workout to a belly dance DVD before this one but found that every time that particular instructor explained a move they would zoom in on her face and you couldn't SEE her body.  I was working out to Jillian Michaels when I got pregnant (not that I could still work out to her).

When I started this DVD I didn't get past the warm-up.  She does a 'flat back' arms outstretched thingy but doesn't clearly explain what the angle of the arms are or whether to keep your legs straight or whether to shift your weight or keep it centered. She literally calls this move the ""flat back"" but she is moving her arms and her back? Do I hold my Transverse abdominis?  or do I relax it?  I bought this DVD so that I could do it during childbirth and...use it to relax and open my pelvis.  Somebody tell me:  When do I let it all hang out? :) hheheheheh

I have lots of rhythm and I have no problem keeping up with dance steps.  I do, however, think it is a priority to keep my pelvis aligned, know which way my tail bone is pointing and are my stomach muscles in vs out when appropriate.  I ended up with over-separation of my pubic area or 'pelvic girdle' pain with my 2nd pregnancy after doing an advanced prenatal pilates DVD but...I guess I wasn't advanced enough for it (It said beginner's on it with Niece Pecenka).
So, the point...If you know how to belly dance and do vertical figure 8's, horizontal figure 8's, rib rolls, etc. then go for this DVD.  If you need more than just visual cueing then please....Listen to me (because money is tight and I really hate that I can't benefit like I want from this DVD), and try another DVD.  I think I'm going to try Amira's DVD.  Everyone says how long and great it is.  The twins, Veena and Deena (or something like that) look more instructional also.  I am greatful if for nothing else that once I know what I'm doing, I can turn this DVD on and benefit from a change of scene from a nice person.  Be blessed!",1313366400,6,2926,4.291970802919708
4187634,5,B003S21TIY,"I believe this video is a great pregnancy workout video! I bought it in my 3rd trimester when I began working out. It's easy and fun to do. I had also bought two other workout videos but once I started doing this one I quit using the other. Its great for someone who doesn't have alot of time. Another great thing about it is you don't have to keep getting up and down off the floor. I really think it helped me during labor as well. Between my first and second childbirth, I went from pushing 45 minutes to 13 minutes. I also when from having to get so many stitches the Dr. wouldn't tell me to 4! I think it eased the whole process tremendously and I would recommend it to everybody. I can't wait to use it for my next pregnancy!!",1311984000,5,732,4.125874125874126
4187635,3,B003S21TIY,"I bought this because the lady who is leading the workout had a fast and painless labor.  She advertises that she was able to do this because of belly dancing.  Seeing as this was called ""Belly dance for labor"" I thought I'd be shown in detail moves I could try during my own labor.  Instead I was shown about a 25-30 minute ""workout"".  There is NO guidance on how to do the moves properly.  As someone who has never once attempted belly dancing I felt clumsy and foolish, unsure if I was doing the moves right.  I'm sure had I done it more, I would have gotten the hang of it, but again, never assured I was doing it right.  So here are my biggest negative points on this DVD:
-No explanation or guidance on how to do moves properly.
-Nothing at all remotely related to how to use this during labor.  If she didn't want to put it in the actual workout, she could have easily set aside a 10 minute section showing various, isolated moves, and how to use them properly during labor.
-This DVD isn't really a workout.  It's a nice, simple dance routine that probably gets your heart moving less than a walk.  I'm fine that it doesn't do that, but the DVD is called a ""workout"" and it simply isn't.

If you've done belly dancing before and are looking for a DVD to guide you during your pregnancy, this is probably a good bet.  But if you're hoping to get what the title implies-a workout that is geared toward helping you in labor-you won't get that w/ this DVD.",1309392000,7,1460,4.288321167883212
4187636,4,B003S21TIY,"This video is pretty fun. I was already doing some belly dancing before pregnancy and when i found this video i was extremely excited!! It comes with 2 levels and the first is pretty easy and basic. the dancing is appropriate for when you are later in pregnancy. the ""harder"" level is not any different than the first except for a few more shimmies and tummy roll, i was VERY dissapointed to find that out when i moved up to the second level. BUT overall its a great video, she helps you learn what you need to use for delivery and even tho the repitition is mundane the after affect is great for your muscles. started doing this video at 3 months and do it every other day together with a yoga video and im now currently over 7 months and i still like it.",1303257600,2,756,4.220689655172414
4187637,4,B003S21TIY,"I was a little hesitant to start this. I kept thinking I would look silly, but honestly, who doesn't look silly doing an at home workout no matter what it is. So I gave it a try, and I found that it's really fun, and diversifies my routine. I don't know how much of it I will use during labor because we have been blessed with twins this go around, but I wish I would have had it during my 11 hour no epidural labor with my first! Maybe it would have gone faster.",1301443200,3,463,3.9361702127659575
8403970,5,B003S21TIY,I couldn't do prenatal yoga without pain. But I had no trouble at all doing this prenatal bellydancing workout. I did use a few moves in labor and think it really helped me go through natural childbirth.,1521676800,,203,4.513513513513513
8403971,5,B003S21TIY,Good for labor prep. I usually just do the 10 minutes routine after my prenatal yoga. Easy to learn and keep up to it,1495929600,,117,3.9166666666666665
8403972,2,B003S21TIY,"The Perfect Pregnancy Workout Bellydance: (two stars)  This DVD was $25, and was by far my least favorite workout.  The moves are so simple and basic that I found it boring, and only did it a couple of times.  The workouts are both half an hour and are virtually identical, with only a few very minor changes.  Had there been a totally different workout for the ""level two"" I definitely would have given a better rating.  As it stands, I think throwing in that second workout was misleading, because it's pretty much the same thing.  The higher cost put my expectations higher, and the dvd simply did not deliver.
I used to work out regularly, but haven't since my first pregnancy (I didn't exercise at all then, because I was sick the whole pregnancy), and my daughter's birth.  We walk a lot, but that's pretty much been it (she is a little over two years old), so I am not some fitness guru or dance expert.  I only recommend this if your fitness level is zero, and you are already over six months pregnant before you decide to try a Prenatal workout.  If by the end of my pregnancy (I'm a little less than six months now) this is the only workout I can handle, I'll come back and up the rating.

Bellydance Prenatal Fitness with Naia: (four stars)  if all you are looking for is a quick thirty minute workout, this is a good pick.  The movements keep rolling along, and nothing is super complex, but there are great strengthening moves in here that will certainly help tone all the right muscles for labor and delivery.  There's not a ton of talking or any filler either; this DVD is a flat thirty minutes of focused exercising.  The segments get combined into a sort of choreographed dance, but some of the moves aren't all that ""dancey"" to me compared to other DVDs that I have.  Still, all in all I like this DVD, and choose it on days when I'm not up for a longer Prenatal workout.  It goes by quickly, and I don't get bored.
If you get impatient when you can't follow along with a workout immediately, skip this one.  She doesn't take a lot of time doing the moves super slowly.  Unless you are an experienced dancer, or have done tons of bellydancing, it will take you some practice to get parts of this workout down perfectly.  I'm still a tad clumsy at certain parts of it, but I could care less.  I keep it moving regardless of the ""quality"" of my dancing ability, and manage to enjoy myself.  Watch it once before trying it, and slow down parts that seem confusing.  You CAN get it over time.
The only thing I don't care for about this dvd is the bizarre counting.  She does an eight count, and her tone is odd and distracting.

Amira's Bellydance and Yoga for Pregnancy: (four stars)  Ok, overall Amira put together a very thoughtful and effective Prenatal workout, however, over time a few things about this DVD grated on my nerves.  Maybe it's because I am six months pregnant now?  There are little snippets about the history of bellydancing and childbirth mixed in with the workout.  While these are interesting to watch a couple of times, it then becomes a minor irritation having to skip over them every time you want to work out.  I want to stay in my workout zone without being interrupted, and I felt all the history/ trivia snippets should have been combined into one segment that was completely separate from the workout.
Another thing that bugged me is that the cool down comes after a ""Labor Exercises"" segment that cannot be done by women 32 weeks and after.  It would have made more sense to put the cool down before this part, so that women 32 weeks and on don't have more to skip over.
Apart from that, I thought the workout was very well done, and incorporated many traditional belly dance moves (hips circles, rib slides, bicycle hips, infinity circles, etc.)  The whole workout is about eighty minutes long total, but is easy to break down if you don't have that much time.

Goddess Dance Prenatal Bellydance with Sera Solstice: (five stars, in spite of a few minor issues) This is the longest Prenatal workout that I have done, but I love the thoughtful extras like the standing and seated meditation segments.  Sera Solstice is a good teacher, easy to follow, and good at breaking down the moves.  This entire workout moves at a slow and soothing pace, and teaches you two different dance combos that are then combined at the end in a nice performance dance.
There is a six minute warm up, and then the first combo is 22 minutes, and the second combo is 31 minutes.  The two combos are combined afterwards in a six minute dance segment.  If you don't have time for both segments, do the warm up with combo one on some days, and then the warm up with combo two on others.  It's a great way of breaking down the dvd into multiple workouts, and your body will thank you.
After the dance portion of the workout there is a slow standing sort of dancy meditation to help you connect with your baby and body, and following that is a seated moving meditation section.  These are very relaxing, and definitely put me in a calm place.  Both of these sections combined take about 22 minutes.  I like to save them for right before bed time to help me sleep.
In total, I think if you go through and do the whole DVD it's roughy an hour and a half.
My only small complaint is that some of the moves are done for way too long.  The repetition of certain movements got to be dull to me, and I'd get impatient for the next one to come.  Not a huge deal, just an observation.
I will definitely recommend this teacher to other women though.

Other Bellydance DVDs that aren't specifically prenatal, but I am enjoying them while pregnant:

(Note: vigorous hip shimmies and fast turns aren't recommended at 28 weeks and after.  SLOW it down, and be mindful)

Foundations of Belly Dance with Sera Solstice: I can still do most of this at six months pregnant, and I love the combinations.  I slow down the sections with shimmies (chapter five and chapter six which take up about 17 minutes total), or sometimes just do my own thing while they play.  Eighty minutes total.  This has my all time favorite warm up and moving meditation with stretches (that part alone is 30 minutes, and I'm loving it while pregnant)

Bellydance East Coast Tribal with Sera Solstice: What can I say, I'm a fan of her teaching.  I did this workout for the first time today, and had no problems with any of the movements. (Not that I can do them all well, mind you...) the Twenty minute warmup is great, and then ten minutes of drills, all totally doable during pregnancy.  Following that is a seven minute dance routine that is fairly slow paced, and I still have no issues with it even with my giant baby belly.  For some reason the entire dance segment comes before the instruction of each combo instead of after, and that's weird, but it's a good workout.  Don't worry, she DOES show you how to do all the stuff in the dance routine.

Luscious, Sensual Goddess, and Love Potion Bellydance Workout with Neon (three separate DVDs):  These may be a bit harder for some to follow, but I still consider myself a beginner, and I'm enjoying these workouts while pregnant just to keep some variety.  Love Potion is the most difficult one for me to follow, because I'm not spectacular at footwork, but I still pop it in and give it my all.  Luscious is my favorite of the three, but I enjoy the other two as well.

This has to be the longest review I have ever written, but I started bellydancing at fourteen weeks of my pregnancy, and it has been so empowering for me!!!  I'm working out four times a week (along with plenty of walking), and feel like I'm in better shape than I was right before I got pregnant.
 I highly recommend trying these DVDs for yourself!!!!!

8403973,5,B003S21TIY,"I love this dvd... I've been doing this workout once a week for about 4 months and I feel wonderful! I also do Pilates, yoga, walk and lift weights. I am now 30 weeks and don't have any typical pregnancy pains. I really feel like this workout has a lot to do with how great I feel. It tones and strengthens all of the muscles that get sore during pregnancy, which wonderfully is the same muscles that you will need in labor and recovery. Highly recommend this video if you are looking for a quick, gentle, toning workout to do during your pregnancy.",1468540800,,549,4.339805825242719

This was fun but quite short -30 minutes with warm up. based on the 1.5 hour run time thought I'd get an hour but really there is a second 30 minute session that is essentially a repeat of the first, disappointing.
