8013491,4,B0001K2LSI,"Spoof & parody of the movie ""Red Sun"" with digs at several other westerns, particularly some of the Spaghetti Westerns Eli Wallach was in. Print is not that great. Movie is just plan silly hilarity. You will need to be familiar with the westerns of the 60's & 70's to get some of the joke, but if you are it will bring you somegood laughs.",1504137600,,339,4.230769230769231
8013492,3,B0001K2LSI,the movie was kind of childish which I could overlook but the quality of the dvd was terrible,1478736000,,93,4.222222222222222
8013493,1,B0001K2LSI,"The movie isn't half bad for a spaghetti western comedy, however the idea of East meets West was much better executed in Red Sun (1972) starring Charles Bronson & Toshiro Mifune. The one star rating is for the awful DVD transfer you are getting. The source material must have been a poor quality VHS copy complete with plenty of stretch marks (visible throughout movie),which in turn used a totally worn out 16 or 35mm print as its source. If you are a die hard Eli Wallach fan, and you want to see him in a fairly hard to find movie, then by all means, buy it. To everybody else,I recommend waiting for a better quality DVD release that will do this movie justice. Better yet, give ""Red Sun"" a try.",1263427200,,699,4.384615384615385
