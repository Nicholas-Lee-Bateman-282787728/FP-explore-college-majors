8361684,1,B002BNFM8E,This was a joke. It was a standard Vinyasa type of yoga for typical yoga practitioners.  NOT for the elderly!  I was hoping for an arm chair yoga DVD for my 84 year old mother.  NO way could I give  her this DVD.  It is a total rip off!!  Don't buy this unless you just want a yoga DVD for YOURSELF not for an older person who is expecting to do yoga from a chair.,1350086400,,364,3.7866666666666666
