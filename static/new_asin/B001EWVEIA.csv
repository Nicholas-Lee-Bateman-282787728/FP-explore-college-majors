3557680,5,B001EWVEIA,"I found this DVD to be well done and very well thought through. I have watched it twice and get more out of it each time. This is not gloom and doom but actually very up lifting (if you are spiritually open) and provides explanation for the where we are now relative to 2012 and beyond. If you are a religious person who does not think in a spiritual way, this is not for you. If you have a spiritual side to your religious beliefs you will appreciate where they are coming from. If you are very much into learning about your spiritual being you will love this DVD. It takes what you have seen on the History Channel and the Discovery Channel much further. I loved it and would love to share it with others not as fact because I don't have a crystal ball, but I love having the information to assess for myself as I see the changes happening in my world, and as I try to make sense of it all.  I very mucha felt like the traveler in the series. Open your mind.",1240012800,10,960,4.1063829787234045
3557681,4,B001EWVEIA,"The only drawback for me was about a 20 minute part near the beginning of this video where there was a strong ""gloom and doom"" tone about the 2012 prophecy and the current state of the world.  Not to mention negative political statements made by one of the speakers during this 20 minute rant.

The topic of 2012 and where we are headed as a species transcends any political views and prophetic negativity that you may have.  For these reasons I only gave this film 4 stars. It just seemed a little strange for the Sacred Mysteries camp to include these types of fear based ideas in this particular film.  Honestly, it has no relevance, so I was a little disappointed in seeing it.

On the upside, there was a wonderful segment on the concept of Time. This video is a great way to bring the illusion of linear time to the masses. I think it will make alot of people think outside the proverbial box.  It was a joy seeing this topic included in the video.

Overall, 4 stars based on the majority of the content. Definitely good information here and a good addition for your holistic DVD collection.  I look forward to seeing more from the Sacred Mysteries People.",1234915200,16,1162,4.4739336492890995
3557682,5,B001EWVEIA,"I thoroughly enjoyed 2012 The Odyssey as it gave me great insight into what is happening on the planet and hope for the future. So I was really looking forward to it's sequel, Timewave 2013. With Hollywood films, rarely does a sequel measure up to the original but this one is even better than 2012 The Odyssey. With the growing intensity of the issues that are facing us, there is a precience about the film that is compelling.

Filmmaker Sharron Rose continues her journey into the mythos of 2012 and the future of humanity. Having met the Q'ero shaman/healers of Peru in the first film, she travels to the Sacred Valley of Peru to sit in a profound healing ceremony with them. This ceremony called a despacho, performed to release negativity and send out prayers, forms the though-line of the film.

As is 2012 the Odyssey, the film has many strong interviews with the experts. This time, in addition to many experts from the cast of 2012 The Odyssey, she brings in the wisdom of such writers and sages as Rianne Eisler who speaks about the partnership vs. dominator model of society and  Dr. Jean Houston, who speaks about the message of the heart and the vast potential of humankind.

While the film offers great insight into human potential and possibility, it does not shy away from the deep issues that face us. Whitley Strieber, who wrote the book upon which the film The Day After Tomorrow was based, brings great insight into the issue of global warming. Daniel Pinchbeck speaks of possible extinctions and the power of human ingenuity to overcome obstacles and create solutions.

I was also really touched by the words of Peruvian Shaman/Healer Don Umberto who had a very timely message for America. He said, "" America has great brilliance, a great head, but now that power must come down to the heart. Without the power of the heart we will not be able to think our way out of the problems."" He also said that America must take leadership in bringing peace to the world.

This is a serious and thoughtful film which takes us beyond 2012 into the nature of time and the human spirit. Highly recommended!",1228953600,75,2115,4.656836461126005
3557683,5,B001EWVEIA,"In this video, Sharron Rose quietly and confidently guides the viewer through a vast field of conjecture regarding the year 2012 and beyond. Following her heart and curiosity to Peru, Sharron enters the realm of the Incas, where cultural purity exists from pre-Columbian history to today. While there, she participates in a shamanic ceremony where small items representing the trappings of modern life are burned and the pure essence of creation is invited to bless and nurture not only the shamans performing the ritual, but all of humanity.

Interspersed throughout this ceremony are cut-away clips of interviews with a literal Who's-Who list of 2012 mystics and scholars who have spent much time pondering the end of the Mayan calendar. John Major Jenkins, Daniel Pinchbeck, Gregg Braden, Whitley Strieber are all here offering their personal observances of what may be in store for our species as we near the end of ""time as we know it.""

There is much to digest in this video. If you are wanting solely to be informed on the mechanical workings of the Mayan calendar, you will probably think this project reaches too far into the realm of mysticism and unproven conjecture. That said, if you are a person who has decided to actively pursue the topic of 2012, you will need to become much more comfortable with mysticism and unproven conjecture. We're talking about the future here, which has as many tangents of possibility as there are stars in the sky. Are you intrigued by what MIGHT be? Are you curious as to how some people interpret ancient prophecies and texts? Are you a person that believes humanity has the ability to create a positive future for ourselves and this planet? Then you will enjoy this video.

But if your mind is closed to all but that which can be proven, you will probably consider this DVD as nothing more than a fresh heaping of New-Age mumbo jumbo. I suppose the best advice I could give to anyone questing to learn more about such a controversial subject is to open both your heart and mind and see what vibrates as true for you. And I can all but gaurantee that much of the information in this video will do just that. Highly recommended.

3557685,5,B001EWVEIA,"Having enjoyed 2012 The Odyssey, I was eagerly looking forward to this sequel. What a timely film! For anyone who is concerned with the deeper spiritual and social implications of the very tangible realties confronting us such as global warming, the economic meltdown, peak oil etc, this is the film to watch. The interviews, which are juxtiposed against an ancient Shamanic ceremony held in the Sacred Valley of Peru are excellent. I was also pleased to see the continuation of the Founding Fathers theme in the section on Benjamin Franklin. I highly recommend this film for anyone who wants to gain a new perspective on the challenges confronting us at this moment in history.",1226707200,36,678,4.956140350877193

8299680,2,B001EWVEIA,"They all are here, the usual suspects - the McKennas, Villoldo playing at being Indiana Jones, Arguelles wrapped into a guru robe, a burnt-looking Pinchback plus a bunch of guys I've never heard of but who've written  books like The Intergalactic Shift etc. The DVD is a familiar jeremiad about the end of the world as we know it due to climate change and consumerism. Don't get me wrong - I too am disgusted by the nihilist avoidance of environmental facts, by short-termist corporate greed and partisan denial of climate warming that are encountered daily through media and politics.  I also resonate with the need to integrate the spiritual/esoteric element into our lives. My problem with the video is that no one said anything of substance. I've learnt nothing at all.

If there is a positive side to this vanity project it would be images of Q'ero pacos working a despacho. Beautiful faces, tough yet shrewd, calm yet watchful and alert. Don Umberto.

I guess what irritates me are the large words - the cataclysms, the galactic shifts, the secret codes, numerological salto mortales, intellectual contortions, overinterpreted ""prophecies"", pretend science and pretend anthropology/archeology. In the end much of it is simple attention seeking. These people are making a living out of other people's credulity; to stay in the limelight they have to outdo each other in outrageous claims. If someone stands out from the flakiness it would be Jean Houston, who facing 2013 did not have much to say either but exuded a solidness that I liked.

In reality, and unfortunately, things are simple. It is about work. Are we willing to work at being in our body, reclaiming who we are, or will we dis-empower ourselves by seeking through the mind. Complaining. Spreading millenarian hysteria. Perhaps the 2012 shift will be simply about spiritual consumers turning away from glamorous would-be prophets and go back to the basics of inner travail.",1326499200,6,1943,5.040498442367602

8299682,2,B001EWVEIA,"I was ready to turn it off half way through this video. It lacked any real information that pertained to the title. It featured all to much on the peruvian shamans but really didn't address any concrete events, happenings, etc

8299683,4,B001EWVEIA,"2012 ""the Odyssey was good, this was much better, well balanced viewpoints, which can allow each individual to make up his/her own mind: Doomsday?? -- Transformation?? -- Or a combination thereof??  anything is possible
Can't really add much to what has been said already, but 2013 is worth watching.",1266192000,,300,5.122448979591836
8299684,3,B001EWVEIA,"This is a much better video than 2012 Odyssey which can be considered part 1 of this 2 part series.  In large part this video succeeds because it focuses more on the indigenuous people, the Quero, who hold the prophecies instead of the 'guessers' as I will call them who make up most of the other voices in both videos.

You end up with a fairly balanced and interesting take of the 2012 phenomena from the big names in the game.  You have Whitley Strieber with his usual total gloom and doom.  Jay Weidner also in the cataclysmic camp claiming he decoded Fulcanelli and that Cusco is the only safe haven.  The film balanced this out by orienting us to the real Cuzco within.  You also have Mr burning man Pinchbeck who needs a hairstylist badly.  William Henry was there off to the left of camera in bad contrast lighting with his serpent rope wormhole theme that he got from John Major Jenkins (JMJ).  JMJ was also there and contributed some of the most useful non-indigeous information (as always).  The most level-headed Westerners were Dennis McKenna and Jean Houston.

Joe (aka Jose) Arugelles, who really corrupted the 2012 meme with his own 'Mayan' calendar called 'Dreamspell' was included. I would have thought that most 2012 researchers by now would have already known to stay away from his and wifes work if you want anything genuinely Mayan.  From Joe and others there was a good bit of 'linear time' bashing.  But the problem with this is that it is self-defeating.  That argument remains stuck in the same cause and effect that linear time represents.

Alberto Villoldo was the translator for the Quero and had many good points of his own to share.  The obvious errors in the documentary were kept to a minimum.  But I can't overlook the incorrect comments equating the Quero offering or 'despatcho' as being primarily or even largely about getting rid of negative energy.  Perhaps some paqos look at it this way.  But, speaking from my own direct experience working with Quero and other paqos of various traditions, the majority of them see a despatcho as an offering and blessing of positive energy and prayers to Pachamama (mother earth).  The compiler and producer of the video should have been more careful in this respect and had another source/translator for the Quero.

Spread out in the beginning and end of the video are voice overs by Terence McKenna.  If you are trying to get a wide-ranging overview of the metaphysical factors around 2012 you really need to listen to Terence's lectures.  You can find these as mp3s by poking around the Internet.

Still, if you are looking for a good overview to 2012 this is one video worth your time.  And I would definately skip the first one due to it's many flaws.",1254182400,19,2732,4.703157894736842
8299685,5,B001EWVEIA,"I thought the original DVD about 2012 was great but this sequel far surpasses it.  Get ready for The Great Shift.  It's already here.  Move into your heart where the new frequencies lie.  The old paradigm is not supported by these new energies and is dying a natural death.  We see this as conflict and upheaval everywhere.  Predicted for thousands of years by many world cultures, these times are pivotal in our evolution of consciousness with concurrent changes in our earth and our universe.  Synchronicity.  We are all participants and witnesses to these changes, but we have a choice whether or not we will help usher in the new millenium with Love and Joy, or resist it's coming and continue to live from fear and negativity supporting a dying Age.  We can minimize the suffering ahead or enhance it.",1251763200,6,806,4.741007194244604
8299686,4,B001EWVEIA,"I really liked the ceremonial aspects of this DVD.  The movie begins with ""blurbs"" by all manner of New Age thinkers, though, and many of them were very negative in their viewpoint.  If I watch it again, I will skip that part completely as it tended to buy into the ""2012--Fearful Changes Coming"" mindset.  We don't need any more fear!  The ceremonial part of the movie felt very peaceful and non-judgmental.  Just giving information is a powerful tool in transformation.",1251763200,5,471,4.8375
