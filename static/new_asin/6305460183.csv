The problem is that he is not fertile and an awful  husband.  She soon falls for a man who shows love for her and the plot  thickens. The movie kept me guessing what will happen next.

1047052,5,6305460183,This is one of my favorite films. I am a teacher of film and I use this as a final film. This is great direction. This is great writing. This is great acting. This is a life changing movie. It is what movies can be when everyone is gifted at working at his and her peak. Li Gong has never been better. Technicolor has never been used better.

1047053,4,6305460183,"Upon watching this film I've come to discover the cinematic views pushed forward by the director, one that is politically as it is beautifully conveyed. It deals with idealism, skepticism and defiance. Zhang Yimou's bleak past comes across in his perception of modern Chinese life. The dire need to subject a female protagonist in simple Chinese life breaks the generalization that women are secondary in the culture itself.  After awhile we tend to question the films conceptual meaning, behind the closed walls of the governance to the societal values that bridge the struggles of a simple girl, what is her social placement?

The metaphor's that is expressed through situations and colors brings profundity to the plot. The Chinese culture has been oppressed for centuries since The Qin Dynasty to the Tang Dynasty to the Ming Dynasty and they have been fighting a losing battle. The confinement of old values lunges at our very own cultural beliefs. We would make the direct mistake of saying that Ju Dou is a story about the tragedy of love; instead it deals with oppression and the blatant patriarchal society that lives to deliver narrow ancestral values that subdues the fundamentals of equality.

Comprised of detailed composition and intricate framing Ju Dou is best known for its cinematography an area in which director Zhang Yimou is extremely familiar with. But upon discovering the aesthetically beautiful set, I've come to learn that the contrast of lighting and color sets the pace and feel of the film, triggering emotions and senses that is relatively done on purpose. The manipulation of the settings makes way with the delicate introduction of the costumes and braided colors that intertwine and flow within the context of the plot.

Ju Dou defines her self significantly at first as the beautiful bride packaged with purity and innocence, but later poses up as an authoritarian and pushed as far as being a mere mistress, the dual complex characters bridge themselves together with lust, affection and fear not to mention the patriarchal oppression. Yang Jinshan the old cruel miser with an inferiority complex makes an approach that immediately sets his character apart from the others. Comparatively suggesting a ruthless and stronger role, he is dressed with a higher set of clothing than his counterpart signifying authority and money. Yang Tianqing the lower class servant boy displays a forward yet subtle rebellious influence of the social culture; he in many senses signifies metaphorical character of Zhang Yimou himself, dressed down with plain colors Yang Tianqing expresses deviancy as a character by having a lucid affair with Ju Dou.

I've decidedly picked several scenes that best make exemplary of the metaphors and compositions of the film, do notice of the vivid scenery that's seemingly juxtaposed with cross cultural interpretation of the oppressed culture.

As a point of information the film Ju Dou was adapted from the novel Fuxi, Fuxi, ""In an ancient Chinese myth, Fuxi and Nwa were blood brother and sister but married in order to produce offsprings for the sake of the continuation of humankind"". A rich form of narrative feature only sources out to implicate the cross-cultural evolution that is functionally oppressed. Zhang Yimou ingeniously employs the deeper symbols, he emphasizes on primitive forms of art and literature, which brings depth to the function of his piece.

Watch as the sexual prohibition and desires only end in death, the complexity of the 3 characters bounces off the old values that places women on a secondary platform. The symbols that matches with the situation, for example we were first introduced to white cloth and slowly progresses to multi colored situations later on. The purity of the white experiences innocence, harmony, light, happiness, eroticism and only ends in deaths.

The feature never fails to sustain social grounding; it also suggests that the male dominated society is slowly changing by the inclusion of impotency in an authoritative figure. The film stretches out to address that the fertility of women not only stop there but also rather carries the burden of men as their hope, dreams and future solely lie on the shoulders of women. Death is only the beginning. I hope you enjoy this ambitious film as much as i did.",1370476800,2,4319,5.125
1047054,5,6305460183,I really enjoy Gong Li movies as I think she is a good actress and she tends to be in movies that are a good story and that give insight into some aspect of life in China.  This is a recommendable film for Gong Li fans in my opinion.,1358812800,,233,3.7551020408163267

1047058,3,6305460183,"A bleak and disquieting exploration of the spirit stripping effects of sustained oppression from which there is no escape.  This is a film about the dessertification of soul.

1047059,5,6305460183,"What Gong Li does in `Ju Dou' is beyond astonishing.  In perhaps her finest performance to date (and that is saying a lot for such a brilliant actress), Li delivers a breathtaking, albeit heartbreaking, look at an abused woman scorned by her confinement to a man she cannot love, desperately separated (at least in a complete sense) from the man who can offer her salvation.

`Ju Dou' tells the story of Ju Dou, a young woman sold into marriage to the elderly owner of a dye mill.  Her husband is a ruthless and brutal man; unable to produce offspring and obviously violently bitter over it.  He regards Ju Dou with little respect and humiliates her emotionally, mentally and physically.  Ju Dou seeks solace and affection in her husband's nephew; a gentle young man who works in the dye mill.  As a way to escape her lot in life, albeit only partially, Ju Dou falls in love with this young man.  It is their love and impregnation that leads to complications and eventual tragedy within Ju Dou's life; as if her life wasn't already tragic.

As a film, `Ju Dou' is straight pain.  There is no light at the end of the tunnel here, but solely emotional devastation.  Even when things appear `brighter' for Ju Dou in her relationship with young Tianqing, it is obvious that things will never be good for her as a whole.  She will only have fleeting moments of seeming happiness; but the words `fleeting' and `seeming' continually take over that narrative.  Some may object to such harsh depictions, but I consider it a strong testament to the director's vision and creative control.  What is even grander is the fact that all three main actors (Gong Li, Li Baotian and Li Wei) underscore their every moment with a complete understanding of their characters eventualities.  They all feel complete and in control of their moments.  Li Wei is effectively evil; delving into the heart of this monster and delivering a terrifying performance.  Boatian broods effectively and fleshes out the pent up frustrations of loving a woman tied to a monster.  But it is Gong Li who steals every ounce of this film.  She is so achingly realistic; so honest and dripping with internal torment.  Just watching her face recoil as she takes in her surroundings.  She delivers such a deeply assertive performance, one that allows her to soak in the atmosphere of the film and project it through her burdened eyes.

And what atmosphere there is!  From the colorful set pieces (one only wishes the DVD transfer did it complete justice) to the constrictive yet fluid cinematography, `Ju Dou' is as visually arresting as it is emotionally.

Some have balked at the DVD transfer, and as far as that is concerned I must agree, to a degree.  I didn't find it overly offensive (I have seen worse) but I was expecting much better.  Still, the film itself transcends any issues with the DVD itself (although this is one of the many films that deserves top notch DVD treatment and will never receive it because it is not popular enough) and so I highly recommend you see this film any way that you can!",1314835200,5,3066,4.685981308411215
1047060,5,6305460183,"Ju-Dou is an excellent movie that reveals much about Chinese culture through a love story between Ju-dou and her owner's cousin. Beautifully shot with scenes of the Chinese landscape and the fabric dye business that is owned by Ju-Dou's owner. We get a glimpse into how fabrics are dyed in these deep vats filled with rich colorful dyes. the acting is tremendous particularly from the son of Ju-Dou and her cousin, who is believed to be the son of the owner by the villagers. Not known until Ju-Dou reveals it, is that he is impotent and takes out his inadequecies on Ju-Dou with cruel treatment. this is where the cousin who hears the commotion from his bedroom steps in to rescue Ju-Dou and the two fall in love and produce a son.

1047073,1,6305460183,"I guess I can't blame Amazon.com for claiming this DVD (the MagicPlay release - UPC 690445022424) has an aspect ratio of 2.35:1 because that is what it says on the back cover (MagicPlay didn't even get the syntax right, they printed it as ""2:35-1"").  While I'm sure they would claim it is a typographical error, as it stands it is false advertising perpetrated by MagicPlay Entertainment, because this DVD is actually ""pan and scan"" 4:3 aspect ratio. Razor Digital Entertainment also takes credit for this release but since MagicPlay takes the copyright credit for the cover design, I place the blame on them for this fraud.  I'm not sure, but it wouldn't surprise me if there is no actual panning of the image.  I think they just cropped it right up the center and left it at that.  The Internet Movie Database states that the aspect ratio for this film is 1.66:1 (5:3), so 2.35:1 would not be correct even if it had been transferred as widescreen letterbox.  And to add salt to the wound they obviously started with a very poor quality print from which to make the digital transfer.  There is also a problem with the audio.  My first point here is that I experienced about a 24dB difference in volume between the main feature soundtrack and the audio loop that accompanies the main menu screen; specifically it is the menu screen audio that is too loud.  So if you set the volume based on the film's audio track, remember to quickly mute or turn it down when the film ends or you will get blasted out of your seat when the menu returns.  The second point is that it appears the audio is only basic stereo, which may in fact be how the film was made, but again we have misleading information on the DVD case cover, because it says ""Dolby Digital 5.1"" but based on the behavior of my receiver, there was no ""5.1"" even if there is some aspect of ""Dolby Digital"" to the audio.  The Setup menu gives you a choice of ""AC3-2.0"" (Dolby Digital 2-channel) or ""LPCM"" (while LPCM can theoretically support up to 7.1 channels, here it sounded nearly the same as the AC3-2.0).  One final discrepancy which I'll mention is that the cover of my DVD appears to imply it is a ""Region Zero"" disc, while Amazon.com lists it as ""Region 1"" but I have no way of knowing which is correct.  My rating for this product is based strictly on the quality of the MagicPlay DVD, not the movie, which I would rate very high.",1236988800,8,2395,4.480459770114942

From my understanding one of the highlights of Ju Dou was the dramatic colors used both literally and symbolically. Unfortunately this does not come through in the Razor release. In this edition the colors are faded and washed out. The transfer is poor. It looks like a copy of an inferior PAL tranfer from VHS.

The film moves with the spirit of Greek tragedy. The downfall of the Yang family is told through the story of an illicit affair between the wife of silk dyer Jin Shan Yang, played beautifully by Gong Li and Tianquing (Baotian Li), the dyer's nephew. The affair brings about tragic consequences leading to thedownfall of the Yang business,

Although difficult to tell from this mucky transfer, the original cinemaphotography was clearly outstanding. Very claustrophobic in scope and character, the images still manage to glow at times. There are also some truly bleak characters- most notably the mute, implacable sociopathic son. Scary and memorable.

This film clearly deserves better than this pathetic, murky, gritty, 4:3 transfer it receives here. A real shame- when are Zhang's films going to get the treatment they deserve?

Worse than the old VHS recording I saw 7 years ago.  So bad, that it's gotten someone like me, one who never writes reviews, to comment on it.  This DVD should not be sold in the United States, or anywhere.  Unfortunately, I picked this DVD up on a whim before reading any reviews.

I'd suggest you just cherish your memories of this wonderful film until a better transfer is made available.  It was good to be reminded of the story, but very sad to see how carelessly Razor Digital Entertainment handled this transfer.

It really baffles me how terrible this transfer is.  A few moments here and there the picture actually looks acceptable, but then the rest of the time it's blurry, washed out, monochromatic yellows and browns, lines and dust marks everywhere, and occasional digital glitches.  This dvd has probably any bad transfer cliche you can imagine; more than I've seen anyway.

I am basing this review on a VHS copy I saw rather than the atrocious DVD version (enough reviewers have already pointed out how bad THAT is). The VHS copy I saw had no mechanical flaws in it whatsoever.

This Chinese movie reminded me a great deal of THE POSTMAN ALWAYS RINGS TWICE, set on a medieval silk farm. The owner of the silk cloth business (played by Li Wei) is married to a young girl, Ju Dou (Gong Li), whom he abuses. His young nephew (Li Baotian) works for him, and he and Ju Dou fall in love. They carry on a passionate affair until she becomes pregnant. They deceive Wei by making him think the child is his. They think of killing Wei, but can't go through with it. Then one day Wei has an accident and is paralyzed from the waist down (Baotian could have left him to die, but saves him). The two lovers now openly flaunt their relationship in front of Wei. When the child, a boy, is born, Wei, to save face, accepts him as his own son. But years later the boy learns the truth about who his real father is, and the results are disastrous for the two lovers. The spare and stark story line is interesting, with many unexpected twists and turns to it. The depictions of the medieval cloth dyeing trade are also fascinating to see. Well worth a watch (on VHS).",1140912000,7,1325,4.21259842519685

1047129,1,6305460183,"Well, you can forgive me but I never liked Greek tragedy. Some guy who is a perfect individual indulges themselves one time, and they have their downfall. It's so moralistic it makes me sick.  The only one I enjoyed was Oedipus, a this was because it was so perverse it was amusing.

Yes, it is like a Greek tragedy, but this isn't necessarily a good thing. The film creates a perverse situation from the start, an uncle beats his wives to death because they don't produce babies, which is really a result of him being sterile. So the nephew sleeps with her instead, and they use heavy color symbolism to represent a taint or evil deed. Actually, I think this is a rare condition where as long as it is a one time shot, I think it could be let slide as a neutral or even good act.  Instead, the movie hammers over and over again, that these people are going to get what's coming to them. Instead, this can be construed as the son being loving to the aunt to protect her from sharing the fate of the others, and acting with honor to keep the family line going.

So, first the woman becomes sterile, then the nephew is ridiculed that maybe the uncle can buy a wife for him as good, and meanwhile the son is a bad seed who drowns the uncle without remorse and then tries to shatter the rest of the family. The movie hints that maybe this is a bit unjust, but proceeds to torture you anyway. At this point, I shut it off, and went after a girl (or two) I like. Catharsis doesn't work in tragedy, as in order for it to work, the villain must receive appropriate punishment (and no more than that) and then be returned to at least partial happiness, or at least learning to cope with unhappiness. A better situation would be the father dying, and the two being banished, but they live peacefully out in the countryside somewhere, preferably without the evil kid, maybe because the town seized it from them. But the producer, couldn't bring themselves to do this.",1107734400,6,1956,4.380165289256198
1047160,3,6305460183,"The 1990 Chinese film Ju Dou is a cinematic celebration of the senses.  It is a delight to the eye and the ear, and a weak story line is saved by the aesthetic artistry of the film's cinematography.  Set in rural China in the 1920's, Ju Dou works as a system of recurrent images that take on greater significance as the film progresses.  As the story opens on a long, deadpan shot of the sleeping town at dawn, with its mute white faces stacked one upon the other, the viewer has little awareness of how this same image at the end of the film will come to embody the cruelty and imprisonment of the rigid Chinese traditions to which the town abides.
 The story focuses on Tianqing and Ju Dou, two victims of the dominance Master Yan.  In the closed universe of his dye mill, Master Yan bullies his orphan nephew Tianqing with a constant barrage of insults, and tortures his purchased wife Ju Dou in hopes of producing from her a male heir.  Brought together by their mutual suffering, Tianqing and Ju Dou begin an illicit love affair that culminates in the birth of Tianbai, though Master Yan, the town, and even Tianbai go on believing that Master Yan is the father.  When Master Yan suffers a paralyzing injury, Ju Dou and Tianqing become free to love each other, though Master Yan continues even in his crippled state to fight against the couple's love and wins the affection of his ""son"" Tianbai, who in time takes on the menacing nature and reverence for tradition found in Master Yan.  After the accidental death of Master Yan, the story concludes with Ju Dou and Tianqing's unsuccessful attempts to keep their love hidden from the town, before their final self-destruction.
  The story, however, essentially serves only as a vehicle for the sensual feeling of the film.  One never sympathizes with the couple's love, which seems pathetic, and the mute Tianbai possesses no real character.  The grace of the film comes from its symbols and setting.  Over and over, we see the cloth of the dye mill cascading through the air in slow motion as the sunlight streams down with it.  This is beauty, and whenever something goes wrong, the cloth falls to the ground, and the final image of the film shows the cloths and the strikingly beautiful Ju Dou being consumed in flames.
This interplay of dark and light provides much of the story's dramatic effect.  To consummate their love, Ju Dou and Tianqing are forced into the darkness of the mill's cellar, and when the town council discusses their suspicions of Ju Dou and Tianqing's infidelity to Master Yan, they stand in a frozen darkness that appears as a silhouette it is so lifeless.  Similarly, it is only at night, creeping through the shadows of the dye mill, that Tianqing dares to come to the aid of the tortured Ju Dou.
Almost all of the film's plotlines depend upon such symbolic actions. (...)  Tianbai drowns Tianqing at the end of the film in the same pool of red dye in which he watched Master Yan die.  Ju Dou must poison her sexual organs to keep from having another child.  While all these things happen physically, their symbolic implications for the film provide their significance.
The central concern for each of these symbols is how they comment on the idea of tradition that forces love into hiding.  The ancient honor of heredity and the continuance of a family name enable Master Yan to practice his vicious cruelty and come to their full fruition in the inhuman gaze and presence of Tianbai.  Tradition too makes Ju Dou a [prostitute] and Tianqing a forty-year-old child, and leaves death as the only means of escape for the unhappy lovers.
While the story and the message of Ju Dou failed to win me over, the film itself is beautiful, and the haunting sounds of children singing a nursery song juxtaposed on the face of Ju Dou in flames sends a shiver down your spine as the film comes to a close.  Fortunately, the film is so replete with such moments that it overcomes an alienating story, and in the end Ju Dou works as a lovely and a touching film.",1092009600,8,4030,4.606993006993007

1047164,5,6305460183,"The title character, a peasant sold as a concubine to a cruel old man, is played by the beautiful Gong Li, one of the great actresses of our time who followed this brilliant work with spectacular performances in The Story of Qiu Ju (1991), Raise the Red Lantern (1992), and Farewell, My Concubine (1993).  Li Wei plays her master, Yang Jin-shan, the childless owner of a dye mill in the agrarian China of the 1920s.  Li Wei's fine performance combines craftiness with iniquity reminding me a little of the late great John Huston with scruffy beard.  The third character in the tragic triangle is Jin-shan's nephew, Yang Tianqing, a modest man who does most of the work in the dye mill.  The pent-up intensity of Li Baotian, who plays Tianqing, recalled to me at times the work of Ben Kingsley.  Ju Dou falls in love with Tianqing almost by default, and it is their ill-fated love that leads to tragedy.

In some ways this visually stunning, psychologically brutal film about paternity and the old social order of China was Director Zhang Yimou's ""practice"" for the making two years later of his masterpiece, the afore mentioned, Raise the Red Lantern, one the greatest films ever made.  The theme of patriarchal privilege is similar, and in both films Gong Li portrays a young concubine required to bear a son and heir to a cruel and ageing man of means.  Even though the setting in both films is China in the twenties before the rise of Communism, both films very much annoyed the ageing leadership of Communist China and were censured (Ju Dou was actually banned), ostensibly for moral reasons, but more obviously because of the way they depicted elderly men in positions of power.

Ju Dou is the lesser film only in the sense that Sirius might outshine the sun were the two stars placed side by side.  Both films are masterpieces, but for me Ju Dou was difficult to watch because of the overt cruelty of the master, whereas in Raise the Red Lantern, Yimou chose to keep the more brutal aspects of the story off camera.  In a sense, then, Raise the Red Lantern is the more subtle film.  It is also a film of greater scope involving more characters, infused with an underlining sense of something close to black humor.  (The very lighting of the lanterns was slyly amusing as it ironically pointed to the subjugation.)

In Ju Dou there is virtually no humor and the emphasis is on the physical brutality of life under the patriarchal social order.  Ju Dou is beaten and tortured while we learn that Jin-shan tortured his previous wives to death because of their failure to bear him an heir.  The terrible irony is that it is Jin-shan who is sterile.  He feels shamed in the eyes of his ancestors because the Wang line will die out with him.  But a child is finally born through Ju Dou's illicit affair with Tianqing.  (Note that this conjoining in effect saves Ju Dou's life.)  Jin-shan thinks the infant is his son and briefly all is serenity.  However, while two may live happily ever after, three will not.  Notice too that now that Jin-shan has an heir, nephew Tianqing will inherit nothing.

Will they kill Jin-shan?  Will fortuitous events put him out of the picture?  Will they find happiness?  Will the boy learn the truth about his paternity?  Yimou's artistry does not allow superficial resolution, you can be sure.

Note the two significant turns the film takes early on.  One comes after Ju Dou discovers that Tianqing has been spying on her through a peep hole as she goes about her bath.  At first she is mortified, and then sees this as a chance to show him the scars from the torture she endures daily, and then she shows him her body to allure him.  The other turn comes as the child pronounces his first words by calling the old man ""Daddy.""  Instantly Jin-shan, now confined to a wooden bucket that serves as a wheelchair, divines a deep psychological plan to realize his revenge.  He embraces the child as his own, hoping to turn the boy against the illicit couple.

The strength of the film is in the fine acting, the beautiful sets, the gorgeous camera work, and in the unsentimental story that does not compromise or cater to saccharin or simplistic expectations.  Yimou is a visual master who turns the wood gear- and donkey-driven dye mill of the 1920s  into a tapestry of brilliant color and texture.  Notable is the fine work that he does with the two boys who play the son at different ages.  He has them remain virtually mute throughout and almost autistically cold.  Indeed part of the power of this film comes from the depiction of the character of the son who grows up to hate who he is and acts out his hatred in murderous violence toward those around him.

Zhang Yimou is one of the few directors who can bring simultaneously to the silver screen the power of an epic and the subtlety of a character study.  His films are more beautiful than the most lavish Hollywood productions and as artistically satisfying as the best in world cinema.  The only weakness in the film is perhaps the ending which is played like a Greek tragedy for cathartic effect.  One senses that Yimou and co-director Yang Fengliang in choosing the terminus were not entirely sure how this tale should end and took what might be seen as an easy way out.

1047165,3,6305460183,"This movie is dark, so dark it is unbelievable.  It seems everything and everyone, including the family, townspeople, even the son, would rather see the couple dead than happy.  And not just happy together - even to have some peace or solace is absolutely unacceptable.  The acting is superb, but the story overdoes it with the purely evil antagonists, the overwhelming unhappiness, and overpowering destruction of all hope.

1047166,5,6305460183,"I would hesitate to qualify ""Ju Dou"" as erotic in the traditional Western sense of the word, but that may just be because the tragedy of this tale overwhelms the sensuality.  The title character, played by Gong Li, is married off to the brutal owner of a dye mill in rural China in the 1920's who treats his wife as badly as he treats his nephew.  In their misery the pair turn to each other and when Ju Dou is pregnant and bears a son, they have to pretend the boy is her husband's.  However, their hidden love is just a tragedy waiting to happen and even the death of the old man does not provide any real happiness.  ""Ju Dou"" is essentially a horror film, whose middle act happens to be a romance.  But the way the uncle treats his nephew and how the nephew and Ju Dou pay for their love, will stand out in your memory more than the supposedly erotic middle section.
I am not sure I am willing to call ""Ju Dou"" director Yimou Zhang's best film (co-directed by Yang Fengliang), but like all of his films it is fascinating to watch.  It does make the best use of the Technicolor equipment China bought from the U.S., especially as they work on dying all that fabric.  The bright colors are truly spectacular.  Although ""Ju Dou"" was the first Chinese film to be nominated for the Best Foreign Film Oscar, it was banned in China by the government.  The assumption is because since the film is about an impotent old man ruining the lives of those under him the people would see it as a metaphor for a nation ruled by a bunch of old men.  This is one of those take it or leave it levels of symbolism since the film is obviously not didactic.",990835200,12,1638,4.254838709677419

1047169,4,6305460183,"Just to contradict the reviewer who reports 'terrible DVD version'. While the 'extras' are thin on the ground, the picture and sound quality are pretty good in this intensely visual drama. The dark scenes show real  blacks and the bright colours of the dyed cloths and illuminated faces  register well. Perhaps the reviewer cited is concerned with lack of bright  key lights on faces, and a distinctly arthouse feel to the cinematography  (i.e. big murky interiors, with sharp silhouettes, contrasting with flaring  stabbing bright exterior light. Sounds like natural...).
Director Zhang  Yimou started as a cinematographer (on Chen Kaige's ""Yellow  Earth"", ""Big Parade"" etc.) so he should know what he is  doing. China, incidentally, retained their Three-Strip Technicolour film  processing technology under wraps through the Cultural Revolution, so when  the Fifth Generation filmmakers came onto the the scene, they were big on  reds, yellows, blues, etc., a vibrancy of image that hadn't been seen in  Western filmmaking since the 1940's & 50's.

Wealth, prestige, beauty, strength, youth all abound in the big house of the cloth dyer, but no one is happy. And it is unhappiness of their own making. The bad old man has his evident faults, he seems to attract hate like a magnet. The young couple is brave and fight for their rights, at least as we can tell with XXI century eyes. But they also err in taking on a battle against their world (feudal rural China) and impossible odds.

Even the little boy who is born out of wedlock in this cruel environment becomes evil very soon in his life, and after his ""official"" father drowns in a pool of color dye he can only smile and seems bent on perpetuating his heartless character. He viciously kills his biological father when he realizes they are all the object of gossip in the village.

The final fire that consumes the dye factory is perhaps the only satisfying scene of the film, and I read it as a depiction of the last vestiges of feudalism in China crumbling down with the onslaught of modernity. Very good photography in this film. It is paradoxical that the long rolls of cloth of the dye factory give so much color to a very sad and dark story. The DVD is technically poor, seems a bad digitalization from a film roll, for this I take out one star.
