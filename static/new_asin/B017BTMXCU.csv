7498458,5,B017BTMXCU,This movie is absolutely wonderful! A wonderful movie for teen girls and young women...very encouraging. Teaches the value of setting your standards high and sticking to them...very appropriate and uplifting. It is a must see!! Soo happy this movie was produced as it has really blessed my heart.,1447977600,12,296,5.1875
7498459,1,B017BTMXCU,"This is surreally bad to  offensive to woman. I was almost shock you can watch a film like this in 2018. Submissive women that are not allow to make desicion, explore her sexuality, give their opinion without the authorization of a male figure.
This film is just a nightmare for women empowerment. Religious film or not.",1535500800,,320,4.714285714285714
7498460,5,B017BTMXCU,This is a great movie and a great example of what our standards should be as a Christian. I felt that the guy she met in the coffee shop was just a carbon copy of a guy I dated in 1997. And I felt the EXACT same uncomfortableness with him. I was constantly convicted about how touchy feely he always wanted to be and I would weep for days at how shamed he made me feel and how much he did not value me. I wish I had seen this movie back then and realized that I deserved God's best - not just some guy that wanted to put his hands all over me. The guy who honors her parents and God and treats her with respect in this movie is every woman like me's dream come true. And I think it is definitely worth waiting on God to bring a man like this. Great movie.,1535414400,,755,3.8461538461538463
7498461,1,B017BTMXCU,"So, I'm not Christian and had no idea this was a christian movie. Just wanted a silly rom-com to put on the TV, but instead just got pissed off. I can enjoy a good Christian movie, but if you shove your paternalistic crap down my throat and tell me a young woman can't make any good choices on her own I'm going to get upset.

Sorry, turned into a bit of a rant, here's the tl;dr. Don't watch this movie if you think women should be able to date without parental consent or if you're not a devout, bible-literalist Christian. Otherwise it'll just piss you off.

Full Review:
Well, I got about half way through before I had to turn it off in disgust. The beginning made no sense - the main character goes on a date with her boyfriend, but all his college buddies are there and he announces his engagement to another girl. From I thought this would be a story about how the main character is so obsessed with marriage that she manufactures relationships that aren't really there and builds up stories and romances and the movie would be about her self-realization story. Oh no, that's not it at all.

Instead she finds this really sweet guy - funny, respectful, decent human. But *le gasp* he wants to kiss her! His own girlfriend! How horrifying! And Grace has been so brainwashed by her religion/parents that the idea of even kissing someone who she's not engaged (married?) to is causing her anxiety and depression. She can't tell her parents because they wouldn't support it. I mean, no wonder the guy from the first scene that she went on a ""date"" with didn't have a problem introducing his fiance to her! Clearly he didn't think they were dating if all they did was hang out together as friends without any physical interactions! He was probably just trying to tell all of his friends together and considered her a good friend!

Also, every guy who comes by has to ask her father for permission to date her and take her out. He has the right to disapprove and if she tries to date the guy anyway she's stupid and he's a scumbag who's going to break her heart or ignore her clearly stated desires.

Also, the therapist scene. Grace goes to a therapist because she's feeling conflicted about kissing her boyfriend. This woman would never have gotten a license in the real world. She basically listens to Grace explain how she's upset that her boyfriend wants to kiss her (again, wtf is so weird about this?!) and her advice is ""well, just move in with him."" Like, no lady, shut up, you're a hack. Talk this over with the girl, get more details - for example how long have they been dating? Because that certainly didn't seem to come up. And the exact details of how they were getting physical - like is he trying to have sex with her? Or just a peck on the lips? Why is she so uncomfortable? Delve into the brainwashing of her religion. This scene is where I was basically done with the movie. Watched another 10-15 minutes and there is so much more crap that happens there, but I need to end this review somewhere. If you don't think any of this matters, go ahead and watch this movie. But do not share it with any young girls because it can actually harm them by showing they have no autonomy and should feel ashamed for having a sexuality.

Sorry for the rant, this movie made me angry and I wanted to warn others.",1535414400,3,3319,4.432786885245902

7498469,3,B017BTMXCU,"Honestly, I felt like it was a movie that tried too hard to be a Christian movie. Some of the lines were just too forced or too cliche. Now, I approve of the message they were going for, but my teen daughter and I had to laugh a few times because some lines were just too unrealistic....People don't actually talk like that. There was also a lack of chemistry between the two main characters.

While I agree, in general, with the message, I think having the main character sit and read Christian self help books on dating was cringey. Spend time in the Word. Talk to your parents and other loved ones about marriage and what to look for in a possible husband. Actually, get out and help people...get your mind off of the marriage goal..and off of you. Heal from your past relationships. Unlike other reviewers, I didn't have a problem with her age. I honestly think getting married young is preferred.

To sum up, I felt the idea was good, it just needed to go through a few more edits. As is, lets just say Im glad it was free.",1534636800,,1028,4.348958333333333

7498519,5,B017BTMXCU,"I have watched this movie 3 times now because it is such a rare gem even among Christian movies.  My wife and I love it and my daughters ages 8 years, 5 years and younger love it.  The Scriptural picture of a family is exemplified.  The husband is the ""head of his household""  guiding it well while loving and caring and providing for his family.

The problem with our society today is that there are not enough Christian families such as the one illustrated in this very excellent movie.

A word to the critics:  I have read all the one star ratings and it's really easy to sense the reason for your disdain.  Anyone with the slightest hint of spiritual discernment can perceive the feminist mindsets and liberal undertones of these babblers.  Relax and read I Timothy with particular attention to chapter 3 and verses 4,5 (KJV).  If you don't like the Apostle Paul's advice to Timothy and the church, perhaps you will prefer Peter's views:  I Peter 3:1 Likewise, ye wives, be in subjection to your own husbands; that, if any obey not the word, they also may without the word be won by the conversation of the wives; I Peter 3:5 For after this manner in the old time the holy women also, who trusted in God, adorned themselves, being in subjection unto their own husbands:
Whether you like it or not, God's formula is the husband in subjection to Jesus Christ and the wife in subjection to the husband and the children in subjection to their parents.  A Godly wife is a precious jewel to be treasured and treated with love and respect and children are the blessing of the Lord to be raised up in the nurture and admonition of the Spirit.  However when a difficult decision must be faced and the spouses disagree the husband must make the best Scriptural decision he can and stick by it.  The only other choice is anarchy and ""rebellion is as the sin of witchcraft and stubbornness is iniquity and idolatry..."" (I Samuel 15:23) Beware critics lest you fall into the snare that Saul did ..."" Because thou hast rejected the word of the LORD, he hath also rejected thee from being king."" (or from whatever positions you hold including head of household or wife).

NOTE please that a man who does not provide for his family to the best of his God given ability has denied the faith and is worse than an infidel.

For those who love God and God's book and the Christian walk I suggest to you that you will love this movie.  Christian movies don't get any better than this.  Definitely highly recommended.",1516320000,,2499,4.527839643652562

Such ignorance is the root cause of the 57% of all felonious enslavements under the euphemism ""marriage"" which are nothing but felony theft divorce racketeering setups.  The notion that paying a 1000% markup for a chunk of compressed carbonaceous material in a ""princess cut"" is consistent with felony religion's insistence that the sole purpose of male citizens is to be tortured maimed and murdered including the ""sacrifice"" of male lives in foreign wars created for the purpose.

7498550,1,B017BTMXCU,"As a Christian woman, films like this one are especially upsetting to me because THEY ARE THE REASON THE CHRISTIAN FILM GENRE HAS SUCH A BAD RAP. So disappointing. B-rate acting, c-rate writing. This film is everything that is wrong with the Christian film genre. A few take-a-ways from this little gem:

Therapists are bad. Very bad. And ridiculous, too. And dangerous.

If you date a non-Christian, or you foolishly try to date someone using your own judgment and not your parents'...you will end up with someone who is selfish and conniving at best, or a psycho at worst.

Young Christian women should be obsessed with marriage, and there's no need for them to have any other dreams or aspirations in life.

Young Christian women aren't capable of exercising good judgement on their own, they MUST seek their parent's approval. When Grace tries to ""go it on her own"", just look at the mess she gets herself in to? It's not that she was overly-sheltered and ill-equipped for adult life and that's why she made poor decisions, no...she just did it all wrong. She should have never tried to make her own decisions! Why raise children who can exercise good judgment? Rather, teach them that they can't/shouldn't do anything without checking with you first, even into adulthood.

Also, men are the head of the family and that necessarily means mothers can't give their children advice. They must defer to their husband's ""wisdom"". Always.

And last (and least important, but still annoying): farmers never get dirty. By some miracle, they can work hundreds of acres and never get a speck of dirt on themselves. It's truly amazing.

Overall, horrible film. Just horrible. The main character is so immature, she can't even handle a relationship. And yet...she's ready for marriage? Only if  mom and dad guide her steps. Then, once she's married, I suppose her husband can guide her. Heaven forbid she learns to guide her own decision-making. And heaven forbid a dating couple has time alone, am I right? That way, if they want to remain pure, there's no need for self-control. Just make sure they are NEVER ALONE. So self-control is irrelevant. Sheesh.",1506384000,3,2148,4.898071625344353

Did you see the eye roll when she walked in from literally EVERYONE at the table?  She seemed like a total nut job.  She would have to be to think she and this guy were actually dating.

Like most conservative ""Christian"" presentations, it has the requisite depiction of ""non-believers"" as people having questionable morals and being basically ill-intentioned. I can let that go; I've been a part of that world in the past and I understand the mindset. My main objection is the depiction of the therapist being less than reputable and giving advice no qualified therapist would give. Such negative stereotypes could inhibit young people and their families from seeking needed help with possible mental health issues. It would have been more realistic if the girl had consulted her pastor, or pastor's wife, in this instance, but I suppose that wouldn't have supported the plot.

7498606,1,B017BTMXCU,"The main character comes off as vacuous and in search of jewelry not a spouse. In a jarring incident, on a supposed date with her ""boyfriend,"" she is told he is happily engaged to another girl. Before lunging toward the date where she believes that boyfriend will propose, no one in her family talks to her about her faith or dare to clue her in to what marriage will entail. They instead conduct a very sad fishing expedition to ascertain how she feels her imagined fianc. The writers hint she is ""pure"" and has dated many young men fails to gain any credibility because her behavior around men in general is terribly awkward and forced. Her best friend is also not believable because she is mean and insulting at every turn. I would believe this relationship more if she at least had one friend who felt genuine and this other girl was a frenemy. When she meets someone at a local coffeehouse, she just falls Ike a house of cards and becomes conflicted when she kisses him and he attempts every opportunity to become ""physical."" We learn that she is taking an interior design course which makes her appear even more vacuous after it is revealed that the farm is in trouble and at risk to default the mortgage payment. After her younger brother accidentally spills on her project, she has a tirade that ends up with her brother hit by a huge truck and a new mystery neighbor Doctor playing hero by faking an exam and attesting the boy is fine. None of that was believable. No Doctor would ever let a child hit by a truck not go to the hospital or effectively check effectively for internal injuries without using hospital equipment. She while dating her new beau, isolates herself and does not talk about her guilt or discomfort at kissing, until she has a terrible experience with a Therapist (who is also not at all believable) and confesses to her parents. By this time, I was convinced this girl is either highly functioning Austitic (Asbergers) or so horribly sheltered that she had the social skills of a 10 - 12 year old. This review could go on. As a Christian, and someone who truly feels her faith and was sheltered by her parents in the same manner, I can't applaud how cruelly blind this young woman was written and portrayed. She did not seem mature or socially capable of having any relationships. She also feels incapable of standing by her values which were at best only hinted at. She did not show any kind of self-esteem that would have kept her away from predatory coffeehouse guy. She was so afraid of her own behavior she hid it until it imploded into a tell all to Mommy and Daddy thus showing her to be incapable of finding truth in God or any other healthy counselor.

I guess daddy wasn't there to break up for her, so she couldn't just say they had different values and she wanted someone with the same values.  It was nice the main  character wasn't sleeping around.  But nothing about this movie felt real.  I love the friend who bumps into a guy walking through a door and claims dibs on the guy without ever speaking to him and then tells the main character she has to break up with him because he is her man.  That happens all the time.  The therapist scene was insane.  Not sure what the message is.  Do what dad says and land a doctor?  I wish this was more real and less cliche.

7498655,2,B017BTMXCU,"The movie ""Princess Cut"" was something I hoped I would enjoy.  As a born-again, Christian who serves in ministry, I look for movies with solid biblical values.  Sadly, that was lacking in this movie.  I was disappointed by the negative undertones throughout this movie.  The basic plot is about a woman named Grace, and her family who live on a soybean farm in a warm climate.  A young doctor moves to the small town, and there are various relationship issues at play.

Positives:
Beautiful scenery.
Good cinematography
Good acting by Ashley Bratcher

Negatives:
First, the father figure in the movie misquotes Jeremiah 29:6, and implies that it is about fathers giving away daughters.  That is a misquote.
Second, there is no evangelistic attempts anywhere in the movie, yet several characters are clearly unchurched and worldly.  One of Grace's boyfriends described his traumatic upbringing, and Grace just sort of blows it all off, and does not realize that man is hurting and scarred.  Her ends up being a villain (of course).  Another character, who shows up at the family farm, an old girl friend of the doctor, is also just tossed aside without an consideration.  The dad says to her, ""you have overstayed your welcome missy!""  No compassion at all for the people who do not fit into the farmer's idea of what is right and correct.
Third, throughout the movie there are numerous instances where dating is described as unwholesome, always wrong, and leads to nothing but heartache and emotional trauma. That is very overstated, but yet ""courtship"" is described as the perfect way.
Fourth, there is subtle misogyny all through the movie.  Grace has to ask her dad's permission for everything.  The farmer dad is domineering over everything, even speaking for his wife over and over and over.  Grace is treated like she is 13 years old, but she is about 22 in the movie.  Grace gets chastised for rebuking her little brother, but the little brother puts a single's ad in the paper about Grace, and the farmer dad never corrects him at all.  Blatant sexism, and male domination.  I wondered often in the movie if the family ever read about what women do as described in Proverbs chapter 31?  Over and over the movie pushes the idea that a woman is incomplete without a man dominating her life and making all the decisions for her.  About the only thing the women in this movie decide is on cooking food.
Fifth, there was an anti-intellectual tone to the movie as well.  Grace's boyfriend went off to college, and he becomes a party animal and gets engaged to another girl. so college ruined him.  The male doctor's old girl friend says she too is a doctor, but she is a stalker and it is implied that college and medical school must have ruined her too.
Sixth, there is a totally ridiculous ""therapist"" who offers worldly advice.  Now, I know there are some odd and strange counselors, but the blanket statement this movie makes is that all therapists are somehow pushing some hedonistic agenda is blatantly wrong.  Nowhere is a pastor mentioned as a possible resource.  In fact, I do not think church is even mentioned at all.
Seventh, the doctor ends up recovering the ring he had given the x-girlfreind, and then gets the dad's permission to ask for marriage.
Eighth, the musical score is overpowering in the beginning and does not set the mood or tones at all.

Overall, I did want to like the movie, and tried to look for anything positive about it.

My grade is D+",1486684800,10,3473,4.733777038269551

7498657,1,B017BTMXCU,"I am from a conservative, Christian, homeschooling family with 14 children.  This movie was a complete disappointment.  While I like the idea of courtship, this movie is so horribly done that it ruins even the concept of courtship or godly relationships.  Cheesy & unrealistic beyond belief.  Acting is terrible.  Characters are all based on stereotypes.  I could have overlooked some things: the message of purity & involving parents in relationships was good, but everything else was just so bad.  Grace's character is underdeveloped; you never really know why she was so immature & boy-crazy in the first place nor what makes her change, and she obviously has no life (she's taking an interior design course, she bakes pies, and she pulls weeds).  The ""good relationship"", which I thought was supposed to be the point, has nothing portrayed beyond him asking his parents and then her for permission to court, then cooking & playing games together.  That's it.

SPOILER ALERT:
Just a few of the ridiculous scenes: Grace goes on a ""date"" with a guy who announces his engagement to another girl on said date.  She then starts going out with a guy she meets at a coffee shop.  On one of their dates, they end up at his house and he kisses her.  She feels guilty, so she goes to a psychologist, who tells her to move in with the guy.  Back home, she gets mad at her little brother, who runs out of the house and almost gets run over.  She's shown crying over him, then she runs inside and when her mom asks her what's wrong, she starts talking about how bad she feels about kissing the guy and not telling her parents, not a word about her brother.  So she swears off dating, makes a pact with her parents, reads a bunch of courtship books, and a 28 yr. old single guy who bought the farm next door starts hanging out at their house.  That guy fixes the family's combine, saving them from harvesting hundreds of acres of soybeans by hand (and the dad said they could do the hand-harvesting in just a couple weeks . . . obviously the producer knows nothing about farming!).  Of course, they end up courting, with scripted lines that are so cheesy.  Then his ex-fiancee shows up, they find out who she is, and she stays with Grace's family for a WEEK without any apparent problem.  At a harvest party, Grace's ex shows up too and there's the most ridiculous scene.  Grace is left thinking that her ""special friend"" left with his ex.  At this point in their relationship, she had said that ""we're just friends"", he said ""we're starting a relationship.  He then reappears and proposes to her with no explanation of the ex, she says yes and gets her diamond.

All in all, a waste of your time.  And if you were trying to encourage your kids in courtship or purity, do yourself a favor.  Don't let them watch this. Courtship, or at least their stereotypical version of courtship, will become just one more thing to cringe at and avoid at all costs.

7498672,3,B017BTMXCU,"It was a nice movie but I hate to say, it was contrived. Though I think ""courtship"" with parental guidance is superior to ""dating"" the movie's producers seem to be motivated in order to showcase this concept even tho' there was some entertainment value in it. I don't like to be negative about movies with high moral values but I have to say, gently, that it was pretty amateurish in content in that there was not a good representation of the passage of time between scenes and events. Much of the time the actors didn't seem to really get into their roles so I was left on the outside looking in, not drawn into the story. I gave it 3 stars rather than fewer because I appreciate their efforts to make a G-Rated low budget movie.",1481846400,3,730,4.375
7498673,3,B017BTMXCU,"As a conservative woman of faith, I wanted to really enjoy this film. The values of the Christian family and the young adult daughter are admirably demonstrated, enough so that we forgive the overly simplistic plot and the spectacularly predictable outcomes.

The primary disconnect for me is the failure to show the young woman's mother as fully engaged and capable. While the viewers get the message mom is devout, patient, and full of good works, we do not benefit from her wisdom nor her womanly inspiration as is her right as a faithful wife and mother. Instead, this character is rendered painfully inept and mute by her weird deference to her husband for EVERYTHING except her baking skills. This is uncalled for: if the Christian community hopes to create praise-worthy entertainment to edify and teach correct principles and Godly relationships, why cripple the power of a united marriage partnership by shutting the mouth and influence of a righteous wife and mother?! The constant referral of troubled daughter to ""father knows best"" because of course he alone has the silver bullet for all of life's challenges is neither Biblically-founded nor realistic in today's societal climate of the family (and marriage) in crisis. We need clear examples of sustainability in marriage where husband and wife collaborate together as equals to guide and protect their families.

The acting ability of the main characters was sensitively portrayed, which only exacerbates my great disappointment in the very weak delivery of what should have been a wonderfully topical subject matter for today's faith community.",1481846400,22,1612,5.244186046511628

7498691,2,B017BTMXCU,"This film was a throwback to Victorian times where a father decided who could court his grown daughter.  The daughter and the eventual groom did not appear to ever fall in love.  She never questioned the object of her brotherly-like affection about his former relationship which apparently left a deeply disturbed woman.  The 'friend' was never discovered as a 'viper in her bosom.' The mom's role was limited to distribution of food and hugs.

What bothered me the most though was that there was no personal growth in which she identified the reason for her poor choices in men and obsessive pursuit of a princess cut engagement ring. What could have aided her (and made an impact on young viewers) were the therapy sessions but the film's irresponsible portrayal of a psychologist who recommended a starter marriage made that impossible.

I could have overlooked the bad acting and writing for a Christian movie focused on purity but this was terribly disappointing.",1476489600,5,968,4.987577639751553

It was also helpful to see the portrayal of parents trying to figure out how to guide a grown daughter. It was great demonstrating the Father's role in helping protect his daughter.

The father is the Patriarch of the family.  His daughter thought she desired a more worldly life.  She tried to live a Christ-like life while appearing to be worldly. When she followed her father and mother's counsel, she was able to live a truly happy life. A life that is devoted to God.

7498722,5,B017BTMXCU,"In a day and age world our country has degraded the family and many homes are fatherless Princess Cut is a fresh reminder that there is another way to do relationships. A way that restores honor, respect and value to marriage - the Union of a man to a wife.

Next to your choice of faith -  for God or against God your mate will be someone who helps shape your character. Never should any relationship be entered into which is not protected, guarded, and watched out for by the parents or other family members as odd as this may seem. The movie portrays it very well.

You can make out with just about anyone but not just anyone will make out to be a forever friend or marriage partner. I applaud no kissing till there's a ring on it and up it one more notch and say no kissing till the pastor says and now you may kiss the Bride.

If your heart longs for a different way - know it's not utopia it's God's heartbeat. Be different. Take a stand. Share the movie.

I have nothing against high moral standards, but I find this over the top self righteous, judgmental. So many things bugged me in this movie. I believe mothers & fathers are an equal team, One. Mom is just as worthy to council & guide. It bugs me how down the nose these ""Christians seemed to treat anyone who was not ""cut from the same cloth"". I'm having a hard time expressing just how hypocritically snobby I found this movie to be. I really bugs me, because I think so much good could come out of these sort of movies, but often the AWEFUL acting and over the top self righteousness turns so many off.

Why I give the film 3 stars...the script was really all over the place not flowing nicely with extraneous characters and storylines thrown in.  Some of the actors were not very good (even if the script was better they might just be so-so actors).  I think focusing on the main character's transformation, her interactions with the men in her life and more with her best friend would have been more interesting.

7498761,3,B017BTMXCU,"2.5 stars. I was really hopeful that this would be a good movie and I think it should have been. But for me it's the flat acting, bad writing, multiple story directions that makes this movie just barely OK. Ex. From a friend advising Grace to meet with a counselor because she is concerned about her relationship with her boyfriend (who does that?), to the boyfriend going psycho, to a girlfriend becoming conniving, to a friend wigging out because she believes Grace stole the man she never had a relationship with, to her brother getting hit by a car, to her brother writing an ad and getting strange people showing up..it just doesn't stop. It would have been great to see the relationship between Grace and the doctor played out instead of focusing on irrelevant stuff.",1461801600,12,773,4.6911764705882355

7498767,3,B017BTMXCU,"I wanted to be able to give this 5 stars, but in reality I can't. Perhaps it was the acting, the uneven tone of the story that kept me from it. It is a beautiful thing when a family can communicate, especially about expectations for finding a mate. I feel, though, that there is a happy medium between no touching (they didn't even hold hands) and having sex outside of marriage for Christian couples in their 20's. Maybe that's what bothered me. There seemed to be no progression of a relationship heading for marriage between the young man and woman. She seemed afraid of an arranged marriage, but her situation almost seemed like one, with all the chaperoning - even in the house. All of a sudden, he proposes marriage - seemingly motivated to do so by the appearance of a woman he'd rather forget. I won't even give credence to the scene with the former boyfriend. No, just no. I would much rather have seen the development of a healthy, give-and-take relationship - talking about future plans, families, past relationships and being honest about them, hearing and seeing them get to know each other - even in a restaurant setting would have been more realistic. I would have liked to have seen them discuss Christ in their lives, go to church together, meet each other's friends. Her best friend saw him as her man, and our young miss didn't know it? I was disappointed, plain and simple - not that they had standards but that I as a viewer never once felt like rooting for them as a couple.",1461196800,7,1496,4.544444444444444

7498774,5,B017BTMXCU,"This is a very good Christian movie! While the acting is a little awkward at times, it isn't downright painful as some. I really appreciate the message, hence the 5 stars.  I would much rather watch a movie with a pure message of truth and encouragement and put up with a little ""awkwardness"" than a ""professional Hollywood"" movie that promotes wishy washy values, lies,and immorality. So this movie was refreshing. I encourage you to watch the extra feautures. I gained an added appreciation for the movie after hearing/seeing the writers' desire in conveying Godly messages and themes.",1453248000,14,587,5.051546391752577
7498775,5,B017BTMXCU,This was an excellent movie.  I highly recommend all Christian parents to show this to their daughters.,1452816000,3,103,5.0588235294117645
7498776,5,B017BTMXCU,Loved it!!!! Such a great Christian movie!,1452556800,,42,5.142857142857143
7498777,2,B017BTMXCU,"How you feel about this movie will depend largely on how you feel about Christian movies in general and about a certain model of romantic relationships in particular, in which the parents (especially the father) of the girl are highly involved (guy's parents do not appear) and no kissing is allowed until a ring is on her finger.  If this sounds great to you, you will probably love this movie and there's no need to read further.

If this sounds like a little bit much ... it is.  The main character Grace seems to be helplessly tossed between insincere or pushy boyfriends (which makes her look a bit stupid in the first case, and unable to express opinions in the second) until she decides to let God make the choice (or something like that) and almost immediately a perfect guy shows up to ask Daddy's permission to date her.  It's a little bit too pat (unfortunately typical of the Christian movies I've seen).  And somehow, Grace felt very immature, to the point she seemed more like a teenager  than the ""early 20's"" she was supposed to be (per the official summary).  Her parents are way too overprotective (at one point her father remarks she's ""way too attached"" after she talks happily about her boyfriend of 15 months).  I wish we could've seen more personal growth from the (extremely brief) time Grace was single.

And then there is the reason I'm rating this a two: the ridiculous characters that show up to try to put Grace and/or Mr. Perfect on the wrong path.  A therapist who recommends a ""starter marriage"" (which to Grace equals living together before marriage?  I have never heard anyone use the phrase with that meaning, and I have never heard a starter marriage being recommended positively either, so that whole scene was just very stupid to me).  Stalker ex #1, annoying but harmless (and apparently unfamiliar with the idea of cooking at home?  Because, of course, only good country people use their kitchens).  And stalker ex #2, who suddenly turns the smarmy up to 11, and then in the climax, starts swinging around a shovel (!) as if he actually intends to kill somebody (!!!), even though he's shown no violence or anger issues before.  This last incident actually made me burst out laughing because it was so ridiculous and out of place in the movie.

I should say, I don't necessarily have a problem with the ideals put forth in this film (even if I would never want a guy to ask my parents' permission for a date); it did have a certain sweetness to it.  I just wish the characters felt a bit more like real people I could relate to instead of caricatures.  Unfortunately, Christian movies seem to be rife with this sort of thing, so if you've enjoyed them before/haven't noticed these issues, you'll probably like this one too.  If not, steer clear.",1449878400,18,2785,4.646938775510204
7498778,5,B017BTMXCU,This Christian romance flick has a good emphasis on patience in relationships and on personal growth rather than just waiting for the perfect person to come along.

8738558,2,B017BTMXCU,"The premises okay but the way they set it up as a little odd overall it's a cute idea with a cute family unit. Big problem, they portray a therapist or counselor completely wrong if a counselor in this film acted This Way in real life should be disbarred and should be disbarred but I don't like the indication that just because someone has a face and wants to seek help from a professional that they won't get it. Many religious counselors don't have the training necessary for certain problems and they're certainly nothing wrong with a person of faith using their family for Council their religious leader for Council and a therapist for Council therefore I find us from dangerous and misleading.",1536192000,,699,4.691056910569106

8738560,2,B017BTMXCU,The values and morals were high which I can truly appreciate but this was not real life. I love clean shows without swearing and sex but this was a bit corny and too dramatic which makes it unbelievable for me and hard to watch.

We need to portray real life if we are teaching principles to live by and this show didn't seem to be just for entertainment.,1536019200,,422,4.072289156626506

What I don't get is how the heck this 20 something year old woman was so naive, immature and completely dependant on mom and dad.  I honestly thought she was supposed to be 16 or 17, so I was really creeped out when they introduced the 28 year old suitor.
