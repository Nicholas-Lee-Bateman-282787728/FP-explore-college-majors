646815,4,6303444075,"Safe Passages is an extremely engaging film of a family in the process of change. Susan Sarondon and Sam Shepherd play the parents of seven sons. All except one are now raised and out of the house. Sarandon having been a Mom  since 19 is now in crisis; the realization of the energy she has spent  raising her sons -- at the personal cost of any career or work is a  challenging crossroads for her. We find her resentful of her children on  one hand for having kept her away from career and frightened on the other  hand of what to do with her life now that her sons are raised. She is  completely uncertain that she can start a career at this point in her  life. The entire family is summoned upon learning that one of the boys may  have been killed in a terrorist bombing upon the Marie barracks he was  assigned to. While clearly emergent, the family finds itself coming  together only to be stuck together in wait -- the endless process of  identifying who has died and who the survivors are is a careful and lengthy  bureaucratic process. In the waiting together, the family is on one hand  frightened at the prospect of the news they are waiting for while at the  same time unintentionally re-examining their lives as a family unit. It is  obvious by the kids' assessment of their Mom that she was a tremendous one.  They are each extremely well grounded -- with the exception of the youngest  who is still home caught in the midst of Mom and Dad's empty-nest crisis --  and have wonderful recollections of a strong loviing woman and a very  involved father who reared them. The dad is the less dominant of the couple  but he was very clearly involved in the loving care of raising his sons,  although more involved with the two boys who were runners who shared his  common interest in running. The empty-nest is difficult for him as well.  When we meet both parents, beyond the emergency of their missing son, both  of them are going through the worst of redefining their identities. Mom  seems to believe she has nothing in common with Dad other than the boys at  this point. Mom is a bit over the edge and has announced a separation. Dad  is sleeping in his office. Through the coming together of the family, much  of the crises seem to abate as Sarondon and Shephard realize that they have  done a pretty good job of raising well adjusted men who like each other and  have a deep respect for their parents. The movie's ending is a hopeful one,  the immediate foreshadowing of the promise of Sage Passage for the parents  is the news that their Marine son has survived and is fine. While it  finishes there, we're pretty confident that Sarondon and Shepherd will make  Safe Passages of their own as they move on together as a couple -- for the  first time in many years -- without parental responsibilities. Excellent  performances by Susan Sarondon, Sean Astin and Robert Sean Leonard.",915235200,5,2895,4.510597302504817

Susan Sarandon is amazing in this movie.
This is a must watch movie",1403568000,,109,4.5
646953,4,6303444075,"To me I never caught where any gay scene were really in it to cause it to be a gay interest movie?
To me it was mainly a movie about one of the kids that goes off to fight and not know if he makes it home or not till the end.
You can watch that right now on TV for free I should have really saved my money.
There may have been some ok parts in it but really to much drama between the brothers.",1391731200,,393,3.5813953488372094
646954,5,6303444075,"I had been looking for this movie for some time and was delighted to find it on here.  It didn't disappoint at all. This is a feel good movie for all who see it. It is an all-star cast and the comedic moments break through the suspense with great balance. I recommend this for any family who has a member serving in the military as it gives a great perspective of those who 'serve' at home, supporting them from afar. It also is a fantastic illustration of the complexities of family life in general and how we interact with each other during difficult times.",1391040000,,559,4.375
646955,5,6303444075,Great movie about the emotional turmoil a family goes through while they wait for word about one of the sons who is in the service and who they believe was in a building that was bombed. Wonderful cast and very touching movie.,1389225600,,226,4.404761904761905

647013,5,6303444075,I have this movie on VCR but now needed it one DVD to enjoy more memories with ever passing year.  I would suggest all parents watch this movie--Susan Sarandon was a wonderful mother and raised wonderful sons.  Not a good movie to watch if you have children still at home as it is not funny to watch when you living the movie--but when the house is empty everything seems a little more humorous.,1356652800,,395,4.397260273972603
647014,5,6303444075,"I'm a bit hard-boiled for fambly movies, but Safe Passage really got to me. Everyone in it is excellent, and this includes the dogs and cats. The line that finally broke me up was spoken by the son who was a runner in high school, who said he ""never even felt his feet"" as he won the trophy that distinguished his existence and almost ruined his desire to excell; it recalled exactly the way I felt as a junior in high school in Texas when I realized I'd been accepted by Harvard.

Get this movie and enjoy, enjoy. It's a doozy.",1349222400,,528,4.227722772277228

it at a great price.",1342828800,,130,3.4827586206896552
647016,4,6303444075,"I liked this movie a lot. It was very intresting to see into the workings of a big family and how even though they all had their own lives, they were still connected and were able to pull together in the middle of potential crisis.

The mom, Mrs. SInger (played by Susan Surandon! yay!) seemed a little like my own mother in that I could see her sometimes getting intuition* feelings ar dreams about them, and silently worrying and wondering.

This was  a very believable movie to me. Not everyone will like it and they might think it is boring. But I liked it very uch and thought it was honest.",1315353600,,596,4.351351351351352
647017,5,6303444075,"As a fan of the book, I think this movie did a great job at bringing the life of the family to film.  I enjoy the craziness and the fighting and the complete love that they all have for one another.  It's easy to relate to for most of us.",1252713600,,238,3.74
647018,5,6303444075,"Although I will watch ANY film with Susan Surandon, all of her movies are good ones, this one is exceptional.  I also love Sam Shepard.  There is Sean Duke Aston and Robert Sean Leonard from House.  This is a great film.  You will not be bored.  Wish they'd come out with more films like this.  The reviews below/above for the most part are correct.  We all come from dysfunctional families, it's a matter of degree, so I especially love watching movies involving dysfunctional families.  (Anyone who says their family is/was not dysfunctional is in denial).  Wonderful film, recommend it highly for anyone who wants to enjoy an exceptional movie.",1250294400,,647,4.862385321100917
647019,5,6303444075,"An overprotective mother crosses over the boundary of the  emotional barriers when she fears her son's death in a military explosion and must wait for the official notice. On the other hand a desperate man who want to be redeemed, and the eldest son who tries to keep the family together will be the dramatic coordinates of this unusual film, of notorious level and high artistic virtues.

Consider the year: 1994; and two futures Oscar winners: Marcia Gay Harden and Susan Sarandon; besides add the presence of Sam Shepard and Robert Sean Leonard and the fine direction of Robert Allen Ackerman.",1147996800,,596,4.891089108910891
647020,5,6303444075,"This is one of my favorite movies.  As a 40 year male with no children I don't think I'll ever be able to get closer to understanding the feeling a mother has about her children than when I watched this moovie.  Great ensemble cast.  You'll defiantly laugh and cry in this movie. Sarandon and Shepard were great.  I don't know the name of any of the children but it included the guy from swing kids and the guy from Mall Rats.  The kid that figured out teh alergy situation has been around to and they all do a good job.  Lots of realism in Surandans neurosis.  There is a great piece of acting by the actress who played the wife of the ""swing kids guy"" in the kitchen scene with Sarandon. I call it the tequila and meatloaf sceen.  That's the best scene in the movie mostly due to some dynamite dialogue. Other great scenes include the scene at the creek, the post dog attack, the fire in the driveway scene, the reporter confrentation, and the morning bunk bed sceen when the young kid says today's the day we'll find out.",1074902400,7,1024,4.324607329842932
647021,3,6303444075,"I watched this the week before Mother's Day and couldn't help thinking what a good gift it would make for a strong, passionate sort of mother.  There is one scene with a savage dog that I will remember for a long time  because of what it says about a mother's love.  It's an interesting,  offbeat film about love, families, and mothers. I will also continue to  think some about the scene where the mother reacts to the son's smoking  dope and he let's her know she can't knock something she hasn't tried.  Again, the depth of her passionate mothering is inspirational.",957744000,4,569,4.574257425742574
647022,5,6303444075,"I thought that Susan Sarndon's character was incerdibly moving as well as Sam Shepard,Sean Aston and of course the young actor that always has my respect, Nick Stahl. A movie about family closeness and not missing a thing.",938476800,5,222,4.868421052631579
