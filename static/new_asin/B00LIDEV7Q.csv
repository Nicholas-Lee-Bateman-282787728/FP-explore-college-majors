8666133,4,B00LIDEV7Q,I've never understood the hate for Karate Kid 3. It absolutely escapes me. It's just as well made and acted as the wonderful first 2 films in the trilogy. I know that director John G. Avildsen and writer Robert Mark Kamen were upset that they didn't get to do their original concept for part 3 (which told the story of the first Miyagi coming to China) but that doesn't make the film that ended up getting made bad whatsoever. This one adds some interesting new directions that are really engrossing. Thomas Ian Griffith is the standout in a great performance as the main villain as well as the other villains in the film. I've read some of the reasons a lot of people have for hating this film but I can't relate to any of those reasons. The only thing that keeps me from giving the film 5 stars is because the climactic fight is disappointing. Other than that it's a solid conclusion to this fantastic trilogy. This blu ray is also the one to get as well as it is a quality pressed disc instead of the US Sony burned BD-R crap and it's region free so it will play on any blu ray player.,1521849600,,1088,4.286407766990291
8666134,4,B00LIDEV7Q,"First things first, The KARATE KID part III on this REGION FREE German Blu Ray DOES INDEED play on the average USA Blu Ray Player.  It immediately played in English, I didn't even have to switch the audio language.  I have a pretty average $80 Sony 3D Blu Ray Player and this title played absolutely fine in it.  I was worried that it wouldn't play since it was German manufactured but the description said it was ""region free"" so I decided to give it a shot... and I am glad that I did.

As for the picture quality: Comparing it to the Sony DVD release that came out in the early 2000's, there is definitely an improvement in quality.  The picture is sharper, the contrast is better, the colors are better (more natural), and overall it's a pretty decent looking title.  I did notice that parts of it appeared a bit grainer than expected, but the grain is natural and likely looked exactly this way in the theater.  In fact, it seems that the grain became less as we head into the second half of the movie.  Comparing this PART III Blu Ray to the Sony KARATE KID PART II Blu Ray, I would have to say that the PART II disc does look a little bit cleaner, but not by a whole lot.  I would rate PART III a 3.3 out of 5 in picture quality and Part II a 3.8 out of 5.  Audio quality on both discs is very good.  So overall, if you are looking to add the HIGH DEFINITION version of PART III to your collection, I would definitely say to grab this German ""region free"" import.  It may be a tad pricey at $22.99 BUT it's an imported disc and when I ordered it you could also get it shipped free with Prime.  For some reason PART III has not yet been released as a Region 1 USA disc, so this german region free disc is the way to get it for now.

As for the movie itself, it may be the most ""over the top"" of the Macchio/Morita  KARATE KID movies, but the story is fun and much more like the original movie than PART II which had less action.  Some of the extreme laughing by the villains is hilarious and a few of the karate moves (in some scenes) needed a little more power to them, but the relationship between Miyagi and Daniel is still engaging and fun to watch blossom.  I prefer this one to PART II because it's more fun.",1468454400,,2220,4.125581395348838
