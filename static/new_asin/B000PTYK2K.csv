8193470,1,B000PTYK2K,No video to follow while exercising. provides a lot of basic information the general public has had for years.  Very disappointed. I was hoping this would be a great workout for the guys.,1368144000,3,187,4.666666666666667
8193471,1,B000PTYK2K,I'm very disappointed in this DVD. I wanted a daily routine of ab workouts. What i got was a video that is 80% talking without any exercises. Then when they do show the exercises they are clumped all together at the end without any instructions. Definitely not worth the $18 if you want a great ab DVD to follow.,1225584000,5,312,4.305084745762712
8193472,5,B000PTYK2K,"The Program on this DVD is great. I work a desk job 9-5 and as you can imagine it doesn't keep me very active. I was gaining weight, snacking all day at my desk and just getting depressed about it, this all changed when a friend recommended this DVD to me and it has proved to be one of the best investments of my life! I would recomend this DVD to anybody. No matter how fit you are, how in-experienced you are or how clueless you are when it comes to diet and nutrition to lose that stomach fat, this DVD covers it all. If you want a DVD that will show you everything from an effective ab workout to making meals that will help drop pounds from your stomach, this really is going to be the best 20 bucks you've ever spent. It did it for me and i'm sure it can do it for you.",1189036800,,776,3.949044585987261
8193473,3,B000PTYK2K,"This video is not like traditional abs videos.  Most videos (8-minute abs, Gilad abs workout, etc) contain a set workout with an instructor leading you through routines.  This video is more like an instruction manual on what exercises to do and how to do them.  It is not something you are going to watch for each workout.  It is something that you will reference on occasion prior to doing your own workouts.  It does have good tips in regards to form, sets, nutrition, etc (not much more than what you find in a Muscle and Fitness or Men's Health magazine though).  Not a lot of advanced moves or things that I have not seen before.  The video quality is not the best but it does have a lot of content.
Overall, it takes a different approach than other fitness videos and is almost like an interactive abs book.",1184457600,18,813,4.452702702702703
8193474,5,B000PTYK2K,"This is not your run of the mill Abs DVD that just gives you a workout to get on with. As well as the various ab workouts this DVD covers everything from Diet and Nutrition which is the key to getting great abs. Recovery, preparation, strength training and much more. Everything you ever wanted to know on how to get abs is in this DVD, very impressed...a happy customer!!",1182729600,5,372,4.405797101449275
8193475,5,B000PTYK2K,"I really enjoyed this DVD. Easy to understand and enjoyable workouts that I can do at home and in the gym. I like the fact that it also has a large glossary of exercises that I can use to customize my own workouts. The dvd also explains the importance of diet and nutrition and how it helps to carve your abdominal muscles. I found this dvd to be a real good package and explains that there is more to getting abs than just doing exercises. You get an ebook with this dvd which is jam packed with information and workouts. All in all a nice dvd, highly recommended.",1182297600,,565,4.2407407407407405
8193476,1,B000PTYK2K,"This dvd wasn't what I had expected.  When I purchased it, I thought there would be a workout on this dvd.  To my surpise there was not.  There were many ab excercises and examples of a person doing a couple of reps of each, but no complete workout to follow along with.  If you are looking for some exercises to use while you are at the gym, this may be a dvd for you, but if you want a workout dvd to use at home, don't purchase this product.",1182038400,70,444,3.955056179775281
8193477,5,B000PTYK2K,"I usually don't put much in the supplier feedback - prompt service, happy with my purchase etc.  But with the Sixpack Now abdominal program I felt I had to tell people about this great product.  The DVD is presented in easy to digest sections, with summary screens really driving home the key points they are trying to get across.  This isn't a fad diet, a new program endorsed by a famous face, or the same old routines that get rehashed every month in the fitness magazines.  The workout and diet advice comes from personal trainers and fitness athletes who use these principles themselves.  The stuff on this DVD works....period.  As well as this you also get an e-book that is free to download when you purchase the DVD.  The book is easily one on the best that I have read on this subject and is full of great advice and tips and even meal recipes and ideas.  I cannot recommend this product highly enough.  This DVD and book will give you the knowledge and motivation to achieve your goals.  All you need is the willpower to stick with it.",1179187200,9,1045,4.481481481481482
