5168461,5,B008KXLAUS,"I love Monster High. The storyline/CG is excellent, and the characters are great! I hope they make another Monster High DVD really soon (with ""Normies"" & monsters; and it should be called Monster High: Monster Human High(New Beginnings) AKA ""Monster High 2""!!! BE YOURSELF, BE UNIQUE, BE A MONSTER :D!!!",1350000000,3,303,5.08
5168462,4,B008KXLAUS,"I am an adult Monster High collector and fan of the webisodes, so I was very excited to add a dvd of the ghouls to my collection!

The movie is cute with a simple storyline that kids will enjoy. A fictional history of Halloween is used as a means to get the plot going.  All of the characters were true-to-character, and the movie did a good job of highlighting as many Monster High ghouls as possible.

I was disappointed that there were no well-known recorded songs in the movie.  Even in dance scenes, what amounts to elevator music was played.  Familiar songs would have added to the Halloween theme of the movie.

The three shorts included on this dvd are funny, and are done in the same style as the webisodes.

I wish the movie had more of a Halloween ""feel"" to it, but I'm happy with the cute story it is.  Overall, if you are a Monster High fan, I think you will enjoy this movie for all of the familiar faces we have grown to love.",1349827200,5,941,4.247191011235955
5168463,5,B008KXLAUS,"I got hook on Monster High when I started watching web episodes on on the Mattel site and was stoked when I heard of this movie. I was not disappointed.  Though I was surprise that with the movie spending so much time in the catacombs that we didn't have Operaetta play a bigger part than she did.

  The movie deals with Frankie Stein having her first Halloween since she was brought to life. Having read some many Normie magazines on the holiday she was sparking until one of her teachers showed her a film that Halloween is the night that normals come after and attack monsters. Even when a group of high school kids prank their school Frankie doesn't believe it right and find the truth in catacombs.  A secret Halloween room between human and monster sides of town where both sides use to come together and party on Halloween night. When Frankie tries to tell others Cleo stir up the monsters prank back and result with them on the run from the police and hiding out in a Normie Halloween party where they make new friends to help them against the problems Cleo and Van Helsing's niece is causing between the two schools.  As often with the Monster High universe its Frankie who comes up with a solution.

The DVD comes with three internet episodes that hasn't been posted yet and a trailer for another Monster High double feature DVD coming this spring that includes Nicktoon special WHY DO GHOULS FALL IN LOVE.

The voices of Rochelle Goyle and Robecca Steam takes a little to get use to. I though Rochelle would of had more of a French accept like the characters in Pixar's Ratatouine for instance.

If your already a fan of Monster High or just love a good animated Halloween movie theme special you'll love this one.",1349740800,5,1726,4.541935483870968
5168464,4,B008KXLAUS,"Just watched this movie with my husband and I loved it! It's a little too fast paced and the characters are quite a bit goofier then usual, but it was still a fun watch. This adult Monster High hardcore fan recommends this to young and old fans alike! :3",1349740800,,254,4.204081632653061
5168465,5,B008KXLAUS,"My daughter and I are HUGE fans of Monster High. We can't get enough. It is a sickness that has spread to the point that the local Wal-Mart employees know us by name. Yes, we scour the aisles, hunt down the newest dolls, and squeal in victory, boxes in hand like two little kids. Okay, in my daughter's defense she is 9. As for myself, I have no excuse other than these are the coolest, most beautiful in a dark and enchanting way, dolls to hit the market in a long time. So feed your MH obsession and what better way than with the new DVD :) Stay ghoul....",1349481600,4,557,4.1192660550458715
5168466,3,B008KXLAUS,"the animation is very nice, the music and the design are just perfect, but the problems are on the scrypt and dialogues, always an easy and short way to solve the plots, the story is too compressed that characters and conflicts happens in a fast and superficial way, the jokes are soft and without originality, the scrypt looks like made it by student or inexperienced people. the main story idea is very good, but the movie looks like made it with no big film ambitions.

of course this perspective is just mine (and adult guy dolls collector) but making a comparison; My Little Pony ""friendship is magic"" episodes are WAY better, more much fun and original than monster high specials including ""ghouls rule"" :(",1349222400,5,712,4.741935483870968

If you like to do the same with your kids, this is an adorable film to enjoy with your entire family. Seems Monster High comes under a lot of scrutiny from some consumers who are ""offended"" by it and think it's too inappropriate for young children. I've seen the show and this is the second movie I've seen and I can tell you, it's nothing like what those people think. The premise is that they're all basically the teen children of famed literary monsters who are attending high school. That's it. No dirty innuendo. And no horror as far as I can see. No gore. It's all squeaky clean and my niece really enjoys it. She and my nephew were glued to the telly the entire time it was on. Worth every bit of the $5 spent! It's a nice one to add to the Halloween movie watching tradition.",1444867200,,911,4.333333333333333

My girls have always been afraid to watch these because of the ""Monster"" title, but for some reason they decided to watch an episode and are hooked.  And so am I, where was this show when I was a kid?  I like the ""moral"" behind the stories here, which is acceptance of people for who they are and with all their ""freaky flaws.""  It's a cute storyline and really such fun twists on traditional stories.  Some of the nuances of the show really crack me up and I have as much fun watching as my girls do.  This appeals to many ages as my girls are 3, 4, 8, and 11 and all love to watch.",1428537600,,616,4.008196721311475

5168601,5,B008KXLAUS,"This is adorable, if I'm mistaken, this movie is about segregation of the monsters from humans. It brings the message don't judge a book by its cover through parties and teenage drama. Parents this is not an educational show, it's strictly entertainment. Everything is about looking good and fitting in so you'll get your share of fashion puns. Other than that, it's so cute and I'd buy it again if needed.",1393977600,,406,4.732394366197183

They're funny, smart and full of positive messages for both girls and boys.  And I like the fact that it's the girls who save the day (don't worry, I don't do spoilers, so that's all I'll say) and that both boys and girls use their heads to solve problems.

5168644,3,B008KXLAUS,"I am rating this movie as a mother of 8 and 5 year old girls who love Monster High dolls.  Before I had children I was disgusted by the Bratt dolls with too much makeup and revealing clothes, I could not believe parents would let their girls play with them.  Well......there is not too much difference in the makeup and clothing style of MH girls vs Bratt dolls and I am a little mad at myself for allowing these dolls and hoping that they can see that the styles are (much like Barbie) not what you wear in the real world.  Anyway, I read the reviews for this DVD and thought it sounded ok.  While watching it I found that it is teenager oriented and not really for little girls.  There are relationship problems and dating problems that the girls deal with.  Also, it is really offensive the way they portray the local police.  They make the cops, who play a large part in the storyline, look like complete idiots who only care about eating donuts and judging the MH students.
I do think the dolls are kind of cute but there won't be anymore MH DVDs in our household. The movies and probably the dolls too are aimed at Tweens and Teens but the only ones I see playing with the dolls are under 10 yrs old.",1369612800,5,1206,4.2631578947368425
5168645,5,B008KXLAUS,"I'm a sucker for the Monster High series and this was a great one to see. The animation was incredible; I was really worried about it being in 3-D. There were only two parts that caught me off-guard about the animation that I didn't quite like so much (mostly in characters using the same generated motions for movement; too computer-synchronized). I really enjoyed how all the familiar characters were involved throughout and the ending did take me by surprise.

Probably the biggest point was a tear-jerking scene near the end at the climax. It is so difficult to get me to cry and this actually managed to do it.

Sure they're supposed to be using the show to drive sales on a toy brand, but whoever wrote these characters and the setting for them is a creative talent. I think they got lucky. Other shows and movies based on toy lines like Wing-X, G.I. Joe, Lego originals, or the Littlest Pet Shop TV series, even Barbie is just too hideously poor.",1369094400,,953,4.567251461988304

5168664,2,B008KXLAUS,"it was okay, typical monster high stuff which my daughter loves. For 10 dollars (9.99) it was way too short. I did notice in Target that the DVD is packaged with two monster high movies, which would make it worth what I paid for it.",1364515200,,232,4.177777777777778

Even my oldest daughter, who's not a MH fan, thought the movie was good. Draculaura is being wooed by a suave handsome guy named Valentine and Claude, her regular boyfriend, is in over his head.

5168711,4,B008KXLAUS,"I recommend this for folks who like monsters, and Halloween.

I love the concept behind the doll characters and thought I'd give the movie a shot.  It definitely wasn't the same production quality as you'd get from movies like Monsters, Inc. and Toy Story.  In spite of that it was easy to look past that and enjoy the characters.  They're what really drive the movie.  Their costumes are killer and the story didn't suck either.  It was pretty cute and actually made sense.  Thank goodness.  With kid movies you just never know what kind of dribble you're going to get so I was pleasantly surprised by the quality of the story.",1357948800,7,628,4.594594594594595

5168714,3,B008KXLAUS,"This is a good price here at Amazon for this movie. We paid almost the same at Target when it was on sale there. This movie can be found in the DVD section- not in the doll section. All the dolls are sold separately. My daughter requested only a few definite gifts for Xmas, and this was one of them. Otherwise, I would never have bought this. I figure that you can just wait for someone to post it on youtube or for Mattel to even put it out on the MH website. The movie is a little over an hour, and is tolerable adult-wise. It is the bonus footage that stinks. It has three shorts which are two minutes in length each. Yes, you did not read wrong, folks- two minutes. If you wanna be positive, we can do the math and get to a grand total of six minutes. Mattel, people love bonuses in any form. Hook us up next time.",1357689600,,819,4.030674846625767

5168782,5,B008KXLAUS,"I wasn't expecting much, even after watching several of the entertaining, but short Webisodes of Monster High. The movie blows it all away. The animation is 3D and it and the story are cinema-quality. The story is a lot more fleshed out from the early Webisodes I saw. It has a lot more depth and can be enjoyed on many levels. In the film, the monsters get setup by an anonymous person who defiles the normie high school. While they try to figure out who the real culprit is, the normies blame them for vandalizing their high school, become prejudiced against monsters, and Holt Hyde gets arrested. They have to try to find a way to ameliorate the misunderstanding, especially before Holt gets tortured.

Meanwhile, Draculaura is throwing dates at Claw Deene, who doesn't want the attention. Holt Hyde finds out what it's like to pass as normal while being his alter ego Jackson in the normie high school. Cleo de Nile struggles with her family's rejection of her boyfriend Deuce, because he's a nonroyal ""slacker.""

Lots of smart dialogue, references to their monster backgrounds (probably over the heads of some kids), and at one point Ghoulia (spelling?) uses her quiet brains to set up a GPS triangulation to find Holt. Very layered, professional, and entertaining. There's also three extra short videos that are well-done.",1353974400,3,1328,4.897777777777778

All and all, a pretty good movie.  We watched it together the day it arrived.  We both liked it.  I'd say it's similar to Scooby Doo meets the modern, pre-teen world.  The voices of the characters are all different, which I liked.  It seems the Barbie movies' characters all sound the same.  That gets old quickly.  All and all, if you have a Monster High Fan, I'm not sure you can go wrong. :)",1352160000,,560,4.298076923076923

However the requirement to write a review as apposed to just rating it with stars if VERY annoying AMAZON. If a person going to trust a review; then a STAR RATING is satisfactory...

5168813,5,B008KXLAUS,"I'm old enough to remember when the activists who would go on to ruin broadcast television for children first sounded warnings against half hour or one hour commercials, that is animated children's TV shows based upon an existing line of toys.  Frankly, I never understood the alleged vast moral difference between doing this as opposed to creating the TV show FIRST and only THEN merchandising the crap out of it with dolls, action figures, boardgames, Underoos, etc., but I DID find the designations useful because in those bad old days, the toy-based TV shows tended to be just awful, and I studiously avoided them.

Well, time has passed, and would be creators of children's videos with even an ounce of controversy or creativity have largely abandoned broadcast TV, first for cable and then for the Internet, and somewhere along the way toy companies figured out that more was required in an era when watching commercials required making a positive choice.  As a father of young children, I have been forced to watch more children's videos (of both kinds) than the Geneva Conventions would allow, and for sanity's sake have come to appreciate the ones that try hardest to be clever, including some real surprises.  The Barbie videos in particular, instead of being the eye clawing horrors I expected, turned out to be rather entertaining, but the best of them all IMHO have turned out to be the Monster High videos, including this first commercial DVD release.  There was an earlier Monster High DVD release of the 1st TV special ""New Ghoul at School"" but it was only made available in limited editions of the Dawn of the Dance series of dolls:

Monster High Dawn Of The Dance Deuce Gorgon Doll with exclusive DVD, and
Monster High Dawn Of The Dance 3 Pack: Clawdeen Wolf, Draculaura, and Frankie Stein Dolls with exclusive DVD,

until recently when it was reissued as a retailer exclusive both separately:&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Monster-High-New-Ghoul-At-School/dp/B00LWJ3OB0/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Monster High: New Ghoul At School</a>&nbsp;and as part of a 2-pack:&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Monster-High-Clawesome-Double-Feature-Fright-On-Escape-from-Skull-Shores-Monster-High-New-Ghoul-At-School/dp/B00M0CHBY4/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Monster High: Clawesome Double Feature - Fright On! / Escape from Skull Shores / Monster High: New Ghoul At School</a>&nbsp;with:

What makes the Monster High videos work so well IMHO is that the writers are gently making fun of the fashion doll mania that they are in fact trying to promote.  Taking the universal American experience of High School and adding the twist of the entire student body being the children of famous monsters gives them endless possibilities for parody (and self parody, as the heroines are for the most part over the top, fashion crazed, popularity obsessed teenagers).

Now to the movie.  The plot involves newbie Frankie Stein's first Halloween (she was just recently created by Dr. Frankenstein rather than being born) where she learns to her horror that her fellow monsters regard Halloween (a holiday her normal human teen magazines celebrate) as a day of danger for hiding from humans.  In her attempts to get at the truth of the matter, Frankie (as per usual) sets in motion a cascading series of increasing catastrophes that it will be up to her and her friends to salvage a happy ending from (and push a gentle but persistent message that our differences shouldn't unnecessarily divide us).  The film also packs in a number of hilarious gags and subplots involving the MC's relationship problems.  (You think YOU had BF/GF problems in HS?)  Finally, the DVD contains three (formerly) exclusive ""webisodes"" now watchable for free on the Monster High web site, for some reason arranged in reverse chronological order:

44 Flowers for Slow Moe
39 I Scream, You Scream
38 No Ghouls Allowed

Note: A retailer exclusive version of this DVD is obtainable from certain merchants containing an extra DVD with the first 15 Monster High ""webisodes"" on it.  Of course these ""webisodes"" are free to view online, but since they are being sold for the same price as the non-exclusive DVD's, they are arguably the better buy.

Note: For some reason the ""webisodes"" on the retailer exclusive DVD are NOT arranged in chronological order so here is a chronological listing:

01 Jaundice Brothers
02 Talon Show
03 Fear Squad
04 Substitute Creature
05 Party Planners
06 Blue Lagoona
07 Copy Canine
08 The Hot Boy
09 Bad Scare Day

5168814,5,B008KXLAUS,"I couldn't wait to see this movie, and I wasn't disappointed! Instead of it being centered around one ghoul, there are a lot of smaller storylines going on!  Cleo has family probs, Jackson has Holt probs... and for Monster High, Halloween is becoming one big big prob!  A must see!",1350518400,2,281,4.6

5168816,5,B008KXLAUS,Great movie for kids that even an adult can appreciate. Purchase originally for my 5 year old granddaughter yet both her Aunts (ages 33 and 19) ended up getting hooked. Highly recommend for all kids ages 5 though adult :),1350345600,2,221,4.55
5168817,3,B008KXLAUS,"I love MH and I've seen all of the T.V. specials they've aired in the past. I was super excited for a DVD release, but this isn't one of their better movies. It is super rushed and they tried to squeeze in too many side stories. It felt a little shallow and its a forgettable movie. The earlier movies were better such as Fright On!
That being said, it was still fun and I enjoyed watching it.",1350086400,,393,4.116883116883117
