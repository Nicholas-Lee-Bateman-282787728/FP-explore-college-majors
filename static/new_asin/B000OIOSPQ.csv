Her no-nonsense approach to gentle yet thorough exercise has proven excellent results in toning, conditioning, strengthening and increasing overall flexibility. These programs have the added benefit of eliminating muscular tension and neutralizing stress. This wonderful video contains two 15-minute programs designed to be performed sitting in a chair. It is ideal for those who are chair-bound as well as for those who need upper body exercise but don't enjoy getting down on the floor. The workouts are thorough yet gentle and deal specifically with the upper body. Due to the rich quality and variety of the exercises, you will conclude each session feeling revitalized and tension-free. ""She is not intimidating to beginning stretchers and has increased my motivation to continue exercising."" G.L., Elgin, IL.""",1339459200,,957,5.652777777777778
