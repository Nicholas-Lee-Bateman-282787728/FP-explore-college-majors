7868043,5,6304286988,Fantastic  workout! Came in a three VCR set along with with autonomy abs and autonomy stretch. On my opinion the best yoga video routine ever made. I wish they would either put it out in DVD format or upload to Youtube.,1428105600,,219,4.341463414634147
7868044,5,6304286988,"I had this on VHS and it was ruined by my VCR.  I was looking for this on DVD because I enjoyed the sequence and poses.  It has sun salutations followed by some strength poses, hip openers and other stretches.  Unfortunately, it doesn't appear to be on DVD and I am not buying a new VCR just so I can buy this tape again.  Hopefully, I can find a DVD with a similar set of sequences.",1213747200,,383,4.0
7868045,5,6304286988,This by far is the best yoga video I have tried.  It has me excited!  It is written and choreographed by Bryan Kest.  I look forward to trying his videos now.  40 min is prefect for me in the morning.,1101772800,,200,3.925
7868046,4,6304286988,"I have to say that the name ""CARDIO-YOGA"" may be somewhat misleading as it would make one think this is some sort of new fangled practice.. (Aparrently,what makes this yoga ""cardio"" is the fast pace at which the sun salutations are done and the push-up required before the downward dog)..I beleive all yoga is CARDIO as the sun salutations and warrior poses heat up the body,and the stretches afterward are the cooldown..However,this IS a decent tape,and NOT a rip-off..You will feel it afterwards..",1075680000,2,499,5.024096385542169
7868047,3,6304286988,"If you know what poses to do, then the video might be helpful- however, if you are even somewhat unfamiliar with the names of the poses, you are in trouble-- the poses themselves make it hard to see the TV for an  explanation of the pose, and they give little instruction.",958435200,7,272,4.333333333333333
7868048,4,6304286988,"This a great ""power yoga"" tape. In 45 minutes you work and stretch from head to toe.  Wears the brand of Bryan Kests' series (he created the program) this is perfect for days when time is short.",950140800,6,194,4.243243243243243
7868049,5,6304286988,"While I would agree with the person who said that this is not really a cardio workout, I will say it is excellent for flexibility and balance. I found it an excellent way to alleviate back problems. The total workout  from start to finish is 39 minutes (believe me I counted). I always feel as  if I have had a deep body message after it is over. This is what keeps me  coming back for more.",949276800,9,391,4.118421052631579
