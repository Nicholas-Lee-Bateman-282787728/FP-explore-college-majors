2906093,3,B000TK8NQO,Having just finished the MSF safety class I decided to buy the dvd in hoping to learn more info or techniques on motorcycle riding.  Unfortunately the dvd is very short (28 min.) with an additional 12 minutes showing other available dvd's.  Only buy this if you are considering riding a motorcycle for the first time because the information is very basic.  I feel that $20 is a bit much to pay for something worth about $10.,1265932800,17,424,4.552631578947368

His video's are always helpful for new and beginner riders!!",1264809600,2,120,5.05
2906095,5,B000TK8NQO,"I couldn't wait to get this video! As soon as it came I sat down and watched it. I took a 2 day riding course here in FL last summer in 90-100 degree heat...I fell the second day only three exercises prior to taking the motorcycle rider test (to get your license)...broke my toe/sprained my ankle...what a bust! I never got to take the test...and I spent a couple of hundred dollars for this course! Okay, I sobbing again. Back to the video....buy it, it's excellent...I will watch it many times. Just wish Jerry talked slower. You'll see what I mean. Buy it...it's worth it and they do most of the riding on these big bikes (I have a 600 Honda Shadow VLX/DLX....Hello?) & they manuever them like a Rebel 250! Wish I had a dvd on my bike so I could watch and practice at the same time! That's a NO NO! Jerry gives you a practice sheet of his exercises along with the video and my video came within a week. Nuff Said...watch and RIDE SAFE!",1214438400,18,938,4.275280898876405

2906162,4,B000TK8NQO,"Saw this video advertised and got it for a friend to review before taking his skills test.

The video is an excellent review of skills for a beginner and it is good for any rider to use for review.

I would actually like to see a longer version of this video.  The skill/drills during the last part of the DVD are all very well done.  It seemed to end abruptly and I was expecting more.",1372636800,,386,4.1066666666666665
2906163,5,B000TK8NQO,"Learn to ride the easy way is produced by Jerry ""Motorman"" Palladino, a veteran Police Motorcycle Officer who runs classes in Florida teaching the techniques that are used by motor officers worldwide. Classes are also run in many locations around the US and you will see the Ride Like a Pro team do demonstrations at many events around the country.

This dvd covers all of the motorcycle basics and is a valuable resource for anybody new to motorcycling. As well as covering basic riding techniques, road safety is also covered.

A must have resource for any new rider!",1348185600,2,569,4.795918367346939
2906164,5,B000TK8NQO,This is a very informative DVD.As a beginning rider I bought this dvd and have studied them thoroughly it improved my skills immensely. I lent my DVD to a long time rider.

8209892,2,B000TK8NQO,Disc did not play correctly and I kept having to restart it. Video is obviously formatted from a VHS tape so pic quality and sound suffer.  There were a couple good tips in it but I was disappointed in the program itself as well as the disc. Material was very dated.,1520294400,,266,4.215686274509804

8209895,1,B000TK8NQO,"Bought this DVD along with Surviving the Mean Streets and Ride Like a Pro. The problem was that this DVD won't play properly. It stops at some parts of the movie. At first, I thought it was just my DVD drive. I played the other two DVDs and found them okay. After some time I forgot about this DVD. When I got the chance to try it in another player, it still won't play. Apparently, the disc is defective, not my DVD player. Sadly, It's been some time since I bought this, so, I guess I have to live with it.",1462838400,,508,4.03960396039604
