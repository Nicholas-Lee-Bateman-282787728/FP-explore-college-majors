8754354,1,B01CYDKOP6,"Becareful ordering this if you do not live in the USA or Canada.  It won't work in your BluRay or DVD player. I did not know what Region 4 was and ordered this for my daughter.  Of course, when it arrived, she opened the seal and tried to play it and it did not work.  Amazon will not take it back if the seal is broken.  Lesson learned the hard and expensive way!",1475884800,,364,3.9452054794520546
