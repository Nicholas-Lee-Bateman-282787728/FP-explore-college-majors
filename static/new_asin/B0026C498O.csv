8352506,5,B0026C498O,This is one of the best DVD's I have seen in a long time.  Patsy sets the feathers out in a way to have fun and each plume doesn't have to be the same.  This way if your plume is slightly off it is okay. She shows each step in detain and you can stop the DVD and try that portion of the lesson.,1282694400,5,294,3.578125
