3778620,5,B001RTKKS0,"""Incendiary"" is not only a unique and wonderful story, its captivating!

I'm happy to see at least a few good reviews here, because the movie doesn't seem to be that well known, yet.

While on vacation this past week, I rented a slew of movies, ""Reservation Road"", ""Defiance"", ""He's Just Not That Into You"", ""Doubt"" along with ""Incendiary"". All those other movies were good, but they were exactly what I was expecting them to be. ""Incendiary"" was one of the last movies I watched and it turned out to be the best. In fact it was one of the best movies I've seen in awhile and I watch alot of movies.

I wasn't completely sold on Michele Willams, but Ewan McGregor drew me in and his role ended up being a rather small one. It's a great movie with alot of heart and raw emotion in it, Michelle Williams is the main focus of the movie and she doesn't disappoint.

This is another one of those movies that has a slow build up and it just keeps building up until the climax.

""Incendiary"" is based off the book by Chris Cleave, which was originally released right around or on the same day as the July 7th, 2005 London subway terrorist attacks.

3778621,4,B001RTKKS0,"INCENDIARY is not being treated well by critics and I don't really understand why.  They seem to keep talking aboutr what the film could be rather than what it is.  And what it is is a film that is intense, difficult to watch and emotionally raw.  But it is an excellent film.  The story takes place in London and we are introduced to Michelle Williams.  She is a wife and mother.  She has an adorable son who she adores and a husband with whom she tries to deal but who seems to be emotionally empty.  The one interesting thing here that is bizarre is that Michelle's character has no actual name.  Even in the credits she is listed as YOUNG MOTHER.  What purpose this serves I don't really know but I must admit I didn't really notice it when viewing the film.

Our story develops.  This young woman goes out to the bar occasionally at night and has the neighbor watch her child.  It is here she meets and sleeps with Ewan McGregor.  They start a sexual relationship and one weekend her husband takes the son to a soccer game.  This same day Michelle has sex with Ewan and the game is on during it.  There is a terrorist attack on the stadium and bombs explode.  The mother sees this on tv while being in the vulnerable sexual position.  She knows that her husband and son are at the game.  It is at this point that her world falls apart.  She goes to the stadium to try and find them and encounters hell on earth.

Critics seem to feel more should have been explained about the terrorism aspect but the fact that the country is a constant victim of these suicide bombers is a reality.  This film is about the emotional impact all this has on the young wife/mother played by Michelle Williams.  There is a lot of voiceover where she tells  part of the story and the rest is pure emotion.  Michelle Williams owns this films and displays 100% the acting chops that she possesses.  She becomes this woman so completely that every plot line and everything that happens to her is heartwrenchingly believable.  She falls apart, builds herself up for yet more downfalls.  Ewan Mcgregor and Matthew MacFayden provide excellent support here but this is truly Ms. Williams fim.

The journey she takes you on is spellbinding and any loose plot lines that may exist become nonexistent as you experience them with her.  Imagaine the pain and emotion involved with facing your worst fears and that is the ride Michelle Williams takes you on.  I fould the blu ray presentation to be glorious.  The 1080p video is electric and crisp with vibrant color and excellent flesh tones.  Blacks and whites blend for awesome contrast.  The audio is excellent.  It is a dialogue driven film but there are some strong audio moments like the stadium explosion and these scenes are bewidering to view.

I highly recommend this film and blu ray.  It is disturbing subject matter but tells an important tale on the effects terrorism can have on an average person.  And you will also get a tour de force performance by Michelle Williams.  She is proving to be one of our best actresses and this performance and film are not to be missed.",1244246400,3,3107,4.531531531531532

While her husband and young son are attending an Arsenal football game, they are killed when a series of terrorist bombs goes off.  Director Sharon Maguire juggles a number of plots -- the affair, the deaths of husband and child, the mother's frantic search for their bodies, her deep-seated guilt over the affair, and an unlikely relationship that develops after the bombing.

3778625,4,B001RTKKS0,"The Many Faces of Terrorism, May 24, 2009
By  Grady Harp (Los Angeles, CA United States) - See all my reviews

INCENDIARY comes as a surprise release on DVD: did it even have a theatrical release? Based on a book by Chris Cleave and adapted for the screen by director Sharon Maguire, this little film is notable on many levels. First, the story is another look at the topic of terrorism, revealing the effects of these senseless catastrophes much like America's 9/11 tragedy on all players - the survivors of the victims, the survivors of the perpetrators, and the way so much of life changes in the wake of explosive surprises and the strength to survive in the aftermath of these traumas.

A Young Mother (an astonishingly fine performance by Michelle Williams) opens the film with thoughts and demonstrations of the love she holds for her young son (Sidney Johnson) while she copes with the too frequent absences of her husband Lenny (Nicholas Gleaves): Lenny is part of London's Anti-terrorism division of the police force. The feeling of unfulfilled desires by this isolated young woman are magnified as she watches her newspaper reporter neighbor Jasper Black (Ewan McEwan) across the street escorting yet another tipsy dolly into his apartment. Lenny leaves, the mother lovingly puts her son to bed, then she goes out to a bar where she encounters none other than Jasper trying to tempt her to his lair. The needy mother submits to Jasper's intentions and in a brief moment of desire succumbs to her physical needs.

Another day passes and as Lenny and their son depart for the soccer game, the mother is again willingly seduced by Jasper, only to have their assignation interrupted by an explosion at the stadium where Lenny and her son are watching the game. The guilt-ridden adulterous mother flees to the stadium where she is injured attempting to find her family. Now hospitalized with injuries she faces visits from Jasper as well as from her husband's co-worker Terrance (Matthew Macfadyen). Once released form the hospital she discovers the withheld name and picture of one of the suicide bombers responsible for the attack and deaths - and she learns that the bomber was a suspect being watched by Terrance who could possibly have prevented her loss. She learns the name of the suicide bomber's family, meets the bomber's son (Usman Khokhar) and wife (Sasha Behar) and eventually allows herself to meet them. The consequences of all of this information and chance meetings and the afterburn of her association with Jasper and Terrance (both of whom profess love for her) make for a startling ending, but an ending that for once helps us understand the psychology of our current world of terrorism threat and the need to heal and move on.

The performances are excellent, with special attention paid to the gifts of Michelle Williams whose perfect British accent will be a surprise to most viewers: this is a career altering role for her. The film develops slowly, deals with a lot of internal dialog, but in the end the effect is one of powerful impact. Highly recommended. Grady Harp, May 09",1243123200,3,3108,4.878787878787879
3778626,1,B001RTKKS0,I kept waiting for this movie to take off but it never did. I finally launched it into the trash about 45 minutes in.,1242777600,5,117,3.9166666666666665
3778627,3,B001RTKKS0,"I hate to admit I was tricked into ordering as many as I did because of the description, trailer and preliminary ""thriller"" reviews. I'll make this a two part review to be as fair as possible, one part on the mis-marketing and the other on the Blu-Ray product (small spoilers).

The story covers loads of grief, emotions and loss as a woman (Michelle Williams) loses her son and husband in a major terrorist explosion in London. Coincidentally, she is having a tryst (with Ewan McGregor) whilst her family is killed. With extensive flashbacks of her son, coupled together with three other distinct story lines, we get spattered with some bad writing and abbreviated conclusions.

Marketing: The trailer shows the only 80 seconds of activity in the whole film (outside of the sex scene). Case description: ""...and discovers the authorities will do anything to cover up the terrifying truth behind it."" Once you watch the film you realize how incorrect that statement is. Between being pushed as a thriller and my customers thinking it would be a conspiracy/semi-action film, I think one's expectations should be a little different as to alleviate any disappointment. There is lots of melancholy, sadness, beach footage, regret and a 1000 memorial blimps - not much else.

The Blu looked crisp, but very little color gets used. The clarity did show a variety of errors, including blatant crew reflections in vehicles (not brief either) and the CGI failings during the one stadium sequence. The DTS gets used best during the explosion sequence but not much else except some classical music mix. No extras to speak of, except a brief photo gallery of cast and crew.

There are both adequate and poor/minimal performances, a somewhat graphic sex scene that gets spoiled, and numerous shortcomings in the story that detract from what sounded like an excellent book. I would recommend it as a rental, maybe an owner for those Michelle fans, but overall this did little as a Blu product.",1241049600,15,1979,4.969788519637462
3778648,3,B001RTKKS0,Got this movie because I had read the book.  It is a different kind of story and one which took a lot of imagination to write.  The film is not so good.,1388448000,,152,3.71875
3778649,1,B001RTKKS0,"This is a very depressing movie, so wait until you're having an awesome, happy week before watching it.  Not a good one to see if you have kids either; you'll cry throughout - including the gross affair scenes; it was bad. The characters/storyline made it difficult to believe.  And then to have Matthew Macfadyen playing the role of a loser who likes a trashy girl.....  I couldn't watch. He's too good to play that part.",1382140800,2,422,4.6
3778650,3,B001RTKKS0,"911 was a true game-changer in the U.S. It was an iconic horror that will remain in the consciousness of anyone who experienced it from any distance. This movie aims for that same nerve but it just doesn't come off.

Here's the scoop. (Some Spoilers Here) Young Mother (Michelle Williams) is married to a guy who diffuses bombs. They have a 4 year old boy. She's having an affair with reporter Jasper Black (Ewan McGregor). Dad and son get killed in a terrorist bombing at a soccer game. Black figures something is fishy about the bombing. Young Mother starts up a friendship with the son of one of the bombers.

So what's this supposed to be about. Part of it is the mourning we experience as a people when something horrible like this happens. Then there's McGregor uncovering a conspiracy. Then there's Young Mother and her friendship with the terrorist's son. This movie is all over the place. The pieces just don't fit together. And when you head off down one path you're forced into a whiplash turn down another so the movie can't gain any momentum. The one thread that is at least fairly consistent is Young Mother's mentally writing a letter to Osama Bin Laden about what he hath wrought upon the British people. Williams has done better in other movies and McGregor has as well. There are no bad performances here, but nothing sticks out as being really good either. This is just an unfocused, so-so effort.

3778671,5,B001RTKKS0,"In 2005, Chris Cleave wrote a novel INCENDIARY about a distraught woman who writes a letter to Osama bin Laden after her four-year-old son and her husband are killed in a massive suicide bomb attack at a soccer match in London. The novel won the 2006 Somerset Maugham Award, was shortlisted for the 2006 Commonwealth Writers Prize, won the United States Book-of-the-Month Club's First Fiction award 2005 and won the Prix Spcial du Jury at the French Prix des Lecteurs 2007.

Three years later Director Sharon Maguire, in her first movie since 2001's Bridget Jones' Diary, made this film of Cleave's book.  Michelle Williams portrays the grieving mother. Ewan McGregor and Matthew MacFadyen star as men who try to console her.  (McGregor's character at the time of the bombing was sharing an ""afternoon delight"" with her on the living room sofa.)

Williams portrayal is masterful as she relives her son's short life in vivid happy snippets. She is not guilt-ridden nor revenge-seeking. She befriends the son of the bomber and his mother not for revenge but in empathy.  The photography of the beach scenes of mother and son at play and the imaginery blimp are stunning.  And the ending of the movie will haunt you for days.

Generally, the film received poor professional reviews from critics.  Apparently a theme of a simple western woman who empathizes with a third world terrorist's family is too strange to grasp.  Tom Charity, after viewing the film at the 2008 Sundance Film Festival, gave it one star out of five and called it an ""ambitious/opportunistic effort that misses the mark, from the one-dimensional characters to the craven plotting and sentimental tone.""

Time Out gave it two stars out of six, saying ""there are so many things wrong with writer-director Sharon Maguire's film... that it's hard to know where to start, but the fatal problem is that this is a film with an 'identity crisis'; the film at times seems like a 'study of guilt and grief' and at other times a 'conspiracy thriller' but ends up being a compendium of bizarre diversions, most of which are utterly surplus to the film's half-cocked desire to stick with the experience and emotions of its main character.""  The male reviewer for Time Out apparently was bent-out-of shape that an American actress was selected to portray a ""nervy young British mother on a London council estate"" calling the casting a joke.

Neither of these male film critics considered the film a character study nor noted Michelle Williams' stellar performance. She was in almost every scene!

(At the time of this review...Michelle Williams has been nominated for a 2012 Golden Globe for her performance in My Week with Marilyn.  Bet the family fortune she will win if she transforms herself into her character as she does in INCENDIARY!)",1324857600,,2797,4.936034115138593

The three main characters (loose woman, sleazy reporter, policeman) are all worthless human beings - pure anti-heroes, that we are supposed to feel empathy for. Right? Wrong! What's more I found much of the film disorientating and confusing. I've heard the book is better (well, it can't be worse) which is why I think the movie was so confusing in parts - I mean, is the son there or not? It is a dream or are we in the woman's head? Yeah, I get the message - terrorism is nasty and it ruins lives, but terrorists are also people with thoughts and motivations.

Ewan McGregor plays Jasper Black, a rich newspaper reporter who has an affair with her.

The British film is part character study, part mystery and part introspective drama, and succeeds as none. Not to spoil the film's ""surprises,"" I can say it is an overtly melodramatic tale told against the background of very immediate political issues. ""Incendiary"" doesn't know subtlety. With too many voiceovers that never end, and a graphic sex scene that looks out of place, the unfocused film doesn't know what it wants to do.

Michelle Williams (she is top-billed) shows what a talented player can do, as a mother with unresolved grief over her loved ones (and guilt for sleeping with another man). Without her superb acting the film would have been a total mess. Ewan McGregor is underused, and so is Matthew Macfadyen Terrance Butcher in charge of the anti-terrorism division. Their underwritten characters add very little to the half-baked script.

The 2008 British film, based on a 2005 book of the same title by Chris Cleave, is written and directed by Sharon Maguire, better known as the helmer of ""Bridget Jones's Diary"" (2001).

I found these differences made the original story almost irrelevant to the tale being told in the movie. The story of personal grief told in the film could easily have been accomplished by way of an original screenplay, without adapting the book at all.

Michelle Williams is outstanding in this film, easily the best thing about it. Her accent is very convincing and more that once I got teary watching her performance. The scene where Ewan McGregor's character Jasper visits her in the hospital was particularly moving. McGregor is very good too but I felt his character was sidelined about halfway through and by the end was largely irrelevant.

As for the direction, I thought it at times was too sentimental. For example, the flashbacks of her son on the beach were used far too much. I felt as though I was being clobbered and at one point I said out loud, 'Yes, I get it! Give it a rest!'. I also found the overuse of sentimental music during these scenes irritating. I think this is because I was expecting a different story - i.e. the book.

Plot summaries abound in other reviews so I won't take the time for that. Apparently the trailer is wildly off the mark, leading one to expect an action-packed, suspenseful government cover-up -- that is unfortunate, and I am very glad I never saw a trailer.  Michelle Williams was wonderful as the grieving mother -- I cannot understand reviewers who have panned her, I thought she was really very good.  Ewan McGreggor was fine, though his character really took a back seat (Jasper Black is a COMPLETELY different person in the book) but the movie wasn't really about him, it was about the mother and her grief.  The 11-year-old boy subplot which was added I thought contributed nicely to what this movie was trying to convey -- purists hoping for a good novel-to-screen transfer will disagree, but those scenes with the boy really enriched the movie.

I would definitely recommend the book -- there is a lot of black humor in the book which the scriptwriter did away with altogether -- just don't expect the book to be like the movie!",1277337600,2,1427,4.5984251968503935

It is a heartbreaking story about human nature, mother's love for child and need to love and be loved.  I adored this film.",1275782400,2,1225,4.726415094339623
3778681,3,B001RTKKS0,"This film is based loosely on the novel Incendiary by Chris Cleave. The film is well done but not great. The book is able to explore class conflicts and is full of dark humor whereas the film emphasizes the romantic quest of Jasper Black and Terrance Butcher for the heroine's affections.  Michelle Williams displays her considerable acting talents as a mother and wife who loses both her husband and child in a terrorist bombing in London. But we see that it was not a totally satisfying marriage since her husband is emotionally distant from her. Her husband works on the police bomb squad and is a bomb himself since he is emotionally suppressed and non-communicative with his wife, leaving her in a state of anxiety that she finds can be relieved by sexual trysts with men she meets in local pubs.  It is the loss of her child that is defeating her, destroying her emotional balance, and Williams plays the part very well. But as she recovers two very different men begin to court her, even though she continually has flashbacks of the bombing and thus spends much time and energy trying to stop both men from becoming attached to her. She meets a smooth operator in Jasper Black, a newspaper editorial writer. She is also courted by Terrance Butcher, her husband's supervisor's supervisor in the police department and the head of anti-terrorism efforts.  The film gives us several references to the great fire in London and to the bombings during World War II. The character played by Michelle Williams is very resilient, even exploring the family of one of the terrorist and empathizing with the 10 year old son of the terrorist. Parallel to the theme of terrorism is a romantic theme of two men trying to court the same woman and the stakes get pretty nasty. Despite the terror the film would indicate that live goes on, that people remain wounded but functional and even can grow to love again. The character played by Michelle Williams eventually displays this resiliency with her final lines in the film where she says: ""Come to be Osama. Come to me and we will blow the world back together WITH INCREDIBLE NOISE AND FURY.""",1269043200,3,2133,4.728494623655914
3778682,1,B001RTKKS0,"I saw incendiary after I was unable to view it in theaters, I was going to buy the film without viewing it however, I decided to rent it before and the movie was a bit of a disappointment it is boring and long, and the ending is a bit unclear. Then I decided to read the book that had been sitting on my bookshelf for a while. And I am happy I did the adapted film is joke compared to the book which is creative and original plus many parts in the film are not in the book and the characters are poorly adapted. Their is too much to even mention that is not in the movie, and the sequence where Michelle Williams stalks the boy who is the son of one of the terrorist is not a major part or even part of the book. I would suggest buying the book instead of the film, which spends too much time on politics instead of the books creativity and interesting characters. One the poor examples of adaptation is in the film it looks like she does not love her husband but in the book she does. whats the point of that?<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Incendiary-A-Novel/dp/1439157170/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Incendiary: A Novel</a>",1268352000,3,1163,4.650485436893204
3778683,1,B001RTKKS0,"The plot itself was a good one, and one that is told almost all the time, but absolutely predictable.  If the writer was trying to elicit compassion, I'm not sure who it would have been geared towards. If anger and disgust was to be drawn from the audience, I believe a small amount of anger would be the word to describe how I felt about the loose change I spent on this video.  I would have been happier with an expensive cup of coffee.

Disgust would be the description on what a horrible actress Michelle Williams was.  This role was not for her.  If people think it was, then she needed to practice/rehearse it better.  Or perhaps the writer needed to perfect the role made for mother's having affairs acting slutty with the strange good looking man whore down the street while her son and husband attended a ball game.

#1  The trailer suggests a movie that is at least action-y.  It is anything but.  The story starts in the head, stays in the head, and ends in the crazy, moronic and infuriatingly morally equivocating head of the main character.

#2  It made no #@$! sense.

#3  I paid hard-earned money for this excrement-stained drivel.

#4  I could have spent this time doing something fun and interesting like clipping my toenails, or perhaps even trimming my cat's nosehair.

3778686,5,B001RTKKS0,"Incendiary features a stunning performance by Michelle Williams, on a level with the likes of Meryl Streep, Cate Blanchet, etc.  Williams portrays a young woman from the East End of London (apparently a working class neighborhood.)  Her husband and 4 yr old son are killed in a suicide bombing that happens during a soccer game, claiming the lives of over 1,000 people.

Ironically, her husband is a member of the police force bomb squad.  Tragically, her son is an exceptionally bright and loving boy, also wonderfully played by Sidney Johnston.  The relationship between mother and son is extremely touching, and the loss of her child is heart-breaking.  The loss of the husband (who had plenty of affection for his son and none for his wife) cannot compare.

To complicate matters, at the very moment the bombing occurs, the mother is having sex with a friend/neighbor, a journalist (Ewan McGregor) who ends up investigating one of the bombers.

In this post 9/11 decade with the supposed ""war on terror"" casting suspicions and bigotry right and left, the actions of Williams' character are amazing.  She locates the widow of the bomber, and meets and befriends the bomber's son, who still believes his father is alive.  Her courage and humanity know no bounds, especially as demonstrated in the letter she writes to Osama bin Laden (an exercise recommended by her grief therapy counselor.)

A touching film worth seeing, especially for the unexpectedly amazing talent of Michelle Williams.  5 stars for her, 4+ for the film",1251676800,2,1527,5.015873015873016
