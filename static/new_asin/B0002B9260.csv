8091653,4,B0002B9260,"I'm not sure what film the previous reviewers were watching but this is not a instructual sword play movie its a good old school fight film, no usual ploy just plain old martial arts. The scenes were good David Chaing performed well Pao Pao had a small part in this film both he and David are renow Shaw Brothers actors, I liked the movie far from a classic but not bad either.",1395100800,2,377,4.25
8091654,4,B0002B9260,"I gave this video a 4/5 because there was too much talking, and not enough technique, displays, and action in general.  Don't get me wrong its very informative, talks very in depth about several issues that sword buyers and  owners alike may find useful.",961372800,2,254,4.75
8091655,3,B0002B9260,"This video contained a fair amount of information on full tang, and half tang samurai swords.  Its fairly indepth.  Its definately worth the... bucks you'll shell out for it.  So give it a try if your into a pretty good sword documentary.",961372800,,238,4.619047619047619
