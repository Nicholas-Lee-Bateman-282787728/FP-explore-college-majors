8583630,5,B00CMWQ4MW,"I have used Jennifer's Pilates-4-Pain Management and enjoyed it.  As an active 73 year old I find that this new video can ""kick it up a notch"" for me.  Jennifer's precise instructions are very clear and help me to move on to the next level.  Although I am not at the advanced level available, I am working my way toward that and hope to continue to improve with continued practice.  This gives me additional levels to achieve and goals toward which I can aim.
Great video! Thank you.

8583631,5,B00CMWQ4MW,"This video is in an instructional format and really geared towards the serious pilates students and also instructors. Jennifer gives move by move instructions on how to breathe and where to place hands, feet, etc. She precisely describes each movement and exercise so if you are training to be an instructor you'd benefit from this video. Jennifer is trained in STOTT Pilates, had a private studio in LA for over 10 years, and follows the routines perfectly.  If you are a middle to advanced student - you will be challenged trying to keep up with this routine. This video is not for beginners that are new to pilates - you will not be able to keep up.

Beginners should check out her ""Pilates-4-Pain Management"" video for a much easier and fun paced pilates mat and stretching session.",1373673600,,786,4.7299270072992705
