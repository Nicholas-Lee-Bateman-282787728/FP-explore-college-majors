8191033,5,B000PFUA1O,"Kinda funny all the little items that I seemed to recall from this intersting little movie, made years ago, and yet, it was a real stroll down memory lane when I slipped the DVD into the player, sat back and watched.  Couldn't believe I remember some details from this movie better than other action flicks of the same general time period!  The one person I had forgotten about, until seeing his face was Eddie Velez (playing the terrorist in this movie).

Yea, I gave it a ""5"" more for some selfish ""bring back memories"" thrills, but it was a blast then, and now!",1238198400,2,564,4.456310679611651
8191034,5,B000PFUA1O,"I first saw this movie on NBC as a ""Special"" and enjoyed this as the actors and scenes were taken in the U.S. and countries named in the movie for realism. The movie is basically about a known terrorist known as ""Carlos"",The movie makes referals to the infamous Carlos the Jackal. A famed terrorist who worked for anybody who had the money and who would pay. A Movie with Excitement, Adventure and mystery. The story was written by famed novelist Gerald Petievich, a former U.S. Secret Service agent and legend in the field of crime and political thriller fiction. He has written many books and one of his Latest books and New Movie is and my favorite ""The Sentinel"" another movie also is ""Python Wolf"" with the same characters that were in ""Cat Squad""",1205280000,2,752,4.619402985074627
8191035,3,B000PFUA1O,"I saw this movie while riding on a bus from Puerto Vallarta to Tepic in central Mexico.  For 80's made for tv anti-terrorism drama, it's not too bad.  It holds up better over time than its contemporary, Airwolf.  The only point of interest of this movie is that the guy who plays Josh Lyman on West Wing appears in it.  I can't imagine why he leaves this off his bio on the NBC website.  Next time you see him, be sure to go ""Hey, it's that guy from C.A.T. Squad!""  Then plead ignorance if he mentions his other work.",1052956800,,517,4.171717171717172
