5374808,2,B00A144O4S,"This movie was absolutely terrible.
My credibility: I have seen just about every martial arts movie ever created. From Bruce Lee to Donny Yen, from Korea to Thai to China to Japan. So I know a good martial arts movie when I see one.

This movies has many minuses:
1. They over did the slow motion effects. We all love a good slo-mo to enjoy the full quality of the power of a strike or speed of a run, but every single punch in this movie was done in extra slo-mo which shows that none of these actors can actually fight. They compensate their lameness with this... A LOT.
2. They over did the Shaolin Martial Art skills. It seemed that these kids, having learnt martial arts from a young age, suddenly became mega-ultra masters of the trade and with one single touch, can disable a full grown man. It is too comical and unbelievable to be taken seriously.
3. Cheesy comedy. This movie has a lot of Asian slap-stick, which is sort of funny in Thai movies when done right, but defintely not in this one. The comedy is waaayy to cheesy.

One thing this movie has done right: The male leads are pretty hot (even the slow boy) but even that could not compensate for the horrible horrible acting, plot, and fighting this movie carries.

I cant believe they put money into something like this. Even Sesame Street can do better.",1361577600,2,1321,4.42798353909465

5374811,4,B00A144O4S,I choose this rating because I liked the movie. The weak coming back to take revenge on the people that bullied them when they were young and help other young people that are being bullied.

5374813,3,B00A144O4S,"Having just finished watching this movie I now know why I picked it up for so cheap.  Don't get me wrong, there are some scenes in this film that are fairly entertaining and some of the fight scenes are fun to watch, BUT....well the film taken as a whole just didn't seem to work.  It is almost like the director couldn't remember what the plot of the movie was as it was being made, it comes across as a hodgepodge collections of scenes that are only loosly associated.  Even the supposed epic showdowns throughout the film that are supposed to be big revenge fights kinda come out of nowhere and dissapate just a awkwardly.  There are multiple times in the movie where I found myself wondering why the characters whouldn't use the special moves that they displayed earlier in the film in the situations they get stuck in?  It is like one minute the are able to drop people with no effort then they end up standing there helpless in the next scene.... This film will leave you less than satisfied and even though it does resolve some plot points throughout, the manner in which it unfolds just makes you not care about it anymore.  If they could have just edited out the cheasy and unnessasary parts they would have had a more streamlined film...but it would have been only about 15min long.",1396483200,,1292,4.523605150214593

5374820,2,B00A144O4S,"Why did I choose this rating?

I wouldn't consider myself a connoisseur of fine wine, but when I drink boxed wine my expectations match. That said, I can tell when I ask for Franzia and instead receive a slurry of sediment and clay dumped into a mug. Reading the title of the movie ""Bangkok Assassins"" I expected Chow Yun Fat, Hard Boiled type action. Instead, I got a confused movie that was neither action, nor love story, nor really anything in between. Returning to my first analogy, I feel like I got cat litter with odor crystals shoved down my throat. It's one of the few movies where I debated for the entire last half whether or not to keep sticking through it just as a test of my patience and resolve.

Where to begin... This is not a kung-fu movie. It is not an assassin movie. It isn't really much of an action movie. Unless you consider slapping each other like 3 year old girls action. And you know, if it were Jackie Chan slapping his enemies into submission, it would still be pretty legitimate. Instead, you get three Asian boy-bandish actors with zero martial arts skills throwing Street Fighter type Hadouken! type gestures and CG doing most of the work.

The story is kind of silly. Not that this genre is known for deep plot - but it's hard to get into. There are a few different stories playing out. 1) Revenge for the child abuser/abductors who made the protagonists blind, deaf, and mute; 2) Avenging the death of their master and mentally challenged friend; 3) A teenage love story; 4) A son trying to find his mother... It feels like it focuses a lot on number 3 and poorly. I feel like the story writer suffers from ADHD and can't stick to one idea for too long or treat it in a meaningful way.

There are a couple favorite moments in this movie:

The first is when the bad white guy sends his ""monkey"" ninjas out to kill the master. Something like, ""he has the dragon tears... monkeys, go!"" Then we see a shot of these monkey ninjas backflipping all the way down the hall to their exit. I mean come on guys, this is not really a great way to expend energy. Just walk. Or run.

The second is when he resends the monkey ninjas out to kill the kids. He says something like, ""monkeys, go!"" Then the monkey ninjas backflip and cartwheel their way down the hall toward their exit but THIS time, the left monkey ninja flips over a picnic table that happened to intercept his backflipping escape route.

The third scene is when one of the characters reunites with his mother. Except it's the face of the mother's daughter that totally kills me. Basically, the son slept with his sister... but it's okay! Because she's... adopted! But he's going to live with them from now on because that isn't weird or anything. But yeah, the daughter's face in all this is the best. It basically expresses ""oh my God, this wasn't in the script... you've got to be kidding me..."" kind of confusion and horror.

There are some weird things I thought was pretty funny as well:

For example, they introduce the female lead's best friend character who is not as pretty and pretty much I thought the entire purpose of her character was get with the nerdy male extra who has an infatuation with the female lead... but then she does nothing. Doesn't even hook up with him at the end. As a matter of fact, she happens to get stuck at the temple when the assassins attack the master, but she is conveniently no where to be found only making an appearance at the end like she was there the whole time.

The one ""moral"" character who doesn't share the revenge blood lust that the other ones do, in the end kills a crime boss by poking his eyes out, absolutely negating the character's core compass. But it's okay, because he's going to get with the female protagonist (who loved some other character the whole movie) in the end and that's going to right his compass again.

The female character is totally useless. She knows some CG kung-fu (she can levitate) but she's gives ZERO effort during the movie. I'm not even sure she tries to run away from the bad guys she's so easily caught. I think she may be some pop star whose sole purpose was to be cast as the name brand asset to draw in certain audiences. The males of this movie also kind of have that aura.

Sometimes the movie tries to be serious and sometimes campy - and that was confusing. Like, when the mentally challenged kid gets accidentally stabbed by a poison dart, you know - the innocent bystander thing... usually you give the bystander some dignity like, having the dart graze the victim or wound him in the gut, somewhere where it's like, ""oh my gosh... I'm hurt..."" [disbelief, falls]. Instead, he waddles over to his master, ""Master! That was ama.. zing..."" then he collapses with this dart sticking out of his FOREHEAD. I couldn't stop laughing.

Anyway, there are a bunch of these throughout the film. It would make for a good MST3000 episode if it were science fiction.

I guess I recommend this product to people who like scrawny asian boy band boys with some shirtless scenes. And anyone else who wants to watch it with a group of friends and rip into it throughout the showing. There are many hidden gems that can be torn apart for laughs. It's the kind of movie that the peanut gallery enhances.",1388188800,,5269,4.48643006263048

5374825,4,B00A144O4S,This was a fun movie.  I was not looking for intense character development.  It was a classic good guy vs bad.

5374827,3,B00A144O4S,"As one reviewer already noted, there's no actual martial arts. It's all magic. The plot isn't really ever explained.

Some odd things: The box of marbles just appears in Gorya's hands on more than one occasion. When she's carrying a purse it makes sense, but the other times the viewer is left wondering ""where did she hid that box?"" Another thing, the temple fight scene, I get that the white guys were supposed to look like tourists, but where did their cameras go. More than one of them is carrying a camera, and then it's just gone. Did they get actual tourists to do the scene?

Cheesy to the extreme.",1383091200,,606,4.5

8545947,2,B00A144O4S,"I was expecting lots of intricately choreographed action (because its alternative title is Bangkok Kung Fu), and characters that really helped to drive the themes of the film. Nope, I got none of those things from this awfully structured movie. The acting is horrible, the dialogue is often laughable (not-on-purpose laughable), and more importantly, there's very little direction or thought put into most of the film.

I don't have so much of a problem with the special effects (considering the budget of the film) or the premise of a Shaolin Kung Fu master training abused children. In fact, I found that premise to be quite promising, since it could have opened so many doors for character studies and showing the inner conflict between respecting Shaolin ideology and the human need for vengeance - you know, something that could have redeemed everything else in the film! That's what it promised for the start of the movie, but then it miraculously screws up. For one thing, the acting is pretty stiff and nonexistent in this movie. I'm not sure if the poor dialogue is making the acting bad, or the bad acting is making the dialogue poor, but once the film ends, you just decide that it's both.

It makes such a sloppy attempt at giving these characters some depth and sense of brotherhood as they avenge their fallen master. No, I wasn't expecting an Oscar-caliber script or acting, but even compared to typical action movies, the attempt is still terrible. Consider this: once the plot fast forwards after the Shaolin master saves the tortured children from abductors, we notice an interwoven subplot of this teenage love triangle between the now trained martial artists. Not only is this subplot completely unnecessary and brainless, but to make this even more insulting, the movie still continues to plug in this melodrama literally only a few moments after their master has been killed! What was supposed to be the focus of the movie gets so abruptly and awkwardly pushed aside for something writer/director Yuthlert Sippapak thought would work. As a result, the film also drifts off for long periods of time. So by the time this subplot comes into play, you begin to realize there was very little effort put into piecing together this movie, regardless of what demographic they were trying to appeal to.

The fight scenes are mostly uninspiring, plain and simple. As I mentioned before, the film's special effects quality isn't that big of an issue, but the fact that it's not being complemented by anything remotely resembling thought-out choreography is the problem. In many scenes, it almost feels like the director just told the actors to improvise some fight moves while the camera rolls, and that made the final cut. And for the few moments that do contain some sort of impressive martial arts display, you realize you might have seen the same fight moves in many other martial arts movies before it. That's a small note for those expecting something original in this film.

To its credit, the film does make use of its Thai backdrop, allowing for its diverse filming locations to give the movie its intended Southeast Asian setting. In addition, the people who put together Bangkok Assassin did make a bold move in wanting to depict Thailand's national issue of child abductions. The inclusion of deaf, blind, and mentally disabled main characters wasn't as exploitative as I'd thought it would be. As viewers, we actually see how they became that way in the film's prologue, and that gave us some sort of discernible reason to care about what happens to them next.

Perhaps that's why I'm extremely disappointed with the film. It started promisingly well, and it gave the sense that it could deliver a strong emotional purpose equally matched by its action and exposition. Once the main characters are shown as teenagers, it felt like not much more effort was given afterwards to any aspect of the film. The characters get caught up in horribly scripted melodrama, and too often the director seems to forget where he's going with the flick. There wasn't any redeeming qualities that would make me call this even an OK film. For those with Amazon Prime, you can see this film for yourself, but don't go in expecting much from it. Because you will when it starts off.",1402444800,,4285,4.888583218707015
