The songs are great but then there is Harry.  I found him to be a sexist.  I mean who in the world says the person's full name when they are talking to them?  He called Susy by her first name but all the characters, including Susy, had to use his full name.  Common Harry!  The other DVDs I found are really educational.  A lot of repetition and it was all in Spanish with great subtitles.  Susy had a great way of getting you to speak and sing with her.  In this last one there is little repetition (except for the songs) and then there is Harry with a horrendous American accent.  Thank goodness he did not sing.  Please go back to the old format, Susy.  It works.

My 2 year old granddaughter really loves the first two but is not that crazy about this one.  Go figure.  If Susy makes another one with Harry, I will not buy it.  The only thing I can think of is that he was the one that put the money up.  Why else would Susy pick such an obnoxious person to partner with.",1339977600,,1148,4.026666666666666
