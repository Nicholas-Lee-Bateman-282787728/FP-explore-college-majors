8240139,5,B00113F096,"The University of Groningen (the Netherlands) thought so much of this topic that they created a dvd of some interviews, actual performances through some of the years (how did they get some of that stuff?), mainly 60's & 70's and pieces of a movie in which the Don Cossack Chorus was featured.
Considering the age of the materials, I'm pleased and very surprised at the quality of the audio/video materials. The production of this work was well coordinated and edited. Truly a work of passion and a yen to learn.
So, for those of you who have any connections from the past to this phenomenon it's a must see/must own dvd! Not likely to ever get to your local library.
So very glad I have my copy of this great work.",1370649600,,714,4.458015267175573
