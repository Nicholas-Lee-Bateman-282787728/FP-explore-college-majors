2818176,5,B000PFUANC,"While all the seasons of The Incredible Hulk had its share of good and great eppys, season 2 was arguably the strongest of all of them with the classics ""Married"" and ""Mystery Man"" as well as good episodes like ""A Child In Need,"" ""The Antowuk Horror"", ""Rainbow's End"" and ""Another Path.""

Here is what you'll see:

Disc 1

Married - One of the legendary episodes from the whole series. Here we see Dr. Banner travel to Hawaii to consult Dr. Carolyn Fields about his condition. The relationship turns from doctor/patient into love but ends in tragedy in this gripping two hour episode! Bonus commentary that was originally featured on this eppy by Kenneth Johnson on the ""The Incredible Hulk: Original Television Movie"" is also on this release.

The Antowuk Horror - After an encounter with The Hulk, a local resident create their own ""Hulk"" to try to increase the tourist dollars.

Ricky - A mentally challenged young man is duped into driving a defective car in a demolition derby.

Disc 2

Rainbow's End - Seeing how a special indian compound worked to calm a wild horse, Dr. Banner seeks the remedy for his own terrible condition. He also must prevent the murder of this same horse.

A Child In Need - While working as a gardner, David runs across an abused child. While trying to investigate this, he tangles with the child's father. The Hulk dishes his own lesson to the abusive parent.

Another Path - While traveling, David meets Li Song, a blind martial artist that suggests his own techniques may be the path to controling The Hulk.

Alice In Disco Land - Dr. Banner encounters a child from his past (who is now an adult) with a drinking problem.

Killer Instinct - David befriends a football player named Johnny whose own aggression is out of control both on and off the football field.

Disc Three

Stop The Presses - A young reporter uses questionable means to gain a story on a local restaurant. David goes to stop the story because one of the pictures has a clear shot of him and could expose him!

Escape From Los Santos - While traveling west, David is framed as an accomplice with a woman (who is also innocent) for the murder of her own husband!

Wildfire - A saboteur tries to stop drilling on an oil site until The Hulk intervenes.

A Solitary Place - David goes to Mexico to find solitude in order to avoid changing into his green alter-ego. Unfortunately, trouble finds him as a fellow doctor seeks her own refuge.

Like A Brother - A battle between a local preacher and a drug dealer brings The Hulk into the fray! I personally call this one ""Hulk In Da Hood!"" LOL!

Disc Four

The Haunted - While working as a moving man, David finds a young woman haunted by a childhood tragedy.

Mystery Man, Pt. 1 - In this legendary two-parter, David suffers a bout of amnesia due to a car accident as well as facial burns. His only link to his memory lies with his enemy Jack McGee!

Mystery Man, Pt. 2 - While traveling to Los Angeles, David and Jack's plane crashes down in the wilderness and the two men are fighting both nature and a forrest fire! Also, McGee gains a huge clue into the identity of The Hulk!

The Disciple - In a follow up to ""Another Path,"" David returns to an ailing Li Sung and helps a police officer see the blind man's wisdom. The officer is played by 80's rock star Rick Springfield.

No Escape - The Hulk accidentally helps a deranged man escape custody. Now, he must correct his error.

Disc Five

Kindred Spirits - David hooks up with an expedition that may hold a clue in how to control or cure his transformations. Guest stars a young Kim Catrell (long before her Sex And The City days).

The Confession - A lonely man, after an encounter with The Hulk, claims to be the creature's alter-ego!

The Quiet Room - David encounters a doctor who uses mind control to control his patients.

Vendetta Road - A young couple tries to bring down an oil company they believe was responsible for a loved one's death.

Bonus Episode:
Homecoming - In a taste of Season 3, we see David revealing to his father and sister that he is in fact alive! Meanwhile, a local tycoon wants David's dad to give up his land so he can build and will do anything (including murder) to see it happen. Another pivitol and legendary show from the series.

Overall, a very good purchase!",1184544000,18,4297,4.5

2818180,5,B000PFUANC,"While season one of The Incredible Hulk was rushed by CBS and at times stumbled in trying to find its groove, season two establishes a formula that remains constant for the duration of season two's 22 episodes.
 Gone are the days of Banner getting his butt kicked, or being tied up and thrown into a pit, or combine, or wrestling cage. Instead, Banner's life is threatened maybe once or twice this season, and the majority of these episodes deal with Banner helping someone in peril: a woman with a debilitaing illness (Married), an alcoholic (Alice in Disco Land), and a derranged writer (No Escape).

While most of the episodes end with The Hulk exacting revenge on several of his tormentors,  ""A Child In Need"" focuses on one individual whom The Hulk teaches quite a lesson. An episode leftover from season one, ""A Child in Need"" was almost not aired by CBS at the time due to its rather sensitive content (child abuse). In the end, The Hulk gives the episode's antagonist a taste of his own medicine.  No multiple bad guys, no police, just The Hulk and his adversary mono y mono. The end result is perhaps the most powerful scene in the entire five year run of the show that still strikes an emotional cord 30 years later.

  The only real less than stellar episodes for the season are ""Wildfire,"" ""A Solitary Place,""  and the season finale ""Vendetta Road.""  By the end of this season, The Hulk's TV popularity was unquestionable. Although there are some exceptional episodes from seasons three and four, this was as good as The Hulk would get as far as overall season quality goes. For the 1979-80 season, the writers began to tinker with the formula, and the results were sometimes less than spectacular.",1179100800,13,1710,4.6923076923076925
2818181,5,B000PFUANC,"I loved watching the Incredible Hulk when I was a kid, and it is awesome that the complete seasons are now being made available.  It was worth the wait, and I hope that future seasons will be released sooner.",1177804800,5,208,4.333333333333333
2818182,5,B000PFUANC,"Second Season is argubly the strongest.  The episodes deal with social issues such as terminal illness, mental illness, alcohol, child abuse, and race.  Some of best episodes from season two are A Child In Need, Alice In Discoland, Killer Instinct, The Haunted, Married and Mystery Man.

I look forward to the release of this in July.",1177545600,5,334,4.928571428571429
2818183,5,B000PFUANC,"Incredible Hulk season 2 is best Hulk season ever , in my opinion. Yes, season 1 had two part pilot movie and many classic episodes. (Hulk breaks Las Vegas is my personal favorite) Season 3 is another great season but weaker efforts are some of the worst Hulk episodes ever. Season 4 is possibly second best season for Incredible Hulk series. You have two part classic episode PROMETHEUS and another memorable two parter THE FIRST is also one of season 4's highlights. But, no other season can't touched season 2. This season had two of the best Hulk episodes ever and other episodes are all noteworthy and some of them is truly incredible.

Season 2's highlights are two two-part episodes. MARRIED is most emotional Hulk episode, and this is indeed touching, unforgettable episode. Also, this episode was Emmy-award winner (best actress category for tv series) I love this episode. Another two parter MYSTERY MAN is one of the best episodes in entire Hulk series. David Benner and Jack Mcgee met and their weird situations really progressed, viewer never expecting what happen will be next, and results are truly memorable. Don't miss this essential episode.

Season 2 had many more one hour classic episodes. A CHILD IN NEED, STOP THE PRESSES (also appearing as a bonus feature for Hulk season 1 dvd set), ALICE IN DISCO LAND are all entertaining, sometimes very touching episodes. But, actually there're no weaker efforts in season 2. Entire season is full of well-made, well-written episodes. And, without a doubt season 2 is my choice for best Incredible Hulk season.

Season 1 is great collection and quality is very good. I hope season 2 is same kind of high quality product, and very happy episodes like MARRIED, MYSTERY MAN and A CHILD IN NEED are finally releasing dvd collection. Thanks for reading.",1177286400,10,1810,4.908496732026144
2818184,5,B000PFUANC,I'm so happy to finally own the second season of the Incredible Hulk. It's nice to be able to watch it commercial free and also not to have to rely on the internet for either. As long as I have a DVD player that's good enough for me. I can't to watch it as this is one of those timeless 1970's TV shows that I have never out grown.,1481241600,,331,3.8115942028985508

2818209,4,B000PFUANC,"The incredible hulk series is one of those rare adaptations that isn't necessarily close to the source material, but the themes and instances that it focuses on were (at the time) very topical and often difficult to deal with. Instead of super-villain smack-downs or world-shattering plots that the franchise is known for today, you see characters dealing with such issues as alcoholism or child abuse. There is much more of a focus on the human element to the storytelling. Much like in the first season, rarely do we get a glimpse of the Incredible Hulk, but instead we get a strong focus on the character of Bruce (David) Banner, and his own everyday struggle to control the raging beast within him. For the more adult fans of Marvel's famous ""Jade Giant"", this series is a must-own. For younger audiences, the issues the series deals with and the lack of the titular character thereof might make them shy away from it; and indeed, certain touchy subjects in the show may just be a little too dark for them to be exposed to. But while I believe such is the case, I still feel like television actor Bill Bixby's portrayal of Bruce Banner is by far the most memorable of the character yet.",1427068800,,1190,4.644549763033176

Disk 5 is enclosed inside its own case.  Tabs holding disks 1-4 had broken off and damaged some of the disks.  Had to return twice in order to get copy that was not damaged.

2818216,4,B000PFUANC,"Season 2 of the Incredible Hulk could be many things. At it's best, it was heartwarming and touching. At its worst, man it was cheesy.

The series begins off strong with ""Married,"" which finds David meeting a terminally ill doctor in Hawaii who he thinks can help her and finds that she actually needs his help too. Mariette Hartley is unforgettable as Carolyn, who becomes David's second wife who he loses to tragedy and that sets the tone for the rest of the season.

The best episodes of this year include the touching child abuse episode, ""A Child in Need,"" an episode where David gets the job of an assistant football trainer and becomes suspicious of hypnotherapy in, ""Killer Instinct."" and then there's a nice psychological piece, ""No Escape.""

 Also the character of Jack McGee receives much-needed fleshing out in, ""Stop the Presses,"" and ""The Confession."" The two actually meet up with David Banner bandaged after an accident but having memories of the Hulk and then McGee getting in a plane crash in the two part ""Mystery Men"" story, a clip show that's still worth a watch. At the start of the Season, McGee was little more than an obstacle to move David Banner along. At the end of Season 2, he's a serious journalist stuck working for a tabloid rag who believes (somehow) that capturing the Hulk will get him back to a serious newspapers.

On the bad side of the ledger is the non-sensical, ""Rainbow's End"" where everyone's motivation seems to be way off, particularly David's motivation for moving on from the Indian horse trainer who he turned to for herbal treatment when the trainer suggested allowing time to adjust treatment. ""The Disciple"" really felt like a pilot for a TV show a Kung Fu private investigator where police procedures are silly or non-existent and David Banner remained in the background for most of the episode.

""Kindred Spirits"" has a silly premise of David investigating seeming proof of the existence of a pre-historic Hulk, hoping that Hulk found a cure. It does feature someone recognizing David from before the explosion everyone thinks claimed his life. However, it also features Kim Cattrall playing a Native American woman who has taken a name to hide the fact that she's a Negative American, even though her as a Native American isn't the least bit believable. Then we have the season finale, ""Vendetta Road"" about a redneck blowing up gas stations and refineries because it was the only way he could show his love for his murdered father who was killed by a big corporate head honcho which is why he's harming all the people who work at the gas station and making it impossible for anyone in the county to buy gas. Because nothing says, ""I Love You"" like blowing up gas stations.

Beyond the few standouts on both the ""really good"" and ""really bad"" side, this is a good season with the incredible charm and warmth of Bill Bixby combined with the awesome physique of Lou Ferrigno, there are plenty of great stories of David and the Hulk helping people from mentally challenged brothers of auto racers to women trying to start their own small business.",1413158400,,3099,4.770522388059701
2818217,4,B000PFUANC,"We really love the incredible Hulk Series.  The rating was reduced to 4 star because of the terrible  disk holder.  They do not hold the disk in place.

I never liked the 'glow' that was shown on Banner's face during the transformations in season 1; i'm glad they got rid of that from season 2 and on. There's some stand out and pivotal eps during this season. Staring with the outstanding two-parter 'Married' which has one of the best Hulk-Outs of the series in where Banner Hulk's out while under hypnosis! Also the two-parter 'Mystery Man'  has Jack McGee making a startling discovery about the Hulk itself!

It isn't as bad as TV today which is Judge Judy in space, basically.(Knight Rider with Mike and the she-bitch/Flash Goiter/Adlantis whatever) that isn't even fun.  Basically in this late '70's PC romp, it was ""Grand Funk Railroad"" doing a political movement(with the Hulk in place of Funk) about drinking and child molesting or stalking librarians with perverted cops.(which I was frankly, sick of even when I was like 10).  Still it is funny, like a reviewer here stated because of this, you can't really take this stuff seriously.  You can be serious about a purchase as you would ""Star Trek Season 3"" for the same reason, it's rediculous.  Fameous comedians parody this stuff, it is the (only) basis of thier material.  And Bill Bixby is a comedian at heart anyway, and it shows here.  I do not recall the episode where he trips through a hundred landmines because ""canadian science chic"" doesn't want to go the extra mile, as her car might ware out-has to take the kids to soccer practice or whatever.  That mine romp, sticks to the brain more than anything ""banner"".  This show should be called ""The Miss adventures of David Banner"" like ""Louis and Clark"" instead of superman. the real fun is watching a guy in plaide and highwatered bells and emergeny orange cowboy work boots do acrobatics(rather abysmally) trying to resolve a dire sitiuation of someone(Alice) who really isn't worth the spit in her mug.",1280448000,,1592,4.845018450184502

What a wonderful tv series, ""The Incredible Hulk,"" is ,great for all ages.  I liked watching it as a kid and now in my 30's appreciate the storylines in the series even more. Great action scenes done so well, even better without the computer technology of today.  Which gave it enough action, and also the human element as well, which  made it seem all the more real.  As David Banner or the Hulk, they were both portrayed with great humanity , a sense of justice, tempered by compassion.  I think all the stories and episodes in this season are first rate, but I think Married the two hour movie was done very well.

2818240,5,B000PFUANC,"THE INCREDIBLE HULK's 1978-79 Season is awesome and a definte upgrade to the Hulk's 1st Season, especially since this show was pretty much just starting to crawl during it's First Season even though THE INCREDIBLE HULK was an instant smash when it made it's debut on CBS in the Spring of 1978, but this show was definetley walking by the time it started it's Second Season in the Fall of 1978, which was when I started watching this show religiously every week on CBS along with the fact that THE INCREDIBLE HULK was still in its honeymoon phase of the show on top of that after making its series debut on CBS on Friday March 10th, 1978.

As a matter of fact, this 1979-1979 Season takes me all the way back to memory lane when THE INCREDIBLE HULK was on CBS's Friday night line-up starting with WONDER WOMAN at 8PM followed by THE INCREDIBLE HULK at 9PM topped off by DALLAS at 10PM, which was of course before THE INCREDIBLE HULK was moved to Wednesdays around January of 1979, which was of course before CBS had moved THE INCREDIBLE HULK back to Fridays making it part of CBS's Friday night line-up again in March of 1979.

Therefore, when CBS moved THE INCREDIBLE HULK back to Fridays, CBS's new Friday night line-up was kicked off by THE INCREDIBLE HULK at 8PM followed by THE DUKES OF HAZZARD at 9PM, topped off by DALLAS at 10PM.

It was also interesting seeing
*Gerald McRaney before he was even famous when he guest starred in both ""The Disciple"" episode and the ""Ricky"" episode, which was of course before his co-starring days as the short-tempered gonzo private detective(Rick Simon)on SIMON & SIMON and before his co-starring days on MAJOR DAD, and TOUCHED BY AN ANGEL

*Sherman Hensley in the ""No Escape"" episode during his co-starring days as George Jefferson on THE JEFFERSONS

*Singer Rick Springfield in ""The Disciple"" episode before he became famous and before his hit song ""JESSIE'S GIRL"" was even released

*Shelley Fabares in the ""Escape From Los Santos"" episode before her co-starring days on COACH

*Pat Morita in the ""Stop The Presses"" episode before his co-starring days on HAPPY DAYS and THE KARATE KID

*Jerry Douglas in the ""A Solitary Place"" episode during his earlier co-starring days as John Abbott on THE YOUNG & THE RESTLESS

*Lance LeGault in ""The Antowuk Horror"" episode before his co-starring days as the disgruntled Army nemesis(Col. Decker) on THE A-TEAM and before his co-starring days as the ornery Navy Col. Green on MAGNUM, P.I.

*Julie Cobb before her co-starring days on CHARLES IN CHARGE

*Bill Lucking in ""The Antowuk Horror"" episode before his co-starring days as the overzealous nemesis (Col. Lynch) on THE A-TEAM

*Kim Catrall in the ""Kindred Spirits"" episode before she was even a star

*Thalmus Rasulala in the ""No Escape"" episode before his co-starring days as Capt. Bolz on the short-lived police drama THE NEW DRAGNET and after his co-starring days on the sitcom WHAT'S HAPPENING

*Howard Morton in the ""Vendetta Road"" episode before his co-starring days on GIMME A BREAK and THE MUNSTERS TODAY

*A. Martinez in the ""Kindred Spirits"" episode before his co-starring days on SANTA BARBARA, GENERAL HOSPITAL, ONE LIFE TO LIVE, and PORT CHARLES

*Markie Post in ""The Confession"" episode before her co-starring days on NIGHT COURT and THE FALL GUY

*Morgan Woodward in the ""Vendetta Road"" episode during his co-starring days on DALLAS

*Dana Elcar in the ""Escape From Los Santos"" episode before his co-starring days on MACGYVER

*Dennis Holahan in the ""Alice In Disco Land"" episode before his co-starring days on GENERAL HOSPITAL

Additionally, this season had a lot of cool and touching episodes like ""A Child In Need"", ""Alice In Disco Land"", ""Married"", and ""Mystery Man"", because in the ""Mystery Man"" episode it's a 2-parter episode when the recluse David Banner(Bill Bixby) loses his memory after a fatal car wreck and then later gets lost in the forest with the overzealous newpaper reporter Jack McGee(Jack Colvin)after David & McGee survive a plane crash in the woods while they try to rejog David's memory as they struggle to stay alive and be rescued while David & McGee reminisce about McGee's obsession with the Hulk & how it all got started while David tries to put the pieces of the puzzle together while having flashbacks of his involvement of his ghaslty ordeal with the Hulk by using clips from THE INCREDIBLE HULK's 1st and 2nd Seasons, including scenes from the pilot episode.

In the ""Married"" episode, while searching for a cure to his horrendous infliction with the Hulk in Hawaii; David ends up meeting and marrying a terminally ill scientist(Mariette Hartley) who is dying who was potentially his only hope to cure from the Hulk, which has a tragic conclusion when she dies in David/The Hulk's arms at the end of this episode leaving David as a widower again.

In the ""Alice In Disco Land"" episode, while working at a bar, David helps an orphaned down-on-her-luck teenager(Donna Wilkes) battle her drinking problem by helping her turn her life around at the conclusion when she wins the disco dance contest at a bar that was illegally serving liquor to minors, which ends up going out of business at the end of this episode.

In the ""A Child In Need"" episode, while working as David Baxter as a gardener at an elementary school; David helps out a physically abused child(Dennis Dimster) by later helping the boys physically abusive father(Sandy McPeak) come to the realization at the end of this episode that he is a child beater who was also abused as a kid & needed professional help and ends up going to rehab at the end.

This season also takes me back to memory lane when CBS's motto was ""Turn Us On"", since that was the motto on CBS from the Fall of 1978 thru the Summer of 1979.

It's just too bad that Universal didn't add a more sophisticated bonus episode from THE INCREDIBLE HULK's 3rd Season, like the ""Proof Positive"" episode for instance or even the ""Metamorphosis"" episode instead of using the ""Homecoming"" episode for the bonus episode on this DVD.

So I highly recommend THE INCREDIBLE HULK's 1978-79 Season to anybody who watched this show religiously every Friday night on CBS like I did.",1228867200,5,6178,4.821192052980132

2818246,4,B000PFUANC,"I have a strong affinity for Banner and the Hulk and I am looking forward to season 3. Hope it comes out real soon, like later this spring or early this summer. I have some experience with being on the road, looking for a place to work and a secure place to sleep. It's not easy and it isn't getting easier. Staying out of jail is much more difficult today than it was 30 years ago. Cops everywhere will shake you down and try to plug something on you if you're alone on the road.

  Walking alone is becoming more dangerous all the time, at least in the suburbs and the country. I suppose that's one of the reasons why I like series like the Incredible Hulk and the Fugitive (David Jansen); because I experienced some of that kind of freedom for a short time in the 80s and I know that it is fading away. Of course, being a fugitive on the run from nosey reporters and the law can be a problem, but at the same time, being on the open road going across the country without a true, secure destination is also the epitome of American freedom.

  Believe it or not, I have some envy for Banner, despite his problem with the Hulk. I envy him because, while he is compelled by his situation to run from the NR reporter Jack McGee, he is also a very capable professional man with some very helpful skills, the kind that not only make friends but also impress the ladies. That's more than I had when i was out there in the 80s. If it wasn't the Hulk getting him out of a dangerous situation, it was his professional skills.

  Season two had somewhat of a slow start, imo, after the very romantic episode, Married, in Hawaii with Caroline (Mariette Hartley). The episodes following were okay, but I didn't really care for the main themes all that much. They were basically just situations where Banner took some low-profile jobs and got messed up with the local dunderheads. If I found myself in such situations I'd just get the hell out of town asap, but that's me. Banner, ot-oh, had to play the good samaritin and get in over his head.

  A Child in Need and Alice in Disco Land were okay, but obviously more human interest social statements than anything else, with the Hulk simply filling in the action scenes. Obviously, both wife and child-battering husbands and teenage alcoholism were becoming much more open for discussion at that time. Unfortunately, it was about 5 years too late for my family. Of course, the federally-mandated Christian-right solution was to blame it all on marijuana -- go figure!

  The season got much more interesting after Stop the Press, an episode in which he ran into trouble while working as a dishwasher in a Chicago restaurant, with a dirty reporter working for the National Register, whose desk was just an elbow away from Jack McGee. Imo, this was one of the best episodes of the season, and the season on the whole improved quite a lot after it. Escape from Los Santos was okay, especially the scene where he broke out of the local jail after the crooked cops nailed him to implicate him for murder. It's always nice to see the Hulk get him out of the really tight situations. I enjoyed A Solitary Place, probably more than most, because I tried to live like that once and it brought back some memories.

  Other episodes of this season that I enjoyed were The Haunted, about a schizoid girl that employs Banner to help her make a move back to her late folk's country estate, treading upon deep, dangerous roots from her forgotten past; Mystery Man, a 2-part episode that begins with an accident that causes Banner to lose his memory and with a bandage over his burnt face, unknowingly joins Jack McGee in a cross-country venture to regain it; No Escape, about another schizoid man suffering from hallucinations, who leaks to Banner his desire to kill his wife and his doctor; The Quiet Room, about Banner working as an orderly in a psyhiatric institution when he gets too close to a doctor's secret mind-control experiments; The Confession, about a nerdy computer technician who witnesses Banner's Hulk eruption and takes the story directly to the National Register, while claiming he is the Hulk, looking for attention and seeking fame; and Vendetta Road, about an angry young man and his girlfriend seeking revenge upon a huge oil monopoly that has been buying up all the local gas-stations and forcing others out of business.

  Of the 22 episodes, I liked 14. The other 8 were okay, but not the kind I like to revisit in reruns. This package also includes another excellent episode from season 3, Homecoming, where Banner returns to his hometown to visit his sister and father for Thanksgiving (and saves their farm).

  Anyways, I'm a big fan of the Incredible Hulk series and I look forward to the other seasons on Dvd asap. Great series!",1206230400,4,4784,4.58147713950762

This is also the season when the overzealous nosey reporter Jack McGee(Jack Colvin)discovers that the Hulk is actually a man who transforms into a green monsterous creature under extremely stressful situations and finally realizes how the Hulk is able to just get from place to place all over the country, but still not piecing together the fact that David Banner(Bill Bixby)is still alive as well as the man who becomes the Hulk either.

The Hulk's 2nd Season also takes me all the way back to memory lane to when I was 6 years old in the 1st grade and how I always used to look forward to watching this show every weekend when it was part of CBS's Friday night line-up with WONDER WOMAN at 8PM, THE INCREDIBLE HULK at 9PM, and DALLAS at 10PM, but at one point CBS had briefly moved THE INCREDIBLE HULK to Wednesdays back in the Winter of 1979 when THE DUKES OF HAZZARD made its debut on CBS, but was moved back to Fridays in the Spring of 1979.

I just wish Universal had provided each episodes original air-date like Universal did with the first 3 seasons of KNIGHT RIDER, MAGNUM, & THE A-TEAM for instance & just like Warner Bros. did with CHiPs, WONDER WOMAN, and THE DUKES OF HAZZARD too.

2818250,4,B000PFUANC,"Many say the Second Season of the Incredible Hulk is the best overall, I'm not qualified to judge so far but I have to say it's pretty good but it's not much better than the First Season.  True, in the first season the show was struggling to find it's groove and an overall tone was absent and it seemed pretty incredible how David was constantly finding himself in life threatening situations.  But in their experimentations the creators came up with some very good and thrilling episodes.

The Second Season makes amends for some things that didn't go well the first time around.  For example, David doesn't need to be in life threatening situations for the Hulk to surface.  In fact, in an episode called The Antowuk Horror David transforms simply because he gets extremely irritated.  That set a good tone for how much of a curse his condition really is.  And you see this pop up on occasion during the second season.  Another thing the show betters here; it finds it's raison d'etre (i.e. socially conscious).  You could easily see in the first season that the creators had more brainpower than simply having the Hulk pop up and wreck things.  More energy was put into David Banner and his lonely quest for a cure and some shows featured very strong storylines and some were really dramatic.

Many episodes here focus on social matters;  Alcoholism, mental illness, societal alienation, corrupt megacompanies, the Harlem ghetto, child abuse and more.  Those deep storylines make for very entertaining 45+ minutes and you can't but admire the effort of the writing team and they're ability to conjur up interesting story lines, since the shows always change scenery and subject matter.

The Second does have some definite highlights.  Married is one of the best episodes I've seen so far, totally captivating and the tragic storyline moved me very much.  Top notch acting from Bixby and Mariette Hartley and the desert Hulk scenes look spectacular.  A Child In Need is great as well, has a difficult subject matter but handles it mostly very well. Great Hulk scenes in that episode too.  And let's not forget Mystery Man, the two parter where we really get to know Jack McGee and his reasons for pursuing the Hulk as relentlessly as he does.  Jack Colvin owns that episode, but then he's always good.

Not every Season 2 episode is a classic but most of them are good and some are outstanding.",1199923200,3,2397,4.785888077858881

It has to be said though that Bill Bixby is a wonderful actor and really carried the show in places.

2818253,3,B000PFUANC,"While the first season was good and had the charm of the main plot and interesting character plots, this second season is more of a pollitical statement as most every(or every other at least) episode is some heavy-hearted emotional issue related too much to life, as drinking or abuse or ""anger"" management.  these issues need to be addressed in their own genre, not science fiction dramas or any kind of TV drama not directly related.  Not only is the emotional ""baggage"" inapproriate, it is blatently odvious and takes presience over any thing else.  Why not be subtle, you don't need a support group seminar to get some message across to people.  This is far far worse in today's TV and movies then the 1970's or even 80's and by these standards, The Incredible Hulk's statements are mild in comparison and right on the money AT LEAST!(thus I give 3, not 1 star).  Unlike the twisted ethos of today(as in Doctor Who Davy Tennet trashola or even worse, Chrissy Escalator Head's dopy ethics!), these 70's Hulk episodes are correct(as in unbiased and moderate, not one sided) yet I beleive another avenue is needed to tell these heavy tales and it is so very unfortunate that an enjoyable avenue as sci fi has to be the constant target for PC statements as these, and thus distracting from sci fi(as in projected future or figurative SCIENIFIC) qualities of a film/series or so on..  Harlen Elsian would likely concur.  Most Hulk writers are more actors than writers and also appeared in the show. Carol Baxter to name one, in ""Promethius""-season three or four I believe.  Of the more notable and rememberable epsiodes of season 2 is ""The Mystery Man"", a two parter about a plane crash after Banner suffers amniesia from ""hitchhiking""(""don't try that at home, kids!"").  Banner and McGee make nice for the journey back to civilistion and Banner must recover amneisia while playing ""scar victim"" under a white mask to McGEE. ""Stop The Presses"" is another business-like(and emotional baggage free) episode played out as ""An interveiw with the Hulk."" type senerio. Only emotion is banner's conflict with his self and the pride that led to his transformation in the Pilot movie. Very tear moving! Great stuff!(non PC). The most notable of all(and ironically my favorite too despite my contempt for the season as a whole axiom) ""Another Path""(and the accompaning sequal) where Banner befriends a martial arts master who utilizes ""mind over matter"" and eastern philospies of disiplin in times of pain and healing.  Of course the season begins with ""Married"" to most, the best of them, yet not any sort of political statement, a bit heavy and smoothering on the syrip of emotion if you ask me.  Not just a tear jerk but a long and drawn out agnoy with this woman who was acted by Mariette Hartley. A good actress in all things(and celebrity) who was quite often, in those days ,type cast in to sci-fi ""B"" roles and usually the ""pain bearer altruist"" of sci-fi heroins. See the Star Trek soap opra (can't recall title,) Spock in central role as well the separate movies she did well into the 70's.  She is actually a Susan Sullivan replacement to illustrate that Banner was in fact a human being who had a life beyond the futitive status and gives continuity to the pilot which otherwise would be too segratated to believe as part of the serial.  Dispite a bit of cornball comedy and cliche 70's stereo-type impersionations(in joke) this(main plot) was also moving, yet a bit too drawn out like a ship lost in a storm at sea and under constant battle with the storm.(tiring). When I was a kid this was always one I had trouble watching(""Married"") as it was the first 1970's TV show to make one ""tired"".(except for that Jack O'Hallorn Made for TV movie about a huricane I suppose-tragic and all too long!)",1186185600,2,3795,4.766768292682927
8191089,5,B000PFUANC,Huge fan of the Hulk and Bill Bixby portraying the character. This is a classic 70's tv show and a lot of good episodes on the season 2 collection. I am so glad that dvd is available for this series and it's great to have this on your archives or collections of the shows of the seventies! I aim to collect all of them too and Bill Bixby is a lot a better than the current actors playing the Hulk in the Avengers movies that being out there right now and they manage to pull this one off without the CGI back in the days.,1525737600,,521,3.9714285714285715
