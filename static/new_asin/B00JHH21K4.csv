8651016,5,B00JHH21K4,"I bought this dvd for the sole purpose of owning The Shaolin Plot. I had been searching all over for this movie on dvd for months after I watched it on youtube. The english dubbing and subtitle are very good. This video quality is excellent, and this is one of my absolute favorite kung fu movies. In my top 5 along with the Thundering Mantis, and almost any David Chiang movie. I haven't watched the other 3 movies on the dvd yet, but I've watched the Shaolin Plot a handful of times since getting it. I love the fight choreography, the story, the characters, and the sound effects of the golden cymbals that the Tibetan warrior uses. A fun kung fu movie to watch, and worth the price of the dvd alone!!",1419811200,5,704,4.340909090909091
