7856573,5,6303945678,"The Promise is a film that the first time I did not understand at all, but after watching it once or twice over. I fell in love with this film and it's two main characters of Sophie and Konrad, that despite their separation due to the Berlin Wall try to make things meet and see each other often. The cliff hanger at the end of the film is what makes the film the film. it bothered me at first but now I understand why this was done because if there was an non cliff hanger ending the film simply would not be as good. Its worth seeing.",1419552000,,536,4.018691588785047

7856576,5,6303945678,"Beautifully done drama and thriller from von Trotta-- the back and forth from East to West Berlin will keep you on the edge.

I have read much on the Cold War, but this film puts it in very human terms, more than any academic historical account can.  The scene where his son tied his shoe put a lump in my throat.  I will never look at a manhole cover the same again.",1166400000,,367,4.069444444444445
7856577,5,6303945678,"This film is thoroughly enjoyable.  It is very sweet, romantic, and historically accurate.  This movie and French Kiss are my two favorites to watch over and over.",984787200,2,163,5.0
7856578,5,6303945678,"THE PROMISE, by one of Germany's most prominent directors, Margarethe von Trotha, is an exceptional drama which tells the story of a love divided, a country, and city physically and politically divided for almost three  decades,the end of this separation, and what happened in between. Starring  some of Germany's brightest stars, current and past, from both sides of the  wall, THE PROMISE (Das Versprechen) is a must for any history buff or any  fan of epic historical dramas. Ms. von Trotha is to be congratulated for  being the only major German filmmaker to tackle the highly controversial  topic of German reunification, offering a very balanced, fair view. The  different decades and locales are superbly reproduced, and the constant  action and colorful visuals, very well captured on this VHS version, make  this video highly watchable, even by those most adverse to subtitles. Don't  miss it!",926467200,12,902,5.201388888888889
