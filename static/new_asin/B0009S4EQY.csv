8065800,4,B0009S4EQY,"This finale to the Ring is better than the previous evenings although the problems of orchestra and less than ideal soloists are still present. Kupher keeps some ideas from his previous version. The difference is the new scenery and the image of the World Ash. He seems to have forgotten this since the branch that has stuck through the walls of the stage, getting more and more rotten as the work progresses is still here even though the Norns and Waltraute tell us it has been cut down to place around Walhall. Kupher has rethought his finale here to good effect. Gone are the bore socialites with their cocktails and TVs. There is a shocking image here which I won't give away and Kupher ends it as he did in Bayreuth with two children as symbols of the new life. On the whole I am glad I watched this Ring. Like all attempts a the Ring it leaves one frustrated. I would not rate it one of the best videos. For that we need to wait for Kupher and Barenboim from Bayreuth where everything conspires toward greatness.",1135900800,2,1018,4.449197860962567
8065801,4,B0009S4EQY,"I started, on several occasions, to write a longish review on this whole Cycle to complement and complete what I wrote about Das Rheingold.  But now that the first Kupfer Cycle is being released (and Die Walkure already has), have patience and get it as it is becomes available.

In the meantime, if you are like a woman who can never have enough diamonds; and can never have enough RINGS (like me); and already have the Boulez/Chereau RING, get this in the interim because it is better than what else is out there.

There is a lot to be said for it.  Kupfer's direction is strong and appropriate, as are the sets.  Von Kannen is even better as Alberich than he was in the first Kupfer production; and Clarke as both Loge and Mime is almost as good.  But the rest of the cast do not come up to the very high standards for acting as well as singing as Tomlinson, Evans et al.  Even the great Matti Salminen as Hagen is nowhere near as good as Philip Kang.  And of course, de Billy as conductor is no Barenboim.

(As a matter of personal taste, I loathed Struckmann as Wotan, although he was quite good as Gunther.  There is something about his cold forced voice that detracts considerably from the performance.  I do not believe that this is a an idea of the director or the conductor -- it is him, and I do not like it.  I also hated John Treleaven as Siegfried -- his wide vibrato and swoops in particular.)

That said, it is still worth having until the whole 1991 Kupfer RING is released.",1134691200,9,1491,4.3393501805054155
8065802,5,B0009S4EQY,"This is actually a review for the complete Barcelona Ring Cycle, not just Gotterdammerung.

I have watched this set twice now, and I love it. I can't understand some of the hits it has taken by a few of the reviewers, but perhaps they were expecting a perfect Ring Cycle. Does such a thing exist?

Not only is this Ring Cycle visually and aurally captivating, it is also quite entertaining - fast paced, galvanized, rarely plodding, despite the exposition-heavy libretto. Bertrand deBilly might not be the most incisive Wagner conductor out there, his style may seem rather anonymous to some(is that always such a bad thing? at least he doesn't take liberties), and yes, the Barcelona orchestra is a step or two away from being world class, the brass section does hit a few sour notes, but I feel that both conductor and orchestra do justice to Wagner's great score, they understand the overall intensity of the drama even if they do occasionally miss some of the subtler nuances. Besides, faulting the orchestra is, to me, a minor quibble when everything else about this set is so right on.

Here we have a group of singers(especially the dynamic Deborah Polaski as Brunnhilde, John Treleaven, whose dopey and arrogant frat boy of a Siegfried is an interesting and refreshing interpretation, and of course the always dependable Matti Salminen as Hagen) who have a deep emotional investment in their characters, who understand what these characters are going through and are not afraid to show it. In addition to that, everybody sings well, and they share true chemistry. Add to the singers a beautifully dank, post-apocalyptic production by Harry Kupfer(in widescreen no less, lending the performance the look of a dark and modernistic science fiction film) that adds new dimensions of interpretation to Wagner's epic(the ubiquitous background grid, does it represent power, fate?...your guess is as good as mine), and you have a Ring Cycle well worth purchasing.

The Ring is the most ambitious piece of music theater ever produced, so, as I said before, a perfectly conceived Ring Cycle might be impossible. But if you are interested in a Ring that is well-performed, highly enjoyable, and that challenges the intellect as well as the imagination, then give this one a try.",1130198400,8,2276,4.997361477572559
8065803,3,B0009S4EQY,"Maybe,this very expensive Ring dvd set(Rheingold in two discs,other parts in three)can help Barcelona Liceo to engage better horn players to its orchestra,the reason why I will not weep blood for my wasted money. In despite of I did like a lot Falk Struckmann's Wotan on three previous parts this(some dull guy wrote about his ""ill focus voice"" in another Rheingold rewiew. Oh,please;listen his heavy metal voice ending perfectly Walkre,for instance!),also another good singing by others performers here,I just count a debt balance at the end;whether singing is fine,action was bad. Whether orchestra plays good,de Billy shows his ordinary concept of these scores. To Gotterdammerung,the last part,I think I heard the worse;a lax,very irregular Siegfried,a Brnhilde that doesn't pay due respect to Wagner's metric(Polaski was  better a lot on Walkre),very bad action on stage(final scene,people running from a side to another is ridiculous).I like Kupfer's set ideas,especially to Siegfried(clever this kind of Fafner Scissorhands,besides Billy and his orchestra acquaint their best right there),however some wardrobe and hairdressing are just tenebrous;what is this Brnhilde ""coiffure"" on Immolation Scene?Does she burn her own hair by chance?Why gods were in these fern fancy dresses?What about this Siegmund's paunchy-pants,this deadly cream-shave on Walkre?What a pity! Just wait for that much superior Bayreuth/Barenboim production(Walkre available at present).",1128643200,3,1466,5.915094339622642
