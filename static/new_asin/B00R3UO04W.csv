8693997,5,B00R3UO04W,Best Samurai film I have watched in a while.  It captures the essence of being a samurai. I too would like to purchase with English sub-title made for American audience. There must be must a video available because I watched on a Japan Airlines flight to Hawaii.,1468108800,,262,4.574468085106383
8693998,4,B00R3UO04W,"None of the DVD offered here has English subtitles. I know that exist, I have already watched the film while flying, but I cannot find a DVD in order to get a copy of the film. I already own a japanese only copy. Love that film, wonderful atmosphere.",1449878400,,250,4.229166666666667
8693999,5,B00R3UO04W,"I saw most of this movie on a recent flight.  Now I am attempting to locate a copy which can be used in USA.  Blue Ray Region A/1 is the search.  (I needed 15 minutes more in the air to see it all)

The movie is very well composed with English sub titles.  The story line offers a look into the Japanese feudal system from the inside.  (Not a Tom Cruise gloss over) The inter workings under the all powerful Shoguns is well developed as is the customs which existed at all levels in the Japanese culture.  We could certainly benefit from the polite interactions, with and without a sword..",1429833600,4,589,4.3
