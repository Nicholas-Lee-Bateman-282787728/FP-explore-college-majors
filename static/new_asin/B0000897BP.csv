7980468,5,B0000897BP,"This movie is very deep and evolved, I feel it explores the damaged human sole and mind resulting from childhood trama, and how if not treated can warp a person thinking and ability to connect with anyone in a real-life relationship. Very sad what this young women endured as a child and how she ended up with a sycophantic personality. I feel this movie shows the damage that can be done and how it is reveled in this movie, through classic sterio-typing  and commercialism. Creative storytelling  and use of character's. I enjoy movies that make me think.",1491177600,,557,4.731958762886598
7980469,2,B0000897BP,Avery bad print and I lost interest in it pretty fast. I thought it was a Brad Renfro movie but I didn't watch it long enough to see him. Too bad these DVDs are not restored.,1387670400,,174,3.861111111111111
7980470,4,B0000897BP,"I watched this movie several years ago and it has haunted me since.  Just purchased a copy and can't wait to see it again.  I know it's the subject of a popular book as well but the movie is about a ""Marilyn Monroe"" wanna be who thinks she could be a hollywood star.  She carries on a lesbian affair in spite of being married with 2 young children.  Her husband treats her like a queen but she is so royally screwed up, she runs all over the small desert town telling everyone He abuses her.  She resents her kids for holding her back and it's pretty clear she offs them ""susan smith"" style in the desert.  Buying them a happy meal before their demise.  She fools absolutely everybody except her sister and brother in law, played by infamous, ""BRAD RENFRO"" who is great as usual and really is the best part of the whole movie for his ""burning the trash""  (Love his style and a neat idea at that). Since she slept with and fooled the detective and causing him to retire from grief, she leaves a trail of smitten hearts, 2 babies in a graveyard and while chasing her dream of california, she leaves town in a BLAST.  YeeHaw.  GREAT MOVIE.  Disturbing material.",1353456000,3,1158,4.364485981308412
7980471,5,B0000897BP,"i think the reviewer before me didn't take time to look at the underlying meaning of the movie through all its nuances. this film is named after an essay published in 1899, about conspicuous consumption (wiki it) in modern society. it is scary how on the mark that essay was, and how much it applies to our world today. this movie script is a take on that idea, using a murder-mystery storyline to show the ugly side of modernity, with it's obsession of brands and consuming products. i think what i love most is that never in the movie does it stop to say that THIS is what the movie is about. it doesn't preach anything, it just shows a farcical reality in american society.
i haven't seen it in a while, which is why i'm here buying a copy, but i remember finishing it and thinking how smart in its subtlety it was.",1267228800,6,818,4.318181818181818
7980472,1,B0000897BP,"Oh my goodness...I don't think I have seen a worse film in all my years.  I am a huge fan of Brad Renfro and thought, ""Hey, why don't I add another one of his DVDs to my collection, since he is a really good actor so I know none of his movies could be bad, at least in my mind because just him being in the movie is an automatic 3 stars.""  Boy, was I wrong!  I couldn't even watch this.  I had to keep pausing it and returning back.  It was just horrible.  I bought it used and wish I could take it back...that was 15 dollars shot out of my pocket.  I don't recommend viewing this due to the complete torture of boredom.  But I think you should watch this if you hope to become a screen writer on what NOT to write.  If they can make movies like this I have a bunch of scripts I think they should put together than would be block buster hits compared to this film.  Just absolutely horrible.  Not to mention, Brad Renfro was only in like 3 scenes with like 2 lines.  Just horrible.  Completely horrible.",1097971200,5,1003,4.0561224489795915
