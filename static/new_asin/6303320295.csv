7843540,5,6303320295,"This is our fourth Dave Hood ""There Goes a .... "" video and, I think, the best. This is the first one we've seen with Becky, and I thought she was a nice added element.  Dave's comic bits are less distracting and performed better than when he depends on amateur bystanders. He does a wonderful job of making the videos informative as well as entertaining, and I find I haven't minded watching this tape (over and over again) at the same time our toddler loves watching the images and jokes (over and over again).

In the course of this 35-minute video we visit a U.S. Navy cruiser and nuclear submarine, the Star of India sailing ship/museum as well as a small sail boat, cargo ships and hammerhead cranes (as seen on Amazing Race 2), a fishing boat, a tanker (with a 7-story engine room!), a tugboat, a U.S. Coast Guard cutter, and a luxury cruise ship. Kids get short, sweet encouragements to stay in school and use their life preserver.

I think this and ""There Goes a Fire Truck"" are the best in the series.",1031616000,14,1011,4.454054054054054
