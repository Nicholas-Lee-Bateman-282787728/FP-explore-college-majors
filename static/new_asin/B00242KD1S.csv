3842616,1,B00242KD1S,"WHY.... is a reasonable request that deserves an answer from those who offer this fine series in 2 issues. The information provided on Amazon's site, as offered by consumers, clearly states that Eureka 3.0 will be followed in July, 09 with an additional dvd set that provides the remaining episodes for season 3. It is disturbing to believe that this is marketing developed with the intent to raise monies over an amount that would have been less if purchased as one set. Frankly this is insulting. Does this  tactic satisfy instant gratification for those who cannot wait for the complete series? Do the math. Observe how this has been used with BSG and others. Unless there is something so blatant that I cannot see the forest for the trees, this issue is distasteful. I have canceled my original order as the fine people who have taken time to offer this information make it worthwhile to wait  and see. I welcome insightful comments. Thank you. P.J.

3842617,4,B00242KD1S,"I love Eureka, but I hate this dumb 1/2 season business.  It's just a plot to extract more money from our pockets... yeah, that's it!  It's an Obama fundraising scheme!

Anyhow, Season 3.0 is better than Season 2, so far...",1241740800,10,223,4.525
3842618,4,B00242KD1S,"There's some not-so-pleasant changes in store for the little town of Eureka.

""Eureka Season 3.0"" (meaning the first half of the third season a la ""Battlestar Galactica"") provides plenty of those, which adds some new tension to geniustown (including some rather shocking cast changes and a new ""love-to-hate"" person). It's kind of disconcerting to only have eight episodes, but they have the signature mixture of warm comedy and intriguing sci-fi mystery.

Among the changes in store: Alison (Salli Richardson-Whitfield) and Nathan (Ed Quinn) contemplate remarriage, and Henry is in jail. And the DOD sends in a corporate ""fixer"" named Eva Thorne (Frances Fisher) arrives to cut the deadwood from Global Dynamics. But then an anti-missile VIPER drone goes AWOL during a flight test and starts threatening Eureka, while Thorne decides to embed herself in Global Dynamics as one of the new bosses.

And while Eva ruthlessly makes GD ""profitable,"" the usual sci-fi disasters crop up. Carter has to deal with bizarre transformations in a sealed biosphere, a wedding-day timeloop, exploding biomemetic dogs, an impossible volcano brewing under Eureka (and which sprays gross fluids on people), an inept spandex-wearing ""Captain Eureka,"" a mayoral election heated up by an artificial supernova, and a swarm of ancient Egyptian insects.

In the meantime, Thorne is snooping around Eureka in search of something. Her quest leads to the discovery of a vast military base, and some bodies dead since 1939 -- and a bizarre substance that threatens Zoe's life after she slips and falls in it.

Apparently the once all-important Artifact is yesterday's business, because the dark subplot of ""Eureka Season 3.0"" is the mystery prewar bunker and whatever Thorne wants destroyed. It adds a nice undercurrent of conspiracy and tension to this season, though the focus is always first and foremost on our Everyman Sheriff, and how he tries to deal with the Horrific World-Ending Scientific Crisis of the day.

That's a nice balance, because the rest of the season flows in a river of gentle humor and extreme scientific problems. Plenty of weird inventions (cloud sculpting, flying rabbits and robot pooches), fun tongue-in-cheek dialogue (""They killed the infected and burned the city to the ground."" ""Let's call that Plan B""), and hilarious comedic moments. And Carter's always in the middle of it, trying to unravel a way to fix things.

But it's worth noting that while the Disasters Du Jour and the bunker plots are dealt with by the eighth episode, the half season ends with a cliffhanger for one character. Just sayin'.

Ferguson does a brilliant job as Carter, the down-to-earth Everycop who just wants to do his job (""It's all fun and games until someone gets cursed""). But Carter has some new problems in this season -- his new-agey, pregnant sister moves in with him, and Zoe continues to spread her wings with a job and boyfriend. Erica Cerra's Jo experiences some relationship woes, while Richardson-Whitfield's Alison is put in the position of being pretty powerless. Sadly, a longtime cast member also exits the scene early on.

This season also sees the return of Henry, whose skills turn out to be too invaluable for him to rot in prison -- and he even gets a new job on top of his old one.  And Fisher turns out to be a great addition: she initially makes a great steely-eyed corporate dictator, but the facade cracks as time goes on, and we get to see that she's haunted by something terrible in the past.

""Eureka Season 3.0"" is way too short (new episodes coming in July), but it still has the fresh mix of out-there sci-fi and small-town comedy. Definitely still worth the seeing.",1238889600,96,3684,5.013093289689034

3842707,5,B00242KD1S,"I think Season 3.0 gets a bad rap for being shortened, but as I understand it, this was a direct consequence of the Writer's Strike. In any event, I feel that it's irrelevant for fans of the series. For us, the content here is still outstanding, and we will gladly watch the ongoing adventures of Carter, Zoe, Henry, Lupo, Fargo, and friends. This season featured a really strong story arc (a first for the show). Although the climax is somewhat disappointing (the grand ""secret"" did not blow my socks off), it's still an enjoyable story. More important, the weekly crises that occur every episode are as enjoyable as ever.

My favorite of this season was ""Show Me The Mummy"". One of the great things about this SyFy show is that it always finds a clever way to insert scientific theory into the crisis that besieges the town, even when it's something like classic monster mythology on the menu.

I purchased the first two seasons, but now I just watch them on Netflix streaming. The reason? It's the only way to watch Eureka in HD. For some reason, this show has never been made available for purchase on Blu-ray, and consumers are forced to purchase it on DVD. This is really weird to me. Blu-ray technology has been around for 8 years now, and HDTVs became mainstream about 10 years ago. Why are we being asked to purchase products on an antiquated format? Would they print this show on VHS, if they had a warehouse full of old tapes? And then tell us we had to buy it on THAT? For those who appreciate good video quality, and want to take advantage of that HDTV they put so much money into, DVD looks almost as bad VHS, when compared to Blu-ray. Do yourself a favor, and stream it from Netflix in HD... while you still can!",1346630400,,1727,4.479365079365079

Don't get me wrong, I appreciate the eco-friendliness of recycled packaging. I just hate that EVERY time I get DVDs packaged this way they're loose from their seats and frequently scratched so badly that some portion or another of the content either won't play or only plays in fits and starts. I am unable to watch almost 5 minutes at the end of the last episode on the second disc due to the degree of damage the discs acquired before the shrink wrap was even removed from the purchase. Both discs are scratched and portions of the first disc played a few frames at a time so I had to turn on subtitles because I kept missing the dialog.

3842716,4,B00242KD1S,"Because I always say: When you can't think of a punchy review title, go 'head and quote those Danny Elfman lyrics.

Hidden somewhere in the Pacific Northwest is the remote (and top secret) tiny town of Eureka, home to America's most brilliant and eccentric scientists, all of whom are poking a curious collective finger into the mysteries of the universe. In Eureka, first impressions play false. A 9-year-old girl, for her school project, creates a dwarf star. The maintenance guy is the guy who maintains time. The dry cleaning woman once conducted research on invisibility (okay, this last one's from Season 2). Sheriff Jack Carter, who comes across as just regular folks, doesn't have the smarts to match Eureka's high-IQ'd populace, but he does have a knack for keeping the peace and digging up world-shattering secrets and for saving the day time and again. A single dad, Jack even finds time to raise his precocious 17-year-old daughter Zoe.

Like it or not, EUREKA - SEASON 3.0 collects only the first eight episodes of the third season, but that's still enough to keep Sheriff Carter up to his neck in busy. Maybe the most significant thing to happen early on is the arrival of Eva Thorne a.k.a. the Fixer. Thorne is a corporate performance evaluator and she's come to make Global Dynamics more cost-effective. This translates to the scrapping of the more unproductive projects at G.D. and also to staff downsizing. The word ""redacted"" is used so many times, you could launch a drinking game off it. And with stats indicating that incidents have only spiked since Jack's arrival, Thorne doesn't think much of the town Sheriff. And needless to say, the Fixer is nursing a hidden agenda which factors in Eureka's past, a sprawling underground complex 'neath the town, and also a mysterious purply substance called ""Element X."" That there is our thru-storyline for these eight episodes.

Catching up with our cast: The love triangle is just about winding down, what with Jack stepping aside gracefully as Allison and Nathan plan for their wedding. Henry Deacon, incarcerated for about three minutes, is simply too valuable to languish behind bars, and he's soon back in Eureka, all pardoned and, we assume, back to his good guy ways. Zoe gets a job at Cafe Diem, and it's really nice to see how she's developed into a normal teenager. Eureka is truly her home now.

The show's writers are really brilliant at making the hard science accessible enough to the viewers. They're also very good at injecting that cool sci-fi/fantasy element. Strong storytelling aside, Sheriff Carter is the key ingredient, acting as our surrogate eyes and pretty much behaving as we of average intellect would when some big brain is trying to explain away the science mumbo jumbo. Jack usually responds with a befuddled look or a remark like: ""I'm sure I'd be impressed if I knew what that meant."" And I love that.

Sheriff Jack Carter's case files are a bit more bizarre and challenging than just nabbing two good ol' boys driving a rebel red Dodge Charger or a truck driver and his chimpanzee (if you know your '80s shows). If Jack were to list his outlandish job experiences in Eureka on some future resume, his prospective employer would, well, call security. Where else can a Sheriff investigate a locked room mystery in a sealed bio-sphere? Or end up living the same day over and over? Or go up against a sentient robot attack drone... named Martha? Or receive an unwanted assist from a bumbling superhero called Captain Eureka? And, really, Pharaohpalooza? And Best In Show for robot dogs? And that's not even half of the mad science that greets Jack in these first eight episodes. The poor residents of Eureka are forced to evacuate so many times they must have perpetual whiplash.

What else? Putting a crimp in Jack's family life, his exasperating hippie sister, Lexy, shows up. Eureka gets a new mayor, and it's not Zoe's 17-year-old boyfriend (who did campaign for the job). And a central character dies. Episode 8 - ""From Fear to Eternity"" - reveals the mystery behind Eva Thorne, and is anyone at all surprised that there's a doomsday device in the equation? This isn't even half the season over.

One sort of misses the tame days when the enigmatic Artifact was the big McGuffin. (And, oh yeah, whatever happened to the Artifact?) Maybe we find out in Season 3.5. And maybe we don't. In Eureka, expect the unexpected.

Sarah, the Carters' sassy smart house, continues to be one of my favorite characters.

Of course it would be better for the whole season to be on one boxset but didn't they put this out before the second half premiered?  even if not I wouldn't go less than a three for packaging because A one star review is for something that EVERYTHING is wrong with I think. (not just packaging and lack of a full season)  I love this show and although I want each season on one boxset I can't go less than five stars because this show entertains me immensely.

New to the series, never having seen seasons 1 or 2, I had no idea what to expect, certainly did not know about the influence of the writer's strike a while back. Razzes to the producers for allowing this deceptive packaging. This set goes back for a refund.",1265846400,6,611,4.321739130434783
3842738,5,B00242KD1S,"I was sorry to see the ratings of this incredible funny, fast paced, sometime almost slapstick show brought down by reviewers who are upset because of the split season need to buy the show in two separate, dare I say, tranche.  The reviewers do not address what a great and entertaining series this is.  Although the network runs it at odd times, like 6 months apart, it is well worth the wait for the next season, be it part one or part two.

That said, Eureka takes place in a mythical town financed by the Department of Defense to develop weapons and technology for use in defense as well as the betterment of mankind, however the later use somehow always ends up like a weapon and threatens to blow the town apart.  Jack Carter, the sheriff, is hilarious in his role as the stumbling cop lacking the brilliance of all the Nobel laureates in the town or the understanding of the technology that nearly kills him in each episode, much less his ability to ever pronounce it correctly.  However, in every episode he is the one that puts all the parts together to prevent near Armageddon when the technology runs amok and he saves the day.

His interactions with Zoe, his daughter and the various characters at Global Dynamics are well played and full of subtle and not so subtle irony as this non-technocrat saves the day while the rest of the cast looks like a scatter pattern.  The writers and directors have done a brilliant job of taking something that is borderline science with a lot of fiction and making folly and fodder out of what we would like to think are brilliant ideas and inventions.

There is a serious side to the show that forms the backbone around which all the antics take place.  Season two was the most serious with the death of Henry's wife.  I found some of the episodes to be a bit on the dark side but this was all undone in season three.  Attributing malicious intent from one of the major characters towards Carter and the town just did not work for me.

You see, the first half of season three was plain horrible.

They introduce a new character to run GD and with it she brings the idea to sell advertising rights to companies in which they have their logos supported around town.  Ummm, first of all, wasn't this a SECRET government town?  Why would outside companies even know about Eureka?  Second of all, it was a lame excuse to get product placement in the show.  Now, I can  understand and even support product placement if done well, but this made a Michael Bay movie product placement look subtle by comparison.  They devoted a whole episode to a scenario that could only be resolved by using the special ingredient they had made for Degree Antiperspirant!  Wow, and lame.

3842760,4,B00242KD1S,"Season 3 of Eureka was supposed to be 20-21 episodes but the writers' strike last year messed up the production schedule. The forums on syfy.com have multiple threads talking about how the producers had to get the scripts they had filmed and couldn't finish the season immediately because they ran out of scripts. The actors also had limited windows of commitment, so production was halted for awhile. The season continued in July 2009 with 10 more episodes that just concluded last week.

The first 8 episodes have excellent stories, good chemistry between the actors, and a backing story arc that closes satisfactorily in the 8th episode. Syfy (I hate the new name) should have priced the Season 3.0 DVDs at a percentage of the other full season sets, but I expect them to create another set that combines all 18 episodes anyway. The shows get 5 stars, but the review gets dinged a star because of the pricing. Personally, I'm waiting for six months or so to see if my prediction is correct.

I can only suggest you do as I did and wait until someone puts it on sale. I bought my copy for $12 during a sale on Amazon a few weeks back (a very short sale - the sale price was only up for a few hours) and so don't feel I overpaid. I would not pay full price for this set.

As far as the show itself - it is great. More of the crazy action you have come to expect from Eureka along with great tension and plot lines. If you enjoy off beat stories and being able to escape into a really fun world for a few hours, you should pick up Eureka. The only reason this set doesn't get 5 stars is because of how short it is and the lack of any extras. If not for that, it would merit 5 stars.",1252713600,,960,3.7058823529411766

It does everything right except make you hot chicken soup when you have a cold. I'm very glad that I bought season 3.0, even if it does cost more per episode than seasons 1 & 2. At today's (9/4/09) prices, season 1 costs two seventeen per episode, season 2 is two bucks per episode and season 3.0 costs three twelve per episode. With eight episodes in season 3.0 and a buck twelve more per episode than season 2, you could say that I'm paying eight dollars and ninety six cents more for this box set. Big deal. If I took a friend to the nearest mini shopping center, I could buy us EITHER a good cup of coffee each OR a good beefburger and a glass of water each. While either would doubtless be enjoyable, the enjoyment would be over in an hour (not counting a burp or two from the onions on our burgers). But with a bit of luck, I can enjoy Eureka season 3.0 for the rest of my life and share it with as many friends as I wish. Sounds like a bargain to me. Besides, I want to offer as much encouragement as possible to the upper management suits who decide if any more seasons of Eureka will be offered on dvd, or even if there will be any more seasons.

The website was horrendously slow trying to load some sort of animated something, did not respond at all well to mouse clicks, and even after I finally got to the page regarding the product, it didn't have the info I wanted.

At every turn they try and do something to alienate (no pun intended) their userbase. The only solution is to stop buying their products until they change their behavior.

Shows like this are one of the few reasons I still occasionally watch TV. I will set the recorder for it and buy the season when it comes out on DVD.

The show is centered around a top secret research city in the Pacific Northwest. As when you get a bunch of eggheads together, strange things will happen. The only really normal man in town is the sheriff and its his job to keep it all working.
It has a lot of humanity to it, good stories. But it is also one of those shows you can't sum up in two words like ""crime drama"" and people understand its just another generic cop/CSI style show. It's not anything along those lines. You have comedy, drama, real life issues (teenage daughter) and a host of other things going on in the show.

A running subplot has also been added to season 3.  This subplot consists of the restructuring of Global Dynamics and Eureka.  This made season 3 unappealing to me.

3842810,1,B00242KD1S,"Ah, the irony.

First, like most people here, I'm sick of paying twice for a season of television. Universal Home Video is the only company doing this, and it needs to stop. Their shows are great. Their distribution is embarrassing.

Second, I don't give a flying whatever about my DVD packaging being ""recyclable."" I do, however, care that it does its job, namely, PROTECTING THE DISCS, which these ""green"" packages do not. In fact, for all three sets in the series, the cases are more likely to damage the discs than protect them.

And finally, ""podcast commentaries,"" which are a cost saving rip-off to begin with, in which two writers, who most definitely belong BEHIND the scenes due to their complete lack of personality on screen or in audio and who were not on set at all, simply narrate what is on screen is NOT a commentary. A commentary is meant to contain insights and stories about how the show was made. It is NOT meant to be, ""And now Carter is walking across the room."" Thank you. I didn't know he was walking across the room. Because I'm blind. Which is why I'm watching this show.

Universal needs to step up, start listening to their audience, and start living up to the quality of the shows which they are distributing. A show about geniuses should not be packaged by people who don't understand that a case is meant to keep a disc from being scratched, not scratch the disc itself.

Do not buy this set. If you want to watch it on anything but reruns, get it on iTunes or rent it from Netflix.",1247270400,17,1514,4.490909090909091
3842811,3,B00242KD1S,"Yeah, the packaging is a rip off, but I'm going to focus on the show itself rather than the truncated version here.

The idea of a town full of federally funded super scientists working on ultra cutting edge projects is a pretty decent one. And the cast of this show, while not great, isn't at all bad. The production values are fine.

The problem with the show is that the stories are just a tad too flat and uninteresting. There is an overall arc concerning an alien artifact, but it isn't very compelling. There is the hint of a romantic relationship between the sheriff and a government employee, but it never really gets off the ground. The narrative tentativeness is the biggest problem with the show. It just doesn't get into gear and stays that way.

Ultimately, good writing drives any decent TV show. An executive producer is, after all, really just the head writer. Directors drive movies; writers drive TV. Here the writing lets down the rest of the show. Ultimately it might just be that the show's premise is too limiting. I've watched the show through the part of Season 3 that has been broadcast so far. The show gets marginally better and we come to like many of the characters. But the show never overcomes the core weakness of the writing. Though I retain hopes that it eventually will.",1247097600,,1305,4.616379310344827
3842812,5,B00242KD1S,"Due to the writers' strike two years ago, all scripted shows were unfortunately shortened, resulting in seasons where it was months between new episodes. For some shows, the wait was too long and some were eventually cancelled due to poor ratings.

Luckily, for fans of Eureka, the creators simply split the season into two parts; an eight episode arc, which aired last July, and the second one, which premieres this July. The result is a longer season spread over two years, much like Battlestar Galactica. Some may call the upcoming episodes Season Four, but it's technically the second half of Season 3.

In any event, the first half of Season 3 is now out on DVD, just in time for the premiere of the remaining season. And while short on episodes, the show was at the top of it's game this season. I don't know about you, but to me this show is like comfort food. I love the characters and I love the world they inhabit. A perfect cast led by Colin Ferguson get the most out of the sometimes unbelievable situations. I won't go into the whole story arc, suffice to say that there is a new arrival in Eureka, who harbors a big secret about the town's past. And as the saying goes, out with old and in with the new, as SPOILER ALERT! a regular cast member departs midway through.

So while it might be frustrating to only have eight episodes here (and I watched all of them in one afternoon!), I personally prefer quality over quantity. My only grief with this set is a lack of an episode guide. That, and it would have been great to have the musical promo they did before the first episode last year! It was terrific and it's kind of a tease that they mention it in the music featurette and show a clip of it too, but not the whole thing. That's only a small complaint, because really the episodes are what it's all about and I absolutely recommend picking this up!",1247011200,36,1868,4.424418604651163

So I ordered Season 1.  And then Season 2.  And a couple minutes ago, after watching the episodes back-to-back, I finished season 3.

What a great find this show is!  Ensemble shows, well executed, are a special treat.  The actors of Eureka have excellent chemistry with one another, each and every one of them.  These are terrific characters making the most of the unique and fascinating premise behind the town and there is a good balance between stand-alone stories and continuing arcs.

At first glance on TV, Eureka seemed a bit goofy for my tastes.  I watch few TV shows.  Favorites of the past decade have been The X-Files, Battlestar Gallactica, Lost and Jericho.  Epic, even dark, shows.  What Eureka has in common with these shows is a cast that you cannot help but care about as they come to care about one another.  Eureka is an extraordinary town populated by extraordinary people and that makes for compelling television.

Considering what going to a film costs, less than $20 for several hours of this fantastic show is a tremendous bargain.  And all the Season DVDs have a lot of deleted scenes that are interesting to watch.  It's so great to discover a show that's already got a couple seasons out on DVD.

3842824,1,B00242KD1S,Amazon should refuse to market this rip-off. $19.99 for only 8 episodes. The manufacturer should be ashamed of themselves for trying to market this swindle.,1244246400,17,156,5.28
3842825,5,B00242KD1S,"i think this is all of ""season 3"" from last summer.  because of the writer's strike, there were only 8 episodes and the minutes add up.  as far as the show goes; not my favorite season, but much more fun than some of the stuff on tv.  pretty family friendly, too, for scifi these days.  i have bought all the seasons, and we watch them repeatedly.",1242864000,2,347,4.212121212121212
3842826,2,B00242KD1S,"I'm so tried of TV series being broke up, why with a show like Eureka which has so few episodes. I'm done watching this series and buying the seasons.",1242864000,10,150,4.206896551724138
3842827,5,B00242KD1S,"Yeah, it's a bummer abut the half season. But, you have to remember the writer's strike and they want to get the old episodes out there before new ones start up again. I'm almost positive they won't do that with season 4. Besides, Amazon's selling this for 19 bucks, and if the second part is 19 bucks, that's less than 40 for a whole season of hour long episodes. That's normal price, even cheaper than a lot of seasons of shows on DVD.

What's to say about the show? Full of wonder and a charming atmosphere. I'm happy the DVD's are coming out and happy new episodes start in July.",1242518400,12,583,4.3
3842828,1,B00242KD1S,"I absolutely agree with the comments I've seen that the burgeoning trend in issuing ""versions"" of these shows is insulting.  I enjoy the show and have purchased seasons 1 and 2.  I was looking forward to purchasing season 3 as well, but will absolutely not purchase in two installments, paying twice as much.  If I can get season 3 as one package for a similar price as 1 and 2, I'm in.  Until then, I can catch reruns!!!  Hopefully enough people will agree and hold off - maybe the distributors will get the message!",1242518400,151,517,4.457446808510638
3842829,5,B00242KD1S,"We finally 'gave in' and watched a EUREKA marathon.  Too bad we didn't sign on to this one from the start.  We were hooked in the first 5 minutes and were SO-O-O-O trying not to do that with yet another fine Sci-Fi original series!

Seasons 1 and 2 are on their way from Amazon so we can catch up.  That means we're watching it backwards.  The marathon was the first half of Season 3!

Assuming the entire season will be available in one set, eventually.  If not, I agree ... not playing that game. We can stop our collection at Season 2, difficult as that will be.

UPDATE 6-4-2013:  We waited until the show ended and were able to purchase 3.0 and 3.5 at a very good price.  Have the entire series, now.  Worth it :->",1242518400,7,719,4.213235294117647

8350145,1,B00242KD1S,"The show is great and the product came just fine.  However, be INCREDIBLY careful what you purchase.  This is 8 episodes of a 18 episode season.  You have to purchase Season 3.5 to get the rest.  Don't waste you money, as Amazon also has a ""Season 3"" disc that's less than half the cost of the 3.0 and 3.5 versions.  That isn't clear whatsoever in the descriptions.  I suggest a hard pass on this and just get the full thing for cheaper.",1499644800,,437,4.2682926829268295
