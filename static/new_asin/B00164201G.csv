8260725,4,B00164201G,"This disc, recorded in 2005, presents an interesting program of music featuring Heinz Holliger, the renowned oboist, who is joined by the Keller Quartet plus Robert Kolinsky on piano and Carolina Eyck on theremin - an electronic instrument.

There is an interesting 12 minute introduction and explanation to this disc as a bonus which is well worth watching first as well as information in the booklet which is also worth reading first. The actual recording is of good quality with clear visuals and sympathetic camera work which is revealing without being intrusive or too busy. The sound is excellent and is presented in DTS 5.1, DD 5.1 and stereo. The screen aspect is 16:9

The challenge of the Mozart quartet, as explained by Holliger, is mainly one of playing the notes. Mozart wrote the music for the oboe expecting a performer of considerable technical accomplishment, even for today's players. This is a challenge in both range and dexterity for the player. Needless to say, this performance falls well within the musical and technical capabilities of the players and this is a very satisfying experience with little challenge for the viewer.

Britten provides different challenges and this time the challenge is one for the viewer as well as for the players. Holliger is careful to outline the shape of this early composition which starts as a quiet march building to a climax. This stops abruptly for a more complex central section before returning to the opening march idea but played in reverse order dynamically. The string textures in the outer sections are intriguing or interesting but the central section may be more demanding to follow for some viewers.

The unaccompanied sonata in 4 movements for oboe by Holliger himself is an early composition written at the age of 17. In this Holliger attempts to display the 'soul or mind' of the oboe and this is clearly a work of great technical demand or challenge for the player. It is quite obvious that Holliger was very advanced in these ways at that age and when he revised the work in 1999 he did not feel the need to make major alterations. The listening experience is really quite challenging and is likely to appeal to oboists most of all. The form is loosely based on the Baroque concept of a solo sonata as in Bach for instance. However, the musical content is rather more austere to follow for the non specialist.

The final piece by Martinu adds the piano and the theremin to the previous players. The theremin is listed first and is, indeed, the main focus of attention both visually and musically. The instrument is an electronic device which is able to play single lines of notes at various volumes and precise pitches. The sounds are produced by the player manipulating electrical currents with hand movements which do not physically touch any part of the instrument. Visually it looks, as Holliger suggests, as if the instrument is played by witch-like hand movements. The sound of this 1945 device is a precursor of modern electronic instruments not unlike those heard in the early 'Doctor Who' TV science fiction signature tune and it would be easy to imagine it being used in that sort of way even today. The piano is used in a way that will be familiar to those who know the Martinu symphonies. Essentially this is lyrical music and thus less of a challenge for the viewer.

I would suggest that this disc offers fine playing and recording of a program that is challengingly interesting. Oboe fanciers will find this 'Fantasy' of more immediate interest than general listeners. Beyond that there may also be enough of general interest to attract those willing to explore a disc rightly entitled 'Oboe Fantasy.'",1376179200,,3694,4.864864864864865
