8158274,3,B000KN7BVS,"It's OK...but it is not the video I pick up most frequently.  I wish that more  Nadia Osipova ballets were available on video.  There are some DVDs that are due to come out.  On going to a website on Osipova...she does a lot of ballets that could be put on a video...multiple videos.  She did a French Can Can one..maybe, a ballet that is not too long.  She has a lot of new stuff out.  The ballet, Russian Ballet Highlights is getting a bit old, I believe.

The Royal Ballet of Great Britian...selected acts of their popular ballets.  Now, that would be great.",1433116800,,561,4.368932038834951

8158277,5,B000KN7BVS,"Excellent historical footage. Excellent camera work allowing ballet afficianados the chance to see 1980s stars at close range. Also interesting for Western audiences unfamiliar with Russian repertoire not normally seen in the West such as ""Spring Waters"" - although the performance here is not as good as these dancers normally produced. On the other hand - an excellent example of Michaelchenko's and Alexei Fadeev's work - of which there is little of which is available on video/DVD. Well worth buying.",1178496000,15,504,5.3125
