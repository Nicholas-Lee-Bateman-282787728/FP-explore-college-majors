7420699,1,B014RDS6QA,"Disappointed . . . Very ! ! !  This is a documentary with some concert footage intermixed. In fact, of the songs that are live, most are interrupted or at least cut short by interviews. It's a regular ""love fest"" with band members all ranting about how fantastic everyone is. This was on my wish list and I put it there expecting to go back to read the description prior to ordering. Unfortuneatly, very unfortunately, someone purchased it for me as a gift. I nearly finishing it in the first viewing. Other than that, it will take up a spot on my rack of 280 concert videos and look pretty there.

On another note, I see reviews from an earlier release that is the same format. Is the band that afraid to release a concert uncut from beginning to end? Seems like they are uncomfortable with their ability to hold an audience other than with the in person hype.",1450569600,,861,4.408805031446541
7420700,1,B014RDS6QA,"I totally agree with all reviewers who appreciated that one star (*) is more than enough for this product. Clearly, the gig looks like being filmed on  8 mm old format and recast for widescreen. Obtrusively grainy and, apart from Lenny's monologue on top of a building, light is too low. Sound is good but dynamics seems compressed for a live performance. Every now and than you may realize that Lenny and his group are great, but close your eyes. Technically, is the worst BD I've ever purchased from Amazon. Including shipment, I have just thrown away $21. The best I can do is to extract the soundtrack on a CD and change the destination of the case for a better stuff, while the disc may be gone with the wind.  Unless Lenny himself wanted such fancy pepper-like image. Take care!",1449964800,,784,4.553191489361702

7420703,4,B014RDS6QA,"I always enjoy listening to Lenny's music. Seeing him discussing, interacting and showing moments of his and his band's  life on the road, was exciting for me to watch.",1448236800,5,168,4.793103448275862
7420704,5,B014RDS6QA,"He still can deliver a great show, every song is a classic. even his new music is great. He works really hard for his fans and the dvd shows all that. Thanks for this!",1447459200,,167,3.9411764705882355
7420705,5,B014RDS6QA,"What a great concert DVD!  Love the interview footage of Lenny and the band members and how it's woven in between the concert footage.  Top notch, professionally-shot concert footage.  Love it!",1446595200,3,193,5.161290322580645
7420706,3,B014RDS6QA,"For die hard Lenny Kravitz fans, it will be nice to have him on Blu-ray.  However, be warned, this concert is filmed, not shot in 4K, giving it a grainy documentary quality, not the High Def 1080p resolution many of us crave.  As well, the audio is just OK, it does not take advantage of its DTS MasterHD potential, sounding compressed and too dry for a live event, with no sense of the hall acoustics, and a closed off 70's feeling soundtrack.  That may be what Lenny wanted it to sound and look like.  Also too much documentary footage so the music does not flow from one song to the next, making it hard to get into musically.  The worst part is the image grain, hi def TV fans will not like that, regardless of what Lenny was thinking, its not more artful, its just bad looking.",1446422400,13,782,4.292517006802721
7420707,5,B014RDS6QA,"I was blessed to have seen Lenny Kravitz in concert in Dallas, Tx in January 2015. Watching this DVD brought back memories of being at his concert. Lenny has an amazing band full of very talented individuals and if you ever get the chance to see them do it! They put on a great show, full of energy and passion. ""Let it Go"" gives you a look into how they work and play and stay together. There's a lot of coolness in this group of musicians. Lenny is a focused leader who has learned to trust and his band hasn't let him down. I'd say there's a whole lot of magic going on.",1445990400,6,573,4.079646017699115

7420722,3,B014RDS6QA,"This disc does not deserve a Blu-ray label. I was going to give this disc one star. However, the performance was great. Don't use the DTS HD MA setting. Set the audio on the Blu-ray to stereo and on your receiver  set it to DTS NEO 6 MUSIC. Now the sound was four stars.",1462924800,3,270,4.0

7420725,5,B014RDS6QA,"If you love Lenny, you'll love this!! It's refreshing to see him speak on his talents and hear his band mates speak about him. I personally like how raw and imperfect it is quality wise. It makes me appreciate his authenticity that much more. I saw him live on this ""Strut"" tour and watching this was like reliving the experience. #LetLoveRule",1456358400,,343,4.639344262295082
7420726,2,B014RDS6QA,"I was veryfisspointedwith this BD. Lenny performs well but he left out many of my favorite tunes from what I believe robe his greatest albulm by a long shot ""Mama Said"". Why no ""Fields of Joy"" and others?
 My biggest disappoint is the sound quality. While it is clean it is not truly hi-resolution that I expect from a dts sound format. It sounds like it was recorded with a camcorder. Shame on you Mr Kravitz! Better sound quality allows your find art to shine through. You dumb-downed your art. Music is meant to be heard as realisticly as possible. Please sir, come out with a DVD-Audio or blu~ray audio of Mama Said.",1456185600,,620,4.486725663716814

I would rate it a 3. Not having been a big fan of Lenny Kravitz, I am now. I enjoyed the concert footage very much.",1468454400,,279,4.185185185185185
