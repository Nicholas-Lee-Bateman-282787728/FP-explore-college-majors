8115261,5,B000EXDRR6,This movie is well worth seeing.  Clive Owen is terrific in his role.  The story is interesting (although sad at times) and kept this viewer's full attention from start to finish.  I recommend this movie.,1427241600,,204,4.771428571428571
8115262,4,B000EXDRR6,It is an older film but ok. I am ailsa Clive Owens daughter in this (girl with bunches) was a fun set to film on and Clive Owen and Helen Mcgrory are very nice to work with.,1349740800,4,173,3.7027027027027026
8115263,3,B000EXDRR6,"I love Clive Owen, and my daugher and I love British productions, so for her birthday I selected this movie.  It was not memorable, but satisfying.  It was a 5 out of 10, but Clive Owen is always worth watching.",1258675200,4,211,4.25
