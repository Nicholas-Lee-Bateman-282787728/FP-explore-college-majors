8170768,3,B000LMPJAI,"This movie is a real treat despite its occasionally heavy-handed preaching (and at least it is preaching I can agree with!). First, it has lovely music by Ravi with lyrics by Sahir Ludhianvi (including one of my first favorite Hindi film songs, the Rafi classic ""Yeh Wadiyan Yeh Fizayen""); second, it has a young and *very sparkly* Tanuja; and third, it is set against an historic backdrop --the annexation of individual princely states by the new Indian government. It's a film typical of star Sunil Dutt in its idealism and progressive message, and if Nanda is a little weepy for my taste in it she is balanced out by Tanuja. Ashok Kumar is the Maharajah their father, a strict and conservative man who is determined to keep his kingdom and privileged lifestyle intact. Somehow the internet got the idea that Raaj Kumar is in it too, but he is nowhere to be seen although someone named Rajkumar appears in the lesser credits.",1304812800,,927,4.728395061728395
