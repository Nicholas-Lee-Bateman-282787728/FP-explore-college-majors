6667213,5,B00NLZA9K2,"Who couldn't love the good Dr. Pol?  He is magic with animals, better than Dr. Dolittle any day.",1430265600,,96,4.333333333333333
6667214,5,B00NLZA9K2,"This BlueRay is perfect for those times when there is nothing interesting on TV!  A hit on National Geographic Wild!,  Dr. Pol and his team are a very interesting veterinary team treating people's animals with compassion,  care and respect.  This is real.  A rabbit going to the county fair, or perhaps a goat?  A cow with calving problems?  A miniature horse that doesn't want to be vaccinated?  A plow horse with sunburn- they're all here!  Dr Pol and  his staff treat them all!  And, if its busy enough, Dr. Pol might not notice that a surprise 70th birthday party is being planned for him!  The perfect thing to watch on a rainy day!!",1429574400,2,638,4.548672566371682
6667215,5,B00NLZA9K2,"If you like the country life or wanted to be a veterinarian growing up like we all did, you'll enjoy this.  I live on a farm and it was very interesting to me.  Bought a copy for my father-in-law for his birthday.",1428969600,,213,4.0476190476190474

8679040,5,B00NLZA9K2,"Right up there with James Herriot.  Love watching the Pols.  Only problem is that is does not have a menu to let you start the show on 1, 2, 3 etc.  You have to fast forward all the way until you get to the place you left off.  It doesn't even stop when you get to the end of one session.  Shame on National Geographic.  They should have done a better job.",1480291200,,356,3.875
