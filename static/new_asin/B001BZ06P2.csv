8285307,5,B001BZ06P2,"My niece got this when she was about 20 months old, and she loved it immediately. Four months later, she still begs for it three plus times a day! We often dance along with her (even Grandpa and a great uncle!), and it's a terrific workout. She masters a little more each week, but we're just glad she enjoys it so much. She does parts of the dances even the video is nowhere in sight. There are definitely worse things to be hooked on! It has been perfect to spend her energy over the winter.

We've accumulated other Bella Dancerella videos since, but this one is still the favorite. It has the right mix of movie snippets to
stimulate the imagination, a little instruction at the tricky parts, and pleasant songs that encourage free movement. 'Pounce or Scurry' was the first one she could do completely, and it's great that they mixed in dances that would appeal to varied age levels.

As another reviewer said, don't worry if you don't have the mat or wands! We've also made our own dusters and wands from things around the house.",1363564800,3,1035,4.5
8285308,5,B001BZ06P2,"My girls love this video (ages 3 and almost 6)!  The songs are catchy and the types of dance are varied (ballet, charleston, waltz, and just fun movements).  It is not very accurate instruction for ballet technique, but it gets the girls moving and expressing themselves through dance, so it's great for beginners or for just having fun.  They love watching the bits of Cinderella videos in there, too - I think it helps them relate and pretend.  One of the segments that is their favorite is the one with Lucifer the cat and the mice... ""what'll it be? Pounce? or scurry?""  It is really fun watching them jump and pounce, and then scurry around like mice!

We do not have the dance mat or the various wands and ribbons they use in the video, but that doesn't matter. My kids tied a piece of ribbon to a toothbrush!",1317168000,8,815,4.436241610738255
