2269244,4,B00097DY6G,"this series is one of my favorites, and would get 5 stars except that the narrator samuel west is just ok. the history channels version is almost exact word for word but has a different narrator whom i don't know his name but he's done other H.C. programs as well. his narration voice is much more compelling and when i thought i bought that version (not realizing there were 2) i was disappointed. i really didn't like it as much. also in the bbc version there are subtitles for the translation of the german and russian interviews, as the american version uses a german and russian translator to translate with much better effect. this one with sam west narrating gets 4 stars and the History Channel version gets 5. if you can find the H.C. version get it. if not this series is still well worth owning.",1172793600,8,806,4.489795918367347
2269245,4,B00097DY6G,"Whenever I think of the Second World War, the two places I usually think about in terms of carnage is the Eastern Front; and the war between Nazi Germany and Soviet Russia. The other is the Pacific Campaign between the USA and Japan. One of the reviewers wrote, ""I'm glad the Russian Won."" So am I. And what a bloody war it was. The number of casualties and amount of destruction make what occurred in the others parts of the globe [except Asia] seem pale in comparison. The Russians suffered greatly at the hands of the Germans, and the German army paid one hell of a steep price.

Also, it was in the east where the Germans committed some of the most horrendous atrocities known to mankind. It was in the east where extermination camps were set up to murder millions of Jews: The German  program of the 'Final Solution.' Everything I have ever read about the  Second World War concerning the eastern front is one of brutality on a scope that is horrifically mind-boggling. It's as if life were cheap and each day may have been the last. This documentary does a very decent job in attempting to address the fighting between these two armies. From Barbarossa to Berlin, it is one of the best documenatries out there. At least for the 200 minutes that the film devotes to the eastern front. I don't believe this is the definitive documentary, as more and more information is being released now that the Soviet Union is no more. But for now, I highly recommend this film.

2269246,4,B00097DY6G,"This is a great stand alone eastern front documentary.  If you are looking for a solid overview of the eastern front, this is your documentary.  In America we skip the battle in the east and focus on the west, for obvious reasons.  This documentary is worth your time.  Great interviews.  Get past the fact that this documentary was produced by the BBC.",1158278400,8,353,4.629032258064516
2269247,2,B00097DY6G,"I bought this documentary expecting fairly in-depth coverage of the Eastern Front along the lines of World at War with a lot of good footage showing troops and battles.  But I was definitely disappointed.  I think the BBC does not do war documentaries very well.  (I have another WWI DVD set from them which is equally bad.)

Whoever gathered together the archival film did a cursory and shallow job.  I have a DVD set on WWI called Trenches with a greater quantity of footage than this.  I think this is downright embarrassing for the makers of this film, considering how much WWII footage is out there.  Additionally, the editing together of film clips and interviews is poorly done.  Clips are shown in strange fits and starts, and the transitions between interviews and footage is not very smooth.  In general, it jumps around too much.  Both the overdubbed sounds and the soundtrack, which is usually inappropriate/out-of-place string music, are barely listenable.  And something about the narration I just find annoying.

I detest the way many of the interviews are done in this series.  Several of the interviewees say to their interviewers statements similar to ""Why are you looking at me that way?"" or ""Don't call me a murderer.""  Instead of being impartial, the interviewers seem to be passing judgement on people's actions that happened 50 years ago and in a time of absolute war that is practically unimaginable today.  I think this type of moralizing from the interviewers is a detestable tactic; the interviewer has no right to pass judgement on the subject.  This happens enough to be a noticeable detriment, and it detracts from the quality of the interviews.  Additionally, the interviewers questions are interspersed much too frequently with the interviewees comments.  Documentaries work best when the interviewers comments are kept to a minimum and the questions are impartial.  This series seems to fall flat in both respects.  There is too much emotion and too much judgemental preaching from the interviewers, which is an entirely unprofessional way to conduct interviews.

There is a lot of wasted time and footage, i.e. filler.  For instance, we see at least several minutes of opera excerts on a particular section about Stalin.  This is practically farsical, as one section shows the opera without narration.  How much more irrelavant could it get?  I do not care that this was Stalin's favorite opera.  The singing isn't even in English, so it isn't understandable to the target audience and thus carries no information content.  There are loads of examples of this.  Instead of showing battlefield footage or an interview, several sections on major battles have a voiceover and show the battlefield as it exists today, in an attempt to be ""evocative"".  Well, sorry, this is not evocative.  It is poor film-making.  The #1 cardinal rule of documentary TV is that if you do not have either an interviewee or actual footage of an event, it should not be covered.  (Obviously, it doesn't hold for time periods or events before the advent of television.)  It does not matter that this was the site of the battle.  All the buildings are different, and nothing remains from that time period.  It is okay to show battlefields in a film like The Civil War, where original footage is non-existent. ( Also, these battlefields were much more compact, so it is illustrative to show, for instance, the site of Pickett's Charge.)  But it is practically irrelevant to show a few headstones in a village when discussing Operation Bagration, because it actually ranged over hundreds if not thousands of miles.

One particularly poor section has a long (~2 minutes) narration with the camera pointed at the moon.  Even panning over still photographs would have been superior to showing the night sky, as this adds nothing to the film what-so-ever.  I can read a John Erickson book and look out my window if I want this.  I watch documentaries for the firsthand interviews and actual footage, both of which are poorly done in this series.

The overall quality of this documentary is just mediocre.  I have seen most (> 50%) of the footage elsewhere.  And the depth of the coverage is extremely shallow.  I learned practically nothing from it, though I am certainly no expert on the Eastern Front.  The best section is probably the coverage of atrocities against civilians, because the interviews are very good.  But none of the other sections stood out at all.  The episode on Barbarossa was particularly bereft of good footage, considering how much high quality film exists of this operation just on the German side.  There is zero coverage in some areas, like the Crimea.

There are much better documentaries on the Eastern Front out there, though unfortunately none that are standalone like this one.  In particular, the Big Battles of World War II DVD set has several excellent episodes on the Eastern Front, particularly the episodes on Barbarossa and Stalingrad, which are classics.  Even The Century of Warfare, which covers the entire 20th century, has better footage than this.  I would steer clear of War of the Century.  It certainly isn't the documentary of the century.",1144627200,33,5191,4.9825378346915015
2269248,5,B00097DY6G,"It war of the twentieth century was fought in the Eastern Front.  In terms of scale of men involved and in casualities, the Western Front pales in comparison.  The man who did the most to defeat Adolph Hitler was not F.D. Roosevelt or Winston Churchill but Joseph Stalin.

This BBC documentary is very valuable because, being developed only a few years ago, it incorporates new, unclassified material.  Although his secret agents told Stalin about a massive invasion on June 1941, Stalin did not believe it.  So he made no plan for a possible attack from Germany.  When operation Barbarrossa was launched, it took the Red Army by surprise.  This documentary, unlike any other that I know of, shows that Stalin tried to negociate peace with Hitler --although to no avail.

The interviews in this documentary are also very moving: a general urging his son to take his leave befor the declacle of Stalingrad, a woman from the secret organization of SMERSCH candidly telling she would be considered a mass murderer in the West after carrying out orders to assassinate prisoners of war, a partisan guerrilla leader admitting he and his men did not take prisoners, and so forth.  Perhaps, the most shocking detail of the documentary was the revelation that, at Stalingrad, the average life expenctancy of a Soviet soldier was merely 24 hours.

The documentary is impeccably edited.",1125187200,66,1375,4.965065502183406
2269249,4,B00097DY6G,"I first saw this on the History Channel several years ago and was quite impressed. There aren't enough WW2 documentaries on the eastern front and this one sheds new light on several areas of the conflict. For example, newly-declassified Soviet documents shown in this film prove that secret ""peace talks"" between Soviet and German officials did in fact take place and furthur more, evidence is shown that Stalin had refused to believe that Hitler would ever invade the Soviet Union after their peace pact was signed in 1939.

There is incredible footage shown of Barbarossa, including rare color scenes which I'd never scene before. Of course, famous battles like Stalingrad and Leningrad are covered, but I wish there'd been more coverage of lesser-known battles. But there's only so much you can show in 200 minutes. There are very interesting interviews with Russian and German soldiers and civilians, each one telling of their experiences in the brutal conflict in which millions lost their lives. Several of the veterans, both Russian and German, admit to killing innocent civilians and executing prisoners (one even says ""What else could we do?"").

The segment on the fall of Berlin was one of the most compelling in my opinion. One Russian veteran admitted that rival Russian units were competing to see who could take over the capitol first, and they even shot at each other! And of course, German civilians tell of the many rapes and murders committed by the Russian troops as they sought vengeance on the German population. On the other hand, Russian civilians tell of the many executions committed by the Germans, especially the feared SS units. Overall, I'd say that this documentary is one of the better ones on the eastern front and is recommended for both the novice and the historian.",1116288000,56,1800,4.996666666666667

2269307,4,B00097DY6G,"Most English-language accounts of the war on the Eastern Front tend to focus on the German brutalities, racism, and scorched earth policy - but in this one there is some discussion about the Soviet side. Interviews with participants include frank accounts of committing or witnessing atrocities, some express regrets, others are unapologetic. One thing that the doc lacks is a sense of historical perspective. Yes, the Germans set out on a war of extermination based on a very extreme racial policy; but Germans engaging in this sort of warfare war a relatively new phenomena, for the Russians/Soviets it was not. Russia was always a particularly repressive state, its imperial expansion during the previous centuries was made possible by exactly this kind of warfare. During the First World War, the Russians treated German and Austro-Hungarian prisoners in a barbaric manner; and during the interwar period this topic was the subject of numerous books in the German speaking world. The fighting in the immediate post-war period was extremely ruthless, and the Stalinist regime was of course murdering millions of its own people. Among them were hundreds of thousands of ethnic Germans. Does it justify Hitler or what he set out to do? No, but it did contribute to his rise to power - but I know, to acknowledge this fact is to risk being labeled ""revisionism."" And as usual with subtitles - at least those for the Germans - there are mistranslations and lost nuances (and not necessarily due to space or timing).",1369958400,2,1514,5.035856573705179
2269308,5,B00097DY6G,"This is a really nice piece by the BBC about the Eastern Front - the war between Nazi Germany and the USSR. It really took the collapse of the Iron Curtain and a few years for Western researchers to get at the old Soviet archives for some of this story to be told from other than 30,000 feet. It is beautifully done from a technical point of view. And the story is pretty good too. I am very familiar with the history of the Eastern Front. A lot of folks are not. So they may be more forgiving  - even unaware - of the short thrift  that is given to the rest of the story post-Stalingrad, but I noticed. And that is my chief criticism of this program. The producers spend the first 2/3 of the show going into very good detail about the war and then suddenly after Stalingrad we hit a couple of brief stops and find ourselves in Berlin! You know, a lot happened in the remaining 2 years & 3 months after the Battle of Stalingrad! But that criticism aside, I think most folks - familiar or not - will find the program to be very good, very informative and a good value.

What a sorry species we are. The most destructive and deadly conflict in history, ignited and fueled by racial and economic theories that should have been easily refuted and dismissed by anyone with a decent grade school education, and yet resulting in such indescribable suffering by so many innocent people. Given the history of the last century it is unbelievable that there are any people at all who still think that the answer to every problem is bigger, more centralized, more powerful, more intrusive government. It is a pleasure to watch these two monstrous and hideous nations fight each other so furiously. In a just world neither Germany nor the Soviet Union would have survived.

However, there is a lot of filler like another reviewer mentioned, that could have been devoted to covering other battles.  One of the most crucial omissions I found, is the complete lack of information about the battle of Kursk.  This I cannot accept, because Kursk was one the the most important battles on that front, second only to Stalingrad.  It was the last great German offensive, the largest tank battle in history, and ended once and for all any prospect of a German victory in the east, which baffles me why there isn't so much as a mention of it in this series.",1316390400,5,829,4.581081081081081

They have been mining the formerly classified Soviet archives for decades providing a much more balanced view of this colossal struggle than the many German-focused accounts of the fighting.  Another unique aspect of this series is that, although it does a very good job of describing in broad strokes military operations over the course of the war, the series also emphasizes the horror and destruction for soldiers, POWs, and civilians alike that were the result of Hitler's and Stalin's ruthlessness in fighting this conflagration.  The series devotes an entire episode describing the violent chaos that occurred behind German lines due to partisan acts and German reprisals from the perspective of the participants and those caught in the middle between the two, and sometimes three sides (I am including such groups as the Ukrainian Insurgent Army (UPA) here).  It also has some of the most candid interviews from the survivors of the war that I have ever seen, especially from the individuals who served in KGB and SS units.  In some cases, I do not understand how some people who are interviewed had not died in the aftermath of the war. In one case, a Ukrainian student had been a translator for the Germans seeing them when they arrived as liberators from Communist oppression.  He later turned against them due to their treatment of the populace but instead of joining the Soviet partisans, he became a member of the UPA who the Soviets ruthlessly hunted down after the war.  Another Russian interviewee had been captured early in the war and had spent the remainder of the war in a German POW camp where the Soviet prisoners where generally left to starve to death.  After the war, Stalin sent the surviving POWs, despite their weakened states, to the Gulag reasoning that they must have collaborated with the Germans in order to have survived these death camps.  Obviously, this series is not for the faint hearted.

Also a neat aspect was the interviews with SS, Heer, and Red Army soldiers who didn't hold back what they really think of each other or the orders they gave.

2269329,4,B00097DY6G,"While War of the Century (""WOTC"") is limited in scope to ""just"" the German v. Russian fronts, it one of the best documentaries ever produced in regards to the mentality of World War II.  In that respect, it far exceeds the BBC's epic ""The World at War.""  Moreover, WOTC manages to accomplish this in a mere four installments of 45-min episodes.

As others have said, this WOTC is riveting, moving, and wholly unsettling.  There is brutally frank discussion about the extremes to which war drives people.  Ex German and Russian soldiers talk about how, and why, they killed members of their own armies and innocent by-standers.  Civilians, and soldiers, talk about their roles in murder, cannibalism, rape, torture, racism, and total destruction of the ""enemy"" (who is often hard to define at certain times).

In Apocalypse Now Col. Kurtz says, ""It's impossible for words to describe what is necessary to those who do not know what horror means. Horror. Horror has a face ... and you must make a friend of horror. Horror and moral terror are your friends. If they are not, then they are enemies to be feared.""  WOTC, through startling personal accounts, brings the stark reality of WWII right in to the comfort of your cozy living room.  While disturbing, it is a story everyone should hear.

I think others on here who have reviewed this effort as ""too simplistic"" miss the point of this production. IMHO, the main take-away from WOTC is not an in-depth factual account of the eastern front strategy.  That has been done elsewhere.  Rather, WOTC's main focus is much deeper.

2269331,5,B00097DY6G,"When I think of the War on the EASTERN FRONT--of the TOTAL war waged between the German and Russian peoples from 1941 to 1945--I draw up a fantastic image in my mind's eye:

I see a panoramic landscape of melancholic chaos. The dark winter sky, illuminated by roaring artillery fire, and the rolling Russian steppe lands, littered with the burning hulks of destroyed tanks, and the earth drenched in the cogealing blood of tens of millions of dead soldiers and civilians.

This is what Laurence Rees' WAR OF THE CENTURY brings to light for those interested in gaining a general but intriguing understanding of the Russo-German conflict during the Second World War. What this documentary may lack in breadth of subject (i.e., blow-by-blow logistical order of battle info for each facet of the Eastern Front), the BBC production certainly makes up for in presenting primary sources: actual first-hand accounts and interviews from those Germans and Russians who were there.

Having watched this fascinating documentary several times now, I still take some new bit of insight or knowledge away with me after each new viewing. And for me, the most important revelation to me thus far regarding the Eastern Front War would have to be this:

Such conflicts of high atrocity and cruelty will continue to arise so long as selfish individuals, or gangs of selfish individuals--in positions of power--perpetuate them.

The war between Russia and Germany was essentially a war waged between Adolf Hitler/Nazi Party and Josef Stalin/Communist Party in an effort for each entity to secure their own greedy ambitions. Reinforced by strongly established military/para-military states, and the fact that two directly opposite socio-political ideologies could not be allowed to exist together (Nazism versus Bolshevism), the Soviet Union and the Third Reich were pre-ordained to clash to the death with each other.

HIGHLY RECOMMENDED DOCUMENTARY!! NOT TO BE MISSED!!!",1192752000,27,1950,5.274193548387097
2269332,4,B00097DY6G,"What the viewer must has in mind when he chooses this documentary film, is that it is not a complete history of the war in the Eastern Front and it doesn't attempt to be one either. The footage is good and the interviews with the old warriors from both sides are very impressive and, at times, really chilling. Of course the interviewers try many times to ""teach"" the German veterans that they should feel guilty for what they did many years ago, but this is not so annoying because it gives us the chance to watch the old men's reactions and excuses. One of the four episodes is devoted to the attrocities commited by both sides and especially during the partisan operations and has some surprises for those who think that only the Germans did barbarous acts. A good film which manages to bring the atmosphere of the 1941-45 war to the modern viewer, without delving into endless and monotonous details.",1192406400,7,904,4.62111801242236
2269333,5,B00097DY6G,"The lack of remorse is scary. Excellent films, the reporters ask some tough questions and get some cold blooded answers. Even handed presentation of how both sides veiwed and thought about the war and each other. As with most of these films some new footage some old, but it's all fascinating.",1184976000,3,293,4.764705882352941

8058007,5,B00097DY6G,"I have a high interest in documentaries and books on The Great Patriotic War in Russia. I must have read dozens of books and Watched every Documentary out there. The War of the Century is the perfect titled for this amazing work. Seldom do any works out there dig as deep as this one has.  Laurence Rees has really done his best here, unearthing details that would have been lost to time if not for him. This was a war like no other in History just in the loss of human life not even taking into account Human suffering. Here you will find FACTS that have been hidden away in Russia for over 60 years. German soldiers openly admitting they killed without feeling,took all the food and livestock from villages leaving nothing then burning it to the ground because Russian's were subhuman.  Partisan guerrillas admitting they did not take prisoners, killed fellow Russians at the hint of helping Germans and robbed their own people. This the BEST out there bar none.",1494201600,2,964,4.631578947368421

Because after Kursk, the Germans were no longer able to mount any kind of strategic offensive action for the rest of the war on the Eastern Front. But otherwise, the DVD was excellent.",1448064000,,309,4.254237288135593

 Contains material I had not seen before and supplied insights that gave a clarity to what happened. At 200 minutes it covers a lot of the major story, my only criticism is that I wanted another 200 minutes (or more). This may be the last-best telling of what was the worst story in the war. This should be part of everyone's knowledge of WW2 history.",1442707200,,411,4.394736842105263
