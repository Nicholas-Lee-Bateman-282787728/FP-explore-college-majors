7368532,3,B013P0X1MU,"I had heard such bad things about this entry in the franchise but decided to watch for myself. I thought it delivered the goods. Jennifer Hils the survivor from the first film has assumed a new identity as a woman named Angela .

Angela go's to a rape suviviors group on a regular basis and starts taking out the scum that are preying on or have preyed on the other members. There were a couple of really awesome and disturbing kill scenes and some good gore effects. I also liked it because I didn't have to see the rapes as there were none shown except for brief flashbacks.

The film keeps cutting to Jennifer\Angela sitting in the office of a counselor but we never fully understand the complete reasoning until the end of the film. Some of the film can be somewhat subjective at times or ambiguous leaving one to form his or her own opinion. Everything seems very dark ,even when inside. Especially in Jennifer \Angela's apartment.

It makes for a good revenge Horror flick and is much better than it's been rumored to be. Beware of the Almighty Pipe!",1444348800,,1056,4.518324607329843
7368533,5,B013P0X1MU,"I Spit On Your Grave 3 was literally the movie Ive wanted out of this franchise my entire life. It improves on literally every single aspect of the concept of the series.
We follow the same girl from the first movie, and the entire movie is pretty much dedicated to showing how the events of the first movie effected her. Instead of a graphic rape scene (by the way, not a single on-screen rape in the entire movie) to show the effects of rape on a person, in its place we spend a majority of the movie in a rape recovery therapy group thats used to show how rape effects a person since we get to know some of Jennifers group members.
The performances from the recovering victims is so heartfelt and genuine that it makes you wonder where all this was for the first 2 movies. A majority of the movie is characters on a soap - box giving speeches deconstructing how rape is treated in society and its so great to hear it said so frank and direct in a movie.
The basic concept is that Jennifer learns that a majority of her new friends rapists were never punished for what they did, so she becomes a vigilante who targets rapists. That alone was enough to sell me on the movie and holy s*** did it deliver. The scenes of the rapists being punished are so satisfying that it makes the entire movie worthwhile.
Overall, if this is the end for the series then it was a perfect way to go out. However I wouldnt mind if more were made if they kept going in the direction that this new movie went.",1444176000,4,1489,4.246478873239437
7368534,2,B013P0X1MU,"The....4th movie I believe in the series.... and is maybe the weakest. I never cared for the original ISOYG but I enjoyed the violent Remake. Well this movie takes places after the character from the remake tries to move on with her life. She is troubled with flashbacks and after a series of males set her off she is right back to the slaughter of male pigs.

This movie for me didn't work. Here is why. First, no violent attack to the character. So your just running off what happened to her in the first film. Which if you didn't see that movie your not gonna feel the horror. Second, way too many ""fantasy"" kills in her mind instead of actual kills. She daydreams about killing scum instead of actually doing it. Third, the movie takes a long time to get to the killing. This film is the 4th in the series we don't really need a long storyline of character roles. And Last on my list is you have the girl from the remake, jennifer hills who became a super killer in that movie has somehow now returned to a frail little angel again?.....Until the scum set her off and then shes back to the super killer but still making poor choices on how she sets up the kills? Like its her first time figuring out how to kill people when she was a pro in the remake.

All in all, Its ok to rent. Nothing really worth buying to watch over and over. Speaking of which, the real horror begins when the movie ends and you remember that rapists actually do get out of jail only after a couple of years or never get caught to begin with. Its a problem that needs to be addressed and I believe the movie is trying to push that message here instead of just being another film in the series that repeats itself. Only problem is...with a title like ""I spit on your grave 3:Vengeance is Mine"" you might be missing your target audience.",1443916800,13,1814,4.285714285714286
7368535,4,B013P0X1MU,"I Spit on Your Grave III is disturbing from the title on. Among the vengeance, vigilante, righteous retribution movies, none is potentially more shocking and violent. The viewers witness the terror and trauma of women raped and the possible final consequences.

Viewers are gut punched in the adrenals from the first flashback. We recognize our victim and survivor, Jennifer, now called Angela, played by Sarah Butler, and remember her brutalization and her paybacks from the 2010 version of this franchise.

Here Angela meets another victim, Marla played by Jennifer Landon, and we enjoy the new womans strength, candor and moxie.  We are even willing to go along with her actions, although they begin to turn dangerous and dark and increasingly violent.

Parts of the horror ISoYG III are Angela running into frightening creeps and her traumatized dreams of being assaulted and her graphic fantasies of doing something massive in response.

Marlas death triggers real violence on exactly that scale.

Jennifer puts on her Medea face (M killed her children to punish her husband for abandoning her), shops at Builders Emporium for hurt-the-bad-guys-good tools (she passes up hedge clippers this time but stocks up on a crowbar, sledge, etc. ), dresses for successfully luring heels, snakes, slime wads (a slinky shorty, short red dress). She is focused, fierce, ferocious; so any horn dog who hits on her deserves to die even if just to thin the herd of monsters.

What follows is a bitter and ironic description of the last half of the movie:

She sights rapists, slays same, and slides into psychosis.

The last phase merits clarification.  Angela circles psychosis from the start but we see her crash at the end.  She stalks a guy we know is good and then a low life weve met earlier who is all talk, dumb, and would leave her alone without her propositioning him big time.

The ending of the film might be open to some interpretation but for me Angela has been traumatized by not only was done to her but what was done by her.

Angelas insanity led her to attempt to kill all the brutes and lose sight of the truth that the effort always ends with the same last victim.",1443657600,21,2174,4.827493261455525
7368536,4,B013P0X1MU,"This movie is actually a continuation of the remake and takes place a few years after that movie. Interesting. Moving onto a different storyline for the second movie worked really well, at least for me, and I was definitely curious how this one would go. And well, this has turned into an incredibly solid franchise. The storyline progression here is definitely a good one, albeit it seems kind of an obvious way for it to go. Regardless, it works. The acting is good and the direction carries a pretty good pace. It is a little slow to get going but once the violence kicks in, it gets downright brutal. Possibly the most graphic and bloody kills to date in the franchise. One complaint is that there were too many fantasy sequences with the lead exploring her violent side, but the payoff for the real violence is definitely worth it. Very well done flick sure to appease the gorehounds out there, not with quantity, but with quality. 3.5/5",1443571200,22,942,4.6467065868263475

7368571,3,B013P0X1MU,"A step in the right direction, the filmmakers opt out of telling the story of another victim and instead continue where the first film left off. The biggest problem with this sequel is the missed potential. An engaging character study emerges only to be reduced to a clich as the narrative progresses. The film does delivers its trademark revenge-esque brutality but thankfully the lack of sexual violence make this the easiest to watch in the franchise.

7368609,4,B013P0X1MU,"Wow, what a movie. You would think a third installment couldn't do much in this franchise, but it manages to put new ideas and a great story together.

 STORY 
This is a direct sequel to the original and disregards part 2. We are reintroduced to the heroine/victim of the first movie (same actress), whose character changes her name. We see how life has affected her after the incidents of the original (given through flashbacks). She has become a hard person, not letting anyone in, and suspicious of everyone's motives.

She decides to go to a support group and it's there that she meets a feisty friend who asks the question of what kind of justice do these perpetrators deserve. With a smart script, it makes you question yourself: do we trust and rely on the system to do what's right, or do we take justice into our own hands? At what point is it okay to do what needs to be done? Is it okay at all?

This movie couldn't have happened without the original. You had to have seen what happens to her first to understand how she is now. This is not a simple revenge movie, it gives you something to think about.

Filmmaking-wise, all of this is told and directed with purpose. This isn't grab and go filmmaking, this is a well-made movie. The creators had a message and it's told with honestly, some humor, and with gore.

 GORE 
Now, this wouldn't be an I Spit On Your Grave movie without some wince-inducing gore. I mean, that is why most watch it. You'll get it, but the focus of this movie isn't on the gore, it just happens to be in there to support the story. But a warning: be prepared to squeal and look away.

I came into this without many expectations and was completely surprise at the depth of the story. Recommended.",1471996800,,1742,4.443396226415095

7368654,3,B013P0X1MU,"I watched this movie, and as I was watching - I WAS SHOCKED how good it is - I mean REALLY good.  And there are a lot of moments that are odes to other movies - when Oscar walks in to that police station, and even the way he screams, reminded me of Spacey in Se7en.  You'll see what I mean.  This movie is like a female Death Wish.

I saw this on cable this weekend and as I was watching, I was like, I'm going to buy this movie.  But then it had to happen, those last ten minutes.  I would definitely recommend seeing this.  Sarah Butler is a great actress and she should be getting more and better roles.  But the last ten minutes of this movie were dumb, nonsensical, confusing, and they totally messed up the Jennifer Hills character and who she is.

I don't cry about endings to movies like people always do, but this ending really ticked me off - for both what they did to her character, and for messing up a movie that was so darn good, and I was so invested in.

This movie is so good, but the last ten minutes of this movie is lazy filmmaking, and irresponsible.

The audience and Jennifer deserved better.",1460505600,,1115,4.163551401869159

Jennifer Hills is still tormented by the brutal sexual assault she endured years ago. She's changed identities and cities, reluctantly joining a support group where she begins to piece together a new life. But when her new friend's murderer goes free and the tales of serial rapists haunt her, Jennifer will hunt down the men responsible and do what the system won't - make them pay for their crimes in the most horrific ways imaginable. Only this time, no jury may be able to save her.

This sequel is a rather good entry to the series, I look at this as the official sequel to the original as it continues the story of Jennifer (Sarah Butler) from the original movie (remake 2010) This is a very dark moody sequel right from the start we really feel for her character and what she's been through, the movie has a very dark tone and Jennifer is a very untrusting cautious person and a very different person now, Sarah Butler gives a great performance in this movie even more than the original in some ways, the movie is rather gripping especially when we get to the nasty stuff, the torture/kill scenes are graphic and nasty yet gloriously deserved, you certainly are kept thrilled throughout the well paced run time, if you love a good revenge thriller this is certainly one of the best in a while and worth checking out.",1453939200,,1331,4.592436974789916

I loved the original and it is sad to see so many commenters that do not know the original ""Day of the Woman""1978. One commenter actually states this is a continuation of part 1. For all you older fans, this is good. Less sex, less nudity, good violence",1446163200,,377,4.323943661971831
7368880,2,B013P0X1MU,"A copy of this title was provided for review purposes.

I was reading an article the other day that said that Hollywood was finally realizing that remakes and sequels were not the money making movies they thought and that an end was in sight for both. Unfortunately it takes a while for that information to filter down and the movies that were already in the pipeline are moving forward and many are still being released. Had that not been the case I would have been able to spend the 92 minutes it took to watch this film watching something else that was better.

Its not to say that this film was the worst movie ever made but the entire time I was watching I kept wondering what the point was in making this one. The only answer I could come up with was that it had name value so will probably attract a few viewers that way and that perhaps there were a few people who loved the movie enough to want to continue the story. Not many mind you but maybe just enough to recoup the cost of the film and make a few bucks.

Not having seen PART 2 I checked and this film picks up after the first remake so you can rest easy and not worry about the second chapter. Here Sarah Butler returns to play Jennifer Hills, the woman who was gang raped and tortured in the first in the series. Still psychologically strained she starts off in therapy when her therapist suggest she join victims group therapy. She does so and makes a friend in Marla, a woman who was in an abusive relationship but who also stands up for herself.

The two bond quickly, eventually taking on the tormentor of a 16 year old member of their therapy group and threatening to come back if he doesnt stop. Marla nearly goes over the top but Jennifer stops her first. Boosted by the experience Marla tells Jennifer shes going to her ex-boyfriends to get a few things back from him while hes out. The result is his killing her which in turn sets off Jennifer to become an avenging angel to any and all who come to harm.

While the first film had a victim reacting to those who did her wrong setting her on a trail of vengeance, this film takes the same character and turns her into Charles Bronson via DEATH WISH. She becomes a hunter who easily comes to enjoy what it is shes doing rather than be bothered by having to take on that persona. Jennifer has flashbacks of what happened to her as well as fantasies of the most violent acts she can imagine, the fantasies bringing a smile to her face. While the original film made her a hero of sorts her enjoyment of what she does here makes her more psycho and as unsympathetic as her tormentors.

The movie, of course, ends with enough openness to leave the door there for a sequel. My hope is it doesnt happen. The original remake didn't do that well and it surprises me that weve reached a part 3. While the movie itself is well made, well acted and offers a decent story of sorts it feels like the only reason it was made was to cash in on the long ago created original film. While that one was difficult to watch at least they let it end with one movie. Hopefully this set will end on number 3.",1445904000,,3108,4.268251273344652
7368881,5,B013P0X1MU,"This is such a great movie, I don't care what the so called critics are saying. This is a great movie even better than the first one. She avenges everyone....",1445817600,,158,4.3
7368882,3,B013P0X1MU,"There is nothing like a good rape/revenge film or so it seems since we are on number 3. Jennifer/Angela (Sarah Butler) is now in group where she befriends Marla (Jennifer Landon) an over the top woman who had all the best lines. At this point it becomes a fun  ""Lila and Eve"" as they form a little vigilante group.

The film contained flashbacks from part 2 in case you forgot what a gang rape looked like. Marla was a great character,  Angela wore thin without her. Gabriel Hogan played the detective and was Crispin Glover creepy in the role, perhaps by design as nearly all the men were like that except for Oscar (Doug McKeon) who was part of the group. The film started out great and would have been far better if they had kept their only good character in it longer.

Guide: F-bomb, bloody violence, brief rape scenes, brief nudity in film flashback.",1445644800,,856,4.503225806451613
7368932,5,B013P0X1MU,"I have to say... Just WOW! I'm in love with this series, and if they make a fourth I hope they find away to continue with the same awesomeness they've been doing.
I loved the idea of having Jennifer come back, showing how she's dealing with everyday life. Hating all men, thinking anyone nice is out to get her for something, and having this built up rage inside when victims aren't strong enough to fight back or wronged by the justice system.

*Spolier Alert*

I will say, the ending was some what underwhelming, and I felt it was rushed. I mean, she was kicking a$$ and taking names fighting for those who've been wronged, and even though it was extremely gruesome you were on her side, and some how felt what she did was justified. Then it got to the ending, where she dressed in a very revealing outfit, and went out looking for someone to attack. That was the ending they went with... I would have expected that if they knew she was hunting people's rapist from the group that they would have an actor go in, tell a horrific story and trick her into trying to track this man down and catch her red handed.
But instead... They send her out on the town in a red dress looking to attack the first man that takes her sex offer seriously. It destroyed everything about her character in my opinion. All in all, I loved the movie and I'm very happy with my purchase.",1445644800,12,1365,4.349019607843137

7368937,2,B013P0X1MU,"The movie picks up with the main character after her experiences in the first movie, the remake of ""I spit on your grave"".  She is going thru therapy, and attends a group for victims.  She slowly progresses to seeking revenge on some of the perpetrators who had attacked other members of the group.  It is here that the story starts to take on a ""Death Wish"" feel, as she is no longer avenging a direct wrong against herself.  The frequent cutaways to short scenes from the prior movie, interspersed with scenes of her revenge fantasies also reminds one of  ""American Psycho"", absent the humor.  Whereas in the first [and second] installment of the series, the character was easily identified with and sympathetic, by the end of this movie, the main character seems to be as mentally disturbed and unstable as her targets, basically, admitting to the therapist that she enjoys the violence she commits almost as much as the criminals she is killing.  The pace of the movie was also rather slow as compared to the previous installments, and was more difficult to follow.  All in all, much weaker than the prior two movies in the series.  Perhaps the message supporting crime victims is stronger in this movie, but these types of movies are not about a deep message.",1445299200,12,1264,4.735159817351598
7368938,5,B013P0X1MU,"Sarah Butler returns as the avenging angel in the third part of the I Spit Franchise which is more of a sequel to the first excellent instalment. Well acted, well scripted and with a production of a high calibre this is a triumphant slice of vigilantism at its most bestial and unforgiving and is the perfect antidote to the most vilest of crimes. The movie works well as it examines those who believe 'violence is not the answer and forgiveness is a solution' but ultimately in a crime so heinous and as Jennifer states is 'bull****' as she takes on the system which demonstrates that the law is on the side of the violator more so than the victim. The film takes a little time to get going but when it does it returns to the familiar exploitational territory we know so well as Ms. Hills brandishes a sense of justice that most think but would never admit is correct. Ms. Butlers' portrayal should be applauded as she goes through a gamut of emotions from an individual who is slightly neurotic because of her scarring from her ordeal of the first movie to a strong avenger determined on retribution for herself and those around her in a society that just doesn't care or makes excuses for the individuals who get away with it shielded by the do gooders who are wrapped up in their own humanitarianism so they lose sight of the severity of such a despicable act. The message, no matter how nihilistic, is made perfectly clear and so well executed. This is no run of the mill effort produced solely to shock (although some of the vengeance sequences are jaw dropping especially the 'just the tip' scene- bravo!!) because it is just so well orchestrated in terms of plot, direction, pace and intent. This movie proves one fundamental thing that every town or city needs a Jennifer Hills and that films of this genre are still in very capable hands to a modern audience just as they were in the grind house golden age of the 70's and 80's.",1445126400,24,1938,4.524216524216524

When something happens to Marla and no one is held accountable Jennifer decides to unleash her own brand of justice. The previous two movies were a little hard to watch. A graphic rape scene followed by a sequence of gory revenge scenes. They weren't bad but they reminded me of the Hostel movies. Not much plot and really just an excuse to push the limits of what they can put in a movie. I went in with that expectation to this one. I have to say that this was easily the best of the three. This movie had what the others were lacking, a story. This had more of a Boondock Saints feel then a Hostel how-shocking-can-we-be feel. There are some very over the top aspects in this but the story is something that keeps you watching, strange to say for a horror movie. I surprisingly liked this much more than I expected to.
