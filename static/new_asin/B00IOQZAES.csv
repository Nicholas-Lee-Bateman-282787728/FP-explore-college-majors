Now I think if you have a product that will only play in the UK, you owe it to the people to tell them that.  At the very least.  I feel very strongly that I have been scammed.  I have waited for a year to get a DVD of this wonderful concert.  Well, I have one now, and all I have to do to watch it is move to England :o(",1439164800,29,463,3.5445544554455446

i agree with the rest of the commenters. i do not understand why a concert filmed in the United States is not available in the United States. i watched it and loved it and dvr-ed but my dvr had to be replaced which means by by. i ordered the CD but there is no comparison to watching the looks on each of the players. listening to the cd for this is analogous to the CD for Havana Moon compared to the video. Just the sight of sasha allen gliding out on the runway, belting out and then the audiences faces. GET A REGION 1 DVD ON THE MARKET!!",1517788800,2,577,4.026086956521739

8644204,5,B00IOQZAES,"In 2014, when my husband was ill an dying, this concert helped get me through that tough time. I bought the CD which is fabulous but it's just not enough. I inadvertantly bought the online video through Amazon and I can't watch it because I have windows Vista. I beg whoever may make the decision to manufacture this film in DVD/BluRay for the U.S. to do it now!",1464480000,7,362,4.338235294117647
8644205,1,B00IOQZAES,Couldn't be more disappointed. First off it took a month for delivery. Then I found out I cannot play it on my DVR. I really enjoyed this when I saw it on tv and wanted to own it. It took forever to come out and now this. I bought two and one sent to my son. I had never heard of this Region 1 or 2 and had no idea that some dvds had different format.,1458259200,13,351,3.6315789473684212

8644207,1,B00IOQZAES,"Why the heck can't you get this for Region 1?  It's been forever since this thing aired, they make movies available all the time a year or two after their release (this one came out in 2013) that you can buy for sale, that they also air on movie channels, why should this be any different?  Release it formatted for Region 1, make a fortune from all of us who want it, and still air it on your movie channel and gain a new audience who wants to own it too. Who is the marketing ""genius"" that is making this decision?  They should be fired!",1440288000,37,539,4.114285714285714
