2830913,4,B000Q677D6,"I enjoyed *Rosario Tijeras*.  It wasn't a great film but it is worth watching.

The movie opens with Antonio bringing Rosario into an emergency room.  Both are covered in blood.  While Rosario is taken into surgery, Antonio takes a stroll down memory lane to where he first meets Rosario.

Antonio and his friend, Emilio, meets Rosario at a trendy bar.  Emilio and Rosario immediately hooks up.  Rosario is a sexy, fascinating and mysterious woman.

Throughout the movie, you're not sure if Rosario is doing assignments for someone else or if she's the head honcho.  Antonio later tells her about these rumors he's heard about her.  Even Antonio isn't sure.  Rosario just laughs it off.

What's interesting about this movie is that the first half, she's in control.  However, once her friend/""brother""/mentor/caretaker, JonHefe was killed, she seems to lose control of everything.

Meanwhile, Antonio is in love with Rosario.  However, he doesnt' want to come between her and his childhood friend, Emilio.  Plus, he feels obligated to look after her after her brother made him promise to do so.

I enjoyed the cinematic scenes throughout the film.  However, what I wasn't too crazy about was the stereotypical portrayal of Latinos as gun-toting and revengeful.  Ah well, I guess there are small rings of truth in stereotypes.

Overall, good movie.  In fact, probably one of the best Latin action films that I've seen in recent years.",1178841600,10,1433,5.038461538461538

2830936,3,B000Q677D6,"The tone and pace of this movie changes so much throughout the film, almost making it distracting to me to truly ""get"" into the film. We see so many different sides of Rosario, but I was never able to fully connect with her. A truly good movie, in my opinion, succeeds at ""opening"" at least the main character to the audience in such a way that they connect in a unique way. This could have been better achieved with perhaps angling the story more in line to the book, or perhaps focusing more on Antonio's perspective rather than flashbacks through so many other characters' perspectives and timelines.

The flashing back and forth, as well as the constant changing tone and pace, gives the slightest vibe of a soap opera rather than a movie. I feel I never fully got pulled ""in"" to the movie, except only at certain times, mainly the times when it was from Antonio's perspective.

I really would have liked to give this movie 5 stars, if there was more focus on Antonio's point of view (like it is, in the book). And some of the nude scenes just seemed a little cheesy and unnecessary. Overall, it has a very interesting and moving story and some noteworthy cinematography. Nothing exceedingly special, but the story was catchy enough for me to be very curious to find and read the book. I found the book to be more interesting than watching the movie.",1275696000,,1354,4.545081967213115
2830937,4,B000Q677D6,"Late 80s Medellin was the backdrop for ""Rosario Tijeras,"" a film about a love triangle between Rosario (Flora Martinez) and two friends, Emilio (Manolo Cardona) and Antonio (Unax Ugalde).  While hanging out at a dance club full of beautiful Colombianas, Emilio spots Rosario -- stunning beyond stunning in a red minidress  -- in the middle of the dance floor and forgets everything else.  Emilio then makes his move while his buddy Antonio watches.  Both of the guys fall for her although at first Rosario seems to prefer the wealthy playboy Emilio, but in the end -- later in the film -- she realizes she truly loves Antonio.  Rosario has a secret, though.  She's a gun for hire -- who, along with her brother Jonhefe(Rodrigo Oviedo)and his buddy Ferney (Alonso Arias) -- take out contract and revenge hits in the Medellin underworld, which of course was dominated by the cocaine cartel.

Rosario really likes Emilio, but only for sex. For her, he's a diversion from her hard lifestyle. She doesn't tell him anything about her life, although early on she gives him a very graphic ""hint"" that she's not to be trifled with.  On the other hand, as she gets to know Antonio, she tells him everything and invites him into her life.  Eventually, after being insulted at dinner by Emilio's wealthy parents, she lets go of Emilio and falls for good-guy Antonio.

In the meantime, by way of flashbacks, we come to understand how Rosario came to be the killer she is.  Growing up in a poor barrio, she was sexually abused as a young girl by her stepfather.  She got even with him by emasculating him with a big pair of scissors -- thus earning her last name, ""Tijeras.""  Her mother then kicked her out of the house and she ended up with her brother, the only person that she loved -- up to the point she realized she loved Antonio. Thus, she became immersed in her brother's world of drugs, violence and death.  Because she was stunningly beautiful, her brother was asked to introduce her to his superiors in the Medellin drug cartel and under the wing of her patron, she became a combination girlfriend/hitwoman. To her, she had no emotional feelings for the guys she was ""with,"" other than it provided her with a more upscale lifestyle than she would have had under normal circumstances.  She was able to use her looks to get next to her targets and became a cold killer for her bosses.

One sequence that was really interesting was the wake and funeral for her brother Jonhefe, who was killed on a ""job"" after forgetting a religious amulet that he always wore when ""working.""  I'm not going to give much more away, so you'll have to see the film to appreciate it.

Flora Martinez gives a great, nuanced performance as Rosario.  She gives her character depth and you sympathize with her despite her profession. The fact that she's a beautiful, sensual woman who is totally unashamed of her body doesn't hurt the film at all, either.  The supporting cast is very good, although the characters aren't nearly as developed as Rosario.  That wasn't a real big drawback to the film, though.  As stated in a previous review, this isn't an action film, even though there is occasional gunplay, which is to be expected.  It doesn't dominate the film, however.  There's quite a bit of sex in the film, but it's in context of the story itself and the cultural milieu so it's not at all out of place.

Overall, this is an excellent film with solid acting from the cast, great locations and photography and a good story line based on the book by Jorge Franco Ramos.  Not to be cliche, but this film, like so many other top notch movies coming out of Latin America these days has a gritty realism that is authentic.  It has subtitles if you need them, but if you're a native speaker or learning Spanish, it's much better to not use the subtitles and listen to the vernacular instead.

The only minus that I can give the film are the flashbacks on top of flashbacks which get to be confusing if you're not paying close attention.  You watch the film several times and then you figure it all out.  Thus, four stars (plus) for this one overall and that ain't bad.",1269043200,7,4139,4.599455040871935
2830938,4,B000Q677D6,"This was a great movie. A great story line and amazing performances and lets be honest, the gratuitous Flora Martinez nudity doesn't hurt either. The only complaint I have has less to do with the movie and more with the marketing. They sell it like it's a shoot-em-up action movie but in reality it's a drama. There is some gun play in the movie but it's actually very little and there aren't any extended action scenes. The violence is basically used to accentuate certain parts of the story, but this is definitely not an action film.",1234396800,,536,4.59375
2830939,4,B000Q677D6,Good film with a gorgeous girl and good actors. Shows the kind of life that poor colombians involved with drug dealers have to suffer. I'll probably watch it again.,1213315200,2,164,4.689655172413793
2830940,4,B000Q677D6,"Loved this movie for the creative way used to introduce the characters and the story along with the action sequences.
this movie is not for children, since there are many scenes of nudity that are not proper for underage audiences. Violent, but pleasing. This movie has its own place in Latino movie goers in theirs must-to-watch list.",1210291200,2,335,4.894736842105263

2830942,4,B000Q677D6,This is a really interesting and beautifully shot film. The acting is suburb and the leading lady (Flora Martinez) as the femme fatale Rosario Tijeras is absolutely stunning. She has a lot of range and depth and hope to see more of her. Although it is very graphic in its sexuality and violence it still is a moving and emotional story. Recommended for film buffs and those enamored of Flora Martinez :),1202774400,10,403,4.611111111111111
2830943,3,B000Q677D6,"First off, the camera work and cinematography is second to none. Even the premise itself is top of the line. Unfortunately, the execution of the story is what hurts this movie. We have flashback, after flashback, in one person's flashback, then somebody else's flashback, that the story gets muddled. Rosario is so hurt by her brother's death for almost half the movie, but the problem is, that her brother is not fleshed out enough, the filmmakers should have given the audience some emotion to connect with Rosario's emotion. There's just not enough about their relationship for the audience to care. But some of the images and camera angles just might be worth checking out this film.",1188950400,8,687,4.931034482758621
2830944,5,B000Q677D6,"Hace dos aos le el libro por Jorge Franco e inmediatamente se se hizo uno de mis libros preferidos.  Me emocion al saber que iban a hacer una pelcula basada en la novela y recin esta noche la veo.  Qu pelcula ms fuerte!  Sigui bastante fielmente al libro, aunque hubo escenas en la pantalla grande que no record en el libro, como cuando salen a rumbear para hacerle un ltimo homenaje a Johnefe pero bueno!  Tambin confieso que fue ms fcil de seguir la novela que la pelcula.  La historia tiene muchos enredos as que en las pginas, pude seguirlos sin problemas.  Una crtica deca que la segunda parte no estaba tan bien dirigida que la primera.  Puede ser.  Pero queda claro que Flora Martnez actu re-bien.  Ella hizo vivir un personaje sumamente complejo (el de la mismsima Rosario Tijeras).  Lo mismo me pas en la pelcula que en la novela - aun sabiendo lo mala que es Rosario, no pude evitar de ""enamorarme"" de ella tambin, pues es muy seductora.  Tambin Unax Ugalde actu muy bien como Antonio, el mejor amigo de Rosario.  No voy a revelar qu pasa, pero es una historia que tiene muchas sorpresas.  And a ver a Rosario Tijeras si pods!

8194285,2,B000Q677D6,"Recommended by Overseas Adventure Travel in connection with a Colombian trip.  The movie was apparently hugely popular in Colombia, but one really learns little about Colombia, other than trash and violence are popular.  I thought that there might be something about Medellin , but this film has no educational value.  Mind you, I like Breaking Bad and Game of Thrones, but Rosario Tijeras is more about her sex life than anything else.  After an hour, I ejected the video and gave it to a construction crew.",1409011200,,508,4.872093023255814
