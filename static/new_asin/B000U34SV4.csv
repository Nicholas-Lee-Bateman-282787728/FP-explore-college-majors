2916576,1,B000U34SV4,OMG... I'd rather waste 2 hours rubbing peppers in my eye.  Lets just say it was so bad that I had to type this review.,1203033600,,119,3.76
2916577,1,B000U34SV4,"It would seem to be difficult to go further downhill than the 2004 movie of Around the World in 80 Days or the 2005 telefilm Mysterious Island, but 30,000 Leagues Under the Sea succeeds in achieving this lamentable goal.  As a 2007 direct-to-video release from, appropriately, The Asylum, 30,000 Leagues Under the Sea begins with the unpromising notion of updating Verne's classic, trying to cross Verne with Tom Clancy.  Certainly Verne has been updated before, and the results were not promising; The Amazing Captain Nemo (1978) comes most prominently to mind.  Yet, as bad as that predecessor was, it was a masterpiece by comparison to 30,000 Leagues Under the Sea.
 As in The Amazing Captain Nemo, 30,000 Leagues Under the Sea begins with the idea of having Nemo interact with modern naval technology.  Some characters remain; there is a scientist, Aronnax, and Conceil [sic], now his ex-wife and military superior.  There is even Nemo--but none of these individuals have any resonance with those in the novel, nor do any of the other supporting characters.  Indeed, Conceil is pronounced, not as a French name, but as if it were a type of seal.
 Aronnax and his crew are dispatched by Commander Farragut from the U.S.S. Abraham Lincoln in a special deep-sea diving sub into the Marianas Trench, where another, larger submarine was lost, apparently caught in the grip of a giant squid.  Making contact, the rescuers somehow wake up aboard the Nautilus.  Nemo introduces himself as a jolly eccentric billionaire who plans to release his captives shortly and is on the friendliest of terms with Farragut.  Already the disjunctures typical of the unfolding plot are evident.
 The Nautilus itself has vastly more in common with the Seaview of Voyage to the Bottom of the Sea than anything of Verne's imagining.  Nemo regards himself as an idealist, determined to save the deep and create a deep-sea utopia since humankind is ""defecating"" (the word is used twice) on the surface world.  His crew seems to contain all types; the Nautilus is more of a city than submarine.  There's even a nightclub on board and apparently prostitutes ply their trade with approval.  Certainly the language and morality of a Jules Verne film has changed in the 21st century; gone are the days when Verne implied family entertainment, or the civic idealism of Captain Nemo and the Underwater City, in which Nemo was formulated as a Lyndon Johnson-style figure trying to formulate a Great Society in the deep.
 30,000 Leagues Under the Sea director Gabriel Bologna claims to be a fan of Verne, and he even says that he's named his son after the author; however the adaptation by him with Eric Forsberg's screenplay has more reverses and nonsensical twists than a movie serial, while none of the genre's charm.  30,000 Leagues Under the Sea constantly returns to plot points to recycle shots and sets.  The end has Nemo pursuing the escaping Aronnax to retrieve the  oxygenator  that Aronnax had invented and Nemo needs to resurrect Atlantis.
 Only two motifs beyond character names are to be found in the book: the sunken land of Atlantis, and the giant squid (several of them, and under Nemo's control).  Nemo himself spins steadily further from Verne's conception and even the weakest other previous filmic impersonations.  Sean Lawlor's Irish brogue and the naval tour-of-duty pins on Nemo's tunic are entirely out of place.  Nemo proves steadily more monomaniacal in trying to capture Aronnax.  He turns nuclear torpedoes on Aronnax and his crew, who has arranged a booby trap that destroys the Nautilus.  As Nemo's own followers haplessly declare ""Abandon ship "" leaving their captain to weep uncontrollably, the Nautilus crashes into the remains of Atlantis.  Surely no film has ever offered so pitiable an etching of Verne's hero of the deep.
 Not that Lorenzo Lamas offers more as Aronnax, or Natalie Stone as Conceil.  The actors have little opportunity here, however, given the script and Gabriel Bologna's direction, which does little more than alternate between close-ups and extreme close-ups.  While at least the 2004 Around the World in 80 Days or the 2005 Mysterious Island had offered a few points of interest or discussion, 30,000 Leagues Under the Sea has, lamentably, no virtues whatsoever.",1200873600,13,4288,5.039716312056737
2916578,1,B000U34SV4,"30,000 leagues beyond bad. This movie is beyond painful to watch, avoid it like the plague. It is bad on so many levels, poor Lorenzo Lamas. What happened Asylum? Was Adrian Zmed busy the weekend you filmed this?",1198972800,4,212,4.605263157894737
2916579,1,B000U34SV4,Bad Bad movie! I was lost as soon as the captain of the battleship said to go to 75 knots with a submarine attached to the hull yep that was funny. And one other really funny thing was the scene where they are under way but in the background as the captain of the battleship is talking with a crew member you can see the water is pretty much still no wake at all that a ship under way would make. Yea this is a movie that should be rounded up and burned good thing i rented it for free. If anybody likes this movie it would really make me question their psychological disposition. And anyone with a little bit of submarine operational knowledge would laugh until there eyes explode because of the amount of inaccuracy in this movie(anybody ever hear of doppler radar on a sub yea me neither and yes i know this is scfi but there is a thin line between science fiction and science stupidity I am sure they could have found a technical adviser to at least get some things right).  And the acting is bad as well as the dialog between the actors. Well i have done this movie a favor by writing about it this much. By the way i couldn't even finish the movie.,1192320000,4,1154,4.198198198198198

2916581,4,B000U34SV4,"30,000 LEAGUES UNDER THE SEA
Theasylum.cc
Starring : Lorenzo Lamas & Sean Lawlor
Directed by: Gabriel Bologna

Really liked this newest offering from The Asylum peoples.
Lorenzo Lamas is finally given something to do besides walk thru a direct to Sci-Fi Channel opus.
Was kind of weird to have hero with beard and Bad Guy Nemo sans.
The sea creature was very different angle, Yet familiar territory.
ALL the effects looked great thanks to Tiny Juggernaut and Tara Lang.
Was surprised by a couple of performances- Kim Little (Nice development of character, HOW could producers let you end that way-LOL !),Natalie Stone( From Werewolf In A Women's Prison to this...),Sean Lawlor( You have a Robert Vaughn-ish look with even more debonair to boot, Keep going.)
The scenes in stranded sub ( Michael Tower as captain) were heroic and confining.
Realize there are plenty of `Leagues Under The Sea ` movies, This is nice addition.
This film has a nice, Big look and really takes its audience to another place, Just don't be a military sub that pisses on/off NEMO !",1189814400,,1057,4.872222222222222
2916582,5,B000U34SV4,"I had a good experience with this purchase , It came in a timely manner and the quality was good .Thanks again Bill",1315612800,,115,4.043478260869565
2916583,1,B000U34SV4,"""30,000 Leagues Under The Sea"" is a film so mind-boggling that I had to ponder what to write for some time before sitting down at the computer. Then I noticed it was directed by Gabriel Bologna and I thought that was a logical place to start. After discovering that bologna sausage is finely ground or hashed, contains lard, and only vaguely resembles its Italian forebears I finally had an epiphany: this movie is analogous to a big fatty sausage with no nutritional advantages and lots of disadvantages. Like the sausage, this film is hashed relentlessly with the choppiest of storylines, only vaguely resembles Jules Verne's original work (apparently the lard made it gain 10,000 leagues in the process,) and offers absolutely no reason to want to see it (it certainly isn't nutrition for the brain.)

The film stars Lorenzo Lamas and Dublin's own Sean Lawlor as a truly deranged Captain Nemo; Lamas is hammier than usual while Lawlor is the whole pork roast (sausage making can be a messy business, you know.) The film opens with a giant squid sinking a US nuclear submarine, the USS ""Scotia."") The navy will use naval officer Lieutenant Michael Aronnaux (Lorenzo Lamas) in a special clear bubble and a submersible to get the people out of the submarine. (I was never clear on the physics of this whole arrangement.) Of course his ex-wife is a more senior naval officer, Lieutenant Commander Lucille Conciel (Natalie Stone,) and she is in charge of the mission so the bickering starts immediately. There is an absolutely abominable backstory about these two and their bad blood, and you'll be grateful when the story gets back to the giant squids. The filmmakers apparently interviewed nobody who knew anything about ships or the military. The surface support ship is allegedly the USS ""Abraham Lincoln,"" which is shown as a battleship. It's bad enough that the US hasn't had any battleships in decades, but a simple Internet search would have gleaned the fact that the real ""Lincoln"" is an aircraft carrier. This ship can also travel at 75 knots. I want to see a World War Two vintage battleship do 75 knots (actual top speed is around 33 knots.) Obviously that's too nitpicky for a film of this caliber, but it's no harder to do it correctly.

Lamas and crew take their submersible down to look at the sub, and at 20,000 feet below the surface they can look out the window and see the submarine sitting on the bottom. Of course in reality it's pitch black at that depth, and only a very few bathyscaphes and oddball submersibles can even think of going that deep. Before long the gigantic ""Nautilus"" appears under the command of Nemo, who is part marriage counselor, part raving lunatic. I prefer the lunatic part, and you will too when it's Lamas and Stone on the couch. Nemo takes them to Atlantis (""a place of untold riches and wisdom"") and reveals he needs Lamas' air breathing device to revitalize the lost continent. Also part of the plot: Nemo controls the squids, and has obtained the nuclear missiles from the ""Scotia"" to launch against the world above the sea. Nemo is a very conniving man and quickly convinces a bombastic administrative staff officer, Blackwell (Damien Puckler,) to betray the US and the world. Nemo wants to launch the nuclear weapons to make earth uninhabitable so that Atlantis can be revived, and Blackwell complies promptly after being exposed to Nemo's pheromone mind control goggles. (I wish I were kidding.)

Lamas formulates a plan to stop Nemo's madness, realizes he still loves Stone, fights off squids, goes to the ""Scotia"" and, finding its crew alive, rescues them all. Question: if the crew of the ""Scotia"" was still alive, how did Nemo get the missiles out without the crew noticing? When you're done figuring out that puzzler, ponder this: is it ever a good idea to abandon ship 25,000 feet below the surface of the ocean? A quick Internet search would raise a few cautions, but I guess that was too much research for the Bologna team to undertake.

""30,000 Leagues Under The Sea"" is a really terrible movie: it has a completely impossible plot (forget suspension of disbelief,) terrible acting (Lawlor alternated between good and way over the top,) a ludicrous love story, generally poor special effects (the ""Nautilus"" was decent, the squids were laughable,) and a script that was hackneyed to put the best possible spin on a dire situation. Rather than watching this vacuous retooling of the Jules Verne classic, do yourself a favor: go to the library and borrow a copy of the book instead. Normally bologna sausage is made from chicken, pork, or beef. As tasty as that may be, I do not recommend bologna containing giant squid.",1294444800,4,4682,4.834164588528679

2916585,1,B000U34SV4,"Okay, you should know what you're getting yourself into if you pick up ""30,000 Leagues Under the Sea"" when you see it's been put out by the film studio The Asylum..the folks behind ""Snakes on a Train"" and ""Transmorphers"" and ""The Day the Earth Stopped""...basically cheap knock-offs of big budget movies.

But ""30,000 Leagues Under the Sea"" is a low point even for them. Horrible special effects, a horrendous adaptation of ""20,000 Leagues Under the Sea""..supposedly updated to current times and modern technology, and the acting is truly bad.

The problem with ""30,000 Leagues..."" is not that it's just bad, I love a good bad movie, ""Ice Spiders"", ""The Alien Factor"" and ""MegaSnake"" jump right to mind....but ""30,000 Leagues..."" commits the cardinal sin of bad b-movies...it's just BORING. I'll take a CGI Octopus mashing a CGI submarine all day long...but if that is what you promise, you better deliver....and ""30,000 Leagues..."" dissapoints in this as well. The action scenes are far and few between so we get lots of lame dialogue filled scenes..and when the action finally takes place...it's so dark you can't see a thing.

In a world of films populated by ""Mega Shark vs. Giant Octopus"", ""DinoCrock"" and ""The Snakehead Terror""....""30,000 Leagues Under the Sea"" simply doesn't deliver the goods.",1280102400,,1300,5.122641509433962
2916586,1,B000U34SV4,"It is difficult to even give the benefit of the doubt to a movie which aborts Verne's principal character of the original, 20,000 Leagues Under the Sea, Capt. Nemo, making of him a mega-villain, seeking to destroy the landlubbers everywhere.  Nemo was a vengeful figure, but his obsession of destruction was framed with conscience and directed at the facilitators and profiteers of war, specifically those who tortured and killed his family, as depicted in the outstanding Disney film.  Nemo was, in his intent, a righteous character, and he certainly was not a madman, senselessly at war with the whole world.

Those who have no appreciation of complex characters, or care if there is any relevance to what the truth would be if Verne's Nemo had survived, according to this scheme, than you may find, just for the FX, that it merits spending two hours of the 700,000 you will hopefully have in your life.  But if you are looking for a credible extension of the Verne character into a new, updated chapter, this is definitely not it and is a total waste of time.",1279238400,12,1062,4.755434782608695
2916587,2,B000U34SV4,"Two stars.  Another Asylum movie that is short and somewhat entertaining.  No nudity, and limited (if any) profanity.  I wouldn't pay more than a few dollars for this movie.

(Poor/fair/average/good scale used below)

- Special effects are poor to good.  Some effects are obvious and also slowed down, which makes them look poor.
- Character explanation and development are almost nonexistent.  All of the characters remain mysteries at the end of the movie.
- Acting is poor to average.
- Sets appear average to good.
- Camera work and lighting are average to good.
- Huge plot holes, nonsensical errors, etc., run throughout the movie.

Sean Lawlor as Captain Nemo does what he can with the limited screen time, dialogue, and characterization.  Nemo ranges from benevolent to manipulative to evil to insane.  However, his origin and motivation remain mysteries.

The DVD has a short behind-the-scenes feature, a short blooper reel, and a (low-volume, low-energy) commentary track.",1277942400,,982,5.230769230769231
2916588,3,B000U34SV4,"For a long time I didn't even believe this movie existed, until one of my students in my science fiction class actually bought it for me just to prove me wrong.  (30,000 Leagues? What a dumbass name).  So then I had to subject myself to 90 minutes of skull-penetrating garbage (i.e. watch the film) so that I could write this unnecessary review.  When considering what to write, I had quite the dilemma.  Should I just completely blast the movie, as it rightfully deserves?  Or should I give it my usual sarcastic 5 star review, which can be more difficult, but ultimately more rewarding.  I couldn't decide, so here's a little of both (thus the 3 star rating):

Good lord is this movie awful.  I can't even list all the times it made me want to put my fist through the TV.  But here's a few highlights:
- giant CGI squids from a 7th grade computer project using a 1992 MAC
- lack of any acting whatsoever, even from Lorenzo, which is sadly disappointing (Renegade how I miss thee)
- prostitutes on the Nautilus? What?
- sunglasses that brainwash you
- people going outside of subs miles down in the ocean and not instantly getting crushed from the pressure
- the ""oxygenator"", which turns water into air. don't even get me started
- Lorenzo goes outside the sub, then appears the next scene completely dry
- calling the movie ""30000 Leagues under the Sea"", when really they don't move at all (contrary to popular belief, ""20,000 Leagues"" doesn't refer to their depth, but how far they travel underwater.  Apparently, the director missed this point.  Along with a script, plot, actors, or skill of any sort)
- mispronouncing ""Conseil"" throughout the movie.  just retarded

And now, an alternate review:

Lorenzo Lamas kicks so much ass in this movie, it should be called ""30,000 Faces Punched in with Massive Masculine Fists Under the Sea"".  From start to finish, Lorenzo (aka Arronax, the renegade bounty-hunting part-time scientist) goes on an ass kicking rampage, pounding people left and right with little to no provocation.  Whether it's his commanding officer, his uptight ex-wife (with whom he shares some masterfully filmed romantic love scenes... until he punches her in the face), Captain Nemo, or giant squids, Lorenzo shows them all why he's called Arronax the ""Avenger"".  Just what is he avenging?  No one really knows, but that just adds to the mystique of the film, and lends itself to the sequel, which I eagerly await. Expect at least 75% more ass-kicking, more impressive mullets, gianter squids, and plenty of face-punching.  It's going to be a rocking ride kids, hold on to your seats.

I was going to go longer on the sarcastic review, but I just couldn't take myself seriously.  So just to clear up any confusion: stay away from this movie like a drop kick to the face.  It's not even ""entertainingly bad"", like ""The Core"" (although I really hate that movie too), it's just straight up terrible.  I hate my student for making me watch this.",1266192000,5,2962,4.7534246575342465

It was written with no actual Navy or submarine terms.  Sonar pronounced ""Soner"".  One sailor says, ""they are off our left flank"".  What about port and starboard?  Another sailor says ""I reapeat"" instead of ""I say again"".  Clearly, there was no military consultant on this film.  Has the writer even read a Tom Clancy novel?

His ship, The Nautilus, is a mobile submarine city and includes civilians. It's up to a Naval rescue crew, led by Natalie Stone and Lorenzo Lamas, to stop him.

This is a The Asylum flick, a company known for its low budget knock-offs of major productions. Ive only seen a couple of their films and actually liked 2009s The Land that Time Forgot by C. Thomas Howell.  That plus the fact that Im a fan of Jules Verne, Captain Nemo and Mysterious Island gave me hope.

The movie attempts a James Bond/Jules Verne hybrid in that it has the same plot as 1977s The Spy Who Loved Me. Captain Nemo, played by Sean Lawlor, even looks like Charles Gray's Blofeld from 1971s Diamonds Are Forever. Unfortunately, it fails on many levels. Lamas and Lawlor are effectively charismatic in their roles, but most of the rest of the cast are okay at best and sometimes downright bad. The CGI is cartoony, but serviceable for a low budget flick. I can forgive practically any production weakness if the story is captivating, but this is where the movie fails most. The set-up of the first half hour is relatively dull, but things perk up when Nemo appears. Unfortunately, the movie doesnt capitalize on this and it spirals into a boring darkened vessel adventure, like a bad episode of Deep Space Nine. On the female front Kim Little is fetching, but they don't do enough with her. By the last 12 minutes I couldn't wait for it to be over.

The movie runs 86 minutes.

I knew this modern adaptation of the Jules Verne classic novel was going to be a waste of precious time after I saw the trailer for another film before it started. The trailer had bad (and I mean worse than B-movie) acting and these really cheesy CGI images of robots that take over the world. I thought those robots reminded me of something. When I saw the movies title, Transmorphers, I knew I was in trouble  and that poor futuristic author Jules Verne was turning over in his grave.

Aronnas (Lorenzo Lamas) is captain of the Aquanaut, an underwater vessel that rescues those trapped on downed submarines. Hes developed this machine called the Oxygenator, which takes good ol H2O and turns it into breathable water. This machine creates a bubble around the objects near it when it converts water to air. (Thats important.)

 Aronnas and his crew must rescue some men on the Scotia, which was taken down by a giant squid machine controlled by the lecherous Captain Nemo. The catch? The Navy higher ups have put his bitchy ex-wife, Conceil (is that a real name?), in charge of the mission. Her hatred of Aronnes threatens the mission and the lives of the crew.

They descend and nearly die. They pass out and wake up on a giant submarine controlled by the psychotic Captain Nemo (who is dressed in garb similar to the evil Empire soldiers in Star Wars: Return of the Jedi, but incredibly inferior in look). After Nemos Join Us or Die speech, the crew is taken in for mind control while the psychotic captain steals the Oxygenator, which he needs to revive the lost city of Atlantis. He plans to use nukes from the Scotia to pollute the air so people must relocate below the seas surface to Atlantis, where he can create a utopia encircled by the Oxygenators big bubble.

Yup. Im serious.

The acting is bad  not the worst Ive seen, but pretty close. (I wonder, do actors know when a script sucks?) The actors do not have a command for military posture or jargon, their uniforms are completely inaccurate (that big patch with Navy printed on it looks like something a Cub Scout gets for his sash) and the Navy females wear bright lipstick and nail polish (black and BRIGHT red).

On Captain Nemos underwater monstrosity, the scenes alternate between looking like the characters are sitting in a smoky bar to having a clear view of each other. There are times when there are hot microphones, or a hollow sound when actors  and I use that term loosely  speak. Sometimes it seems like the dialogue was recorded after filming and was plugged in over the video because the sound is off and actors are not even facing the camera when they speak. You can also tell their jaws aren't moving.

This 85-minute film is purgatory for poor Jules Verne. Please don't put him through that by watching this film. Save your brain cells for something better.",1423267200,,2871,4.6390532544378695

The acting is terrible and never should had been made!

8212044,3,B000U34SV4,"People who read books should not watch movies. There will never be any similarity between them. Does that make them bad? Verne's book ""Journey to the Center of the Earth"" is boring compared to any film made about it...except maybe ones with Doug McClure. 30,000 Leagues is clearly deeper than 20,000 Leagues but that doesn't make for a deeper film. This movie made me feel like I was in the first grade playing, ""What's wrong with this picture?"" It was fun and the only way to watch this film and enjoy it.

The first question I had to raise (having served on a nuclear sub) was when did they start allowing women to serve on subs? The answer I got from Wiki was December 2011...meaning it hasn't happened yet and certainly didn't happen in 2007 when this film was made. Okay, but it made for a more interesting film. Now the enlisted people had dark black background petty officer patches sewn to their left arm on their light blue shirt. The background on the patch is supposed to be the same color as the uniform. The woman appears to have a steel workers insignia, i.e. a construction rating and not an engineering or electrical type rating as one might expect. The male petty officer appears to have a discontinued (as of 2006) photographer's mate insignia. This is a special sub and would be considered a re-enlistment bonus for top first class petty officers in the engineering field, not a second class photographer's mate. Natalie Stone as Lieutenant Commander Lucille Conciel has her oak insignia on the right lapel only. The captain had his birds on both lapels and Lorenzo Lamas as Lieutenant Michael Arronax had his Lt. bars on one lapel and a chief petty officers anchor on the other. You got to ask yourself what did they do? Go to an army-navy store and buy a handful of stuff and tried to make it work? Of course they are going to try to rescue a sub that is stuck on the bottom (in tact?) at 20,000 feet that was taken down by a giant squid. In the following scene Lamas ""corrects"" his lapel insignias by eliminating the chief's anchor and replacing his double Lt. bars with a single silver Lt. junior grade bars. Did he get busted in those 2 minutes?

As their small sub descends they can look out into the ocean fairly clearly and see all kinds of things growing from the ocean floor. This is wrong on so many levels. 1) They don't have viewing window or screen doors on subs. 2)If they did it would be too dark to see much of anything 3) They are diving near the Marianas Trench. They wouldn't see the ocean flora even if they had a window with visibility.

As the small Aquanaut descends it shakes as if it is falling apart. The reason given is because they are going through thermal layers which rocks the boat. Hmmm. Actually submarines operate in those thermal layers because it makes it harder to be detected. And was that flames underwater?

The movie is fun as Asylum films demonstrate they know nothing about the Navy. Why do they insist on making ocean films? The only fun in watching this film is finding the errors. Captain Nemo was played bad. Natalie Stone look as if she was playing Casey Anthony on trial with the way she had her hair.

No f-bombs, sex, or nudity. Frequent ""Asylum actress"", Kim Little looks cute in a pony tail and that is about as sexy as it gets. 3 stars for all the wrong reasons.",1325203200,,3337,4.4819078947368425
