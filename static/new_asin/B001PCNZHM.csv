3747029,5,B001PCNZHM,"This is one of my favorite TV show. The balance is perfect between fiction and realism. The directing is also very good. Each episode is like a criminal investigation with lots of mystery and drama.

PLEASE make a second dvd with the DHL OLL flight and the collision between the Bashkinian Airline Tupolev and the DHL cargo!",1282176000,,324,4.684210526315789
3747030,5,B001PCNZHM,"Very well done !!!
Since I am a pilot, I was looking for any ""inconsistencies"" in the conclusions of the reasons for the disasters, but they did a fine job. And it shows everyone that a pilot will do anything and everying in order to try to save the lives of their passengers.
It also goes to show that anyone can make a mistake, and there's no such thing as a ""perfectly-built and long-lasting"" vehicle (be it an airplane or even a car)",1280620800,,437,4.27710843373494
3747031,5,B001PCNZHM,"I absolutely love this show and I was incredibly excited when I found out that season 1 was here on DVD.  I always watch this show on Nat Geo when I can, but to have the show on DVD to be able to watch when I please is really nice.  I'm definitely looking forward to more seasons on DVD and hope they'll be released here on Amazon soon.  I'll definitely be on the lookout for them!",1280102400,,381,3.986842105263158
3747032,5,B001PCNZHM,This DVD is one of the best re-creations of mid-air emergencies. You feel like you are part of the flight and great details on what happened.  I can't wait for more DVD's from these programs.  You will not be disappointed.  I intented to watch one or two episodes and ended up watching the entire 6 episodes in one evening.,1277596800,,323,4.440677966101695
3747033,5,B001PCNZHM,I have watched the National Geographic series about Air Disasters for sometime now and it is done in a superb manner. This DVD set depicts well documented and very accurate information about these disasters as well as reports of post-air disaster information and how there were settlements by Airline Companies relative to what had occured. The series is done so well that you actually feel a part of the flights because of so much detail and how it is presented. I really don't find these accidents interesting except for the NTSB facts and the accuracy of how they were presented.  It was as much of a learning experience for me as well as an unbelieveable way to stay completely glued to to watching a documentary. It is fascinating to watch.,1268611200,16,745,4.730769230769231
3747034,5,B001PCNZHM,"Hurray! I've been a huge fan of this series for a number of years (it also airs under alternate names like Air Crash Investigations in various countries). This is the first ""season"" of the series, which currently has 6 seasons of episodes, with something like 60 or so episodes. This is one of my all-time favorite documentary series featuring nice analytical and engaging storytelling and excellent production quality (typically far better than the average documentary). While later episodes would feature somewhat more advanced production quality, this first batch is still excellently produced.

Later episodes of the series aired in HD, but I don't ever recall seeing these earlier episodes in HD. An extra bonus for this set is that it's in anamorphic widescreen. Having only seen these early ones in their 4x3 aspect ratio, it was nice to see them in their full 16x9 aspect ration.

To the folks at Koch and National Geographic, PLEASE continue releasing this series. I'll absolutely purchase them all. And heck, it'd be extra cool to get the ones produced for it released in high def.

UPDATE: These episodes on the DVD's are definitely extended from the aired versions I've got previous recordings of. The couple episodes I compared had some 6+ more minutes on this DVD version (interview clips with family & survivors less important to the narrative seem to be a favorite for cuts). Each episode clocks in at 52 minutes, give or take a few seconds.",1254096000,51,1457,4.963114754098361
3747035,3,B001PCNZHM,"With regard to Flight 261, the malfunctioning happened in-flight, not after take off as reported in the DVD contents/description. How come facts are captured so carelessly?",1241740800,2,172,5.653846153846154

I had planned to buy the blu-ray, but decided to go with the DVD due to heave negative reviews about the quality of the blu-rays. I must say this DVD was pretty good, both clarity wise and content wise. 10/10 to me for the purchase LOL",1392076800,,388,4.118421052631579

3747049,4,B001PCNZHM,I ordered this as a Christmas present as a last minute gift and I was very suprised and pleased when it actually arrived before Christmas!  The stories are very well told and dispite not being a huge plane fan found it very interesting.,1390521600,,236,4.488372093023256

3747054,5,B001PCNZHM,"This whole series is brilliantly done. I wish I could get hold of more episodes but as much as I search the History Channel and the web I cannot find any more of these DVDs for sale.
For aircraft lovers this series is a must have for their collections.",1364256000,,252,4.163265306122449
3747055,5,B001PCNZHM,I thoroughly enjoyed this DVD disc set.  The flow of each episode was really good.  What I have seen from TV shows without commercials is that it constantly repeats itself.  This series did a good job of not doing that.,1363132800,,219,4.425
3747062,5,B001PCNZHM,"I bought this because I like disaster and survival shows, movies, and book. I had never seen it, but because it had good reviews and came up as what other customers bought when I was buying the I Shouldn't Be Alive show. I figured for the price I'd give Mayday a shot. I ended up loving this show. Will definitely look for more seasons if they have more. The discs were in good shape and came in the basic DVD case. I had no issues with it skipping or not playing. I am happy with my purchase.",1362441600,,493,4.092783505154639
3747063,5,B001PCNZHM,I saw short YouTube clips from this series and knew it was a quality show. I've watched all 6 episodes and can't recommend it enough. The acting and direction are above average and the pacing will keep you on the edge of your seat. It includes interviews from passengers and victim's families and truly personalizes these horrific accidents.,1348963200,,341,4.896551724137931
3747064,3,B001PCNZHM,"There are two Mayday DVD sets available in the USA right now - this one (which contains six episodes - season 1 - of the series), and a 10-DVD set that contains 23 episodes - seasons 3 and 4.

The two-DVD set reviewed here is very basic.  The packaging for the DVDs in a regular two-DVD case containing only the DVDs and an advertisement for other DVD sets.  The DVDs themselves are also quite plain.  There are no subtitles or closed captions, alternate languages, or extra features - merely an opening menu and three episodes per DVD.  The image quality of the episodes is not particularly good - which could either be the transfer or simply the quality of the source material.

Comparing the 10-DVD set to this one, the 10-DVD set is a better value for the money.  For barely twice the price of the two-DVD set, you get nearly four times the episodes.  The episodes in the 10-disc set are from later in the series when the production values had improved.  The video quality of the 10-dvd set is noticeably better than the video quality of the two-disc set.

I'd recommend a purchase of this set if you already have the 10-disc set and want some more episodes to watch.  if you don't have the 10-disc set, get that first.",1347667200,17,1223,4.463963963963964
3747065,5,B001PCNZHM,"Mayday: Air Disasters is a great compliation of some of the more traumatic commercial aviation disasters in recent history that led to innovations in technology or training to ensure air safety.  The reenactments are well blended with computer animations, archive footage, and interviews with those involved in the incident, investigation, or air safety experts.  This series is well edited and gives an in-depth summary of six suspenseful air disasters, each epiosode is about 47 minutes long.",1344902400,,494,5.4868421052631575
3747066,5,B001PCNZHM,This was done very well and I hope they make additional versions.  Captivating and informative. The fact that they are all based on true stories made me feel like I was educating myself and not watching mindless television.,1343260800,,223,4.868421052631579
3747067,5,B001PCNZHM,"Any aviation history buff will enjoy this series... it is a compilation of several episodes originally aired on the National Geographic channel.

3747071,5,B001PCNZHM,"I'm a flight-sim fan and not a real pilot. I've been flying the virtual world since Flight Simulator 98 and was curious to see a video that depicted what it was like to actually be a pilot and fly a real plane.  I definitely didn't expect this well developed, fascinating and captivating series!  Not to mention there are VERY few documentaries or DVD's that get 5 stars, so I knew it was something special.

After watching all 6 episodes, I came to the conclusion there are 3 reasons a plane crashes.  Mechanical or electrical failure due to lack of proper maintenance, pilot/flight crew error or panic in dangerous situations and incorrect or misleading information relayed from air traffic control.  That's just my understanding of the video.  It was frustrating to see that many times ATC wasn't even aware of the dire situation the flight crew were facing.  What really upsets me though is that so many corners were cut so the airlines could make more profit when in the end they just ended up paying much more in law suits.

I have a couple questions though.  The pitot tubes.  Haven't they caused many aircraft accidents in the past.  Why aren't there backup systems installed that don't rely on those?  In another crash the pitot tubes were clogged with ice!  Don't the developers factor in that possibility!  Also, why don't major airlines come equipped with parachutes?  I know that sounds stupid, but in several of the crashes the pilots had enough control to allow passengers to parachute to safety before the plane crashed.  Like in the episode the plane crashed into the sea basically intact and the passengers drowned before they could escape.  Shouldn't parachutes be implemented like life boats are in cruise ships?  Maybe a real pilot could tell me if that's unrealistic, but I'd MUCH rather take my chances parachuting AWAY from a big steel tube filled with jet fuel.

If you're a flight sim fan like me, this video really brings to life all those aspects of the sim world in fascinating and chilling detail.  I do have to admit though, after watching this I'll stick to flying on my computer!!!",1317168000,2,2114,4.771349862258953
3747082,5,B001PCNZHM,"This DVD is a 2 DVD set with 6 episodes.  The episodes are very well done, descriptive and factual and long enough to be well worth watching.

3747083,5,B001PCNZHM,"This is my favorite documentary series of all. I always watch this whenever they come on t.v. I also bought this first season and love it. I am just waiting for the other seasons to be released on DVD so I can add them to my collection of aviation DVD's. The production pays very close attention to detail and the recreation of the accidents are very realistic.

By the way Amazon, listen to your clients; we want the other seasons too. There are so many more episodes that I want to watch over and over again.",1315353600,,510,4.3125

3747085,4,B001PCNZHM,"Mayday, a.k.a. Air Emergency or Air Craft Emergency, is a simply amazing and fascinating series that recreates some of the most maddening and disastrous airplane crashes and incidents in history. My personal favorite on this 6-episode set is ""Racing The Storm"", showing how pilot decisions plus bad weather plus changing conditions equals a ghastly crash that could have been avoided if even ONE of the links in the chain had been skipped. (For those unfamiliar: The ultimate cause of the crash was the cockpit crew forgetting to arm the plane's wing spoilers--flaps that ""spoil"" the airflow over the wings and transfer weight to the landing gear--thus dooming their already-dicey landing on a wet runway during a thunderstorm with wind shear.) The last 30 minutes of the flight, where everything changes from calm to chaotic, is recreated from the CVR and FDR and brilliantly re-enacted.

My one gripe is that the DVDs themselves seem to be fairly cheaply made--my first set scratched up with just a handful of transfers in and out of my laptop's DVD player. It's a testimony to how good the series is that I'm willing to buy a new set just to get these episodes again.",1308096000,3,1170,4.8793969849246235
3747086,5,B001PCNZHM,as a pilot i have a macabre interest in air disasters.  lots of detail in this video and a tiny detail can kill you so you have to pay attention.  air travel is safer than driving only if you consider miles traveled.  driving your car is safer if you consider the duration/time spent en-route.,1305417600,2,293,4.388888888888889
3747087,5,B001PCNZHM,"This couldn't get better! I always loved watching this show on Nat Geo.  Anyone with an interest in aviation should watch this show. It's all about what happened in the past and how they made aviation so safe today. My favorite episode isn't on these discs: Mystery Crashes. Mystery crashes is about how three random 737 jets rolling randomly on their sides. After 2 crashes, the third jet to roll over lands safely. Ten years from the first crash they discover that a cold rudder control unit and hot hydraulic fluid would cause the rudder to jam and sometimes reverse! After this discovery, all 737 jets have been modified to fix this and all pilots are trained on the possibility of this ever happening again.",1297036800,4,712,4.696

3747091,5,B001PCNZHM,"These are six accidents of commercial jetliners worthy of re-creation and analysis.  For me the most fascinating was the ""Flying Blind"" episode, where, prior to the flight, a mechanic had taped over the static ports of the Aeroperu 757 to clean the aircraft but then forgot to remove the tape.  After takeoff, the tape caused flight instrumentation to generate erratic data and the pilots could not deduce the problem before descending into the ocean.  A critical link in the error chain was the fact that the pilots relied on the air traffic controller for their altitude, a measurement that was actually generated by the airplane's own faulty readings and transmitted to the controller, who read it back to them.  The black, moonless night literally kept the pilots in the dark about their real altitude until it was too late.

For all flight crew reenactments, the screenplays are taken verbatim from the cockpit voice recordings and are rendered with chilling realism.  At times you feel like you're in the cockpit with the crew, helplessly watching them make crucial decisions that seal the fate of all souls onboard.

One other thing of note: The final, 80-second dive of Alaska Airlines flight 261 was, in all likelihood, even more terrifying than the reenactment as shown in ""Mayday.""  According to the captain of a Skywest jet that was in the area at the time (see the NTSB's ""Operations/Human Performance"" report for the accident), flight 261, at one point, curved up until ""it appeared to nearly stop, and then the nose fell back to the horizontal, leaving the airplane inverted,"" and then it ""did an indescribable maneuver during which it appeared to tumble end-over-end.""  The CVR also indicated a very loud noise throughout the final dive--undoubtedly the metal-on-metal shrieking of the broken stabilizer--but this detail was left out.  Nevertheless, the acting is superb, and we're reminded why Captain Ted Thompson and First Officer Bill Tansky were awarded the Airline Pilots Association Gold Medal for Heroism in 2001.",1282262400,,2037,5.108433734939759
