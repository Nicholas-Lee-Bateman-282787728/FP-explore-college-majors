8095608,1,B000C42EO4,"Problems with this dvd are as follows:
- not in focus
- music is awful
- Washington, DC is horribly portrayed
- glare off of the filmmakers windshield is clearly visible
- a large portion of the dvd is shot thru the passenger side window, so the road is not shown

THIS IS AN AWFUL DVD. DO NOT BUY. DC is my hometown and this is a confusing, ugly portrayal of a great city. Most of the monuments are not shown and the few that are go by so fast, you may miss them.",1432598400,,464,3.9361702127659575
8095609,5,B000C42EO4,Thoroughly enjoyed cycling to this DVD with my spouse! We are about 2 hours from D.C. and it was a  'hoot' to tour the capital and northern Virginia on an indoor cycle!  I recommend this item!,1408406400,,192,4.305555555555555
8095610,4,B000C42EO4,The scenery was great and I really enjoy especially cycling on the city streets.  However I am not a fan of the music and usually just turn it down and use my MP3 player.,1298592000,,170,4.0
8095611,5,B000C42EO4,"These Cycling DVDs are great and they have my highest recommendation!

Would I buy this one again? YES!
Would I replace it if I lost or broke it? YES!

Now  here I go. I'm a person who knows nothing about creating these cycle tours, and I always dislike it when people who know absolutely nothing tell the experts how to do something, <grin>, but I feel the need to do it anyway. Bear with me and don't throw tomatoes because I LOVE the DVD. I just want to see a remake of it with a couple of changes and I'll buy it too and recommend both to everyone I know.

I have half a dozen of these and the first one I watched was the California Coastline, which got rave reviews from me. Fantastic! Of course every area covered in that one was a place I loved, so I couldn't have been happier.

This is the second one I've viewed, as I ride through the countryside on my treadmill, only not really walking as fast as they are traveling.

I've only visited the Maryland, Washington D.C. area once and of course loved it! I saw it a couple of weeks before 911, in August, so the scenery was different. In the DVD it's Winter,

-not beautiful snow on the ground Winter,
-not Fall when the leaves are turning beautiful colors,

but Winter. I think there's probably a reason. You can actually see more of the landscape when there aren't any pesky leaves on the trees.

My next very-mini-gripe, because as I said before, I love these DVDS, is that I was so looking forward to the place on the DVD where we finally get to the White House. ---BLIP---5 seconds max. Then we got to our nation's Capitol. ---BLIP---maybe 7 seconds.

So if I were an expert doing a remake on this, I would do it while the cherry blossoms were out. [There's probably a really good reason why they didn't do that] I would pause at the different monuments or drive around the block to catch them from all angles, for instance, the White House.

Part of what determines if a person loves or merely likes one of these DVDs is probably whether you have an emotional attachment to the location, as I do with Big Sur, the California coastline. If I had visited all those battlefields in this DVD and those country roads, etc., I would be excited about it, Winter or Summer. There are other locations where I've never been and never will, so I'll be excited to see those from that perspective.

Let's face it. I'm going to be happy with these DVDs no matter what. I'm serious. These are a great way to exercise. The time goes by so fast you don't even realize you've done a workout.

All-in-all, I got a great workout and continue to want the whole collection.",1266883200,,2614,4.3539094650205765
8095612,5,B000C42EO4,"Cycling along Chesapeake Bay as the sun sets is peaceful and inspiring.  The New England style homes and town just remind you of the history of our country.  The first segment cycle along country lanes, across bridges and quaint towns to end as sunsets over the bay.  Just breath taking.  You don't even realize your exercising.",1252713600,2,328,4.803571428571429
8095613,3,B000C42EO4,"If you don't mind riding your bike in city traffic at 30Mph then OK.  These were obviously recorded in a car going at least 30 MPH or faster on city streets, alleys, parking lots etc.  Even got trapped in parking lot in Washington(C'mon.) They'll keep you busy and occupied while peddling but with a little effort and some technical savvy they could have been MUCH better.",1241049600,2,372,4.621212121212121
8095614,5,B000C42EO4,"This video is great! I loved the music, the great shots of D.C., Maryland and the battlefields. It's a fun way to get through a snowy winter.",1236470400,2,141,4.2592592592592595
8095615,5,B000C42EO4,"This is a fun and traffic-free way to see Washington, DC and surrounding areas while you are cycling indoors. If you watched the Inauguration 2009 and/or ever been to the DC area, this dvd will make you appreciate what you have seen.  It is entertaining as well as educational to watch while biking and makes the time fly.  I work out 3 times longer since I started using the Bike-O-Vision dvds.  I alternate them with the Spinervals dvds and the combination has really made a difference in my endurance and fitness level.",1232496000,,522,4.6521739130434785
