8228686,1,B000XJD3AC,"I purchased both this version, as well as the older version with Jimmie Stewart.  In my humble opinion, the one with Jimmie Stewart is way better.  Don't waste your hard-earned dollars on this one---instead buy the version that stars Jimmie Stewart.  The overall quality of the Stewart version and the acting performances are so much better.",1484265600,,341,5.053571428571429
8228687,5,B000XJD3AC,Winchester '73 was released in 1967. Joan Blondell gives great support in this as usual. A re-make of the 1950 original. Western fans will like this the most.,1434412800,,158,4.678571428571429

8228689,5,B000XJD3AC,"Tom Tryon and John Saxon play opposing brothers very well. A 60s TV remake of a 50s theatrical western, produced by Universal City Studios, it also casts Dan Duryea (who appeared in the original as well), Paul Fix (The Rifleman TV series' marshal), Barbara Luna and stalwart actor John Hoyt as an Indian.  It does play like a tv series rather than a film...at least to me it did. Unmistakeable 60s quality.",1409097600,,406,4.638888888888889
8228690,3,B000XJD3AC,I enjoyed watching it but the James Stewart version is better as this is a TV movie but it is a western which is my favourite genre.,1395360000,,132,3.925925925925926
8228691,4,B000XJD3AC,"This movie was made in the  late 1960's as a color remake of the original Winchester '73, done in 1950 by the incomparable James Stewart.  No gratuitous sex or violence here, which is an immediate plus given most of the Westerns that are made in the mid-2000's.  If you are strictly an old-movie purist that does not believe that any remake of a vintage film must be bad, then don't buy this movie, because in this context, the original ""Winchester '73"" wins hands down in ALL categories.  I am also NOT a fan of John Drew Barrymore's (the gambler in this 1967 film.)  These are the two reasons I gave this film four stars.

However.....

If, like me, you are a fan of Tom Tryon, John Saxon, and you wanted to see a more complex twist on the family storyline brought out in the original ""Winchester '73"", then PLEASE buy this movie, because it is NOT a line-for-line remake of the original.  Dan Duryea (a villain in the 1950 film), is back in a sympathetic supporting role as a McAdam uncle, and he's worth watching in any picture.  Paul Fix (Micah Torrance of ""The Rifleman,"") is the other senior McAdam, and he never turned in a bad performance that I know of.

Also, if you liked the shooting match sequences and the scenes of the Winchester .44-40 itself in the original film, you'll love this one, because they are all done in color.  That's the real reason I bought this DVD in the first place; I first saw the color sequences of the original film many years ago and never forgot them.  The DVD itself is well-made and well-packaged, though a few extras (""making of"" featurette, etc.) would have been nice.

Although this film lacks the luster of the 1950 Stewart vehicle, it's still a solid Western that makes good family entertainment.",1373846400,3,1744,4.551282051282051
8228692,3,B000XJD3AC,"This movie is a good T.V. remake of 1950 motion picture that starred Jimmy Stewart, it is not a great film , but it is a good entertaining movie with a simple plot like a lot of good westerns. One thing I like is how they made the changes to the story for this remake. it expaneded the Mcadams family from two brothers in the original film to a complicated somewhat disfunctional family of 5 members here. Which works into this plot very well. This movie is well worth the low price.",1311638400,4,483,4.260869565217392
8228693,4,B000XJD3AC,"I have never been particularly fond of Westerns, but Tom Tryon was the draw for me in this film.  While this movie is not on the level of ""The Cardinal""...still if you are a fan of Mr Tryon...you will enjoy his performance.  And what a cast...you don't get a roster of stars in one film like this anymore:  John Saxon, Dan Duryea, John Dehner, Joan Blondell...to name a few.  Actually the picture focuses mostly on John Saxon...the ""Bad Apple"" of the family and Tom Tryon is the hero sheriff.  The Winchester 73 rifle is the object that everyone seems to want to own in this picture and it makes a few surprising turns so that you don't know ""who"" will finally end up with this prize.  And enjoyable made-for-tv movie that will only take approximately 90 minutes of your time!",1239321600,8,776,4.507142857142857
8228694,5,B000XJD3AC,"Don't compare this to the James Stewart version. Take it for what it is, an entertaining Universal TV Western from 1967. I had been after this film for over twenty years and finally, thanks to Timeless Media Group, we have another exceptional print. The enthusiastic cast is headed by Tom Tryon, Dan Duryea and the always reliable JOHN SAXON. Mr Saxon chews the secenery and his character exudes menace from his first appearance to his last. Also in the cast John Drew Barrymore, Joan Blondell, John Dehner, Barbara Luna, Paul Fix, John Doucette, Jack Lambert, Jan Arvan, Ned Romero, George Keymas, Robert Bice, David Pritchard and John Hoyt!
Another thing I neglected to mention in previous reviews...Timeless Media Group always have excellent cover art and a nice collection of stills from the films and the price is very reasonable. Keep up the goood work Timeless Media Group!",1208563200,18,880,4.993197278911564
8228695,1,B000XJD3AC,"I will three things about this movie... SAVE YOUR MONEY... this movie is nothing like the 1950 edition, Jimmy Stewart is great in the 1950 movie of winchester 73. Buy them both, and I think you will see what I did, I wanted the 1967 edition to see how close it was to the 1950 edition, not even close. I would not rate the 1967 edition at even  one star...",1207526400,4,356,4.085714285714285
