7788599,5,0767012577,"This visit back to Limerick was filmed by a family member, Conor McCourt. The film  was very informative, funny, and of course, tinged with a profound sadness for what the McCourts endured in another time.  It is also a tribute to the always amazing strength of the human spirit. Meeting the father, seeing the ""lane""...so much good viewing!",1319760000,2,341,4.862068965517241

7788602,5,0767012577,"I haven't read Frank's books but the video immediately grabbed my attention as I tried to sort out the various brothers and timelines.

Superior to the following ""McCourts of New York,"" the brothers opened up to the nephew in terms of their upbringing, how their street geography defined their view of the world, & great slips of past plays.

I particularly loved Frank's story of stealing apples on base and how the American soldiers threatened to execute the starving boys who couldn't work up the nerve to ask for jam or butter on their bread as a ""last meal.""

Also Malachy's tearful story of their father and a faerie spring was touching and gave a glimpse of a truly magical episode. Even more heart rendering was the story of their mother anticipating his increasingly infrequent returns.

This isn't on Netflix so I would definitely reccomend checking this out.",1110758400,5,869,4.851351351351352
