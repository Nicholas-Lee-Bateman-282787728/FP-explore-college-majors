5791052,1,B00DCRE75M,"I LOVE Horror movies, especially low budget ones. Don't ask me why, I just do. This one however, I simply did not enjoy at all.

It looks good (but most HD movies look good) and has an interesting cast, but it was that bad. I rarely give negative reviews, that's how bad this is. The reason I give it a one star rating is simply because it did not entertain me or keep my interest, in fact I found myself playing a game on my laptop while waiting for something to hook me back in (nudity/a kill/Michael Berryman). I only kept it going cause I had already paid for the rental. I never review the acting or actors btw, just the story and this just didn't do it for me.",1386547200,2,666,4.123076923076923
5791053,2,B00DCRE75M,"I hate to do this because director Tom DeNucci is so sweet and humble,not to mention hot but this movie was so bad I could hardly finish it. The best thing about it was looking at Tom DeNucci who also starred in the film.

The story was all over the place,the acting was average at best. Eric Roberts did the best he could with what he was given,even the presence of horror royalty Michael Berryman couldn't save this. There were some genuinly funny moments but I signed up to watch a horror movie not a comedy. Read the synopsis for the plot line.

The effects left much to be desired. It was just a total mess.but Tom assured me that his next film (Army of the Damned) would be much better. That should be easy to accomplish.",1383004800,2,727,4.299270072992701

5791055,1,B00DCRE75M,"The first few minutes I thought it was not going to be good but I wanted to give it a chance anyway. About 10 minutes later, I didn't want to finish and it was not because I got squeamish. Low budget and not in a good way.",1380499200,4,222,3.74468085106383

5791064,2,B00DCRE75M,"Self Storage (Tom DeNucci, 2013)

I was sitting on the couch today watching movies and writing my review of the execrable pile of dog dung that is Infected, and when I clicked on Tom DeNucci's name, I saw that he was involved in Self Storage, a movie I had just added to my Netflix queue a few days before. Thus it was that I found myself watching Self Storage a few hours ago. It is not by any means, as awful a film as Infected. Not a great film, by any means, but not a terrible one, either. Though take with as much salt as necessary, given that I'm a sucker for Michael Berryman.

Plot: Jake (DeNucci) is the night guard at a self-storage facility in the middle of nowhere. He's just been chewed out by his boss Walter (The Dark Knight's Eric Roberts) for slacking off on the job when he gets a call from his old pal Rip (Ben Gracia in his first screen appearance); Rip was on his way to a party, with five friends when the location fell through, and can they drop by that night and get plastered? Jake has resolved to straighten up and fly right until he overhears a conversation between Walt and Trevor (Below Zero's Michael Berryman); they are planning to close the facility and let Jake go the next day. Party on? Party on! I'd love to say more about this, but we'd be getting well into spoiler territory; let's just say the party does not go quite as planned.

DeNucci started out working with Glenn Ciano, and to be blunt, he hasn't quite washed the grime off yet; Self Storage is better than Inkubus and is playing in a whole different zip code than the godawful Infected, but it's still somewhat trite, and you'll see most of the twists coming long before they get there. Still, there are a few good acting turns here, and the movie is a bit more understated than the poster would have you believe; not something to go out of your way for, but with a little improvement in the writing and the development of his own directorial style, Tom DeNucci could potentially be going places, and you may well be able to say I watched him when in a few years. **",1393372800,,2064,4.314432989690721
5791065,4,B00DCRE75M,"Jake (Tom DeNucci) works for Eric Roberts and is mentored by Michael Berryman.  He is a security guard at a Rhode Island self storage facility. Eric harvests organs from non-volunteer donors. Berryman helps him. Tonight is supposed to be their last big score and then they are going to close up. Jake overhears he will be out of a job and has a big party at the facility which included shutting off some electrical power, ruining the secret storage of organs. Eric Roberts needs organs ASAP and there is a group of party animals at the facility. Oh what to do. What to do.

The film was funny from a camp point of view. I found myself laughing at scenes when guys try to make the moves on the girls, or when Eric Roberts goes, ""S***, I got the wrong knee."" I enjoyed the dialog and the juxtaposition of the care free party to the seriousness of the organ harvesters.  Kudos Tom DeNucci.

And yes it's somewhat cheesy at times but it's funny, there is supposed to be humor in it. Plus there is gore and a good storyline. I really can't get enough of this movie, watched it way more than a couple times. I have deep appreciation for this movie. My love for it runs deep hahaha. And Nick Principe is my favorite professional bad guy and he's in it for a short part and he's funny! On screen and off. Just give it a try and don't be so picky!",1518825600,,604,4.127118644067797

Eric Roberts and Michael Berryman are the best parts of the movie and really what kept me interested in the overall plot. The other aspects of the film were lackluster and the film of course contained the obligatory and ridiculously silly gratuitous sex scene. However, I honestly enjoyed and thoroughly recommend watching this movie based on the performances of Roberts and Berryman.",1471737600,2,446,5.04054054054054

8591959,1,B00DCRE75M,"With Eric Roberts starring, I was expecting a pretty cheesy movie. With Michael Berryman co-starring, I was expecting a bizarre horror movie. But even knowing what I was in for couldn't have prepared me for the depths of awful that this film produces.

Honestly, I don't even know where to start (not a great thing for a review, I know). I don't think I've ever witnessed more cliche dialogue in my life. It's as if they wanted every line to be a signature iconic moment similar to ""I'll be back."" The difference is that those delivered lines we remember are housed within movies worthy of them. This dialogue really seems to be created by writers/director who truly thought they were witty. Prime example is even in the Trailer when, after everything that goes on, the character is asked what happened to him. The response, ""It's been a pretty rough night."" See for yourself.

Someone actually thought that was clever.

And therein lies just ONE of the many embarrassingly bad factors that make this movie a serious contender for one of the worst movies to every be produced. Trust me, that's not hyperbole.",1470009600,,1108,4.760416666666667
