2869861,5,B000RO6K58,This is really a must for Franz Schubert lovers. It gives a good view on his last years and his difficulties to be recognized as musician by his father.  The actor is perfect in his role and gives agreat dimension to this movie.,1212019200,16,228,4.3023255813953485
2869862,5,B000RO6K58,"Liszt declared Schubert to be the most poetic musician who has ever lived and to this day, he can still be considered one of the greatest composers of all time. He paved the way for aspiring composers with his Romantic melodies. His compositional style progressed rapidly throughout his career, and by the time he died, at the age of 31, he had written a wide range of music in various genres including opera, chamber and solo piano music. For the first time, Kultur released a dramatization of the life and works of this legendary composer. The Double Life of Franz Schubert explores the last two years of Schubert's life and features a large amount of music throughout the film. The movie begins with Schubert falling ill and his friend, poet Franz von Schober finding him and taking him to the hospital. As the doctors diagnose Schubert's symptoms as syphilis, finds their cause and administer treatment, the composer conducts his own internal imaginative examination and constantly thinks back to moments and music from his past life. He recalls his strict father who didn't want him to compose, his patron Michael Vogl, his friend Franz von Schober, and love of his life that inspired much of his music and knew he could never be with, Karoline Esterhazy. Some of Schubert's greatest works had spurred from this horrific period in time, and this DVD thoroughly displays an interesting look at the struggles Schubert faced and the accomplishments he achieved throughout his life. The works that came from Schubert's last two years of life reveal a composer increasingly meditating on the darker side of both his human psyche and human relationships. Schubert's struggle with syphilis, a disease he began fighting in 1822, fuels this fascinating short docudrama. Rather than permit the affliction to destroy his remaining years, the gifted musician used his pains as inspirational fuel for some of his most famous works. Despite grim circumstances, Schubert  doesn't seem to regret abandoning teaching and his stern father to collaborate on an ill fated opera with the poet Franz Von Schober. Indeed, at the end of the film, it is said that Schubert's greatest work was composed in this period. Like Mozart, I always wonder what more glorious music would have been made had Schubert not died so young. Anyone who watches this DVD will certainly appreciate Schubert and his music so much more after you witness the torture and harsh treatment he was put through by doctors, hospital workers, and supposed friends when he was suffering so much.",1191628800,43,2545,5.002358490566038

I love using images from this film for examples of false assumptions of the era.  And then there's the hysterically gross depiction of Schubert himself!  Keeps me amused as I teach, even if my audience doesn't get the joke because of their unfortunately unfamiliarity with this fine, fine morsel of first-rate cinematography.  I have no idea why this movie hasn't received greater distribution.

Sincerely,

8201583,2,B000RO6K58,"Was hard to watch, after years of enjoy the music he composed. Wish I had not seen it, as I will remember the quaity ofr lack there of, of this Man who could write such beautiful music.  Sorry I learned the truch about him.  I had no idea he lived a doiuble life. I think this part of his life should have been handled more respectful.  After all, he is dead and only his music is left behind. After seeing the movie, I will no longer enjoy any thing he composed.  The persons who purchase this should be aware, beforehand, that it has some  parts that the average person would rather not know about his sex life.",1482883200,,613,4.205128205128205
8201584,4,B000RO6K58,"The great music masters where quite a bunch of characters, every one of them it seems but we're still talking about them hundreds of years later.  For their great contributions to the world of some of the most beautiful music ever composed their reward is immortality, they will never be forgotten.  Franz Shubert was not only a musical wizard bit a naughty, naughty, boy which his shenanigans proved to be fatal in the end of his very short life.  It wasn't the best orchestrated film but I bought it more to learn about the composer so it was a good buy for me.  You should like the story although rather depressing at times to witness his suffering.  Thank God for modern medicine.",1393977600,,684,4.573770491803279
8201585,1,B000RO6K58,"No it was disappointing the production and performances were slow and laboured
Simon Russell Beale deserves better direction and Schubert deserves betterstorytelling",1389744000,2,165,6.545454545454546
8201586,2,B000RO6K58,"The film starts with nicely shot scenes of night-time in old Vienna, a horse-drawn carriage speeding along, views of cobblestone streets in the moonlight, so you're primed and ready for a well-told story with great visuals.  What a let-down.  There's very little about the music apart from the soundtrack having snippets from various pieces.  Way too much of the story revolves around his collapse from an advanced case of syphillis, and the gruesome details of his treatment in the filthiest place you've ever seen, not to mention the sadistic orderly.  The actor Simon Russell Beale is well suited to some kind of a role about Schubert, but boy, not this script.  Beale is a good actor, it's too bad he ended up in this movie.  (See instead his tour de force performance as Widmerpool in A Dance to the Music of Time, he is the definitive Widmerpool.)  To sum up, I thought this a rather nasty little movie, and a missed opportunity to tell the story of a great composer who only lived a little over 30 years.  If Amadeus is the primo music movie about a composer, this is the extreme opposite.  Some reviewers thought it was vile;  I see their point.  For those brief bits of cinematography that look so good, and for the music credits, two stars, and that's being generous.",1387497600,3,1277,4.65625
8201587,5,B000RO6K58,Reveals a part of his life not known by many. Schubert's life was full of unhappiness. It's amazing how a composer could give the world so many beautiful works in spite of his suffering.,1354752000,2,186,4.5
8201588,3,B000RO6K58,"First, let me say that I read the other reviews before deciding to order this DVD.  My motivation was not to explore Schubert or his music but to study the prejudices and medical ignorance surrounding his illness.  This explains my three-star rating as contrasted to the thumbs up or thumbs down of other reviewers.

This dramatization lacks balance, but it has ""moments"" but not the quality expected in something like Masterpiece Theatre.

In terms of the DVD itself, I was quite challenged.  The first one I ordered could not be decoded despite no trouble with other DVDs from Kultur.  The second appeared to have the same problem but it eventually played . . . well, that is obvious or I could not be writing a review, but be prepared to download decoding software.

If you think you are going to hear a glorious ""Ave Maria,"" put this out of your mind. The best you get musically is a bit of the Trout Quintet.

This DVD focuses on tragic weaknesses and embraces the conventional stigmatizing views of the ""French"" disease.  However, it is not only about weakness but about the horrors of treatment in a Viennese hospital.  There is no profound dialogue, no wit, no insights into Schubert's muse, and no real relief from darkness.  Oh, there are, as I said, ""moments"" but even these are clouded.

To the best of my understanding, the history of his illness is not reliable.  Schubert apparently knew from age 19 that he had contracted syphilis.  Therefore, even the comments at the end of the DVD are misleading.

I was prepared to be disappointed, but this fell below my expectations.  While awaiting the arrival of the DVD, I watched a lot of videos of Schubert on youtube.com so if it's the music you love, buy a CD and spare yourself the gloom of this feeble attempt to portray something about the composer's premature departure from Earth existence.

As for my personal motivations, I was looking for something redeeming to argue another perspective on spirochetes and a therapy that does not rely on substances known to be toxic.  Even with these unusual motivations, nothing was added to my education.

Then, we have to ask whether to be worthwhile, art needs to reveal more.  In this case, I believe it would have been reasonable to expect more insight into Schubert's torments and source of inspiration.",1286064000,2,2315,4.768844221105527
8201589,1,B000RO6K58,This was a horrible portrayal of a gifted composer. It was absolutely revolting to watch. The producers and writers of this film should be ashamed of themselves. DO NOT BUY THIS DVD.,1249257600,8,182,4.71875
8201590,1,B000RO6K58,"This DVD contains a perversion of this magnificent composer's life by placing a grotesque and demonstrable emphasis on his ailment, his digusting reaction to it and precious little on his creativity.

They apparently believe they are being creative in making this movie by showing Schubert in his suffering drifting into creativity and such when infact all the gore and horror of his disease so graphically depicted detracts from the man and his gift.

Frankly I have never seen anything to equal the gross stupidity and horrid emphasis of this movie with regard to a creative genius. There was so much more that could have positively been done here rather than this excusion into hospital gore and suffering--COMPLETELY dstracting from who and what Scubert was.

That people suffer and have medical problems in life is a common occurence, but not everybody is a Schubert.

This movie is a failure in everyway conceivable and a total waste of an informed viewer's time, a disgrace and a failure in serving the memory of one of the greatest composers ever.

They the producers and directors should hang their head in shame in this artsy fartsy regurgitation and KURTUR should burn all copies of this trash.

I collect composer movie biographies, my favorite films; this one? Trash bin city. A pox on the house of the morons that produced this.

8201591,1,B000RO6K58,"Good music for 50 minutes, but you can get more music for less money from a CD.  The video was not worth watching, it was repulsive. I was disgusted and gave it to our local library.",1233532800,11,182,4.055555555555555
