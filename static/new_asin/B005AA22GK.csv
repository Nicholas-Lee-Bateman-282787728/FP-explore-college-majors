8463252,3,B005AA22GK,This was a very old recording but had some good basic techniques. My 9 year old watched it once and that was it,1518480000,,111,3.869565217391304
8463253,5,B005AA22GK,This is an advanced acro video from the 1980`s.  The instructor gives good advice and explains things well but you should have an understanding of gymnastics before attempting these moves.,1403913600,4,188,5.266666666666667
8463254,5,B005AA22GK,"I got this video several month ago for my children, to help them learn several tricks for school performances. And I got fascinated by it too. Even it looks like it was shoot at late 80-s or early 90-s, information is very valuable and explanation is great. My kids don't have gymnastic training, but they are strong intermediate-advanced yoga practitioners, so, with some practice we were able to do exercises, described in this video. Everything explained step-by-step really well, instructor is very precise and models-students are very accurate. I can recommend this video to gymnastic students, cheerleaders and advanced yoga practitioners to deepen their practice and learn trick or two.",1389744000,2,693,5.3090909090909095
8463255,2,B005AA22GK,"If a short video clip had been available to view, we never would have bought this item.  Despite the new looking cover with a picture of a little girl on it, the video looks to have been made in the early 80's and features only adults who are already expert gymnasts.  The teaching is definitely geared toward adults/teenagers who have already mastered the fundamentals of gynmastics and are very flexible.  The outfits worn by the two female gymnasts who demonstrate all the moves were also immodest enough that we decided we couldn't show the video to our kids.  On the positive side, the teacher does a good job explaining the mechanics of the tumbling moves and pointing out possible mistakes that can be made.  We decided to return the item.",1328918400,17,746,4.707692307692308
