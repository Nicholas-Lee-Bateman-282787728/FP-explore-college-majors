4858168,5,B005QBSSI4,"Very Very thought provoking.  Tackles the subject of freedom in a fun yet strikingly simple format.  There is no such thing as Half Free.

What do you consider your most valuable right.  The right to yourself.  If you have never considered this topic, you don't know what true freedom is.

Get a copy watch it and then share it with your friends, your neighbors and anyone who you can.  This is a message that NEEDS to get out.

Great video.",1323734400,,441,4.425
4858169,5,B005QBSSI4,"This is a pretty amazing and creative low-budget movie (website says it was made for 2100 dollars, it looks like they spent 50 times that). I can't believe this movie wasn't made already by someone else. It's such a no-brainer: Weed people and gun people should support each other's ""hobbies"", regardless of how you personally feel about them, because reduction of one right chips away at the other right. All rights are connected, and most politicians and many people want to steal some of them from you, whether they've got an R or a D after their name.

This movie will irk far-left people, far-right people and statists. But for people who may hang out with one of those crowds but have the smallest INKLING of true liberty and personal responsibility in their soul, it will feel like something they've been searching for their whole life.

The film covers a lot of territory in 99 minutes, much more than guns and weed, it also covers taxes, public schools, small government, anarchy, democracy and more. I think this single movie un-does all the damage that a 12-year public education does. This film should be required viewing in all public schools, though it never will be. If it were, public schools (and all their problems) would cease to be!

I especially liked the ""making of"" DVD extras, some cute bloopers and a window into the minds that made the movie and their plucky process. Great stuff!

The filmmakers are also very accessible, they do the Freedom Feens podcast weekly, and even answered some questions my buddy sent them about the movie.

This is just an absolutely amazing documentary, get extra copies for all your friends who think they ""know it all"", whether they're left or right, whether they're gun folks, weed folks, or something else. This film is also a good test of whether someone really is into true liberty or just wants to control everyone who disagrees with them. Show it to your gun-nut uncle or stoner brother. If they don't walk away from it having learned SOMETHING, or at least agreeing with SOMETHING about the premise of the film, they are a lost cause, and that should color everything they every say to you again.

A bonus is the women in the film: some real stunners, both from the gun side and the weed side, and they're smart and commanding to boot.

There's a lot of solid information in ""Guns and Weed"", but also a lot of humor, something that is sorely lacking in almost all ""activist media.""",1323302400,,2445,4.6985981308411215
4858170,5,B005QBSSI4,"What an excellent and informative film! I was both entertained and educated. The most basic of human rights is surely the right to control one's own consciousness, and as long as the hypocritical 'war on drugs' continues to be senselessly waged, we need informational resources like this to enlighten the sleepwalking masses. In a truly free society, such a policy clearly has no place. The 'guns' aspect of 'Guns and Weed' is equally enlightening. Thanks to the 100 million gun owners in the US, we may yet have a chance to claim the ideals of freedom that this country was (supposed to be) founded on.  Show this film to all of your closed-minded friends.",1323302400,7,657,4.7631578947368425
4858171,5,B005QBSSI4,"What can I say, Guns and Weed is one of the most thought provoking independent films I've ever seen.  The film discusses both the legal ramifications of banning firearms and making marijuana illegal for either patients or recreational users.  The greatest boogeyman of any sort of statist government is the ability of the individual citizen to defend themselves and the right of the same person to ingest any substance they choose - provided they don't hurt others.  The film covers the history of racism's impact on making both marijuana and firearms hard to access for minorities.  Covers world federalism's propaganda against both the 2nd Amendment and individual, inalienable rights.  Shows how governments, departments and pharmacological companies worked to make marijuana illegal.  Also details how prohibition doesn't work, and only feeds the criminal and socialist undergrounds that are trying to overthrow the Constitution of the United States.  Discusses the U.N.'s illegal small arms treaty - which is designed to disarm and enslave the American people to a global system of socialist control.  With a healthy dose of libertarian/anarcho-capitalist philosophy, explains exactly why the American system works well - despite Obama's declaration that the American capitalist system does not work and needs more 'radical' government oversight.  Plenty of guns, lots of good hip hop and filmed in the Great State of Wyoming.",1323302400,3,1431,5.468181818181818
4858172,5,B005QBSSI4,"Not only does this movie make compelling arguments for the legalization of marijuana and firearms, it also skewers the false political dichotomy of left vs right. The real battle is between ""We the people"" and our government overlords, the political class, who would deprive us of life, liberty and property. See the movie!",1310169600,,323,5.113207547169812
4858173,3,B005QBSSI4,What I saw of this documentary was fantastic and I'd have rated it higher if I could have watched the whole thing.  About halfway through the DVD froze up and would not play anymore.,1393459200,,182,4.352941176470588
4858174,5,B005QBSSI4,Love the way they called out both conservatives and liberals for being hypocrites.  Conservatives are for right to bear arms but against freedom to grow a plant and liberals are for freedom to grow a plant but against the right for citizens to bear arms.  Also loved the way they point out that we do not live in a free society as long as government has the ability to take what we have worked our entire lives for.,1392768000,4,415,4.3076923076923075
4858175,5,B005QBSSI4,"Movie makes a great case for the idea that, if you want to be free, you must allow others to be free.  Even if you do not like the way they exercise their freedom.  Also makes a great case for decriminalizing victimless actions.  It is all very libertarian.

Remember: making a law removes a liberty!",1374451200,3,300,4.4

4858177,3,B005QBSSI4,"Several rap sequences were interspersed in the movie, they cheesed up what otherwise would be a good presentation. Very little new information for me, my intent watching it was to recommend it non liberty minded friends. My fear is the rapping will turn them away from the message. Lots of credit is deserved for including the common voices of the nurse and rancher.",1366329600,,366,4.825396825396825
4858178,1,B005QBSSI4,"Bravo. I'm amazed at the quality of #Koch/Tea Party/Ron Paul sponsored propaganda exhibited in this ""film."" As companion films, you all should watch ""The Billionaires Tea Party"" (available on YouTube) and then hop on over to alecexposed(dot)org to see how you're being duped by the same right-wing billionaires who crashed our economy and are currently attempting to relieve you not only of your civil liberties, but also student loans, a living wage, pensions and Social Security, health care and midicare/Medicaid, voting rights, and access to the courts - among other things. But hey, at least we'll all be abe to get high:) Nice job at conning the younsters.

I purchased the ""film"" and will be happy to recommend it to all high shool students and college freshmen enrolled in critical thinking courses. This type of propagandistic garbage would be exactly why Republicans/Libetarians oppose critical thinking in public schools and public education in general. (Texas Republican Party Platform). Pull your heads out of the bongs for a moment and get to Googling.",1364428800,5,1066,5.233918128654971
4858179,5,B005QBSSI4,"I really enjoy this movie. The content, the production, the humor and the music are all top notch. It is Unashamedly libertarian, Anti-Statist and informative. It really drives home the message of all rights being tied together and makes its point in fun way. Its a great movie to show your anti-gun liberal friends as well as your anti-drug conservative ones, in an attempt to open their eyes.
My only gripe is that there is a bit of ""Constitution-humping"" in it, but it really doesn't detract from the message at all.",1362614400,3,519,4.714285714285714
4858180,5,B005QBSSI4,"I don't care if you are a gun-owner, or a pothead, this is a great film to watch. It's not a million dollar budget documentary, and it damn well shouldn't be. Quirky and humorous, but dealing with real issues that nobody in the mainstream would have the cajones to touch. Armed citizens are protectors of their own security, and those citizens have the right to choose what they will experience in life. The anti-marijuana movement started long ago, and the history books won't dare report it, THAT is the inconvenient truth. It's time to turn it around. This movie is a great launch point for the realization that the State should be ignored to the point that it withers away, and ends up no more than useless people in fancy buildings (which they already are). The only power they have is the power you allow them!",1357171200,2,816,4.595890410958904
4858181,4,B005QBSSI4,"Since I agree 100% with the film I'll say the only disappointing bit was the pacing, which occasionally got bogged down and slower than I felt was appropriate.",1354665600,,159,4.714285714285714
4858182,4,B005QBSSI4,"A slightly scattershot critique of the war on drugs, the war on guns and tyranny in general in this country. Kind of hard to review simply because there is almost nothing to compare it to, this is extremely unfortunate.

4858183,5,B005QBSSI4,"In all my years of living I don't think I've ever seen such an Oscar worthy performance given in such an unexpected place. I have watched Guns and Weed over and over. These guys, Michael Dean and Neema Vedadi are absolutely ready for the big time. I have sent this video to every Hollywood producer in the book, still no responses but I'm sure someone will discover the raw talent each trained actor displays. It's only a matter of time.",1349308800,,437,4.475
4858184,4,B005QBSSI4,"If you watch this with an open mind you will be informed and entertained.  However, I personally believe that most of it needs to be re-shot as the production is rather lacking...

some of the graphics look as if they were created on a Windows 95 machine (possibly using Word)

Some of the editing needs to be re-done

Some of the 'interview' sequences look as if they are being acted out

It can give the impression of an 'A' Level assignment - although a very good one at that

At one point my wife demanded I turn it off as watching it can be a bit painful in places

All in all I would be a lot more happy if I had paid a lot less for it (but I'm still glad I've got it).",1342915200,,675,3.9555555555555557
4858185,5,B005QBSSI4,"If you don't already understand that freedom in all things, not just those you are interested in, are connected and reinforce each other this movie will get you thinking about that.

Much of the documentary consists of interviews with people from various backgrounds, walks of life, and professions concerning freedom.  It does not just address the issues of freedom to own and use firearms and weed but uses those as examples of different things that the government restricts.  Usually very different people are concerned about each but the documentary makes the point that both groups of people should support freedom in all things that do not involve aggression against others if they expect freedom in their areas of interest.

The creators of this managed to find a number of interesting, articulate, and impressive people to interview.  They came from different backgrounds but all effectively made the point that individual freedom is important.

I liked some of the ""theater"" and music less than others but that is OK.  This can connect both to those who are looking for a more intellectual argument for freedom as well as those who are more open to an emotional one.  Both are important and both are well presented here.",1336694400,,1229,4.990196078431373
4858186,5,B005QBSSI4,"""Guns and Weed"" is an interesting and well made documentary style video that uses current events, music video interludes, interviews, and satirical sketch humor to make the case the ""Right to Keep and Bear Arms"" and the ""Freedom of Ingestion"" should both be considered ""rights"". This is firmly made with a Libertarian outlook and will certainly not appeal to, and might even offend, those with strong leanings either to the Left or Right of the political spectrum.

From a purely informative standpoint, the video presents a lot of history on both gun control and the war on drugs, going back to the founding of the county, through prohibition, into modern times. While I am an active supporter of the 2nd Amendment and involved in shooting sports, I never gave much thought to ban on ""pot"" since I don't have any interest in that drug for my own use. I did find the history presented and the shocking legislative ties to the ban on marijuana based on severely raciest propaganda eye opening (and verifiable).

From an entertainment standpoint, this was well produced, lively (lots of shooting), and laugh out loud funny in places. There are some disturbing images scattered throughout, so be warned that this might not be appropriate for younger viewers.

I firmly believe that it is important to look at an issue from as many sides as possible before making my mind up about an issue, and this video does provide a good bit of food for thought.

4858187,5,B005QBSSI4,"For anyone who believes in Liberty, Property Rights, and Self Defense, you need to see this movie. If you care about one or the other, this movie will make you see how these two issues are in fact the same issue. That all people should be able to own any property they want, as long as it is obtained in a peaceful, non-aggressive manner. The drug war is a failure and has hurt more people than the drugs themselves ever would. Gun control only disarms and transforms us into victims, needlessly dependent on a state that only cares about its own interests. These guys also do a weekly podcast, Freedom Feens, and I eagerly await it every week. Check this movie out, I truly believe that it could not only change your outlook on Guns and Weed, but your outlook on almost every aspect of your life.",1332979200,,797,4.428571428571429
4858188,5,B005QBSSI4,"By the title of this film I assumed this would be yet another gangsta movie thin of substance or cerebral content. Quite the opposite. First film in a long time which has influenced my political beliefs. It accomplished this fairly and creatively. At times a bit shocking but in retrospect required. Why do we subsidize the alleviation of pain but imprison the pursuit of happiness? Are these not the same thing? Wasnt the constitution written to preserve the pursuit of happiness? To pursue happiness one must have the right to defend their own life. These are inseparable truths rarely mutually agreed upon by gun lovers and weed lovers.

You cant help leave this this film recognizing liberty isn't an a la carte' menu. Its a quantum entangled state and any effort to line item veto the freedom quanta results in enormous efforts, large governments and exponentially more taxes. Fear is the product they sell and we are all suckers for it. The best government starts with yourself and the realization that you can't outsource it with no oversight. 5 stars! A must see!",1332806400,,1071,4.852459016393443
4858189,4,B005QBSSI4,"A great intro into understanding that your natural rights are not granted by government, but are un-alienable and instilled in you at birth.
It is not very technical (compared to Thomas Woods, Peter Schiff or Dr Ron Paul), but is easy to digest and gives you a nice broad perspective.
It really isn't about firearms and drugs. It is about YOU, as an individual, being responsible for your own person.

Michael W. Dean does an outstanding job of showing the connection between the importance of the 2nd amendment in maintaining our freedom, and how the war on drugs is being used as little more than an excuse to whittle away out everyone's (not just drug users') freedoms, aside from being a complete and utter failure.  It's a piece that is written for ""both sides,"" in an effort to show that ultimately the battle is not between ""gun nuts"" and statists, nor is it between ""druggies"" and statists, but is really a battle between all free men and women and statists, and the two party system is merely a convenient means to divide and conquer.",1329696000,,1008,4.43956043956044
