In this one the VHS tape is all but gone, although the bad tracking and lines associated with VHS are still there in digital cameras. The film consists of several disjointed episodes of which the Magician segment seems to be the favorite. I know it was mine, it wasn't a hand held camera. It consists of a magician with a magic cape that consumes humans, similar to what the VHS tape would do. There is a group of skate boarders who get in trouble with Mexican zombies. A man creates a portal to a parallel universe and trades places with himself. The main episode which starts and finishes the film as well as pops up from time time, consists of rescue vehicles circling through the city which has Kevin's (Patrick Lawrie) girlfriend Iris (Emilia Ares Zoryanand). He wants her back and chases on bicycle.

The episodes by themselves weren't bad, but overall the story lacked cohesiveness.
