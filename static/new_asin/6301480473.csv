336309,3,6301480473,"The Hound of the Baskervilles is the greatest case from the Sherlock Holmes series in the paper format by Sir Arthur Conan Doyle, As far as Granada TV is concerned they have given the right justice to the Sherlock Holmes character by forwarding a great Artist Late Mr. Jermy Brett in leading role. I am the fan of Brett as and Holmes. He is the best holmes I ever seen.
This VHS gives me a very disappointing experience considering Brett's performance (may because of his health), Horrifying environment on moor, All character (except Dr. Watson) especially Henry Baskerville, Stepelton and his sister (they are all just nonsense), Director is lacking in all fronts. The Dog is not looking as terrible as it should. The movie is bit slow and not apealing though I am the fan of Brett and Sherlock Holmes.",1040601600,6,804,4.709219858156028
336310,5,6301480473,"This version of Hound was the most anticipated and in 1988 it lived up to it's hype. Everything about this version is perfect including the brilliant portrayals of Holmes and Watson, by Jeremy Brett and Edward Hardwicke, the support cast are excellent as is the production value. Basically the best version of Hound as played by the best Holmes-Watson actor's. Five stars is not enough.",1038787200,4,386,4.953846153846154
336311,5,6301480473,"This is a beautiful film.  The settings and costumes are so good, they transport the viewer back to the moors of Victorian England.
But what really makes this film first rate is the tension between the supernatural and the cold logic of the scientific method as personified by Holmes. In a line taken directly from the book, Holmes allows: ""if ever the devil were to dabble in the affairs of man, it would be here"".  A remarkable statement for a man of Holmes' character.
I've never seen the Rathbone version, but I've seen this one half a dozen times and still enjoy it.",996364800,5,571,4.533980582524272
336312,5,6301480473,"Apparently when writing his review laddie5 is unaware of Jeremy Brett's heart condition that affected his performance slightly in his later performances as the world's greatest ""unofficial"" Detective. Quite honestly, I think Jeremy Brett's later performances as Holmes were among his best. Even up to the end. Everybody considers Basil Rathbone to be the definitive Holmes, which I think is utter nonsense. Most of the later movies with Rathbone as Holmes don't even take place in Victorian England but have Holmes in current settings (well current in 1940) which I think is because they couldn't afford the Victorian backdrops and all that. Jeremy Brett not only looks the way Sir Arthur Conan Doyle wrote the character, but performs the part with all of Holmes's quirks and short comings. Such as his cocaine and morphine addictions (that's right, Holmes was an addict).
This version of ""The Hound of the Baskerville"" follows Sir Arthur Conan Doyle's version very closely and is among the best productions of his the author's most famous stories. Watson takes center stage in this story as he tries to uncover the Baskerville curse of a demonic hound that haunts the moors. Edward Hardwicke is probably one of the best screen Watson's to date. Much like his predecessor in the Granada series David Burke (who did a great job as Watson), he plays Watson as the intelligent man of medicine that Conan Doyle wrote in his books and not the hamfisted bungler that has smeared the character since Nigel Bruce played the character. Hopefully, future productions of Holmes will continue this tradition with Watson's character.
The production itself is very well done and atmospheric. A really fine cast (those of you who can remember will recognize the actor from ""The Bounder"")and a brilliant performance by Jeremy Brett which does not lack in the least bit. If you are to buy any copy of ""The Hound of the Baskervilles"" make this your first. The definitive production starring the definitive Sherlock Holmes",991440000,51,2003,5.054380664652568
336313,1,6301480473,"A true disappointment, since Jeremy Brett was at one time an arresting and original Sherlock Holmes. But this episode signaled that something had gone terribly wrong with this series: its a miserably acted and directed charade that captures nothing of the novel's drama and suspense. And Brett, in the first throes of the heart disease that would eventually kill him, looks dreadful and is almost inaudible. Put this thing side-by-side with the wonderful ""Hound"" of 1939 (with its stylish recreation of the Victorian era) and you'll see how superior Basil Rathbone was -- dynamic, glamorous, and almost gleefully self-assured.",965520000,8,626,5.333333333333333
336314,5,6301480473,"I have now seen several productions of 'The Hound of the Baskervilles', including the Basil Rathbone and Hammer versions, but of all that I have seen this is the definitive production.
I agree that the Hound doesn't  look very 'spooky' or 'Ghostly', but let's face it, it is just a dog and  not a ghost (obviously! ) so it would have been a bit silly to fall into  the trap of making it look like a ghost (like so many other films have),  only for Holmes to reveal at the end that it wasn't.
In fact I think that  this just goes to improve the 'realism' of the story, and along with the  usually excellent performance from Jeremy Brett as Holmes, this video is an  absolute must.",963014400,16,679,4.299212598425197

That being said, the movie is rather slow at times and suffers from an ""under-abundance"" of Brett as this story is one that focuses more heavily on Dr. Watson. Edward Hardwicke does an admirable job as Watson and the other actors are good as well, especially the Stapleton character. I do wish the story had a more vibrant energy, and that's why I deducted one star. If you haven't watched any of the BBC Holmes videos with Brett, do yourself a favor and watch them before you see this. You will appreciate Brett all the more.",1478390400,,711,4.469230769230769

Just some fact about Russian version: British Ambassador on behalf of Queen Elizabeth II awarded Vasily Livanov with the Order of the Commander of the British Empire.

336694,5,6301480473,"It has been many years since I read the original story by Conan Doyle.  Fortunately for me there are many movie versions of the tale, one of my favorites of Sherlock Holmes.  I have 5 different versions of ""Hound"", 3 of which are excellent and the other two (both made within the past 15 years) not bad -- they do suffer by comparison but aren't really bad.

I have long enjoyed watching a good story that is told slightly differently, as long as it's a good, strong story -- a few changed details, a different cast of actors (NOT characters!) always seems to make my day.  ""Hound of the Baskervilles"" and Dickens' ""A Christmas Carol"" are two that I like, each having a number of good versions available.

My favorites for ""Hound"" are the 1938 Basil Rathbone version, the 1959 Peter Cushing/Christopher Lee version and this one with Jeremy Brett from 1988.  Each tells the tale a  little differently but preserves the overall story.

If you like Holmes, you could do worse than to give this version a try.",1438560000,4,1005,4.575418994413408

336796,5,6301480473,"Jeremy Brett is the definitive Sherlock Holmes, and Edward Hardwicke is an excellent Dr. Watson. I preferred David Burke's portrayal of Watson - and, the chemistry, between Brett and Burke, was as close as it could get, to having Holmes and Watson walk off the pages of Conan Doyle's stories, and onto the screen. Having said that - Hardwicke does a very good job of playing Watson, but he does get more than a tad overshadowed, by Brett's Holmes..

This is the best version dramatized of the Hound of the Baskervilles - but to be honest, it felt a little rushed to me.. Some of the minor plot incidents, in Conan Doyle's narrative, were omitted, and as such, things seemed to develop towards the climax, without giving us a chance to savor the net closing in on Sir Henry Baskerville, as Watson tries to understand the danger surrounding  the baronet.

Still I rate this the most faithful version -- certainly most of the other versions filmed miss the mark completely, so I highly recommend this one.",1430352000,,1002,4.681818181818182

336986,5,6301480473,"Jeremy Brett ""once explained that 'some actors are becomers -- they try to become their characters. When it works, the actor is like a sponge, squeezing himself dry to remove his own personality, then absorbing the character's like a liquid.'"" -Wiki. It worked for Jeremy Brett as the quintessential Sherlock Holmes

Jeremy Brett was voted the greatest Sherlock Holmes ever in 2014. As regards ""The Hound of the Baskervilles"", Holmes and Watson are where they should be, certainly not in modern England or in the 1940s when Basil Rathbone held sway, but in Victorian England. Brett is superb to watch as Holmes, he is almost twitchy with mental energy and when he smiles the smile does not hover. And yet he can laugh uproariously. He is capable of great sympathy as he more or less folds Stapleton's embattled wife Beryl against his breast. and almost rocks the young Sir Henry after the Hound had attacked the young man. Kristoffer Tabori is very endearing as the young Sir Henry Baskerville. Perhaps there is a touch of the outre about Conan Doyle's Holmes, and Brett's expressive face reflects Holmes' sheer oddity. Brett as Sherlock is touching, he is a treasure and so fleeting as Brett died at 61.

Although Nigel Bruce was dearly loved as a bumbling but thoroughly loyal Dr. Watson, Edward Hardwicke is much closer to the Canon, his Watson also loyal but steady, the epitome of the kind of gentleman that is the backbone of England. In ""Hound"" Watson capably knows how to handle a gun, he would follow Sherlock Holmes to the end of the earth if necessary and give his life for his friend, and Holmes would die for Watson. They are a partnership carved in stone.

The photography in ""Hound"" is absolutely gorgeous and especially wonderful at night with the moon rising above the tor and gas lights shining eerily on Baskerville Hall. And of course the phosphorescent gigantic hound suddenly appearing in the mists and fog is very satisfying. The Moor ""is where the powers of evil are exalted."" A beautiful film in every respect.",1400284800,4,2035,4.808571428571429

So, I thought I would watch this Jeremy Brett version of the story, and see how well it brought it to life.  I did enjoy Brett's performance and the scenery of the moor, the manor, etc. were all vivid.  But, they take so many liberties with the story - changing characters, scenes, plot lines, in several places, that I was left a little disappointed.  I'll keep looking to see if I can find a movie that is truer to the original tale - maybe the Basil Rathbone version from 1939.",1394841600,,597,4.4495412844036695

This time, Sherlock and John got Sir Charles who has a same nightmare from childhood. And it bothered him through him grow up, and he still cant forget the terrible scene, a hound killed his ancestor. Then they went to Baskervilles together and want to found the truth. On the way, Dr Watson who is Sherlocks best partner has encountered a lot of strange things, such as women crying sadly in the middle of the night, and the  Barrymore whose the Baskervilles old houses housekeeper did suspicious behavior at night, and he found a letter before the death of Sir Charles that is not been completely destroyed .These interesting events come one by one, when the danger coefficient increased, truths veil is also ready to open. In the end, you would never guess about. That is one of the reasons why I like this stories. When I was reading it, I was like on the real situation. The authors words bring me into danger, I can feel Sherlock being scared and nervous as well. And I really like this stories plot. It is really attractive that I can not stop reading it until the end.

337149,3,6301480473,"The Hound of The Baskervilles has always been a favorite story of mine, and I looked forward to seeing it as a movie.  On the whole, I was not disappointed, but neither was I impressed.

The casting is not at fault, but Brett's health was deteriorating, and it showed; Hardwicke was fine, though I will always prefer David Burke as Watson.  Sir Henry looks just as described in the book, and all the minor characters were well cast and acted.  The faults of this movie lie in the way that some of the pivotal scenes are depicted.  When Watson discovers that Holmes is on the moor, rather than allowing the suspense build and allow the audience to wonder who is walking toward the hut, they choose to reveal that it is Holmes, which in my opinion drains the excitement out of this scene.  The scene in which the hound attacks Sir Henry is unexceptional; it would have been nice if they had had Lestrade come with Watson and Holmes, rather than substituting with Dr. Mortimer.  On the bright side, some of the scenes such as when Holmes serves his gross stew to Watson, in the beginning when they first meet Dr. Mortimer, and a few other minor scenes were very well done.

Over all, this movie is satisfying, though not extraordinarily well depicted or filmed.  It is fun to watch every now and then, even with it's faults.  I wouldn't start off with this, but if you've seen all the earlier episodes by Granada, then go ahead and give it watch.",1367798400,2,1443,4.494252873563219

The entire Grenada series is worth getting in pieces or as a whole if it can be afforded, and these movies are an essential part as they include The Hound of the Baskervilles and The Sign of Four among them.  The others are The Last Vampyre (a bit slow moving to start but enjoyable), The Noble Bachelor (very slow starting and a bit hard to follow until the second half is reached), and The Master Blackmailer (also a bit slow starting but gets engaging by the end of half an hour).

The Hound of the Baskervilles has long been a favorite (the Rathbone version and the Roxburgh/Grant version, which also features Ron Cook--perhaps the greatest Richard III ever filmed--in the understated role of Barrymore).

337202,5,6301480473,"HOUND OF THE BASKERVILLES is arguably the most famous of all the many Sherlock Holmes tales. Therefore it is appropriate that it is also the best of the five feature films Granada TV made with Jeremy Brett and Edward Hardwicke - indeed, it is the only one of the movies which is of the same superb quality as their television series.

BASKERVILLES finds Sherlock Holmes and Dr. Watson summoned from the cozy confines of Baker Street to far-away Baskerville Hall, which sits on the edge of the vast and gloomy Grimpen Mire, a bog known to swallow the unwary traveler alive. Sir Charles Baskerville, the wealther owner of the Hall, has died under mysterious circumstances, apparently the victim of an old family curse which says everyone of his line will be haunted by a huge, murderous hound. And indeed, by the body are the pawprints of an animal the size of a calf. Sir Charles' heir, Harry Baskerville, has arrived from America to claim his huge inheritance, but no sooner does he arrive than anonymous notes warn him he will be the hound's next victim. Complicating matters is the presence of an escaped lunatic on the mire, who seems to have a connection of some sort with Baskerville's servants; a mysterious couple named Stapleton who seem to be operating from dubious motives; and a number of other people who may or may not have a grudge against the Baskerville clan. Holmes and Watson find themselves confronted not merely with the task of safeguarding Harry's life, but with a pair of entwined mysteries: who killed Charles Baskerville, and are they investigating a murder or an act of supernatural revenge?

BASKERVILLES is a solid and entertaining mystery with plenty of twists, but what really sells this version is the riveting performance of Jeremy Brett as Holmes, backed up as always by the endearingly stolid Edward Hardwicke as Watson. Their interplay is classic: the scene where Watson refuses to eat Holmes' cooking with the remark, ""It is disgusting, Holmes,"" and Holmes replies, with a stricken face, ""Yes...yes it is!"" made me laugh out loud, as did the pompous compliment Holmes gives Watson: ""You yourself are not luminous, but you are a conductor of light....Some people have no genius themselves but have a gift for sparking it in others. My dear fellow, I am in your debt."" Mint!

If this movie has a flaw, it is the absence of Holmes for a goodly part of the story, but Hardwicke and the supporting actors manage to pull everything off without much trouble. I can't even begin to guesstimate the number of men who have played Sherlock Holmes over the years, but of all that legion, Jeremy Brett is far and away the best. Quite simply put, he IS Sherlock Holmes; the rest were just actors. Not all the scripts handed to him were worthy of his genius, but this one was, and it is well worth both your money and your time.",1323216000,,2849,4.7283702213279675
337203,4,6301480473,"I confess that, even as a Sherlock Holmes fan, I hadn't watched this version of The Hound of the Baskervilles until recently.  This is an adaptation that is quite successful in translating the feel of the novel, even if everything isn't perfect. As others have stated, this film effective establishes the appropriate atmosphere, with a feel that is gloomy, supernatural, and a bit gothic, in the telling of the story and the Baskerville curse.  Jeremy Brett, although quite different from Basil Rathbone, does a commendable job, even if he is absent much due to the story's plot. As other have stated, The Hound of the Baskervilles is one novel that has Holmes missing in action for a good deal of the plot (as a clever device, of course), so we only can judge Brett as Holmes when he reenters the scene. This version is also adept at focusing on critical minor characters that are central to the unraveling of events later in the story, something mostly missing from earlier adaptations.

It is a solid depiction of Doyle's famous mystery in an overall sense, but I thought that the ending was a bit rushed, the conclusion and resolution lacking the tension that the first part of the film builds to. There is so much time in the film spent establishing the supernatural aspect of the curse and the hound, with Watson, Sir Henry, and Mortimer and others arriving to the estate to see the strange happenings and suspected people at Baskerville; so, to have it ended in a rather slight fashion was a bit anticlimactic.

Holmes fans may also notice a vast difference between Nigel Bruce's Watson and Edward Hardwicke's Watson. While Hardwicke is more inclined to be associated with the Watson in the novel, Bruce brings a wittiness and charismatic touch to Watson. I enjoyed the Bruce version of Watson myself, but fans can judge for themselves.

Still, this is an effective version of The Hound of the Baskervilles, entertaining and fun to watch, and I'm ready to see more from the Jeremy Brett and Edward Hardwicke series.",1316908800,,2022,4.7988505747126435
337204,3,6301480473,"This DVD set of 5 feature length Sherlock Holmes films starring Jeremy Brett is definitely worth owning because 3 of the films are excellent.  I cannot give the set as a whole more than 3 stars though because 1 of the films is only fair and 1 is terrible.  The Hound of the Baskervilles and The Sign of Four are done from the novels of the same name and are both superb.  One only wishes that Granada had also done A Study in Scarlet and The Valley of Fear, also novels, at the same time.  The Master Blackmailer is taken from the short story Charles Augustus Milverton (from the Return of Sherlock Holmes story series), and while a bit overextended as feature length fims based on short stories can be, is still an excellent production.  It was made in 1991, the last year that Jeremy Brett enjoyed reasonably good health.  Things go downhill very fast from here though.  The Eligible Bachelor is based on the short story The Adventure of the Noble Bachelor (form the Adventures of Sherlock Holmes story series), and was made in 1992.  Jeremy Brett died in 1993 and was clearly in very ill health by 1992 from a lifetime of chain smoking.  His customary zeal and energy which set the tone for the previous Sherlock Holmes TV series has largely vanished in this film, which is not bad but is a bit draggy.  Still worth a watch and and deserves to be included with this movie set.  Not so with the The Last Vampyre, (very) loosely based on the short story The Adventure of the Sussex Vampire (from the Casebook of Sherlock Holmes story series).  The adaptation of the Conan Doyle story is dreadful, and while Jeremy Brett soldiers on as best he can here, his health was so poor by that time that his presence can hardly make a dent in counteracting the dreadful story.  The Last Vampyre was a completely ill advised production and is unwatchable.  A far cry from The Hound of the Baskervilles and The Sign of Four, and it is very sad to see Jeremy Brett ending his career as Sherlock Holmes in this fashion.",1305072000,4,2006,4.475274725274725

337207,5,6301480473,"A rich American disappears on her wedding day, just after she sees something during the ceremony, in this interesting but perhaps overdramatized Sherlock Holmes adventure. An impoverished English lord with huge gambling debts marries the American to induce her father to pay his debts and finance his future. The lord has a mistress who is an actress and this is his third marriage. His first wife died mysteriously and he annulled the second from a wife who then disappears.

 Holmes is bored, depressed, and feels sorry for himself because he has no intelligent adversary after the death of Dr. Moriarty. People request his help for minor matters, including a lost cat. He revives when the missing heiress' husband requests his help in finding her and when a strange veiled woman comes to his apartment making the same request.

 This is a typical Holmes adventure; but some viewers may find it overdramatized, while others may want to delve deeper into its meaning. The film begins with images of insanity and confusion; people scream and run amuck. Holmes has a repetitious amorphous disturbing nightmare filled with wild images. This suggests that a plot about insanity. But is this true? Is this a red herring? Is this furor at all necessary?

 On the other hand, the film seems to have other predictions. Holmes asks whether his dreams may be a prophecy of what will occur, as the ancients thought. Indeed, some dream images reappear in the film. Does this have any meaning? Does it add to the story?

 Most significantly, perhaps, is the very brief, seemingly gratuitous scene, where Holmes visits a theater and sees the husband's mistress practicing for a performance of Ibsen's play Ghosts. Among other issues, this brilliant play - see my review on Amazon - highlights that a bad act produces another. It also derides the conventional morality of the time that spouses should remain married even though the marriage is destroying one or both of them. Is this insertion into the film a suggestion of an added dimension: that we should see the evil acts as natural progressions from one another and that, in distinction from the Ibsen play, the husband has found a way to avoid having his marriage harm him?",1296345600,,2216,4.906417112299465
337256,4,6301480473,"This 1988 ""The Hound of the Baskervilles"" film, based on Sir Arthur Conan Doyle's 1902 novel, was among a handful of feature-length episodes in Granada Television's Sherlock Holmes series, starring Jeremy Brett as the brilliant Victorian sleuth. There have been more than 20 cinematic adaptations of ""The Hound of the Baskervilles"", and I confess that I have probably seen only one of them, so I can't compare. But fans of Jeremy Brett's Sherlock Holmes will view the film in the context of that series. It has one of the more convoluted plots in the series, and we see less of Holmes than fans would probably like. Watson is on his own for half the film, communicating with Holmes by post. It also has a subdued and self-consciously eerie tone.

A Dr. Mortimer (Neil Duncan) approaches Sherlock Holmes with the mysterious death of his patient Sir Charles Baskerville. Sir Charles died at the door of Baskerville Hall, the family estate, of an apparent heart attack. The Baskerville family is said to haunted by a curse from a century ago, when one of their ancestors abducted a girl, who escaped only to be torn apart by a hound sent to track her down. Ever since then, a giant hound is said to haunt the moor near the estate at night. Sir Charles' brother Henry (Kristoffer Tabori), an American, is heir to the estate and plans to set himself up as an English squire. But Dr. Mortimer fears Sir Henry's life may be in danger. Holmes agrees and orders Watson (Edward Hardwicke) to stay with Henry at all times.

Watson is left wishing Holmes were there, but he develops a friendship with Sir Henry, whose generosity and efforts to adapt to the English country life make him sympathetic and appealing. There seem to be no fewer than three mysteries on the moor, actually, and a strange collection of characters, including a phrenologist, an entomologist, secretive domestic staff, and a young woman who has run off with an artist. The tone is a little flat and talky. In consideration of the supernatural nature of the legend of the hound, the filmmakers have turned up the spooky score and dark imagery. It conveys a certain heaviness. That's not necessarily a bad thing, but I did feel the film's length at times. It's an imperfect but atmospheric and meticulous adaptation.",1284076800,,2276,4.774111675126903
337257,4,6301480473,"An old production of the BBC, but quite feasible still today. Don't expect special effects of course but the story is told just nice and clean. In this story you have all that could be frightening for the Victorians at the end of the 19th century. A blood line that could get lost or rather spoiled by the unknown son of one of the heirs of a title. The heir himself is dead but the son is coming strong. Then a monster animal of the dog family. The English have always liked dogs, but they seem to be afraid of some of them. A howling dog on a moor is of course quite frightening at night with a little bit of fog. Then a couple of loose women who are ready to do too much for a certain price without asking too many questions. When one of them does then she is nicely tied up clean and tight. Then some faithful servants but with divided loyalties because of a relative that is not very clean and they want to protect. That will reveal the good heart of the aristocracy. Then a few locals, vaguely seen between, two curtains and two doors that add some local color to the screen. And finally know-it-all Sherlock Holmes whose fame isn't to know the criminal but to trap him into accepting his guilt and proving it all by himself. He always succeeds so no problem there again. The only question is the punishment of that criminal. Will the police be brought into the picture or will they not? Will he hang or will he die in a more refined way. You have to go and watch the film pr just read Sir Conan Doyle.

I don't recall the particular adventure that Holmes and the ever-faithful Watson were emerged however the reaction of my wife during the denouement was remarkable.

She was crying.

I believe that only Jeremy Brett's portrayal could have caused such a reaction.  Of all the dozens and dozens of actors that have taken on the role of Holmes it is Brett's characterization that most truthfully brings out Holmes' deep humanity.

If you haven't enjoyed Mr. Brett in his portrayal of Sherlock Holmes you are indeed in for a treat, you will be watching an actor, who more than any other, embodies the true nature of the great detective.",1226016000,2,792,4.751824817518248
337264,2,6301480473,"I bought the whole Granada series and watched several other episodes before this. Of course, everyone is familar with Rathbone's version of this story. While I haven't seen it for many years, I do remember the eerie setting and Basil's tight portryal of Holmes (nevermind Bruce's Watson).
So I had high hopes for this, but I was quite disappointed. Just watch ""The Blue Carbuncle"" or ""The Reheaded League"", or even ""The Solitary Cyclist"" and see what Jeremy Brett can do. Some of the early episodes of this series are actually better than the Doyle stories. Brett fought hard to make the producers stick close to Doyle's stories, and where he was sucessful, we have simply the best Holmes possible. It is doubtful that anyone will ever eclipse Brett at his best. I also much prefer Burke's Watson to Hardwicke's. Although Hardwicke is not bad, I feel that he is always slightly upstaging Brett. With Burke, however, the two are perfectly matched. In fact, I feel that Burke is as good as Watson as Brett is as Holmes.
But back to the Baskervilles. I was pleasantly surprised by the locations, and by Baskerville hall itself. I can just say that at almost every key scene, unfortunately, the direction is just wrong. When Watson is hiding in the hut from the Man on the Tor, although we know what's about to happen, the directors absolutely RUIN the scene by showing Holmes strolling up the path and smiling, and just having a nice day. This guts any tension that was building, and though Holmes calls Watson out, as in the book, the whole reunion is needlessly and stupidly ruined.
My other main gripe is when the hound finally appears. There is little build up here as well, and when they all finally see the mutt, they just blast it to hell. What happened to all of the horror and terror? Who's afraid of a stinking Rottweiler with Glowing Green Goop on it? In the book, everyone is so keyed-up that when it finally appears, Lestrade hits the dirt like a whimpering coward. I saw the Rathbone movie many times before I read the story, but Doyle handles this most important scene with great skill. They could have easily brought this through in the TV production, but they didn't.
Is it worth watching? Sure, although I don't know if I'll view it again. I probably will, and maybe it will grow on me. But this should have been the best of the series, and while it's certainly not the worst (the truly hideous 'Bachelor' mess gets that award) it could have easily been more than it is.",1214870400,9,2485,4.611738148984198

337298,4,6301480473,"""The Sherlock Holmes Feature Film Collection"" contains five Sherlock Holmes tales produced at TV movie length.  These Grenada television productions star Jeremy Brett as the Sherlock Holmes of his generation and Edward Hardwick as a most excellent Dr. Watson.

Two of the five entries are obvious picks for feature film treatment: ""The Hound of the Baskervilles"" and ""The Sign of Four."" Each was originally published as a short novel; the stories readily fit a movie format.  ""The Hound of the Baskervilles"" has long been a favorite for movie adaptation.  Fans will not be disappointed with this entry, in which Holmes and Watson tackle the case of a family seemingly haunted by the curse of a giant spectral killer.  This adaptation is faithful to the story, well-cast and well-executed.

""The Sign of Four"", about the mysterious and murderous hunt for an ancient Indian treasure, is also a faithful and successful adaption of the short novel of the same name.  The one obvious difference is that Miss Morstan, who brings the case to the attention of Holmes and Watson, does not marry the good doctor at story's end.

""The Master Blackmailer"" is an extended but entirely acceptable version of the short story ""The Adventure of Charles Augustus Milverton"" in which Holmes seeks to retrieve compromising documents from a skilled blackmailer.  Holmes and Watson must resort to burglary to settle the case, which has been padded to feature length without materially changing the story.

""The Eligible Bachelor"" is a much extended adaptation of ""The Adventure of the Noble Bachelor.""  Holmes and Watson must find the missing bride of a nobleman, and in the process save another woman accused of her disappearence.  The presentation is adequate but the padded plot seems a little flat; this story was not an obvious choice for a feature film.

""The Last Vampyre"" is an ill-considered adaptation of ""The Adventure of the Sussex Vampire.""  The original story has been twisted almost beyond recognition to permit Holmes to confront a man who may, or may not, be a real vampire.  The movie is suitably atmospheric for a gothic horror tale and strives hard to maintain ambiguity about the nature of the vampyre until the end.  However, Holmes is not fooled, and neither will be many viewers.  The padding of the story to include a foolish young child is a distraction from the plot.

This collection of films featuring Jeremy Brett as Sherlock Holmes is in spite of its imperfections still highly recommended as entertaining fare.  ""The Hound of the Basekervilles"" and ""The Sign of Four"" easily justify the other entries.",1205971200,3,2611,5.030232558139535

The Brett performances are magnificient, as are his co-stars...Hardwicke as Watson and Charles Gray as Mycroft.

 Brilliant work., October 30, 2007

Without any doubt, Jeremy Brett brilliantly captured the essence of Sherlock Holmes. The arrogance, the sly humor, the over-the-top outlandish mannersims and reactions (that enigmatic quick smile) were perfect. I love Basil Rathbone's Holmes, especially since many portraits favor him; however, Brett's performances are par excellence...there has been none better and I would imagine no one will ever be able to top it.

Not only is his Holmes perfect, Hardwicke as Watson and Charles Gray as Mycroft are also brilliant. If I could rate Brett as 10 stars, I would. If you like Sherlock Holmes and have never seen Brett's portrayal, you are in for a fantastic treat!",1197936000,,751,5.139344262295082
337302,4,6301480473,"This has all five of the feature length films produced by Granada TV in a sturdy (plastic) boxed set. So you get 7 hours and 30 minutes of the best ever portrayal of Sherlock Holmes by Jeremy Brett. All the episodes are very well adapted, although occasionally slightly over-stretched and in the case of the The Last Vampyre veering off from the original story somewhat. Overall though, just like the TV series it hangs on Jeremy Bretts stunning performance as Holmes. Yes Edward Hardwicke is excellent as Watson, but its Brett who commands every scene he's in.

There are two reasons I've not given it five stars. Firstly I didn't think the DVD transfer was that great. A little bit more effort on this front would have improved things quite a bit. Secondly Jeremy Brett was quite ill when some of these feature length films were made and it shows. His portrayal is still definitive, but sadly because of illness he just doesn't quite have the same dash and spark, or look as good, as he did in the first two TV series (when he was at his absolute peak).

337355,3,6301480473,"For awhile I was meaning to see Jeremy Brett's interpretation of Sherlock Holmes, so several days ago I rented 'The Hound of the Baskervilles', which is an episode from 'The Return of Sherlock Holmes' TV series made by Granada Television. It was made in 1988, so I was expecting the production values to be on par with the 'Poirot' series from 1989 starring David Suchet as another ingenious sleuth, but this incarnation of the master of detectives hasn't aged very well.

Jeremy Brett is excellent as Holmes, generally held by many as the ultimate interpreter of the famous private eye, who stayed in character the entire time, never for a moment letting the audience forget who he is. Edward Hardwicke does an admirable job as Holmes' loyal assistant Dr. Watson, but his performance is a bit wooden at times.

The story itself is quite intriguing, involving a seemingly cursed estate out in the English countryside, in which generations of wealthy family members all succumb to the horrible fate of a legendary demon hound, also known as the hound of the Baskervilles. After a brief introduction to Sir Charles Baskervilles who is the current resident of the Baskervilles estate, the story skips ahead to Holmes and Dr. Watson who are greeted by the representative to the last living Baskervilles heir who hails from America, and he asks for their assistance regarding the infamous family curse. Holmes and Dr. Watson quickly realize that there is more to this story than meets the eye, so they decide to take the case and solve the mystery of the Hound of the Baskervilles. Dr. Watson is sent out ahead of Holmes to do some preliminary investigations in the small village in which the mystery is taking place, and from there the plot thickens.

Overall, the film feels a little incomplete. The special effects are nearly dreadful considering that this was made in the late 80s, a time in which movie effects had come quite far, so this aspect brought the movie down a bit in terms of credibility. Also the production values appeared to be skimpy, which hurt the story's atmosphere somewhat. Fortunately the acting was this film's saving grace, for the most part.

Story wise I felt that not enough time was spent on the various characters to explain their motivations, which made the ending rather anti-climactic. Having not read the book, I cannot say how well the story works in this regard, but perhaps this tale was better suited for the written medium and not the cinematic one since some of the plot devices weren't adapted that well.

Given the aforementioned reasons, I'd recommend skipping this incarnation of Holmes unless one is a die hard fan, but I am nevertheless impressed by Jeremy Brett so I will definitely seek out the rest of this series to see how the other episodes hold up.",1176595200,,2799,4.822916666666667

I just feel that people should know that this DVD offers image quality barely superior to VHS videotape. I know that better results are obtainable. The last Granada series of shorter Sherlock Holmes programs has excellent image quality. This is fuzzy, lacks contrast, it's just plain substandard.

Sooner or later they will remaster these with improved quality, and then you'll be stuck with the old, crummy first edition. But given the importance of the Brett Holmes series, they should have taken the trouble to get it right the first time.",1175990400,2,762,4.809160305343512

Despite my disappointment in the rather tame portrayal of the hound, and in the lack of a pervasive sense of preternatural horror, the film is entertaining enough that I have watched it three or four times in the six weeks since I purchased it.

Since Sherlock Holmes is absent for much of the film, Edward Hardwicke as Dr. Watson is given a chance to carry much of the load, and he does so ably.  We see events largely through his eyes, and his own personality has sufficient depth to sustain our interest.  Frankly, it is good to see more of Watson than we do in the shorter Holmes stories, and Hardwicke brings a gravitas to the role notably absent in the lovable but buffoon-like portrayal of Nigel Bruce.

Kristoffer Tabori is well-cast as the strong-willed, no-nonsense Sir Henry Baskerville, and Fiona Gillies plays a very attractive and sexy Beryl Stapleton.  Ronald Pickup and Rosemary McHale are excellent as the suspicious butler, Barrymore, and his haunted wife.

Sherlock Holmes is forever associated with the murky streets of London, but I enjoy the episodes where he is out in the country, chasing his prey across the moor.  This is one such episode, and a strength of this film is that it - unlike the 1939 version - was filmed on-location, giving us magnificent vistas of the bleak-but-beautiful Engish countryside.

This film omits the seance sequence that was added in to the 1939 version, but retains the character of Laura Lyons, who was dropped from the earlier film.  Regrettably, this film drops the London assassination attempt early in the story, missing a much-needed dramatic element. But this version follows the original Doyle story in portraying Dr. Mortimer (played by Neil Duncan) as a young, somewhat distracted man, not the aging dabbler in the occult of the Rathbone version.

All in all, this movie somewhat disappoints as a thriller, but has enough visual appeal and good acting to sustain my interest.  But it is really a hard call to determine who will like it and who won't.  Hard-core horror buffs will probably find it too tame, hard-core Holmes fans will perhaps find it less than it could have been, but people somewhere in the middle might just like it.",1143590400,4,2429,4.909535452322738

(Note that this review is based on the DVD version of this movie released in Jan. 2003.)

This movie is based on the novel ""The Hound of the Baskervilles"" (1902) written by Sir Arthur Conan Doyle (1859 to 1930).

The setting of this movie is a vast expanse of dangerous wasteland: the moors of Dartmouth in Devonshire, England.

This movie begins by showing us a frightened but distinguished-looking man who appears to be running from something.  Later, this man ends up dead.  The deceased turns out to be Sir Charles Baskerville of the estate called ""Baskerville Hall.""  Was his death of natural causes or was it murder?

Because of his death, the estate now falls to presumably ""the last of the Baskervilles:"" Sir Henry Baskerville (Kristoffer Tabori).  He soon receives an anonymous note that reads:

""If you value your life or your reason, keep away from the moor.""

At this point, Sherlock (Jeremy Brett) is called in to investigate.  He learns of the Baskervilles and ""the curse of the hound"" that has been bestowed on the family for the last two centuries.  Holmes dismisses the idea of a killer hound as a myth but decides to investigate further so as to get to the real truth.

Dr. Watson (Edward Hardwicke) aids Sherlock in the investigation.  In fact, he has a much expanded role in this movie.

Brett catches the essence of the famous gumshoe in his performance.  All supporting actors do a good job in their roles.

The attention-to-detail, costumes, background music, and cinematography are quite well done.  I also thought the effect of the appearance of the hound was interesting.

The only problems I had with this movie is that it seems to lack energy and lack suspense (until the last half hour or so).  As well, I missed Sherlock's deer hunter hat (his trademark) in this movie.  (He only wears a fedora.)

Finally, the audio and picture quality of this DVD, I feel, are acceptable.  There are no real interesting extras.

In conclusion, this is a good movie to watch even if you have read the novel on which it is based!!

337403,3,6301480473,"Plus points: Excellent English gothic atmosphere with Baskerville hall, the Grimpen moor et al. Hardwicke puts up a sober and warm performance as Watson, making very good use of his long screen time here. The other characters like Henry Baskerville, Mortimer, the Stapletons and the Barrymore couple are played quite well by a solid cast.

Minus Points: The main caveat unfortunately is Jeremy Brett. Suffering physial illnesses and manic depression, he looks like a wreck in this latter day production. Baggy watery eyes, hanging cheeks and a thoroughly dishevelled appearance make him a sad sight and he even seems to have breathing problems given how prominent his breath is on the soundtrack. He performs gamely enough, though.

A minor issue would be that the film chickens out on the Holmes-out-of-the-scene bit by showing spoiler glimpses of him in the country before he makes his major appearance at Devonshire in the original tale. Sure, we've read the story millions of times before, but we still want it to be told exactly the way Sir Doyle told it.

And yeah, the hound sucks...it looks a bit too amiable and the animal sounds are obviously faked.

On the whole a good comfy viewing experience.",1098144000,6,1206,4.985074626865671
337404,4,6301480473,"This is probably my favorite of the Jeremy Brett Sherlock Holmes
adaptations.  Some have said Brett looks bloated and sick (and he probably was at this point in his life).  That may be, yet I find (and this may be cold and callous on my part) that illness added a unique quality to his voice which in turn added to the mystery.  The rest of the cast is excellent in their roles.  I wouldn't call this a faithful adaptation of the original text: I don't believe there was an implied romance between Ms. Stapleton and Lord Baskerville. I also have to admit that the scenes which feature empty rooms and the sounds of sobbing are less atmospheric than they are annoying.

Having watched the film on VHS, I was anxious to get the DVD so I could bring up the subtitles and find out WHAT WAS BEING SAID in a few of the scenes.  (That's right, I love this version inspite of the fact that I can only understand three quarters of the dialogue.)  Imagine my surprise (and disappointment) when I got the subtitle option working--only to discover that whoever did the subtitles couldn't understand the lines either and, in some cases, messed up the ones that WERE easily understood.  (For example: ""He started the task methodically"" becomes ""he studied the task methodically"", ""Huddleston Quayle"" becomes ""HudsonWhales"", ""tin mine"" is translated as ""ten mile"" and ""awkwardly"" is translated as ""all quickly"".)  I fear for the hearing-impaired person who watches this; they will be even more up a creek without a paddle than the hearing person.

Over all, I give it four out of five stars for the cast, the writing and the scenery.  But the muddied sound keeps it from being a five.",1094601600,5,1669,4.662116040955631
337405,5,6301480473,"In these five feature-length films, we see Holmes at his best (though the quality of the films themselves varies).  With The Sign of Four, the Granada team decided to avoid the question that plauge Sherlockians 'how many wives did John Watson have?' by avoiding the subject all together.  This was a risky move, but it proved to streamline this series dramatically, and ended on a most worthy note.  The portrayal of Jonathan Small by Jonathan Thaw (TV's Inspector Morse) ranks as one of the best guest appearances on this series.  Outside the Mary Morstan subplot with Watson, this is very faithful to the original narrative.  Better than Ian Richardson, by far better than Charlton Heston's Crucible of Blood, and stronger than anything Rathbone and Bruce had to offer.  Can you imagine Bruce's bumbling, mumbling Watson trying to carry a picture?  Oh, that's right they tried that with their over-blown Hound.
  The Hound of the Baskervilles found in this DVD set can be a bit dry, and a bit slow at times.  It is obvious that Brett is in ill-health.  However, his performance is solid, and the moments he interacts with Hardwicke's Watson, we see a relationship between Holmes and Watson that no other team has captured.  While Holmes delights in foiling Watson, such as in the opening scene over Dr. Mortimer's stick, it is Watson who steals the show.  Hardwicke plays Watson as a world-weary, older brother of Holmes who understands him, and who is much needed by the world famous sleuth.  Incidentally, for those who feel this particular version is too slow, I challenge you to see what happens when one tries to make a 'hipper, darker' version of the story, such as the 2002 production with Richard (Moulin Rouge) Roxburgh.  The result is a gore-fest with little of the original story left in tact.
The Master Blackmailer is my favourite of the set.  Holmes has fallen in love.  The inexplicable has happened.  In the original Canon story, he did get engaged to Milverton's maid.  However, she turned out to be the Lady Swinstead, who turned the gun on Milverton at the end.  This version takes liberties with that idea, and presents us with perhaps the saddest look at Holmes;  a man who does not know how to kiss, love, or be loved.  I remember hearing how folks who have trouble cultivating romances watched this episode, and responded that the episode was theraputic.  Brett himself in this episode appears as if his health was getting better.  He has more energy, and appears younger than in Hound.
  The Eligible Bachelor is loosely based on The Noble Bachelor, and here is where the series gets into some trouble.  While the performances of Brett and Hardwick are amazing, the story itself gets just a little too weird, especially with Holmes Prophetic dreams and the harrowing hag-like woman who has been kept in captivity.  Because of Brett's deterioration in health, it makes sense that Holmes is having a 'breakdown.'  His monologue about a world without Moriarty is particularly engaging.  These moments make the film.  The case itself is a let-down.
  And finally, the last disc, I'm sad to say is the worst of the Brett series.  I also felt it was the worst of the Canon stories.  In the Canon story, when the boy is found to have tried to commit murder, Holmes recommends that he takes a few years to travel abroad.  What?  So, in this version, we do have a Dracula-esque human being who takes the young lad under his wing.  Brett looks very run down, and older than his age in this film.  And although, for the most part, the Memoirs series (which followed these films) is very good, Brett continues to look worse and worse.  Does it make these later episodes unwatchable?  Of course not!  BRETT IS HOLMES.  But we can't help but watch, with a lump in our throats, the slow deterioration of the definitive Holmes, who was in life, one of the most remarkable actors ever to grace the world.",1069718400,83,3913,4.7518573551263
337406,3,6301480473,"In all honesty, I think this is easily the saddest installment of the Brett Holmes films, with the possible exception of ""The Master Blackmailer.""
Obviously in poor health, Brett apparently had no energy or enthusiasm to devote to this, arguably the most famous Holmes story in the canon. Fortunately, Holmes is not present throughout the bulk of the story, giving Brett some measure of rest before he makes his presence known at Baskerville Hall.
While not quite an embarrassment, the balance of the film seems strangely lifeless. I think a good deal of this is from a poor use of soundtracking, with minimal music throughout, in combination with the obviously struggling Brett. Working through the initial scenes with none of the energy alvailable to him in the 1984-5 series, Brett tries and can therefore be forgiven, but it sets the tone for the lethargic production and magnifies the poorer elements.
There are also many truncated, condensed, or missing scenes (such as the famous assassination attempt, or the cab driver identifying the fare who had the black beard).
We are very lucky to have Edward Hardwicke following the example of David Burke, dispelling the comical versions of the Watson character we've all seen in the past. With the possible exception of Neil Duncan, who seems a bit young for the role of Dr. Mortimer, the supporting cast is top-notch.
Devotees of the series will certainly be a bit disappointed, as we are all used to the frenetic energy Brett displayed as Holmes in the earlier efforts. But for those not yet accquainted with the earlier work, this feature may serve as a good introduction to the Brett/Hardwicke interpretation of Homes/Watson.",1060732800,7,1680,5.025089605734767
337407,3,6301480473,"It's a shame that Jeremy Brett's poor health worked against making this television adaptation of perhaps the most famous Sherlock Holmes story such a disappointingly average production. Brett is obviously lethargic here as Holmes and it's hard to imagine that this is the same Sherlock Holmes we saw in the first series and the majority of the second. Compare his appearance and performance here with his Sherlock Holmes in 'The Sign Of Four', for example. Gone is the quick wit and hawk-like persona that made Brett so notable as Holmes. Here, Brett is bloated and distant. It may have been best in hindsight if the production was postponed until Brett was in better health, but that didn't happen and as a result the film suffers.
The supporting cast are all fine, and Edward Hardwicke is excellent as Watson which is important as the character features heavily in the story. Check out Donald Churchill's terrible performance as Watson in the Ian Richardson version to see how a poor performance as Holmes' companion can sink a film adapation of this story.
Unfortunately the direction and pace is as lethargic as the star. In comparison to other Granada tv movies like The Sign Of Four and The Master Blackmailer, it's hard to believe that this one was made by the same production team. I believe a lot of the blame can be attributed to reported budgetary constraints but lack of money is no excuse for pacing problems. It's a very faithful adaptation of the novel, but some scenes go on longer than necessary giving the production a very theatrical feel which works against the film.
There are some great scenes though...the mysterious figure collecting Watson's letters from the post office, Watson and Dr Mortimer laying in wait for someone who has set up camp in the hills near the Baskerville house, etc.
It's certainly a watchable and sometimes entertaining production, but the production team really dropped the ball with this one especially when you are aware of the excellent productions that have come before. Unfortunately this effort was a sign of things to come as the series steadily declined with only The Casebook Of Sherlock Holmes series and The Master Blackmailer as saving graces. The sad decline in Jeremy Brett's health and the increasingly poor scripting makes the final two tv movies (The Last Vampyre and The Eligible Bachelor) and the final series (The Memoirs Of Sherlock Holmes) almost unwatchable. Stories in the last series like The Mazarin Stone are not only an embarrassment to the Holmes tv canon but are also extremely poor television.",1057708800,24,2572,4.956018518518518

337432,3,6301480473,"This collection of the feature length Granada Television Sherlock Holmes stories featuring Jeremy Brett as the famous detective has a few good items in it. The best is ""The Master Blackmailer"" which is a build upon the original ""Charles Augustus Milverton"" story and is excellently done and colorful. The standout role of ""Milverton"" is performed by our friend from ""All Creatures Great and Small""  Robert Hardy, and he does a GREAT JOB! You may also notice one of the actors from ""Brideshead Revisited"" in this episode, look carefully! It is Nicolas Grace who gave us ""Anthony Blanche"" in ""Brideshead"".The second best is perhaps ""The Sign of Four"" with John Thaw as the central character to the story, Johnathan Small. Little did we know at the time that he would shortly go on to immortality as Inspector Morse. ""The Hound of the Baskervilles"" lacks excitement and seems drawn out and dull, and our ""replacement"" Watson, although good does not quite measure up to the standard that David Burke set for the role in the early 80's original and still best episodes covering most of the ""Adventures"". The Hammer 1959 version with Peter Cushing and Christopher Lee still reigns in color drama and the '39 Basil Rathbone and Nigel Bruce production in B&W. ""The Sussex Vampyre"" is a matter of taste and ""The Eligible Bachelor"" is one of the last of the series that were made and is terrible due to Mr. Brett's ill health (which can be clearly seen)and ridiculous revelations by dreams leading to the solving of the crime bordering on Freudian philosophy.

Okay, having said that, I think it was a mistake on the part of MPI to release these five 2 hour ""feature films"" before they completed the rest of the series, because these are, by far, the weakest productions of the series. There's something about stretching these classic stories into 2 hours that just doesn't work, and Brett's illness takes a toll on his performance here. I fear people may be turned off to the Brett/Granada Holmes before the release of the outstanding second season, The Return of Sherlock Holmes, on DVD in June/July, 2003. If you've never seen a Brett/Granada Holmes, RUSH to buy the first season, The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes, which has been out on DVD for some time now, and pre-order the second season.

He was battling severe depression and a nervous breakdown due to the death of his wife and dying of cardiomyopathy. Medication prescribed to control his bipolar disorder gave him the bloated appearance seen in later episodes. As the medication built up in his system, it wreaked his already weakened heart (he'd had rheumatic fever as a child)...
What raises this above maudlin tribute is how much closer the latter-day Brett comes to the Holmes penned by Doyle. There is a problem with the Doyle Holmes even the best actors don't overcome. (Brett himself thought Doyle was better read than watched.) The agony Brett suffered in his last months seems to have enabled him to transcend that barrier. Maybe because Holmes is so dark a character. Tom Keogh says in Amazon.com's Editorial Review, ""the ailing Brett gives an ever-fascinating performance... something darker and more personal"" and ""the ailing Brett, play[s] an increasingly darker and more neurotic detective.""
A writer once suggested Holmes' own words from Watson's memoir (in The Final Problem) could serve as his epitaph: ""I think I may go so far as to say that I have not lived wholly in vain; if my record were closed tonight, I could still survey it with equanimity. The air of London is sweeter for my presence."" Diana Rigg observed they might also apply to Jeremy Brett.
The earlier episodes are more comely. Nevertheless, the rest of the story and the essence of Holmes are in The Eligible Bachelor, The Master Blackmailer, The Last Vampire, and The Hound of the Baskervilles.",1047600000,27,1631,4.956204379562044

This time, it is Granada Television's turn and, for the most part, they do a solid job in bringing this classic to life.  Fairly faithful to the book, this film benefits from the top notch performances of Jeremy Brett as the Great Detective and Edward Hardwicke as the faithful Dr. Watson.  Despite the fact that Brett's Holmes is off-screen during a large chunk of the film's time, his characterization never ceases to grasp our attention.  Edward Hardwicke takes over from David Burke as the trusty Watson and he makes his own indelible mark on the role.  Hardwicke's take on the role is a little less brittle than Burke's, making Watson a much more warm and engaging personality. The film is also chock-full of the spooky moorish atmosphere that makes this tale a classic. Also, the supporting cast is top notch with Neil Duncan earning praise as an unconventionally eccentric Dr. Mortimer.  If the movie suffers in one instance, it is in the overall pacing and length.  At an even 2 hours, parts of the film seem to drag, especially when compared with the Peter Cushing or other versions.  But, that's minor quibbling.  With either Watson, the Jeremy Brett series still provides the current standard by which most Sherlock Holmes films are judged, and this film more than holds its own.

7812904,4,6301480473,"The Sherlock Holmes Feature Film Collection, 1984 film / The Hound of the Baskervilles, 1988 film

This set contains five movies from the series that featured Jeremy Brett as Sherlock Holmes and Edward Hardwicke as Dr. John H. Watson. You can compare them to the The Hound of the Baskervilles with Basil Rathbone and Nigel Bruce, and The Sign of Four with Matt Frewer.  This version of The Hound is the most accurate as it did not edit out the typewriter. The Sign seems about equal. Three of these films have changed the name from the original; there were changes in the story. I think the original stories were better.

Disc One: The Hound of the Baskervilles, 1998. This is the most accurate adaption of the story and as good as any earlier version.
Disc Two: The Last Vampire, 1992. This was extensively modified from The Adventure of the Sussex Vampire and is not as good.
Disc Three: The Sign of Four, 1987. It is as good as any previous adaptation of the story.
Disc Four: The Eligible Bachelor, 1992. This adaptation distorts The Adventure of the Noble Bachelor and makes it confusing.
Disc Five: The Master Blackmailer, 1991. This is an enlarged version of Charles Augustus Milverton that reflects the concerns of its authors.

I would have preferred to see all four of the long stories in one collection. Missing are A Study in Scarlet and The Valley of Fear. Both were made into movies in the 1930's.

The Hound of the Baskervilles, 1988 film

It begins in the night. An old man smokes a cigar as he stands and waits in the dark at 10:15 pm. He hears a sound, and runs! Then there is a busy street scene in a big city. Holmes asks Watson about a cane left behind, then offers his opinion. Dr. Mortimer tells of his concerns, and the death of Sir Charles Baskerville; there were footprints of a gigantic hound! Sir Henry Baskerville arrived from Canada to inherit the estate. Holmes and Watson visit Sir Henry and learn of a warning letter. Holmes analyzes it. Are they being watched? Yes. Dr. Watson is sent to Baskerville Hall until Holmes can join him. A convict escaped from Dartmoor, he is an insane killer. The Baskerville family goes back five centuries. The servants announce their intention of leaving. Dr. Watson brought his service revolver.

Stapleton meets Dr. Watson and introduces his sister, who warns him to go back to London (she mistook him for Sir Henry). [Is there a clue here?] Stapleton collects rare butterflies, those that inhabit the heath marshes. Mr. Franklin boasts of his legal suits. People there believe in the hound; one man saw a beast the size of a calf! That night Sir Henry and Dr. Watson see Barrymore moving a light as a signal. They go outside and see a lone man in the dark. Then they hear a dogs howl! Mrs. Barrymore explains their actions and begs forgiveness. They will say nothing. Dr. Watson wishes Holmes was there. Sir Henry tells Watson of his intention of dining with the Stapletons. Dr. Watson walks on the moor and sees Sir Henry meet Miss Stapleton, then Stapleton arrives for an argument. Why did he object to their meeting? Does he believe in the Legend of the Hound? [Or what?]

Later Stapleton apologized to Sir Henry and invited him to supper at night. Barrymore tells Sir Henry why Sir Charles was at the gate that night - a letter from a lady. Mr. Franklin tells Dr. Watson about his daughter Laura. His telescope revealed the presence of a stranger on the moor. Dr. Mortimer excavated a neolithic burial ground and guided Dr. Watson there. They find a note there. Then that stranger appears! Holmes explains his actions - to hide his presence. The Hound exists! Holmes tells Watson what he discovered about Laura Lyons, and Stapleton! Outside they hear the howl of a dog attacking a man. It is Selden the escaped prisoner wearing Sir Henrys old clothes! No one must know of this for now.

An old portrait reveals a truth. Holmes announces his return to London. Trust me. Holmes talks to Laura Lyons about that letter sent to Sir Charles. Dr. Mortimer is invited to join them. That night Sir Henry arrives at the Stapletons. There is fog in the night. Sir Henry leaves, the hound attacks! Dr. Watsons revolver wounds the hound. They return and search Stapletons home to find a bound and gagged Beryl! Stapleton fled to his island in the mire. But a misstep in the dark can be fatal! Back in London Holmes explains the scheme of Stapleton, who wanted the money and not the estate.

This movie features Jeremy Brett as Sherlock Holmes and Edward Hardwicke as Dr. John H. Watson from their series of television programs. This adaptation is truer than the others (the mention of the typewriter, for example). It is an example of greed causing murder via the inheritance laws of the aristocracy (primogeniture).
