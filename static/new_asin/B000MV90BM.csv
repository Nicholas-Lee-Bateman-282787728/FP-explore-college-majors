2750219,3,B000MV90BM,"I have loved this movie for as long as I can remember, having seen it on tv as a young kid in the 80's. I have a VHS copy but it is wearing out because I have watched it so many times. So I began looking for a DVD copy but could not afford to pay $80 or more for it. This copy was the alternative and after reading the reviews I was fairly confident in purchasing this dvd. I got it in the mail today and could not wait, I put it in there and then to watch it. I was pleased to find it worked in my player, and that the subtitles could be turned off. The reason for my 3 stars is that the sound quality is not great. Oh, you can hear the dialogue just fine, but there is a fuzzy sound in the background. I am disappointed with that but the film is still watchable and will suffice until someone decides to make a digitally remastered version, which I am sure there will be one day.",1328054400,15,881,3.8729281767955803
2750220,2,B000MV90BM,"I received my copy of the Scarlet Pimpernel. I have always loved the movie and was excited to get it at such a good price. I read the reviews and they said not to worry about the Chinese writing on the back. However, when I ordered it, I failed to notice it was subtitled and you can not turn off the subtitling! Normally I could deal with that, but the subtitle DOES NOT GO WITH THE MOVIE! Who translated it? It is ridiculous! I really feel that should be stated on the selling page! But, if you want to laugh hysterically at all the serious parts, get this copy! Which is why I gave it 2 stars instead of 1! I just wish you could turn off the subtitling!",1327795200,18,656,4.093023255813954
2750221,5,B000MV90BM,"I just wanted to submit a review, because initially I was worried that this DVD would not work in the US.  The other version is over $80, so I was skeptical that this would work.  Also, the cover and back are covered with Chinese, I was worried that the text wouldn't be in English.

However, my worries were for naught:

* The DVD works just fine on the multiple DVD players I have tried.
* The movie is high quality, and the audio is all in English (you have the option of Chinese subtitles)
* The show itself is a classic, I would highly recommend it.

In sum, if you want a DVD of this movie, and if you don't care if some of the cover is in Chinese, it is DEFINITELY worth the $70 you save compared to the US edition release.  Enjoy!",1321056000,35,738,4.090277777777778
2750222,5,B000MV90BM,"Top notch version of the French Revolution swashbuckler, for some reason now out print.  This copy fulfilled all my expectations despite its slightly suspicious cover art.  If you haven't seen it yet, you've missed a rollicking good yarn. Definitely a reason to stay at home with a bowl of popcorn!",1319673600,,298,4.94
2750223,5,B000MV90BM,"The movie The Scarlet Pimpernel starring Anthony Andrews, Jane Seymour, and Ian McKellen is an awesome story.  Ever since I saw it the first time I have loved it, and now I have finally tracked down my own copy (I have a book also that I haven't read yet).  A grand mix of history and drama that even the kids love!!  Action, suspense, romance -- it's got it all!!",1316563200,3,364,4.246376811594203
2750234,5,B000MV90BM,"This is the finest production of Scarlet Pimpernel that I've seen. Anthony Andrews and Jane Seymour are well matched, in fact I think Andrews drew Seymour out to one of her best performances. Far eclipses the Leslie Howard version, or any other I've seen.",1434672000,,255,4.818181818181818

2750237,5,B000MV90BM,"The movie doesn't follow the book but is still very good!!

Our family has watched the movie several times (and expect to watch it a few more times) and like it more each time.  It is good family movie that addresses some of the darker side of human nature, deception and greed, but also illustrates the more noble side as well,such as personal  honor, integrity, keeping your word,  true love, etc..

A very good movie worth watching!!",1400112000,,436,4.6103896103896105
2750238,5,B000MV90BM,"I love the Scarlet Pimpernel ever since I first read the book & saw this movie version. I have been eying this for a while to buy it. Glad I did! Haven't watched it yet, but I've seen this version many times before. It is a great old-fashioned love story & action film, about an English noble who rescues the French aristocrats from the guillotine. Jane Seymour is stunning & beautiful, and it's a lot of fun to watch. Wholesome as well -- great movie without the constant, overkill sex & adultery they throw into newer period movies like The Duchess or Anna Karenina (didn't like either of those). If you like this movie, you'll also like Pride & Prejudice, the Count of Monte Cristo, etc.",1391212800,4,690,4.484126984126984
2750239,2,B000MV90BM,"A very poor quality copy.  Grainy, with poor sound quality.  It almost seemed a ""pirated"" version.  I would not recommend this version to anyone.",1387065600,2,145,4.958333333333333
2750240,5,B000MV90BM,"Great adventure, drama, and action in this romance set in the French Revolution. The Scarlet Pimpernel has never been better presented that in this version. Anthony Andrews, Jane Seymour and Ian McKellen, all brilliant actors and star-quality in their roles.
While attenpting to find and eradicate the hero Pimpernel, who saves members of the aristocracy from ""Madame Guillatine,"" the evil
McKellen almnost destroys the marriage of the young couple. The disc is perfect, beautiful to watch. The sound is clear, and the subtitles are great not only for deaf people like me but also for those who need to understand the various accents throught the fil. Excellent service from the seller.

2750241,5,B000MV90BM,"I really enjoyed this movie. I get some funny looks because the language on the box, but inside it's all fantastic. You can absolutely turn off the subtitles. When you do, sit back and enjoy this fantastic piece of film.",1382054400,,220,4.525

2750257,1,B000MV90BM,"I received this DVD and found it was made probably in China. It is grainy in appearance when played and clearly looks like it was filmed from a movie screen. It is a very bad reproduction. I hope to be able to return it.
Additional: after contacting the source--ImportCDs.com--they claim they are unable to accept returns of opened cd's. How else are you able to determine a defect if you don't open it? Beware before buying from them.",1357776000,11,435,4.589743589743589
2750258,5,B000MV90BM,I have always loved this film but couldn't justify the high cost. The DVD presented the film exactly like I remembered it. Love the principal actors. Was concerned about the oriental writing on the jacket but the subtitles were in English even tho they didn't always go along with what was being said. Always a great film and not I could afford it. Thanks for the excellant service!!,1357257600,,383,4.647058823529412
2750259,5,B000MV90BM,"I first watched this when I was 12 years old and have meant to get my hands on it ever since. It is a fun, action-packed film with excellent performances by the two lead actors- Anthony Andrews, who is a joy to watch and Jane Seymour who shines even more than ever.  The cast also includes a very young Ian McKellen who never disappoints. If you haven't seen this yet, you are missing out.",1356825600,,389,4.256756756756757

2750261,5,B000MV90BM,"Got this movie in two days. It was an amazing movie. A very high quality movie with action and suspense, without the ""R"" rating of most of the movies today. We need more of this kind of movie! Recommended for age 15+ because it does have content (guillotine) that might be scary to youngsters. Great acting!",1352678400,,307,4.5
2750262,4,B000MV90BM,"I was pleasantly surprised surprised how entertaining this movie turned out to be. However, I did not show this to my class of 9th graders as I had originally intended. The plot requires an understanding of the historical context of the time and the language is metaphorical and somewhat sophisticated. It might work with some classes. It is an entertaining movie that has some historical foundation and a lot of ""Holly wood.""",1351987200,,426,4.930555555555555
2750263,3,B000MV90BM,"I purchased this version of the ""Scarlet Pimpernel"" because I remembered and enjoyed it on TV, 20 or so years ago.  But I could not afford the $80-120 prices that I've seen on the internet.  After reading a previous review on this Chinese version, here on Amazon, I purchased it for under $10. I understood when I bought it that I could not view it without subtitles.......which was ok......mostly.  I have friends that always display subtitles when they watch movies.  I would say that at best 80-90% of the subtitles were what you would expect.  However, I did find it annoying when the English words shown in the subtitles did not match what the actors were saying.

That said, I'm glad that I bought this $10 version.

My real purpose in buying this movie is that I bought the original ""Scarlet Pimpernel"", with Merle Oberon and Leslie Howard, and wanted to compare the two.  They were both excellent movies.  The real difference in these two versions is the writing was more extensive in the remake.  I thought both versions were excellent! Gotta' say that I was stunned by Raymond Massey's performance in the original. It was much stronger than I expected.  Leslie Howard's performance was excellent.....Merle Oberon's performance.....what a beautiful woman and incredible performance, both from the original.  BUT, ......I preferred the latter version with Jane Seymour and Anthony Andrews.  The difference was the writing and the source material for that writing.  It was an excellent update and remake of the original.",1329523200,7,1527,5.007936507936508

8172758,5,B000MV90BM,"Okay, this is seriously one of my favorite movies. It's hard to imagine finding any humor at all with the French Revolution, but you find it in this movie! In addition, you get suspense, action, romance, and even some character growth and development. A fun movie that will have you laughing, swooning, angry, and even tearing up a little (hopefully while nobody else is looking). Definitely a must-see!",1479081600,,403,4.9411764705882355

The dialogue is contrived, flat and cliched. This is one of the few movies I haven't been able to finish. A high school production company could have done better.

However, kudos to the set designer, production designer, costume designer, and location manager. The movie looks fantastic!",1472947200,,459,5.375
