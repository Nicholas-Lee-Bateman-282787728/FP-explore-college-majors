1718737,4,B000067IYR,"Yes... I have been waiting on tetherhooks for this series ever since I got a glimpse of it at a convention I went to.
Be warned, this anime is NOT for the fainthearted (nor the kids)... its Spawn style dark and the drawing style reminds me a lot of the Sandman comics I used to read.
The story revolves around the Hellsing orginisation and their quest to rid the world of the sudden surge of 'man made' vampires that have been running rampant.  The head of the orginisation is Sir Intergral Wingates Hellsing (a woman).  To hunt these vampires, she uses one of her own.  A vampire operative by the name of Arucard
Of all the characters in this anime, Arucard, the rogue vampire deserves special mention... he is the type of character that you can never quite figure out.. his voice is done superbly in japanese by Johji Nataka (Folken in Escaflowne), deep and menacing.  Crispin Freeman does the english dub and sounds..alright... but no where near as deep.
The only thing wrong about this is the fact that it contains only 3 episodes.  Other than that, if you like horror with style... give this disc a try",1021161600,8,1107,4.542713567839196
1718758,4,B000067IYR,"Ok, this anime series has blood sex and gore. It's a good series, has good music(Jazz), and really cool effect. The dubbing is also amazing. The only thing i disapprove of is the storyline didn't really flow. It seemed as if each episode was a diffrent story. But the storyline is something like this.

A Vampire working for a vampire hunting company bites a police girl and turns her into a vampire. you get to see the changes of her becoming a vampire. Such as her refusing to drink blood and her not being able to touch silver. Also the head vampire and his quest to find a real fight.

It's a good series to own.",1203465600,,616,4.301724137931035
1718759,5,B000067IYR,"The Hellsing series is very seductive, yet it contains no explicit ""mature"" scenes.  Still, its not prime-time family fare. I can't explain the allure Hellsing has.  I've tried to placate my Hellsing addiction by watching other Vampire oriented anime offerings, but they don't come close.

Technically, Hellsing is often times more of a slide show that sporadically drips and oozes than animation as we know it.  The storyline often wanders from the far-fetched to the ridiculous, yet it is still the most compelling production I have watched in ages.

The title and name ""Hellsing"" is loosely based on the Bram Stoker incarnation ""Van Helsing"", vampire hunter and arch enemy of Stoker's most famous ficticious character ""Dracula"" (which is fairly safe to say that all 20th and 21st century Dracula variations are spun off from).

The difference between the Hellsing Organization and Stoker's Van Helsing is that the Hellsing Organization uses and houses vampires, including one very special vampire in particular, to hunt and terminate other vampires...instead of merely hunting and killing vampires.

What is alluring is the relationship(s) developed between servant(s) and master(s), laden with both evil and good, given with devotion without surrender.

The English version voice acting is superb.  Chicago's Crispin Freeman as the vampire Alucard and London's Victoria Harwood as his master Integra Hellsing are proof that exact opposites do attract.  The interaction between the two have left fans guessing as to the true nature of their relationship even four years after the series has ended.  Seras Victoria voiced by K.T. Gray emmanates nothing but innocence and deep love and devotion for her master, Alucard.  The elusive but ever-present emotional triangle between the three main characters, although subdued, quickly establishes itself in the first few episodes and remains as an ever-present theme throughout the remaining animated story.

We are also introduced to Walter, Integra's butler, who makes a great cup of tea and outrageous weapons for vampires to kill other vampires with.  I'm not quite sure what exactly Walter is or isn't, but he is more than adequately voiced by Ralph Lister.  Mr. Lister did such a great job, I found myself wishing I had a man like Walter on my side.  Walter was not only a more than an accomplished defender of the Hellsing Organization as well as a weapons innovator, he brought order, sense, and diplomacy to a rather chaotic story.

While the graphics have been technically surpassed, and the artwork is rather rudimentary, it is inspired and glows of raw talent.  I couldn't keep my eyes off of it even though there wasn't that much to see.

As far as the plot and story goes, while far-fetched and often times ridiculous, it was sophisticated. It never insulted the intelligence of the viewer.  For me, the characters themselves were so interesting, I wanted to know what was going on between them and found the plot incidental.

While very simple, the rockn'roll soundtrack still works.  It is not overbearing nor dated.

I understand Amazon will have a boxed set of the series as of August 1, 2006.  I read on IMDB that the author Hirano was planning an expanded in-depth release of the series in 2006.  I don't know per-se if the above release is indeed the rumored expanded set or a release of the 2002 series that we Americans are familiar with.  Either way, I do recommend the set over these individual disks, you will not only save money but you will be able to enjoy this rather short series seamlessly.

1718760,5,B000067IYR,"The Japanese seem to find the western version of the Vampire myth quite appealing, and the expression of that fascination reaching a peak with the anime series Hellsing.

Set in modern-day Great Britain, the series focuses on the efforts of the Hellsing Organization, a powerful private enterprise helping to defend ""God, Queen, and Country"" from the ravages of vampires. Run by the descendents of the van Helsing family of Dracula fame, the organization employs the enigmatic vampire Alucard in their hunt against creatures of the night.

Alucard by far makes the series as one of the most hard-boiled ...anime heroes to date with just enough hint of a savage, barely-kept dark side to make him interesting. He dispatches the armies of the night with a huge .454 Casull gun filled with explosive, blessed silver bullets in style and with panache.

In this first volume in the series, the first two episodes really serve as introductory material for the characters and setting. Seras Victoria, a police woman caught in the middle of an operation gone bad and the only ""survivor"" of her unit, becomes a vampire at Alucard's hand and joins the Hellsing Organization, and the organization must hunt down disturbing human-created ""freak"" vampires increasingly a problem in England.

The third episode is where the series really begins to come into its own, introducing the rival Iscariot Organization of the Vatican and its rabid human regenerator.

The animation itself is done really well in terms of visual quality, with a blend of CG and hand-drawn cel work; however, it is somewhat more static in nature than much contemporary anime, comparable to that done for the Record of Lodoss War series.

The audio, though presented only in stereo sound, features a soundtrack you'll want to hunt down like a freak after fresh blood. Surprisingly, the english dubbing is quite good, featuring British-accented voice actors far superior to the average anime dub.

Hellsing is an excellent addition to any anime fan's library and a must-watch for vampire lovers everywhere.",1142380800,4,2063,5.122023809523809
1718761,4,B000067IYR,"This is an anime I can recommend with little hesitation to any person who likes action, with a bit of drama as well.  The title refers to a British vampire hunting organization.  They have two vampires who work for them: Alucard, a hard-core killing machine, and Seras Victoria, who is new to being a vampire and is uncomfortable with what she has become.  In episode three, we meet the recurring villain, Alexander, whose fight with Alucard is not to be missed.

The animation is fairly fluid and well-done, especially in the fight scenes.  The English voice acting is superb - they obtained British VAs for all of the British characters - this is one case where the English dub makes more sense than the original Japanese.  The voice actor for Alexander immediately makes him an awesome character - think of an Irish priest crossed with a ninja, and you have the idea.

The series is definately rated R with gratuitous blood and gore.  Sex/nudity is very mild.

Important note - this DVD only has the first *three* episodes of Hellsing.  The series is only 12 episodes long.",1136764800,3,1076,4.705882352941177
1718762,5,B000067IYR,"I watched the series previously before I bought the umd but I recommend this to any anime fan who would like to watch a little anime on the run.  The episodes are fantastic.  The show is a rich mixture of horror, action and a little comedy.  I don't recommend this show for children because of language and content but for everyone else BUY IT!  Also check out the manga if you love the show.",1135123200,2,392,4.256756756756757
1718763,2,B000067IYR,"I would first of all like to say that I have read the manga for this anime, and found it very enjoyable. Upon liking it so much, I decided to try out the TV series. I rented this first disc, and was sadly disappointed. From the high quality of the manga that I experienced, I was hoping for the same quality from the DVD's. But I was sadly disappointed. The plotline was askewed and confusing, and this is coming from a person who already knew it. The animation itself is not nearly as detailed and interesting as that of the manga, and the characters, especially Alucard (not Arucard, or Arukard) are more annoying than cool, which is how they are in the manga. It is my recommendation that this anime be left to the books, and not made into television, for this representation is misleading in terms of quality. For those of you out there who like the idea, but not the presentation of this DVD, I strongly recommend the manga as an alternative.",1108684800,,947,4.448275862068965

1718765,5,B000067IYR,"I was never into vampire anime, but despite that fact this show really drew my attention. I heard of this show by word of mouth, and I was very sceptical. This show delivers a perfect blend of action, romance, violence, and suspense. This first disc is about the vampire hunter, arucard (Dracula spelled backwards, except for the second letter 'r' and not 'l' this is because the Japanese don't have an 'l' sound, they use a sound very similar to 'r' for words that have the 'l' sound.) and the ""police-girl"" Seras Victoria, going on missions hunting vampires. It may sound a little dull but there is something about the way the story is constructed that makes it much more entertaining than words can tell. Some very unique character development in Victoria, she struggles to overcome her vampiric urges to drink blood and sleep during the day; she also wants to be liberated from Arucard, but perhaps feels in-debted to him. Overall the show is amazing, but the company, Pioneer, really rips us off by only giving us an hour of show, an hour and fifteen minutes if you include the begining and ending theme songs. This is a 13 episode mini-series that spans four discs. As for content, recommended 16 and up by Pioneer standards; it contains a little blood, but some very graphic images with knives; contains a little oral sexual content, but not in too much detail; some moderate language on the sub-title mode; I would recommend this to peopel 17 and up.",1096243200,,1458,4.69921875
1718766,4,B000067IYR,"Well I bought this wondering what it was going to be like.  These days I'm not able to find a good story plot, nor epic sagas.  Of course I'm a fan of Robotech, Star Blazers, and some of the more sci-fi romance fans.  But anyway, I was fairly pleased with the results of this series.  First, I wasn't expecting it to have a police story.  The Hellsing family sponsering a police force determined to keep law and order with new criminals from the vampire world.  Very interesting in that each episode is an assignment.  It reminds me of the american animation Street Fighter series.  But what makes this interesting is how they have moved away from the now so common demonoid creatures, lengthy floating tenticles and blood so grusome it would be considered horror.

I also bought the Universal release of Van Helsing the animation.  I was actually enjoying trying to put the two together.  They both are loosely based on the Helsing which appears in every dracula movie.  So it does somewhat tie in.  The backdrop of the UK also makes this series very pleasing.  I'm really getting bored with the NEO Tokyo backdrops.  I would hope that some day Anime will elect to start making stories about other countries including the USA.  This was a good series with very adult action plots.  I'll continue to buy the continueing releases and eventually complete the series.  This is a good rare modern series that I can really enjoy.",1093651200,,1424,4.673387096774194
1718767,5,B000067IYR,"A friend told me to watch this anime so I did.
At first I thought this series looked stupid but boy was
I wrong.  This series is awesome.  The characters are great(Especially Father Anderson)The story is good too.
I don't wanna spoil the story but I will say the animation in
this series is very well done.
After watching volume 1 I went and got the Manga which is even better(Well I thought it was)and has better animation.
Over all this is an awesome series.  I didn't think the violence was that over the top.  But over all it's a great series.
Check it out....

1718778,4,B000067IYR,"Despite the fact that Alucard seems to be a darker, less doughnut-loving version of Vash the Stampede, this is a thrilling anime with a good plot, and lots of very satisfying blood for those who are in a twitchy mood. While some parts are not as well animated as others, they tend to keep it well rounded and stunning.
Do not be fooled into thinking this is some cutesy cartoon for kids, with adorable little kill-me-now pokemon and Sailor Moon. (Who, by the way, are solely responsible, along with their Digimon brethren, for the anti-anime mood in most districts.) This is DISTURBING. People BLEED. People drink what the other people are BLEEDING. VERY heavy anti-christian messages, as well as exposing the more fanatical side of our religion.
Very good anime, I reccomend it for the more strong stomached.",1076889600,,809,4.869565217391305
1718779,4,B000067IYR,"Welcome to the Hellsing Organization; an army dedicated to keep the country safe from the undead.  The group fights against vampires and ghouls of all sorts in the dark of night.  Their ultimate weapon is a hunter that is a vampire himself, Arucard; an unstoppable figure that can face just about any sort of evil that the darkness has to offer him.  Vampires and ghouls are not safe with this elite team of hunters and soldiers lurking about.
""Hellsing: Impure Souls"" begins this dark journey with three episodes.  Here we find out what the Hellsing Organization is all about, and we meet Arucard; a vampire who has dedicated himself to serve his master, Sir Integra (the head woman in charge of the group), and fight against the unholy monsters.  He's forced to transform a dying police woman, Seras Victoria, into a vampire in order to spare her life to kill a menacing blood-sucker holding her hostage.  While Seras is getting used to being a new member of the Hellsing Organization, she also is in battle with herself over what she has become.  In the meantime, Arucard is up against some competition; a regenerating foe that wields The Bible and an assortment of knives.  All of this is an exciting set-up for a blood-soaked introduction to the series.
""Hellsing"" is a quickly addicting anime series about vampires and ghouls--as well as the hunters and soldiers that fight against them.  The animation is stunningly impressive and stylish while at the same time the story and characters are exceptional.  The series reminds me a bit of the ""Spawn"" series without feeling nearly as disturbing or intense.  It's extremely easy to lose yourself in each of these three episodes--and as soon as they're over, you're eager to see the rest.
This is adult anime that is in no way intended for younger viewers.  The episodes contain graphic violence, blood and gore, strong language, mature situations, and dark and disturbing themes and imagery.  The only really downside to this DVD is that it only contains three episodes, which makes the running time for the DVD a little over an hour.  While this can be seen as a good or bad thing, it's still a weak-point for the DVD.  Other than that, the picture and sound quality is really great.  Extras on the disc include a creditless opening, an art gallery, action figure info, a trailer music video and more.
""Hellsing: Impure Souls"" is the exciting beginning to this action-packed and stylish anime adventure.  For those who are bigger fans of ghouls and vampires than the fantasy genera, this is definitely something to check out.  ""Hellsing"" has the makings of a great anime series, and that's from only seeing the first three episodes.  Take the ride into the darkness--if your soul dares.",1074556800,8,2740,4.8412017167381975
1718780,5,B000067IYR,As the first thing to say i find the first episode doesnt give the real idea but then Club M gives a better idea. As of vampire anime or mangas i have not liked many like Vampire Hunter D i found it really little kidish terrible story worst crap ever. But Hellsing  brings evil were most Vampire animes forget to do and actually cool characters apear. I like animes and mangas were people are totally crazy and are really insane its a great edge. Its for adults with  One Valent Brother uses the F word execesive and don't forget the love couple on the Moped. Its great how they brought so much evil into it. Its a very worth geting and paying for it,1068249600,,650,4.233870967741935
1718781,4,B000067IYR,"This is a great series to get into, if you previously enjoyed the reckless antics of Cowboy Bebop, the thrills and chills of the hunt in Witch Hunter Robin, and are an all round gore or Vampire fan!  I always recommend the boxed edition to start off your collection, because it is a cool design, potential goodies and it looks a lot more presentable when you get the rest of the volumes!  Boxes are for collectors who not only love the content on the dvd, but the presentation of the case and box!
The main character is a Vampire named Alucard, who is control by the Hellsing fondation.  And if you know anything about vampire flicks, the name Hellsing and Vampires go hand in hand.  Alucard is a wild, crazy, reckless at times, true blooded vampire.  He takes great offense to all the knock off or unprofessional vampires that he hunts down.  In his eyes, they are lower then scum and are not even good enough for the depths of hell!
While enjoying this flick, you will witness battles of religion, the walking dead, and good old fashion vampire fights!  Like in Witch Hunter Robin, where witches hunt witches, in Hellsing Vampires hunt Vampires and then some!!  Take note of the use of ""evil eyes"" used through out the series, as I feel it is one of the trade mark affects, just like the use of the crow in Witch Hunter Robin.
I highly recommend this series!!  It is highly enjoyable! The style and design, is something you can really sink your teeth into!!",1068163200,3,1459,4.496212121212121
1718782,5,B000067IYR,"This is a pretty cool anime. I went in with low expectations. The story isn't that original at first: Vampire Hunter who is a Vampire? Sound familiar? But after watching this first DVD, I was really impressed. So Impressed that I got the other 3 DVDs.
  The main character, Alucard (That's Dracula backwards) is very cool and stylish. He is a ruthless killer and his methods of execution are very distinct. He works for the Hellsing organization. A group dedicated to keeping England Vampire free except for Alucard of course. He takes a cop and makes her a Vampire, really for his own amusement. The two become partners so to speak and work together for the rest of the show.
  The animation is top notch. The action is good but brief. Very Alfred Hitchcock. The music is also quite good. I had a chance to meet the voice actor who does the voice work for Alucard, Crispin Freeman. He is a terrific voice actor.  If you like his work here, check out these titles X, Chobits, Read or Die and The Big O.
Hellsing is a great Anime. I would buy this one first. If you dig it, go out and get the other 3 right away.",1062028800,,1111,4.3478260869565215

It's not half the head trip of Lain or Akira it's just a good fun series.  The art work is nice.  Unlike many American audiences I don't mind the use of still frames and there are a few.  There's blood and sex and violence and one of the main characters smokes.  If you've read Dracula anytime recently or are up on Catholic Protestant debate in England it's good for a giggle.

The bottom line though is it's just not clever enough in storytelling or more importantly character development to be worth more than a casual rental at best. Visually it's not bad but I did see what some reviewers mentioned as a ""coldness"" to the digital animation that's prevalant. I'm thankful I have a great local video store (Scarecrow Video) that has maybe the best collection of Anime I've ever seen so I could rent this thing before having to just take a guess and buy it. At the same time I had rented Sin the movie, Berserk, Ruruoni Kenshin ""trust"" and Rurouni Kenshin ""betrayal"" (also known as Samurai X, Trust and Betrayal) and these titles were far more impressive in character and story. Oh Yeah and they all had actual blood in the usual red shade.

1718813,3,B000067IYR,"Hellsing Volume 1 titled Impure Souls starts you off with 3 episodes. I in particular love the first two episodes of the this wonderful Anime that's been released by Pioneer. Let's start off with some good points on this Vampire Hunter D like story line. Throw in an organization called Hellsing, toss in the main hero of the series who's name is Arucard who surprisingly if spelled backwards given the Japanese doesn't exactly have the letter ""l"" spells Dracula, is way too arrogant and powerful. Arucard is also voiced by none other than Crispin Freeman (Which I think is a plus to this anime) who lent his voice to another favorite character of mine from the Slayers Universe as Zelgadis. In the first two episodes already it is well established that Arucard can hold his own in all situations, after all he's only been sent to kill not only to one place with a countless ghouls and vampire alike but dozens of places on his own to take out the menance and call it a day so why do we need an organization if at all? Honest to say this Anime wouldn't have been so eye catching and as interesting if it weren't for the side kick to Arucard, her name is Seras Victoria, affectionately known as Police Girl. She makes up a lot of the content and story even though she is a secondary character in this story that feels much too alike of other Vampire animes. Without Seras Victoria I can honestly say Hellsing the anime has a lot of plot holes and a lot of things that aren't correct that are related to Vampires... see if you can spot them yourself... and enjoy Seras Victoria!! ^^ For those who wish to know more of JUST Seras Victoria...  and see for yourself how amazing her character is and vitality to the anime Hellsing. As for the bad points of Hellsing, there's honestly a lot of things that I found in the anime that just quite didn't add up... ghetto priest Catholic Anderson is a bit too extreme in his ways of getting his deed done. The whole thing with Arucard turning into a six eyed dog really annoyed the hell out of me... and Sir Intergra Wingate Hellsing who surprisingly is a female who inherits the Hellsing Organization doesn't seem all that feminine... check it out for what it is... and see for yourself if the anime lives up to it's name.",1034208000,4,2261,4.461352657004831
1718814,5,B000067IYR,"Gonzo has been well known for their excellent CG in Blue Sub #6 and Vandread, but Hellsing is probably one of their best titles yet. They don't go overboard with the CG and the story bones well for vampire fans. For many anime fans, this will be one of the coolest series ever.
Order 01: Alucard must track down a vampire disguised as a priest in Chedder, where he also meets Victoria Seras.
Order 02: Victoria becomes more aware of the Hellsing organization when on a mission to obliterate two teenage vampires.
Order 03: Victoria is assigned to take out a crazed vampire medical patient where she also meets Alucard's new enemy.
The story in this series is VERY violent. Enough to make you wince atleast once. Alucard will immedietly become a favorite with many anime fans since he is purely a psychotic killing vampire. Take Vampire Hunter D's clothing mixed with Trigun's Vash's attitude and you should have a pretty good idea of what Alucard is like. It's rare that a moment goes by where Alucard isn't smiling. Victoria acts as kind of the viewers reaction to all this fighting and provides some good comic relief and female influence to the show. Other characters include Sir Integra Hellsing (leader of the Hellsing organization), Sir Walter (faithful servent of Integra), Peter Ferguson (main captain of Hellsing) and Paladin (a Catholic who exterminates vampires).
The English dub has been made to fit the location of England. All the English cast members (with an exception of Alucard) have English accents. It doesn't bog down the story too much, but what bothered me about the English script was the blatant use of the F word. It's only used a couple of times in Episode 2, but it will become a habit of Pioneer in later episodes. But then again, I guess thats what would lure more people into the series.
The extras are pretty good for the first release. We get a creditless opening, music video (in Japanese), 50 concept art images and a gallery on the Alucard action figure (sans the hat).
Overall, Hellsing is a great series I recommend that everyone atleast give a try. If you like pure insane violence mixed with vampires and cursing and a good rocking soundtrack, you should have no problem warming up to this show.",1033862400,4,2235,4.733333333333333
1718815,4,B000067IYR,"i had heard through word of mouth about this series a few months ago. after hearing about it again and again, i decided i'd download the fansubs. i must say i'm very impressed. the animation was fluid, and the characters (although not entirely original) were beginning to develop nicely. i've always loved vampire anime. alucard (sharing the name of the star of the playstation castlevania classic, which is dracula backwards)is one hell of a cool hero. later into the series, the storyline began to melt away and strayed into an obscure cloud of basically unexplained battles and flashbacks. a new enemy appeared from no where. (from the continents? that's the lamest origin i've ever heard...) and just as things look as though they will be cleared up, and the storyline may straighten out and allow further character development, the series was over. you heard me. there is, for all intents and purposes, no ending. well there is one, but it is very abrupt and explains nothing. i don't mean it leaves the series open for viewer interpretation, i mean, it's just over. and it completely disregards the existence of several characters. what about victoria? and alexander (he was a very very cool rival for our vampire hunting vampire)? there are rumours of a second season, and i hope there is, because this would certainly be a dissappointing way for this series to end.",1033257600,,1373,4.896995708154506
1718836,5,B000067IYR,"Buffy fans may not like this vampire take as it is more ""classic"" Dracula vampire-noble, viscious, dark/tragic but unapologetic. Like some swashbuckling heroes, Alucard possesses power & skill he rarely fully unleashes(in the name of making things interesting?) & an honor few of the modern-day humans around him seem capable of understanding.
Victoria, with her refusal to ""feed"" thru the first dvd, was annoying, but it fits--given a choice of death or joining Alucard at a moment's notice, she was not fully aware of what she was getting herself into, but we see the classic loyal tie between vampire master & those bitten. As in real life, it seems Victoria's finding it harder to carry out what she must do(drink blood) to the abstract thinking she can do it when agreeing to becoming a vampire.
Integra is very British, the most annoying character in my book, but even her personality is portrayed very well. She will destroy vampires at whatever cost, even if she must use one of the most infamous vamps of all time to do it(strange bedfellows)

The animation was the only problem.  In the first episode, the animation was flawless, it almost looked like movie quality animation, but in the 2nd episode the character animations got sloppy.  Their faces and hands weren't drawn as nice and it looked choppy at times.  Ive noticed this is other anime shows in the past too, and I wish they hadnt done that here.
The dubbed version of the show was pretty good except for Arucards voice, it just didn't sound as creepy as the original.  And I don't know why they thought it was necessary to redub the sounds that the ghouls made.  If you decide to get this, watch the subtitled first.",1032134400,,811,4.513698630136986
1718838,4,B000067IYR,"In this new anime series, we are asked to envision a near future where vampires are an ever present threat, where humans can be implanted with chips that make them ghouls and blood drinkers ...and where the heirs of Van Helsing have founded an organization to fight this menace - The Royal Order of Religious Knights.
Aiding Sir (Lady) Integra Wingates Hellsing in her fight is Arucard (sometimes Alucard), a vampire of great power, who looks on the modern vampire as a shallow imitation.  Arucard's (spell it backwards) exact relationship with the Hellsing family is never made completely clear, but his aesthetic revulsion for those who should be considered his equals is totally clear.  He is a spectacular creature whose flash styling and considerable attitude make him a true centerpiece
for the story.
...P>'The Undead' pits Arucard against a renegade priest who is making ghouls in a small English town.  In this episode we are introduced to Seras Victoria (possibly Victoria Seras) a policewoman who is killed when Arucard dusts the priest.  He makes her a vampire at her request.
In 'Club M' Arucard must bring down a pair of vampire lovers who are literally strafing the countryside with their fangs.  Victoria, is now a member of the Hellsing force, and is having tough a tough time dealing with her new reality.

Arucard is always at the center of this tale, but the real story arc of this series is not the master vampire, but Victoria, who is unprepared for her change to the dark side.  Without some character development, she may very well not survive.  She is not a particularly sympathetic, unable to defend herself as a human, and little better when changed.  She is approaching a crisis that will play itself out in future episodes.
As a production, Hellsing is remarkable.  Stylish characters play against a vibrant setting with a steady level of action.  The music is varied and well done.  And the dialog is simplistic, but not unacceptably so.  Anime and vampire fans should find this a very interesting development.  My biggest complaint comes from the somewhat inept Anglicization of the Japanese script.  Almost every possible mistake of translation and transcription has been made, and this is extremely distracting.  I do recommend that the viewer turn on the subtitles and avoid the overlaid dialog.
One final complaint.  The DVD itself offers very slim pickings - the three episodes total slightly more than an hour and of extras there is nearly nil.  This is intended to be a nine part series, and only greed has kept it from being fit onto two DVDs.  This is a case where good artistic content is spoiled by an excessively mercenary attitude.",1030838400,3,2675,4.904444444444445

It is absolutely great. This is the only anime where I can whatch the ""intro"" scene everytime.
The music is awesome and really makes the scenes stand out. Alucard (or Arucard) is made as an incredibly cool, wicked character, and after each episode u just have to whatch the next one to see what kinda cool stuuf he will be doing. The story is not to easy, a bit strange in some places and really does leave an end that is complyable with a future expansion.
All in all the grafix and the sound make every episode worthwhile, the characters are well written and the action is awesome. If u like the darker kind of anime, u will enjoy this one! The only downside is that it only has 12 eps ""at the moment"".",1030665600,,773,4.22972972972973
1718840,5,B000067IYR,"I picked this one up after seeing the trailer for it on a Pioneer sampler DVD. While I was already amazed by the animation, the story is a very interesting blend of the seedy nightlife of a gothic England, with the proverbial Secret organizations bent on hunting vampires.
The story centers around a very arrogant and self assured vampire named Alucard (Or ARUCARD as the japanese pronounce it), who works for the Secret, vampire-hunting Hellsing organization. Arucard ""recruits"" a young female in the special British forces, after he shoots her in an attempt to kill a vampire. With death slowly taking her, Arucard gives her the choice of continued existence as a vampire, which she accepts.
The Animation quality is fresh and excellent in this series, with plenty of action to keep a viewer interested. The somber, piano opening theme along with its soft vocals is very rich and dark in its simplicity. while its end theme is performed by early 90's band ""Mr. Big"", offsetting the gloominess of the story with its upbeat melody ""Shine"". The flamenco guitars for the scene music is also very good and appropriate.
The only drawback is that the story is good and well thought out, it proceeds slowly as far as Alucards past is concerned or his motives for working for a vampire hunting agency. The story with young Victoria, the rookie cop turned vampire has been done before, although here it helps lighten the feel of the story and adds the ever necessary comic relief as well as some well shot scenes of her fighting to keep her humanity, in the face of her growing vampirism. Her loneliness in her new ""Un-life"" is reflected in the scenes of her in her new ""Room"" which is furnished only with a table, a bathroom (Do vampires need to pee?) and a coffin.
If you are a stickler for the traditional vampire rules, you might balk at the thought of vampires walking into churches and wearing holy symbols, or refusing orders from their masters. However, if you can forego all that and enjoy the show just for its story value, then this might be a series worthy of your viewing.
Overall a must buy. Definite must have for any vampire aficionado.",1030406400,,2144,4.704787234042553

This anime has EVERYTHING!!! Good story, lovable and deep characters, and vampires! It dosnt get better, does it? Not really.....
This is currently my favorite anime, because it really got me into it. I love the characters (except Seras, I hate her!) and the story is really interesting.
ANother plus to this one is the MUSIC!!! Man, it's got good listening! I especially love ""Shine"" at the end, mainly cause I am a sucker for sweet songs on a not so sweet anime...

A world where anything is possible and where all impure souls are destroyed. Alucard takes great pleasure in his work. Seras Victoria is a young police woman that actually looks like a real police woman. She is stout and muscular just right for combat. She drives the pulsing heart of Hellsing. A little shaky at times but determined to follow Alucard's every command referring to him at all times as Master. Personally I think she wants to be his slave forever. I don't know just a guess.
Check out Hellsing it is an anime that will blow your mind! Of course younger viewers under age 16 might find it somewhat disturbing but for the rest of you out there watch this anime!!!! Hellsing is amazingly cool!!!!!!",1029369600,,877,4.592356687898089

The debate is OVER: It's ""ALUCARD"" not ""ARUCARD"" or ""AKKARD"" (Even though it says ""Arucard"" on the box, the english voices clearly say ""Alucard"" :-) ).
2 things I didn't like:
#1: If you're used to the Japanese voices, it'll take a while to get used to the english ones, and sometimes they're a bit disappointing. I was expecting Alucard's voice to be deeper, and he (and Seras) sometimes lack feeling (but then again, I'm used to the over-exaggerated Japanese :-) ). After I watched through it a couple of times, the voices grew on me. :-)
#2: What are the lyrics to the opening song? The subtitles don't say the lyrics. Not a biggie (in fact, everyone who I talked to didn't care) but a small disappointment :-) I was blown away by the sound quality.

Sometimes you want to see guys with big guns fight guys with big swords. Hellsing is a series that's just nice to sit down and watch and not have to think very much.
If you want to hear the good stuff, read one of the many glowing reviews.
The only problem I had with the series was I seem to be the only one that noticed a lack of consistent character design. Several of the minor characters change their look between episodes. Their eyes get higher on their forehead or scars get longer. It seems like the animators were working with different designs or changing them on their own. Episode 9 has a very detailed Integra Hellsing throughout, with short bangs in front of her forehead (which she doesn't seem to have in any other episode), and then the first scene of 10 she walks out of a helicopter looking quickly drawn and quite like a character out of Gundam Wing. Victoria's nose is like Prince John's mole from ""Men In Tights."" Its size, shape, and even position seem to change by the scene, and even as she turns her head. This one flaw is annoying, but doesn't really take a lot away from this fine series.
And to answer a few people's questions there are only 3 episodes on the disc because there are only 13 episodes and they're streching it to 4 dvd's.
3 + 3 + 3 + 4 = 13
They COULD smush it all onto 2 dvd's, but keep in mind they're out to make money people.

In fact I would have easily given this series a ""five star"" rating if not for its weak ending.  I think many people who have given this series a high rating probably have not had the opportunity to see the final few episodes which were quite disappointing.  The series had moving along so well but then it ends rather abruptly leaving a whole host of unanswered questions to the viewers.

Alucard (In the official version his name is spelled Arucard but it really make sense since backwards Arucard is Dracura not Dracula) is just one bad...guy and the fight scenes are really cool.

The story details the Hellsing agency, leaded by Integra Wingates Hellsing. She is the descendant of the legendary doctor/vampire-hunter Abraham Van Helsing from Bram Stokers Dracula.
Because of her bloodline, she has control of a maliciously powerful vampire named Alucard, whose origin has yet to be revealed.
Alucard has become the top agent of the Hellsing agency, whose job is to protect the Queen of England from all sorts of undead rabble and/or monsters.
During a mission, Alucard ""embraces"" a female policewoman, making her a creature of the night as well.
The policewoman, named Ceres Victoria, struggles to accept her new undead form, which is also a main theme of the anime.
The art of the anime is stunning... though it varies in some of the later episodes. Also, the soundtrack is smooth and cool.
Definitely worth a buy if you like horror, vampires (or Vampire Hunter D), or H.P. Lovecraft (as the series is highly inspired by the Lovecraftian realm).

In a alternate reality, zombies terrify UK (another difference between Hellsing and other anime is the setting, very unusual) and the Hellsing Institution is called frequently to dispatch their agents to take care of the situation. Their best agent is Arucard, a vampire that work for Hellsing under a pact with the institution manager, Integra...  Of course, part of the interest on the show came from the question on why a powerfull vampire like Arucard is working for Integra to destroy his own kind.
While nobody can't deny that Arucard is the main character of the show, Victoria, a former police officer, changed into a vampire by Arucard by her own will, plays an important role on the first half of the series and gives it a somewhat special feeling. While she discovers the powers that she's been gifted by turning into a vampire and fights along Arucard at Hellsing, she is in a conflict with her former self with her new reality, so it helps to show how old, experienced and powerful Arucard is. The contrast between then, master and aprentice, is a way to enhance Arucard's character in a clever way.
Hellsing has lot of gore, so if you don't like this, skip it, if you don't mind, them there's a lot of plot and battle sequences to entertain you for quite some time.

My friend ordered the same thing, his was right though. So, you may or may not get what you want, remember that. =(",1321315200,,651,3.9770992366412212
7963467,3,B000067IYR,Some of the UMDs of this title are not what they appear due to a manufacture error I would suggest getting this title used to ensure you actually get a copy with Hellsing on it and not some other Anime as it's not something you can know before you open it and pop it in your PSP and for the same reason a seller cannot prevent this in the case of a sealed copy....,1262131200,,364,3.9324324324324325
7963468,5,B000067IYR,"Nice twist on the Dracula tale.  The production is exceptionally good with rich palette and excellent English dubbing that is even superior to the original voice cast.  The violence is highly stylized and graphic, definitely not for kids.  The storyline and the dialogues really hold your attention and have a nice progression, all except for the ending - not sure what happened there.  The music is absolutely fabulous - definitely get the two CDs, Ruin and Raid.",1262131200,,464,4.987012987012987
7963469,5,B000067IYR,"Although Hellsing is a short series containing only 13 episodes, it is one of the best animes I have ever seen. It is based of the Manga (somewhat different than the actual anime series). If you're an anime fan Hellsing would definitely be a great addition to your collection.",1213488000,,276,4.653061224489796
