7804569,3,6300179907,"""Space Rage"" is approximately equal parts ""The Good, The Bad, and The Ugly"" and ""Battlefield Earth"". It's another prison planet travesty starring Michael Par as the cold-blooded Grange, who is sentenced to a life of extraterrestrial mining for robbing a bank in a mall. On the good side of the law is veteran character actor Richard Farnsworth as a retired LAPD cop who is out for revenge in a very unoriginal plot. Unfortunately the talents of the great Emmy-winning actor William Windom (you may remember him as Commodore Matt Decker from ""The Doomsday Machine"" episode of the original ""Star Trek"" series) are squandered here as the Governor of the planet. Windom is clearly the best actor in the film, but even his presence can't save this planet from doomsday.

The film features endless clips of dune buggies and attempted prison breaks; there are also subplots about intestinal laser diode smuggling and mass kidnapping. About this time the audience could really use a good diversion: fortunately the director had a faux-pop song called ""Blood Money"" available to him. I lost count of how many times this horrible piece of music was offered up to the audience, but if memory serves it was somewhere around a million. Seriously, the filmmakers absolutely love this song: I am betting that you won't.

The movie is extremely predictable, is full of bad acting, a terrible script, and sizeable holes in the plot, yet I found redeeming points. It really is just a spaghetti western in space, and is actually kind of fun in a hokey B-movie way. Although it's no great work of cinema, I am going to round the two and a half stars it deserves to three based on the presence of William Windom and some totally laughable special effects.",1213747200,,1734,4.835016835016835
7804570,3,6300179907,"""B"" movies don't get any better than this, that's why there's such a thing as ""A"" movies.
The character of the colonel was kind of interesting... he was like an eighty-year-old Mad Max. Would've been neat if they focused on him more.
The music [was bad ]. It gave the movie a [less than quality] feeling. The acting was good, considering the circumstances. Even the black guy form Married With Children was here... No Ma'am!
I also recognized the other guy (he played the Governor) who was in ""The Doomsday Machine"" from Star Trek.
Still you have to wonder how this movie ever got made.",1046822400,2,586,4.59047619047619
7804571,1,6300179907,"Jesus, where do I begin.  Quite simply, this movie has a top 10 spot in my Rage-Cage.  This movie involved complete audience abuse, I can't believe I wasted 10 minutes of my life figuring out that it was killing my brain cells one by one.  How can anyone really believe that this took place at a ""space prison""?  It looked more like an oil refinery in Bakersfield, CA.  I bet this film project earned the director a D+ in a College of the Canyons (by SIx Flags) film class.  Holy Fvking Sh! t, I would rather be sodomized by a rusty pipe than be forced to sit through this shizzat again.  PEACE I'M OUT.",1034899200,,603,4.2368421052631575
