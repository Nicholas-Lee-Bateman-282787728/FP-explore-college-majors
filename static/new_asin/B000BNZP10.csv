8688066,3,B000BNZP10,It was actually a great product. The only reason I give it 3 stars instead of 5 is because it was wayyyyyyy over priced. The only reason I even purchased it for so muchis because my daughter has been crying ever since our other copy broke and I ccouldn't find it anywhere else.,1368144000,,277,4.245283018867925

This DVD contains videos my baby loves them, mainly ""los pollitos"" (the little chickens) and ""cu-cu cantaba la rana"" (cu-cu sang the frog). I highly recommend it",1197849600,,282,5.0
8688068,5,B000BNZP10,"This is a beautiful collection of Spanish children's songs animated with fun cartoons. Many of these songs I sang myself as a child and I can now sing them along with my daughter. She is mesmerized by the colorful characters and the catchy rithms and lyrics. She can't quite yet sing along, but she does mimic the songs. It is a great tool for parents trying to teach Spanish. In addition to the fun children's songs, the DVD includes the Multiplication tables songs that help school age children learn them.

This collection includes songs of Marlore Andwanter, a children's songs composer famous for the ""Canticuentos"" collection that includes songs such as: La Iguana y el Perezoso, La Serpiente de Tierra Caliente, Sammy el Heladero, etc.

This is a great way to bond with your child and have fun singing and playing.
