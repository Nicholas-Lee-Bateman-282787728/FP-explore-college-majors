8082329,5,B000B6D758,"I love this show so much. The good, the bad, and of course the sad. There are several episodes that are guaranteed to make you cry. The extras on the dvds are cool too. Especially reading all the biographies of the kids (who are no longer kids) who played Matthew (Chad Allen), Colleen (Erika FLores, and Jessica Bowman)and Brian (Shawn Tovey). Beautiful show.",1135641600,6,360,4.73015873015873
