8193131,5,B000PSP7JQ,"This is an vastly under-rated series that deserves to be seen by anyone liking Old School espionage and action shows.  Richard Bradford (who has appeared in the recent BOURNE series) is a classic ""man against the odds"" ex-spy protagonist whose surly manner and tenacity get him deep into trouble.  Each episode is unique and offers a new challenge for the man McGill, and not all of his exploits end well.  Highly recommended for fans of The Saint, Danger Man and The Prisoner.",1410480000,2,477,4.7926829268292686
8193132,5,B000PSP7JQ,"Ah, the sixties. The ultimate in cool. With current shows like Madmen out there, a resurgence in sixties cool is in the public awareness. Well a lot of really great television shows were made in the sixties that helped define cool in that era. MAN IN A SUITCASE was one of them.

Produced in England and starring an American actor, MAN IN A SUITCASE was about a disgraced secret agent having to adjustand survivein a  life with significantly fewer resources than in his former life as an American agent. Talk about living by your wits! And, of course, living out of a suitcase. The star of MAN IN A SUITCASE was the ultra-cool Richard Edwin Bradford, known professionally just as Richard Bradford, a native of Texas who shares the same birthdate as another great sixties star, (albeit on the big screen) and another RichardRichard Burton.

Bradford is an intriguing combination of James Dean, Clu Gulager and Clint Eastwood. Theres may be even a touch of Marlon Brando in there (who Bradford beat to a pulp in the odd melodrama The Chase, just prior to beginning production on this series). Bradford said about his one-season stint on MAN IN A SUITCASE that he was putting his heart and soul into trying to create a realistic character the audience could really latch on to. He saw McGill, his first-nameless character as much more grounded in reality than his contemporary TV spies like Roger Moore in The Saint and especially Patrick McGoohan in Danger Man (also known as Secret Agent). In fact it was McGoohans departure from his hit series (he wanted out to do The Prisoner) that opened the door for a replacement series. The result was MAN IN A SUITCASE, envisioned as a sort of noirish, gritty, man-without-a-country type of show produced in England but with enough appeal for American audiences (by having an American star in the lead).

Unfortunately, though, Bradford wasn't really a star. Hed only done a few high profile roles prior to this series. And the show didn't really have a chance, being up against such staples as Gomer Pyle and the Friday Night Movie. I have vague memories of the show as a kid, though I don't remember watching it.

Throwing myself full-tilt into the vintage TV mindset, I was delighted to find that this series really holds up. Bradfords McGill isn't as enigmatic as I might like him to be, but he is very interesting to watch. Bradfords got the James Dean intensity, the Clu Gulager mumbling (which is curiously compelling when it isn't unintelligible) and the Clint Eastwood swagger down pat. You cant take your eyes off him. And given hes in virtually every scene, that is critical.

The only drawback to the Set 1 DVD release was that only the first 15 episodes were included. This was a one-season series. Anticipation for the rest of the episodes is a good thing, but also a little frustrating. It would have been nice to at least give us some extras to tide us over, including an interview with Bradford, who is still working today in character roles. With the release of Set 2, however, all these issues have been resolved. The Set 2 DVD boxed set includes the last 15 episodes, an additional photo gallery (also included on the Set 1 DVD), plus an intimate interview with Bradford, filmed in 2005. Problem solved! The entire series is now available on the two boxed sets and well worth the wait.

MAN IN A SUITCASE achieves a nice balance between secret agent/espionage types of storylines and those with a more noirish/private detective slant. The mixture keeps things reasonably fresh. And the guest stars are certainly nothing to sneeze at. From Donald Sutherland at his gawky, pre-star best to the voluptuous yet still wholesome Judy Geeson, there are excellent performances from all and sundry. Many of them seem to eye Bradford with a sort of whats this American Method actor going to do next? In this case, thats not a bad thing. Its easy to find shows of this type from the sixties to be a little bit hokey. But I really found that MAN IN A SUITCASE sustains its dramatic premise very well. That is almost entirely due to the artistic integrity of Richard Bradford. Maybe he is a star after all, in hindsight. Regardless, MAN IN A SUITCASE travels very well.

8193133,4,B000PSP7JQ,"Responsible for a string hit shows in the mystery, espionage, and mystery genres, like The Avengers, The Saint, and Danger Man, Britain's ITC (Incorporated Television Company) Entertainment also produced Man In a Suitcase (1967-68) a series that lasted for just one season, producing 30 episodes featuring Richard Bradford as an ex-intelligence operative named McGill.

In the first episode ""Man From the Dead"", it is learned that McGill (no first name stated) was an American agent who was disgraced about six years previously, and is regarded by some as a traitor.  McGill discovers that his reputation was sacrificed as part of a scheme to plant agents behind the iron curtain.  Rather than endanger those operatives, McGill chooses to remain in disgrace.  He makes his living doing investigative work, and other odd jobs that usually involve intrigue, and danger.  The title of the series comes from McGill's somewhat nomadic lifestyle, as he frequently travels from place to place carrying a worn tan suitcase.

McGill may travel light, and doesn't always go first class, but he is seldom in dire financial straits.  With a tarnished reputation in some circles, McGill seems to have no shortage of employment opportunities, and is sometimes selected to be the fall guy.  McGill is ruggedly handsome, but has some rough edges, and lacks the refinement and sophistication of a Simon Templar.  His prematurely graying hair, makes him look a lot older.  Because he has received a raw deal, McGill has a big chip on his shoulder, and his headstrongness seems to cloud his judgment at times.  He can be a fierce fighter, but still takes a number of beatings, and is also badly wounded on several occasions.  This may add an element of realism, but fortunately McGill appears to be a fast healer.

Operating as a lone wolf, and without employing high tech ""Bondlike"" gadgets, McGill is a tough operator who has a tendency to be stubborn, and doesn't always take the sensible course of action.  Similar to Danger Man, the series has as a dark cynical tone, with very little humor.  McGill was apparently originally conceived as more of a light hearted wiseguy, but Bradford preferred taking a more dark, low key approach, and also changed his lines, which apparently didn't endear him to many in the writing and production staff.

The adventures are set in mostly European locations, and feature a lot of variety, from different types of crimes, to political intrigue, to international espionage.  The episodes are generally well written, and pretty lively.  For those acquainted with other ITC series from the era, the stories will seem familiar, as will many of the guest stars.  And once you get used to the downbeat vibe, and McGill's at times sour attitude, the lack of happy endings won't be as much of an issue.  McGill may never be the most popular guy, but his determination and personal integrity are quite admirable.

Albert Elm's music and cues for the series, are very reminiscent of Edwin Astley's work on The Saint.  Image quality is quite good for a program over forty years old.  The 8 DVD set has a substantial set of extras on each disc, including some guest cast bios, and a great number of photos taken during the production of the various episodes.  Richard Bradford even provides a commentary, but unfortunately his memories regarding the series are not the best.  For those that enjoy ITC Productions' mystery and suspense programs, Man In A Suitcase is a series that is well worth your time, along with&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Baron/dp/B001NH4CEY/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Baron</a>&nbsp;(1965-66).
