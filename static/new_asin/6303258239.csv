7843260,1,6303258239,Terrible quality. Looks like 4th or 5th generation copy. Only for diehard collectors.,1520035200,,85,5.615384615384615
7843261,1,6303258239,"Save your money.  This is a VERY bad print of the film.  The faces are purple.  The image is blurry as if someone smeared Vaseline on the camera lens.  It appears to be a tape recording of a print of the film that was kept under someone's kitchen sink the last 10 years.

Hopefully, someone will come out with a much better print of this film.  Because this one is unwatchable.",1495324800,,377,4.23943661971831
7843262,5,6303258239,"Silly movie I remembered seeing on channel 9 as a kid. Original title was ""the wizard of mars.""  Why the change?  Seemed a bit scant, I wondered if parts were missing.  ""Good clean fun""",1468195200,,185,4.382352941176471
7843263,3,6303258239,"Four astronauts crash-land on the surface of Mars, where they encounter strange lifeforms, travel by raft and on foot, in order to get to an ancient city. All this, while a narrator drones on, and ""eerie"" sound effects intone. THE WIZARD OF MARS (aka: HORRORS OF THE RED PLANET 1965) is a silly sci-fi epic, loosely based on THE WIZARD OF OZ. Yep, the female astronaut is named Dorothy, and there's even a ""golden road"" to follow! Oh my! John Carradine plays a cameo role as THE WIZARD of the title. Basically, a histrionic floating-head. His ultra-melodramatic speech seems endless! If, like me, you are fearless in the midst of atrocious ""acting"" and ""dialogue"", and plot is of no real importance, then this movie should be a kick...",1456185600,2,735,4.75

7843265,4,6303258239,"For a movie filmed on a shoestring budget - it actually is halfway decent. The special effects are terrible of course. The sets are cheap (what sets there were) and a very noticable error about midway through the film, when there rafting thrugh a cave supposedly moving, acting like they were moving, and weren't moving at all. For what they had to work with in those days -  I can still live with it. I admit I was surprised that with the  VHS also came a DVD-R and that the movie wasn't as deteriorated as I expected it to be being a 45+ years film. All the actors and eve bernhardt did a good job",1312934400,2,599,4.2
7843266,1,6303258239,"Also known as The Horrors of the Red Planet, this mind-numbing example of cinematic uselessness should be avoided at all costs, although it would perhaps find a fitting place in one of the outer circle screening rooms of Dante?s Inferno.  Cursed with a mindless plot, horrible acting, and remarkably abysmal special effects, this movie ends by insulting whatever intelligence is left of the poor mind afflicted with its 77-minute curse.  Primary responsibility for this farce goes to David Hewitt who wrote, directed, and produced it (very likely doing it all in one day, by the looks of it), although advisor Forrest J. Ackerman also deserves part of the blame.  A Mars exploration team consisting of a clueless pilot, an incredibly annoying ?little buddy? co-pilot, sour-puss doctor of some subject we know is not geology, and an exceedingly useless female crew member encounter some very strange (and very repetitive) forces in the Martian atmosphere and end up crashing on to the surface, not before jettisoning their life-supporting lander unknown miles away from them.  Unfortunately?for the audience?the crew survive and begin searching for their supply pod.  A raft ride through a Martian mist-enshrouded sea takes them into an underground cavern, from which they explore all sorts of unimpressive subterranean passages before reemerging onto the surface.  When all hope is seemingly lost, they discover an ancient road leading to an alien city.  Yes, friends, this is the greatest insult of all?David Hewitt actually passed this movie off as a Martian version of The Wizard of Oz.  Having come across an ancient yellow brick road, our four heroes make their way to a ruined ?Emerald City? where they discover Martians with brains larger than their heads entombed in mysterious columns.  Finally, they come face to disembodied face with the ?wizard,? who is none other than John Carradine.  I placed all my shattered hopes in the eventual appearance of Carradine, telling myself he would at least give me one good thing to say about this movie?once again, I was disappointed.  He just spouts off about the Martian genius and how they removed themselves from time and want to go back because life is meaningless without death.  As I mentioned before, the ending (welcome as it is after so much cinematic suffering) is an insult to the viewer?s intelligence.
Please beware of both main titles of this wretched movie because it can be found bearing one or the other.  The Wizard of Mars is the same movie as The Horrors of the Red Planet The; I am posting a review under each listing here because I feel it incumbent upon me to warn the world of the danger this movie poses to thinking beings everywhere.  In fact, there are reports that this awful thing has even been known to employ a third alias, that of Alien Massacre.  Consider this movie unarmed yet very, very dangerous.  Finally, do not believe any box cover that lists Lon Chaney as one of the stars?I defy anyone to show me a Chaney of any sorts in this movie.  To avoid any possible confusion, let me characterize this movie in one word: abysmal.",1043452800,3,3113,4.932950191570881
