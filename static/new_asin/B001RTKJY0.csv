8636867,4,B001RTKJY0,"In this grim and violent drama, Salman Khan plays Ajay, abandoned as a baby and raised by a police officer.  Despite his adopted father's kindness, Ajay finds life difficult and grows up serious, hard, and deadly.  When he tangles with the local crime boss, Ajay's family and friends are targeted.  Ajay then becomes a vigilante and sacrifices all to free his community.

Unlike the typical Bollywood film, there is no romance or comedy.  It is strictly drama, addressing serious issues such as forced prostitution, government corruption, and the near impossibility of rising from poverty to a decent life.  Khan's character carries the weight of the world on his shoulders, and Khan doesn't smile once until the poignant last five minutes of the movie.  While this is not a movie I'd ever watch again, it is powerful, and I'm glad I've seen it.",1490659200,,845,4.908450704225352
8636868,5,B001RTKJY0,"Please don't get me wrong, I enjoy the colours and dance and music numbers in Bollywood love movies.
But this one to me stands alone on its own, one of the few Bollywood movies I've seen so far where the hero hasn't got a love story, or a leading lady, and it also addresses some serious issues such as bribe, corrupted politicians, exploitation of sex workers, and their struggling to rise from hell and gain a decent life.
The plot revolves around two young men, Ajay (Salman Khan) and Shlock (Athul Agnilhotri), both of them born in the red light area of Bombay. Ajay was dumped in a gutter as a newborn and rescued by a merciful policeman, who resolves to keep the baby and raise him, in spite of his stubborn and proud wife who, beyond social reproof, also fears for her own child's legal rights. So Ajay grows on to be a strong, cynical and grieved young man, who also feels the pain to have unwillingly thrown his adoptive father into a lonely life, since the policeman's wife has really forsaken him, not accepting the gutter baby. While Ajay bitterly loves the old man who rescued him, he nonetheless can't help being a rebellious kid, who bunks school and takes up gambling with other forsaken children who would never question him about his family and, later on, he becomes a young man who doesn't believe in love and in settling down with a regular job, because of the corrupted society he's not able to fit in; in the same time, however, he sticks to his own ethical code, which forbids him from stealing and cheating, and he's always willing to protect the poor and the abused one. Ajay is linked to Shlock, who's also the son of a prostitute but whose mother has kept him, and devoted her whole life to give him a chance of happiness, saving all her money to send him to college, and allowing him to lead a decent life; but this was also made possible by the merciful policeman who, after adopting Ajay, agreed as well to give his name to Shlock, who otherwise would never be admitted to any school. So Ajay and Shlock share a sort of brotherhood, where Shlock and his girlfriend care for Ajay and bail him out every time he is jailed for some brawls, or any other misbehaving, and the latter loves his adoptive brother to the extent of risking his own life in gambling with a dangerous goon, the owner of all the brothels in the red light area, aiming to raise the money Shlock needs to start his own enterprise, to earn a living and finally get married.
This is just the first half of the story, which is not headed to a happy ending, but I really loved this movie, and heartily wanted to purchase the DVD because to me it's one of the best performances showed by Salman Khan in his whole career, with a strong chemistry and a great performance as well by all the other cast members.
I also believe this was a courageous movie to bring on those social issues, and a brave choice on Salman Khan's side, who in those early years (1995) had already proven himself on a wide range of different roles, and also proved he was not piggybacking on the safe bet of a consolidated formula such as Prem, the dashing loverboy or the witty, fun loving comedian of his previous performances. In this movie I believe he's really at his best showing new shades of himself, and portrays his character with ease and charisma, not forgetting the atletic side of all the stunts he performs in his movies; and though apparently this film didn't go well at the box office, I still maintain that it was a very good movie, which I enjoyd in spite of being such a dark story, though laced here and there with some (very brief) moments of hope and peacefulness. Besides, though not being a western movie and, therefore, not openly showing sex scenes, it really portrays a grievous and dark atmosphere in a quite neo-realistic way, with a background sound of shrieking women (in the brothels) and an anguished atmosphere, in an ever darkening sky.
The DVD technical quality is good enough, though it's not a blue-ray image definition, and there are no extras, save for the collection of dance and music numbers; the price, though not cheap, is affordable, but definetly I believe this is a worthy movie which was underrated, and might some day be reassessed, and gain new success, as happened to many other movies.",1348704000,,4304,4.526315789473684
