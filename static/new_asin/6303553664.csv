7850074,5,6303553664,"This, 15 yrs. ago, was my first ever Yoga Tape purchased. And Guess What? I purchased it again!! (just in case the vhs dies on me!) I wanted to start learning Yoga, and accidentally, purchased this one, which is recomended for Seniors. (I was only 20-Something)This Is The Best Beginners Tape for Anyone, Any Age, etc.. Lilias is so Warm and Friendly, and teaches Great form. I eventually took Yoga classes, and ordered other dvd's, and Thanks to Lilias, I learned good form from her. I use this dvd, for my anxiety and panic attacks..By the middle of this tape, I feel better, and of course by the end My anxiety is always relieved!! It will also give you great flexibility, if you do it at least 4 times a week! It opens you up, so that you can get out of bed easier - No Pain!! I love her Butterfly exercise, it is as Lilias says, ""Such A Beautiful Posture! "" I now do all kinds of Yoga , from beginners to intermediate, to advanced.. All thanks to this one video..and as I said before..I always Return Home.. to Lilias and her wonderful vhs tape! (maybe it will appear on dvd one day!) Hope this Helps anyone out there..Namaste!!",1231372800,,1133,4.4
7850075,5,6303553664,"This is an excellent stretch and toning workout for anyone who is sedentary, stiff, needs to sit, has pain anywhere. This workout is done with a chair and some floor work. It is actually the beginning of the practice of yoga in a safe way. I have worked with seniors for years and highly recommend this video to increase flexibility, strength, coordination and comfort.
I personally used Lilias yoga tapes when she was a young woman in the 70's and she still has a nurturing, calming and supportive style of helping you and your body improve in function. My husband and I have enjoy doing the stretches especially when stress causes neck and back pain. After doing 30 minutes, no pain and increased energy for our day! A great gift for yourself and your parents no matter what their age...no matter what their age!",1035849600,19,814,4.659722222222222
7850076,5,6303553664,I have found this video to be wonderful.  I suffer from chronic pain in the neck and lower back.  Since I've been doing this tape I've noticed increased flexibility and mobility.  I would recommend it for anyone with chronic pain.,982108800,20,230,4.7
7850077,5,6303553664,"I love Lilias' warm, friendly relaxed style. I don't have much  flexibilty or mobility due to arthritis, especially in my hips.  I feel so rejuvenated  after all the stretching and breathing  exercises. I have just started  yoga, but I have been faithful in practicing. I think after I loosen up, I  will be ready for the next level in a few weeks. Thanks, Lilias!",966556800,14,364,4.609375
