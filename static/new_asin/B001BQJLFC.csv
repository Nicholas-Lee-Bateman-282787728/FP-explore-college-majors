Do not be fooled by the cover art shown here on amazon either, the cover does not feature Christopher Lee, Bela Lugosi, or Boris Karloff on the front instead it is a cheesy layout of skulls.

3497781,3,B001BQJLFC,"Mill Creek's Legends of Horror 50-Movie Pack continues the distributor's recent disturbing trend of recycling movies previously offered in their other 50-Movie Packs.  Of the offerings in this boxed set, 31 of the 50 pictures can be found in other 50-Movie Packs, let alone their 100-Movie Packs, 250-Movie Packs and various other offerings.  Thirteen of the films can be found in their Tales of Terror 50-Movie Pack, 3 in Drive-In Classics, 5 in Chilling Classics, 5 in Nightmare Worlds, 4 in Night Screams and 1 in Sci-Fi Classics.  In fact, three films, Island Monster (1954), The Phantom Creeps (1949) and Shock (1946) can be found on 3 different 50-Movie Packs.

On a positive note, most of the new releases are films directed by Alfred Hitchcock early in his career - including such classics as The Lady Vanishes (1938), The Thirty-Nine Steps (1935), Sabotage (1936), Secret Agent (1936) and the Man Who Knew Too Much (1934).  A number of Hitch's silent films from the 1920s, some of them quite good, can be found in this set.  Although Hitchcock later produced some classic horror films, most of the public domain films in this set are straight dramas or even comedies.  Juno and the Paycock (1930), for example, can hardly be considered to be a horror film.

As with most Mill Creek offerings, the quality of the prints ranges from mediocre to quite good.  The films in the boxed set are listed below, along with the stars and the movie's rating on a 10 point scale gleaned from a popular movie database:

3497801,4,B001BQJLFC,"I agree with other reviewers that the early films of Alfred Hitchcock don't really fall under the Horror genre - they tend to be be mysteries, dramas, thrillers, and even comedies. If you don't own them already, their inclusion here is a bonus. The main reason I picked up this set was for the six films from Britain's Tod Slaughter in the ""Legends"" collection. He is most famous for starring in Sweeney Tood: The Demon Barber of Fleet Street long before Johnny Depp appeared in the role under Tim Burton's direction. Unfortunately, that film isn't in this set, but alot of Tod Slaughter's other great films are. Collecting Tod Slaughter's many films can be expensive, so this is a great way to get them at a super low price! I had never seen any of his movies until I picked up this set, his performances are ""hammy, way over the top"", and he's really quite good. There are also a few rare curios from horror icons like Bela Lugosi, Barbara Steele, and Lon Chaney Jr. that make this collection worthwhile. You can view the full list of titles in this set at Mill Creek Entertainment's web site or on Amazon.com. As usual the video quality varies from film to film, but it's generally good.",1395014400,,1190,4.565420560747664

3497811,4,B001BQJLFC,"You could almost call this the Early Hitchcock Collection, or perhaps the British Grand Guignol Collection, as there are 13 Hitchcocks and 6 Tod Slaughters. But as there are 5 Lugosis, several by Lon Chaney Jr and by Boris Karloff and 3 by Christopher Lee, ""Legends of Horror"" is not inaccurate - even if a lot of the movies aren't by any means horror.

I specifically bought it for Tod Slaughter, whose wildly overacted melodramas I find hilarious, and wasn't disappointed. I haven't seen The Ticket of Leave Man in any other collection.

The Hitchcocks are great too, lots of early pictures you'd have trouble finding elsewhere. I have long wanted to see The Lodger (not bad at all), which had the added interest of starring Ivor Novello - I thought he was just a songwriter.

For those who gave one star - what exactly were you expecting? And what were you expecting for this price? To my mind, if you get 5 movies you really enjoy you've got your money's worth, and I've had mine several times over.

This is the third 50 Movie set I've bought - the others were Horror Classics and Mystery Classics - and if you accept them for what they are I think they are some of the best products on the market.",1369353600,22,1203,4.47945205479452

3497820,4,B001BQJLFC,"Legends of Horror features mostly black & white movies from the 1940's and earlier; in fact, there are quite a few silent movies(many of which are not really Horror but more like Drama/Suspense). But mostly this should have been renamed 'The Early Hitchcock Collection' as this set contains quite a few of Hitchcock's earliest creations(including a few silent era gems). There's even a couple episodes of 'Hitchcock Presents'.

Picture and sound quality is what you would expect from a budget set(okay to bad). But everything is view-able and just make sure the audio is up so you can clearly hear what the actors are saying. Some of my favorites include ""Rich and Strange""(1932), ""The 39 Steps""(1935), ""The Bowery at Midnight""(1942), ""The Face at the Window""(1939), and ""The Manxman""(1926).

This set isn't quite as good as some of the other horror/terror themed sets that Mill Creek has released(mainly because too many of these are not really horror and also most of these movies are extremely old). So I say get this set only if you are into Hitchcock's early stuff(otherwise try some of Mill Creeks other horror sets first, they have quite a few). And lastly, with Amazon's price, each movie comes out to about 25 cents each(quite a deal).",1351382400,5,1244,4.947368421052632

These movies aren't even the ""B"" movies that were shown at the drive-ins. The sound quality is not that great, muddy most of the time. The acting in some of these movies seems forced, almost to the point of over-acting.  These movies are more of drama than horror. If you are looking for a collection with Frankenstein, Dracula, the Mummy, this collection is not for you. If you like movies of the quality of  The Brain that Wouldn't Die, The Killer Shrews, The Hand, the movies on this collection are so much less that that.

The new todays so called horror may seem exciting, but its all hype and computer generated..these are actors playing roles and using skills to make you shiver..not Computer animation we see way to much of in todays movies. They make the movies today an impossiblity, those like these of yesteryears seem more real like they could actually be true. Not a little man growing in a giant wolf or some creature mad on a screen, but real humans with real hair and or real teeth not fangs hanging to their waist like some of the crazy things we see today being made. A werewolf is man like...not some giant wolf from a little boy...come on..it may look good but its not a actuality. Wolfman Lon Chaney Jr coud be reality for example the twilight stuff although may appear neat...can not be true to form and neither can underworld  we see today Yes they are good movies..but the older ones allowed you to ""THINK"" it could be a real possiblity...Horror at its best.....Think About that !!",1328572800,3,1113,4.482758620689655
3497823,5,B001BQJLFC,"I would say this movie collection is about Terror or Suspense movies - rather than classifying it as ""Horror."" ""Legends of Horror"" is rather misleading - however, all your favorites are there - ie Bela Lugosi, Christopher Lee, Boris Karloff,etc. Even some Euro Horrro Movie greats ie Barbara Steele and Paul Naschy aka Jacinto Molina. The mix becomes a little muddled by including Alfred Hitchock - who's movies are more along the lines of Suspense or Dark Mysteries.

By checking with the Vendor - I was able to get the Black and White Cover with Bela, Karloff and Lee on the cover...and I have to say for the price the packaging was excellent. A lot of care went into presenting a lot of movies for very little money. Each movie has a logo on each disc, each disc has a sleeve, every sleeve has a description of each movie.

All in all - I am very pleased with the whole effort. I even got to watch some of the early Todd Slaughter movies who was the King of Ham when it comes to portraying bad guys - lots of mustache twirling and cackling as he dispatches his latest victim.

In regards to this entire collection - well worth the money spent...and Fun!",1328572800,2,1156,4.443396226415095

3497825,2,B001BQJLFC,"MILL CREEK's LEGENDS OF HORROR is a craftily titled box of retreads. Many are British Alfred Hitchcock pictures, who is widely considered ""The Master of Suspense,"" and not necessarily a ""Legend of Horror,"" thus these are anything BUT fright films. ""Juno and the Paycock"" is a Sean O'Casey drama. ""The Cheney Vase"" isn't a movie at all-- it's a 24 minute episode of the TV show&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/ALFRED-HITCHCOCK-PRESENTS/dp/B000AL733G/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">ALFRED HITCHCOCK PRESENTS</a>. ""Jamaica Inn"" is about land-based pirates. ""Number Seventeen"" is a wry whodunit that ends with a runaway train. ""The Lady Vanishes,"" also set on a train, is a crime drama. ""Rich and Strange"" and ""Easy Virtue"" are melodramas; the latter has humorous touches. Not a scare in either. ""Secret Agent"" and ""Sabotage"" are spy pictures. There's suspense, but no horror. ""Manxman"" is silent, and involves a love triangle.

This genre bait-and-switch isn't limited to Hitch's early library.

""Shock"" refers to electroshock. It's a private hospital-set crima drama starring Vincent Price, another ""Legend of Horror,"" thus its inclusion here. ""The Phantom Creeps"" was a hokey 12-part cliffhanger about a mad scientist and his odd inventions. Not horror, but it does star Bela Lugosi, you see. Here, they present the drastically whittled-down TV movie that first aired in the 1950s. ""Shadow of Chinatown"" is another Lugosi serial, and yet another mad scientist crime thriller. It was simultaneously released in 1936 in the truncated form offered here.

""Manfish"" stars Lon Chaney Jr., but you wouldn't call it horror. ""Legend of Horror"" Tod Slaughter headlines in the creaky British crime film, ""Ticket of Leave Man."" It's surprising that MCE didn't pad this out even more with some of Boris Karloff's Mr. Wong whodunit programmers.

There are some genuine fright films here, but their quality is questionable. Everything has lomg been in the public domain and has long been fodder for MILL CREEK and its previous name, TREELINE. Their LEGENDS OF HORROR is a very disappointing movie pack, especially for longtime MCE collectors (like me) or anyone looking for scary movies.",1317081600,6,2211,5.551928783382789

3497827,2,B001BQJLFC,"Let's be honest!  Boris Karloff, Bela Lugosi, Vincent Price, Christopher Lee, and John Carradine were mostly remembered for their 'escapades' in terror films.  Unfortunately, the majority of the titles in this set don't fit the bill.  They are S-L-O-W moving woof-woof mysteries with a principle actor doing his best to keep a straight face while collecting his check.  Granted...""Count Dracula and His Vampire Bride"" and a couple of the others I'd probably look at again, but honestly...I doubt I could sit still watching a bunch of silent Hitchcock films from the 20s?  Or even some of his TV shows [""The Cheney Vase""] that have made the rounds in other 50 movie packages.  I've bought 2 of the earlier 50 Millcreek Film Sets. The Horror One w/Lon Chaney Sr (as The Phantom of the Opera)on the cover...along with The 50 Film Mystery Set that has been reissued at least twice with different covers.  And I've yet to watch either one completely!  I'm sure this collection is no exception? ""The Incredible Petrified World"" makes me YAWN now that I think about it.",1295395200,3,1062,4.861111111111111
3497828,3,B001BQJLFC,"At $0.33 per movie, one should not expected academy award winning acting.  This is a collection of some of the worst films ever.  Bad special effects are everywhere.  Bats on strings.  Dogs in rugs.  Classic stuff.  Some of these films are truly strange.  Others are gems.  All of them are worth watching with friends over a bowl of popcorn.  Just don't set your expectations too high and you will enjoy them greatly.",1293580800,,417,4.680555555555555

3497831,1,B001BQJLFC,"Come on Mill Creek, Alfred Hitchcock and other crime dramas as horror?  Sorry, can't spend THAT kind of cash for those, that is a whole different genre is specific interest, especially since old movie buffs generally likely have alot of this Alfred Hitchock and crime stuff already, many times over.  I mean, Alfred Hitchcock twenty movie or more collection I bought at Wal-Mart for five bucks, everyone across america has to have alfred hitchcock movies by now, I have double of so many of his early works on DVD its rediculous.

But hey, Mill Creek has ""tried"" in other fifty movie packs but I surmize it may have been some of the older movie packs from about five years ago and not the newer ones, I noticed that the 250 movie pack is also rife/liberally laden/(infested?) with alfred hitchcock and crime drama stuff in a horror 250 movie pack, way to go for a screw up!(won't buy the 250 movie pack now).",1283299200,18,908,4.592592592592593

8284251,2,B001BQJLFC,I have 8 of these old horror syfy movie packs.  All I ask is that they show as good as I remember them. They don't have to be DIGITALLLY REMASTERED or anything. That takes away the nostalgia.  Yonger people (40 and under ) don't appreciate that.  The corniness and lack of modern special effects is also part of the game for back in the day movies.  You want modern buy a newer syfy horror movie. BUT I pay 14 to 16 bucks per 50 not a PENNY more. After you buy 4 or five packs you'll get a number of repeats.  No use over paying. Sounds like this one is also not eye appealing based on reviews..... and over priced,1486512000,,614,4.083333333333333
8284252,2,B001BQJLFC,Packing is not as shown it has skulls. And movies are barely horror. Should be retitoed British suspense and Alfred Hitchcock. Not a fan of this. 50 horror classics is far better.,1484438400,,179,4.625
