8455103,1,B0053CBCI4,"Well, I had high hopes for this DVD, which is unavailable in the U.S.  While it is a ""DVD,"" the quality sure looks like a VHS transfer.  Also, this was originally a color film, but this version is washed out black and white.  Subpar all the way.  At least I have it in DVD format now.  I'm extremely disappointed with this DVD.",1430870400,2,327,4.209677419354839
