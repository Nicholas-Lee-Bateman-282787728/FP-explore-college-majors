8162063,4,630310424X,"Not too bad. I really like this movie, it's an excellent sci-fi Anime. It  had some pretty cool background music too (Sensation, ooh baby! Err..  Ahem...sorry). It had scientific application that was actually plausable,  and actually some thing I've been thinking about recently, just before I  bought it, like transmit energy and St. Elmo's fire etc. It was realistic  in it's gadgetry, but there was kind of a plot deffeciency, and not much  character developement. There was obvious romantic opportunity between  Sarah and Akira, the main characters. Aside from that and some other flaws  (the same animation sequence every time they use the gravity control  system, etc.) it was a pretty good Anime.",961372800,,703,5.150442477876106
8162064,4,630310424X,"When this movie was on Sci-Fi I watched it, and liked it; granted I only watched the ending, but with an ending THAT good, how bad could the rest of the movie be right!  I loved the end and am going to but the whole thing!",959040000,,222,3.8260869565217392
8162065,5,630310424X,"This film combines the fun and excitement of Space Battleship Yamato with other adventure animes in space. It's easy to grasp and with okay animation. However, after poking at the plot for a while you can see it  runs along the lines of a mediocre Star Trek episode, somewhat like that  movie Star Trek V: The Final Frontier. Even though the plot may seem a bit  pokey, watch it! The soundtrack is vibrant and fits the film very well, so  you'll have the best of both worlds. Watch it! I insist! =)",945820800,2,498,4.380434782608695
8162066,1,630310424X,"I recorded this movie on the sci-fi channel and also tried watching a  total of FIVE times, and fell sound asleep EVERY time...there's not much to say about it, there is no storyline, nudity, action, adventure, blood,  ABSOLUTELY NOTHING. USE THIS MOVIE ONLY AS A SEDATIVE!",945561600,,273,4.913043478260869
