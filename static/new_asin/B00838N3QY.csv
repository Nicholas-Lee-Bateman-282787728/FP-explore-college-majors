5124509,4,B00838N3QY,"The CGI in the film is photorealistic. Some scenes of dinosaur violence may not be suitable for small children.
The film's producers have taken a few liberties with the fossil record in calling the ruddy one-eyed carnivore a T-Rex.
I think that the sound track would have been better as a second person narration, or even a dramatic musical score with dinosaur sound effects.",1374192000,,375,4.875
5124510,4,B00838N3QY,"In recent years, Korea is starting to attract new audiences internationally to its animation, manwa (Korean comics) and its pop culture, may it be music, film or dramas continue to have a large following worldwide.

But one area that Korea is typically not known for worldwide is its own all-CG animated films.  In 2012, Dream Search C&C, Inc., EBS and Olive Studio, Inc.announced their animated film ""Speckles the Tarbosaurus"" which opened in theaters in Korea in January 2006.  Originally based on a three-part documentary series that aired back in 2008, the series received high ratings for Korea's EBS (Educational Broadcasting System) and so, a reworking of the film took place and in three years, a CG animated film was created.

Based on dinosaurs found in the Korean peninsula, the film is set during the early Cretaceous period of the dinosaurs and focuses on a Tarbosaurus known as Speckles.  The film is narrated by Speckles.

The Korean CG animated film using the title name ""Dino King 3D: An Amazing Adventure"" will be released on Blu-ray 3D/2D in June 2013 courtesy of Well Go USA Entertainment.

""Dino King 3D"" begins with a baby Tarbosaurus named Speckles, who was just born and as he grows up, he wants to hunt like his mother, big brother and twin sisters.  He learns how his brother is a chaser that leads the pray right towards his twin sisters and then his mother killing the prey in order to feed the family.

But despite being one of the feared carnivorous dinosaurs, there are many threats that can easily hurt young Speckles.

But one day as Speckles feels that he can hunt with the family, they are unaware that the Tyrannosaurus Rex known as ""One-Eye"" is in the area, look for a new place to live and feed.

As the family are about to hunt down a few dinosaurs, they suddenly see a large stampede of dinosaurs starting to run towards them and in the mayhem, Speckles is caught.  They learn that all are running away from One-Eye.

As Speckles family try to rescue him, all dinosaurs are seen running towards a cliff area where many of them are unable to control themselves and fall off the cliff or are hit by other dinosaurs who are unable to control and stop themselves.  Knowing they need to defend Speckles, the family does its best to fight against One-Eye but each of the siblings are killed and fall over the cliff area.  Speckles mother tries to fight back but One-Eye is too powerful and thrown over the cliff.

Speckles is now alone without a family and must fend for himself.  Speckles learns that in order to survive, he must try to hunt down his own food immediately or go after the leftovers left behind by One-Eye.

And as Speckles turns five years old, he is still too young to defend himself or fight but he has managed to live this long.  One day, he sees One-Eye going after another Tarbosaurus which he names ""Blue Eyes"" and together, both are just happy to be friends and help each other.

And as both grow up together and are 20-years-old, they become an awesome team when it comes to hunting.  Despite having left an area without One-Eye around, peace is disrupted when One-Eye goes to search for another feeding ground.  And while both Speckles and Blue Eyes became a couple during the mating season and are expecting babies, Speckles must do all he can to protect his young babies from One-Eye and other threats, especially the pesky velociraptors.

But what Speckles is not prepared for is another type of threat to the dinosaurs...nature.

Will Speckles be able to support and protect his family?

VIDEO:

""Dino King 3D: An Amazing Adventure"" is presented in 3D and 2D (both versions are on one single Blu-ray disc).  First, let's discuss the 2D of the film.  When it comes to dinosaur films, ""Dino King 3D"" looks amazing when it comes to textures and details in HD.  While the backgrounds appear to use real nature backgrounds, sometimes it features rocks that don't appear as well-detailed as the dinosaurs.  But in terms of CG animation, the textures, shading and movements of the dinosaurs are well-done.  You can see muscle structure being utilized amongst the dinosaurs and I was very pleased with how the film looked.

As for the 3D, ""Dino King 3D: An Amazing Adventure"" is more depth-based 3D and for the portrayal of space and distance, the film looks good when it comes to that aspect of 3D.  But for those hoping to see the objects coming out at you, aside from dinosaur heads and volcanic activity, the 3D for this film is more depth-based.

AUDIO:

""Dino King 3D: An Amazing Adventure"" is presented in English DTS-HD Master Audio 5.1.  It's important to note that the original Korean dialogue is NOT included with this Blu-ray release.  But the ambiance of the film is magnificent as you can hear dinosaurs, the stomping of dinosaurs on the ground via LFE and use of panning sound through the surround channels.

Narration in English is crystal clear and lossless soundtrack is not mega immersive as I would have hoped but overall, the soundtrack is very good.

SPECIAL FEATURES

There are no special features but a trailer.

EXTRAS:

""Dino King 3D: An Amazing Adventure"" comes with a lenticular slipcover.

JUDGMENT CALL:

As a father who is fascinated by dinosaurs and has a child who seems to have memorized to pronounce names of dinosaurs, ""Dino King 3D: An Amazing Adventure"" was a fascinating family film.

While we have seen animated films about displaced young characters, in the case of ""Dino King 3D"" which seemed like a kiddy film with it's initial introduction of Speckles at a young age, the film immediately becomes more serious in tone as Speckles becomes alone, having to fend for himself but then growing older and having to protect his family from being eaten or killed.

But the story is not exactly jovial as dinosaurs were in constant threat from other predators and dinosaurs hunted each other and for baby dinosaurs, they were constantly targeted.  So, this is not an animated film that tries to show hope for a family. This is not a film that ends with a Disney ending of everyone is happy, because the fact is that characters die in this film.  It may be too scary for children as these are not like Disney animated films where animals find a way to thrive and be happy.

Poor Speckles wants to protect his family but it's not easy when you have a vicious T-Rex and other dinosaurs nearby and then there is nature that adds to the problems for the dinosaurs.

But if your child is over 5-years-old, I believe the child can watch this animated film.  There is no blood, but you will see a T-Rex chomping the necks of other dinosaurs or other dinosaurs being killed someway, somehow.

We see how volcano's led to the death of many dinosaurs (in this case, in a region of Korea) which destroyed their water and habitat and forced other dinosaurs to travel long distances to find a new home.

While I have watched dinosaur documentaries such as BBC's excellent ""Walking with Dinosaurs"", ""Dino King 3D"" is fascinating because its inclusion of many dinosaurs and getting that narration through Speckles of various dinosaurs that lived during that era in the land which eventually would become Korea.

I have since learned that many fossilized dinosaurs were found across the South Korean coast and many fossilized dinosaur eggs and footprints from the Cretaceous period of the Mesozoic era were found in the seacoast of South Korea.  Which the animated film does go into how many dinosaurs were possibly led to the coast near the ocean area.  With dinosaur museums in various areas of South Korea, there also seems to be fossils instead of eggs or footprints now being found in the era which have been important in filling the missing 20-million-year gap in the fossil record in regards to the origin of dinosaurs in Asia and their first appearance in North America.

The film is educational when it comes to knowing the names of dinosaurs.  I never heard of Tarbosaurus and didn't know that it looks similar to a T-Rex.  After doing research, I've learned that the Tarbosaurus is the Asian version of a T-Rex and they are close cousins.  Both were killer dinosaurs, had powerful jaws and teeth, big back legs and tiny arms, while Tarbosaurus had smaller arms than a T-Rex.  But Tarbosaurus were found in rock formations in Mongolia, while T-Rex were generally found in North America.

Both were the top of the food chain but very interesting to see both featured prominently in the film.

What is also interesting is the portrayal of a Velociraptor.  Like most people, my knowledge of the dinosaur was through the ""Jurassic Park"" films.  But since then, I have read that these dinosaurs look like big chickens and are small.  The animated film does portray them that way, with feathers.  But also to read that Velociraptors were mound in Mongolia, not North America.  There is one thing that this film does show and not really known as fact and debated today is if Velociraptor hunt in packs.  This film does show that, as carnivorous creatures going after the sick and dead.

But there are other dinosaurs that are mentioned that I have never heard about, so it was good to learn about them through this animated film.

As for the Blu-ray release, the animation and textures of the dinosaurs are fantastic!  Backgrounds were OK and the film could have been much more immersive.  While the 2D version of the film looked great, the 3D was OK and more depth-based than anything.  Unfortunately, there are no special features and it's a shame because if the 2008 three-part documentary was included, it would have made ""Dino King 3D"" a magnificent release.

Overall, ""Dino King 3D: An Amazing Adventure"" is an exciting and enjoyable dinosaur family film and also one that probably is the better looking CG-animated film about dinosaurs at this current time.  Me and my 10-year-old son absolutely enjoyed this film but at the same time, I know this Blu-ray release could have been better.

""Dino King 3D: An Amazing Adventure"" is a CG animated film about dinosaurs worth watching!",1372896000,13,10063,4.7495682210708114
5124511,1,B00838N3QY,This movie was very Bad. This is one of the worst movies that I ever seen. Don't see this movie very bad.,1372723200,2,105,3.8181818181818183
5124512,5,B00838N3QY,"Dino King tells the story of the life of Speckles, a tarbosaur who's whole family is killed by One-Eye(a vicious T-Rex).

I have to admit the English narrative over this story is horrendous. I, too, would have preferred the original Korean vocal narrative with subtitles over the English narrative, anyday.  However, every other aspect of this Korean film is top-notch. I loved it and watched it several times over..it's THAT good! Up until now, Disney's Dinosaur and the Jurassic Park series were always my favorite Dino films. I think what I liked most about it was the story. Despite the fact it was geared more towards the younger set, it was the story that kept me watching. It was almost like I was watching it as it was happening.

I'm sure there are other reviewers who've touched on this. Even though this is geared more towards kids, there are moments in the film where adult supervision & guidance is needed. Why? There are several scenes of intense fighting between the Dinosaurs that end with them spilling blood. As someone pointed out in their review, because this film borrows elements from nature films, nature can be brutal, sometimes, even to the young. So, give this film a viewing before letting younger children give it a look.

Overall, I loved this film and I more than highly recommend this one to everyone. If you love Dinosaur movies or just love a good story, give Dino King a look.",1372636800,13,1410,4.719512195121951
5124513,3,B00838N3QY,"If you enjoy films like ""Dinosaur"" and ""Jurassic Park"" or any other dinosaur mayhem film, you will enjoy ""Dino King 3D"". But be prepared, the English narrative track is SOOOOOO ANNOYING!!! It was very hard to tolerate the English voices. It was like watching 2 hours of Teletubbies or Davey and Goliath (and I like Davey and Goliath). Seriously, the English narrative is that bad. The blu-ray looks and sounds fantastic with some very detailed dinosaurs but there are several background areas that look washed out, soft and flat. One thing you may like is the sound of the young Tarbosauruses; they sound very cute. But ole ""One Eye"" steals the show hands down. He is cunning, terrifying and mean. There are some areas where the animation is a bit stiff but nothing distracting. The underwater scenes are breath-taking. I might look for the original South Korean blu-ray. I would rather have the narrative track be in Korean with English subtitles than the annoying English narrative that accompanies this domestic blu-ray version. This blu-ray comes with a nice 3D lenticular slip cover. Overall, a nice blu-ray release.",1372291200,2,1121,5.0
5124514,4,B00838N3QY,"As has been said this film borrows plot and many scenes from a couple of Disney films.  However the animation is top notch and you will see several species of dinosaur only glimpsed in documentaries.  The real problem for me was the intrusive narration by the lead dino ""Speckles"".  Neither the script or the actors narrating the various ages of the character match the stunning quality of the images on the screen.  With that qualification I still recommend the film.",1372204800,,468,4.8125
5124515,4,B00838N3QY,"Dino King (whose original title I think is ""Speckles the Tarbosaurus"") blatantly borrows heavily from: 1. Disney's Lion King, 2. Disney's Dinosaur, and 3. nature films. Don't misunderstand me when I say it borrows from D's Dinosaur just because it's a dinosaur movie-no, there are shots almost exactly like those in D's Dinosaur. But just because of that, don't think you've seen anything like this before. That combination provides enough escapism for 90 minutes.

Just keep in mind that this is a kid's movie-in our family opinion, but younger kids will need some parental guidance... so watch it with them, and remember that this borrows from nature films, and nature can be brutal even to the young. So the 'bad' dino isn't being bad, he's acting by instinct.

I'd actually prefer the option of the original korean track without the english narration, but I don't think my kids minded it as much as I did. I also would have liked SOME bonus features.",1372118400,,954,4.846625766871166

Speckles, the hero of the story watches from a young age as 'one eye' throws his mother, sisters, and brother off a cliff. Speckles then runs off, eventually finds a mate. 'One eye' is having none of this, throws speckles off a cliff and attempts to rape 'blue eyes', Speckle's mate. Speckles saves the day, they have a few dino babies however 'Blue eyes' ends up dying. Speckles goes to down when there's veliciraptors, squishing them to death in a quasi-cartoon way. Eventually Speckles and his kids once again face off against 'one eye'. ""One eye' throws Speckle's two kids off a cliff into water, Speckles manages to save one of his kids. It's happy ever after..if you ignore the fact that Speckle has witnessed almost every person he loves being thrown off a cliff.

If this plot were adult oriented and had Romans instead of dinosaurs, it would make for a decent Gladiator knockoff. However, this movie might be too brutal for some kids to watch.",1445299200,,1046,4.715846994535519

They're classics danget! HOWEVER......SPOILER ALERT!!!! This is horrible! Please note: I am fully aware that `tis the circle of life' and these things actually did/do happen in nature...however, for little kids to watch scenes where this young child dinosaur watches his family get brutally killed in front of him (blood and everything). Then he's on his own trying to survive, almost starving to death. He eventually finds a mate - who is almost raped (which I know they're dinosaurs and kids wouldn't necessarily understand what's going on....but STILL!). They then have kids...which eventually also get killed along with his wife/mate. And then there's this long drawn out cene at the end where Speckles (main character) is swimming to save his last surviving son who was tossed off the cliff into the ocean by One Eye (the bad t-rex). They're both on the verge of drowning and.....uhhh...terrible. Now my boys wanna watch the ""the dinosaur kills his mom"" movie. I realize now I should have WATCHED it before I let them see it. It was one of those where I put it on for them while I was cleaning and didn't realize how horrible it was.

5124561,3,B00838N3QY,"3D REVIEW of Dino King:
Story aside, I bought this for the 3D and dinosaurs. The 3D dinosaurs themselves were rendered in 3D, and look outstanding in 3D for certain shots, but other shots, in fact all of the background in almost every scene, was converted into 3D, and it's a fairly subtle effect at best for the background. The 3D in general, is a mixed bag, so if you can accept some great 3D with plenty of poorly realized 3D with mixed elements, it's worth a look for this original dinosaur movie for kids, made by a Japanese studio from what the credits showed.
3D Dimension: Mixed results. Some close ups look outstanding in 3D, while scenery shots look weak.
3D Pop Outs: Some characters' faces pop out dramatically. But not many pop outs till the end with some fire ember effects.

Movie Review Summary:
Dino King is a brave movie in that it isn't afraid to show some blood and violence as it no doubt was in the Dinosaur Days, where carnivores like T Rex would indeed gouge his teeth into his prey. When it's not gory at all, there is residual blood. That aside, it is similar to Walking with Dinosaurs in that the story is fairly basic, dinosaurs herding to get to better land while avoiding the predators and T Rex, as the hero dino grows up. I liked the movie, though would have revised the script and dialog as it's a bit too silly for the dramatic, mildly violent dinosaur action. Maybe that was their intention, to keep the dialog light, as he talks about his Mom hunting for prey and eating them. Props to the film otherwise, as it has a vision of what life may have been like for a carnivore Dinosaur.",1426896000,,1618,4.411371237458194

The story  is basically an exploration of what a Tarbosarus's life might have been like at the end of the Cretaceous Period. However, while it is based on palentological theories & facts, it is more entertaining than educational. (For example, T. Rex and Tarbosaurus never lived in the same area. They are both of the Tyranasaurus Family, but T. Rex was found in North America & Tarbosaurus was found in Korea) I would recommend this as a good movie for the whole family.",1395792000,,588,4.6

I do recommend it..the 3D is very good...very,very nice colors and likeable creatures(the voice was a little annoying,but  hey,I don't wanna be to tough on this movie).be aware when you show it to the kids that its not a  Ice Age Dino movie. Plenty of deaths and killings. Am I the only one who felt CONSTANTLY sorry for the little fella??

5124585,3,B00838N3QY,"The Koreans beat the American's (and/or British) ""Walking With Dinosaurs"" theatrical offering by, what, over a year?  If you've seen ""Walking With Dinosaurs"" (the movie) then you've already seen ""Dino King"" but with better effects and voice acting.

""Dino King"" is a Korean CGI offering with animated effects that are overall good and mostly quite effective.  It is the story of a young Tarbosaurus (think tyrannosaurus but with large frilled brows) named Speckles who has an annoying little kid's voice throughout most of the film.  His life was great until another rogue (and quite canny, it would have excelled at playing dinosaur chess) Tyrannosaurus knocks off his family, the carnivorous brute.  How dare he act like a dinosaur in a kid's movie?  Well, Speckles grows up and takes a wife and ends up fighting and overcoming the relentless One-Eye T-rex.  Uh, sorry, I should have given you a spoiler alert.

Despite my cheeky review the movie is quite well done overall especially as it comes from a developing film market.  If you can't get enough talking dinosaurs in your life or you can't wait until ""Walking With Dinosaurs"" comes out on DVD then this movie will fill your Triassic heart-shaped hole, and you could do a lot worse.  3.5 stars.",1391904000,,1252,4.919047619047619

5124587,5,B00838N3QY,"I read a spate of so-so to negative reviews, and I'm curious what film those people saw.

This is a pretty good CGI film regarding a family of dinosaurs who suffer one tragedy after another, but how the main character comes out on top at the end.

To me it was very refreshing to see a film from overseas that had quality animation to it, strove to be historically accurate, and didn't spare us too much of the known behaviors and violence during dinosaur times, and seems to be family friendly all at once.

What is not to like?

Buy it and give it a whirl.",1387670400,,558,4.235849056603773
5124588,3,B00838N3QY,"The graphics are great.  The narrative is annoying. Especially with the Baby Tarbosaur early in the movie.  While it looks to be a kid movie, the violent, throat chomping scenes can be a bit too intense for kids.  It also seems like it can't decide whether it wants to be a National Geographic special providing interesting information on dinosaurs or an animated anthropomorphic Pixar story.  With little pea sized brains, would a T-Rex be able to scheme dropping a boulder on the tail of an ankylosaur?  Nevermind, the long odds of the plan actually working.  And the T-Rex seems to go around killing but not eating.  When there are numerous injured dinosaurs lying around the ground, the T-Rex (and later Velociraptors) ignore them to attack the Tarbosaur family members.  Why? Other than for dramatic story-telling.  Since only the protagonist speaks, we have no idea what is motivating the other dinosaurs.  And after his traumatic childhood, why would the protagonist ever let his young anywhere near a cliff's edge?  Given the frequency of dinosaurs falling off cliff's edge in this movie, we may have a competing theory for how the dinosaurs became extinct.",1385164800,9,1165,5.015625
5124589,3,B00838N3QY,"It is a good thing I got this movie using points from my credit card, because otherwise I probably would had regretted the purchase. The computer animation looks good, but this is a story that probably would had been understood just as well without any voices.

The main character narrates the story, and the voice as a child is rather grating. Plus, it sounds rather out of place when he refers to other dinosaurs as ""That is an [insert real scientific name of dinosaur]!"" Names for dinosaur species is something us humans created, millions of years after these creatures were dead. Maybe it's just me... but it just doesn't seem to click.

I wonder if the original Korean version is also narrated like this. If not, then we're the unlucky ones.",1382745600,3,746,4.687022900763359
5124590,4,B00838N3QY,"While the English narrative is awkward and annoying at times, and the animation can be clunky, the story is as solid and touching as The Land Before Time and has more drama and death-of-family-members than The Lion King. By the end of it I was rooting for Speckles and yelling at my TV screen. It was intense. And I'll admit it: I cried at several dinosaur deaths. It was depressing all the bad things that happened to Speckles(Dude deserved a more badass name than 'Speckles'). It was rough. But, in the end, all in all, DINO KING was 'an amazing adventure.'",1381968000,,559,4.544554455445544

5124592,5,B00838N3QY,"Most dinosaur films feature about 10% or less screen time of dino viewing. They usually have a plot where humans have
cloned dinosaurs or discovered them surviving in some lost pocket of the world,(or distant planet). This film wisely omits inclusion of those creatures known as humans. We see dinosaurs as they were . Unlike the Disney  film from 2000,these dinosaurs do not talk. Dialog is supplied in the background as if the dinosaur had written a memoir in the astral plane. The dinosaur's time line leaps forward in 10 year intervals. These are some of the best dinosaurs to appear on screen, with no disrespect to Willis Obrien and Ray Harryhausen. Dinosaurs are on screen 100% of the time. If you like watching dinosaurs, this is the one.",1379462400,,746,4.782945736434108
5124593,4,B00838N3QY,"The movie is quite different, great to watch but I will be little bit concerned when it counts for kids age. This movie is ""Not Rated"" as of yet. The storyline is great, take you from start point to the end of a Dino that we are coming to know. The movie is geared more towards the younger generation, it's fairly intense and violent action scenes though the movie, some of the younger kids might have trouble going to sleep after viewing a few of those scenes. Of course, that is how brutal nature is and how vicious some dinosaurs were.

I'm a big fan of Dinosaur movies, I do prefer ""Dinosaur"" movie been made in 2000 for kids than this one if you would like to compare the action, storyline as an essence. There are similarity in storyline but more of scientific aspects of the animals, plants, and era of time we are in current.",1379203200,,833,4.339743589743589
5124594,4,B00838N3QY,"This 3d film was made for the youngsters. It has puppets and computer animation mixed together.  And it works, just like ""walking with dinosaurs' did years ago. Although this is strictly a kids movie , it does feature dinosaurs killing each other. We follow a small tarbosaur , the dominant meat eaters millions of years before t-rex. T-rex would be the next  line of this family tree and are probably descended from the tarbosaurs.  It's 80 million years in the past , and little speckles fight to survive. He narrates to us , and even tells us the type of dinosaurs we see , using their modern names.  So it's informative to kids in that regard. But basically it's like a live action , well live puppet/cgi dinosaur Disney type of movie.  Adults who like kids movies will like this one. But it's not a adult movie about dinosaurs.. The 3d looks outstanding here , with no scenes  doubling on you. like some badly mastered blu rays out there do. you get lots of depth with the 3d here and that's what 3d is mainly. DEPTH, Not things coming out of the screen at you. It's a good one for those with small kids or those who like kids movies.",1377561600,,1139,4.4
5124595,1,B00838N3QY,"If I could put it into one word, its terrible. I am a huge fan of dinosaurs, and I know a lot about them. But this movie has made almost two many mistakes to count! The narrating is crap, and sounds disgustingly horrible. At first, its like a 5 year old, then it jumps 6 years later and he sounds like a teenager. And speckles the Tarbosaurus!? Yes, I know he's called speckles cause he has speckles on his face. But come on people, be more creative, Its a dinosaurs for Pete's sake! In the beginning I thought it was a kid movie, but it has murderous scenes. His family gets murdered when he is a stupid, or should I say intelligent-talking baby, who does that?! The bad guy is a T-Rex, I have two things against this. #1 A Tyrannosaurus Rex lives in what is now Western North America, not Asia! I know some specimens have been found in Asia, but there just Tarbosaurus fragments, there close relatives people! It could be a Tarbosaurus! Did any of these Asian paleontologists get that through their thick skulls! #2 Why the heck is the Tyrannosaurus the bad guy, its like they are making fun of America, saying its bad. This movie I'm guessing was originally intended for kids but then I guess the director thought it should have a T-Rex go on a killing spree. Its really bad, not just bad, but so bad it should be incinerated into microscopic pieces and crapped on by King Kong and eaten and barfed up by Godzilla. That is how bad it is.",1376611200,6,1440,4.356877323420075

In brief, the story revolves around a dinosaur by the name of Speckles (probably not spelled correctly). Lot's of a stuff happens, not going to spoil it, but most of it is *not* suitable for a younger audience. Then again, if your kids love dinosaurs and you as a parent don't mind exposing the gritty reality of life back then, by all means. They'll all come out loving this.

8524382,3,B00838N3QY,"I wish I could go back in time and stop my husband from showing this film to our kid. I have really complicated feelings about this movie. I love dinosaurs, my husband loves dinosaurs, and so does our two and a half year old son. My son has been obsessed with dinosaurs since he was about 1 and 1/2 years old. We have literally consumed pretty much all dinosaur media there is. Documentaries, dinosaur movies like Jurassic Park, cartoons, you name it. Occasionally I do draw the line at some films because they weren't really about the dinos, just human gore.

If it were up to my son, this film would be five stars. It's actually one of his favorite movies on the planet. He is in love with Tyrannosaurs, so when One Eye was presented in this film as the T-Rex, he automatically latched on to him as his favorite despite being the bad guy.

As a parent, I have several problems with this film. It is marketed towards children. However, the overly intense and drawn out, dramatic death scenes  (the main character's entire family is killed off intentionally by One Eye) are a bit much for a kid still understanding what death means. The scene where the mother gets pushed off the cliff as the main character cries out for his mother as a baby and we watch her slowly descend to her death while highly dramatic music plays. This scene just keeps going and going and the sadness is just really intense for children. Not that I mind my son eventually being exposed to these things, as he is a Land Before Time fan in which the mother has a death scene as well, but this scene was really intense. Then as the main character continues to grow up, One Eye continues to find him and try to ruin his life. At one point, the main character's mate is actually pregnant when One Eye shows up again and tries to mate with her against her will (yes I understand the animal kingdom, but why is an attempted rape scene in a dino film for kids that is verbally acknowledged? Lol come on!), the main character has to fight One Eye off again just as the female is giving up. So that was a little disturbing.

How about when we watch one of the main dino's kids get smashed by a boulder, and when One Eye throws one of the babies off a cliff, we see the baby get slammed into a cliff wall and then fall into the water and disappear into the water?  Let's not forget the death of the mate which is the result of an injury on her leg, but the main character attempts to fight off a pack of veliciraptors until she's actually dead and then he and the surviving babies try to run off. It leaves us with the image of him looking back at his mate while velociraptors run toward her and him apologizing to his dead mate after tons of very dramatic scenes in music is involved. Well kids, there goes your mom's dead carcass. Body desecration seems like something for adults or teens. At least in Land Before Time, they spare the details of Little Foots mom's dead body. Seriously I'm an atheist and have a background in anthropology and medicine, so while death and decay are not something I have a problem with, you might want to reconsider exposing to a younger child.

This film is like One Eye for me. It keeps coming back to haunt me in various forms. Now, I'm forced to purchase it because Netflix and dropped it in February and my son misses this film dearly. I'm writing this review in hopes that someone who's looking for more dinosaur movies for their young child reads this and steers clear of it entirely before their kid gets hooked into it before they're old enough to appreciate the adult themes in this film once they're ready for such concepts. Or at the very least, go to YouTube and look it up and watch before showing it to your younger child. Not much surprises me these days with parents, but I have to believe that the parents giving this movie two thumbs up for their preschoolers are either daft or haven't actually sat down and watched the movie with their undivided attention as many of us struggle to do these days. Because originally this is a foreign film, it may be that this kind of content is considered more appropriate there or perhaps this wasn't intended for a more immature audience that tends to gravitate towards this sort of media.

Regardless, I fully expect this to be a film that one day my son asks me why the hell I let him watch it at 2 years old. ",1520640000,,4368,4.370689655172414
