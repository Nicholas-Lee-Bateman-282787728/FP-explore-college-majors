2341982,4,B0009YU93U,"Huh, where did this anti-Romanian bias come from? Well, it was a German officer in wartime era who delivered that backhanded compliment to our man Tartu, so maybe not much credence should be given to that show of casual dismissal. Robert Donat, most people know him for his unforgettable performance in Goodbye, Mr. Chips (1939), for which he won an Academy Award for Best Actor. But, me, I celebrate him more for his action hero roles in The Count of Monte Cristo (1934), Hitchcock's The 39 Steps (1935), and in a farfetched yet enthralling1943 espionage thriller titled Sabotage Agent (a.k.a. The Adventures of Tartu).

Robert Donat had range, man. He was incredibly moving as the gentle educator Mr. Chips. He showcased his sharp comedic chops in Vacation From Marriage (1945). And in his thrillers, he proved that he could play the dashing, intrepid man of action. Sabotage Agent's plotline is pure potboiler yet made exceedingly watchable courtesy, primarily, of Donat's lively participation.

The movie opens with demolition expert, British Capt. Terence Stevenson (Donat), attempting to disarm a bomb in the wreckage of a London hospital even as a nurse and her child patient look on. As if that weren't badass enough, we're informed that the captain holds a degree in chemical engineering and is fluent in German and Romanian. So it's no surprise when, soon after, he's recruited for perilous spy work. His mission is twofold: to steal the formula for a new sort of poison gas - a fog gas - being developed by the Nazis in a Czechoslovakian chemical plant and then to cripple that same chemical plant.

In enemy territory, he poses as Capt. Jan Tartu, a chemist and an officer of the despotic Romanian Iron Guard, never mind that the real Tartu's been dead for some months now. There's a whiff of The Scarlet Pimpernel in our Tartu's act as he lets everyone believe that he's a feckless fop. And when Tartu sets eyes on the beauteous, haughty Mar&uacute;schka (Valerie Hobson), well, he lets on that he's a womanizing goat, as well. Too bad Mar&uacute;schka seems to only fraternize with high-ranking German officers and shows nothing but disdain for everyone else.

The acting is fine across the board. Hobson makes for an imperious, elegant leading lady. A very young Glynnis Johns stands out as a zealous Czech patriot. But it's Donat's movie to carry. He exhibits real zest in this role, and it's this enthusiasm and energy that propel the narrative. Not that I want to give the story short shrift. We're treated to a series of suspenseful moments, many of those with Tartu on the verge of being found out. But then Tartu's quick wits and resourcefulness and ballsy nerve somehow see him thru each narrow scrape. If you'd only ever seen Donat as the meek Mr. Chips, you're in for a jaw drop when you observe his physicality in this movie's third act as he cooly orchestrates a daring escape and final getaway. Donat didn't make a lot of movies, so each of them seems all the more precious. Sabotage Agent ranks just a wee bit below his very best efforts - one tier below the all-time classics Goodbye, Mr. Chips and The 39 Steps. But it's in good company. It rubs elbows with the likes of The Count of Monte Cristo, Vacation from Marriage, and The Citadel (1938). It means that Sabotage Agent is really good.",1444521600,,3320,4.788830715532286

This film holds up today because the action and suspense don't come to a grinding halt for a political message.

It is exciting to see a captured Ju-88 used for the escape at the end.  The Me-110 is also correct for the period.  Model work is decent for it's day.",1426636800,,587,4.462264150943396

extent that we actually forget we are watching a film.  We could say that he is actually playing two parts: the British
soldier asked to penetrate into the Gestapo war machinery and then, the Hungarian ""ladies-man""  spy, Tartu, who
cleverly weaves his net of sabotage over the German gas producing plant.  Another great victory for the Allied
forces.  Cannot recommend this film enough - should appeal to all tastes and ages. And let us not forget to
applaud the supporting cast members, all who do a marvelous job.",1405987200,4,631,4.805555555555555

2342017,4,B0009YU93U,"The Adventures of Tartu, 1943 film

It starts in 1940 London during an air raid. A hospital was bombed. A delayed action bomb is located within a hospital! An officer removes the fuse, the plug, and the detonator. ""All over."" Captain Stevenson was born and raised in Romania and knows the language. The British know of a German plan to produce poison gas in Pilsen; they must try to stop it. Stevenson is dropped by parachute near Bucharest, near the oil fields. A password introduces him to the manager. He will take the identity of a wanted man! Going from Romania to Hungary to Czechoslovakia, he contacts the German Consul. A letter introduces him. Was the telephone line tapped? First he needs to get a shoe repaired. Will something go wrong? Tartu will observe operations in a munitions factory. He needs a room with a private entrance. One roomer is the girlfriend of the Commandant.

Tartu visits the munitions factory. A young woman is arrested for sabotage. ""She will be shot."" Work resumes. Someone shot a German officer, who is she? ""In times like these you never know who your friends are."" Tartu has a request. Later he visits Marushka in her room. They dine out and talk. Tartu has a request to meet other people. Then her boyfriend shows up. We learn more about Marushka. Tartu explains his actions on the factory floor. Another woman will be shot for attempted sabotage. Marushka goes to see her doctor (and his friends). They learn about Tartu and tell Marushka. She confides in the mother of the executed girl. Then she tells Otto about her suspicion of Tartu, and they set a trap. But something happens to interrupt them. Tartu is brought to the secret chemical factory. The poison gas is the result of two separate liquids. Tartu's work pleases the top manager.

They need one more test before the poison gas can be dropped over England. Tartu wants to meet Marushka to send a message. Tartu visits a restaurant, drinks, and talks too much. Or is this an act? Men follow to capture him! Tartu explains his actions and asks for help. Is this a mistake? He is given a chance to write a letter first. The chairman of the council arrives just in time! Tartu is given small powerful bombs to place in the poison gas factory. He sneaks them inside. But an investigation reveals the truth! Will the warning message be delayed? The break in the telephone line is reported. Marushka tells Tartu the news, but he can't leave now. The Air Raid warning sounds. ""Get Tartu!"" But he plants his bombs. Can he get away? There are loud explosions on some cliffs. Will Tartu and Marushka get away in an airplane? Yes, if they can reach that cloud. There will be a happy ending.

This seems to be a typical wartime propaganda film. We know the Germans produced poison gas but did not use them for bombs for fear the British would retaliate. They mention Romania (oil production) only for background effect. ""The Man Called Intrepid"" will tell you more about the real Stevenson. It is a good story of intrigue even if some scenes seem unbelievable (overly complex?). It reminds us of the harshness of Nazi rule in occupied Europe. No mention of shortages and rationing, as elsewhere.",1372377600,,3184,4.670231729055258
2342018,4,B0009YU93U,"Made in the UK and released in 1943 (not 2006, as indicated on Amazon), this is an interesting, but formulaic war-time film.

2342020,2,B0009YU93U,"The film, Adventures Of Tartu, is a one of the best WW II British propoganda films.  Robert Donet is one of the finest actors of that era.  However, the video and audio transfer of the film by Alpha Home Entertainment Studio is terible.  The video is dark and the audio is way out of sync (so badly it is unwatchable).  I did not return the copy of that DVD because it would have cost more to return it then to keep it.  I then ordered another copy of the film (from another source) manufactured by Terra Studio (which is also available from Amazon).  The Terra Studios copy was of much better quality and is well worth watching.  Be careful of the source.  It would be nice if Amazon would post Studio specific reviews for DVDs rather then compiling multiple manufactures reviews into all like DVD titles.",1346544000,39,806,4.472602739726027
2342021,4,B0009YU93U,"ADVENTURES OF TARTU or SABOTAGE AGENT has the same appeal, despite title spelling differences.  This has decent video-quality, but not perfect - pretty typical for this age of film when no remasterings are offered.",1338768000,3,214,5.294117647058823
2342022,5,B0009YU93U,"I cannot speak to the picture or sound quality of the DVD, because I saw this movie on Hulu.

During World-War-2; Tartu is a British agent who goes on a mission to German-occupied, Czechoslovakia, to blow-up a German chemical factory. Tartu convinces the Germans he is an SS-officer of the Germany's Romanian allies; but at the same time convinces the Czech resistance too; in spite of his telling the Czech-underground he is a British-agent. So, the Czechs are gunning for him, and some German officers are suspicious.

This is good film, because it is realistic. Good acting; good sets; no skimping on the budget; no cutting corners; good story.

Look for a young, Glynis Johns, who played the mother in ""Mary Poppins"" who is in this film.",1309132800,19,741,4.818897637795276
2342023,5,B0009YU93U,"This is an extremely worthwhile video for viewing for multiple reasons.  The performances are top flight. The history portrayed, the costuming, and the sets give one some idea of the real events of the time.  The movie was made in England in World War II and gave the audience both comedy relief and a sense of the real seriousness of the Nazi presence.  Robert Donat had the right mix of talent and looks and it is a pity his health prevented him from making more movies before his untimely death.  Glynis Johns went on to have a fine career after the war.  I recommend this movie to anyone who has not seen it before and as a valuble addition to any collector's library.",1300320000,5,672,4.430894308943089
2342024,4,B0009YU93U,"I like the movie, and Robert Donat does a great job as usual, but the audio is not that good. At least it is the full version of the movie, as there are others out there that are cut. If you like Donat, I would still get it despite the sound quality.",1258761600,7,250,3.826923076923077
2342025,5,B0009YU93U,"Donat is so brilliant as Jan Tartu, you keep forgetting he's not.  Watching this movie in the 21st century, one doesn't understand that Donat's performance played off the stereotype of a primping Romanian officer-- something out of a late 19th century operetta--that audiences would recognize and enjoy when watching this in the Forties.  It was a bravura turn, very much part of Donat's extensive repertoire.

What fascinates almost 70 years later, is how well his performance is supported and integrated into this stellar cast.  This movie would only be slightly credible were the cast less than first rate: a British explosive expert dropped into Czechoslovakia during WW II where he is to pose as a flunky Romanian chemist, link up with the underground, get a job at a secret weapons plant and destroy it.  Could that happen?  Yet we are locked in, every step of the way, during reversals, tense identity scans, romance snatched on the fly and a horrendous climax.

It is one of the films I remembered from my first screening, on TV in the 50s, and still await a digital remastering.  It's a terrific movie and deserves a better summation than the other review on this page.",1258588800,11,1178,4.855
2342026,1,B0009YU93U,"Frequently, when buying either rare Public Domain films or those that simply haven't had (and likely won't) DVD release, one takes one's chances, and often--though not always!--you ""gets what you pays for."" This DVD is a case in point.

Let's begin at the beginning: It isn't there! Opening titles, yes, but after that AT LEAST THE FIRST FIVE (5!) MINUTES OF THE FILM ARE MISSING! I have a tape from TNT Overnight several years ago which is how I know.

The sound is simply atrocious as if recorded underwater, and I've seen late 1940s TV kinescopes that look better than the print (what there is of it) used for this DVD.

TCM does have a print which I missed when they first showed it. Hopefully, they'll repeat it at some point. Donat made so few films that this exciting WWII drama is very worth having for his virtuoso performance, ably accompanied by the underappreciated Valerie Hobson and undervalued Glynis Johns.

Amazon, take note of ""Synergy Archive Series!"" If this is an example of their fare, you guys shouldn't bother with it.

As for any other prospective customers: Don't go NEAR it!",1194566400,57,1101,4.7434554973821985

The Nazis were building poison gas during World War II and the English wanted Donat to destroy the plant.

Donat meets a girl and the two fall in love. He faces several adventures when, among other things, the girl begins to believe that he is a member of the Gestapo.
