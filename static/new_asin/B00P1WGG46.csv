6781162,5,B00P1WGG46,"The Blu-ray and DVD of ""The Disappearance of Eleanor Rigby"" will contain the director's intended two-part ""Him/Her"" version in addition to the Weinstein Company's ""Them"" edit. I haven't seen the abridged cut, but the director's cut is among my favorite films from 2014 and I swear you'll be in good hands if you watch it.

6781163,4,B00P1WGG46,"The Disappearance of Eleanor Rigby: Them (2014 release; 123 min.) brings the story of Conor and Eleanors dissolving marriage. As the movie opens, we see them having dinner in a nice restaurant, only to take off without paying and having a great laugh that leads to more. The very next scene, we see Eleanor on a New York bridge, then shocking us by plunging into the Hudson in apparent suicide attempt. Eleanor survives, and upon release from the hospital moves in with her well-off parents, cutting off all contact with Conor (hence the disappearance). What drove Eleanor to attempt suicide? And why is she avoiding Conor? Can their relationship somehow be mended, hence saving the marriage? To tell you more would spoil your viewing experience, youll just have to see for yourself how it all plays out.

Couple of comments: first, this movie is actually the third version of the movie. Last Fall, upon its premiere at the Toronto International Film Festival, it was show as two movies, Him and Her, showing the same events from Conors perspective and from Eleanors perspective. The US distributor (Weinstein) suggested to writer-director Neil Benson to compile both versions into one movie, hence called Them. Second, this is the feature length debut for writer-director Neil Benson, and while certainly the theme of a crumbling marriage has been dissected many times before, it still feels like this is a worthy addition. If you wonder where Benson might have gotten some influences from, look no further than French director Claude Lelouch, whose 1966 masterpiece, A Man and A Woman, is featured prominently in a movie poster in Eleanors bedroom at her parents. Third, unfortunately, the way the movie is put together/edited in Them leaves me with conflicted feelings. Sure, there are moments that it really clicks, but in the end the movie feels uneven and, more importantly, incomplete. There are certain moments that to me came as a complete surprise and didn't seem to make sense. It makes me wonder, what did I miss? Cant help but wonder that Them is not a movie that was meant to be seen this way. In contrast, Him and Her are. You can think of Them as a greatest hits album that leaves out the deep album cuts which reveal the complete picture of a band. Fourth, there are some remarkable acting performances in this movie. With all due respect for James McAvoy (best known for the X-Men franchise), who plays Conor, but Jessica Chastain (in the role of Eleanor) completely outplays him (and truth be told, Them showcases Chastain far more than McAvoy). When I noticed that Eleanors parents are played by William Hurt and Isabelle Huppert (yes, the legendary French actress), I almost fell out of my theatre chair. A shame that Huppert hasn't done more movies in the US over the years. But enjoy her in this one! Last but not least, there are some interesting music tidbits in the movie. Such as: what is the connection of Eleanor Rigby to the Beatles in this movie? Just watch! And there are a couple of great music placements in the movie, none more so than OMDs So In Love, which plays at a pivotal moment.

The Disappearance of Eleanor Rigby: Him and The Disappearance of Eleanor Rigby: Her is supposed to get a very limited theater release in the near future, and I really want to see these at some point, as I feel like The Disappearance of Eleanor Rigby: Them is not giving me the complete picture of what happened between these characters. Them played briefly in September at my local art-house theatre here in Cincinnati. The weekday evening screening I saw this at was very well attended, so Im not sure why it didn't play longer. Despite its shortcomings, Id still recommend you check out Them if you have a chance to see it, in particular if the odds of catching Him and Her are not good.",1417737600,8,3811,4.755287009063444

6781165,4,B00P1WGG46,"A dual-perspective examination of romance, grief, and their painful aftermaths, The Disappearance of Eleanor Rigby: Them began its complicated cinematic life as two films, one subtitled ""Him"" and the other ""Her.""  The two-hour version of writer and director Ned Benson's ambitious project receiving a theatrical release first, however, represents a blend of the two.  Several people who saw the separate versions at film festivals resent this perceived undermining of the experiment in subjectivity, but, in my opinion, the final product is a cogent and poignant, if modest picture.  It is long on subtle gestures of authenticity and insight, and they outweigh the few heavy-handed moments.  At the end of the day, two hours are relatively ample, and while I am intrigued to see ""Him"" and ""Her"" in the future, this first-time viewer never found the film as it exists now--intended to function as a type of intimate autopsy of a relationship in a downward spiral--rushed or unfocused.

James McAvoy and Jessica Chastain star as Conor and Eleanor, respectively.  Named after the Beatles' elderly recluse, she has returned home to her parents' house after a failed suicide bid, and he is a restaurateur in dire financial straits.  Both are, to say the least, adrift and requiring a rebound.  They are still wed, but estranged after a tragedy the film (wrongly) treats as a mystery.  This type of film is often a gift to its stars, and it is no surprise both photogenic headliners shine, perfectly capturing numerous variations on anger, confusion, longing, and despondency both together and apart. Celebrated peripheral players abound, too, including William Hurt, delivering a downright devastating monologue near the end as Eleanor's father, and a scene-stealing Viola Davis as a razor-sharp academic whose cold and distant demeanor gives way to tender conversations and reflections as Eleanor comes to know her during afternoon meetings and shared lunches.  I am even tempted to say the film plays best not as a direct story of lovers in flux, but rather as a series of generation-gap-bridging dispatches regarding life and how it should and should not be lived.  No one has the precise answer, but they inch toward it as they help or clash with one another day by day.",1414800000,18,2269,5.121951219512195

6781183,5,B00P1WGG46,"I'm surprised by the frequent use of the adjective ""boring"" to describe it, but then perhaps this film is best appreciated by those who have lived long enough to experience at least one significant loss. The dialogue reminded me of how very inarticulate we find ourselves just when we desparately don't want to be. Yes, the film is slow-paced, but that allows for character development, and, yes, the story is told with flashbacks, but, I felt it only adds to the poignancy of this couple struggling with love, anger, and loss. The ending is ambiguous, but, doesn't that leave room for hope? Every cast member is wonderful in his or her role, and Jessica Chastain and James McAvoy are heartbreakingly believable in their roles as a couple whose love for one another has come undone. Isabelle Huppert and John Hurt as the parents of Chastain's character are a perfect, if quirky, counterpoint to her own marriage. The soundtrack is usually spot-one, especially the song used for the closing scene and credits.

6781208,5,B00P1WGG46,The best movie i've seen this yeat,1433030400,,34,4.0
6781209,4,B00P1WGG46,"Ned Benson both wrote and directed this little quiet film - an amalgamation of two separate films `The Disappearance of Eleanor Rigby Her' and `The Disappearance of Eleanor Rigby Him'. Each premiered in 2013 as two films at the Toronto Film Festival. After the premiere, although it received rave reviews, Ned Benson started cutting the movie again, as a one feature. The Disappearance of Eleanor Rigby: Them (2014) premiered at the Cannes Film Festival. All three movies received a theatrical release.

The story is elusive, dealing with internal issues as to why a happy marriage dissolves. Perhaps (and this is not said outright) the marriage crumbled with the death of their little boy (no details of when or how are given, just obtuse references), but what ever the reason, the summary sates a woman and man seemingly so in love finds their marriage is shaken to the core when life throws them a devastating curve. Now this New York couple must try to understand each other as they cope with loss and attempt to reclaim the life and love they once had.

The cast is loaded with stars - Eleanor Rigby is beautifully off center as played by Jessica Chastain and she is matched by her husband Conor played by James McAvoy. But the supporting cast (all in very small roles) offers Eleanor's parents portrayed by Isabelle Huppert (who has some of the best lines - `I didn't know I could retrieve all the opportunities I threw away then.' - and William Hurt, Conor's father by Ciar&aacute;n Hinds, Viola Davis as a snarky professor, Ryan Eggold as a would-be paramour for Eleanor, Jess Weixler as Eleanor's sister, and Nina Arianda as Conor's paramour, and more.

The story is fragile and perhaps too much so, as the line of relating the tale runs into alleyways of nothing too frequently. It is as though a very fine editor could have tightened this up and made it stronger. Certainly as far as a cast is concerned it is top drawer: it just drags around far too slowly to stay very interested. The DVD comes with a second disc for the `Her' and `Him' version, but after over two hours of `Them', viewing that may merit watching on another evening. Very mixed feelings.

6781237,5,B00P1WGG46,"So, I am absolutely in loving with The Disappearance of Eleanor Rigby. The story is broken into three films: Him, Her, and Them. All three films follow the same time period, but are told from the differing perspectives of Connor Ludlow (James McAvoy) and Eleanor Rigby (Jessica Chastain), a young married couple living in New York coping with a recent trauma. ""Him"" looks at their relationship from Connor's angle; while ""Her"" follows Eleanor's. ""Them"" is a single cut of ""Him"" and ""Her"" made because the The Weinstein Company did think people would pay for two films. I think Ned Benson's original vision (the ""Him"" and ""Her"" two film version) is simply brilliant. The most realistic and insightful love story I've seen in years.",1429833600,,730,4.943089430894309
6781238,4,B00P1WGG46,"Possible spoilers.  Newcomer Ned Benson, who directed and wrote this film, has attempted something I've not seen before.  This particular film is actually an edited version of two other films (same title) that follow the story from ""Her"" perspective and another from his (""Him"").  I've not see either.  The ""her"" is Eleanor (Jessica Chastain) and the ""him"" is Conor (James McAvoy).

The film opens with their meeting and falling in love.  The story changes quickly as the now lone figure of Eleanor is riding her bicycle, then walking across one of the bridges in New York City.  Clearly despondent, she jumps.  But why?  This event, happens very early in the film so hopefully it isn't too much of a spoiler.

The story picks up as both Eleanor and Conor try to pick up the pieces from a life changing event (I won't give it away) that has caused their estrangement.  Eleanor returns to her family home in suburbia where she is tended to by her parents (Isabelle Huppert and William Hurt, both great) and her younger sister (Jess Weixler).  Cutting to Conor, he owns a restaurant that isn't doing well.  His cook...err...chef is played by Bill Hader.  His attempts to see Eleanor are rebuffed after he follows her to college where she has signed up for a few classes.  It is there she meets a professor (Viola Davis) who becomes her confidant and shoulder to cry on.

The film looks good and has an authentic NYC vibe.  It also is a bit herky-jerky, certainly due to the editing.  Some scenes seem to long and others too short.  I continued to scratch my head about whether or not this couple is likable, even after the big reveal.  Having said that, I get it.  The performances by Chastain and McAvoy are wonderful and convey the honest angst of the characters.  Some events change you forever.  This isn't a feel good film to be sure, but it is hopeful.  Recommended.

The Blu ray transfer comes in 1080p video resolution with a 2.40:1 aspect ratio.  The film looks its best in the brighter lit scenes.  The overall look of the digitally shot film is good, if not necessarily great.  Black levels are inconsistent but the detail is fine.  Minor complaints that shouldn't take away from the enjoyment of the movie.  The Blu ray features a DTS-HD Master Audio 5.1 sound track.  It is excellent and delivers some nice surround effects, especially during a rain storm.  The musical score by Son Lux really shines and is well presented.  Dialog is clear and intelligible.  Subtitles are available in Spanish and English SDH.  Extras include a Q & A with Chastain and McAvoy.  A second disc contains the ""Her"" and ""Him"" versions of the film.",1428537600,,2638,4.683406113537118

I bought the Blu-ray and enjoyed 'Her' and 'Him' in that order much better.  It's almost like 2 different movies because there is very little overlap or shared scenes between the two perspectives.

Personally, I think ""Him"" is the best version, but it's also a bit uneven.  James McAvoy and Jessica Chastain give extremely strong performances and are well worth watching.  The problem lies in the writing or editing of the film; none of the versions tells this couple's heartbreaking story as completely as it should have been told.  I also wish Ciaran Hinds had been given more screen time; he's also excellent and his character's paternal relationship with McAvoy's character should have been more developed in the film (s).",1427932800,2,814,5.029850746268656

I watched the him version first as I had read a review that advised it but I think it was wrong.  I love Jame Mcavoy and think he is one of the most talented actors of his generation.  His version is very real and quite heavy and so I think it is better to see Jessica Chastain's performance first.  She is so cold in the him version and I think the audience needs to see her in a more sympathetic light.  It is easier to understand her in the him version if we're able to see her point of view first.  It is a riveting and truthful story that anyone who has experienced loss will be so moved and touched by the characters' pain. And I was very happy with the ending, it was  important for the characters to come to that place.

6781251,4,B00P1WGG46,"So, despite what everyone seems to be saying....this is a good movie. There are a lot of holes but they aren't very hard to interpret. Their infant son, Cody, dies suddenly and no, it doesn't go into detail about how (which I'm actually grateful for) but they are thrust into a position of unimaginable grief. Eleanor basically takes a leave of her marriage to try and cope with her feelings and try to wrap her head around the fact that her child is gone and whatever life they had before...is gone. I felt very involved and connected with the characters throughout the film; when she felt sad I understood and vice versa with Conor. I cried a couple of times during the film, mainly the part when they finally discuss their feelings towards their son passing, I can't imagine being in that position. The only part I was a little at odds with was the end. Ok, she goes to Paris to get on with her life and return to whatever she was doing before she got pregnant but then sometime after Conor leaves his new restaraunt to take a walk and you very distantly see someone walking behind him, to me it was obvious plus her bright red hair wasn't too hard to distinguish. Anyways, he proceeds to walk in the park and then you see her following him, not in any hurry to catch up but her eyes never leave him, and then the credits roll once they are out of sight. Ummmm, no. I'm not a cliff hanger fan at all. I hate them. I think that it's obvious they get back together, I mean, she came back for him! But I would've of liked to have seen the absolute confirmation of my assumption. So after being a bit disappointed with the end I, rather hastily, looked on Amazon to order the book. No book??! This movie would be a wonderful book! Like this movie requires to be detailed like books are and since it's split into 3 movies....I don't get it. Please write a book for it...like a follow up for the aftermath.
Also I'm judging solely based on the 'Them' movie. I choose to watch this part first because I wanted to experience both their stories. I do plan on watching the other 2 movies (why not?) but from reviews I've read the other 2 parts aren't extremely different and doesn't show so much more that I have to watch them now. So, in short, the movie (Them) is good. Period. It's a very complex emotional real life feeling movie. I just wish that 1.) there were a book and 2.) the ending was a little more clear so I didn't have a nagging feeling that I'm wrong and maybe they don't end up together.....",1426982400,,2501,4.323404255319149

6781271,3,B00P1WGG46,"Color me surprised when I found out that The Disappearance of Eleanor Rigby wasn't about a girl who, you know, disappeared.  Maybe it was all the Gone Girl hoopla that was escalating around the time that some people were starting to whisper about this film, but I was under the impression that the title character, Eleanor, disappeared.  I mean, I guess she kind of does, since her husband doesnt know where she is for like thirty minutes of the movie, but she never really disappears since we, the audience, know where she is at all times and shes never deliberately hiding, shes just not at her house.

But this is possibly all Harvey Weinsteins fault.

Yes, The Disappearance of Eleanor Rigby is yet another film that Harvey butchered, taking what was supposed to be an elaborate character study of two sides of a particular story and condensing it to what he considered a more palatable presentation.  That means that two films (Him and Her) were combined into one film (Them) and the editing left us with a very incomplete and unsatisfying film.

Im trying to envision what the combined feel of Him and Her would be, but Im struggling to care through this underdeveloped bore of a hybrid film.

The film tells the story of a couple who are so much in love and yet so much apart thanks to the horrific loss of their son.  How he died is never broached and it really isn't important, because this film is all about the handling of that grief and the strain it can put on a relationship.  So, in the films opening scenes we see a distraught Eleanor plunging into the ocean in an apparent attempted suicide.  Shes pulled to safety and apparently it is then that she disappears from her husbands life, taking refuge in the home of her intrusive parents.  Her husband, Conor, is desperate to find her and soon he does.  She isn't ready to see him, but he continues to pursue her, to stalk her almost, until she finally decides to hear him out, to talk, to see where they are and if they can work through their grief together.

Im sorry, but this movie just does not work.

Now, I cannot speak for the separate parts, and Ive heard that when viewed as Him and Her, this is a beautiful and heartfelt story, but in this distorted and hacked amalgam, this film has absolutely no impact.  We barely get to know Conor at all, and the reasons for their separation and lack of ability to work things through hardly registers, which is a problem.  We cant connect to these characters at all, to their struggle or plight because none of it feels developed.  Instead, were left with a lot of open ended questions that feel like they just lay there in empty space.  Because of the back and forth forced edit, many of the characters actions feel unrealistic and pretty distracting, to be honest.

Jessica Chastain and James McAvoy deliver very good performances that are let down by the edit given the film because they possess no real chemistry here, given the amount of time they are allowed to develop their characters relationship.  I never felt anything towards Conor at all, in particular, who seems to have been edited out of the story the most (like, he basically has the same conversation 50 times in this movie).  Eleanor is a great character, and this is the first time I think Ive really been impressed with Chastain, who cycles her characters grief and desire to reconcile very well, but the way that the story is butchered leaves her feeling like a very incomplete character.  Her sporadic emotional shifts made no sense in the confines of the films structure.

I feel bad for Ned Benson.  This was his first film, and it generated a LOT of buzz for the whole of its parts were considered beautiful.  Why Harvey decided this needed to be butchered for a larger audience is beyond me, since this film never even made it past a limited release.  Its not like he actually promoted this film or tried to make anything of it.  He bought it, butchered it and then threw it away.

Oh, and calling this romantic is just misleading.",1425600000,2,4023,4.5654596100278555

While watching ""Him"", I was moved by Connor's chasing after Eleanor to no avail and felt she was a bit callous. On the other hand, while watching ""Her"", I began to understand that in addition to Eleanor's grief, her identity crisis (and being unsure of what's next) was a bit more paralyzing than Connor's which is what lead to their estrangement. Both films tell poignant stories of grief, love and growing up. I like how there are three different films I can watch, which all offer a different, fresh perspective on their relationship. If you don't need to have your films tied up into a neat bow and are able to appreciate the complex, messy yet beautiful nature of life, then you'll be able to enjoy these films.

Rather, it is a portrayal of how the main characters Conor and Eleanor understand their relationships with each other and the people around them. I can almost say that the tragedy that befalls them doesn't even matter (okay, maybe this isn't entirely true), but only serves as the back drop for the main ""event"": a relationship that has fallen apart and its implications. Thus you hardly ever hear mention of the tragedy itself because it is not the main point of the film. Yes, the tragedy that occurs is an important aspect of the story and is what draws the characters apart, but the purpose of the movie is how they handle and make sense of what happens and how it has affected themselves and their relationships. The lack of dramatic music or other shock indicators when we finally figure out what has happened highlights this fact. I think many of us can identify with aspects of both Conor and Eleanor if we had ever been in a relationship, gone through a break up, or lost something important in our lives. Having the story told from both perspectives of Him and Her highlight the complexity of how people make sense of their realities differently. Using minimal yet poignant music allows the beauty of this film to be in the dialogue, the realistic and humanistic portrayal of a couple's marriage/it's disintegration and their relationships.

Writer/director Ned Benson began with just two films, the story of a married couple, separated in the wake of tragedy, told from two different perspectives.  Him would relate the tale from the husbands point-of-view, and Her would be the wifes side.  Its an intriguing concept, a bit like RASHOMON, which has since been utilized in the Showtime series, THE AFFAIR.

With THE DISAPPEARANCE OF ELEANOR RIGBY: THEM, Benson went back into the editing room and combined the two full-length earlier films into one powerful, engrossing two-hour drama, which is what I watched.

Jessica Chastain, who within a very few years has become one of the finest and sought-after actresses in films, and James McAvoy play the estranged couple who have problems living with and without each other.  A first-rate cast that includes William Hurt and Isabelle Huppert as Jessicas parents, Ciaran Hinds as McAvoys father, plus Viola Davis, Bill Hader and Jess Weixler supports them.

8686121,3,B00P1WGG46,"This is a sleepy slow paced film, so if you're expecting something exciting, this isn't it.  I enjoyed this despite some of it's obvious holes.  The acting by James McAvoy helps as he breathes some spark and life into this picture.  If he wasn't in it, this would be a total downer.  It's not necessarily sad even though it's about grief, but I wasn't made to care all that much about what one of the characters was going through.  James' character is married to the Jessica Chastain character, while not much is revealed about what happens in this, there are signs in this film that point to their marriage reaching a point of separation due to losing their child.  The Jessica character then moves to despondence moping through the whole picture while the James character desperately tries his best to re-connect with her, but sadly she isn't having it.

I found it really difficult to care for the Jessica character despite her going through a grieving process.  I've experienced great loss of loved ones in the past and have been down and grieving for some time, but I never shut people around me out.  I reveled in those connections.  I certainly wouldn't push my main lover away, but I guess some people do that.  I couldn't relate, because I don't do that and it just seemed crueler than anything else.  It's one thing to have your space, but this is hard to believe.  Her mate lost the same child too and as her father played by John Hurt tells her, he lost a grandson.  Everyone trying to get her to snap out of it and move on, which yes it's hard to do, but who wants to watch that for two hours with not much hope involved.  And like I said I've experienced grief and so have those around me, but I never saw them do what this character does.  Regardless, the film doesn't do a convincing job to get me to care, so it didn't quite work in that respect.

The positives were that James McAvoy was great in this giving the scenes the much needed boost it needed out of the typical dreariness.  Viola Davis has a small part and also does a great job at elevating the scenes and making them interesting.  Both of them made this worthwhile.",1519257600,,2145,4.439897698209719
