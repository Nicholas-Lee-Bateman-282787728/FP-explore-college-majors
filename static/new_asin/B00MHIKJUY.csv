6578226,5,B00MHIKJUY,"This is one of the best movies I have watched.  It is a true Christian movie with the right mix of scripture and great acting.  Good plot too.  In addition it is one of the best romance movies I've ever seen.  You can watch this one with your family with no trepidation.

The most abused genre of movies these days is any category that starts with ""Christian""; no one seems to have the remotest idea what defines Christian, i.e. following or pertaining to a disciple of Jesus Christ.  If you want to see what I mean, just go to a department such as Amazon Instant Video and type in ""Christian .... movie, romance, etc."" and see what you get; appalling.

Not to worry this is Christian entertainment at it's best; it doesn't get any better.  Highly recommended.",1412640000,60,760,4.4963503649635035
6578227,5,B00MHIKJUY,"I found this delightful movie by accident. I am a big Sarah Lancaster fan from the series ""Chuck""  and Kelly McGillis is a superb as well. Though the story is a little hokey it is a wonderful spiritual message we all need to remember.",1412380800,,234,4.318181818181818

This truly is a Christian film that focuses on learning to trust and not judging people by who they appear to be, but as who they are.  Sarah Lancaster and Tom Everett Scott lead a talented cast in this film that I highly recommend for high quality family entertainment.",1499472000,,371,4.967741935483871

6578258,1,B00MHIKJUY,"This movie was terrible and was not feel good in any way! Actually, now that I watched it I just feel terrible. I would consider it neither Christian nor family-friendly. There is one scripture passage that is routinely quoted throughout, but it doesn't seem to have anything to do with the film in actuality. It's full of scary images and ideas for small children to be mortified by. If you are going to show it to your children, make sure they are at least 10 or 12. By the way, they would probably not enjoy it, as it is a terrible movie.",1491091200,,541,4.313725490196078

That's the feeling I got from how Tom Everett Scott portrayed it. The movie, in my opinion, gave the message of...don't judge a book by its cover. That made the movie powerful and long with the great acting, it kept me wanting to watch it and see how the story unfolds. As much as I love my action and comedy movies... I love movies that tells a story that moves me, has a great message in it, and has relatable characters in it. This movie has all of that. Like I said before...

6578370,4,B00MHIKJUY,"This movie was very enjoyable. I am a fan of feel good happy endings and this one has it all. Tom Everett Scott brought so much to this role. I especially liked the relationships he built with the Amish people who poured their lives into him and his son without even knowing who they were and how a guy caught up in all the world has to offer can find peace, comfort and joy in a simple, relationship oriented life.

Sarah Scott is one of my favorite Hallmark Christmas movie actresses and she did a great job as well. Overall, this movie was well cast and directed. IMDB shows this movie to be rated at around 3 or 3 1/2 stars but I'd rate it higher as it satisfied my desire to escape and feel lifted (and thankfully was void of the cheese effect).",1451952000,,750,4.208333333333333

6578384,4,B00MHIKJUY,"I don't know how closely the UP TV movie adaptation, LOVE FINDS YOU IN SUGARCREEK, OHIO, hewed to Serena B. Miller's novel, but it drew me in enough that I feel like looking up the novel. The movie has this quaint Swiss and Amish vibe to it while still remaining very much a mystery. The story sets itself in Ohio's Amish sector, in the small, picturesque town of Sugarcreek, in the thick of its annual, tourist-flocking Swiss Festival. Rachel Troyer (Sarah Lancaster, CHUCK) is the tough local policewoman. She tends to be fiercely protective of her three elderly Amish aunts who happen to be the proprietors of a tumbledown farmhouse inn. When the aunts take in a scruffy drifter (Tom Everett Scott) and his sickly 5-year-old boy, it triggers their niece's bump of paranoia. Officer Troyer observes the shabby clothes on the new tenant but also the $300 shoes, the lack of ID - dude claims that his wallet was stolen - and just the general shadiness of him. Now, Sarah, historically, has had her share of trust issues. Being orphaned at an early age has turned her into a lifelong cynic. And when there's smoke, there's fire, right? Sarah promptly initiates a background check on the stranger. This could take a while.

Because I'm a guy, the first thing that sunk in was the high ratio of babeness in Sugarcreek's police force. With CHUCK, I was always waffling between who was sexier, Yvonne Strahovski or Sarah Lancaster. Lancaster and the actress (Nicole Badaan?) who plays the Police Academy graduate are really easy on the eyes. I'm glad that Sarah is staying active. I'd already seen - and enjoyed - her performances in three other made-for-TV movies:&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Oh-Christmas-Tree/dp/B00N9QM6N6/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Oh Christmas Tree!</a>&nbsp;(a.k.a. FIR CRAZY, 2013), LOOKING FOR MR. RIGHT (2014), and ALONG CAME A NANNY (2014). She just comes across as a really sweet person. As Officer Troyer, she's got a more hardened edge to her as she gets to exhibit her dramatic flair. Tom Everett Scott is also perfectly cast in his role as the man of mystery who should've known better than to show off and reveal a key detail about his past. But when Sarah Lancaster's in the room, you can't help but show off. So I don't blame his goof.

There really aren't a lot of suspects, so I'm guessing you'll be able to suss out the guilty party just be the process of elimination. The movie doesn't try to keep you in the dark as far as Scott's true identity or why he's been on the run for months now. Early on, the tabloids give it away. So, if the mystery isn't as arresting, then what's the draw? For me, from jump, it's Sarah Lancaster. But, as I watched the movie, I sort of fell in love with the cinematography. Ohio has never looked so good. It's also a beautiful depiction of the Amish community and how kind and charitable those folks are. I thought Kelly McGillis was fantastic as one of the Amish aunts. She may be decades removed from TOP GUN and WITNESS, but she still has this ability to stand out, this time with her acting chops. I also dug the scene in which Scott competed in the Swiss Festival's boulder-hurling event. It certainly bought him more credibility in Officer Troyler's eyes. But, maybe, my favorite scene is the one in which Scott deftly deals with a pack of pushy reporters. So, to sum up, this is a terrific movie. It's a good-looking movie. It's wonderfully acted. It presents moral lessons that could never get old, nuggets about not judging a book by its cover and that the simpler life offers its own share of bounty. LOVE FINDS YOU IN SUGARCREEK, OHIO does present some dark subject matter that sort of creep under the wholesome surface, so there's that. But there's no objectionable language. The two leads have a solid chemistry. The kid actor didn't get on my nerves. The love story is low keyed and nicely executed. And I am now clamoring for a Swiss Festival in MY town. With boulder tossing.",1440892800,3,4004,4.793053545586107

6578422,5,B00MHIKJUY,"Filmed on location in Sugarcreek, Ohio in the midst of Amish Country, director Terry Cunningham brings a story that is multilayered with many issues occurring for an involved Amish family. A young police officer, Rachel Troyler (Sarah Lancaster) was orphaned as a child and raised by three Amish women, now her ""Aunts"" with whom she stays at the Inn they own; The Sugar Haus Inn. One of the Aunts being ""Bertha"" Troyler (Kelly McGillis, who is once again reprising another Amish portrayal since the movie ""Witness"") who is very wise and showing a much different character during this turn. These Aunts are special and especially wonderful to view during their performances while hearing their perspectives on life. They are helpful, wholesome and so very kind.

Into the town comes a disheveled looking and mysterious man, Joe Matthews (Tom Everett Scott) and his five-year-old son, Bobby (Thomas Kapanowski) having no place to stay and fleeing from an apparently secretive set of circumstances. Having nowhere to go or to stay, they wind up at the Inn and Joe is hired by the Aunts as their handyman. This immediately makes Rachel extremely suspicious. Who are this man and his child? Why are they wandering aimlessly around Sugarcreek? There has to be something going on here and Rachel is not happy that her Aunts have them there although knows that they could never turn somebody who needs aid away. It is not in their nature and these ladies are like no other women. They seem to almost steal every scene they are in with their wise counsel and loving care. Rachel is extremely protective of her Aunt's welfare and sets out immediately to dig into the life of Joe. His past, his issues, his reasons while the whole time she just may be finding some light through their muddied up and dark pasts. The more she investigates, the more layers are peeling back but are her feelings also getting involved with this man's condition or are they interfering with it? The storyline is full of love from the Aunts, mainly Bertha, toward a wayward man and son in pain - given freely with a welcoming spirits and freely loving hearts. The film explores many topics of grief, mystery, faith, action, suspense and some darker content but mainly this film may dare to consider a real romance and a love found in Sugarcreek.

This is a very warm film. The countryside of Ohio is beautifully filmed (Adam N. White) and includes a sumptuous musical score (Jamie Christopherson) which can easily carry you away during the lovely pastoral views. For me, this movie is a keeper now that I have rented it, I will purchase this. I adore a different type of romantic storyline. This boasts an integrity and interesting character portrayals along with different situations including some things which are unpredictable. Another film to grab the Kleenex during if you are sentimental as I am and feel much better for watching a movie of this caliber.",1432339200,4,2928,4.842315369261477

Destitute people become millionaires. Female cops start wearing lip gloss and tight jeans. Attempted murder and arson happen. Mysteries are solved.

This is another ""ginger bread"" movie as I call them. Everyone is pretty even when they are down and out. No big issues as everyone is pretty much nice. No big problems and if there are they don't go unsolved. Very Christian themed and quiet--soft spoken. I like 'em. But this one tried to spice the story book plot up a little by introducing murder and mayhem. But with this being a ginger bread story that turn of events didn't get too big of a rise out of you. You know all will be well in the end, as it should be.

I really liked the actors' portrayals of the characters and thought they all did a wonderful job. Tom Everett Scott and Sarah Lancaster were believable in their roles. The romance and family-unit story lines were also believable and very well done. There was a nice underlying mystery, and although I figured it out, I was still thinking ""well done.""

I've loved Tom Everett Scott since first seeing ""That Thing You DO,"" and I'm a huge ""Chuck"" fan, so I already knew I liked Sarah Lancaster. I figured I couldn't go wrong with this movie. I was right. It did not disappoint. I was surprised to find that one of the Amish aunts was actually Kelly McGinnis, from Top Gun. I didn't even recognize her until I saw the ending credits and then went back to watch it again. This movie has romance, mystery, and sights from the actual town of Sugarcreek, Ohio, like the cute little Swiss-style buildings with working cuckoo clocks, ornate woodwork, the little mountain train that disappears into the tunnel...and horses and buggies galore. It's all authentic. Brought back lots of good memories. I loved it.",1415232000,2,884,4.60126582278481

The storyline is worth following and the film is well-sprinkled with drama, humor, action, romance and a spiritual lesson. My only disappointment involved the role of Chloe. I felt the director allowed the actress to run her part over the top, especially toward the end. The three ladies who were in charge of the Inn were a crack-up. One of them was an unusual role for Kelly McGillis, who carried it out in style, and the part of the little boy was portrayed very nicely.

6578529,5,B00MHIKJUY,"We bought this DVD for the Holidays but couldn't wait, it really is a great old fashioned well made Family movie with a surprise ending.

I live in the area near Sugarcreek, so I can say that this is an honest to goodness accurate portrayal of the Amish community and the locals. The struggle between Rachel and her Aunt's old school views play a major part of the story and the Stranger in Town adds suspense as Rachel and Joe get to know each other and their love blooms. The little boy playing Joe's son is adorable as is the Aunt who loves to bake cookies.

Based on the book of the same name by Serena B. Miller, director Terry Cunningham does a brilliant job capturing the story and showing the true beauty of the Ohio Countryside and Amish way of life.

Tom Everett and Sarah Lancaster are perfect in their roles and with their good chemistry could easily carry this into several sequels. I was surprised by Kelly McGillis and actually like her better in this movie than Witness, I forgot how good an actress she really is.

I hope we get to see a sequel to this wonderful family film or even a series of films, maybe their Wedding and mystery surrounding the ""Fabulous Fifties Fling"" annual car show? I like to think that Rachel Troyler became the Police Chief of Sugarcreek and Micah the School's Little League Baseball Coach. I would also like to see the struggle as their son Bobby tries to fit in as an ""englisher"" amongst the Amish kids.

6578535,3,B00MHIKJUY,"A Dove approved. part mystery, part ugly back story, part thriller, all romance, movie that offers a good story, characters to care about, and location filming.

Sugarcreek, Ohio, Amishland, finds a mysterious stranger(Tom Everett Scott) along with his young son showing up with a broken car and no money.  The friendly Amish help them out, and he ends up staying and becoming a handyman for 3 Amish woman, running a Inn, including, shades of 'Witness', Kelly McGillis.

The 3 women are the aunts of local policewoman Rachel(Sarah Lancaster) who, of course, is immediately suspicious of Joe the stranger.  Indeed, both Joe and Rachel have dark pasts, and are destined to bump heads enough times before they start to realize a mutuality.

The unravelling of the mystery and potential love affair happens amid beautiful country and small town scenery.  The filming, acting and setting are all well done.  They use an actual local fair and Ohio locations to give the film an authentic feel. The special features include a behind the scenes look which I always find educating.  Ms. McGillis mentions her familiarity with this theme; although, 'Witness' takes place among the Pennsylvania Amish.  Having myself lived in Iowa, and working and interacting with the Amish, I appreciate the film's depiction of their friendliness and warmth.,

The story is based on the novel series by Serena Miller, and pretty much kept my interest with only a little bit of hokiness to deal with.  They tout this as a family film.  Well, there's no sex, language or gore, but the back stories of the leads involve murder.  There are stressful threatening situations involving children and the policewoman including a shooting.  Overall, I think this movie is way too mature for young ones because of these limited but emotionally traumatic scenes; besides, our elementary aged kids know a love story when they see one and are out of there.

In summary, a well made movie with mysteries to be solved, Amish background, and maybe love to blossom.  An adult 'family movie'.",1412812800,17,2047,5.011834319526627
