5450487,5,B00AMA8GH2,"The first time my kids watched Sid the Science Kid The Movie I was in the other room and all I kept hearing was Reed laughing really hard! Reed is like me, we don't laugh out loud unless we find something really funny. We are a tough crowd so I knew we had a winner before I even watched it.

When I asked Reed what was so funny he said when they touched the robot's control panel he turned into different kinds of machines. I had to see it for myself so I joined them the next time (which by the way, was immediately following the first time they watched it).

This movie, as all Sid the Science Kid shows, is so educational! He and Gabriela win a trip to a museum which is the perfect learning environment. It is full of facts on things like astronomy, weather, dinosaurs, and my sons favorite: machines. It was even entertaining for me to watch and I found myself laughing along with Reed.

I love that it is just one hour long which is the ideal length in my opinion. TV shows are 20 minutes when you take out the commercials and most kids movies are around an hour and a half. This one isn't too long or too short; it's just right!

Sid the Science kid The Movie was a huge hit in my house with both of my kids. I love it when they want to watch the same show so there's no fight over whose turn it is. Thanks NCircle for making peace in my house!",1364860800,,1352,4.071428571428571
5450488,5,B00AMA8GH2,"We were recently sent a complimentary copy of ""Sid the Science Kid: Sid the Movie"" from NCircle Entertainment as part of their iNSider program. While we are very familiar with some of the NCircle brands, Sid the Science Kid was a new one for us so we were very excited to see what Sid was all about. Our first impression was that the movie was good and we loved Sid and friends, but as the movie went on and they went to the museum it became so much more. The museum really comes to life and gives the children a nice balance of fun and education. They cover an array of topics as they go through the museum leaving little tidbits of knowledge for the children all while tossing in lots of cute jokes and a robot gone haywire, oh and did I mention Christopher Lloyd? My 3 year old really enjoyed watching this movie, but I think anyone of any age could appreciate it. We look forward to seeing more of Sid and are excited to add him to our favorites.",1364083200,,950,4.225274725274725
5450489,5,B00AMA8GH2,"We have thoroughly enjoyed this movie!! It was just the right length for both kids to stay interested. My son especially loved the jokes and of course we can't stop saying ""this is gonna be...so much fun!"" I loved Christopher Lloyd saying ""great Scott!"" The idea of teamwork was good but we talked a lot about how the exhibits (dinosaurs, bees) were pretend. It helped that Sid could laugh and enjoy them without being afraid even though they look so real. My sons only complaint - he was worried May and Gerald were sad they couldn't go too!! Thanks so much!!",1364083200,,560,4.554455445544554
5450490,5,B00AMA8GH2,"I have had the awesome opportunity to be an iNsider for NCircle Entertainment. This month I received Sid the Science Kid The Movie on DVD to watch and review. With our crazy schedules, we hadn't been able to watch it until tonight. First of all, let me say this: Micah (3) will NOT watch something unless it is one of his very few favorites (one of which is an NCircle dvd, Mighty Machines). He sat and watched the entire DVD of Sid the Science Kid!

Of course, with four kids (10, 8, 6, and 3) I get stuck watching a LOT of kids shows. Sid the Science Kid is one that I don't mind as much, because it is educational. I enjoyed watching Sid the Science Kid the Movie! It was really funny. There were parts that had me laughing out loud. I really enjoyed that it showed how even little kids can make a difference in trying to solve a problem. Heaven (10) mentioned that she really liked it, but wished there was some more action. Just a few minutes later there was a bit more action added in. That perked her up! All five of us enjoyed watching the movie, and I'm sure it will get watched many more times.",1363996800,3,1104,4.2075471698113205
5450491,5,B00AMA8GH2,"My Family had the opportunity to view Sid the Science Kid: The movie, before it went on sale.  My Family Loves it!  This movie will give the minds of your young ones, just enough itch for them to want to scratch into their curiosity.  Young Sid and Gabriela make the movie fun as they teach just enough about simple machines, probability, bees, teamwork and much, much more.  Sid's cute little jokes always keeps us entertained!  It is great for all ages!  The only thing I wish there was more of are those adorable dances and songs that have captivated my 16 month old on the TV show.  It could us more language choices too.  But overall,  I can't wait for Sid's next adventure!!",1363824000,4,680,4.463414634146342
5450492,5,B00AMA8GH2,"As a homeschooler, I found this DVD to be great for introducing my kids to several different topics.  Academically, there is basic information on astronomy, weather, dinosaurs, bees, simple machines and probability.  Additional topics in the DVD include robots, teamwork, problem solving and learning to be humble.  As a bonus, your child will learn several cute jokes and will have fun solving the riddles throughout the DVD.
My older kids, ages 10 and 12, did not plan to watch the DVD with me and the younger ones, because they typically find the tv show to be too ""young""  for them.  However, when Sid and Gabriela win the trip to the museum, there are two older kids who also win. As they move through the various areas of the museum, each pair of kids share what they know about that topic.  This elevated my older girls' interest and they actually sat and watched the whole thing.  We all found the DVD to be informative and funny at many parts.

I recommend Sid the Science Kid: The Movie to anyone who knows a child that enjoys Sid the Science Kid, or just science in general.  I would recommend it for ages 4-10.

**Disclaimer**- I received a free copy of this DVD as an iNSider for NCircle Entertainment.",1363651200,4,1215,4.609302325581395
5450493,5,B00AMA8GH2,"Sid the Science Kid: The Movie takes you and your kids through the soon-to-open Super Ultimate Science Museum along with Sid, Gabriella and two new friends from China. After winning a science contest that gives them an advance tour of the museum, the kids go on a fun journey with a very artificially intelligent robot named Bobby Bot. However, when one of the exhibits causes Bobby Bot's circuit board to crash, the kids try to fix him. The result of their efforts is a hilarious haywire robot! Kids get a sampling of some scientific knowledge presented to them that will spur conversations to dive deeper into certain areas of interest. Kids learn about bees in a larger than life beehive exhibit, simple machines like pulleys and levers, dinosaurs in the prehistoric exhibit, the definition of astronomy and even the concept of probability is introduced. This movie serves as a great springboard for discussion of different scientific concepts, but also as a comical movie to enjoy with your kids. My 6 year old said his favorite part of the movie was the singing T-Rex, and my 5 year old enjoyed watching Bobby Bot's silly antics when he went haywire. I was impressed by how fun this movie was for kids while still providing a great educational experience. With a runtime of 75 minutes, it was just the right length. When asked how they would rate the movie, they gave it a whopping 10 out of 10! Thanks, NCircle! Keep up the great work!",1363305600,,1441,4.722222222222222

5450502,2,B00AMA8GH2,"As much as I love the show, the Sid the Science Kid movie is awful. The whole premise of the show is that it teaches young children about actual science and the scientific method. The concepts and experiments presented are factual and can be replicated at home. The movie takes the science aspect and distills it from ""Science is a process, something you do to gain information about the world"" to ""Hey! Look at this cool thing with bright lights and lots of sound! Science!"" I understand that it is a children's movie based on a children's show, and people don't typically expect realistic science from children's (or most) movies (Transformers and TMNT come to mind). But a movie based on a show that is known for that very thing - factual science - should at least make an attempt to be true to it's source material. Robots with highly sophisticated and futuristic A.I. and human emotions? Come on. (And don't even get me started on the racial stereotyping.) My daughter enjoys the movie - it does what a typical children's movie should do, which is entertain. I just wish it had more substance. Pretty disappointing.",1439683200,2,1120,4.719387755102041

5450512,5,B00AMA8GH2,If you want to teach your kids the fund and excitement of science then this is the movie for you!  Side the Science Kid does a GREAT way of teaching science concepts to young children.  My daughter is 2 and she really understands the concepts Sid teaches her.  She sings the songs and she acts out the concepts in her pretend play time.  Sid asks questions because he wants to understand why things work the way they do and the adults around him teach him in ways a child will understand.  Then Sid and his friends sing and act out the lessons they learn.  They are all great movies and should be part of any child's learning library.,1417564800,,634,4.330508474576271

5450520,5,B00AMA8GH2,"This was a big hit for my 4 and 5 year old great nephews. Even my 18 month great niece would set through it. She loves being with her brothers but the movie is colorful with some of the voices being excited and higher pitched.
I was with them for a week and we watched at least 3 times and that was more than they are really allowed to watch TV. It has robots and the newer ways of doing things then mentions leverage, pulleys. Overall a good family movie that teaches young ones in a fun way.",1405036800,,493,4.040816326530612

5450523,5,B00AMA8GH2,"My son loves the show and also really enjoyed the movie. He is a pretty active five year old and it held his attention the entire length of the movie on a long flight.  Sid the Science Kid is a perfect series for curious kids as he is always investigating the ""why's"" of the world.  My kids always have something to share with me after they watch it and the themes always point children in a positive direction.  This movie is no exception and lives up to the many positives of the series.",1395014400,,489,4.236559139784946
5450524,5,B00AMA8GH2,Sid the Science Kid presents science in a very entertaining way for children.  It teaches observation and critical thinking skills.  My 4 year old Granddaughter loves this movie.  Adults can learn from Sid as well.,1389744000,,214,5.057142857142857
5450525,2,B00AMA8GH2,"I was disappointed by this movie. My 2 and 4 year old love the show but the movie felt very different. It really felt like the creators were intentionally trying to merge Willie Wonka with Sid and we didn't like it. My 4 year old boy was creeped out by the life size bees, the strange robots, and the ominous music. I was disappointed by the bad writing, the seemingly forced ""message"", and the strange jokes that seemed out of character for the Sid show. My son was asking for me to turn it off half way in and I had to convince him to watch it to the end thinking that it would get better, but it didn't really get better. I think some kids might like this movie, it wasn't horrible, but there are so many better movies for kids out there and my kids would have rather just watched the Sid show than this movie.",1388102400,2,813,4.151898734177215
5450526,2,B00AMA8GH2,"We purchased this movie based on all of the ratings being 5 star, let alone how much our family, including our 4-year old daughter, enjoy the Sid series.
When we first discovered the Sid series, it was bit of a sensory overload with all that it throws at you.  However, we became accustomed to and appreciate one huge factor that this movie is lacking...adequate pause for our child to not only process what just took place.
This movie is non-stop ADHD, in my opinion.  Be wary of all the positive reviews.  While I respect each and every one of their reviews and ratings, this movie is not for us.
Let me put it this way.  Our girl has several videos that she asks to watch time and time again.  In the week since it was first watched, not once has our child asked to watch Sid the Movie.
If your child is accustomed to the frenetic pace and overload found on network TV, then this movie may be a good choice for you.
However, if your child enjoys the songs, the reflection time and the pace of the Sid series on PBS, then I would not recommend this movie.  It is far too much of a departure from the series in the ways described, which was too much for us.  Sorry Sid.",1378857600,25,1170,4.243243243243243

We like to expose the kids to movies that have at least some educational content and Sid made this one a home run!
