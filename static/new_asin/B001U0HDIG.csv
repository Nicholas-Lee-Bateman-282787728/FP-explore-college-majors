I put off buying it because I thought it might be over her head.  Nope.  Leave it to the Backyardigans to come up with such a playful, fun video!  We've had constant requests for ""Hoo hoo pie"" (Super Spy) from  her.  She especially loves the ""Lady in Pink"" dance and song.  All of our juice boxes have to be shaken, not stirred.  This video is clever enough I don't mind watching it with her!  The songs are snappy, the dancing is fun, and the overall theme is refreshing.  I'd highly recommend this video.",1257984000,,621,4.359649122807017
