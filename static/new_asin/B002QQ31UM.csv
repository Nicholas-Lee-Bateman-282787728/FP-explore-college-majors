8377864,4,B002QQ31UM,"It's been a number of years since I saw this on VHS, but I liked it when I had it.  As I recall, David talks through and demonstrates each exercise before it is performed by excellent dancers with the music.  All exercises are performed on both sides at the barre and in the center, so it is just like taking an intermediate level ballet class in the comfort of your home or at your convenience.  I believe you always get to see the whole dancer's body, not shots of their faces, which is completely useless (a la Melissa Lowe's second and third classes).  David makes helpful comments throughout and he is a fabulous teacher.

I give it four stars only because the video is a little dark and hazy.  Also, since I haven't seen the DVD version I don't feel I can give it five stars.  It is an excellent program if you have access to a large, uncarpeted dancing space and something that will work as a barre.  Also be sure to check out David Howard's Master Class II (previously known as Master Class B) and his Kultur Intermediate class. (That one is a much better class than Kultur's Beginner's class since all exercises are performed on both sides; it is just like taking a ballet class).",1269907200,2,1189,4.422018348623853
