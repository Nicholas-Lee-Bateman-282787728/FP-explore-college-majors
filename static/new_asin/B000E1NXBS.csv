2480700,4,B000E1NXBS,"This movie is pretty funny and it was Lloyd Bridges last movie.
It reminds me of the movie Daddy's Dying-Whose Got The Will?
Fast moving and enjoyable.",1362096000,,151,4.62962962962963
2480701,2,B000E1NXBS,"This movie was a reasonably entertaining comedy up until the last 5 minutes, nothing special but certainly not bad, then came the ending which made no sense and seemed tacked on. I would recommend skipping this one.",1223769600,,215,4.837837837837838
2480702,3,B000E1NXBS,"I think that writer-director Peter Gould and his fellow filmmakers intended that this 1998 movie should be a comedy, sort of a down South version of MEET THE PARENTS.  Unfortunately, though the potential is there for a hilarious romp, neither the script, the direction, nor the actors are very funny.

I'm not saying that the actors aren't good (They are.) or that the film doesn't have other merits (It does.).  It's just that the people involved don't appear to have that special gift for doing comedy, thus we're given a straight light drama with several missed opportunities for laughter.

Josh Charles plays a struggling Los Angeles Jewish novelist who travels to Georgia to meet the family of his girl friend (Alexandra Wentworth).  These include her ailing, cantankerous, bigoted father (Lloyd Bridges in his final film role) and her brothers, Walter Olkewicz and Beau Bridges.

What was supposed to be a two-day visit with Alexandra's family turns into a two-week nightmare, with Charles finding himself having to virtually baby-sit Bridges for the entire time.

Though he looks shockingly ill, Bridges still manages to steal every scene in which he appears.

Kristy Swanson co-stars.  The ending of this film might surprise you.

2480703,5,B000E1NXBS,I came across this movie on cable and could not stop watching. It is quirky and crazy. I am from the south so it rang very true to me. Try it.,1172707200,2,142,3.6129032258064515

8104062,2,B000E1NXBS,"Heavens. How slow can you go?

I really enjoy Lloyd Bridges, but I couldn't make it past the first 15 minutes of the film. I quit after what felt like an hour of snail paced lame accented junk. Turns out it was only 14+ minutes. Good heavens! It's that bad.

Interesting to note, I've seen the name Ali Wentworth put forth as a female comic recently (2015) but I have zero remembrance of her. She even did a Jerry Seinfeld Cars with Coffee episode last year. I'd never heard of her, can't remember seeing her, etc. Well, she's in this. And it's bad. I trust her career and or her talent go far beyond this rather awful start of a film (to be fair, I cut just before 15min), but her southern belle shtick was disappointing. Has she been to the south? (I really don't know her at all, but holy bleep, does she know southern families? She acts like a new yorker playing a southerner) There was nothing redeeming within the first 15 min. Which is roughly 20% of a 75 min total run time.

Hey producers, don't waste the opener. Hey fans, just pass on this. If you like some of these characters, see them in something else.",1435363200,,1117,4.309523809523809
