2254484,1,B0007Z9R66,"I purchased this movie and previously purchased a Vizio television with an AMAZON VIDEO App that includes an ""Amazon"" BUTTON on the remote control - PURCHASED not rented - in reliance on the availability of this AND MANY OTHER MOVIES for viewing by my PERMANENTLY DEVELOPMENTALLY DISABLED 26 YEAR OLD daughter on the AMAZON Video App on the remote because she is not, as a consequence of her disability, able to maneuver screens and log-ins on a television.  In fact, I have purchased over 140 (ONE HUNDRED FORTY) movies on Amazon Video in reliance on her ability to view them on her television, which she is not able to do on other televisions we own, such as Sony televisions, having complex menu systems.  Now, TODAY, JUNE 15, 2016, Amazon has decided to discontinue support of Amazon Video on her Vizio television and instead wants me to buy a Firestick for $50, which she will undoubtedly be unable to use!  This is fraud.  This is likely also a violation of the Americans with Disabilities Act, and just bad business!!!!!! Do not BUY ANY AMAZON VIDEOS unless you intend to purchase a new television every year to keep up with Amazon's unscrupulous and fraudulent business practices.",1465948800,,1188,4.8088235294117645

This time Marnie has put together a program to try and bring the human world and the monster world together, with her family's magic on the line. Sound easy? Marnie is to look over a group of ""exchange"" students from Halloweentown that are trying to blend in with the humans, while keeping an eye out for knights lurking in the shadows that are trying to make sure Marnie and her family will lose their magic for good.

If you've never seen them and are an adult, you may not want to buy them as they are not the best acting. You have to remember they are aimed for kids. I just have always loved them. If you have kids or grew up watching Disney movies, then these are for you!",1380844800,,372,3.8947368421052633
2254774,5,B0007Z9R66,"""Halloweentown High"" is the last in the series (there's another sequel following this) to feature Kimberly J. Brown as Marnie, the teen witch. In this installment, it has been three years since the events in Kalabar's Revenge aka Halloweentown II. Marnie is now in high school and proposes that some of the teen inhabitants of Halloweentown be allowed to attend Marnie's high school in the mortal world as a way of promoting friendship between the mortal world and Halloweentown. The Witches' Council which Marnie approaches with her idea is initially reluctant to give their consent because the members are fearful as to what might happen should the Knights of the Iron Dagger find out. The Knights are devoted to destroying all things magical. Unfortunately, the stakes are high as Marnie bets all her Cromwell magic that things will work out. Trouble is, if things turn sour by Halloween Eve, then Marnie and her entire family stand to lose their magical powers.

This third installment is just as fun as the other two in the series. Marnie's grandmother Aggie (the delightful Debbie Reynolds) is a hoot and gets into some funny situations at Marnie's school where Aggie takes up a substitute position teaching Science. The Halloweentown students are disguised as humans so that they don't scare off the humans, and there's even a love interest storyline featuring Marnie's budding romance with Cody. All in all this movie is great fun for the entire family and is one of those Halloween movies which is kid-friendly (I'd say seven and up if only so that the child will be able to follow the storyline and not be afraid of the weird make-up and stuff).",1380758400,3,1655,4.889679715302491

Marnie is brought to the Halloweentown Witches' Council and asks to bring a group of Halloweentown students to her own high school in the mortal world. If she does not prove that mortals and Halloweentown creatures can co-exist, the Cromwells will lose their magic at midnight on Halloween.

2254822,5,B0007Z9R66,"I personally am a Halloweentown fan and love all of the movies. I loved Halloweentown and the sequel a lot. I actually liked Halloweentown better than the sequel as Kal casts the grey spell and turns everything of halloweentown and everyone grey and boring and Aggy and Marni try to stop it. My favorite part was when, they defeated Kal and they could open the portal and get back into the mortal world. A great ending.

Then there's halloweentown II. I found that it wasn't as great as Halloweentown, but I loved it. I like it 'cause it's not too scary that you're tempted to turn it off. It contains some scariness, magic use, comedy and fun activity! Both Halloweentown and the sequel contained these features.

Next comes Halloweentown High. Marni moves on to High School, as well as her brother. Aggy then brings some halloweentown creatures to the Highschool in the mortal world. I like this movie 99 percent, Halloweentown II, 100 percent, Halloweentown, 110 percent. I will say, Halloweentown 1 and 2 pretty much stole it! Halloweentown High had great features, but it wasn't as warm, sweet and as much of a good story as the first 2 movies had. Still, I was very proud with it and enjoy it very, very, very much. But Halloweentown 1 and 2 still were by 3-4 percent better.

Also there's Return to Halloweentown without Kimberly J. Brown - but with Sara Paxton, the great actress.
This movie was actually my third favorite of the four halloweentown movies. Halloweentown 1, 2 and Return to Halloweentown are my three favorites. Halloweentown 1 goes in first place, the sequel goes in second place, and Return to Halloweentown is in third. Halloweentown High is in fourth.
The reason why I like Return to Halloweentown so much is because, Marni is now moving on to College and learning more, facing more and it's getting even more challenging. She tries her hardest to face them by getting the powerful necklace from her Grandma when she was her age (or older) when she goes back in time in Halloweentown. In the end, the awful spell that was casted - was now un-casted and it sailed right into a very happy ending.
A lot of scary, funny, magic, thrilling things throughout the whole entire movie. Great for family halloween parties or events/get-togethers as a nice movie with popcorn, leftover candy from Trick-or-Treating and apple cider.

All four of the Halloweentown movies have thrilled me so much. I keep watching them over and over. They are so fun to watch on halloween or any time! It is the best Disney Halloween movie ever made! I encourage you SO MUCH to buy every one of the Halloweentown movies. You'll never get tired of these halloween-favorites!",1223078400,,2671,4.75

The first two movies have scenes that are a little too intense for my 8 year old daughter.  Halloweentown High has enough ""monsters"" to make it exciting for my 11 year old son and 15 year old daughter, but nothing too creepy for the 8 year old to handle.  The story (the attempt to keep those who are different from being descriminated against) has a very good message as well.

In addition to being a perfect Halloween movie for the whole family, the ""extras"" section has some terrific ideas for Halloween party games.  I definitely recommend this move - and Amazon offers it at a great price.",1188172800,,754,4.45985401459854

2254841,4,B0007Z9R66,"I can't get enough of Halloweetown and it's inhabitants. It was fun to see how the young stars of the first film have grown up, though not quite a shock with Kimberly J. Brown. I've been a fan of hers for years. But onto the review. HH is an awesome movie, though I wish that they would've actually gone to Halloweentown in it. It was fun seeing Marnie in school. The problems that she faced trying to keep her friends from finding out about her and her friends from Halloweentown were hilarious. Marnie's powers are tremendously more advanced in Halloweentown High than they were in the other two movies, though her spells don't always have the desired effect most of the time. She tries to make a magical set of rooms in her house but ends up shrinking the house instead. A skeleton is attacking someone and Marnie tries the spell that her grandmother uses to make something go away but ends up only making the skeleton several times larger. There were only two things that I didn't like about the movie. One, there was no commentary track by the cast, and two, the audio is 5.1 surround sound. If you don't have a surround sound system, the sound will be compressed which can make the volume get a bit softer in places. I don't have a 5.1 system yet, but I'm hoping. If you're any kind of fan of Halloween or Kimberly J. Brown, get this movie, along with the first two and enjoy the holidays !",1129420800,7,1396,4.4147286821705425

The adventures of Halloween could never be this fun. It has all the cool things in it. Monsters,witches and all types of things for children. Even though now i'm 16 i still watch all the Halloweentown movies. I hope they make a 4th one. I think parents and younger children should watch all of the movies.",1128729600,4,462,4.144444444444445

We watched them over and over; therefore when they became available to purchase, we were very excited.  These are good, clean, fun Halloween movies.  We highly recommend them.",1127952000,3,341,4.827586206896552
2254844,5,B0007Z9R66,"The Halloweentown Trilogy is just as entertaining for adults as it is for children. I began to wonder if Disney would or could tie  up the Halloween tales with a third and final installment. I can honestly say that once I got over the fact that the young cast had grown considerbly, I was happy to note that the storyline was just as entertaining as the others.  Much praise goes to their writing team!! Disney has truly made modern classics out of these.  The special affect of Grandma Aggie's bag turning into a crocodile is quite a computerized jump from the less sophisticated bag in the first movie.  But all the movies seemed to have their own area of computerized magic.

It would be hard to choose favorites out of the three.  They are all so wonderful, but if I had to:  Halloweentown would be my favorite with Halloweentown High second and Kalabar's Revenge coming in a very close third.  Nothing beats the excitement and sense of  childhood adventure that could be experienced in the premier movie.  But, Disney has out done themselves on giving each installment it's own unique storyline to capture the viewer's attention.

This is a nice clean trilogy with no gore or verbal language to worry about. I do not consider it one of those teeny bopper High School movies, since High School is just the setting not the true story line.  I do wonder why Sophie's character was cut back more and not involved in the problem solving part of this movie  as compared to others. (Maybe her schedule was not as open for her to come back?)  The storyline did NOT suffer from this though.  It was a joy to see the entire cast back together again.  I am very happy to finally get a dvd set of these movies, since the only way I have watched them is taped off Disney.  I will watch them a hundred more times!!!!  I highly recommend this trilogy to families and school Halloween parties everywhere!",1127001600,14,1893,4.550295857988166
2254845,3,B0007Z9R66,"Halloweentown High is the third in the trilogy of Halloweentown films that began in 1998.  All of the main characters from the first two years are back including Debbie Reynolds as Aggie Cromwell and Judith Hoag as the mom and reluctant witch.  It's six years later and Marnie Piper(Kimberly Brown) is now pretty well grown up and now in high school and has become a very skilled witch.  Marnie and her grandmother Aggie bring several young teens from Halloweentown to the mortal world and disguise them as everyday teens so they can attend school and learn about the mortal world.  But a new villain is not happy about this plan and does everything he can to foul up the plan.

As with the first two films the affects are very good for a TV movie.  Marnie really takes center stage in this movie at the expense of both Reynolds and Hoag.  This hurts the film because the great thing about the first two was how the whole family was working together to battle the villain.  Add to that a bit too much time is spent on Marnie's love interest and also that the Halloween ""feel"" isn't as strong as in the first two.  It's not a bad film, but certainly not as good as the others.",1126742400,3,1175,4.402777777777778

This flim is a bit more darker with the Iron Knights out threathen all things magic and letting kids of halloweentown vist the mortal world. It a tale of a family always stick together to get though the hard times that lie ahead. The actors/actress who played in this flim did a marvolus job, I though. The Stoyline is Fantasic too.
