8329821,2,B000CR7U5Y,"This production, although it provides some information, is not what i expected from reading some of the other reviews. Some of the clips are repeated and , although there is ample opportunity to give better insight in the wine production( even on an amateur level) in Burgundy, nothing really is provided. It is a quite basic production and the production is, with some minor exceptions, quite amateurish. Particularly for people with some basic understanding of the Burgundian wine culture this is not a DVD worth purchasing. It shows some of the techniques, but nothing is ever explained. The interviews are basically like all other interviews with winemakers across the wine producing World. Nothing new or exciting.",1258761600,,719,5.206896551724138
8329822,5,B000CR7U5Y,"As a French woman now living in the U.S.A., I find this is a really special documentary. The filmmaker found a special way to translate ideas that are deep in the local culture without being dramatic or overdetermined. The film captures a real feel for life around wineries in my country that is rarely expressed -- it shows a poetry and history, but also a humor and a sensation.  I recommend it highly not just as a film about winemakers, but also as a documentary about French culture.",1232841600,,488,4.545454545454546
8329823,5,B000CR7U5Y,"I was very impressed at the filmic quality of this documentary and the sensitive human portraits of the region. Not a big wine connoisseur myself, I feel much more educated about the process from an emotional as well as intellectual level. I highly recommend it.",1204243200,,262,4.844444444444444
8329824,5,B000CR7U5Y,"What an original and beautiful film! It has a wignette style
that is very different from a run-of-the-mill program on wine.
It is much more about things that take place in wineries and
about the winemakers in Burgundy in relation to
their lives, than about the product. I loved it!",1204243200,3,281,4.64
8329825,1,B000CR7U5Y,"Poorly made documentary which does not give much insights into the wines of burgundy. It basically does interviews of several Burgundy legends including Aubert de Villaine of DRC, Henri Jayer and Jacques Seysses.
Nothing educational about it at all. Dispointing! Just like a poorly made bottle of Grand Cru. Would not recommend this even to your worst enemy!",1199664000,,358,5.189655172413793

I originally saw it at a screening in Chicago and, as a wine lover,  was expecting a pleasant tour through a beloved region. On one level  the film delivers that, but so much more is going on here. It's remarkable how deeply this director understands viniculture -- even connoisseurs stand to learn from Coover's film. Beyond the technology and economics of production and the finesse of enjoyment, there is wine-making as a way of life, rooted in local traditions and family histories, constantly challenged in a rapidly changing world. What's particularly intriguing about the film is that it tells the story of winemaking in Burgundy with great attention to the unique details of the region, but in a way that provokes us to see how this story relates to many others about gradual transformations in traditions and social practices.

The film doesn't engage in polemics, nor does it offer simple answers. No doubt some will find fault with this. And there are legitimate complaints to be made about some rough transitions, interviews that could have been more extensive, and a few loose threads here and there. But these are small complaints. This is a well-made film, beautifully shot and edited with skill and clear purpose. In abstaining from moralizing, Coover allows the audience to see what is really there, lingering on the rich texture of Burgundy life, and then challenges us to think seriously about how such a way of life comes to be, is understood, and changes over time. I highly recommend it.",1134691200,13,1584,4.943609022556391
