4329167,5,B004CT4U7Y,"Man, what a beautiful soul this guy has; we are blessed to have Matisyahu with us. Check out Matis with the PS22 chorus ,on you tube clip, singing ""one day"".",1346716800,,157,4.266666666666667
4329168,5,B004CT4U7Y,This DVD is beautifully shot and edited.  All of the Dub Trio boys as well as Matisyahu have great things to say in the extras.  I play this ALL the time.  It's like having my own private Matisyahu concert in my home.  Why just play the album when you can watch it too?  The only thing is that Darkness into Light did not make it onto the DVD and that was my favorite song of the past tour...  Oh well.  Worth every second and every penny anyway.,1329868800,,446,4.057471264367816
4329169,5,B004CT4U7Y,"If you are a Matisyahu fan you will love this. If you love about 10 different musical genre's you will love this as well because Matisyahu performs about 10 different musical styles during this performance. I don't love the video in this film,not because of quality but due to difficulty seeing what is going on from stage lighting and affects but in every other way I couldn't be happier. I play the video over and over letting play loudly as I go about my daily work on my days off.
  Listening to Matisyahu you feel the depth of his emotion that comes through in the songs. He certainly goes against the grain of commercial music and does what he feels he's called to do, refreshing in a time of do anything for a buck. The music on here is inspiring,and moves me in a time when I need inspiration. I was lucky enough to obtain second row tickets for the Matisyahu unplugged at the Gillioz Theater in November. I can't wait to see him live.",1318291200,,943,4.382857142857143

4329171,5,B004CT4U7Y,I thought the first one was good...that was the reggae version.  Here's the hard rock version...total win!! Buy it now!!,1299974400,,120,5.0
4329172,5,B004CT4U7Y,"I cannot speak to the production quality of this DVD at all as it has not been released yet.  What I can say is this: I have been to many concerts in my lifetime, and none have compared to this.  The temperature soared over the 100's and it was nearly 100% humidity due to threatening rain clouds.  We were packed in tight as sardines and the pungent aroma of smoke (both tobacco and ""other"") was nearly unavoidable in the amphitheater at Stubb's in downtown Austin.  And despite this, the crowd was so mesmerized by the concert that nobody noticed how miserable it was until days later.

Matisyahu did a good job choosing songs, focusing mostly on tracks from albums released after the epic Stubb's volume 1, without neglecting fan favorites such as ""King Without a Crown"".  If you are a stickler for new material, there is only one fully ""new"" song on this DVD, but the interpretations of the previously released material are often so different from the original that it's like hearing a new song.  ""Mist Rising"", a re-imagining of the previously recorded ""Ancient Lullaby"" is so far from its original as to warrant a title change.  Highlights are the combination of ""Rastaman Chant/One Day"", the final track with ""King Without a Crown"" and some stage diving, and of course the ten-minute opus magnum of all his beat-boxing work, including an homage to ""Gonna Make you Sweat"" by C+C Music Factory.

If the concert was any indication, this DVD will be a must-have for any real fan and even casual fans will get a kick out of it.  Here's to hoping we'll be able to purchase a BLU-RAY version!!!",1291075200,4,1594,4.660714285714286
8423628,5,B004CT4U7Y,"I absolutely love this concert!! I remember just randomly coming across it on tv and just got lost in the music. The song One Day is perfection and if you want to enjoy a great show, then get this.",1521763200,,197,4.076923076923077
