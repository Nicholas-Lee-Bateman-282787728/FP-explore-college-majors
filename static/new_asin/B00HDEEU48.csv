6154215,4,B00HDEEU48,"If you have a child who has never seen a foreign film, this would be a great one to start with! Belle and Sebastian is a French movie, by Nicholas Vanier, with English subtitles.

Belle and Sebastian is about a young boy, Sebastian and the friendship he makes with Belle, a large dog. She is being blamed for killing the sheep in the village. In fact, the villagers call her the beast.

The movie is set in Nazi-occupied France. There are refugees in the village always escaping at night over the snow-covered mountains into Switzerland. Sebastian is told to stay away from both this part of the mountain and the beast. But, he cant resist. He finds and tries to protect the beast, who he names Belle.
Sebastian meets up with Belle every day and they run in the fields and play in the snow. He shows her places to hide from the angry villagers and from the German Nazi soldiers. She is Sebastians friend and he believes that it is not her who is killing the sheep.

The scenery in this film is incredible! The snow-covered mountains, grassy hillsides, waterfalls, rocks and panoramic vistas will take your breath away. There are lots of aerial shots in the film that make you wish you lived in France.
Parents should know that there is some drinking, lying and cursing, but the characters are trying to do their best given the given circumstances. It cant be easy having your little village be taken over by soldiers. Over-all, the message this movie gives is a good one. ""Protect your friends and always try to do the right thing.""

I recommend this movie for ages ten to eighteen. This is a great age level to introduce appreciation of sub-titled movies. I give Belle and Sebastian four out of five stars for amazing scenery and great acting. This is Katie G. reporting for KIDS FIRST!",1421193600,5,1787,4.575
6154216,5,B00HDEEU48,"A film set in the French Alps in WWII featuring an orphan boy and a misunderstood dog and Jews trying to escape the Nazis -- well, what's not to love if you have a heart?  The scenes are often dark, cold, and dangerous, so I was breathless through much of the movie.  The magnificent mountain scenery is a striking counterpoint to the poignancy of the story.  The plot could have been ruined with sentimentality and cliche situations, but it is way too sophisticated for that.  The subtitles are actually good, which is not always the case.  This film was featured on the last day of the Film Fest in Indianapolis in 2014, though that's not where I saw it.",1420588800,,656,4.4789915966386555
6154217,5,B00HDEEU48,a truly amazing movie .......  an emotional roller coaster !!!,1420243200,,62,5.2
6154218,5,B00HDEEU48,"Amazon doesn't seem to have the English language release version of this great movie, but there is one that gives you the option to watch the film in its original language (French) or dubbed in English.  In either language you can watch subtitles in English too if you want.  The English language adds a bit of a comical feel to the watching experience as obviously lips don't always match the voice, or the English translator speaks really fast to try and make the words finish before the lips do.  The film makers have beautifully captured the stunning scenery of the French Alps throughout this film.  Granted the dog, once the kid gives it a bath in the river, is probably a bit too clean a white to be completely believable as a wild creature but it does look good against the backdrop.

Even though this is set in the occupation by German troops days, deals with Jewish people being smuggled across the Alps into Switzerland, and the dog is in danger of being shot by locals who blame it for some livestock killings, it is clearly made to be viewed by little kids as well and at no time do you ever actually feel anyone (or the dog) is in any danger of being killed.  Which is a plus and a minus I suppose. Similar dumbing down the reality of war that The Book Thief did so kids can just focus on the lead child character (and dog in this case).

It is always refreshing to see kids being able to go out and explore their surroundings, you can imagine if this happened today, even without the war stuff going on, Sebastian wouldn't be allowed out his front door, let alone to explore the mountains and befriend a large dog.",1419206400,3,1629,4.41
6154219,5,B00HDEEU48,"Best movie I have seen all year. Stunning scenery; simple, sweet story; amazing dog! The French subtitles don't interfere at all - in fact the original language gives the movie both credibility and pathos. Surely the untamed and tamed dog are different animals, but that's forgiven!",1417564800,9,282,5.1521739130434785
6154220,5,B00HDEEU48,Item as described and timely delivered.  Beautiful scenery and sweet story - we are fans of Great Pyrenees so we appreciated some of the idiosyncratic behaviors and impressed by the dogs' performance.,1417392000,6,200,5.25
6154221,5,B00HDEEU48,"The setting was impossible to describe is beauty was one i can't explain.

6154222,5,B00HDEEU48,"""Belle et Sbastien"" (English captions) was submitted by France for the 2014 Seattle International Film Festival. We had young invitees from six local schools in attendance and that always enhances my experience. How perfectly splendid that their first taste of the festival should be this winning story about a boy and his dog! They could relate to his point of view, the story is captivating, there is plenty of humor, we saw white-knuckle drama, and everyone had plenty of folks to root for...always a plus!

Nicolas Vanier from Senegal directed this story about an orphan boy raised in the Pyrenees, the impossibly beautiful mountain range with France to the north and Spain to the south. The cinematography by Eric Guichard is breathtaking! We loved the marmots, rabbits, boar, elk, wolves and chamois, particularly the baby chamois that is stranded after its mother is shot in those thrilling opening scenes.

Here is the cast:
  * Tchky Karyo plays Csar, a grouchy old mountain man who drinks too much. He wants to shoot la bte that has been killing sheep. He's sure the beast is a feral dog who escaped its brutal master in a neighboring village.
  * Flix Bossuet is Sbastien, an adventurous six-year-old boy; our little hero has been told that his absent mother has gone to America, ""just over those mountains."" He befriends that stray dog and does not think she kills sheep. BTW, she is a Great Pyrenees and that breed is well known for its fearless protection of its flocks.
  * Dimitri Storoge is Docteur Guillaume, the heroic Resistance fighter who guides Jewish refugees on their way to the Swiss border. (He can also fix a dog that has been shot!)
  * Andreas Pietschmann brings us Lieutenant Peter, a handsome German officer we come to fear...but he really admires that lovely young woman in the bakery where he demands a weekly supply of bread for his troops.
  * Margaux Chtelier makes an irresistible Anglina, who tells the German officer, ""Soldiers fight wars, they don't plunder bakeries!"" She also knows her way around those mountains.

This inspiring story is a charming homage to the live-action films of Disney, but I could see that the pulse-pounding World War II subplot thrilled those kids in the audience today. Me too!!! This should soon be available in Region 1 format at Amazon.",1403913600,12,2309,4.874680306905371
6154223,5,B00HDEEU48,if you don't like dubbing buy the dvd or bluray as they offer no dubbing or subtitles only .  watch the film not the lips and get the story from the actors actions or emotions. you will not get selection of dubbing or subtitles on amazon video.,1500249600,,244,4.191489361702128

6154225,5,B00HDEEU48,"Some people complained of english dubbing - well, I personally prefer *watching* a film, rather than having to *read* it. Further - the acting was done much by expression. The artist wanted you to sense what was happening in the lives of the people. In fact, I hardly noticed the dubbing at all! For one thing it was a wonderful story. Thoroughly enjoyable. In an age where violence is lauded and filthy speech permeates everything, this was a fresh escape. Bring your children and those who love goodness and righteousness to this movie. A very nice ending too. Awesome!",1499299200,2,571,4.777777777777778

6154237,3,B00HDEEU48,"Great scenery.  Good  story  Beautiful dog, beautiful boy.  But the whole effect is nearly ruined by the horrible  English translation and English dubbing.  I finally muted it to continue watching so I didn't have to hear trite idiotic phrases like German soldiers saying ""the scoundrels are getting away!""  referring to a family of Jews fleeing over the mountains to Switzerland.  Nicely dramatic moments with the 3 Stooges supplying the writing. Would have much preferred it left in the original language and some accurately translated dubbing.",1487980800,,546,5.341176470588235

6154242,5,B00HDEEU48,A far cry from the cartoon series that was on Nickelodeon. Although never read any of the books about this amazing team I'm pretty sure since this was a French film based on French book series they stuck pretty much to the books. Completely in English There were scenes that I didn't like due to my fear of heights. It's a great family film worth watching numerous times and to own. So go out there after seeing it here and Buy this and start up own collection of outstanding family fun movies.,1486512000,,494,4.380434782608695

6154249,3,B00HDEEU48,"As others have mentioned, great scenery but terrible dubbing. Overall though, a good movie for older kids -- some scenes may be too intense for younger ones like the hunt for and shooting of the dog and confrontations with Nazis (mostly verbal but still needs commentary), even the avalanche. One scene that was inappropriate for a kids' movie involved a young woman's cleavage showing as she bends over when a man enters the room - totally unnecessary. Other scenes that probably needs explanation to kids -  the boy saying he will ""never forgive you"" to his adoptive father, the father lying to him about his biological mother, etc etc. Overall a good film to enjoy with older kids with reservations as above.",1485388800,,711,4.827868852459017

6154256,5,B00HDEEU48,Beautiful movie.  It's a struggle these days that I can find something suitable to watch with my children.  This is more than suitable - it is a fine piece of cinematic art and an encouraging story perfect for inspiring a boy or girl to greater deeds.  Also was a good opener for historical discussion with my 9 year old.  It rose far above the typical kid movie themes and introduced foreign places and natural beauty.  Excellent.

6154341,2,B00HDEEU48,"Although the scenery was wonderful, the story was handled in an entirely predictable, uninspired and simple-minded fashion which isn't likely to engage most adults. The acting also left much to be desired.  Kids might relate to the bond between the child and dog, but might also find some of the other characters unsettling.  The film is described as being based on a successful children's book; perhaps in that medium it was more effective.",1459555200,,441,5.027397260273973

6154350,5,B00HDEEU48,"Breathtaking views of the French countryside where they meet the mountains of the Alps. Enjoyed the variety of European wildlife and sheep, and the ""eagles"" view from the sky. I felt like I had taken a trip to the boy's village- seeing the regional clothing, dwellings built into the hillsides,  the life of a sheepherder, the stress the quiet village felt when the Nazis came. In the midst of this is a sometimes far-fetched tale of a boy and his friendship with a muddy ""wild"" dog, who turns out to be a gentle and noble Great Pyrenees- a fitting breed for this setting. The viewer can forgive some of the story-line which is more than made up for with the wonderful cinematography of the dog, natural wonders, the animal shots and satisfying ending. You cannot help feel that the dog truly is a boy's best friend and a valuable asset to those who live close to nature, with all it's dangers.",1457568000,,894,4.552795031055901

It's impossible not to like a movie about the friendship between a child and a dog, but this one stands out for its perfect casting (the boy's grin is absolutely infectious and can bring a smile to the face of the grimmest person on earth, and of course the dog is amazing), gorgeous location (the breathtaking Alps), a heartwarming story, and the most beautiful soundtrack. The first time time I heard the theme song I was hooked; now I can't get it out of my head after watching the movie. Love it!

The story focuses on loyalty, bravery, heroism and trust. The scenery is beautiful and the cinematography is very good. The original language is French and if the actors used for the English dubbing were a little bit better, I would have given it five stars. But don't let that deter you from watching this film. Suspense, mystery, plot twists, revelations and surprises along the way make this a great all round movie for everyone. Dog lovers especially will fall in love with Belle and her relationship with Sebastian. Even if you're not a big dog fan, this movie might change your mind.

It's the first time I noticed a movie starring a Great Pyrenees, so I gave the movie a try. I believe this movie was originally spoken in French, it was voiced over in English. They did a good job voicing it over, and the movie was an interesting and nice story. The relationship between the boy(Sebastian) and the dog(Belle) made this movie very sweet.

6154464,4,B00HDEEU48,"Belle and Sebastian (Belle et Sbastien) may not be the greatest French film ever made, but Nicolas Vaniers family picture has a few fine things that only this adventurist-turned-director can offer: stunningly beautiful nature of the Alps, realistic descriptions of the people living there, and a likable protagonist Sbastien, a six-year-old boy, who befriends a dog Belle.

Set in 1943, the film is basically about Sbastien (Flix Bossuet), an orphan boy living with his adoptive grandfather Csar (Tchky Karyo) and Csars daughter Anglina (Margaux Chtelier) living in the Alps. One day Sbastien meets Belle, a wild dog mistakenly believed to be the Beast by the villagers. Their friendship begins. This is the most appealing part of the movie.

For the new version the filmmakers decided to add another material to the story. A German army arrives at the quiet village to capture the refugees trying to cross the mountains. Nicolas Vanier wisely avoids any violent content in furthering the added story, which is a good thing. But I am not sure that the original storyline needed this episode, which is neither suspenseful nor dramatic enough.

The original novel Belle and Sebastian, written by Ccile Aubry, was turned into a French TV series of the same title (19651970), which starred Aubrys son Mehdi as Sebastian. For the new film Mehdi appears briefly in a cameo role as hunter named Andr. The location is changed to the French Alps, and so is the purpose of the boys journey with the dog.

Belle and Sebastian is an above average family picture with beautiful photography and capable acting from the cast, but the adult audiences might feel there is still something missing here.",1445731200,,1684,5.025089605734767

6154665,4,B00HDEEU48,"Belle and Sebastian was originally a novel by the French actress and writer, Ccile Aubry. The story was very popular and was made into a French live-action series in 1965. Oddly, it later was a Japanese anime in the 1980s and now is a French film. Although the story is quite popular in France, I'd never heard of it and I cannot compare this film in any way to the other projects. The anime, series or book could be a lot better or worseI just don't know.

This film is set during WWII in the French Alps. Sebastian is a 6 year- old boy who lives with his adopted grandfather and his niece. The boy is amazingly independent and resourcefuland as the film progresses you marvel at the kid's courage and tenacity. Initially you see it when the men of the village go off in search of an animal that is killing sheep. They assume it's a dog that has gone feral and they are determined to kill it. One day, Sebastian is walking in the hills and encounters the dogand this Great Pyrenees doesn't seem particularly aggressive and the boy stands there and calmly talks to it. When the boy sees the dog again later, he even gets the dog to allow him to pet him and soon the pair are friends. But, the men have vowed to kill this animal and when Grandpa sees the animal, Sebastian goes so far as to stand in front of the dog to shield it from the gun. This is a good thing because later, it turns out that it's NOT this dog that is harming the sheep. Additionally, towards the end of the film, the dog turns out to be a serious blessing. But, what that is and how he helps saves some lives is something best seen by you.

Although this film has some Nazis in it, the film is appropriate for all ages. The violence is not too extreme and the film is similar in style to the old movie ""Lassie Come Home""charming and family-oriented entertainment. The star of Belle and Sebastian clearly is the location and the cinematography. It's rare to ever see a film so beautiful and the film truly is breathtaking. Additionally, you really have to admire the cast and crew for working some pretty extreme conditions to bring us the movie. Well worth seeingparticularly if you are looking for something you won't be ashamed to show your kids or mother!",1440979200,15,2230,4.371084337349398

The background music is also very good. The one thing that detracts very much from the experience is the dubbed voices. My husband commented that the voices were ""too American"".

6154751,3,B00HDEEU48,"I would likely give this more stars but the overwhelming problem with it, is that it is dubbed and dubbed horribly!  The voices that were used for these characters are so unbelievably bad it's like it was done as a joke.  And I'd be interested in seeing if the translation would have been different if it had been subtitled.
Now that I've gotten that out of the way, the whole reason I watched this is because I've had Pyrs for 30 years and therefore when I saw the picture of Belle I wanted to watch this film.  Belle is beautiful and the story of what a great character she is is perfect for someone like me who adores these fine beasts.  The story of Belle and Sebastian is very endearing.  I'm not familiar with the children's books these two come from so I actually tried to find one but haven't had luck yet.
I would recommend this movie as a good family movie(kids will probably like the voices), dog lover movie, Pyr lover movie or anyone who can appreciate a movie for both its badness; as in its dubbing- and goodness; as in its sweetness.",1440374400,3,1049,4.358974358974359

6154868,4,B00HDEEU48,"When I saw this new release from Film Movement - Belle and Sebastian - I just knew it was one I had to watch. As with all Film Movement releases, it was a featured film at many festivals and was the Grand Prize Best Film at the New York International Children's Film Festival.

My now twenty something son absolutely adored the cartoon series about a boy and his giant white dog. We had a very large white Alaskan Malamute at the time and I know he played out many adventures with Murphy in the backyard.

The film takes place in 1943 in the French Alps. Sebastian lives with an old shepherd named Cesar.  The village is worried about a 'beast' who has been attacking the local flocks and have vowed to kill it. Young Sebastian comes across the dog the villagers are seeking and instead, befriends it. The dog becomes Sebastian's protector. For there is danger in the village - the Nazis have occupied it - and the villagers are moving Jewish refugees across the border into Switzerland. You guessed it - Belle and Sebastian are a part of that.

This is such a great movie for families. There's danger, adventure and of course a dog who is so very special. Who wouldn't want to imagine themselves as Sebastian? Prepare to have your heartstrings tugged. (For younger viewers, please take not that there are some some animals killed as part of the story.)

The movie is worth watching for the scenery alone - the views and vistas of the French Alps are absolutely magnificent. The scenes shot in the snow are real - and just as magnificent.

Young Flix Bossuet is such a natural actor. His lines were believable and his facial and body language also spoke volumes. It was easy to believe him as just a boy and his dog. Tchky Karyo plays 'grandfather' Cesar. I had literally just watched him in the television series The Missing and enjoyed his performance. I thought he did a great job in this film as well. And a review of the actors would not be complete without mentioning the dog - well trained and perfect casting!

Families watching with children will likely choose the English dubbing. It seemed a bit off to me in the beginning, but wasn't badly done at all. I did find that of the dialogue could have used a bit more editing before being used  - some of the phrases and language just didn't seem to fit the time and place. I chose to watch with the subtitles instead. There's a 30 minute plus feature included on the making of the film as well.

Director Nicolas Vanier did a great job of bringing Cecile Aubry's classic book to the screen and a new audience. And now I'm going to pass my copy on to that twenty-something son....",1438300800,,2636,4.48643006263048

6154872,5,B00HDEEU48,"Nicholas Vanier directed this adaptation of C&eacute;cile Aubrys novel (adaptation and screenplay by director Vanier with Juliette Sales and Fabien Suarez) n a film that is in both French and German with English subtitles. The result is a film for the heart  a reminder that during the atrocities of WW II there were moments of meaningful relationships, especially between animals and people (remember War Horse?).

The film is set during WWII in the snowy Alps of occupied France, on the border of Switzerland. Six year old S&eacute;bastien (F&eacute;lix Bossuet), raised and adopted by his grandfather, is lonely and dreaming of the day his mother will return from America for him. He befriends an enormous yet gentle sheepdog Belle who quickly becomes his best friend and protector. With Nazis in the village rooting out the resistance fighters helping Jewish refugees cross the border, Belle and S&eacute;bastiens loyalty to each other and the village that has embraced them both will be put to the test.

The scenery is magnificent and the acting by the young and gifted F&eacute;lix Bossuet is extraordinary. It is a moment of devotion and love and caring and protection during WW II that creates a strong sense of caring about the true meaning of friendship.

Needless to say, she loved the movie.  We had to pause a few times to explain the historical context, but it gave us a great opportunity to discuss some of the background of WWII.  That being said, while the movie does have some heavier subplots, it is a great family film with wonderful scenery and ultimately uplifting messages.
I was a little distracted by the English dub and would have preferred to have the option to view in French with English subtitles, but for younger audiences, I don't think there will be any complaints.  This is one movie we'll be purchasing on DVD/Blu-Ray",1435276800,,735,4.580152671755725

We all grow older, but this story never grows old, and will remain an absolute favorite for me.",1433376000,2,369,4.3478260869565215

6154881,5,B00HDEEU48,"It is charming as well as emotionally and historically relevant.  Both the Germans and the French have good guys and bad guys - there is a balance rather than presenting only extremes.  It also covers the issue of adoption of a child and the ensuing love, the relationship between the boy and the people as well as the dog, the ability to train a Great Pyrenee dog to act.  It has Disney film characteristics, but that is not a major detriment.",1430265600,,444,4.45679012345679

6154891,5,B00HDEEU48,"Adapted from the classic children's books by Cecile Aubrey - who also gave the name to one of the best band's ever, Scotland's own, `Belle and Sebastian, we have a tale of a young boy and a dog. Well there is a bit more to it, as it is set in the Pyrenees during World War II. Sebastian befriends a run away dog and together they go off and have loads of adventures, face danger and stand up to the nasty Nazi's.

We also have the French resistance lots of snow, some songs so sugary they must be bad for your teeth and some subliminal messages to children about being nice to each other and getting an education - preferably in a school.

This is a great film for children - especially if learning French and might get them to start watching World cinema which can be no bad thing. It is very well made and the dog is as cute as a kitten in a bomber jacket. Add to that the mild adventure and you have all the ingredients for a classic. In French with a small amount of German and good sub titles; they are actually already making the follow up to this so that will be one to look out for soon.",1423612800,13,1095,4.088372093023255

In my excitement, I didn't look far enough to see that they only have an English language track.  Awesome.  Why is there no option to watch a French movie in its original language?  Fine, offer an English language track for people who don't mind dubbed movies, but at least give the choice to watch it in its original language.  So I payed 10 bucks for a movie that I will never watch.
The movie itself is adorable. A very sweet story.",1526601600,,549,4.29126213592233

*spoilers*
Other than that, I enjoyed the film. The scenery was beautiful, the story sweet and kid friendly (a boy and his dog, can't really go wrong there) but with a strong enough plot to keep adults interested too, I think. The characters themselves are multi dimensional, which was refreshing to watch. Pretty solid story, and glad they included the end bits showing Belle and Sebastian back home in the Spring, as I wasn't sure how they'd make it back over the mountains (especially seeing as the bridge they used to get to Switzerland was destroyed.) But other than that, I loved it!",1518048000,,866,4.452830188679245

Not just the dubbing, but the unconvincing voices that were used. I would much rather have heard it in French with English subtitles. Granted, my kids would not have enjoyed it at all if they had to read the subtitles, but my husband and I would have much preferred to hear the beautiful French language.",1501286400,3,443,4.481481481481482
