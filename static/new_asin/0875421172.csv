7793288,4,0875421172,"Let's see.. off the top of my head, this video tape shows you begginer intros on making sachets, oils, bath salts, herbal petitions, incences (the loose kind).  That's all the sections I can remember, after each section Scott Cunningham (he himself is teaching you in the video) gives you about 3 recipies for making a sachet, oil, ect. for various pourposes (like love, luck, psychic power, ect.) he does not, however, give amounts for the recipies, he just lists the hearbs or oils, he wants you to experiment and use your intuition!  You'll know when it smells right, he says.  Scott shows you the tools you need to practice herb magic.  He also throws in the lemon and pin spell (to protect your house) and a simple herbal scrying (to help you get a vision).  You will also learn about the magical properites of some random herbs.  Now your wondering why I gave it 4 stars and not 5 huh?  Well!, the quality, it's not soo great!  The volume changes here and there (nothing huge, you might just want to adjust it a few times throughout this video).  Scott also.. stalls a bit..  There's pauses where he will just stop talking for a while to show you the scenery (this video takes place in a beautiful herbal garden) There is quite a bit of stalling in this video!  It's a bit a hack job.. I probably should have given it 3 stars.. It does cover a wide range of herbal secrets though and is still fun to watch and learn from (If you a begginer), it's a nice break to just relax and let the tv read for you.  I think it's worth getting if you just want a break from the books or ever wondered what Scott Cunningham was like..",1177459200,11,1626,4.365448504983389
