1404765,3,B000059HA2,"This is a pretty standard kung fu movie.  The plot is your basic political intrigue mixed with monks and fighting.  Nothing special there, and it isn't particularly well delivered to boot.  There are a lot of holes and inconsistencies in this movie.
The action is good, but not great.  The wire work was not obvious, nor was there a great deal of undercranking.  The stunts and action were frequent and well done, just nothing to write home about.
This movie is wide screen anamorphic, but the video quality is not great.  I guess it is as good or better than what I would expect from this period (mid 80's).  The dubbing is decent, but maybe not enough crazy voices for my liking.
It was pretty easy to tell the good guys from the bad - the bad ones all wear funny hats with 2 foot raccoon tails hanging from either side.  The good guys were mostly monks in white, blue, or orange.  At least it was easy to follow.
The only memorable scene from the movie is the kung fu bartending done by the crazy old monk in the cave.
Overall a good movie, but you can do better.",1016323200,2,1066,4.316582914572864

1404767,2,B000059HA2,"This movies fight scenes are done in a common older form of choreography.  Instead of a constant stream of punches and blocks, each attack is performed and then a pause occurs before the next attack begins.  The Jackie Chan sequence of punches and kicks could be described as being 123456.  This movie could be described more as 1-2-3-4-5-6.  However the non-fighting action scenes are tremendous at times, watch for the drunken shaolin monk.  The shots are long and drawn out, not a lot of jumping and cutting going on in this film, so at least the actors knew what they were doing when it came to the action.  The wire work was very subtle for this film, which is a nice change from the more typically wire-heavy genre of the time.
The plot is there, although it had some jumps that were completely odd and out of place.  The characterization is the most frustrating thing, you could hardly tell what type of person the main character was, he went from stalwart hero to blustering overconfident youth, to whiny wimp, etc.  Even for a film like this, you didn't get much of a sense of the character.
Overall the action was fine, with a few outstanding moments, and the soft elements (plot, storyline, characterization, etc) were good enough for this genre of film.",998265600,3,1265,4.666666666666667
1404768,4,B000059HA2,"Drunken Monks, Shaolin mixed up in a war plot, an underlying  love story that results in mayhem. This movie has a plot, which some said is not existent, and great training and fight sequences. If you want to see a quality kung fu movie then this is one of them. Watch the 13 pole fighters of shaolin and the abott kick some manchu hind section. This movie is a must see!!",985564800,2,371,4.225352112676056
7933226,2,B000059HA2,"Once again the ad does not reflect the product. It shows Chinese language, dubbed English. It's a dub in English, no Chinese lang soundtrack. I hate English dub's. Never encountered this with Tai Seng before. Twice now in the last week I've been hung out to dry on DVD's  I ordered believing they are Chinese Lang. according to the product pages. Getting real tired of Amazon's mix and matched pages for the same but different product. Movie is great, just didn't need another crap English dub, I already had one as it is.....",1489968000,,526,4.655913978494624
