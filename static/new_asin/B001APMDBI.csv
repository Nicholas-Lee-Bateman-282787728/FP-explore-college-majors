The men go after the photographer, who telephones for protection from narcotic producers. But the drug gang listened to his call to Sues answering machine! two shots are heard. Later the drug gang kidnaps Sue and takes to a secluded mansion. They ask for a letter. But the DEA went to Sues apartment. Mick is told to bring the letter to the Hoyt Street station. Tourists arrive. One helps Mick.

The drug dealer converses with Sue. Another goes to see Mick, who questions him atop the building. Mick makes a daring escape! He finds allies in a bar. Rico serves dinner to Sue, lobster flown in from Maine. Mick asks questions in a bar, and asks for help. Mick throws his bowie knife to impress a man. A motorcade attracts followers to that Long Island mansion. There is howling like from wolves. Ricos men investigate. Just some punk kids. Mick enters the house and finds Sue, then leaves. Those people enter the house. The DEA visit Sues apartment and offer protective custody. They choose Australia. Rico offers a reward for their location. A small jet plane lands in the country, Rico emerges. They need a tracker to find Dundee.

Then shots are fired. The visitors vehicles are disabled by shooting their tires! Mick improvises a trap for one man. Shots are fired but miss. Mick knows where his enemies are. Mick swings a noisemaker as a signal. Rico asks about Dundee, who was raised by aborigines. Bats fly to the intruders, shots drive them away. At night Dundee visits their camp and leaves a snake! Someone left a small crocodile in their camp during the night! The two Australians decide to take off now. Their guide Walter steps into a creek and disappears! Now only two villains are left. One starts a brush fire, it spreads. Mick captures Rico and orders his pants removed. Mistaken identity from a distance? But there is a happy ending. What will happen to the captives?

This has a better story than the previous movie. But the idea of Rico pursuing Mick to Australia to personally kill him seems unlikely to me because Rico had a business to run and would have delegated it to a trusted underling.",1524700800,,2454,4.608695652173913
