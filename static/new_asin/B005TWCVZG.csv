4892734,4,B005TWCVZG,"Not enough discussion on paint and equipment. Your not going to grab any old paint or airbrush and do this...

However, the techniques demoed were excellent so worth the money.

Now, where do I get a volunteer???",1392076800,3,212,4.702702702702703
4892735,5,B005TWCVZG,First of all this DVD is for mature audiences.  The artists is skilled at body painting and does an excellent job at presenting the tutorials at a pace that people new to body painting can follow.  The tutorials are intended for people who will be applying body paint with an airbrush instead of a bristle brush.  The artists takes the mystery out of applying body paint.,1371427200,4,371,4.590909090909091
4892736,5,B005TWCVZG,"Roustan is by far one body artist that stands out among the rest, his step by step instructions are very easy to follow using live models... DVD worth every penny'",1333152000,3,163,4.466666666666667
4892737,5,B005TWCVZG,"This DVD is a must if you want to get in to body painting.  I didn't know much about body painting but really wanted to try it.  Did some research on line, learned about Paul Roustan, saw his portfolio on line and was blown away.  I bought his book and this DVD.  The DVD walks you through different techniques from basic to advanced and is easy to follow along.  It's been a few weeks now but I find myself coming back to the DVD the better I get.  I haven't attempted the advanced stuff yet but it's cool to see what's actually possible.  Again, great buy, thanks amazon!",1318723200,6,573,4.25

8486565,1,B005TWCVZG,"If I could give this 0 stars I would. For someone who is so well respected in the industry, he should know that this video was an incredibly cheap way for him to make money. The video quality is horrendous, there is absolutely no introduction, background, etc at all. I was quite surprised when I clicked on the menu and it started a video with a hand painting 'dots' on a white piece of paper. There is very little audio direction and quite frankly.. this was a huge waste of money.",1461715200,,483,4.318681318681318
8486566,5,B005TWCVZG,Great and informative DVD! The explanations are spot on and for a beginner will be just the perfect thing to help them.,1453766400,,119,4.454545454545454
8486567,3,B005TWCVZG,Was hoping for more smaller techniques. the dress outfit is definetly for a more seasoned airbrush artist. I am still new at it.,1447459200,,128,4.608695652173913

8486569,5,B005TWCVZG,Excellent for both novice AND experienced.  Particularly loved the 3 time-lapse bodypainting sequences.  I actually play this for my nervous 1st time models right before I paint them to show them how bodypainting is done.,1410307200,,221,5.285714285714286
8486570,5,B005TWCVZG,Great instructional dvd for learning how to implement free hand mask and free-hand techniques on what i consider to be the hardest surface to work with.,1399248000,,152,4.884615384615385
8486571,5,B005TWCVZG,"I have been looking for just this kind of DVD for some time now. While it did not give me everything that I was looking for, it is by far the best DVD that I have found on body painting!!! There are three different ""paint jobs"". Each is for a different skill level. Each is well explained and demonstrated. I thought it was well worth the price.

  As a parent, my only cautionary statement would be to say that yes, there is some nudity.",1396828800,3,438,4.190476190476191
