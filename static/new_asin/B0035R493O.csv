8584097,5,B0035R493O,"Dennis Ralston's ""Timeless Tennis"" DVD is excellent, and aptly named because the insights that Ralston provides really are timeless because they are based on principles which are valid regardless various style differences and techniques. This is not a glitzy production number with fancy graphics and music, but just basic Dennis Ralston telling it like it is. Ralston covers every stroke in this one DVD and it's kind of fun because his sense of humor and lack of BS really comes through. I have other instruction videos/dvd's and this is one of the best - I'll be coming back to it and watching and listening because there's a lot there. Also very good practical practice suggestions.",1298160000,,686,4.973913043478261
