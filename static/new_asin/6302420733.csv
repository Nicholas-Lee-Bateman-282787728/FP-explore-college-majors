Anyone who is in the mood for some family friendly memories should definitely look into getting this movie.",1353456000,,271,4.510204081632653

460045,5,6302420733,"A classic movie musical!  My parents taped it for me off of the Disney channel way back when and I fell in love with it.

The Grimm Brothers, Jakob and Wilhelm, are traveling by carriage to deliver a collection of their fairy tales to a neighboring king.  When the reach the edge of the forest, their driver refuses to continue into the haunted woods.  The brothers buy the carriage and venture on.

As the brothers enter the forest, Wilhelm sees their fairy tales come to life as Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs pass them by and as Little Red Ridding Hood asks where her grandmother's house is.  Jakob assures him that he is imagining things and that ""Life Is Not a Fairy Tale.""

The brothers get lost several times along the way and stumble upon such classics as ""The Six Swans,"" ""Cinderella,"" ""The Frog Prince,"" ""The Twelve Dancing Princesses,"" ""Dumling and the Golden Goose,"" ""The Musicians of Bremen,"" ""Rumpelstiltskin,"" and a gorgeous ""Sleeping Beauty"" ballet.

The story is accompianed by beautiful dancing and gorgeous songs.  The costumes are phenomenal and the sets are breathtaking.  Follow the Brothers Grimm through the classic fairy tales we know and love and meet a few new friends along the way.

This is a classic movie that you will love to watch again and again: ""Once Upon a Brothers Grimm.""",1104710400,12,1311,4.756637168141593
460046,5,6302420733,I also remember this movie from my childhood. My mother had the movie but cant seem to find it. I am so happy to see it once again. My own children now love this movie and watch it all the time.,1103846400,2,194,3.7560975609756095
460047,5,6302420733,This was one of my favorite movies I saw when I was a kid in the 80s.  I have been trying to track it down for a LONG TIME.  I highly suggest this movie.  It's a great fantasy about the brothers walking through a enchanged forest and bumping into many of the fairy tales.,1006905600,4,271,3.9814814814814814
460048,4,6302420733,"I saw this film a while ago, and it still holds strong in my memory as a very good movie.  While it is obvious that this film is meant for children, there is no reason that adults (children of all ages) cannot enjoy this  film.  There are several silly and cheesy moments, from the costumes to the  dialogue (i.e. really really bad jokes), even to the acting.  However, in  this case the good outweighs the bad.  One of the most remarkable thing  about this film is that most, if not all, of the fairy tales mentioned are  set in some way to music and/or dance.  To see these fairy tales come to  life in this way is remarkable.  I would definitely recommend this film to  every child I know...and even to a few adults.",924998400,4,719,4.276119402985074

7825394,4,6302420733,"Really fun to see these TV Fairy Tale musicals I have not seen in over 40 years. Dean Jones and Paul Sand star as the Brother's Grimm. On their way to deliver a hard-bound book of their stories to some European King, the Grimms get lost in the Enchanted Forest and in the middle of several of their own fairy tales!! Wilhelm (Sand) is a starry-eyed dreamer, prone to flights of fantasy. Jacob (Jones) is the older, more practical brother who tells Wilhelm not to believe in the folklore they have collected. After his experiences in the Enchanted Forest, he begins to reconsider his opinions. Overall, the show may be a bit too long for very young children, with key moments from ""Sleeping Beauty"" and ""Cinderella"" presented as ballets. But it is fun to see Ruth Buzzi as the Queen in danger of losing her baby from ""Rumpilstiltskin."" And Chita Rivera gives a very different interpretation of the Wicked Witch from ""Hansel And Gretel.""
  ""Pinocchio"" starring Danny Kaye and Sandy Duncan, is, overall, the more successful of the two musicals here. Don't expect the Disney version. This version sticks closer to the original story by Carlo Collodi. There is no Jiminy Cricket Conscience or Magic Fairy to help Pinocchio along this time. The story is framed differently and is more obviously a ""morality tale"" along the order of ""This is what happens to Bad Children.""
  In a Prologue, Danny Kaye appears as Collodi, a member of a traveling theatrical troupe. His daughter Teresa (Sandy Duncan) is leaving the troupe, but agrees to portray Pinocchio for one night. Danny Kaye also portrays Gepetto and Stroganoff, the evil puppet master.
  Sandy Duncan is a delight as Pinocchio, the puppet who can't help go bad. Not surprisingly,  Duncan would subsequently have gender-bender success as Peter Pan on Broadway, just a few years later. Flip Wilson and Liz Torres appear, in excellent make-up and costume, as the Fox and Cat who easily lead Pinocchio astray.
  DVD also includes a Bonus Cartoon: ""All's Fair At The Fair.""",1492473600,,2017,4.874269005847953

7825396,5,6302420733,"This production is a very fun production for all ages.
