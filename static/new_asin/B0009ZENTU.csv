8287218,5,B0009ZENTU,One of my favorite titty movies of all time.  Naturally anything with Richard Benjamin is fantastic but anything with Richard Benjamin and lots of hot female nudity or at least toplessness .... well I don't have to tell you.  If you are an adolescent or still wish you were run don't walk to the bank and get out the hundred and ninety four bucks it will cost to score the vhs tape since nobody ever put it on dvd as far as I know and then make me a copy ... please.,1441497600,2,466,4.054347826086956
8287219,5,B0009ZENTU,"The Marriage of a Young Stockbroker proves yet again the old axiom that no American movie, made in 1971, is completely without interest.  Radical changes were sweeping the country and the US cinema was also reeling from repeated threats to its hegemony by European directors and freedoms.  As a consequence, the star system was breaking down and the studios were grabbing for anything, no matter how unlikely it would have seemed only a few years earlier.  We all know the result, that for the next ten years a crazy new Hollywood made a couple of dozen great pictures and a thousand flops that deserve renewed scrutiny.

In this case you can follow the dots without a map.  The Graduate had been a huge hit, and so, thought the moguls, why not buy the rights to another novel by the same author.  In many ways The Marriage of a Young Stockbroker might almost be the story of The Graduate's Benjamin and Elaine after their marriage.  (They even hired Richard Benjamin to obtain more of that ""Benjamin"" subtext.)  I enjoyed the movie no end but have rarely seen a film in which the main character's job features so little in the action!  Especially if you're going to foreground the stockbroker bit by using it in the title!  Richard Benjamin has one or two brief scenes at the beginning in the stock exchange, a sparsely populated stock exchange like something from a Bergman film set on a deserted island in the Faro Sea....  Then that's it, the rest of the movie is all about his romantic problems.  Joanna Shimkus is lovely and not a bad actress, too bad this was her last film, but maybe she thought, what the hell.  They're both taking a back seat to Broadway's Elizabeth Ashley, just as The Graduate had the thespian fireworks of Anne Bancroft, this movie has Ashley has the hot-to-trot, repressed, quasifeminist ballbreaker who keeps flashing her bits at William (Richard Benjamin) to tempt him away from her sister.  Nice!  You can't take your eyes off of her, that's for sure.

In the same category let me nominate Tiffany Bolling, sort of a Sinemax vixen staple of the 1970s and 1980s but here, an actual screen presence with a million dollar sense of sensual style.  Her wordless seduction of William on a rainswept Venice afternoon should go down in history as one of its steamiest moments, even today.  (Her character's name in the credits is, ""Girl in the Rain."")",1269993600,6,2377,4.700483091787439
