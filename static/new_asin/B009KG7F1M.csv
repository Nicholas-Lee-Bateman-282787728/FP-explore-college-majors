My husband and I were so impressed, we bought the video (we took advantage of the black Friday deal on another website - sorry Amazon).  Such an amazing story that has had me glued to the edge of my seat.  Kyle Idleman gives you many things to think about.  We just bought the Easter Experience as well (1 for the church and 1 for us) as I know it will be as good as this one.",1480896000,,423,4.0

It provided participants a different, more personal viewpoint from which to consider the difficult circumstances under which our Lord came to be among us, and the fact that God's Work and Timing are mysterious but always correct.",1421625600,,256,5.2439024390243905

8542470,5,B009KG7F1M,"Christmas is coming. What will your small group(s) be doing to prepare for this important time of the year?

Many groups struggle with meeting and studying over the holidays, and this can be detrimental to the health of your group! Not only that, but this is a prime time of the year to help your group members grow in their faith and to reach out and invite new people to your group(s).

Here's where I think this new study from City on a Hill can help.

I had the honor of writing the study guides for ""The Christmas Experience,""  featuring Kyle Idleman. This is a six-session DVD-driven study, but we provided some options for doing the study in, say, 4 weeks, between Thanksgiving and Christmas.

I don't want to sound over-dramatic, but I loved watching the videos for this study! Kyle Idleman does his usual great job of digging into and explaining the context of the biblical story. He brings out insights I had never really considered and helped me see this very familiar Christmas story in new ways. More than that, however, as I watched the dramatic presentation of the Christmas story, I was moved in ways I didn't expect. As your group experiences this material, I believe they will be moved as well, and they will grow not only to know the story better, but to know God more intimately.

I thought all the actors in The Christmas Experience did an amazing job, but I was especially impressed by the character of Mary and the actress who played her. I came to a new understanding of Mary (and Joseph) and why God chose them to be the earthly parents of the Savior.

I wrote the leader's guide and participant's discussion guide to help groups interact with this material and to grow together as they experience it together.

This really is more than just a nice Christmas study or a good curriculum. I believe it will be an experience that you and your group will remember for a long time.",1392681600,4,1901,4.55425219941349
