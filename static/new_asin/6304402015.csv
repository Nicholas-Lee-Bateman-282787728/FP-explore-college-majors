This movie is truly a blessing, not lending itself to the latest fashion fad in music or  dress, it stayed true to the sacredness of life, and that sacredness  triumphed all the way through, as it does in real life when we keep that  sacredness in tact, without over worrying or fearing. It left me with a  good feeling to see people concentrating on the important things for once  in a movie without a care, and not the usual teenage ""Oh I want to  lose my virginity and drunk junk."" This one has culture and sacredness  in tact, and yes it's an ADVENTURE! Not to mention fun! Especially when you  consider that when you learn to listen, Miracles DO happen, and happen  WELL.",949795200,4,811,4.5
