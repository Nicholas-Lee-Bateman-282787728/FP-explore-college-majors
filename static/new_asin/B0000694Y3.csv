1729720,4,B0000694Y3,"This film shows up about every 3 months on the Starz Western Channel. I have viewed it twice and found something new each time.
whether you like westerns or not, you will find this a new and refreshing take on some old themes.",1075852800,18,226,4.27906976744186
1729721,4,B0000694Y3,"Jericho is a neat little film that shines despite the low budget that independent films are usually forced to work with.  There are not a lot of stunts or special effects in this film, but the plot and character development are first rate and certainly better than much of the crap that the big studios often shove down our throats.
At times it is a bit slow and it leaves you wondering exactly where it is going.  The pace picks up near the end, however, and you turn off the DVD player happy that you went out and bought this movie.",1059177600,18,534,4.2772277227722775
1729722,5,B0000694Y3,"Jericho is a great character-driven, classic western.  I saw it at the Film Festival in Houston in April 2001.  I have been looking for it on video ever since.  Mark Valley, as Jericho, and Leon Coffee, as Joshua, make a great team as a man haunted by his past and a cowbory-preacher who becomes his friend. R. Lee Ermey plays the Marshall and Buck Taylor is the trail boss.  Jericho is also a mystery with a surprise ending. Don't miss seeing this one.",1027296000,43,453,4.421686746987952

1729734,4,B0000694Y3,"I bought the DVD because I like classic westerns and because the reviews were predominantly good.  The story line is good, the acting is good, the ending had a nice twist.  However, the Monarch Home Video DVD format is lacking in a couple of respects.  The screen format is full screen, not widescreen.  There are no captions or other specials available on the DVD.  Someone mentioned the video was in black and white - mine was in color.  All in all, not a bad western, but not one of the great movies.",1451174400,,503,4.413043478260869
1729735,4,B0000694Y3,"This is nice story with essentially two plots. Three men commit a robbery and one man gets hit on the head and is unable to remember who he is. He is left for dead by two of the robbers and is brought back to life by a black man, who happens to be a preacher and interested in peace. One of the plots, the smaller one, focuses on the discrimination against the black man. The man he helped who cannot remember anything about himself and is now called Jericho, saves him in a way that shows he is very good with a gun, apparently a gunman. The preacher makes him promise not to use his gun. The second plot focuses on Jericho. He and the preacher hear about the three robbers, two were killed in a shoot out. The preacher suggests that Jericho stay away from the town because he will be recognized as the third robber and be hung. Meanwhile, the two friends go through some adventures and, finally, after seven years Jericho decides to go back to the town where the robbery occurred and find out what he can find out. The story is filled with suspense and is well acted.",1449964800,,1069,4.270935960591133

1729773,1,B0000694Y3,Absolutely horrid.  I gave up after about 10 minutes or so of what is like a western version of those awful made for tv scifi channel movies.  Really bad acting etc etc.,1384473600,,169,4.25
1729774,4,B0000694Y3,I thought Mark Valley did a good job with Jericho's character. I wonder why he is not in more movies or tv he is a great actor,1378944000,,126,3.7037037037037037

1729789,5,B0000694Y3,"I don't know just how to explain it, but I love westerns and I saw this movie once on TV several years ago,  and wanted to see it again. I tried to get it on netflix but couldn't. So I searched for it online. I think Mark Valley is a great actor. I use to watch Mark on a soap a few years ago. I think it was Days of Our Lives. I guess I had a crush on him. Would like to see more of him in westerns. He's sexy and quiet. Not a loud mouth. I hate that in a movie. Great job Mark.",1370563200,,479,3.518867924528302

1729816,4,B0000694Y3,"A good ""for TV"" western and one that you will like to watch more than once.  Good acting and a good story.  I enjoyed it when it came out on television and bought it when I had the chance.",1337731200,,188,3.7948717948717947
1729817,4,B0000694Y3,"I love this movie! I have watched it over and over. Mark Valley is amazing in this part. I had never heard of him before this movie. I wondered, Why is he not one of the top stars of our time! The music score does so much to make this movie, esp. the song at the end. it just fits the story, and always makes me cry. If it were up to me I would release it again, as surely there was not enough publicity to really make it known to the public. I would have given it 5 stars except for the fact, thought it unrealistic that a family would except a dead body as their loved one, when other body parts can be identified than just the head, and face. Other than that, you will never regret buying this wonderful cowboy tale.",1329350400,2,719,4.0
1729818,5,B0000694Y3,"I had seen this movie before and knew that I wanted to own it for
myself. It is an excellent movie with a great plot that keeps you
guessing until the very end.  This movie is also suitable for anyone to watch.  I very highly recommend this DVD to anyone.",1296259200,,255,4.08
1729819,3,B0000694Y3,"The TV serial ""Human Target"" is very good, sure hope it comes back in the fall. This serial made me look for other movies with Mark Valley. Jericho was good and it is 3 to 4 stars in my opinion. Mark Valley is very good, the story was good.",1280534400,2,240,3.9183673469387754
1729820,4,B0000694Y3,"If you like the old western genre, you will love Jericho!  So do not expect a bang-bang-shootum-up. In the 40's the lead would have been played by none other than Roy Rogers or Gene Autry.  So, relax, and let the story unfold. You know the good guys are going to win.  Oh, this is a movie you can actually watch with your children. Hey the best thing is, you get to watch Mark Valley ride a horse, partner.  So bring on the popcorn and enter the 19th century.",1274918400,2,459,4.181818181818182
1729821,5,B0000694Y3,"One of the best decent movies I seen in a long time. A classic. Top movie. Has a surprise at the end. The actors were great, was very believable. A#1 movie. Action, love, down to earth hardship, and problems. Recommand to buy it.",1243296000,3,229,4.348837209302325
1729822,5,B0000694Y3,"I would have only given it four stars--a one-star penalty for TV-dialogue in places--but then I decided the nifty plot twist was worth a bonus star. Jericho is a classic hero-myth that would have done the Odyssey proud. In fact, I even wondered now and again if Homer didn't do a little consulting on the script. ;-) Kudos to Black Knight Productions!! Now go do another one.

1729823,1,B0000694Y3,"i am very disappointed with jericho..it is in black and white and nowhere did it say it was in black and white

thank you

1729824,3,B0000694Y3,"An interesting low-budget addition to the Western genre, Jericho is unusual in that while the plot is relatively strong, some of the dialogue is pretty clunky, and there are some big gaps in logic here and there.  Nevertheless, a Western with an intelligent view of how nasty racism really is does have real merit.

Attempting to mix film noir with the Western, Jericho finds the title character having lost his memory (the noir aspect) after being left for dead by some bad guys--three, to be exact.  But we only see two of them. At first. (The revelation of the third is another disappointment in the film; it's basically no big deal at all). Jericho is rescued by Joshua, an ex-slave, ex-preacher who's now a drifting cowboy (i.e., a guy who herds cattle on a drive for a living)--moving from one job to another. Having nothing better to do, Jericho goes with him and they meet various folks along the way.

Eventually, of course, the mystery of Jericho's identity must be revealed and this revealing half works, half doesn't. Coming near the film's completion, it leaves one huge loose end that never gets tied up at all which is definitely disappointing.

But also on the plus side is R. Lee Ermey who turns in a solid performance as the local marshal; it was nice to see him in the film.  He and Buck Taylor as the trail boss, as well as a few other older, seasoned guys, lend the film some substance it wouldn't have otherwise. The cast is almost all unknowns.

Not great at all, but also not bad at all, this is a Western that is worth viewing and maybe owning--if you're a fan of the genre.  It would have helped if the level of intelligence on display had been consistently strong instead of intermittent.",1115510400,13,1715,4.5816993464052285

7964993,3,B0000694Y3,"I only gave this movie two-and-one-half stars because, in my opinion, much of the acting was just that, ""acting,"" and I could tell it. I would not buy this one again.",1513555200,,166,4.387096774193548

7964996,4,B0000694Y3,"We were very pleasantly drawn into this story and it has a lot going for it. It has mystery, friendships, violence, romance, all filmed in the beautiful west. The story and acting kept our attention from our games that we usually are playing  while watching movies. We ended up really enjoying this movie. It's a really good movie. I would recommend it for 16 and up. It deals with some mature subject matter of those times. I don't think younger children should view it. Teens and adults will probably enjoy this film if the wild west is their jam. I recommend  this movie and I hope you will too.",1492732800,,598,4.477064220183486
