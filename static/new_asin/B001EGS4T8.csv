8298016,3,B001EGS4T8,Its more a documentary than a movie,1424822400,,35,4.142857142857143
8298017,5,B001EGS4T8,"Catherine of Siena is a true hero of mine, a source of virtually endless inspiration.  This video--which is actually 12 separate videos, on 4 DVD's--is very well done.  Much of it is filmed in Siena.  It is hosted by a very likeable priest, who in his ""day job"" is a chaplain at a hospital.  It focuses on modern-day real-life adaptation of the ideas and practices that Catherine herself taught and used in her own life.  I would say it captures the essence of her message to her own ""disciples""--called the ""Caterinati""--the family of Catherine.
Your whole family will enjoy it too.",1264550400,9,583,4.732673267326732
8298018,5,B001EGS4T8,"This is an excellent DVD on St. Catherine of Siena's life and the tremendous influence she had on popes and others of political influence living in her time.  Anyone interested in learning about this saint, her courage and faith, will benefit from viewing this DVD.",1262044800,9,265,4.888888888888889
8298019,1,B001EGS4T8,I bought this EWTN DVD on Amazon and it was presented as a movie about Catherine Siena. Bought it and when I got it home we opened it up to watch. To our surprise it was not a movie but some documentary about her. No where on the package does it say that it is a documentary. Wrote Adoremus who sold it and asked them for a return and all I got was you opened it you can't return it. I paid $40 for this and as far as I'm concerned I was robbed... Very deceptive advertising. Adoremus and EWTN!! It will a long time before I ever buy any EWTN product again and never from Adoremus.,1262044800,13,581,3.9743589743589745
