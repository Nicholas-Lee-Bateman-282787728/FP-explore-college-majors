8442308,5,B004UUV3QQ,"Papa Luciani - Il sorriso di Dio (Pope Luciani - The Smile Of God) is an Italian film about the overlooked papacy of the late Pope John Paul I,whose reign lasted only 33 days after an untimely death. It also will always be remembered as the time that bridged epic papacies of both the late Pope Paul VI and the soon-to-be canonized late Pope John Paul II.

Neri Marcor starred in this film by portraying the title role,also known by his birth name Albino Luciani and for his character traits such as his infectious smile,warm personality and humble pastoral style,together with a talented Italian cast that includes Jos Mara Blanco Martinez, Paolo Romano, Franco Interlenghi and Imma Colomer Marcet. Giorgio Capitani directed the said film.

Aside from his short papacy,the movie also dwells on his life from his childhood of poor and humble origins to his career as a priest,a life marked by deep faith and charity. It was later revealed that he was a protg of Pope John XXIII, who saw greatness and genuine holiness in him and a former Archbishop and the Patriarch of Venice. It also tells an interesting detail about his meeting with Sister Lucia,one of the visionaries of our Blessed Virgin Mary in Fatima,at Portugal when he was still a Cardinal. She told him that she a prophetic insight that he would become Pope and that his papacy would be very short. This scenes added intrigue to the viewers especially when the third secret of Fatima came into the picture and Luciani's reluctance to the papacy due to this said meeting.

Despite the many great things about this movie,one would definitely disappointed especially for conspiracy theorists who wanted some insight on his supposed murder and conspiracies surrounding his mysterious death. In addition to that,the topics about the Vatican Bank and Banco Ambrosiano were tackled only in passing with only a couple of scenes with Archbishop Paul Marinckus when Don Luciani met him twice - once as a Cardinal of Venice and the other as Pope. Also,the movie did not try to place new theories after it has firmly established that the Albino was indeed suffering for chest pains due to a not-so- healthy heart and that was the supposed reason why he is predicted to die early during his Papacy as predicted by Sister Lucia. In addition to that,the movie underplays the scene when Sister Vicenza discovered him dead during his sleep and that of the character of Cardinal Villot,accused by some conspiracy theorists of concealing facts surrounding the sudden expiration of the Pope and who has had personal disagreement with him. But nevertheless, placing a long final shot of the actor portraying him at the end of the film provides intrigue.

Overall,the film was more about what a great person the late Pope John Paul I is all about. People interested more on the mystery surrounding the his death have to look for them in other sources. Truly,Catholic viewers who wants to know more about this particular Pope though will never be disappointed in this surprisingly pleasant film.",1418601600,,3034,4.896887159533074
