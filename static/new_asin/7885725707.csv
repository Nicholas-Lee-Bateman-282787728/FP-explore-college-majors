7900449,1,7885725707,"The movie itself is the earliest sound film version of David Copperfield and is very well done for the era.  I love the great character actors and their fine work, even if Freddie Bartholomew overdoes his rendering of David.  W. C. Fields and Basil Rathbone are wonderful. Any Dickens or movie buff should have a copy, but not this one.  This looks like somebody copied a televised program with an 8mm home movie camera.  In some scenes you can barely recognize the actors.  The Asian company that sells this reproduction should be ashamed of such shoddy work.  I absolutely wasted money on this purchase.",1357344000,7,605,4.769230769230769
