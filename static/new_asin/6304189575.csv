""It's Easter and time for a picnic in Chucklewood Forest. Ranger Jones is teaching Buttons & Rusty all about the celebration, and how everything comes alive for the season. When the cubs learn about Easter eggs, they sneak their way into the secret underground egg factory, as they pose to be bunnies. Their mischievous disguise gets them into lots of trouble, but the adventure teaches them all about the spirit of Easter.""
