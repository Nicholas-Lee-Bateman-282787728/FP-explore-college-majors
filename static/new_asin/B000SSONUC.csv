2890019,5,B000SSONUC,"What can i say when a movie starts with lizzy borden song ""me against the world"" and a band of demons (real demons folks i swear) start playing.
Dont forget the scene when a father consumed by a monster who came out from a speaker , and the amazing dialogues -
- what is that , your wearing an  earring ?
- only two persons wears that , fa**ts and pirates, and i don't see a pirate ship anywere.
After the amazing ""rock'n'roll nightmare"" here it comes the pure classic black roses full of heavy metal clise's and jawdropping fx that will make industrial light and magic start looking for a new job.
After those two dvd releases(black roses& rock'n'roll nightmare) by synapse i think im over with the dvd format , where is the blue ray release ?Ill buy it to ...",1190678400,4,761,4.321678321678322
2890020,1,B000SSONUC,"I grew up on 80's hair bands, but this movie is poorly cast with theater type kid actors that overact and prance around like they are in a musical not a horror movie.  also the rubber monster costumes aren't fooling anybody whether you saw this in the 80's or now; they were probably left overs from other movies but seem out of place here...a giant bug?? and especially the frog type creature near the end??",1462406400,,408,4.44

2890026,5,B000SSONUC,"Black Roses is from the same director of another 80's cult classic ""Rock 'N' Roll Nightmare"", but I like this one better because it has a good storyline to go with the cheese. It also has a great soundtrack, and it seems like the kind of movie that would have ran on USA Up All Night back in the day. They really don't make movies like this anymore, and it's a shame.

Certainly a good example of a bad 80's horror flick, but one with at least a few redeeming points. Some may love it for the 80's hair-metal vibe that's rocking the whole time, some for the random nudity.

2890036,4,B000SSONUC,Classic 80s horror!  With a nice touch of heavy metal for good measure.  The effects are dated as was expected and the plot is a typical 80s horror plot.  Trick or Treat meets Critters!,1380067200,,185,4.382352941176471
2890037,5,B000SSONUC,"This is a heavy metal music/horror movie and is totally awesome, after making a deal with the devil for fame and success a rock bank ( Black Roses ) comes to town unbeknownst to the nice town folk they are demonic. They travel around from place to place performing, spreadind evil, corrupting teens, and reekting havoc gaining themselves power, popularity, fame, and big time success. It soon becomes the task of a teen guy to battle them and save the town

For example you have the pretty sweet innocent wouldn't hurt a fly blond girl next door who after listening to their music turns into a gorgeous sexy temptress dressed in black and kills someone, other teens transform in various ways This film features music by ( Lizzy Borden, song Me Against The World ) and other rock performers, I freaking love the music in this. Another one is ( Trick Or Treat ) starring Tony Fields as the singer who does a satanic ritual, later on dies in a fire, a kid buys their album and starts playing it backwards a voice starts telling him how to get revenge on his bullies he does, 1 cool special affect is ightening shoots out of his guitar. This is another Heavy Metal Music/Horror masterpiece it is perfect with this one",1374796800,,1213,4.538812785388128

It's so bad it's good, and it's about a thousand times more enjoyable than the Evil Dead remake! This dvd is also loaded with extras, including a really hilarious commentary track with the director and some of the cast and crew.

2890041,4,B000SSONUC,"This is one of my favorite horror flicks from the 80's. It is a movie made about a metal hair band that turns all of a small town's teen's into sinning monsters. It has only minor cheese and a few thing that made me laugh. If you are a fan of horror and hair metal from, you will want to check this one out.

2890043,2,B000SSONUC,"Black Roses (John Fasano, 1988)

The eighties were, briefly, awash in rock and roll horror pictures, and as a hair metal fan back in the day, I was happier than a pig in Poison album covers. They ranged from the sublime (Hard Rock Zombies, still one of my favorite bad movies of all time) to the ridiculous (Trick or Treat, whose best feature was its Fastway soundtrack). Black Roses was firmly on the ""ridiculous"" side of the equation, though I didn't remember it being nearly as awful as the IMDB crowd make it out to be (as I write this, its IMDB rating is 2.6). So I grabbed a copy of it a couple of nights ago and gave it a look for the first time in twenty-odd years. And I was right, it's not that bad. Yes, it's ridiculous, but like all bad movies that transcend their badness, that's a part of its charm.

The admittedly lame plot: a bunch of (badly-made-up) demons have been sent from Hell to gather disciples. What better way to do that than to form a hair metal band? Their first concert goes horribly awry thanks to interference from the authorities, so after a quick hush job they decide to take the stage next in a small, out-of-the-way place. Of course, they also adopt human guise. Their lead singer morphs into Damien (standup comic, singer, and Broadway actor Sal Viviano), the kind of hair-metal Adonis one would expect to see back in 1988; the make-up folks probably spent more time making Viviano's hair that feathery than they did with the demon make-up in the opening scene. In any case, the town they opt for is conservative, and a local parents' group is up in arms about the concerts, opposed only by the mayor (TV character actor Ken Swofford, probably best remembered from 1982's film version of Annie) and the local English teacher, Matt Moorhouse (John Martin, who would go on from this to some success in the soap operas Sunset Beach and The Young and the Restless in the nineties), who's dating the mayor's daughter. The kids, of course, are over the moon that an actual rock band would come play in their dinky little town, and are more than willing disciples once Damien and his crew start weaving their musical spells. Needless to say, the music is eeeeeeeeeevil(TM), and the kids start turning very, very bad. Now Moorhouse has to find a way to stop Damien before the kids' souls are lost forever.

What struck me watching this in 2010, more than anything else, is how reactionary the underlying message is. The music is, in fact, inherently evil, and the two adults who stand up for freedom of expression against the annoying old biddies are proven very, very wrong. If I didn't know any better, I'd think the funding for the film came straight from the PMRC. And I know I should find myself far more offended by that than I actually do, but the simple truth of the matter is that the movie is so incompetent that I doubt its message ever actually got across to anyone. The acting is, in general, deplorable (though Viviano is passable and Martin is decent; most of the principal teen actors never worked in Hollywood again, though the movie's female lead did appear in another film in 2006), the direction is lackluster, the effects are laughable. And yet it's got a kind of basement-budget-gore-film charm to it. I can't really defend giving it a rating as high as I am for anything other than the stupid watchability of the movie... and its soundtrack. Which is phenomenal, as long as you were a hair-metal fan. Aside from tracks by Hallow's Eve (who sound incredibly out of place on this soundtrack), Bang Tango, Lizzy Borden, Tempest, and King Kobra, there's an actual one-off Black Roses band, and for hair metal, that stuff is quality. ""Dance on Fire"" and ""Soldiers of the Night"" will get stuck in your head for weeks. Heck, they upstage most of the real bands on the soundtrack (save, naturally, Hallow's Eve, who were a thrash band who occasionally slowed down to get songs on movie soundtracks anyway).

And when it comes right down to it, the message is so incompetently handled that you can't help but laugh at it anyway. ** ",1273622400,6,4075,4.599724896836314

2890048,5,B000SSONUC,"I am a big fan of the 80s music oriented horror films such as Rock n' Roll Nightmare, Slumber Party Massacre 2, Terror on Tour, Shock 'em Dead (which has yet to see a dvd release), Trick or Treat, etc. and this is my favorite one. Rock n' Roll Nightmare is probably a close 2nd place, but this film has better special effects, funnier characters, and is even more bizarre and unpredictable. I ordered this DVD as soon as I heard it was coming out. My VHS copy was one of my most treasured films because it was so hard to find and long out of print. I am glad this one didn't slip into obscurity.",1195171200,9,595,4.137931034482759
2890049,3,B000SSONUC,"Well I went into this movie with a bit higher hopes than I should have so thats my own fault.  But overall, this movie is not bad - just not what I thought perhaps.

The jist is that a demonic band comes to a small town to perform a rock concert.  Unknown to the adults of the town, the band is really playing the music of the devil and possesses the towns kids turning them into misfits and creatures of the night.

The effects are ok for a 1988' Rock/Horror movie.  But it just didn't hold my interest.  If this movie sounds like something you would like to see, then by all means check it out.  If not, then simply avoid it.  The final creature makeup was a little weak, but to see demonic creatures playing rock metal... damn thats fun stuff!",1191974400,3,746,4.204225352112676
