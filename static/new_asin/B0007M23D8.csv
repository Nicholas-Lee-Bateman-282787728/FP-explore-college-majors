2219847,5,B0007M23D8,"Once again, Asian cinema shows Hollywood how a truly great thriller is made. Koma plays on the well-known kidney thief legend, but it turns into a white knuckle psychological thriller. Wealthy but ill socialite Chi Ching (Angelica Lee) witnesses the horrifying aftermath of a kidney theft while attending a friend's wedding. Now determined to prove that the quiet yet eerie Suen Ling (Kar Yan Lam) is the culprit, Ching finds herself pulled into tense game of cat-and-mouse. Koma benefits from stunning production, spot-on acting, and great writing. If you love Asian cinema, especially horror and thriller genres, then Koma is definitely a must-have.",1114387200,9,651,5.330097087378641
2219848,5,B0007M23D8,"Urban Legends, while many times seem to be an American thing, often over lap in other cultures.  Koma is basically the story about the infamous waking up in a bathful of ice finding an internal organ missing.

Granted, your probably thinking been there, seen that, as I was before I watched it.  However with enough twists and creepy dialogue through the movie, this psychological thriller turns from bland to thought provoking.",1114214400,6,428,5.0
2219849,3,B0007M23D8,"This movie is remarkably engaging. Some lunatic is stealing people's kidneys bringing terror to a young girl in particular. She suspects her boyfriend's former fling is behind all these gruesome mutilations. Some kind of personal vendetta theory that proves to be wrong in the end.

Filled with twists and surprises, the storyline is entertaining and original to the eye.

Nevertheless, Tartan made a poor transfer of this movie. White speckles are ever present throughout the picture and a lot of the scenes present shaky and jumpy images.it becomes annoying and you would expect these flaws from older movies, not movies made recently. Tartan needs to do better transfers if they wish to be considered a serious studio,the same transfer problems are present in Wishing Stairs for instance.",1169769600,2,791,5.2204724409448815
2219850,1,B0007M23D8,"This movie is utterly unremarkable -- actually, scratch that.  This movie is actually VERY remarkable -- because of how BAD it is.  First of all, the protagonist is pathetic: it's impossible for the viewer to sympathize with her because she is just a pitiful, weak person who does absolutely nothing to try and solve her problems; all she does is cry and moan.  Second, the actors are some of the most wooden and stiff performers I've seen in any movie.  Third, there are some plot gaps and questions that never get answered, which disrupt the movie's flow and continuity; for example, the protagonist gets hit head-on by an 18-wheeler truck, and her car is absolutely mangled, but she walks away without a scratch.  Someone care to explain how that's possible?

I probably would have stopped watching this piss-poor excuse for a movie if I wasn't at a friend's house (and there's the fact that it's his movie): I sat through it just to be polite.  When all is said and done, this movie just isn't worth your time.  I'm glad I'm not the one who actually paid my hard-earned dollars to buy this piece of dung.",1159833600,5,1108,4.61734693877551

Instead, the story is lame, the acting is pretty pathetic and it is so NOT scary or at least gripping. I watched the whole thing as I thought maybe I am missing something, but no there is no twist thats worth mentioning as the whole movie is predictable from beginning to end. Sorry guys, but this is nowhere near, Audition, Tale of two Sisters or even Whispering Corridors.",1156118400,6,497,4.533333333333333
2219852,4,B0007M23D8,"""Koma"" is one of them Hong Kong movies that not only shock us with gore and brutality but manage to surprise us with an intelligent plot, really good acting and unexpected twists. Those twists will keep coming till the very end so don't think to relax.

The film starts really paranoic with some strange images, intense atmosphere and a girl waking up in a bathtub full of ice with one of her kidneys removed. Little by little this moody evil atmosphere dissolves and we are taken to a seemingly other kind of a movie - psychological thriller. The major part looks like a cat and mouse game between two girls who have this kind of love-hate relationships. We are mastefully dragged into this game and are kept wondering all the time if there's anyone else involved. The ending will make you gasp in surprise - it's rather unlooked-for and smart.

""Koma"" is definately a film to enjoy, it's pretty I'd say. Asian cinema industry makes good and beautiful movies lately, they are stunning and very well crafted, they are utterly artistic and picturesque. Apart from being an intense thriller ""Koma"" seemed a rather comfortable movie to me. Don't know exactly how to explain it but it doesn't keep you on the edge of your seat (in a good way). It's not mean and uneasy. It's more like old thrillers which are pretty entertaining to watch nowdays with mixed feelings of fear and fun. ""Koma"" is rather old-fashioned I'd say, but also in a good way. You won't regret it if you spend an evening in the company of this wonderful movie.",1156032000,2,1526,4.627306273062731
2219853,4,B0007M23D8,"someone thought this movie wasn't believable, that I don't understand.  For me 99% of movies are not believable, unless theya re documentaries.  Does that make sense?  Maybe, maybe not...really, curious.

That aside...this movie is simple about ""who can you trust"".  That goes a long way without saying it when you watch it.  There's this girl, who may seem materialistic and shallow, actually looks past that when it comes to people.  She gives trust even when she has been betrayed...maybe a part of the character she plays.  It is as though she says, punch me in the face and then let me shake your hand...all is forgotten.

It seems as though she lives by that code, because of her ""condition"", she doesn't really have that chance, so she gives to others...hoping to only be rewarded.  Eventually though, someone sees what she does...and why she does it, and it changes them.

Urband legends and myths aside, it's about enduring trust.  Not many can give it, but it can change a person when it's offered.  Great acting from a lovely actress.",1153612800,3,1045,4.803370786516854
2219854,1,B0007M23D8,"Well I was once again duped by customers rating a product to high. There is no possible way this was a 5 star movie, the plot is just not believable, especially near the end.  Parts of it are quite suspenseful and the sound is very good I just had a hard time buying into the story.

spoiler: This movie is taken from the Urban legend of waking up in a tub filled with ice and a note telling you to call the police or hospital or you will die (because your kidney has been removed for sale on the black market). Well throw in a girl with a bad kidney her frustrated lover, a girl trying to raise money for her sick mother (these 3 characters create a twisted love triangle) and some guy who sets up the victims for the girl trying to raise the money for her mom. Girl A meets frustrated guy(Guy A), they have sex, Girl A meets frustrated guy's girl  friend (Girl B), Girl A and Girl B become best of friends after Girl B finds out Girl A had sex with her man(Guy A). Girl A's business parter (guy B) try's to get Girl B's kidney but finds out it is bad. Girl B try's to buy kidney on black market with Girl A's help and police show up and kill Guy B. Girl A finds out Girl B tipped off the police and so she attacks Guy A because he only uses her for sex and she then removes Girl B's bad kidney and  then removes her own kidney and puts it in the tub of ice with girl b as a gift. Girl A calls the police then dies. The police arrive and place Girl A 's kidney in Girl B. Girl B finds out she is ok because they put back her kidney, but it is not her kidney it is her friends (Girl A ). So she wants it removed because they are not friends anymore.",1141257600,9,1649,3.8988095238095237
2219855,5,B0007M23D8,"Based on a story about the urban legend of organ theft, KOMA is a nonstop, tautly-written thriller that covers just about every negative, ugly human emotion in the book! Jealousy, insecurity, betrayal, lust, deceipt, manipulation, and fear push the characters to the edge. Minds and mettle are tested and allegiances are formed and broken quickly.

From the first frame, the pace of this movie does not let up. The characterizations are fantastic and built less with dialouge than with action, physical reactions, face shots, and other wordless communication. The camera work is gorgeous: eerie, at times aggressive, modern, stark, cold. There is a fair amount of gore in this film: blood, physical pain; what the film lacks in gore, it makes up for in the sick, calculating thoughts of its depraved protagonist.

This is real dystopian psychological horror! A great entry in the J-horror canon, this is not a film for the squeamish, but for those who like to explore the underbelly of human emotion and the dark thoughts and actions a mind betrayed can go to, then KOMA will not disappoint!",1135641600,5,1091,4.989010989010989
2219856,5,B0007M23D8,"Koma is the most mentally disturbing movies i have ever seen. While the graphic violence is kept to a low (by todays standards) and the gore level in the movie is barely enough to warrant a ""horror"" movie label and is not really scary. What Koma does better than any other movie i have ever seen in the ""horror/physiological thriller"" category is it truly picks away at your mind and you will be left thinking about it for days. Read the above review for direct details of the story, but trust me when i say that the description tells you nothing about the true nature of this movie.

 When you buy this movie don't start thinking about movies like  American physco, identity, silence of the lambs, and so many American movies out there. All those listed are good movies, they left you thinking and played a few tricks on you. But the difference between koma and the above listed is that Koma will actually leave a forever mark in your brain. Leaving you wondering if the author of the movie is actually a psychiatrist who studied the human psyche for 60 years and decided to write this movie just to screw with anyone who watches it.

To finish i can only say that its a one of a kind and anyone who enjoys the genre will absolutely love it.",1134691200,5,1242,4.4104803493449785
2219857,5,B0007M23D8,"this is a very intelligent film.  while darkly disturbing it is also an extremely sensitive portrayal of the feminine psyche - loving, needing to be loved and quite strong.  it's outstanding!  the best film i've seen of its type, period...",1127865600,3,239,4.925
2219858,4,B0007M23D8,"""Koma"" is a surprisingly suspenseful film.  While there is enough gore to certainly warrant horror flick categorization, director Chi-Leung Law delivers a very old school Hitchcock suspense tale.  Close-ups on objects like a foot dragging across the floor leaving a bloodstained trail heighten the suspense and move the story.  Angelica Lee as Fung Chi-Ching, a girl who needs a new kidney and has inhibitions that keep her from fully embracing her boyfriend, does a good job and hits many levels from hysteria to jealousy to drunken delirium.  Andy Hui who plays her boyfriend, Dr. Tsui Wai-man, hits a number of levels also from the guy in love to the man whose hormones outpace his common sense.  As researcher Suen Ling, Karena Lam projects a person who has had a difficult upbringing and as frequently as not walks on the shady side of the street.  The twists of plot that trace a kidney thief who black-markets organs for $60,000 a pop never leaves you quite settled until the final frame.  Subtitled with Chinese dialog the often sparsely verbal picture translates well to an international audience.  ""Koma"" turns out to be a pleasant, often intelligent, surprise.  Enjoy!",1117670400,20,1179,5.005128205128205

8048784,3,B0007M23D8,"<strong>Jiu Ming</strong> (Chi-leung Law, 2004)

...and then there was <em>Jiu Ming</em> (released in the west as <em>Koma</em>), the second organ-harvesting mystery/thriller to cross my desk in the space of twenty-four hours. It's a fun little movie with a punchy pace, a good mystery storyline (though it does, at time, feel as if it wears its <em>CSI</em>-loving heart on its sleeve too much), and enough wit to keep you merrily rolling along.

It starts off with a lavish wedding in a hotel. After seeing the bride and groom to their suite, an excessively drunk party guest stumbles into the wrong door, assuming it's hers, and finds a naked woman crawling from the bathroom leaving a trail of blood behind her; her kidney has been harvested (a la the urban legend involving waking up in a bathtub covered in ice, with a lipsticked note on the mirror to call 911). Tell me that's not right out of a CSI episode. In any case, one of the guests, Ching (<em>The Eye</em>'s Sin-je Lee), notices while looking through video of the reception at the police station that there's one person in the lobby who wasn't with the wedding and points her out. The police then go and find her and bring her in for questioning. This turns out to be Ling (<em>Silk</em>'s Kar-yan Lam), but she had a very different reason for being in the hotel... and that's as far as I can go without spoilers. There are a number of other reviews you can read that will give you more details, if you like. I wish I could, because it's once we get the connections between the three principals (the other is Ching's fiancee, Wai) that things really start moving here.

On one level, <em>Jiu Ming</em> is a straight police procedural that focuses more on the civilians involved than it does on the police, who are only ever in the movie as a peripheral presence. On the other, it's a great all-twisted-up kinda romance movie that also happens to involve organ harvesting. It could have used better pacing in a few places, and it could have been a touch less predictable in other places (though the two big twists, one in the climax and the other in the very last scene, were well-executed and unpredictable), but overall quite a good little thriller, worth seeking out. ***",1325116800,,2239,4.692111959287532
8048785,4,B0007M23D8,"Koma is a neat little film that doesn't break any new ground but is successful in what it sets out to do. I'm hesitant to say too much about the plot as it's best to go in blind considering the twisty nature of the story. All I'll say is that it is about the tumultuous relationship between two very different and troubled women framed by a mystery about organ thefts. It's more about the relationship than the organ thefts though, so admittedly if you're looking for a crime thriller or something similar you will likely be disappointed. I personally found myself more interested in the two characters and their struggles so this wasn't a problem. Karena Lam and Angelica Lee both give great performances, with Lam in particular stealing the show. She alternates between being scary to sympathetic and you're never sure of what to expect from her.

I've read elsewhere that many found the plot to be predictable, but I found many of the twists to be genuinely surprising.  In retrospect, some elements require a bit of suspension of disbelief and there's one bizarre scene that is never referenced again that will have some scratching their head, but overall I found it to be a compelling story. Perhaps it lags a little in the middle but it picks up soon after. The ending is very exciting and really pays off the viewer's patience.

In terms of special features, we get a commentary track from the director and a brief featurette. One shouldn't be too picky as foreign films like this rarely get any features, but the ones here are pretty lacking. The featurette is standard EPK fluff, and the commentary itself is one of the more duller commentaries I've listened to. A lot of the time he ends up repeating ""I think so and so did a good job here. They look really scared. You can tell they look scared because of their eyes.""  Having the two actresses with him might have made it more interesting; usually when there is more than one person talking, the tracks tend to be livelier.

Overall, if you're a fan of Asian cinema, you could do a lot worse. Recommended.",1313107200,,2067,4.62125340599455
8048786,2,B0007M23D8,"This movie I just found too predictable and figured it early. FF and yup I was right about everything. It's just strange to believe That a woman would hate another woman so much and she would go through all this trouble. I just didn't by the film because the motives behind it all were just too...well shallow. This might have been a good movie in the hands of better writers. The entire Kidney thing is just a sub plot you can figure out 30 minutes in. Sadly it's supposed to be a strong point of this movie because it revolves around this organ jacking business and it fails. Sympathy for Mr. Vengeance this movie isn't. I gave this move 2 stars because I enjoyed watching the ""bad kidney girl"" suffer. Her character was pretty annoying and needy and those few scenes rewarded me with a reason to watch then than skip over it.

Overall this movie is so so and it gets a so so rating.",1295049600,,885,4.331325301204819
8048787,3,B0007M23D8,"There are some nonsense plot twists in the film involving the protagonist rendering decisions that no right-minded person ever would.  My girlfriend and I had to pause the movie to discuss how absurd a few of them were.  The worst is when the main woman in the story befriends her husband's mistress.  This would never happen.

Despite the nonsense, they keep the film at a nice brisk pace where you don't worry much about that sort of stuff because something new is happening.

There are a few mystery elements of the story that are kept well hidden until the reveal at the end of the film.  There are a few dead giveaways for others.  The conflict between the actors seems well acted and the director conveys dread and suspense well.  Its silightly above average, but only by a hair.",1244678400,,785,4.597122302158273
8048788,3,B0007M23D8,"Everyone know the urban legend about the woman who wakes up in a tub of ice to find her kidneys have been stolen. ""Koma"" takes that urban myth and expands it into a 90 minute movie. A kidney thief is on the lose in Hong Kong. Following a friend's wedding reception, Ching, who is in need of a kidney transplant, encounters this killer and only narrowly escapes. From this point, the film could easily have turned into a standard serial-killer-chasing-screaming-teenagers type movie, which is what you would expect if it was made by Hollywood. However, instead of going down that path, the film becomes a case study of the actions and emotions of the three central character: Ching; Ching's boyfriend Wai; and Ling, a girl whom Wai is sleeping with, who Ching becomes friends with and who may or may not be the kidney thief. The fact that this film focusses on the actions of these three characters makes it more interesting that if it were just made up of a series of bloody crimes, and in fact, I found myself constantly wondering what the next plot development would be (something which rarely happens in most horror films).

Having said all of that, ""Koma"" is less than perfect. It took me about half an hour to figure out what was actually going on in the movie, and the motives of some of the characters actions are now always clear (even after reaching the end of the movie, I still found that the only way that some of Ling's actions could be explained is if she were clinically insane). Furthermore, I found the ending to be both predictible and completely ludicrous.

If you're looking for a teenage hack-and-slash along the lines of ""Scream"" or ""Friday the 13th"", then you will probably find this film to be slow moving and unsatisfying. However, if you are looking for a more intelligent horror movie that is different from what you have seen in the past, then it is worth giving this film a try.",1199664000,,1907,4.605882352941176

I always worry when I read a film-description involving the words ""serpentine thriller."" ""Serpentine"" like Miike's ""Koroshiya 1"" (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Ichi-the-Killer/dp/B0000CABGW/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Ichi the Killer</a>)? Between the non-linear plot and reading the subtitles, a ""fun film"" turned into a gargantuan mental-exercise (this is not the film's fault, but mine). Or maybe it would be ""serpentine"" like Kim Ji-Woon's ""Janghwa, Hongryeon"" (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/A-Tale-of-Two-Sisters/dp/B000FZEQFA/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">A Tale of Two Sisters</a>)? That film was two steps ahead of me throughout (again, this is my shame). So when I ordered Law Chi-Leung's ""Jiu Ming"" (""Koma""), I was worried ... needlessly.

The plot is linear and effortless to follow: think a combination of Blanks'&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Urban-Legend/dp/0767824954/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Urban Legend</a>&nbsp;(but featuring adults) with a dash of Lyne's&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Fatal-Attraction/dp/B00003CXA0/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Fatal Attraction</a>&nbsp;(but sans the bunny-boiling). The main thrust of the film is the infamous ""kidney heist"" myth (including ice-baths and the  ""Call 911 or You Will Die"" scrawl). But, twists abound. (Better add a pinch of novice-Hitchcock).

The cinematography is above-average. The use color is clever: Chi Ching's (Angelica Lee's) renal-disease is emphasized by her yellow wardrobe while Suen Ling's (Kar Yan Lam's) red wardrobe is used to foreshadow. Nicely done. Furthermore, the acting is both convincing and engaging ... but not enough to boost this film to stellar status. The film's flaw is the writing ... it was a bit transparent (especially the conclusion). Moreover, a head-on collision with a semi that results in no injury ... tooth extractions that go unnoticed until a mirror becomes convenient ... these moments challenge our suspension of disbelief. And thus, three stars for the great idea, but only adequate writing.

Nonetheless, if you are seeking a less-demanding but still interesting film (and can be patient with slow exposition), you may find this work worth your time.",1196121600,3,2390,6.874587458745874
8048791,3,B0007M23D8,"Directed by Chi-Leung Law, ""Koma"" boasts a fine supporting cast. The film begins with a wedding party, and one of the brides' friends Ching (Angelica Lee) discovering the bleeding body of a woman who has had her kidney removed. Angelica Lee gave a wonderful performance in the horror film, ""The Eye,"" which is highly recommended. Also starring in this film, is the antagonist and sometimes protagonist (Kar Yan Lam) whose character Ling, is not all that she seems. Kar Yan Lam gave wonderful performances in the horror films ""Inner Senses"" and ""Silk,"" which are also highly recommended. The film basically is a long drawn out drama, in which the police are trying to find the person or persons responsible for the theft of kidneys.

Moreover, caught in the midst of this drama, is Wai, who is the boyfriend of Ching---yet he also has a connection to Ling. I did not find this to be a very satisfying film. The drama was stretched out way too long, and the police who are investigating these organ thefts are left in the background. This film seemed more like a drama than a thriller or a suspense film. Almost tame in nature. I am not into gore, so for me that was a plus in the film. I thought the film could have used a lot more suspenseful moments and what little there was did not appeal to me. That is not to say that some viewers will not like this film. It will appeal to some viewers and not to others.

Although not suspenseful enough for me, this is how the film is presented, therefore, I must take it for what it is. It's not that it is a bad film, it just isn't that good either. The focus of the film is for the most part the interaction between Ching (Angelica Lee) and Ling (Kar Yan Lam). Both of these actresses are great performers, and with such talent you expect the film to be much better than what it was. Once again, I am not into gore, and that is one of the positive points of the film. However, I also like good suspense which this film lacks. I own the film, and would not discourage others from viewing it, just don't expect too much, and you will not be disappointed. Rent it first.",1190246400,,2111,4.38265306122449
8048792,4,B0007M23D8,"I thought that *Koma* was an interesting foreign thriller.  *Koma* is based on the popular urban legend of one waking up in a bathtub of ice with a kidney surgically removed.

Ching is a beautiful woman who is drunk while celebrating her friend's wedding.  After the wedding, she accidently stumbles into a hotel room where a woman is pleading for help, after her kidney has been removed.  She is questioned by the police and comforted by her strict traditional family and her boyfriend, Wai.

Surprisingly, the movie moves at a reasonably quick pace.  Almost immediately, Ching is being stalked...obviously, for her kidney.  Predictably, she is captured and drugged for the surgery.  However, things changed at the last minute and she is spared from surgery.  We soon find out that she has a kidney disorder and is in dire need of a replacement or she'll soon be on dialysis.

Meanwhile, she befriends a woman named Ling.  Ling has a past with Wai.  In fact, she still has some connections with Wai.  Wai has been giving her money to help Ling with her dying mother's accumulating medical bills.  However, Ling reveals to Ching that they've been having affairs the whole time.

In the midst of Ching's confusion, hurt and revenge, Ching has to determine who is the actual kidney thief.  This is where suspense builds up and it is good.  But that's not all.  Ching gets an offer that she cannot refuse.  This is when things really get complicated but interesting.",1174262400,,1463,4.803212851405623
