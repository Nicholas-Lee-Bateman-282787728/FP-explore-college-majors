8185759,3,B000OONRVQ,"I like the audio CD.  BUT I was expecting to get the DVD with this ""set"".  I'm just learning the lap steel, so without the DVD it's not worth 20 bucks to me.  Maybe a year from now the CD will be helpful.  Just really disappointed the DVD was missing.",1391904000,2,251,3.96
8185760,5,B000OONRVQ,"What I love about this video is that it starts out by sounding each string to the proper tune. You can play it over as many times as you need. If you know nothing about lap steel this video can get you going, the guy talks real slow while explaining the basics. He shows things in a slow mode and then a regular mode. He is a real professional and gets into more advanced techniques as it progresses, it also comes with an audio cd with some very cool blues playing on it. You would be doing great to get that far, and he shows how you can do it. I would recommend anything that George Boards is teaching. This video is exactly what it says ""Basics and Blues"", it will help you very much.",1383436800,8,688,4.103703703703704

8185763,5,B000OONRVQ,"Hello! This is really good information and instruction. Be careful when you order, and make sure that you get the version that will play on your DVD player. I picked the PAL version and had to convert it to be able to play it since PAL is not a standard USA format.  Otherwise, have fun.",1196035200,2,287,4.218181818181818
