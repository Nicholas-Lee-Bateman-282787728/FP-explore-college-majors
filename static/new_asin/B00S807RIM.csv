Even better, this one has a better picture transfer with greater color fidelity and detail. And, it has the original mono track, not the phony stereo multiple version that the BU version had. The only thing that I miss is the Kim Newman commentary. This one is quite good, but it would have been great to have both. But no matter, this is a definitive version and was well worth the wait. Having bought this title multiple times from the days of VHS pan and scans, I can honestly say this is worth the quintuple dip.",1499904000,2,613,4.385964912280702
6963755,5,B00S807RIM,"I feel awful saying this, but this was my first time watching The Bird with the Crystal Plumage. I have seen most of Dario Argentos films, but oddly enough, I never got around to watching his directorial debut. Why? I have no sweet clue, but you know what? Im glad that I waited as I was able to finally watch the film for the first time on a fantastic Blu-ray release from Arrow Video. As for the film itself, hot damn was it ever good!

REVIEW

As previously mentioned, this is Argentos first foray into directing, and I have to hand it to the guy, he sure knows how to deliver a freaking solid Giallo. The film will have you guessing all the way to the end, as you ride along with Sam Dalmas (Tony Musante), who has witnessed a murder attempt at the beginning of the film. He eventually gets roped up in trying to figure how who the killer is, as the murderer has already struck three times previously, and he may just be next on the killer hit list.

The film has all the usual trappings (not a negative) of a Giallo, with the blacked gloved killer hunting down helpless damsels in distress, with the main character, a guy, of course, being the only one who can save the day. The main guy usually has to have a girlfriend or wife who is dumb as bricks and is only present to be saved. This time around, the wife is played by Suzy Kendall, whom you may know from the films Torso or Tales that Witness Madness.

As the film is a product of its time, you do have to suffer through a few scenes that are groan inducing. The biggest being a stalking scene involving Kendall, who comes across like a trapped animal in a corner, a corner that is full of weapons to defend yourself and a big barred door to keep the killer out. Why is she screaming her head off and crawling around on the floor? Oh, because she is a blonde hottie, meant to be saved.

Nevertheless, The Bird with the Crystal Plumage cultivates a killer story that has you glued to the screen, looking for clues to who is committing the murders. No spoilers from me! If you're a fan of films like Blood and Black Lace from Mario Bava, The Bird with the Crystal Plumage is going to be right up your alley. It may feel a bit different from Argentos later efforts, with Ennio Morricone providing the soundtrack instead of Argentos go to band Goblin, and the film lacks gore, but even with these differences, this is still one of Argentos finest films.

Arrow Video continues to outshine their competition with this superb Limited Edition release of The Bird with the Crystal Plumage. Packed in a cardboard case, you receive the movie on Blu-ray and DVD, a poster of the newly commissioned artwork (alternate poster on the back side), some nice lobby cards, and an excellent lengthy booklet featuring a bunch of essays and information on the film.

Things are already looking great before you even pop in the movie on Blu-ray. Once you do, you are treated to a stupendously upgraded viewing experience. The Bird with the Crystal Plumage has never looked this good (as this is my first time seeing the film, I can only say this because of caps-a-holic's wonderful comparison page). The colours are darker and more natural than previous Blu-ray releases. A lot of debris and scratches have been cleaned up, and the overall all viewing experience is highly enjoyable. As for the audio experience, the film provides you with both an English and Italian (English SDH subtitled) Lossless soundtrack. The film was dubbed post-production, so there are synching issues, which is common. I found the English track a bit louder in regards to dialogue, but either option is an absolutely acceptable listening experience.

After youve watched the movie, you can expect to dive into a healthy supply of special features. You have a bunch of interviews, which all are rather lengthy but never boring. The newly shot interview with Dario Argento is a big bonus. Also provided is an audio commentary with Troy Howarth, author of So Deadly, So Perverse: 50 Years of Italian Giallo Films. Rounding out the features are some trailers. Special feature fans will be pleased with this release, but I do have to wonder why there is no new audio commentary with Dario Argento.

VERDICT

The Bird with the Crystal Plumage is where it all started for Dario Argento, and unlike some directors, his first film is fantastic. His talent for the deadly mystery is very much evident in this early work of his, and the film provides us with a story that is worth watching over and over. What better way than with Arrow Videos sublime Limited Edition Blu-ray release.",1499817600,,4590,4.579780755176614
6963756,5,B00S807RIM,"A perfectly done transfer, which is all you need to know.  The film is the film - if you love it I can't imagine you not loving the transfer - it's never looked better or more accurate.  The packaging is terrific, too, if you like that sort of thing.  Lots of extras, but for me it's always about the film itself and I was very pleased with this transfer in every way.",1499385600,3,368,4.083333333333333
6963757,5,B00S807RIM,"I think every horror filmmaker has a single work that most audiences associate with when they hear his or her name.  When folks hear George Romero, Ill bet most think of NIGHT OF THE LIVING DEAD; when they talk about Lucio Fulci, they think ZOMBIE; and when the discussion turns to Dario Argento, they think SUSPIRIA.

But when I personally hear Argentos name, I immediately think of the film that put him on the map:  THE BIRD WITH THE CRYSTAL PLUMAGE.  This movie helped launch the giallo genre into the mainstream publics eye, and it also introduced a master filmmaker to the world.  Thanks to the fine folks at Arrow and MVD, THE BIRD WITH THE CRYSTAL PLUMAGE is available now on a special edition Blu-ray that offers a slew of extras in addition to an HD version of the movie.  Horror fans and thriller buffs alike will want to add this to their libraries immediately!

I had the pleasure of meeting Mr. Argento a few months ago at Texas Frightmare Weekend in Dallas, and the guy is a class act.  I found it very humbling to be in the presence of such a horror genius, and Im very thankful to have had the opportunity.  Interestingly, Arrow Video was also in attendance at TFW for the first time ever, and they show the restored version of THE BIRD WITH THE CRYSTAL PLUMAGE as one of the weekends film features.  This was obviously a major treat, since Argento was a featured guest.

THE BIRD WITH THE CRYSTAL PLUMAGE is shot very well, and the cinematography shows Argentos trademark style of stark color schemes and a bizarre patterns.  I love this aspect of his films, especially those seen in SUSPIRIA, because it draws the eye to unusual places on the screen.  The HD transfer is fantastic, and the Blu-ray gives both the picture and the sound a major upgrade to previous DVD versions.

The acting is very good, although Im not familiar with most of the cast.  A couple of names, like Suzy Kendall and Tony Musante stick out, but only because Ive heard them discussed within the context of this film.

The special effects are pretty good for the time period.  Many of the films I see from around this era contain paint-like blood, which are blood effects that are thin, runny, and overly bright.  The blood in THE BIRD WITH THE CRYSTAL PLUMAGE is actually darker than most, and therefore looks fairly realistic.

The plot is a slick whodunit with a nice twist at the end that I confess I did not see coming.  Argento is to be commended for his directing as well as his writing; he creates a clever serial-killer mystery that leaves you guessing until the end.

THE BIRD WITH THE CRYSTAL PLUMAGE is a major win for me, and Im extremely happy with how Arrow and MVD handled it.  This Limited Edition set has beautiful cover art and a host of special features.  Pick this one up soon, before they sell out!!",1499040000,2,2814,4.517786561264822

6963759,5,B00S807RIM,"Dario Argento's 1970 debut feature, the evocatively titled early giallo THE BIRD WITH THE CRYSTAL PLUMAGE, comes thrillingly fully formed, the seeming work of a filmmaker who had been helming movies for decades. Nevertheless, it is fascinating to see his unique style so early on, one that he would continue to ornately develop in later films such as 1971's THE CAT O'NINE TAILS and FOUR FLIES IN GREY VELVET, 1975's DEEP RED, 1977's SUSPIRIA, 1980's INFERNO, 1982's TENEBRAE, and 1985's PHENOMENA.

The striking Tony Musante stars as Sam Dalmas, an American author living in Italy who witnesses the attempted murder of an art gallery owner (Eva Renzi) and becomes embroiled in an investigation to finger the identity of a black-coated, black-gloved slasher terrorizing Rome. Few directors make movies as intoxicating as Dario Argento. His worlds (usually set in various exotic European cities) are immersive and dreamlike. His visuals and framing are rapturous, foreboding paintings come to life. His murder-mysteries are involving and lurid, often provocatively exploring sexuality, gender, and the finicky notions of point-of-view and memory. As for his mesmerizing horror set-pieces, they are frightening, tension-rich tour de forces which earned him the moniker of being ""the Italian Hitchcock."" He was something more than that, though, and his films of the '70s and '80s, especially, were helmed in a singular style unmistakably his own.

Arrow Video's new limited-edition Blu-ray is pure cinema nirvana, coming with a gorgeous new 4K restoration, an invaluable audio commentary from film historian Troy Howarth (author of ""So Deadly, So Perverse: 50 Years of Italian Giallo Films""), multiple insightful video essays, and a wonderful new 2017 interview with Argento himself. Can you tell I could gush over THE BIRD WITH THE CRYSTAL PLUMAGE and Argento and the giallo genre all day?",1498867200,5,1887,5.393220338983051
6963760,5,B00S807RIM,"I have to admit, as a horror fan, there is a pretty gaping hole in what films I've seen and it's basically shaped like Italy. I've seen a few of the classics (The Beyond, Demons to name a couple) but I haven't yet really dived into the works of Dario Argento. In fact, I've only seen two of his films: Phoenomena and Suspiria. Now, thanks to Arrow Video, I can jump into the works of this horror legend starting from his very first film, The Bird With The Crystal Plumage.

More of a mystery thriller than a horror film, the film centers around a writer who stumbles across an attempted murder and finds himself first a suspect and then searching for the real killer himself. As the bodies of young women pile up, the killer starts with threatening phone calls and eventually our hero becomes a target himself.

I was actually surprised at how tame this movie turned out to be. I was expecting far more gruesome scenes absed on my expecations for this genre. On the contrary, it's all rather subtle. While it's not the scariest of films, it's definetly a great mystery. I was running through the suspects for the entire film and never guessed what the actual outcome would be. It's a pretty well done story in that regard, even if it is a little unbeleiveable that this american writer is off solving murders.

I did enjoy seeing some hints at Argento's eventual use of color here. Some scenes really stand out with some interesting decoration and colors in the background.

You do get the dubbed version and the Italian version, although that seemed a bit dubbed as well, so whatever your preference is language wise for these types of films you should be satisfied.

In typical Arrow fashion, they've crafted a really stellar release for this film. If you can't tell from the special features listed above. It's really exciting that Arrow has been able to start bringing titles to the US and this release is a prime example of why you should be taking notice of their work. It's a really well designed box and a gorgeous presentation. The picture looks great and the sound is pristine.

Argento fans will love the set for its great features and the stellar presentation of the film itself. New fans will do well to take this as a perfect opportunity to dive into the works of Argento as The Bird With The Crystal Plumage is an excellent place to start.

The Bird With The Crystal Plumage is available now.",1498176000,4,2407,4.5707656612529
6963761,4,B00S807RIM,"The Bird With the Crystal Plumage,"" made in 1970 by first-time director Dario Argento (Suspiria), made its long-lasting mark on Italian cinema. This was a film that redefined the giallo genre of murder-mystery thrillers and led to international stardom for Argento.

Sam Dalmas (Tony Musante), an American writer living in Rome, inadvertently witnesses a brutal attack on a woman (Eva Renzi) in a modern art gallery. Powerless to help because of a mechanical door, he grows increasingly obsessed with the incident. Convinced that something he saw that night holds the key to identifying the maniac terrorizing Rome, he launches his own investigation parallel to that of the police, heedless of the danger to both himself and his girlfriend, Giulia (Suzy Kendall).

Argento is more concerned with plot twists than with gore, which became a trademark of his later films. Borrowing a page from the Hitchcock Playbook, the film uses the plot device of an innocent person drawn into intrigue. As Sam undergoes his own investigation, he encounters a series of odd characters, contributing to an unsettling feeling. There are killings, but what stands out and makes the movie especially memorable is its excellent use of suspense  the anticipation of what might happen at any moment. Many veteran directors never master this tricky technique, but Argento incorporates it as if its second nature. Because Bird is his directorial debut, this is all the more impressive. Though not as graphic as American slasher films of the 1980s, The Bird With the Crystal Plumage was definitely an influence.

Bonus materials on the 2-disc Blu-ray + DVD Combo Pack include new audio commentary by Tony Howarth, author of So Deadly, So Perverse: 50 Years of Italian Giallo Films; The Power of Perception, a visual essay on the cinema of Dario Argento; new analysis of the film by critic Kat Ellinger; new interview with writer/director Dario Argento; interview with actor Gildo Di Marco (Garullo the pimp); reversible sleeve featuring original and newly commissioned artwork; and limited edition 60-page illustrated booklet.",1498003200,4,2100,5.259701492537314

8697566,5,B00S807RIM,"The 1970 film is a stylish, elegant and macabre mystery.  As it was the director's directorial debut, the story line, performances and violence are fairly grounded and less graphic compared to his later works where he pushed them to near surreal heights (Suspiria, Tenebrae, Phenomena, Opera).  Still though, the delicious, morbid atmosphere and innovative flourishes are unmistakably by the black gloved hand of the famous director.

The 2017 Arrow Video Limited Edition is truly superb.  Starting with the excellent packaging: a blu-ray, DVD and lobby card reproductions are housed in a plastic case that sits within a sturdy cardboard slip along with a poster reproduction and book of essays. The discs come with many great extras, my favorites being the commentary by Argento-phile Troy Howarth, and a new, surprisingly frank 30 minute interview with the director.

8697568,5,B00S807RIM,"There is a fine line between what we consider horror and the movie genre known as the thriller. Horror makes us think of monsters both big and small, ghosts and goblins and the otherworldly. Thrillers tend to be suspense filled movies where a deep plot concerns the future of the known world. But there was a time when thrillers fell into the horror category, stories of murders most foul by killers we thought normal before their acts were revealed.

One group of films captured this style of movie, often made in Italy and given the term giallo, Italian for yellow. This was due to a series of mysteries released in that color and designated by the yellow covers they sported. Many consider the film THE GIRL WHO KNEW TOO MUCH made by Mario Bava as the first movie of this genre. But while he may have begun the genre it was director Dario Argento who mastered it and made it more popular. And his first film as director, THE BIRD WITH THE CRYSTAL PLUMAGE, is now available in pristine condition from Arrow Video.

The story is straightforward it seems. Writer Sam Dalmas (Tony Musante) has been in Italy for a few months trying to get over a case of writers block. Authoring a non-fiction book to make ends meet he now has the funds to return to the US with his girlfriend, model Julia (Suzy Kendall). Taking a walk through the city before heading home he sees something going in the local gallery. A dark clothed figure is in the middle of trying to stab a woman to death.

Sam runs to her aid but finds himself up against a pane of glass, the doorway into the gallery. As he tries to enter the fleeing killer presses a button and traps him between the two doors this and the pane behind him. A passerby sees him and Sam sends him for help. When the police arrive the woman is still alive and Sam becomes the initial suspect in her attempted murder putting an end to his plans to leave.

Disturbed by what he saw, Sam tries to help the man investigating the attack, Inspector Morosini (Enrico Maria Salerno). It seems that this was not the first such attack to happen. A series of murders of young women has been taking place and frightening the entire city. With alibis for those murders suspicion is lifted from Sam but he continues to investigate on his own, knowing that there is something he is forgetting, something he saw that night that continues to elude him.

The deeper Sam digs into the case the more danger he places himself and Julia in. A phone call from the killer reveals just how much danger that involves. As the clues mount and the victims increase, it is only a matter of time before the killer makes an attempt on Sam or Julia. With each clue he discovers Sams memory begins to un-cloud and the killer will be revealed, a killer most will never guess.

All the ingredients of a typical giallo film are here. There is the killer, clothed all in black wearing black gloves we see time and time again. They select the knives he uses to kill, dial the phone and more. The involvement of the police detectives trying to find the killer is there. The gore filled (for its time) murder sequences are there. And the innocent victim accused of the crime who tries to find the real killer is the centerpiece of this film.

Elements of the giallo can be found in numerous movies made since and a few before. But the style was put to the greatest effect by the Italians and Argento in particular. In this and subsequent films his sense of style was such that it was easily recognizable and marveled over by fans of the genre. He went on to not only work in this genre but horror as well, most notably when he created the Three Mothers series of films that began with SUSPIRIA. His use of color and light, of shadows and mysterious visions and the use of electronic music (most often by the band Goblin) all worked together to make some of the most visually arresting movies in the most horrific of genres.

As with previous efforts Arrow has done and amazing job here making this worthy of adding to any collection. The film comes in a brand new 4k restoration from the camera negative making it the best version visually released to date. Extras include Italian and English soundtracks, English subtitles, audio commentary by giallo historian/author Troy Howarth, The Power of Perception visual essay by author Alexandra Heller-Nicholas, analysis of the film by critic Kat Ellinger, a new interview with Dario Argento, an interview with actor Gildo Di Marco and a limited edition 60 page booklet about the film. As you can see they jam pack the extras.

As a horror fan I was glad to finally get the chance to see this film and in this condition. As I said earlier, it is one for movie fans to add to their collections and for all others to seek out to watch. Last week I discussed the disappearance of DVD or the question of will it happen. If movies of this caliber are released in this format then the odds of that decrease.",1500163200,8,4942,4.488320355951057
8697569,5,B00S807RIM,"The giallo didn't begin with Dario Argento, but his directorial debut, The Bird with the Crystal Plumage, is a signpost most critics and fans recognize as the defining moment which inspired the Italian film industry to flood the market with copycat productions featuring black-gloved killers, vapid victims and ridiculously obtuse titles.  Argento himself participated in the process, considerably upping the gore and downsizing the plot with each new entry.  But in 1970, Bird served as his calling card to the international film industry, and as such the director crafted a film much more reserved and professional than his later work, which suffered glorious highs (Deep Red, Suspiria) and embarrassing lows (Trauma, Phantom of the Opera).  Bird is a roadmap to the genre before it became muddied with the footprints of countless producers looking for a quick buck.  And while it may lack the visceral punch it once had, it retains the cinematic integrity lacking in most of the films it inspired.

Sam Dalmas (Tony Musante) is a writer wrapping up a job in Italy, but the night before hes set to fly back to the States he witnesses an assault on a woman inside an art gallery.  Separated from the victim by glass doors, he watches helplessly as she bleeds on the floor and her supposed attacker escapes; supposed because Sam is bothered by something he sawsome vital piece of evidence he cant quite pin down.

This opening sequence is the highlight of the film and a perfect example of Argentos skill at prolonging onscreen suffering, a talent used primarily for exploitational purposes in later films.  Here he expertly puts us in Sams shoes; helplessness, frustration and fear all mingling into an uncomfortably powerful experience.  Visually, Argento and cinematographer Vittorio Storaro (Apocalypse Now) create an uneasy mood with striking camera angles interrupted by memory flashes of still images playing back in the protagonists mind.

That Bird shows the genesis of an often brilliant visual style is no surprise; Argento evolved (or devolved, depending on your taste) along those lines from this point forward.  But here he also works with a fully developed script and capable actors that ground the film.  Musante in particular is a very sympathetic focal point for the audience, and his pursuit of a mystery better left alone is portrayed convincingly.  Argentos script plants hints and red herrings (which include a macabre painting and a squeaky sound effect) in typical Hitchcockian fashion, finally using a psychologist to explain away the killers identity and motivation, just as ol Hitch did in Psycho.

Those expecting liberal amounts of gore will be disappointed as most of the terrorizing amounts to a splatter of red coming from offscreen.  And Bird comes nowhere near reaching the lunatic dream-logic nightmares Argento is now best known for.  But what he does deliver is just as rare  a well-rounded thriller of wit, nuance and ice cold dread.

Bird has always been the Argento film that earned mainstream respect and it's had a number of quality home video releases already.  But Arrow Video tops them all in terms of HD transfer and extras.  Visually, it's a real stunner with an impeccably film-like presentation that embraces the grain without losing the clarity.  And most of the extras are new material including a commentary from author Troy Howarth, a spot-on visual essay, new analysis by crtic Kat Ellinger, new interviews with Argento and actor Gildo Di Marco (who plays an pimp with an endearing stutter) and limited edition booklet with illustrations.",1499990400,4,3592,5.126929674099485
