2034704,4,B0001WTVI4,"Tibby Bloom (Dina Manoff) is a widowed high-speed getaway car driver who polished her skills in crowded Beverly Hills shopping malls where ""it's every Mercedes for itself."" After being ""flossed"" by her husband, penniless Tibby becomes maid to her favorite songstress, the garish Jasmine Jones (Nell Carter) who has some personnel issues as a byproduct of her crass personality. While preparing a banquet for a group of prominent producers and investors, Tibby discovers more than cobwebs in the closet. Unwilling to be framed for murder, the further they try to run, the closer they get to one another.

Perhaps one reason why Dina Manoff appears so comfortable in her role is because she is the writer and an executive producer. With a larger budget, this television comedy would have done far better than many of the so-called silver screen Hollywood blockbusters. Despite its grainy television resolution, MAID FOR EACH OTHER will have even the most depressed widowers choking on their Haagen Dazs from laughter.

When Tibby Bloom's (Dinah Manoff) husband leaves her a grieving widow, things seem bad enough, but when she finds out he's left her with nothing but memories and bills to pay, things quickly get worse!  As her only skills are organizing her social calender and the staff who took care of her house, Tibby has no choice by to take a job as a maid for famous singer Jasmine Jones (Nell Carter). The two get off to a rocky start but when Jasmine's husband is found murdered and she is framed for the crime, she turns to the only person who can help her - her new maid!

2034739,3,B0001WTVI4,This is a comedy starring Nell Carter. Her ex husband is found dead in her closet. She and the new maid bring the body back to his apartment so his death will not ruin Nell's comeback as a torch singer. Nell and the maid try to out run the police in an effort to find out who killed Nell's ex and why. There are a lot of funny scenes. It was a little long. I thought after I could have fast forwarded through the singing and it would have been better.  Not that Nell's voice is bad. Just didn't love it.,1448323200,,503,3.98019801980198

2034928,3,B0001WTVI4,"Probably a made for T.V. movie from the 80's, it still had a few slapstick moments and silliness you would expect in a comedy. Nell Carter and Dinah Manoff play their characters well. They bounce off each other hilarious quips and one liners. If you are looking for nonsensical humor, this flick is just the ticket. Its hard to get a belly laugh out of me, but this movie did get some well deserved chuckles. I loved hearing Nell sing again.

2034932,1,B0001WTVI4,but not a great movie and the acting was forced. I love these actors but was sorry to see it didn't cut it for me.,1389139200,,114,3.6
2034933,5,B0001WTVI4,Nell Carter is a a favorite actor!  She brings humor and class to the show. A good clean movie for the family!,1389052800,,110,4.0
2034934,3,B0001WTVI4,very old show- watched while cleaning house to have background sounds- would not purchase and was available bc of prime memebership,1388966400,,131,5.285714285714286
2034935,4,B0001WTVI4,"I enjoyed the movie, it had a very interesting storyline that held my attention.  There were a few slow parts but all in all I enjoyed it.  Excellent for the whole family",1388793600,,170,4.28125
2034936,5,B0001WTVI4,"So many movies these days seem to be filled with unpleasant things, they did a great job with this one!  No worries about the kids walking in and you stay entertained!  Not to mention the amazing voice that woman has!  :D",1388793600,,221,4.341463414634147
2034947,1,B0001WTVI4,"I didn't stay with this film very long. I think within 30 minutes, I fell asleep. I found it very boring and not well made.",1388275200,4,123,3.96
2034948,4,B0001WTVI4,"Somewhat original, lots of laughs and fun to watch.  More than I expected from this type of movie.  While not a blockbuster, certainly entertaining.",1387843200,,148,5.125
2034949,5,B0001WTVI4,"This was very Funny, Dinah Manoff acting was on key, as usual, always love to hear, that sweet voice of Nell's. They are showing reruns of give me a break, on analog tv.",1386979200,,169,4.151515151515151
2034950,3,B0001WTVI4,I am a Nell Carter fan.  So I watched the movie for that reason alone.  Mildly entertai ing.  Certainly nothing deep in the script.  Just an opportunity to hear the music of a talent gone too soon.,1386374400,,197,4.243243243243243
2034951,1,B0001WTVI4,"I know the synopsis stated the premise that somebody shows up dead, but I did not expect to see the supposed hilarity revolve around the mishandling and abuse of a human corpse.  The repeated visuals of the disrespected body struck a bad note for me.  Maybe this does not bother most people but if you find it as distasteful as I do then you won't like seeing this. I abandoned this wreck.",1385164800,8,389,4.388888888888889

2034953,4,B0001WTVI4,Maid For Each Other was corny but cute. I enjoyed it. Would I watch it again? ...Possibly. I think my husband might enjoy it if he needed a mindless lighthearted movie to distract him from life :),1383868800,,196,4.324324324324325
2034954,4,B0001WTVI4,Nell Carter did a wonderful job. Would like to see her popping up in more movies. Dianne Manoff fit her role completely. It was clean good humor that will make you laugh.,1382140800,,170,4.34375
2034955,1,B0001WTVI4,I thought this was movie was very slow and boring.  The acting was mediocre at best.  Stopped it half way through.,1380412800,7,114,4.380952380952381
2034956,4,B0001WTVI4,Nell Carter is so funny in this movie. (RIP) You can tell that she was being herself. Smart attitude and witty remarks. Great singing voice as well. Good to see Dinah Manoff here too. (She played Marty Maraschino on Grease) She plays a gal that lost her husband and all the money. She is too chic to be a maid but a real good talker. As in she can talk her way out of almost anything. I don't want to say too much cause who really reads the long ratings? Hehe. Enjoy!,1380153600,,467,4.086956521739131
