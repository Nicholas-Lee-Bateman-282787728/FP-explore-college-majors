4916459,5,B0060MYJRC,This show is fantastic.  It has me seriously considering the costly subscription to Showtime.  The characters are all great and the actors do a terrific job with them.,1348963200,,167,4.928571428571429
4916460,5,B0060MYJRC,"I've watched the UK Shameless, and really didn't think the US Shameless would be able to compete.  Boy was I wrong, the US version has a lot more depth to the characters.  Love it.",1348444800,,180,4.264705882352941
4916461,5,B0060MYJRC,"NO SPOILERS:

When Howard Stern first moved to NBC NY, management tried to control him.  He rebelled.  Then the ratings came out.  Most enlightening was that the people who proclaimed to despise Stern, actually stayed with the show longer than fans.  The reason?  ""Because they wanted to see/hear what happened next!""

Shameless is a cornucopia of taboos that is marketing material for the Christian Right/Family Values Coalition!  Homosexuality, drug and alcohol abuse, child neglect, frequent sex, criminality, etc.

Shameless is a dark comedy that is both shocking and funny with enough gratuitous sex and nudity to take the edge off a typical Sunday Night after having spent the lion share of the day watching football.  There are also from time to time some real dramatic moments added to the mix.  However, the main reason why I regularly tune in and have rated this *5 is because I find myself in the position of continually wanting to see ""what happens next.""

The usual comedic fare these days are situation comedies, which while serialized, are often presented in a manner so that they can be watched on a stand-alone basis.  Shameless is constantly evolving, thus to get best viewing experience one should start from the beginning.

My highest rating for a dark situational comedy",1348099200,6,1291,5.028301886792453
4916462,4,B0060MYJRC,"If you're easily scandalized, this show is NOT for you! It gets more and more intense by the episode and delivers one shocker after another towards the end of the season (including, but not limited to, several shots of a vagina mid-birth). The storylines are more intense than they were in the first season and Emmy Rossum's performance is better than ever. I will, however, only rate it 4 stars as the beginning of the season failed to impress me and while it got much better week by week, I simply didn't enjoy it as much as I did the first.

It's still highly entertaining television and if you like Showtime original programming I definitely suggest you watch it!",1347753600,,667,4.605042016806722
4916463,5,B0060MYJRC,"Probably one of the best shows on TV. All the actors are great, even the kids, and we can all easily connect with their characters. It's almost impossible not to like this show. I also love the comedy resulted by all those hard situations they have to go through.

Shameless is one of the best shows to come along in a long time. Sometimes the depictions of life on America's edge are so real I can barely watch. While veteran character actors like Wm Macy and Joan Cusack deliver every week, the children in this show are phenomenal. Some of the best acting from young people I have ever seen. Lip breaks my heart - a brilliant kid with no blueprint for success. Karen and Fiona are two sides of the same coin - achingly vulnerable one minute and steel backbone the next. I have been Fiona at times in my life (as a single mother in poverty) the actress hits so many nuanced notes - brilliant. whoever writes this knows the alcoholic dance intimately and is fearless. Thank you to all involved in this amazing show. I cannot wait for next January!

This show is very well written and the actors fit their characters extremely well. this show is a real down and dirty type of show that has real life situations and puts it into a show. this is my favorite show that is a mixture of drama and comedy at some parts. although this family may by dysfunctional, there are times of real unity which makes the show even better.

Please let me know if my review has helped you in your inquiry or purchase!",1347580800,8,1497,4.377697841726619
4916464,5,B0060MYJRC,This has got to be the funniest show ever. Every single kid (except the baby/toddler) is a con artist and opportunist. It just gets better and better. Along with laughing the 2nd season made me cry too. Great writing and great acting. It doesn't get any better than this!,1347494400,,271,4.551020408163265
4916465,5,B0060MYJRC,"I can't wait until season two comes out on DVD.  Shameless is totally different and fantastically written, directed and the actors superbly cast. If it continues with this great ensemble, it will last season after season for years.",1336176000,14,231,5.078947368421052
4916466,5,B0060MYJRC,"I've recently decided that Shameless is the best show on television currently. It's the kind of series that's so fast-moving, so well acted and written, that you can watch it over and over again and notice new quirks each time. Some people would probably call the show's lack of shame tasteless. To me, it's exciting. You truly don't know what's going to happen next!

The second season started out a little slow, but once Frank's mother (""Grammy"") shows up, things really kick into gear. Played with utter relish by the great Louise Fletcher, Grammy's a force of nature. And let's just say, her character arc ends in quite a... shocking way.

Season Two also sees the return of Chloe Webb as Monica Gallagher, Frank's estranged wife and altogether crazy, sad character. Her episodes are such a great, gritty depiction of mental illness. I'm always amazed with how this show manages to be both fall out of your seat funny and completely heartbreaking... sometimes at the same time.

As with the first season, the ensemble cast is extraordinary, led by William H Macy and Emmy Rossum (where is the awards show love for these two? Especially Rossum!). Joan Cusack continues to steal every single scene she's in, and has a few really, really funny ones towards the middle of the season. And finally, the kids manage to be totally unaffected and charming. You really feel like you're a part of this crazy, dysfunctional family -- for better or worse!

In short, if you haven't seen this series, go buy the first season on DVD and get this one as soon as it's released. You will be completely addicted.",1335484800,44,1597,4.754512635379061

Really captures the love and family bond of the Gallagher family (and friends) even through being weird as well (stay weird people!)  Started watching it because of one actor I enjoy, and then got totally hooked, since I don't have Showtime, the DVD sets are a great option (with lots of good behind the scenes info)",1496188800,,394,4.444444444444445

4916485,5,B0060MYJRC,"If you were ""game"" for Season 1, then you will certainly enjoy Season 2.  If not....then,  I'm not sure why you bothered to continue w/the series.  This is the most irreverent, uncouth show that I've ever seen in my life.  It also happens to be the single funniest show I've ever seen too!  Very few movies or TV shows can make me roll over laughing, but this is one of them!!

A welcome addition to the cast in season 2 is Zach McGowan.  He plays a Zany buffed-up Biff who comes into the orbit of the Gallaghers.  Zach certainly shows off his diverse range as he can go from portraying a scary pirate (Captain Vane) in&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Black-Sails-Complete-First-Season-1-Black-Sails-Complete-Season-3-DVD-Bundle-Series-2-Pack/dp/B01MQUCF39/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Black Sails Complete First Season 1 & Black Sails Complete Season 3 DVD Bundle Series 2 Pack</a>&nbsp;to playing a goofy biker in the current show.  From everything I have heard, Zach is beloved in real life by his fellow Thespians, so he not only has talent but moxie & personality.  That's great to know!!

The rest of the usual suspects are back.  Fiona (Emmy Rossom) tries to hold her family together despite the biggest dead beat dad ever (played by William H. Macy).  Laura Slade Wiggins returns as Karen, the insatiable siren who draws men to their doom.  Oh, and did I mention that Laura also happens to be the absolute most beautiful young woman I have ever seen?  Just wanted to make sure!!

So, SHAMELESS fans, if you're ready for more, here ya go.  As for me, I'm ready to move on to Season 3!!",1491523200,,1633,5.125

It's odd in the sense that Seinfeld was in its time and takes a bit of getting used to as its not typical by any means.

4917013,5,B0060MYJRC,"Let me start off by stating that I'm one of those annoyingly self-righteous people who dismiss almost all serialized shows as overrated drivel, and will give a series two episodes before giving up. This series has blown me away with the quality of acting, casting, unpredictability and writing. I've been a Wm H Macy fan since the beginning of his film career and he was the only reason for checking out the series... wow, I'm so glad I did.

Each character is brilliantly defined; shaking off the cliches so easy to fall back on: Poor white trash family with kids in constant trouble and absentee/drunk/user parents. That's an easy plot that almost writes itself for crappy network television, but the storylines defy triteness and the intelligence shown through each character's story arc, especially when they have to rely on each other in a truly familial during crisis feels inspiring and honest. Especially when things don't end well.

I'd usually downgrade a show with so much gratuitous language, sex, nudity and violence, but this is the exception and the vulgarity really polishes rough edges or maybe keeps it from seeming too one-dimensional. The balance of tragedy to comedy is near perfect and I'm finding myself thinking of characters days after watching. A series done extremely well and it gives me hope for the future of TV serials.",1464566400,5,1350,4.969026548672566

4917593,4,B0060MYJRC,"At the time of this writing this dvd is about $20. The newest season (4) is currently about $28, I believe, so obviously the price drops a little as time goes by. This season of ""Shameless"" is definitely funny and irreverent. As another reviewer pointed out (and I agree) there seems to be more graphic sex and nudity than in the first season and I find this annoying and unnecessary. It's like do they think we need to see other people humping like rabbits in order to be entertained? I don't mind sex in a tv show but does it have to border on watching a porn flick? But whatever... Not much really changes this season. The Gallager family is still as dysfunctional as ever. I've noticed others say this show is groundbreaking and is like no other tv show before it but that is not really true in my opinion. I had described season one as a cross between ""Party Of Five"" and ""Married With Children"" but this season I'm starting to see hints of other shows that have previously touched upon themes such as addiction and poverty and scoffed in their faces. Canada's own ""Trailer Park Boys"" took a humorous look like 12 years ago at people who hold their drug habits dear. And the show ""Titus"" definitely mocked addiction and alcoholism 15 years ago. The concept of preferring the alcoholic father drunk to sober was covered years ago in Christopher Titus' household when his family had an intervention to get their dad to START drinking again. So ""Shameless"" is not necessarily covering anything new here but that doesn't mean it isn't funny. I still love this show. Unfortunately, I do think the writers crossed the line when they had Frank lie to the organ donor people to keep a woman from getting a heart transplant just so he could have a shot at getting her pension. That's going beyond the limits of good taste and was low even for Frank Gallager. I also don't like seeing cruelty to animals on any show even if it is fiction since I think it could give children ideas but hopefully no young kids are watching this show. All that being said, I still enjoy this show and find it hilarious. I think if people don't mind some very dark humor and some irreverent content then this show is a keeper.",1422316800,2,2201,4.505

4917638,5,B0060MYJRC,"This is a well done series. I admit that it had great potential to be cheesy, with weak pointless humor and simple story lines. I am very surprised that primarily the writing has saved this show. Turns out that it's not too easily predictable as many other shows are. I enjoy not knowing where the next turn will take the viewer. The cast does a believable job with it's acting. It's funny because they act like they don't give a s***. I guess that's a compliment. The only con is the mixing of the music vs the dialogue. I can see that someone in the production staff wants to crank the music during action moments for impacts sake. The person responsible for that needs to turn it down a bit. I'm sick of turning it down at those moments then increasing the volume to hear dialogue. That's not bad if it's my only con.",1419638400,,820,4.3311688311688314

To be certain it is very much R rated at times, and not for any young children or prudish adults but to me I found it hilarious and addictive. Cussing of course and sex- as in in your face suggestion not OMG close your eyes!! :)",1383696000,,538,4.02803738317757

There were times when they went too far such as Monica's suicide attempt at Thanksgiving dinner. Really, as Jimmy/Steve pointed out those kids are already messed up (he used a different word) so why the need to scar their characters even more. I am starting to think some of the writers are working out their own issues through the Gallaghers, overall, I felt this season wasn't as good as the first but not terrible either.

It sounds like an impossible theme to make laughs out of a weirdly functional dysfunctional family, but it works. William H.

I can hardly wait for season 3.",1366329600,2,395,4.424657534246576

Hysterically funny - crazy - populated by characters you've never seen before. Equal opportuntiy insulters. In totally bad taste - that will leave you with an incredulous smile on your face.

4918098,5,B0060MYJRC,"I don't have time to watch regular TV so I have to keep up with the Instant Video version of Shameless on Amazon. I love this show. I have worked with alcoholics,addicts,their families and the system for over 40 years. I have actually witnessed, or at least heard about, someone who has lived every story line that I have seen so far. The writers, using just the right touch of fiction mixed with real life, have captured the true essence of what happens in these situations every day. It is shameless but very true. And I can't say enough about the cast. Everyone of these guys and gals play their roll so well that I forget that they are acting. I only watch three ongoing TV shows each week. Shameless is at the top of my list. I give everybody who is involved in the production of this show an A+. Shameless is truly shameless. But if you watch it, just one time, I promise you will become addicted to it.",1362355200,,909,4.321637426900585

The acting is out-of-this-world good. True emotion, flawless dialogue, great directing. It's the gritty whole-grain sibling to white-bread Weeds (which I also love). I didn't see the first series of Shameless, but I didn't have any trouble starting with Season 2, thanks to the recap before each episode. I highly recommend it, but not for anyone under 18.

Please don't get rid of ""Jimmy"", Fiona,Veronica,Kev. They are a great asset to the show. Although in U.K. you took them out, me being disappointed, it actually still worked.

Some how you must have the Mcguires Move into the apartment next to them or incorporate them some how to be family next door. I'm only on season 5 on U.L. but really enjoy the chaos brought by them. But everything in the U.S, version is awesome although ""Jimmy's"" forehead does bother me a bit. But all the changes to Shameless compared to U.KL. is great",1360368000,,754,4.385714285714286

Seriously, this series will never be for everyone.  I'm never gonna say, ""Hey grandma, come over and lets watch Shameless.""  I worry that in showing the gritty truth of these people, they will somehow glorify them.  No one wants their kid to grow up and be a Gallagher  (except maybe Emmy Rossum's Fiona, has there ever been a better film depiction of youth being derailed by responsibility?)  Yet despite it all, I like these people, and I wish for them (in the last, final episode someday) a redemption that God or scriptwriters seldom give.",1360108800,,804,4.566433566433567

As someone who started out watching the british version first, I can honestly say that I love the American version just as much, and sometimes more. I think it may because I am an American and grew up in a similar situation in the American ghetto. It is so well written and directed. The Actors chosen are perfect and I can't think of any better choices. Every character is portraid amazingly. I would recommend this show to anyone who's okay with constant swearing and constant nudity and sex. The show has plenty of that, but it's what gives it the realness aspect which makes it feel alive.

They exist, but to act it and make it believeable is another thing.  William Macy, I have seen many of his movies and to be able to have his character in this series make me forget his other roles is the sign of a very, very talented man. They don't give Oscars for TV show actors, but he deserves one.  He nails it, I have a friend who I went to school with and now at 59 years old could be Franks twin.  Not sure if the writers of this show may have met my friend.  Macy plays it to perfection. The series is excellent, the acting very believable and I am always saying, ""I know poeple who act like that"".  Buy it, and enjoy, this one is a winner.",1358380800,,776,4.174496644295302

The second season seems to have a more hopeful air to it than the first and the ending is on a more positive note.  I wish they showed the characters Veronica and Kevin more but it still is quite entertaining.  As one reviewer already noted, this series is not for the faint of heart and shows male/female nudity, not a good choice for a purist.  The reason why I gave this season a 4 star rating is because of the character ""Mandy"" and the fact Jane Levy is no longer participating in the show.  Levy had the perfect look, appearing as an average teenager (so to speak)and the correct amount of sex appeal.  But Emma Greenwell is off the make for the needed attributes of Mandy.  She looks much older than 16/17 and is model pretty, lacking the gritty, street hardened beauty Levy brought to the table.  Greenwell is a good actor in her own right but she should of been brought on as another character instead of a replacement.  It seems Jane has a budding career and may not of wanted to return but it is true stupidity if the decision was made by the studio execs.  If so, they really are not paying attention to the expanding world of the Gallagher's.

Sorry this is so long but it's that good and I'm passionate about telling everyone I know to watch it!! I passed my blue ray copy to everyone. If u r reading this I would give it to u too! Lol!! Here is the story of how I got into "" shameless"".
 My finance started watching it and I wasn't interested in it at all! I was messing around on my iPhone trying not to pay attention to it and catching bits and pieces of it and was laughing my you know what off. To make a long story short I had to buy the first season on blue ray because I am stubborn ( like most men ) and was sticking to my guns that I wasn't interested in watching what I thought at the time was a stupid show. So when I gave in,  the show wasn't on showtime on demand anymore. So being a stubborn a hole ,it cost me $45.00 dollars but well worth every penny and I get to keep it for ever. If I ever get it back from my sister. She's like me and passes it to everyone she knows. My blue ray copy went ""viral"" lol. Also if you have kids, make sure they are in bed because there is a lot of nudity and sex. Clear your schedule because once i started i couldn't stop till I i ran out of shows in the second season. I hope you read to this point so I can say thanks for reading my story. Lol. I hope this helps you make your decision! I love it!!!!!!!
  Thank you Marc",1354233600,,1601,3.901840490797546

PG'rs, my spouce won't admit he likes it and can't fathom this kind of dysfuntion exists.  Will have to check
out the English version.",1353974400,,240,4.173913043478261
4918227,5,B0060MYJRC,"This is a great show, funny, has a lot of, LOL, and ""wow really?"" factors. Almost as good as the BBC version, But Macy makes this one.",1353801600,,134,4.0
4918248,5,B0060MYJRC,"This is a terrific series. I grew up with a couple alcoholic parents that delved into some mild drugging and I see a great deal of my childhood as well as my own adult life in so much of Shameless. I'm not saying my family's lives were as hilariously funny as Frank's whole crew but I'm sure they could get some good material from me. I'd feared this series would be taken as too farsical and dispensed with after the first season. Usually when I like a series really well it disappears. William Macy has done a terrific job of depicting a deplorable, filthy, alcoholic with absolutely no morals. My hat is off to the rest of the cast. It is impressive the child actors can bring across such convincing roles portraying the lives of a dysfunctional family so well.",1353628800,16,764,4.464285714285714
4918249,5,B0060MYJRC,I love this show. All the characters are great. Hope the seasons continue. I have recommended it to others who like it too.,1353369600,,123,4.391304347826087
4918250,5,B0060MYJRC,"There is a great moment in Shameless (SEASON 2) in which Fiona finds herself on the run from the wife of the guy she just shagged. Ducking for cover, she hides underneath Sheila's (the AMAZING Joan Cusack) table.  Laughing to himself, Frank hides with her and the two share a father/daughter moment. At this point I (ALREDY A BIG FAN OF THE SERIES) was hooked. The second season of the funniest show on TV just gets better as we see the Gallaghers through tough situation after tough situation. Never has a show been written to such lengths of honesty. Shameless Season 2 just gets better. If you LOVED season 1, then you'll love season 2.
