It is the first 3D movie that I have watched that really makes it worth while using this technology. Wim Wenders makes it such a tangible visual experience, you think you are sitting on the stage or in the middle of each random dance floor (trains, coal mines, riversides, roadsides, crop land after harvest...)
Bausch's creative choreography makes classical ballet look rather ridiculous. I watched the film in a well packed Boston cinema afternoon show. The audience applauded the film, which is not a usual experience.",1329955200,3,702,5.166666666666667
4491568,5,B004X1STT6,"""Pina"" (106 min.) is a thrilling documentary about/celebration of choreographer Pina Bausch's work. It is important to note that Bausch herself was involved in the preparations of this movie, but she passed away just before shooting beagan after a short but devastating bout with cancer. Director Wim Wenders halted the production, but the dancers of the Wuppertal Tanztheatre convinced him to carry on and to make the movie as a tribute to Bausch. And that it certainly is.

The movie showcases 4 major pieces by Bausch, starting with The Rite of Spring, in which the dancers perform on a thick layer of dark sand. The other pieces are Cafe Mueller, Kontakthoff, and Vollmond. The latter is truly remarkable: there is a huge rock on the stage, and a continuous waterfall onto the stage, which eventually gets flooded for the most part. The dancers splish and splash their way to, through and onto it and it is an incredible visual experience. A number of scenes are also filmed in and around Wuppertal, including on the Wuppertal Schwebebahn (the ""hanging monorail"") as well as a number of industrial sites that are visually very powerful. The documentary includes short interviews with various company dancers on how Pina influenced them. Sadly, the are only snippets of old footage of Pina Bausch herself.

I saw this in the theatre in 3D and while the 3D was good, I will say that the 3D aspect is not essential to appreciate this movie for what it is: a love note to modern ballet and to Pina Bausch. If you have any interest in ballet, you truly do not want to miss out on this movie. ""Pina"" was nominated for an Oscar for best documentary, and it is easy to see why. Highly, highly recommended!",1329609600,48,1701,4.723905723905724

""Pina"" joins ""Avatar"" and ""The Creature from the Black Lagoon"" on the (very) short list of 3-D movies that really need to be seen in 3-D. That the dances are so magnificent makes this a must see for anyone with even a vague interest in dance.

 PINA (2011) WIN Winders:

 The great people transmuted simple action into art. Who said that Midas was a man? Wasn't she Phillipa ""Pina"" Bausch?
  I invite you to see this film, a poem in motion, and if you're like me, that when you get excited, you cry, take enough tissue napkins, or clean socks, adsorbent gloves, all of that because  the scenes of Pina are sublime, and when the epiphany bursts, usually target to the tear glands.
  The choreographic capacity of Pina Bausch was unusual. She agglomerates the dancers, in one being with legs, bodies and arms in perfect synchronicity, sometimes it is a binary being, men and women, spilling emotions though their bodies.  Her love of painting, leads to choreographic design like canvas, with brushstrokes perfectly designed, and time to rehearsal, which use to create elements of surprise, with shades of wonder and uncertainty.
Pina passed away five days after being diagnosed with cancer at age 68, Win Winders, the director of this film in 3D, was about to stop all the production. But Pina`s companions, dancers, and family, at least his son Solomon, and the people who admired her  ""Tanstheater Wuppertal Pina Bausch"" fans', asked for to keep the project on, that did not stop the work of this dream-maker film director Win Winders. The result of adding two geniuses in one film, this two wonderful human beings that were born around Dresden, in East Germany, is a masterpiece of art, with the only cualification of superlatively emotional.
  From the time I saw the movie ""Nosthalgia"" of my admired Andrei Tarkovsky, I had not felt so excited and ecstatic, for a film of any genre, until now. This movie produces inside me a sense of epiphany. Because it is full of synthetic visions of the contemporary world, that of course is not new.
  Dancers participating in the documentary - although hard to circumscribe this film only in a work of this genre -. Describes Pina Bausch in their words, sad and excited, they felt already nostalgia for her.  I got the impression that those professionals dancers, they were depicted a kind of goddess of body movement, sets and themes linked to superb choreography poems, which implies an amazing level of cognitive complexity.
  Their scenarios were unusual, for example in ""Vollmond"", the performance was develop on brown earth, in there a group of women have a horror and attraction as well, for a red nightie, while the men leader claims, that to be part of the dowry of the woman who will choose.
  In another work of Pina: ""Caf Mller"", that she used to be part of, Pina dance with her eyes closed, while a man is removing the tables and chairs. Pina tell us, in an off narration, that this scene, when she opened his eyes at the end of the work, she was transformed.
  The choreographer also participated as an actress with film director Federico Fellini in his movie ""And the Ship Sails?"" As the Princess Lherimia.
  Pina Bausch received several awards throughout her career, such as the ""Laurence Oliver"" in Britain, in the prize ""Kyoto"" in Japan and the Goethe Prize in Frankfurt Germany
 This year the film on Pina, is already nominated for several awards, and at least four of his works will be on stage in celebration of the ""Olympics"" in London, 2012.
  The use of basic elements, women and old men, the dynamic law of gravity, as the antagonistic natural element of the flying dancers, abundant water, earth, wind and sun. In addition to the narrative themes that humans have told us from the caves to the mobile chat and what follows, are a proof that Pina was a woman that knew to tune the limbic system of human emotions and read into her dancers and know what kind of personal stories they have and what kind of goals they would like to achieve.
  Win Winders, developed an unconventional documentary, without concessions or sentimentalisms. His intention is to make us partakers of the wonderful woman who Pina Busch was, and perhaps with that improve, even slightly, the pain of his departure.
  Winders is the director of ""The American Friend"", ""Paris Texas"", ""Wings of Desire,"" ""The End of the Violence"" also the documentary about the Cuban orchestra of olds musicians,  ""Buena Vista Social Club"". He was born in Dresden, close to town where Pina was born, studied medicine and philosophy, but he did not completed them.  He try entering several times to formally study film, however like Franois Truffaut in France, it was by being a regular assistant to films and work on the drafting of Der Spiegel, that generated the basic knowledge that allow him to make his films.
 Installed more from the position of an emotional and observational cinema, his films are about unusual situations of estrange people. In the film, ""Paris, Texas"", for instance, Harry Dean Stanton plays Travis Henderson, a subject in a state of dromomania (less intense than the one that we saw in Forest Gump, because he runs tirelessly for moths and grown beards and hair). Travis enters from the desert to a small restaurant and drink what is in the refrigerator. To learn that after the pain of neglect, indifference, or what Wajda called ""No Anesthesia"" Bez znieczulenia (1978), which caused such locomotors activity.
  Winders, like his compatriot Herzog (The Cave of forgotten dreams), ventures under a lucky star in the technology of the third dimension, and strings sublime touches, for example, when at the end of ""Pina"" he made a tribute, I think consciously  to Ettore Scola and his film ""The Dance"" (Le Bal) (1983), in which Scola narrated, through popular dance, twenty years of life in France in XX century. At the end of each French historical period, a photographer invisible takes a snapshot. In the Win Winders movie, Pina, the photographer is not invisible, as it takes pictures of the dancing couples, that letter on comments on Pina Bausch.
Human beings are not just what we see in the mirror, but how we perceive each time that we move, and each time we see the same the same dynamics in the others. That is why this movie is an special one for those who see the synthesis of arts inside a screen.",1328313600,8,6151,4.801707779886148

4491572,5,B004X1STT6,"Philippina ""Pina"" Bausch [1](27 July 1940 - 30 June 2009) was a German performer of modern dance, choreographer, dance teacher and ballet director. With her unique style, a blend of movements, sounds and prominent stage sets, and with her elaborate cooperation with performers during the composition of a piece (a style now known as Tanztheater), she became a leading influence since the 1970s in the world of modern dance",1325635200,2,422,5.130434782608695

Teatru okre'lajacego kierunek wsplczesnego tanca baletowego a prowadzonego przez niemieck' tancerk', choreografa i jednocze'nie dyrektora baletu, Pin' Bausch. Nast'pnego dnia bed'c zauroczony magi' i sil' przekazu tego artystycznego medium osobi'cie poznal slynn' tancerk', i wsplnie podj'li oni wyzwanie nakr'cenia filmu w ktrym Pina mia'a przedstawi' cztery krtkie utwory baletowe.

Nowy film Wendersa -""Pina""- nie tylko iluminuje wspomniane cztery przedstawienia baletowe (oddane w skrcie na potrzeby filmu), ale dodatkowo wplata pomi'dzy cz'sci tych utworw esencjalne wspomnienia tancerzy dotycz'ce ich bylej szefowej. Wenders zaskakuje nas (i pono' samych tancerzy) niespotykanymi plenerami w ktrych filmowane byly te s'owne lub ruchowe reminescencje. Film zyskuje zupelnie nowego wymiaru poprzez u'ycie techniki 3D, gdy' dodaje ""tchnienia przestrzeni"" - elemententu ktrego re'yser szuka' przez dwadzie'cia lat.

4491586,5,B004X1STT6,"German director Wim Wenders is an experienced director who of late, seems focused on documentaries.  Many are music or art related (Willie Nelson at the Teatro, Buena Vista Social Club, U2: The Best of 1990-2000).  In this film he worked with his long-time friend and dance icon, Pina Bausch in what was to be a retrospective of her career and teaching.  She died unexpectedly, a result of an aggressive form of lung cancer, just 2 days before shooting was to begin.  So the film becomes more of a eulogy, yet Wenders somehow manages to keep the performances staid and quite beautiful.  It would have been easy to fall into a maudlin tone.

Wenders decided to use 3-D technology in filming.  According to writer, Siri Hustvedt, (it creates) the illusion of depth, the sense that the spectator can fall or walk into the space in front of her, that she can enter it naturally, and that the bodies she sees exist in a shared space.  Ill just say that it is one of the most impressive uses of the medium that I can recall.  Another unique dimension to the film are the interviews with the various dancers, some of whom danced with Pina for decades.  They come from many countries and in most cases speak in their native language (English subtitles are available and float in 3-D), but their comments are recorded and played back while the interviewee adds the emotion of his or her language with facial expressions.  Its unusual and very effective.

Most of the film is dance, however, including some archival footage of Ms. Bausch.  The film includes Stravinskys The Rite of Spring and Caf Muller.  Film aficionados may recognize the later featured in Talk to Her, Pedro Almodovars Oscar winning film.  Other pieces include Vollmond (Full Moon) and ""Kontakthof (contact zone).""  Dancers young and old are seen in various segments, all trim and fit.  Most of the dances are performed by the men and women from Tanztheater Wuppertal Pina Bausch at that theater.  In addition several are performed outside, some in traffic.  Very cool.

I know little about modern dance, but you don't have to in order to appreciate the artistry of the dancers, the choreographer and the documentarian.  Highly recommended.

This great package from Criterion includes a 3-D Blu ray disc and a 2-D Blu ray disc.  A real bonus is that the special features are in both dimensions.  The film has a 1080p video resolution with a 1.85:1 aspect ratio.  As noted earlier, Wenders Oscar nominated film should be seen in 3-D to get the full effect of what he was going for.  The look is truly impressive.  Colors are great, especially the exterior shots.  Good black levels and wonderful clarity overall.  I took a quick peek at the 2-D version and found that it looked great as well, but obviously lacked the overall depth of 3-D.  The audio is mostly German DTS-HD Master Audio 5.1.  The music is provided by Thom (Thom Hanreich) and it is well placed throughout the film.  The surrounds get a decent workout, and what little dialog there is, it is well placed and easily heard.  The extras are worth noting.  They include the original trailer, a 46 minute making of piece, 14!! deleted dance scenes, some behind the scenes footage, a 23 minute interview with Wenders (in English), his commentary track and an illustrated booklet featuring an essay by Hustvedt and writings from Wenders and Pina Bausch.",1467504000,2,3372,4.77681660899654

I'm not really into dance, but I found this movie fascinating.  Dances were staged in theater spaces as well as in interesting locations in and around the company's hometown of Wuppertal.  The fact that the movie is stereoscopic (i.e. 3D) captures so much more in the locations and in the dancer's interactions - it's really a brilliant application of 3D imaging.  The movie rendered beautifully on our 47"" 3DTV.  If you have a bigger one, it will be even better.

The stereoscopic effect is very well done, with few apparent technical flaws.  Flaws that I could detect are minor and hardly detract from the overall experience (for example, the production apparently used a beamsplitter rig without a quarter wave retarder mirror for compensation of polarization effects, so some scenes were troubled with rivalrous imaging on reflective surfaces).  I think I saw one short shot in an overhead tram that was pseudoscopic, and there might have been a few shots with poor horizontal alignment.

I just recently purchased a Sony 47"" Bravia LED 3D TV and, although I pretty much had made up my mind that I was not interested in watching anything in 3D, I REALLY wanted to watch ""Pina"" in 3D again.  I had seen it on the big screen at a film festival and was blown away by it!  I've always been a fan of Pina Bausch's art and genius, so the opportunity to see a documentary on her, and in 3D no less, was incredible!  It was such a revelation seeing dance filmed in 3D.  It's the best use of the 3D technology I've ever seen.  It really puts you right in there with the dancers.  I LOVED the film!  After reading all the positive reviews about the 3D blu-ray disc, I decided to take the plunge.  Happily, not only do I now appreciate my TV more, I like that it's a 3D model!  Okay, so you know that I love the 3D blu-ray discnow about the film itself.

Wim Wenders has created a loving, inspiring, and well-crafted tribute to Pina Bausch.  She truly deserves it!  And what makes the documentary even more enjoyable are the remembrances of Pina shared by her dancers.  Each has interesting anecdotes about working with Pina, and each have such incredible faces!  Pina's dancers do not look like what most dancers look like.  They have very real faces.  They are wonderful actors as well as being mesmerizing dancers.  And I like that they come from so many different ethnicities.

The short segments of Pina's remarkable dance pieces makes you wish you could see the whole performance.  Another plus are the special features.  There's a ""making of"" that's very cleverly done, and is a great companion piece to the film.  The commentary with Wenders is great also.  So, yeah, this one definitely gets five-stars from me.  I've watched parts of it several times now. and I know that I""ll keep doing so for quite awhile.  And it's in 3D!!!

Maybe it's a violation of one's inner self, whether it's love, death, betrayal, despair, or the darkest secret that one would've  rather suppressed to itself, it forces you to look into the dance, the choreography, but you're really looking back into yourself with the rest of the audience, or the world.

4491710,5,B004X1STT6,"""Dance, Dance, otherwise we are lost""

Pina Bausch, a German performer best known for her pioneering work on modern dance as a choreographer, teacher and a ballet director.

A unique style that was bold, creative and different, so much that traditional dance critics had a hard time understanding her unique style back in the '70s.  But it's a style that people would soon regard as magnificent due to her blend of movements and prominent stage sets and her cooperation with performers during the composition of a piece (a style known as Tanztheater),

For renown filmmaker Wim Wenders known for films such as ""Wings of Desire"", ""Paris, Texas"", ""Until the End of the World"", ""The American Friend"" and many more, his interest in Pina Bausch began in 1985 when he was dragged to a production by his friend Solveig Dommartin.  Having no interest in dance at the time, it was when he began to watch, he was so moved that he wept.

Since then, he had co-authored a book with Donata Wenders titled ""Pina: The Film and the Dancers"", but for 20-years, he had wanted to make a documentary about Pina but at the time, there was no way to capture the dancing performance on camera, to make the audience feel anywhere close to how others feel when they watched a Pina Bausch production live.

Fast forward to 2008 and when Wim Wenders watched 3D technology used in U2s concert, he realized that he can now take on the film using modern digital 3D technology to give the illusion of depth.

And so, Wim Wenders and Pina Bausch set out to create the documentary.  Unfortunately in 2009, Pina Bausch was diagnosed with cancer at the age of 68 and five days after diagnosis, she had past away, two days before the shooting of the documentary.

But with the members of the Tanztheater Wuppertal Pina Bausch troupe encouraging Wenders to continue the documentary as a memorial for Pina Bausch, two years later, ""pina"" would premiere at the 61st Berlin International Film Festival.  It would receive critical acclaim worldwide and also nominated for an Academy award for ""Best Documentary Feature"".

And now, ""pina"" will be released on Blu-ray 3D + Blu-ray combo and on DVD courtesy of The Criterion Collection in January 2013.

""pina"" will feature excerpts from performances of ""Cafe Muller"", ""Le sacre du printemps"", ""Knotakthof"" and ""Vollmond"" from the members of the Tanztheater Wuppertal Pina Bausch troupe including interstitial scenes with the dancers who give their stories about Pina in their native language (with English subtitles) and also archived footage of Pena.

Mesmerizing, beautiful and complex, we are taken on an adventure to an artistic world of Pina Bausch and learning how this woman, strict but a wonderful teacher, believed in her dancers to create magic and most importantly as Bausch had told one of her dancers, to have them ""dance for love"".

VIDEO:

For ""pina"", the film was a laborious and challenging film for Wim Wenders and crew to take on and make sure everything looked right in 3D and the finally for the 2D version.

It's important to note that to view the 3D version of the film, you must have a 3D Blu-ray enabled player and television.  And what is most amazing about the 3D presentation of ""pina"" is its depth.  This is one aspect of the film that the crew wanted to make sure they got it right and they did.  The feeling of depth and trying to capture how one would see things in a theater performance.  Bare in mind that it's not 100% exact in trying to capture that experience but the choice to shoot in 3D was the best choice because the film was able to accomplish depth using today's 3D technology with complete efficacy.

Watching it in 2D, the film also looks amazing in colors and detail.  From the opening dance with the red dress which looks vibrant to the many outdoor and indoor scenes, this is a film that looks visually impressive and there are no problems with this Blu-ray whatsoever.  It's fantastic!

According to the Criterion Collection, ""pina"" was shot in three shooting blocks, on three different camera systems: the Sony HDC-1500 in October 2009, the Sony HDC-P1 in April 2010 and the Sony EX3 in June 2010, using Zeiss DigiPrime lenses of 7 mm, 10 mm, 14 mm and 20 mm.  The on-set recording was done on a Sony SRW-1, on HDcam SR tapes and a Codex Server.

The film was shot in high definition (1920 x 1080), and the final theatrical aspect ratio was 1:85:1 (1920 x 1038).  To achieve the image size required by the Digital Cinema Initiative's (DCI) specifications (1998 x 1080), black bars were added to the left and right of the image in the 3D and 2D Digital Cinema Packages (DCPs).  These bars were considered preferable to a zoom-in, as the latter would have decreased the sharpness of the image.  The bars were removed for the Blu-ray and DVD editions and replaced by black bars at the top and bottom of the screen, to maintain the original aspect ratio.  On standard 4:3 televisions, this image will be letterboxed.

The post-production was done in a DPX-based digital workflow.  The theatrical color timing was done on Resolve 5, and the visual effects and retouching on Flame 2009.  The heart of the postproduction was a Mistika 5 station, where the onlining, conforming, stereoscopic sweetening, depth grading, reframing and 3D subtitling were done.

The visual accuracy of Pina's subtitles is unique.  Typically, subtitles in a 3D movie are set at a screen level.  For Pina, every subtitle was individually and manually placed on the depth axis.  Some subtitles were even animated to allow for the most comfortable and natural 3D perception.

The final DCP sequence was printed on 35 mm Kodak Negative 2383 stock using an ArriLaswer.  The DPX files were then timed in the Rec. 709 high-definition color space for recording on HDCam SR tape for broadcast and Blu-ray and DVD release.

The 2D version of the 3D film was created as the best-eye version, using a careful selection of shots from either the left or the right eye.

AUDIO & SUBTITLES:

""pina - The Criterion Collection #644 is presented in lossless DTS-HD Master Audio 5.1 soundtrack.  Because Pina Bausch's dancers are from various countries, the languages presented are in German, English, Russian, French, Italian, Slovene, Spanish, Portuguese and Korean with English subtitles.  Dialogue is crystal clear as with the music by composer Thom (""Land of Plenty"", ""Palermo Shooting"").

According to the Criterion Collection, the 5.1 soundtrack presented on this release is identical to the theatrical mix.

JUDGMENT CALL:

I have reviewed a good number of dance films on Blu-ray but the Criterion Collection release of ""pina"" is the most impressive that I have ever watched.

This is a film that must be experienced visually, one should not even dare to try explain it because Pina Bausch's choreography, the dances that are featured in this wonderful documentary is just a visual feast that will no doubt impress you.  Even for the naysayers who may not be interested in modern dance, watching this film may give them the opportunity to see something that they have never have seen before and enjoy it.

I'm am very grateful to director Wim Wenders for pursuing in the making of this documentary as it is a perfect memorial for the late Pina Bausch.  But also for utilizing 3D for a dance film and show what can be accomplished with today's 3D technology and putting it to great use.

Also, for those who don't own a 3D-enabled Blu-ray player or television, you can still enjoy the 2D version.  While you won't have the illusion of depth, it's still a film that can be enjoyed visually.

Beautifully shot!  A wonderful tribute by filmmaker Wim Wenders to the German modern-dance pioneer, Pina Bausch.  This is possibly one of the most unique films that is featured in the Criterion Collection and it was definitely a wonderful experience!

Wim Wenders ""Pina"" and this Criterion Collection release is deserving of five stars! Highly recommended!",1364601600,,9018,4.8874259381171825
4491711,5,B004X1STT6,"Pina - a film by Wim Wenders

WOW!!  First, let me say I am not a modern dance aficionado, but after viewing this film (twice already, and in 3D to boot!), I feel a whole new appreciation for modern dance, and especially the works of Pina Bausch and her amazing dance company!

This particular film by Wim Wenders blew me away!  It was beautiful, often heartbreakingly so, and occasionally even funny and whimsical.  Not only has Wim Wenders captured the beauty of modern dance through the medium of film, but he has hugely enhanced the experience by successfully and beautifully filming it in 3D!

I didn't really get into the dances portrayed in the film immediately, but after a half hour or so, I was hooked, and had to keep watching to the end.  I decided to view it a second time with the director's commentary...and that really cinched the film for me.  Wim Wenders does an excellent job with his rather soft, even somewhat monotone voice, heavy with German accent.  He offers insight into most of the dances (extremely helpful for me!) and the development of the film, and via the commentary we learn why the film contains little information about Pina Bausch and only excerpts of Pina's wonderful works.  It just so happens that of the two ""rules"" Pina and Wim agreed to as part of their collaboration, one was that Pina wanted the film to NOT be biographical.  The other was that she wanted never to be interviewed.

The dancers are terrific!  Such beautiful arms and deep expressiveness in each and every dancer, male and female, younger and older alike.  Of the 24 or 25 dancers in her company, most appear to be quite ""seasoned"" (meaning around 50 years old, or perhaps even older!), adding (I believe) a very comforting and satisfying depth to the artistic interpretations.

There are even two brief clips of Pina herself dancing many years earlier, and she is mesmerizing in both short excerpts!

The 3D effect is fabulous, especially in the outdoor scenes!

English subtitles are provided but limited to sections where translation is necessary, and not available when dialogue (of which there is little anyway!) is in English.  The commentary is in English, so no subtitles there.

I viewed the ""making of"" section, accompanied with commentary by Wim Wenders (not subtitled).  It is about 45 minutes long with very helpful insight into the intricacies of filming ""Pina,"" especially in 3D.  I had no idea how very complicated it is to film in 3D!!  Something else wonderful we benefit from by viewing the ""making of"" section is more dance excerpts of Pina's works, many of which are not included in the film.  We also get to see Wim Wenders in action...he appears to be a quiet spoken, patient man, filled with a huge amount of gracious appreciation for the dancers, his film crew, Pina's works, and of course for Pina herself!

The one technical failing in the DVD itself is that to view the deleted scenes (all 14 of which are wonderfully included in 3D, and which you would do yourself a HUGE favor by viewing!!), is that Criterion did NOT make it possible to ""view all.""  Instead, one must cue up each and every one of them individually, PLUS cue up the audio separately for each to hear Wim's optional commentary on  all of them (also a ""must hear"")!!  Doing so means adding a considerable amount of extra time to see and hear each deleted scene, but they are ALL worth viewing regardless!

If you appreciate fine film making, wonderful modern dancing, and the potential to be moved to tears by the dancing and the sheer emotion of the music, treat yourself to this beautiful film.  Wim Wenders and Pina's dance company have presented it as a tribute to Pina, as Pina died before it was completed.",1364428800,7,3717,4.7105263157894735

4491713,5,B004X1STT6,"Before I saw this film, I had heard many different dancers and choreographers talking about Dance Theater Wuppertal and it's resident choreographer Pina Bausch- as if she was almost a legend- and someone very respected for creative work. Now I understand why. I watched this movie with some people who are dancers and with some non-dancers. The non-dancers really thought the movie was interesting and could relate to it, or it gave them something to think about and captured their attention, whereas sometimes 'regular modern dance' is hard to follow for non-dancers. I believe this is because of the elements of humanity Pina was able to emanate through her work. I found it inspiring and thought-provoking, and still think about parts of the movie/am processing it several weeks later.",1363996800,,788,5.116279069767442

4491717,5,B004X1STT6,"It scares me to think that I might have gone though life without knowing about this choreographer, and without having seen this movie, but for the serendipity of hearing an interview on NPR with the director, Wim Wenders.  I am not a dance fanatic of any sort, but sometimes art connects in the way that cannot be ignored, and it happens here.  This tribute to Pina Bausch captures the compact power and connection to the elements  of this German choreographer whose creative use of space is incredible. Wim most effectively portrays Pina's voice, bringing us up close and personal, to dances on the stage, and in the ""real world"" settings from metro stations to quarries. Interspersed with the dances, are mini-interviews with dancers who reveal the effect of this choreographer on her international cast, not with spoken words, but with the lines and expressions on their faces reminding us that dance is a language in itself (their actual words are in captions below them). The dancers' faces and bodies are those of ordinary people doing extraordinary things with incredible introspection as they are challenged by  Pina  to ""Dance, Dance, otherwise [they] are lost.""  The surprises start with the opening number, where the dance is performed on a stage covered thickly in dirt which soon is also attached to the sweat lines of the dancers.  In addition to capturing the art of the dance by this choreographer, the cinematography itself is fantastic in its own right. I could/will watch it again just to see the textures, lines and background motion, Wim uses for the movie.

4491721,4,B004X1STT6,"I bought the Blu-ray 2D/3D combo of Wim Wenders' documentary film ""Pina"". I've only watched the 2D blu-ray disc.

Wenders took Pina Bausch's major pieces such as ""The Rite of Spring"",""Cafe Mueller"", cut the performances into fragments, mixed them with old footages, outdoor shootings and dances' comments. From the film, we have some grasp of Pina's everlasting searching for vocabularies of body movements to express human emotions. Some of her expression reach me and touch me, while some are quite bizarre, but I still admire her for her honesty and sincerity. The flow of the film is a smooth one, the images are stunningly beautiful even on a 2D screen. I felt like looking into a dream, it was beautiful, sometimes defied gravity and logic, but it was always fascinating and captivating. Wender, or Pina, mostly use old recordings as music for the performances. The soundtrack is unmistakably nostalgic.

I have an extra 3D blu-ray disc. Should I rush out to buy a 3D TV just for this? That is not the choice I would make, as long as the 3D version has the same narration.  Wender turned Pina Bausch's work into a sketchbook. One can find masterful strokes in a renaissance master's sketchbook but that is not the art work in the master's mind.  I highly recommend the blu-ray release of Pina Bausch's  ""Orpheus & Eurydice"" that was performed to perfection by the artists at Opra national de Paris. It is on the vehicle of Gluck's wondrous opera that Pina assembled the bits and pieces of her dreamlike choreography into a masterpiece of her own. THAT is Pina's ""Mona Lisa"".",1361664000,,1580,4.81549815498155

4491724,5,B004X1STT6,"Filming dance sequences for the cinema has always created controversy. From the shredding cuts of a film like ""Chicago,"" perhaps hiding the lack of talent of the performers, to the stately long ""held"" shots of Bolshoi ballets which deem them uncinematic to what some consider the perfect framing/editing of Astaire/Rogers films, Wim Wenders brings 3D technology to the performers of Pina Bausch's remarkable oeuvre. While the film can be viewed and enjoyed in 2D, it's just short of revolutionary to see these dance clips in 3D.

The sometimes wicked, often austere and harsh choreography of Pina Bausch, is illuminated by her stable of regular performers, and, yes, this may not be to everyone's taste. But to see some of the greatest contemporary dance sequences in 3D format is unprecedented. Wenders skips the facts of Bausch's life in this ""bio"" film, and instead celebrates her through her company of extraordinary dancers performing. I understand that Bausch early on consulted on the film, but her death attenuated the collaboration. There is a brief sequence of testimony from the dancers themselves of Bausch's import, but otherwise, it's the joy of dance that is framed here.

[Amending this review] The 3D disc did not play in my NTSC Samsung 3D player. This is a first for all the 3D films I've purchased. Reading online, I see that others had difficulty playing the 3D disc, and the buyer isn't alerted to this problem. I didn't return the item since the Blu-ray transfer that comes along with the 3D is exceptional. I do hope that in the future a 3D version that works is available.",1360713600,,1597,4.933085501858736
4491725,5,B004X1STT6,"Last year I bought a 3D version of this film because I'd just watched Werner Herzog's ""Cave of Forgotten Dreams"", absolutely loved it and the write ups for this one looked great. It was, and still is one of the few 3D films designed for adult audiences. Unfortunately, I couldn't watch it on anything I own and was really bummed about it, especially since it was very expensive for a DVD.
Recently I saw it in 2D and within a quick 10 minutes, hit pause and looked on here. Lo and behold, a US 3D version is now available! (This IS a BluRay disk that plays on American machines...double check and make sure you're getting this one)
  I've never been a big dance fan, but this film has put an end to that. In 2D it is an absorbing and beautiful work of art well worth watching several times. The soundtrack is spectacular (which I bought as well), the cinematography stunning and the performances mind bendingly direct, complex and awe-inspiring.
I just finished watching it in 3D. Take what I just wrote, quadruple the experience and then some. It changes everything about the film. If you are familiar with and are a fan of the work of Pina Bausch, then you already know that this gem is a ""must have"" whether in 2D or 3D. I'm not kidding, it is almost worth going out and buying a 3D TV just for this film alone (but if you do, get one that you can use the REAL D glasses with and not the shutter type that need batteries and whatever...I LOVE my LG and it wasn't any more expensive than regular HDTVs).
  I don't know enough about modern dance to say that Pina Bausch is a genius, but in my opinion, as a visual thinker, she is right up there with the greatest painters of our time. Her passion for life, movement through space and time and sound is evocative, sublime and pure in every respect of the word. There is nothing phoney or pretentious going on at all here.
  Her dance company is phenomenal to say the least and like the best athletes and artists, they make it all look effortless. Again, not being well versed in dance, it sure looked like she knew how to find the most talented dancers from around the world and in their own words, knew how to bring out the best in each of them. I found myself moved to tears several times throughout this film just for its shear sense of joy, wonderment and at times, sadness. This is one of those works I am so glad I bought because I know that I'm going to be watching it over and over again. So far, like any great art it has only gotten better. It will be a must see for all of my friends and students alike.
  In a strange sense of irony, Pina passed away two days before the filming of this project began. Our loss of this magical woman is tragic to say the least, especially when wondering what incredible places she could have taken us from here. She most definately left this world a better place than it was when she came into it because of her gifts to us all.

The 3D transfer is stunning, I have a number of other 3D releases, but this is one of the best I have seen.  I also saw this in the theater and I almost feel I get the 3D effect better from a home theater system than what I saw in the theater.

In addition to the film, there is a 45 Making of Pina documentary, for once available in 3D also. There are some deleted segments of dances that are not in the film that run I believe about 30 minutes that you will want to see if you were a fan of the film or Bausch's work.  They are also included as 3D and regular versions.

Another supplement is a promotional interview by Wim Wenders, which is 22 minutes long.  If you want background of the making of this film, it is a good look into his mindset and motivations for what he put on screen.

4491732,2,B004X1STT6,"i don't understand the rave for this movie. 95% on rotten tomatoes? give me a break!

i have seen pina bausch's productions many times - mostly in wuppertal - and loved each and every one of them! the movie, however, does not even come close.
i was assuming that we would be able to get an overview of her various works - instead it is limited to only very few original productions and i am left wondering why wim wenders limited himself - and her - in such a way. very sad.

the electricity of the original work is definitely lost in wenders' translation - instead the cast is given ample room for their 'insights' into their relationships with her.
calling this movie ""pina"" is a misnomer. this is not about her; it is about her grieving cast.

----

""pina"", take 2:

i would like to clarify that i would have liked to have given ""pina"" 2.5 stars - which, of course, is not possible. many of the visuals deserve a higher rating - however, the issues i am having are with its content.

in short: the production value of ""pina"" is certainly outstanding and the 3D version a feast for your eyes - but the content of the movie does not do pina bausch nor her work much justice.
instead, where the late choreographer was a lifelong 'miner' of truth and raw emotions, wenders remains on the surface seemingly unable to fathom the depth of ""pina"".

in order to understand where the movie falls short, one has to know her work - and ideally, the performances have to be seen in their entirety. obviously, this is not possible and, out of many, wenders draws from 4 productions: le sacre du printemps (which i believe to be a less accessible piece), caf mller (an early work), vollmond (a more recent production) & kontakthof (a piece which i believe is originally divided in two different and separate performances, and conceived as workshops - one inviting ""teenagers age 14 and up"" to participate, the other inviting ""ladies and gentlemen age 65 and up"").

to someone completely unfamiliar with her work it should be said that pina bausch's oeuvre does not revolutionize dance through the inventions of moves or outstanding physical achievements but rather through the depth of feelings that she got her dancers to explore and convey. feelings of anguish, terror, love, longing, and pursuing questions of communication and personal boundaries. she would use improvisations and integrate pantomime and small gestures (even sign language) into the works, as well as dream sequences, montages, songs and speech, and much more.

the german wikipedia mentions that she would give her dancers tasks like: ""do something very small. interrupting something, what happens? do something very dangerous with a very cute object. [show] a gesture which has something to do with helplessness."" she would then note the answers & reactions without judgement or comment, thus complying a huge collection of material - of which 90% was then discarded.

pina bausch was asking: how can i express what i am feeling? and is noted for saying: ""i am less interested in how people move but rather what moves them.""

none of these questions are explored in wenders' movie. her dancers - whom we see in individual interviews, often in a silent pose with their voices overlayed - are talking about their experiences with her, yet the insights are limited and almost platitudinal. for instance: one female dancer explains that, because she was fearful of pina out of her respect for her, she would at first hide behind the back of other dancers when pina would critique the troop. eventually pina asked her: ""what's wrong, i am not doing anything [to you]?"" and the dancer eventually learned to relax more in her presence.
another (young) dancer is heard saying that, as the child of two dancers belonging to the troop, she was the first one to be born into the tanztheater, hence growing up in it and that she does not know what life without pina will possibly look like.

these interviews, that are cutting into the selection of the mentioned 4 works that wenders is showing, are also mingled with various sequences, some of them being rather gratuitous - for instance those in which groups of dancers are photographed with an annoying whining sound of a decaying flashbulb.

other sequences take the dancer/s outside, placing them in the middle of the screeching wuppertal-traffic or inside a swimming pool with screaming children in the background, in which the dimly lit dancer in the foreground is moreover being out-staged by the sunlit water in the background.
of these outdoor performances, the first half are being filmed in rather noisy, distracting locations - and of those, especially one sticks out as a strange 'comment': it shows an upbeat performance of a male dancer whose feet are constantly being snapped at by a smallish dog while the dog's owner sits back on a park bench in the background, observing the scene.
later a dancer compares (the almost anorexic) pina bausch to a big, lovable hippo - a prop used in her performance ""arien"" - and i am left wondering if the snappy dog is meant as another `reincarnation' of the late choreographer...

all these repeated interruptions of the 4 performances wenders selected make it difficult to understand and appreciate the works - which, after all, are mainly supposed to explore, express and convey feelings - which are in themselves a subtle language.
instead, her string of thought (= her dancers' performances) is constantly interrupted by an AD(H)D wenders who is imposing himself rather than giving her (dancers) and the audience the room and the opportunity to 'listen', watch and understand what is being 'said'.

wenders decision to take the dancers out of the stage environment and into settings in and around wuppertal is another choice which i find rather alienating - especially in the first half of the movie, where he choses locations in which the performances almost disappear within the settings.
her work is conceived for the stage and seeing the dancers outside in their full 'attire' (lovely flowing dresses for the women - which, on occasions are also worn by men - a 'device' pina liked to play with) makes them stand out like strange flowers in an urban landscape of noise & traffic - again distracting the audience from pina bausch's goal: the conversion of often subtle feelings. while these location choices certainly evoke emotions, they do not allow an inward listening to what is being expressed in the dance.

for the later part, wenders choses calmer and more artistic locations which allow a 'dialog' between the performances and the environment, making these scenes a much more pleasant experience. but while these sequences are a visual feast, they all lead away from pina - and instead of exploring a person with a compelling ethos who pursued many essential questions all her life - wenders imposes his directorial mechanics instead.

to an audience unfamiliar with her work and exhilarated by the dance scenes and the superb 3D quality, wenders movie must feel like a revelation. to people familiar with her work, it is certainly exciting to see her achieve further recognition through wenders' movie. but for those in search for depth and an exploration of her work, this movie is a disappointment.",1353283200,6,7270,4.883211678832117

pretty if not beautiful; they are like pretty flowers and butterflies.  I mean that the dancing style itself, to me, is
not pretty.  It is not balletic, or graceful, but rather very strong and fierce and almost threatening or at times seems
dysfunctional or disabled and very labored. I guess it is not my style to enjoy.

I have seen quite a lot of dance in my times but never anything quite like this.  It is a surprise.  I will watch it again
and see what I feel next viewing.",1334188800,3,598,4.342342342342342
4491740,5,B004X1STT6,"I am not a fan of dance, ballet or modern, but Pina thrilled me from beginning to end.  I've seen it twice now, and the second time was like I had never seen it before and I was, again, entranced.  I look forward to seeing it again...and again....  It's an amazing piece of work by Wim Wenders and Pina Bausch's extraordinary ensemble, guaranteeing that Pina's legend will live on.  Clearly, many of the dancers had been with Pina a long time, and the degree of trust between the dancers speaks to less ego and more collaboration -- something all-too-rare in many art forms.",1334188800,,574,4.543689320388349
4491741,5,B004X1STT6,"I have never had any significant interest in dance or choreography.  Saw this on a whim and was captivated every single second.  The film is almost entirely dance; I could not imagine more emotive, inventive and unique choreography.  ""Poetry in motion"" is a bit of a cliche, but there's no more appropriate description for Pina Bausch's work (and Wim Wenders' celebratory depiction of it.)  Can't wait for the DVD release.",1332979200,,422,4.985714285714286
4491742,5,B004X1STT6,"I've never been entirely convinced by Wim Wenders as a narrative film director-- his talents have always been more situated in the realm of conceptual art than that of the storyteller.  Here he gets a chance to apply his conceptual art strengths to one of the few great artists of our time, Pina Bausch.  The results are often startling, enthralling, and affirmative.

The opening excerpt from Bausch's RITE OF SPRING ranks as one of the greatest pieces of filmmaking I've ever seen.  There is no doubt that Wenders has found the best possible use for 3D.  To be frank, I would have preferred to see the entire performance rather than the documentary which enfolds it, but ideally we can have both (hint to distributors: there are at least five DVDs to be gleaned from the various dances here.  I'd buy all of them!!)

The central section of the film includes excerpts from Bausch's more cerebral work, and it is here that perhaps the film is less effective.  While the work itself is absolutely fascinating, the series of tableaux which Wenders constructs breaks the spell essential to fully entering Bausch's world.  On the other hand, Wenders does create some extraordinary moments possible only through film-- by, for example, intercutting between dancers of various ages-- thus participating in the creative process and making the film itself a document keeping Bausch alive.

Meanwhile, we get- a la ""A Chorus Line,""  the dancers themselves, introduced in close ups Avedon would have been proud of.  This device is interesting, if not, perhaps, in the end, terribly well integrated.  Threading through the film as a leitmotif we get a processional that reminded me of the end of 8 1/2 (A.O. Scott cites ""The Seventh Seal,"" which also suggested itself to me).  It works (we are reassured that the stream of energy Bausch left behind remains) but these cinematic gestures don't approach the brilliance of the work celebrated by the film itself (which is just as it should be, I suppose).

All in all, not one of the greatest documentaries of all time, but absolutely essential, nonetheless.  Magnificent!",1331424000,30,2108,4.962962962962963
4491743,5,B004X1STT6,"Though the film was nominated for Oscar's Best Documentary in 2012, ""Pina"" directed by Wim Wenders (""Wings of Desire"" ""Buena Vista Social Club""), looks more like a tribute to an acclaimed dancer and choreographer Pina Bausch. Because of her sudden death in 2009, the project was almost canceled, but Wenders didn't give up the idea of making a film for her.

So in ""Pina"" you don't see much of the person Pina Bausch herself. Instead, what you will see is largely her works performed by the dancers of the Tanztheater Wuppertal Pina Bausch, contemporary dance pieces filmed for this movie, including except from ""The Rite of Spring,"" ""Caf Mller"" (briefly seen in Pedro Almodvar's ""Talk to Her""), ""Kontakthof"" and ""Full Moon.""

The film also includes the comments of dancers of the company (delivered in voiceovers). What the dancers have to say does not reveal much about the person for whom the film was made. It sounds more like eulogy to their teacher. Perhaps it should be so, though this may not be exactly what you wanted to know.

Though I know little about contemporary dance, I was fascinated by the amazing movements of the dancers that are beautiful, intense and even comical at times. To be honest I sometimes could not understand what those dancers are trying to express with their dancing (which looks often bizarre), I somehow know it is about raw emotions of a human.

I'm not a big fan of Wim Wenders films, of which drama I sometimes find dry and detached. To me he is more like a painter with a camera and he is always good at using the existing landscapes. In ""Pina"" he uses the city of Wuppertal (where Pina Bausch lived for a long time) and its suspension railway (""floating train"") very effectively as the backdrop of dancing scenes.

Those who are interested in Pina Bausch herself may want to watch a documentary ""Dancing Dreams.""",1331251200,3,1855,4.748447204968944

The genius of Pina is evident and Wenders explores that genius in a visually stunning film that consumes and captivates and, for myself, restores memories of my days long ago as a student of modern dance. I especially appreciated the presence of the older dancers, which made me want to move all my furniture against the walls of my living room and dance again!
