8022584,5,B000260QX8,"I had only the dimmest recollection of this show's original run in the US. Mainly I remember Kaz Garas (whom I don't particularly like) and Anthony Quayle (who I like a lot) solving mysteries via taxi cab.

Upon watching the first episode on this DVD set I was afraid I had made a mistake. It had heart surgeons clomping around in white galoshes and bright green scrubs performing surgery in a living room. It was very lame.

I've seen about 12 of 16 episodes now and they're all better than the one with the surgeons. In reading IMDB I see that the lame heart surgery episode was actually one of the last made.

The remaining episodes range from good to excellent, with one ""fair"" in the lot. Even Kaz Garas overacts less than he did later in his career. Anthony Quayle, always excellent, and the interesting plots carry this show along. Boy, what he could have done with Midsomer Murders!

You also get a peek at decor and fashion from the 60's. Walls were apparently bright green or red, hair was big, skirts were tiny, eyelashes were enormous. For the most part this is an excellent DVD set and I will be sad to watch the last episode.",1380844800,,1139,4.461538461538462
8022585,4,B000260QX8,"I Remember this series from the 60's well, the most memorable and fantastic theme tune of any series! I can't believe that so few episodes were made. As mentioned the picture quality looks like it was filmed recently.",1328659200,,217,4.7368421052631575
8022586,5,B000260QX8,"Interesting little series released in 1968 about a semi-retired London criminologist and writer who solves unusual cases Scotland Yard finds simply too baffling or bizarre to resolve.  Think of it as sort of a precursor to the popular ""Quincy, M.E."" from the 80's and the now popular,""CSI:Miami"" among others.

Noted Shakespearean actor Anthony Quayle is Adam Strange, supported by his two assistants, an American student/museum curator and an interior-decorator/artist, played by Kaz Garas and Anneke Wills, respectively. Supporting castmembers and guest stars are from ITC's stable of fine TV actors including Darren Nesbitt and David Houston among others.

The episodes themselves tended to gravitate towards typical crime themes of murder and revenge and issues related to the late 60's and still relevant today: racial integration, illegal drug trafficking, terrorism, campus activism--even illegal immigration and witchcraft.

Network DVD has digitally remastered this set with great care; the transfers look like new--one can hardly believe this series is almost 40 years old! Although the series is somewhat dated, the stories and scripts are interesting, and ""Strange Report""  is an enjoyable trip to swinging London circa 1968.

Although the set indicates Region 0, PAL, you will need a multi-region dvd player to watch this set, or simply view it on your own PC.",1154995200,9,1373,5.514285714285714
