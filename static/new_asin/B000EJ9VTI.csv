8110689,3,B000EJ9VTI,"I felt somewhat foolish to have actually bought this anime so long ago. I wanted to finish the series once everything cheapend up some. Now that they are dirt cheap I went ahead and got the other two. I'm so glad I did that, as I thought this anime took a bad turn. I know some people like the whole yuri thing, to some of us that don't and actually wanted more robot action, this anime is not for you. If anything you'll have one more ""interesting"" robot fight before crap hits the fan and drama rules the rest of this anime.  Should know better with all the implications that were there, it seemed promising at the time. Go look else where like Goddanar or Big O for a good dose of robot action and a seasoning of drama. The only reason I didn't lower it further bc it was pretty to look at, was not going to hurt my wallet, and had humorous villians with a little mix of why they were bad in the first place.",1267660800,,911,4.117977528089888
8110690,3,B000EJ9VTI,"While this volume did do a bit better to keep my attention and the twist at the end of the last episode has me curious to see how this series is going to end on the last volume, I really can't say that this series is anything more than just very average. The concept is good. I really like the concept in fact. But I really feel like it was executed quite badly.

  I am going to reserve final judgment for when I finish the final volume but right now there's really no reason I can think of to tell people that they need to go see this series.",1213920000,,544,3.9724770642201834
8110691,5,B000EJ9VTI,"Souma has sworn to be Himeko's protector no matter what happens, but in Chikane's mind, that was a place reserved for herself alone. You see, try as she might to deny it, she loves Himeko as more than a friend. Her feelings are of a more romantic and carnal nature. Her love is more than the Platonic that Himeko feels for her. As she sees Himeko and Souma start to develop a relationship she begins to suffer an Anakin Skywalker temptation by the dark side, in the form of one of the Orochi necks showing Chikane her hidden desires. Or at least what the servant of evil imagines to be her lust. And yes, the Necks are still around, and one of them is even Souma's real brother. Meanwhile, Himeko and Chikane's efforts to revive the warrior that will reseal the Orochi continue to end in failure, probably due to Chikane's less than pure conflict of emotions about Himeko.

After watching Volume 1 of Kannazuki No Miko I found the show interesting and intriguing but not on the top of the entertainment list, but Geneon has been putting shows like this out lately. Shows which you can't judge based solely on one volume. The same can be said for Starship Operators. Yeah, there's plenty of cheeseball mecha battles here and the Orochi are still downright goofy, but the cornball elements of the show give you a breather from the intense melancholy that suffuses this show. That sadness of course stems from Chikane's tragic love for another woman who doesn't have a clue to her friends true feelings. The fact that some of the characters are turning against each other because of love just makes it sadder. So it's almost a welcome relief to see evil nurse catgirls calling out battle attacks from their mecha to let you catch your breath from doomed relationships. This is a show that just gets better and better.

I would also highly recommend Starship Operators.",1153094400,6,1865,4.648484848484848
