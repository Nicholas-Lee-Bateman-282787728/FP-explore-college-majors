2256243,3,B000815FL0,"Awesome series overall, but it's riddled with factual errors. The annelids episode especially. The sponge episode is really awesome. I guess I'd say it's hit and miss. Not for aspiring biologists.",1359417600,,196,5.354838709677419
2256244,5,B000815FL0,"I teach high school biology and we use this series every year to discuss classification of organisms as well as tie in evolutionary relationships.  There are activities that go along with each film and by the end of the films we have created a large poster with the characteristics of each phyla.  I highly recommend this series, it is detailed and entertaining and interesting.",1268352000,,378,4.890625
2256245,5,B000815FL0,"Documentaries are pretty much all we watch on TV, and my 11 year old son (future biologist) has seen pretty much every nature documentary ever made, from PBS to BBC to Discovery, etc. This is one of the best series we have EVER seen, and we have all watched it multiple times. It's a shame it's not more widely known because it is easily as good as (better than, IMHO) PBS/BBC documentaries on the same subject. It covers the evolution of life on earth by explaining the gradual changes in anatomy (invertebrates to vertebrates, etc). Fascinating information, first-class photography and graphics, and some of the weirdest-looking creatures you have ever seen!

I disagree with the previous reviewer who said it is difficult to understand; I have no background in biology but I understood everything and so did my kids. We learned so much from this series!",1240272000,5,856,4.863013698630137
2256246,5,B000815FL0,"This documentary discusses recent researches on evolution. It focuses mainly on early marine life and starts with the earliest complex animals, sponges.

From there on, it describes how evolution branched, tried new tools, inventing the ones we often consider consubstantial to animal life: sensing the world -including the latter invention of modern eyes,- moving, modern sexuality and hunting.

The show is very good, one of the best documentaries I've seen, but not an easy one -maybe only for me since English is my secondary language.

It is not something you would see to have an easy overview of evolution, or that you would show to people who don't think much of evoluionary sciences (genetics, paleontology, biological chemistry, etc)

It is build around some hugely important animal inventions, and is demanding intellectually.

After seeing this, you will probably have a renewed and more profound understanding of what the animal kingdom represents. Though it is not about plant life, you get to see how most complex forms of animal life share a set of basic designs that actually were invented at some point and had a great success.

Save for the Jerome Mordillat films (Corpus Christi, Origin of Christianity, Apocalypse) ""Shape of life"" are my favorite documentary movies. Both those films actually share the same emphasis on following top scholars and not fearing to discuss complex subjects, and are not made to please a viewer with only an average interest in cutting edge research.",1236816000,,1500,5.177685950413223
2256247,5,B000815FL0,"This relatively obscure series (2002) is a real find. 8 near hour long episodes on 4 DVDs tell the story of primarily invertebrates of the sea (sponges, anenomes, flatworms, molluscs, arthropods, jellyfish, sea stars, etc...) over the course of time and how we relate and in some cases depend on these seemingly lowly creatures. Amazing video footage and computer graphics clearly explain everything. The scope of the video is worldwide. This is documentary film-making at its best. I couldn't help but get excited over things I've seen in real life and taken for granted as a scuba diver.

You can learn more about this series at the [...] website.

I also *HIGHLY* recommend the Journey of Man DVD (Logical sequel) and Evolution 4-DVD set, and National Geographic's Strange Days on Planet Earth 2-DVD set. If you enjoy the ocean or just being around water, I also recommend BBC's Blue Planet. Videos like these should be mass distributed for free!",1127001600,14,949,4.962264150943396

8055163,5,B000815FL0,I use these in my high school Marine Science class! Perfect to aid in teaching!,1475020800,,79,4.333333333333333
8055164,5,B000815FL0,"It is the best documentary of the earliest forms of life I've ever seen.  And the connections among those early forms are well-connected.  I know something about those, and I learned more than I expected.",1443225600,,204,4.8
8055165,5,B000815FL0,"VOICE IN ENGLISH OR SPANISH! I don't know why this was left out of the ""product description"", since it increases the market for this crucial educational resource enormously. I live in Panam part of the year; all DVD players play system 1 AND 4. I'm carrying down a set to the schools in the town where I do volunteer work. Science videos in Spanish are almost nonexistent there.
Excellent series. Just detailed enough to give students an idea of how biological research is done, in the context of amazing images. I learn something new every time I watch it.",1442102400,,557,4.636363636363637
8055166,5,B000815FL0,Love this series. Great Visuals. Awesome progression for MS kids.,1441756800,,65,5.6
8055167,5,B000815FL0,"I was pleasantly surprised by this series.

According to the DVD jacket, ""The Shape of Life tells the gripping and magnificent tale of the beginnings of all animal life"". I would agree with that, and it does a good job. There are eight one-hour episodes. It was funded by the National Science Foundation and some major private foundations. It is obvious a lot of effort and thought went into the series.

There is lots of great video footage of many different animals. It focuses on our primitive ancestors, where the fundamental body plans arose. The videos of flatworms especially intrigued me. There is also good computer animation about the best guess of what life looked like millions of years ago. The underlying science is good. The narrator, Peter Coyote, was good.

A lot of scientists make little presentations and talk. As you can imagine, some of them are not the best communicators. But they pretty much did a good job. One scientist really fascinated me. Blind from childhood, he specializes in mollusk shells, which he understands incredibly well due to his interest and heightened sense of touch.

This video would be well suited for a high school class, or for anyone interested in biology and evolution. It bears watching several times. There is a lot of information here, but it's not boring.",1399248000,,1311,4.891891891891892
8055168,5,B000815FL0,Each of the episodes is interesting and I've used the entire episode or parts of it.  The videos should be viewed prior to showing students.,1396915200,,140,4.6
8055169,4,B000815FL0,There is some very interesting material covered in this series.  One common ancestor has a revolutionary break through that leads to an explosion of new life.  This has happened countless times in the evolution of life on earth.  This series focuses on the Cambrian explosion when there was a proliferation of life on earth.  Life in essence was experimenting with new forms and ideas.  Many of these are still with us.  Good stuff.  My only issue is I bought these to view with my kids and they are a little slow to capture their interest right now.  I also thought they focused too much on some stuff like sponges and did not cover our lineage amphibians-reptiles-dinosaurs / birds / mammals in as much depth as I would have liked.  But a very interesting series for those interested in the subject.,1390521600,,801,4.664285714285715
8055170,5,B000815FL0,These are pretty educational videos. My kids like them and my son even took them to school and they watched them after testing.,1374019200,,127,4.565217391304348
8055171,5,B000815FL0,This series originally aired on PBS and I have been looking all over for DVD's of it.  It is very hard to find.  It covers the animal kingdom starting with the sponges.  The photography is good.  Some of the marine invertebrates that they show have vibrant color. I have watched only one of the discs so far but I am very happy with it.  There is a segment from this series that I always show my class and the DVD's work pretty well for that.,1372464000,,442,4.152941176470589
