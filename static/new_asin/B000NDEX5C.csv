8177093,2,B000NDEX5C,"I scored this DVD as a freebie so I can't complain overmuch. But this is really quite a strange little package. Seemingly released by some mob called Deadline Music it's a collection of 21 hard rock and metal video clips with bands ranging from Children of Bodom to Europe to White Lion to Anthrax. The set list, so to speak, is fairly impressive and should pretty much rip across large chunks of the HR/HM spectrum.

Problems arise though not so much in the song selection but from the fact that these aren't necessarily the video clips we all know these songs by. Many seem to come from live DVD's or some other unknown source. Now while seeing new footage is hardly something I'm going to complain about it's not what you think you are going to get when you slip the thing into your DVD player. Secondly, wherever these clips came from they aren't necessarily in the best shape in terms of picture quality. There is a voiceover at the start of the Accept song and inexplicably part of the way through the guitar solo by Mr Schenker himself the clip breaks away to two of the blokes playing golf in trainers, very tight white shorts and caps. What on earth???

As for the audio quality, the sound drops in and out all over a bunch of these tunes - where did they pull all this from - MTV shows or something? And that's a double pity because as I said there is a whole rogues gallery of hard rockin' going on here and to see many of these bands on the same DVD is pretty nifty.

All up I'm not ashamed to own it, but then I didn't part with any cash to get it.",1271203200,2,1561,4.266891891891892
8177094,4,B000NDEX5C,"I thought this dvd was an awesome bargain & worth the price simply for the vintage UFO, Accept & Ian Gillan clips. Some videos better than others, but a very enjoyable watch & a party favorite at our house!",1191110400,2,206,4.3076923076923075
8177095,1,B000NDEX5C,"I buy all metal DVDs.  I have a wall full of them.  This is the worst one I ever bought.  Why ? 21 songs, only four are video clips.  I actually own most of the DVDs these live clips come from ( Poison live with Ritchie Kotzen, the Cinderella live DVD, Motorhead Stagefright, even Accept - I have their live DVD ).

Speaking of which, the Accept song has got a voice over through it, and that DVD has the clip, which they could have used instead !!!

Artists like Anthrax and Poison ( OK, I have all their clips on DVD anyhow ), are not even the original band that released the song included.

At least two of these songs were recorded by a fan with a video camera in the audience, in the later years of the band.  At least 3 others look like they were lifted of VHS taped from the TV in 1990.

The point of this compilation is to give you some songs from a number of live DVDs that DeadLine release.  Nowhere do they claim these songs are the original video clips, but it's implied, in my book, and low quality, the usual mix of good and bad songs to start with, and the fact that most of these are live, makes this a total ripoff in my book.",1181779200,7,1143,4.04
