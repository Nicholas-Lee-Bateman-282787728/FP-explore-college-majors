5553285,5,B00B2TU1R0,I purchased season 2 because I so enjoyed season 1.  The envelope is pushed on the many sexual encounters.  Sex is used as a tool.  Outside of that I wish there was a season 3.,1365984000,,176,3.9714285714285715
5553286,5,B00B2TU1R0,I am looking at two reviews one is a five and the other a one. Have I seen the second second season ? No ok on I have not but I know if I do not  well damit I just gotta see it.

5553287,5,B00B2TU1R0,"I think Kyle is a disgruntled employee or something with a vendetta. Couldn't be farther from the truth. Season two is was exceptional. It was more indepth, smart subplots and acting that was above excellence. This wasn't your BOSS, Kyle this was a television show.",1364342400,2,265,4.911111111111111

5553289,5,B00B2TU1R0,"The two seasons of Boss were so close to political truth they were scary. It would not shock me to find out that Starz was asked not to continue the series by those who have influence over the industry for their own political reasons. I also believe that it may have been too ""intellectually"" challenging for the viewers of the usual action violence as opposed to the undercover targeted violence of political intrigue and scandal. I will miss this series and have recommended it to many who NEVER saw Boss while it was on the air. Too bad, Kelsey Grammar and cast will be sorely missed. I am glad to own season 1 and now to order season 2.",1362614400,44,640,4.38655462184874
5553290,1,B00B2TU1R0,"Season 2 was an utter abortion that was made to appeal to the lowest common denominator.  It was farcical series that did nothing but tarnish the repuation of the gritty and smart Season 1.  Grammer tried, but he couldn't carry the entire series on his back.  At times I got the impression that Grammer himself thought the plotline was totally ludicrous.  A casino?  Puh-lease!  Just one of many ridiculous plot ""twists"" that was so far from reality it made the show unwatchable.  If you enjoyed season 1, do not ruin your impression of a great show by watching this garbage.",1361232000,6,575,4.69
5553311,5,B00B2TU1R0,"This was FANTASTIC! Kelsie Grammer demonstrated what good...no make that GREAT acting is all about! As with all great actors, they can make you feel as if they really are the character they are portraying and Grammer nails it! You never feel as if he is acting. You actually believe he really is a very ill, very forceful, and very wicked Mayor Kane. This tour de force is in my opinion the best thing that Kelsie Grammer has ever done and may ever do.

Sad to say, that the series was canceled after only two seasons. (Ratings most likely and ratings are $$$.) But get this if you want to see the gritty side of Chicago politics.",1485216000,,630,4.384615384615385

5553336,4,B00B2TU1R0,"Generally, I liked this short lived cable series - farfetched as it sometimes got. The worst part is the Mayor's daughter. She's some kind of episcopal clergyman - delivering sermons, running a free health clinic for the poor. At the same time she's a nymphomaniac, drug addict with an adolescent hatred of her parents (though she's in her late 20's). The show's creators probably patted themselves on the back for writing such a complex and diverse character. I thought she was just a bit over the top.",1459728000,,503,4.793103448275862

5553341,2,B00B2TU1R0,"Season 1 was outstanding.  Truly a novel idea and very well written.  However Season 2 fails in comparison.  It's no wonder that viewership dropped and the show was cancelled after this season.  By episode 6 the storyline becomes farfetched and unrealistic.  There's absolutely no way that any candidate for state governor who gets caught in a highly publicized sex scandal would ever be able to salvage his/her candicacy.  But yet in this season Zajac keeps coming back like a bad disease.  I just rolled my eyes at the audacity of the script writers who actually think that such a story would be believable.  And the Sentinal editor/reporter who physically accosts interviewees while questioning them (the nurse from the Toronto clinic) and the nurse gets caves in and answers questions that violate patient confidentiality.  Like I said, farfetched.  The show lost me after this.  I couldn't wait for the final two episodes to end.  How unfortunate because Kelsey Grammar was outstanding throughout the series.",1441497600,4,1013,5.147239263803681

5553346,5,B00B2TU1R0,"Really great cable tv show which was unfortunately limited to only 2 seasons.  Kelsey Grammer stars as the mayor of Chicago, who is hard nosed, hard headed, and definitely unscrupulous, as he manages a difficult city while also contending with a brain disorder which he tries to keep under wraps as much as possible.  Connie Nielson plays his wife, and although she may initially come off sweet, don't be fooled as she can have her own agenda as well as anybody on the show.  Season 2 features a mysterious assassination attempt, the controversial closing of a low rent community clearly inspired by the old Cabrini Green housing project, as well as a candidate for governor who seems poised for greatness but can't seem to get his personal life out of the way.  There's plenty more going on but I'll leave it at that.  Grammer is great in this, featuring fiery intensity & managing to make a shady politician somewhat sympathetic along the way.  The supporting cast is generally excellent with some of my personal favorites being Kathleen Robertson as Kitty, Martin Donovan as Ezra, Jeff Hephner as Zajac, rapper/actor T.I. as Trey, and special kudos to Jonathan Groff as an assistant to the mayor.  He is almost spookily great.  This show has more edge & intensity than anything on the networks, and could go toe to toe with any cable series as well.  Highly recommended.",1433548800,,1373,4.808510638297872

5553468,5,B00B2TU1R0,"Wow!! What a master piece. Kelsey Grammar  plays a political mastermind manipulating lives, events, economy far beyond  anyones capacity to fathom. Anything anyone does, no matter what they think they are doing of their own choice or otherwise in the end seems only that which occurs by way of the Mayors divine plan, proving himself in a leauge of his own, with all other players operating out their leauge. No measure beyond using, No truth beyond breaking, no person beyond sacrificing, Evil with purpose, power, greed, corruption, in depth coniving, ruthless, no holds barred politics. Could have done without the soft porn, but I see the purpose in it, almost to the point of recognizing it as neccesary. Great, great acting all around, with Kelsey Grammer taking it to another level. Definately for adults only, and I reccomend it so very highly, especially to any who ever even pretended to consider a career in politics. Not worthy of a third season?!! Unbeleivable!!",1386115200,,975,5.012345679012346

There is a lot of sex, so this is not for kids.  I think that Kelsey Grammer, like A few other comedians (e.g. Robbin Williams and Steve Martin) is far better in a serious, dramatic role than in a comedy.

There is lots of Chicago and Illinois politics and grit in there too -- and, sadly for the verisimilitude, corruption.

Boss is also character drama, drugs, and and romance -- night soap stuff, yes.  The boss-mayor comes close to JR Ewing in some ways.  There is also unreality in there, and some of it is distracting.

5553554,5,B00B2TU1R0,"""Boss"" is loosely based on the great 20th century mayors of Chicago who ran the Windy City with a mixture of power, political acumen, and (dare we say it) an honest wish for the success of the city (that is, as long as all three could be simultaneously achieved). As we watch the story of ""Boss"" unfold over two seasons, we see a powerful Chicago mayor (Mayor Kane) as he keeps an iron fist over what he has achieved over the years in coming up the ranks of the Chicago system, and doing so while he wrestles with a serious physical illness. Although endowing the character with this illness is the twist in the story that makes it different from the city's actual mayoral history, anyone who grew up in Chicago instantly recognizes the reference (as does any reader of Mike Royko's columns in the Chicago Tribune published over those years), a steely parallel between the role and the reality: it's like dirty street fighting waged in men's dress suits. Anyone raised in the Chicago area, too, recognizes all the details: the types of clothing, the names of towns throughout the state, the hairstyles, even the styles of glasses. Of course, there were no smart phones in those years, but this is a modern telling of a slightly older story. Somebody really got this right in both execution AND detail.

Fans of Boss were greatly excited to see the second season of this critically acclaimed show (Grammer won a Golden Globe for best dramatic performance in Season One), and, for the most part, Season Two does not disappoint. We can easily say again what we said after watching Season One of Boss: this is Grammer's greatest role to date, and demonstrates that his acting skills cover drama, not only comedy (as we saw in 11 years of Frasier). Grammer won four Emmy's for his work in Frasier, and, I believe, was nominated for even more, so it's a high bar to pass, but fans of Boss know that something very impressive is occurring in Grammer's portrayal of this role, something that had not happened even in a show as strong as Frasier. I said it after watching Season One of Boss, and I'll say it here again: Grammer is so good in this role that it is SCARY.

Grammer has said that ""Boss"" is not really about politics, but rather about the craving for power. Although I can see the argument, it's really difficult to untangle the two in this setting. But that is irrelevant. Boss takes you in and drops you off into this world of political machinations, power politics, dirty campaigning, and even municipal operations (we see almost as much of the city alderman and ward bosses as we do ""the Boss"" himself) to the point where this could be more Machiavelli than Royko, and anyone who is interested in how political wheelings and dealings occur in such a setting will almost certainly be fascinated. We see how the Boss faces every challenge, defies every obstacle, and navigates through (and between) deceit, both personal and political, to keep himself where he wishes to be, at the reins of this most central of cities.

A small criticism of Season Two of ""Boss"" has been that some of the story lines become a bit more extravagant and difficult believe when compared to Season One. That may be partially true, but it's not a big concern. It is true that the first season stayed within a somewhat more constrained story line and that the second tends to open up multiple simultaneous lines. Some of Season Two can be a bit difficult to follow because of that very fact, and that's why purchasing this on disk is helpful, because you may very well need to watch the show twice to pick up all the twists and outcomes. But after watching Season One and have started Season Two, you'll likely be hanging on every scene to see how the stories play out. But the overarching story line is a somewhat unusual premise, a city boss with a terrible illness and a city to keep in his pocket while he keeps himself together. And Grammer does it superbly: this is certainly his best work to date, and you find yourself being drawn into the story because of the commanding performance he elicits. The excellent performances of nearly everyone makes it a great ensemble cast.

There is really no reason to watch Season Two before Season One, and, in reality, due to the complexities built into the story, Season Two will not really make a whole lot of sense without having first watched Season One. Both seasons are out on Blu-Ray and DVD, so pick up Season One first, and work through those eight episodes, and then come to Season Two (ten episodes). If you have a Blu-Ray player and a HD television, you'll see Chicago glisten in many of the shots. It's really a unique city that is almost always overshadowed by its noisier competitors on both the east and west coasts (and due to the Midwesterner's subdued demeanor) but nevertheless holds its own special beauty.

Boss. It's engrossing, powerful, challenging. It's unusual. It's educating, in some strange way. It sports a superb cast, excellent production values, and doesn't insult the viewer by dumbing anything down. You'll be angry at the end of Season Two that a third season was not made, but don't let that deter you. There's really no way to rate this show as anything less than five stars.

Every episode rides the razor's edge with masterful precision. Damn good TV. You may never want to vote again, though. I'm just sayin'...",1367107200,,340,4.982456140350878
5553582,4,B00B2TU1R0,Gripping story of power and corruption in the second city.  Too bad it has been cancelled.  One more season to close out the series was needed.,1367020800,,143,4.461538461538462
5553583,5,B00B2TU1R0,"It's a real shame that Boss has been cancelled. It was easily one of the best TV shows in recent history. The acting was superb from all the actors, especially Kelsey. The writing was smart, twisty and engaging. The production quality was similarly top-notch. It was what I was hoping House of Cards was going to be, but HoC lacked the dark, gritty spirit that Boss so perfectly captures. Maybe Netflix or some other production company will pick it up. But even though the story was left unfinished, it's still worth a watch.",1366848000,,525,4.655913978494624
5553584,5,B00B2TU1R0,"Excellent cast, story, complex without being overbearing, you get really involved with all the characters - one of the best shows ever. Sad that the second season is the last one. Will miss the show!",1366761600,,199,4.714285714285714
5553585,5,B00B2TU1R0,Politics unleashed with intrigue and fury/  When you think you have figured out who will prevail and why - you are wrong.,1366588800,,121,4.5
5553586,4,B00B2TU1R0,No city has politics like Chicago. Grammer does an awesome job performing as mayor and executing all of the drama and corruption of Chicago politics.,1366416000,,149,5.0
5553587,5,B00B2TU1R0,"Very excellent show, good writing, directing and acting.  Too bad they will not continue it further.  Nevertheless worth your while.",1366329600,,132,5.55
5553588,5,B00B2TU1R0,"I grew-up in Chicago during the (original) Daley era and find this VERY realistic! While I was NOT a ""Fraiser"" Fan I AM A FAN OF THIS ONE",1366156800,,137,3.9285714285714284
8561695,5,B00B2TU1R0,One of the best TV dramas ever done.  Grammer is fabulous in the title role.,1529625600,,76,4.066666666666666

8561697,3,B00B2TU1R0,"The hallucinations were getting boring. The old 1930's corruption is somewhat humorous. I liked session one was looking forward for session 2 but  it turned me off, I almost gave up.  It did end on an interesting note but I could not put up with the hallucinations if there was a third season. I would have stopped watching it. I loved the Kitty character, and Kelsey Grammer is great. I grew up in Chicago so all the reference to the city was wonderful and the state as well. Jury is outo n this one.",1514592000,,501,4.319148936170213
8561698,2,B00B2TU1R0,It could have easily been good....but the people in charge decided to go from filth to more filth. They would have you believe that everyone must be having some sort of ugly sex at all times and in every conceivable place..and that no one can possibly have a conversation without the f and s words being in every sentence....it just seems that was what they were mostly concentrating on.. Did they think they had to use all that filth to sell their program? Too bad they didn't really try to concentrate on the story line and create a little more interest in what each character was doing.. It was very simple... you could write a one sentence ugly description of every person and that would be as deep as this program gets...The program didn't get better...it just added more filth as time went on.,1505347200,,799,4.555555555555555
8561699,1,B00B2TU1R0,There should be ratings on tv series.  This one is disgusting.,1503273600,,62,4.636363636363637
