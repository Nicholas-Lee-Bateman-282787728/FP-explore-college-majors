8586253,3,B00CTZX628,"When I saw this series I was excited because this is the first new shaolin series in some time. Traditionally, of course, a ""belt"" system of rankings is not part of the Shaolin system. However, introduction of such a ranking system can be useful for beginners as long as it doesn't obscure the fact that the Shaolin system does have its own organization.

The video does introduce some interesting ideas such as breaking up the form into a series of slow motion sections and then labeling the moves in the section.

But in my opinion, there are some  very serious problems with the videography which the producer could easily correct.

People perceive actions by orienting their own body space around what they see. The video of the live motion sections uses more than one camera and the editor constantly switches between cameras. Thus, it's impossible to orient one's perception and thus see accurately what is going on. The scene is constantly jumping all over the place. It's very disturbing to watch. Having a professional video producer makes all the difference in the world. For sports photography it's nice to have different views. But for teaching it's a disaster.

There are a couple of other errors with the video
1. shoot actions against a plain background so that all the clutter won't distract from what is going on.
2. Shoot at face level (not looking up) so that the proportions of the body of the person doing the action are
  accurately represented.
3. Don't let the main camera constantly jerk around. It should be mounted on something solid. The sensation it gives is
one that makes me feel dizzy.

I really looked forward to this series of videos but after this one I'd be very reluctant to buy another one. Use of a professional
videographer and editor can make all the difference in the world.",1401321600,3,1816,4.761146496815287
