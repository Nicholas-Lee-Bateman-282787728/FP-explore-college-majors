340120,5,6301564480,"I just adore this film. I first caught it earlier this year (2007) on TCM (my absolute favorite station) and it was a true joy to watch. I believe TCM was running a Ginger Rogers' birthday marathon, so for me, it was a great opportunity to see her away from Fred Astaire.  I have seen nearly all of the Fred and Ginger movies, but was curious about Ginger's success away from those musicals.

Needless to say, this is quite the gem.  I was interested in just how a story with this plot would be handled, particularly in the 30s, but everything was kept comedic and the writers didn't take themselves too seriously.

The premise is that Ginger (Polly Parrish) finds a baby left on a doorstep and tries to drop him off at an orphanage.  Well, the head of the orphanage tracks her down after finding out she's set to lose her job. He figures that's why she's giving up the baby, and he sets out to see David Niven (David Merlin) so he can be made aware of what she's done and what he can do to help her. Well, David allows Polly to keep her job with an increase in pay, and he tells her that a surprise will be waiting for her when she arrives home. Polly, stunned by his actions, doesn't think that it has anything to do w/the bizarre thoughts that people have about the little guy being hers.  When she gets home that night and finds the baby (whom she named John), we see the beginning of some hilarious events that will have you laughing.

I truly enjoyed this movie. I was never bored. It's not very long which is great. Each of the actors, particularly Ginger and Niven, work great together. Nobody was hamming it up.

My favorite scene was with Merlin, Sr. when he founds out that he is a grandfather. Of course, ""we"" viewers know that isn't true, but to watch him melt over a kid that couldn't possibly be his and already make plans for him as an heir is hilarious. And the looks on Polly and David's faces when they discover what the old man thought are priceless.

I was disappointed to know that this hasn't made it to DVD yet, but here's hoping that it eventually will.",1199059200,,2078,4.32133676092545
340121,5,6301564480,"Polly's friend (staring at the baby): ""Where did it come from?""
Polly: ""I got it for Christmas.""
Polly's friend: ""This Christmas, or last Christmas?""

Lovely and multi-talented, and a best actress Oscar winner, Ginger Rogers might be chagrined to find that, today, she's still best known as Fred Astaire's dancing partner. But there's no denying Ginger's skills. A wonderful comedienne and an accomplished dramatic actress, the girl can sing and dance and, brother, she can even act. Her star ascended with Astaire, but after nine very successful but rigorous films with him, Ginger took a break from musicals. Her very next project was 1939's sparkling romantic comedy BACHELOR MOTHER, made at the peak of her career. We all know how many all time classics were filmed in that fabled year, so the fact that this picture was a tremendous box office hit speaks for itself. This movie was remade in 1956 by RKO as&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Bundle-of-Joy/dp/6304383193/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Bundle of Joy</a>&nbsp;(VHS), starring Debbie Reynolds and Eddie Fisher. While a good comedy in its own right, it's not as well regarded and doesn't quite measure up to BACHELOR MOTHER.

It's Christmas time in New York City, and department store salesgirl Polly Parrish (Rogers) has just been notified of her end-of-the-day sacking. Departing from work she strolls by an orphanage and witnesses a woman abandoning a baby at the front steps. With the woman having fled, Polly picks up the baby as, moments later, the door to the orphanage opens, and here comes the mistaken identity. Now no one believes that Polly's not the mother. Her department store, Merlin's, comes to her aid, reinstating her in her salesgirl position. Even young David Merlin (David Niven), heir to the business, drops by to give unsound baby advice. What's a girl to do?

BACHELOR MOTHER is a feel good movie, simply ideal for the holidays. The movie does a good job of balancing its sentimental sappiness with a playful sense of humor. There's even a dig at the stuffed shirt bureaucracy of businesses like Merlin's. The top notch cast manages to keep everything grounded and plausible, in spite of the zaniness which colors the film. With BACHELOR MOTHER Ginger again shows that she does have drawing power without Fred Astaire. As the working class bachelorette who has motherhood abruptly thrust upon her, Ginger's never been more engaging or funny. Her performance is nicely subdued and reveals a tender and vulnerable side. While it's wholly understandable that her young and fancy free character would rebel at being saddled with a strange infant, it's not too farfetched that she soon falls in love with the kid. Ginger is very good here. And she even gets a chance to do some hoofing in a dance competition.

Classy David Niven turns in a performance which shouldn't be short-changed. After various solid supporting roles, this is where he graduated to his first romantic comedy lead, and he proves to be a natural. Chemistry is never guaranteed, but David and Ginger prove to have it in bunches. They make a charming couple, and I truly relished their back and forth patter and how they played off each other. Meanwhile, a movie can't ever go wrong by featuring Charles Coburn. He's up there on my list of all-time character actors, along with, let's say, Claude Raines, Edward Arnold, Eugene Pallette, S.Z. ""Cuddles"" Sakall, and Walter Brennan. As David's father who longs for a grandson, Coburn brings instant onscreen credibility. And, of course, one must never, never underestimate the cuteness of a baby.

In the Apropos of Nothing Department: What are the odds that I'd pop in two old comedies in a row and hear Donald Duck noises from both? First, in the entertaining 1938 screwball comedy JOY OF LIVING. And, now, in BACHELOR MOTHER. Coincidence? Well, yeah, probably.",1198368000,3,3902,5.138582677165354

7813145,5,6301564480,"If you want a movie that will entertain you and keep you laughing all night long . . . this is the one!  In a stunning performance, Ginger Rogers portrays a shop girl who through no fault of her own ends up with a baby.  And while she tries to convince everyone that the baby isn't hers, nobody believes her.  And through hilarious happenings, the owner of the shop where she works becomes convinced that he's the Grandfather (and there is a resemblance!)  and is insistent that he will get the child at all costs. Enter into the story a romance between the the son of the company's owner and Ginger Rogers, and Hollywood cinema is at its greatest.  This is a movie I can watch over and over again.  Even my Mother, who suffers through my classic movie passion, enjoyed this movie with much delight.  This movie is wonderful.  And why in the world it isn't available anymore except on old VHS copies is beyond me.  But if you can find an old VHS copy, BUY it!  This is good clean comedy everyone can enjoy.  Five out of five stars, with all five being super novas!

P.S.  The baby is a fantastic actor in his own right!",1268438400,3,1119,4.322115384615385

7813147,5,6301564480,"This movie is a New Years Eve tradition in my household.  We have an old beat up VHS copy that we dust off and watch every year.  It is probably my favorite Ginger Rogers movie, and David Niven's performance is priceless.  Charles Coburn also puts in a great performance as David Niven's stodgy, grandchild-hungry father.  There's a scene where Coburn keeps throwing tea spoons out of his frustration with David Niven's character .....the butler's bewildered response is hilarious.  And my brother and I will forever say that our car is ""Champing at the Curb"" because of this movie.

I don't understand how the lame, horrible remake of this movie ""Bringing Up Baby"" has made it's way to DVD, but this movie seems to be locked away somewhere deep in the old RKO  vaults.  Please PLEASE  put this movie on DVD!!!",1256774400,,810,4.728571428571429

7813150,5,6301564480,"The year 1939 is always noted for the number of great films that were produced; the list of titles is almost surreal when you think they were all produced that same year.  It has always amazed me how 'Bachelor Mother', filmed that same year, could be overlooked for so long.  It is truly one of the finest b/w comedies to come out of the 30s/40s.

The acting is superb, the editing is top-notch, the movie's flow never falters or slows, & almost every scene is memorable.  This is one of those movies that I've seen so many times that I've lost count - one of my favorite holiday flicks.  Thanks to TCM I was able to enjoy it again over the past holidays.  (And to think I had forgotten the wind-up toy ducks.)

Rogers & Niven are at their best.  Their chemistry together works like a well-oiled machine and it never falters.  I know she won an oscar for her role in&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Kitty-Foyle/dp/B000BYA4FG/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Kitty Foyle</a>; but for my choice, this is her most memorable & enjoyable role.

7813151,5,6301564480,"A warm-hearted family movie that makes you laugh. In the era of Hollywood where they did not need overt sexual activity to entertain, but relied upon the skills of the actors, this is another of those classic movies you can enjoy with the whole family.  David Niven and Ginger Rogers are wonderful together. The banter is quick and witty, though enough is there for kids to enjoy, if those kids are used to seeing movies that are not ""dumbed down"", as most are today.

No spoilers here:  the best scene is New Year's Eve party where Ginger Rogers pretends to know no English.

 Where is the US DVD release of this fine movie??",1210636800,5,626,4.504424778761062
7813152,5,6301564480,"Bachelor Mother is an almost perfect romantic comedy from 1939 that's ideal for the holiday season. Ginger Rogers is the shopgirl who loses her job on Christmas Eve and who makes the mistake of holding an abandoned baby outside a foundlings home: from that point on, everyone thinks it's hers, and when boss's son David Niven gets her her job back and gives her a raise to look after the baby, they assume he's the father. Norman Krasna's then-risque script (although remade in 1952 as Bundle of Joy, it's film that wouldn't be easy to remake with today's very different social mores) is sharp, Garson Kanin's direction pitch-perfect and the film full of memorable moments, from David Niven's scornful impersonation of Ginger Rogers' jitterbugging or his attempt to return a faulty Donald Duck toy - Donald Duck plays a large part in the proceedings - at his own store to Rogers pretending to be Svedish at a New Year's Eve party. There's a good supporting cast too, not least Charles Coburn as the determined family patriarch who isn't going to let facts get in the way - ""I don't care who the father is, I'm the grandfather!"" Great fun, it's perfect for Christmas and the New Year. And remember - ""Keep those ducks in motion!""

The French DVD - released as Mademoiselle et son Bb - offers an acceptable but not outstanding transfer with English soundtrack and removeable French subtitles.",1202515200,2,1390,4.791666666666667
