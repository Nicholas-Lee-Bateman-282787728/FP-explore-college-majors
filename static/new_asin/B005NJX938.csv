8480549,5,B005NJX938,"This is a ""hidden gem"" Anime DVD that I first saw on You Tube. Apparently it's not available in the U.S. as yet. but I tracked one down from a dealer in Kuala Lumpur. They included a duplicate disc because of tracking delays. Very clever story in 12 episodes with great quality graphics. Several little pinups dominate the story with care given to developing their individual characters. Hopefully, they will make this available to U.S. sources sometime soon as they are missing out on a DVD that should sell like hot cakes to Anime followers. One of best Anime's I've ever seen!",1444867200,,579,4.686274509803922

The oldest son was there long time ago. He meet a girl.  and the rest is history. It bite short but good.,1399939200,,267,3.732142857142857
