4397040,5,B004KL0OVU,"I had never heard of Mr Wallenberg until I watched this movie.  What a wonderful, brave man.  It does bother me that we don't know what really happened to him.  Richard Chamberlain's portrayal of Mr Wallenberg was great (he usually is great).  A good movie for history buffs.",1304294400,56,275,4.666666666666667
4397041,5,B004KL0OVU,A masterful depiction of the rescue of thousands of Jews from the death camps. A riveting story. 4:3 but doesn't detract from the story. Have been looking for this for years. So Glad they finally released it. Richards best work. Thanks. God bless Israel.,1304121600,96,254,4.795454545454546
4397042,5,B004KL0OVU,"This is a very interesting story, with a sad ending.  It is amazing what people can do in times of trials.  Wallenberg put his life on the line many times to successfully save hundreds of Jews during WWII.  This story takes place in Hungary.  There is very little information on what occurred there, so this filled in many gaps concerning the Jewish Holocaust that took place in many countries in Europe and the Balkans.  For someone interested in the truth about what the Germans did in WWII, this will certainly show you a very different side to what is usually portrayed in films on WWII.  I highly recommend this film.",1500508800,2,622,4.609090909090909

4397065,4,B004KL0OVU,Richard Chamberlain is fabulous in this film..the film score is a bit mediocre however...but the film was very haunting ..it is never pleasant to see the handiwork of Nazi Germany...this film concentrates on Wallenberg' courageous attempt to save Jews who are doomed to death by making them Swedish citizens and protecting them in certain housing that he had  allotted for the Jews in Budapest..,1464134400,5,395,5.171875

4397080,5,B004KL0OVU,"Richard Chamberlain could not have been better, in the lead role of Raoul Wallenberg. The supporting cast is A-One, throughout. I
recommend this film whole-heartedly!. The smallest roles are very well-done and the director and his great cast transported me to another time...a very tragic time in which decent people were treated with complete disdain. Wallenberg, like Oskar Schindler, is as real to me
as if I had known him well. This film is uplifting, due to the devotion and commitment of its lead character, and, those persons who stood
by him in his great humanitarian effort on behalf of those who had been scapegoated.",1440892800,2,627,4.980952380952381

4397105,5,B004KL0OVU,"Tense and thrilling biopic of a true humanitarian who did so much to help the Jews of Hungary toward the end of World War II.  The movie picks up Wallenberg's life in his early 30's when he is recruited for ""diplomatic"" work in Hungary in 1944, and shows his great efforts in providing aid and shelter for the Hungarian Jews despite the opposition of the German military machine and their Hungarian Nazi allies, the Arrow Cross. His bravery and boldness, though often a bit of a bluff, carried the day on many occasions.  One cannot help but admire his bravado and applaud his many victories, small and large, in his efforts.  This piece of history needs as widespread telling as possible.  The film is excellent, and I thoroughly enjoyed it.",1417046400,,742,4.684615384615385
4397106,5,B004KL0OVU,I first saw this story on tv years ago.  I was impressed with Raul's decision to help the Jews even at the risk of losing his own life.

Wallenberg was a true hero in helping saving millions of lives. This
kind of history isn't being taught in most schools anymore maybe
parents should start teaching their kids the true meaning of freedom!

4397117,5,B004KL0OVU,"This representation of the unbelievable Raoul Wallenberg, a Swedish diplomat who rescued thousands of Jews in Budapest, Hungry by nothing more than boldness, intellect, and bravery in the face of Nazi criminals carrying out the orders of Adolf Eichmann,is a must-see.  His fate was heart-wrenching and frustrating to anyone who feels heroes should be saved.  This is a man all humans should know about.",1389484800,2,402,5.265625
4397118,5,B004KL0OVU,"I was stunned to learn of the contribution Raoul Wallenberg had made in saving likely hundreds of thousands of lives toward the end of WWII, both through his political action, and in personally jumping into the freezing Danube in the middle of the night countless times to pull out people who had been tied together and thrown into the river to drown by Hungary's own version of the Nazi's, the Arrow Cross.  His influence was both through high level diplomacy, and personal, as above, or in jumping right into Nazi box cars to physically pull people off the trains bound directly for Nazi death camps.  Why didn't the world do a great deal more to put the Soviet feet to the fire & insist on the release of Raoul Wallenberg from the terrible Soviet Gulag system, where it seems he was incarcerated for decades.  After selflessly saving so many lives, it seems he was forgotten in that most desolate wasteland, having been illegally incarcerated by the Soviets in the first place.",1386979200,4,980,4.719298245614035

4397122,4,B004KL0OVU,"This is basically a good synopsis of the Roul Walllenberg story, although there is the inevitble Hollywood dramatization.  For those interested in history, it's another reminder of the tragedy that befell the Jews in Europe at the hands of the Nazis, but it does also point out that there were at least some individuals who did what they could to save their fellow human beings, at no small risk to their own safety.",1378425600,3,416,4.698630136986301

4397141,4,B004KL0OVU,Wallenberg was a diplomat that provided fake papers (at great peril to himself) to people desperate to escape from Nazi death camps.  He survived the Nazis only to disappear behind the Iron Curtain as the USSR over-ran Eastern Europe.  Poor Wallenburg...Nasty Russians!,1358553600,,269,5.380952380952381
4397142,5,B004KL0OVU,I thought that this movie was well done. Wallenberg's motivations were not deeply explored but his actions during this period were well documented.,1358035200,,147,5.434782608695652
4397143,4,B004KL0OVU,"Nothing as dynamic as a True Story.  Chamberlain did an excellent job of portrayal of this hero.  However, there was a Swedish version , around 1970 (with English subtitles) called Good Evening Mr. Wallenberg.  Chamberlain's version doesn't show as much of the carnage as the Swedish version, and there's more emphasis on his love life with the married woman vs. the Swedish version showing Wallenberg defying the Swedish dignitaries telling him to return to Sweden and give up his efforts and Wallenberg refusing to bend to their demands.  In this respect, I think the Swedish version tells us more of what drove this man, the brutality of what he witnessed,and why he refused to give up.",1356220800,4,689,4.913793103448276

Raoul Wallenberg is credited with saving near 100,000 Hungarian Jews. At the peril of his life he defied the Nazis innumerable times. Read a summary of Wallenberg's unbelievable courage to save Hungarian Jews on Google: ""Profile of a Leader: The Wallenberg Effect."" See Wallenberg's complete story in the book ""Righteous Gentile"" available used from amazon.com from a number of book dealers for one cent plus $3.99 for shipping and handling. EVERY reviewer gave the book 5 stars! Unlike Schindler, Wallenberg had only his humanity and no ulterior motive in saving Jews; and he probably saved more Jews than Schindler.

Few Motion pictures can compare to the book. The motion picture ""Wallenberg: A Hero's Story"" may even be equal to the book ""Righteous Gentile""! Both the book and the movie will lift your very being to heaven. Man at his best is so good, so noble, so Christ like, that we would throw a cover over men and women when they are less. Mankind needs Hero's like Wallenberg to lift and redeem us. It will make anyone a better person to make the book or the motion picture a part of their life.

See all of my Reviews. I write only about books, events, or motion pictures that have changed the course of history or unforgettable books or motion pictures that will totally change peoples lives.

4397148,2,B004KL0OVU,"First off, this was an EMBARRASSING experience. We all agree about Wallenberg's [pronounced VOLLEN-berry] intelligence and amazing heroism. If he didn't he should have won a Nobel Peace Prize. He is a breathtaking inspiration for decent, principalled people everywhere. Let's start our dissection with the script - it is schlocky, dumbed-down, with often inadvertently hilarious [take for example the appallingly humorous rendition of Shtormy VED-derr] sequences. Humor and forced levity are injected at intervals to lighten up the gravity of the genocidal subject matter, but this is inappropriate, because mass murder isn't comical. The characters are very tinker-toy and what they say is mechanical and for the most part unconvincing. The Jewish people are depicted here [just as the Nazis characterized them] as ragtag, sloppy and dirty. Only the Hungarian wasps and S.S. are well dressed. Think of these comments as you revisit the docudrama and you'll see what I'm talking about.

  Now for casting... Wallenberg was wealthy and privileged, but, alas, not handsome. Why cast a pretty boy who has poor acting skills to play a hero? This is not some one who could pull off charm, moral strength, resolve, or intimidation. Shouting at appropriate times doesn't cut it... If you needed a heartthrob, Paul Newman would have been a far better choice. Let's look at the character Fodor: he stands around in many scenes wearing an arrow cross uniform and carrying a rifle. What did he accomplish to move the script along? He never saves or helps anyone.

If the British could bypass their anti-Semitism for a brief moment, maybe they could do justice to this great man, for they are the greatest theatre craftsmen on the planet. The very dry, pale film with Stellan Skarsgard is far more serious and believable than this deplorable kitschwerk.

And if you are curious about what I did after seeing this parody of a moral icon... I threw it directly into the trash.",1327881600,6,1962,5.080745341614906
4397149,5,B004KL0OVU,A must see. As far as I am concerned he is saint WALLENBERG! This is a very emotional and sad story.,1322611200,,100,3.8095238095238093
4397150,5,B004KL0OVU,"My Dad, Gerry Green, wrote the screenplay for ""Wallenberg: A hero's story"". It's a powerfully written drama which accurately depicts how Raoul Wallenberg saved thousands of Jews from the death camps. I would reccomend this DVD for the historical significance in teaching students about the Holocaust.",1321401600,2,300,5.543478260869565
4397151,4,B004KL0OVU,"I had been interested in the Wallenberg story for some time now, however I didn't realize it comes in two separate parts. It is well made and I recommend it !",1318809600,3,158,4.129032258064516
4397152,5,B004KL0OVU,"After reading several books on Wallenberg, I was happy to see how detailed and true the movie was to fact.
It was gripping - Richard Chamberlain did this Hero a service by playing the role in a spectacular manner.  Again, it was a movie that showed the viewer deep into the hearts of many and showed us the true nature of how, as a species, we can be more connected than separated.",1318032000,2,381,4.291666666666667
4397153,5,B004KL0OVU,This is a great historical movie.  The characters move right along and even though I knew the end of the story it was still disturbing as the reality of Wallenberg's plight really set in.,1316476800,2,187,4.5
4397154,4,B004KL0OVU,"Raoul Wallenberg is one of my heroes. The film is quite good, although I think it doesn't give a true picture of the extent to which he saved thousands of Jews from the clutches of Eichmann and his trains. The ""Hollywood"" additions also distracted from the truth now and then but I'm glad I purchased it. I'm also glad to have some historically accurate books to read about ""the Swede.""",1315526400,4,386,4.5285714285714285
4397155,5,B004KL0OVU,Impressive film ! It's about rescuing Jews from the prison which was Budapest in the second world war. Unbelievable that no one knows what happened to Wallenberg after the world war. Perhaps the archives of Russia that are closed until now will reveal the truth.,1313884800,2,262,4.844444444444444
4397156,5,B004KL0OVU,I was absolutely spellbound by this flm when I first saw it in the 1980s and have always been bewildered that it took so long to be released to DVD.

Such a compelling story!!!,1311984000,12,320,4.578947368421052
4397157,5,B004KL0OVU,"For the DVD, I have sought this movie since NBC first broadcast in in 1985. Glad to finally have it.

film! Only one complaint I have is that it is not the whole
movie; 187 minutes. I am glad I taped in SP mode and transferred
to DVD when the film was on the old 'True TV' network in 2 parts
which added up to 202 minutes. Sometimes I don't understand why
studios can't release an entire film!.

4397159,5,B004KL0OVU,"In spite of it's made for TV quality and some historical inaccuracies, this film is welcome and long overdue as a DVD, hopefully will increase awareness of this wonderful man Raoul Wallenberg. The film, Good Evening Mr. Wallenberg, is much more realistic, but in the end not as interesting as this one. Richard Chamberlain nails the character and spirit of Wallenberg, who is one of the dozens of Angels of World War II, who did all he could literally to save as many Jews in Hungary as possible as the war came to its conclusion. Everyone aware of this time knows that Hungary became a catchment for Jews fleeing other locations, and the Nazi's caught them in Spring and Summer 1944, when for all intents the war was over and even Himmler was suing for peace, but the Nazi Death Machine, aided by Adolph Eichmann and the Hungarian Fascist Arrow Cross, managed to slaughter over 450,000. Wallenberg managed to save near 100,000 and while the sentiment to save 1 life is to save the world, he deserves the world's memory and gratitude for the energy and devotion to his cause that it took to accomplish such a feat. He should be viewed in contrast and comparison to Angels like Oskar Schindler, Chiune Sugihara and the trio who saved tens of thousands of Chinese during the so called ""Rape of Nanking"", Nazi (not deeply committed) John Rabe and Americans Robert Wilson and Minnie Vautrin. In January 1945, Wallenberg was seized by the Soviets and sent off to the Gulag where he was said to have died in 1947, but eyewitnesses attest to seeing him as late as 1975 or even 1980.
  Though the ""romance"" between Wallenberg and Lisl Kemeny was probably overstated, those of us who consider Wallenberg one of the greatest of the 20th century may find some comfort in the thought that someone cared for him as Lisl Kemeny did in the film. Kemeny appears in person in the VHS documentary Wallenberg: Between The lines, and makes it clear that though she admired Wallenberg, she was not romantically interested because among other things, her husband was so much more handsome. Ok!!
  Wallenberg would be 100 next year and it would be fitting to show this film again for his Centenary.",1308614400,180,2175,4.700787401574803
4397160,5,B004KL0OVU,"I am watching this movie while I even type this. For a few years, I was aware of who Raoul Wallenberg was, a Swedish secretary with the Swedish embassy in Hungary during World War Two, saving thousands of Jews from the last Nazi-dominated country to start up deportations of their Jewish population in early to late 1944. Sadly, he was arrested, thrown into prison, and died in captivity by the RUSSIANS of all people! The Russians, despite his protective status as a Swedish diplomat, accused him as a spy and had him killed. But I NEVER was made aware that a movie was made about Wallenberg in his honor! This movie came out when I was born, but it might as well be a brand-new movie anyway, which I rate at five stars. The movie goes a lot into the discussion of how Hungary's leader, Admiral Horthy, would purposely suspend deportations of Jews by the thousands despite the growing demands from Nazi Germany and Colonel Eichmann of the SS to deport the 250,000 remaining Jews in the Budapest area alone, and how Wallenberg would risk a lot for his own safety to save as many of the Jews as he could by employing them at the Swedish embassy and making safe houses that would fly the Swedish flag. This movie is completely excellent, all 3 hours of it, and is well worth the money spent and the time used in watching it.

Wallenberg was the greatest civilian hero of the Second World War and saved more lives than anyone else behind enemy lines.
