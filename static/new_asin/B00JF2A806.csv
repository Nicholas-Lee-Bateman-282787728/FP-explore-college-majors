6356302,3,B00JF2A806,"I heard good reviews about the movie. The acting is good.  It is a different kind of Hindi movie. Has a different style from the others I have seen.  Just a little slow in some parts. But like I said, it is different.  I still recomend it.",1417651200,,239,4.042553191489362
6356303,5,B00JF2A806,"great film
love the characters
well acted
good music
good plot and underlying themes

only real negative to me and maybe what others would say is that the movie is quite long, this can both be good or bad but i do feel it adds to the character development and their arcs.",1415318400,,271,4.211538461538462
6356304,4,B00JF2A806,Somewhat typical Bollywood movie but is greatly enhanced by photography of landscapes and roads of north India.,1414108800,,111,5.588235294117647
6356305,5,B00JF2A806,"The first time I watched Highway was without subtitles. Not that my Hindi is that good  far from it. I could only understand bits and pieces of what they said. But what a great film to just watch. Its a whole different viewing experience. Its said the majority of communication doesnt come from the words themselves, but from body language and tone, and this film is full of that.

It is very well acted and expressive. If anyone said Randeep Hoodas Mahabir spends most of the film just glowering, Id say theres a whole lot they're missing. His intensity is magnificent, but his expression changes over time. It felt very natural to map his character development and feelings toward Veera by his expressions and tone, shifts his words may not have matched, since people often seek to hide feelings with their words, rather than reveal them.

Alia Bhatt also did a great job with Veera, going naturally between a young girl, full of zest for life, and the vacant expression that came when she remembered episodes from the past.

A plot summary I saw when I was looking for the movie described her character as experiencing Stockholm syndrome, but I think that misses the mark. Having been locked away all her life to keep her safe, told to be careful, and hushing up her hurts, its conversely the danger of this initially horrifying situation that unlocks the door and allows her to be free. Finally, she can see the world around her without all the buffers...smell the fresh air, touch the dust, stay in places that aren't all identical and sanitised.

Bond-with-the-kidnapper plots don't usually work for me, but in this story, considering the pasts of the main characters as they're unfolded, it makes sense, particularly in light of who they become together. Looking backward to the Mahabharata, like Ambika she is abducted but, even more so, like Shakuntala she chooses her man of her own free will. There comes a point at which something in Veera has chosen Mahabir and treats him with complete candor and trust. She is most fully herself with him, and he knows almost without being told what she needs. He loves her perhaps without knowing he does, until she returns to him.

Its emotionally engaging, well filmed, and well acted. Good soundtrack. I think its rated PG, and thats mostly true, but the early abduction scenes can be disturbing, as can Veeras discussion of past events. So probably ages 11 or 12 and up would be okay, depending on the person.

Having watched it now with subtitles, I give it 5 stars. I loved this movie.",1409788800,,2540,4.733031674208145
6356306,5,B00JF2A806,"Great story, good locations. I'm in love with Imtiaz films, he has this unique form to exposure the story world of the character in a simple way that makes you feel like one of them. Obviously you know how our hero is going to end but have the hope high. Alia Batt performance is amazing and Hooda is more than spectacular, he speaks without saying a world, great direction from Imtiaz!! I feel the freedom of her and the imprisonment of him. Great movie, different from Bollywood! And of course amazing music from A R Rahman.",1404604800,,526,4.489583333333333
6356307,4,B00JF2A806,"This is one the best Indian films I've seen in some time.  The performances are stronge and the pace far better than in your standard, often quite wonderful, Bollywood fare.  Worth watching for both those who love Indian cinema and those looking for something just a bit different to watch on a Saturday night.",1404345600,,310,4.722222222222222
6356308,5,B00JF2A806,"I got totally sucked into this film. The acting was brilliant. After watching it, it haunted me (in a good way!) for many days. It touched my heart. Alia Bhatt...wow, her performance was amazing!

Before I watched this film, I had not noticed Randeep Hooda. Now I will be eagerly awaiting his next film! He is an incredible actor!

I found it interesting how the Indian upper class was portrayed. I understand that it was only a simple view/perspective, but it definitely made me think!

This is a film about a girl's transformation. It is riveting.

Please watch this film!  =)",1402012800,2,578,4.683168316831683
6356309,3,B00JF2A806,"Highway as it sounds is about a road trip through the northern part of India as it explores the divide between the rich and poor, dreams and reality, freedom and imprisonment,. Picture perfect locations and rural landscapes dominate the movie and take center stage but the movie is about a runaway couple who are doomed ultimately but united by tragedies in their past. Highway is about the past, search for self, finding a meaning to life, love - even though it is ultimately fatal.
About to be married, Veera Tripathi sneaks out of her dwelling to seek some fresh air with her reluctant fiancee only to be abducted by gang of four. Learning that Veeras father is a renowned tycoon, the gang members order Mahabir ( Randeep Hooda) to release her. However the bullheaded Mahabir, decides to go on the run instead, and plans to sell Veera to a brothel.
Veeras shock and fear has been well captured and the young Alia manages to engage us in her world. She tries to escape in the middle of nowhere only to realise that she is in the middle of nowhere and reluctantly embraces the gang. To avoid the manhunt for Veera, they take a road trip and gradually Veera falls in love with the gang and the gangster ( Stockholm Syndrome) and a deep affection develops between Mahabir and Veera. A romance which not only is doomed but also the lacks of  chemistry to tug at the heart.
This is a bollywood movie and there are numerous songs but none of them in their entirety, only snippets appear at regular intervals. AR Rahman gives us a very melodious score, I loved Maahi Ve.
Alia Bhatt shines in the final scenes with revelations and a haunted past that will tug on many hearts. A good effort but a journey marred by many potholes. Three stars",1399507200,3,1734,4.539936102236422

8650414,1,B00JF2A806,"A totally irresponsible storyline of the well known Stockholm syndrome where the kidnapped begins to identify with the kidnappers and even joins in their criminal activities. The kidnappers were even willing to shoot at innocent quick gas/shop convenience store customers and workers in this scenario. The sad part of this story is that the writer/director has no concept of what almost always happens in reality with this event. 95+% of the time the kidnapped is either dead or psychological traumatized or forever isolated from family. This film romanticized such an event. Even filming in beautiful landscapes to make it seem fairytale like. And, sadly film can be a motivator for some. Seems like this writer/director is in it for the money no matter the consequences.",1499817600,,772,5.184
