3850715,5,B00263ZHWU,"This was my first workout DVD by Amy Bento.  I only got it a few weeks ago but I really like it, it has very challenging combos & good music.  It's a little long, I usually do it for about an hour and it really gets my heart pumping.  I will for sure purchase other dvd's from her.",1225756800,,281,3.810344827586207
3850716,5,B00263ZHWU,"Amy delivers again!! She's such a class act!! I just love, Love, LOVE her step workouts!!! This is another fun, full wattage, high energy, sweatfest!! Anybody who knows Amy's step knows that when she says advanced she means it. Her choreography is again so much fun and very creative and complex (somewhat less complex than Advanced Step Challenge 2 though). And, I LOVE that she always puts great, funkin, driving music to it that just drives you to keep going. It's also high energy and will make you sweat. I also love that she always puts in a low impact modifier (Toni, I believe) for anybody who has to protect their knees or needs to keep it low key. Sometime's I need to have a low impact option for a move so it's great to see that there are other options for a move to take it down a notch. I love the length of it so I have the option for a longer or shorter workout. You need to be patient learning Amy's step and I preview, preview, preview to learn it before I attempt it. I find that when I finally breakdown the code to her step patterning by watching it, then doing it comes much more smoothly. I find this is the best approach for me. But when I love something so much I'm willing to take the extra time to learn it. And find that it's such an accomplishment!! Being able to master Amy's step feels like I've hit the BIG TIMES!! I love that she's included premixes and stretching and abs. However, I kind of secretly wished that she had snuck in some circuit weight premixes like she did on ASC2 using Slo-Mo (that was AWESOME and incredibly giving of her -- she even put almost all of her Slo-Mo after the credits too -- didn't I tell you she's a class act!). It would have been amazing if she had done some circuit premixes using All Pump Xtreme. That would have been awesome!! For all who can handle complex, UNBELIEVABLY FUN, high energy step and the learning curve that goes with it, get this workout, you won't regret it!!",1223424000,22,1946,4.3342465753424655
3850717,2,B00263ZHWU,"I have been stepping for 20 + years and I am an
advanced stepper.  This is without a doubt the most confusing step routine I have ever tried.  It is so frustrating trying to follow.....break downs are too few and not easy to follow.",1392681600,2,232,4.25
3850718,5,B00263ZHWU,Exactly as advertised.  Amy breaks down the workouts and also has a section for learning the moves.  It's a Great workout!,1392336000,,122,4.761904761904762
3850719,3,B00263ZHWU,This is really challenging workout. Its fast paced and definitely not for the beginner. I've done step for a while but found this difficult to keep up with and think it will take me many goes at getting down pat.,1386028800,,212,4.325
3850720,5,B00263ZHWU,I would buy all Amy Bento workouts. It is like having a trainer in your living room. No other STEP DVD like it.,1363910400,,111,3.869565217391304
3850721,1,B00263ZHWU,"I have spent countless hours doing advanced step aerobics in multiple gyms, including double-step (where you share your step with others) and rarely had any problem following.

For those who aren't aware, step is designed for a high aerobic, LOW impact workout.  However, high impact jumping on and off the bench are a theme in this workout(including standard jumping jacks).  Most of the routines include high impact steps with no simple way to modify them to be low impact.

I bought this because I really enjoy complicated routines however very little cueing is offered, and when it is it's too late to be of any real value. The ""warm-up"" was a few minutes of aerobics (including jumping jacks) then right into stretching.  After the stretching the instructor goes right into the aerobics again.  For me it was not an adequate warm-up, especially for what is a high impact workout.

Sadly disappointed by this since the reviews were so high for this item.",1358553600,12,958,4.8765432098765435
3850722,5,B00263ZHWU,I am a advanced stepper and this DVD is Amazing!  I want to find more from instructor Amy Bento! she must have another video if not she should,1357776000,,142,4.071428571428571
3850723,5,B00263ZHWU,"I have worked out regularly for 17 years, I am 40 and have had people over the years ask me if I do Fitness Competitions, so I am in shape and I found this an awesome routine for those winter days when its 5 degrees and too cold to run outside.",1357257600,,244,3.803921568627451
3850724,3,B00263ZHWU,"As a former step aerobics instructor and current step class enthusiast, I must say that this video is not for the feint of heart. I attend step classes regularly and found the choreography complicated. THIS VIDEO IS NOT FOR BEGINNERS!!!

Amy Bento incorporates a lot of combinations in her routines, but doesn't give you much time to get it down before moving on to the next challenging combo. You definitely get a good cardio workout once you learn the steps. I highly recommend that you watch the video completely before trying it out.",1353456000,,537,4.774193548387097
3850725,5,B00263ZHWU,One of my favorite work outs by Amy bento.  Great step routines always keeps you on your toes and fun too!,1352505600,,106,4.0476190476190474
3850726,4,B00263ZHWU,"This is my first Amy Bento so I know it takes a bit to get used to the instructors Qs. She is a bit difficult to follow at times. It is helpful if you are given a bit more left/right when one first starts out in order to focus on their footings and the step. Amy does not do that. She doesn't even do that in her demo section. I have done the workout 2 days in a row and I am coming along. I had to watch the demo section and do parts of the w/o in slow mo. I am confident that with a bit of coaching from the good ol' hubby I will have this down in no time. That said. This is great. It is not super repetitive like many,the music isn't loud and cheesy, and it is quite fun.",1349827200,,675,3.6944444444444446
3850727,3,B00263ZHWU,"I couldn't say how many 100's of hours I have logged in step aerobics, and yet the routines in this video are still too complicated.  She starts out right out of the gate in multi-step routines I've never heard of with no introduction and no training.  Yes, there is a section of the video where you can ""preview"" some of the steps, but not all of them.  If you catch on to dance routines quickly, this may be right for you, and it looks like it would probably be fun if it hadn't left me staring at the tv thinking, ""Um.  What?""  Big disappointment.  I wish I'd spent my workout dollars (and time) on something else.",1347235200,4,617,4.275862068965517
3850728,5,B00263ZHWU,"I really recommend this workout. Amy does an excellent job. I like the fact that you can choose the workout you want. It is divided in different time periods. So, if you want to work out for 30 minutes you can do it. Or, if you are an expert and have endurance, you can do the 120 min long workout.",1335744000,,298,3.9833333333333334
3850729,5,B00263ZHWU,This is by far one of the best exercise DVD's I have purchased.  Amy Bento is an excellent instructor and her choreography is fun.  The steps can be difficult to learn at first but if you go chapter by chapter and learn each one individually you will get it down pat in no time.,1335398400,,278,4.12962962962963
3850730,5,B00263ZHWU,"I searched high and low for a good step DVD for an advanced stepper like myself.  I found this one challenging yet doable.  After learning the routine I play one of the premixes to skip the ""learning"" portions of the routine and jump directly into the broken down combos.  Since the cardio portion of that routine is only about 30 minutes I end up doing that twice for a good work out.  I have her #2 and #4 DVDs but I find myself going back to this one the most.",1329523200,,463,4.111111111111111
3850731,3,B00263ZHWU,"This is a great cardio workout.  The thing I like about step is that it isn't mindless.  You have to think.  This dvd has some difficult choreography.  I can usually pick things up during the workout, but I had to stop it and go to the tutorial, and even then it was difficult to follow.  However, I got it enough to do the workout, for the most part. During the tutorial, there is no music, and we don't see it with the steps before and after.  It would be helpful to have some elements of the tutorial IN  the routine, where we could perhaps do it half time, but with the music.  I find that this is the easiest way for me to pick up new steps.  The difficulty of the steps would still rate five stars.  The problem I have is in the instruction.  Amy and her crew know the routine cold, and I think she assumes that we'll get it AND remember each step much more quickly than is possible.  Too often she calls steps as they are happening, rather than just before they happen, and she frequently doesn't call a step, assuming (I guess) that we'll remember.  For me, step needs to be both challenging AND well-called.  In this dvd, we have one, but not the other.",1328140800,9,1162,4.222727272727273
3850732,4,B00263ZHWU,I purchased this video for my wife and she says this exercisee video is a good workout that gets your heart pumping and elevates your energy level.,1327190400,,147,4.481481481481482
3850733,5,B00263ZHWU,"Nothing could ever be as fun as step if you have a good teacher and great music! Unfortunately, they have phased step almost completely out of the gyms where I live and I have had to resort to buying tapes and DVD's I can do at home.  This one is really good, and yes, it is hard but once you learn the moves you have a great sense of accomplishment.  Additionally, there are six different selections to choose from if you get bored. The music is pretty good and I am really picky about music.  I like edgy more dance or techno tracks for working out and this doesn't make me want to turn the DVD off. Overall, I am very satisfied, but I'll never stop hoping they bring step back to the mainstream.",1322870400,2,698,4.1940298507462686
3850734,5,B00263ZHWU,"Great workout! I love the preview moves, it helps a lot. The warm up could have been better but I have another video of hers and that has a good warm up so I use that one. It has two(2)15 minute Ab workouts which I enjoy. If you like step work outs this one is great. Amy Bento's #2 video is just as good too.",1313884800,,309,3.769230769230769
3850735,2,B00263ZHWU,"Was very excited to get this DVD, until I tried it....I have been doing advanced step aerobics for 20+ years and I was totally lost in this!!!!  A few of the moves were broken down, but there were many more that should have been explained in much more detail.",1313366400,13,259,4.285714285714286
3850736,5,B00263ZHWU,"Amy goes through each combo several times so you really get a chance to get the hang of it.  I just fudge it until I get the moves down which is a source of much entertainment for my husband who loves to watch me fumble around!  It isn't so hard it's impossible, but you definitely have to be an experienced stepper and in excellent shape to do this workout.",1312070400,,358,4.173913043478261
3850737,1,B00263ZHWU,"There needs to be a bigger warning sign somewhere on this stating..ADVANCED ADVANCED ADVANCED step exercise.  I workout everyday so I'm in really good shape.  When I got this in the mail I couldn't wait to throw it in my Xbox and get my workout on.  I had to turn it off after the first 15 minutes.  Amy didn't explain one move!  She just started in..did the step once or twice and moved on to the next one. I usually don't give up on workouts but there was no way that I could call what I was doing a workout.  I actually stopped and found that just watching it was a challenge in itself.  The CD seems a bit outdated since they outfits are from the early 90's or 80's.
I would not recommend this CD unless you're a step trainer at your local gym.",1301356800,4,748,4.117241379310345
3850738,5,B00263ZHWU,"Another fun step workout from Amy.  Great music, fun moves, what more can you want from a workout?  For advanced or intermediate fitness levels.  It takes a few times to get the moves down but once down, the workout is so much fun!",1298678400,,231,4.325581395348837
3850739,5,B00263ZHWU,"As a long long time home video junkie, I am always looking for a new exciting challenge. Amy's video certainly is that. Her energy is unbelievable and I am more than jealous of her stamina and endurance. It is nice to be challenged not just by the intensity but also by the moves, but perhaps with a bit too much challenge on the moves. My main complaint in this video is the poor step training preview to the moves. This is the first video I have ever had to try to train myself on the moves after failing miserably the first run through. I am still struggling in keeping up and often get too frustrated when I can't get the moves down, though I have only tried twice now. If I ever do learn the moves, I will feel very accomplished. This video is only for the very  coordinated and advanced stepper.",1296604800,,801,4.269736842105263
3850740,5,B00263ZHWU,This is a GREAT! Workout video. It take a little time to learn the step routines... but once learned it's all good!,1296518400,,115,4.2727272727272725
3850741,4,B00263ZHWU,"I love the instructor's enthusiasm and creativity, but I find this step program difficult to keep up with and difficult to learn even with the tutorial.  I would have preferred something less complicated. I don't like a lot of turning, it makes me dizzy.  It's a good way to trip.  I still use it, but I don't follow them exactly.",1291766400,,330,4.466666666666667
3850742,5,B00263ZHWU,"She's very good - enthusiastic and likeable.  Music has a good beat too.  Took me while to get the moves (I still can't do the reverse stomp, double stomp or whatever) - I'm very uncoordinated - that's why I do step at home and not at the gym :)  I skip the power-ups - I'm 42 - are you kidding?  Don't have that much energy.  Highly recommend.",1279670400,7,344,4.074626865671642
3850743,5,B00263ZHWU,"It had been a while since I had taken a step class but I wanted to get back into it. I purchased another step dvd but it was too basic and I quickly got bored of it. I decided to try Amy's workout and I'm glad I did. What a great workout! It took me a while to learn the routine. Even after going through the previews, I still had to pause and rewind over and over again. But my persistance paid off. It is so much fun! She has five different routines and several mixes, so you'll never get bored. If you already know the basics, you should be able to catch on pretty quickly.",1270080000,5,576,3.9741379310344827
3850744,4,B00263ZHWU,"Amy Bento is my favorite fitness instructor for home workouts. I don't like this workout as much as ASC1, but it's good. I feel the choreography is more difficult to learn which is OK with patience. I wish it was slightly simpler on combo 2 is all. I do recommend it to people who like challenging choreography, and the premixes are nice to have for variety and workout length. I wish this feature was available in ASC1.",1263254400,,420,4.467532467532467
3850745,5,B00263ZHWU,"This is a review I posted in February 2009 (this product is listed in two places on Amazon):  ""Nothing compares to Amy; I love this challenge as much as I love ASC1 and ASC2. I was a little frustrated when I first attempted it, because I had trouble with the box turn in combo 2; I'm glad I kept at it because this workout makes me feel fantastic. This is especially true during those times when I've fallen off my diet plan; ASC3 is a super calorie burner. I was doing this twice a week, but I'm adding some new Patrick G. videos for variety, until Amy hopefully finishes ASC4. This is definitely an advanced workout and one that stays in my rotation.""  I still love this workout; I feel even better doing it since I started using kettlebells this year as my primary method of strength training.  It makes my step routines fly by!  Amy indicates she won't be completing ASC4 until next year, but this video has tremendous staying power.",1245715200,4,937,4.430232558139535

8351786,4,B00263ZHWU,"Take this with a grain of sand; since hitting my mid-30's I begun to ""work out."" Previously relied on youth and perhaps my diet of drinking and smoking to maintain a low weight. Oh and this disclosure: uncoordinated. I can ride a bike but I'm miserable skateboarding (therefore not even trying surfing or snowboarding or skiing). Oh and: I was perhaps overconfident that I could tackle ""advanced"" right off the bat.

Now to the video. Great energy, and personality. I jumped right into the workouts and went ""oh $*!^"" then tried the tutorials. Then went back on-line and found an ""absolute beginners.""

I am on a quest to be good enough for Amy Bento's ""Advanced Step Challenge 3.""

And for anyone else who is slightly damaged from those 1980's buns of steel video covers and all the childish mocking of them with the neighbor boys and therefore too cool to do something so lame, get over it. I don't know why the marketers make it so gratuitously obvious that it's a work out tape (about as obvious as those crazy oversized adult videos that screamed ""hey I'm buying porn""). Or why they try to pose up the talent as ""here's my body, is that enough proof I'm an expert."" Alternative suggestions...I don't know. There's got to be a genius in the marketing of one of the companies. I don't know, maybe they have their hands full with obtaining music and permissions and what not.
