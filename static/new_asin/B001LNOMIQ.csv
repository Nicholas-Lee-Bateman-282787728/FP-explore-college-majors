3688314,1,B001LNOMIQ,"I recently purchased Sandokan Pirate of Malaysia, The Executioner of Venice , and  Lion of St Mark.  Stay Away From These Titles from Sinister Cinema!  First of all the movie prints are of such bad quality you can barely watch them!  The colors are faded, and dark, which means the original print must've been pretty bad to begin with .  All three of these movies have been reviewed by one reviewer, Paul Scott , who gave 4 out of 5 stars for each movie.  After seeing how truly awful these movies are ,one has to wonder how unbiased Mr. Scott's reviews are?  Hopefully Amazon will have their movie review staff rereview the brand of movies being offered by Sinister Cinema, and check these movies out with unbiased reviews .  The movie copies look like they've been recorded by some cheap home processing as the menus were done from a person using a home dvd recorder .  Very tacky!!  Buyers Beware!!!! I feel like I've been ripped off, and you will too!",1295740800,4,955,4.5321637426900585
3688315,4,B001LNOMIQ,"Good Quality print from Sinister Cinema . Only FULL SCREEN though.

It was originally in Widescreen.
 But better than nothing.  Recommended.",1255305600,9,140,5.571428571428571

8319223,3,B001LNOMIQ,good action  picture but most of the picture is in the darkness. Reviewers i read are divided between this comment and those who claim great quality. The movie looks like it was fimed all at night without the benefit of lighting,1486944000,,228,4.560975609756097
8319224,5,B001LNOMIQ,"Any Steve Reeves film is always welcome for his good looks and beautiful physique.  The movies are usually very entertaining too.  This one doesn't disappoint.  A sequel to Sandokan the Great, this also is based in Malaysia.  It was filmed there too, with locals filling in as extras and the scenery is beautiful.  Again, in the late 1800's, Sandokan is battling the occupying British who are acting like all-out Nazis.  Absolutely hissable.  I ordered a DVD-R (pictured below) and the quality is perfect.  The picture is clear and the color is gorgeous.  Highly recommended.",1443312000,,575,5.031914893617022
8319225,5,B001LNOMIQ,The quality was good for its time.  I just love Steve Reeves.,1436572800,,61,4.083333333333333
8319226,4,B001LNOMIQ,"If it wasn't for the beginning credits & song skipping wildly I would have 5 stared this D.V.D.-r burn!  As it worked out the minute the film starts the skipping quit & everything played perfectly from then on! I don't no if this is anamorphic widescreen or pan & scanned, but I have never seen this rare film until now. There are no black bars indicative of widescreen though. There are scenes in the movie that are rather dark but I believe it was filmed this way. The sound & color are crisp & clear. I believe this is the second installment or Sandokan sequel. I think it is just as good as ""Sandokan the Great"", full of the same exotic flora & fauna of Malaysia, & has everything a good action adventure needs.  I find this film & its predecessor great fun & unique period pieces & a must have for Steve Reeves fans!  Even if your not a Steve Reeves fan this is a great way to spend a rainy afternoon for father & son or the whole family for that matter. This is the case for most all of Steve's movies, even on their limited budget the succeed in entertaining & for me that's what defines a good movie.  This covers a time in history when Spain, Britain & France were in a race to grab up as much land & resources as possible usurping many cultures behind in technology!  This is a rare film so if your a fan of period pieces, Pirates that do most of their fighting on land & Steve Reeves you should snatch this one up while its around!",1416873600,,1442,4.191335740072202
8319227,5,B001LNOMIQ,"Excellent. Arrived as promised, in tact, very well packaged. God bless you and thank you very much for the great work.

8319228,1,B001LNOMIQ,"This shipwreck might be a pretty good movie, especially for Steve Reeves fans, but the viewing quality of this version makes it unwatchable. Dark, dreary, invisible. I ""watched"" it all the way through and could not tell you for the world what it was about. Just human-shaped silhouettes scrabbling around in the dark. The sound is nearly as bad. Don't buy this brand (Sinister Cinema)! It's so awful, I won't even let it share shelf space with my other classic DVDs. I stuck it someplace where I'm not apt to run across it, don't even remember where. I've never treated a nostalgic old movie that way before.",1384819200,3,608,4.691588785046729
8319229,5,B001LNOMIQ,I have to disagree with those who say this copy of the film is poor.  My Sinister Cinema copy is top quality with clear visuals and sound.  It is a bit dark in places but that's more to do with the original photography than the quality of the DVD.  I am very happy with my DVD.,1317859200,5,277,3.9107142857142856
8319230,2,B001LNOMIQ,This would be a good dvd except for the viewing quality. Quality is very bad. The people who manufactured this dvd need to check the quality of their products before offering them for sale. The dvd was very hard to view because of the quality. For this reason the dvd was very disappointing.,1300233600,5,291,4.509433962264151
8319231,2,B001LNOMIQ,"Sandokan, Pirate of Malaysia was one of Reeves later movies. His build wasn't as massive as it was in his earlier films, but he still looked like a Greek god. Reeves was trying to branch out into adventure films, and turned in a good workman-like performance as Sandokin. These movies were mostly made in Europe and with next to nothing budgets. It's a shame that Reeves was never really given the chance to develop into the star he could have been. He had the drive and charisma, but never realized his potential. Still, he inspired a generation of youngsters to live clean and lift weights. This movie is for Reeves fans only. Sinister Cinema, from whom this purchase was made, is a great place to find old, hard to find videos.",1297296000,2,730,4.580152671755725
