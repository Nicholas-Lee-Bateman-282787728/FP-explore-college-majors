59501,5,0783230346,"I don't like to give too much of the story away when I tell people about films I've seen or that I really like, and this review won't be an exception. Eastwood is blackmailed into an assasination on a mountain called the Eiger, that's as much of the plot as I think you need know, unless you've seen it of course, in which case you know what will happen. If you haven't seen it then you are missing out. The mountain climbing sequences are fantastic, and I think this story suits Eastwoods direcing style perfectly. It is kind of slow and plods along at times, but I like it that way. The story is textured and the conclusion is pleasing. This is classic Clint Eastwood, that's as much as anyone needs to know really. The special features are pretty poor, no documentary of any value, and it would be nice to hear Clint talk us through his film, you get standard early Universal DVD features instead. The transfer isn't great and the picture is grainy at times, but this is an older film, and I would have liked a remastered soundtrack in 5.1 Dolby digital, but nevermind. I'm contented enough just to have this film on disc. So should you be!",995932800,7,1143,4.421800947867299
59502,3,0783230346,"Based upon the novel of the same name by Trevanian and directed by Clint Eastwood who also stars in it, this is an interesting action film, as most of the relevant action takes place on the Eiger mountain in the Swiss Alps.

The story line is fairly simple. A retired professional assassin and climber turned art collector, played by Eastwood, is suddenly forced out of retirement when he is made an offer he can't refuse. His mission is to kill an unknown double agent who deep sixed a close friend of Eastwood.

Be prepared for total political incorrectness and rampant sexism reminiscent of the early Bond flicks. It is somewhat jarring to see and hear in these politically correct times. When you see the film, you will know what I mean. Notwithstanding this, it is still an entertaining film.

Eastwood's quest for the unknown double agent takes him to the Eiger, where he ultimately makes a life changing decision, as does his friend, played by George Kennedy. This film should appeal to those who enjoy thrillers, buddy films, and action movies. Climbing enthusiasts will also enjoy it for the spectacular mountain footage and gripping climbing scenes.",975110400,,1159,4.903061224489796
59503,5,0783230346,"I guess I ought to be ashamed of how much I enjoy this movie.  But, I am not ashamed, and a really do enjoy this movie.
A relatively young, and  satiny-smooth Eastwood is the killer for hire, who avenges the murder of  U.S. government agents.  He also happens to be a world class mountain  climber and an art expert.  Conned into coming out of retirement, he takes  one last job for $100,000 (and the chance to avenge a friend).  Being  Clint, he kills the bad guys, survives himself when none others could, and  of course gets several girls.
Great cinematography.  The scene where  Eastwood and George Kennedy scale the unconquerable pinnacle is stunning.  One  cannot always tell in that scene what was ""real"" and what  was actually a set up.  The final shot of that portion of the movie, when a  camera obviously set in a helicopter moves away from the height and showing  them sitting (and obviously heavily strapped to the top) is stunning.  Watching the final quarter, shot on a mountainside, makes one actually feel  cold.
The movie is also incredibly sexist.  Having said that, I must  acknowledge that it also has two positively gorgeous women:  Vonnetta McKee  (for some reason given the moniker ""Jemimah Brown"" - spare me!)  and an otherwise unknown Brenda Venus (only named  ""George"").
Not thought provoking, not ""deep"". Just a  good show.",965433600,11,1351,4.786026200873362
59504,5,0783230346,"All right.
With tongue firmly in cheek, let me say that the other reviewers of this movie have got it all wrong.  ""The Eiger Sanction"" has got to be one of the all-time great ""guy""  films (I refer you to the ""Big Damn Book of Sheer Manliness"" here  on Amazon.com for more information on those two).  Yes, for  Saturday-night-with-the-boys viewing, this is one of the classics.  Here  are ten reasons why:
1.  Clint the Glint...need I say more?
2.  Incredibly realistic mountain-climbing footage, from Southern Utah to the  Swiss Alps, all shot on location, with none of the ridiculous fakery found  in farces such as ""Cliffhanger"".
3.  A plot that makes James  Bond seem believable, starting with a combination art expert/mountain  climber/CIA assassin and going forward from there.
4.  Fantastic scenery  shots, including George Kennedy and Clint on top of a sandstone pinnacle  (I'm sure George really climbed it...yeah, right).
5.  A cool resort  compound (actually filmed at the lodge in Zion National Park, Utah).
6.  Well-timed 70s nudity (in other words, totally unnecessary).
7.  An  albino (!) ""establishment"" guy, (CIA leader) and his wonderfully  despicable sidekick, just waiting for Clint to kick around.
8.  Astounding political incorrectness, including a character named  ""Jemimah Brown"", another one known simply as ""Buns"",  and much, much more.
9.  Fantastically quotable manly lines, for example  ""Assassins get assassinated, and that ain't in my game plan"", or  ""There's a twenty on the dresser by the bed"", etc., etc.,  etc.
10.  Clint even glints at a little dog...really!
I could go on and  on.
All kidding aside, I love this movie!  Just don't plan on taking it  too seriously.",953856000,87,1700,5.106227106227106
59505,1,0783230346,"While Clint Eastwood struggles to find cinematic identity in the post Spaghetti Western and pre-Dirty Harry times, the movie goer is  forced to endure a number of incarnations, notably  the Good (Play Misty for Me), the  Bad (Where Eagles Dare), and the Ugly (The Eiger Sanction).
Actually  Dirty Harry had been released before any of these films, but I couldn't  resist.
Another poorly adapted (nee Where Eagles Dare) novel, this film  would serve as only marginal TV-movie fare today. With supporting stars  George Kennedy and Jack Cassidy, this big screen version feels much like a  TV-movie anyway.
Beautiful Swiss landscapes can't prop up a weak  whodunit, diluted even further by time-capsuled character types and sexual  innuendo.
There are probably 40 better Eastwood movies than this one.",949622400,4,797,5.253968253968254

59586,3,0783230346,"Clint Eastwood ruled the '70s box office.  This isn't one of the first Clint Eastwood movie that you think about.  But it would probably be in my top five favorite Eastwood movies.  He plays a retired government assassin.  Who is now a college professor and  art collector.  Called in to do one last job.  He doesn't want to but finally agrees after pretty much not being able to turn down the money.
So his boss who is an albino sends him to Switzerland to join a mountain climbing team.  Knowing that one of the other climbers is the man he is looking for.  But not knowing which one.  George Kennedy plays the ground leader of the team.  He and Eastwood work well together and it is a very good role for him.  Jack Cassidy and his dog also have good roles.  In a role that you hope he gets whats coming too him.
Once they get on the mountain.  There are some very good mountain climbing scenes.  And a storm that they don't know about is coming.  So then it becomes a matter of survival against the mountain and each other.  This is a very good suspenseful, intense movie.",1488585600,,1075,4.321608040201005

Eastwood and Kennedy turned in solid performances, and the art collection that Eastwood's character built up? Yeah, I could believe that that Pissarro alone was enough to tempt a man back into a life of high-stakes wetwork.

That's the good news. Now here's the bad news, along with a quick, spoiler-free summary of the rest of the movie.

Think of the worst Bond movie you've ever seen. Or better yet, put all of your least favorite Bond films in a blender, dollop some of the most self-indulgent and badly researched crap from Ian Fleming's books in as well, then simmer for a couple of hours with characters and lines that are so caricatured, cringeworthy, and largely unnecessary to the story that most hack writers wouldn't touch with a ten-foot pen.

I'm usually a huge fan of Clint Eastwood, and of assassin protagonists and spy-filled plots (yes, the entire James Bond empire of movies and books included, so I know what I'm talking about when I make snarky Ian Fleming comparisons), and I still couldn't find much to like in this movie. If you do decide to sit through this, I suggest watching a Roger Moore movie afterward to cleanse your palate- after watching this, Moonraker starts to look like it deserved eight Oscars.",1467849600,,1347,4.822510822510822

Looooooong before Unforgiven, Million Dollar Baby, or Gran Tourino, Eastwood made a batch of self indulgent flicks to support his own ego back in the seventies, this being one of the most egregious.  The novel upon which it's based was revealed by it's author to be a spoof of James Bond tropes, but instead of doing a wacky send up (Like the ORIGINAL Casino Royale), Eastwood plays it straight... but not really.  What do I mean by that?  The film's tone is so uneven, it makes the Transformer movies look like British-made period drama.  It has no real idea what it wants to be: action, thriller, mystery, comedy? All of the above, but none of the above, all at the same time.  Confused yet?  You will be, if you watch this movie. Where to begin?  How about an African American female character named (no kidding) Jemima Brown? Again, in the source material, this is an in joke, like the Alotta Fagina character in Austin Powers, but Eastwood tries to pull it off seriously.  How about the fact that the movie poster promotes this as a mountain climbing action pic, and yet we don't even get to the freaking mountain until about 75% of the way through the movie's bloated running time?  Or the villain who awkwardly telegraphs at every conceivable moment that he is gay, just in case you forget it?  Or the slapped on solution to the mystery that makes no logical sense, and would have even Scooby Doo shaking his head? (Once again, the novel has this element to make fun of spy thrillers, but Eastwood misses it).  The fact that Eastwood, who was 45 at the time it was made, makes sure to point out to you people watching that he's still a damn sexy man by having every woman in the movie want him, despite his character pretty much being a misogynist prick?  Or how about the fact that George Kennedy is in it?  Ba-doom-CHE!  Rim shot!  Thank you, thank you, I'll be here til Thursday, try the veal...  And I didn't even get to the albino spy master who speaks in a gravelly voice, has white irises (which are totally NOT a thing), and has to live entirely in rooms bathed in harsh red light, because DRAMA!

59708,5,0783230346,"I've seen about 30 Eastwood movies, and this is my favorite. Clint plays an college professor of art who moonlights as an assassin for a secret federal agency. He's also a respected mountain climber.

Like many of his films, it is full of memorable one-liners:

""But as long as we have Dragon and Pope working for us, how bad can the other side be?""
""Here's to the selfish killer and the patriotic whore.""

But it features an equally brilliant performance by George Kennedy, who plays an old friend who used to climb as well. They are perfect together.

The movie also features some excellent commentary on the absurdity of the cold war at the time and how America was adopting tactics that only the ""bad guys"" supposedly engaged on.

Plus, there's a very interesting cast of characters who make the film entertaining. Everyone does a great job. This is certainly a tribute to Eastwood's directing.

It's fun, full of suspense, and possibly the most politically incorrect movie you'll ever watch. It seems more brilliant now than it did the first time I saw it (which was at least 20 years ago).",1457049600,2,1095,4.706806282722513

59716,4,0783230346,"Clint Eastwood both directs and stars in this high-altitude action-thriller.
'Jonathan Hemlock' (Clint Eastwood) a retired professional-killer is now a professor and is a University Lecturer, his hobby
is collecting rare artworks.
Agency-Head ' Dragon' (Thayer David) persuades 'Jonathan' to accept a sanction to kill someone responsible for the death
of an agent, reluctantly, though at a price 'Jonathan' accepts the task, though 'Dragon' does have his former-agent in mind
for a further sanction when completing this one.
Job done, 'Jonathan' because of his climbing-skills of the past is asked to take on a far more dangerous mission, the agent
that had been assassinated was a personal friend of 'Jonathan's' so accepting the second part of the sanction was inevitable,
the reward enough to set-up his retirement.
The second assassin is not known, however what is known is that during the next climbing season he will be part of a team
attempting to climb the north-face of 'The Eiger' in the Swiss-Alps, a climb 'Jonathan' had attempted and failed to conquer
twice before.
Trouble is these days 'Jonathan' is out of shape and will need to take part in an intense fitness programme to be up to the task,
former pal 'Ben Bowman' (George Kennedy) who will be a part of the Eiger-Team has been assigned to put 'Jonathan' through
his paces though the actual trainer is 'George' (Brenda Venus) a shapely part-native American.
Once ready 'Jonathan' will join up with a Mountain-Climbing team to make the attempt to scale the Eiger, a dangerous task at
the best of times, trouble is, one of the team is the assassin, 'Jonathan' needs to identify his target before the assassin realizes
that 'Jonathan' is there to kill him.
There are many superb and well staged climbing sequences throughout the film along with some stunning scenery, in addition
to some good action moments.
This is typical Clint Eastwood material accommodating his usual one-line humour moments and of course on-screen female
companionship.
Must admit i'm a sucker for 'Clint Eastwood' movies and have a tendency to replace my Eastwood DVD's with Blu-ray when they
become available.
The picture quality is far superior to that of it's DVD version though a little grainy at times especially during the Eiger sequence
Though not Clint's best movie, certainly worth a visit or indeed a revisit if your a fan.",1455408000,2,2372,5.053571428571429

59863,3,0783230346,"Clint ventures into James Bond territory with this uneven entry, early in his directorial career. Film tries to be too many things at once and falls rather flat because of it. IMHO, the film's biggest flaw, is Clint in the title role. He was too well-ingrained in the public conscious as both The Man With No Name & Chief Inspector Harry Callahan to slip unnoticed into this surprising departure from his usual roles. I didn't for a minute buy Clint Eastwood as an ex-assassin now retired and working as a college art professor(!) You certainly can't blame the guy for being bold enough to try something new but it isn't entirely successful because in the end it IS our man Clint, and sorry folks but Clint is no Sean Connery. Heck, he's not even a good Roger Moore. The Eiger Sanction actually has all the earmarks of a typically silly-yet-fun 70's Bond adventure, complete with creepy characters (Thayer David's unsettling albino ""M"" variant), goofy babe names (Buns and Jemimah Brown) and various breath-taking, globe-trotting locations. In fact, about the only things missing to make this a perfect Bond film are Monty Norman's iconic theme music, a gimmicky foreign sports car & personal weaponry and Roger Moore himself.

George Kennedy steals every scene he's in, has all the film's best lines and is probably the best thing about the film. This movie would certainly NOT be well-received today, what with all of the politically incorrect baggage it contains: the aforementioned Jemimah Brown character, along with a stereo-typically flaming effeminate gay character and his little dog (who's name cannot be printed here on Amazon because it violates their policy guidelines!), and more. On the plus side it has some gorgeous Switzerland location scenery and amazing, hair-raising climbing footage. There are lots of sexy babes (George & Buns, etc.), car chases, fist fights and plenty of international intrigue. The action scenes are all very well-staged and it's heartening to see Clint, in the flesh, up there on the face of some beautiful but frightening mountainside cliffs, climbing his butt off. No fake 'Cliffhanger' CGI scenery to be found here, and that makes the stakes seem even higher. The Eiger Sanction isn't Eastwood's finest work but it's by no means his crummiest either. Besides, if you're in the right frame of mind it's solid if silly fun, though I personally prefer his westerns, Dirty Harry adventures, or other one-off entries like Escape From Alcatraz, The Gauntlet, Space Cowboys, In The Line of Fire, Blood Work, or the recent excellent Gran Torino.

Like Coogan's Bluff, which I recently reviewed, this movie was gifted to me as part of the 4-film Clint Eastwood American Icon Collection. This 3-DVD single box set features four movies that I'd either never seen (Coogan's Bluff, The Eiger Sanction and Play Misty For Me) or only caught bits & pieces of over the years (The Beguiled), so it was a nice addition to my respectable Eastwood Film library. The picture quality was quite nice; video was fairly sharp and the colors were bright & crisp with little or no print damage. However, there was some pixelation apparent during certain sequences, especially those featuring a lot of detail (tall grass, dense trees, rocks, etc.) or fast-moving camera shots (the desert canyon car chase sequence), but these were few and far between and weren't too terribly distracting. The audio portion of the film was strong & steady, with a well-balanced overall sound mix. The movie's original aspect ration of 2.35:1 appears to have be faithfully maintained for this home video release. Sadly, there were no extras included with this film, the second of three discs in the Clint Eastwood American Icon Collection 3-DVD box set. Bottom line: you could certainly do better than this particular entry in Eastwood's extensive filmography, but you could do a heckuva lot worse, too. 3 STARS.",1420761600,2,3911,5.033950617283951

This movie was adapted from a novel (which I didn't read). I hope the book was a better story.

The first part tells of the recruitment and training for a retired assassin. He will take part in a mountain climbing expedition on the north side of the Eiger mountain (a very difficult climb). His job is to determine who is the traitor among the other three men and eliminate them. (Believable?) We meet characters who are part of this story. It seems to be padded out by providing actions that seems unrealistic to me.

When the training is complete he is sent to take part of the climbing team. We meet the others in this party. Can he figure out who is the guilty party and eliminate him in an ""accident""? There is a problem for this party, they ascend the cliff but have not marked out a return in case of danger. What will happen if he can't identify the guilty party? [Is this really the job of a paid assassin?]

I think a poor plot will identify the guilty person as someone who seems the most unlikely. What then? Some of the action seems to be part of an obvious clich.

60004,3,0783230346,"The Eiger Sanction is one of those films with a high enough concept and a big enough star not to need to have a good script, which is lucky because despite the efforts of no fewer than three writers the script is not very good at all, and seems to know it. Clint Eastwood is a somewhat unlikely mountain-climbing art professor: we know this because he's introduced standing next to a big sign saying he's an art professor while enamoured students swoon over pictures of him mountain climbing. Luckily for the film he's a somewhat more likely retired assassin working for Thayer David's total albino: we know he's a total albino because he tells us. David and Eastwood don't get on, which is strange, because David's office is perpetually in the kind of near total darkness that Eastwood the director loves. Maybe he just doesn't like people who impersonate Bond villains. He doesn't want to go back in business either, but David threatens him not only with an audit of his stolen art collection but also to auction them off to the public, something which horrifies art snob Eastwood into agreeing to kill an unknown man with an occasional limp who just happens to be part of a team led by old pal George Kennedy attempting to climb the Eiger. Only his target obviously knows that one of the party is out to kill him and his fellow climbers start to meet accidents...

Yes, it's a very silly film - silly enough for Eastwood to camp it up as a gay delivery man in one scene, Jack Cassidy to play a gay turncoat with a horny dog called Faggit with a thing for Clint's leg and for our antihero to beat up one of the stars of Plan 9 From Outer Space - but as the author of the novel, Travanian (Rod Whitaker) pointed out, worse than just being vapid it also led to the death of one of the climbers involved in the shoot, David Knowles. His accidental death early in shooting on the Eiger itself does unfortunately take some of the sheen off the film's most impressive aspect, the unfaked climbing sequences with Eastwood not only doing almost all of his own stunts on the North Face of the Eiger itself and on the 'Totem Pole Rock' in Monument Valley rather than on a friendlier slope or on studio sets with dodgy back-projection but also directing the film as well. And spare a thought for the poor camera crew, having to take the same risks with the added burden of lugging up and operating camera equipment as well. The film improves considerably as it goes along, though the first half is more of a politically incorrect guilty pleasure, but the spectacular mountain sequences are gripping enough to be worthy of a better film.

Unfortunately the DVD, one of the earliest releases on the format, is pretty low quality: the dark scenes are darker than even Eastwood intended there's a lack of detail and a lot of clumsy edge enhancement: it's such a poor transfer with so little effort put into it you half expect it to be panned-and-scanned fullframe, but it is 2.35:1 widescreen with the original trailer as extra, which is something at least.",1366588800,2,3044,4.563071297989031

60017,3,0783230346,"Clint Eastwood is now a Hollywood icon. This movie was earlier in his directing career and, though it shows some deft touches, it lacks a sense of storytelling he would develop to a much greater degree later on.

Here's the scoop. Clint plays Dr. Hemlock, an art professor over whom many of his female students swoon. He was a high level hitman for some shadowy government department who is now blackmailing him into ""sanctioning"" (read hit) two foreign agents who just sanctioned one of our own. They know the first target who Clint terminates in rather clumsy fashion early on. They don't know the second target but they know he'll be climbing the Eiger mountain with a team. Clint, having twice previously tried and failed to climb the Eiger, joins the team in hopes of rubbing out the bad guy.

This is a good watch but lacks the necessary tension when it's needed. The set up is decent. The second act, when he visits his bud (George Kennedy), who owns a climbing school, where he needs to train and brush up his skills, is pretty good. The third act, where he needs to climb the mountain, identify the second agent, and do him in, is where things lose focus. This turns into a mountain climbing movie. He directed the climbing stuff really well. And it appears Clint, having begun his career as a stunt man, did much of the climbing himself. But there is little tension here. Little sense of the cat and mouse play one should find in this situation. And the final confrontation just doesn't work. I don't want to spoil so I'll need to leave it at that.

Some of the character names, Hemlock, Dragon, Pope, are a bit strange. The music, early John Williams, has some nifty, trademark Eastwood, jazz passages. The padder is clever. Some of the story aspects are very good. Except maybe the Miles Mellough part. And Eastwood shows a deft hand in directing under what must have been difficult circumstances.

The villains are suitably villainous and the Clint Eastwood character deals with them forcefully and firmly.

This is a favorite oldie which still has a lot to offer the action movie fan. At two hours and eight minutes running time it takes the major part of an evening to watch, but it is fun to watch and I recommend it to the action movie fan.",1355443200,,762,4.482014388489208
60021,5,0783230346,"""The Eiger Sanction"" (1975) starring Clint Eastwood is a spectacular ""mountain movie"" of the sort big in 1920's German classic cinema.

The famous 1929 German movie titled ""The White Hell Of Pitz Palou"" (1929 Germany) starring young Leni Riefenshahl directed by Joseph Pabst is an example of German ""mountain movies"" which always included spectacular camera work recording breathtaking icy mountain scenes, most often in the European Alps.

World audiences were very enthusiastic about ""mountain movies"" but few were made after sound movies replaced silent movies.

""The Eiger Sanction"" (1975) is an exception, and a spectacular one.

About 50 percent of the movie is taken up with incredible and spectacular camera work of breathtaking and hair raising mountain scenery both in the USA's famous Monument Valley terrain, and also in the Swiss Alps.

The Richard Shickel authored biography of Clint Eastwood titled ""Clint"" reports that a stunt man doubling for the actor-climbers in the Swiss Alps part of the movie was accidentally killed during the shoot, and the entire production was almost shut down as a result.

""The Eiger Sanction"" (1975) shows both the beauty and the danger of monster mountains, and must be counted as among the best outdoor photography ever provided for a Hollywood feature movie.

The movie is historically interesting because it mirrored its times (the middle 1970's), which were still part of the counter-cultural revolution and sympathies usually called collectively ""the 60's,"" but actually a period comprising the last half of the 1960's and first half of the 1970's (the 1970's was also ""counter-cultural,"" but doesn't get credit for it when the while era is referred to as ""the '60's"").

Heterosexual interplay and enthusiasms between Clint Eastwood and various attractive actresses part of the movie are part of the show, and are of a sort which later disappeared from movies after the ""Sexual Revolution"" of the those ""counter-cultural times"" faded away.

The anti-CIA, anti-government sympathies and mentality of counter-cultural times are also seen in ""The Eiger Sanction"" (1975), which proposes cynically that CIA ordered and staged assassinations were not always necessary or justified.

""The Eiger Sanction"" (1975) is a CIA agent movie which, unlike most others of its type, does not have a final scene where the good guy and the bad guy duke it out at the end, and the bad guy ""gets his."" The main interest of the movie is the wonderful photography....the movie is sort of an ultimate travelogue of spectacular mountains seen in vivid color and from astonishing angles, with camera work done from helicopters and small airplanes which ""get in close"" in almost a surgical way.

""The Eiger Sanction"" (1975) did not go on to become a famous or honored movie listed among the ""classics"" of its time, but it deserves to be.

""Jaws"" (1975) was made the same year (1975) as ""The Eiger Sanction"" (1975), and was also produced by Richard Zanuck and David Brown (Helen Gurley Brown's husband!), and also included music composed by composer John Williams.

""The Eiger Sanction"" (1975) included heavyweight support talent, and the result was and still is a true winner.

Eastwood did a lot of research to prepare for this climb.  And the research pays off.

Clint Eastwood is cool and squinty as ever (though I almost choked when another character guessed his age at thirty-five!) and I loved his cynical, non-patriotic (not the same as unpatriotic) take on a government assassin during the Cold War.

So the beginning is strong, but then we get to the part where he goes back to climbing school and the pace draaaaaaags out. There's important stuff happening there and the shots of Clint climbing in those non-CGI times are eye-popping. But there is just way too much film time devoted to this section.

60039,4,0783230346,"""The Eiger Sanction"" is a gutsy spy drama that was a departure for Eastwood from his western and Dirty Harry style roles. Or was it? Clint is a retired assassin, and is somewhat short on the theory of mercy. In this way his character in The Eiger Sanction has more parallels to his other roles of that day than one would think.

A renowned mountain climber in the public eye, Clint is chosen to join a multi-national climbing team facing off against the Eiger, one of the toughest climbs in Europe. The catch? International intrigue concerning a stolen formula and a man who killed one of Clint's best friends ... a man who'd saved his life, not to mention a threat to Clint himself from his past.

George Kennedy and Jack Cassidy play important roles well. Clint's training for the climb, and footage of mountain climbing in the USA and Europe make this film a unique and interesting experience.

There were plenty of beautiful women, some dangerous, but most as ""frosting on the cake"" roles.  At any rate the final scenes were interesting as Eastwood is told to figure out who in the mountain-climbing party he needs to assassinate.

Do you like spy stories, secret international organizations, assigned killings and the like? Well, maybe You'd like this CD. I've somehow gotten tired of this cold-war-related type of thing. In any case, Eastwood comes out of retirement as a college art professor (really?) in order to revenge the killing of an old friend. The movie involves a lot of training )with George Kennedy as the trainer) in mountain climbing in order to confront the perpetrator on a climb of Eiger Peak in Switzerland. Well, mountain climbing involves a lot of suspense in itself, in addition to a murder plot to go along with it, and I've never particularly cared for mountain climbing.

In any case, the base camp and practice climbs were at an unidentified locality, which to me was obviously Zion National Park and Monument Valley (both beautiful locals, I might add). It seemed rather strange that they'd leave the base camp (Zion) and go out for a day's climb in Monument Valley, a full day's drive away. Sorry, I'm a geologist and just can't help notice such things. I guess making movies can get somewhat complicated. In any case, the final and most suspenseful scenes are saved for the Swiss Alps.

60077,3,0783230346,"If this is not one of the silliest, over the top, unintentionally (or maybe intentionally) hilarious movies ever - with or without Clint Eastwood in front and behind the camera, then I don't know which one is. So, Clint does Indiana Bond, teaches Art in the college, collects priceless paintings of the Artists no less than El Greco, Pissarro, and such, is an accomplished mountain climber, and on the side moonlights as an assassin for C2, an international spy organization led by an ex-Nazi albino villain known as Mr. Dragon. By the time, the movie starts, Dr. Jonathan Hemlock (Eastwood) is retired from C2 but like so many retired secret agents, just when he thought he was out, they pulled him back in. His former employer, terrifying Mr. Dragon who has to stay all the time in almost complete darkness due to his condition, orders him to perform a ""sanction"" meaning to kill a man who had killed a friend and a former colleague of Hemlock with C2. To complete the mission, Dr. Hemlock has to participate in the attempt to climb one of the most dangerous mountains in Swiss Alps, the North face of Eiger - thus the title of the film, The Eiger Sanction. While preparing for the mission, Hemlock would go to train in Arizona at a mountain resort run by a close friend, Ben Bowman. The Arizona sequence allowed Eastwood the director to make some truly magnificent and stunning shots of Monument Valley. The shoot of Eastwood and George Kennedy on top of the ""Totem Pole"" is a real spectacle and a symbol of masculinity that Eastwood has been the embodiment of. Besides being breathtakingly beautiful, it has historic significance - it was the last time anyone was allowed to climb to ""Totem Pole"".

The second half of the film takes place in Alps and covers the preparations of the international group of four famous climbers from France, Germany, Austria, and USA (Dr. Hemlock) for the ascent to Eiger and the dramatic climb. To make the matter even more difficult for Hemlock, one of three mountaineers is the target of The Eiger Sanction, and that's all he knows. The name of his future victim was not revealed to him by his bosses at C2.

Even with the laughable dialogs, one-liners, and way over the top villains, The Eiger Sanction is an entertaining movie which has a lot to enjoy. First of all, during his long career, Clint Eastwood has always been a strong presence at the screen. Back in 1975, at the age of 45, he looked great, and the lustful interest in him from the beautiful exotic girls in the best traditions of the Bond's movies is fully justified. Eastwood did all his stunts in the film. All climbing was real, and if anything, the film will be remembered for truly astounding scenes of the ascent to the North Face of treacherous Eiger and dramatic descent. I also should admit that the twist in the end was if not unpredictable but satisfying in the way it put the pieces of puzzle together.

The music that was written for the film by John Williams, and plays in the opening and closing sequences, deserves special mention.

60079,3,0783230346,"Eastwood directs and stars in this unsubtle but still interesting mid 70's thriller.  He is a retired assassin for a government agency, who is persuaded out of his art loving retirement for one last job.  He, apparently, is also a retired rock climber, and therefore the only man for the job since his mark is one of a group of climbers about to climb the Eiger... but which climber is it..? We don't know.  Well, in truth the whodunit is fairly easy to see early on, and the first hour is pretty mediocre 70's fayre.. It's once the climbing starts the tension starts racking up, thanks to Clint's insistence on both acting and directing on location and doing the stunts for real.  Sadly, this was to lead to the death of one of the stuntmen climbers, who ironically had previously successfully climbed the Eiger.
Nobody really seems to be taking this seriously, least of all Clint as either actor or director, as the `plot' develops with many a 70's clich.. girls with afros jumping into bed at the drop of a hat, random nudity, horribly stereotyped camp gay bad guy (who actually names his dog `faggot' in case you don't get the `subtle' clues) and George Kennedy, just to name a few. Eastwood forgets the slack first half once we get to the Eiger in the final section of the movie, and it's the tense climbing scenes rather than any intrigue or 70's styling you will probably remember after the lights come up.  Also worth a note is a John Williams score which more than passes muster in setting the scene for that real 70's thriller feel...
Truthfully, Eastwood's indefatigable screen charisma makes this a 4 star movie, despite trying to convincingly play a `womanising-art-lecturer-retired-assassin-rock-climber `, which isn't a part one imagines one is asked to do very often..  However the very poor transfer - which is so bad in places you could be forgiven for thinking you were watching a pirated copy - knocks a star off.  It's in widescreen at least, but non anamorphic (meaning it's not designed for modern widescreen TV's and will appear as a letterbox in the middle of the screen, requiring some zooming in to fill out your screen), frequently washed out colours despite the gorgeous locales, and full of other imperfections.

There was at least one more scene in the Eiger Hotel where Pope confronts Eastwood, and Eastwood slams his hand in the door. That explains the extra irony when Eastwood later steps on Pope's hand in their outdoor fight, and Pope cries out ""ow, my hand, my hand!"".

Also, the scene where the little dog jumped into Eastwood's jeep in the desert was omitted in the original. Instead, when George Kennedy later informs Eastwood that the county sheriff has found Milo's body in the desert, he concludes with: ""...and the damnedest thing..."" ""What's that?"" ""They say that he ate a dog"" to which Eastwood returns his best insouciant smile. I could see that they might have taken that out for today's animal-rights PC-crowd. Which means that they must have filmed both versions and used the more rude one in the original release. Does anyone else remember it that way?

Stormy weather, icy conditions and that brutal devil called gravity also prove not to be Jonathan Hemlock's friend.  Eastwood plays the part of Hemlock and does so quite convincingly, but not only that this is a gem in which it was also directed by Eastwood himself!

Hemlock (Eastwood) has to climb the Eiger and figure out which climber on his team killed an important agent.

Just one of many classic one-liners delivered by a stone-faced Dr Hemlock. This movie has all the wit and sarcasm of a Dirty Harry classic, and all the adventure and stunning landscape of his westerns. An Art teacher by day, but retired government assassin by night, Dr Hemlock is brought out of retirement to sanction the two men involved in killing his friend. The first job was easy, but the second proves the real challenge. His employer knows only that the man is one of a group who plans to climb the Eiger Mountain in Switzerland, a mountain that nearly killed Hemlock the first time he tried to climb it. But the mountain is not his only adversary. One of his fellow climbers, who could well be someone he'll need to rely on when in trouble, is the one he must sanction. But which one is it?

The photography in this movie is stunning; emotive images of death-defying climbs from monument valley to the Swiss Alps. Some complain the movie is long and slow, but I watched the short version and then bought the full length DVD, which contained more excellent scenes that actually clarified some parts of the movie. So I would recommend you buy the full length version. You won't be bored, not for a minute.

60112,4,0783230346,"I think this is a great film.  Many critics and a few reviewers always complain about it's running time (128 minutes), insisting it's too slow.  Almost ALL of Clint's films (the ones he's directed) run long.  The running times range from just over 2 hours to just under 3 hours (the longest being Bird, at 2 hours, 40 minutes).  Sure, the film isn't PC, but it was made in 1975, when you didn't have to be PC.  But there is one thing that almost everyone agrees on...the mountain climbing scenes at the end of the film.  These are nervewracking and incredibly authentic.  Clint did all his own stunts in these sequences, and many professional rock climbers and mountaineers have praised these sequences.  And they are very intense to watch, because you know the actors are really up there.  No CGI in those days.  This is one of the reasons they work so well.  CGI looks fake anyway.  It makes movies seem like cartoons.  People know it isn't real.  CGI reliance should be reduced in Hollywood, as it takes the tension out of action scenes.

The photography from the American southwest is vastly better than the part of the film photographed in Europe, in my opinion.  And Eastwood did his own mountain climbing in The Eiger Sacntion.

I'd far rather watch Dirty Harry, Magnum Force, The Enforcer, or Sudden Impact (all for the 20th time or more) again rather than watch The Eiger Sanction for the third time.  I'm afaid of heights, so this may have something to do with my non-interest in The Eiger Sanction.  On the other hand, this is one of my wife's favorite Clint Eastwood movies.

It's also worth watching if you like secret agent, black ops types of films. I do but this one is not as good as many others in that respect.

The story is of a retired government hitman who is an art professor. He is forced out of retirement to go after some people who assassinated a friend of his. All he is told is that one of the assassins will be taking part in the climb of Mt. Eiger in Switzerland. It is up to Eastwood to figure out who it is and ""sanction"" him.

This film portrays a very bleak view of the US government. This not uncommon for films from that time. Basically, the mindset is that the US is no better than any other regime and probably worse.

This is due mostly to the location shoots - filmed in Monument Valley and in the Swiss Alps instead of on a Hollywood soundstage.

60137,3,0783230346,"In his seemingly endless career, Clint Eastwood has directed quite a few movies, and acted in a helluva lot more. ""The Eiger Sanction"" may rank as the wierdest of all of these, and that's saying something. It's the not-so-short story of a semi-retired government assassin who is blackmailed back into service for one last job. Of course, ""one last job"" turns into several. And the last of the last involves a target whose identity is unknown to both Eastwood and his employers. Cross a boilerplate international secret-agent yarn with a whodunnit, or rather a whoisit, mix in some Rocky-esque training sequences and top it off with a documentary on the wierd because-it's-there mountain-climbing culture, and you have ""The Eiger Sanction.""

I knew after 5 minutes of watching this movie it had to be based on a novel, and not a particularly good one at that. It has the feeling of a by-the-numbers story punched up to ""colorful"" dimensions by a pill-popping hack writer, who deciced that making every character so wildly eccentric would make us forget they could all have walked right out of Central Casting with their per diem checks in hand.

Take the names, for instance: Hemlock, Mello, Dragon, Wormwood, Pope, George (for a woman), and of course, Jemimah. Subtle, they're not.

But I'm getting ahead of myself. Eastwood is Dr. Hemlock, the ex-assassin who now works as college professor. For a third of the film, Clint plays Hemlock as a fussy, smug, condescending, know-it-all who uses words like ""involuted"" and wears ridiculous 70's era eyeglasses. Then, about a half-hour into the film, he simply becomes CLINT EASTWOOD, guzzling beer, using words like ""ain't"" and abandoning the professor persona completely. I never did figure out whether this was intentional, meaning that Hemlock's collegiate personality was simply an act, or whether Clint simply couldn't summon the energy to play Hemlock as such an annoying, arse-puckered temple of repression and decided to play himself for the rest of the flick instead. To his credit, once Eastwood drops the smug, his character is a lot more likable and often very funny.

Hemlock's boss is Dragon, a wierd albino who lives in a climate-controlled office(I'm not making this up). Dragon, we are told, used to work for the Nazis, and how he heads up C-2, a ""deniable"" gov't agency that ""sanctions"" various unfortunates who fall afoul of it. He blackmails Hemlock out of retirement by threatening problems with the IRS over Hemlock's art collection (I SWEAR I am not making this up). Then he sweetens the pot by saying that the mystery target is the guy that iced Hemlock's friend and mentor. Dragon also employs a hapless minion named Pope, whose main purpose in the film seems to be to get beaten up and humiliated by Eastwood. Question: if you're such a Professor Moriartyesque mastermind, why can't you employ a goon who actually knows how to fight?

Hemlock's girlfriend, sort of, is a black female agent named....sigh....Jemimah. She seduces him and steals his money, which is how all good relationships start. Then he gives her a condescending lecture on the immortality of her actions, which had me holding my head in dismay. Dude, YOU KILL PEOPLE FOR A LIVING, AND YOU'RE GIVING MORALITY LESSONS? NOW THAT'S WHAT I CALL INVOLUTED.

After killing several unimportant people, Hemlock discovers that his mystery target is a mountain-climber going up with an expedition to best the Eiger, a man-eating pile o'rock in the Swiss Alps. Since Hemlock twice failed to conquer the Eiger, he's naturally intrigued. He can combine his two hobbies and take a vacation to Europe all at once. But first he has to get in shape, and since this takes half the movie, it's worth noting.

Eastwood's old friend George Kennedy trains him at his remote desert resort in Arizona. While Hemlock follows George, his female Indian mountain guide, around on endless runs up sheer rock, he runs into Mello, an effete, foppish ex-mercenary now emeshed in the drug trade, who left Hemlock for dead in the jungle years ago. Poor Mello, played by Jack Cassidy, is one of those unfortunate characters who always appear in Eastwood films, whose express purpose is to be humiliated over and over again and then get killed. Like Dragon, Mello employs a bodyguard who can't fight and ends up blubbering for his life in the middle of the desert. The scene is played for laughs, but I didn't find it funny, or realistic. Hemlock drives the guy at gunpoint into the Mojave desert and leaves him to die of thirst and heat stroke? You gotta be kidding. First of all, if Mello really was an ex-special forces drug kingpin, he'd hardly be the floppy-wristed wuss Cassidy is forced to portray. Second, he'd be carrying a damn gun himself, instead of a poodle and a pack of cigarettes. I've met a lot of SF guys in my life, and none of 'em ever lisped, ""You let ME choose the wine!""

Having prepped himself, Eastwood heads for the Eiger while trying to puzzle out which of his team-mates he's got to kill. He also beats up Pope again, for using an unpleasant phrase to describe Jemimah. Once again, let us behold the hypocrisy: the murderer for hire stands up for racial justice. Finally, and by this time you've worn quite a groove in your couch and are probably on like your ninth beer, they climb the mountain, and the real fun begins. Will Eastwood get his man? Will Eastwood even survive the climb? Do you care, considering he's playing a sadistic button-man with a superiority complex?

The answer is, yeah, sort of. This movie is bizarre, sluggish, wantonly cruel, and has enough shots of the Arizona desert and the Swiss alps to fill 2 or 3 documentaries. But it's also wierdly compelling and visually impressive. When he isn't humiliating people or killing them, Eastwood's Hemlock is wisecracking at thrice the rate of Dirty Harry. All that's missing is the enjoyabl sensation that the hero is actually doing something good.",1117929600,5,5949,4.8821782178217825

If it weren't for the mountain climbing scenes, this movie is rather lifeless and dull.  Clint plays a college art professor (duh?) who was once a top notch assassin, and he is blackmailed into doing two sanctions for the albino head of some covert agency (played by the late Thayer David, who I will remember from his roles on TV's Dark Shadows).  His sanction is the Eiger Sanction, his job to kill one assassin who got away; the problem is he doesn't know who the assassin is.  Along for the ride are Vonetta McGee, hopelessly miscast as Eastwood's lover and a fellow agent; Jack Cassidy, hamming up his role as a homosexual ex-partner of Eastwood's; George Kennedy, fresh from his Cool Hand Luke Oscar as Eastwood's good buddy mountain climber; and Gregory Walcott as the obnoxious henchman of David's, who also likes to chew up his scenery.  After a fairly suspenseful opening in which an agent is killed for secret microfilm, the movie plods along until its climax.  I don't know why Eastwood chose to spend so much time showing us the Arizona landscape and his ""working out to get in shape"" for the climb scenes.  They're drawn out and impede suspense possibilities.  The movie is okay for a 1970's flick, but it pales in comparison to most of Clint's later work.",1113955200,,1410,4.726530612244898

60164,5,0783230346,"In a stunning and abrupt departure from both his very successful ""Dirty Harry"" and ""Any Which Way But Loose"" franchises, Clint Eastwood extended his range of genres to include the spy thriller with this deft adaptation of the best-selling Trevanian novel of the same name. In fact, quite little is changed in this taut and thrilling tale of a once famous mountaineer and retired government assassin turned college art history professor who is forced back into the ""sanction"" business both by personal greed and crude manipulation by the spymaster of the clandestine government agency that requires his services.
An American courier has been killed in Copenhagen, and he happened to an old friend of professor Jonathan Hemlock (Eastwood), who is seduced back into harms way by ""Control"", an albino ex-Nazi who now heads one of our most clandestine federal agencies.  Before long Hemlock is on his way to sanction one of the two assailants, and the chase is on.  By dint of coincidence, Control discovers that the other assailant is included in an international mountaineering party, which will assault Switzerland's  ""Eiger"" the coming summer.  Naturally, Hemlock is manipulated into preparing for the climb as a replacement climber.
Once we finally make it to the mountain, the action is literally non-stop, quite accurate technically, and absolutely riveting to behold. As with previous sequences shot in the American southwest, the cinematography is superior, and the plot unfolds in a quite plausible and inevitably tragic fashion with no one necessarily spared as the frenzy reaches its natural conclusion. This is a terrific action film, with a great supporting cast that includes George Kennedy, Jack Cassidy, and bodybuilder Dan Howard in a bit role.
This is great entertainment, and illustrates why Eastwood has been such a consistent box office draw for over forty years. Enjoy!",1057190400,11,1887,5.259136212624584
60165,3,0783230346,"Though this is, indeed, an Eastwood film, it is, uncharacteristically for Eastwiood, based on a book. The book is, of course, far, far better than the film, but for a quirky, off-beat bit of casting against type, this is a nice bit of fluff.  The book wasn't, of course, but as Eastwood seems to have found it impossible to transmit very much of the book's richness of narrative and subtext onto the screen, what can one expect?  The best scene is when Eastwood says, ""Freytag!  You aaaaaaaaaasshoooooole!""",1047427200,,506,4.793103448275862
60166,4,0783230346,"This is the peak of Eastwood in his earliest prime. Perhaps a bit tacky in some ways, but intentional tackiness is always a good for a laugh. When one mixes Eastwood's sense of humor with some of the absolute finest (and REAL) mountaineering sequences ever filmed, you end up with the Eiger Sanction.
If you've got 2 or 3 good friends, spend a Saturday afternoon watching this film over a few beers. Enjoy it for what it is. Learn some of the funniest lines in film history, such as: ""Does your physical condition preclude you from getting to the point?""...
Eastwood insisted on doing all his own climbing scenes, and this was one of the reasons he ended up the director: No one else would do it! Moreover, one of the technical advisors, a world class climber, much respected among mountaineers, was killed during production on Eiger. This film was no laughing matter to those who created it.
All in all, one of my favorite Clint Eastwood films, and one of the finest... and funniest.. mountaineering films of all time.",1041465600,4,1019,4.666666666666667
60167,5,0783230346,"I've seen this movie at least 30 times since 1975, and it remains one of my favorite of his films. Yes, it's a little cheesy (as many 70's movies were), but it's a very fun movie, quite different from his usual performance as a cowboy or cop. It was filmed during Clint's heyday of the 1970's, when he was the coolest/toughest guy on film. The entertainment value is top-notch, and it's definitely a must-have for all true Clint fans.",1041206400,,434,4.506329113924051
60168,4,0783230346,"As a thriller, the 'Eiger Sanction' is just ok. It is a pretty faithful adaptation of Trevanian's bestseller from 1972. It stars Clint Eastwood as Dr. Johnathan Hemlock -- an ex-climber now art professor who does occasional asassinations for a secret US agency to pay for his art collection. He takes on one last job to pay for a Pissaro he desperately wants; but it requires that he get out his old climbing boots. He'll have to do the job while climbing the north face of the Eiger -- certainly one of the most dangerous climbs in the world.
I'm not completely sure of this, but I believe that this movie was also Clint Eastwood's directorial debut. He not only stars in it, but he produced and directed it as well!
Ah, the glorious 70's! The clothing, the hairstyles, the attitudes towards women, etc. It is quite fun to watch and chuckle at now. Hemlock is a kind of James Bond-ian super hero.  Remarkably gifted not only at killing bad guys but also at bedding beautiful women, enjoying fine wine and food, and being an art expert. The story ofen requires you to suspend your sense of reality and to have a bit of a sense of humor. If you enjoy these kinds of thrillers, you'll definitely enjoy this one.
What sets this movie apart for me is the many climbing sequences! I am an avid climber and I know of no other 'Hollywood' movie that does as good a job as this one at showing real mountain climbing. The climbing scenes in the 'Eiger Sanction' are breathtaking and quite realistic. The scenes on the Eiger were actually filmed on location on the Eiger Nordwand itself! Remarkable! Apparently Clint is/was a bit of a climber himself, and took great pains to portray the climbing in as realistic a light as possible. Three cheers for Clint! On a sad note, one of the stuntmen/riggers was killed while filming the scenes on the Eiger.
Most other mass-market climbing films completely ruin the climbing scenes to make them more dramatic or exciting (Vertical Limit, Cliffhanger, K2, etc.); or are documentaries trying to cash in on the current Everest fever (and are more interested in the 'death zone' aspect of high altitude climbing than actually showing real climbing).
Bottom line for me: I bought this VHS for its depiction of the climbing more than the story line. However, it's also a pretty decent thriller as well as a fun trip back to the early 70's.",1038700800,25,2366,4.619952494061757
60169,2,0783230346,"Truth is: I've bought this DVD as a gift for my boyfriend, because he's a Clint fan...

60170,3,0783230346,"""The Eiger Sanction"" stars Clint Eastwood as Jonathan Hemlock, a college professor of art, experienced mountain climber and ex-hit man for ""C-2"", an agency of the US Government.  C-2 is headed by an albino named ""Dragon"", who wants two enemy agents ""sanctioned"" (killed).  Hemlock agrees to perform the hit, going to Zurich to do the job.  The execution is very messy, hardly what one would call ""professional"", but the job gets done.  Dragon still wants the second agent eliminated, but C-2 is having trouble pinpointing the identity of the target.  What is known is that the man will be part of an upcoming international climb of the Eiger, a mountain in the Swiss Alps.
Hemlock needs to get in shape for the climb.  His training takes place out west, at a climbing school run by Ben Bowman (George Kennedy) an old climbing buddy.  Hemlock's training is complicated when Miles Mellough (Jack Cassidy) arrives on the scene.  Mellough betrayed Hemlock years before, nearly costing him his life.  This time Miles takes a trip he won't return from.
Trained and ready, Hemlock arrives in Switzerland with Bowman, prepared for the climb, and his mission.  The team includes three other climbers, one of whom is supposedly the target to be ""sanctioned"".  One climber must continually ask silly questions any experienced climber would know the answers to, so the audience can become informed about the common practices of mountain climbing.  Once the climb begins, we are treated to some magnificent scenes in the mountains.  To my untrained eyes the scenes look very realistic, and are the best the movie has to offer, as they transition from climbing bare rock to snow covered rock faces.  While they climb, Hemlock attempts to zero in on his target, and find the one he has to kill.  The mountain does his work for him, as the Eiger proves to be too much for the team.  Accidents and bad weather add up to disaster for all but Hemlock.  C-2 is satisfied that the mission has been accomplished, but they don't know the complete truth.
While The Eiger Sanction is not a great movie, Clint Eastwood makes an excellent Hemlock, and the scenes of mountain climbing, both in America and Switzerland do make the movie worth viewing.  Eastwood should also be applauded for his efforts to bring realism to his role when it came to doing his own stunt work.  He also directed this feature, which is another of the challenging films he did in the 70's.",1019433600,7,2438,4.803357314148681
60171,5,0783230346,"DUUUDE!!  This movie is so cool.  OK, this one was directed by dirty harry himself, and as such its so funny to watch.  Clint Eastwood, perhaps one of the lankiest and funkiest-looking action stars ever gets in the sack with extremely hot girls for no apparant reason, beats [...] people twice his size, and has more ""I'm a raw [...]"" one-liners than I have ever seen in a movie.  Aside from that, it does well from the technical climbing perspective in that it didn't show all that much of the gear.  In fact, the only obvious farce was when he was supposedly leading a sandstone pillar somplace in the southwest US, he was shimmying up a chimney on a top-rope.  Not possible, but oh well.  The movie has some really nice shots during the actual Eiger climb, and the green pastures so many thousands of feet below are a very nice touch.  Reminds me of how it really feels to be that high off the ground on the end of a skinny rope.  Good stuff man, two thumbs up!",1012521600,3,964,4.340782122905028
60172,5,0783230346,"This action movie struck me as more of a political intrigue.  Most of the plot developments revolve around discovering information as to an assasain's identity and how Clint is going to kill this person.  It keeps you in doubt the entire time, and the answer presents itself far differently than you might expect.  If you watch this movie, I don't think it would have much appeal unless you keep in mind that Clint's character is trying to avoid being 'owned' by a government agency, where the mere information they have on his work as an assasain can destroy his freedom and carear.  When you discover who killed who, why and how, you will see what I mean when i say that the interest in this movie derives more from the political machinations rather than the action involved.
The other dimension one will enjoy is the one liners and wit by the characters.  At one point, Prof Hemlock (Clint's character) says something like,""What will our country come to with Pope's and Dragon's running it?"" both of whom are actualy character names, which affords a nifty pun.",1012176000,,1063,4.724324324324324
60173,4,0783230346,"This movie has some of the best vintage climbing footage ever.  Clint's ""training"" climb in Utah is really fun to watch.  It is a peek back in time at a sport that has evolved rapidly over the past 20 years.  Hob nail boots, ""bongers"", manky pitons, and hemp rope make for some real nail biting footage.  Clint leads a fantastic stemmed chimney (while on top rope?) were the camera man uses some ground breaking rope work.
The footage of the Eiger is passable.  It is interesting seeing what was considered cutting edge climbing back then.  The pitches they were climbing would be considered novice routes today, provided the weather held.
Plot?  Who cares!  It is classic Eastwood, full of meaningless one-liners.  He's always retired from something, isn't he?  One of my favorites.  Got to love those bathing beauties at his buddy's ""swinger's ranch""!
If you're a climber or an Eastwood fan, you MUST check this one out!  If you're not either, then odds are you won't appreciate it.",999388800,7,984,4.791666666666667
