4993952,5,B006JN6DB2,"I can think of no other film that is quite like it. John Guillerman's FINEST FILM bar NONE. Even better than his sorely underrated NEVER LET GO w/ Richard Todd and a nastily vicious turn as a VILLAIN from Peter Sellers.

The film is loaded with beautiful scenes and everyone in it is at the peak of their game. Patricia Gozzi gives a heart-rending performance as the central character Agnes. One of the BEST performances EVER...Melvyn Douglas just off his Supporting Actor Oscar win in HUD (a similar character, but without the sympathetic core center of the father in this film) is also quite moving as his character has a reveal late in the film which gives the key to his whole personality. And what wonderful B&W scope cinematography from Marcel Grignon! Not to mention a gorgeous Georges Delerue score rife with heartbreak and even some chilling passages. There is a almost horror movie gothic treatment here that will surprise many (it did ME when I first caught up with it Pan & Scan on TV years ago). The film is quite simply a stunning masterpiece and should be far better known and appreciated than it is. Screen Archives/Twilight Time is to be commended for releasing it in a superbly rendered bluray edition. All of their product comes with my recommendation...The transfers are like glass paintings!",1349568000,7,1312,4.8053097345132745
4993953,5,B006JN6DB2,"Brilliant film....the magical score elevates the story to an other-worldly level. The acting is fantastic, while the cinematography is merely miraculous on this incredible blu-ray bly Twilight Time. Definitely a must-own film which is rarely seen today. It must be experienced by all cinephiles.... Too bad only 3000 copies available.... Get it while you can.... Isolated score option in 2.0 stereo....truly magnificent....",1342828800,13,423,5.838709677419355
4993954,5,B006JN6DB2,"1965's ""Rapture"" starring the forgotten, brilliant French actress, Patricia Gozzi, who was so indelible in ""Sundays and Cybele"" is just as captivating in this American film directed by John Guillermin, director of such great movies as ""The Blue Max"" and ""The Towering Inferno.""  Cast opposite her is the forgotten heartthrob, Dean Stockwell and Melvyn Douglas as her stern father, a one-time judge.  Gozzi, whose charm and sincerity and remarkable depth she achieves in her acting skill reminds of the talent of young Hayley Mills.  It is a pity she only made a handful of films and is now married and living in Paris and working as manager in an English firm.  Although the film is in black-and-white, the Twilight Time Blu-ray of the Cinemascope film is breathtaking in its clarity and is a limited 3,000 piece edition.  They certainly do not make them like this anymore, and rarely made them like this at all.  With a screenplay by Stanley Mann and a wonderful score by Geroges Delerue, also available here as an isolated track.  Only available in Blu-ray, but certainly the reason to watch movies in Blu-ray.",1339632000,15,1112,4.9144385026737964
4993955,4,B006JN6DB2,"Twilight Time's second Blu-Ray limited-edition release is a real find: the first-ever video release of the 1965 20th Century-Fox Cinemascope drama ""Rapture,"" a movie so obscure it doesn't even appear in Leonard Maltin's Movie Guide.

Set on the French seacoast - evocatively shot here by cinematographer Marcel Grignon - ""Rapture"" tells the story of an unusual 15-year-old teenager named Agnes (the marvelous Patricia Gozzi) who lives on a Brittany farm with her domineering father (Melvyn Douglas) and their housekeeper (Gunnel Lindblom). We first see Agnes as a girl-child who still plays with dolls, but her adolescence blooms once an escaped fugitive (Dean Stockwell) takes refuge in their home, donning the clothes of a scarecrow Agnes had made. At first she even believes Stockwell to be the living incarnation of the scarecrow, but soon finds herself being drawn to him as her burgeoning sexuality begins to show.

""Rapture"" is an odd film, no doubt about it. Stanley Mann adapted a novel by Phyliss Hastings for this Fox production, directed by John Guillermin (later of ""Towering Inferno"" and ""King Kong"" fame) yet produced with a mostly French crew. Gozzi is a revelation here in the difficult role of Agnes, seeking to escape her confined existence but knowing nothing of the outside world - that Gozzi starred in only one other film before retiring from acting makes this Blu-Ray release one of the first opportunities many viewers will have ever had to see her, and she's positively captivating in the picture.

The movie's rather melodramatic story, meanwhile, isn't as captivating as its performances and its visuals, which look beguiling in Twilight Time's BD edition. The black-and-white scope cinematography is sensational in Fox's 1080p AVC-encoded transfer, while the mono audio includes an early, typically beautiful score from Georges Delerue, which is also isolated on an alternate channel.

Julie Kirgo's notes put ""Rapture"" into the proper perspective as a ""cursed"" film that one imagines would have been highly controversial had anyone seen it back in its day. Adventurous cinephiles, Delerue lovers and Cinemascope connoisseurs now have the opportunity to see one of the more unusual studio-produced films of its era, in a splendid Blu-Ray edition from Twilight Time limited to 3000 copies. Recommended!",1336953600,23,2330,5.323369565217392
4993956,5,B006JN6DB2,"Remarkable film starring the forgotten actress Patricia Gozzi. The DVD has no subtitles or bonus materials, you can however switch to a soundtrack playing just the score during the film.",1331164800,6,186,5.233333333333333
4993957,4,B006JN6DB2,"Years ago I saw this movie on late night TV, and fell in love with it.  I also remember liking the theme music.  I haven't seen it anywhere on TV for decades, but that hasn't decreased my desire to see it again.  I have waited all these years for it to be released on VHS or DVD, because it was apparently tied up in some kind of litigation or something.  I enjoyed it and I'm sure others have also and will be happy to buy a copy once they know it's available for purchase.",1329004800,6,474,4.01063829787234
8499610,5,B006JN6DB2,Patricia Gozzi is fantastic in this film! One of my all time favorite films from this era. Clean film transfer and good quality audio. I highly recommend this film!,1528934400,,164,4.689655172413793
8499611,5,B006JN6DB2,"Given as I seem to be the only one here who actually saw this when it was released (actually before it was released, at a sneak preview) I can say I was completely entranced by the film, mostly because of Patricia Gozzi, who I'd already loved in Sundays and Cybele.  She's equally great here in a more adult role.  And no, audiences wanted none of this film back then - it played a very quick release then disappeared but thanks to Twilight Time here it is in all its black-and-white scope glory.  It's been issued in the UK by another distributor and the armchair pundits proclaim that the ""encode"" is better - do not listen to these nincompoops as they read stuff and think that means they understand it.  First off, ""encode"" is some word coined by someone somewhere - what they're talking about is authoring a disc - that is what the professionals call it.  Anyway, the transfers are identical.  Get this while it's still at a reasonable price.",1520294400,,947,4.541176470588235
8499612,4,B006JN6DB2,"I absolutely love this movie. Patricia Gozzi is mesmerizing throughout. I'm happy to finally own it. My only complaint (and the reason for only 4 stars) is this edition is not closed captioned or subtitled at all. I'm not hard of hearing, but I watch most things without audio turned up so I don't disturb my neighbors. So just a heads up for those needing captions, you might take a chance on the Non-US format version instead. By all means find a way to see this film anyway.",1517270400,,477,4.431818181818182
8499613,5,B006JN6DB2,"One of the two great films made with Patricia Gozzi in the late 60's. These films have haunted me ever since. (The other is 'Sunday's and Cybele'). If pushed I would rank them in my top ten films of all times. (Has not always been the same, now I would include 'Snow Falling on Cedars', 'Diva', 'Mona Lisa', 'Full Metal Jacket', 'The Girl in the Cafe', and 'Wild Target'. Sometimes I have included 'The Quiet American' {the one with Michael Caine}).",1473292800,2,449,4.555555555555555

8499615,5,B006JN6DB2,"Thank God I bought this Blu-Ray about 2 years ago when the price was half!  Also, thank God I have a multi-region player so that I can watch it!  This is indeed a mesmerizing film, mainly because of the breath-taking acting by Patricia Gozzi!  I only hope that Twilight Time release another 3000 copies of this film so others can enjoy it.  The Blu-Ray transfer is excellent!

She made only two films, and she was absolutely brilliant in both.  I don't mind that I only saw two of her films, what saddens me is that she made only two films.  What a waste of wonderful talent!",1437868800,,575,4.367924528301887

8499617,5,B006JN6DB2,"Rapture shows what seems like a cross-roads between Bergman and New Wave with of course American Cinemascope thrown in. Bergman because of the actress Linblom, a frequent player in Bergman(The Silence,The Virgin Spring),as the sensual house-keeper in the cliff-top Brittany household. Also Patricia Gozzi's portrayal of Agnes,an adolescent with learning difficulties,growing from childhood into a sexual awakening. We also have a freedom of camera movement to show the young girl's often crazy mental state,with unbalanced,giddy swirling movements, depicting both her abandon, sense of freedom or constriction. Agnes seems like a heir of Through a Glass Darkly, the troubled young mind close to madness,having her special relationship to dolls, making a scarecrow,using her father's old clothes. Finding the escaped prisoner as her resurrected scarecrow,wearing the same clothes. We also have the brilliant B&W cinematography,sweeping along the Brittany coast and up past a gothic mad -house. The New Wave was into showing how things were made or constructed too. This could have been a New Wave film with its technically innovative camerawork.

The story is like a fairy tale with young Agnes having only her father(Douglas) as the stern paterfamilias who keeps her in a childhood state by oppressing her with a bitterness(she reminds him of his deceased wife).He is a complex figure and does love her. Her only other role model is the kindly housekeeper,Karen(Lindblom),who has a secret lover,she smuggles into her bed through her window. Into this world comes a fugitive from the law(Dean Stockwell) who appeals to her father's sense of injustice and sense of compassion about what the law should be. Agnes will deceive the law to protect her scarecrow,which her imagination believes she has created. Joseph the fugitive comes into this world,having accidently killed a guard,he being innocent of any madness and a redeemable human being. He is the outsider upon whom these 3 people project their own image as in Pasolini's Theorem. John Guillerman was an able British filmmaker who progressed to larger-scale Us studio projects,Blue Max,The Bridge at Remagen,King Kong and The Towering Inferno. This film was the road not taken. Here he has Darryl F.Zanuck's Francophile backing,collaborates with Marcel Grignon's cinematography,richly textured and pristine,and Delerue's perfect score. It has subtitles,a brilliant booklet and commentary by Julie Kirgo and Nick Redman.

This film is superbly expressive,a French-shot rites-of-passage story conveying a genuine sense of expressive empathy,the contrast between city and countryside,the search for romantic yearning in the conjuring up of love of a troubled protagonist on the cusp of womanhood. Gozzi shows how these ground-breaking films rely both on a young(usually female) newcomer,twinned with a director prepared to take a risk. The film's rescue from 50 years of obscurity because distributors weren't prepared to accept the age disparity between a 15 and a near-30 year old, though Stockwell is supportive of the young girl and gallantly holds back. Gozzi authenticates the reality of psychic mood swings,the film has an undertow of foreboding. Oh and it's not in colour,which may have made it less popular. But only black and white does it justice. This is a true resurrection:a brand new HD transfer.",1409702400,3,3363,5.515503875968992
8499618,5,B006JN6DB2,"Having cherished the memory of this film for 47 years, to see it again at last, in this brilliant Blu-Ray format, is a very emotional experience.  RAPTURE emerges from tragic oblivion as a masterpiece of 1960s European cinema, resplendent with the power and passion of great direction and performances, mesmerising photography, and a ravishingly beautiful and romantic musical score.  To the great credit of all concerned, then and now, the return of RAPTURE is a triumph.  (Clearly a 5-star ""rave"" from this reviewer!)",1357689600,13,519,5.228915662650603
8499619,5,B006JN6DB2,"At last this film arrives for mass-consumption on DVD. There are a handful of films that have an ""inner life"" of their own, and this is one of them. The chemistry of the work at any moment carries a past, present and future that is both aesthetic as well as literary. Its unique use of assymetrical close-ups seems to grow out of the story, and the psychological impact is stunning. One is reminded of Bergman's close-ups that expose the soul. The performances by Melvyn Douglas and Patricia Gozzi, especially in their later scenes, work together as an organic whole to exchange primal secrets of sorrow, bitterness and compassion. Not enough can be said of Gozzi's work here. Her role is complex, reaching for highs and lows, at once both brash and subtle in its nuanced sensibility. Her painful transition to womanhood is depth-charged and entirely convincing. The last frame of her face in the film is that of a child wearing many life-times of experience. Its poignance has few equals among the work of actresses at any age. Gozzi's early retirement from the industry is the most poignant note of all - we are left to wonder at the loss.",1355097600,10,1141,4.71
