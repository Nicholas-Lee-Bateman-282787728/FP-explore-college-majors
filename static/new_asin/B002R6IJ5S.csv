8378409,2,B002R6IJ5S,"I did not like this video.  True, it did contain some footage from the blitzkrieg in Poland that I had not seen before, but overall as it says on the back it was originally used as a training video for U.S. troops, and later for the American public.  There are much better dvd's to use to inform you about Hitler and WWII.  Don't spend over 5 dollars on this disc either.",1461974400,,371,4.197183098591549
