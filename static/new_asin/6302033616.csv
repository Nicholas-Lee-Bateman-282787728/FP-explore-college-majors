8324558,4,6302033616,"Rare find. First time ever on DVD - and DVD only. It's from the makers of Savvah Smiles and is a Christmas tale the entire family can see. Not one curse word. It develops and moves slowly early -- the way movies used to.

The New York Times said, ""This heartwarming Christmas tale contains a western twist as it tells the tale of a heavenly cowpoke who rides down to Earth to ride herd on a few people in need of some miracles.""

Imprisoned, down-on-his-luck drifter, Gabe Sweet (Mark Miller) is forced to seek redemption by undertaking a Christmas charity mission on behalf of the town. There's only one problem - the ""charity"" is as empty as the hearts of the townspeople themselves. But, with the help of a dearly-departed Angel wannabe (Slim Pickens), Gabe quickly learns that the ones truly in need are the ones who already have the most.

CHRISTMAS MOUNTAIN: THE STORY OF A COWBOY ANGEL classically captures the timeless magic and spirit of Christmas. In the vein of ""Miracle on 34th Street"" and ""It's a Wonderful Life,"" join Gabe on his journey of friendship, compassion and understanding - and learn what it means to be truly rich ... in spirit.",1132444800,,1153,4.642156862745098
8324559,4,6302033616,"""Christmas mountain""(this is what it was called on cable)also known as ""Story of cowboy angel"" On the movie I bought from here the title says ""Christmas Mountain subtitle: Story of a Cowboy angel"" So when I went looking for it I didn't find it under Christmas mountain and I was confussed but I read the description and it said the same thing for one as it did the other, but to find it I put in the description on google.com and this is how I found the name ""Story of a cowboy angel, not to mention how many movies could there be about a angel that happens to be a cowboy and needs his wings not to mention I knew Slim Pickens was in the movie and so I figured how could there be two movies with the same guy playing an angel in a cowboy flick??? and so I deducted that it was the same movie. This movie is not the best movie in the world but it is a good movie and it holds great memories of my childhood back in the 80's. Growing up I was the only one at my house who saw the movie because it seemed to be only showed 2x's and about five in the morning. I was the only one up at the time I was soo excited about getting cable mostly the Disney channel but as I was switching channels I ran across this sweet movie about a goat herder's widowed wife and her child and an older lady who lived all alone on Christmas mountain until this cowboy came into town got thrown into jail at Christmas time and he was able to get out of jail if he took up some supplies to the poor family, since nobody else in the town below wanted to do it. The towns people only wanted to forget about the poor people not caring if they lived or died. So the cowboy went up the mountain to give them the ""gifts"" that the towns people gave to ease the consciences at Christmas. The cowboy didn't want anything to do sheep herders, but to get out of jail he did it. He went up and gave them the awful gifts of food that was less than desirable and the clothes that were to worn out to wear. The cowboy wanted to leave in the morning but he had to stay the night and so instead of sleeping by the fire in the house he decided to sleep in a cold shed outside. But while he was freezing and about to sleep he heard someone playing a harmonica and he looked and there was his old pal who had died and he was supposed to be an angel but he didn't have any wings yet and so the angel asked the cowboy to help him and himself(from a worse fate) to get his wings for him. So the next day the cowboy to the boy hunting and befriended the family and as the young boy had trouble getting a doctor up the mountain the cowboy shamed the doctor to come and help with birthing the widows baby. All the rest of the towns people were shamed by the speech and the gift that cowboy gave in behalf of the family on Christmas mountain. I bought the movie to prove that what I was talking about all the years wasn't my imagination and because I do really like the movie too. Very sweet, can make you cry, I did.",1085011200,2,2964,4.0
