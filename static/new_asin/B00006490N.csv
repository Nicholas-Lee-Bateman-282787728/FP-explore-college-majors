1706919,4,B00006490N,"A nice mix of old Casper toons, several featuring Wendy, the Good Little Witch. My kids sure love these, as I did as a kid. Some of them are very old, which both the kids and I don't mind at all. Reminds me of how I watched them on a snowy UHF station down in my cousins' house.",1226793600,,278,3.810344827586207

1706921,4,B00006490N,"This is a very good collection compared to others I have, these look great. My Grandchildren 3 & 4 love them. But I was dissapointed that it didn't have more of Wendy. Only two episodes of Wendy. The title does say Casper and Wendy's Ghostly Adventures? Casper and Wendy episodes were my favorite and I bought this thinking I would see lots of Casper with Wendy. That's the only reason I gave it 4 stars. Otherwise I highly recommend it.",1104451200,6,437,4.475
1706922,5,B00006490N,"I HAVE ALWAYS ENJOYED ALL THE PARAMOUNT CARTOONS: FROM FAMOUS STUDIOS POPEYE TO THE HARVEYTOONS TO MODERN MADCAPS AND NOVELTOONS OF THE EARLY 1960'S!!!!

1706923,1,B00006490N,"I remember that I watched Casper when young, but not much of it, and I didn't remember any of the content, just that he was a friendly ghost.  So when I saw this, I was excited to share a classic with my kids.  I was curious what it was like since I did not remember a thing, so I previewed it after the kids went to bed, and I do not enjoy it at all!  I'm going to chuck it without even showing it to them.  I'm glad I only paid $6 at Walmart (VHS).  It is very odd and distrubing to me.  Like when the lady is scared of Casper and her whole house runs away, and then the kids run into what's left of it, the basement, and zip up the ground.  Or how some freaky man's dentures come off on the apple he was trying to grab.  Just distrubing stuff, not sweet at all to me.  I can't imagine kids nowadays liking this.  But now that I think of it, I am more into cartoons now than I was when young.  I think there's such better stuff out there now for children.  Cartoons from my youth were more violent than I choose for my little ones now.  I love Arthur, Madeline, Kipper, Harold and the Purple Crayon (HBO series), Maggie and the Ferocious Beast.  They are sweet and not freaky like this.  And it's not that I don't get into some of the older stuff.  I love The Last Unicorn and Ricki Ticki Tavi.  Guess I'm not the Looney Tunes type that would get into this.  I can see where people who loved Casper when young would rave about this, but I'd be very surprised if their kids enjoyed it at all.  And the orchestra music playing throughout... I know it's the style, but I hate it!",1098489600,4,1578,4.032258064516129
1706924,5,B00006490N,I used to love these cartoons when I was a kid I used to love Casper and all of the Harvey Films characters.  I used to watch Casper's cartoons all of the time. I used to love him he was so sweet; But I would always get sad whenever people would be afraid and run away because he was so sweet!!!!  I really did used to enjoy Casper and all kinds of other vintage cartoons I enjoy this DVD it takes me down memory lane ; Casper was the best and one of my favorite cartoons!!!!!,1081036800,2,476,3.9479166666666665
1706925,5,B00006490N,"""Casper and Wendy's Ghostly Adventures"" looks and feels just like when I was a little kid - maybe even better. It hasn't been obviously re-touched or cleaned up, but it is in *no way* a terrible video transfer or bootleg VCD - previously the only alternative for getting this many classic Casper cartoon shorts on a disc (although I don't know if they were ever released on LaserDisc). This DVD looks and sounds pristine - and it is a bargain.
Released by a small group called ""Classic Media"", this DVD has no 'extras', but boasts clean, clear monophonic sound, full-screen format (because they were originally released for TV), and 14 cartoons that sound and look fantastic (featuring real live orchestras and beautiful hand-drawn cels)...a delightful watch for adults and children alike.
One has the ability to select each cartoon, or simply play them all straight through from beginning to the end - 82 minutes of sheer enjoyment.
Not only is ""Casper and Wendy's Ghostly Adventures"" an excellent DVD buy, it is a perfect example of fine formatting of these old classics to DVD for a reasonable price.
Just gimme the fabulous vintage cartoons, and forget trying to make all these DVD releases so 'special' with awkward 'extras' and 'behind the scenes' filler.
And by any means...please do *not* mix this title up with the live-action releases of late. This is the *real* ""Casper, the Friendly Ghost"" in all his sweet, benevolent 'ghostly' glory.",1060905600,8,1447,4.958847736625515
1706926,5,B00006490N,"I liked this story, I liked Casper and the characters and the scene,
I recommend this movie to youngsters and adults.",1035331200,2,117,4.619047619047619
1706927,4,B00006490N,"Picked this one up to share with my young kids and was surprised to find that the cartoons included in this collection were among my favourites when I was their age. The quality of the picture and sound is great, and don't let the title fool you- Wendy only makes an appearance in a couple of the shorts. Has no bonus features at all and is rather short (which is typical of these collections), but the price was right. Minor note: the producers seem to have cut the theme song from the beginning of each short (although the credits and titles remain), instead, including it at the beginning of the playlist of 14 episodes- purists may object, but it didn't bother me- I thought it helped with the continuity of the disc. Anyway, I believe that to date this is the only pure collection out there of the classic cartoons and I'm not going to be picky- I recommend this to parents with young kids and parents with young hearts!",1030492800,5,925,4.447058823529412

7960680,5,B00006490N,"Since others prior to this review have listed the titles of the cartoons in this DVD, I will just say that it was well worth the price and that these cartoons are much healthier for children of all ages to watch than the current garbage found on cable. It will not instill anger or prejudice into young minds. There are no hidden under tones for a young person's mind to act out on. They are just nice little cartoons that even adults can watch and relax after a long day.",1423872000,,472,4.2555555555555555

7960683,1,B00006490N,"My toddler loves Halloween and ghosts and generally seems fascinated by the macabre. I also like girl characters for her. So I thought she'd love this. She did seem to like it, but Mom did not. There was one cartoon where Casper's cousin mocks Casper for spending time with girls and calls them ""joy killers."" This goes on for quite a while. Casper's cousin has some sort of New York accent, so the pronunciation is 'goyles"" and ""joykilluz"". My toddler had no idea what was going on but began shouting, ""Joy killers"" over and over an over. There are offensive scenes with Native Americans, etc. Also, some scenes are quite scary. There was one scene where a bear chases a kitten, and my 3 year old toddler literally began screaming in terror and crying and I had to rush over and turn it off. Now, of course, the bear did not get the kitten, but I was surprised to find that the cartoon of the bear trying to hurt the kitten was so disturbing for her, as she is not easily disturbed.",1357689600,,983,4.406593406593407

To her dismay, none of her playmates have heard of Casper but they  have now asked their parents for a Casper DVD.",1301875200,,317,4.56140350877193
