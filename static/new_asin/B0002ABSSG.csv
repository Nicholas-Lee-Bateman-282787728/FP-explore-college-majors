2073251,1,B0002ABSSG,"Stay clear. The Director started with this one and worked out all the trash by the next two films. Cannibal Ferox and Eaten Alive are amazing, this is trash. Boring, alot of animal violence, 5 percent cannibalism, slow moving storyline, little cannibal torture scenes. All in all, avoid this film. I will watch almost any cannibal film there is and this one killed my excitement for it.",1369094400,,386,4.776119402985074
2073252,3,B0002ABSSG,"Umberto Lenzi's The Man From Deep River (aka Sacrifice, Deep River Savages)(1972) takes you on a journey deep into the jungles of Thailand, where a British citizen falls into the hands of a tribe of natives.  More of a drama than an action movie, the film explores the assimilation of an outsider into an indigenous group.  With a brief incident of cannibalism, the film is generally regarded as one of the first entries in the cannibal genre.

In Bangkok, photographer John Bradley (Ivan Rassimov) hires a boat to take him deep up river.  There in the rain forest, far from civilization, his guide is killed, and Bradley falls into the hands of a native tribe.  He is kept a prisoner, until the chief's daughter Maraya (Me Me Lai) takes a fancy to him, and he becomes her property.  Through a series of events and a number of trials, Bradley is accepted into the tribe and becomes Maraya's husband.  Life is fairly peaceful, and the couple is happily expecting the birth of a child, when tragedy strikes, as Maraya mysteriously loses her eyesight.  Believing that her only hope is medical treatment back in civilization, Bradley plans to make his escape.

Shot on location, Lenzi's film has pretty good production values.  While not completely convincing, the acting is perhaps better than you might expect.  The dialog is limited, but Maraya's ability to speak some English, helps things move a little more smoothly.  Although somewhat light in the action department, with instances of cruelty, torture, rape, and cannibalism, The Man From Deep River has a history of being banned in various countries.  The level of realism may be is open to discussion, but the movie is an interesting watch that explored some new cinematic ground at the time.  Delving deeper into the cannibal genre, Lenzi would follow up with&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Eaten-Alive/dp/B00006FDBO/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Eaten Alive!</a>&nbsp;(1980), and&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Cannibal-Ferox/dp/B000HXDWNM/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Cannibal Ferox</a>&nbsp;(1981).",1339718400,4,2140,5.752380952380952
2073253,4,B0002ABSSG,"This 1971 Umberto Lenzi classic movie paved the way to the Jungle & Cannibals series that will follow with much more extreme brutality, gore and all kinds of exploitation. This one is fair, with a descent story that develops in Thailand, with some action, a love story, a good amount of soft nudity, and of course, a gory cannibalistic scene. By the way, cannibals in this movie are a rather secondary element. As usual for these Italian jungle movies, lots of animal killing are included in the recipe. Previous to this release by Shriek Show, I owned a PAL (region free) from DVD Classics, bought from Exploited Cinema. I am glad I got this newer version. The Shriek Show release comes with a widescreen format presentation, with nicer colors, much better image quality and sound. The movie comes with English and Italian audios, and removable English subtitles. Extras include some trailers and an interview with the great Unmberto Lenzi, a nice addition.",1327104000,,958,4.919753086419753
2073254,1,B0002ABSSG,"If you came here because you expect another Cannibal Ferox, Cannibal Holocaust, or Zombie Holocaust, than Man from Deep River is NOT the movie for you. This is NOT a horror film. Many people who have never seen the film assume it as a cannibal movie because of the Cannibal boxset on amazon includes this film, and it is directed by Lenzi who has also made Cannibal Ferox and the jonestown massacre inspired cannibal film ""Eaten Alive!"".

The plot focuses on a man from the city exploring a river somewhere around Thailand who gets captured by a native tribe. The  man who is captured by a tribe(not a cannibal tribe), eventually submitts to the tribe and gets a love affair going on with one of the women of the tribe. The whole movie is about this modern aged guy, adapting to a tribe and falling in love with some girl. There is a cannibal tribe that lives around the tribe, they have VERY little to do with the plot and it seems they were randomly added to the movie. There is one scene of a guy chewing on a womans arm, this is the only real violence or cannibalism in the entire film. This movie has literaly just ONE bite of cannibalism the whole movie.

Go See Jungle Holocaust, Cannibal Holocaust, Eaten Alive!, and Cannibal Ferox. They are true classic cannibal films.",1324166400,3,1278,4.5
2073255,3,B0002ABSSG,"This movie was originally released in 1972 under the title, ""SACRIFICE."" Ivan Rassimov plays a Swedish John Bradly (Sven) who gores to Thailand as a photographer along with his blond gf. (Like bringing sand to the beach.) They attend a kick-box tournament with the Thai crowd going wide as if it was the WWF. She gets bored and leaves. He gets drunk and in a bar fight, kills a man, then flees to the jungles between Burma and Thailand were he is captured by a sadistic tribe, who eventually make him one of them. The acting was fairly decent. The plot was one we have seen many times. There is a lot of animal violence in addition to people violence. While this film is recognized as the first cannibal horror film, it lacks much of the ""horror"" cannibalism and gore of later films.

2073256,5,B0002ABSSG,"I must admit, I am a huge fan of the cannibal sub-genre, and the cannibal flick's from the 70's and 80's are some of my some of my favorite movie's of all time. It is no doubt the cannibal genre itself pushed the envelope further than any other genre as far as gore and shocking content is concerned, and for that, they will alway's  hold the title of the most horrific movie's ever made in my opinion, and Man From Deep River is no exception.

Man From Deep River is shot on location in the real jungle, with real native's, real ritual's, and is based on a true story, which add's a lot of authenticty to the movie and give's it the feel of a documentary. I would think of it as a depressing, disturbing version of Indiana Jones on acid. I was really expecting to hate Man From Deep River after reading review's of people saying this is not gory, not shocking, it's boring ect. I think a lot of people forget that this was made in the early 70's when large amount of on-screen gore had not caught on yet. For the time this was made (72), it has a lot more gore and offensive content than any other film's made around this time period. Most horror film's made in the early 70's had gore, but the penetration was not on screen, in this film the gore is not only on screen but there is a decent amount of it, including real life animal death's. Which I do not necassarily agree with, but I don't think anyone who eat's meat has the right to complain about, murder is murder, regardless what the reason for it is.

Man From Deep River is a beatifully shot movie with great scenery, good acting, good plot, and has an authenticity that too many film's lack. If you are a fan of any other cannibal film's from Lenzi or Deodato, and want to see how the genre got it's start, I highly recommend picking this one up.",1197504000,8,1808,4.25
2073257,4,B0002ABSSG,"British photographer John Bradley (Ivan Rassimov) is in Thailand doing business in the jungles, until he is captured by a wild tribe as he is tormented and being used as a slave. However a beautiful tribal girl (Mai Mai Lei) falls in love with the man and her mother who knows English helps him escape but there is danger for the tribe as a vicious cannibal tribe sets war on the good tribe, as only John must protect them from the flesh-eaters.

Violent and very good Italian horror action drama that set the course for the Italian cannibal genre thanks to infamous Italian director Umberto Lenzi who would later give us the notorious ""Cannibal Ferox"". This movie is basically a cannibal version of ""Dances with Wolves"" but it was before that movie ever occured, the acting is alright but the music score is quite good and has a good deal of gory violence especially some shocking scenes of actual animal mutilation such as a monkey getting the top of it's skull sliced off with a sword to have it's brain eaten, an alligator gutting while it's alive and a goat being stabbed in the throat. While not as excellent or extreme as ""Cannibal Holocaust"" which is still the king of all cannibal movies, this is a very good introduction to the cannibal genre from Italy.

This DVD has a very good widescreen transfer with good picture and sound with some good extras like photo gallery, Theatrical Trailer, Interview with Umberto Lenzi and other Shreik Show Trailers.

2073258,5,B0002ABSSG,"Wow I can't believe this movie got two reviews. It's an incredible beautifully shot and directed film by Umberto Lenzi.

The other reviews I don't understand at all what the heck they were expecting maybe ""Cannibal Holocuast"". An excellent movie about a man whose life changes and how he adapts himself to a dramatic situation. This is the type of movie that shows how man will do anything to survive once he lives in a world that doesn't take order from the outside world.

Very well, Isaac Rassimov does a great job of acting and narrating the tale. Basically a photo journalist of sorts from London who gets captured by a tribe. The tribe does many bad things to him and he observes how they brand out justice to any strangers tresspassing on their land. Eventually one of the girls

(saving his life in the process) takes a liking to him and they become lovers. The musical score for this movie is amazing. Again , it's beautiful shot and some of the scenes showing the wildlife and locales will take your breath away guaranteed. Umberto Lenzi is best known for making average horror movies including a horrible called ""NightMare City"" but this is by his best and most remembered movie to date.  The DVD features are thin but this is a great movie. Highly recommended.",1152921600,18,1272,4.64
2073259,3,B0002ABSSG,"IS IT JUST ME, OR DOES THIS MOVIE BARE A STRIKING RESEMBLENCE TO ""A MAN CALLED HORSE""? IT STARTS OUT LIKE THE SOFT CORE ""EMMANUEL"" FILMS OF THE 1970'S AND QUICKLY DECENDS INTO A B-RATE EXPLOITATION FLICK. THE PLOT TAKES A BACKSEAT TO NUDITY, GORY VIOLENCE, AND A SESPENSION OF REALITY.  THE MAIN CHARACTER WALKS OUT ON A BEAUTIFUL BLONDE GIRLFRIEND AS IF SHE WERE A 2 DOLLAR HOOKER, KILLS A GUY IN A BAR FIGHT, GOES OFF ON SOME UNDERWATER PHOTO EXPEDITION, AND GETS FISHED OUT OF A RIVER BY A GROUP OF JUNGLE NATIVES WHO HAVE NEVER SEEN A WHITE MAN BEFORE. HE IS PUT TO WORK DRIVING WOODEN POSTS INTO THE RIVER BANK WHILE SURROUNDED BY BEAUTIFUL NATIVE GIRLS WHO JUST HAPPEN TO BE COMPLETELY NAKED!(WOWZERS!) ONE OF THE GIRLS TAKES A LIKING TO HIM AND HE MUST ENDURE COMBAT AND TORTURE TO PROVE HIS BRAVERY AND VALUE AS A MEMBER OF THEIR TRIBE. (LIKE I SAID, DOESN'T THIS PLOT SOUND FAMILIAR?)

  FROM A PURLY EXPLOITATIONAL POINT OF VIEW, ""MAN FROM DEEP RIVER"" IS A SURE CLASSIC. IT HAS EVERYTHING THE 13 YEAR OLD BOY INSIDE ALL OF US CRAVES: EXOTIC GIRLS, TRIBAL MEN WHO DONT CARE IF YOU FOOL AROUND WITH THEIR SISTERS, BAR FIGHTS, PRIMATIVE WARFARE, AND CANNIBALISM.

2073260,2,B0002ABSSG,"""The Man from the Deep River"" as the credits show, is not what I expected. The box indicates that it is in the vein of all the other Italian cannibal movies. This is not the case as the film is more of a action adventure with little gore or horrific images. Basically, the plot is that a photographer gets stranded in the jungle and is captured by a native tribe. He eventually gains their acceptance and falls in love. He must ultimately decide if he should stay with the tribe or return to civilization. The director is widely known for his gross out movies but this is not really one of them. There are a few scenes of real animal killings and one sequence of cannibalism but other than that, there is nothing going on. Not much to recommend with this film, some good cinematography of the jungle locales, the one cannibalism scene, and that is about all. The DVD sports an interview with director Lenzi that is pretty good. He talks about how his one cannibalism scene was the first in the history of Italian cinema and a few other anecdotes about the movie. Not worth buying (like I did) but perhaps a rental.",1112659200,10,1114,4.439024390243903

8025138,2,B0002ABSSG,"Italian movies have a long tradition of showing copious amounts of blood and gore onscreen, so it's no surprise that a bizarre subgenre of cannibal horror films became popular there (and cult favorites here in the U.S.) back in the 1970s and 80s. Umberto Lenzi's ""Man from Deep River"" was the first of these, and, although its 30-second flesh-eating scene was undoubtedly shocking to audiences in 1972, in comparison with the work of Eli Roth and other modern goremeisters, the sequence comes off as ludicrous today. Unfortunately, so does the rest of the film.

""Deep River"" is the story of a British photographer (Italian actor Ivan Rassimov) on assignment to shoot scenery in the remote upriver reaches of Thailand. As director Lenzi freely admits, the film (allegedly based on a true story) was inspired by the success of the Richard Harris Western ""A Man Called Horse.""  Like Harris, Rassimov is captured by natives and his guide is murdered. Because he was swimming and wearing a wet suit when captured, some of the natives think him a fish-demon of some sort.

For a while he is tortured, but he eventually escapes and kills the village's leading warrior in a knife fight. Apparently, for this tribe, such a killing entitles him to be treated as a fellow warrior, and he even winds up marrying the dead warrior's gorgeous fiance following a bizarre courtship ritual in which the blindfolded girl has all the eligible men in the village fondle her and chooses a winner. Much of the film depicts the day to day life of the villagers, until their lives are disrupted when a rival tribe of cannibals attacks and captures and eats one of the women, causing Rassimov to seek revenge.

You have to give director Lenzi credit for going into an area that was undoubtedly remote in 1972 and working with non-actor, uneducated natives, many of whom did not speak English or Italian. However, his directorial fortitude does not make for a good movie. Other than Rassimov and Me Me Lai, the actress playing his wife, the acting in the film ranges from barely passable to ludicrously bad, and the fight scenes are poorly staged. Further, the sight of a native pretending to eat a prop woman's foot is extremely silly.

Undoubtedly realizing that he would be unable to make a conventionally good drama given the limitations of the cast, the budget, and the location, Lenzi made a potentially wise decision to spend as much of Deep River's screen time as possible depicting authentic tribal rituals and customs. It's not surprising he took every opportunity to shoot Lai and the other female cast members wearing little or no clothing. What is somewhat shocking (at least for 21st century viewers) is the level of apparently actual killing and torture of animals that is shown. We see snakes being ripped apart, crocodiles being gutted, and a monkey having the top of its skull cut off so the natives can have a snack (shades of ""Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom""). Those scenes are far more gratuitously shocking than the pseudo-cannibalism depicted here.

""Deep River"" is a bad movie: poorly acted, poorly written, poorly photographed and edited for the most part, and exploiting the needless torture and butchering of various animals for the alleged entertainment of the audience. Why, then, have I given the film two stars instead of one? There are two reasons, one having nothing to do with the movie itself. The DVD features a ten minute interview with director Lenzi who describes (in subtitled Italian) what went into the making of the film and gives some highly interesting perspective for those interested in the technical and business aspects of film making. Second, there is a fairly lengthy sequence that depicts something I had never seen on camera before, a fight between a mongoose and a cobra. That scene, which notably depicts animals fighting each other as they do in nature instead of being cut to ribbons by people for the camera, is actually memorable. The rest of the movie is not.",1402099200,,3999,4.864904552129222
