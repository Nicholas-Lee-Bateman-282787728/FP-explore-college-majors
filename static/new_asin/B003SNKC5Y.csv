8404534,4,B003SNKC5Y,This is a good documentary about a neglected subject.  I find the lesser-known battles of WWII to be very interesting.  I hope there's more to come like this!,1424304000,,158,4.607142857142857

8404536,5,B003SNKC5Y,"Ever since visitng Corregidor six years ago, I've been trying to find a good documentarty to share with my family.  This documentary does a wonderful job blending historical and current day footage of the island fortress, and retells the key role Corregidor played in the WWII.

Based on the other sources I looked at, the information is accurate, if not as in depth as I would like.  Given the length of the video, it certainly accomplishes giving the viewer a feel for what it was like (and is like) to visit this unique island base, with a good overview of its history.",1360886400,3,572,4.588235294117647
