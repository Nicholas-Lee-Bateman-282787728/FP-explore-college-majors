8331035,5,B001OPQIHO,"If you haven't watched this yet - do it now! This anime is roll-on-the-floor-laugh-out-loud funny. The plot is interesting, and the characters are great. The English dub is well done, making it a pleasure to watch in either language. I highly recommend it to any and all anime fans looking for a laugh.",1258156800,2,302,4.716981132075472
8331036,4,B001OPQIHO,"This is a very ""anime"" anime, with exaggerated artwork, lots of yelling, sometimes disconnected story.  That said, our entire family couldn't wait for this issuance of the end of the story.  MUST see Part 1 first--it won't make any sense otherwise.",1242864000,,248,5.024390243902439
8331037,4,B001OPQIHO,"While not as energetic as the first half of the series, Part Two does still have it's shining moments. The biggest issue is that the story drifts away from the initial goal of making her into a lady. It eventually finds it's way, but the lack of direction becomes noticable and even disturbing. Like most anime, the ending is left open, but at least we are left with some kind of closure, a nice change from the usual anime fare.",1240185600,,429,4.375
