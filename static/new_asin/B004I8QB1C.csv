8430486,1,B004I8QB1C,"Yes, this flick that supposedly about otaku in reality propaganda nonsense for kids younger than 5 so, I guess, the producer hoped I will give it 5 instead of one. Sure, cell phones present and even computer mentioned sometimes but the point is the producer lives in 1200 B.C.E yes 1200 years before computer era. I am not sure whats word dating means in Japanese but the producer never dated anybody in his/her life as it clear from movie. Avoid.",1380326400,,447,4.6
