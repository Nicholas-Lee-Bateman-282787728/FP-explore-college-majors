3520077,5,B001CU7KRS,"A lost treasure from WWII, a US Vet who was so traumatized that can't be bothered to travel to France to find the buried prize, a greedy fat man who will stop at nothing to find it himself. It's like ""The Maltese Falcon"" and ""Casablanca"" rolled up into one and blown up into real life. This story is the stuff that dreams are made on! Great! Great! Great!",1222387200,2,355,4.235294117647059

8289370,5,B001CU7KRS,"Delivery of DVD was on time (shipped to Australia from US). The documentary itself was fascinating, proving that passion and patience pays off in the end, with all the sacrifices that were made which did not impede or dampened the spirit and drive of Yaron Svoray. (over a decade was this treasure hunt went on for)

A powerful documentary which will make you think where some of these diamonds came from, and what history that follows them.
This will keep you intrigued from start to finish.",1457481600,,492,4.72093023255814

8289376,2,B001CU7KRS,"An incredible true story shown on the History channel but no longer available in Australia. An amazing set of circumstances arising at the end of the WWll and the on collapse of NAZI Germany.  American GIs seize a cache of uncut diamonds from fleeing NAZIs gatherered from Jewish prisoners of concentration camps, being smuggled back to the fatherland.  The GIs enter a pact and hide the diamonds without revealing their existance.  Years later the son of the Isreali ambassador to Australia a past member of Isreali Intelligence service is told the story of the diamonds by one of the original GIs who was unable to return to Germany because of injuries.  The Isreali agent then makes a series of excursions into Germany to recover the stones.",1295308800,,744,4.880952380952381
8289377,5,B001CU7KRS,"An enthralling DVD for anyone interested in the mysteries of the 2nd world war.  The story spans 50 years and tells a tale of tragedy in relation to the holocaust, opportunity for the soldiers who originally found the gems and the persistence of one man who spent more than a decade to find the life diamonds.",1287187200,,309,4.517857142857143
8289378,5,B001CU7KRS,"I first saw this on the History Channel in Australia.  It is an amazing story, a true journey through history and an amazing personal transformation.

A brash and somewhat cocky and confident man who starts out purely for profit and adventure ends up a changed man after years of hunting and investigating the fate of a bag of diamonds from WWII, along with the many individuals who played a role in that journey.

The up close and personal stories that are revealed are beautifully explored and some unexpected connections revealed.  You get to follow the trail on both a global geopolitical perspective along with intensively personal paths.

This doco can reduce you to tears by the end of it.  One of the best I have seen in this genre.  Absolutely worth a look.",1254873600,,766,4.714285714285714
