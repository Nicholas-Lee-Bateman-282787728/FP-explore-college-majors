8252360,1,B0013NAP0S,"I was quite disappointed when the package arrived and the DVD box was damaged. Inside, the center plastic piece that holds the disc in place was also damaged, and the DVD was rolling around. This was a gift so I'm not sure if it was scratched or not.",1452384000,,250,4.229166666666667

8252362,3,B0013NAP0S,"This is an action comedy which is not my kind of film. I am a straight action fan, but this was entertaining. It is a movie that you can enjoy if the plot doesn't need to make sense. There are plenty of fight scenes and action stunts to keep your attention. The acting is passable. So if you need to kill 90 minutes with some fast paced action and a few cheap laughs. This is the film for you. Gun fights, car chases, helicopters and fist fights, with people chasing people who are chasing other people.",1408579200,,503,4.25
8252363,4,B0013NAP0S,"Making a game of the chase with man as the hunted has given rise to some fine stories and good movies. This one has no underlying theme, no contest of Good and Evil, no intrinsic meaning, just a great deal of action, many stunts, and fun. No pretense here,  just as many bullets as can be fired, as many cars, trucks and  planes as can be wrecked, put afire, shot up, just as many punches, karate kicks and the like as can be thrown, all for the fun of it. That's the point, it is fun and no one gets too serious. Billy Zane does what little acting is required and plays his role as the Hunter of the Biggest Game, Man, with aplomb and style. The others are competent, well up to the little demanded of them. This is a film to watch when emotional involvement, intellectual challenge, identification with life-like roles, are not what you are after. No more is required of the viewer than was in the Keystone comedies of a century ago.",1371859200,,935,4.306818181818182
8252364,4,B0013NAP0S,"Before the made for TV credits is over we know that ex-quarterback Sonny Briggs (Sean Carrigan) through first person narration is a small time limo driver in Vegas with a gambling problem. In fact he owes 20 Grand in debt. Right after the credits a man gets shot from a helicopter in downtown Vegas.

Sonny's life is in turmoil. So much so that he agrees to be hunted by Billy Zane who has slipped a GPS device on him. The rules are simple. If Sonny lives for 24 hours he gets $2.4 million dollars minus a 2% handling fee, the films attempt at humor.

The inane action starts right after Sonny leaves the Casino. Sonny opts to make Cleveland his battleground (Filmed on Location!). This is not a simple game of cat and mouse. The bookie that Sonny owes money has hired its own killer to go after him. She (Corinne Van Ryck de Groot) bumps heads with Zane over killing Sonny. On his way to Cleveland, Sonny has bumped into a Second Amendment enthusiast who supplies Sonny with the means to shoot back.

The action is non-stop with exploding cars, babes on bikes, and Zane hunting from a black helicopter. There are some scenes that were just bad. Such as two guys with automatic weapons, about 20 yards apart in the open and they can't hit each other? What do you expect from a Zane film? Straight forward. Not much in the way of twists or thinking.

No f-bombs, sex, or nudity...just the capital of Thailand",1328313600,,1407,4.463035019455253
