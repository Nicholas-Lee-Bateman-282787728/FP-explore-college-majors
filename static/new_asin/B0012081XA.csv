I have not yet attempted a decoction mash even though it is the preferred method for some beer styles. Watching the demonstration in this video really clarified some things for me and answered at least one major question I had about decoction: what effect does boiling have on the malt enzymes and consequently the wort? This video addresses that very thing. With such knowledge in hand I am ready to tackle this intriguing method of mashing in the near future. Not today, though, as I am preparing to do an infusion mash for an Irish Red Ale, a style that I really enjoy. The low-tech lagering system is a good idea if you happen to be a gadget-oriented person...or just someone who likes things that make sense. Not only is the cash outlay minimal, but the whole thing can be stored in a small space and moved easily if necessary. I have seen some of the plans online for fermentation containers made out of sheets of insulation board and while I am sure they do the job they also take up more space than this system does. This video has inspired me to give lagering a try, something I have previously avoided. All in all this is a good overview of some fairly advanced techniques and it makes them easy to understand and implement. At about 30 minutes run time the video is a bit shorter than I would like, yet it covers the material pretty well. I'm feeling a little thirsty right now, so I think I'll pop open a homebrew.",1373932800,,1571,4.4206896551724135

8243259,3,B0012081XA,"Don't get me wrong, the guys at [...] 's other two videos ""Basic Brewing"" and ""Stepping up to All Grain"" gave me my wings.  I bought this DVD for the plans to build the ""Low Tech Lagering System"", or LTLS.  To be quite honest it does nothing the the ""Son of a Fermentation Chiller"", free for the effort of a Google search, doesn't do which is compact in one box and isn't dependent on water.  The decoction mash part was the only redeeming part of the DVD.  If you want to try that and don't understand Palmer's free online book that covers that topic then pull the trigger and buy it; if not skip it.  It was a bit of a let down.
