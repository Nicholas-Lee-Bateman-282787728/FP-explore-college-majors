5689494,1,B00C2YBUT2,"Slow, rambling movie with no parent plot. The actors mailed in their performances since the dialogue could have been written by a seven year old. That's fine, since there was nothing about them that was engaging anyway. Don't waste your time.",1399420800,2,242,4.926829268292683
5689495,2,B00C2YBUT2,"Subtitles would seem to wash out due to the background, but we are all hoping to see more about this porn star.  If you are hoping to, you'll be sorely disappointed.  It was like going to a strip club, having to sit on your hands & being blind folded.  You hear a lot about her life & what she likes to do, but don't get to see the good stuff.  Unsure if this is based on a true story or not but it was played out that way.  If you're looking for a hard core flick, skip it.  If you like foreign films & subtitles are you thing, then enjoy.",1378944000,18,540,3.8636363636363638

8576905,3,B00C2YBUT2,"While the listed date is 2014, I think anyone with 80s nostalgia, like myself, might have a soft spot for this.  This is More about capturing a feel and style than a plot, or even the soft core porn I think a lot of disappointed reviewers were looking for. It makes me think of some of the first music videos from the early 80s, esp. While shot through pinky red filters, and accompanied by ethereal synth. Music, and even some of the eighties aerobics type wear. Olympia mostly follows pretty porn star newbies about their daily life, and is nothing all that blatantly sexual.
It does seem that if you haven't finished watching something you probably shouldn't give it a bad review.",1506556800,,683,4.598360655737705
