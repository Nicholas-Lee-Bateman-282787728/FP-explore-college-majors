It looks like they will always be together, until a couple of princesses form other worlds show up and ask him to choose one of them to marry.

After things start to settle down a young girl comes from the demon world to live with Kaede and Rin, making everything even more crazy. With all these really great ladies after his attention Rin must choose one, and break the others hearts.

This story is very good. It's a great harem style anime with lots of awesome characters and plot twists. It is also very emotional. The last 6 episodes or so are really heavy. The animation quality and voice acting are also very good in this anime. I enjoyed every minute of it. I hope you do too.",1354924800,,920,4.317919075144508

The first episode has the the entire gang (Rin, the girls, and Sia's and Rina's fathers) at the beach.  With an eyeful of gorgeous girls in swimwear, Rina wanting swimming lessons from Rin, Asa using him as a swimtop, and getting taken away with Sia on a float raft, poor Rin has his hands full.  The second episode has Sia and Rin getting together, does the cute god girl have the upper hand over the others.  Add the fact that her father is spreading rumors about Sia and Rin getting married, Sia is on cloud nine.  But when she realizes that the stories are hurting the others (especially Rina), she asks her mirror what she should do and is shocked to see her reflection returning a self-satisfied grin (could this be her darker half?).  The third episode takes us to the last day of summer school and parallel stories for Megumi (the flat chested, half-demon girl) and the teacher Miss Ho.  Megumi starts her day by running into Rin (ebarassing herself in front of everyone else), losing her wallet and her unmentionables, and giving a cafe full of people a show.  But when Rin shows up to return her lost items she realizes what the others sees if him.  Miss Ho starts with with having a heart to heart with a student, tries to get picked up by either Iskie or the King of Daemons, and also gets a message from her mother about finding a nice guy.  The last episode has the gang working to finish their summer homework (and being very distracted by being between Sia and Rina), but something seems to be wrong with Remu.  When she collapses and the girls do not tell Rin what is going on, the Kings of the other realms decide to tell him Remu's story and what could be happening.  Can Rin convince Remu to return the the realm of daemons, and if so can she return?

This series has hit the midpoint and is still bringing on the laughs and the suspense that started in episode one.  WIth a little more fan service, some flesh flashing, and more mysteries to uncover, the final  two disks will be much anticipated.  See you next time.....",1210464000,2,2154,4.401515151515151
