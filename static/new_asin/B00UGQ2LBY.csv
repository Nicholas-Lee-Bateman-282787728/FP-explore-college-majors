8706129,1,B00UGQ2LBY,I purchased this DVD after watching the show on PBS. The content is fantasic and enjoyed every minute of the show. This prompted me to purchase the DVD. Big mistake. The DVD is written on poor quality media and when played the picture continually skipped. Also many times the picture distorted with interference lines across the video. When we finally got to the last chapter after numerous skips and hashes in the picture the video stopped playing altogether and refused to continue. I tried the video on 2 other dvd players and even my computer DVD drive with the same results. My question to the producers? Why create such a great high quality production and then distribute it on such low quality media?,1363392000,21,707,4.7560975609756095
