8014876,5,B0001MZ7PK,"Kagome is a normal high school girl, until she falls down a well at her home on her 15th birthday. She climbs out and finds herself in a 16th century Japan where demons run rampant. She is pursued by a centipede demon and finds herself clinging to a boy stuck to a tree. He wakes up and tells her if she removes him from the tree, he will kill the monster. He makes good on the promise. While the fight goes on a jewel comes out of Kagome's side. It has the power to make any demon or human immeasurable powerful. That makes it a hot commodity. While retrieving the jewel, Kagome breaks it, and the shards are scattered throughout the country. Inuyasha and Kagome must work together to find them all and keep them out of the hands of evil doers.

Once again, Inuyahsa is unable to control his demon power. The power of his sword is too strong to wield. The only way to overcome it, is to surpass his father's strength. The best way to do that is to kill the demon that killed Inuyasha's father. So off they go to defeat Ryukotsusei.

This anime is a legend. If there is someone out there who hasn't seen it, they need to remedy that situation as soon as possible. This series has everything. Drama, action, comedy, suspense, and romance. It is a fairy tale that you will never forget. The animation, voice acting, and soundtrack are also unforgettable. This anime is one of the best ever, and a must see for anime fans of all ages.",1353283200,,1431,4.335820895522388
8014877,5,B0001MZ7PK,"I'd say ""The Demon Within"" episode is the first of the third season cause Adult Swim showed this episode first to start new episodes. Inuyasha is fighting this big moth dragon like demon named Ryukotsugei, the same demon Inuyasha's father imprisoned long ago. It was the last time that Inuyasha had transformed into his full demon blood when he was fighting the big monster once Inuyasha grab his Tetsusagia he changed back into a half demon then for the first time he learn the backlash wave then the defeated the monster. He also learn how to use the windscare anytime he wants. And his swoard got lighter.",1121472000,2,608,4.691588785046729
8014878,5,B0001MZ7PK,"this is one of the best volumes i have so far.  InuYasha has yet another problem.  he is not able to control himself.  what is wrong w/ him?  purchase this DVD and find out.  :)

8014879,5,B0001MZ7PK,"Episode 52, A Demon's True Nature is the most appealing of the three episodes, particularly after the very disgusting moth-demon is disposed of.  Half demon Inu Yasha gives a glimpse of what he really would be like if he were to fulfill his quest to become a full demon, and suffice to say it isn't pretty, and the body count is high.  He pretends to be brave about it afterwards, but Kagome's ""Don't kid yourself"" and the dialogue that follows is some of the most honest and moving of any episode.  This one just gets better and better as it continues.

The next two episodes, 53 and 54, set the tone for a number of future episodes, which is both good and bad.  The musical score gets increasingly rich, and the animation is as good as ever.  We also get to find out about the demon-dragon, or dragon-demon, Ryukotusei, that appears in the end-credits along with Inu Yasha's brother in a number of early episodes.  But what unfolds is fairly predictable.  It boils down to another ""what new neat thing can we make Inu Yasha's sword Tetsusaiga do"".  Ok ok, wind scar, backlash wave, we get it already, it's one powerful sword.  Inu Yasha will emerge signficantly more powerful than he was before.  The question is, is he now more powerful than his father, or does he yet have to accomplish more?

The original elements that made the series so interesting, the Arch Demon Naraku, Sango's little brother, Inu Yahsa's lost love Kikyo, even Kagome's family, all seem to have faded into the background while more and more second-rank antagonists, allies, and others appear on the scene.  Even the quest to retrieve the shards of the sacred jewel seems to have lost much of its importance.  Still, it is always interesting, visually exciting, the sound is great, and the characters well-rounded.  For episode 52 especially, it's worth the price.

Box cover is a bit of a departure, in that you have only Inu Yasha, no Kagome or other characters, just Ryukotusei.  Extras, as always, are fairly minimal.",1088899200,16,1997,4.70893371757925
8014880,5,B0001MZ7PK,"I saw the first ep where Inu starts battling Ryukotsusai(Father's Old Enemy, Ryu-), but I missed the Backlash Wave, then saw The Stone Flower. I must say, Father's Old Enemy and The Stone Flower were wonderful episodes, especially since The Stone Flower was based around a cute little Shippo romance! Even though Inu Yasha's my second favorite anime, the whole Inu/Kik/Kag love triagle gets a tad boring, correct? I alreadt preordered it, so I want it soon! Buh-Bye!",1085270400,3,466,4.987179487179487
8014881,5,B0001MZ7PK,"Ah, the new episodes of Inu-Yasha are out on DVD already! The first two involving Ryokutsei were very interesting and are important as far as the storyline is concerned. ""The Stone Flower and Shippo's First Love"" was an interesting eipsode because it strays from the normal battles or Inu/Kag/Kikyo triangle (or anything else concerning Inu-Yasha's love life). In fact, I think this is the first episode where the writers even cared about Shippo since his introduction. What I liked the most about the eip. is how it showed the characters- normally. No battles or angst, and as much as I love both, it was a good change",1084060800,4,619,4.794392523364486
8014882,5,B0001MZ7PK,"Inuyasha and Miroku are still trapped in that possin cocon (sorry if my spelling is not good).  Inuyasha then transforms into his demon self yet again.  He and the moth demon then begin to fight.  Sesshomaru, but of coarse, makes his apperence.  Will Inuyasha kill his own brother?  What will Sesshomaru do to his little bro?  After the epic battle Kagome tells Inuyasha about Tetsiga and his demon side.  He seeks guideiness from the maker of the sword, Totosai.  Myoga is still hanging out with Totosai and gets yelled at because of unsared knowlegde.  Inuyasha now is sent to battle Ryukotsusei one of Inutaisho's (Inuyasha's father's) Old enimies.  What will happen to Inuyasha?  Will he be able to Keep his demon self under control?  And what is Naraku up to these day's?",1080518400,,776,4.795454545454546
8014883,5,B0001MZ7PK,I am sooo happy that there are going to be more volumes!  Only the first episode has been shown in english but I've seen the other two in japanese!  For all InuYasha fans - you need to see this!  I personally love it when InuYasha transforms into Youkai form and he does in 2 out of 3 episodes!  It has action and everything!,1078444800,6,325,4.111111111111111
