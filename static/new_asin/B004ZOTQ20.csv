4510552,4,B004ZOTQ20,"I have bought a few pregnancy exercise dvds with this pregnancy (this is my 3rd).  I like that the cardio and toning feel like I'm actually doing something, yet I don't worry that I'm going to injure myself.  This is my favorite one out of the 3 that I've purchased.  The only downside is they mention a yoga routine for each trimester, but it's not included with this set.",1363824000,3,373,4.3768115942028984
4510553,5,B004ZOTQ20,I'm in my first trimester and this DVD got my heart rate up and made me sweat. There 3 different girls you can exercise according to how you feel.,1361577600,,146,4.068965517241379
4510554,4,B004ZOTQ20,"I bought this DVD set in my second trimester.  Having worked out before pregnancy, I just jumped into the second trimester DVD with no issues.  Wish it had a bit more to it-my heart rate didn't get up where I wanted it.  Haven't done any of the other workouts yet so I can't rate those.
Pros:
The arm toning exercises are great.
Nice to show some modifications, however camera view sometimes cuts to them instead of showing the entire move before modifications.

Cons:
Lindsay keeps on mentioning a yoga workout on these dvd's but there isn't one except for the postnatal bootcamp.  I was really disappointed with that.  From what I can tell, these trimester DVDs are paired up with a Yoga DVD in other packages.  I had loved doing yoga prior to pregnancy and my lower back has been really tight.  I could have used the prenatal yoga instruction.
Music is a bit cheesy but that's what you get with exercise videos.",1315353600,5,914,4.564417177914111
4510555,2,B004ZOTQ20,"I bought this on a whim and now I wish I hadn't wasted the money. Before getting pregnant, I worked out every day for about an hour. Mostly HIIT training, obviously when pregnant, you have to pull back, but this is not a good DVD for anyone who was remotely active before getting pregnant. My heart rate never got past a 2 on the perceived exertion chart. This would be a good DVD set for women who want to BECOME active during pregnancy, but not for women have worked out before. I am now in my 3rd trimester and it is still way too easy. Erin O'Brien, Summer Sanders, and Hot Mamas all have DVDs that are better for strength and cardio.",1400112000,,638,4.237704918032787
4510556,5,B004ZOTQ20,"I bought this during my first trimester and used throughout the entire pregnancy up until 1 week before giving birth. I love how she instructs you how to modify and go at your own pace. She also teaches and explains which exercises are specifically good for pregnancy and baby-care i.e. strengthening you to pick-up the baby, pick-up the infant carrier and work your back muscles for nursing. She is gentle on the core as well, of course.

I started post-natal boot camp 2 weeks after giving birth (I did not have a c-section). It's great how the work-outs are 10 minutes long so you can do 1 or a few, depending on how much time you have. I lost all the weight by 4 months post-natal and lost a few more pounds since then. I truly believe that was due to maintaining a moderate activity level during pregnancy with this set, going to yoga, and walking the baby. I HIGHLY HIGHLY HIGHLY recommend this set!!",1399334400,,906,4.490909090909091
4510557,1,B004ZOTQ20,Nothing against the maker of this work out. I was just hoping for something more challenging. I felt like I was just walking with a few weights in my hand. I get the same work out playing with my kids so I never use it. I would recommend this for someone who never works out or moves at all. If you live an active life style I feel you would get a better workout just doing your daily routine.,1394668800,,393,3.9873417721518987
4510558,4,B004ZOTQ20,"I'm really loving this set...I feel like I'm getting a great workout without over doing it. However, during the 2nd trimester DVD she mentions several times that there is a yoga portion and that it should be included in your weekly workout...Not sure where it is...but the only yoga session I've found is on the Postnatal Bootcamp...which really doesn't help at 6 months :o/",1389657600,,374,4.859375
4510559,1,B004ZOTQ20,I don't feel like I'm doing anything at all.  I feel like this can be more challenging and it just doesn't do anything for me.  And I find her to be too annoying!  I'm used to Jillian Michaels.  So the cutesy sayings and non-stop fake smiles make me want to scream.  But that's just me.,1384992000,,286,4.127272727272727
4510560,4,B004ZOTQ20,"I like the instructor a lot. I also like the fact that it's about 30 min. long and has weight training along with cardio. I feel like I'm not overdoing it, but also getting a great workout!",1372377600,,189,4.135135135135135
4510561,5,B004ZOTQ20,"I absolutely LOVE this pregnancy workout.  It gets your heart rate up and makes you feel like you're really exercising (not ""pregnancy"" exercising) - but there are alternative moves if you feel like it's too much, if you're nervous about the baby, or if you're just really tired one day.  I read the reviews before I purchased it, and she does say the term ""buncakes"" kind of often (referring to your butt), which is kinda weird, but it just doesn't bother me.  She's upbeat but not super annoying - although I do find it odd that she's really pregnant on the cover, sort of pregnant in the intro, and then not at all pregnant during the actual workout segments, but oh well.  (If that makes you uncomfortable, the others girls in the video ARE actually pregnant, so don't worry; you're not alone.)  :]

She references a yoga workout which doesn't seem to be included with my set, but I have a different pregnancy pilates workout that I use to break it up or get extra stretching in.  There are separate workouts for each trimester and a postnatal workout.  As of today, I've done the first two trimesters and I love them both; they run around 35 min each, and they have a good amount of stuff for your arms and your thighs/butt.  I honestly think I've toned up more since I found out I was pregnant again and starting doing this.

I would recommend this to anyone who was at least moderately working out before getting pregnant.  It was definitely worth the money for me.",1370736000,,1472,4.516981132075472
4510562,4,B004ZOTQ20,"I bought this when I was late 1st trimester - early 2nd trimester. I did the 1st trimester workout for a while, then moved to the 2nd trimester workout for a while. By 3rd trimester, I was getting tired easy, but still did the 3rd trimester workout weekly. I also walked about 3 miles a day during this time. While these may be too easy for someone who was into hard core workouts before, for someone starting back after a year off and pregnant to boot, they worked for me. I had blood pressure issues and lots of diabetes in my family, so this plus walking helped keep my bp normal and I think it helped keep gestational diabetes from becoming an issue for me.

The Boot Camp DVD is awesome! This set is worth it for this DVD alone! Go to Lindsay Brin's Boot Camp DVD page on Amazon and read all the reviews of this DVD. It has a warm up, six 3 min core exercises, ten 10 min exercises, and a cool down. There is a quick start program where you can choose how long you want your workout to be and choose from there. There is also a 12 week program that starts out at 20 min and increases over time. I am on week 6 and have lost 10 lbs so far.

I think the only reason this set is cheaper than buying each dvd or the other set is that its packaging is slightly different and that it does not contain the yoga sessions. I'm not that into yoga, so just the workouts plus walking was enough for me :) But seriously, after doing this Boot Camp DVD, I've already got Lindsay's Pretty Fierce workouts to try next! I can't wait to not only get back to pre-pregnancy shape, but to get into even better shape than I was before!",1367971200,3,1618,4.117088607594937
4510563,3,B004ZOTQ20,"The instructor is very nice and encouraging but the actual routine was pretty boring. She kept mentioning the Yoga session, but I couldn't find it anywhere on the DVD's.
If you have none or limited experience with exercising in the past, then this DVD will help, otherwise it's a good warm up.",1365120000,,293,4.653846153846154
4510564,3,B004ZOTQ20,"The DVDs are not really meant for someone who was decently fit before pregnancy. They barely got my heart pumping and I didn't once sweat. I felt like I was hardly working out at all and really considered just going back to normal work out DVDs.

Other Bad bits:
They'd frequently change the camera shot before completely showing the move, so I'd often be left hanging while doing parts of the workout. Also, she'd wait to add special safety tips like ""do not lock out the knees"" or ""be sure to bend the elbow slightly"" near the end of the set. It's okay to skip inane chit-chat to put in important safety tips.

ALSO, she frequently states that one should do cardio/weights days 1, 3, and 5 and yoga on 2 and 4. THERE IS NO YOGA workout on the prenatal sections. Apparently the deluxe package comes with a 20-25min yoga workout for each trimester that is not included in the cheaper set. It is completely unprofessional and unacceptable to not edit that tidbit out when repackaging for a different assortment. They even claim to offer yoga on the back of the DVD in the second trimester section, which is a lie. Offering it in one version does not mean they can say they have it in another.

Overall, it's cheap via Amazon and Target, so I gave it 3 stars, but I would have done better getting a DVD work/out set that was COMPLETE and a challenge for more money over one that isn't complete nor a challenge. Unfortunately, I'm now weary of buying any other DVDs for pregnancy as they too might be sub-par or a scam.",1364428800,,1516,4.426523297491039
8450316,3,B004ZOTQ20,"The toning and cardio portions are good, but beware it does not include the yoga segment, as stated.",1500940800,,100,4.611111111111111

8450321,5,B004ZOTQ20,"I've only done the first trimester video, but it is my favorite prenatal workout that I have bought! I feel like I get a good workout without killing myself, and am mildly sore he day after doing the visor. She constantly tells you if you need a break to take it, and was encouraging throughout without being annoying. I will review the other sections as I get to them. (There is 1st tri, 2nd tri, 3rd tri, and after baby). Totally worth buying, this video has helped me stay active when all I want to do is crash on the couch lol. I have only managed to do it about once a week instead of my normal 3x week schedule but I am trying not to be too hard on myself.  Hopefully my second trimester won't be so exhausting! :)",1462752000,,720,4.142857142857143
8450322,5,B004ZOTQ20,These dvds really kept me up and going during my pregnancy. I started my day off with them and sometimes ended with them too. Not too crazy and never left me feeling exhausted.,1444780800,,176,4.363636363636363

8450324,3,B004ZOTQ20,"Overall, the video is ok. I normally worked out before my pregnancy, but I was trying to take it easy so I wanted to switch to a pregnancy workout. The exercises are a bit boring, particularly the second trimester. If you are used to working out everyday, this DVD may be a bit boring. With that said, I haven't used the post pregnancy workout yet (I'm still pregnant), so perhaps my opinion will change.",1421971200,,404,4.472972972972973
8450325,5,B004ZOTQ20,"I have a 9 week old and did the entire set of pregnancy videos until week 36. I rotated this with a separate yoga video and it worked well. I'm used to pushing myself so thought the prego videos were a little wimpy at first but they get harder as you get bigger. I did not plan on using the postnatal boot camp and started a different workout regimen. I had done this for about two weeks when I threw in the boot camp to a supplemental workout. Wow!! Not what I expected in a good way!! It is an entire program, not just one workout. I have used this dad three times and love it!! Hard core for those who want to push themselves! I'm going to use this now instead of the other program I was using.",1418774400,,697,4.0215827338129495
