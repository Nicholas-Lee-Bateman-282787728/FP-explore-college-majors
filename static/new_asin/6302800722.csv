516489,3,6302800722,"This was a movie I happened to see on television 20 years ago and enjoyed.  I tried to find it to rent but no one ever had it so I purchased it and I'm glad to have it.  The principles were in their fifties when they made this but still themselves so if you are fans you will perhaps appreciate them.  It was filmed in Gatlinburg, TN which is beautiful so the scenery is lovely.  Virginia Gregg and Fritz Weaver are wonderful as the spouses.

The plot is an old one.  City couple comes to the country, country man falls in love and pursues city woman.  City man is preoccupied, country woman appears a bit dull.  Country couple's adult son is a bully and womanizer. City couple's grown daughter is demanding.  The lovers appear to be star-crossed and so one can imagine how it ends.  Not the best work for either Ingrid Bergman or Anthony Quinn, still I like it.",1321488000,,862,4.33125

516491,4,6302800722,"After reading the video box description of this movie, I expected to find a bored wife of an ego-maniac college professor bore finding her true love at long last. What one discovers early in the movie, however, is that Fritz Weaver, her husband, is no ego-maniac, and certainly does not ignore or neglect his wife, even while working on his book. In fact, the idea that Anthony Quinn was finally offering Ingrid Bergman true love ended up seeming quite laughable to me. Her marriage was closer to ""true love"" than her affair with a mountain man in Tennessee, in my opinion.

And casting Anthony Quinn as a Tennessee native also ended up seeming laughable to me. I'm guessing the only reason he was casted as such, was because anyone who actually seemed like a real Tennessee mountain man, would in no way on God's earth attract the likes of Ingrid Bergman!

Ingrid Bergman was bored...probably more from being stuck in the role of a college professor's wife, always on school schedules, than from being married to Fritz Weaver.  What I believe she actually loved in Tennesee, far more than Anthony Quinn, was the ""farm life"" and being close to nature...far away from the city and rigid schedules of having to be at certain places at certain times.

The end came fast. And it was not totally predictable. The movie was a nice leisurely one to watch, both for the characters and for the scenery.  And I always love movies with rain in them.

But I have one big question about this movie--where in the world was David Opatoshu???",1158278400,7,1526,4.675373134328358
516492,4,6302800722,This is one of my very favourite movies.  A passionate love story between 50-somethings?  Very rare and done very convincingly and memorably in this film.  The end is disappointing but that's life.  This movie really captured my heart and soul  --  very well directed and acted.  Unique.

516493,3,6302800722,"I must disagree with what Maltin wrote in his summary, about expecting much more from the cast. I think Bergman and Quinn did a fine job with the script that they were given. The pace was a bit slow in certain scenes, but that was the whole idea, since most of the story was taking place in the Tennessee mountains where everything is quite and serene. When the title indicated that Bergman was paired off with Quinn for this drama, I wasn't certain if Quinn would be the best match to act opposite Ingrid. However, after watching the entire movie, one gets to realize that he was perfect for the role and appreciate him even more. And even if I took a wild guess now, I wouldn't be able to pick a different actor that could portray Will Cade better than Quinn did. I highly recommend viewers to give this movie a chance.",980985600,14,821,4.372549019607843

516561,1,6302800722,"As someone who lives in East Tennessee and loves the beauty of Cades Cove, this film makes no sense at all. Words like silly and embarrassing come first to mind. Nothing works here- not the script, the actors, the background, the editing.... nothing. It is as if the writer and director were trying to force upon the film some scenario intended to evoke emotion, or maybe, teach a lesson.  But even the beautiful mountain scenery can't save this film. In fact the beauty of the place provides a contrast, a backdrop for the overall failure of the film. The best parts of this film are scenes of the little goats.  If it has any good use it would be to demonstrate how otherwise talented people can make such a mess of things. It certainly isn't entertaining, and, in the end, it all comes off as.... well, a dog of a film.",1414281600,,822,4.437086092715232
516572,5,6302800722,"***SPOILERS FOLLOW***  Perceptive, character-driven story of two 50-somethings drawn to each other despite their differences and the risks involved.  The chemistry between Ingrid Bergman and Anthony Quinn is potent.  SO nice to see people over 50 depicted as individuals and not mere shadows of younger people or their former selves, indeed, age per se has little to do with it (except regarding complex relations with grown children).

Quinn is perfectly cast as a mountain man, a free spirit, a force of nature, a man utterly devoid of artifice or guile.  Weaver, as Bergman's husband, a professor and writer, is repressed, worried about his career, out of steam, and mostly self-absorbed, while Quinn is the polar opposite.  Bergman comes alive in the beautiful mountain setting, becoming attuned to the natural world.

Though released in 1970, surprisingly, the film hasn't aged much, except that the jury was still out on whether women should devote themselves utterly to husbands and children.  Though a common occurrence, stories involving older people powerfully attracted to each other are few and far between; this reminded me a bit of&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Bridges-of-Madison-County/dp/B00JMY10YU/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Bridges of Madison County</a>.

As in that show (and Last Tango in Halifax, come to think of it), several other nuanced, interwoven themes come into play here too, handled in just as natural a way as the romance- e.g., cultural differences, class differences, and the pressures of parenthood.

After watching this, I read several reviews on IMDB in which reviewers likened it to&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Deliverance/dp/B001EBV0LW/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Deliverance</a>.  These are folks not given to subtlety, obviously, because it bore only a remote, superficial resemblance, if any.  There's a hint at the beginning that Quinn may be a dangerous character, but the mountain dwellers in the film evince a wide range of reactions to their circumstances, indeed, reactions mirrored by those in urban environs, e.g., drinking too much in response to won't and lack of opportunity, turning obsessively to religion to cope with hardships, children blaming parents for their lots in life, etc.  For the most part the locals were hospitable, friendly, and welcomed visitors, rather than hating (and hunting!) them, so the comparison is wholly unwarranted, IMO.  This film is a compelling drama, character study and love story.

The movie treats its subject matter with sensitivity and subtlety- is affecting, bittersweet, with beautiful scenery and wonderful performances by the leads- and while it doesn't have the formulaic, storybook ending some might expect, it's fitting.  What I thought it did best was capture the experience of falling in love- the wonder, the ache of desire, the world coming alive when you're together, the deep concern for the other, the angst (another film that well expresses the ineffable qualities of romantic love, for me one of the best ever at doing so, is&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Prelude-to-a-Kiss/dp/B00D3LA6SY/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Prelude to a Kiss</a>).

516580,4,6302800722,"This movie is about a real life situation that occurred in middle Tennessee, not in the
smoky mountains.  My uncle was the man that had an affair with Rachel Maddox (her pen name) and Anthony Quinn was chosen because he and my uncle are spitting images of each other.  The affair went on for quite some time.
It's true that the author moved here from New York, if my memory serves me
correctly her husband was not a professor at a university.  It is true that my uncle gave her
some goats and they also had chickens, ducks, and numerous others as well.
The movie was good brought back memories of the scandal it caused in this small rural place.
All of it actually occurred in Houston County Tennessee.  The part about the son being killed
by Workman was fiction, although his son did go to see her wanting ""some of what his daddy had
been getting.""  This occurred in the late 1950's and early 60's.

Overall it is an excellent movie about real life situations.",1355011200,,961,4.431818181818182
