3948092,5,B002LH42H2,"I did enjoy this!  I thought Rosalind Russell's character should be the one to slow down Errol Flynn but with Olivia de Havilland also in the mix, I couldn't be sure.",1383955200,,166,4.354838709677419
3948093,4,B002LH42H2,"It's a different look at Flynn; not so much soft focus.  This is a period piece, and I find it interesting, entertaining.  My only criticism would be that the story gets stretched out too long, and loses momentum.",1381017600,,213,4.578947368421052
3948094,4,B002LH42H2,This movie isn't shown on TV like others. It's a typical cute movie for its time. Error and Olivia were cute in those days.,1375488000,,123,4.166666666666667
3948095,5,B002LH42H2,"You never seen a paper ran this way before,nor seen how cut throat and funny the newspaper life could ever be.",1365206400,,110,4.285714285714286
3948096,4,B002LH42H2,"Rarely seen but very underrated Flynn Comedy.  Must distance yourself from Swashbuckler mold but plenty to like with rollicking good fun.  Errol's timing is wonderful as a publicist who falls for his most difficult client's daughter but it's a shame he was typecast away from this kind of film.  In the vein of ""The Thin Man"".  Directed by Micheal Curtiz, star-studded plus strong supporting roles with Franklin Pangborn and that wicked witch, Margaret Hamilton.  Reviews then and to a certain extent, even now, aren't favorable but I disagree.  Some clever moments between Flynn and Walter Connelly.",1281312000,2,600,5.197916666666667
3948097,4,B002LH42H2,"This is one of the most underrated comedies of the 30s. Errol Flynn on top of his form, gorgeous, charming and funny. His comic timing is perfect, he could be as a great as Cary Grant or Gary Cooper, if he would be given a chance to play more roles like this. Olivia de Havilland is great also. Solid supporting cast, cheek-to-tongue dialog, quick pace. Be warned, though, that DVD is bare bones: no extras, no captions, no scene selection even.",1274054400,9,445,4.506172839506172
3948098,5,B002LH42H2,"This movie has been long waiting for any Olivia and Errol fans. It is a shame these two did not do more comedy together. They are really fun to watch. The movie is typical 30's screwball comedy, so popular at that time. it is fast paced and witty humor though out. What i don't like is there are no extras of the making of it, and Warners did not take the time or care to restore this film as much as others like ""The Adventures of Robin Hood"". Still this is very much worth watching. Olivia and Errol out of  their usual costume dramas, and into something contemporary for its time.
I highly recommend it. Also look for the little terrier in the movie. It is the same dog who played Asta in all the old Thin Man Movies, Bringing up Baby and many more",1274054400,8,751,4.179310344827586
3948099,1,B002LH42H2,"This DVD was manufactured to be played on a ""play only"" machine.  It will not play on a ""play/record"" machine.  It states this fact in small print on the back cover.  This should be made known to the person buying same to avoid disappointment and the necessity of sending the DVD back.  I would have wanted to know this before I purchased the product.",1264809600,4,351,4.4375
3948100,4,B002LH42H2,"Four's A Crowd is a fast paced romantic comedy in much the same vein as ""His Girl Friday"" and ""Bringing Up Baby"".  Errol Flynn plays a public relations expert who takes on the job of improving the reputation of a cantankerous old millionaire.  Olivia de Havilland and Rosalind Russell are rivals for Errol's affections, with competition from Patric Knowles.  It's great to see Errol in a change of pace to his usual roles in swashbucklers and westerns.  He handles this role with much enthusiasm, energy and charm.  It's a pity his film career gave him little opportunity to further develop his comedic talent.

The picture and sound quality on this DVD are a far cry from Warner's usual high standard.  No restoration is evident with practically every frame showing scratches, stains, white flecks and other debris, and with occasional pops and drop outs occurring in the sound.  For the most part the picture is sharp and shows good detail, but some scenes look decidedly off-focus.  Blacks are solid, whites clean and there is good range in gray scale.  The DVD contains a theatrical trailer for the film, there are no subtitles or scene selections, and the disc is region free.  Entertainment value 6/10, picture quality 5/10, sound quality 7/10.",1259884800,26,1250,4.9330143540669855

8373088,5,B002LH42H2,I have always been a big Errol Flynn fan. It is nice to own one of his movies that is rarely shown on TV. Especially for Olivia De Havilland's 100th birthday!,1467158400,,158,4.129032258064516

8373091,3,B002LH42H2,"When you bring together big name stars sometimes it still doesn't cover a bad script.  The plot here is not bad with Flynn playing the two-timing newspaper/public relations man, but the script just doesn't deliver the laughs.  Even reliable comedy stalwarts like Melville Cooper just don't get chances to shine.  There is too much dialog from the start and what could have been a smart comedy like other later Rosalind Russell outings bounces more toward a failed screwball type.  For better comedy choices around this time see ""It's Love I'm After"" with Dehavilland & Knowles or ""Hard to Get"" which also has Dehavilland with Dick Powell and a better supporting role from Melville Cooper.  I also highly recommend Dehavilland in ""the Great Garrick"", which is an overlooked classic.",1415318400,,781,5.0703125
8373092,5,B002LH42H2,"Bought this, along with a few other Flynn movies, for my husband.  He said the quality of the film was great and he is very pleased with it.",1403827200,,140,4.0
8373093,3,B002LH42H2,I ordered this because I adore Rosalind Russell but the acting was a bit wooden and the plot not as amusing as I'd hoped it would be.,1400716800,,133,3.962962962962963
