2411338,5,B000BBSA14,"This collection is a must have for anyone interested in the Blue Angels or really, any precision demonstration flying team.  The team is sharp and well trained and the video shows a lot about how they get that way.",1173916800,2,214,4.487179487179487
2411339,5,B000BBSA14,"Having seen this series on the Military Channel I knew what I was getting. A comprehensive look at the Blues in selection, training, preparation, and performing. Truly the Blues are greater than the sum of their parts. Highly recommended.",1163030400,2,238,5.128205128205129
2411340,5,B000BBSA14,"This is an excellent DVD - the resolution and audio are superb and showed up brilliantly on my 72"" television. If you've just bought a big plasma or rear projector, you'll love this 2 disc set.

But it's not about production values. The story is also compelling and gives you a real insight into the way these guys think, how they train, are selected, what can go wrong, the enormous amount of preparation and maintenance that goes into keeping a team such as the Blue Angels at the top of their game.

The pilots come across as real people - they may be talented and presentable, but they are also human and make errors and find their roles stressful and demanding.

The video of the routines, both from the ground and in the air, is amazing - it goes right inside the diamond formation, and you realize just how close these planes actually fly - a hair's breadth from disaster at times.

I bought the original Rolling Thunder in the 80s and on a scale of 1 to 100, Rolling Thunder is about 5 and Blue Angels: A Year in the Life is about 250.

Would recommend it to flying enthusiasts and lovers of military life in particular, but also to anybody who has a casual interest in what makes special people such as fighter pilots tick. If you want just airshow porn, it's probably going to bore you at times. But if you want some more insight, it's hard to go past this 2-disc set.",1159142400,15,1378,4.3671875
2411341,4,B000BBSA14,"For pure Airshow Junkies, there is too much filler, way too much. However there is a lot of Airshow too. Starting with the air show the DVD is of high quality and is filmed very professionally giving the airshow enthusiast a real feal for the being ""in the cockpit"" experience and the stunning visual show. The colors and the contrasts of the filming with the ground,sea and the sky are both breathtaking and awesome. The Blue Angels Aerobatic display team are the creme de la creme, they are without a doubt the premier fliers for our times to enjoy. They are truly deserving of praise and respect for their devotion and giving for their nation and its people. Their devotion shows in their flying and their personalities. This is an airshow DVD with an airshow so Airshow Junkies, you get your wish. ""Blue Angels - A year in the life"" is also a documentary. The producers provide an in-depth study and visual showing of the lives of the Blue Angels team with a behind the scenes look at all the facets of the airshow life. The DVD is a must for the documentary experience and a great show for the whole family. Young and old alike, the whole family will enjoy this very,very well done contribution to the aviation documentaries. All in all there is something for everyone that is for sure. You can't go wrong with adding this DVD to your collection, it's a must have.",1140825600,15,1369,4.5465587044534415
2411342,5,B000BBSA14,"I am biased in opinion as my wife's cousin is one of the 'Newbies' pilots, but this is a spectacular DVD.  The flying is awesome and inspires a desire to fly in everyone.  The Blue Angel pilots are unbelieveable!  Terrific photography, great action!",1140393600,5,249,4.744186046511628
2411343,5,B000BBSA14,"This DVD is amazing!  Perfectly puts the Blues on display through the high-points and the low points of the season.  The best thing about this dvd, besides the flying, is the respect they show the crew.  Yeah, the pilots get the glory and do the high flying cool stuff, but, they are FAAAAR from the stars of the show!  The maintainers and support people behind the flying is where the stars hide.  This dvd also shines the light on the pilots and what they do.  They truly go through the mill, but, they don't do a single thing with those Blue jets if the crew does not do their job perfectly.  This is FINALLY a dvd that shines the light on the pilots, BUT, makes it clear that nothing happens without the crew in support of the pilots.  Great Job!!!
  Unlike the retired one who reviewed also (great review by the way!!!!), I would not like to be a pilot after seeing this!  I would rather get FAAAR more reward working in my support role and knowing that the pilot gets his glory only because my ability to do the work allows it.",1133308800,7,1033,4.300518134715026
2411344,5,B000BBSA14,"This is REAL. It accurately shows the unique blend of hard work, attention to detail, and dare devil spirit embodied in every Navy pilot. This DVD goes behind and into the scenes and experiences that have caused Navy Aircraft Carrier pilots to be ranked as the absolute BEST in the World. The BLUE ANGLES are the very BEST of the BEST.

Where is the recruiter? I am ready to start a new career as a Navy Pilot with a goal of becoming a Blue Angel.

More Stars are needed to rate this DVD. On a scale of 1 to 10 I'd give it 100.

Reality just set in. It is too late for me to start a new career as a Navy pilot. I'll just have to watch this again and again. I hope that you enjoy this as much as I am enjoying it.

2411355,5,B000BBSA14,Wonderful look into the lives of the aviators that thrill millions,1407628800,,66,5.090909090909091
2411356,5,B000BBSA14,Superb documentary with outstanding video footage.  A great tribute to America's finest aerobatic show team proving that real pilots wear Gold Wings.  Fly NAVY.,1396396800,,160,5.625
2411357,5,B000BBSA14,My husband like this video and has watched it over and over again. With my husband being a pilot himself. Thank you for fine service.,1390694400,,133,4.36
2411358,5,B000BBSA14,Bought for my son-in-law and he loves it!! Best Christmas present I could have got for him. A must purchase for any Airshow enthusiast!!!,1390608000,,137,4.75
2411359,4,B000BBSA14,This inside look at the routine of the hotest pilots on the planet was eye opening.  The preparation and team spirit of the entire group from the pilots to the aircraft technicians was a joy to watch. Amazing how these people go about their routine to be the premiere recruitment tool for the U.S. Navy and Marine Corp.  Boss was the kind of boss everyone wanted to work for in the military. I was U.S. Airforce for over eight years (air traffic controller) and the team work displayed by these warriors was breathtaking. The DVD showed inside looks at how the Blue Angels have become the worlds' best acrobatic demo team barring none.  This is one of my prizes in my DVD collection.,1388448000,,683,4.536585365853658
2411360,5,B000BBSA14,I bought this for my 4 year old grandson who is a Blue Angels fanatic. He watches it constantly. It was the perfect birthday present.,1374192000,,133,4.36
2411361,5,B000BBSA14,I've watched it at least 25 times and it never grows old...  The dynaminics of the program are execellent...  Just LOVE IT...,1371340800,,125,4.636363636363637
2411362,5,B000BBSA14,"This was on my son Chreistmas list he is so into all kinds of planes.
 He loves it very much.",1356566400,,93,3.65
2411363,3,B000BBSA14,"I thought there would be more flying sequences as well as more of the ""how to"" of the aircraft maneuvers themselves. I guess being a pilot made me expect more.

Nothing wrong with the 2-DVD set, but if you can find it for rent, do that. It's one of those DVDs I'll never watch again.  In fact, it will probably end up on Amazon for sale soon.

The 37-minute ""The Magic of Flight"" is also just fair, but it's only $14.  Its only redeeming value is that it's Blu-Ray and eye-poppingly vivid.  As one reviewer noted, however, they've dampened the sound so much that the aircraft sound wimpy.

Sigh...it, too, will end up for sale.",1343174400,,627,4.408695652173913
2411364,4,B000BBSA14,"I enjoyed seeing this DVD, depicting the daily life of the Blue Angels pilots nicely and attractively. Good flight scenes and a lot of patrotism are part of these scenes.",1321920000,,170,4.7
2411365,5,B000BBSA14,"A Year in the Life summarizes the behind the scenes footage of the Blue Angels as they go about their air show season under Boss Russ Bartlett. It is an excellent DVD for anyone who wants to learn more about the Blue Angels, their maneuvers. It also has excellent in-cockpit footage of the Blue Angels F-18's. In summary, it is a great DVD and it is a must-have for any Blue Angels fan.",1320796800,,386,4.301369863013699
2411366,5,B000BBSA14,"Excellent documentary of the day to day experience. One gets the feeling that given the events, a pilot dropping out early, the hurricane, etc, that there was more emotion and tension than was depicted. Regardless, a very impressive look at what it takes to achieve that level of competence and ability. The focus, discipline, teamwork, self evaluation, patience, coordination, trust, willingness to subordinate self to the mission/group, truly exceptional!!! I use this documentary in my work with organizations to depict what is possible for organizations to achieve. The flying shots are great as well.",1297123200,,605,5.446808510638298
2411367,5,B000BBSA14,"This video is excellent! It's very informative about what it takes to become one of the finest. Just buy it, you won't regret it. :)",1294272000,,132,4.32
2411368,5,B000BBSA14,"Like I said in the title, I'd love to be able to review the product, however it's been over a month since it was purchased and we still don't have it :-(

Am about to contact Amazon with this issue and see if it can be resolved.",1294099200,,228,3.851063829787234
2411369,5,B000BBSA14,"First of all, when it comes to the Blue Angels, it's hard to make a bad movie. That said, this is easily the best of the lot. It takes an in-depth look at the inner workings of the team while also providing plenty of visceral flying thrills. What I want to know is why this isn't available on DVD yet? I would repurchase this in an instant to get all that great footage in high-def!",1294012800,,382,4.1066666666666665
2411370,5,B000BBSA14,"Nicely created!  Sounds great w/surround sound, but nothing replaces attending one of their shows.  Went to Pensacola this summer and was able to meet and have pictures taken w/the pilots in the Naval Museum following the show.  I became instantly hooked, which brought me to purchasing this DVD.  Don't buy this DVD if you're looking for the complete demo/show.  This DVD supplements and provides an insight to the whole Blue Angel's experience from the selection process on.  If you end up purchasing this DVD and have not seen them live, I highly recommend you round out your curiosity by attending at least one air show.",1292976000,,624,4.895238095238096
2411371,5,B000BBSA14,"This is a great set.  If you love aircraft flight demonstration teams, and want to know more about them... this is the one to get.  It shows in great detail every aspect of the season (from the application process, getting hired, and following a whole season with the Blue Angels.  It really does cover every aspect of the whole team (not just the pilots, but maintenance crew, support staff, and behind the scenes).  Highly recommended.",1290988800,,437,4.786666666666667
2411372,5,B000BBSA14,"got it for my husbands birthday. he thought it was great
he shows it to anyone that comes over for a visit.
Good and fast service.  very pleased",1290384000,,144,4.142857142857143
2411373,4,B000BBSA14,"I enjoyed this video over the other Blue Angel videos I've seen in the past. There is a little more of the personal experiences of the pilots rather than just sound bites. It also covers other members of the Blue Angel team, like the maintenance personnel. Overall a very good review of the Blue Angels.",1287273600,,303,4.527272727272727
2411374,4,B000BBSA14,This two set discs video is worth the price even if this is the 2006 Blue Angels team. You are really in the team and except for few moments you really are in the action.,1270771200,,170,3.8857142857142857
2411375,5,B000BBSA14,Blue Angels come into town every two years and is so neat to know more about it. Great information. What an awesome job to have!,1262822400,,128,4.16
2411376,4,B000BBSA14,"we purchased this product because our son was just accepted as an enlisted crew member of the Blue Angels.  although the program was focused on the pilots, it still gave us information about what his next three years with the BAs will involve.  Thanks.",1246665600,,252,4.704545454545454
2411377,5,B000BBSA14,we missed a live Blue Angels show so I bought this as a consolation prize-what an eye opening and mind bending insight into their lives - RIP K. DAVIS - awesome DVD set.,1246492800,,169,4.151515151515151
2411378,5,B000BBSA14,"I purchased this DVD 3 years ago. My son and I have watched both DVDs over 50 times. He's 5 yrs old and loves jets! I'm over 40 and love jets. As a former US Army officer, I am proud to say that this DVD illustrates the true professionalism and extreme teamwork that only the US Navy Blue Angels can deliver. The military is presented as America and the world should see it. What an honor to get a peak into the process of becoming a BA member and execute the mission on a daily basis. I have seen the Blues at airshows my entire life, and the DVD puts you in a place that sheds light and insights that any fan of F/A 18s would love. Highly recommended for anyone. Totally appropriate for eyes and ears of little ones too. Its a win-win!!!",1243468800,,739,4.138888888888889
2411379,5,B000BBSA14,"This, in my personal opinion, is absolutely the best documentary I've ever seen thus far.  Everything from the way it was directed, camera angles, narration, background music used and the members of the '04 Blue Angels, made this worth watching over and over.  I'm honestly very happy that I bought this DVD.  And for the reviewer who complained that this DVD shows the Blue Angels actually flying for like 8 min. - are you kidding me?  What in the world is he talking about???  Nothing could be farther from the truth.  Too bad he didn't enjoy it as much as everybody else who watched this, but don't make a false statement like that.  I never knew what goes on behind the scenes, just how someone becomes a Blue Angel and how it is like to be a Blue Angel, but this DVD answered all my questions and more.  I particularly liked one of the Blue Angels, Dan Shipley, his attitude and how he handled things.  The Blue Angels:  A Year In The Life, should definitely be in the collection of anyone who is a Blue Angels fan and is inspired by them!",1221955200,,1044,4.390625
2411380,5,B000BBSA14,"For anyone who likes to know what goes on 'behind the scenes' this is a fascinating video. Everyone knows what the Blue Angels air shows look like, but this video shows you how they pick the pilots, how they train, and what it takes to put on such marvelous shows.  It is too bad that the rating system only has 5 stars. This video scores MUCH higher then just 5.",1220745600,2,363,4.185714285714286
2411381,5,B000BBSA14,"I recommend this 2 series DVD to anyone who is a Blue Angels fan. I recieved autographs from several pilots, including one viewed in ""A Year in a Life,"" and it really made him come to life. This documentary views the Blue Angels in a totally diffrent light as if you were sharing thier experience. It is definetly a must see.",1219363200,2,325,4.344262295081967
2411382,5,B000BBSA14,"The documentary has a slick, fast action packed look about it. The behind the scenes about the training, display sequence and selecting new pilots is second to none. There is even a look at the hard working and often over looked maintenance team.",1184716800,2,246,4.744186046511628
2411383,5,B000BBSA14,"I did not know what to expect from this video.  It was great!  The most heart-wrenching was Major Dan Shipley having to leave for medical reasons.  The flying sequences were amazing, although I noted some editing missteps.  Also, Blue Angel #6, Craig Olson, was a Lt. (Part 1, Becoming Blue) not a Lcdr.  He was not promoted to Lcdr until the 2005 Season.  ( He is currently back on the team as #6. )

I enjoyed seeing the friendships develop and really got a kick out of the way the Blues welcome new team members.

I highly recommend this video.",1183161600,2,547,4.4
2411384,5,B000BBSA14,"I have brought this together with the following:

Fighter Pilot - Operation Red Flag (IMAX)
American Fighter Pilot DVD
The Magic of Flight (IMAX) (2-Disc WMVHD Edition)

I think the Blue Angels: A Year In the Life came on top of my list. It has surprisingly good quality and value. Very interesting story of their year round trip. Great video quality and much longer play time then The Magic of Flight. Hints: get this instead of The Magic of Flight if you are into Blue Angel stuff.

The story tells about the Blue Angels history, their structure including all the frontline and backstage crews. The doc starts with their winter training, then it goes with the ups and downs during their round year airshow and recruitment when near the end of season. All with great detailed and video quality is crisp top-notch.

Oh BTW, I heard that there was an accident in Beaufort that a Blue Angel pilot was killed in action. I wish his family the very best and the pilot RIP.",1177545600,,967,4.572254335260116
