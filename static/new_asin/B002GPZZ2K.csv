8369900,5,B002GPZZ2K,I appreciate the clean way he has  at presenting the blues. It has filled in a gap in my guitar technique. I think truefire is the best at guitar instruction.,1362614400,,158,4.266666666666667
8369901,3,B002GPZZ2K,"with this and the other TrueFire DVDs I have recently bought...

Because they cut down the lessons from the online purchase you make from TrueFire themselves???...meaning I bought this,started watching and practicing along when the video would cut short??? (or somtimes be out of order???)...so i checked on their website and learned they cut all lessons down for the DVDs...

So now I had to buy the computer based FULL COURSE and rewatch????...but trying to loop something on your computer is twice as hard as a DVD player???...how easy is the ""A-B"" switch on my DVD remote!!!!...

The lessons themselves are ok for advanced beginner/intermediate and David himself has several good book/CD and DVDs but LickLibrary products are much better and more thorough....",1320451200,6,763,5.186991869918699
8369902,5,B002GPZZ2K,"Blues Alchemy contains 10 lessons on how to play blues in 10 different styles. Each lessons contains solo and rhythm playing demonstration - both in tempo and played slower - with discussion of each element - showing the fingering and the flow of the music (call-response) very clearly. For both solo and rhythm part there are additional lessons discussing possible variations. Each lesson is available as video and transcription including tablature as PDF. Also as PowerTab files. Generous jam tracks in each style are included.
General approach in Blues Alchemy is to help players transcend playing minor pentatonic scale over entire blues progression. This course will teach you how to switch between major and minor pentatonic sales (and blues scales) to outline the harmony in much more interesting way then using minor pentatonic all the way through. David discusses each style of blues covered and he picked each solo to very clearly demonstrate important aspects that style. This is one of better courses for advanced beginner blues guitarist out there - if you cover several lessons then I bet that you will survive without too much stress playing for the first time at your local blues jam.",1266969600,12,1200,5.096446700507614
