8156242,5,B000KF0DXY,It is something different. It is the vampires coming to the hood. If you want a laugh and not be serious.,1390694400,,105,4.0476190476190474
8156243,2,B000KF0DXY,"This is one of those awkward campy movies that are badly made and edited. In other words this is good ole shlock! (this means cheap and trashy) and the horror category has tons of them.  And few film categories even have endless beyond low budget micro budget movies that are not even at shlock level. and everyone of them usually are less than bad still...  This is like ""dracula 3000"" from the last five years or so ,  or 'doctor orlock and the invisible man"" from 1970 or 'robot monster"" from the 1950's.  How can one describe this shlockfest?
The lead vampire is like a saturday night tv horror host. Those guys and gals are great but they are campy on purpose!.  Like all shlock movies the film is very innept in spite of having lots of good actors in it. And that only adds to it's shlock-o-meter of bizaareness.  Shlock has been around for a long time and many of these movies from the past end up on 'something wierd video"" dvd's some are better than this and some are much worse.  If you like schlocky cheap horror movies that are awkward then you may enjoy this one.",1258156800,,1076,4.376884422110553
8156244,1,B000KF0DXY,"Just read the two below this one.  I caught the last 30 minutes on cable waiting for something else to start, and everthing except the bald guy is grade-school amateur stuff.",1249257600,,174,4.612903225806452
8156245,1,B000KF0DXY,"I am not looking to nominate every movie for an academy award (especi-ally sci-fi/horror) . I just like to be entertained. Having said that, this was probably the worst film I have viewed to date. The editing was comical as was the special effects. The public milling about in the background during shootouts and big fight scenes was hysterical. There were actors who's skills ran the gambit from seasoned to what appeared to be first semester acting students. It was like films they would have used for the Mystery Science Theatre. In that format I believe this film would have rated four stars and be a cult favorite. Or watch with the guys while tipping a few etc. and you would probably LOL.",1236902400,2,695,4.658536585365853
8156246,1,B000KF0DXY,"My favorite actor in the entire film was Eric Etebari. He plays a perfect bad man and delivered his lines flawlessly and believably.

In my opinion this is a campy poorly written, poorly edited, cliche filled tired vampire movie. There didn't seem to be any continuium although the first scenes promised a better movie. it goes downhill rapidly.

The plot line was thin and the editing made a lot of assumptions that the audience would already know the backstory.

Although some really good actors were in this film, Balwin's part seemed to be an afterthought. More of an addition than a necessary part of the film itself. There seemed to be a lot of overacting or maybe it was just overwriting. Yet in a perfect world, it could turn into a cult film with very little effort.",1174176000,4,775,4.642335766423358
