8337587,4,B00005O5AR,"Fortune Quest: Journey to Terrason, I watched the DVD before first time. I liked to detail and main character about their adventure journey to Terrason continue. But we didn't have any Fortune Quest DVD to any store. I saw some internet on YouTube.com before first time and have Fortune Quest episode 13 and 14 but I forgot something on the history lost everything in last year.",1360972800,,378,4.742424242424242
8337588,2,B00005O5AR,"Fortune Quest is perhaps one of the Anime shows that while it only contains just a little bit of mature material, it is mostly a kid/family friendly Anime/

One I would recogmend to those who are starting out.

The 5 episodes seem to tell one simple story, but I remember that the series got allot better later on so without the complete series being translated, I will only give this a 2 star one.",1214784000,,398,4.364864864864865
8337589,4,B00005O5AR,"I'll start off by saying that I'm easily entertained when it comes to anime so use your own judgement in getting this. Now, I actually picked this up to spend enough money in order to get the free shipping on some Weiss Kruez (Knight Hunters) tapes. I chose Fortune Quest because I saw the name Mukai Natsumi. Natsumi worked on the manga +Anima which I LOVE. Back to Fortune Quest, while not as good as +Anima I found it very cute and entertaining and I love the opening theme. So if you like you anime cute and fluffy this is for you. Also it's nice that the whole family can watch it. Most anime tend to be PG-13.",1062547200,,615,4.220338983050848
8337590,3,B00005O5AR,"My friend was telling me to buy this series and I have to say, I was rather bored by these episodes. Although, Shrio's mother was funny and I got some chuckles from it. BUT, I do like the theme song and she told me the later episodes are a lot better once more characters and main bad dudes are introduced. (If they ever release the second DVD...) I think I'll buy another one of these though. But for people who like something less cute with more mature humor (this is a series for prolly kids 6-13), get The Slayers or even Ruin Explorers.
In other words, this DVD is good and the series has some promise, but I think I'll buy a later DVD.",1029715200,,641,4.17741935483871
8337591,4,B00005O5AR,"This story revolves around a group of young people: one a thief by trade, one a knight by trade, one a cartographer who gets lost all the time, a large guy (not yet sure what his role is), a white dragon baby, an elf girl, and some character called Kitton (not sure yet of this one either).  The animation reminds me of Flint the Time Detective.  The storyline involves fantasy and the group must ban together to overcome the centipede monster who hampers their trip back from Mount Terrason.  I don't want to spoil the story for anyone.  Some of the story can be a bit childish and the elf girl seems to whine or cry all the time, if you can overlook this it was worth the ($$$).  Also, it does contain 5 episodes.  Hope this helps.",1007596800,,733,4.27536231884058
