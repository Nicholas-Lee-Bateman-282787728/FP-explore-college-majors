8480932,4,B005O65ABO,"I saw this movie at the theater and the 3d in it was very good.  The 3d blu ray comes in a blu ray case and not a dvd case like the picture shows when you order it.  It's a standard BLU RAY case with a real 3d blu ray in it. The movie is converted 3d , and of course native 3d looks better but here the 3d looks great especially the underwater scenes.  The film had unknown actors in it as well.  But it is a good little action adventure movie where they look for lost gold and of course there  are bad guys who want it as well.  The movie moved very quickly and is entertaining.  It is a b movie and a decent one.  The blu ray looks good to with the 3d showing through very well , of course a 3d lbu ray is NEVER as good as what you would see at the movie theaters where the screen is very large.  This came out in 2011. and thankfully they offer this movie on a 3d blu ray.  I have had to buy many 3d films on 3d blu ray from overseas which is lame.  This one is here for you to buy. If you enjoy 3d films this is a good one of them with many scenes utilizing 3d for great depth.",1421539200,,1081,3.6973684210526314

8480934,4,B005O65ABO,"Deep Gold is an engrossing adventure. The foreign locations and acting were exotic and interesting to watch. The action makes the film closer to John Ford than Quentin Tarantino and I liked it for that reason; so if you are looking for kinetic martial-arts-type action, this film is not for you. The 3D is fair: I thought it could be better employed in some areas, but in other sections added to the adventure. The highlight for me was the heroines escape from a library near the beginning. Another area that used 3D to good effect were the swimming/diving sequences. Overall a good change of pace if you are looking for a thriller.",1411776000,,632,4.651785714285714
8480935,1,B005O65ABO,"Deep Gold is a misnomer. There is t=really Deep Do Do and I worked on it. Truly terrible. The Director, Producer, Writer, Actor (you get the idea) thinks having money and splashing it around, is synonymous with talent_not! And he's a prick to boot...",1403481600,,250,4.704545454545454
8480936,1,B005O65ABO,"bad acting, the setting is nice tho. I only watched to get a feel for what the philippines is like. For that purpose it was OK.",1395964800,,127,3.923076923076923
8480937,5,B005O65ABO,"My girlfriend is Filipina and wanted to see this movie since much of it is set in the PI. We enjoyed the movie, had a few laughs.",1356652800,,129,3.814814814814815
8480938,2,B005O65ABO,"Amy Sanchez (Bebe Pham) who lives on the paradise island of Cebu is a champion freediver. Her boyfriend Tony (Jack Prinya) is in the air force and must pilot a shipment of gold to Manila. There are some plot continuity issues. He tells Amy his mission is top secret, yet when the plane crashes the news knows it was the gold shipment and she knows that her boyfriend was the pilot. We do know there was foul play involved, but we are not shown who it was. Was it her boyfriend or another character? The plot continuity gets worse as the next day two soldiers show up and question Amy if she knows where her boyfriend is located and they tell her not to leave town. Her sister asks if they have a warrant, meanwhile a news team shows up at their same outdoor table. I guess top secret information travels fast on a small island...Oh yes the location that the plane went down is classified. Amy decides to go find the plane and clear her name even though she is not really accused of anything. There are forces (who can't tie a knot) that don't want Amy to go searching.

The movie is nice enough to have a meaningless shoulder up shower scene with Bebe as filler...and naked feet in case Tarantino is watching. The newscasts are also in English. Kersten Hui plays Chaing the mean Chinese landlord. Except for the f-bomb the film appears to be a bad pilot for a TV program. Michael Gleissner who plays Benny Simpson in this feature is also the writer, producer and director. The action is light.

Rare f-bomb, no sex, no nudity.",1327104000,2,1526,4.427046263345196
