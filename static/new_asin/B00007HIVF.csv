8324095,2,B00007HIVF,"This is a pretty good video on what to do AFTER the pictures are taken!  If you want to learn ANY kind of photography skills this IS NOT the video u want! It deals with memory cards, TONS of printing suggestions (This is 90% of the video, all are common sense if you know anything about what you are doing) and cropping.

I was hoping it saying, ""digital photography"" it might have something to do with PHOTOGRAPHY(even just seeing him take 1 picture)...it should be called digital printing made easy! I am glad i borrowed it instead of buying it.",1142899200,,547,4.46
