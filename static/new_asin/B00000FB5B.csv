Morgan Brittany steps out of the glamour and plays the role of a Veterinarian in Alaska.",1396224000,,163,4.655172413793103
7907972,4,B00000FB5B,"I agree with ""a customer"" completely. It's a shame this isn't on DVD because too many people won't get the chance to see it. Like many fine family movies, this wasn't a commecial hit, so it's probably going to disappear. I hope there will be a movie channel at some point that looks for all these VHS gems and plays them for us. If you still have access to a VHS player, but this for a good family time. I watched it with my granddaughter. I think it's time to pull it out and watch it once more before my VCR breaks forever.",1323907200,,525,4.106796116504855
