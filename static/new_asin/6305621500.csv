1052622,4,6305621500,"I had low expectations of this film, due to the lack of popular acclaim, but it was surprisingly good.
What I liked about it, was that the story was interesting and highly innovative, and the pacing and editing was generally very good - although occasionally, some of the scene changes are a little too abrupt (but this is true of most HK films, outside of Swordsman).
The story kept my interest throughout, and the fantasy-wire-style action sequences were well done.  The amount of comedy was just right to keep the film from being overly serious and ponderous.
Brigitte Lin is great as usual, but all the actresses are quite beautiful in this one.
This review is based on the previous Tai Seng DVD, which has an unusually clear transfer for an HK DVD, so if the new one is any better, it should be quite good.  (I posted my review here, because there were none yet and I wanted something about the film to appear here.)
If you have never seen an HK movie, I would start with Iron Monkey (1993) or The Bride with White Hair, but if you are an HK movie fan who likes interesting stories surrounding your action, then give ""Deadful Melody"" a try.  Perhaps some day, we may even see the title corrected to ""Deadly Melody"" !",993081600,,1221,4.490990990990991
1052623,2,6305621500,"I read the review and thought this would be a pretty good movie. However, I was really disappointed when I viewed it. The plot started out pretty ok. It kepts one interested for a moment (at least for me), but then later the movie couldn't decide if it wants to be a comedy (which is not) or a mystery (which I solved pretty easily). The end of the movie is even worst because it nevers tells the audience what happens to the three characters. It just left me hanging (which I hate!)",970099200,2,483,4.260869565217392
1052624,5,6305621500,"After I saw swordsman 2 (which is my favorite movie) I wanted to see some more sword play Brigette Lin movies. So I went out and got a few of her movies. The first was the East is Red(swordsman 3)which had some good  special effects but as a movie does not deserve the swordsman name,then I  got The Bride With White Hair, now this was a very origional movie that had  an extremely evil tone which I wasn't used to but the fight scenes didn't  live up to the reviews that I read as they looked far too Blury and  definitley speed altered,but this was still a good movie(4-stars)Then last  I saw Deadful Melody which was outstanding,I cannot express how suprised I  was after viewing this movie ,expecially after having the lowest  expectations for it out of the bunch. But the true star in this was Yuen  Biao which the story mainly focused on. The story was good and easy to  follow,the cinematography and backgrounds were awesome,and the fight scenes  were done perfectly and had spectacular wire work with no aparent speed  altering(and the fights were also very plentiful)An excellent sleeper title  that I couldn't reccomend more. Buy it I guarantee you'll be suprised. Also  if you like Yuen Biao I would say this is his best movie. $17.95(DVD),how  can you not take a chance?",957484800,8,1282,4.635555555555555

7892191,4,6305621500,Brigitte Lin puts in a typically enjoyable performance in this classic B grade martial arts/fantasy film from 1994. It dates from that period of Hong Kong film making which saw more polished production values than the Shaw brothers films but before the genre was ruined by the subsequent over-reliance on CGI.,1378166400,,309,5.078431372549019
7892192,4,6305621500,I like the main actor. I know this movie is kind of old but I order it anyways. The quality of the DVD is not that good can't really see too much coloring but overall its ok. The shipping was pretty fast.,1357344000,,204,3.880952380952381
7892193,5,6305621500,"Yuen Biao on his own, good action and some comedy. Brigitte Lin plays a magical lute, that can kill people. Fun movie...",1355875200,,120,4.5
7892194,4,6305621500,"Well, if you've seen/read Lord of the Rings, you know how it goes. Everyone talks about the evil power of the Magic Lyre (a ""qin"" is actually more of a zither, but we'll go with the subtitles) and claims to want to destroy it, but actually everyone wants it for themselves, because whoever wields it can be the leader of the Martial World. So the Last Alliance of Men and Elves...sorry, I mean the Fire Palace, the Ghost Sect, etc., all led by a renegade member of the sect that has the Magic Lyre, form a small army to steal/destroy it. We're left with one young girl (Snow) holding the Magic Lyre after her parents have been slaughtered...and then she's driven off a cliff. As everyone knows, this just means the person comes back years later to take a hideous and gruesome revenge.

And no one does hideous gruesome vengeance like Brigitte Lin! As the grown-up Snow, she flies through this movie with THAT LOOK, alternately playing the main theme song or killing people with the Magic Notes of Explodey Doom. Her revenge plot involves having Yuen Biao deliver the Magic Lyre from one of her targets to another, in order to draw out those who want to steal it and to sow suspicion among them. One of the thieves is a very cute Carina Lau, as the chief disciple of the Fire Master (Wu Ma). She naturally ends up falling for Yuen Biao...

The plot is pretty standard, and the movie has the usual mix of violence, comedy, misunderstandings, women dressed as men, and cheesy effects. Yuen Biao doesn't do as much cool fighting stuff as you might hope for, but it's not bad. I thought the funniest character was Yuen Biao's master, Monk Arrives-Late, who always shows up a few minutes too late after every crisis. The various other characters are pretty good, too, with the Fire Master, the Ghost Master, and the Hard-Hearted Witch being the most memorable. Definitely worth watching if you enjoy this type of movie. Not the best, but entertaining and competently made.",1274140800,2,1966,4.630372492836676
7892195,5,6305621500,"BRIGITTE LIN (Dragon Inn, The Bride With White Hair) and YUEN BIAO (Once Upon a Time in China, Jackie Chan's Project A) star in this wild martial arts fantasy epic adventure!

When the lyre mysteriously reappears after it devastated the kung fu world 16 years earlier, the evil and corrupt ""Six Clans"" vow to possess it.

7892196,5,6305621500,"I loved this as a classic kung-fu revenge click. Brigitte Lin is as beautiful as ever even when throwing her icy stare of death. She is a tremendous actress. I've never known many actresses that can act without speaking as Brigitte can with her facial expressions. Yuen Biao gives a strong performance.

The fight scenes are pretty good. When will they ever get the title right - it's ""Deadly Melody.""",1094601600,8,401,4.728571428571429
7892197,3,6305621500,"This movie talks about Brigitte Lin's parents are killed when the bad guys try to snatched their ""Deadful Melody"" skill. Brigitte Lin survived and vowed to take revenge using ""Deadful Melody"" skill. Overall, the fighting scenes are nice and Brigitte Lin gave a good performance. Not a bad pop corn movie.",1030147200,4,304,4.980392156862745
7892198,2,6305621500,"As a fan of both Brigette Lin and Yuen Baio I jumped at the chance to buy this film.  I eagerly put it in.  The beginning was excellent, manic pacing and nice explosions.  A good sign, but I was dissapointed to find that the intro to the film is the best part of it.  The fighting scenes are directed very poorly, it's often hard to tell exactly what is going on.  You'll see two people jump in the air and some close ups, then one of the bodies will drop without a clue as to what happened.  The humor in the film works more often that not.  A few running gags made me chuckle (the Master who is always late, and Yuen always thinking women with hats are men) and the scene with Yuen getting piggy-backed works well.  The characters are a mixed bag.  Some are appropriately evil, yet some left me confused.  I was confused about the Fire Master, in some scenes he was a caring, merciful master to his pupils, yet in others he was as ruthless as the rest of the villains.  All in all, the film was dissapointing, the action is horrible.  Worth a rental, but do not make the mistake of purchase like I did.",1017532800,,1104,4.204761904761905
