8527790,5,B008H00C12,I love this story.  It is very well acted and I felt that I was in practically there in the scenes and not just an observer.  Unfortunately disc 2 of 4 discs paused in the middle of the presentation.  I didn't view discs 3 and 4 because I was so frustrated with the presentation would pause in the middle of the scene and variously begin in again for various lengths of pause.  I returned the product./,1397779200,,402,4.25
8527791,5,B008H00C12,Jung Il Woo is one of my favorite actors. The idea behind this show intrigued me. A rich girl who always gets what she wants finally meets her match. Whats not to like about her getting it thrown back at her. I liked the show. I thought it was funny.,1393545600,,250,4.02

8527794,5,B008H00C12,"The video came within a few days and was packaged well. I have already seen My Fair Lady on Drama Fever so I knew the plotline. I scanned through various places on each CD to make certain that the conversation/translation made sense and it did. The video is not a bootleg but the real deal.  I would definitely order other Korean dramas from timothyng001!

As for the story itself, I obviously enjoyed the drama since I ordered the video. Yoon Eun-hye is perhaps one of my favorite Korean actresses. Story aside, it was well worth watching just to see all the expensive outfits, jewelry, and purses!",1357171200,4,599,4.6415094339622645
