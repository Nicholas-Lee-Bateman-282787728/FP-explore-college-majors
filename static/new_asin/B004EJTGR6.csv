8427084,5,B004EJTGR6,"Miss Wendy is someone I want my kids to hang out with!  She is so gentle and imaginative and fun!  The children in the video play right along with her story about Scooter.  Their imaginations are obviously engaged and their bodies moving.  The stories are fun, and I love how there are other simple tips for staying strong and healthy.  This video could be used at home as well as with a large group in a school setting as Miss Wendy has the kids moving, but they are in control in their little spots.  It looks like no other supplies are really needed, including a yoga mat.

Kids are enthralled by the story line and really get into the movements. They learn valuable techniques that they recall when faced with a challenging situation. These DVDs teach life skills that will serve the child for a lifetime.",1399852800,,407,4.814285714285714
8427086,5,B004EJTGR6,"This movement story is fun, engaging, and inspires kids to be healthy and learn what they can do to be healthy. Children in early childhood classrooms enjoy the physical activity with their classmates while teachers are happy to be offering an educational sequence that develops social emotional skills, self-regulation, and developmental skills. Whether at home or at school, kids will love to act out these stories. All the stories in the Scooter and Me Series are high quality and capture the imagination and attention of children.",1387238400,,534,5.22093023255814
