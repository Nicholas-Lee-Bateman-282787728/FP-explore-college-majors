8157724,5,B000KKHXSC,"No, it's not a vampire movie, but this one is every bit as funny as Nightlife was in the respect that Ben and his castmates keep you cracked up!  It's got a few surprises in it and it will keep anyone in stitches. ***The assistant is as funny as Carlotta was in Nightlife***. She's a scene stealer--rather a scene maker in a lot of it! I'd say she was totally cool to watch here! I'm not going to spoil this, but you will need a multi-region dvd player to watch it guys! Most are use to seeing Ben Cross play a bad a**, but he also has a strength for the funny roles and he does very well in here!",1260403200,,597,3.975
