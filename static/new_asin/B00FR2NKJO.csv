8618121,2,B00FR2NKJO,"Unlike Lagrange Set 1, this Blu-ray release was encoded at 1080p due to the whining of unknowledgeable anime fans, which resulted in worse video quality. The combing on the show was removed, at the cost of having the opening and ending credits move incorrectly, or comb themselves. In this case, 1080i should have been the correct way to encode. The combing that many people experience on 1080i content is the fault of their Blu-ray player, not the disc itself.

The main problem with the video quality of both Lagrange Set 1 and 2, is heavy MPEG compression artifacts similar to what is seen on an average DVD. I believe this title uses the old MPEG2 compression standard, not the MPEG4/AVC of nearly all Blu-ray anime. The show also appears to be encoded at constant bitrate instead of variable bitrate. I didn't check the actual bitrate though, so I don't know if the artifacts are due to a low bitrate, or an inferior MPEG2 standard. The artifacts are on everything, including the overlayed English credits text, and disc extras.

Despite these problems I'm giving this release a decent rating because they included most of the important extras, minus the OVA. The end cards are present. There is a slight RGB fishbowl effect with the video quality but that is part of the original animation and may have been deliberate.

The show itself is okay. Actually watching it is a bit like torture due to the story. But I just bought this show because I like to look at the green girl and the blue girl. Their pilot clothes are good and they also wear swimsuits a lot.",1472601600,,1565,4.663043478260869

8618124,4,B00FR2NKJO,"Season 2 broadcast via a blank in 3 months after season 1 broadcasting in Japan. Taking pictures is very good for the 3rd fact that the substantial TATSUO Sato general manager of the contents by whom a foreshadow in season 1 is collected quickly dealt with a picture continuity including appearance of lily Cano by whom existence was suggested, MADOKA, Sean who records bawdy and makes ""RIN-NE"" actuated by sexual excitement is indeed. That ""Kamogawa days"" when you did theater opening to the public of a valuable one by Japan and were treated as the 12.5th talk by notice are un-recording. It's none other than that Sean by whom VOX AURA was returned to the peer Sir form by season 2-1st talk and an executive of MUGINAMI by season 2 1st talk aren't transmitted to a North American fan regrettably. I'd like to hope for sale by some shapes.",1455840000,,841,4.651006711409396

8618129,5,B00FR2NKJO,"Season 2 of lagrange brings you everything you would expect. The girls are reunited once again and deepen their relationship. The mystery of the Rinne is revealed and the ancient catastrophe that occurred is explained. This season focuses more on the interactions of the sub-characters and how they relate to the three main girls in depth.

Some people may not like that this is not a real mecha war show. There really are no super robots here or no real strategic battle sequences. However, there is plenty of sci-fi and real mech fans can appreciate the finer details that improves on the Vox designs every few episodes such as the animation nuances of Muginami's battle armaments.

the animation quality of Lagrange is very unique. The dark lines and bright color palette draw the eye in to create a burst of color. Some people may think it is drab and plain, but it works very well for the way the show is made.

The blu-ray quality is good. Thankfully, the show is not teleclined like the first season was. *just fyi, accel world is not teleclined either* However, you can see a few mouth combs here and there which are left over from the original source material. That's ok, I feel these little mishaps are what give lagrange such a wonderful charm, ""We are trying!"" is what they want to say.

The bottom line is: If you liked the first season you will want to see this. If you thought the first season was a little stale, this will do nothing to improve on that impression.",1389312000,4,1480,4.573584905660377
8618130,5,B00FR2NKJO,"Very fun, and very underrated series. Madoka Kyouno, a schoolgirl from Kamogawa, is the sole member of the Jersey Club and always ready to help others out. One day, she is approached by an alien named Lan who asks her to pilot a robotic aircraft to defend mankind against an evil force. Sounds strange, but isn't that really what separates anime from other forms of entertainment? A willingness to accept a strange premise and enjoy a great work of art for what it is. If the first season is any indicator then the blu ray quality is absolutely great.",1382140800,9,551,4.575757575757576
