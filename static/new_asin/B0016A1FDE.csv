3154545,5,B0016A1FDE,"Lee Holden is my favorite Qi Gong instructor and I appreciate that this particular video class gently works to improve the range of motion, flexibility and ease of movement in all of the joints.  I have a number of his video from the Exercise to Heal collection and rotate through them doing a different one each day.  This delightful Qi Gong practice is a recorded in the natural beauty of Lake Tahoe.  . Lee has a peaceful, gentle, presence, and his slow flowing movements bring a sense of calm as he leads you to gently increase your range of motion and improve muscle tone, while improving the flow of blood, chi and lymph.  This video series is extremely well produced and the movements well-paced with the rhythm of the breath. The natural setting that forms the background is truly spectacular...and adds immeasurably to the overall quality and benefits of this production.  There is a brief trailer for this dvd at [...]  Highly recommended.  However, do your research on prices, you should not pay more than about $20 for this video.",1385337600,8,1042,4.7555555555555555
3154546,5,B0016A1FDE,"I ordered this Qi Qong and it arrived in a timely manner. I was so surprised to see how fast it arrived. The cd goes at a rate my husband and I can follow. I recommend this to anyone wanting to learn some basic stretching. it moved at a good pace for ""Younger"" seniors! It gives us a good work out and leaves us feeling great! I would recommend it to any one needing gentle stretching exercise.",1378598400,7,394,4.12987012987013
3154547,5,B0016A1FDE,"To capitalize on the aging population, others are issuing all kinds of exercise products for ""arthritis"" and ""joints"" and such. Those that I've read or seen are just rehashes and mostly duplications of what the same people offer in other formats, either books or videos. So I was afraid this would be, too, because I couldn't tell much from the teaser clip that's available free. Thankfullly, it's all that it claims to be and, like Lee Holden's ""Qigong Flow for Beginners,"" it's excellent. These aren't sold new on Amazon, and you'll get the best price directly from Holden. Just search by his name.",1213747200,15,600,4.834951456310679

8261779,4,B0016A1FDE,"A friend recommended the Lee Holden series of exercises. I like the product I think that they are  easy enough to do and hopefully beneficial to my for my joints. I bought a second video directly from Lee hold inside however because it was much cheaper than Amazon's price.  While I think the exercises are good, I think it's a bit overpriced. Other exercise DVDs I've purchased have more than one routine. The  two Lee Holden DVDs that I purchased, only give you one work out. There are two versions, a simple version and a harder version but it still just one work out.",1481673600,,571,4.471153846153846
8261780,5,B0016A1FDE,"I take a tai chi class at the local senior citizen center; the teacher mentioned Qi Gong during one of the classes. I 'googled' what qi gong was..and found Lee Holden's dvds. I have the Seniors, the Stress, the Beginner's Flow, and the More Flow for Beginners dvds. I highly recommend these. I clean houses, stay active, and oftentimes I want a relaxing workout, that adds to my health. Qi Gong works well, its NOT strenuous, but when you do one of his dvds, you KNOW you've done a half hour or so of a gentle workout, but it feels SO good. I do Sarah Starr's Chair Yoga dvds as well. The best prices for Lee Holden's qi gong dvds is ExerciseToHeal.com; order them direct from this site.",1480291200,,687,4.375
