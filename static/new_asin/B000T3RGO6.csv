8207697,3,B000T3RGO6,"DIGIVIEW's slimline cased DVDs feature unrestored public domain films and TV shows that have no subtitles or extras. Audio levels are some of the highest you'll find, which makes these ideal for laptop PC or portable disc player watching.

In their CLASSIC SUSPENSE volume, we get nine examples of 1950s TV series, from the famous (""Dragnet"") to the obscure (""Lights Out""). Some don't have their original theme songs (several drops-ins for ""Dragnet"" are particularly egregious). Mixed here with crime dramas is a kid's show (""Captain Gallant""), a sitcom (""My Hero"") and an occult program (""One Step Beyond""). Some episodes are incorrectly IDed by DIGIVIEW; this is fixed below.
