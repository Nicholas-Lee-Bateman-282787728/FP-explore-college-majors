437181,5,6302224357,"A happily married couple prepare to celebrate their fourth wedding anniversary when Loy's mother (excellently portrayed by the great character actress Florence Bates) arrives and stays longer than originally anticipated due to a broken ankle.  Powell attends to the battleaxe - a real meddling matriarch - and is bored to tears with her - so much so - that when Loy goes to visit her aunt, Powell has a few sips with Gail Patrick, an old flame who lives in the same apartment complex....  Naturally, the sour old beldame with the face of curds overhears their conversation which insures a hilarious misunderstanding...This seemingly little-known film is a mile-a-minute breakneck farce that looks as good today as it did back in 1941. The verbal wit and slapstick which was used in this picture was high quality and rather untypical for the Loy-Powell teaming & there is enough raillery to satisfy most of their sophisticated-language fans.  Conway directed with such a swiftness that you'll find yourself laughing throughout this deftly handled but surprisingly little-seen Screwball jewel. As a footnote, Powell & Loy made a dozen films together, six as Nick and Nora Charles.",1032912000,58,1178,5.157068062827225

Great repartee between the two stars and even the side characters; characters that you like; witty dialogue; plenty of slapstick; mistaken identies and situations; a man in drag; people acting crazy and a very amusing storyline!

Jack Carson adds greatly to the comedy elements as do several other character actors. From start to finish this picture never takes a misstep.",1332720000,,536,4.955555555555556
437266,4,6302224357,"Between ""Thin Man"" films, William Powell and Myrna Loy get together in a wacky comedy from the 1940s called ""Love Crazy.""

Powell plays an architect who is celebrating his fourth anniversary.  He often does the same thing that he and his wife did when they first got married, including rowing a boat and hiking four miles.  This time they agree to do everything backwards.  Romantic.

Unfortunately Steve Ireland's (Powell) mother in law shows up, shrewdly played by Florence Bates.  Her interference and slippable rug (lots of opportunity for slapstick, though you can see its Powell's stand-in that takes a fall) Ireland runs into an old girlfriend.  Through various antics (busted elevator, elevator boy played by great character actor Elisha Cook, Jr.) Steve makes it back to the apartment.

Dying to get out of there and away from his mother in law, he sneaks out to see his old flame in an innocent way.  The mother in law makes it look like Steve is cheating and away we go.  The only way out of divorce court is if he makes like he's crazy.

Themes:  Some serious themes of the psychiatric community and its influence on the court system - they can pretty much lock you up in a home with only their own opinions to go by (""he's schizophrenic!"") and some toughs to keep the crazies in line, with some over the top dramatics to make it fun, really makes you think.

Steve also pretends to be his own sister to escape the clutches of the psychs, but has to shave his own mustache to do it!  Powell makes a great woman in this film.

Bottom Line:  Overall, not nearly as fun and silly like ""The Thin Man"" series, but these two really know how to make a tastefully funny film - unlike today's ""romantic comedy"" toilet humor.

The DVD I watched is part of the Loy/Powell collection, including a half-hour radio adaptation.  Much of the detail is cut from the film, including the crazy mother in law!

437268,5,6302224357,"I saw ""Love Crazy"" on TCM a few months ago, and I thought it was one of funniest movie (Screwball) comedy I have ever seen. I won't spoil if for you, but this man is very in love with his wife, and will do almost anything to keep her and his marriage intact, but a busy body mother-in-law will also do anything to break up the marriage for her daughter to a man she don't like.

To what length the husband will go, is what makes this movie so wonderful to watch, you will laugh at some of the thing he does to keep his wife. Man, he must really loves her.

We have had movies of mother-in-laws interfering in they children marriage before this movie and after this movie, but I think this is one the funniest, and it has the ever beautiful Myrna Loy as the wife, and William Powell as the husband. Their chemistry is just good together.

I would watch this movie just to look at Myrna Loy and admire her work. She is so so classy and that beautiful speaking voice, what can I say, it is so musical.

Good viewing, you will enjoy this movie.",1150243200,2,1040,4.159203980099503
437269,5,6302224357,"William Powell and Myrna Loy are best know for the six Thin Man movies they made but in all they starred together in 11 films.  Love Crazy is one of those and like all the rest, the pair enjoyed and amazing chemistry and sense of timing whenever they worked together.  In this film, they play Steve and Susan Ireland who are celebrating their fourth wedding anniversary when Susan's meddling mother Mrs. Cooper (Florence Bates) crashes the celebration and promptly breaks her ankle, lengthening her stay.  She never liked Steve anyway so when she catches him talking to an old flame (played by Gail Patrick) she uses it to convince her daughter that Steve is cheating on her so she can divorce him.  Steve then pretends that he is insane so he can prevent the divorce from going through.  What ensues is a traditional screwball comedy involving a cast of wacky characters including the psychiatrists that Steven has to convince that he is insane.

The film was directed by Jack Conway who directed the pair in another one of their classic films, ""Libeled Lady"" from 1936.  The dialog between Loy and Powell will remind viewers of the snappy, tit-for-tat lines from the Thin Man films as they trade barbs throughout.  It's a very funny film and shows yet another example of how well these two worked together.  Definitely see this one!

437271,5,6302224357,"Marital bliss turns into amusing chaos as the only way William Powell can keep his wife Myrna Loy from divorcing him is to have himself declared insane, in Jack Conway's, ""Love Crazy."" While not quite as funny as the premise sounds, there are plenty of smiles and enough hilarious moments to put this in the upper echelon of the many films Powell and Loy made together. Pandro S. Berman's glossy production has a fine suporting cast that includes pretty Gail Patrick and Jack Carson, and a good screenplay from William Ludwig, Charles Lederer, and David Hertz, based on an original story by Hertz and Ludwig.

Steve Ireland (William Powell) and his wife Susan (Myrna Loy) have been happily married for four years and only Steve's mother-in-law (Florence Bates) can ruin their anniversary. He can't get rid of her fast enough when she drops in unexpectedly and ruins all their plans. On his way to mail something for her to help speed up the process he runs into his old flame, Isobel Grayson, winningly portrayed by Gail Patrick. She is fun and freespirited, and a little thing like marriage, his or hers, is of small consequence.

The mix-ups begin when they get trapped in an elevator and have to climb out the top to escape. It's hilarious when Steve gets his head caught and when the couple finally do manage to make it out, a discheveled Steve, his hat in Isobel's apartment and her shoes in his pocket,  must make a different kind of escape from the carefree and more than willing Isobel.

Steve gets back and things settle down, but when his mother-in-law slips on a rug she brought them, Susan is forced to leave Steve alone with her while she picks up her aunt Laura at the train station. Looking for an escape, any escape, he manages through a ruse to slip out and have a drink with Isobel, who lives downstairs. Susan's meddling mother overhears Steve's plan to sneak out, and Susan attempts to make him jealous and get even by arranging a kiss with Isobel's husband. When she gets the wrong apartment by mistake,  a confused Ward Willoughby (Jack Carson) plays along because Susan is quite a dish.

The merry mix-up results in Susan thinking Steve lied to her about his old girlfriend Isobel and she files for divorce. Steve's attorney pal advises him the only way he can keep Susan from making it final is to feign insanity. Just how far he'll go to convince everyone he's off his rocker may be too far, as a group of alienists from the lunacy board, in spite of Steve's protests, decide he's nutty as a fruitcake! When Susan, who knows, of course, he's faking it, refuses custody and has him wisked away to Doctor Wuthering's Rest Home, it just gets merrier.

A visit from Willioughby so he can gloat, and an escape by Steve that will involve him dressing up and pretending to be his own sister to avoid the cops and win over his love Susan, are just some of the highlights in this fun and amusing marital farce. The ""Hiawatha"" scene and Steve getting to slap around Willoughby as his own sister offer a lot of fun for classic film fans.

Loy is just a sweet doll here and Powell is his usual charming self as The Thin Man couple have an amusing outing that over six decades later still outshines anything Hollywood has to offer today. A sure bet for fans of our favorite screen couple, William Powell and Myrna Loy.",1125100800,9,3330,4.575503355704698
437272,5,6302224357,"Even after repeat viewings LOVE CRAZY is still very funny and a delight to watch.  Married for four years Myrna Loy mistakenly thinks that husband William Powell has cheated on her with a ex-girlfriend who recently moved into their building.

Powell, convinced that if given enough time Myrna will cool down, relies upon a law that says you can't divorce a insane person for 5 years.  He does his best to prove to the judge and doctors that he's crazy.  In fact, he does it so well that they throw him into a insane asylum.

As always the chemistry between Powell and Loy is hypnotic.  Too magical for plain ol' VHS that's for sure.  What would be great is a non-THIN MAN Powell/Loy DVD box set.  That'd be 8 movies.

Look for a young Elisha Cook Jr. (SHANE, ROSEMARY'S BABY) as the elevator operator and Bert Roach (THE CROWD, THE THIN MAN) as the front desk clerk!

The situation soon gets out of hand leading to a gross misunderstanding between Powell and Loy. She seeks a divorce and to delay matters Powell pretends insanity.
In many ways the dialogue will remind viewers of the Thin Man series. Powell and Loy are trading the same kind of barbs and getting involved in more goofy antics.

7822519,5,6302224357,"This is Pando Berman's second production at MGM and a box office hit, starring William Powell and Myrna Loy, also costarring Gail Patrick and Jack Carson. This is a real screwball slapstick, an absolute knockabout farce that makes viewers laugh all the way. The script writers, David Hertz, Ludwig and Charles Lederer did magic that made William Powell feigning madness to prevent his wife, played Myrna Loy, from divorcing him. This premise made no more sense than the madcap mishaps that follows this debacle. Director Jack Conway certainly does his best to keep audiences in a laughing mood. This is very engaging movie and keep you glued to the screen to know what happens next.

Powell and Loy had great chemistry working together on screen, and their success was illustrated by a list of 14 movies made as a team including the 1936 lavish production of ""The Great Ziegfeld"" which won the best Academy Award. This movie is a real treat for all fans of Myrna Loy and William Powell.
