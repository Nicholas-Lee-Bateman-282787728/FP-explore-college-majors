4586517,4,B0056755I4,"I absolutely enjoyed this movie, though it was a little cliche (don't want to give it away) but overall it was beautiful. Their love at the end was realistic and wonderful and I wish that it had a different ending. I really liked the characters but these dramas always put me in a depressive state, thus why I only gave it four stars. For the hopeless and true romantics, this is a must see romance. Though there are many romances just like it.",1361836800,,444,4.36144578313253
4586518,3,B0056755I4,"This was well acted and I loved the two leads, did I love the story, it was okay... I felt like I'd seen it many times before and even though there is a twist I saw it coming a mile away. Hopefully it won't be as obvious to everyone as that clearly makes this more mundane. Would I watch it again, no...do I resent having paid for it... no. I can't say that for a lot of the things I have paid to watch here on Amazon.",1361750400,,418,3.8160919540229883
4586519,4,B0056755I4,"I'll admit, when I began watching this movie I was skeptical. The title left me worried that it would be depressing. To be fair, it was sad but it was also much more than that. This film makes you think about what is important in life and who it is that you want to share your life with. What courage the characters displayed to love each other in the face of such tragedy. You would have to be made of stone not to feel the emotion portrayed here.
 Over all it was a great film; very well made and executed. One thing that made me hesitant to watch this was there was no rating (PG, PG-13, R, etc...) but I am glad that I did. If I had to rate it I would give this film a PG rating.",1355961600,23,683,3.9136690647482015

4586534,5,B0056755I4,"Be sure to have plenty of tissue near by!  I am so infuriated but immensely touched and humbled!  OMG bloody depressing on one hand, but on the other hand heartwarming.

If you can handle being sucked into the hope of falling in love with who you consider ""the one for you"" enough to make you change your ways just to please them and have them in your life (all positive in this movie however), then for that to be totally obliterated by the fact that you are both dying, and only one of you have told the other, then this is a must see for you!

With that being said, it was a joyously sad movie!

Thanks for the pleasantly heartbreaking surprise in the end that made me cry uncontrollably; well made; enjoy!",1421884800,,709,4.3007518796992485

4586550,4,B0056755I4,"Despite several cliche and hilariously convenient plot points, and some of the most horrible music choices I've ever heard, this movie manages to be awesome due the phenomenal actors, and adorable comedic moments.  Moreover, the emotional keystones that hold this movie up resonate beautifully.  The scene toward the end when Min-Su checks his mail (which thankfully plays silent), is absolutely devastating.  In complete contrast, I nearly died laughing when I read the subtitle after the Doctor slams the doorwhich closes well.  This is a film, indeed.",1401926400,,554,5.406976744186046
4586551,4,B0056755I4,"This movie takes some sticking with as it begins as a rather unfeeling, choppily edited basically uninvolving story, but after the half way point it settles down a bit and picks up the storyline and then carries it and you to the sadly tragic end, which I admit to shedding a few tears over.  I especially liked the lead actress, Choi Ji-woo, and her endearingly coy smile, full of mischief and joy despite her situation.  Add this to the list of Korean movies I like and would recommend to those with a similar love for this genre.  Four out of five stars from me.",1401840000,,565,4.413461538461538

4586555,3,B0056755I4,"It's a movie about a dying person who falls for a man whose approach to women and relationships is no different from that of a conquering army toward the spoils of wartime. This is not to say the guy is a bad character; he instead personifies the young, rich, self-made man who views life as something to enjoy and conquer to the fullest. It is clear since the beginning that the guy is not going to be insensitive to the kind and lovingly attentions of the girl; what is not clear is the twist that materializes about half way into the movie. All considered this is a nice, clean and entertaining movie. It is also a tear-jerker and it does have a small attempt to character development. For this reason only I say it is an okay movie.",1397347200,,736,4.340579710144928

4586557,5,B0056755I4,"What a great story.  It's a bit sad but it has some laughs mixed in.  This movie stars one of the worlds most beloved actresses.  Choi Ji Woo.  In my opinion, if you want to see a quality program, find anything with Choi Ji Woo.  Winter Sonata, Honesty, Stairway to heaven and many others.  Miss Choi was on the cutting edge of the Korean wave.  It seems everyone who reviewed this movie liked it.  I cant understand why the stars are so low.  I guess subtitles ruin it for many.  Not me however.. I have discovered a vast treasure in Korean drama and movies.  I think this movie was a gem.  Great job by all the cast and crew.  I have watched this before, and i'll watch it again.  Well done!",1395014400,4,693,4.190839694656488

The comedy in it made it easier to watch this sort of movie. Spoiler Alert: It reminded me a bit of ""A Walk to Remember"" but did have a different twist to it which made me like it more. If watching subtitle movies turns you off then this is not a movie for you, but the subtitles to me could be read quite easily while following the movie. Wow! This was a tenderhearted movie.",1385856000,2,528,4.176470588235294

I told my sister about the storyline and cried while sharing.  What a sweet portrayal of what is the most precious part of life we can experience.  Another favorite of mine.  I now need tissues for my issues = felt good to be touched so deeply inside, means I am still alive in the hidden part of me others can't see.  Enjoy as you watch! :)",1382227200,2,635,3.891472868217054
4586570,4,B0056755I4,"Based purely on technical merit, I'd only give the movie 3 stars. It's reasonably well-done, but only so.

But who cares? The overall story and acting push it to a solid 4 stars.

The first half of the movie plays like a ""rom-com"", but in a fresh, very fun and entertaining way. The ""player"" Min-su meets Hye-won, an amazingly energetic and cheerful woman staying at the same hospital that coincidentally Min-su later winds up at ""for some rest"".

Of course he falls in love, and is eventually set out on a 12-step program of reformation, minus 11 steps (watch the movie, and you'll see what I mean :) ).

The acting is well-done, especially Hye-won's character, who has a captivating bounce and recklessness, along with the natural ability to resist Min-su's usual charm routine and to put him in his place.

The second half of the movie is a tear-jerker, but only because of the almost-incidentally bad hand life has dealt the couple. ""Incidentally"" not because it's not relevant to the story; it definitely is. But at the same time, the story is really about how the two make the most of what they have found: happiness and the ability to rise above whatever challenges they have. In that sense, it's still a heartwarming and upbeat story.

And if any of the movie is less than believable, whether the hijinx the characters get into or the way they manage to handle the stress without taking it out on each other, so what? The characters are heroic, and that's the way some of the best stories are. If I want realism, where people use violence to solve the smallest problems, I'll go for a walk or watch the evening news. Who needs that kind of realism in their movies? (Or at least, all of their movies?)",1382054400,8,1708,4.583606557377049

4586573,1,B0056755I4,"I could only take 20 minutes of this film. It was disjointed, seemed trying to just fill up dead air and run out the clock. The male lead was so annoying and senseless I wanted to slap him.

I guess it's cultural, but when he steals a car and abandons it a few blocks away as a happy lark type thing---grinning and running away from pursuers hand-in-hand with the girl---I shut it down. In real life he'd be Tased or shot by the Boston Police, or something.

Anyway, this film exceeded my ability to suspend disbelief.
