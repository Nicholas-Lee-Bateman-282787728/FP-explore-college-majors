3055629,5,B0010YSD54,"Very funny film.  I did not expect to laugh so hard, but there are  several classic scenes that far surpass the original Bachelor Party. Though the themes and storyline are pretty simple, the writing is very good. Hard to believe this was Director Jim Ryan's first film.",1207180800,,270,4.723404255319149
3055630,5,B0010YSD54,"I thought this movie was hysterical.  Definitely worth a look.  Made me want to go rent the original after.  Good laughs, good nudity, and good writing.  I highly recommend it...",1206403200,,178,4.833333333333333
3055631,4,B0010YSD54,"Alot of laugh-out-loud funny  situations!  Hilarious!
I found it MUCH FUNNIER than the original 1984 Tom Hanks movie.
Excellent performances. Well directed!",1205798400,,156,6.045454545454546
3055632,4,B0010YSD54,"Honestly, wasn't expecting much considering the title - was surprised they would make a sequel so long after the original.  Well, as it turns out, it's not really a sequel at all, it's a new story with all new characters.  More importantly, it's really funny!  My girlfriend and I were laughing all the way through.  Harland Williams is hyterical and the rest of the cast is really good as well.
I can see why they would call it Bachelor Party 2 because it reminds me of fun 80's sex comedies like Bachelor Party, Porky's, Stripes, etc.  Maybe they should have given it it's own title to avoid confusion.
In any case, was pleasantly surprised and enjoyed this much more than a lot of the crappy comedies that are in the theater these days.",1205625600,5,739,4.526315789473684
3055633,4,B0010YSD54,"i never saw the original but i thought i would rent this cause i was in the mood for a comedy, and this wasn't too bad.  its your basic bachelor party type movie where a group of guys go on a wild adventure and this one has a little twist mixed in.  its not the funniest movie but i laughed at some parts.  harland williams is what made this movie funny, without him it would have been a 2 or 3 star.  if your looking for a silly comedy with some good nudity and some laughs then rent this.",1205280000,,490,3.919191919191919
3055634,2,B0010YSD54,"Sometimes actors from old movies will appear in cameos to bless the re-make.  Tom Hanks is nowhere near here.  This has very little to do with the first movie; it doesn't say what happened the next day or next year.  This work involves four horny guys, but they don't have the chemistry and appeal of the four men in ""The 40 Year-Old Virgin.""  This is full of predictible jokes and gags.  Honestly, I've matured since seeing ""Bachelor Party 1,"" so there's a chance that young guys may like this one as much as I liked the first one.  Still, I found this underwhelming and a bit long, the only good part was the occasional coverage of male nudity.

3055645,1,B0010YSD54,"Horrible, boringly unfunny no budget, low quality direct to video stinker that shares only the name with the 1980's film. No laughs, good times or even a script here; it's just a waste of money and time (yours). I really wish people would stop putting actor Josh Cooke (Ron) in things. Whether it's a mediocre tv series that doesn't make it past 3 or 4 episodes before cancellation, or in this case, a horrible made for video sequel, Cooke is an automatic project killer. He seems to be the actor they get when ever other actor has said ""NO""... Even Harlan Williams was awful.",1406332800,,576,4.548076923076923

The plot lines was tactless and the acting was borderline retarded! The nudity was not even decent at best!

3055653,4,B0010YSD54,"I had no interest in watching it, but as it turned out, this movie was great. It has all of your movie cliches, the gorgeous bachelor, the big fat party animal, the grizzled married man, the jewish germaphobe and the evil future brother in law trying to get the groom on film in compromising positions. While it does have every cliche in the book, it has heart and American Pie humor.

The plot is a man is marrying into a wealthy company and the future father in law likes the groom better than his current son-in-law. So that son-in-law throws him an all out-big money bachelor party that seems to last a week. He uses this time to setup the good guy groom in awkward positions. There are several chances and several misses, but before the movie gets stale he meets a woman that could change his good guy ways and make him cheat.

Not to ruin the surprises, but each of the movie's characters have their own memorable storylines with big punchlines at the end.

Great movie, great adult fun, lots of craziness and antics, plenty of nudity if that's your thing and lots of high priced locales.",1290384000,,1094,4.4874371859296485

The loss of one star is due to the fact that they constantly had to have women taking off their shirts, bras, and bathing suits. Honest to God, it got to be boring. ladies upper parts all the time. So if you are some adolescent teenage boy and that's what you are looking for....well.....don't let Mom see you watching. I personally am in it for the crude humor, yes, that is so, and I freely admit it. The guys and the girls all are so much fun. Harland Williams, what a crack up. Just sit back and enjoy the raunchy and irreverent humor.  Not any real resemblance to the original but still tons of fun.",1416873600,,775,4.272108843537415
