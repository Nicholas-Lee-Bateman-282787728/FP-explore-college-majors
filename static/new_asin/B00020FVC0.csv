8019543,5,B00020FVC0,"I was interesting in seeing this movie, so I added it to my Wish List. Then, the next morning I went to my ""Free Movie"" list on Comcast and there it was listed as ""Order of Death"". I wanted to see it basically because I am a Huge fan of Harvey Keitel. He was extraordinary as always, however, co-starring Johnny Rotten? I assumed very bad acting, however, he was INCREDIBLE!!! Being a fan of the Sex Pistols has nothing to do with it (Besides, I more leaned towards Sid). Even though I have already seen it, I still have to own it. I am keeping it on my wishlist. The price presently being $0.98, are you kidding me??? Even it you hate it, it's the same price as a rental! Go for it. Actually I think I will NOW! :-)",1265414400,6,716,4.121428571428571
8019544,4,B00020FVC0,"Here's a film thats been floating around for a couple of decades now, and, until somebody manages to find the original its only going to be on crappy vhs to dvd transfers that you get to see it. All panned and scanned. I used to own an english cassette of this under its original title and have even heard of it being billed as both Psycho-Killer and the bizzare Psycho-Jogger as well as Cop Killer and the current, cashing-in-on-Keitel Corrupt Lieutenant. There's probably more out there if you care to look.
Titles aside, this is actually quite a good little thriller with a great performance from Keitel and a rather good first one from Lydon. The production is rather pedestrian but there's enough twists and turns in the complex plot to keep you guessing and I'm always surprised by the intense atmosphere which develops as the film progresses.
A very under appreciated movie that deserves better than a dollar-store release such as this. Legend has it that music from Lydons then-band Public Image Ltd. was to grace the score, but, alas, and indeed to some extent, alack, the sound track is a pretty generic library score.
Think about it though. It would have been good.",1261440000,6,1176,4.741463414634146

CORRUPT LIENTENANT
Stars Harvey Keitel and punk rocker Johnny Rotten. Keitel is a country music-loving NYC detective who imprisons and tortures cop-killer Johnny, but the masochistic creep-o only begs for more abuse. An odd, violent little movie.

Parenthetical number preceding title is a 1 to 10 imdb viewer poll rating.
