6129423,5,B00H2K95WK,i want to personally thank this seller for having season 7 and for the prompt service.  there's 8 dvds on here and just about every episode is 41 min. long!!  oxygen is really missing the boat by not putting the remaining seasons on dvd.  my fave episode is with ashley humphrey [husband was a bodybuilder who instructed her to murder the woman accusing him of sexual assault] and she gives a chilling recount of her crime.  season 7 is def. worth it with the 8 dvds!!!  i sure wish everyone could buy it ;).,1387756800,11,508,4.361702127659575

8629243,5,B00H2K95WK,I absolutely love Snapped. I'm  just waiting on season 7 to arrive & watch so I can order remaining seasons. I truly think it's highway robbery for the price  with it being an old season & only 43 episodes. In the end I am a happy snapping person. I am a huge fan of snapped and getting my DVD collection,1512864000,,304,4.05

8629248,4,B00H2K95WK,"I'm a huge fan of this show, reason why I spent the money on this set, I love the show and in this 7th season the chapters are longer, is great,. My only complaint is that the quality of the DVD is not very good, so far I have 2 disk that have cracked and I need the press with my fingers on the crack before playing it, otherwise it gets stocked inside the computer. (I watch in my desktop computer.)",1436400000,3,401,3.962962962962963
