8109380,1,B000EGDC9Q,"These DVDs are sold as a set when they could have put four or five episodes on a single DVD. They are cheesy and not very well done. Most of the time they are not actual footage -- when footage is available -- and they show cheesy less than cutting edge animation even when they could have shown the real thing. We bought all three sets, watched one and sent the other two back unopened to Amazon. Don't bother unless you have $89 a set to throw away. We are stuck with the opened set and don't have the heart to put it up for sale as we would feel like we are ripping the buyer off.",1210896000,12,583,3.9914529914529915
