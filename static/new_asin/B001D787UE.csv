8292011,5,B001D787UE,"After the Storm is a riveting story that held my attention for its full 54 minutes, and then some given the interesting Extras. The documentary accurately details the pressures tugging at the American fishing industry where safety and conservation are at odds and the issues are further complicated by culture. In presenting the facts, Directors JD Marlow and Amanda Bergeron entertain with beautiful photography, germane interviews and historical perspective. The editing by JD Marlow is masterful; he exhibits a talent that few, even with greater years of experience, have or use so effectively.",1230940800,,597,5.43010752688172
