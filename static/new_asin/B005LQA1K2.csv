This movie features tons of deep powder, insane jumps and drops, and plenty of boondocking through the trees. I get a couple of new snowmobile videos every year for our annual trip(usually to Island Park, ID), and the boondockers series is the favorite of our group as it is closer to the style of riding we do. Many of the snowmobile videos out there show some extreme riding, and then a bunch of dirt heads jumping over school buses with explosions going off, which is fun to watch but not something I am really interested in. This movie doesn't have any of that, just hard core deep powder riding. 5 stars.",1331424000,,679,4.483870967741935
