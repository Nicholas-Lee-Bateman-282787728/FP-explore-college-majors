8215842,5,B000LQTCES,"Hilarious collection of classic cross-over adult cartoons back in the 80's. Great price, fast shipping. Gave as a gift...he loved it!",1404691200,,133,5.380952380952381
8215843,5,B000LQTCES,"This DVD is a must-have for fans of Ren & Stimpy. These are all of the best episodes on one disc. There are three in the series but this is the one to get. You have to see the Rubber Nipple Salesman episode if you haven't yet. This is Ren & Stimpy at their best. These are all the classic episodes. These are definitely Saturday cartoon fodder. These are the sick and weird early shows. If you have never seen the early shows, you don't know what you are missing. In which case you might want to pass so that you don't get addicted like myself. Ren is the serious and grumpy character of the two and is embodied by a Chihuahua. Stimpy is the oblivious and dumb one. He is embodied by a cat. Don't ask me what kind of a cat because I can't figure that one out. He just looks weird like Ren. This comedy plays off of the characters' interaction which often results in conflicts but you can tell that they love each other. These episodes will leave you laughing out loud. They are truly hilarious. I cannot recommend this collection more. It's one that you will watch over and over again.",1361664000,,1085,4.271844660194175
