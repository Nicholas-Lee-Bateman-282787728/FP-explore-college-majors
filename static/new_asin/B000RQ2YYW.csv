***Spoiler Alert***

Vishal & Swati buy an apartment - the caretaker tells Vishal that the previous resident committed suicide, after killing her son. Swati does not know about this. When she finds out, she is angry but Vishal appeases her by telling her that ghosts do not exist. Swati starts behaving oddly.

Vishal sees her kill the watchman and he starts to believe in the supernatural. Their maid tells Vishal that Swati is possessed by the previous resident's spirit and they get an exorcist. The exorcist tells Vishal that he must find the spirit's mother - only she can help.

A big secret is revealed and you find out why the spirit was actually doing all those things. It keeps you at the edge of your seat, gripping suspense, nail-biting scenes, causes goosebumps - overall, it is worth your money! One of my favourite movies of all time!!! I was ""s*** scared"" after watching this movie... If you are a hardcore HORROR fan then you have to watch this!",1474156800,,1000,4.659090909090909

8202346,4,B000RQ2YYW,"Though I watched ""Bhoot"" some time ago, this is one Bollywood horror movie that has remained embedded in my consciousness compared to all the other trite offerings that purport to be Bollywood horror. What elevates this above average horror is the credible acting and pairing of leads Ajay Devgan and Urmila Matondkar who portray a married couple living in a haunted apartment, as well as credible performances by actors in supporting roles such as Rekha, Nana Patekar, Tanuja, Fardeen Khan, and Victor Banerjee. It also helps that the director, Ramgopal Varma, utilizes sound effects and lighting to create truly chilling scenes.

This is an atmospheric horror movie which though not wholly original - any fan of horror movies will find shades of ""Ju-On"", ""The Exorcist"" etc. in this story, does effectively deliver some authentic scares. The story revolves around married couple, Vishal (Ajay Devgan) and Swati (Urmila Matondkar) who are apartment hunting. Vishal is captivated by an apartment on the 12th floor of a building despite its ominous past - a young woman had apparently jumped to her death from the balcony. Being non-superstitious, Vishal leases the apartment without bothering to inform Swati.

Whilst Vishal goes off to work each day, Swati spends long hours in the apartment and before long, senses there is some creepy and supernatural presence in their home, one which she feels has malicious intent. Vishal dismisses his wife's concerns, attributing her ""delusions"" to a psychological problem and it is only much later, when his wife's very life and soul are at stake that Vishal struggles desperately against time to uncover the horrifying truth behind the manifestation.

The tightly-woven story and credible acting and good use of effects make this a creepy movie that has some genuinely scary moments. The fact that the movie has no songs in it, unlike many Bollywood movies is a plus point as it allows the story to flow without any jarring interruptions. All in all, this is well worth watching for fans of Asian & foreign horror movies.",1274486400,5,2064,5.100591715976331
