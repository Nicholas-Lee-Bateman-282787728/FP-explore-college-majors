8086884,5,B000BHUXDQ,"I began using Signing Time videos with my son when he was an infant and didn't have much luck at first, but then tried again around 15 months and he was soon using signs and saying words. I felt that it was infinitely helpful as he was learning to talk, because he could sign the word too, which often made it possible to know what he was trying to say before he could clearly articulate. Who knows how he would have turned out without signing, but I do wonder if it helped his language development because he is one of the most verbal children you'd ever want to meet! (5 yrs now). I highly recommend for all parents! My son loved this series and asked to watch it all the time, and would sing along with the songs. Includes useful words, and catchy music with thoughtful messages that reinforce sign usage. A final note: once he was fully verbal, he was not as interested in these, so may not be as suitable for older (hearing) children.",1317427200,,939,4.340909090909091

8086886,5,B000BHUXDQ,I purchased these dvd's for my 2 year old never expecting she would learn so fast. She really enjoys watching them and now uses sign language while she is communicating with us completely on her own. I have enjoyed learning as well and would highly recomend these for anyone wanting to learn sign language. Now we can't wait to get vol. 4-6.,1130803200,3,341,4.516129032258065
