5408795,1,B00AB65T2C,"I was a huge fan of the first three seasons. That being said, season four sucked.  It was quite apparant that the actors got too big for this show.  No one was willing to push the boundaries and make their character the butt of any joke.  Even when andre was getting masturbated like a giant penis was fake and unbeleiveable.  The heart of the show is gone. If season five is this bad I will quit while I'm ahead and remember the show during it's prime and not during the downfall. It's a shame too because now the show has a large following but people are saying it's good because they jumped on the bandwagon late and want to be part of this shows success.",1375833600,3,658,4.24

8549718,5,B00AB65T2C,Great show for anyone who likes sports or has any friends that play fantasy football.  I even got the wife into watching it as well.  The writers are always coming up with relevant story lines that pair with the NFL season and brings in celebrity guest appearances that make a pretty interesting talking point for every episode.,1437696000,,328,4.7368421052631575

8549722,5,B00AB65T2C,"Every year it keeps getting better and better!  My cable package doesn't include FXX, so I need to purchase the Blu Rays.  I hate that I'm a season behind, I have to remember what was going on during that Fantasy year, as opposed to being right in it.  But no complaints about the show or DVD itself.",1389052800,,300,4.228070175438597
8549723,5,B00AB65T2C,"The League returns for a fourth season of fantasy football hilarity. For those who do not know, The League focuses on a fantasy football league in Chicago. While fantasy football pervades nearly every aspect of their lives and the show, you do not need to know anything about fantasy football to enjoy the show. There are plenty of people, men and women, who love the show and don't play. Everyone can relate to the characters in one way or another, whether it is Ruxin believing he has to get his wife pregnant to keep her from leaving him, Kevin and Jenny trying to come up with a baby name, or Pete trying to win over his high school crush, everyone can find something to like in these characters.
One of the great things about the show is that it is only loosely scripted, which means that most of it is improved and you never know what you will get. While you can follow the show if you haven't seen season 1-3, I'd highly recommend watching it first as a few things that happen this season will make more sense if you do. However, it isn't necessary to do so.

While the extras are pretty funny, but it is hard to top how hilarious the show is on its own. If you enjoyed the show the first time around, buy it on so you can watch it over and over again.  Nearly every episode has an extended edition.

This season has a great feature called ""Season Mode"" where you can play all the episodes in a row.  Unfortunately, you cannot do this with the extended episode.  If you want to watch the extended episodes you have to select them individually.
