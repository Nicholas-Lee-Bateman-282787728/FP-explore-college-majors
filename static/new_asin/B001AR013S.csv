3465987,3,B001AR013S,I love Ghost Hunters but I was disappointed in this collection.  I thought it was going to be a bunch of the best whole episodes.  This is not the case.  It was interesting to see Grant and Jason talk about the clips that they were showcasing but I would say just buy the whole season or another collection.,1236902400,11,307,4.258620689655173
3465988,5,B001AR013S,"These DVD's are just as good as any Ghost Hunters program.  If you have Season 1 & 2, however, it is not really necessary to purchase this set.  There is not much more in them than in the regular shows.  But if you buy these instead of Season 1 & 2, you will not be disappointed!",1229817600,7,279,3.9464285714285716
3465989,5,B001AR013S,"I love ghost hunters,this two are great ,they show the scarist and weirdist shows, plus they show the filming team actually seeing weird things.all the great bonus scenes.(NO COMMERCIALS)I highly reccomend A++++...",1226188800,2,214,5.71875
3466000,1,B001AR013S,Do not buy. Only has 3 episodes. It is a collection of the GH's favorite scenes. I thought it would have more episodes. Do not buy unless you are a hard core fan and must own everything GH.,1324944000,,189,4.0
3466001,3,B001AR013S,Meh. The episodes included on these discs would not be my pics for best episodes from these seasons. They're ok. Not really worth owning the discs. Just watch reruns on the SciFi channel.,1324944000,,187,4.696969696969697
3466002,2,B001AR013S,"when I got this dvd it said it was in good condiction, well when i opened it up, it was scrached really bad, me and my fanicee put it in the dvd player and it started skipping really bad. it didn't even play after playing the first 10 minutes. Thankfully he knows how to clean dvds, after spending about 20 minutes cleaning it, trying to get the scraches out if finally worked. i wouldnt buy from these people again. i was very disspointed. the dvd was so scrached up i couldn't even watch it. and i had to waste my time trying to clean it just so i could.

i will not be buying from these people again.",1312588800,,603,4.110169491525424
3466003,5,B001AR013S,i loved this. in my eyes it shows that something is out there.on voulume two in the top 20 number 1 what i saw is no doubt that man was attacked.the thing flew up and hit him in the face before he moved. then he falls on his knees like he caught himself and it looked like he was pulled down to the floor.no one pushed that thing up to hit him.deffintly something attacked him.this is a deffintly legit show,1302912000,,407,4.1
3466004,5,B001AR013S,This was a hit for my ghost-hunter wannabes in the family! They watch it over and over - all their favorite episodes!,1292630400,,117,4.363636363636363
3466005,3,B001AR013S,"The package was recieved on time; however, the edges of the DVD case were crumpled (cardboard casing). Otherwise, the product itself is okay.",1291593600,,141,5.173913043478261
3466006,1,B001AR013S,"Just after this shipped, I heard rumors that TAPS had faked some of the evidence on their investigations, so I spent about 12 hours researching the web to see if there was any truth to the rumors.  My wife and I were big fans of TAPS and I gave them the benefit of the doubt every chance I could, but the evidence against them was overwhelming and I just couldn't believe Jason and Grant would fake their findings.  Many people said that it was a TV show and it was understandable to fake evidence to boost their ratings, But it's reality TV and Jason and Grant talk a lot about integrity and even state that, as a ghost hunter, maintaining professionalism and credibility isn't just for you, but for ghost hunters everywhere, which means they don't care about ghost hunters at all, or anyone for that matter.

Reminds me of an episode of Ghost Hunters I saw once where Jason and Grant found that the chandeliers were rigged to sway in a bar and a one-way mirror had a face in it as well as a recording of laughter that was rigged to go off when you opened a door during an investigation.  They seemed genuinely upset by what they found and Jason even said that if one thing is fake, you can't believe anything that's found - was that a metaphor for TAPS and the places they investigate?

Like I said, this item shipped before I found out about the evidence that Jason and Grant fake and it was too late to cancel the shipment, and I regret giving any support to the fraudulent sham they call Ghost Hunters.",1268697600,3,1507,4.367857142857143

I've been watching Ghost Hunters (via satellite and in the States) from almost the very beginning. I've now seen the original programs and have read the books of Jason and Grant too. I have to say that I believe that ghosts may exist, but I want some kind of evidence. Some kind of proof. These investigators -- and their paranormal investigation team -- work on the same premise. They attempt to ""debunk"" paranormal claims, but when they gather evidence that is hard to ""debunk"" or ""dispute,"" they are left with evidence that may actually support life after death (i.e., ghost, paranormal activity).

While Ghost Hunters works with a scientific leaning by utilizing technical equipment from EMF meters / K2 meters, digital thermometers, night vision cameras and thermal sensor equipment, etc., other paranormal programs utilize spirit mediums and the like. While I do not discount psychic mediums and sensitives, their evidence is hard to prove or ""debunk."" Nevertheless, programs like ""Paranormal State"" and ""Paranormal Cops"" (broadcast on A&E) have their place as well. They are certainly interesting. Psychic mediums like John Edward and Chip Coffee are quite interesting. In fact, I've been watching John Edward for many years. He's gotten a bit ""mushy"" as of late (even for WE) -- his original program on SyFy used to display his medium abilities more readily. In short, more readings.

Writers and psychic researchers like Peter Cayce are also quite interesting. Peter Cayce utilizes Science, Philosophy and Religion to come up with explanations for the afterlife and reincarnation and Karma. Interesting material.

In any case, the paranormal field is an interesting one. I'd really like to see more programs about legitimate psychics and paranormal investigators like Ghost Hunters, John Edward and Peter Cayce.
