And in Cinzia Forte and Saimir Pirgu we have two leads who actually have voice to burn, a rarity nowadays. They sing at a comfortable level was good residence without anyone feeling pushed. And the sound quality is worth mentioning. The 5.1 recording is outstanding, it's one of the best I've heard. I got a real sense of the stage and the orchestra - it was like having good orchestra seats, without noise from thw audience. The sound for the orchestra was clear and well balanced from the deepest bass right up to the violins.
Violetta's friend Gaston was wearing a jacket we used to call ""Uranium Green"" and she is dressed in a red gown. The back up on the extras was a little bit on the off side but frankly they played very minor role here. Alfredo was in tones of grey. In my notes I kept referring to the sound this is so will recorded!
Unlike many recordings these days Violeta and Alfredo actually interact with each other and sing to each other. They take center stage, and at the end when Alfredo leaves after ""Addio"", the conductor starts with a presto and shifts to prestissimo to clear out the guests who have been at the side. Forte goes into ""Ah, fors'e lui"" and continues to the end alone, in a tour de force manner.
She is excellent in Act Two as well, but the scene with Germont Pere is a bit forced, as he is stiff. As soon as Alfredo returns she is able to be vulnerable again. The casino scene is very well done, starting rather fast, and gradually slowing to the end, reflecting more and more the tragedy unfolding. Alfredo winds up face down, flat on the floor, looking broken.
This production makes use of body language in a quietly effective manner that others miss.
I'm impressed with this conductor, Paolo Arrivabeni, his long arc of vision and his control of the orchestra.
The camera is intelligently used and spends all the time necessary to capture the atmosphere of each shot.
There are many large productions that would benefit from the intelligence used in presenting this one.
The great 5.1 sound doesn't hurt either.
The Third Act is fairly straightforward. No over-dramatization, no Zombie make-up, Forte lets the music speak.
I hope you'll take the chance to see this production and the 5.1 sound is really great!",1411689600,,2360,4.5947867298578196
8381684,5,B002UZCJG6,"This is a more modern production but not one that has been totally spoilt.  There are some strange and weird moments as in all modern opera.  However, Saimir's singing and acting is amazing.  There are too many opera singers who just sing so I have to agree with the other reviewer that Giovanni Meoni is one of those and is stiff.  Saimir more than makes up for him and has the same on stage vibrance as Plcido Domingo.  In fact, he reminds me rather a lot of the young Domingo.  Within minutes you forget about the lousy sets and get caught up with the gorgeous voices of both Saimir and Cinzia.  I watch opera on DVD while on the treadmill as it stops me from getting bored and motivates me to work out.  This DVD made want to keep going on the treadmill as I was enjoying it so much.  This is a DVD I will watch more than once.",1347753600,,831,4.14375
8381685,4,B002UZCJG6,"In spite of the atrocious costumes of Kaat Tilley and the ghastly sets of Edoardo Sanchi, this was an excellent La Traviata.  Really, Alfredo wore the same optical sharkskin suit through the entire production.  His father--and most of the other male roles and choristers--wore ghoulish makeup and a hideous suit with a vampiric collar.  What era this was supposed to be is anyone's guess...maybe it's set in another dimension.  That would explain a lot.

Aside from the staging issues, the singing and acting of Cinzia Forte as Violetta was excellent and probably helped carry everyone else along. Tenor Saimir Pirgu was a pretty fine Giorgio Germont and he gets second place for acting.  Giovanni Meoni, who played Giorgio Germont, the meddling father, was an excellent singer, but stiff as a board in his delivery. Chris De Moor as the baron is most memorable for his ghastly makeup and attire. Same comment for Flora, played by Tineke Van Ingelgem.  The chorus sang beautifully.  At the party where the gypsies and bullfighters appear there was the nowadays usual wardrobe malfunction leaving one woman briefly topless--as if this opera needed something risque.

This DVD was filmed in 2009 at the Opera Royal de Wallonie, which is in Liege, Belgium.  Let's watch for Cinzia Forte at better and better venues.",1283904000,,1312,5.032407407407407
