WTTW was also thoughtful enough to include the original commercials. :P  The disc is also letterboxed for 4:3 televisions, which means on today's sets, there is a black bar on the sides as well as the top and bottom.  Come on, WTTW.  Time to toss these old discs and remaster this wonderful program.",1487980800,,427,4.367088607594937

8421570,5,B004B7PVOS,"Geoffrey Baer does an incredible job of bringing the past to life. I'd grown up in St. Charles, Il, and had no idea of the fascinating history behind my old home town. Now, when I go back, I look at my little city with fresh eyes and renewed pride. He doesn't dwell too long in one area, so it moves along at a great pace without feeling rushed. I highly recommend to anyone who's interested in history.",1470182400,,403,4.246753246753247
