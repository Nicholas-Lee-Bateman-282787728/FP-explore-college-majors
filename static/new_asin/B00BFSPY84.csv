5615586,1,B00BFSPY84,"BUYERS BEWARE, format was crap, like it was played on a tv and captured with a cam.",1407283200,3,83,3.9411764705882355
5615587,5,B00BFSPY84,"Five stars because this film is impossible to get in an official studio release. The print for this Korean import is, though not digitized, decent enough, on a par with the one shown on Cable. It is presented in its original aspect ratio 2:35 to 1, and it is fully Anamorphic (on my Blu-ray player, but not in older models, don't know why), and it is complete, including the Studio logo. The sound is in 2 channel Stereo.

The plot is the typical treasure hunt opus from the 50'samid spectacular locales. Nowadays you don't get to see locations (in this case the Greek isles) the way they are presented here. To watch Loren and Ladd traipsing all over the Acropolis is quite a sight to behold. This is a must for lovers of Loren, beautiful locations, escapist plots and the glory that was CinemaScope.",1406160000,19,801,4.5625

5615589,3,B00BFSPY84,"The subtitles must have been done from one of the other languages this film was done in (maybe Korean).
The words on the screen don't match the words coming from the actors mouth at all.
Also a little expensive for such an old movie.
This is surely an original version, not a remastered, but I still like the story.",1402358400,,315,4.3559322033898304

5615591,5,B00BFSPY84,"I only wish this copy were digitized, so I could sharpen the images.  Still, none-the-less, an important and beautiful work of art, and a essential step to be seen in the career of Sophia Loren.",1395014400,2,194,4.542857142857143

5615594,5,B00BFSPY84,"I have it on PAL and hope to buy this DVD that is region free. The movie grows on you. Sophia was pretty new in American movies and Ladd and Webb are both good searching for the Boy On A Dolphin. Actually one, from the movie, is in a parking lot in Los Angeles across from a famous Hamburger stand. And nobody seems to know what it is. I wish I owned it but I am sure it isn't for sale. I cannot afford it and would like it in front of a theater I am opening soon.",1384387200,,464,3.7448979591836733
5615595,4,B00BFSPY84,"The movie was as good as I remember it.  The English language captioning, however, was hysterical!  Captions had clearly been translated into Korean  (the DVD was of Korean manufacture) and then back into English.  ""You may say it's only a statue, and what can a statue achieve?"" (from the song with the credits) was given as:  ""Is alone and can't get any.""",1381190400,4,357,4.693548387096774

5615619,3,B00BFSPY84,"This is an old film with Sophia Loren, portraying the girl of a Greek diver that finds a rare statue off the southern coast of the Greek island of Hydra. Alan Ladd plays the part of an archaeologist who is trying to convince her not to sell the statue of the boy on top of a dolphin to a dubious art collector, played by Clifton Webb. It is a fairly thin and transparent plot, amusing at times and easy to watch. The views of the island of Hydra are very good and at the time the film was very good publicity for the island as a tourist attraction. What annoys me with some film directors is the fact that they assume their audiences are either stupid or uneducated. There are many underwater shots in this film, all filmed in the open ocean, probably somewhere in America and certainly not in the Aegean See, as there were giant kelps shown around the statue and no such kelps exist in Greek waters. Having filmed everything else on the island of Hydra all they had to do was to film the underwater sequences there as well, in order to make the film more acceptable to the educated viewer.",1483574400,,1090,4.321951219512195
5615620,5,B00BFSPY84,"It is difficult to explain to today's generations the wonder that the process of CinemaScope was after growing up watching square images, not to mention the additional joy of Stereophonic sound!

When I was growing up in the 50s, ""Boy On A Dolphin"" was one of my favorite adventure films. I wanted to be like Alan Ladd and go to the Mediterranean scuba diving for treasures, and maybe bumping into Sophia Loren...

For years, this movie was shown on TV in a dim, greenish print. This new Blu-Ray release is a stunner. From the moment Marni Nixon* sings the title song over the opening credits, you're hooked. And it's all shot on REAL Greek locales - not one shred of the phony looking CGIs that plague today's crass movies.

If you're a fan of Ladd, Loren or Webb; adventure flicks, movies from the 50s, don't miss this welcome Blu-Ray release!

The film itself is pretty much your standard adventure yarn set in Greece.
20th Century Fox hoped to emulate the success of Three Coins in the Fountain with another exotic location movie,and indeed the Greek locations are a very important part of this film,they look magnificent in blu ray. Add to this the star power of Alan Ladd,Sophia Loren,and Clifton Webb and you've got an entertaining 111 minutes. My only criticism is that the skin tones in some scenes have a slightly orange tint ,but most of the film is fine and crisp and clear...relax and enjoy the scenery including Sophias' famous entrance as she rises out of the water!",1478217600,2,755,4.5588235294117645

5615636,5,B00BFSPY84,"This mini-review is for the Kino Lorber Blu Ray released in Oct. 2016. As always, it's unfortunate that Amazon doesn't create separate entries for significantly different movie releases - I guess that they never will. It makes a lot of the reviews misleading or useless but you can still wade through all of the recent reviews and see which ones are for Blu Ray.

Especially given what has been previously out on DVD for this film, this Kino Lorber release is amazing, visually. I am 64 and remember this film well from when I was a kid. It's not very good is it? But, Sophia Loren, with minimal makeup and dressed in simple and lovely long dresses and then of course, with the famous wet clothing scenes, is absolutely beautiful. Well worth the price!",1477699200,6,752,4.611940298507463
5615637,4,B00BFSPY84,"At last this colorful CinemaScope film is available on blu-ray.  Looks good but colors could be a bit more vivid.

5615639,4,B00BFSPY84,"I originally saw the film in a theatre when it was first released and never forgot it (what 13-year-old boy could see this movie--in Cinemascope and glorious Technicolor-- and not have the image of Sophia emerging from the sea over the gunwale of the fishing boat engraved in his memory for life?).

This import worked fine for me in a Sony Blu-ray player and looked great on a 1480p HD screen.  The underwater scenes are nothing spectacular, but the Greek location shots are on the upper side of stunning; I was immediately wanting to visit Greece.

The story-line and dialogue exceeded my expectationsnot really remembering much of that from my first viewing (not remembering much of anything except Sophia, to tell the truth). The cinematography and production values probably rate a weak 5 and the story and script a weak 4. The final scene could have been left offfeels like a slap-on addition done to make sure the viewers know how the story is ending.",1468022400,6,958,4.793939393939394

5615650,5,B00BFSPY84,"Boy on a Dolphin was the first American film for Sophia Loren.  The title of the movie relates to a Statue that Phaedra, find underwater of a small boy riding a dolphin like a jockey.  Alan Ladd is Dr. James Calder, an archeologist who meets Loren and end up following her to the Greek island where she lives.  Clifton Webb is the very proper Englishman, Victor Parmalee.  He is really a well to do scavenger, who wants the statue for himself.  Ladd seems a bit miscast as the leading man.  He was better in Shane. Because he is shorter than Loren, she had to walk in a trench, so Ladd would look taller.  It is funny and dramatic.  The cinematography is wonderful and the Greek Island of Hydra never looked better. Loren is beautiful as always and as always a good actress.

But what really makes this film is Greece as it was in the 1950's. An early jet setters paradise, not the jammed ant hill it is today. Wonderfully filmed with the shimmering Aegean Sea in the background and  the ethereal background score of by Hugo Friedhoffer. I love the scenes of the world-wise, rich and arrogant Victor Parmalee ( mastered by the always wonderful Clifton Webb) lecturing the poor, ignorant Greek fishermen on the ways of the international art market while aboard his yacht.  As if he were speaking to children with low IQ's. Too bad this film is not in a digital format.  But, this will have to do for now.",1414368000,2,761,4.54014598540146
