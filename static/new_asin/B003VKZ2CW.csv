8406885,5,B003VKZ2CW,for my graddaughter - she's been dancing since 3 years of age /so she very much loved this video.,1453334400,,97,4.157894736842105
8406886,1,B003VKZ2CW,"Quality control problem. This multi-disc set came with a duplicate disc, and is missing the most important one! Very frustrated!! Will need to work with Amazon to straitened this out. Very upset",1389052800,2,194,5.09375
8406887,5,B003VKZ2CW,"For anyone who loves ballet this is a great box set of 4 fabulous documentaries.  My favorite is Etoiles.  The behind the scenes look at the Paris Opera Ballet was completely engrossing.  The rehearsal footage of La Sylphide is incredibly beautiful.  The mini documentaries about Zakharova and Lopatkina are very enjoyable.  It's amazing to see the work ethic behind two incredible ballerinas who always seem to be pushing for more.  For anyone interested in ballet or in love with ballet, as I am, I would recommend this collection.",1370476800,2,533,5.0
8406888,5,B003VKZ2CW,"Excellent package for ballet lovers.  ""Etoiles""  was
the least entertaining but most informative.
Both ""Prima Ballerina"" and ""Ballerina"" made riveting
viewing with wonderful dancers in the Russian style.
A must for lovers of classical ballet these 2 DVDs.
""The Dancer"" a diversion into Scandanavian style which
was interesting.  Also highly entertaining and informative.",1352851200,4,370,5.943396226415095
8406889,5,B003VKZ2CW,"Am thrilled I got these 4 DVDs for a bargain price, compared to how much I would have paid for them individually.  Any ballet lover will enjoy these DVDs.",1311638400,5,154,4.310344827586207
8406890,5,B003VKZ2CW,"I watched Ballerina and wanted more. Voila! The Art of Ballet gives you an inside look that is literally just that. There's no spin, no 'Ballerina's have dark, sad lives devoid of love, etc.' These ladies do it because they love it, and some have familes. In Ballerina, one retires for two years, get's married and has a daughter, and then comes back to Ballet, where she is lauded as 'better than ever.'

It's engrossing, it's well shot, it's worth the buy. I loved it!",1297123200,6,470,4.529411764705882
8406891,4,B003VKZ2CW,"All four of these selections were previously issued as separate DVDs, sold through and reviewed on Amazon. The package price is a good deal if one doesn't have any of the previously-issued DVDs. All of these DVDs were very good, with Etoiles being the best and most informative. The Dancer is interesting, although, contrary to what one reviewer said,the girl never became an international star of any magnitude.

Anyone intersted in this DVD should check the Amazon reviews of the four separately-issued DVDs.

Not having watched this DVD, I don't know if any cuts have been made.",1288742400,11,581,4.979381443298969
