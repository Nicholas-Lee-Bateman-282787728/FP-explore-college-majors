8375520,4,B002NWRMMW,Clear and informative presentation on 5-pillars of Islam and how closely they correlate with all believers in God's grace.,1435622400,,122,5.473684210526316
8375521,5,B002NWRMMW,"It is very important to expand our views about what other people believe beyond the confines of the ""News at 9""  framework. This PBS series on world religions does that well, without judging the content or providing a bias, pro or con. We appreciated this thoughtful series.",1432166400,,274,4.829787234042553

8375523,3,B002NWRMMW,"The video started out very promising, with beautiful images n compelling interviews. However, perhaps due to the time constraints (just 1 hour), it began to feel rushed n turned out a little anticlimatic in the end.
I think the concept was good, but the video tried to achieve too much - talking about the 5 pillars of islam, introducing us to 6 pilgrims n bringing us to 7 different mosques around the world and explaining the historical significance of each. In the end, however, the video felt a little choppy, n the audience wasn't able to properly connect w the characters enough to lead to the climatic moment of reaching the ka'aba. I think, had the video been 2 hours long, it could have achieved all the ambitious objectives it had set for itself. But as matters stand, apart from the gorgeous images, it fell short.",1338508800,2,825,4.657534246575342
8375524,5,B002NWRMMW,"I can now see why this DVD has gained straight five-star reviews. It is an excellent reminder of the greatness that the Islamic ummah had during its golden period and of the potential that it has for the future, inshaAllah. It is wonderfully and artistically filmed as well. Trust me; it will make you want to travel to these spiritually and / or culturally important sites.",1337299200,,374,4.681818181818182
8375525,5,B002NWRMMW,"The presentation of the different parts of the muslim world and the meeting of the people from there, to go to Meca, makes this movie fantastic.",1325116800,3,144,4.576923076923077
8375526,5,B002NWRMMW,"Great movie.  Didn't skip or pause like some of my other ""New"" DVDs.  Beautiful mosques.  Was intrigued about the mosque in Africa.",1301788800,3,131,4.863636363636363
