8517706,5,B007IQCZEI,"It makes me wonder how a movie this great can be so unnoticed.  It is a film made by Latter-day Saints, and mainly for LDS also.  It is so well acted, so sophisticated in its nuances, such a treasure for the heart.  It pains me that Deseret Book failed to promote this gem of a production as it so deserved.  Dang sad.  This should have absolutely been released on Blu ray.",1462924800,,373,4.197183098591549
8517707,5,B007IQCZEI,"I love this film. It is simple, slow moving, and profoundly deep. I find ideas expressed and lessons learned here,  pop up often in other parts of my life. Diantha's Crossing is a powerful and rich story.",1413244800,,204,4.513513513513513
