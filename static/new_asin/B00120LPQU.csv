3071387,5,B00120LPQU,"Macho Man Randy Savage, 2 Time WWE World Champion, 4 Time WCW World Heavyweight Champion, one of the longest reigning Intercontinental Champions in WWE History (13+ months).  Not to mention he is the only Pro Wrestler to pick up 4 wins in one night at WWE's biggest event of the year, WrestleMania!  At WrestleMania IV Randy Savage secured 4 wins to capture is first of 6 World titles throughout his long running career.

Randy Savage became well known for his legendary feuds with such greats as:  Ricky Steamboat, The Honkytonk Man, Brutus Beefcake, Hulk Hogan, Dusty Rhodes, Ted DiBiase, Andre the Giant, Ric Flair, Jake the Snake Roberts, Shawn Michaels, Crush, Bret Hart, DDP, Sting, Kevin Nash, The Big Show -aka- The Giant, The Ultimate Warrior & Lex Lugar.

How many more legendary feuds does the Macho Man need to have before the WWE puts together a DVD to celebrate his contributions to the wrestling world??

Lastly, name one other wrestling athlete that has been bitten by a King Cobra(WWF Superstars Nov. 1991), was apart of WWE's first ever Wedding:  Summer Slam 1991...and before Shawn Michaels was ever punched out by Mike Tyson at WrestleMania 14 Savage had his own problems in 1990 with Buster Douglas, at the time the current World Boxing Champion...Savage/Hogan had a title match on Saturday Night's Main Event & after Hogan got the win, Buster busted Randy!

8243499,4,B00120LPQU,"It's to bad that The WWE pulled the plug on this DVD. Randy Savage is one of my all time favorite wrestlers. His best years like Hulk Hogan was in the 80's. His feud with such superstars as George The Animal Steel and Ricky Steamboat is the stuff of legends. I use to like when George was always trying to steal Miss. Elizabeth away from Randy. And Randy got so jealus and mad when George sent her flowers and candy.
I also loved when Hulk Hogan and Randy joined forces and became The Mega Powers. Loved there match at Summerslam against The Mega Bucks. Classic stuff.
I also enjoyed the match with Randy and Flair at Wrestlemania 8 when Macho won The WWE championship for the 2nd time.",1214870400,4,686,4.3671875
8243500,4,B00120LPQU,"Regardless of whether Vince McMahon and Randy Savage get along he played a huge part in pro wrestling history in the US in the 1980's and 1990's and deserves a DVD retrospective.  McMahon has put ""bad feelings"" aside for retrospectives featuring Hulk Hogan, the Von Erichs, Tully Blanchard and others, not too mention Brett Hart.  Only if Savage were truly not interested in participating would there be a logical reason to not finish this collection.

That said, Savage had many memorable matches against wrestling's biggest stars over two decades.  Matches against Hogan (WM 5), Flair (WM8, Jan 1996  Monday Nitro Title Win), Ted DiBiase (WM 4 Title Win), tag matches at SummerSlam 88 (Hogan/Savage vs Andre/DiBiase), Savage/Brett Hart vs Flair/Shawn Michaels from 1992, the list goes on.  Win or lose Savage brought athleticism and high energy to his performances.  He deserves a fitting retrospective.",1213747200,4,905,5.243055555555555

He is without a doubt one of the greatest champions and entertaining performers to ever set foot in the ring but doesn't get so much as a classic superstars figure.

I am not sure what Macho Man did that was so bad (perhaps the cherry picking Stephanie McMahon rumours are true)But either way it's sad that Macho Mans fans can't get a good retrospective of this legend.

We deserve a DVD... Make it happen WWE.",1204070400,8,540,4.5
