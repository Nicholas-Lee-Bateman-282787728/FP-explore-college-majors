7903096,4,B000003K8U,"Chief O'Brien (Colm Meany) finds a new way of having marital problems in ""Star Trek: Deep Space Nine,"" Episode 104, ""The Assignment"" (Story by David R. Long & Robert Ledermanm, Teleplay by David Weddle & Bradley Thompson, Aired October 28, 1996).  Keiko (Rosalind Chao) returns from Bajor and announces to her husband that she is an alien entity that has taken possession and is holding his wife's body hostage.  The entity starts giving O'Brien a series of instructions and warns him that Keiko will be killed if he does not obey.  What follows is a dangerous game as O'Brien has to obey the entity and try not to do anything that will harm the station.  In order to outsmart the entity, O'Brien is going to need some help.
I seem to remember that at one point in ""Star Trek: The Next Generation"" somebody expressed a concern at all the times alient entities have taken over Captain Picard's mind (I do not remember if it was an actual episode, novel, comic book or even if it was another series).  But having your mind taken over by an alien entity is a standard ""Star Trek"" plot device and it happens to everybody sooner or later.  It had already happened to O'Brien.  So the chief attraction to ""The Assignment"" is not the plot, but the fact that Miles gets to actually play the lead role in the episode and that you know in the end he is going to come up with some nice little gizmo or rewire something a certain way to help save the day.  Plus, I like who it is Miles gets to help him.  Meanwhile, Keiko gets play both emotional extremes, as the frightened Keiko and the rather sadistic entity, which is a nice change of pace for Chao.  But if ""The Assignment"" were about anybody other than Miles O'Brien, I would probably have rated it a star lower.",1072828800,,1756,4.459375
7903097,3,B000003K8U,"Well, what's good for one member of the O'Brien family is good for another.
In the earlier ST: NG episode, Miles O'Brien (Colm Meaney) becomes the pawn of a malevolent alien that possesses him. This time around his wife Keiko (Rosalind Chao) is taken over by one of the evil Pah'wraiths (that will fit so prominently in DS9's final season).
While not a notable episode, it still allows a supporting character a chance to steal the spotlight and Chao does a superb job at doing just that.",1049155200,,487,4.609195402298851
7903098,5,B000003K8U,"Personally, I love to see an actor I admire play someone truly, subtly, sadistically be evil! Here Keiko Obrian gets taken over by an incredibally sadistic entity, a pah'wraith (Bajoran version of a demon). This thing threatens to kill Keiko and her daughter, Molly unless this demon gets exactly what it wants from Miles.. and she does it with a smile on her face. Any fans of Angelus from Buffy the Vampire Slayer will ove this character. This was one of my favorite episodes for the sheer acting and story-telling ability and the glee that I got from watching that evil grin!",997401600,,578,4.676470588235294
7903099,4,B000003K8U,"Keiko has been on vacation and went to the Bajoran Fire Caverns. When she returns to DS9 it is apparent that she is not the same Keiko and has infact  been taking over by an alien entity that wants O'Brien to make some  modifications to the station or she'll kill Keiko. O'Brien must work in  secret not able to risk telling the others in the hope that once this alien  has finished with Keiko he'll get her back!
A great O'Brien episode that  has lots of tension and top notch special effects...",966729600,3,496,4.3478260869565215
