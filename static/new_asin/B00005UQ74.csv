8187734,5,B00005UQ74,"Why its called 5 Super Fighters, I don't know. Three students of Monkey Style are forced to take revenge for their master when he is beaten up by a stanger. Each student vows to find a new teacher and return to fight the stranger in 6 months. Unaware of the decision of his students the old master turns to the bottle and stops teaching. Many Shaw style training sequences take place during the movie and the students return on their masters birthday to fight the stranger.
This is really a great movie to see monkey stlye, I believe these 3 students are in Two Champions of Death and play monkey style fighers hired by the Bad Guys.
The DVD quality is what is you can expect from from a dubbed VCR tape to DVD. This is quite normal for a movie of this type and any true kung fu movie collector wouldn't worry about this.
There are a 3-4 instances where the sound is turned down during fight sequences, which doesn't really hurt the movie.
I rate movies based upon the content, the actors, and costumes and humour. The quality of the DVD has little to do with how I rate these types of movies.
This type of movie is nothing like Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon or Iron Monkey. If your looking for movies like that don't bother watching this.",1014940800,9,1240,4.395652173913043
