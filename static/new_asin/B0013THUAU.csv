Quality Publications needs to change their name to Fuzz Ball Publications based upon this film, that is closer to the quality of this DVD. To me, the fussy sample picture of Keaton on the ad was far clearer than anything on the DVD. The film sadly needs some major loving care. Despite my eyestrain, the movie's story was fun.",1503878400,,389,4.416666666666667
8252802,4,B0013THUAU,"For the movie itself, I absolutely love it! Someone else would be better at detailing Keaton's career -- his move from independent moving making to taking up with MGM and the subsequent decline of his career. You don't have to worry about that here. The first at MGM being the Cameraman, this movie coming out three years after the move. This has all the Keaton humor I love. Actually, one scene had me laughing so hard I had tears streaming from my eyes. I don't know how anyone was able to work with him in a scene and still keep a straight face. Charlotte Greenwood I specifically have to mention for her physical agility and being able to keep up with Buster. Word has it her trademark was her high kick as well as being double jointed and working in vaudeville. Good cast!... Great story, great dialog, great humor, great stunts. I'm amazed more people aren't completely in love with this film.

For the DVD itself... Quality Information Publishers did an excellent job getting this onto a DVD and even providing a lovely menu and DVD case; but, I would really like to see the film itself restored. Audio is excellent. But the film is a bit hazy, so you will have trouble making out faces, the edges blend.. You can see from the product photos. Also dithering when the screen is black, but that shouldn't be a problem since it's not showing anything. So what I mean is, Quality Information Publishers did the best with what's available, but I really hope some enthusiast or club gives this the restoration it so deserves that his other films got. It's an old movie and that's what happens. I read even Jaws (1975) had to be restored (research 'film preservation' online). I'm at least happy I can own a copy.

Anyway, I'll take this. If you're a fan of Keaton's, I definitely recommend seeing and owning ""Parlor, Bedroom and Bath"".",1293840000,,1836,4.594512195121951
