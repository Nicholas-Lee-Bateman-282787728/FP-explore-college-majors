6373579,3,B00JKTCC8K,"I'm often surprised to discover that anime doesn't follow completely follow Sturgeon's Law, well above 10% of anime is ""good"" for varying values of good.

This series still avoids the greater part of the Sturgeon's Law: it is not crap. But, there is sadly little enough to recommend it. I had to think long and hard before I started writing this review, and I still can't think of anything memorable about the anime. I didn't hate it, but I also didn't remember it all that well.

It's basically your 'typical' girl ninja-on-girl ninja story, and it does feel real weird to be able to call something a typical story like that. There's action, there's humor, there's fan service. It's enjoyable to watch, then you can forget it, which you probably will without my prompting you to do so.

Not a terrible show, which does damn it with faint praise. If you are a die-hard collector of anime, OK, I can recommend this. For your pre-teen kids, maybe not so much.",1410134400,,957,4.617647058823529

the 6 extra bonus episodes are not included with the funimation release
funimation has confirmed that they do not own the licensing rights to the bonus footage so the discs are not defective
the box is just labeled incorrectly

putting that aside, this show is based on a video game and is a very good adaptation. You can buy the game in america right now for 3DS and it will be available on PSvita in a month.

if you have not seen this anime yet it is beautiful. There are quite a few risque scenes but no nudity. just a typical harem comedy.",1406592000,20,587,4.185840707964601
6373593,5,B00JKTCC8K,The English voices seem like they go with every single character in the anime! I've never seen this done in any anime before with English voice actors. Even with Naruto some English voice actors just don't fit the anime characters personality.

This is a blu-ray DVD combo pack although it doesn't say that it is except on the picture is you look closely and that's not a problem for me either. The annoying thing is, is that both the 2 DVD's and the Blu-Ray are in Blu-Ray cases so you have to pay attention and read this disc to know which one you are watching.",1462492800,6,410,3.9518072289156625

6373614,4,B00JKTCC8K,"This is an anime about ninjas, fighting and fanservice moments, lots and lots of fanservice. Please ejoy!

Characters and Plot: (minor spoliers only) This show follows the training and lifes of 5 girls from the Hanzo high school acamedy for ""good"" ninjas. The girls are  Asuka Hanzo: the granddaughter of the ninja schools founder. Katsuragi: a girl whos ninja parents ran away after a failed mission so she trains to be a super ninja like them one day. Ikaruga: who is the groups leader, who was adopted by a rich guy to continue the ninja lifestyle, but sometimes her over seriousness attitude takes over too much. Yagyu: the one eye'ed umbrella carrying member of the group who has a pretty much nonexistant emotional base, but her only emotions seems to come out when Hibari is in danger. Hibari: is the most innocent and happy going of the group, always seeming to have a smile on her face. Her stereotype of the show is the clumbsy ditzy girl of the show. Kirira sensei: is the head teacher of the school and all its students (only 5 are enrolled in the entire school). Daid'ji: she is (what the show calls her) the legendary student who never wants to graudate but to help train the students who come threw, She is 25 years old. (a bit old to still be in high school much?) She is not shown very much in the show at all, and when she is its for a few minutes at most.  One day on a mission the group attacked by group of girls from Hebij' Clandestine Girls Academy aka the ""evil"" ninja school. Now the girls must train to defeat their enemies from taking over!

Pros: this is a action packed series with good fighting. The plot is most developed, what I mean by that is that its developed good around the characters ie backgrounds, training, and friendship all around. (I'll explain whats not good about the plot development in the Cons section).This show is mostly a  fanservice show, so you will see a lot of panties, bra's, girls gropeing eachother breasts, and clothes disappearing, so fanservice lovers will like this series a lot.

Cons: Plot development in the sense of story line, it's mostly developed slowly where the main point of the show is to defeat the ""evil"" ninjas. Now you have probley knowticed that I used ""good"" and ""evil"" in quotation marks this is why, in the show they talk about good and evil ninja's alot, for instance it seems like anyone who is a ninja is either a good ninja because they train in Hanzo acamedy. Or they are evil ninja for not training there. Even the villans of the show even admit to being ""evil"" ninja's, even its agents their will and wishes because in order to be a good ninja you need to have no arrest record at all, so if you have a record of any kind you are automatically disquallfied from being a good ninja. Also if you do NOT like to watch or like in general perverted anime then I would stay away from this because of the fanservice it shows tons of boobs, panties, bra's, bikini and butt shots a lot in the show.

Side Note: after researching the genra of this show it is to note that it claims its only an action anime but there are many scenes where it is fanservice heavy and also between Yagyu and Hibari there is a non blood relative sister relationship which sometimes overlaps into an ""I care about you a lot"" Yuri (aka lesbian) relationship.  Also at times Katsuragi is sometimes constancally feeling her friends boobs and groping them with them complainging but never really stopping her, if you get my drift. There is no kissing or any love scenes but it is implied something is going on.

Over all: I liked this show but as of 5-31-2015, this show is being asked for $40.00 and there is only 12 episodes and apparently there is a misprint on the box so it does NOT include the other 6 OVA episodes that happen after the main series ended.",1433030400,7,3816,4.463414634146342
6373615,5,B00JKTCC8K,The bast show  yet i am now  a senran kagura  fan i also pick up ps4 game of senran kagura,1430697600,,90,3.4
6373616,3,B00JKTCC8K,"i started out from the 3DS game Burst and it was fun and tight on harder difficulties ( on yang )

saw the announcement that they will make an animated series and got excited to buy this , now as for my experience after watching all episodes its moderately good  overall , the art style on the girls are perfect , sound track is excellent but comparing to Burst's game story pacing and action it really makes the anime somewhat of a let down .

see although this is an Ecchi anime with some ninja girls action but the fights in the anime is short lived and could of done WAAAYYYY BETTER !!! ,  and even the events of the anime kinda rushes things up abit so that confused me a bit .

overall it was a good watch and has some funny fan service moments , tho in my eyes the girls has more potential to be more developed and be more serious its just the genre that the show represents  , also being that this set has both dvd & BR it gives you more option on where to watch

just don't expect it to be better than the games cuz im playing Estival Vs on PS4 and that game destroys the anime in everything .

should be good for fans to watch thats for sure .",1430697600,2,1153,4.004366812227074
6373617,4,B00JKTCC8K,"Two schools and two different teams of girls fighting against each other.  One school wants something that the other school has.  Has plenty of panty shots, but no nudity and no blood shots that are normally seen in this type of action/comedy DVD's.  Even though this collection is rated as MA I think it could be rated a little lower since there is nothing as, could be said, as nasty.  I always rate DVD's as 4 stars since there is parts that make no sense to me, but still entertaining.  For the die hard fans they would probably rate it as a 5.",1428105600,,548,4.281553398058253

6373621,3,B00JKTCC8K,"Overall, an enjoyable experience that is drawn and animated well. However, without the accompanying OVA, it feels incomplete and much of the characterization is left to the imagination- an aspect more thoroughly explored in the games and manga series. It's best served as an accompaniment to both rather than regarded as a standalone product, which falls short of being able to recommend it very highly to anyone except existing fans or those looking for an entry point into the series, but since the games are either as expensive or cheaper, it may be a better option to invest in those.",1416960000,2,588,4.89

8651931,5,B00JKTCC8K,"- Synopsis: An anime showcasing the adventures of cute and sexy ninja girls as they train to become stronger in the harsh world of the shinobi. Each of the girls fight for their own reasons as they pursue the strict teachings of ninjutsu. Life is fairly routine, until another rival group of ninjas teach them their difference in skills by dominating them in combat. After a painful defeat, the girls have a stronger determination to defeat their opponents by enduring more strict training regimens.
===========================================================================================================

- Comments: This anime is better suited to gamers that are fans of the series, rather than the casual anime viewer. It emphasizes the Hanzo Academy girls' struggle to become stronger, so that they may one day meet their individual goals. This anime, much like the games, is full of fan-service and mainly includes sexy and cute ninja girls engaging in brutal combat.

- Features: English and Japanese audio with English subtitles. Includes 12 episodes on 2 Blu-rays, and 12 on 2 DVDs with a run-time 5 hours. Rated TV-MA for violence, and loads of fan-service.

- Conclusion: I'm a simple man: I see waifus; I buy. And there are plenty of them in this anime. Again, this anime is probably better intended for fans of the game, rather than your average viewer. It's a light-hearted anime with a simplistic plot. Not to mention they are from the creators of Ikki Tousen and Freezing.
===========================================================================================================

- Recommendations: Ikki Tousen, Queen's Blade, Maken-Ki, Ben-To, Tokyo ESP, K, Freezing, Cross Ange, Kampfer, and Lord Marksman and Vanadis.",1482710400,5,1740,5.680769230769231

8651934,5,B00JKTCC8K,"I have been a huge fan of Senran Kagura and have all of the games along with some memorabilia.  This cartoon series is great and has a nice blend of comedy (in my opinion a comedy similar to prankster adolescent boys than mature adult) and lessons such as friendship as well as believing in yourself.  I did notice some change in the dialogue from Japanese to English as some of the original sayings were altered leaving a little loss in translation but in the end the change was still effective.  I wished the season was longer but I did greatly enjoy this collection and I am anticipating vol 2!  Yagyu is my favorite and the series does do a good job shining light on all 10 girls so if you do have a particular favorite, she will have balanced screen time with the others.  If you are a fan of humor with combinations of fighting and subtle life lessons, than this is for you.
