7973334,5,B00006VYOY,"This tape is fantastic. Ana Forrest combines a good workout, stretch, and spirituality in one video. I have always had problems with my neck and hips; her video has improved both of these areas. After this video, expect to feel refreshed and happy! The session isn't too long, and she gives great reminders and instruction for the poses. I can't say enough good things about it :-)!I can't wait to try her ""the pleasure of stretch"" next...
P.S.- Another great relaxing (not really a workout but fantastic none the less) yoga video is by Mimi Solaire called ""Deep Stretch""",1282608000,,571,4.777777777777778
7973335,1,B00006VYOY,"I purchased Ana Forrest Strength & Spirit based on the Amazon.com reviews and its 5 star rating.  I have done yoga for many years.  In my opinion, this is not a class for beginners or anyone with injuries.  I urge people to view a yoga tape or dvd before purchasing it.  Many yoga tapes and dvds are available from public libraries.  I recommend Susan Winter Ward's Yoga for the Young at Heart as a very good 45 minute yoga class for the beginner or senior wanting to stay flexible.",1112832000,6,482,4.370786516853933
7973336,5,B00006VYOY,"Strength and Spirit is a wonderfully unique yoga video which provides the kind of detailed instruction that you'd find in an actual live yoga class.  Led by Ana Forrest, it features a class of six students of all ages and abilities; Ana alternates between displaying the movements with amazing grace and flexibility and moving amongst her students offering form guidelines and corrections.  At the start of the class, she encourages the students to identify an area of focus in their bodies, and throughout the practice, she places a strong emphasize on breathing, reminding students to breathe into their focus areas in particular.

The practice starts in a seated position with uddiyana, the abdominal lock; Ana follows this with a seated forward bend and twist.  Then it's on to hands and knees for dophin prelude and dolphin to open up the shoulders.  Back in a seated position, you will do a side bend with a neck release and then lie flat on the mat for abs work.  This is the most challenging segment of the practice, as Ana has you move very slowly while taking looong, deep breaths, first doing a bicycle movement and then pelvic raises with a second mat rolled up between your legs (I use my Pilates circle for this move).

The second half of the practice centers around standing poses interspersed with gentle backbending movements.  The first standing series includes down dog, warrior 1, easy twisting warrior, lunge, and lunge twist (similar to prayer twist, but with a change in arms position).  The floor work which follows is an easy half boat pose, and then it's back to down dog.  The next standing series consists of a lunge with forearms to the floor, first with the back knee down and then lifting the knee; you then return to the floor for full boat.  Coming back into down dog, you move into warrior 2 for some particularly nice shoulder work, first combining a shoulder roll/pinch with breathing and then opening the shoulders further using eagle arms.  The final back work is cobra pose performed twice.

After a last down dog, you move into pyramid and then pigeon with a forward bend.  Following this, you return to a seated position for one final neck stretch before going back to the floor for savasana.  Although the relaxation portion lasts only about 3 minutes, Ana encourages you to remain in savasana for as much time as you have; without an extended savasana, the entire practice clocks in at just under 55 minutes.  I've found that every time I do this video, I learn new things from Ana, as she provides an amazing amount of detail.  The pace of the whole practice is quite leisurely, yet the time goes by surprisingly quickly, and I am always left feeling relaxed and refreshed.  I would recommend this video to all levels of yoga practitioners, although those brand new to yoga will probably want to learn the poses elsewhere.  Overall, this is a very enjoyable practice with a skilled and competent instructor.",1107561600,13,2951,4.785009861932939
7973337,5,B00006VYOY,"A one hour long workout (I wish more people would include the duration of the workout in their reviews especially when there is no buying info!) which leaves you feeling refreshed, strengthened and stretched out.  For power yoga lovers - this is not a power yoga class.  For those who don't like sun salutations - none!  AF is a great teacher, her style is different to the other yoga videos i have (many!) - her constant reminders to relax the neck and shoulders were timely, and at the end of the class my neck was the  most relaxed it's been in ages, and I could rotate it more than I have been able to for a long time.  The class takes place in a room, with the participants in a circle - not crowded, and very well lit.  They are at various levels, and AF's corrections to them are very useful.  Modfications are suggested for various levels, so this tape could be used by many levels (eg plank to chatturanga - low push up - striaght legged or bent knees).  The class moves along at a brisk pace, but the postures are held for a good amount of time unlike some videos where you move out before having time to get really established and into the feel of the pose.  She also includes some tough core work - abs and back.  Relaxation at the end is good too.  AF really stresses the importance of the breathe, paramount to yoga, and has one breathing into the ribs to open them out.  She also emphasises finding your trouble spot and breathing into it - without being too woo-woo.
I recommend highly.",1042243200,43,1502,4.344086021505376
