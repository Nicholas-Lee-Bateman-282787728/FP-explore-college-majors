8432662,4,B004KAA2E0,"The still photographs of Aimee Addison were good. The video that was taken at the same time that the still photographs were taken varied in exposure quality, with the photographer getting in the way at times, and when the flash lighting was used when the still photographs were being taken was annoying. The time of the DVD, including both the still photographs and the video, was much less than 2 hours claimed on the DVD jacket cover (about 1hour and 10 minutes). Selecting which chapter to go to was confusing as to which which chapter was actually was being selected. The DVD didn't stop at the end of the DVD, but started replaying the DVD again.",1299283200,2,651,4.620689655172414
