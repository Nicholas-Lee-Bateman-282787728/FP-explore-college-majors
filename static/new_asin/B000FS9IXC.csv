8126202,3,B000FS9IXC,"Fairly good movie .. my Dvd was good quality i got it from Raaga Mega store which apparently is really Vista India digital media store. It arrived fast and colors are pretty but it is old fashioned and in letterbox form so if you have a big tv great, not too bad on 32.

Plot...warning some pain ahead..sigh...and not all of the good dramatic kind.. Double sigh...

DISCLAIMER FOR YOUR STOMACH CONTENTS : OK I GIVE THE RUNNING STORY LINE A 4, I DEDUCT ANOTHER STAR FOR THE WEIRD BUT HAPPY ENDING...I GIVE THE RUNNING HUMOR A MINUS -50 BENEATH SEA LEVEL....The movie content is just fine, but the running humor gag through the movie is VERY dated by content. The cinematography is great on my blueray wifi , you have to grit your teeth through the first 25 minutes and try not to judge so  harshly that you turn it off. Here's your Fast Forwarding guide lol.

 THIS IS A 90's HINDI FILM. Complete with really pathetic front load humor which i usually like but this ones a running gag that's just NOT funny even to five year olds. The music video is pretty much from that time period people are settling into their seats crunching on popcorn making noise yada yada lets get this show on the road filler . Anil Kapoor manages to pull it off for the identification of the kind of character he's playing. Do yourself a huge favor and unless you are just hooked on badly done MTV videos with Indian views on USA politics of that time period... FAST FORWARD TILL YOU GET TO THE MOVIE SECTION AGAIN..there you have been warned. ANY TIME two men are on the phone talking to one another FOR THE LOVE OF BOLLYWOOD FAST FORWARD  . It's a running gag about owing each other money. It's on again right now and I tell you it's positively painful to watch. Don't know why they do that but shakespeare put many a fool in his works too. When watching Bollywood 90's films FAST FORWARD PRN AS NEEDED. Why did I keep watching.. it has a good emotional tug too it and Kajol rises to the top of the heap. Watch it for her sake and I actually think Anil Kapoor did a fine job playing a non sympathetic character for the first half of the movie and set up for his big change for the second half. That is actually very hard to do. Oh yeah, he kicks butt on the cartoon villains as needed later on . There is one very bloody gore scene with his injuries at the very end you will have to be the judge for the kids.

28 MIN INTO IT YOU GET THE PLOT THREAD GOING AGAIN....
 ..... Brave smart girl taking care of her family as best she can and having overwhelming problems that she is trying to handle one at a time. Her boss's son Anil kapoors role is playing the aging playboy who needs to settle down and take over dad's business and marry a nice girl. He insist he doesn't believe in marriage..typical playboy nonsense. So dad pressures him into it . He agrees but with a contract of one year . He will officially marry her but if she's not great enough in his eyes he can set her aside . Being raised in the west he's conflicted in his views. He believes women are equal but he thinks it should be all on his side to say goodbye for whatever reason. Well our heroine tells him what he can do with that idea. Meanwhile back at her house the dramas have taken a turn for the worse and she is in desperate need of money for operations and pregnant siblings ( and being saved from her family). She now has to swallow her pride and go through with something she just said no to in a pretty good speech that now she has to recant ...don't you hate that...dang.

Beautiful wedding, cute honeymoon , settling into marriage on her part not so on his.  He's selfish, callous, unfeeling and only cares for his own opinions. He can't give a complement to save his life. Very much the self serving playboy . His father is a complete opposite, sweet and wonderful to her and tries to make her feel the cherished daughter. After her husband sufferes a severe spinal injury, Kajol helps Anil to recover from the trauma and after months nursing him back from the brink of death and paralysis , he decides she's too much the nurse that he doesn't feel sparks for her....AGGGHHH ..Revenge of the double edged sword is just around the corner. There are a couple of mild cartoon villains of the old style, limited in their screen time, scattered throughout here and there for the typical ruffian behavior. More of the silly phone convo's with two guys fast forwarding again. (Johnny lever present FF, only listen to the phone guys in the last 20 min.) Here we go . More real movie . Her husband is now eating crow big time and begging her to come back to him while she gives him hell , she's pregnant..that wasn't in the contract whoops. Annoying papa song that could of been fun but is just annoying Fast forward till it's over. More of her being pigheaded and holding a grudge (yes women can hold a grudge till the end of the universe if we feel vindicated )..Vengance driven public moment...those hormones were working overtime. Now it's his turn to speak, little reality check for her in a mess of her own making this time.. a plot to get her to say she loves him again, a murder attempt on him... Okay I still like it. The totally over the top ending was PURE MASALA MOVIE STYLE, which is why I watch and if you don't like that why on earth are you reading a review for a 90's Hindi film....Here come's the part where they are beating him up..is that a cardboard tube...hmm could be..enjoy it, it's still an old fashioned entertainer. Don't wear out your ff button ..there are more of them out there. You'll be needing it.",1339372800,2,5581,4.332057416267943
