8188257,5,B000P219E4,This is my favorite Firm workout.  I like that its a fast paced workout and the cues are good. I also like the 45 minute compressed timeframe.,1383868800,,142,4.2592592592592595
8188258,1,B000P219E4,"I like Nancy Tucker, but I was sorely disappointed with this workout. I couldn't get my heart rate up, and I hardly broke a sweat. If you are use to do doing the other Firm workouts or lifting weights at the gym, then this video probably won't do much for you either. The cardio is just a way too slow and the sculpting bar offers far too little resistance.",1291420800,,357,4.188405797101449
8188259,5,B000P219E4,"This is a great cardio video It uses the sculpting stick But if you don't have it the sculpting stick pro or even a 8lb or 10lb bodybar will work great. Nancy Tucker is an excelllent instructor. This workout is fast-paced you will sweat but, its fun. The sculpting stick comes apart at the ends.  They call these parts ""twigs"" If you don't have the stick you can use 3lb or 5lb dumbells when it is time to use the twigs  I highly recommend this video. Good fat burner.",1252454400,,468,4.247191011235955
