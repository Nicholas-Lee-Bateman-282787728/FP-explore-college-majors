There were so many twists and turns and unexpected events that it kept us guessing until the very end! I was very impressed with the set and it was very good music but not too much! I am going to be purchasing a few more copies for my friends. This playwright is definitely on her way to stardom!",1293580800,2,396,4.438356164383562

4252373,5,B0042UEY88,"This stage play is one of the best I have seen in a long time. If you want suspense, drama and laughs. Then this is the DVD for you. The cast was phenomenal and the writing and directing are spot on. The twist & turn in this play will keep you on the edge of your seat. From the title to the content this really was worth the money. I can't wait to purchase future DVD productions from Vanessa Lynn.",1293148800,18,399,4.0

4252377,4,B0042UEY88,I liked the storyline but the special effects were truly unrealistic.,1408579200,,69,5.363636363636363
4252378,4,B0042UEY88,"I liked the movie, It was worth watching, so true, something to think about when you are trying to find that special someone",1388620800,,124,4.434782608695652
4252379,3,B0042UEY88,"It's been some time since I watched this and I don't recall all of the specifics.

The message is great, I just think it could have been delivered better.  Maybe I'll watch it again so I can give a better review of this play.",1372896000,,225,4.090909090909091
4252380,5,B0042UEY88,I enjoyed this play. And I was surprised at the ending. I am a hopeless romantic & it is awesome how God can put people in your life that will completely turn it around. He has a plan for everybody. I loved it!!!,1367539200,,212,3.953488372093023
4252381,3,B0042UEY88,"This good of been a good movie, but I really didn't like it. It really make women look bad, but this actually happens in real life. I still don't like it",1365811200,,153,3.967741935483871
4252382,1,B0042UEY88,$134.00?  Are you kidding me! $134.00 for an old play on DVD?  If you don't want to sell it then don't list it!,1361750400,,111,3.782608695652174
4252383,5,B0042UEY88,"Order placed on 12/30/2012 Order received on 1/12/2013 and I paid $26.80 for this play and all along, I was thinking, I never pay this much for plays or movies, But let me tell you this play is worth the price and worth the wait! You will not be disappointed. I waited for a long time for this play to become available again. So get yours soon.

This play was very good and unbelievable, meaning there was so much reality in this play that this play will have you not knowing which way things will turn out. So many twist and turns.. New faces, scripture, God all through this play!

Love first lady, and grandmother (mother Laster) was so real! We need the elders! What happen to the people that would step in when a marriage or soul was in trouble... You don't see much of this now days.

You will be on the edge of your seat because there are so many unexpected things in this play.. Many many elements of surprise through out this play! You will also laugh as well as be inspired.

I would love the sound track from this play as well.

Just because you have unequally yoked relationships does not mean things can not be saved. This is a great lesson on unequally yoked relationships. And just because relationships look dead, does not mean you can not speak life to the dry bones!

DVD came sealed and was not broken. Quality of the screen was good.

This play shows strongholds, deliverance, mindsets, and the tricks of the enemy and how he plays with your mind.

Don't let the bad reviews fool you. This play does not have as many modern settings like the current plays we see. However when you go back and look at the old plays they still have a blessed message and this play has a message that will bless you. Seek the message and don't let the enemy trick you into not watching this play.

This play was on point and to the point. This is a much needed play in our current times of the status of marriages in all cultures, but especially in the African American culture.. you can and will learn a whole lot from this play, don't judge a play by its cover or stage settings.

Each relationship in this play goes through challenges that are reality. This shows the solutions to those issues as well. The characters are great and do an excellent job. I want to see more plays like this on the same subject matter with the solutions because this is needed to save the marriages and relationships of today.. Too many give up and too many stand for nothing.

The play is so deep and needs to be seen by couples who are thinking about marriage and ones who are married. This has great music.

We are already watching this for a second time and will continue to watch this over and over again. This is clean truth that family and friends can watch together.. Start a save marriage and relationships campaign in your community.

We all change, but we should not let those changes tear our marriages apart. Remember as the play shows prayer still works!

Please make more plays like this.. They are needed. This should be required for all couples before and after marriage..., We invest in everything in this world, but where is our faith, and why don't we invest in marriage and our relationships? We believe in everything this world shows us, but do not believe in marriage or healthy relationships.

Keep praying for all marriages and relationships to be restored to better than what they were.. The divorce rate in the African American community is too high. Lets change this.. we can do it if we try and stand for something..

Buy one for yourself and buy more as gifts! From a married mother of more than four children.. stay prayed up, the enemy is always on his job, look at the attack on marriages and relationships at the start of 2013 and end of 2012.

Thanks for making this play available! Thank you Abba for this play and your word. To God be the Glory!",1357948800,,3866,4.422535211267606

4252386,5,B0042UEY88,"Well regardless of my DVD coming in a broken case that smell like it was in  a fire!  But this PLAY!  WOW it is sooooooooooooo good!  Vanessa truly shows you what being unequally yoked will do to a relationship!. Trina and Melvin... I love this couple so much in this play...I mean they had some rough times together.  But the way they reacted to one another and how they stuck by each other was very sweet!. Vanessa had so many twist and turns in this play that it will having you saying!  WHATTTTTTTTTTTTTTTT!.  This play is based on WRONG RELATIONSHIPS and how they can mess you up emotionally!....  When God put that scripture in the Bible!  Don't be unequally yolked with unbeleivers that is EXACTLY WHAT HE MEANT!  It can cause so many isssues!  Especially if you are a Christian and dating a UNBELEIVER!. Hmm it is funny about that unequally yolk stuff because you can ne MARRIED and be Unequally yolked!  SO YES I RECOMENDED THIS PLAY IT HAS ALOT OF SUPSENSE, LOVE, ROMANCE AND IT IS A MUST SEEEEEEEEEEE TO GOD BE THE GLORY!  VANESSA YOU ARE TRULY HIGHLY ANNOINTED I FELT THE SPIRIT OF GOD COMING THROUGH THE TV AT ME!",1335398400,,1126,4.46078431372549
4252387,5,B0042UEY88,"Unequally Yoked is a wonderful play with a timely message. So many men and women will be able to relate to the story. The storyline was good and it had a twist at the end that you will not be able to predict. Vanessa Lynn is an awesome writer and one of the most sought out Female Playwrights in the game. You will love this play and ""Affairs"", which is an inspirational murder mystery. Vanessa Lynn has changed the game of Urban Theater.",1334102400,,438,4.289156626506024
4252388,5,B0042UEY88,"I was completely amazed by the many directions this play took.  It gave me a chance to get to know the characters, to feel for their situations.  The storyline was intriguing and totally unpredictable.  As a writer, I look for stories that keep me guessing and this storyline created so many twist and turns, that it was impossible for me to know what was going to happen next.  This writer has exquisitely weaved together characters and situations, that in the end left me absolutely speechless.  Some of the best play writing I have ever encountered, more like a movie.  Originality, this is what we need more of, not the same old cookie cutter examples.  A must see!!!",1334102400,,671,4.683760683760684
4252389,3,B0042UEY88,"I enjoyed the message that the play presented, but I thought that it had a poor made quality. It was just something to watch with a lot of humor.",1333065600,,145,4.0344827586206895
4252390,3,B0042UEY88,"Great story line. It dramatizes how women being overly trusting - having no self esteem, can be taken in by men who have hidden agendas. The naivete, schemes and deception are all too present in today's realm. That is the message.

My favorite scene in this play was when the grandmother and first lady were praying with and for the young man for his deliverance and breakthrough of his stronghold.

Otherwise, I was not at all impressed with the theatrics, wardrobe, casting, etc. Not a play I would recommend highly. However, I would be interested to see more works by this writer/producer/director, Vanessa Lynn.",1327708800,,615,4.903846153846154
4252391,1,B0042UEY88,"I was fooled by the reviews I read, which led me to believe that this was a half way decent movie....it was not.  This was one of the worst plays I ever barely watched.  It was boring and poorly made.",1327104000,3,200,3.975
4252392,4,B0042UEY88,I was surprised.... I was fooled... I loved one scene with the main character but if i tell it to you then it will give it away... Nice actors and I had a great time!!!,1327017600,,168,3.8285714285714287
4252393,5,B0042UEY88,very good play id recommened it to all my friends.it mayed me laugh and cry iam very glad i purchased it.,1323907200,,105,4.0476190476190474
8413984,4,B0042UEY88,"The play was insightful and well done. No spoilers, but there was a plot twist that was somewhat unrealistic and out of left field- I guarantee you will not see it coming-, however that is often the theme in theater. I enjoyed the music and the acting and would definitely recommend it. It is a little too long for my taster, but it is not slow, the time will fly by. I had some dinner and watched and it was a very fun night in with some clean media. I pray that God continues to use the writers, actors, and staff.",1521936000,,516,4.118811881188119
8413985,5,B0042UEY88,"Watched it with a friend. Now I'm about to purchase it. I absolutely LOVE this movie! It is fabulous, inspiring, strikingly intriguing! One that I will watch over and over again. Worth the price and more.",1516233600,,204,4.694444444444445
8413986,4,B0042UEY88,"So I was going to stop after the first few minutes because I realized it was a play.  Then, I decided to stick it out.  Truly glad that I did.  This is actually a well thought out play.  It had twists that you would not expect and it seemed that it would be predictable but it is not.  Watch for yourself.  A review is not something that I do but I wanted to do this one to tell people to give it a chance.  Please do not pay attention to the low reviews.  Then again, please do not pay attention to my review either.  The only thing I ask is to watch it for yourself in its entirety then decide if it was good or bad.  I did not give it five stars because as in everything, there is room for improvement.",1516233600,2,705,3.9014084507042255
8413987,4,B0042UEY88,It was a really cute play I loved the plot twist..It held my attention throughout the movie.,1513987200,,92,4.470588235294118
8413988,4,B0042UEY88,"Great encouragement, sound and had a nice, unexpected twist! Thanks for this great Christian production :)",1507852800,,106,5.6875
8413989,5,B0042UEY88,"My original thought was, since it's free I will watch another far off any town's Broadway play with a predictable religious theme. I must say I was pleasantly surprised! The play was well written, well acted and has an incredibly vocally gifted cast. Worth watching as. a testimony to God's power to move in ways we can't predict.",1506124800,,330,4.706896551724138
8413990,1,B0042UEY88,"I give them a ""C"" for effort but on a day when you have nothing to do...You still don't want to watch this.  I lasted a good 10 minutes in before I turned it off.  I guess I was expecting a ""movie"" because nowhere in the description does it say it's a play.  They tried but failed miserably.",1505520000,,291,3.9827586206896552
