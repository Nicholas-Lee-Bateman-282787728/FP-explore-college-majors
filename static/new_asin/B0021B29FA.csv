8348886,5,B0021B29FA,I love this kind of drama story. I'm also a big fan of Kazuya Kamenashi. This works out perfectly for me.,1374364800,,105,4.0476190476190474

The real reason I liked it was because of the story itself, which was more about relationships than anything else. It also takes wine tasting to a whole new level.  I enjoyed watching it and if you enjoy asian shows then this one is definately watchable...",1291593600,,371,4.3478260869565215
