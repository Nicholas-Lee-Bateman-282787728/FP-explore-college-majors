I agree that nutrition is imperrative for healing however not all of us (in fact most of us) do not have supportive people in our lives.  I am glad for her that she has enough land to grow her own vegetables and enough money to purchase grass fed meads etc but not all of us sick people have that luxury.  I have had MS for almost 20 years and am holding my own with no drugs a good diet ( can't always eat as organic as I want) but do as much as my cheap husband will allow.

I bough one of her other DVD's a while back and planned on getting them all.  The DVD's are more like CD's with Dr. Wahl's lecturing a group of students.  That is why I only gave 2 stars.  The information is OK but if you are on a tight limited budget save your money.  Join her website for free.",1361145600,,879,3.9488636363636362
