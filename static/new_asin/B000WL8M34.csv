Bishop Sheen has always been able to put into simple words things that might be difficult to understand when it comes to faith.  I highly recommend this set because it's as relevant today as it was then.",1452124800,5,244,4.304347826086956

8223598,5,B000WL8M34,"I bought this DVD as a gift for a family member but ended up borrowing and I am glad I did. Bishop Sheen was an exceptional speaker who possessed a vast knowledge on the true Catholic faith. Bishop Sheen continues to inspire a love of Jesus, Mary and Joseph through DVDs such as this one. Interestingly, in a couple of the segments, Bishop Sheen warns of problems beginning within the Church due to priests and bishops focusing on social justice issues, instead of divine matters. If you are seeking knowledge of true Roman Catholic teachings, get this DVD!",1361577600,9,557,4.6938775510204085
