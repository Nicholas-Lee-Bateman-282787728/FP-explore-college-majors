7929417,5,B000051S5O,"American audiences in general are not as familiar with animation that is OTHER than Saturday morning Warner brothers, or other kiddie directed style.

And while it's possible that the films in this collection are below par for great world animation - they are still mindblowingly beautiful works.

Especially Door, and Big Underground Ball.

The imagination and effort that goes into these brilliant stop motion doll, and claymation works is inspiring and delightful.

And a long artistic way from the few celebrated claymation features that get rolled out every year for the past 45 years and are the staple of American diet on holidays.

This series 1-4, along with Jan Svankmayer's works, should be part of any fan of visual arts collection.",1168992000,5,744,5.115702479338843
7929418,3,B000051S5O,"The Amazon review above pretty much sums up this collection. As a whole, the animation itself, of which there is a good mix of styles, is well done, but I was underwhelmed by the content/subject matter. Nothing bad here, yet, sadly, nothing particularly good either.",1145664000,2,266,4.933333333333334
