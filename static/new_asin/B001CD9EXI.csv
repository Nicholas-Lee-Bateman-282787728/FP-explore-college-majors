8286849,5,B001CD9EXI,"I've been a fan of these guys since they did the Anime intro for Hitman Reborn.  Once I bought this DVD, it just made me more of a fan.  I didn't find any problems with the DVD.  But its hard to notice when your bouncing your head to all their catchy songs.  Definitely pick it up if your a fan of LM.C",1236816000,,302,3.8225806451612905
8286850,4,B001CD9EXI,LM.C are great and really fun to bounce around to. The only problem I have with the DVD is that most of the songs are out of sync. Some by just a fraction of a second and some by a lot more. That's something that just annoys the crap out of me. But because I love their colorful videos and catchy songs (and they're so darn cute) I can look past the flaw and give this DVD a 4/5.,1222473600,3,379,3.810126582278481
