2772315,4,B000NO1ZBG,Very good information in this DVD. Read the book and you'll see the big picture.,1266537600,2,80,4.4
2772316,4,B000NO1ZBG,Watched it and I have to say I was not expecting a lecture.........bonus! Ver informative and not repetitive as the food word generally gets. Great insights. The video is a little old that is why a four star.,1266192000,6,208,4.5
2772317,3,B000NO1ZBG,"I thought there was a lot of interesting information given in this video.  What I think could be a turn off for many people is that sensible heathy eating is linked to some kind of spirituality.  I am a very spiritual person, but not the way portrayed in the video.  I have been vegetarian for more than 20 years now, for my health, not because I have reached some new spiritual plane.  I have been 95% Raw for over a year. Romans chapter 14 in the Bible talk about not using whether you eat meat or not as a sign of spirituality, in fact it states that the person who eats vegetables is weak in their faith, if they are doing so as an expression of their spirituality.  My husband has always been very suportive of me and doesn't eat meat in the house, but does eat when we are out.  That is his choice, he is a very spiritual man and works hard to be a loving spiritual husband. As I mentioned, there was some fine information, but by putting this spiritual twist to it, I see it turning people off to the idea of eating Raw.  You have to sort through this other ""stuff"" to get to the ""meat"" of the information.",1260230400,24,1113,4.172897196261682
2772318,4,B000NO1ZBG,"This had very interesting reading, but some of the recipes were labor
intensive and needed equipment that was sort of expensive.
One recipe I tried did not come out quite as I had planned, but will
try it again, modifying it a tad.  I guess I just need to get the hang
of what is going on and plan ahead of time, the recipes I would
be using during the week.",1252713600,5,358,4.042253521126761
2772319,5,B000NO1ZBG,"""This is Dr. Cousens at his most inspiring.
I couldn't believe the pictures of
""live blood cell analysis""!  I have now learned so much about how bad sugar is for my body!
I want to help my body to help itself more than ever.

 This DVD also gave me  over 1 hour of healthy raw food recipes
that are totally easy to make and proved to be so delicious that even my 'carnivorous' boyfriend
asks me to make enough for him, too!",1226188800,30,423,4.121951219512195
2772320,5,B000NO1ZBG,"""I give this one 5 stars  because it not only changed
my life, it changed my boyfriend also. Dr. Cousens has
wonderful information on how and why to eat healthier
and live longer! We also enjoyed watching the one-
hour food show of great easy recipes. I finally
learned how to open a fresh coconut - Thanks!""",1217462400,14,308,4.4035087719298245
2772321,5,B000NO1ZBG,"I thought the raw food recipes were really well done. I made a few of them and they were totally yummy! Also, I learned so much from the lecture. The live blood cell analysis showed what unhealthy blood looks like when you eat toxic food.",1215043200,26,238,4.311111111111111
2772322,5,B000NO1ZBG,I am so excited when when anything new by by Gabriel Cousens becomes available. He is simply the formost expert on anything live food! This 2 hour DVD exceeded my expectations with over 1 complete hour of terrific raw recipes. His recipes are always simple and easy to follow. It was like watching Food Channel!!!!,1214956800,30,314,4.7272727272727275
8179409,5,B000NO1ZBG,Dr. Cousens is the raw food Guru. I trust him above all others. Colubia Medical school graduate and raw food diet & research for over 20 years. Founder of Tree of Life Center. The proof is in the...raw food! Healed my Goant Urticharea and all other health issues & pain in body!,1455840000,,278,4.365384615384615

8179413,4,B000NO1ZBG,"I enjoyed the lecture very much in that Dr. Cousens gave very good information, showing microscope slides to demonstrate what he was talking about.  I am a spiritual person, but not anywhere near or interested in the same type of spiritual practices as are depicted in this video,  but for me it was very easy to look beyond that and garner the message that was for me in the lecture portion.  However,  when it comes to the cooking portion of this video,  there really needed to be a lot more of it within this video.  If I felt like the amount of cooking recipes in this video equaled what I feel should have been there for this price.  It was the info contained in the lecture that brought the score to 4 stars.",1416009600,2,714,4.323308270676692
8179414,5,B000NO1ZBG,Gabriel's work is always outstanding and helpful to living a better quality life.,1407542400,,81,5.3076923076923075
8179415,4,B000NO1ZBG,"I have been a insulin dependent diabetic since childhood (a long time ago). This is would have been great in reducing my long term deterioration. I already had reduced my meat consumption and almost eliminated most manufactured foods from my diet. From rigorous testing measurements I made myself, I found that natural foods, no matter how much sugar they contain, spike my sugar levels less than manufactured foods (baked, fried, or roasted). This reinforces my own testing and this DVD provides incentive and recipes for further enhancements. The diabetic guidelines are wrong. Use this instead. I still partially cook my potatoes but eat less of them. White bread is the worst offender I am better off eating a tablespoon of sugar. Refined starch is terrible for me.",1383264000,,769,5.062992125984252
8179416,5,B000NO1ZBG,"Gabriel Cousens is a genius.  I will be buying more of his stuff in the future.
Compelling arguments for live raw food.  Recipes are demonstrated.",1382745600,,146,4.8
8179417,4,B000NO1ZBG,"He found fungus in the blood of patients that were not on his diet as seen through a Darkfield and Phase Contrast Microscope.  To investigate this, I bought AmScope 40X-2000X Trinocular Compound Darkfield Microscope and AmScope Phase Contrast Kit for Compound Microscopes (super discounted).  He photographed protits on the outside of cells.  I ordered Protein Misfolding, Aggregation and Conformational Diseases to investigate the protits theory. He mentioned microrganisms in his patients blood when eating stored foods.  New ones have been discovered in corn at 40,000X, see DVD  B0096DP4CG Genetic Roulette: The Gamble of Our Lives. I ordered The Fungus Link by Doug A. Kauffmann and Cancer Cause and Cure: How Mycotoxins Cause Cancer and Lower Cholesterol to investigate how the fungi byproducts affect the various systems of the body.  He mentioned that similiar effects can be attributed to heavy metals and processed foods.  I ordered  How Toxic Are You? The Solution For Body Pollution for more details.  Some people attempt to replace whole food with supplements.  This debate is addressed in Supplements Exposed: The Truth They Don't Want You to Know About Vitamins, Minerals, and Their Effects on Your Health.  He realizes that each persons metabolism works differently.  For advanced readers, this is addressed in Metabolic Imbalances, pH and Ayurveda.  The companion book for this video is ""Rainbow Green Live-Food Cuisine"".",1372291200,5,1438,5.452488687782806
8179418,5,B000NO1ZBG,If you don't know who Gabriel is - or if you don't know what Tree of Life is - then this is probably not going to be the best Raw Life type of video for you.  If you are a big fan - this is a great compliment to your raw library.,1288224000,,229,3.4038461538461537
