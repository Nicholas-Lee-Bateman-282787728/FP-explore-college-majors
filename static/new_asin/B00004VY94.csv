Of course I realized from the beginning that it's PAL, but I planned to try it on the computer, and with VLC it comes over loud and clear.  I wonder if there were originally sub titles?  It's OK if not, and they weren't advertised as such.  But I thought it's possible they're on some other track on the DVD, and I might be able to see them.  Does anyone know anything about this?  Thanks for the great quality, and Molly, thank YOU for your charming underclothes.  :)",1411171200,,562,4.4411764705882355
