7305344,2,B0106RTAPM,"The second season, unlike the first, was unremittingly morose and dull.  The characters were ridiculously grim (non-stop grim at that).  They were simply not believable. It was a struggle to get through it.

I am a big fan of noir but this second season was a failed attempt to ape that genre. Hopefully the third will get back on track.",1439337600,7,337,4.583333333333333

7305346,4,B0106RTAPM,"I liked this season of True Detective. The first episode was the best but they kind of dropped the ball for the other episodes. The story became too superficial. The only thing I would say is this was a very complex story with more main characters than the first season and each character had a very different part to play than the others unlike season 1 where they were both involved in the same case and were both cops. The character development for season 1 was very in-depth unlike season 2 where the characters had different jobs and different parts to play. Season 2 would have been better had it been able to play out over 2 or 3 seasons. There were too many questions left unanswered. Why did the motorcycle cop have all those scars, what was the rest of the story for Rachel's character, what happened to her dad, her sister. What happened between the motor cycle cop and his mother? The episode with the big gun fight was a giant waste. Did the director run out of how to tell the story? DId the writer have writers block and used that scene as filler? This season just felt too complex to write into 8 episodes and this brilliant writer seemed to run out of gas. I wanted to learn more about the bullying in episode 1. I could go on and on but having said all that I still liked the story. It just felt rushed and characters seemed overlooked.",1439251200,6,1354,4.355731225296442
7305347,5,B0106RTAPM,"SPOILER ALERT - Details from plot included
Liked Season 1; loved Season 2.  I read all (most) of the critics of Season 2 and some made valid points but taken as a whole I liked Season 2 more than 1.  And I loved the ending - Jordan and Ani with Ray's baby and Nails walking thru the festival crowds to who-knows-where was beautiful, haunting and hopeful.  And the symbolism of the Madonna and child held aloft was a nice touch.  (Season 2 went a long way to address the juvenile degraded, stereotyped women of Season 1.) Ok and yes it was night but the hats in the last scene framed Jordan and Ani's faces to very fine effect.  I thought the actors all were terrific -  Frank was a sympathetic bad guy - Ray so troubled and appealing - and Paul - well, there was troubled and searching.  I don't like action in TV or movies action so over done and it  generally bores me - tedious and generally meaningless - but the two shoot-out shoot-em-up scenes in Season 2 were the greatest I have ever seen.  The three 'detectives' standing in front of the bus after the shoot-out that kills Dixon and everybody else practically left me breathless - and speechless.  I almost left the room and missed it cause I thought okay here comes a meaningless action/shoot em up - but wow! that shoot out was  masterful, brilliant and full of meaning.  I know that it will be used in film classes as the measure of excellence for shoot outs.  In an environment of over-worked over-used gun battles how could some one do something seemingly so ordinary and yet so new and so original and so compelling for the viewer?  It told us so much about our characters and what they were caught-up in and the forces aligning against them and we felt it as we watched them standing there looking stunned.  They were stunned and we were stunned!  The three of them standing there as they had stood together in the first episode but now deep in - way deep in.  Great TV!  And the second shoot-out at the cabin - Ray and Frank - was cathartic - special forces - take 'em all down and given Frank and Ray's deaths later - viewer at least left with the 'justice' of the compensation of the shoot-out at the cabin.  Some justice at least for Frank and Ray.  Robert Morse was great!  Rick Springfield was great!  Paul's mom whom some critics lauded greatly was a little too cringe-producing for me  Season 2 would have been fine for me without that character.  I read that many didn't like the singer and her songs  but the least favorite life  line stuck with me.  She is a find and I will be first in line for Lera Lynn songs.  I could go on and on  the singer walking out with her guitar at the end, the Leonard Cohen openings   what is good is dense  what is good takes a lot of articulating, unpacking, 'deconstructing' as we used to say  so much done so well!  Because of the self-absorbed and self-aggrandizing (and maybe lacking in literary sophistication) critics, Season 2 will probably take time to get the credit/acclaim it deserves, but I know and can easily see how the acclaim will come.  Can't wait til it is out for streaming and on DVD.",1439251200,3,3115,4.395796847635727
7305348,5,B0106RTAPM,"Like with some masterpieces in film history, many were panned by critics upon release. Not so much because of their lack of quality, but because of the public's unwillingness to grasp the material. Sometimes when we fail to understand something, we tend to dismiss it.

You can file True Detective Season 2 under those great works that were unfairly criticized by lack of understanding. I have found that a large majority of people spewing negative reviews about Season 2, not having an understanding of film noir. Noir, by definition, is a character study within the confines of dreaded atmosphere. The plot is not necessarily in the forefront of the story; it is merely a backdrop for the characters that occupy it.

This season had a heavy dose of noir qualities borrowed heavily from novelists Raymond Chandler & James Ellroy. To further emphasize the homages, cinematically, I saw a lot of David Lynch & Michael Mann to some extent as well. Even with these nods to past great works, Nic Pizzalatto's vision that we came to love in Season 1 still remains.

Try not to be persuaded by the critics or the sheep that blindly follow them. Try watching with an open mind and just know that this is a stand alone season, that sought out to not repeat itself, but to keep the True Detective brand alive and refreshing. I think it's a monumental achievement and a destined classic that will be revisited by many in years to come. It is a beautiful companion piece to its predecessor. I look forward to the next chapter in Pizzalatto's anthology story.",1439164800,7,1547,4.743494423791821
7305349,5,B0106RTAPM,"I rarely write reviews, but felt I needed to for True Detective season 2 to defend it. I'm honestly puzzled at much of the criticism and think its just as good as season 1.

Cons. The main characters die the most senseless deaths Ive ever seen since a horror movie. Like one guy has to desperately upload a file that will exonerate him and his colleagues. What does this dummy do? He drives to the forest where theirs zero reception! There he meets his fate. The other main character, a gangster gets blocked by a car ahead of him while on his way to freedom. What does he do? He waits patiently until he gets semi surrounded. Semi? Well this idiot can still drive around them. He gets kidnapped to a desert where he barfing his life for the million dollars he has hidden in a suit case. They let him go, then he picks a fight with a Mexican gangsta, gets stabbed and bleeds out. This show went from acceptable to wtf in the worst possible way. I only paid $8 for this which I honestly don't think it was worth the 8 or so hours I lost on my life. Avoid this at all cost.",1517961600,,991,4.161458333333333

Rich characters (Vince Vaughn has never been better) and a complex and interesting narrative.  I just don't try to compare it to uniqueness of the first season.

7305380,4,B0106RTAPM,"Four RELENTLESS Stars. Season 1 of the True Detective anthology was a gruesome case in Louisiana starring Woody Harrelson and Matthew McConaughey as the 2 main detectives. Season 2 has a raw, uncompromising, multi-layered plot in California with completely new cast members. It centers around 4 main detectives working a puzzling case. But there is a new second perspective from the criminal point of view, for good measure. And while not 'the darling' of either critics, the network, or some of the fans, nonetheless Pizzolatto creates a very interesting, complex plot that challenges the viewer to pay attention, featuring an excellent cast that was laying it all on the line throughout the show. In the plot, a missing person sparks a relentless search that sets off tensions in many locations and the search is on by a very conflicted detective quartet with different interests in solving it. I found it mesmerizing, drawing the viewer deeper into the mystery just like the detectives who refuse to stop chasing the shadowy criminals.

The first few episodes of this season deliberately build deep characterizations of the conflicted main protagonists and that takes up a lot of valuable time while it lays out the mysteries leading up to the awesome, explosive 4th episode that I watched a number of times, especially the end. From episode 5 to the end, there are many surprises and all of the loose ends are tied up, albeit unconvincingly. Starring Colin Farrell, Rachel McAdams, Vince Vaughn, Taylor Kitsch, Kelly Reilly, David Morse, and many more, but the compelling McAdams steals the show, over and over. Music by T Bone Burnett. Created by Nic Pizzolatto. Violence, Nudity, and Language. Very Definitely Recommended as a binge-worthy series. Four DETERMINED Stars. (HBO Entertainment. Rated TV-MA. Color. HD. CC.

The casting is terrible, which makes most of the actors unbelievable in their roles, especially Vince Vuaghen and Rachel McAdams, pretty painful to watch their dialogue. The story is also set in socal (seriously Hollywood, your town sucks, stop being lazy), which gives it a very lazy, cheap and unoriginal feel.

This season may suffer a little bit from the bar being set exceptionally high by Season 1 and the outstanding performance of Matthew McConaughey, but I found the plot to be weak and the acting mediocre for the most part, and sub-par at times.  I had high hopes coming in with the big names involved, but was pretty sorely disappointed.

To start, I'm not sure what was going on in Vince Vaugh's life at the time, but many scenes he seemed to be phoning it in.  The ""spice"" in the relationship between him and his love interest in the film is far from believable.  Their scenes together are wooden and full of bad acting, sometimes on his part and almost always on her part.  His dialogue is poorly written as well, with many of his spoken sentences containing verbs and such but no subject--they are sentences starting in mid-sentence. This trend became progressively annoying to me as the series went on because it was obvious the script was written this way and it betrays writing that intends to be realistic but just comes off as dumb.

Another annoying aspect about this season was Colin Farrell's attempted portrayal of a gritty, gravelly detective. His affect is to try to growl his lines sometimes, maybe in an attempt to make his character sound badass, but it is so obviously an affect that it's not effective. :^)  It was hard to care about the characters and the whole thing was too contrived by half.  Hopefully the next season will be better with new blood in the mix.",1499817600,2,1575,4.576512455516014
7305411,4,B0106RTAPM,"It's not season 1 and with that being said, it took some episodes for me to re-adjust to this being a new story in a new location. After I was thoroughly entwined into the story line, I was hoping that there was some type of hope in the end - as in season 1. It left me wondering what happened to the bad guys in the end? If they were ever brought to justice or did it stay the same? I was happy to find the results from the paternity but that was the only conclusion that this season brought. Colin Farrell, Vince Vaughn, Rachel McAdams, Kelly Reilly, and Taylor Kitsch all told very authentic stories in the characters each portrayed. I didn't like that at times they were referring to locations and names that I wasn't familiar with. I had to keep going back over past episodes to see what did I miss - which was nothing. I feel if those few things could've been addressed they would've received a 5 star rating instead.",1499212800,,923,4.28

Maybe people found the story too complicated? It's really not , but you have to pay attention. I find all the actors give credible performances and enjoyed this season as much as the first. My only criticism , and this goes for both seasons , is the build up , and the bad guys prove to be a lot less interesting at the end.

Vv seemed amateurish addressing the crowd regarding the rail project.  Things improved with the complexity of his relationship with Ray.  The action was good and many of the character's issues were at times compelling.  Making Ray a substance abuser seemed like a cheap way to give him texture.  That's been done so many times it's not that interesting.  Did I say the action was good?  L.A. vs L.A.--Louisiana is obviously more interesting.  Background plot was pretty good. They made it complex to increase the intrigue.  Killing Ray but making him a father twice over was cool.  Too bad they had to live in Venezuela.,1491091200,,740,4.983606557377049

The actors are good, and well cast for their roles, but the story is weak and the characters are not exactly believable.  I suppose that it should win an award for worst music, but that's the only award it deserves.

  The atonal songs by the lounge singer detract from the scenes that the songs overplay.  This singer, whoever she is, needs to do covers of someone else's material since her own is so terrible.  Closing themes are very bad covers of familiar songs done by absolutely talentless performers.

The script here is above average but nothing special. The acting is definitely one of the best things here, especially from Colin Farrell and Rachel McAdams. Vaughn was pretty good as well, albeit out of his comfort zone. True Detective's cinematography is a hallmark and the music is excellent. The show has a dark eeriness to it. I bought it on Blu-Ray and it is a beautiful show, as far as the visual presentation. I waited for a price drop because I could not imagine paying $30 for it.

There are commentaries on two episodes (#4 and the final one, #8), and the subtitles are good (in terms of making choices of how to shorten a line when many lines come quickly on top of one another).

As for the show itself, I love it nearly if not just as much as season 1 (and perhaps even a shade more, if only because I grew up in SoCal and spent much time in the periphery of LA County shown and implied by season 2, and could therefore directly connect to the atmosphere and tone of season 2); that said, and just to be clear, I love season 1 and consider it a modern masterpiece. I'm just saying season 2 didn't deserve most of the negative vitriol it received, and I highly recommend it to anyone who likes neo-noir, detective stories, or Shakespearean-style tragedy in a modern idiom.

I won't go into detail beyond that, as this isn't IMDB. But if you like dark stories, dynamic characters, and delicious neo-noir, you should watch this. Cheers.",1487980800,2,1243,4.569506726457399

7305453,4,B0106RTAPM,"It's quite possible that I'm the only person who preferred season 2 to season 1 and who didn't find season 2 to be confusing or clunky. Season 1 was all about layers. Layer after layer of feelings and people and things to discover and figure out which I found mildly pretentious. Season 2 wasn't so much about layers but about linear parts. One event occurring tangentially to another but each event impacting the whole. Each episode had a revelation and a new question that needed handling and in the end tied everything up in a nice, neat bow for the viewers. This wasn't about viewers being given a story meant to take them on their own existential, soul searching mission. It was just a good story with solid acting and finding out who survived it all in the end.

I may have felt differently had I watched season 1 prior to watching season 2, but I didn't. I watched season 2 after hearing how terrible it was and how it didn't compare to season 1. I started watching season 2 expecting to be let down and disappointed, but I wasn't. The characters felt real. I felt Velcoro's angst and sense of failure. I felt Semyon's constant need to prove himself and be more. He's supposed to be the self-made, streetwise successful businessman and yet he was being used and scammed by almost every single person around him. It was a hard pill to swallow and so viewers understood why he made the mistake of seeking revenge instead of listening to the sage, practical advice of his wife.

Velcoro called it early on that the three cops were handpicked to fail. Once that little grenade landed, all we had to do was sit back and wait for it to explode. Perhaps the ending was a bit too Hollywood-y, in that we knew that the bad guys were going to get their comeuppance, and all the loose threads were neatly tied up for us. But after 8 episodes of backstabbing and tightrope walking, hero after hero being knocked off, I for one was fine with a little Hollywood vindication in the end.

In season 2 we have slim, 5'4"" Rachel McAdams as gritty and tough police officer. She takes the leads on no-knock warrant home raids, bursting through the door and the first to examine room after room with the snout of her pistol.

We have tough, real-man Colin Farrell as a downward spiraling alcoholic cop who holds his police walkie talkie upside down to speak into.. the palm of his hand covering the antenna to achieve the worst reception and the best capture of the micro-wave energy into his body.

7305504,5,B0106RTAPM,"From the reviews I have read here on Amazon, many seem to think Season 2 of True Detective would have a story line tying it to Season 1.  If that were my expectation, I might have been disappointed, but everything (and I mean everything) I read about Season 2 as it was being made indicated it would have nothing to do with Season 1, other than being created by the same man, Nic Pizzolatto.  So, I viewed this as a ""stand alone"" production, and thoroughly enjoyed it.  This is a story of broken people finding the courage to live with their own set of very challenging principles, and I always find that makes for interesting viewing.  The plot is complicated and demands your attention.  Every episode peels back another layer of the onion.  The shootout in Episode 4 rivals any street action scene since the bank robbery in ""Heat.""  Vince Vaughn is simply outstanding among a cast performing at their very best.  Taylor Kitsch, as you have never seen him before, will break your heart.  Rachel McAdams thoroughly convinces you she is badass.  Colin Farrell achieves savage intimacy as a tortured man in the process of losing his only child.  And, Kelly Reilly gives balance to the four principle roles with both tenderness and strength.  The supporting cast is equally impressive.  I have watched the entire season twice, and I enjoyed the second viewing more than the first.  I have seen Season 1, and like many others, thought it was great.  That said, it was a totally different show from Season 2.

What some folks are calling a complicated plot, translates into being aimless, disjointed, disconnected and pointless. There are too many story lines going on at once with nothing that ties them together. You have 4 main characters, and 4 different story lines, with nothing terribly interesting or cohesive about any of it to keep your interest, or to motivate you to return again. Unlike season one, where there was a strong and interesting story line that hooked the viewer right in and as that played out, the complexity of the two main characters personalities and personal lives unfold against the backdrop of that story line. Season two has nothing to engage the viewer or entice them to watch it through, and the main characters personalities and personal lives are either bland or a train wreck - but not in an interesting way. I kept waiting for some plot line or point to this episode... but nada, zip, zilch!

It starts with a entirely different plot and entirely different characters. But one thing is common, the superb thrill. The story revolves round the small town of vinci. Three cops from 3 different departments(state,county and city) come together to solve the murder of Ben Caspere, the city administrator.

The casting is brilliant, and with more brilliant acting all the characters become real. The divorced father longing for his son who is staying with the mother, the ex military cop dismissed unfairly from military,  the detective with a disturbing past and the ex gangster trying to turn his life in a different direction all these characters became so real with the superb acting.

As the series moves on the story start turning from one side to other and the tension starts building on. It revolves round the corridors of power and corruption and how the individual characters choose to take different paths in their life and how that affects their entire life is worth watching. I would say it is more a drama than a mystery thriller. Can't give any less than 5 stars.",1465516800,,1199,4.839024390243902

7305530,5,B0106RTAPM,"I enjoyed both seasons of Nic Pizzolattos epic True Detective. Comparing season 1 and season 2 is unfair because it is like comparing apples and oranges. The characters and the plot are totally different and seem darker (even the screen is darker). It involves less nudity compare to its first season. Talented and versatile Colin Farrell, who is one of the most underrated actors of our time, was brilliant as Ray Velcoro who is a short-tempered, burnt-out dirty cop but also very protective father figure. His character in this series is like a well-tailored suit that perfectly fits him. I think he is at his best in projects like this in which he can show his emotions rather than his muscles and he makes you think about the character. I haven't seen Vincent Vaughns prior work. As I understand from others comments, his work mostly involves comedy. He didn't seem out of place or over his head as Frank Semyon. He and Colin Farrell have a good on-screen chemistry. I hope we can see them together in future projects. Rachel McAdams was surprisingly good in her role. I feel like her character somehow incomplete though; her character looked ineffective and fell flat towards the end despite the weight she carried in the initial episodes.

very difficult to follow.  I purchased Season 2 mainly because it took place in Los Angeles and environs.  I enjoy movies with local color.

7305586,5,B0106RTAPM,"After reading about this season's True Detective and all the vitriol concerning it, I was pleasantly surprised at how good it actually was. I think people simply could not NOT compare it with the first season's story, which was brilliant. I, luckily, live in Japan, and escaped the daily mantras weighted against this season's story. Well, it is a completely different story with completely different characters. Did you want True Detective Season One, Part II? I just watched it episode by episode, and put the first season out of my mind. I had no expectations, and that certainly helped me to connect with this story. The four main characters this season are deeply flawed people, as usual. And I think the reason people did not, or would not, connect with Paul, Ani, Ray and Frank, is because they seemed to follow the Brando/Dean school of acting: being present in the moment, being inarticulate and, especially, mumbling a lot. These four characters, unlike the two great characters in season one, did not have seventeen years of hindsight to allow them perspective and distance to explain to the audience who they were back in 1995. Season One had a lot of narration to it, which helped the audience navigate through the murky and often scary waters of Louisiana. This season had no such hindsight, and the four characters, themselves, were clueless about their own lives, personal limitations and their violent tendencies. So, we have Ray and Frank mumbling at each other at a bar, and Ani mumbling her way, far away, from any man who got close to her, and Paul mumbling or screaming in pain at his own sexual inclinations. I watched it as a process, as the characters lived it, slowly learning about themselves, and eventually showing some deep understanding about what they had become. I thought it was true and very believable. Many people wrote that it was boring. I guess they have become inured to recognizing the true reality of daily life, which is just a lot of long, boring moments that we try to get through along the way toward some important goal or event in our lives. I think it is hard for many people, these days, to free their minds from the expectation that every film or TV show must resolve all the conflicts it has introduced. Everyone just seems to want Tom Cruise in Mission Impossible, repeated over and over again, jumping through every conceivable hoop without so much as a scratch, where all the bad guys always get caught or killed in the end. Iron Man, The Avengers, Spider Man, you name it: there MUST be action after action, automatic reaction to attack and then the ultimate destruction of the enemy. No moments are allowed to flow unhindered or uncontrolled. No character has any self-doubt for long, because he or she must respond instantly to an attack from somewhere and slay the opposing force. Our way of looking at movies has radically been altered since the 1970's. Now, we follow film after film, reboot after reboot, the usual animated characters, who are as flat as the paper they were drawn on, re-hashed year after year, endlessly. Who, these days, has the time or patience to endure Frank or Ray's mumbled and broken phrases at a low-down bar, or Ani's sullen and unattractive reaction to every man she looks at? It takes attention and patience to allow the characters to come to life, and not want to be constantly pushed over a cliff of adrenaline-boosting climaxes. So, I can understand the initial, under-thrilled reaction to True Detective, Season Two. But, if you like movies from the 1970's, then this is the season for you! If you loved Three Days of the Condor, or Marathon Man, or Network, then you will understand the anxious and dark world that these characters have come from. In those films, forty years past, the powers that be were taking everything over, and those characters were struggling to fight back. They, too, were lost, broken people, who were not leaping onto airplanes or off cliffs at the last possible second, impervious to injury or death. They were just like Frank, Ray, Ani and Paul in True Detective. They, too, were inarticulate and flawed and made crucial mistakes, and it took a lot of moments of screen time for those characters, as well,  to resolve their internal conflicts. And, like many of those great film of the '70's, three of the four main characters in this story died. That is tragic, and people these days don't like such hopelessness. That is why Star Wars rescued, or suffocated, the dreary world of Taxi Driver and The Deer Hunter for good, and replaced it with a world of Buck Rogers and an eternally shallow, optimism in the face of all logic: welcome to the '80's and Ronald Reagan. So, next time you watch True Detective, Season Two, keep this in mind. It was a great story, and it was just as powerful as Season One. But, yes, it was different, and it did not rescue all the characters at the end, and, sometimes, evil does win. That is hard to accept for some. It hits too close to home. It is too real and people are not always as shiny, eloquent or handsome as the two guys in Season One were, or as Tom always appears to be in the Mission Impossibles. I think that this rather slow, depressing story-line lost a lot of the audience right off, because nothing was being explained to them, like Season One did from the start. It forced you to just listen and watch and follow the bluesy, sad characters yourself, with no middle man to direct you toward the light at the end of the tunnel. The tunnel was long and dark, and that is too much to take in this current world of cartoon characters, all flying at the speed of sound. But you should feel lucky that someone is still writing powerful stories like the ones in True Detective Season One and Two, and that the writer risked everyone's wrath, simply by not sticking to the new rules for film making, which are: keep the audience entertained at all costs, don't give them even a moment's rest, don't make them have to do any of the work, make sure they want to come back and pay for the movie again, and do NOT ever be a downer! If that is what you are expecting from films, then don't watch True Detective!",1455321600,17,6175,4.628988149498633

7305596,5,B0106RTAPM,"True Detective Season 2 is film noir at its finest.  ""Out of the Past"" and ""Double Indemnity"" have nothing on this series.  Like film noir (and, for that matter, ""Game of Thrones"") things can end badly; characters may be doomed by the path they start to follow, in this case, trying to unravel the corruption of Vinci and the State's politicians.  Prior to television, film noir and dark movies were popular with audiences.  Our current audiences may be so used to the story line of good-guys-vs-bad-guys-good-guys-win that they can't accept deviations in plot.  Also Season 2 has more characters and more plot points than Season 1.  As such, an audience might lose some plot and character points between weeks.  I watched the season on DVD.  As such, I was able to pause the play when my wife asked about something she hadn't followed, (and we could go back to view prior scenes).

Also of note, the shootout in episdode 4 of Season 2 will do John Woo and Sam Peckinpah proud.  What a great segment!

7305616,5,B0106RTAPM,"The following review will contain a lot of SPOILERS, which will also include PERSONAL OBSERVATIONS, CRITICISM, and POSITIVE FEEDBACK.

True Detective season nr. 2 (2015) starting Colin Farrell, Vince Vaughn, and Rachel McAdams is an urban mystery-thriller drama that contains strong character development, great acting, intertwined story-lines, many characters, anti-heroes, protagonists with damaged personalities, etc.

This 8 episode--season 2-- urban crime story is as good as the previous season, which many claim to be the best so far.  What I like most about season 2--- is the main characters and their dark past experiences, or their damaged personalities (just like in season 1).  Each of them has that Dirty Harry in them.

The season's 2 main underlying themes are: corrupt establishment, collusion, anti-social behavior, self-destructiveness, and the concept of American dream mixed with urban tales.

The series is about a group of individual police officers who hold different ranks in different parts of Lost Angles county who are designated by their superiors to work together on a murder case of a high profile personality in the California State.  The three individuals are: a burn-out detective with a troubled past, and  a alcohol/drug problem, who is fighting for a custody of his son (Colin Farrell); a feminist, with a love for knives, and tomboy-like female cop who holds person vendetta against men do to her dark childhood secret (Rachel McAdams), and a young self-loathing, army veteran, motorcycle-officer with a personal secret of his own (Taylor Kitch).  All three have one thing in common: they are all individuals with troubled past who have a death wish.  To this mix, comes another character played exceptionally well by Vince Vaughn.  I have this image of Vaughn as a comedian, because I most saw him in romantic comedies...I never knew that he a talent for playing dark characters.  His character in TD 2 can only be described as something along the lines of Michael Corleone from the Godfather.
He is an ambitious, intelligent, temperamental gangster turn legit business owner.  Whose business dealings with the murdered high profile persona gets intertwined with the trio's investigation.

I want to thank the filmmakers for putting in an un-Hollywood ending to the terrific finale of season 2...namely by making the two main male characters die at the end.  It makes the story more grim and realistic. I honestly expected the characters of Vaughn and Farrell to turn on each other in the last episode.  Too bad the filmmakers did not show the death of the innocent man or ""alleged rapist"" and the diamond heist murders in the form of flashbacks.  Also, it would have been better to see flashbacks form 1970's of the meeting between the ""spiritual"" minds rather than seeing an old photo. I think that season 2 had a lot of potential to be even better than season 1, but it did not elaborate enough on certain story-lines and it left many loose ends.  The filmmakers condensed too much intertwined story lines into an 8 episode series.  Season 2 could have easily been a 10 episode series with additional footage that would have only made the entire story visually and artistically better.

If you liked season 2 of True Detective I HIGHLY RECOMMEND seeing Red Riding (3-part British TV series composed of: 1974, 1980, 1983).",1453161600,6,3363,5.102189781021898

7305633,4,B0106RTAPM,"I'm in the minority: I disliked season one, but thought the second season was better. Season one was a whodunit sprawled out over eight episodes. I lost interest in season one when Detective Cohle single-handedly takes down a biker gang. Cohle's diatribes were pretentiousness nonsense (save for his mentioning of negative capability); ironically, critics say that the second season has long overwrought dialogue.

  The biggest problems in the second season are the coincidences that the characters have in relation to the storyline -- it saves explanation along with layering new storylines. In this way, although it seems tawdry it evades the flaws of the Sopranos where many potential storylines were planted, but long forgotten by the end of the series; life itself can seem that way:as though something is being built , but doesn't go past the foundation.

 The pros of the second season is the initial layering of the three basic storylines the continuously intertwine; allowing little to no filter. There is also much more showing instead of telling. The first season was one big garble of telling. To be fair this second season does have those moments where the characters do the audience a favor by bringing them up to pace with what is going on. Despite this, though, it tells an interesting tale of corruption that reaches the highest levels of Vinci politics/law enforcement.

Why is it getting such a bad rap?

Ultimately, it's strongest points outweigh the weaker ones. The acting is fine, though, panned by critics. If I were to take a guess for the flack i would say a few things:

1) it's not so cut and dry like the ending of season one.
2)Instead of a 'crazy man' the 'crazies' in the second season are high-profile white-collar types that have relations with gangsters; mercenary types called ""Black Mountain"" obviously in reference to ""Black Water"".
3) Jews, in particular, israeli jews are not shown in a good light. Apparently, if they are not shown as victims critics tend to rebel.

Final Points:

The writer is obviously a fan of 90s film/television where it seemed like every movie had a gangster element to it. There were times toward the last couple of episodes that I felt like I was watching ""Heat"" or something from those 90s gangster films. Much like Sopranos the last episode keeps you on edge since there is an expectancy that main characters are going to get killed. This is also because the audience has been accustomed to to seeing this. Another element from 90s writing is this very American idea that with great with fortune comes tragedy; if you're of a lower-class. If you're a born blue-blood you can pretty much get away with anything wonderfully illustrated in the film ""American Pyscho"".",1451606400,6,2734,4.911062906724512

7305646,4,B0106RTAPM,"I had a hard time figuring out what star rating to give here.  First off, I did watch the first season that of course has nothing to do with this one.  I loved it.  A story format will differ with each season so I was hesitant to be too judgmental, or get my hopes up for the 2nd.  From the outset, people criticized it quite a bit, and from what this reviewer can see, it was largely in part because they were holding it up to the light next to the first one.

The second has from what I experienced, a lot more moving parts.  It has more sub plots, if you will, as well as intricate issues that go deep within our three main characters on the law enforcement side.  Unlike the first season, this True Detective starts at the beginning and branches out in a fairly large spider web of storyline and character arcs that then slowly draws back in towards the end.  The final episode then bunches this up in a fist with a few surprises, keeping some of the ideals of fatherhood, revenge and accountability.  It doesn't do it very softly, but at some points where there can be surprises, there are also some things that are a bit predictable.

Overall, the writing here isn't bad at all.  This is something I could watch again and probably come away with a slightly better overall opinion.  It is dark, and where the first one was a period piece of sorts when they would flash back to the not so distant 1995, this one tries to capture a fractured yet long standing Los Angeles scene.  I thought the overhead shots of the freeways, although not original, helped give the viewer a broader perspective of an area that is loosely connected to the sum of it's parts, as are the players involved in the story.

I liked Vince Vaughn's character a lot, for the fact he's done so many roles that are not like this.  I felt he did a good job portraying his character's plight, and like the character arcs of the others involved, it was a slow build up to some detrimental actions and consequences in the end.  If you liked the writing, characters and overall cinematic visage of the first one, give Season 2 a chance.  It deserves it.  It's not for everyone, but from a ""True Crime"" standpoint in story telling, we've needed something different for a while now, and I personally like the direction they are going with these.",1449532800,,2312,4.4

The biggest problem with season 2 can be summed up with one word; boring. I made the rookie mistake of buying the entire season and thereby felt obligated to get my money's worth. That's time I'll never get back. Time spent listening listening to Vince Vaughn pontificate about who the hell knows what. Tony Soprano he ain't. Time spent watching Colin Ferrell get grungier and less comprehensible by the moment. Time spent watching Rachel McAdams look sexier as a burnt out, alcoholic cop than as the usual glam princess she usually plays in Rom Coms. OK...the Rachal McAdams part was worth it, but it didn't nearly save the series.

Vince Vaughn, ""Cool! I get to play a gangster and not the comic bozo I'm always saddled with!"" Oh wait.
Colin Farrel: ""Alright! I get to play a scuzzy cop who never bathes! Except for the accent, I don't even have to get into character!"" Hic.
Rachel McAdams: What?!""  I'll need Blue Jeans and some t-shirts. I've seen people with those. Ka-ching!

The good: *The cinematography and music. The aerial shots of L.A. freeways came across as living, breathing arteries connecting the disparate sections of SoCal. That's about tit.

The bad: *The writing. I can't blame the actors. I like them all and they probably came in thinking, ""Oh man! This is sweet! This series is the hottest thing going!"" Ooops.
* The talking. The endless talking.

I won't go into painful detail about the plot--illegal land deals, blackmail, torture, murder, blah, blah, blah. Suffice to say there are gangsters and every ilk; Mexican, Russian, American. Take your pick, They're all cardboard cut-outs and not at all interesting. The cops and politicians are all corrupt. Is there anyone you can have a root for? Maybe Colin Farrel's ex wife and abused son. Sorry...that's the way it is.

Finally...these folk always have a tumbler of scotch in one hand and a cig in the other. I know that it was intended to color these people as hard cases, but really, half in the bag? All the time? I felt hungover after every episode and I don't drink.

Why would the writers choose such a weary trope-infested plot?  Moreover, with all the so-called inane riddles/ they injected, they only succeeded in confusing the audience.  One word.  CRAP.  The first season succeeded in creating a story full of mystery that captured an audience that is immune to every horrible taboo in society and until the writers can find a way to cross this line again, this show is doomed.

Rachel McAdams was also very good.  I thought Taylor Kitsch's performance was the most notable.  But all the actors were stifled by the story and the lack of substantive character development.

The second season.... jumped the shark. I feel like after the success of the first season, they decided the best course of action would be to double the action! double the darkness! double the main characters (literally went from 2 to 4)! twice as much of what the fans loved will make this twice as good! they could not have been more wrong.

The characters were a parody of DARK AND BROODING. which became our mantra to recite every time the main story arc failed to progress and focused on how  DARK AND BROODING the 4 main characters were. the show was too crowded.

SPOILER TAG HERE. DO NOT READ ON IF FOR SOME REASON YOU ARE GOING TO WATCH THIS SEASON.
the show actually boast of a spectacular shoot out scene in which, and I am not making this up.
1. 6 cops walk down the middle of the street, in broad daylight, with only hand guns, to a 'no knock warrant' at a known drug den that they expect to be heavily armed.
2. after 20 minutes of shots being fired, a crowd of civilians, WHO ARE PROTESTING THE LACK OF PUBLIC BUSES, sit there and do nothing while being mowed down by bad guys, and then, no joke, a PUBLIC BUS FULL OF PROTESTERS SHOWS UP to also get mowed down.
3. then to show what a bad ass the one girl is, she brings a knife to a gun fight..... but then doesn't use it.

and demographic.
And with that said the script and a wonderful set of actors did establish the atmosphere
And place differences very well.
Season 2 as season 1 creat a very unique micro detective/crime  environment exist in parallel to other places going day
To day with 925 regular life setups.
It may turn that one don't like this reality or specific personage in the story (quite understandable ) but
From point of acting my personal feel from episod 1 to the final episod is that all acting stars did remarkable
Performance,with all the actual personal issues that each one carry on his back,according to the story line.
If the purpose of this season was to give as a look on day to day detective/crime life in different America place and time
Then the season hit the nail on the head big time for me.
No Starsky & Hatch,it was never meant to be the same.
I can see how some don't like this grimmer eniverment setups of season 2 and it may turn like so that some don't like
The same in season 1 tough it's had some funny moments.
I find both very equal interesting and satisfying,not enother Magnum episod ( though I loved that one as well) but an intresting
Story an un familiar places and approach to the way detective actual lives running and
Involving in story that is showing some quite disturbing and hallucinational low scum freaks end there shifts.
All in all I can't wait for buying the Blu Ray set
and I'm very much look forward to season 3
with new story new actors different America (time and place)

7305726,4,B0106RTAPM,"If Season 1 didn't really beat the fact into your skull, Season 2 will: Nic Pizzolato loves James Ellroy. Deciding to do a modern-day adaptation of Ellroy's L.A. Confidential was a gutsy decision, especially since he changed up the names and put the super-dense plot of the novel into a blender with a small amount of Chinatown and The Wire. No, we didn't really need another L.A. Confidential of any species after the brilliant, Oscar-winning mid-nineties adaptation... but I don't give a damn. This season came close to its celebrated predecessor in terms of smart, satisfying entertainment, but even if it were the best thing ever committed to film, you'd still hear someone whining about it.

To make it clear, my references to a contemporary adaptation of L.A. Confidential were made in jest, but carried a gentle but valid criticism; maybe Pizzolato was unaware of it while writing, but he comes dangerously close to owing Ellroy royalties and a story credit. There's more than enough fresh inspiration and brilliance to forgive his literary love affairs, however, and enjoy the mystery as it unfolds.

As cinematic art it falls short of the first block of episodes, but not all that far. Vince Vaughn, Colin Farrell, Rachel McAdams and Taylor Kitsch all deliver great performances, but none of them have the skull-rattling intensity Matt brought to Rust Cohle. In some ways, the writing and pacing are better in Season 2, but most will likely disagree with me there. Believe it or not, True Detective's first storyline was not particularly revolutionary... it was about cops with personal demons chasing down a serial killer. It 'just' did everything very, very well. This season doesn't have the originality of the first, and there's some questionable, predictable and illogical moments as the writer sends his messed-up cops careening towards their shot at redemption and a bad end -- perhaps in more ways then one.

Still, if these episodes had been sent through a wormhole, dropped on the door-step of HBO circa 2003... this would be unanimously hailed as brilliant.",1443052800,,2077,5.049562682215743
7305727,5,B0106RTAPM,"Having not seen season 1, I didn't come at season 2 with any preconceived notions clouding my judgment of True Detective.

You know those cops shows where you get a mismatched pair of detectives, one the yin to the others yang, which creates an effective dynamic duo, also providing humor because they are the odd couple? This is not that. Here you get 3 mismatched detectives, but they all bring baggage and there is precious little room for comic relief in this story. Each member of the trio goes their own way and they meet up occasionally to exchange information; slowly they begin to realize that outside of their circle of 3, almost nobody can be trusted. Better than most detective productions, this season in detail relates the how and why of bonding and crime in a way that something like&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Shield/dp/B00DJYJRHG/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Shield</a>&nbsp;never did. There's a steady sense of desperation that becomes quite pronounced in the second half of the season, and the ending is satisfying on a number of levels.

The dialogue is sharp, almost unrealistically so in the case of Vince Vaughn (who talks like that?) The cinematography between scenes of dialogue is icing between layers of cake: dark, gritty shots that suggest the rise and fall of empire in California, matching the story. More than any other series in the summer of 2015, I could hardly wait for each episode.",1442016000,,1473,5.263829787234043

No... Actually, most of us do. We're just not drinking the Kool-Aid.

So, if it's not obvious by the critique length and score, there will be spoilers herein.

Look, I LOVED the first season and was staunchly against those that wanted a repeat. I admired Nic for taking the series in a new direction with an entirely new premise, characters, etcetera. Even after the shoddily directed and edited first episode, I hung on tight and defended the show as ""just finding its footing"". The second episode and Colin's ""Death"" threw me for a welcome loop and I dug where this twisted tale was going... And then... Things began to take a dive... And quickly at that.

During episode 3, the show took a new means at ""developing"" its narrative by loosely connecting characters and scenes just so the story could get to the desired beat the director wanted to showcase. This was grossly apparent in the episode which ended in the bloody shoot-out. The entire build-up for that hour was so flimsy and haphazardly stapled together with unexplained conveniences that it's as if someone else just started writing it for Nic (when actually, Nic was given free reign by the studio).

And because the ""Stan-thing"" was so pathetically applied solely as a means for Vince to monologue about fatherhood, deep themes and what not, I won't even address the narrative issues with how Nic just tossed him in there.

The final episode hinted at redemption (for its characters and the entire season itself), but not only failed as a ""climax"", but negated the entire season. So, I DUG the whole ""Bird Head"" storyline and why he was killing crooked cops with his sister--I thought that was quite a bit of fun. However, two things destroyed this ""reveal"" for me. For one, this disclosure had NO business stretching out this long. It was so simple a mystery that all of the red-herrings in hindsight don't come off as a fun guessing game, but instead, as if Nic really didn't know how to hide the main conflict unless he tried to distract viewers with a dozen worthless side-stories that ultimately go nowhere--just like the central dilemma as well.

Two: the divulging of Bird Head... OKAY. So, you're telling me that this guy has been planning revenge for years... He's been methodical... Gradually planning out this orchestration of murder and vengeance that was SO confounding that practically the entirety of CA was caught up in trying to silence it... OKAY... So you're telling me this guy that has spent the better part of his life planning violent retribution... JUST FLIPS OUT AFTER FINALLY BEING INTRODUCED AND IMMEDIATELY DIES? So... You're telling me... A character that has been one step ahead of everyone (again, dug that shotgun scene with Colin), has been controlled, calm and collected for YEARS, just now decides to throw a tantrum because a guy was badmouthing his parents and sister?! No. That's not how that works. He's had YEARS of dealing with that very same thing and he NEVER DID THAT, so why now? OH, THAT'S RIGHT. Because it serves the story. What would have been amazing is if he was utilized beyond a pathetic plot-point to simply progress an already weak story toward its equally rushed denouement. His character had so much potential and Nic squandered him with a character-contradicting outburst. If this had been what his character did when he got flustered, then NONE OF THIS STORY would have ever happened. He would've mucked up his first kill and gotten slain or caught while doing it. Again, this is the guy that knew how to get close without detection; knew how to act, speak and even acquire jobs that would put him close to the mark without being suspicious. And then that happened. To make matters worse, visually, he was nothing more than some Audioslave-lookin' pipsqueak that carried no menace.

Since such a potentially awesome character was thrown out the window midway into the finale, I sighed and thought that the remainder might still maintain a high pedigree. I was wrong. Now, I know a lot of people liked the ending. I didn't. For me, it negated the entire season and proved that it wasn't just the switching of directors (was it three this time around?), but Nic's messy writing that botched it.

And no, I don't need a sappy, everything's bright and cheery ending, but True Detective 2 didn't earn the depressing sadness it was trying to force down viewer's throats--not one bit. It was as if it was trying to yell, ""ISN'T THAT SO SAD?! Everything this character tried to accomplish doesn't matter! He never knew he was the father, never knew he knocked the girl up, his son doesn't even get his message and he dies alone and afraid! Isn't that so depressing!?"" And this goes for several characters and their incomplete arcs. It didn't earn the right to wallow in its own bleakness, nor did it feel natural. It all felt forced and conveniently applied so as to gain pity from the audience who will just deem it brave and moving because it had the unentitled audacity to kill off key players. Again, even Colin's death didn't make sense with what he previously did. He took out two-to-three (can't remember which) of the mercenaries and then tosses that very same tactic that WORKED (because again, his character is a survivor; a fighter) and jumps out from cover without even firing. Really? After all this, really? Yeah, he had a dream where his pop tells him he's gonna die like this. So okay, foreshadow it, at least have the character die in a way that's consistent with his character and what's happened before this moment. Or, what would have been better is to not have him die right there. Tricking the audience into believing his story ended there would have been far more compelling than simply meeting expectation head on.

It's as if Nic forgot about what he wrote and kept rewriting characters and scenes without referencing what he had already applied to paper.

I could go on, but critiquing the show's many missteps would take a thesis (from a narrative and technical standpoint). I truly believe that had Nic not butted heads with Cary and such a fantastic director had remained, this season would have been wonderful, gritty and poetic.

I'm still looking forward to a season three, but don't hate on people because they proved a god can bleed.",1441065600,4,6504,4.797321428571428
7305731,4,B0106RTAPM,"This is a very hard series to grade but Amazon makes me do so. Thus, I am giving it 4 stars but a good argument can be made for knocking it down to 3.5 stars. This series was hotly debated over on the New York Times Arts Beat section which does episode recaps + forum for select tv series. I love this feature at the NYT. It is rare to see the readers there as divided as they were over this series. Almost all of us had seen Season 1 which seems to be true for Amazon Reviewers as well.

There are some fantastic plusses to this series. Number 1 is Colin Farrell. He is an outstanding actor and manages to improve just about every video work extant. The character he plays is not very sympathetic which makes it all the harder to play. He has so many ""loser"" qualities stamped on him yet I did come to care for him and wanted to see his story play out. I can see why Elizabeth Taylor picked Farrell to be the actor to perform at her funeral service out of all the actors she knew. He performed a poem of her own selection at it. They had rehearsed it together for some time before she died.

Number 2. T. Bone Burnett is a fabulous musician and his music over those credits and throughout the show were works of art. Even if you hated every other aspect of this show, musical genius shone through. The opening credit sequence is worth having as its own work of art that can proudly stand with any other video performance piece.

Number 3. This had tremendous visual style. This was also evident in season one. This is hard to find in tv work and prior to this has only been seen in movies. ""Hannibal"" also has this tremendous visual, artistic style. This is a real breakthrough for tv.

Now, unfortunately, there are the negatives.

Number 1. I am a fairly intelligent person but this plot was needlessly convoluted. I couldn't help comparing it to ""Chinatown"" which also had a complex plot set in southern California based on water rights. ""Chinatown"" was written by first rate writer Robert Towne though who is known for complex yet coherent scripts. He was/is also known for being called in to make coherent scripts which get needlessly convoluted as a ""script doctor."" David Lynch also does very convoluted plots but a guiding force is visible in his tv and film work which makes them coherent throughout. If you are going to write something this complex, you need these kinds of masters at the helm.

Number 2. Vince Vaughn and his character plus his wife. I think Vince Vaughn was supposed to be the Woody Harrelson equivalent to Farrell's Matthew M from the first season. He was not able to generate that kind of magic. Farrell was generating it. The spark was there but Vaughn did not know how to ignite his character and bring him fully to life. His dilemmas with his wife over children and other matters became wearying episode after episode. I did, however, enjoy Vaughn's final scenes closing out the show. He showed a comedic touch in those which I didn't think he had in him.

The remaining characters and actors I thought were all good. They were in between Farrell and Vaughn in ability. But this show was going to succeed or fail based primarily on those two actors and the script.

In sum, I can understand why people are so divided over this show. I can't give it the ringing endorsement I gave season one but if you can get past the flaws I've mentioned, there is a lot worth seeing (and listening to musically).",1440979200,2,3433,4.4467408585055646

7305735,3,B0106RTAPM,"After the spectacular first season, True Detective's second season takes too many steps backwards to keep the audience intrigued with the overall plot. The story does unfold like you are reading crime noir novel, but the pacing of it all just seems like wasted effort even at only 8 episodes. It's not that the story was hard to understand, it's just that there was not enough 'oomph' or visual weirdness like the first season to keep you eager for more and most importantly, enthralled with the characters. Even the shootout scenes here are still minuscule compared to season one's flawless finesse of that particular steady cam episode. This season plays out in one modern time period and doesn't use flash backs or recollection to explain our main characters or provide an intrigued to the case at hand. It's a shame too because the cast for this season are excellent choices for these characters, it's just there was nothing making me care that much about them. Personally, Vince Vaughn was the stand out, watching him going from worried crime boss to vengeful anti-hero scumbag of this season. Rachel McAdams and Colin Farrel play their detectives as you expect with something haunting them, but both literally go into cliche/trope territory at the end of this season. Out of all of them, the real downer is that this is probably Taylor Kitsch's best performance film or TV.  This guy can act, but he really needed something as grand as True Detective to help him in his filmography. Season 2 definitely doesn't help him here though.

Don't feel bad if the first two episodes don't capture your interest like season 1 did. Season 2 was too stagnant, and felt longer and like a chore. If you push yourself to care, yeah, it can be a good crime story. But ultimately, you are not missing much if you decide to skip this season entirely. Like the theme song states: ""though many tried, but never mind.""",1439942400,3,1904,4.766666666666667

7305737,5,B0106RTAPM,"Critics be damned! This season was terrific! Yes, it was byzantine to say the least and you had to watch and listen carefully to follow the plot threads, but it was well worth the time and effort. I watched each episode twice, which I almost never do with a series, and the richness and complexity of it intensified the second time around. Definitely for those who not only want to be entertained, but also involved and challenged. The portrait it paints of the cesspool that is Los Angeles, apart from the glitz and glamour that tourists see, and the avarice and corruption of government and law enforcement administration, is superb. It was an amazing run this year; kudos to both the actors and writers. Rumor has it that Season 3 will be located in Chicago...as a native, I can't wait to see what they'll do with my hometown!",1439683200,40,829,4.608108108108108
7305738,5,B0106RTAPM,"Don't buy the luke warm-cold remarks from critiques on this year's season. 2015 Season of True Detective is profoundly well written with truely genius casting; brilliant directing, acting and production from all involved!! These character's all hit you as totally believable in the context of their California environs and life circumstances. No HBO production has ever succeeded with me buying into the outcome for the characters, like this one! These characters will live in me forever, along with the exquisite opening images to the music with T.Bone's vocals along much of the music within the episodes. There's not an actor in this series for whom I've not gained a whole new level of respect  I have to believe, their performances will always prove noteworthy for each of them as they move through their careers.  If you missed seeing this series this summer  you've missed all that was worth your time on TV, period. For me, this never did feel like a TV series  more like a superb feature film that was just so intense and long, that breaks were needed to absorb the content and performances the episodes are seamless.  Looking forward to owning this on DVD as soon as possible. It's destined to grow into a classic",1439596800,7,1223,4.860576923076923
7305739,5,B0106RTAPM,"An incredible experience--beautifully dark folk music, bleak industrial landscapes, stellar performances, a complex, yet engaging plot-line, and a KILLER ending. I loved this.",1439596800,,175,6.6521739130434785
7305740,5,B0106RTAPM,"I liked 48 Hours and The Dead Pool as well as their cousins on TV but from time to time something different is needed. True Detective fits the bill. There's a realism wanted in the story. Consequently the protagonists can't be heroes but ordinary people even anti-heroes who rise to the occasion when they encounter an extraordinary situation. Of course sometimes you win and sometimes you lose. If you want sure justice, watch NCIS. I find them comforting. Do I believe it? No A criminal case is either quick or easy. In which case people would lose interest. Then there are those cases that can prove enormously difficult and interesting. Perhaps the first series was too slow at times and the second series too gloomy but both stories were quite interesting. There's also a clear need for a different time, place and characters with each case. After all how many times do police officers encounter these cases in their careers? Is the second story too gloomy? Maybe but it brings to mind a song by The Pretenders, ""Back on the Chain Gang"".

I found a picture of you, oh oh oh oh
 What hijacked my world that night
 To a place in the past
 We've been cast out of? oh oh oh oh
 Now we're back in the fight
 We're back on the train
 Oh, back on the chain gang

 A circumstance beyond our control, oh oh oh oh
 The phone, the tv and the news of the world
 Got in the house like a pigeon from hell, oh oh oh oh
 Threw sand in our eyes and descended like flies
 Put us back on the train
 Oh, back on the chain gang

 The powers that be
 That force us to live like we do
 Bring me to my knees
 When I see what they've done to you
 But I'll die as I stand here today
 Knowing that deep in my heart
 They'll fall to ruin one day
 For making us part

 I found a picture of you, oh oh oh oh
 Those were the happiest days of my life
 Like a break in the battle was your part, oh oh oh oh
 In the wretched life of a lonely heart
 Now we're back on the train
 Oh, back on the chain gang

7305741,5,B0106RTAPM,"Can't wait to receive this! The HBO series outdid it's first season, with convoluted plot twists, great performances, who would ever think Vince Vaughn could play such a complex criminal...and because of his respect for women, and total love of his wife, you still manage to hope he and Ray, and Ani get clean away! Colin, as Ray really brings out his love and devotion above all for his son desipe the fatal decision that ruined his life...Rachel is totally believeable as the competent, take charge cop, with a tortured secret of her own, to take the step to clear Ray's name and finally vanquish the bad guys.

7305742,5,B0106RTAPM,"Amazing season I only have three complains
1 - way to short , the storie lines was so good that could be told in few more episodes
2 - three of the main characters didn't survive , in all honesty I expected this outcome because after watching many movies and reding books about people living live on the edge usually ends tragically
3 - that's continuation of second complain , because most of the main characters are dead then it's impossible to make season 3 and continue this story . To bad because this could easily replace Sopranos as a next big thing on HBO .

I loved the first one but this second surpass my expectations I think I watched every episode two or three times while season was going on ...",1439337600,5,709,4.330827067669173

8721437,5,B0106RTAPM,Better than season 1.,1534896000,,21,4.5
8721438,4,B0106RTAPM,"Yes, season 2 had its flaws. Yes, season 2 had some cringy acting and questionable plot drives. However, the writers knew this would be extremely hard to top the success of season 1. Many people consider season 1 to be one of the best seasons of television ever, so of course it would be a really tough task to beat that! I love season 1, but I like season 2. Vince Vaughn gets better each episode, Taylor Kitsch was fine, Farrell and McAdams were perfect. The cinematography was excellent, more action packed than season 1 (if thats more your style), and we were able to connect with four leads rather than two. The LA setting and environment has been done and redone and that got a little cliche, especially since season 1 had the Louisiana bayou and rural areas where the story mainly evolved. Again, season 2 was a good season. If season 2 came before season 1, Im sure people wouldnt be so hard on it. It is a better directed and darker story than most detective and crime shows on TV anyways today. But everyones expectations were SOOOOOO high due to the success of season 1. I also think thats why the producers and studio went out and got the big names in Vaughn, Farrell, and McAdams because they thought their performances with the story would have been a suitable season 2. I almost look at this season to The Dark Knight Rises. The Dark Knight is probably the best superhero movie out there, and thats pretty non-negotiablekind of like season 1 of TD. Then TDKR is shown with big name actors (Hathaway and Hardy) and some amazing features throughout the film, but it just didn't deliver a better film than its prequel. Same with season 2 of TD. Its great, but its not perfect and its not better than season 1. Another example I can make is that people consider season 1 to be one of the best series ever...ever! So thats like putting pressure on screenwriters trying to write a better mob movie that will top the Godfather I and II. It just cant be done. So enjoy season 2 for what it is, because there are some great sequences throughout the season and the finale is spectacular.",1534464000,,2092,4.479057591623037

The plot?  1-1/2_STARS.  It felt like it was being raked out of a cat box.  Every time I was getting a grip on story more things turned up jumbling the Point.  I was seriously annoyed by the needlessly morbid ending.  There's no reason the the ending couldn't have been a good one.  The demise of the key characters seemed completely fabricated, forced, and unlikely given 10 hours of prior demonstrated caution and street smarts.
