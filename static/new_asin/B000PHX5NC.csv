2822636,5,B000PHX5NC,"A good double feature. Enemy at the Gate, based on truth a good point with me. Uncommon Valor it could have happened!",1225324800,,117,4.363636363636363
2822637,4,B000PHX5NC,"While ""Enemy at the Gates"" initially overviews the horrendous battle that took place for possession of Stalingrad between the Germans and Russians in World War Two, it is, in fact, a movie of great suspense focusing on two top snipers from either side.
I recommend that you look at the promo section before viewing the film as it gives you a great understanding of its direction. The principal aim of the film is to focus on the blue eyes of the two snipers as they concentrate looking through their scopes. It is brilliant direction.
Enemy at the Gates is a wonderful film of action and suspense from start to finish. I recommend it to all who want to view a realistic, action film of historical significance.",1213488000,5,710,4.642857142857143
2822638,3,B000PHX5NC,"Okay, I really like Enemy at the Gates, because I love history (especially wars) and I am a HUGE Ed Harris fan.

Uncommon Valor bored me, which is the only reason I rated this product 3 stars out of 5.",1206662400,,201,4.025

8191598,5,B000PHX5NC,"I love both of these movies. I remember when Uncommon Valor first came out. Little did I know that the ""youngest"" character would go on to star in other movies I would love including Dirty Dancing and Road House! I first watched this movie because my ex loved war movies even though I wasn't. This movie drew me in very quickly and I have watched it probably 50 times since that day! The storyline is very moving in both a good and bad way. I greatly recommend this movie.

Enemy at the Gates wasn't my ""normal"" type of movie. However, one day I was bored and decided to rent a movie. I picked one I had heard was good even though I wasn't sure if I would like it. However, I loved it! The way the two main characters play off each other is wonderful. The storyline is well thought out. I have watched it many times since that first time and pick up on more nuances along the way. I definitely recommend this movie.",1457308800,2,915,4.228571428571429
8191599,3,B000PHX5NC,Saw uncommon valor as a kid and thought it was great...but now as an adult i kinda see how cheesy and under produced it is. Enemy at the gates is a great movie and epic in some aspects. The disc does have a glitch though and pauses at about the 70 minute mark. Took 45 seconds of waiting to get to the next scene. Not exactly happy about this but for the price i guess i cannot complain to much.,1454976000,,395,3.95
