2632461,5,B000HA4WU2,"Anybody who is familiar with Michael's work knows he is a staunch supporter of analog and is a walking encyclopedia of the many options for acquiring vinyl LP's and turntables. But what's surprising about this disc is not his breadth of knowledge or willingness to share it, but the fact that he can make a potentially dry subject thoroughly entertaining. Music lovers will gain a lot from this disc, including a whole lotta (intentional) laughs. Highly recommended.",1179100800,14,466,5.064935064935065

2632465,5,B000HA4WU2,"Great DVD on setting up a turntable with respect to arm and cartridge. It is fun and entertaining at the same time and gives you the basics on how to do this important adjustment if you want to get the most from your vinyl setup.

If anything else, I could have wished for a more detailed demonstration on how the multi-meter setup is done on azimuth and then more background info on what is actually going on in the cartridge and how it works.

The use of Oscilloscope for doing the azimuth as well would have been a nice addition combined with the use of test records. Maybe this is besides the scope for this introductory video.",1422748800,,631,4.384615384615385
2632466,5,B000HA4WU2,"Setting up an audiophile-quality turntable, tonearm, and cartridge can be tedious, frustrating, and even maddening, given the poor instruction manuals typically provided and the potential ""gotchas"" in the process.  Michael Fremer has done the job too many times to count, and he's done critical listening to vinyl for thousands of hours.  Having him walk through the process on three turntable-arm combinations is EXTREMELY valuable.  I'm on my fifth modern vinyl rig now and I'm a Ph. D. experimental physicist.  I'm good with my hands doing electrical and mechanical work.  Even so, I'm a total neophyte next to Fremer.  IMHO, Fremer has done more to make vinyl playback survive and revive than anyone on the planet -- probably more than everybody else put together.  In the 90s, he was carrying a bright torch in a very dimly lit jungle of ""perfect sound forever.""  This DVD is worth its weight in gold to me.  I had just finished setting up my VPI Scout 2 when I ran across the DVD on Amazon.  Now I'm going to go back and retrace my steps, armed with a far better feel for things.  ***Update:  I've now gone back, armed with knowledge from the video.  My setup is now much more precise.  I've been working with a VPI Scout 2 turntable, which is a super-pain to setup.  Luckily, Fremer does a similar VPI Scoutmaster setup as his third demo.  Also, I used a ""Best Tractor"" from MINTLP.com, which is similar to the WallyTractors that Fremer uses.  His tips made overhang adjustment go much faster.

If you scour the Web for information on tonearm and cartridge setup, you'll find people being way over the top, swearing that everything has to be perfect down to the gnat's eyelash.  Fremer knows what matters and what doesn't, not just for having done it, but for having listened to the results of his efforts.  If anyone is the last word on this topic, it's Fremer.

People have complained that the production is amateurish and Fremer's humor is lame.  I'm somewhere in the middle on those two points (he has worked successfully as a standup comic), and, regardless, think both are irrelevant to my purpose for buying the DVD.  I do value the information he provided on the historical evolution of vinyl as a recording medium.  I enjoyed his extended interview with a recording engineer and learned some things I'd missed over the years.  The PDF file provided with the video also includes a lot of useful information.

I can't recommend this product enough!",1418688000,3,2462,4.774881516587678
2632467,3,B000HA4WU2,"I bought this DVD from Amazon a few years ago and just re-watched it because I have to mount and align a cartridge on a new turntable/arm rig that I bought. While Fremer's presentation is generally good and informative, the production values are quite low and it was rather conceited to include the old 1/2 hr film of Fremer attempting stand-up comedy. Really not funny.
My main problem, though, is that I can't find the turntable-cartridge set-up PDF file that is repeatedly referred to and talked about in reviews of this disc. I've gone through the disc menu repeatedly, as well as through the video itself, and I can't find it at all. I know that its 28 pages would be very helpful in my upcoming cartridge set-up.

If anyone reads this and knows how to find the PDF file on this disc, please contact me or write it here. Thanks very much.",1403136000,,843,4.509803921568627
2632468,1,B000HA4WU2,"Slow moving and boring. Contains countless mistakes that they attempt to correct with text bubbles superimposed on the video.

2632469,5,B000HA4WU2,"Yes his attempts at humor fall flat but so do many of the record collectors I've met so whats new.  I do wish he'd setup at least one budget, old Thorens, Duel or Technics table but again, the info provided on the expensive tables is universal .  What I like the most is that while I get the feeling he's an audiophile, he doesn't come off as a snob.  I've been playing records since I was in diapers and at 45  I still learned a few new things watching this DVD.  I hope he does another.",1389657600,,488,4.041666666666667
2632470,5,B000HA4WU2,"The set-up process describedin the DVD is clear, concise and when I followed the steps in the correct sequence I got great results - in fact my system sounds the best it ever has (after only 40 years of trying!). I did need patience though - it took me forever to get the cartridge stylus correctly aligned. I am now working through my entire LP collection - and have realised how much I was missing in the past. The DVD is not region coded - so worked fine in the UK. I find Mr Fremer's style to be engaging and informative - I particularly liked his British accent during the description of LP packaging differences. I also enjoyed the section on Sterling Sound and the George Marino interview.",1381622400,,696,4.4453125
2632471,4,B000HA4WU2,"As a regular reader of Stereophile and its columnist/reviewer and analog junkie Michael Fremer, I thought this disc would be educational and entertaining and would pass it along to my 27 year old son who has recently embraced vinyl.  While I own and buy vinyl records and have for many years, I also have a sizable collection of other media including Fremer's dreaded CDs.

I currently use 3 different turntables including a vintage Bang & Olufsen with a linear tracking arm.  I've had many tables over the years, but few of the quality that Fremer sets up here or usually reviews.  But like he says in the film, a properly set up turntable will sound darn good regardless of price, or something to that effect.

The opening session actually features Fremer humorously telling us how and why vinyl evolved and how he sees it as the perfect medium for music.  Even he would have to admit however, it's pretty difficult to play a record in the car.  He shows how elegant an LP package is compared to a similar but smaller CD case.  Well, I just got a new vinyl album that was inside a paper sleeve, then sandwiched between a piece of brown cardboard folded in half.  The whole album was then surrounded by a clear plastic sleeve to keep everything from falling out including a loose piece of paper with all the credits and thank yous.

In any case, the instructional DVD was all pretty informative.  He moves on to how vinyl recordings are made and brings in a mastering engineer who explains how records are created and reproduced, all in great detail.  This may or may not interest you.  He then gets into how to set up 3 different turntables (Pro-Ject RM-5, Rega P5 and VPI Scoutmaster).  Watching this for me was pretty informative.  Although I've set up my own tables over the years, I learned a few tips from Fremer, especially some of the techniques and equipment he uses.  I have to admit that I got a little freaked out with the complexity of the VPI.  Even Fremer struggled.  Beginners may be scared away from vinyl all together after watching that segment.  Included is a detailed PDF file you can access on your computer which provides even more detail and set up tips.",1370044800,3,2179,4.583979328165374
2632472,4,B000HA4WU2,"Michael Fremer is very funny and is crazy about TT, I recommend this dvd to those that are beginning in this wonderful vinyl world!",1368403200,,131,4.5
2632473,4,B000HA4WU2,"Like many people my age (30), my exposure to vinyl was limited to playing around with my mom's collection and her el-cheapo all-in-one turntable/cassette/CD/radio unit when I was growing up. I have played and loved CDs my whole life. However, as I began to get older, I became interested in higher quality reproduction of music, and as such became interested in seeing what vinyl had to offer. Unfortunately, there just aren't many resources available these days that are targeted to people like myself, who are intelligent and very interested in learning, but who know absolutely NOTHING about turntables, cartridges, etc. Enter '21st Century Vinyl.' I finally broke down and ordered the DVD, and having just watched it front to back, I have a few notes that might be helpful to someone considering purchasing it:

1). Michael Fremer has certainly forgotten more about vinyl playback that the vast majority of us will ever know-- but he is really, really annoying. If you are going to watch this, you have to understand first that there is a TON of truly fantastic information in here that will make you understand turntables far better than before-- but you're going to have to suffer through Fremer's constant attempts to be funny (which almost universally fail in this attempt), his wildly unorganized style (he gives info at the very end of turntable setups that are crucial to setting them up correctly from the beginning), and the downright inaccurate information he constantly throws out (which are corrected by numerous 'pop-ups' that appear onscreen, similar to the shows on VH1 in the late 90s and early 2000s). This DVD is definitely worth watching, but you'll probably have to work hard not to let Fremer's overbearing idiosyncrasies detract from the value of the experience.

2). This should probably not be your only resource for setting up turntables. As mentioned above, the exceedingly poor organization of the material here means that the wonderful information you're getting is generally out of order, and would be very difficult to follow if you didn't have anything else to use. Check out vinylengine.com-- they are a MASSIVE help in finding the information you need, in an order that isn't idiotic.

3). This is probably more of an addendum to #2 above, but there are several important things that I don't believe Mr. Fremer ever makes clear throughout the process-- including the fact that you need to zealously guard your cartridge stylus from hitting anything other than what it should be touching (the records, the protractor, etc). He makes numerous allusions to this, but generally trails off with a nebulous warning along the lines of ""make sure your tonearm doesn't bang around, because, you know, you know what will happen then"" or something equally unhelpful.

Overall, I would say that this DVD is very, very useful, and very much a necessity if you're planning on learning how to properly set up a turntable. However, the moment that someone who is organized, knowledgeable, and less constantly enamored of how unbelievably clever he is decides to get this information out, you can safely toss this in the trash. Until that day, this is required viewing for turntable beginners and enthusiasts, in my opinion. (Now can somebody less wanker-y please do this type of video right??)",1330732800,14,3314,5.041970802919708
2632474,2,B000HA4WU2,"Let me start by saying I love LP playback. I have spent a lot of time and money putting together a fairly transparent analog front end.  So I'm in the choir as they say. And maybe that's why I was so disappointed with this DVD.

I also want to say I like what I've read and seen from Mr. Fremer. I'm glad he's out there championing this rich, unique and beloved medium. He's been fighting the good fight against the socially maladjusted, radical objectivists --- and I thank him for that.

But this video boarders on pathetic; It's awkwardly unscripted, poorly edited, and seemingly carelessly brought to market.  He didn't even bother to re-take a few shots, he just put caption balloons over the video explaining what should have been said or shown, while he's telling you wrong or incomplete information. -pretty shoddy.

And as far as instructing people on how to set up a tonearm/turntable, you really have to watch him set up all 3 decks to get all the basic information. I really think this info would be better delivered as one clear, linear presentation and not dispersed over 60 minutes of redundant video and diluted with snarky one-off attempts at being funny or clever;  or with long, drawn-out shots of him fidgeting to get the nuts on the cartridge mounting screws in real time.

It's only a good source of this info because it seems to be the ONLY source of this info. But so poorly done, it'd be easy to better if someone had the same resources.

The DVD has an ""Easter egg"" too. I think it can be accessed by FF'ing through the end of the main video. It's a 30minute black and white film made of Mr. Fremer back when he was a stand-up comic (?). Seems people didn't think he was funny back then either.

I don't know what to say; buy it if you don't think all the various online guides to cartridge set-up are sufficient for your understanding. Not sure what watching Mr. Fremer set up a 'table provides over doing a little internet research. But if you've done that research and it's still not coming together for you, go ahead.",1322006400,8,2047,4.510810810810811
2632475,5,B000HA4WU2,"21st Century Vinyl gives you an explanation and education about the analog recording technology that can still compete and often surpass digital recording methods.

2632476,1,B000HA4WU2,"I find it astonishing that people still fiddle around with snap, crackle and pop vinyl when there are available, in their thousands, CDs which provide high quality audio reproduction.

Each to his own, of course, but what impresses me about this DVD which certainly gives a comprehensive, across the board overview of vinyl lore, is the incredible effort involved in just extracting from a vinyl record music which any reasonably priced CD player will give you straight out of the box.

As for the contentious issue of vinyl vs CD superiority, the market voted on that one long ago. Basically, this DVD is directed at a niche market comprising people fascinated by an outdated technology of audio reproduction.

There is, of course, one very worthwhile use to which vinyl (and shellac) technology is relevant and that is the restoration, actually better termed, recovery and digital remastering of music originally recorded on shellac and vinyl. The quality of this work has been rather variable but a stellar performer has been the Doremi Labs run by Jacob Harnoy. Their pioneering work on early to mid 20th century performers is remarkable and, in my opinion, completely faithful to the music and the musician.",1234483200,5,1212,5.05
2632477,3,B000HA4WU2,"Having been away from vinyl for many years, I needed help in setting up my newly purchased turntable. Yes, there was at least 10 minutes of useful information. However, Mr. Fremer's battle stories quickly wear thin for me and seem more appropriate for a blog. I didn't shell out $$ for poorly produced entertainment--I want a brain dump from an expert that goes beyond what I can pick up in a couple hours of reading audio forums. The production quality reminds me of an bad '80s corporate training video. This is a shame, there are a bunch of newbies like me who want more information, but this disc took the easy way out.",1231372800,18,623,4.522123893805309
2632478,5,B000HA4WU2,"21st Century Vinyl is a must have for anyone with a turntable.
It meticulously takes each step in the set up process and fully explains it on three popular, or at least, representative, current turntables.
It is an invaluable reference which both explains, details and reviews the use of a turntable.
I would heartily recommend it. However, both myself and a friend's wife (the friend also has the disc) commented on the way the presenter handled the LP's at the beginning of the disc. Definitely, do not take this as the way to handle your valuable and in many ways irreplaceable, LP's. throwing them aside, placing hands on the playing surface and pushing the record back into the cover before casting it aside! Oooh, made me annoyed.
In any case, despite this minor gripe, a very solid and well-presented disc with a small element of whimsy from on-screen notes (such as ""You didn't see that!"" when the presenter accidentally knocks the tonearm off it's rest while explaining something......) make this an essential companion for turntable owners.",1209081600,4,1050,4.971590909090909
2632479,5,B000HA4WU2,"I have been a music fan forever. But I was always upset by the results I got from record players/turntables. All the surface noise, the snap crackle pop during quiet passages drove me nuts. When Compact Discs arrived I sold all of my albumns and started over. But, to face reality, the sound just isn't as good. So after several years of trying to ignore it I came back to Vinyl. The first thing I learned was that I never really understood how to properly set up a cartridge in a turntable. After much study I concluded that I might not ever learn how and why doesn't someone make a DVD about it. about three days later I stumbled upon this DVD by accident. Knowing that M Fremer is the resident Guru of vinyl at Stereophile I snapped it up. Mr. Fremer has made a most informative video about how records are made, some history of vinyl, and how to set up your turntable. He walks you through setting up three different turntables. The tape does not seem to be overly rehearsed, or edited. As he encounters problems he deals with them and explains his thinking rather than stopping the tape and eliminating the problem. Very real world way of doing things. I found this product most enjoyable and enlightening. My Turntable sounds better than ever also.",1203033600,4,1254,4.52863436123348
2632480,5,B000HA4WU2,"I liked this dvd. Michael Fremer is very funny and obviously loves vinyl. He shows you three turntable setups as well as goes over the history of the format. He spends some time in a cutting studio, and shows you his continum caliburn ($100,000) right at the end. The only thing I wish this showed was the rest of his stereo, just out of curiosity, and I wish he put discs on and played them. I suppose he couldn't without paying royalties, but still, it would have been neat to hear. (even though a DVD)",1193443200,3,504,4.315789473684211

This video is both very informative and entertaining. Apart from the setting up of three turntables in three different price classes, all of which he does very well. Michael gives a short introduction to diferent LP qualities, from ""Virgin"" vinyl - British, to ""Streetwalker"" vinyl - American. And, during the various set-ups, he admonishes us, the watchers, to ""don't go crazy"" during set-up. At the end of the video, he introduces us to his personal turntable, the Continuum Audio Labs ""Colibri"". Said piece of equipment costing around USD 100,000. Michael, when it came down to it, ""went crazy"".

2632482,4,B000HA4WU2,"In addition to being a well respected audio equipment reviewer, Fremer is, no doubt, an expert in the vinyl field. It certainly makes perfect sense to learn turntable set-up from the very best. Unfortunately, the video is a bit disappointing. As a ""how-to"" guide, it skips some glory details -- several sections were cut short. It seems to me that Mr. Fremer was terribly bored by having to set up all these tables. But the details are exactly what the newbies need. Did I learn something I don't know before? Absolutely. Can I set up a VPI Scout all by myself? Well, I ""guess"" I could. From the perspective of providing info on vinyl, it did a reasonable job. But I certainly expect more from such an expert. Would I recommend it to someone who wants to set up his/her own table?
