8560417,3,B00B0W9WR4,"Most of the Information advertised on Amazon for the most recent Italian DVD from ECOFINA,
 Due Mafiosi Nel Far West is Wrong. The picture is clear and colourful But FULL SCREEN.
It runs for 1h 45min, and has NO SUBTITLES. ONLY Italian language is available,
 besides a few trailers from other Franco and Ciccio movies.
We can differentiate this one from another previous edition from Cechi Gore, by the front colour of the cover: most is in ORANGE, as well as the back cover.
I do not know who to blame for the wrong information but I know how disappointed and frustrated I become
for buying this DVD.  I alerted the seller, who promptly and kindly reimbursed me one third of shipping cost.
So, for anyone willing to get this DVD, be aware that the INFO stated above is what will be on the DVD.
NO Subtitles at all, NO Widescreen, and longer than advertised. ONLY Italian audio!!!",1384992000,,881,4.563291139240507
