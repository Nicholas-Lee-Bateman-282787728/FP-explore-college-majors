8276971,4,B001AD8FIA,"Sinster Cinema presents the 1966 Adventure Pictures four part serial ""Captain Celluloid Vs. The Film Pirates: The Special Edition.""  It is a tribute to serial films of the first half of the 20th Century,  definitely a labour of love on the part of the film makers.  It is technically a black and white silent serial movie.  It is a slient movie in that any spoken dialog is done with title cards, yet it has a sound track with dramatic music and sound effects.  Most of the film is action and violence as Captain Celluloid tries to foil The Master Duplicator and his hoodlums from hijacking film prints and negatives to make bootleg copies for the black market.",1408665600,,661,4.615384615384615

Thanks goes to the folks who made the film for putting it into a contemporary format.

I'd assumed the original copy of the movie was collecting dust in someone's closet or attic -- never to be seen again.

A good friend -- Bill Barr -- who was involved in the film's production, asked me to do a few stunts for the film way back in 1966.  I played Captain Celluloid in the motorcycle chase scenes and in a few of the fight scenes.

For a bunch of gifted amateur film makers creating an action serial, Captain Celluloid has a great story concept and excellent production quality.  It pays tribute to the cliff hanger serials such as Flash Gordon and Perils of Pauline seen in the movies.

The story idea is based on movie-making itself.  The film pirates, let by the ""Master Duplicator"" (AKA Master Duper) steal the master copies of some recently unearthed movie classics.  The theft takes place while the masters are on route to a safe location.

The serial shows the encounters between the Master Duper, his henchmen and Captain Celluloid as the forces of good and evil fight for the classsic movie masters.

Filming was done in and around Bergen County, New Jersey, in towns such as Fort Lee and Englewood.

Actually, in the early days of movies, Fort Lee was something of a ""film capital"" until the industry moved to California.  Many of the mansions in Englewood were once home to famous silent film actors, actresses, producers and directors of the day.

I did the motorcycle chase scenes on a Sunday morning on relatively empty interior roads threading through and around the Public Service Electric & Gas (PSE&G) generating plant property in Ridgefield.

The opening scenes of the long lost master copies being unearthed were actually filmed at a New Jersey Bell Telephone construction site -- I believe in Englewood. Members of the movie's production crew shoved the labeled film cans into a dirt embankment and the backhoe ""unearthed"" them.

The Master Duper and Captain Celluloid are always in hooded costumes.  This enabled the film makers to have numerous ""actors"" play these parts.  Essentially the hoods made it easy to answer the question, ""Who is availble today to be Captain Celluloid?""

It is my understanding that when the Master Duper's identity is finally revealed, the ""exposure"" scene was filmed a number of times with the individual film makers standing in as the Duper.  So each person has his own personalized version of the movie.

Captain Celluloid is a silent film with the dialogue appearing in subtitles.  The action is what makes the film very enjoyable, and the subtitles don't detract from what you see on the screen.

Great film, lots of fun, quality production.

Check it out.",1374796800,2,2869,4.796334012219959
