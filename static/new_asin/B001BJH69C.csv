3493570,5,B001BJH69C,"If you like a good Robert B. Parker mystery, I recomend you watch these great movies starring Tom Selleck.",1217030400,4,106,4.631578947368421
3493571,2,B001BJH69C,I've read a LOT of the Spenser novels and ALL of the Jesse Stone novels. These movies disappointed me. The movies resembled the books in name only. Whoever directed these movies took a lot of liberties. They do not follow the story lines at all. I am surprised Robert B. Parker allowed his work to be butchered like this.,1242432000,,321,4.4576271186440675
3493572,5,B001BJH69C,"I don't watch a lot of network TV, so I didn't find out about this series until I discovered them at my local video store.  What a find!  They don't have the quick pace of most TV movies, or shows but they are very engaging.  There isn't a whole lot of blood, nor shootm up bang bang, but interesting life experiences of a small town police chief who came from LA, where he was a detective.  The stories are excellent, as is the acting.",1241308800,,436,4.154761904761905
3493573,5,B001BJH69C,As a longtime fan of Tom Selleck (Quigley Down Under) I find his portrayal of Jesse Stone is right on.  I realize Jesse is younger in the books but Selleck has him pegged.  How about coupling Jesse up with Sunny Randall or Spenser in a mlovie?,1240704000,,243,4.260869565217392
3493574,5,B001BJH69C,Unusually entertaining DVDs - this character is perfect for Tom Selleck and he plays the part very well.,1239062400,,104,4.833333333333333
3493575,5,B001BJH69C,"Robert Parker brings a great series to the screen in this small town police chief and the politics that come with his position, plus his own personal demons. They are all full of mystery and suspense, but they keep it real, old style. There is no CSI or bodies cut open on a slab in a morgue. It shows you do not need all of that when you have someone like Tom Selleck bring this character to life with every flaw of a real man in a real job. I wish it would become a series. Everyone always says it's the forensics that make the case, well it shows it takes Police work too and investigating everything. He has the famous gut feelings that make Mark Harmon's character so great on NCIS. I look forward to every movie. I know it will not be a disappointment from the characters in the book, the adaptation from book to movie is smooth.",1238371200,,835,4.225
3493576,1,B001BJH69C,"This rating is based only on price of this 4 disk ""set"" and  not on content.  In fact I love these DVDs.

As of the date of this review, you can buy each of the 4 DVDs in the set individually for $42.46.  Why would anyone pay $52.49 for a set of the same 4 DVDs.  There doesn't appear to be anything to justify the extra ten dollars.

I find this a lot on combined items.  I think Amazon adjusts the prices of the individual items but never looks at the sets.

Buyer Beware",1236124800,,473,3.9574468085106385
3493577,5,B001BJH69C,"I just love these videos.  A sleepy town call Paradise.  A former LAPD officer named Jesse Stone becomes the police chief.  His main occupation is giving out parking tickets on a normal day.  He has a major drinking problem and keeps in touch with his ex-wife every day by phone.  Then all of a sudden these murders occurred.  We find out in one video that a serial killing couple has an interest in him for some unknown reason.  In another, to curb his drinking problem, he looks into a cold case of a bank robbery gone wrong; with surprising results.

A very good series.  Hope they make more videos of Robert J. Parker's novels with Tom Selleck as the police chief.",1231632000,,668,4.454545454545454
3493578,4,B001BJH69C,"As written by Robert B. Parker, Jesse Stone is not always admirable in his actions.  He still has to fight the battle with booze, which he so clearly enjoys.  As his advisor/shrink, William DeVane cuts him no slack and does him no favors.  Having had an alcoholic brother who relapsed so many times that one of those had to become his last, I see Stone fight the battle and see similarities to my brother such that it appears inevitable that Stone will eventually meet the same bad end.
Further, Stone allows himself to be controlled by a manipulative ex-wife who, beyond her looks, does not appear to have sufficient redeeming qualities to put up with her.  He allows her to keep him from going on with his life by the vague and slim promise of their possibly getting back together.

Selleck has done a superb job of showing us that Stone is a complex character, neither hero nor anti-hero.  Some of the stories rely too heavily upon his ""cop-instincts"" for smelling out bad guys when insufficient information is given.  I had read all of the books from which these movies were made and a comprehensive treatment of the content of the books would have taken 3-4 hours.  I, for one, would not have minded the full treatment.

As made for TV movies go, these are about as good as you will find.

3493579,5,B001BJH69C,"I'm a fan of the Hercule Poirot, Mrs. Marple, Inspector Lynley mysteries  these are just as fine - just superb. Selleck is superb at playing so low key a character, a man so hurt and humbled, on a wholly different plane than he had previously lived, and trying to hold off succumbing to an  addiction while holding down a very responsible position. His humility really seems the key to his efforts to help those similarly humbled by crime.

Each of these is a wonderful moody mystery, with a wonderful setting, fascinating plot, aptly non-show-offy dialogue, good supporting cast, with some of the greatest acting by Selleck you'll see in this country. It's VERY worthwhile to rent - better to buy. You'll be very very happy with the result.",1219708800,11,741,4.7734375
3493580,5,B001BJH69C,"They are well written, well acted dramas with excellent supporting characters and best of all, the perfect leading man in Tom Selleck.  I highly recommend for anyone who wants their whodunits with a little substance.  A must for any Tom Selleck fan - he is like a fine wine that just improves with age.",1218067200,11,302,4.574074074074074

8283303,5,B001BJH69C,"The music is soulful and perfect as the backdrop to these films.  Tom Selleck is his best as a cop though his westerns are great too... Monty Walsh.  His character is low key but determined.  What do they say?  ""He always gets his man/woman"".  His character is well developed and the mysteries believable.  There is room for many additional movies.  I like the small town setting.  There are four additional movies from this series.  Keep them coming Tom.",1378771200,,455,4.730769230769231
8283304,5,B001BJH69C,this was a gift for my husband - he likes Jesse Stone stories. He really wants all of the series but since I was paying it was only one set!! These are good who-dun-it dramas.,1368835200,,175,4.0285714285714285
8283305,5,B001BJH69C,"As usual, Tom Selleck brings Jesse Stone to life! Great purchase, quick shipping. I highly recommend these DVD's for all the Stone fans!",1358640000,,136,4.956521739130435

The series is great and has many clever elements. With
each successive movie the watcher learns to watch
for repeat elements that are often funny, endearing or
heart wrenching....",1350864000,,236,4.925
8283308,5,B001BJH69C,"I bought this set for a gift for my daughter and her husband. We all like Tom Selleck a lot, and love his movies, especially his westerns, but also his Jesse Stone movies. We find them very entertaining, and Tom`s acting is always superb!! I hope Tom keeps making movies for a long time - I think he`s the best!!!!",1283644800,,314,4.25
8283309,4,B001BJH69C,"I just finished watching all five movies but I couldn't really find a reliable recommended viewing sequence and the slipcases don't reveal much either. This series is somewhat odd anyway because the individual movies were not produced/released in sequence. I recommend viewing the series in this order to more-or-less keep the time line straight.

Night Passage: Jesse Stone moves from Los Angeles to Paradise, Massachusetts after he and his wife divorce and he is terminated from LAPD for drinking on the job. This isn't necessarily a bad thing because the main ""bad guy"" is looking for a police chief that will turn a blind eye to corrupting in the city.

Stone Cold was actually filmed first in the series but the time line occurs after Night Passage so it makes more sense to watch Stone Cold after Night Passage.

Death in Paradise: ""Suitcase"" is shot in the line of duty.

Sea Change: ""Suitcase"" is still in the hospital at the beginning of the movie. Any further details might spoil the movie.

Thin Ice: The city council forces Jesse Stone to take a leave of absence without pay. In the final scene, Jesse is on a bus presumably leaving town.",1245542400,6,1150,4.758793969849246
8283310,5,B001BJH69C,"The best cinema is dependent on creating characters that you care about.  This series does it in spades.  Selleck creates a character that I'd love to know.  The acting is good, the stories are entertaining, and somewhat twisted.  My family loved each one of them. The plots are a well developed if not a bit predictable.  I found something unexpected in each one of them.
I own these movies..",1244246400,,393,4.63768115942029
