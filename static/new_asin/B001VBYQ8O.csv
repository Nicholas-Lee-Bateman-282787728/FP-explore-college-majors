see if we could find it and here it was.  It is exactly what he wanted and it got here in time for his
birthday!  Thanks so much.",1329004800,,230,3.9565217391304346
8345894,1,B001VBYQ8O,"I purchased the CD ""The Best of Fred Waring and the Pennsylvanians"" as a gift for my aging parents who used to love listening to those albums. However, the CD arrived with a damaged cover and I'm afraid to open it or give it to my parents because the CD might be broken. i read the return policy, and they not only make you pay for shipping, but also charge you a 15% restocking fee. So now, I don't know what to do. I'm looking at this unopened damaged package thinking, ""What recourse do i have???"" It was damaged somehow in transit and looks as if I'm getting stuck with it. I'm sure the music would have sounded good, but I'm afraid to open it because I'm still pondering what to do.",1264291200,,687,4.212121212121212
