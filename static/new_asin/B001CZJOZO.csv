8471142,5,B001CZJOZO,"Just because there's no Japanese option doesn't make this a bad package. While the voices aren't as good as in Japanese, the English voice actors still do a good job.

For anyone wondering what episodes are on this, here's the list:

""Settling A Not-So-Old Score!""
""Drifloon On The Wind!""
""The Champ Twins!""
""Some Enchanted Sweetening!""
""The Grass Is Always Greener!""
""An Angry Combeenation!""
""All Dressed Up With Somewhere To Go!""
""Buizel Your Way Out Of This!""",1330732800,,462,5.065789473684211
