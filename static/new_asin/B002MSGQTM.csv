8374026,5,B002MSGQTM,"I love this movie and have for years.  It's kind of corny in places, but it points to a bygone day when people were wholesome, decent and God fearing (much more so than in our day) regardless of their station in life.  The characters are all memorable and well developed.  I would highly recommend it along with the 1934 version.",1426550400,,329,4.45
