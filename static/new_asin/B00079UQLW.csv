2207957,3,B00079UQLW,It is okay if you want to see a typical movie from the black play circuit. The book was much better than the play. They should have done a short film instead.,1418860800,,158,3.96875

2207965,4,B00079UQLW,The plot was not very well defined.  The story could have been a bit thicker to captivate the audience.  The ending is really good.,1384041600,,131,4.416666666666667

2207969,3,B00079UQLW,"Pretty good movie, could've been longer to explain what one's wife did with her pregnancy by another man and it could've shown her raising the child, but pretty good.",1351987200,,166,4.758620689655173
2207970,4,B00079UQLW,This is a great play and shows how the black man behaves when he is stuck on himself. It also tells a story line on how that type of man treats the woman in his life because of his ego being so badly damaged and bruised. Definitely a play that you will enjoy.,1263081600,,259,3.9056603773584904
2207971,5,B00079UQLW,This is a wonderful movie (quality and all) that has a beautiful message attached not to spoil the movie but once you have seen this it will become very clear what life is all about. I must say that this is a powerful movie and the information that is presented is one that will not be forgotten.,1261612800,,296,4.2105263157894735

2207974,5,B00079UQLW,"This is an awesome play.  This is actually my second copy. I really enjoyed this play.  In my opinion the book is a little bit more detailed, but the play is great. The actors bring life to the characters.",1204243200,,205,4.230769230769231
2207975,2,B00079UQLW,"if i had not read the book before seeing the play i would not had brought the play.  i did not enjoy the play, because there is no way a play can give you what a book or movie can tell you.  the book was good it gave you food for your imagination. the movie when made will only give you more food for thought. i would not suggest buying the play.  i would suggest buying the book and go see the movie when it come out.the movie is going to be made this year or next if they have not started on it already.",1191196800,,505,3.7904761904761903
2207976,5,B00079UQLW,I saw the live play and loved it sooooo much that I had to buy the DVD.  I'm Ready Productions always puts out excellent work.  This play is a keeper.  I have watched it numerous times.,1189641600,,185,4.083333333333333
2207977,2,B00079UQLW,"i'm not a fan of the ""chitlin circuit"" plays, it was an unintentional purchase and i was affirmed in my dislike.  however, if you are not as picky, you may find it entertaining.",1187222400,2,177,4.363636363636363
2207978,5,B00079UQLW,"I really enjoy the live play, but viewing it in the comfort of my own home and with my special guy at my home was even better.  Afterwards we had a lot of topics to discuess and a chance to see each other's views about things. It's not too heavy and will keep you laughing!",1183766400,2,273,3.963636363636364
2207979,5,B00079UQLW,"great play! Truth be told!! I went to school with Darius McCrary, he was a great actor and did a great job playing the main character! Definitely a movie to reccommend to the single girlfriends who need some light shed on the dating game!",1181174400,2,238,4.431818181818182

2207982,5,B00079UQLW,"This was an excellent play.  I didn't think I could got passed remembering him as his character from ""Family Matters, but five minutes into the play, I realized there was no comparison.  Darius is now a mature and confident young man.  If your looking for laughs (Arnez J) and sometimes tears (Billy D., this is a good DVD to purchase.",1178496000,,335,4.55
2207983,5,B00079UQLW,"I really enjoyed this movie.  It holds true form to the book.  I knew that Darius could sing, but his acting was wonderful.",1178496000,2,123,4.304347826086956
2207984,4,B00079UQLW,"I was pretty impressed with Arnez J's acting; however, I could have done without the comedy skit.  The cast had great chemistry.  Darius did great and he is FINE!

2207986,5,B00079UQLW,"THIS PLAY IS GOOD. I ENJOYED IT. IF YOU LIKE GOOD ENDINGS AND LAUGHS YOU WILL LIKE IT TOO. IT HAS REAL LIFE EVENTS IN IT LIKE - WHEN ONE OF THE CHARACTERS GOT ENGAGED, HER BOYFRIED STAYED ON THE JOB TOO MUCH AND SHE WENT TO A COUNSELOR (A PASTOR) AND SHE GOT PREGNANT BY THE COUNSELOR. HER FIANCEE' WAS REALLY IN LOVE WITH HER, EVENTUALLY HE FORGAVE HER.BUT BEFORE HE FORGAVE HER HE WENT TO HAVE A TALK WITH THE PASTOR(AND IT WAS MORE THAN A TALK)THE GIGOLO IN THE PLAY WAS SOMETHING SERIOUS, HE THOUGHT HE WAS GOD'S GIFT TO THE WORLD.

2207987,4,B00079UQLW,"Arnez J had me rolling. tripped me out him talking about his Brother.

2207990,3,B00079UQLW,The play was alright. I think it had some slow parts. Arnez J was very funny though. The book was so much better. But this won't stop me from buying the rest of the plays based on the books by Micheal B.,1173312000,,203,3.857142857142857
2207991,5,B00079UQLW,"A very good play.  I enjoyed the acting, storyline and definitely the beauty of the actors and actress.  I must say, I was pleasantly surprised by the acting (and physique) of Darius McCrary.  In the past I always felt he was somewhat of a corny, under developed  actor, both on television (Family Matters) and in film (Kingdom Come).  He has come a long way.

Arnez J, who has always managed to get a hearty laugh out of me whenever he appears on comic view, does a wonderful job as well.

I highly recommend this play!",1171584000,4,520,4.410526315789474
2207992,5,B00079UQLW,I watched this play the day I got it. I usually don't watch movies based on books until I've read the book.  I took a chance and watched the movie first. It was a great play all the actors made this play worth the money.  A surprise performance that I enjoyed was Arnez J.  His singing isn't great but his acting is.  There are a lot of inside jokes in this that you have to listen for to catch them.  Let me just say that Billy Dee looks great even at his age.  I suggest you spend the money to get this play the opening monologue by Darius McCrary is worth the money alone.,1171152000,5,575,4.0
2207993,3,B00079UQLW,this play was a let down to me. I have the play men cry in the dark and it was much better than this one which was also a book by michael baisden.,1128470400,,146,3.4545454545454546
