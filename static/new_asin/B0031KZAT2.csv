The acting may not be the best but the story is right on the money.  For those who have never had the misfortune of finding themselves in the caretaker role, the movie is a must in order to understand what those of us have experienced.",1477699200,,408,4.561643835616438

8387066,5,B0031KZAT2,"This is a film that transcends above the base views of domestic partnership in America, and becomes more about the human condition. A beautiful story of two people who care about one another in a way we can all relate to. What would you do for a loved one that could no longer take care for themselves? Would you give up on them in the long run and take the easy route, or would you do everything in your being to save them? That is the question that is posed in this wonderful film adaptation of the book ""Marathon"" by Richard Harties. If you love classic cinema you will love this film as I do. The trailers that come before the film are not indicative of the film itself. In fact they are no where near the quality and cinematic value of the film they accompany. Please enjoy this film and let other film efficianotos become aware of this cinematic treasure.",1297123200,6,861,4.354037267080745
