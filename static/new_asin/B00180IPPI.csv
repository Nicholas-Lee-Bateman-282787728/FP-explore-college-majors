8268038,5,B00180IPPI,"This marvellous mini-series is a wonderful counterpoint to the worship of weakness in today's culture, which took root in the counter-culture of the 1920s but assumed far more grotesque forms from the 1960s onwards, in the generation before mine.  Without yet any retreat.  What a pleasure to see a genuine work of art that speaks the truth, and like the very best art, and the hero of the work, speaks the truth and affirms sanity even when everyone else is mad.",1436227200,,463,4.703703703703703
8268039,5,B00180IPPI,I would recommend this DVD to my post-graduate students wishing to complement their analysis of the novel with this TV adaptation. The downside of it: the PRICE (fairly high).,1368662400,,175,5.068965517241379
8268040,5,B00180IPPI,I really enjoy British dramas and was so hapy to have this dvd at such a good price. This story is as enjoyable as Downton Abbey.,1368057600,,129,4.0
8268041,5,B00180IPPI,"The ""Anglo Saxon Attitudes"" story is told through the eyes and memory of Gerald Middleton, played by Richard Johnson, who is a retired historian with little to show for his working life. He struggles with a new job offer also along the historical mode. He's mentally pained from love choices made during his earlier life. Gerald seems to be about the only sane character in the story. He is a person everyone can relate to, especially older generations with a few miles and mistakes under their own belt. Gerald also knows a secret about the Melpham phallic idol found in 1912 inside a religious tomb. Should he tell after all these years?

Middleton thinks through many film flashbacks about love and marriage choices that currently seem quite unsatisfactory. His wife, Inge, played by Elizabeth Spriggs (Sense & Sensibility among others) is disgustingly overbearing to the entire family which includes 3 adult children. The children each have their own secret problems making this family situation so quirky that OUR own normal/dysfunctional (there's an oxymoron) families seem quite acceptable.

Even Kate Winslet (Sense & Sensibility; The Holiday; etc.) makes an early screen role appearance, in this case as Caroline Jevington during episode 3.

Reoccurring young love images in the form of Dollie is a constant frustration to Gerald's attempt to accept his current wife and life. There is plenty to be physically seen of Dollie (Tara Fitzgerald-""Jane Eyre"") so this is not 3 episodes for the kids. Fitzgerald also played in the British comedy ""Five Children and It"". That one is also recommended AND one for the children.

This is a much different British story compared to most of the available series presented by BBC and other books turned into miniseries. As a warning for those potentially offended: it contains nudity, sexual situations, and a gay out-of-the-closet affair all blended together with mystery, love, odd-odd family life, and some occasional laugh-out-loud moments.",1328227200,,1990,5.209375
8268042,4,B00180IPPI,"Your decisions throughout your life can bring about much folly, especially if you are self deceived. This is what happened to Gerald Middleton, who must come to terms with all of it, in his career, marriage, family, and the missed opportunity for real passionate love.",1320796800,,268,4.977777777777778
8268043,4,B00180IPPI,"I use this documentary as an introduction to Beowulf.  It's an excellent way to ""show"" them the time period and integrate the humanities.",1219190400,,137,4.956521739130435

Quite a combination that tallies to five stars. There are no subtitles to help with the British accents but they are seldom needed in this set of DVDs.  229 minutes worth the time for British DVD fans.",1214006400,21,2193,5.128851540616247
