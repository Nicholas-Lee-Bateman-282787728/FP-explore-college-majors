8136083,2,B000H2NH56,"I purchased this video, and the companion video, for some ideas for teaching a Back to Health class.  If I didn't practice yoga myself, I wouldn't have known what was going on.  There is no voiceover on these videos.  The instructor just goes through the motions.  No talking, no instructing. I was very disappointed.",1219363200,,317,4.814814814814815
8136084,5,B000H2NH56,Adding the neck and back exercises on this easy-to-follow DVD to my back care regime has really made a difference.  Both my massage therapist and chiropractor recommended yoga as a way to  improve flexibility and strengthen key muscles.  I found out that exercising without corresponding flexibility--e.g. hamstring stretches before running--can exacerbate back problems.  This dvd has short focused sessions for quick results.,1211155200,,427,5.838709677419355
8136085,4,B000H2NH56,"I bought this DVD 2 years ago and have used it faithfully for relief. I have frequent upper back and neck pain, and sometimes lower back as well. I have tried begining yoga classes (I actually injured myself more) and other yoga dvds but none have helped as much as this one has. The routine is quick and when I am faithful and do it regularly I have no pain at all. And when I'm lazy and haven't done it in awhile it still works right away! I love that it's quick and easy to follow. My only complaint is the narrator. Her voice and comments are too 'peppy, go get 'em tiger-esque'.",1208217600,3,583,4.168141592920354
8136086,5,B000H2NH56,"I ordered this DVD because I have chronic back problems and frequent back pain. There are three segments on this DVD: one for the neck and upper back, one for the lower back, and another for overall back relaxation.

Each of the segments does, in fact, relax and help strengthen the back as promised. The yoga practices offered on this DVD helped to alleviate my aches and pains; at the beginning of the practice, I would be tight and in pain, and by the end I would feel very relieved at my my pain's disappearance. Nancy Wile has an encouraging and lighthearted teaching style which makes even beginners like me feel at ease and successful. She suggests modifications for those who cannot quite achieve certain poses, as well. Her voice is soothing, and she explains each pose thoroughly. I recommend this DVD without reservation to anyone who has back pain and is looking for a quick fix that feels great! Three cheers for ""Yoga To Go's Back To Health!""",1170547200,3,956,4.65680473372781
8136087,3,B000H2NH56,"I gave this to my sister.  She has a back problem and I was hoping it would help keep her loose and comfortable.  She hasn't sent me any overwhelming praise about it, so I guess it's ok so far.",1169078400,,193,3.923076923076923
