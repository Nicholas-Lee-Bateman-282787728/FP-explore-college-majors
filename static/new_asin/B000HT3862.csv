2640307,4,B000HT3862,"I just recently bought Flavor Of Love - The Complete Second Season and I really enjoyed it. The show was hella funny especially Sumthin and Buckwild and the extras will crack you up. But there was no Flav Reunion After Show on the Box set, I wonder what's up with that. Other than that, If you just wanna crack up off everybody on that show, this is the show for ya.",1164758400,,366,4.169014084507042
2640308,5,B000HT3862,"Our favorite clock-wearing bachelor, Flavor Flav, is back with 20 more girls vying for his love. Of course there's more lying, back-stabbing & cat-fighting but there's also a porn scandal, the ""defacation"" incident, more celebrity guests, and the return of New York (and her mother). Flav certainly had his hands full of drama (and booty) this time.

Some of the more interesting girls were:

SUMTHIN - The girl who lost control of her ""bodily functions"" during the champagne toast after the first elimination. Boy, did Flav give her the perfect name.

NIBBLZ - The ""happy, well-adjusted girl who really enjoys sex"". For some of the challenges, she used her booty to her advantage (and to Flav's pleasure) but her sexual tactics ultimately killed her chance to win as Flav decided that she wouldn't be a good role model for his kids.

TOASTEE - She earned her nickname as she got ""toasted"" her first night in the mansion. Her attempt to trash Nibblz backfired horribly when Nibblz went to Flav and told him that Toastee did internet porn. Toastee denied it, of course, so Flav did some ""research"" to find out the truth, which he revealed during an elimination ceremony to the shock of everyone.

But here's where the drama gets MUCH deeper.

At the end of the 5th elimination, Flav lines up the remaining girls single file and announces a special guest who will help with the next elimination. Through the door walks New York, who is greeted by shocked expressions and declarations of ""Oh, Hell No!!!"" New York is back in the house (and the competition) and she's brought the drama - cat fights, near fist fights, mind games & tears - to win the love of ""her man"".

Not to mention that New York's mother is back in the mansion and her discontent for Flav is stronger than ever. Altercations between her & Flav start the moment she sets foot in the mansion and carry on to the explosive final episode.

The word on the web is that this will be the final season of Flavor Of Love but there may possibly be a sequel called ""I Love New York"", with you-know-who searching for her one true love out of 20 men.",1161820800,13,2103,4.60427807486631

2640340,5,B000HT3862,"Flavor flave returns late 2006 with season 2 of the series this time with 20 new woman in the house. This season to me is the BEST season. TIFFANY NEW YORK made the flavor of love series, once season 3 came you see why only season 1 and 2 were successful.

Tiffany NEW YORK POLLARD didn't appear until the last disc on the ''Photo shoot to Death'' eps

when she came back she was more cocky, and bolder than ever

would recommend this season to every fan of tiffany pollard and flavor of love series",1362528000,,499,4.231578947368421

2640358,4,B000HT3862,"To start off, i really liked these D.V.D's. It was fun watching the show. I just wish that it was fully uncensored and the reunion show was included.

The product is advertised as uncensored, but some parts are censored. Once, Buckwild said the 's' word and it was bleeped out and all the sexual words were bleeped out. Regularly the 'f' word wasn't censored, but when used as a verb (sexually), it was. You'll see. When Flave showed the rest of the girls the photograph of Toasteee, that was censored, and a few other things were censored. I think everything should have been uncensored...

And what happened to the Reunion? I think that it should have been included, even if that meant waiting a few more months for the D.V.D",1276646400,5,727,4.584615384615384

WHAT HAPPENED VH1?

This is a BIG let down for me.

A lot of other extras but NO REUNION SPECIAL",1230422400,,368,4.373134328358209
2640360,5,B000HT3862,"I never used to care for Flavor Flav and Public Enemy in general, even when i was younger. However, after watching this show it is just almost impossible to not like Flav. He is a real individual, doesn't care what people think about him, and is just a person who enjoys life. This show is irresistable any way you cut it. The female contestants are hilarious, most of them you either root for or want to strangle but they indeed make the show. Even if you're not a reality show fan, whether you are black or white it doesn't matter..Flavor of Love Season 2 is pure magic.",1222992000,,572,4.355140186915888

2640363,3,B000HT3862,"I bought the 2nd season and it was great, I got to the end and was very dissappointed that there was no reunion show, like season 1. which was included. How do you get the reunion show. Without the reunion added to the DVD's it is just not the same.",1207958400,,249,4.0
2640364,5,B000HT3862,"This was the sequel to the successful first season of ""Flavor Of Love"".At the end of the first season Flav picked the one girl he'd thought he found love with,Hoopz. Unfortunately,Things didn't turn out they way he'd planned when she left him at the first season reunion show. This season is back and he's looking even harder to find his woman. He'll go eliminate 19 of the 20 women who showed up at his Los Angeles mansion. He's going to try his hardest to weed out the Wannabe actresses,models,and ""Video Hos"".

This season had a long list of memorable contestants most of whom appeared on the 2007 spin-off show ""Flavor Of Love Girls:Charm School"".

I give the set 4/5 because the reunion show isn't on it. This season isn't as funny or addictive as its first season.&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Flavor-of-Love-The-Complete-First-Season/dp/B000GG4Y0U/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Flavor of Love - The Complete First Season</a>&nbsp;All episodes appear uncensored.

2640366,4,B000HT3862,"He looks crazy, and although I like His wild personality, it's just like Miss New York's show; very Un-Love-like, deceitful, fights galore (Yay!), Crazy Women in line for Someone very ugly and with no rap talent whatsoever, and Who sports the biggest clock a Human could carry.

I find Him quite repulsive save for His fun side. Like I've said before, it's nearly identical to Miss NY's silly show. Both - entertaining. Both - sleazy. Both went home empty-handed on the first season!

And don't EVEN start, cause this is a Black on Black hate crime! X^D

HOWEVER, this is now Season 2 we're dealing with: Basically, the final frame!: NY tries to put Delicious down as much as possible, discouraging her for being there, and overall trying to start a fight and provoking Delicious (which She didn't respond to) to hit her, to be bumped off the show. NY is at her wittiest, her most deceiving and very, friendly in the most unfriendly way that She could possibly be.

And I loved nearly every minute of that! Delicious isn't bad looking and has a very calm and collected spirit, similar to a Earth or Water signs personality. It was very inspiring. And She ends up in the final 2 with NY. Surely, You all know who wins?

If not, get this. It's worth a watch and I guarantee - no matter HOW trashy this show is in Your mind, You will find Yourself watching more than not.

Good Luck with that!!!

Sure, you may have a special place in America's heart, Mr. Perry, and been invited onto Ophra Winfrey's special stage to discuss your plays and movies. But you don't stand a chance against this new (old?) upstart, FLAVA FLAV!!!

And on that regard, speaking of which, it is absolutely amazing to me that this wonderful man has been overlooked by Ophra Winfrey, and not been invited on her show to spread his positive word about the beautiful, warm, African American women on his show and the good word they spread.  They truly are a role model for today's young African American Girl.

With very few exceptions, the women on this show represent the Plymouth of class, style and grace of your typical African American woman, and watching them and enjoying what they share with the entire world to see.  Please exceptions below:

Saaphyri Windsor: what are you, some kind of crack `ho?  How dare you bring down this show, with your classless act of bed stealing!  How dare you ruin my TV viewing evening with your ghetto trash actions!  You were all over that other girl like black on white!  What's up with that?

""Toastee shame on you for bringing down the quality of the programming for posing nude in a porno mag!  How dare you try to bring down the high quality standards of Flava Flav and all the classy ladies on this show?
