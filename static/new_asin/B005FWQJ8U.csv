4686156,5,B005FWQJ8U,Great anime movie.  Fun and fast paced.  Great for the whole family.,1425427200,,68,4.583333333333333
4686157,5,B005FWQJ8U,"This anime movie is a visual feast!  The colors, the characters, the places were wonderful!  As with many anime, there is some meaning lost in translation.  I would have preferred an option for subs not dubs because reading the text at the bottom doesn't detract from the film for everyone.  The dramatic speeches make more sense in Japanese!  Other than that, it was original and creative but still left a lot for the imagination to fill in.  Awesome!",1424390400,,452,4.730769230769231
4686158,4,B005FWQJ8U,"This is truthfully a better film than I expected.  It's a fascinating merger of a number of differing visual styles, from a Ghibli-esque opening in Japan to wildly colorful (if physically impossible) party scenes in space.  The story is interesting if a bit predictable.  Lots of fun and reasonably suitable for pre-teens and teenagers.",1422835200,,336,5.185185185185185
4686159,4,B005FWQJ8U,"Dazzling animation, and a positive theme about working together and not giving up. A group of students rescues an injured animal who insists he is not a dog. He takes them on a trip to the Moon, and even further, where they have an amazing adventure.",1421193600,,250,4.456521739130435
4686160,5,B005FWQJ8U,"pretty amazing. kinda heavy, might make real young kids cry. no real violence, good animation, mild foul language, no real adult subject matter aside from the context. I would say as a parent watch this first to make sure your kids can handle it if they are under 7.",1416614400,15,266,4.448979591836735
4686161,3,B005FWQJ8U,"""Welcome to the Space Show"" is a cute anime film that deals with school children who rescue a dying dog they find in the field. The dog is nursed back to health and soon reveals himself to be not a dog but an alien staying in Earth studying samples. As a reward for their kindness he offers to do something nice for the kids which begins their adventures in space.

The film is visually a treat filled with bright colors, lots of strange creatures and lots if exciting places. The film is family friendly and should entertain most kids. The film is a bit long at over 2 hours and it does suffer from pacing issues but overall I enjoyed this film.

GKids have put together a fairly standard package with English and Japanese audio tracks. Subtitles come in both English subtitles and English subtitles for those who are deaf. Extras are minimal with Miguel trailers for the film and previews for other releases by GKids.",1416182400,11,919,4.530120481927711
4686162,5,B005FWQJ8U,"Welcome to the Space Show has a special charm to it that's sure to please all anime fans.  It's just a crazy ride with breathtaking visuals that's one of the most imaginative sci-fi adventures that I've ever seen.  I first saw Welcome to the Space Show in Japanese, and I'm glad to finally own it on Blu-Ray.  It's by far one of my favorite anime movies that I've ever seen.  The animation just looks amazing, and has a unique feel to it.  The bottom line is If you like Wolf Children, and Summer Wars then you will love Welcome to the Space Show.

Special Features: Interview with Director Koji Masunari, Interview with Character Designer, From Storyboard to Film, Trailers, TV Spots.  Also, includes an Blu-Ray exclusive 90-minute behind-the-scenes film.

4686181,5,B005FWQJ8U,"This is a GREAT MOVIE. Imagine a combination of E.T., Explorers (the 1985 SF comedy with River Phoenix and Ethan Hawke), Spirited Away, and even a few movies for older viewers like Close Encounters of the Third Kind and Titan AE, put a little more Japanese accent on it, and brighten up the colors. Now, throw in some kids ranging in age from about seven years old to 16 years old. Finish the ensemble by throwing in an alien who is a slightly  unreliable narrator, then drop them into a situation that sends them across the Galaxy at speeds faster than light . How are they getting home by the time their summer vacation ends, and solve the mystery at the core of this story at the same time? This movie takes two hours and 15 minutes to answer those questions, but the length of the movie is justified because there is almost no waste in the writing or direction. The world within the movie is well defined , with money, jobs, technology , science all clearly explained. Because this movie is designed for Y7 viewers, there is almost no intense violence , but older kids and adults will not be bored. And even the English dub is pretty good  A rarity for anime. As I've stated, the movie is very long , which is practically it's only bad point . For that reason, I give it 9.9/10.",1471651200,,1282,4.382352941176471

4686301,3,B005FWQJ8U,"I expected more. Visually the show is nice looking and has good production values. However, it still lacks a sense of wonder or originality to it both visually and story wise. I can still watch the anime Spirited Away and feel that sense of wonder and originality partly because of the sometimes weirdness and grotesqueness of some of the characters like the witch and some of the ugly and strange spirits that contrasted with the beauty of some of the other characters and setting. Welcome to the Space Show has none of that, visually its kind of safe. Sure its visuals are detailed and a lot of effort went into it, but still safe. Story wise its a bit of a mess as it seems to be trying to do several things at once while attempting to be a family film. The music kind of had its ups and downs as well, sometimes good and other times feeling uninspired. I expected a little more excitement in this adventure, but it never really made me feel that way. I usually crave for Japanese anime movies to be a little longer, but in this case I felt that this movie dragged a bit. I think its still nice enough and cute enough that many viewers will still be able to enjoy it, but if you are turned off by a plot that at times gets a little confused or drags then you may not get as much out of it.",1442102400,,1292,4.213709677419355

4686328,2,B005FWQJ8U,"Wow, so disappointing. It is kinda like watching the animated Little Nemo movie; the animation is great but somehow undercuts the story and the child friendly factor is shooting past Disney levels and into Nick Jr territory. Your kids will remember it as a magical adventure that they will fill with supposition as to its importance later in life. But if you are a college age anime fan you should take this as an opportunity to support post-Miyazaki family anime more that its own intriguing thrill.",1440288000,,500,4.825581395348837

4686358,4,B005FWQJ8U,"On the Amazon app for PS3, this movie is listed with ""Family"" as a category.  It's not exactly a ""Family"" film.  It might be more appropriate for 12+, but could be suitable younger ages if the parent wishes to explain questions from their children or is positive about their influence being stronger than the whimsical depictions of drug use (aliens get high on the Japanese karashi plant), brief, comical nudity, and a focus on the clothed, underage, female, booty shots of the protagonist.  I watched it with my son and explained the things that needed to be talked about, but I probably wouldn't have shown it if I'd viewed it beforehand.  The plot and characters are pretty good, the action is cool, the plot holes are few, and the target audience are Japanese children; Western tastes will likely differ regarding the content.",1434412800,3,831,4.830985915492958

4686370,4,B005FWQJ8U,"Cute movie.  As others have said, the space aliens are very creative, and the animation, particularly in some of the space sequences, is really unique and visually stimulating.  Story has some issues but nothing I couldn't overlook.  It's a long movie and has some VERY slow sequences that I could have done without.  All in all, a fun couple hours.",1429315200,,349,4.766666666666667
4686371,4,B005FWQJ8U,"Welcome to the Space Show is a wild, sometimes hilarious, sometimes serious, sometimes perplexing adventure through space. At times it seems to take its inspiration from the Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy, at other times from more traditional animes with evil genius villains and climactic (energy) sword fights. All in all the majority of the film is a feast for the eyes and the soul, and when you watch you'll feel yourself a part of the group of kids, taking in stride crystal french fries, alien babies, and space dragon trains along with them, wondering why you and they haven't just collapsed under the sheer volume of incomprehensibility; but like the kids, you'll find yourself going along for the ride, enjoying through them all their fun, silly adventures. The underlying plot for the show is complex and not really given the screen time it deserves, so anyone not paying attention will probably miss it completely, and people trying to follow it and figure it out may be a bit frustrated by the end. On the other hand it almost seems like the creators wanted you to not pay a lot of attention to the plot; but if that is so it seems like it should have played a more minor role in the film. Still, although sometimes long and perplexing, this is a ride that is certainly worth the price of admission.",1428969600,7,1314,4.668103448275862

This is a mix--some of the sweetness of Studio Ghibli and similar artistry at some points mixed in with some riffs of Lilo and Stitch, Summer Wars, and Yellow Submarine with a goofiness all of its own that works for both adults and kids.

4686395,3,B005FWQJ8U,"Although visually gorgeous throughout, the story at times seems like it was written and directed by seven-year-olds. That's both good and bad: Space Show is simultaneously wonderfully imaginative and utterly implausible. A lot of the plot points seem completely random as well. I almost decided that it was all intentional, and that it was supposed to seem like a dream, but I think that may be giving the writers too much credit.

There are a few emotionally poignant moments buried in here but the weird story almost drowns them out.",1425859200,,535,4.944444444444445

8470757,4,B005FWQJ8U,"On the one hand this is the rousing story of five Japanese grade school students who rise to the occasion; on the other hand the basic plot premise makes no sense at all.

Natsuki, Amane, Kiyoshi, Noriko, and Koji all gather at their school during summer vacation for an apparent annual summer event, spending the week there alone (and doing some homework) under the watchful eyes of Kiyoshi, their eldest, but this event is interrupted by their rescue and treatment of a ""dog"" that turns out to be a space alien, Pochi.  In order to thank them for saving his life, Pochi offers the kids a trip to the moon, and the hidden alien city on the far side, where things quickly get out of hand.  With travel directly back to Earth apparently banned due to the nature of Pochi's report on wasabi smuggling, the kids are faced with a twenty year return trip to Earth instead of the seven days they have until their parents return for them, but if they can manage to earn enough money to buy tickets on a super fast travel method to Pochi's home planet, they can possibly make it back in time.  Unfortunately, doing so exposes their existence to the wasabi smugglers, and before they can possibly go home they will see strange new sights, meet strange new friends, and battle for their lives.

If only it made any sense....

It isn't just that the main villains' premise doesn't make any sense, either voiced in English or Japanese with subtitles, but literally none of the rest of the plot complications do either.  Fortunately, the one thing that DOES make sense is the kids having to risk it all in order to save one of their own, despite dangers they cannot even anticipate.  I just think the filmmakers owed us an explanation afterward!",1487030400,,1732,4.58252427184466
