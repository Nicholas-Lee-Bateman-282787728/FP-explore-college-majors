3916458,5,B002EAYDZ2,"Pretty good story of the life of screen legend George Raft(Ray Danton)From his days as a dancer in a gangster run nightclub during Prohibition,to the Hollywood years and his affair with Betty Grable(Jayne Mansfield)Bettys name is not,of course used,His slow 1950s decline,his involment with gangster Bugsy Siegal(Brad Dexter),his years in Cuba till the takeover by Castro,and his comeback in Some Like It Hot.
Its got its share of mistakes,George didn't leave Betty because of his mothers death,George being a devote Catholic couldn't marry her because he had been married years before.
Still,it isn't a real bad movie.",1322092800,3,619,5.391752577319588

3916460,4,B002EAYDZ2,"Jayne Mansfield is not the key character in this movie, it's Ray Danton! Danton Plays George Raft and how he aspired to be a romantic lead in films but was typecast in the gangster type role. Along With Jayne Mansfield who plays Raft's love interest Betty Grable, are Julie London, Barrie Chase and Barbara Nichols. Julie London Graces us with a couple of sultry songs, Barbara Nichols shakes her fanny as Texas Guinan. Nichols wears the black low back Orry Kelly Designed gown made for Marilyn Monroe in Some Like It Hot. This is a soaper, overly dramatic, but lots of fun! Jayne Camps it up big time, playing a first class Bitch to Raft, and can barely breathe in her too tight dresses. This film is fun, enjoy it, it's a rarity! You even get to see a young Frank Gorshin pre Bat-Man tv series the riddler!",1290038400,5,808,4.466216216216216
3916461,1,B002EAYDZ2,I just recieved this as a gift and I'm a hugh Jayne Mansfield fan and it was aweful.  Not only did the DVD not play properly but the movie is so bad I had to return it.  It's was so painful to watch.  Even a Jayne Mansfield fan has to admit her acting is beyond terrible in the movie.,1256601600,4,284,3.7796610169491527

8367099,1,B002EAYDZ2,"An inaccurate, insensitive portrait of one of Hollywood's most talented, sensitive, but insecure legends. Incidentally, Ray Danton at 6-feet tall, was terribly miscast as Raft who may have been no taller than 5' 7"". And Jayne Mansfield was an even worse choice for Mae West who, surprisingly, was a tiny five-feet-even.

8367100,2,B002EAYDZ2,"George Raft (1901-80) is best known for his gangster roles in films like ""Scarface"" (1932), ""Each Dawn I Die"" (1939) and ""Some Like it Hot"" (1959), but he was far more versatile and in many of his films he played a dancer or a musician (""Winner Take All"",  ""Bolero"", ""Limehouse Blues"") or his role was primarily comedic (""Night after Night"", ""Every Night at Eight"").

Ray Danton (1931-92) plays Raft. Danton is most famous for ""The Rise and Fall of Legs Diamond"" (1960). Her won the Golden Globe as ""most promising newcomer"" in 1956 and had a busy career in TV and films. His performance here is merely OK.

Buxomy Jayne Mansfield (1933-67) plays Raft's love interest, a role patterned on Betty Grable. Mansfield was a major sex symbol of the 50s, second only to Marilyn Monroe. Soon after this film Mansfield went overseas where she made a series of low budget films.

Sultry Julie London (1926-2000) was a singer (""Cry me a River"", ""Blue Moon"") known primarily for her TV work (""Emergency""). This was the last of her 20 films.

Frank Gorshin (1933-2005) plays Raft's friend, Mack Gray. Gorshin was one of the finest impressionists ever, though he is probably best remembered for his role as The Riddler in the Batman TV series.

Rubber faced comedian Robert Strauss (1913-75) plays a gangster. Strauss is best remembered for his Oscar nominated role as ""Animal"" in ""Stalag 17"" (1953)

Herschel Bernardi (1923-86) plays Raft's agent. Bernardi was a stage and film actor best remembered for his Emmy nominated role in ""Peter Gunn"".

Pock faced, tough Neville Brand (1920-92) puts in a cameo as Al Capone, Brand was a war hero turned movie actor who gave us excellent performances in more than 100 films and TV appearances, often as the heavy. He played Al Capone several times (""The Scarface Mob"", ""Alcatraz Express"", and on TV's ""The Untouchables""), but his very best performance, and one of the all time greatest performances, was as ""Joe Brothers"" in a ""Naked City"" (1962) episode entitled ""Lament for a Dead Indian"".

1961 was an OK year for films. The top grossing films included ""101 Dalmations"", ""West Side Story"", ""The Guns of Navarone"", ""El Cid"", and ""Splendor in the Grass"".  The big Oscar winner was ""West Side Story"" (Picture, Director, Supporting Actor and Actress). Maximillian Schell won an Oscar and a Golden Globe for ""Judgment at Nuremberg"". Other notable films included ""The Hustler"", ""Through a Glass Darkly"", and the best samurai film ever made - ""Yojimbo"".

The NY Times call the film ""interesting"", which is really all you can say for it, apart from a number of good dancing and musical numbers. Also, there is a good Martin & Lewis comedy team, Tony Reese and Pepper Davis, who are hilarious.

What disappoints me most in the film is the failure to deal with Raft's poor career choices. He was said to have turned down the starring roles in ""High Sierra"", ""The Maltese Falcon"" and ""Casablanca"", roles that took Bogart from the second string to the A list.

Bottom line - a cursory look at the career of George Raft",1368921600,5,3038,4.819230769230769
8367101,2,B002EAYDZ2,"I was not a big fan of george raft films but oddly know him from a few films he made with other larger stars
from the 30's and 40's and given things we know of him i find it interesting his casting late in his career in the edward g robinson film(1955) a bullett for joey. He's more of an interest now largely for the kind of life he led rather than the films he made since after a brief rise to great stardom in the 1930's for some reason (which only he himself knows)he was offered by warners the chance to work with some of the best directors and writers like john huston and work in the best films...but turned them down and the films went to other stars and became big hits...and the films he did make were lacklustre and by the early to mid 40's he was on a downward spiral and career was in the dumps. It could be if he had the chance to make those films he would not have developed into a big star in the 40's anyways,audiences just took to other others,the mix of star to film and success as it translates into critical and box office success is a mystery. Its movie magic! Perhaps he didn't have the magnetism and appeal to move from the gangster films to the more complex films of the early 40's and turned them down...but anyways this is a theme of the movie and it spends time here his decline as an actor and popular star in the 40's...there is much here his meetings with al capone and other notorious figures of the 30's,a murder of a hollywood associate,his early rise from dancer to hollywood. What i found most interesting is his early struggle,in new york,and his attraction for the most desirable woman...and how he never really rose in the gangster world of new york but was cast out there as well...for whatever reason. The film ends (and it plays like a b film)with his casting in Some like it hot(1959)
but there was no comeback...he was famous in the 30's and fell fast and he always seemed bewildered by having people look on him as a gangster...however he was never well accepted there either and the frosty meetings with capone,the years of loneliness in hotels and lacklustre personal life are all too telling! He was shattered by his mother's death,an event which tells us much,that relationship may have been the foundation which held him together,and he found himself using his influence in various ways throughout his life. The film really shys away from the way he used his ties,and really doesnt examine at all the world of that time. I recall a funny episode years ago in a star trek episode ""a piece of the action"" be gene coon and davisd harmon,which was a send up of the gangster life of chicago with old books like a bible and a code,,,which was quite funny...youll learn more there than here...Raft was never really a happy person,and very often people shattered by a mother's death don't build up good personal family connections on their own...the solitude of later years...that's the most interesting part of this film as the solitude is a very eerie and modern feeling we all feel today though we all have relations of some sort given the independence mania the values of life are rather self subsisting,like the character here depicted....",1335225600,3,3186,4.523396880415945
