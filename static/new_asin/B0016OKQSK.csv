3162292,5,B0016OKQSK,"Three cheers to the History channel for their outstanding documentary film on the CIA's clandestine airline, Air America.
From the days of Korea to the end of the Vietnam War, CAT and Air America flew the skies of Asia in the defense of freedom.
It's all true and very well presented in this History channel documentary film.  Jesse Walton",1245715200,6,339,4.745762711864407

8263719,5,B0016OKQSK,Excellent series with in-depth first person interviews. Highly Recommended!!!!!,1454025600,,79,7.888888888888889
8263720,4,B0016OKQSK,"This History channel special on CAT and Air America and their operations in Laos, Thailand, Cambodia and Vietnam, provides a good introduction to a major component of American (clandestine) foreign policy in Southeast Asia during the Cold War.  Since it was an operation carried out by the CIA much of this information has been slow in filtering since the U.S. withdrawal from Vietnam in 1975.  However, Air America and its operations were a major component of America's foreign policy efforts in SE Asia in the Cold War period.  This video provides a good starting point for academic research into the CAT/Air America/Hmong involvment/Plain of Jars/Interdiction efforts in the Ho Chi Minh Trail. etc.",1425427200,,701,5.185840707964601
8263721,5,B0016OKQSK,This is the REAL story of Air America. Fascinating.,1407110400,,51,4.777777777777778

8263723,5,B0016OKQSK,An good viedeo on the type of activities AAM Pilots were doing in Vietnam and Laos from the 1960's to 1975.,1402185600,,107,4.142857142857143
8263724,4,B0016OKQSK,"While this documentary recalls the heroic deeds of the pilots involved, it neglects to tell the story of how
we got involved in a war 10,000 miles from our shore. Specifically, it doesn't deal with war-hawk, Texas hick
president LBJ and his Pentagon buddies in faking an incident in the Gulf of Tonkin to justify bombing and invading a country
that never attacked us. As a result of LBJ's misadventure, 58,000 American soldiers were slaughtered and hundreds
of billions in taxpayer money was wasted.",1378684800,,499,4.9523809523809526
8263725,5,B0016OKQSK,"The helicopter you see atop the building in Saigon is non other than Air America evacuating in the face of oncoming NVA.  The U.S. Forces left the job to Air America who's motto is, Anything, Anytime, Anywhere"".  I think that says it all.",1365033600,4,238,4.511627906976744
8263726,5,B0016OKQSK,"This is a great story by the History Channel, with well done narration and some really good footage of the secret war in Laos.  The narrator has a connection to one of the pilots which makes the story much more moving. They show a short clip of Edgar ""Pop"" Buell in the mountains of Laos without explaining who he was or what he did, but one hour is too short to do everything. The whole story of the CIA proprietary airline is very complex but they did a good job of condensing it. I really liked seeing the aircraft. Many viewers will be surprised that the iconic photo of the evacuation of Saigon, in  the final days of the Vietnam war, was not at the US embassy and was an Air America Huey.  If you like this video, read ""Shooting at the Moon"" by Roger Warner.",1328054400,2,764,4.219178082191781
8263727,5,B0016OKQSK,"As an Air America pilot for 8 years from 1965 to 1973 in Saigon and then in Udorn Thailand while flying in Laos,I can say this is an outstanding and accurate history of many of the missions flown during the war in South East Asia. Nothing will ever tell all of the many ""quiet"" missions flown for the United States of America by Air America and CAT but this CD is the best.",1246320000,12,373,4.123287671232877
8263728,5,B0016OKQSK,"Monty Markham, who made this film, got it right because his brother was an Air America pilot and knew the inside story.  The CIA just honored Air America, at the University of Texas at Dallas, for their service in Laos and Vietnam.  This film presents the facts. The truth is long overdue.  Judy Porter
