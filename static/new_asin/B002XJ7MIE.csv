8383749,4,B002XJ7MIE,"Just finished watching the 2 DVD's (both come in 1 package).  Steve Briere does a nice job putting it all together, from unpacking your equipment and getting dressed to on-ice skills to off-ice training as well as a video about the mental part of the position.  I especially liked the various camera angles demonstrating the saves and drills.  So often, you will see a video demonstration filmed head-on, from the shooter's perspective, but as a goalie, it's also very helpful to see other angles (e.g., skate positioning).  Steve's facility is impressive, too.  It's great to see a facility focused on goaltending.  After having watched these DVD's, I'm wanting to make a trip to Alabama to do some training there (who knows, maybe one day)...  If you're looking for a no-nonsense approach to specific saves and skills as well as putting them all together, and the off-ice aspects, I recommend these DVD's.",1269043200,,907,4.966887417218543
8383750,4,B002XJ7MIE,"""The Complete Game"" is a truly all encompassing DVD for goaltenders, covering everything from getting dressed to the mental aspect of the game. This DVD is enhanced by the introduction to Steve Briere and Justin Johnson, both NCAA Div I coaches and former Professional Goaltenders. It is extremely easy to navigate through this DVD as it is laid out in the natural progression of a Goaltender.",1258416000,2,393,4.96969696969697
