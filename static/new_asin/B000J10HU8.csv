2665806,3,B000J10HU8,Average 1930s B-Western....I am a Randolph Scott fan-so I enjoyed it,1410048000,,68,5.2727272727272725
2665807,5,B000J10HU8,"As westerns go this is a fairly good one. Randolph Scott is the a typical western hero. He saves the day as always. If you're like me and enjoy westerns, where the good guys wore white hats and the bad guys wore black hats. Then this movie is for you. Enjoy it. Almost everyone who played in westerns is in it. Some of my all time favorites appear in this one.
Andy Devine, Brian Donlevy, George Marshall, Henry Hathaway, Broderick Crawford, and last but not least the lovely Kay Francis. United artist really went all out on this one.",1270252800,9,535,4.414141414141414
2665808,1,B000J10HU8,"As a fan of the western genre, I had no problem with the acting and plot line as they are typical of 1930's era films.  That said, this is probably the worst tape to DVD transfer I've ever seen.  Saturday morning TV presentations weren't this bad.  Stay away from this film in it's current form (Alpha Home Entertainment ALP 5205D distributed by [...]).  It's almost unwatchable.",1250985600,29,379,4.696969696969697

8148614,5,B000J10HU8,A very old movie. Randolph Scott was very young but this was a fun watch. Don't expect it to be todays quality since this movie is one of his first. It's clear and the sound was great. It's a must for any true Randolph Scott fan. It's every bit as good as John Wayne's first movies.,1501459200,,282,4.053571428571429
8148615,3,B000J10HU8,"WHEN THE WEST WAS YOUNG (1932), originally ""Heritage of the Desert,""
is a Paramount production shot on the company's ranch in Agoura.

Originally by Zane Grey, this Utah set story, as delimned by director Henry
Hathaway, has the clich&eacute; western plot devices: rustling, a land grab,
galloping gangs, a showdown, etc. At least Randy Scott is nice to look at.

Also with Sally Blane, J. Farrell MacDonald, ""Big Boy"" Williams
and other familiar stock players. As of 5/17 it's rated 5.8 at IMDb.

Another PARAMOUNT adapted Zane Grey novel that's directed by Charles Barton
 (he later worked extensively with Abbott & Costello), THE FIGHTING WESTERNER
 (originally ""Rocky Mountain Mystery"") is a low-budget programmer that effectively
combines the western and who-dun-it genres and offers a few casting surprises,
namely Ann Sheridan and Randolph Scott at the beginning of their careers.
Also appearing is 19th Century stage actress Mrs. Leslie Carter as the family matriarch.

THE STORY--
A mining engineer (Scott) investigating the mysterious disappearance of his brother-in-law
 joins forces with a crusty deputy sheriff (Sale) who is himself looking into the murder of
a mine owner. When two more people die, all the suspects have alibis.

In 1936, Randy Scott starred as ""Hawkeye"" in an excellent version
