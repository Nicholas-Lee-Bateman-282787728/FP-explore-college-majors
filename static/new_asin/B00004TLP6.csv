8385555,4,B00004TLP6,"This is a wonderful, relaxing DVD. Scriptures are given with the sounds of soothing waves in the background. The beautiful locations used for this video are outstanding. The only thing that I would change is the seagull sounds....I get really relaxed and then the seagull sounds kind of break that rythmic sound of the ocean waves. I like to go to sleep to this DVD!! Highly recommended!!! A+++++",1079049600,,396,4.838235294117647
8385556,1,B00004TLP6,The ocean scenes and sounds are fine. However there too many breaks in the tape with words slowly scrolling across a black screen. What is worst is that during the tape they give their website! Not my idea of relaxation. Waste of $.,1063929600,3,232,4.4186046511627906
8385557,5,B00004TLP6,"I love to lay back in my favorite chair with a good book, play my favorite Enya CDs and have ""Inspiring Moments"" play on my DVD.  Suddenly, I am transported to my own private Hawaiian beach.  The soothing rhythm of the surf blends nicely with my CDs drowning out the traffic and children outside.  It's nice to glance up turning a pageand enjoy a lovely sunset and the shimering golden waves on my TV.
There are six 11 minute Day segments ending in sunsets and well themed.  Starting with Faith, Courage, Hope, Commitment, Peace and ending in Love, the waves change from large California waves to lapping Hawaiian waves.  If you don't like quotes try the original series: Hawaiian Dreams, Hawaiian Zen, Californian Dreams, Californian Zen.  They're all wonderful and make great gifts for people- especially anyone who is hospitalized, sick, grieving or in emotional pain.  It's a sure way to cheer them up and help them relax naturally.",1022284800,2,936,4.849056603773585
8385558,5,B00004TLP6,"It's a rare tape that truly inspires one. But this video taps into my love of nature and inspirational thoughts. No matter how chaotic my day is, I can sit back and watch Waves for a few minutes and relax! I highly recommend this lovely gift to anyone.",983577600,2,252,4.270833333333333
8385559,5,B00004TLP6,"I love all the Waves videos. Hours of continuous peace. We never thought we'd feel it again! As a care-giver for my handicap dad, these tapes are our salvation. Powerful real medicine. Fastest way to distract him from  pain without using meds. Quick way for mom and me to meditate, relax or  escape. For anyone these tapes are the ultimate stress reducer with  immediate results. Instant mood altering for ones whole environment, giving  hours of peace whether you are sitting in front of it or not! Any of these  videos are a good investment, and gift especially for those on limited  budgets."" - Ms. Gail Cunningham, Lake Grove, OR.",961027200,4,634,4.770642201834862
