8611763,4,B00F2O1LLQ,"The Buffalo King represents a love for the preservation of the Buffalo from one man who could see what the future would be of this magnificent animal if he did not do something to try to preserve and protect the Buffalo from certain extinction. The  documentary has
clear video images, easy to understand audio, and is a accurate historic documentation.",1383350400,3,353,4.883333333333334
8611764,5,B00F2O1LLQ,"You must see this documentary. It covers a huge swath of historical perspective about our recent past in just one hour. I saw it first hand at the Days of 76 Museum in Deadwood SD along with 100 or so others and also present was one of the producers Justin Koehler. Awesome piece of work to say the least!

Viewing this film begs the question,what were we thinking? What manner of Manifest Destiny entitlement mindset led us European colonizers to slaughter millions and millions(50 to 60 million by some accounts) of native animals that were here for millennia before us? The Native indigenous tribes lived and thrived on buffalo, and us  colonizers failed to  recognize and respect a way of life dependent on the land and animals that sustained them for tens of thousands of years. Thankfully a few men and women  like Scotty Phillip and his wife(who was native American)did and by their efforts made a difference for all of us today.

 Thankfully a few people in every generation see what's happening and try to do something positive for future generations. The life and story of Scotty Phillip makes one ask themselves this question. In the light of historical retrospect, given the time,place,and cultural clashes between great plains Indian tribes, the buffalo,the insatiable demand for ownership and control of the newly discovered frontier land mass....what would we do?
