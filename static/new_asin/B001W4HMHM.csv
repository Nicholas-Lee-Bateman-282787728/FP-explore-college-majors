8346921,2,B001W4HMHM,"I was hoping to see the film but it's only a documentary showing bits and pieces of some other film (scenes of XVIII century England and of Sideny cove), no mention of Botany bay. Interviews and comments. Boring",1319760000,,211,4.578947368421052
8346922,5,B001W4HMHM,I really enjoyed this.  I like that it follows 3 women tracing their ancestors and they act out what happened.  Also they have actual court records that are interesting too.  This is an Austrailian DVD and is made for foreign DVD players HOWEVER it does work in my DVD player which is USA.  Weird.  It's misleading and I would hate someone to not get it thinking it wouldn't work in their DVD player.  It just might! Enjoy!,1245110400,,423,4.428571428571429
