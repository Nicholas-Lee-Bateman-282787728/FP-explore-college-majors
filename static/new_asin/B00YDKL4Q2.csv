7213306,5,B00YDKL4Q2,"I just love this series. It's special. There are a lot of great action series out there but this one stands out. Unfotunately, recent events around the globe give it a pretty terrifying edge. Same goes for Homeland. Production values are still excellent and give this series a cinematic feel. The characters are well developed. I won't rate the individual episodes. The fans know what they are in for. Highly recommended to all who are looking for an exciting, gripping well acted thriller/action series with an edge and have not yet discovered Strike Back. The mentioned production values look great on blu ray. You get a picture quality reminding of Michael Bay pictures. Sound is really great for a television series. You'll definitely enjoy this in your home cinema.",1479254400,,770,4.976744186046512

8718189,4,B00YDKL4Q2,"Wow, what a difference a season makes.  If there was an unofficial tag line for the first season of this show it might have been: Come for the gratuitous sex and nudity and stay for the extreme violence. Strike Back offered an interesting premise when it debuted and I bought the first two seasons when they came out on DVD not knowing much about it.  Season 1 didn't impress me much; in my review I called it preposterous and silly.  So, given that experience I let Season 2 sit on the shelf.  Fast forward to today I finally decided to give the sophomore season a shot and what do you know, its so much better!  We find our boys from British secret operations Section 20 in South Africa chasing stolen nuclear triggers.  SAS Sgt Michael Stonebridge (Philip Winchester) and American ex-Spec Ops Sgt Damien Scott (Sullivan Stapleton) are hot on the case.
  Showrunners and writers have stepped up their game; the plot is better and more logical.  Things move along at a clip reminiscent of the old 24 series.  Also theyve dialed back the excess sex & nudity and while Scott still hooks up with one hottie nearly every episode its limited to that unlike the 2-3 encounters he had in Season 1.  More remarkably as we move towards the end they dispense with the naked babes almost entirely and focus on the story.  Another improvement is theyve got a villain this time around who frankly is as sinister as any recent Bond nemesis and a whole lot more believable.

  Adding Rhona Mitra as the Section 20 new commander Maj Rachel Dalton works for me (recently seen in The Last Ship also playing someone named Rachel).  The action is first rate with Stonebridge and Scott having the latest and greatest weapons and clearly having received training in how to use them.  These guys actually use fire and movement tactics, communicate when they change mags, collect ammo and weapons from downed adversaries like real soldiers would.  Scott pulls QuickClot out in one scene to treat a wounded man- something hed surely have as part of his EDC.

  Its not all perfect, our boys occasionally make goofy errors like Scott letting a sexy Mossad agent plant a post-coital tracking device on him.  Or later on Stonebridge abandons a scientist they just rescued in the middle of a foot chase to go after some other guy he has a vendetta against that conveniently drives by.  Also, the lads are practically bullet-proof, theres an ambush at a soccer stadium where their little Toyota sedan is riddled with a virtual hail of automatic weapons fire and they survive without a scratch, heck the tires didn't even deflate.  Product placement for Ray Ban sunglasses gets to be distracting, almost everyone good guys or bad, night or day is wearing them- there are other brands available so what are the odds theyd all have those?  Scotts a former Delta guy and they love their Oakleys!

  The plot stays on track for the most part (aside from some characters who seem to get left by the wayside like the villains daughter) and the story comes to an exciting conclusion.  Strike Back is not a sentimental show and we lose at least one major and one recurring character along the way; but hey, danger is their business.  In summary Season 2 of Strike Back is redemptive and if you can get past the frequent profanity and aforementioned R-rated material its recommended for adrenaline junkies.  Ive ordered Season 3 and am looking forward to watching.",1495584000,,3425,4.705882352941177
8718190,5,B00YDKL4Q2,"Excellent show, contemporary time frame, graphis sex, spectacular gunfights with lots of blood spatter, plausible bad guys, kung-fu, krav-fu, maga-fu.  Surprise is that the slovenly, smartass American is played by a buttoned-up sort of a Brit and the SAS Churchillian Brit is played by a 'merican.  Best viewed at full volume, in a man cave.",1489622400,,341,5.181818181818182
