7952035,5,B00005R86Y,"Standard Deviants by its nature will not please everyone. The cornball humor limits the audience significantly. That said, I highly recommend this video for young visual learners. The content is certainly not leftist (whatever that content free phrase might mean) and surprisingly balanced.",1271030400,7,290,5.767441860465116
7952036,1,B00005R86Y,"This was at first a basic lesson in Civics for kids to learn about governmental structure and how we broke down the inception of the Constitution till the makers of this DVD decided to inject their LEFTEST IDEAOLOGY into it.

What could have been a great tool for many different educators to teach the workings of American Government became a politically bias message delivery system. Who project their pro-gay agenda and their false concepts of a ""living Constitution"" instead of the actual facts that only Amendments can, in fact change, the CONSTITUTION.

It was a waste of money and time...It was however a complete statement on the sad state of affairs in the American School System.

Too bad they couldn't stick to the essentials and provide a good educational tool like their math DVD's which didn't contain political statements,just facts.",1247529600,8,847,5.035714285714286
7952037,5,B00005R86Y,This is a delightful if somewhat corny way to entertainingly review civics.  Some students are visual learners as opposed to aural or kinesthetic; This would be a great review for them.,1240963200,2,185,4.967741935483871
7952038,1,B00005R86Y,"As a teacher, I purchased this video.  It is a real dud and does not present concepts from an interesting enough platform.  Needs to be longer and go slower, presenting each concept in a more practical and interesting way.  I am so sorry to bash this product but it stinks.",1229472000,4,273,4.42
