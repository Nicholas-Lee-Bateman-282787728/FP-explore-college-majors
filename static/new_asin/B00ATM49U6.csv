amazing and energetic.",1479513600,,230,4.634146341463414
8557627,5,B00ATM49U6,"If you're already a U.S. fan of Kyary Pamyu Pamyu, you're way-way ahead of the curve.  No doubt you'll want this DVD, which contains the entire November 6, 2012 performance at Nippon Budokan.  I recommend the 2 DVD limited edition for the additional behind-the-scenes material, if you don't opt for the higher resolution BluRay edition.  The DVD version actually looks pretty good.

It's all in Japanese.  There are no subtitles, which would certainly be nice, but if you're taken with the music and the performer you probably won't care.  You can find all of the lyrics online in Japanese, Romaji, and English  at Kyarychan.com.

Note that I'm not a Verified Purchase reviewer on this one.  That's because I ordered direct from Japan, through CDJapan.  I would have greatly preferred to use Amazon, which is almost always my first choice for both price and convenience, but at present their sellers only seem to have Region 2 DVDs which WON'T play on standard Region 1 U.S. equipment.  CDJapan offers a REGION FREE Limited Edition, which will play on any DVD player.

I keep wondering when this strange little girl will suddenly be noticed by U.S. audiences.  She's certainly registering elsewhere.  Her music videos are totally upbeat--a real breath of fresh air.  Check out ""Kyary Pamyu Pamyu - AN"" on YouTube, or ""Invader Invader,"" in which she announces her plan to take over the world.  Either you'll get it or you won't.",1375747200,9,1427,4.907949790794979
8557628,5,B00ATM49U6,Video of live shows can sometimes sound or look bad this one keeps the quality high. My only problem with the production was that it has a lot of quick cuts between performers I wish it would just stay on one performer for more than 30 seconds.,1373068800,2,244,4.212765957446808
