Don't know if this was taken with a home video recorder, but whoever did it, did not improve on the quality at all. I've seen youtube videos of even earlier programs, and none of them looked this bad. I guess you get what you pay for. The price was low, but the quality was even lower.",1363737600,,431,4.204819277108434
