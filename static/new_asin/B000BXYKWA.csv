2445428,5,B000BXYKWA,"This workout is lead by Cathe Friedrich, an instructor known for her advanced workouts.  Although I can exercise at an advanced level and have in fact done some of Cathe's other DVDs, they always leave me feeling completely worn out, and thus I tend to have a high ""dread factor"" for these workouts.  Happily, High Step Circuit, which is labeled on the DVD case as ""Beginner/Intermediate"" (although only ""Intermediate"" on the DVD title credits) was a perfect fit for my preference to work out at a more immediate level.

As the title would suggest, this is a circuit workout broken down into six cycles (about 6-7 minutes apiece), each one consisting of a 1 minute cardio segment using the high step (the Firm's Fanny Lifter, which is what I used, also works well here) followed by a lower body toning exercise (also using the step, sometimes set at a lower level), a compound toning exercise using light (3 lb.) weights, an upper body toning exercise using tubing (which I don't have, so I just stuck with the dumbbells), and finally, core work.  All of the moves are quite basic, and each cardio choreography sequence is repeated four times within the 1 minute interval.

Here is a complete breakdown of the workout:

4 minute warm-up consisting of basic side-to-side steps and various large arm movements; no static stretches

Cycle 1
cardio: basic climb with step hop, alternate leg extension, repeater
leg press--squat/overhead press with weights--overhead press with tubing--plank work with legs moving in and out

Cycle 2
cardio: knee lift, repeater knee, run on step, tap down
side/back lunges--plie squat with weights--plie squat with upright rows using tubing--side-to-side rotations (seated on step)

Cycle 3
cardio: step knee to corner, tap/rock press, push off hop
running man (knee raise/rear lunge)--static lunge plus front/side raise with weights--front/side raise with tubing--plank with knees in and out

Cycle 4
cardio: knee side, over step, knee back, repeater knees
lunge kicks--back lunge with dumbbell hammer curls--bicep curls with tubing--crunches on floor

Cycle 5
cardio: step kick--repeater front/rear kick--side kick over step
leg press--deadlift/dead row with weights combo--rear delt flyes with tubing--obliques on step

Cycle 6
cardio: one-legged squats, hop over step, swims (hop side-to-side)
leg sculpting drills (crouch and raise knee)--tricep dips off step--triceps with tubing--push-ups (various options)

4-minute cool-down stretch; mostly full-body stretches on floor

The total workout time is 48.5 minutes; there is also an 8.5 minute stability ball segment which contains various types of crunches (eg, lying on the ball, resting your feet on the ball, holding the ball in your hands/under your knees, and lying face-down on the ball for back work).  I loved the variety that the cycles offered, and I found that changing quickly from one thing to the next made the time fly by to me.  I don't like complex choreography, so the simple moves on the step were perfect for me, yet I also found them to be fun, especially the kickboxing-type moves.  Also, I had no problems keeping the intensity up to my level.  In fact, I think this workout would be very easy to modify up or down simply by changing the step height and the resistance (weights/tubing).  Although I did go with a higher step height than Cathe in spots, I stuck with the light weights and considered the entire routine to be more of a cardio workout--which worked well considering that my heart rate was in my target zone for almost 40 minutes!  However, I obviously got a good toning workout too since I can feel it in both my arms and legs the next day; if you wanted to use this DVD more for strength, you could simply just use heavier weights.

Although I do think this workout is easily modified for most levels, I would NOT recommend it to absolute beginners, especially since Cathe does not go into form details; also, I think some of the step work, even modified, would be too intense for those new to exercise.  However, advanced beginners with some exercise experience under their belts should do fine as long as they modify when needed, and intermediates like myself should easily be able to make this workout work for them as I did.  Finally, the DVD offers many options, including a breakdown of the workout by cycles as well as a more complete ""Mix and Match"" menu.  Overall, I would highly recommend this fun, varied, full-body workout, especially to advanced beginner through high intermediate exercisers.",1162080000,43,4527,5.029451137884873

8093909,5,B000BXYKWA,"Love Cathe workouts, this is a great one for those days when you want to do something not so intense.  Although, if you wanted to,  you could ramp up this workout by using heavier weights and a higher step.  I believe that most workouts can be as intense or as mellow as you make them.",1442016000,,285,4.1454545454545455

8093911,2,B000BXYKWA,"I love Cathe and could watch her all day....however, this DVD is just not cutting it for me because I believe the cardio segments need to be longer. I am not a believer in interval training unless the interval keeps your heart rate up. I don't care what anyone says, I do not believe it's good for the heart to pump up, then dramatically decrease over and over during a routine. I just try to embellish the intervals with my own cardio additions but after awhile that gets old.",1387238400,,477,4.370786516853933
8093912,5,B000BXYKWA,"I have been doing this DVD work-out for several years (in fact my DVD eventually got scratches and I had to buy a new one!).  I have tried many different exercise DVDs and this is hands-down my favorite.  I do it once or twice a week and I just love it.  I'm an intermediate exerciser and I want a challenge, but not something so extreme that I feel like I will wind up injured.  This is the perfect balance!  Genuinely enjoyable, the time flies by.",1383091200,,449,4.235294117647059
8093913,5,B000BXYKWA,"As always, Cathe keeps you moving, your heart rate up and your body jumpin'. This work out is easy enough for a beginner, yet tough enough for seasoned steppers.",1362528000,,161,4.586206896551724
8093914,4,B000BXYKWA,"I consider myself at an intermediate/advanced level of fitness.

This dvd is clearly listed as beginner/intermediate.  That said, for that level, I think this workout is excellent.

I can usually up the intensity by adding weights or substituting higher intensity moves but that just did not do it.  The moves are actually fine, there are just too few reps and the speed is way too slow to get my heart rate into my target heart rate zone.",1318377600,,439,4.662337662337662
8093915,4,B000BXYKWA,"This is touted as one of Cathe's ""easier"" workouts!  I am an intermediate exercises, and this was doable, but still tough.  :-)  The workout has been broken down by an earlier reviewer, but I will add my general impressions.  Each circuit begins with a short cardio routine (some more complicated than others), then moves to different exercises using both dumbbells and tension bands.  Each ends with a short core segment and stretch.  Great concept, and I really wanted to like it, but you have to continually adjust your high step to add or remove risers for the different exercises.  The use of both bands and dumbbells adds some variety to the exercises, but I don't like using bands and so I stuck with dumbbels for all the exercises.  Cathe's personality shines in this workout (""break time is over!"") and she is motivating and encouraging.  The music was good and the setting was bright and cheerful. This might be perfect for someone who enjoys short workouts (i.e., doing just one or two circuits at a time), but I felt it was just a little busy for a long workout (i.e., doing all the circuits together.)",1291766400,,1114,4.701030927835052
8093916,5,B000BXYKWA,"This is just what I was looking for. Great workout for beginners and intermediate incorporating aerobic and sculpting. You will need weights, step, and resistance tube. Simple but challenging moves. Cathe is a very good instructor, gives you previews of all upcoming moves.",1284336000,,273,5.372093023255814
