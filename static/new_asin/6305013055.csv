7880548,3,6305013055,Not a whole lot of how-to stuff.  They interview three average looking strippers and then we get to see their routines.  The strip down to topless.  Not too bad.  Its nice to see a how to video where there's a little skin.,1289865600,,222,4.214285714285714
7880549,5,6305013055,"This video helped my confidence tremendously. It was geared for ""normal"" women and showed an easy beginner routine that got rave reviews from my husband.",1214784000,12,153,5.16
7880550,1,6305013055,"If you are seriously looking for some instruction on sexy stripping technique pass on this chatty bit of rubbish. If, on the other hand, you just want some confidence building go for it. The couples on screen couldn't be more average.",1096329600,4,234,4.7317073170731705
7880551,1,6305013055,"When I bought this tape, I got ""The Art Of Exotic Dance"" as well because it was one of Amazon's special deals. I watched both videos and have come to this conclusion. ""How To Strip For Your Husband, Lover or Partner"" had some good points, but all they basically tell you is to feel confident, give eye contact, etc. Basic things we all know. Which I don't feel like it's worth the money. I feel that the ""strippers"" were not as experienced as they go on and tell you. After they interview these ""strippers"", they do a strip tease afterwards... which... well... was the funniest thing ever. These girls are CLUELESS. Go down to a strip club with your husbands and you will see that NOBODY DANCES LIKE THAT!! I would advise you get ""The Art Of Exotic Dance"" because it really focuses on the dancing and how to do it well. It's good for all ages and the instructor/stripper actually knew what she was doing. In a nutshell, just buy ""The Art Of Exotic Dancing"" and not this one... save your money.",1047340800,95,993,4.4316939890710385
7880552,1,6305013055,"I wish I had read the bad reviews before I bought this. There is absolutely no instruction on dance moves. First of all, it was embarrassingly obvious that none of the three strippers with ""several years of experience"" had ever stripped before! The only thing I can think is that the creators wanted us to feel good compared to them.  The extreme lack of talent and looks of the three women was indeed nonthreatening.  Do not buy this video if you want to learn dance moves. It does give ideas about placing candles and wine around the bedroom or bathroom.",1032220800,39,556,4.55
7880553,4,6305013055,"For women who already do wild and crazy things for their husbands, you don't really need this. Just get some music and start practicing. You can get all your moves from a movie or a Bettie Page video. This is more geared for the ABSOLUTE beginner. If you know it's something you want to do, but you have  no idea where to begin, you haven't danced in years or you need a little confidence, this video breaks stripping down to fundamentals. The three women have average bodies, they're not Showgirl material, which will make this less intimidating for many women. The examples given don't involve any fancy flexibility and are very low impact (physically!). You won't get any awards at an amateur contest by following these routines, but I have yet to meet anyone whose husbands aren't pleased by a stripping ambush.
I was disappointed that they didn't mention the value of a little humor, a mistake many marital-help videos make. A lot of women don't surprize their husbands because they're afraid of being laughed at. The ""experts"" should realize the best cure for that is to make the ambush funny. Nothing breaks the tension of your first strip tease better than fake hillbilly teeth or a bra stuffed with a couple of helium balloons!",997401600,,1236,4.748837209302326
7880554,4,6305013055,"While not as racy as the title might suggest, How to strip for your husband has some good advice for all women (of all sizes and shapes and ages). The interviews with real strippers are interesting and the basic  techniques and suggestions are worthy of note - however they should have  included a list of where to get props... If you were worried about how you  might look *stripped* you might feel better after watching too. Also if  you've ever wondered if your husband would like to be stripped for they  even interview husbands to get their opinions. It might be a fun gift for a  wedding shower or bachelorette party for the wife to be. However this video  is not fluffy - and don't expect soft porn - this is not that kind of video  - put it in the self-help category. Basically the theme is: put a new flame  in your marriage play...",915235200,25,841,4.374193548387097
