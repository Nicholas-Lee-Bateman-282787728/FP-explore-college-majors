This is candid look into her thoughts and extraordinary talent as she goes through a class at the barre and in the center of the room with her classical Russian ballet instructor and then later as she does more modern work with a talented choreographer. Please, can someone see that this comes out on DVD?",1524096000,,451,4.580246913580247
8210244,5,6301007441,"Makarova: In A Class Of Her Own stands with Natalia Makarova's PBS Tashkent railroad journey as her mass media off-stage best. An inspired and beautiful dancer, and tough enough to continue working On Your Toes after serious injury from a falling stagelight, Ms. Makarova's dying swan characterization is justly famous, and some of her leg technique at the time of this practice-room documentary was simply a joy to watch. That was more than a few years ago now, and neither this nor the PBS program has been in print for a while. It would be great if this was re-released on DVD... maybe someday.",1167523200,5,597,4.75
