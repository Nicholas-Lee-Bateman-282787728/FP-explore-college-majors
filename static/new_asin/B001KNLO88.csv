3666652,5,B001KNLO88,Not only a great heist film but this is a complete version with a beginning that has been missing from other prints. Film quality is very good.,1357344000,2,143,4.333333333333333
3666653,5,B001KNLO88,"So glad this movie finally gets the treatment it deserves. The picture quality has been restored with a wider range of natural colours and earthtones, comes with a 1:85 widescreen ratio, makes it a delight to watch again. There is a bonus scene added to the opening of the movie, which is a great surprise!! Sound is very clear and considering the brilliant soundtrack, is a big plus. Don't think twice if you like this film, just BUY IT!!",1355788800,4,439,4.569620253164557
3666654,5,B001KNLO88,"Warner Archive delivers a solid Action yarn posing as a Spaghetti Western in Director Don Taylor's 'THE FIVE MAN ARMY- aka 'UN ESERCITO DI CINQUE UOMINI'- 1969.  Released over a decade ago by the Shaorma Digital label in a hazy transfer which is now discontinued and going for big bucks on the collectors market, you can be rest assured that this release is the real deal so you can save your money.  Americano Peter Graves in between his 'MISSION:IMPOSSIBLE' series leads a band of men with special talents including James Daly, burly Bud Spencer right before his mega hit Director Enzo Barboni's 'THEY CALL ME TRINITY' aka 'LO CHIAMAVANO TRINITA'- 1970 of which Barboni does the wonderful photography in this film , Tesuro Tamba coming off his role of Tiger Tanaka in Director Lewis Gilbert's 'YOU ONLY LIVE TWICE'- 1967 , Nino Castelnuovo, and Claudio Gora.  The film also has the great Piero Lulli, the beautiful Daniela Giordano and genre great Giacomo Rossi Stuart holding down the fort. The score seems to be a collaboration of Ennio Morricone and Bruno Nicolai together which is magnificent and moves the film through its paces. With a script by future thriller director Dario Argento who scribed other Spaghetti's, it resembles a heist film in 'MAGNIFICENT SEVEN' clothing by having our five guys in nail-biting style steal $500,000 in gold from a Mexican train in route of rescuing Castelnuovo's revolutionary character.  There seems to be a slight controversy in who the true director of this film was. Rumor has it that Director Taylor left for the US before the film was completed thereby having the films producer Italo Zingarelli finish it off.  Zingarelli is also a psuedonymn for Guilio Questi who would also direct the controversial 'DJANGO KILL...IF YOU LIVE SHOOT' aka 'SE SEI VIVO SPARA'- 1967 and produce Barboni's 'TRINITY' series but the direction does not look like his style so I think the film belongs to Taylor.  Regardless, its a great rip roaring adventure for all ages.  Warner releases it as a DVD-R in a gorgeous 1.85 transfer with crisp sound looking like it was made yesterday.  Its interesting to see that modern filmmakers such as Sylvester Stallone with his 'EXPENDABLES' series are still making movies like this so click the add to cart button and see how it was done in the late sixties.  Highly Recommended.",1348099200,16,2348,4.924050632911392
3666655,5,B001KNLO88,"""At least there is no pesky secretary to disavow of yuor actions"":The Five Man Army is indeed a very well-written
(by Dario Argento)&well-acted Mexican Revolution-era styled Spaghetti Western starring 2 American TV actors;Peter
Graves as the Mastermind called ""the Dutchman"",in between seasons 3 & 4 as IMF Mastermind Jim Phelps on Mission:
Impossible and James Daly ,who would go on to star as the senior doctor/surgeon opposite Chad Everett on the series
Medical Center. Bud Spencer is cast in an actually believeable character role as Mesito,a Bluto-like strongman,who is not an entirely clownish character as in the Trinity films starring Terence Hill. This is a must own film for
Spaghetti Western Aficionados.",1281830400,,715,5.392857142857143
3666656,4,B001KNLO88,a real good film which I rate as good as fistful of dollars as it also has a ennio morricone soundtrack. if you love spagetti westerns you will not be dissapointed. its adiamond in the rough for spagetti western lovers . its pricey but a must have for the spagetti western lovers.,1256774400,4,280,4.403846153846154
3666657,5,B001KNLO88,"What a wonderful ""B"" spaghetti western.  The action, the music and the acting all harken back to the good ol' days of drive-in classics from Italy.  Magnificent Seven minus 2 is a fast paced tale of mercenaries lead by the indomitable Peter Graves to assist rebel forces during the Mexican revolution to rob a train full of gold.  But it's no ordinary train.  There is the Mexican military armed with machine guns and a cannon to thwart any plans, but that does not stop this five man army.  An under appreciated classic of its time.",1393718400,,533,4.568421052631579
3666658,5,B001KNLO88,"As with so many movies (particularly drama and action) all five characters are introduced to us within the first twenty minutes or so.  Their prowess with each of their individual skills as well as their character backgrounds sets up the audience for expectations later on. And we're not disappointed.  It isn't a grand movie on the scale of the ""Dollar"" Westerns, but as story lines go, acting, and crafting of the final product, it's very good entertainment.  For Bud Spencer fans, this is another good one to add to the collection.",1388275200,,534,4.846153846153846
3666659,5,B001KNLO88,"I HAVE ALWAYS LIKED PETER GRAVES AS AN ACTOR ALTHOUGH I LIKE CLINT EASTWOOD I NEVER DID LIKE HIS SPAGHETTI  WESTERNS, BUT I DO LIKE FIVE MAN ARMY",1388016000,,145,4.178571428571429
3666660,5,B001KNLO88,"W western Mission: Impossible I once called this spaghetti western.

Peter Graves is the Dutchman, a  man with an assignment to steal a large shipment of gold from the Mexican government for the Revolution. It's on a train, well guarded with a troop on horseback every five miles along the route. A carload of soldiers, not to mention those in with gold.

He chooses a team for their talents, all associates from his past: the strong man(Bud Spencer), the explosive expert(James Daly), a circus acrobat/sharpshooter(Nino Castuelnuov0), and the expert knifeman(Tetsuro Tanba).

Watching them go through the plan is like warching a MI episode: right up to the double cross.

Great film.",1382918400,,684,5.126126126126126
3666661,5,B001KNLO88,this was for my husband and he really enjoyed it.  said it was as good as the first time he saw it a long time ago on tv,1364256000,,120,3.2857142857142856
3666662,5,B001KNLO88,"I was a kid when I first saw the movie and I loved it.  The excitement I felt watching this band of adventurers while they stopped a train loaded with gold that was going to the government of Mexico. It was like a western Mission impossible episode. The way they planned the mission and executed it, The action in this movie I found very good a kind of stay on the edge of your seat kind of action. I would definitely recommend it.",1363910400,,431,4.192771084337349
3666663,5,B001KNLO88,"The Western  belongs to America.  We invented it  and we lost it to the Italians during the 60's and early 70's.  The Italians loved Westerns and when they died here they re-imagined them there in Italy.  So what did we Americans do?  Our stars went to Italy to make Italian Westerns!  This is a perfect example of this.  Five Man Army uses Peter Grave and John Daily as the leads and have American director/actor Don Taylor directing.  Enico Morricone wrote the music.  However the music isn't top drawer Morricone.

The film has a somewhat tv feel in the look of the film and in the story telling.  One reviewer used Mission Impossible in his review and that is an accurate statement, because the story feels like a Misson Impossible TV show.  Don't get me wrong this is a strong film and an enjoyable one too.  The five men are likable and we care about them.  The story has enough twists to make the robbery exciting.  The action is another area that feels like a tv story.  There isn't the blood shed that made Italian Westerns popular at the time.

If you are an Italian Western fan like me this is a forgotten gem along with Hannie Caulder.",1363824000,,1147,4.458937198067633
3666664,4,B001KNLO88,"I pretty much had no idea what was going on in this movie. I was only in it for the Peter Graves. He looked great, as usual and also seemed like he was having a really good time filming this movie.",1362873600,,197,3.8292682926829267
3666665,5,B001KNLO88,"- I'm a fan of westerns concerning the Mexican revolution made in the sixties, and the ""Five man army"" is one of them.
- I saw this movie in the early seventies, and remenbered parts of it.
- Predictable but good story, performed bij exellent actors like Peter Graves.
- Good dialogs witch are not too long, and good action scenes (for me that is).
- It's a movie that belongs in the past (end of the sixties) for people of my generation.
- I don't think that the young generation of today will buy this item, because violent acts and the special effects of today are much
better and more realistic.",1359590400,4,599,4.357142857142857
3666666,5,B001KNLO88,"Never had seen or heard of this movie and bought it based on reviews here. Rest of reviewers were spot on as movie was highly entertaining with twists here and there. Great transfer, 1 of the best looking older movies i've seen.  Beautiful scenery, good acting, lots of action on the train and Ennio Morricones outstanding score equals a  5 star rating in my book.",1358208000,3,364,4.584615384615384

8315503,4,B001KNLO88,"Before , during and after seeing this really fun adventure pic , I looked up a couple of cast members on Wikipedia . My wife already knew that a couple of James Daly's children were actors Tim and Tyne Daly .
Bud Spencer was the really interesting search for me . I reckoned that the big husky Italian gentlemen must somehow be Bud Spencer as he got top five billing and so on . It's truly amazing how much stuff Mr. Spencer (his Western acting name) has accomplished in his life . And continues to .
The film itself didn't truly grab me by the lapels until it intensely well done and exciting third reel . The heist kicks in and the film goes into overtime .
I was fortunate to even ever see this picture I'd never even heard of . Again , the credit goes to Warner Archives streaming film channel .
The film also stars Peter Graves , was directed by Don Taylor and co-written by Dario Argento . Check it out . 1970 tasty .",1397260800,,923,4.162011173184357
