1785743,4,B00006LPAS,"Let me just say I love G-Gundam. I think it's the freshest mecha series I've seen in awhile and a change from the norm of Gundam sagas. However, the first few episodes might leave a few viewers confused.
CHARACTERS
Domon Kashu: Neo-Japan's fighter and the ""King of Hearts"" (explained later on).
Rain Mikamura: Domon's assistant and medical expert.
Chibodee Crocket: Neo-America's fighter.
Sai Saichi: Neo-China's fighter.
George Dissan: Neo-France's fighter.
This story takes place in the year Future Century 60. In order to decide which nation will control outer space, a tournament is held every four years to decide which nation gains control of Earth. However, most of this won't come into much play until the second half of the series.
Episode 1 (B+): Domon and Rain go to Rome to fight Neroes Gundam and also save the life of a young girl.
Episode 2 (B): Domon is off to Neo-America to fight Gundam Maxter, but the government has other plans.
Episode 3 (B-): Domon must bring back the Dragon Gundam from a bunch of Chinese smugglers.
Episode 4 (B+): Domon helps a young girl gain the respect of Geroge Dissan by making Domon kidnap her in order to draw out the Rose Gundam.
The English dub has the names of some of the Gundams switched, but that doesn't come up in this first volume. Domon's voice sounds very realistic and actually does more justice to his character. The English dub of Rain is done perfectly and makes her personality seem less cutesy.
The menu for scene selection is cleverly setup as a map of the world, but it is a little hard to select from there. The only extra on this disc is an interview with the original director making comments on the episodes and why they were setup that way.
Overall, this first volume won't automatically draw fans into it, but it is worth watching as the series goes on. In other words, if you buy this volume, make sure you are willing to buy the entire series.",1036281600,6,1919,4.647058823529412
1785744,5,B00006LPAS,In My Oppinon This Series Has Been Fun To Watch Ever Since It Came On In August But Im Glad That It's Being Relessed On Dvd So The Gundam Fans Have Something To Enjoy My Favoret Part Is Were Domon Saves Rain From Being Traped Inside The Dark Gundam Allenby Tells Domon That The Pandora's Box Can Be Opened Again,1034812800,,311,4.2

1785804,5,B00006LPAS,"Unlike the orthodox gundam series (0079, Zeta, 0080, etc.) which try to be as realistic as possible with a few super-heroish characters, the G-Gundam series is full of wild imaginations and real super heroes, and has a heavy influence from kung-fu movies. Also, unlike most gundam series lecturing ""war is bad"" and ""people die for no reason"",  this series will show you that fighting gives you the ultimate meaning of life...

It's a very funny series. Very entertaining, intentionally superficial, a Gundam series that mocks Gundam world. It's definitely worth watching, especially when you are a little tired of the recurring themes (a.k.a. cliche) of traditional gundam.",1410912000,,673,5.280373831775701
1785805,5,B00006LPAS,A great and memorable series!,1404604800,,29,5.0
1785806,5,B00006LPAS,"I remember like if it was yesterday when i started watching Anime on Toonami. I didn't really have a favorite show since being a kid any cartoon would keep me entertained. So after spending some time watching, G Gundam appeard before my eyes. It was weird since most Cartoons involve humor, wacky characters, and obvious plots. The Gundam series was way different, maybe thats why i loved it. The awesome music, mech battles, great story, is what made me a Gundam fan till this day.",1404000000,2,482,4.682352941176471
1785807,1,B00006LPAS,"if you like gundam wing and 08th ms team then this series is not for you. I love how 08th ms team and 0083 are close to real life. G-gundam is a totally different type of gundam anime. It has poor graphics and a continuing theme with each episode. he fights a different country each episode but it is basically the same thing over and over again. I couldn't even finish the series because of how annoying the characters are. I was the same way with gundam seed though, rediculuos Japanese anime is not fun to watch. but 0083 I could watch over and over again and never get sick of it.",1401408000,,584,4.223214285714286
1785808,5,B00006LPAS,"So. Mobile Suit G Gundam. If you're expecting Gundam Wing, Seed, or anything from the U.C. timeline this is not for you. There is an underlying sense of war but it's shoved to the side for more Gundam fighting action and the story of a man trying to find his brother.

It's a more laid back version of gundam. Imagine if the Dragonball world tournament had a child with Gundam, this is the result. So if you want emotional ties, political plot twist, and war this it's not for you. Pick up 0083 stardust memory, 8th ms team or one of the above mentioned. But if you want a fun story, gundam fights, and some interesting mech designs, G Gundam might float your boat.

Overall, it's fun to watch, easy to get into, and you don't have to keep up with a complicated plot.

Would recommend for anyone's Gundam collection.",1394150400,5,816,4.426666666666667
1785809,4,B00006LPAS,"You know, it's just amazing. Even 30 years after the classic Mobile Suit Gundam aired and created one of the most successful and influential anime franchises of all time, and after its numerous incarnations, G Gundam is still the most ""different"" and ""original"" of them all. And all it really did was combine the Gundam brand with the ""Super Robot"" genre, which was the genre that dominated the mecha anime world before MSG. G Gundam retakes the old Super Robot roots and does a fantastic job at it, really. It's funny because it's the only series which very unequivocally and unapologetically states that Gundams are the center of the universe. The gundams are hilarious, ridiculous and maybe somewhat racist, the characters are fun and very memorable, the plot is surprisingly original, for a mecha show, and it just has a lot of heart and intensity behind it. It's just really good, it's a classic. You'll have a blast watching it after you get used to how cooky it is. My only criticism is that the animation is not really that good, and is very inconsistent at times.",1393545600,2,1072,4.737967914438503

1785837,5,B00006LPAS,"This Gundam series is an interesting one...100% enjoyable, a little tongue and cheek, goofy story, and kinda profiles all the countries in hilarious Gundams. A bunch of gundams fly to Earth for a battle royal to see who will run all the space colony countries. Not as deep as the other Gundam Series but, as I say, enjoyable and the most hilarious robots ever. Worth adding, starts off slow, finishes pretty well",1344643200,,412,4.736111111111111

For Gundam funs, this looks very different from Original Gundam, however, G Gundam has the closest concept of it.
If you are already in love with this anime, try Giant Robo.

I honestly love to recommend this anime to everyone. This is a pure entertainment. (It might be better to skip some episodes.)

1785863,1,B00006LPAS,"Ok fine, so nations have Gundam fights to not have bloodshed.  They put too much emphasis on Japan, with the main character, how was it that Japan was allowed to have two upgraded Gundams while other nations had one and stayed with one?  Then the fighters produce special abilities like you would in Street Fighter or Dragon Ball.  If you're a kid, it could appeal to you, but as an adult.  I rather settle for Gundam Wing.",1316131200,,423,4.454545454545454

1785868,4,B00006LPAS,"Let's face it; on the whole, Mobile-Fighter G Gundam is typically considered by fans to be the black sheep of the Gundam franchise.  I knew this going into the 49-episode DVD collection, which is spaced out across two 6-disc sets from Bandai under the budget-friendly Anime Legends collections.

So consistent was the negative feedback of the series that I purposely began my Gundam viewing obsession with the original, followed by Zeta, Wing, Seed, 0080, and 0083 all before tearing into G.  With apprehension and low expectations, I began the 49-episode journey of Domon Kasshu and company and am pleased to report that I was pleasantly surprised.  Before we get into the nitty-gritty of the highs and lows of the show itself, let us take a moment to discuss G Gundam's roots and developments.

As many know, the Mobile Suit Gundam franchise is one of the longest-standing and most successful licenses to come out of Japan, a nation known for an obsession with all-things Giant Robot.  That said, back in 1994 the Gundam franchise was already celebrating its fifteenth year of existence and commemorated the occasion with three individual and unrelated programs (G was the first of the three, followed by Wing then the 08th MS Team).

Airing in Japan in 1994 (and running through 1995), G Gundam maintains the dark, gritty feel of shows from the era like Gundam Wing.  However, unlike Wing, G Gundam takes place in the Future Century (FC) where the earth-nations-inspired space colonies battle it out to earn control over the planet for a four-year term.  Democracy be darned, this responsibility is determined through a Roman Gladiator style tournament whereby each colony sends a Gundam (& pilot) to duke it out on the planet's surface, often at the expense of the population/ landmarks.

On paper the plot sounds pretty weak and certainly contributed to my low expectations going into the program.  However, and like the rest of the Gundam franchise in general, the show's writers wisely pace the larger plot context against the more-immediate and relatable struggles of a lead character, his love interest, and a mysterious photograph.  In truth, the ""mortal combat"" theme of each episode serves only as a story progression tool while the cast is methodically introduced.

Where the show succeeds is through its immature yet lovable cast of characters.  National pride (and clichs) abounds and constantly reminded this author of the simple reality that nobody but the Japanese could have so flawlessly pulled it off.  Die-hard fans of the Gundam mythos will likely cringe at Mobile Suits (or Mobile Fighters as the case may be) decked out to resemble a boxer or a windmill make their appearance.  However I should point out that for every laughable gimmick displayed, there are at least a pair of wicked-cool Mobile Fighter designs including Neo-Germany's Shadow Gundam, Neo-China's Dragon Gundam and even lead character Domon Kasshu's Shining and Burning Gundams.

Of course the individual fighters pale in comparison to the larger conflict presented here in Domon's mission of vengeance against his corrupted brother, former master, and the dreaded and oftentimes disturbing Dark Gundam.  Taking a chapter from The Empire Strike's Back, a large portion of the lead character's development comes in the form of training.  Only unlike mastering The Force, Domon's own struggles involve mastery of an ever-evolving form of martial arts called Tohofuhai.  Espeically noteworthy in this sequence is a dull and rusted sword that cannot slice through butter when operated by an unfocused mind.  This representation of the acquisition of discipline works very well here and sets Domon up perfectly for an epic battle between multiple enemies.

Pacing of the story is quite fluid as well despite a bit of inconsistency in the lead characters' abilities.  Early episodes show a Domon able to catch a barrage of gunfire with his bare fingers only to be intimidated by a lone pistol later on and his mechanic/ personal physician/ love interest Rain Mikamura starts out with a plethora of gadgets (like force-field-generator earrings) that seem to disappear as the show progresses as well.

I should mention that while the plot advances with steady authority, the maturation of lead character, Domon Kasshu is a bit more inconsistent.  He is introduced as shadowy, almost supernatural character displaying amazing feats of strength and ability only to regress to a bit of a wild card about midway through the prose.  His impatience and lack of discipline come to a fever pitch just before the showdown between he and his former master but his personality continues to fluctuate even throughout the Gundam Fight Finals in Hong Kong.

More consistent is the character of Rain who manages to become Domon's counterpoint in many situations with level headedness and patience.

In conclusion perhaps G Gundam's greatest strength is intertwined with its greatest flaw: It is a part of the Gundam Universe.  Because of this, viewers are treated to a take on the franchise literally like no other before it or since.  Classic and contemporary Gundam designs make cameos left and right (especially during the later stages of the tournament) including the likes of the original Mobile Suits, Zeta Gundam, F91, Victory Gundam and so on.  Sharp eyed viewers will delight in spotting the subtle homage to the other series' hidden throughout.

Conversely, being affiliated with the Gundam Universe is a dangerous proposition for any show not because of continuity restraints but rather because the bar has simply been raised so far that anything that strays from the formula seems to be rejected.  Viewers coming in to G Gundam expecting the political and scientific accuracy that the franchise is known for will surely be disappointed.  To put it simply, G Gundam sacrifices nearly all aspects of political conflict or scientific intricacy to deliver its more action-oriented prose.  Sure it's a step in the wrong direction for those who view the franchise as a mecha-oriented Star Trek but on the other hand it's no more unrealistic than beloved American robot shows like Voltron or Transformers (explaining its success during its 2002 debut on Cartoon Network).",1238544000,56,6245,5.149504950495049
1785869,4,B00006LPAS,"Overall this was a very good series.
