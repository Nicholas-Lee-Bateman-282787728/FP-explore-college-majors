1841675,5,B00008EY6Q,"I loved this series and was sad to see it was cancelled. John Lovitz is hilarious and some of my fav characters were created in this cartoon, i esp love jay sherman's father. its about time all the episodes were put on DVD. It always puts a smile on my face when i turn on comedy central late at night to find a re run but now i can finally watch it. Hey maybe if the DVD sales are good enough this show might come back on the air. It worked for Family Guy!",1074470400,,457,3.872340425531915
1841676,3,B00008EY6Q,"At one point on the Simpsons' Season 3 commentary, Matt Groening says he thought it was great Al Jean and Mike Reiss got to do ""The Critic,"" since they could finally write all the film parodies they wanted.  Jean's response, basically, is ""Look how far it went.""
Not as far as it deserved, sadly, and ""The Critic"" feels like a creature of its time.  Satires of films like ""Cliffhanger"" and ""Scent of a Woman"" were a lot funnier when the movies were fresh in people's heads.  Still, ""The Critic"" had one-liners only ""The Simpsons"" could rival, from Jay's ""And that's why I'm glad the Beatles broke up"" to Franklin's should-have-been-classic ""As the first black female head of the Ku Klux Klan, I'd like to say America stinks!""
No surprise, then, that this was the first prime time cartoon that could hold its own with and frequently surpass Homer and the gang (if you remember ""Capital Critters,"" you'll see my point).  I personally prefer the Fox episodes, which rub down some of Jay's harsher edges (Alice is a big help) and go into loonier directions than the ABC episodes, but each show has achingly funny moments, whether it's Orson Welles narrating a video will or a ""Have A Nice Day"" poster calling Jay ""a scum-sucking loser.""
Unlike ""The Simpsons,"" though, ""The Critic"" often targeted specific fads or celebrities, which are funny as long as those targets are in the public mind. A scene of Roseanne terrorizing New York was a lot funnier when, well, Roseanne was, and some of the Clinton jokes are already frayed around the edges.  If ""The Critic"" had survived longer, as it should have, these things might have been less noticeable, but with only 23 episodes in the can, there isn't as much timelessness as there is with ""The Simpsons.""
Still, the energy and excellent writing makes this a good addition to the collection of any Evergreen Terrace fan, who can see that the talents of that show's extraordinary crew weren't limited to Springfield.",1074297600,13,1955,4.789317507418398

1841680,5,B00008EY6Q,"The Critic was a hilarious 90s show about cartoon satire spoofing movies,people,and New York. Jay Sherman was a short,chubby movie critic that lived in New York with his son Marty which was in most episodes,his wife was a mean woman that took care of Marty,until Jay found a woman named Alice and her daughter Penny. Jay would review  movies like The Cockroach King and Orson Welles. Jay's friends were Ethan,a Australian man that would copycat Crocidile Dundee,Doris,his hair dresser that smoked,and his mean but friendly boss Duke Phillips. Jay's parents were Eleanor and Franklin that acted weird and Margo was Jay's sister that lived with Jay's parents. The best cartoon ever.",1073001600,2,680,5.126126126126126
1841681,5,B00008EY6Q,"One of the cooler shows from 1994, I was immediately drawn to The Critic back during it's original run on ABC. How could you not be? From the producers of The Simpsons, The Critic was an animated hybrid of The Simpsons and Siskel & Ebert featuring the hilarious voice talents of Christine Cavanaugh (Gosalyn from ""Darkwing Duck""), Park Overall (Laverne from ""Empty Nest""), Charles Napier (Z from ""Men In Black: The Animated Series""), and of course SNL's Jon Lovitz as the hapless, lovelorn, milquetoast critic Jay Sherman. The neverending source of hollywood media material (nothing is spared) coupled with Simpsons-like humor and Lovitz's instant catch-phrase of ""It stinks!"" should have more than solidified the series a fitting place alongside The Simpsons in terms of longevity. But alas, the show was bumped from ABC's schedule, then cancelled altogether after a season of floundering on the air. A decade later, here we are being rewarded with a neatly packaged complete series boxed set. Definitely a must-have for your DVD collection!",1072396800,11,1042,5.208333333333333

Thats awesome! The Critic was on of the best shows in the last ten years, be it great movie spoofs, its great gags, its lovable main character (voiced perfectly by Jon Lovetts) and its wonderful storylines (one of the best has to be the episode with Siskle and Ebert, very touching now since Siskles death). I hope the Dvd contains the internet shorts as well, those are very funny too. I'll save every penny I get to own this.",1070064000,4,639,4.423728813559322
1841777,5,B00008EY6Q,"The Critic is a classic cartoon that unfortunately had a very short run. It stars the voice of the very talented Jon Lovitz who plays Jay Sherman, a renowned film critic and film buff. This being a show that was from Simpsons show runners Al Jean and Mike Reiss, you're going to see some similar humor here and there. Jay Sherman was such a great character he actually appeared in two Simpsons episodes, specifically ""A Star is Burns"", and ""Hurricane Neddy"". Having watched this series myself, I can definitely say it does not stink. It's one of the better animated series out there that could have gone on for so much longer, but unfortunately fate was not on Jay Sherman's side. Nonetheless, it's still a very funny show that was always so charming, witty and full of heart.",1516665600,,776,4.630434782608695

Family Guy, American Dad, Cleveland Show, and Simpsons won out finding the teen-college-killi'n time sweet spot that The Critic, Dr. Katz, and Daria couldn't quite find. The Critic is closer to Dilbert than Homer Simpson.

1842002,5,B00008EY6Q,"I've been enjoying old episodes of ""The Critic"" a TV series from a long time ago (1990's) that took a satirical look at film critics. Trump and his tendency to get things foreclosed on actually gets mentioned in the very first episode. (Trump Tower is shown ""in foreclosure"" but in later episodes, it bears the new name, ""Alimony Towers"")

It is by the same people that brought us the Simpsons, but in my opinion, it is better than the Simpsons.

Jay Sherman is a movie critic with his own show, ""Coming Attractions,"" and is forced, every week, to review terrible movies, like ""Rabbi, P.I."" (a policeman that goes under cover as a Chasidic Jewish Rabbi, but doesn't know how to perform a circumcision); and ""Home Alone 5"" (Kevin, now 23 years old, again gets left behind when the rest of the family takes a vacation). They even take well deserved pokes at movie remakes, like the ""Pride of the Yankees"" with Lou Gehrig's getting cured of Lou Gehrig's Disease.

It is a hilarious set of episodes, story lines, and lots of made up movies. It was on ABC one season, then got taken over by another network after ABC cancelled it. The Critic even pokes fun at network shows, like the absent-minded person who talks to Mr. Wilson over the fence (only the top of his head is visible), but we find out that Mr. Wilson is a scarecrow, and two different animals provide the misunderstood dialogue.

I bought and watched all the episodes soon after it came out on DVD years ago, and I'm watching it all over again now, watching each of the three DVD's twice. The second disk includes two commentaries and a behind-the-scenes look at the story boards for one episode.

Do be aware that NO CELEBRITIES WERE HARMED DURING THE PRODUCTION OF THIS SERIES.

(In other words, the celebrity impersonations are great.)

If you enjoy satire and celebrity impersonations (and some actual celebrity guest voices), you'll love these movie reviews and plot.",1457136000,,1931,4.712166172106825

This was the first time since then I had watched it again and season 1 sure was funny still! I only remembered that last episode of season 1 though, where he's running the marathon. I don't know why that one always stuck out so much in my mind. I never had season 2 though as it was moved to a channel I didn't have apparently so those episodes were all new to me. While they all had bits and pieces that were really funny still, I felt that season 2 wasn't as good as season 1 was. The extras were fun and interesting, especially the collections of the movie parodies, although I have to say the webisodes were very disappointing to me. They were too short and what happened to all the other fun characters that made the series funny?

One liners galore, and dated 90's references. You kids will love it. Hipsters.

1842392,4,B00008EY6Q,"In 1994, Al Jean and Mike Reiss, former producers for ""The Simpsons"", gave us a show originally intended as a ""love letter to NYC"", but instead resulted in a show that for two seasons acted as a biting satire--and dare I say, indictment--of an overly-commercialized, almighty dollar-devout Hollywood, but with the trappings of a standard sitcom that had friendly character designs juxtaposed with semi-serious subject matter. Starring the voice of Groundlings and Saturday Night Live alum Jon Lovitz, the show focuses on the daily shenanigans of balding, tubby, cynical film critic Jay Sherman, a devotee of films from both the Golden Age of Hollywood (""Citizen Kane"", ""Mister Smith Goes to Washington"") and overseas (""The Red Balloon"")--hence his utter distaste for anything Hollywood has produced since 1985 (the perceived end of the ""New Hollywood"" era) or what qualifies as a 'blockbuster'.

Beyond Jay himself, his supporting cast also gets plenty of development in the two seasons of this show's life. His adopted parents, the WASP-y Franklin and Eleanor Sherman (voiced by Gerrit Graham and Judith Ivey) have interesting characterizations: Franklin is a few teeth short of a comb, never seen without a glass of brandy in hand, and can seem childlike at most times, despite being a former governor of New York; Eleanor, aside from being a Katharine Hepburn caricature, has a bit of Joan Crawford in her treatment towards Jay and her own daughter, Margo (voiced by Nancy Cartwright). (She apparently also comes from a family that has bred the emotion of worry out of their genes). On the subject of Margo, she seems to be the most normal member of Jay's family, a 16-year-old junior student at ""Miss Hathaway's School for Untouched Girls"". She's an activist who is unlike her mother in any way, but does have one weakness in the form of her beloved pony. Unlike Eleanor (who tolerates Jay) and Franklin (who seems to be indifferent), Margo does love her adopted brother Jay, to the point where she made sure that his one-time actress girlfriend wasn't just dating him to get a good review. Jay's ex-wife, Ardeth (voiced by Brenda Vaccaro in season 1 and Rhea Perlman in season 2), absolutely despises him, and makes it a point to remind him (or should I say demand) of how much alimony he owes her every time he comes to spend time with their son, Marty (voiced by Christine Cavanaugh), who does love and look up to his dad. Marty, a student at the U.N. school, has low self-esteem, but has gotten lucky on a few occasions, from dating Fidel Castro's granddaughter (""Marty's First Date"") to becoming eight-grade president (""All the Duke's Men"") to discovering a talent for belly dancing (""A Day at the Races and a Night at the Opera"").

Outside his family life, those around his work life are given just as funny characterizations. Jay's boss, Duke Phillips (voiced by the late Charles Napier), a blatant parody of media mogul Ted Turner, owns the network where Jay's show ""Coming Attractions"" is produced (formerly, believe it or not, a chicken-and-waffles house). Despite his belittling of Jay (who he thinks is gay), he does everything he can to maximize profits and increase ratings of the show, to the point where at one time he had Jay act as a ventriloquist's dummy for new co-host Kareem Abdul-Jabbar. (He's also surprisingly fit to the point of being superhuman!) Jay's makeup lady, Doris Grossman (voiced by the late Doris Grau), is a cynical chain-smoker who's been around through life, from being the former spokes-model for ""Phlegm Fatale Cigarettes"" to marrying horror actor Lon Chaney. (There also seems to be a hydra-effect with her and her cigarettes--take one out of her mouth, another takes its place.) Jay's best friend is in the form of hunky Australian actor Jeremy Hawke (voiced by Maurice LaMarche), a slight parody of actors like Mel Gibson and Paul Hogan. He's a sometimes-action star whose most well-known films are the 'illogical, blasphemous, and ultra-violent' ""Crocodile Ghandi"" movies. The only reason he's friends with Jay? Jay gave his first film its only positive review. Jeremy's experience gives a lot of insight into the way show business works, including a great piece of advice many should follow: ""Never marry an actress, and never do blackface at the NAACP Image Awards."" Then there is Vlada Veramirovich (voiced by Nick Jameson), the Eastern European owner of the restaurant Jay and Jeremy frequent, L'ane Riche (French for ""The Wealthy Jackass""). While Vlada hates Jay (but doesn't show it), he does love his money, ""a love which will never die"". Jay's appetite has been a boon to Vlada and his family (to the point where they once bought a yacht), though when Jay dieted it kept him from sending his son--the strange Zoltan, a fellow student of Marty's at the U.N. school--to Harvard. Vlada also has a great knowledge of who's hot and not in New York, with a schmoozing posse at the ready.

Finally, there are the two characters added in the second season in the form of Jay's new girlfriend, Tennessee-born Alice Thompkins (voiced by Park Overall) and her young daughter Penny (Russi Taylor). Once married to a country singer who cheated on her, she and Penny moved to New York to show Penny that a woman can make it without a man. Jay hires her as his personal assistant, and proves to be a boon to Jay's self-esteem (and sometimes his ratings).

A great thing about the show, and something it is most noted for, is the parodies of various movies seen throughout both seasons, most of which appear as review fodder for Jay on ""Coming Attractions"", with each falling prey to his simple, two-word review: ""It stinks!"". Some personal favorites of mine include ""A Few More Good Men"", a fictional sequel to ""A Few Good Men"" with Jack Nicholson, Christian Slater, and William DeVane; ""Children of A Lesser Godzilla"", about a giant, sign language-using dinosaur who attacks Tokyo; and one of the very first parodies seen on the show, ""Rabbi, P.I."", an Arnold Schwarzenegger vehicle about a Chicago cop who goes undercover as a Hasidic Jew (""Hava Nagila, baby.""). Those parodies, and certainly the voice acting in the show itself, would not be what they are without the great voice talent behind the mics. LaMarche, in addition to Jeremy (and minor characters Principal Mangosuthu and the Shermans' butler Shackleford), takes up the work of voicing most of the various celebrities, from Marlon Brando to Orson Welles to Howard Stern. Jameson pitches in as well, along with Kath Soucie and Tress MacNeille, who provide equally hilarious takes on people such as Faye Dunaway, Madonna, and even Lisa Marie Presley. The writing for the most part is equally as top-notch as the voice acting, with one of the show's writers being none other than Judd Apatow (who in one episode voices Jay Leno before making fun of Leno was even popular). Said writing knew how to really poke fun at and cut down to size the whole Hollywood system at the time of its airing--which can also apply to today's Hollywood in the midst of what I call a ""creative drought"". A good example of this can be found in the very first episode, where Duke Phillips tears into Jay over his style of criticism:
Duke--""Why the hell do you have to be so critical???""
Jay--""I'm a CRITIC.""
Duke--""No, your job is to rate movies on a scale from good to excellent.""
Jay--""What if I don't like them?""
Duke--""That's what 'good' is for.""

Quite possibly my favorite episode in the entire series comes from the first season, the sixth episode ""Eyes on the Prize"". Within that episode, Jay writes an essay whose words can be applied to today's Hollywood output just as it could in 1994-95 (in a sequence spoofing the climax of Mr. Smith Goes to Washington):
""I am a movie critic by trade, and until recently, I got paid to tell you people which movies merely stink and which ones you shouldn't screen near an open flame. Well, I'm putting the burden of lousy movies back on you. It's very simple: if you stop going to bad movies, they'll stop making bad movies. If the movie used to be a TV show, just don't go. After Roman numeral II, give it a rest. If it's a remake of a classic, rent the classic....[Some time later.] Tell them you want stories about people, not a hundred million dollars of stunts and explosives. People, it's up to you. If the movie stinks, just don't go.""

Granted, when looked at today, some of the jokes can seem a bit dated. These include anything with political figures at the time, be they Dan Quayle, Bill Clinton, George H.W. Bush, Mario Cuomo, or Michael Dukakis. There's also the idea that some of the jokes involving movies might be funny to only the film buffs among us. Other than that, the series concluded with a clip show, never a good way to end a TV series no matter the genre. Still, ""The Critic"" proves to be two things that the crop of Seth MacFarlane, ""South Park"", and ""Bob's Burgers""--among other recent animated sitcom fare--are not, nor will they ever be unless lightning strikes twice: smart AND funny. This show, in the words of Jay himself, gets my highest rating, 8.5 out of ten.",1381363200,3,9125,4.823754789272031

While this show doesn't ""stink"" I thought it was fairly hit or miss much of the time, with many of the episodes having a similar theme to them. Jay wasn't even the funniest person on the show IMHO. However, while the Critic wasn't the most short-lived show in history it's still too bad it had an uphill battle pretty much the whole time it was on the air. Since many who worked on the show also worked on the Simpsons I personally think it would've been nice if Jay were to become a re-occurring character there, such as at least once a season like Sideshow Bob. He was already a known character there so writing him in, claiming he was kicked out of NY or something, would be simple to pull off. If not the Simpsons than perhaps the other Matt Groening show, Futurama.

The writing is clever, the one-liners are as precisely quick as needed, and it just has the kind of practiced, pleasant pacing you just don't get from your Spongebobs or your Adventure Time, or just about anything that's been on Cartoon network for the past five years.

1842473,5,B00008EY6Q,"I must caution that reader that this is going to be a long review.  I know that many before me have already stated the basic gist of this show as well as most of the main characters.  Therefore, aside from a few areas those things will not be discussed. Also, for the most part I'm going to avoid things like: the cast, the animation, the criminally short run for this amazing show by two networks, the special features, the similarities to ""the Simpsons"" or ""Family Guy"" and the like. Instead, I'll focus on the unique merits of this show (movie jokes and emotional weight) and how to gauge for yourself if this show is worth your time.

As is fitting of a show called ""The Critic"", a great portion of the jokes and plots are somehow movie related.  Movie references and parodies abound in this show.  It's often commented that this makes the show feel dated.  And while I understand that, I can't accurately judge how true that is because I'm a huge cinefile! While I did get the majority of the references, there were some even I didn't get.  But for me that wasn't a problem.  I think the best way to show the nature of this show's movie jokes is to give you two example: one which anyone can get and one only a true cinefile like myself would get.

1. ""Rabbi P.I."": A movie starting Arnold Schwarzenegger as ""a Chicago cop who goes under cover as a Hasidic Jew"". After being told by a mugger to ""eat lead"", Arnold applies before blasting him with a shotgun, ""Sorry, that's not kosher!""  Now if you have any idea who Schwarzenegger is, you'll laugh at the parodies of his over-the-top action movies.

2. After a very brief scene in which after seeing a Asian face with a rice field behind him we hear Jay say something close to, ""He should go back to the acting fields!"" For someone to get this joke, they must know that despite not being an actor Haing S. Ngor won the Academy Awards' best supporting actor award for his largely autobiographical role in the 1984 film ""The Killing Fields"".

But not all the comedy requires a great knowledge of cinema, for example there's a scene where two cops instantly pursue a car because the driver is black (the driver just happens to be black director Spike Lee but that's not needed to get the joke). Also, there are so many bits of brilliance that could be totally unmoved from a show that makes fun of movies. ""Penguins can't fly!"", ""Green peaness"", and ""There even better when your dead!"" are the ones that come to mind but there are many more.

With what I have just described, I was set to love this show and then I discovered something that pushed this show from really good to one of my all-time favorites! I realize that what I'm about to say might over-hype the show for some but so be it.  Said discovery is that I became genuinely emotionally invested with these characters to a degree that almost no t.v. comedy show has made me.

There was plenty of that in the ABC episodes, mainly in the pilot episode and the one where Martin gets a crush on a girl from Cuba. I'm not sure if it was more the great writing or great voice acting but I was really rooting for these two even though I knew logically it wouldn't work.  But then at the start of the FOX episodes we are introduced to Alice, a good-hearted woman and single mother who becomes Jay's assistant. More importantly, she is the first woman who actually loves Jay.  I must stress something at this point.  In principle and almost always in practice, the introduction of a ""straight"" woman to soften and humanize a wacky central character really bugs me. The best example of this is the Marx Brothers, where unbelievably brilliant comedians of anarchy were softened and eventually overshadowed by bland couples of ""a guy nobody cares about and a girl nobody cares about""!  And I must admit on paper, what happens in ""the Critic"" seems run-of-the-mill. But with Jay and Alice (I'm not sure if it's the voice acting, the writing, or some cosmic alignment of stars), this feels totally organic and makes me mad that ""the Critic"" only lasted a little longer before going off the air for good. I would've loved to have seen those two in more situations together and develop. With the exception of ""the Simpsons"" during its best years, ""the Critic"" is the only animated comedy of this type that caused me to become emotionally invested with the characters and care about them in any sense other than making me laugh.

The best example of this and how it fuses perfectly with great humor is my favorite episode of ""the Critic"", ""Lady Hawke"". Once again, on paper this is a scenario that we've seen done to death: a new attractive lady comes in and forces our leading man and lady to realize and reveal their hidden feelings for each other.  But once again, ""the Critic"" through some magic makes it work.  Part of that comes from genuinely side-splitting bits including the reaction of a Chinese restaurant to seeing Jay in the window (""It's the monster with many mouths! Kill the lights!!"") and when a fast-food employee in a chicken costume is cornered by a hungry Jay (""You want a piece of me fatboy, I'LL SPORK YOUR ASS""!!).

The other reason is an real emotional weight that's greater than the sum of the show's parts. Take for example the scene in which Jay realizes which women he wants. A parody of Casablanca is projected before Jay and we see the ""lady hawke"" of the title (who by the way isn't at all a bad person) getting on the plane as she says goodbye and flies away. Then we see a figure emerge from the smoke-covered background. In color, contrasting the black and white of Casablanca, we see Alice appear and confess her love. Then Jay finds the real Alice and read her a poem, which (despite having a forced ""Super-freak"" reference) really moved me. I've hated most of the  romantic comedies and dramas that I've seen so it's saying something when this, a animated comedy, got to my core and left me feeling that strange happy sadness for a while after the episode ended.

There are many, many more reasons why this is a show that deserves to be seen by many more people as well as to be put back on the air.  But I thought it was best to talk about these two features for very different reasons: the first to give people some idea of the humor style of this show and second to praise and make others aware of a shocking element almost none have given the attention it deserves.",1328313600,2,6403,4.493540051679586

1842502,3,B00008EY6Q,"The Critic is one of the most misunderstood series on its genre and a pioneer for recent cartoon series in many ways, but what happened after the first season explains why it lasted only for a couple of more years and then disappeared into oblivion, becoming a cult-like series with a handful of followers

In my opinion, the series started season one brilliantly, with not much care about the quality of the drawings or the cartoon itself -on purpose I believe- but amazingly good on the script, with great jokes, a witty dark humor and Jay Sherman as the epitome of the money making but still loser New Yorker that dumps its frustrations on dumb Hollywood movies, which granted are lame, but also is his life. This love-hate relationship with Hollywood was the centerpiece of a show that relied more on the strong characters itself that in the way they interacted with each other. Flowing more like a talk-show with very smart joke bursts than like a long term story was ironically part of its early success but was also its demise: It's very hard to give a series a long life based on this structure, so producers decided to go for a change -even a network change- and killed the series in the process

Along came season two and the series was moved from ABC to Fox. Immediate changes to the drawings of the characters and the overall look of the cartoon were very noticeable, making it look more Simpson-like and flowing visually better for some, but for me it took away the ingenuity of the first season, as it tried to go mainstream by giving the series a more contemporary look. Even if this was a mistake I could have lived with, the writers started to move away from the spontaneous burst and unstructured timing of the jokes and decided to give Jay Sherman's life more meaning, introduced stronger relationships among the characters and gave some holding under the feet of Jay with the introduction of Alice, a woman that finally and regrettably for me, fell in love with Jay Sherman for real, not to use him or just because she couldn't find something better. This effort to make Sherman less of a loser and position the series for a longer term tenure got away with the creativity of the first season, the dark humor and the smart writing, to give way instead to trying to make us laugh by seeing Jay Sherman being hit by a plant pot several times in the head and then falling down the stairs, singing and dancing -regrettably with success- like a clown with an accordion and moving his fat butt in front of a camera while wearing a fancy suit and dark shades. The series went from the well thought and clever level of the first season to the very stupid and lame situations of the second season, ironically becoming like the same Hollywood movies he was criticizing. As the series transformed into a bad Hollywood cartoon, it slowly lost its entire initial luster and it was cancelled. To me, it stopped appealing to its initial audience while it failed to capture enough followers for its new structure. It just felt horribly flat. Contrary to what some think here, it was not cancelled because it was too smart, it was cancelled because it tried to become what it wasn't from the beginning and failed on the attempt. Sadly, it morphed from a worthy Monty Python type initial effort to a bad Jim Carrey movie",1236556800,16,3322,4.600337268128162

1842505,3,B00008EY6Q,"The first season is kind of hit or miss. It goes back and forth between being really great and pretty mediocre. The Critic doesn't really hit its stride until the second season (well actually, the last episode of season one), which is common with many shows, but unfortunately the Critic only has two season so it renders almost half the show kind of dull.

There are a few gems in the first season, but it suffers from a lot of lame jokes, and a lot of not-so-bad jokes ruined by poor timing and/or delivery. The plots also go back and forth between ""pretty interesting"" to ""who cares.""

The animation in season one is also not terrible but not great either, the most startling thing about it is there are two art styles at work. Most of the main characters are done in a very cartoony style while a lot of the background and side characters are done in a slightly more illustrative and realistic style, creating for some odd scenes where the main characters end up looking like midgets.

All of these problems are more than made up for in the second season however, as everything takes a (almost startlingly) sharp turn upwards. The writing and comedic timing greatly improve, as does the art, which benefits for a general increase in quality and settling on a single style. The characters also become more developed and interesting. It's still not perfect, but the improvements are enough to make the first season retroactively more likable, because you know there are better things to come.

The only thing about the second season that did not improve was Jay's sister Margo, who in the first season was one of the most interesting and likable characters, in both personality and character design. (She was one of the few regulars done in the illustrative style, which in contrast to my previous complaint worked very well for her character.) The changes to the show's style are most obvious in her as she ends up looking like a completely different character in season two. She also fades into the background plot-wise, going from a pretty central character in season one to hardly being around in season two (presumably to make room for the shows new female lead, Alice).

Overall it's a pretty good show that got canceled before it could live up to it's full potential. If you are seeing it for the first time I would recommend watching season two first, because that's the part worth watching.",1220313600,3,2401,4.707142857142857

1842525,2,B00008EY6Q,"Obviously many people loved this show (it's premature demise making them cling all the more dearly to it). If you've aleady seen the show land like it (or love it), skip this review. There are plenty of glowing reviews that will confirm you opinions.

I came to the how as a fan of the Simpsons and it's many offspring. Reading all the above-mentioned positive reviews made me--a sucker for anything touted as a lost classic--think I'd missed something great in the 1990s.

The one positive thing I can say about the show is that the animation backgrounds are done with a unique and impressionistic flair. I can't say the same about the character designs or the fluidity of motion, but the backgrounds are nice and worth noticing.

But the writing...it's mediocre. I found the humor less subtle than South Park and Beavis and Butthead, to say nothing of the Simpsons and Family Guy. It's not that this is a crude show ('Beavis' and 'Southpark' are more than simply crude), it's just that the jokes are obvious most of the time. And they are never followed up with additional twists they way that can happen with the Simpsons.

The supporting characters (including Doris the makeup lady; the redneck boss guy; the Crocodile Dundee-esqe Australian pretty-boy actor) almost collapse under the weight of the stereotypical behavior, accents and punchlines they labor under. (I'll make an exception for Jay's uber-WASP father, who kind of foreshadows Lois of the Family Guy's parents.)

The best moments are the send-ups of Hollywood flicks that Jay critiques, but these are much too few and far between. I made it through disc one, and when on the first episode of disc two they couldn't even make Los Angeles seem funny, I gave up. Sitting through these things with half a smile on your face hoping for just one or two funny moments isn't worth your time. Some episodes, the funny moments never came. Maybe it got better later on.

I was [...] in 1994 when it premiered, and [...] in 1995 when it was cancelled.  Believe it or not, I don't remember the ABC run--just the Fox run.  My brother and I watched this from start to finish, and then in reruns for about two years when we got Comedy Central in 1996.  I remember we used to sit up on Sunday nights to watch the reruns on Comedy Central from 10:30-11:00 before we went to bed during [...] (1996-1997).  what was wierd about that arrangement is that we rarely watched it in the same room--he'd be in his room, and I'd be in mine--but we both always laughed at the same jokes.  Every now and then, I'd go in his room and watch--we always had a great time watching this show together.  I liked all the eps the same, and Jon Lovitz is one of my favorite comedic actors--definitely one of my fave ""SNL"" alums.

My mom always thought Duke looked like Hulk Hogan--but he definitely mirrored Ted Turner.

One of my favorite moments was when Duke had the fly embryos injected in his eye, so he was over 4000 pounds of pure Sherman, to which Jay did his little Hebrew song and funny dance.  And anything Jay's dad did was hysterical (I remember when he was lifted to the podium--just like Dukakis in '88--golden).

The movie parodies are indeed the highlight of these episodes- The Silence of the Lambs becomes Honey I Ate The Kids while cute Dennis The Menace becomes the tough Dennis The Menace 2 Society (there are many more, I assure you).

1842542,5,B00008EY6Q,"If you came to this page, you either are 1) a fan of Jon Lovitz, 2) a fan of other cartoons, or 3)very lost.  Unfortunately, a lot of people fell in the third category when flipping through channels in the mid-1990s, missing one of the greatest TV shows of all time.  Yes, The Critic is that good!  It is a sharp, biting comedy that never got the ratings or respect it deserved.

From those that brought you the Simpsons, co-creators Al Jean and Mike Reiss developed a comedy that is basically the Jon Lovitz version of Homer Simpson.  The animation of the show is different, but the comedy is as witty.  Where The Critic differs from the Simpsons is in 1)less focus on socio-political issues--The Critic focused on making fun of the entertainment industry, and 2)the lack of a family.  Lovitz's Jay Sherman is a divorced, middle aged film reviewer with a son.  Sherman is the focus of the majority of the episodes, and as a result the plots did not require the creation of a large cast of characters.

But, if you like Jon Lovitz, then the focus on Jay Sherman is not a negative. Jay Sherman the character was built for Lovitz, and Lovitz played the part well.  Sherman is a short, balding, overweight, irritable, and somewhat depressed character (especially in season one).  His failures and negative traits are part of the plots of the episodes--from ""running"" a marathon to his bad luck with women.  Like the Simpsons, The Critic builds its comedy in laughing at their characters but empathizing with them nonetheless.

For those familiar with Lovitz's great acting talents, it is especially evident in The Critic.  The writers on the show allow Lovitz to highlight his operatic singing ability as well as his trademark...well...Jewishness.  Although Sherman is adopted, the writers make it crystal clear that Jay Sherman is Jewish.  Although the show is plenty funny for a Gentile, if you are Jewish you appreciate more of the jokes.  Sherman dancing and singing in fake Yiddish, the Howard Stern/Lion King sketch with the background cast singing ""Shalom Alechem,"" and on and on...some of the Critic's jokes are geared to an extent to Jewish humor...and Lovitz plays it well.  Nevertheless, The Critic is an equal opportunity comedy.  Celebrites are parodied (with particular focus on Orson Wells and the stereotypical action star), Fidel Castro makes an appearance, Jay's WASPy adopted parents are foils, and a Eastern European student at the U.N. School gets laughed at in an episode for performing a native song with the lyrics ""Tee-Pee Tee-Pee Pee-Pee Poo-Pee.""  No one is safe on The Critic.

Problematically, some of the jokes and parodies are dated.  When Jay Sherman reviews films (actually the parodies of films), a teenager today may not recognize some of the films.  Silence Of The Lambs seems dated, even today.  To that end, The Critic does not age nearly as well as The Simpsons, which focuses more on universal themes.

The DVD offers all episodes from its three seasons on FOX, ABC, and Comedy Central (unfortunately the show was cancelled twice), as well as the short episodes that appeared online a few years ago.  The extras on the DVD are fairly limited, as are the number of commentaries.  Regrettably, Jon Lovitz did not appear in ANY episode commentary, which is bizzare considering he did show up in Simpsons DVD commentaries!  Nevertheless, Al Jean and Mike Reiss do a great job in providing additional insight and laughs on the commentaries.

For the Simpsons or Jon Lovitz fan, The Critic is a must own.  As Sherman says on the DVD cover, ""It Stinks!""...but you'll love every minute.",1134864000,,3615,4.878688524590164

It is especially enjoyable to see these episodes uncut and without commercial interruptions.

1842544,5,B00008EY6Q,"I don't think I need to explain how funny The Critic is, everyone here has to know. The Critic was a cartoon made awhile back and yet didn't stick around long enough. I am upset that the cartoon did end and they hardly ever show it on tv as reruns anymore so finally I just looked around to see if it was on DVD and sure enough I found it and did not hesitate buying it. I've always loved this cartoon when I saw it on tv, especially the fat little pig epidsode. That is probably the funniest Critic epidsode made, but honestly they're all funny. This cartoon was one of the funniest shows I have watched, it was like a cartoon that was not overly stupid nor overly intelligent, just right in between, like a cartoon should be. Some cartoons are too dumb though and some are too intelligent, making it a boring way to watch a cartoon show, but the Critic is a good balance and I think that's why I love it the most.

The jokes are downright funny too. I love how they make fun of Jay Sherman's weight all the time (he is the Critic) like when he jumped on this waterbed on his honeymoon with his first wife and he blew out all the hotel windows with the water from the bed. Then they're always making fun of celebrities and films in real life and those are just so funny. The characters are great and humorous in their own way, but it is always Jay Sherman and his makeup lady Doris that bring the most humor, and great runners up is Jay's boss and also his father (who is a little on the nutty side).

Growing up in this world, we all need a little humor once and awhile from like a bad day. Well when I pop in the Critic DVD on one of these hateful days, I am laughing in less than a few minutes. This cartoon is just that good. The fat little pig epidsode though has to be the best from that entire cartoon, it is just too funny.

More importantly it still very funny.

1842547,4,B00008EY6Q,"The Critic falls into the same gone-before-their-time comedy shows of my past - The State, Family Guy, Sifl and Olly, and the underrated Chimp Channel. Okay, with the exception of the Chimp Channel, it has seemed for years without fail, any show that I found humor in was quickly axed. I had just discovered the Critic when it disappeared, lingering around in syndication before going to join the televised wreckage heap of the past.

But thanks to DVD, the Critic has returned to the small screen, and for some who actually remember the show, this is a good thing. For those who don't, know what you're getting into before somebody recommends this show...like me.

Fans of the Simpsons or Family Guy will feel as if they've entered an alternate, if eerily similar, TV dimension. The show centers around a fat loser, Jay Sherman (a despised movie critic voiced by Jon Lovitz, essentially playing himself). But, unlike Homer or Peter Griffin, Jay isn't stupid - far from it. And, true to real life, nobody likes a know-it-all. Jay suffers from a near total lack of respect, an inability to attract women, and a whole host of other life issues that would crush a non-cartoon character to death, including a spiteful ex-wife and an abusive boss. But Jay weathers the slings and arrows with snappy one-liners and more ""I'm fat!"" and ""I'm Jewish!"" jokes than anyone should be forced to endure over a 22-minute stretch. But he is ultimately a funny character, and highly sympathetic.

The rest of the cast is good, but not great. The late Doris Grau does an amazing turn as Jay's embittered, chain smoking personal stylist, while Gerrit Graham (as Jay's insane father, Franklin) and Charles Napier (as Jay's Ted-Turner-like boss Duke) both do marvelous work with their characters. The rest of the characters, while having occasional fun moments, are a supporting cast in every sense of the word 'supporting'. The show truly centers around Jay, and thus has less flexibility to pursue different character story-lines, like when the Simpson do a ""Lisa"" episode or the Family Guy might do a ""Brian"" episode. All Critic episodes are above and beyond Jay episodes, though this isn't necessarily a bad thing.

The animation changes noticeably from Season 1 to Season 2, starting out with extremely muted, earthy colors. Remember how trees were predominately purple in the Simpsons for a while? Well, the people responsible for coloring the early Critic were in love with greens, grays, and browns, so the visual style of the first season is a bit drab. Season 2 looks more lively, with brighter colors and main characters getting slight makeovers. The look always tends towards realism, except for the actual people, who have a stylized look without a central theme, a different take than that in (I apologize for my 15th ""Simpsons"" reference here) the Simpsons, where most characters share Matt Groening's googly-eyes and overbite look.

The writing is usually top-notch, if a little heavy on the afore-mentioned fat and Jewish jokes. There's plenty of satire and social commentary, though nothing too heavy-handed. The show's funniest moments come during Jay's reviews of movies, which are themselves hilarious parodies of actual movies, usually in the form of a sequel to a film that needed, or couldn't possibly have had, a sequel. I wouldn't recommend the series for these short segments alone, but they help ground the show and add a fresh change from the usual story-driven fare.

So, overall, if the idea of yet another smart-alecky cartoon show rooted in those carefree days of the late 90's appeals to you, give the Critic a try. Not every episode is sure-fire funny, but there are enough funny episodes to make this a worthwhile collection.",1117411200,,3739,4.9744
1842567,5,B00008EY6Q,"As much as I liked 'The Critic' I didn't run out and buy it right when it came out.  Though there are plenty of shows out there that I've watche more than this, I've probably watched 'The Critic' more per episode than any other one.(Well, 'The Simpsons' may still beat it, but nothing else, for sure) Also, the rerun schedule on Comedy Central had grown increasingly sporadic, so I hadn't actually seen it all that much the last couple of years, and I wasn't sure it was gonna hold up.  I eventually got it a couple months late, and it turns out that I like it about as much as ever.  Admittedly, it does have a few problems, particularly a couple running jokes that are kinda weak. (Too many fat jokes, easter island kid etc.)  Also, Jay isn't that great of a main character.  Pretty decent, but not as good as the central characters for an animated show generally ought to be.  Still, most of the film parodies are fairly classic, and it's got a first-rate cast of secondary characters, which is easily the most imporatant thing for an animated show.  Duke and Franklin are particularly good, with a succesful joke-rate startlingly close to 100%.  It's too bad it didn't stay on the air longer, as it usually takes a while to develop a full cast, and they were just getting around to really doing it when they got cut off.

Anyway, there are only 23 episodes, but their isn't a genuine dud in the bunch, and they've all stood up to many, many repeat viewings over the years.  It's a pleasant looking show, a nice contrast to the irriating, jagged and bloated animation that seems to dominate television nowadays, and the voice acting is first rate.

For those of you who have never seen it, it's sort of comparable to ""Family Guy,"" with plots completely inconsequential to the enjoyment of an episode.  The funniest segments are always the movie ""trailers"" (""Brown Acres"" and ""Rabbi P.I."" being the best, in my opinion).  And for a show that's ten years old, it's aged remarkably well, and I laughed just as hard at the jokes.

This box set includes every episode of the series, as well as commentaries.  My favorite episode by a long shot is ""Siskel & Ebert & Jay & Alice,"" which includes one of the funniest moments in television history- Gene Siskel and Roger Ebert getting into a fistfight, and then duetting on a love song.

The box set also features ""webisodes,"" previously available only on the Internet, that feature Jay Sherman ""reviewing"" more recent films.  They are actually very funny, and I had no idea they existed until I got this.

Seriously, when I first got the series I could hardly make it through the first disc--it was that gnawingly difficult to watch. Several months later I decided to pick it up and blow the dust off, offering it just another chance to see if could rattle my attention. It failed once again.

There is just something about the show that never grabs you. Let's not forget that it is supposed to be funny. It isn't. A friend who stumbled into watching the show remarked that they literally kept forgetting to laugh when the punchlines were delivered--it is hard not to have your mind wander elsewhere while watching the show.

Overall, the series simply didn't make the cut. The quality all around was never delivered though the one thing that is perhaps decent enough was the voice acting. Decent mind you, not fantastic.

Should you buy this against my recommendation and the glowing five star reviews that fill the pages surrounding this one? Yes--if you suffer from insomnia or do not have a funny bone in your body in the first place, this may be an appropriate purchase for you. Otherwise, PLEASE spend your money on something more worthwhile. With so many other good animated series available these days, this is one that is not deserving of your attention.",1100649600,11,1744,4.8
1842572,5,B00008EY6Q,"Like most Simpsons watching fanatics that are also latched tightly to the Family Guy, I couldn't help but walk (never run) to buy this series when it came out.  Jay Sherman is my inspiration for my excessive amounts of film reviews.  He was never afraid to speak his mind about the garbage distributed by Hollywood ever week.  His classic line, ""It stinks"" inspired me to find those horrible films and make sure I warned others before it was too late.  He is a God among Gods in my book!

Created by the same team that did The Simpsons, Sherman great to life through not only the witty banter that leapt from his mouth, but also his surrounding characters.  Parodying some of cinema's finest, you cannot help but laugh at this obese critic that wants nothing more than to have respect and eat his Charleston Chew.  Duke Phillips is one of the funniest characters created and provides some of the funniest social commentary on the extremely wealthy in our country.  Sherman, in my eyes, represents the little man.  While making $270,000 a year, he doesn't rise above anyone else.  He reminds all of us of who we are, whether it would be running a marathon or trying to clean-up his hometown of New York, Sherman represents our desires and wants.  One of our biggest desires is to see good cinema.  We pay top dollar to see good movies, why does Hollywood continually fill our plate with all the bread we can eat before giving us the main course?  Suddenly, we are too full to enjoy it.

I would like to applaud Jay Sherman for his fight against a repetitive and uncreative Hollywood.  As an avid filmgoer it is nice to see the battle being fought in the animated world.  Sadly, I only wish this series could have lasted long enough to endure some of the garbage released today.  We need a new Jay Sherman to help us wade through and poke fun of today's Hollywood.

I HIGHLY recommend this series to anyone that is as upset with Hollywood as I.  This series will make you laugh at a large man that loves food and life.  He is our, and especially my, hero!

1842587,4,B00008EY6Q,"I first caught The Critic on FOX when I was in high school, and although it was canceled, I was pleased to see that Comedy Central picked up the reruns a few years ago.  This underrated show, like many others, was simply a victim of politics among network executives.  One of the commentators on this DVD (I forget who) quoted Jonny Carson as saying, ""TV is only medium that eats its young"", and that's very true in this case.  Fortunately The Critic developed enough of a following to be released on DVD, and so I will now review the DVD itself.
Episodes - 5/5 - Great lines, characters, stories, and movie parodies.  The visual gags (such as the cartwheeling hampster) and sign jokes (United Nations School: Teaching Tolerance and Brotherhood To Those Who Can Afford It) have rivaled those on the Simpsons and Futurama.  The animation has a unique and naturalistic look that works very well: the people and places feel real.  Also, the writing and the acting are quite solid.
Commentaries - 3/5 - The commentators are witty and informative, but my main complaint is that there are only eight episodes with commentaries.  I would have enjoyed commentaries on all of the episodes.  The other problem is that when I played the commentaries, the sound wasn't as good, and I had to turn the volume way up, not only to hear the episode, but to hear Charles Napier and Nick Jameson, who often talk softly.
Subtitles/Language Options - 0/5 - There are no subtitles at all, which is particularly irritating when trying to listen to the commentary tracks.  And despite the FBI warnings being in both English and French, the audio is only in English.
DVD package/menues - 2/5 - The outer package has little info about the DVD's contents.  There is a booklet inside that lists the episodes, but doesn't list the special features.  The DVD menues are simplified (for instance, there are no submenues for each episode).  Episodes with commentary available only have an asterisk in the Episode Selection Menu, and the names of the commentators are not shown, only spoken.
Special Features - 5/5 - I was pleasantly surprised with the extras on this DVD.  They've included all ten of the internet shorts from 2000, which were cool to watch.  I particularly enjoyed the ""Making of the Critic"" featurette, which contained interviews with Mike Reiss, Al Jean, Jim Brooks, Rich Moore, Maurice La Marche, and Nick Jameson.  I like being able to finally match up a face with a voice!  Also, the episode ""A Pig-Boy and His Dog"" had a few scenes where you could view the storyboards and animatic along with the full color animation all on the same screen, which Rich Moore commentating.  Finally, I got a kick out of the ""Fun Facts"" and ""Movie Trivia"" bits.
Overall, I give this DVD 4 stars because I feel the quality of the episodes and special features outweight the problems with the DVD, mainly the lack of subtitles and too few commentaries.  Fans of this show, as well as fans of The Simpsons, Futurama, and Dilbert, should definitely get this DVD.",1084752000,8,3031,4.740952380952381

He works for a Ted Turner-esque boss, help raise his son, deals with a bitter ex-wife and later gets a sweet girlfriend (voiced by Park Overall). Especially funny are Jay's gravel-voiced makeup lady Doris, who tells it like it is, and his 'eccentric' father who glues the silver to the ceiling and talks to penguins, amongst other things.

1842590,4,B00008EY6Q,"The Critic is the television program I know best.  I loved it when first appeared in the early 90s on ABC, and continued to love it on Fox and in reruns on Comedy Central.  The pop culture references mixed in with Simpsons-inspired craziness simply made this perfect television program for me.
For those who were paying attention in the early 1990s, the Critic shined some hilarious and downright silly light on popular things of the time.  If you've seen the show on Comedy Central, you know whether or not this DVD is for you.  If you like making fun of now almost-archaic pop-culture from the 1990s, you'll enjoy this.
If you're looking at this DVD, you've probably enjoyed the show already.  Every episode is intact, though the quality is sketchy.  First season episode's brightness, contrast, and even color balance seem somewhat questionable on my computer monitor.  The first season's colors look somewhat muddy, while the second season seems a little brighter and higher quality.  Did someone mishandle the original prints?
The commentary is quite good, with some interesting, fast-paced commentary discussing a wide variety of topics.  The writers seem quite intelligent and funny, all the more shame this show got cancelled.  They discuss whether Jon Lovitz really is like Jay Sherman in real life, the history of the show's acceptance, or lack thereof, on its networks, and even discussing the policies of FOX handling television programs: namely, how incomprehensible, off-putting, and detrimental re-arranging schedules can be to a show's success.
The writers even mention when they recorded the commentary; the day of California's gubernatorial vote, which Governor Schwarzenegger won and whose election the writers predict.  Am I declaring the commentators psychic?  No, otherwise they could have avoided The Critic's failure.  Hatchie matchie!
It's simply a joy to see this wonderful show getting some wide distribution.  Here's to hoping to a future version of the DVD with higher quality video, commentaries for every episode with even more of the cast, and maybe real-life video interviews with the writers and cast.

Well, fans of the show do.  All six of them.  The show came and went at a time when every network was trying to emulate the success of the Simpsons.
So how does a show made in 1994 hold up?  It's as good as it was in 1994.  That not really saying all that much.
The show was not funny when it fist came out and it's not getting any funnier.  The writing is labored and the jokes are few.  It is shocking because the writers and creators were for the most part pooled from the Simpsons.
The great waste of the show that it had all of Hollywood as a target but it spent way too much time with the hopelessly unlikable cast and it's looser star than taking shots at movies.
The DVD allows the few fans of the show to see the show in all it's ""glory"".  Actually the animation is not all that good and the transfer looks very muddy/blurry.
The commentary is the saving grace of the DVD set.  It's good as the creators are honest about how the show failed, giant boxes of hate mail and the mistakes they made.  Refreshing.

1842594,5,B00008EY6Q,"The Critic is the brainchild of Al Jean and Mike Reiss (producers of The Simpsons) and is produced by Gracie Films, also of Simpsons fame. It was a highly intelligent and very funny show that made fun of movies, Hollywood, TV stations at the same time as giving us a sympathetic hero and the whacky world he lives in.

Jay Sherman is short, fat, bald and dresses like dweeb, his ex-wife hates him, his boss is always on his back, women run from him in terror and his make-up lady humiliates him at every given opportunity. He's also voiced by the increasingly adorable Jon Lovitz and has one of the best catchphrases ever. HOTCHIE MOTCHIE!!!!!

The supporting characters are equally hilarious. Jay's crazy dad is always up to some kind of insanity. His pal Jeremy Hawke (star of the controversial and highly blasphemous Crocodile Gandhi movies) is always featured in some sort of dumb action movie clip. Even his tummy has a 'feed me' voice of its own. Though the honors go to Charles Napier, who is absolutely priceless as Jay's megalomaniacal, all-American hard-man boss.

It's hard to believe ABC ditched this after ONE EPISODE!!! What were they thinking? Even Fox eventually gave up on it. Sad considering how sharp the writing and humor was. How on earth does self-indulgent, over-rated and long, long past prime trash like Friends gets 10 seasons and The Critic gets 23 episodes. You won't find Jay Sherman all but winking at the camera or pausing until the fake laughter dies down.

This complete set comes with a fair amount of extras (the cinema screen trivia cards are great) but the best is fact that we get all the 'webisodes'. In 2000 Jay made a brief comeback on the internet and all those 5 minute shows are featured on the 3rd DVD. My only complaint is, after 22 brilliant episodes, it kind of dies out with an obnoxious and annoying 'clip show' than a proper end-of-season finale. Minor complaint nonetheless.

The shows are all presented in 1.33:1 fullscreen, as drawn with a good Dolby 2.0 soundtrack. If Family Guy can come back through strong DVD sales then let's hope the same for The Critic. Now only if Duckman would come to DVD...",1080432000,83,2155,4.705570291777188

1842607,5,B00008EY6Q,"The Critic is one brilliant animated TV show that suffered a fate that befell entirely too many other brilliant shows like Family Guy and The PJs.  These shows would be hyped up weeks before the first episode aired.  Then about 2-4 weeks into the series' first season (few of these shows lasted much longer than that), an entirely different series would air.  And thus, the series would be left in limbo for weeks, sometimes months before another episode made its way to its small, and impatient group of fans.  Because of this apathetic treatment from the networks, these shows were not given a sufficient opportunity to find an audience.  The Critic, which debuted on ABC in 1994, languished in this manner until Fox would pick it up a year later.  History would once again repeat itself on that network as well.  It's just shameful how not one, but two, networks could take such a clever, inventive show for granted.
The Critic is about a very short pudgy New York City film critic and divorced father named Jay Sherman (voiced by Jon Lovitz).  Sherman hates blockbuster films with a burning passion.  He makes his hatred known with two simple words: ""IT STINKS!!!"".  This makes him one of the least popular people in the city.  John Rocker may get the key to the city before Sherman does if that tells you anything.  Sherman's life is full of some interesting and sometimes oddball characters.  He comes from a rich family - his mother is a haughty aristocrat and his father is still recovering from a stroke, which is evident with his eccentric behavior.  The only other normal person in Sherman's family is his loving, but slightly insecure teenage sister.  Sherman's best friend is an Australian actor who is basically cross between Mel Gibson and Paul Hogan.  The actor stars in precisely the same big budgeted films that Sherman likes to pan.  And finally there's his boss, a Southern-bred media tycoon would love to cancel Sherman's hugely unpopular show for purely business reasons, but the tycoon for some reason likes having Sherman around.

What set The Critic apart from the other creative animated shows was how it would joke about cinema, much in the same way Family Guy would do to modern television, or how King of the Hill would do with rural stereotypes.  One of the funniest skits (Lord knows The Critic had a lot of them), involved a trailer with Arnold Schwarzeneggar in a Jewish-themed action film.  Arnold's new catch phrase was ""Haga Navilla, Baby!!!"".  Pure hilarity.
For those of you who can't get enough of these amazing animated shows like The Simpsons, Family Guy, and King of the Hill; you owe it to yourself to watch The Critic.  Once you've watched it, realize that it has been cancelled for nearly a decade, and see the sickening glut of reality shows that now reign over prime time with an oppresive fist - Don't be surprised to hear yourself saying this about the sickening state of 21st Century television: ""IT STINKS!!!""",1078272000,46,2960,4.785433070866142

I've read some reviews here on Amazon that said that it has aged.  It has with some of the jokes, but most of the movies, when you see the parody, you remember what it is they are making fun of.  Some jokes (like cracks at Rosanne) have aged, but not enough to ruin a great show.

1842626,4,B00008EY6Q,"The commentary alone makes the series worth the buy.  While they did more reminiscing and laughing, they did mention some juicy behind the scenes stuff.  It's nice to know why ABC cancelled the show (too racy), why FOX picked it up (make it racy), and why they cancelled it (they didn't own it and as such couldn't profit much from it - the show did have plenty of viewers...)
There's even a storyboard for an episode or two, these discs are jam-packed...
The DVD's episode order must be in production order as the airdate order is quite different...
I saw the FOX series halfway through its run and I loved it.  It was so fresh, so different, so atypical of mainstream drivel.  So naturally I'd love it.  I'd never seen the ABC series until purcashing the set.  I must say the ABC series is somewhat funnier and more relevant to/critical of the movie industry.
The ABC series, which started it all, has some great episodes.  The pilot sets it all up, followed by ""Miserable"" (it spoofs the movie ""Misery"" (as I think it was called) and has a lot of very funny moments), ""Marathon Mensch"", ""A Pig-Boy and His Dog"", ""Eyes on the Prize"" (my all time favorite), and ""Every Doris Has Her Day"".  There really isn't a clunker amongst the bunch.
The best FOX episodes to look out for are ""Chunk to Hunk"", ""Dukearella"", ""Ladyhawke"", ""All the Duke's Men"", and ""Frankie and Ellie get Lost"".  They come to mind as being utter classics, and the Star Trek TNG parody in ""Sherman of Arabia"" is NOT to be missed!  (it was so nice, at the time, to finally see somebody poke fun at a Star Trek show that wasn't about Kirk.)  And catch other episodes for the digs aimed at ABC, those are a real riot, especially the bit in ""Sherman of Arabia"" where Jay wants Alice and daughter Penny to watch 'wholesome ABC comedy'...  LOL!  You can bet your bippy I won't divulge its details, but it is hilarious!  The only real clunker from the FOX series is ""A Song for Margo"", though it had a few cute lines as well.  So watch that one last.  :-)  And while okay, the Siskel and Ebert episode seemed lackluster and ultimately became silly.  But that's just my impression, and I'm weird.
I won't mention the FOX season's clip show, featuring clips from the ABC season.  You can watch it, but it's pointless unless you haven't seen the ABC episodes.  Well, not really - the bits that aren't clips are funny, and you wouldn't believe who'd guest-starred...  so, it's worth watching too.  :-)
Ultimately, both seasons are highly witty and entertaining in their own ways, but they are slightly different in their approach.  But if you're a fan, you already know this!  :-)
Now why did I take off a star?
* Trailers.  I was expecting original commercials from ""The Critic"".  Not adverts for mainstream Sony shows I could care less about.  I want material RELEVANT to the show being sold, I'm sorry.  This is just a nitpick as I am tired of the industry throwing in promos for shows that I'll never watch, let alone care for.  Besides, how many people who like ""The Critic"" go for the mainstream stuff that everybody already knows about anyway, and would you EVER see ""The Critic"" trailers on some other DVD?  (if they took the time to even take a guess at what people buying DVD X would like, having specialized promos would be better than just shoving anything and everything at us.)  This is worth 1/2 star removal, mainly because I'm in such a good mood from critiquing the good points of this set.  :-)  So I won't see original Critic advertisements.  Oh well, applesauce happens.
* This one is not much of a quibble as I've seen far worse DVD image quality (think ""Three's Company"" season 1 as an example...):  ""Family Guy"" season 3 managed to squeeze 8 episodes on a disc and have virtually perfect video quality and had commentary as well.  How come ""The Critic"" has visible DVD compression in all the episodes?!  (do note, it is much easier to see this compression artifacting when you pause a frame, and I'll admit it's not as easy to spot here as it is in lower quality releases...)  In all honesty, considering everything jammed onto these three discs, the compression is not that bad and I've seen far worse in terms of picture quality.  So maybe this is worth 1/4 star.  Just another quibble, really.  I just wanted to add filler material.
At $34.95, this is a steal for fans and is easily worth the risk for anybody curious of the series.  It's well worth the money.  And I was stupid enough not to have checked Amazon.com first!  (I'd spent $44.95 elsewhere...  oops.  Even then, it's worth the price, but I rather like $35 over $45, don't you?)",1076112000,5,4624,4.543583535108959
1842627,4,B00008EY6Q,"It is just so unbelieveable to understand the fades of animation these days. Sincerely, there are just so many cartoon series based for adults that really seem to be overdubbed again and again. That goes with the case of The Simpsons, and King Of The Hill, as them being the most successful of all the animated series for adults. Yet, typically speaking, there is one zany one that is worth seeing all over again. The Critic was one those animated series that truly brought out the best in crude, but laughable humor for all ages, young and old. The story is about a single father, Jay Sherman, who works as a movie critic, and all the weirdness that is around his world, including the basis from his parents, who adopted Jay, and his crazy boss Duke. Still, the sense of humor fits right in.
The complete series DVD of The Critic consists of the only two channels that broadcasted whole episodes of the series, Fox and ABC. Arguably, the series was absoluely brillant and completely funny. Jon Lovitz, from Saturday Night Live fame, portrays the voice of the wacky Jay Sherman. The shows are just enjoyable, but does leave a whole lot of humor, from Jon and his parents who are the loose actual cannons, one of them who is sensible, but the other one that is drunk as a noose. Still, the show does evolve, Jay even more, including his humor as a critic, and some of the most outrageous things ever, including the episode where Duke, runs for president, and just makes so much of an ordeal, he actually controls the whole show, and the episode where Jay celebrates his a milestone show as the host of Coming Attractions, where they only shows clips of the films Jay reviewed. Unfortunately, that was the final episode of The Critic.
Untimately, this was one of the best animation series of its era. The Critic was just full of complete joy. All that I can say is that I absolutely suggest you get this boxed set of the entire series, The Critic. No matter what people think of other series out there, Jay Sherman just brings down the house. It Stinks, Not!!",1076025600,6,2057,4.547169811320755
1842628,3,B00008EY6Q,"The show is great, no complaints there.  I am however surprised that no one has mentioned anything about how poor the extras are.
There are no foreign language tracks despite warnings in French.  Why bother when there is no French language track.  No big deal as I don't speak French, I just found that odd.  The few ""extras"" I did check out turned out to be nothing more than advertizements for other TV show DVDs.
The worst part is that the back of packaging says that there is closed captioning.  When attempting to view the captions all I get is an error saying ""No captions recorded"".  There are no options in the DVD menu for turning on closed captions either.  I do not know if this is an error on the part of my DVD player (which displays captions for every other DVD I own), or they simply forgot to put the captions on.  Am I the only one that the captions don't work for, or am I the first to notice?
5 stars for the show
-2 stars for the DVD extras/presentations",1075939200,4,974,4.284153005464481
1842629,4,B00008EY6Q,"The Critic is an irreverent cartoon along the lines of the Family Guy and South Park.  It celebrates the love of the Celebrity and Pop Culture, and although not as abscure as the other two shows, it remains to be edgy and dark, with sometimes ridiculous slapstick moments.
There are some impressive, solid, and hilarious perfomances that never cease to stay true to the character being played.  The line between actor Jon Loviz and the educated but simple minded charecter of Jay Sherman is so blured that any other live action film with the former is hard to watch without imagining this cartoon.
It is true that the jokes and parodys of Hollywood Blockbusters littered throughout the series become a bit redundent.  However, the show has moments of gold that can't be ignored, and it remains to be one of the most sharp and relentless cartoons created in the ninties.",1075680000,,869,4.78
1842630,4,B00008EY6Q,"There are definitely some laugh-out-loud moments in this great set, but a surprising number of the jokes are already dated.  This show was always tied more to topical movies at the time, and that is why it seems to have gotten stale compared to Simpsons episodes, Family Guy, and Futurama.  Most of the movie jokes and parodies rely on one having seen the movies, or being very familiar with their plotlines.
Some celebrities are heavily parodied, and this can get a little repetitious.  Marlon Brando seems to be a staple, Orson Welles shows up several times, and Dudley Moore's Arthur character is more pitiful than funny.  There are some very good celebrity jokes, and others that just fill up time.
Some episodes, like the one where his parents are marooned on a desert island, are very good; others are just filler.  Jay's correspondent coverage of the First Gulf War is also a good episode. He ends up in a prison camp, sending a message by rat back to New York about his imprisonment.  When his boss sorts the mail...bills...rat from Jay...which is then tossed into an inbox full of message-bearing rats, also from Jay.
The difficulty with a current-event based show is that time marches on.  Siskel and Ebert jokes are less amusing with Gene deceased, and the same goes for Dudley Moore.  I realize that many of the parodies are based on deceased performers, but there's a difference when it's a contemporary performer.  I guess if you're going to mock the dead, they should be good and dead, not fresh.  Of course the New York skyline still has the World Trade Towers, as they were when the show was created.
Extras are minimal.  There is an option to ""Play All"" which is a great help.
Fun to watch occasionally, but it's never going to get watched as much as Futurama, which also mocked current events from a perspective well in the future, when everybody is either dead or a head in a jar.",1075593600,4,1900,4.658682634730539
1842631,5,B00008EY6Q,"I believe this is the best cartoon ever made...Maybe not for the animation aspects, but for the fact that the comedy in it is great. This show has the ability to kill you from laughing too hard. Fast, clever, witty, over-the-top Jon Lovitz type humor is what you get. The show is Classic in my book.",1075248000,,299,4.357142857142857
1842632,5,B00008EY6Q,"A line that sums up the brilliance of this show, that something so absurd can garner such a riotous amount of laughter.
I remembered watching each episode laughing constantly from beginning to end, a feat even ""The Simpsons"" couldn't muster.  And this show really was an example of ""burn out"" rather than ""fade away"" : it seemed that the writers wanted to do nothing more but just go for as many laughs as humanly possible.  From Jay Sherman's perfectly sarcastic portrayal by an astounding Jon Lovitz, to his insane dad (""I understand the silverware on the ceiling, but what about the dog?""  ""You understand the silverware??? Cuckoo!!!""), to the Klingon and Easter Island head children, they took risk after risk with the humor, and while some things weren't successful, it all piled on so much that if you weren't laughing at one thing, you were laughing at three others at once.  Sure it might not have had quite the endlessly endearing character of a Simpsons, or the more demented (though it was quite demented in its own right) stlyings of a Family Guy, or the top notch scripts of a Futurama, but in the end this show was about one thing: making you laugh until you hurt, and with the state of most common television, that is something truly commendable.  Don't overlook it for a (fourth?) time.",1075161600,5,1302,4.71806167400881
1842633,5,B00008EY6Q,"The Critic was a very misunderstood and underappreciated masterpiece.  Thanks to Comedy Central and recurrent bouts of insomnia I have not been without The Critic these many long years, but not a day went by where I didn't curse those responsible for the show's demise.  How could a show with so many writers, producers, and actors from The Simpsons last only two seasons....IDIOT executives, that's how.
