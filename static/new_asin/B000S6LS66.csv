2881405,5,B000S6LS66,"Spark of Insanity will have you laughing until your stomach hurts.  Jeff has tapped into his comedic genius and created a character so outrageously funny.  Move aside Peanut, Achmed the Dead Terrorist is now the top draw of the show.  This act alone is worth the cost of the DVD.  Highly recommended.",1190073600,,300,4.711538461538462
2881406,5,B000S6LS66,"... and it was HILARIOUS.  This video, like the last one, was done over two shows on the same night.  I'd gotten us tickets for the 7:00 show, then turned straight around and bought tickets for the 9:30 show.  Jeff and company have never disappointed me, and this was no different.  I heartily encourage buying this DVD - it was a terrific, memorable show.  Just wait for the Prius vs. Hummer opening monologue.  And, well, of course, everything after that...",1190073600,,459,4.675
2881407,5,B000S6LS66,"I was fortunate to see this show live in Newport Kentucky back in July and have been anxiously awaiting the release of the DVD.  Jeff and company are totally hilarious and I did not stop laughing the entire show.  I love a comedian that can bring on laughing tears.  Of course Walter is my favorite, but his new additions bring a new spark to the show.",1189555200,19,352,4.303030303030303
2881408,5,B000S6LS66,"Just got home from seeing Jeff perform this live. Some of the show will be from the David Letterman show skit with Walter With new material added. Just Funny stuff. Will have you in stitches or impaled ""On a Stick""",1187827200,4,214,4.375
2881409,5,B000S6LS66,"My husband and I just saw Jeff's show this past Saturday in Mass. It was fantastic! Achmed the Dead Terrorist is hysterical! He goes right to the edge with a politically sensitive subject. And, of course, Walter, Peanut, and Jose are just as great as ever. We have his first DVD and are always showing it to people who haven't been indoctrinated. No matter how many times we see it, we laugh just as hard as the first time. We are looking forward to this new DVD to have in our house when we need a Jeff 'fix'.",1187740800,23,510,4.214285714285714
2881410,5,B000S6LS66,Was at the show that this was filmed.  It was incredible and cannot wait to see it when it is released.  Jeff is great.  The DVD is a must see.  Alot of material not shown in the Comedy Central Special.,1187740800,5,202,3.975

2881413,5,B000S6LS66,"The character Melvin the super-hero has been seen before on Comedy Central a few years back.  Achmed is the only NEW character not seen on TV in the past.  My wife, brother-in-law, sister-in-law, and myself saw Jeff in San Jose when he debuted Achmed.  It's a fine line that is crossed with the whole terrorism thing, but I'm sure Jeff has since improved on the character.  I just hope he discusses his daughter and his powder blue Prius like he does in his Improv acts.",1186012800,2,470,4.4941176470588236

2881460,5,B000S6LS66,"Jeff is a talented comedian.  I've found that people either really like his material or really dislike it.  I enjoy his performances and especially Sparks of Insanity.  I recommend this product to anyone who enjoys laughing.  The different personalities his puppets mimic are spot one and results in different perspectives on common matters today.

2881737,4,B000S6LS66,There were points during the show where I could not breathe from laughing so hard. The bonus video of Jeff Dunham creating Melvin and of Walter announcing his run as president were hilarious. This DVD deserved five stars except for Jeff Dunham using foul language in front of a child. Also some of the jokes were a bit over the top in being crass. Mr. Dunham would be just as funny if he would lose the four-letter words and sex jokes.,1417132800,,435,4.382716049382716

2881785,4,B000S6LS66,"Pretty funny overall. Jeff did a lot of jokes at the beginning without using any of his characters and that was interesting. I laughed out loud plenty of times and was excited to see that this material was something that I haven't heard much of. I have SiriusXM radio and they play his stuff on there but I can't say that I remember hearing any of the stuff on this special anywhere else but on the special. The only downside that I would offer is that this takes place shortly before Jeff's divorce and the negativity towards his wife and marriage in general is quite apparent. If you don't want to taste some bitterness then don't watch this. If you can look past it then it is worth it.

This particular show features Jeff doing non-character jokes for about 15 minutes where he muses about his children and some of the funny things in life. His first character on this special is Walter which was very funny. After that, he produces Achmed the Dead Terrorist and I think it was the first time Jeff had used Achmed live. After that, Jeff brings out Melvin the Superhero guy and this section of the show was probably the slowest part of the show. Once Melvin goes away, he brings out Peanut and has a great section there. As usual, Jeff brings out Jose Jalapeo near the end of the Peanut section so that the two can engage in their infamous banter. At this point, Jeff closes out the show.

Overall, this was a good laugh and you will likely enjoy it if you like Jeff's style. I enjoyed all of it except the Melvin portion and some of the anti-marriage bitterness. Beyond that, it was a good laugh and well worth the time to watch it.",1405900800,,1636,4.378289473684211

Some of the routines, for example his 'super hero' character --name escapes me--went on a bit long, and the routine with Peanut made little if any sense to me, but the audience loved it. Walter and Achmed as usual were the funniest and Dunham succeeds in providing not only a voice for both but personalities as well!",1395619200,,435,4.518987341772152

It's like the house band that follows Aerosmith or Lady Ga Ga or some other great performer...  I had the expectation of more.

2881901,4,B000S6LS66,"The first 15 minutes of this seemed to drag out forever.  As a one-person comedian he is not funny.  When he utilizes his quirky puppets he is much funnier.  I think most people find it funny because of his ability to be a great ventriloquist.  I did enjoy the characters of the show.  I didn't care for Peanut the monkey...  he reminded me of a homosexual drag queen seeking attention.  Walter was funny because he is a grumpy old man.  Achkmed is pretty funny but a lot of the lines feel forced and it doesn't seem to be a naturally funny character.  I do like that Jeff tries to down play the fear of America towards terrorists by utilizing him in his sketches... good job for that. : )  Overall, very funny and worth sitting still for.",1379030400,,739,4.328467153284672

All the ""untouchables"" he not only touches, but tramples.  Actually, his puppets do the trampling and this somehow makes it funny and not mean.  Also, there is much adult humor and plenty of ""colorful"" language, so put the little ones to bed first.  These may be puppets, but trust me, this is NOT Sesame Street.

Jeff Dunham is a big exception.

Jeff Dunham (Jef-fa-fa) has achieved a level of comedy that most people in the biz can only dream of. This guy is amazingly funny. His clever characters are alive. They are in on the joke and make no bones about their self-knowledge. They know each other and themselves and they possess a self-awareness endowed by their creator. Far from worshiping Dun-ham, they tie into him and criticize his life choices.

No subject is sacred.

Achmed the Dead Terrorist is hardly the model for Political Correctness and Walter (who scares the crap out of Achmed) will never win any popularity contests.

And then there's Peanut. You cannot describe this creature though after seeing him you will try. Around the water cooler the next day you will vainly try to get across to your fellow workers just what made you laugh so hard the night before. Save you breath and bring the DVD in for all to see.

Unless you are intensely sensitive or extremely self-righteous, you will likely find yourself laughing out loud and hard. The humor may be at others expense, but it is also oddly friendly and warm.

Jeff Dunham has found a way to be as caustic as Don Rickles and as pleasant as Bill Cosby.

DO yourself a favor. Find a clip on YouTube, If it tickles youur funny bone come back here and order this DVD.

2882039,5,B000S6LS66,Again this is funny as heck. Would recommend to anyone over 16 because of the cussing factor. But you get so much more then what you see on the comedy channel.,1357344000,,159,4.161290322580645

2882072,3,B000S6LS66,This video is surely funny but in my opinion it is not as funny as Jeff Dunham: Arguing with myself. However it is classic Jeff Dunham and is worth watching.,1354060800,,157,4.266666666666667

2882076,5,B000S6LS66,"Dunham is a hoot.  Now, he gets a little politically incorrect, but he spreads it around, you can't take it seriously.  Very, very talented entertainer.  Uses 'puppets' as his hilariious characters.",1353715200,,198,5.32258064516129

2882078,5,B000S6LS66,"His second major show & as good as the first. Again, Walter is as crabby as ever & Peanut is still as hyper. And you can't help but love ""mad"" bomber Achmed who threatens to kill everyone unless they behave.

2882081,5,B000S6LS66,"I'd never heard of him until I accidentally landed on the Comedy Central airing of this program. I missed the first part, started watching when Walter came out. (I swear he looks exactly like one of the long-time members of Baytown Little Theater.) ""A-C-Phlegm"" Achmed is my absolute favorite with Walter and Peanut tying for second favorite. Jose is great. Melvin, not so much. The funniest part of his appearance was when his hair malfunctioned. It's probably just me but I don't find guys talking about women's breasts funny. (Except in the Christmas Special. Peanut? Hysterical!)
If you want to laugh until your face hurts and you can barely breathe, buy this! It's the perfect cure for feeling over-stressed. I'm now a 100% ""Jef-fah-fah Dun Ham...dot com!"" fan for life!!",1352592000,2,776,4.976923076923077

Running the range from grumpy old man to a dead terrorist, Jeff supplies something for everyone.  While the humor tends to be somewhat earthy (language and situations) you do have the choice for bleeped or unbleeped versions.  If you get a chance to see him in person - do so!

I have watched all of Jeff Dunham's shows on DVD or Comedy Central and think this by far is the funniest one! Not only do we get to meet Bubba J for the first time and Achmed the dead Terrorist, but the other greats that make this show hysterical - Walter the grumpy old man, Peanut the crazy one and Jose Jalepeno on a Steek!

If you have already seen Spark of Insanity on Comedy Central, you should still get this DVD; it has about 10 minutes of extra material in the main feature and of course a Bonus feature. An excellent value.  I will probably watch this DVD more than most of my other movies.",1342915200,,401,4.569444444444445

He had some great ones, including the blue Prius, the three chihuahuas . . . I won't try to explain. Then comes Walter, Achmed the dead terrorist (my favorite), a superhero I think is named Melvin, Peanut, and Jose the Jalapeno on a stick. All in Washington, D.C., and having a few jokes at the president's expense.",1336694400,,461,4.5

2882096,1,B000S6LS66,"I absolutely cannot believe the deluge of positive reviews here. This is 80 laugh-free minutes of garbage. They must have pumped in some nitrous oxide or something, because the audience even laughs at the lame ""jokes"" he tells before he brings out the puppets. Holy lord it's bad. For example: At one point he mentions that he recently got a Prius. He then makes a weak engine noise with his mouth and a high-pitched 'beep-beep' sound. GET IT?! BECAUSE THEY ARE SMALL CARS!!! The crowd goes nuts like it's such a clever and witty observation. That's a joke a slow 7-year-old might make for his stand-up routine at the school talent show.

One reviewer here even warned not to watch if you are easily offended. As if this guy is the least bit edgy. I mean, come on. This shlock is for Midwestern 40-year-olds who still only get 3 TV channels and haven't left their Podunk hometown since they were born. And I say that as a Midwestern native myself, so I know the type.

Unless you've suffered a severe brain trauma and laugh even at your houseplants, move along. There's nothing funny here.",1329177600,16,1089,4.608247422680412

But the thing that anyone who doesn't like Jeff Dunham's humour needs to understand is that Jeff isn't trying to re-enforce the usual kind of stereotypical beliefs that some people have of minorities. He uses his humour, and puppets, to show the absurdity of people having such stereotypical beliefs. Besides to anyone who tries to say anything bad about this DVD all I can say is ""Silence!.... I KEEL YOU""!",1328486400,,564,4.707070707070707

Sadly this is not the extent of his 'near-the-knuckle' material - it's a shame: Jeff strikes me as someone who could be just as funny without lowering himself. Oh well...

This video is so funny I have watched it dozens of times and it never fails to make me laugh. As much hype as Achmed and Melvin got, my very favorite puppets are Walter, Peanut, and Jose Jalepeno (on a steek). Jeff is such a good stand-up comic I could actually watch a whole hour of him without his puppets, but of course they are the whole reason for the video.

Over the years, his show has done nothing but improve. When I watched Spark of Insanity, I was instantly reminded of that time in High School and I broke out laughing so hard, I had to re-watch parts of it.

2882150,5,B000S6LS66,"Humor is one of the most subjective things in the world. One man's funny comment is another man's offensive remark. That is why it is very rare when a comedian achieves broad and varid success. Such is the case of Jeff Dunham and his famous(infamous?) cadre of puppets, who have created one of the most recognazible acts in show business and three of the most heavily rotated specials on Comedy Central. Needless to say, in my humble opinion, Jeff Dunham is VERY funny.

Now available ob Blu Ray disc, Arguing With Myself, Spark of Insanity and The Jeff Dunham Christmas Special are filled with plenty of laughs and funny moments one will enjoy again and again. I tend to buy very little discs of this type mainly because after repeated viewings, the material (understandibly) loses it's punch. However after many, and in some instances consecutive, times in my BD player, I have to say I find them all still quite funny. This particular disc (Spark of Insanity) features the debut  (on TV at least) of Achmed, the Dead Terrorist, who has become apparently(by the number of viewings on YouTube) the most famous of Dunham creations. For my money however, you can't beat Peanut. I like him for the same reason I like Eric Cartman: They have absolutely no inhibitions. No ""edit"" button. Jeff Dunham's id if you will. Watching Dunham react to what Peanut says is always funny. If it sounds like I'm convinced that Dunham and Walter, Peanut, Bubba J.and the others are completely seperate, thinking entities, then you can draw a pretty good picture of just how good Jeff Dunham really is. It's not just that he is a good ventriloquist(in that regard, I have seen better), it's the fact that all his puppets, even Jose Jalapeno(on a steek...) have clear, defined characters. Watching these on TV instead of live gives you an advantage over the live crowd as the various camera angles add to the effect of Jeff and his subjects being seperate personalities.

Of course, these being Blu-Ray discs, they look AWSOME, especially compared to the DVD's and TV. For me this was a must-buy and I highly enjoy all of his material so far.

WARNING

When buying these discs, I was tempted to buy the three-pack that contains all three titles. I was shocked to see it costs $80+. Seeing the individual prices of each disc, it didn't add up. Putting each disc seperately in the shopping cart gives youa total of forty-something dollars. ALMOST HALF THE COST OF THE SET!!! So beware and shop smartly.",1258502400,2,2480,4.744779582366589

Jeff is getting more and more popular, as evidenced by the higher ticket prices for his shows. Rats! I took my two kids (ages over 20) to see him for the taping of the Spark of Insanity tour. Jeff-fah-fah was great! When he did bits from former tours, people in the audience were quoting the bit right along with him, and even finishing his sentences for him.

2882206,4,B000S6LS66,"My wife loves Jeff Dunham's comedy. In fact, she even went to see him live. I've purchased all of his DVDs for her. He is a funny comedian, and it's clear that he's worked hard at the art of ventriloquism. In fact, he's the best ventriloquist I've seen on television. I saw him on a talk show for the first time about 14 years ago. Back then, he only had Walter, Peanut, and Jose Jalapeno.

I don't like some of the one star reviews on here because they're very negative and pretentious. To call Jeff Dunham's comedy low brow is not quite appropriate, unless you're his competition or a seasoned, successful observational comedian. To imply that people who like Jeff Dunham don't have brains is solely attempting to start an online flame war. Don't use the one star reviews on Amazon as a reference point for judging Dunham's comedy.

Dunham uses the puppets and the characteristics of the puppets in a non-traditional form of observational comedy, in a world where everyone else is trying to be Dane Cook (who is trying to be Mitch Hedberg), or to reference an earlier observational comedian, Jerry Seinfeld. With Peanut (and sometimes Walter), Dunham primarily makes fun of himself and the other puppets. It's almost a form of insult comedy.

Some people have an open mind about comedy, and can understand and appreciate someone like George Carlin or Lenny Bruce as well as Jeff Dunham and Larry the Cable Guy. Also, as an aside, Larry the Cable Guy is much more easy to appreciate once you realize he is portraying a dumb redneck stereotype (more on stereotypes below). Personally, I like Monty Python's Flying Circus and other sketch comedy shows, like Upright Citizens Brigade, in lieu stand-up comedy. That's a matter of personal taste and not what's generally funny to the masses. Dunham is generally funny to the masses, unless the masses are so pretentious and self-important that they can't accept simple humor...in which case, they aren't the masses.

""Spark of Insanity"" starts with a monologue about a Prius similar to the lotion monologue from ""Arguing with Myself."" The Prius, and it being a gay car, is a theme throughout the show, just like the lotion was in the previous show. Contrary to what some people say, the monologue is funny, but the humor is subtle and slow. It's a setup for a theme, just like in all of his performances. A successful comedian will reference early established themes throughout a stand-up act because the audience, like any large group of readers or listeners, relies on primacy (the things heard first) and recency (the things heard just now). If you connect the two, you can hold attention longer and it helps everything flow. It's just like a theme in a novel.

Dunham plays on homosexuality and some racial stereotypes. I think that the people who take offense at this only do so because Jeff Dunham is a white comedian. It's not Chris Rock, Dave Chappelle, or Carlos Mencia utilizing the racial stereotypes, so it must not be alright, right?

Dunham takes relatively gentle jabs at stereotypes when compared to these other comedians. Also, Dunham has white stereotypes (Bubba Jay as a redneck) to balance other racial stereotypes, as well as age stereotypes (Walter as a curmudgeon). When Dunham plays on homosexuality, it's only outing himself as a possible homosexual regarding Prius ownership, or the chemical analysis machine sometimes mistaking lotion for plastic explosives after a swab is taken from Peanut's butt in the Santa Anna airport. It's alright to employ stereotypes, as long as you're making fun of everyone equally...at least, that's what Carlos Mencia says.

To be overly sensitive to racial stereotypes in comedy is to not be open minded about what can be funny. Stereotypes exist because people have demonstrated them and continue to do so. Some aspects of every stereotype are comedic. To exploit those stereotypes is alright, as long as you employ some portion of self deprecation along with them and don't keep targeting one particular group negatively or express intense dislike or hatred of one group. To be offended or feel uncomfortable when stereotypes are referenced probably means you haven't reached a level of understanding minority groups as equals instead of groups that should be treated specially or differently.

I think Dunham balances stereotypes very well, and overall, he is not offensive. He is an equal opportunity mocker, just like every comedian should be. Every group of people has quirks, and to exploit those gently, taking light jabs at multiple groups, is to appeal to the largest demographic possible.

All of this being said, I give ""Spark of Insanity"" four stars because it is very funny, but it's not perfectly aligned with my personal taste. I applaud the recent efforts that the monologues show towards building his solo stand-up capabilities and demonstrating that he has room for growth as a comedian (even after almost 20 years) by establishing themes in his performances. It's somewhat new ground for him, and to view it negatively is a waste of time. It might be trite for another, solo stand-up comedian to do it, but it's a welcome change in lieu of starting an act with a puppet on his hand or at the ready.

If you remotely like Jeff Dunham and want to see his comedy more than once, I would recommend buying this product. It's cheap and effective.",1232841600,2,5365,4.905181918412349

You've gotta see this one to believe it.  One of my family's all time favs.",1228867200,,546,4.262135922330097

2882234,1,B000S6LS66,"Most people wouldn't know it, but Dunham's been around for 10-15 years. I suppose it just took that long for people to dumb down enough to rediscover him as some kind of comedy genius. Guess what? He's still telling the same tired, low brow jokes. Achmed or no, he hasn't gotten any more humorous.",1228089600,16,297,4.518518518518518
2882235,5,B000S6LS66,"I would recommend this to anyone, He is very very funny. I especially like Achmed the suicide bomber.  He says ""Silence, I'll keel you.""  Very funny.  You get to thinking the ""puppets"" are real cause he is so good and the puppets are so ""lifelike""

2882244,5,B000S6LS66,"I got this DVD as part of a two-pack with the first, Arguing With Myself, and it's actually funnier than the first one! The stars of this DVD have to be Walter, and Achmed the Dead Terrorist. Walter's rant on suicide bombers is priceless! The audience at first seems a bit apprehensive when Jeff announces his desire to speak with a terrorist, but after bringing out Achmed and a few funny zingers, they get into it. Jeff introduces a new puppet, Melvin the superhero, who really isn't a favorite of mine, I must say. Of course, Peanut is hysterical, and Peanut and Jose Jalapeno together wrap up the show. Overall, this show is hilarious, fast-paced, and actually funnier than the first show. Jeff Dunham has to be the most talented, funniest ventriloquist I've ever seen, and hopefully he'll release more specials to DVD VERY soon!",1225584000,,833,4.751724137931035
2882245,5,B000S6LS66,Jeff is by far the funniest comedian i have seen in a long long time.  He has great skills and can make anything funny.  If you haven't watched him yet you MUST see it.

2882252,5,B000S6LS66,My son showed me some clips of Jeff on You Tube and I knew I had to order this DVD. Jeff is even funny before he brings out his puppets but when those little guys come out of the box it gets really hilarious. Some is a little off color but nothing openly crude. My whole family enjoyed the DVD.,1224201600,,294,3.9166666666666665

2882255,5,B000S6LS66,"I am a fan of Jeff Dunham so my review is a bit biased. Spark of Insanity is a hilarious program that is suitable for most of the family (I don't think little children will get the more mature jokes). Cleaner that ""Arguing with myself"" though, I don't mind the swearing. Familiar puppets Walter, Peanut and Jose come with new material and Jeff introduces two new guys: Achmed the  dead terrorist"" and ""Melvin the superhero"". The jokes with the new superhero's are about their characters, while the jokes with Walter, Peanut and Jose are more like Jeff just chatting with his buddies. All 100% ""Funny as Hell""",1223856000,,608,4.682242990654205

2882260,5,B000S6LS66,I would have to say that Jeff Dunham is the best ventriloquist I ever seen. I've seen many ventriloquist before and I never seen anyone project their voice to puppets and never once did I see Jeff's mouth move to pronounce words that would take some kind of movement from the performer. Gut busting comedian that leaves you laughing like no other ventriloquist I seen. The Best in his field.,1223510400,,391,4.6

2882263,5,B000S6LS66,I throughly enjoyed this video. I think and feel Jeff is one of the most talented ventriloquists today. His routines are fresh and the comedy is just great. He keeps you laughing all the time. I have not laughed this hard watching any comedy routine as I did with this video. I highly recommend this video to others who want a good laugh. I thing Jeff has even surpassed himself. This was even better than his first video. I can't wait to see if he can come out with even a better one in the future.,1223078400,,499,4.208333333333333

2882272,5,B000S6LS66,"Spark of Insanity is even better than the Arguing With Myself DVD. You gotta love Walter, Peanut, Jose Jalapeno and the new addition called Achmed, the Dead Terrorist. Jeff gets so much personailty out of these puppets using only his voice and movements of his hand. It's amazing to watch him bring these wacky characters to life. There is some adult subject matter and a little foul language, so watch it before showing your kids, but it really has no more than most PG-13 movies. This would make a great gift for just about anyone. Heck, why not also make it a gift for yourself? Take some time out of your busy life and get ready to laugh until you have a headache. I'm sure you deserve it. The laughter, not the headache.",1222387200,,725,4.458646616541353

I am using it to great effect with my friends and family.  I chose this movie to be included in a giveaway basket for my daughter's wedding.  It will probably be the favorite item in the basket.  Watch the extras and see how he creates his characters.",1222128000,,395,4.3561643835616435

The new ones certainly were just as good and a nice touch by one of the greatest ventriloquist's out there. How he does it so well I'll never know.

Great to have around for when your friends drop in and the conversation dies out.  ""Hey - have you seen Jeff Dunham lately?"".  Hysterical!",1216857600,,291,4.647058823529412

Just too funny.  Dun-HAM is truly inspired and can take a serious subject like terrorism and poke fun at it.  And the funniest part is that he works the concept of ""I am the dummy, really"" into his act, which makes you appreciate the presentation even more.  Go ahead and buy this--it also makes great presents.",1216252800,,531,4.217821782178218
2882312,5,B000S6LS66,"This guy is a genius! Where he comes up with his ideas is a complete mystery!
His characters are quite believable and every one is totally entertaining. He comes from a fairly wide area of sarcasms in his anecdotes; I find it interesting he ""insults"" his audience without pissing them off. He touches on stereotypes without sounding racist.
The extras are pretty cool - especially the ability to watch how he actually INVENTS his characters and then BUILDS THEM! He doesn't just go a swap meet and buy a doll and dress it up: he concocts it in his head, draws it out, sculpts it and makes what you see!

HIGHLY recommended for anyone (though there are a FEW cuss words, it's no worse than most public places).",1216080000,,709,4.5390625

2882317,5,B000S6LS66,"This is definately the better of Jeff's two dvds he has out.  The appearance of Ackhmed the dead terrorist and an assortment of Jeff's other characters it was funny from start to finish.  I died of laughter the first time I saw it, as did my family.  Definately worth the money!",1215388800,,278,4.411764705882353

2882320,5,B000S6LS66,"I had seen many of Jeff's appearances on TV specials in the past, so I bought both of his DVDs. I wasn't disappointed. I laughed my butt off! If I was a thin-skinned person, I might take offense at some of his jokes, puppet characters, and some of the adult language. But I have heard language like that coming from the mouths of young children! This is adult humor, so don't play it around the kiddies if that is a concern for you. As I write this, there are 632 four and five star reviews, and 25 ""pans"". 'Nough said.",1215302400,,519,4.2
2882321,5,B000S6LS66,"Jeff Dunham is the single funniest comedians I've seen in a long time.  His opening to this is amazing since I didn't know he could have his own material to add to the show, instead of just his helpers.  My favorites were Walter, the dead terrorist and of course Jose. Plus you could really get into the mind of Dunham with this dvd showing you the depth of his mind, humor, and all that is him when it comes to comedy.",1215129600,,419,4.160493827160494
2882322,5,B000S6LS66,"If you like Jeff Dunham you will absolutely LOVE this DVD!  The DVD includes most of Jeff's most popular characters including a new one. As an added bonus this DVD includes the development of his newest character and shows how he personally hand crafts each of his dolls!  I was very impressed by his artistic talent! My husband, children and I love this DVD and have recommended it to all of our friends and family.  You will not regret purchasing this one!",1215043200,,458,4.560975609756097

2882325,5,B000S6LS66,"I have to say that from what I had seen on Comedy Central doesn't do justice to what is on this DVD.  I enjoyed all aspects of not only the act but the bonus features and Walters announcement to run in the 2008 Presidential race.  He's got my vote!  All of the Candidates to date have been puppets anyway, even the current President!  I also enjoyed the creative process in the creation of his newest puppet melvin.  I was very intrigued by the insiders view.  The whole DVD was very enjoyable.",1214784000,,494,4.373626373626373
2882326,2,B000S6LS66,"This is the first time I'd watched one of his shows.  I was prepped before hand by a huge JD fan who said he was really funny, even without his puppets.
He wasn't.
The first 15 minutes were standard observational/family related jokes.  I was bored and waiting for the puppets.
The last 65 minutes of the DVD were all about the puppets.  I thought the individual skits were too long.  I laughed a couple times here and there, but thought there was 5 minutes of each doll they could cut out (including the entire Peanut skit)
I don't really mind stereotypical humor, but Dunham had little else to offer.  Nothing groundbreaking, nothing edgy outside of a Jewish joke.  So it's no surprise that most people find him extremely entertaining.
If you like edgy material, look elsewhere.",1214524800,,779,4.6911764705882355
2882327,5,B000S6LS66,Jeff Dunham is one of the funniest commedians out there and if you've ever seen him on comedy central then you've just got to own his DVD's.  Walter is one of my favorite characters.  Jeff Dunham really puts alot of feeling into his characters and I think that you'll agree that he is just hilarious.,1214179200,,300,4.4363636363636365

2882330,3,B000S6LS66,"Juff Dunham is a funny guy - and Walter always causes spasms of laughter, but this isn't nearly as good as his first special, ""Arguing with Myself"". If you like Dunham, by all means watch it, but you can probably skip the ""Marvin the Superhero"" character, and possibly Achmed.",1213833600,,276,4.653061224489796
2882331,5,B000S6LS66,"We didn't think Jeff could do any better than ""Arguing with Myself"" until we saw ""Spark of Insanity."" I'm even more amazing at Jeff's creative genius. I have to admit my husband and I hadn't watched many ventriloquists before; however, after seeing Jeff's videos, we're definitely fans.

We liked this video as much, if not more, than his first. I love the new ""Dead Terriost"" character. It's amazing how Jeff can make that so funny. Of course, my husband relates to Walter (he is Walter!) and we all love Peanut. When Peanut, Jeff, and Jalepeno on a Stick are all talking, you have to be amazed at Jeff's skill (and sense of humour).

We have watched it with dozens of friends, each one saying the same thing. You soon forget he is working with puppets and he is making all the voices and sounds. There are even times when he and the puppets are talking at the same time! The puppets seem so real. It's amazing what he can say and get away with because it's coming out of their mouths. Sometimes his comments are controversial but he does it with such humour and no one is spared.

My husband and I highly recommend this to anyone who is looking for a good laugh--a ""slap your knee, good belly laugh.""",1213747200,,1202,4.454545454545454

2882344,5,B000S6LS66,"A fantastic comedy show.  Jeff goes on a bit too long in the beginning about his dog when all you need to know about is his car.  However, every puppet is full of laughs.  Melvin is a bit shaky, but when you watch the amazing extras (5 stars) you'll see he didn't have much prep with him.  So hopefully we'll get better jokes the next time we see him.",1212969600,,351,4.043478260869565

How can anyone carry on a three way conversation, stay in character and work the puppets all at the same time?  We've bought copies for family and friends to enjoy.  We would dearly love to see his act in person, but he doesn't came close to our area, so this is the next best thing to being there.  You'll laugh till you cry.",1212796800,,466,4.179775280898877

This DVD is leaps and bounds better than his first, ""Arguing With Myself"". Jeff does some stand-up, which comes back to ""haunt"" him later in the act. We're introduced to one of the most hilarious characters of all time, Achmed the Dead Terrorist, along with another so-so character, Melvin the Superhero. Of course, the old stand-bys, Walter, Peanut, and Jose Jalepeno (on a steek) are there also to round out the fun. Guaranteed, this DVD will add ""SILENCE!

Walter and Peanut are in top form here! Let's face it - you can never have enough time with Peanut. What a delightful creation.  My absolute favorite!

Achmed is a very funny addition to the suitcase posse. He's a keeper - in spite of already being dead!

For those who don't like the word ""frickin'"" he uses it quite a bit but that sure beats using the other ""F"" word, which I hate.

Mr. Dunham and his cast of characters will have you rolling on the floor. Mr. Dunham is undoubtedly, one of the most talented individuals I have had the opportunity and pleasure to watch (as a side note, I am not generally a ""comedy"" watcher). From Walter to Achmed, Peanut to Jose on a Stick, the vocal characterizations, puppet character movements, banter and obvious talent of Mr. Dunham would receive high marks (and probably five stars) from the legendary ventriloquist and great team of Mr. Edgar Bergan and his sidekick of Charlie McCarthy!

2882509,5,B000S6LS66,"Jeff Dunham is just too funny. This is an awesome video. If you have a funny bone, you need to add this to your collection. The voices he does for each character is unique and they all have distint personalities. Also his stand up routine is totally funny as well.",1204588800,,264,4.3
2882510,5,B000S6LS66,"""Spark Of Insanity"" is a perfect sequel to Jeff Dunham's first video, ""Arguing With Myself"".  An excellent DVD to show to guests, as long as you warn them that the puppets tend to offend any groups the ventriloquist discusses.  For example, there are zingers for both Arab terrorists and Jews.

You can watch this material on Comedy Central if you wait for it to come around and then put up with commercial interruptions.  I like having it in my collection so I can watch anytime.  However, I find that my two Jeff Dunham videos aren't always in my collection because they are my most frequently loaned-out DVDs.  Most people who borrow this DVD end up buying their own copy so they can show it to their friends too.

In summary, you can't lose with this DVD.  You'll enjoy watching it over and over, and everyone will love it.",1204502400,,827,4.54054054054054

2882512,5,B000S6LS66,"Who can't get enough of the best modern-day ventriloquist? While his humor may seem a little dirty or ""below the belt"", it is through the expressiveness of his crazy puppet's characteristics that those jokes come through. Walter seemed to get more time than usual, and Peanut/Jose Jalapano's time seemed to be cut a bit. Still, it's worth watching this. Heck, set up a projection screen and invite the neighbor hood! Walter's jokes are enough to hold the DVD by itself, with jokes like ""So, Walter? How long have you two been married?"" ""Oh, uh, about 47 years."" ""Wow, that's good!"" ""Yeah, the dumb broad just won't die.""

A genuinely funny DVD to watch and treasure.",1204502400,,666,4.791304347826087

Spark of Insanity has Jeff doing his hand at a little stand-up and then making appearances with Walter, new characters Achmed & Melvin, Peanut, and Jose the Jalapeno. The DVD's Special Features include a special public announcement from Walter and a 'making of' of sorts showing Jeff creating Melvin to perform with.

The only reason I didn't give this product 5 stars is because of some of the cursing he does at certain points in the program (not appropriate around small children), but it's not enough to ruin the overall experience.

I don't see how a dead terrorist and puppet at that is funny.  But thats just me.  I did very much enjoy the extra about the creation of melvin and walter announcement.  Other than those two things.  Its just not funny.  Peanuts bit is okay.  I have seen other things that jeff has done such as late night shows with walter and its been funnier.

As  big fans of his, my husband and I decided to treat ourselves to a recent concert of his in Charlotte, NC as a twin birthday gift to ourselves (my birthday is Dec 29 and his is Jan 10).  We went to see him Dec 27th and he is funnier in person than on tape if that is possible!  We both laughed until we about fell out of our seats!!  My only regret about see Jeff was that I wish I had closer seats to the front of the stage to see his up close!  For all you Jeff fans out there if you ever get a chance to see him live  GO!!  My husband and I drove 6 hrs from our house in WV to NC for Jeff's concert and we stayed the night before and the night of the show.  So that just goes to show you we thought he was well worth the trip.  And on top of that what a great birthday gift to ourselves, this concert of Jeff's !  So please buy his DVD's and go see him, you'll not regret it for one moment!  Would we go again if we get the chance You Bet We Will!  Now we can't wait to see what will be Jeff's next adventure with Walter, Peanut, Achmed the Dead Terrorist, Bubba J and good old Jose Jalapeno On a Stick!!",1201132800,,1171,3.769547325102881

After you watch for a few minutes you can almost believe the puppets have a brain of their own - could be kind of scary, if I wasn't laughing so hard. A few moments that are not exactly for kids (I know - I'm a teacher), but older teens and up will love it! Even his ""puppet-less"" (if that's a word) stand-up at the beginning is excellent. Refreshing to have comedy that's not just a string of obscenities and sexual content! (And I know some people who must be related to Walter....)",1201046400,,645,4.209677419354839

Jeff is just a great comedian and a fine ventriloquist!  His characters are really great, especially the dead suicide bomber.

2882647,5,B000S6LS66,Jeff Dunham has surpassed his first dvd with his latest release. Has a new character (the terrorist) who is very funny. Highly recommend this and his first release. Has a little bit of rough language in it but not to bad. You might want to see the video first before sharing it with small children. Also make sure to check out the extra items on the dvd.

First off Jeff Dunham does a little stand-up comedy without his puppets and then lets them on stage one by one. Of course every one of them has their master's style in some way, but the way they act differs strongly, so that most people should find one or two charakters they really like (IF you like the creator's rough humor-> no great world politics but more making fun of your wife or your neighbour's car etc).
I liked watching it as light entertainment and one should not be expecting any more from this DVD.

P.S.: The DVD is region free (watched it on a Region 2 player).",1201046400,,717,4.311111111111111

Although this might not be appropriate for younger children due to language, the puppets are great and is a must see for everyone!  I have seen many comedy movies and this is a good one.  Achmed the dead  terrorist is so funny, (one of our favorites along with Walter and Peanut).  Who would have thought jokes on such a  a sensative subject would be so funny....Jeff really pulls it off and does a great job at it.

A year or two ago, the Blue Collar Comedy tour was the hot comedic act. This year Jeff Dunham far exceeds the Blue Collar guys. He brings a whole new meaning to a ventriloquist's humor. His ""characters"" are very fresh. I laugh at just the thought of some of his routines. He is going to be on stage in my town in April and tickets are already sold out. I highly recommend either one of his DVD's. If you don't think he's funny, you must be a real curmudgeon!!!",1200873600,,622,4.370689655172414

How could you not love a man who drives a powder blue Prius with holiday stickers in the back window and a dog in his lap? And, that plays with dolls. The only thing missing is the opening act that we saw, a Dominican guy with braids doing the hand jive! It is definately a good laugh.

Aside from the obvious - i.e. the puppets - this guy masters one of the rarest arts in the field: To be insanely funny without being so at someone else's expense. I've watched the show several times already and definately plan to see it again, even gave it to friends for christmas.

As for targer audience, eventhough I am sure younger kids will find him just as hilarious as their parents will, I could be a little worried for the wellfare of the family pets after the show. However, it's definately something anyone between 14 and 90 can enjoy.

Everyone had tears in their eyes from laughing so hard.  Walter is at his very best, and Achmed the Dead Terrorist is so funny!  Jeff has really perfected his craft.  Peanut is at his usual best, but this one is politically incorrect and you just can't stop laughing.

Jeff also does a stand-up routine about his Prius which shows his ability to be funny without the puppets.

2882748,5,B000S6LS66,"This standup act is one of the funniest pieces of comedy I have ever seen.  I watched it for the first time just by chance on Comedy Central when I was flipping through the channels looking for something to watch on TV.  I can't remember when I have ever laughed so hard.  If someone would have walked into the house they would have thought I was crying hysterically.  I thought it was great and got a copy for each one of my bother and sisters, there are six of us.
 Jeff Dunham plays straight man to his side-kick dummy dolls.  Each has his own personality that Jeff is able to bring to life through his outstanding ability as a ventriloquist.  There is some questionable language but not outrageous or over done.  This is an adult movie and even though dolls are used children are not the intended audience.
 A great movie for anyone looking for a good laugh.",1199404800,,862,4.405063291139241
2882749,4,B000S6LS66,"If you like the politically-incorrect view of life then check out Jeff Dunham's ""Spark of Insanity.""  From the grumpyness of Walter....the stupidity of Achmed the Dead Terrorist....to the shear insanity of Peanut, Jeff Dunham's brand of comedy will not just tickle but shake your funny-bone.  PG-13 content at a minimum.",1199404800,,320,5.38
2882755,1,B000S6LS66,"It is amazing what stereotypes you can get away with simply by turning the object of your insults into a puppet. Jos&eacute; the Jalape&ntilde;o and Achmed the Terrorist and his pimp character are easy targets playing on the stereotypes of our culture. Heck, even Walter is the kind of age discrimination that limits our understanding of the senior set. If he were to tell his jokes without a puppet, he would be booed off stage like Michael Richards screaming ""N*gger"". This DVD is only for those willing to embrace their inner racist.",1199404800,20,536,4.836956521739131

2882758,1,B000S6LS66,"I bought this DVD mainly because of his two characters; ""Achmed the dead terrorist"" and ""Walter"". The release date of this DVD is 2007. The release date of ""Arguing with myself"" is 2006, so I'm assumeing he attempted to ""freshen"" his material, but failed.
Some of the best ""bits"" from his Walter character were cut, and some not funny bits were added to ""Achmed"".
For instance: Achmed tells of how to kill two Jews by throwing a penny between them, or throwing a child between two Catholic priests.
I'm not a PC person by any means, nor am I Catholic or Jewish, but this was extremely low brow humor and distasteful.
It is obvious that Jeff Dunham was out of material and should not have tried to fix something that wasn't broken.",1199232000,13,730,4.537878787878788
2882759,5,B000S6LS66,This video is the most hilarious comedy video I have ever seen. I have watched this video 3 times within the last months and will still have tears rolling down my face from laughter. Jeff Dunham does a fantastic job. Order this video for you and your friends.

I had seen the program on Comedy Central and loved it there, but the DVD comes with an extra hour of material.

You will NOT be disappointed with this DVD!",1199232000,,384,4.08
2882761,5,B000S6LS66,"Jeff Dunham is very creative and funny.  I purchased several copies and gave out as gifts to some hard to buy for people on my Christmas list.

Highly recommend.",1199232000,,334,4.610169491525424
2882762,5,B000S6LS66,"Okay, so I don't get around much; I don't watch Comedy Central; and I had never heard of Jeff Dunham.  And up until a few days ago I thought of ventriloquism as about as hokey as middle school hootenanny; but then I was given Dunham's SPARK OF INSANITY as a Yuletide present (by my highly signficant other). . .

I am a changed curmudgeon.

Ladies and gents, this is funny, funny stuff, and I'm not talking about chuckling funny--I'm talking about rolling on the floor funny.  Dunham and his ""suitcase posse"" of colorful characters (and an old curmudgeon like me sure appreciates Walter) tackle a plethora of topics--many of them devoutly controversial.  But Dunham (and friends) gets away with controversy, because everything is fair game and no one is spared.  Heck, forget the puppets; Dunham's opening monologue is hysterical.

When a comedian can make his audience forget their troubles and just enjoy the entertainment for its own sake, said comedian has achieved pure comedic bliss.  And Jeff Dunham does just that; SPARK OF INSANITY is well worth the viewing, time and time again.

2882779,5,B000S6LS66,"Jeff Dunham (Jeff-fa-fa Dun [...]) is amazing. He is comedic genius at work. His sense of timing and coordination with his ""friends from his suitcase"" is so impressive...and funny like hell. He has an hour monologue (yes, he's funny without his ventriloquist dolls...I find myself unable to call them dummies) which ties his ""conversations"" with his characters later in the show. Although some of you may have seen this on ""Comedy Central,"" the monologue has never aired, so you'll be in for a treat. I have watched this DVD (and his first, ""Arguing With Myself"") with friends and family and never tire of it! I feel proud to be the one introducing this masterful artist to friends and family. I can't believe he's not better known...YET. I hope that I may, someday, watch him perform live. I would love to have Walter rip me apart because I know I would be ripping with laughter. This is DEFINATELY a five star rating. If you want a great laugh, order BOTH of these DVDs and have a viewing party...your friends will talk about it for a long time to come.

Absolutely hysterical!  Had to play the dvd more than once, I was laughing so hard I missed a few parts!

Achmed the dead terrorist is too funny - way to go Jeff!",1198368000,,339,7.425
2882799,5,B000S6LS66,"After seeing a snipped of Jeff's show on U-Tube, it urged us to seek him out and to buy his DVD's.  Being in Australia, we haven't seen or hearf of Jeff before. The man is awesomely brilliant, and so very clever !!  And we love how politically incorrect he is!!  I'd definately recommend this to anyone who wants a good belly laugh !!
GO ON - BUY IT !!",1198368000,,352,4.072463768115942
2882800,5,B000S6LS66,This is a great DVD with many great and unique moments. I would recommend this comedian to anyone who likes to laugh.,1198368000,,117,4.363636363636363
2882801,5,B000S6LS66,"Jeff Dunham's imagination, creativity, and unique style is nothing short of sheer genius!  If you liked ""Arguing With Myself,"" you'll LOVE ""Spark of Insanity!""  (You'll probably love it even if you DIDN'T like or see ""Arguing With Myself!"")  He's done away with Sweeeeet Daddy D and Bubba J (which was a geat move in my humble opinion), and replaced them with Achmed the Dead Terrorist and a new Superhero character that had me rolling with laughter, tears streaming down my cheeks from laughing so hard!  A definite ""must"" for the DVD library of anyone with a sense of humor!",1198368000,,576,4.787878787878788
2882802,5,B000S6LS66,"Not quite as funny as the first one but it's still a must see. Jeff Dunham is a master comedian who just keeps getting better and better. I didn't care for Melvin the Superhero but all the other will leave you in stitches. For maximum effect, watch this with a group of people. I can't wait for his next act.",1198368000,,308,4.15
2882803,5,B000S6LS66,"Jeff Dunham and his puppets make for fine entertainment. As usual, Walter shines as the archtype of the grumpy old man, and Peanut as the really odd strange creature. Jose is great for his understated style. The new Dead Terrorist is not up to the high standard of the older characters, but is still above the norm.

This is a great DVD that adults can enjoy, but I think it would be to explicit for children and they would also likely miss the humor of Jeff's political and social satire.",1198281600,,489,4.433333333333334
2882804,5,B000S6LS66,"I don't think I've laughed like I did while watching this with my 2 kids & husband.  Jeff Dunham is so amazing.  When we watched his dvd ""Arguing With Myself"", I couldn't imagine how he could come up with anything funnier then that, then this one came out.  We have watched this probably about 6 times ourselves, then we have shared it with friends & seen it again!  Just an awesome comedian.  Highly recommended.",1198195200,,413,4.527027027027027
2882805,5,B000S6LS66,"This dvd is from Jeff Dunhams' Comedy Central special.  Yes, he uses puppets, but it's not puppets like you think.  As someone who works with puppets, he does an awesome job.

2882812,5,B000S6LS66,Jeff Dunham is a very funny guy. This video is one of the funniest things that I have ever seen. He has brought ventriloquism out of the dark ages. I would seriously buy this product if I were you. Achmed is the greatest.,1198108800,,221,4.162790697674419
2882813,4,B000S6LS66,"This guy is hysterical. This DVD was funnier than the first, especially the dead terrorist. However, the old characters needed a new routine because a lot of the act was repetitive from his first DVD.

2882814,4,B000S6LS66,I'v seen his video clips on youtube and had to get the DVD. The clean version of this DVD is really not needed. He's funny and generally not vulgar. I hear worse language walking through Walmart. I'd recomend this DVD to anyone.,1198108800,,228,4.4523809523809526
2882815,4,B000S6LS66,This act is fantastic. It has a little of everything. There are things to relate to. Things that make your sides ache from laughter. A brilliant performance,1198108800,,156,4.814814814814815
2882816,4,B000S6LS66,"Hopefully Jeff will continue to carry on the old dummy gig and bring us more material.  I laughed more on this one than arguing with myself.  The dead terrorist was killing me!!

I picked up a few copies for gifts because its worth sharing with friends, only draw back I have.... there is some fowl words used in his act which I am not a fan of but other than that I enjoy the humor",1198108800,,382,4.066666666666666

2882822,5,B000S6LS66,"Nobody does a ventriloquist act anymore, but Jeff Dunham does a great job of it, and you will be rolling on the floor laughing through the entire thing.  There is very little language, and just a few off color or ""politically incorrect"" routines.  For the most part, this is a hilarious guy with a fun and different show.  Very highly recommended!!",1197936000,,348,4.672131147540983
2882823,4,B000S6LS66,"Jeff is a master at his trade.  His characters are so life-like you will believe they are real people.  His routines are well crafted and spontaneous.  Great fun to watch...although you may want to preview the show before allowing young kids to watch as some of his routine is borderline crude...not terribly crude or anything...in a fun sort of way, but some of it might not be suitable for young kids.",1197849600,,403,4.647887323943662

friends and family!!",1196208000,,394,4.563380281690141
2882864,3,B000S6LS66,"I discovered Jeff Dunham on an HBO special of the same title of Spark of Insanity and I was absolutely amazed by his originality. Dunham is amazingly not the predictable ventriloquist for several reasons. One, he's focused on as well as his dolls, which is rare, and all you can see is his throat barely move while his lips don't move at all. Most ventriloquists are too obvious. Second, his five characters are original both in voice and personality. Most ventriloquists have trouble making each character separate. Jeff is also amazing because his characters have clear diction, while most ventriloquists have problems with certain sounds.

Peanut the alien looking doll is strikingly manic and took a couple viewings to get used to. He either grows on you or you'll completely dislike him. He's an upper without being annoying. I loved his kidding about Dunham's last name by calling him Jeff Dun-HAM and calling Jeff ""the other white meat"" and kidding about the ""ff"" in Jeff's name calling him ""Jeff Fa fa"". Plugging Jeff's website Peanut is hysterical because his voice rises and falls and as many times as he plugs Jeff's website it's not annoying. Made me so curious that I visited the site.

Walter is an obnoxious grouch and reminds me of my uncle which makes Walter funnier because people like Walter do exist. Walter says things no one would dare even for a 'real' old person.

Melvin the Super Hero is refreshingly unsuperhero like because he's not perfect.

Jose Jalapeno is cute and for a long time I couldn't figure out until I watched really close how his mouth moved. His accent is astonishingly real considering the fact that Jeff is American and to precisely mimic a Latino accent shows his unique gift of mimicry. I didn't like the routine of Jose Jalapeno being drilled by Peanut over being legal. Why? There's a difference between being current and making fun of it, and propagating the myth that if you're not legal, you don't belong here despite the justifications on the contrary by Jeff.

But my all time favorite is Achmed the dead terrorist. He was hysterical when he mentioned his fear of Walter's farts busting the myth that the propagandized 'evil' terrorist fears nothing. His only problem is that he sounds East Indian instead of Middle Eastern. What I didn't appreciate was what I perceived as an Anti-Semitic joke which Mr. Dunham vehemently denies as racist when he made Achmed say he'd like to ""Kill the Jews"" by ""tossing a penny between two Jews and watching them fight to the death"" reinforcing the stereotypical myth that Jews fight over money which we don't and that such an act would be considered entertainment and telling Achmed that he doesn't use bigotry in his routines. Justifying the Anti-Semitic comment by Jeff's making Achmed say that he did the same joke but using two Catholic priests by throwing in a young boy was lame using priest molestations because no stereotypical racist comments about Catholicism as a religion was tossed in, making me wonder how Anti-Semitic Jeff Dunham may be while hiding behind his dummies. What I wonder about is what will happen to Achmed after we get over the propagandized fear over the 'evil' terrorist. He'll have no more material, forcing him to be relegated to nothing more, in Walter's words, as ""just a stinking Halloween ornament"". Despite his minor flaws, Achmed is a great character because he's given some 'humanity' and humor. The best joke about Achmed was that being all bone was nothing more than a ""flesh wound"".

Alone, Jeff Dunham isn't funny at all with his beginning solo routine about his Blue Prius. I have no idea what that car looks like and it's reference as being a ""gay"" car because it's blue I found tasteless because once again it's poking fun in a stereotypical manner at another group of people who have enough problems with inaccurate judgements against them. Nor did I like his comments about his Chihuahua. I have one and they're great dogs and not to be maligned because they're small with big personalities.

Overlooking the unfunny tries at stereotyping, Jeff Dunham is an amazing entertainer to watch. Being cute helps also. I'm looking forward to more from him.",1196208000,6,4187,4.855742296918767

Not that I didn't enjoy it, maybe it's just getting a bit repetitive. I love his new characters however! Jeff Dunham can get away with making major fun of all races, ages and classes of people because it is voiced through his puppets, and he is a master at it! We repeat his phrases often in our daily life, just for kicks! Jeff is hilarious and there is nothing off color with language or sex talk so it's okay to watch in any group situation. (unless you think making politically incorrect fun of people is a no-no) I like to give his videos for quick and inexpensive gifts. ..and see him live if you can!",1196208000,,745,4.109589041095891

I laughed so hard, my gut hurts. When he pulled Achmed (I kill you!) the dead terrorist from the suitcase, I cringed slightly. After seeing Achmed's act, the cringe turned into a great time. Walter complaining about marriage? I have felt the same way at times. But, he still loves her. Far and away however, Peanut stole the show. Je F F Done ham.com was great stuff.

Spark of Insanity ups the funny quotient exponentially.  If you've enjoyed him in the past, you will undoubtedly love this special.",1195603200,,398,4.6571428571428575

I never liked ventriloquist's shows as they used to be really boring, but Jeff's puppets live their own life on the stage and actually they are arguing with him.  It is just funny.  And what is very unusual among stand-up comedians Jeff is funny without using ""strong language"".  Even sometimes Walter is ""crossing the line"", it is not so obvious, and you easy forgive him, because he is just grumpy old man.
This DVD is a good, healthy laugh leaving you with funny quotes you will remember (""Silence... I'll kill you"").  I'm looking forward to the next Jeff's show.",1195603200,,661,4.71304347826087

It wasn't nearly as funny as the first one and the special features sucked too. I was very surprised with how bad this one was as compared to how good the first one was. The new puppets weren't that great, and you know you have problems when Peanut can't even save the show.

2882879,5,B000S6LS66,"I absolutely loved this DVD.  Jeff Dunham is not just a great ventriloquist, he's a hilarious stand-up comedian.  The short routine he does at the beginning is just as, if not funnier, than his ventriloquist act.  Using his family as ""fodder"", I mean, material, is genius.  He uses examples that everyone can relate to.

His ""dummies"", (I use that word only in gest, for fear Marvin, the Super Hero will fly thru my window,) are intelligent, sarcastic, droll and so entertaining that you forget they aren't real!

This is a great DVD to watch with several friends.  Be sure to have a box of tissues nearby, however, as no male or female that I have shown this to has been able to refrain from laughing so hard that they cried!",1195171200,,726,4.538461538461538

Shortly after I bought the DVD I saw him on T.V.  When I tuned to the channel and found Jeff Dunham, he was introducing his new puppet,'Achmed the Dead Terrorist'.  With that particular routine, I laughed so much and know my nephew will also laugh. Those soldiers can use some laughter while over there. The rest of Jeff Dunham's characters are equally as funny.
 I will admit, it is not the best comedy DVD for young children to hear. Although he is not vulgar, his comedy is intended for older ears.",1194912000,,656,4.404958677685951

I think what Jeff does best is switch so seamlessly between characters - whether that be the puppets or himself.  He does that at the drop of a hat - changes voice, pitch, mood - you name it, and so quickly, too.  It is truly uncanny.  He is the consummate professional.  Does 8 different puppets- characters, 9 if you include the puppet master.  My favorite is Walter.  Walter for President!  Anyway, if you buy this DVD, be warned - this material is NOT for children - adult content only (I would label it TV 14).

I was crying by the time they got to ""Ackmed the dead terrorist"".  I wasn't sure how Jeff Dunham could possibly make a terrorist funny but he has!  Walter was on top of his game, even funnier and more sarcastic than before.  Melvin (a new superhero) had a few funny quips but it's doubtful he'll become a regular.  Ackmed is destined to become part of the act and Peanut and Jose Jalapeno are funny together as always.  Jeff does a longer set on his own family life at the beginning which will have you rolling, especially the part about his daughter Kenna and their chihuahua Darby.  Any fans from the first show (Arguing with Myself) will surely enjoy this one as well.  I highly recommend it!",1194134400,,819,4.406666666666666

This one has some new charecters in it that will make a dead person rise up and want to see what's going on and try to figure out where all the laughter is coming from.

It is family friendly (although I recommend you watch it before showing it to your little ones, as there are some parts in which words like damn and bastard are used). I think one of the greatest things about Dunham's show i not just watching it on your own, but showing it to other people, and anticipating it. I think of my father, and it makes the Walter scene twice as funny, just thinking of how my Dad will react to that. With Peanut it is my sister, I can just see her imitating ""DOT cooooom"".

o You also get to see Walter announce he is running for President which includes a question and answer session right after the announcement.  Be afraid Steven Colbert.  Be very afraid.

This performance's running gag is about a powder blue Prius.  The monologue establishes this.  I won't go into any detail about the performance as I don't want to spoil it for anyone.

Jeff has two new characters that he introduces in this show, Achmed the Dead Terrorist and Melvin the Superhero.  Of course there's still Walter, Jose Jalapeno (""on a steek""...lol) and Peanut, who is my personal favorite.

Unlike his previous DVD, ""Arguing with Myself"", censors only ""bleeped"" one time in this DVD.  ""Arguing with Myself"" had a censored version where all cursing is ""bleeped"" and of course the unedited option on the same DVD.  ""Spark of Insanity"" does not require censored and unedited verions as the cursing is very light.  Not taking anything away from his previous DVD, just noting that if you're looking for some great laughs and little cursing, then you need to purchase this DVD.  If you have not seen either of these productions, I do highly recommend both.  You won't be disappointed.",1193270400,2,940,4.980769230769231

All the favorites are back; Walter, the grumpy old man, Peanut, and Jose Jalapeno On A Stick. There are a few new characters, Achmed The Dead Terrorist, and Melvin The Superhero. Jeff's opening monologue is just as funny as his routines with the suitcase posse. To his credit, the language is quite a bit milder than his first DVD. Be sure to watch the extras. Jeff's creation of a new dummy (Melvin) is very interesting. Plus Walter has a major announcement. I've watched it several times, and have laughed each time! Bravo to Jeff Dunham.",1193097600,,673,4.570247933884297
2882970,3,B000S6LS66,"If I had never seen ""Arguing with Myself"" or had not been a fan of Jeff since his initial appearance on Carson, I'd probably give this 4 or 5 stars because it is quite good and is not dissapointing taken as a stand alone act--but compared with Jeff's other works, I found this routine to be a bit sub-par.

Overall, I'd have to agree with another reviewers comment about how the tone of the show seemed a bit toned-down.  Not nearly as 'racey' or 'foul-mouthed' as the original.  With the new advertised new character ""Achmed the Dead Terrorist"" (discussed latter) I really wondered where the heck this was going to go...

Jeff's introductory stand-up routine was quite funny...the jokes about the Toyota Prius were used the same way ""Lotion"" was in Arguing with Myself throughout the routine.

Walter, as always, ends up being the highlight of the show--his take on suicide bombers had me in stiches laughing.  Jeff with Walter is reason enough to buy the DVD.

The next puppet is ""Achmed the Dead Terrorist"" who replaces ""Sweet Daddy Dee"".  I enjoyed Sweet Daddy Dee, my wife didn't care for that routine.  As for ""Achmed"", I really had to wonder where he was going to go with this...  Turns out it was just a bit silly with no real 'racey' (for lack of a better term).  The new tag line ""I KILL YOU!"" is humorous, but doesn't come close to replacing ""on a stick"" in the Jeff Dunham lexicon.  This routine was slower and duller than Walter, but then again, I don't think Jeff has a puppet in his repertoire that wouldn't be a bit of a let down after Walter (the exception being Peanut of course).

Third is Melvin, the superhero without superpowers (except for a phallic looking long nose) who replaces ""Bubba J"".  The part of the routine was the dull point for me.  I found Melvin's humor very dry not all that funny...it dragged until finally...

Peanut, Jeff's hyperactive Puppet comes to the stage.  And here is the first time I have a complaint about Peanus routine:  IT WAS TOO SHORT!  After nearly falling asleep with Melvin I'm back to cracking up with Peanut--soon Jose Jalapeno makes an appearance...and then it's over...!!!
I realize Jeff is trying to branch out and find new ways to keep his act fresh, but give Peanut some more airtime as for your fans he--like Walter are the favorites.

All in all a good DVD, but if you're trying to decide which one to get, get Arguing with Myself first....much funnier.",1193097600,6,2422,4.601398601398602

It is amazing how he keeps all of the voices straight in his head, i mean one moment he's Jeff, then he's peanut, back to Jeff, and all the way to Jose jalepeno on a stick.

By the end of the performance, I was not saying, ""Jeff Dunham's funny"" - I was saying, ""THEY were great,"" even though I knew ""they"" were inanimate objects being manipulated by Jeff Dunham.

About the only thing I object to in this concert was Dunham's decision to deliver intolerant jokes through a heretofore untried dummy (Achmed the Dead Terrorist).  The jokes were fairly offensive but might have been received better through ""veteran"" dummy Walter.

Old favorites Peanut and Jose Jalapeno (on a stick) are back as well, and Dunham milks the audience's affection for these two delightful characters, but keeps the material fresh and topical without losing any of the charm they've maintained for so long.

Dunham is, unquestionably an artist both of ventriloquism and of sculpting, as is shown in the bonus footage of his creation of new character Melvin.  I hope this DVD will generate as much interest in his work as did his previous release, ""Arguing with Myself.""",1192924800,,1005,4.9880239520958085

I have been a fan of Jeff Dunham for many years and he just gets better each time I see him. One thing this is not really for kids. It's funny but some of the language is more for adults.

2. We got to see the Achmed puppet when he was in town when that part of the act was still very rough. (foot!) I enjoyed seeing him again.

3. Melvin has actually been around a while, but he's been surgically enhanced for this production.

I'd definitely say to add this to your collection, as well as ""Arguing with Myself"" so you can enjoy all the characters. It's very funny work. I'm a big fan of Jeff Dunham.

2882995,1,B000S6LS66,"I have been a Dunham fan for 15 years and have loved every moment of every routine I have ever seen Jeff perform. HOWEVER, this DVD is a huge dissapointment to me and my family.
First of all, Jeff seems to be under the false notion that people love his comedy with or without the dummies. THEY DON'T. He is simply not that funny solo. Yet in this DVD, he opens up with a painfully long monologue that is so not funny and filled with ""borrowed"" jokes from old comedians. When he finally does start into the dummies portion of his act, he seems to be just going through the motions. He seems disinterested at many times, his character voices all basically sound the same this time around and his energy level seems forced and fake. Perhaps the night they taped this live show, he wasn't feeling well or had a fight with his manager before he walked on stage, but this performance should NOT have been the one they made into a DVD.
If you are a true Jeff Dunham fan as I am, skip this DVD and wait for the live show to come your way. You do not want to see him like this, I assure you. (Jeff, if you are reading this, PLEASE stop doing the solo monologues and stick to your strengths. As a stand-up comedian, you are a mediocre amateur. As a ventriloquist, you are a GOD!) People buy tickets and DVD's to see the worlds greatest ventriloquist- nothing more.)",1192060800,10,1355,4.296875

What it boils down to, is this (and its very simple): This is one of the funniest and most tallented stand-up acts I have ever seen. You have your all-time greats like Pryor and (fill in your fav here) but did they hold three-way conversations at lightning speed and legibly conveying three unique voices with three different personalities? Either he has incredible tallent or he's related to Emily Rose.

In short, its fantastic - Excellent - pullamuscle funny - and man does it deliver. I saw him LIVE in May at the comedy club Stardome in Alabama, and this dvd is just as good. Highly recommended for you adults who need a change in pace. ~saos~",1191974400,14,880,4.634615384615385

The jokes were funny at times and there were only a few gut busters, unlike ""Arguing with Myself"" which was HILARIOUS. This seemed to be more of a family show than the first DVD. Still good but not great. Jeff Dunham's Arguing with Myself is WAY better and more geared towards adults!!!",1191888000,,451,4.7215189873417724

Walter and Peanut are by far my favorites, making me laugh so hard I literally couldn't breathe. Jose Jalapeno is, to me, funnier than he was in ""Arguing With Myself"" as he banters with Peanut over his green card and his BMW. Melvin the Superhero is a decent new addition to the pack, the funniest part of his bit having to be when his hair fell off and all I could focus on was his now-bald head and that Pinocchio nose of his.

If you are looking to laugh like you've never laughed before, literally until you cannot breathe, then I highly suggest getting ""Spark of Insanity."" Jeff Dunham and his band of crazy puppets is definitely something you have to see to believe.",1191628800,,767,4.478571428571429

He's a very friendly, personable guy, down to earth and not at all obnoxious or snotty like you would think he would be, given his talent and fame.  I recorded the Comedy Central version of this video at home and have watched it about 5 or 6 times now in the past week...and it's STILL funny!  I'm ordering the DVD so I can have the uncut version without the commercials and to get the bonus material.  This will go along with my other DVD by Jeff Dunham I purchased.  And if he releases anymore, I'll get them, too.  The guy and his little ""friends"" are just that funny!

By the way, I was wondering how one could create a character based on a terrorist bomber and have it be funny.  Jeff Dunham does it up beautifully with his skeleton-figured Ahmed the Suicide Bomber, and does it tactfully.  You've got to see this new character...hilarious!",1191628800,,994,4.387978142076503

I gotta be honest and admit to cringing a little - I had NO idea where that was going to go. But darn if he didn't pull it off. Very very funny... his catch-phrase in particular was hysterical... then those piercing eyes and over-the-top attitude which you couldn't possibly take seriously... amazingly creative (and bold).

So I hadn't seen this new character before. Another thing new (to me anyway) was the way Jeff Dunham did a bit of standup beforehand, just standing there talking to the audience long before he pulled out the fellas.",1191196800,13,724,4.519083969465649

Contrary to the one negative opinion I have read about the performance, I didn't have to gauge the reactions of audience members to know when it was time to laugh.  It was very funny, and I must say that his tackling an issue, such as terrorism, with comedy, was funnier than I would have even thought it would be.  Dunham is a very talented ventriloquist, with a fine sense of comedic timing.  I feel sorry for anyone who can't get a laugh out Spark of Insanity, their sense of humor is irreparably broken.

They became fans of Jeff and Peanut, too.

I thought this DVD was funnier than the ""Arguing with Myself"" one.  I loved the Dead Terrorist.  This program aired on Comedy Central and the DVD features some additional footage that didn't appear on Comedy Central.  The bonus features on the DVD are great.

Although I would suggest one thing: next time any guy out there talks about us Cubans, please remember two things: 1) No, we DO NOT consume chili, jalapenos or whatever (that is a MEXICAN custom, not Cuban) and 2) We have no idea back in Cuba what a taco is. In fact, that for us, means a completely different thing; and a tortilla for us is an omelet, not some floury thing that, by the way, we again DO NOT know anything about back there. But then, enough of that, and let's give a huge round of applause for this guy. He is simply BRILLIANT. And for those of you Latin guys who go: ""Oh this is wrong, politically incorrect..""

2883015,1,B000S6LS66,"At first I was intrigued by the idea of Comedy Central airing a ventriloquism act.  It's been a while since those were popular -- it reminds me of the days of variety shows.  It seems like you could really modernize the concept and have some fun with it.  I thought it has the potential to be funny, albeit childish.  So I watched the Jeff Dunham: Spark of Insanity show on TV.
I was extremely disappointed.  This Jeff guy is not all that funny in the first place.  He does some preliminary stand-up before he brings out the puppets, and I have to say, it just doesn't do it for me.  He's one of those comics that will make some sort of amusing but trite observation about something and calls that a joke (the ""new wave"" of comedy, coming fresh to your home since Jerry Seinfeld first became popular -- in the late 80's).  Granted, the jokes are amusing, but I'm being generous using that word.  It's just all been done before.
One of the things that stands out to me as a sign of a good stand-up comic is how they react to a joke not going over well.  A lot of comics just say something like, ""Hello? Are you listening?"" or ""Well that didn't go over well.""  The problem with Jeff is that he laughs at all of his own jokes (which works on some level when the puppets are making the joke, but ventriloquists are better off playing the straight man or it makes the act look like a bad sitcom where everyone is just standing around waiting to say their line which is a painfully obvious setup for the next punchline).  So when the audience is only slightly laughing, he just continues to enjoy his own joke by smiling and looking away from the audience ""regaining his composure,"" I suppose.  The audience (easily-amused and easily-persuaded as they are) usually feels a bit of collective awkwardness, which causes them to reevaluate the joke a bit, and they usually think ""Oh, maybe that WAS funny""  and start laughing as well.  You'd be surprised how many ""big laughs"" he coerces out of them in just this manner.  If he's really lucky, sometimes he even gets them to start hooting and clapping this way as modern audiences do to show that they approve and are aware how ""brilliant"" he is.  Of course he revels in it in his quiet, smiley sort of way.  He milks every joke he tells -- he just sits there and waits until it's funny.  It serves as further proof to me that todays comics are not as interested in performing a show well or having truly funny and original material as they are making people like them.  After the show when people are deciding whether or not they enjoyed the show they think to themselves, ""well I did laugh a lot.""  Most comics seem like the biggest bunch of friendless approval-hogs.  Jeff is their leader.
This is all going on throughout the show even while he has the puppets out.  Now never mind the idea that the simple concept of telling jokes with dolls might seem a bit goofy to the 21st-century mind.  The puppets, while colorful and seemingly well made to my untrained eye (although they are not entirely free from malfunction), are not funny.  Most are based on unimaginative, overworked stereotypes, or at least a twist on such (""what about an Arabian character.... who's dead!"").  Of course there's a hillbilly/redneck and a grumpy old white guy who makes jokes about how much he hates his wife (never seen that before!).  The voices work, and he certainly has a talent of switching between his and the puppets' easily, I'll give him that. But, come ON!  The jokes are just PATHETIC and so obvious, they borderline complete banality.
The only explanation I can think of as to why Jeff Dunham is doing this is that he was originally a stand-up comic doing the local scene.  He just plain sucked so he decided to spice up his act one day and go to ventriloquist school.  Somebody with connections to Comedy Central saw him and thought ""Wow!  This guy truly has a funny bit!""  Frankly, I don't know how people like this make it out of crappy Vegas shows.",1190592000,19,3989,4.489597780859917

2883018,4,B000S6LS66,"This is a great DVD. There are a few things about it that concern me a bit but not enough to recomend NOT getting it. 1) In the first 20-25 minutes of the DVD Jeff does a stand-up comic rutine that I felt ran a little long and winded when everyone is waiting for Walter and everyone to come out. 2) I felt that Jeff was pushing the envelope with the new ""dead terrorist"" bit. All be-it it was funny but was pushing the fine line of comedy and the not-so funny comments on jews and such. 3) I felt that Jose Halopinia (on a steek) did not get much stage time along with peanut. Peanut and Jeff did most of the talking while Jeff just held Jose there not using him as much in the act as I thought he would.
  Over all I rated the DVD with 4 stars. I still think Jeff and co are a hoot and is still a really good show. I still think this DVD is worth the money to buy for a great laugh. The bonus features are great as well.",1190505600,2,921,3.867724867724868
