8748071,3,B01ARYG1N8,"This is a pretty decent documentary and makes good use of it's limited running time to tell it's story but there are so many artists not even mentioned like Lonnie Mack, Roy Buchanan Son Seals and Johnny Winters that it feels incomplete. Like most docs of this type you're not going to get much in the way of contrary opinions and criticism from others in the industry. Nonetheless this is a good way to spend an hour and a half if you like contemporary blues. I was a bit disappointed not to see so much as a single photo, much less video footage, of Hound Dog Taylor seeing how important he was to the beginnings of the Alligator label.",1484092800,,638,4.369747899159663
8748072,5,B01ARYG1N8,Robert Mugge did a great job of pulling together all the bits and pieces needed to make this documentary.  Bruce Iglauer put together a great label with some of my all time favorite artists and a documentary about him and the artists on his label was well worth the effort it took.  If you get a chance then watching it will be well worth your time and you'll get to hear some great music as a bonus,1478476800,,399,4.1688311688311686
