389914,5,6301967070,"Lovely Judy Garland, an office worker, meets sensitive soldier Robert Walker, who has a two-day leave in New York. This is a charming and captivating love story. If you like World War II romances, as I do, you'll love this one.--Diana Dell, author, ""A Saigon Party: And Other Vietnam War Short Stories.""",990576000,2,303,4.846153846153846
389915,5,6301967070,"In no other film were Judy Garland's acting talents so perfectly matched to a character than in Vincente Minnelli's wartime love story, ""The Clock.""  This is a lesser known Garland film in which she does no singing but one that is a true testement to her towering acting abilities.  No other actress in Hollywood could have mustered up the right degree of emotional depth without becoming overly sentimental.  Much like an actress of the silent era, Garland had the ability to convey emotion and longing solely through her eyes.  In particular, the scene in the cafeteria after the rushed marriage when Garland's charcter Alice finally lets her emotions run free is stunning; the rage and confusion behind Alice's eyes manages to cut through celluloid and time and affect viewers 55 years later.  I believe this is Judy Garland's defining moment as an actress.",982022400,10,860,4.986013986013986
389916,5,6301967070,"While growing up, my mom would often mention memories of having seen ""The Clock"" with her mother on TV when she was a girl.  Just by  the outline of the plot she provided, I knew that I would love it (I'm a  sucker for a good romance).  When I saw it in a video store several years  ago, we were finally able to see it all together and it did not  disappoint.
Like the description says above, what makes ""The  Clock"" special is that it shows the little details on the road to  love.  We in the audience learn about and fall in love with these  characters as they learn about and fall in love with each other.  There's a  great moment, when, in the heat of an argument, Joe (Robert Walker) tells  Alice (Judy Garland), in a voice filled with wonder, ""You've got brown  eyes.""  Little moments like this make the story feel so real and pull  us into the romance.  Watching this film is like hearing your grandparents  tell the story of how they fell in love and got married.  It just has such  a warm, special feeling to it.
Another great scene comes near the end of  the film (I won't spoil it with any details) that is more romantic than any  of the sex scenes in modern movies:  it's played without dialogue, but we  can feel the intimacy between these characters merely in they way they look  at each other.  Judy Garland and Robert Walker give wonderful  performances.
""The Clock"" has been loved by three generations  in my family.  I know that it will be enjoyed and loved by generations to  come.",967593600,7,1500,4.329710144927536

389918,5,6301967070,"Dispelling ALL rumors that she was just another singer, Judy Garland captivated and amazed critics and audiences alike with her first dramatic role.  Even today it is still potent and full of emotion.  It's a  ""feel-good"" movie that rings out all emotions but is not  overplayed or histrionic.  It's moving and poignant featuring Garland at  her height in both popularity and beauty.  Robert Walker tends to slightly  overdo his character, but fits in well nonetheless.  A must-see, overlooked  classic.",945734400,3,503,5.253164556962025

389962,5,6301967070,"Years ago I found this movie in a Library, and watched it during the weekend. At that time I hadn't ever seen or even heard of this movie. It seemed interesting so I checked it out. This movie is so GOOD. It is about a soldier who has a forty-eight hour pass and goes to New York. ""ALICE"", Judy's Character, is returning from a trip when she trips over ""JOE"", Robert Walker's Character, and winds up showing him some of the sites of New York, which then, at ""Joe's"" request, causes her to breaks her previous date, which her roommate thinks she loopy for doing. While they are out on their date they wind up in a misadventure, which causes ""Alice"" to call off on her job the next morning. They then get separated at the Train Station, putting both of them in a bind because neither of them know the other one's last name. After much searching, they both wind back up at the train station, where they met. They both then realized that they were in love with each other and could have lost each other forever. So they decided to get married. They then run into bits of trouble as they try to get a license to wed. Their problem was they had to wait seventy-two hours before they could use the license. After getting ""Special Permission"" they married only for ""ALICE""  to fall apart because of their rushed-hurried way of getting married. They later came upon a couple, coming out of a Church, whom had just gotten married. They went in, sat down, and privately took their vows again with ""Alice"" declaring her love to ""Joe"". Then we are taken to the morning after their wedding, when ""Alice"" and ""Joe"" are having Breakfast and preparing for ""Joe's Departure"". In the last scene, ""Alice"" sees ""Joe"" leave. She then walks dreamily through the station as the camera pulls away from the scene, leaving her and us hopeful romantics waiting fatefully.

I saw this movie on VHS. I remember going to work on the following Monday, and saying: ""Hey, I saw a really great movie over the weekend called ""THE CLOCK"". Of course I was asked what was it about. I bought a copy of this movie in early 2007, on DVD, I think in March, from ""Columbia House"", my Pre-AMAZON buying from days. I tried viewing my copy not to long ago and something was wrong with it. I just cleaned it up today, with hopes that I won't have to buy another copy. As I'm viewing this, I'm hoping that I won't have to buy another copy. Anyway, I just got to the area in the movie when ""Alice"" and ""Joe"" have a little argument in a Restaurant, and he defuses the argument by telling her she has Brown Eyes. I thought that was really wonderful. This is probably my FAVORITE OF ALL OF JUDY GARLAND'S MOVIES. As I'm about to close this review, so far I've gotten to where they've been hanging out in the park and now ""Alice"" is trying to get home. So far, so good. Perhaps I won't have to buy another copy. Here's to hoping. In the meantime, buy this movie. IT'S GREAT!",1457395200,,2920,4.385608856088561

390008,4,6301967070,"I bought this film because I know the woman on whose parents the story was based during the war.  Her mother and father had a quick poignant marriage in New York before he was to sail overseas.  On the ship he met a Hollywood writer to whom he told his story, and that man wrote it up into a screenplay for Judy Garland.  This connection makes the film mean something to me.

I give it 4 stars because it is a story that is somewhat improbable today, especially with the naivete and innocence of these characters and the way they interact as they get to know one another, but that makes it a sweet telling of a story from another time, when girls and boys didn't fall into bed together, but let their feelings lead them toward imagining a life commitment together.",1359331200,6,764,4.359154929577465
390009,5,6301967070,"do I give 5 stars to a review.  But this film is different.  And special.  And unforgettable.

We all know that Judy Garland doesn't sing in it.  But she does.  With every camera angle and breath she takes, she sings and takes our breath away.  She's magnificent.  And so is Robert Walker.  Their chemistry is so evident that I wonder why they were never teamed again at MGM.  Or anywhere else.

Joan Crawford won the Oscar and still I don't know why Garland wasn't even nominated.  It's a great film.

Minnelli directs this film (after ""St. Louis"") as if he never saw Garland or Robert Walker or New York city in his life.  He films everything.  And we are the lucky audience to take it all in.  The camera humors Walker and makes love to Judy.

The story is no hokier than ""Mildred Pierce"" or whatever other film wound up on the Oscar roster that year.  Jennifer Jones? Greer Garson?  Ingrid Bergman?

Judy was, at this point in her career, ready, willing and able to take on such a role.  Such a romantic role.  She never had this chance again at MGM.  Shame on them.

For once she sheds the musical girl next door personae and ACTS.  Not only ACTS. but acts like she never would again until ""A Star Is Born"" several years later.  Yes, it's MGM and yes, it's Minnelli, but if ever a studio, star, and director met, it is with this film.",1336348800,3,1339,4.341463414634147

390043,4,6301967070,"Judy Garland in New York in a romance in 1945, plus an intriguing contemporary review by the famous critic James Agee drew me in. Had never heard of the film before. Did love it. Aroused a lot of emotions and sentiments related to that time period to which I am partial. Judy Garland great and completely believable as the type of character she played. Atmosphere of film, the cramped, crowded, well-worn, shabby offices, restaurants, train stations and hotel lobbies, enlivened by the energy and purpose unleashed by the war, I like, and it feels authentic, though I was not there at the time.

Film has a very subtly, perhaps even unconsciously modernist undertone that I did not pick up on until several days afterwards. It is taken for granted in the mentality of the movie that the world is a giant machine which has to be kept running on schedule, and anyone who interferes with or doesn't keep up with the maintenance of the machine will find himself getting shredded. The characters are constantly under the constraints of clocks and schedules, curfews, train and bus timetables, delivery routes, closing hours of offices and restaurants, all of which they are in large part dependent on for the substance of their lives. The clock of the title refers to the place they agree to meet for their date, for which Alice is actually a half-hour late. Joe persistence in waiting, seemingly against hope, as the clock moves well past the appointed time and life continues to rush on all around him becomes almost poignant.

Ultimately I think if you have positive feelings about 1940s America and/or Judy Garland, you will probably like the film, and if you don't, you won't. There is nothing intellectually stimulating in it apart from whatever you bring to the material yourself.",1271548800,,1782,4.858552631578948
390044,4,6301967070,"Thoroughly enjoyable, and truly an underrated classic of wartime cinema.  Judy Garland is wonderful as the young girl who falls in love with a soldier on leave, nearly loses him, and finally marries him.  The series of mishaps in which they get separated from each other in the subway, then madly and desperately try to find each other, is an ingenius bit of screen writing.  When they finally find each other again, marry after another series of ill-timed, skin-of-the-teeth incidents and mishaps, feel somehow cheated because of the haphazard manner of their wedding, then have a blissful morning after scene of wedded contentment, the viewer feels as contented as they.  The tension is resolved beautifully.  The clock is a symbol, not just a meeting place for them -- the movie seems to be about time, and the lack of it in wartime, for personal happiness.  Time moves frenetically in the movie, creating breakneck tension, then finally resolving into peace at the end.  I highly recommend this movie; it's worth repeated viewings.  Judy Garland should have received a bit more acclaim for her fine performance here.",1267315200,6,1120,5.0162162162162165

Judy Garland gives a lovely, non-singing role, and Keenan Wynn and James Gleason, two terrific character actors, lend warmth and humor. (And if you have any doubt about Robert Walker's acting ability , watch this movie and then ""Strangers on a Train"". He died tragically before the movie was released, but left an outstanding performance in his portrayal of the psychopathic killer, Bruno Anthony.)",1254096000,3,973,7.3076923076923075
390047,5,6301967070,"Chick-flicks don't hold much appeal for me. Not that I have anything against romance, but I think that a lot of movies go way overboard with the love story. My personal opinion is that, generally, romance comes across more smoothly in the context of another genre (action adventure, mystery, musical comedy, etc.) Now, of course there are exceptions, but when I read the synopsis for the 1945 World War II film, The Clock, I was skeptical of how well I would like it. Because it features Judy Garland, one of my favorite actresses, I begrudgingly decided to give it a try despite the fact that the story seemed suspiciously chick-flick-ish...

Joe is a soldier from a small town bewildered to find himself in New York City during a layover. Alice has lived in New York for a few years as a sensible working girl. When she loses the heel of her shoe after tripping over the lonely soldier, they strike up an unlikely friendship that eventually leads to a whirlwind romance. But time, for him, is running out. As the clock's hands move towards his departure, the young lovers become desperate not to let anything end their newfound love for each other.

This movie could have taken so many wrong turns and become just another sentimental 1940s romance. However, even though the plot seems trite, the story is captured with refreshing naturalness. Judy Garland, famous for her role as Dorothy in The Wizard of Oz, turns in a lovely performance as the conflicted young woman who finds herself falling for a soldier against the advice of her bossy roommate. Robert Walker plays Joe, the inexperienced and kindhearted Midwestern boy with the utmost sincerity.

In fact, sincere is probably the best word for the whole production. You don't stop to question the story or the characters, because they all exude a real-life quality. The acting is excellent throughout the film, including the minor bit parts. James and Lucille Gleason, a real life married couple, are especially memorable as the elderly milkman and his wife who encourage Joe and Alice not to let fear influence their decisions. ""If people thought about all the things that could happen, they'd never do anything,"" is what the experienced couple tells the young lovers.

The very talented Director Vincente Minnelli captured the all of the subtle nuances of the story with grace and poignancy. At the time, he and Judy Garland were falling in love with each other, and were married soon after the filming wrapped. He filmed Judy as she had never been filmed before: as a gorgeous, sophisticated young woman full of beauty and love. The audience cannot help but fall in love with her, just as her director did. Consequently, I believe that this is one of the most romantic movies I have ever seen.

Is it a chick-flick? Well...maybe. Is it worth watching? Oh, definitely.",1253836800,5,2828,4.846790890269151
390048,4,6301967070,"""The Clock"" is rather sweet and touching WWII era story of a NYC working woman (Judy Garland) who meets a soldier (Robert Walker) on brief military leave.

There are a couple of especially curious moments in the movie.  One is a scene in a diner in which a strange woman is eating in a bizarre and unrealistic manner.  Another occurs when Garland is walking while touching a number of statues, and eventually sits, with her shoes off, at the base of one statue. But there are also a number of moving scenes, such as when Walker and Garland are at the home of a happily married milkman and his wife - especially the look Walker gives Garland as he silently observes her talking.

""The Clock"" is also enjoyable for the shots of the city's 1940s locales (such as the old Penn Station) intertwining this love story.  In fact, the bustling city, which dwarfs the characters, comes across as both a protagonist and antagonist as the relationship develops.",1250985600,,949,4.658682634730539
390049,5,6301967070,"Actually the romance between the two stars seems more realistic since we aren't privvy to all of their sexual hangups or bedtime details and can concentrate on the emotional interface. The shots of '40's New York are great and if you have an HDTV with a progressive scan DVD player, the sharpness of this movie in widescreen is excellent. This is the New York I remember from many childhood trips up from Washington and the people are realistic. Walker's dialogue is silly at first but as the plot unwinds he sounds more and more normal. If you can get through the first ten minutes or so with the hayseed dialogue and hang on in until they get on the bus you will be fine. It is interesting from a historical standpoint to view the military presence in Penn Station and all over town. During the war this was the way it was. I doubt that the majority of the travellers in the station were extras.",1237766400,,897,4.442424242424242
390093,5,6301967070,"I first saw this movie when I was eight years old and ten years later I still have not grown tired of it. It is one of those films which gets better with each viewing. The deceivingly simple love story of a young woman and a GI who fall in love and get married within 24 hours seems formulaic. But this film is anything but formulaic. The characters are unique and down-to-earth. What I liked best about this film is the way you can imagine what life was like in New York in the 1940s. The mannerisms of people and the mood of the America in this movie are so different from today, yet the film has aged well and is still relatable. Anyone who has ever felt bewildered in a new city could connect to Robert Walker's character (it is everybody's dream to find his/her soulmate by accident in a strange city populated by millions!) The film is may be slow-paced for some,  but don't let this discourage you. By the end, you'll be surprised how completely immersed you'll be in the story and the characters. The film, besides starring Judy Garland in her only non-musical role, has an excellent supporting cast and is directed by the talented Vincent Minnelli. And as a side note, the beautiful musical score of the movie amplifies all the emotions in the film. Don't be surprised if you get watery eyes.",1206748800,5,1301,4.466386554621849
390094,2,6301967070,"Compared to most of the other reviews, I'm sure mine will seem like a cynical, bitter pill.  I'm under the age of 50, so I'm sure that might have something to do with my opinion as well.

Listen: I love movies from the golden era as much as the next guy, but this overly sentimental bomb is saved only by Judy's presence in an otherwise near-psychotic piece of Hollywood drivel. I'd rather watch Wizard of Oz, at least I know I'm watching a fairy tale ahead of time.

Since others have given the basic plot line, I'll skip to the parts that I thought were completely implausable.

It takes a great deal of suspended disbelief to swallow this movie.  The fact that they have not exchanged more than first names after 24 hours is a great example.  People do more than that even in today's fast-paced dating scene, so I'm sure that in that age you'd need a bit more info before falling in love and getting married, regardless of impending war.

The dialogue in the park scene was absurd and the odd music (complete with angelic vocals)under the scene where they somehow unrealistically fall in love made it seem extremely... well, unrealistic.

A ride from the milkman in order to get home from the park?  Sure, I'll swallow that.  Delivering the milk for him?  I doubt it, even in that innocent time.

Then we get to the cafe scene.  Pure Fellini.  The drunk and the extremely odd woman at the bar made it seem like a nightmare scene at best. More odd was the fact that Judy's character just smiled, chatted and drank her coffee during the whole scene, nearly oblivious.

The ""let's get married right now"" and ""we have to get a liscense and blood test before 4:00 PM"" writing, acting and montages were all heavy-handed at best. And the wacky dialogue and plot turns through this section made the film fall lower than it should have.

My favorite scene: During the wedding dinner at the cafe, when Alice laments her wedding as ""ugly"" and cries. The whole drama is being watched by the kitchen help at the next table, strategically placed close and dead-center in the shot between the two stars, simply ruining an otherwise nice bit of acting.

Minnelli might have known what to do with musicals, but he bruised this movie with poor choices throughout. Parts of this turkey were downright laughable, and not in the right places.",1200009600,6,2324,4.588377723970944

Walker is likable as the earnest hayseed, and doe-eyed Garland is grand as ever without once singing a tune. (Minnelli, of course, married Judy as soon as the film wrapped!)

390099,5,6301967070,"I thought I had seen all of Vincente Minnelli's greatest films, well, I was so wrong... 'The Clock' is truly comparable to his great 'Meet Me in St. Louis', 'Gigi', 'The Band Wagon'... He has so many great classics, but I believe this one may be his third best.

As it starts you don't expect anything great: an aerial view of New York, Central Station, lots of people going on their daily routines... it goes increscendo though. And how! This is the romantic story of a young soldier (Robert Walker) in 1945 who has a couple of free days to spend in NYC before returning to serve in the Army (probably to go to England). He's never been in the big city before but he will meet a girl (Judy Garland) who will show him around. Love is in the making meanwhile, but there's only 2 days to spend. What can happen in two days? Well, that's exactly what they both are thinking too, while watching at the ""clock"" to see how much time is left for them together (more rapport between the characters and the viewers is hardly possible).

I say this film is perfect because it looks so simple, its story, its characters... it must be really difficult to tell when there's not that much plot going on. But the viewer gets so involved with these young couple that he won't have time to blink. I mean, every second of film is purposeful, meaningful, and beautiful. You can't do more with less. That's why Minnelli is one of the greatest American directors, comparable to Ford, Hawks, Vidor... Personally, it took me some minutes to forget Robert Walker's role in 'Strangers on a train', which left an indelible impression on me. He wouldn't be my first choice at all  for this  role, but he is fine. A must see classic.",1177977600,7,1705,4.472668810289389

The Clock was made in a day before ""realism"" was incorporated into movies and it is interesting to see that even when a story about everyday people is put on film by MGM, the gloss is still apparent.  It is a product of its time but nonetheless beautiful to watch and very moving at times.",1175472000,5,458,4.7
390133,4,6301967070,"Vincente Minnelli may be known as one of the greatest musical directors, if not the greatest. But when it comes to depict the eternal human character or tell us a sentimental story, he is also unique,as can be proved by his non-musical films such as ""Madame Bovary"", ""The Bad and the Beautiful"", ""Lust for Life"", ""Tea and Symphaty"", ""Some Came Running"", etc. Having seen them all during my long cinephile career, ""The Clock"" was a precious unknown piece for me which I was trying to see since years. And the result was far from being disappointing. The storyline is simple: a soldier on leave for only 24 hours meets a girl in the Central Station of New York, they fall in love and get married. Departing from this basic story, the tasteful artist suceeds to create a unique war time atmosphere, in a city where the busy daily life still goes on, but with something in the air filled with a typical feeling of ""anything can happen now"". And we all know, since films as ""Casablanca"" and alike, that love in war time has to be in a hurry, that even minutes count and there is no space for words like patience or waiting. Therefore, the effort of the young couple to achieve their formalities of marriage gets as breathtaking as an action movie. n this film which she made for Vincente Minnelli right after the marvelous musical ""Meet Me in Saint-Louis"", Judy Garland is as magfnificient as ever,this time even more natural and more herself without the Technhicolor and fancy musical dresses. That was the time when she was about to get married with Minnelli. Robert Walker whom you might remember from his portrayal of a murderer in Hitchcock's ""Strangers on a Train"" is as convincing as ever. Does anyone remember that he was the belowed husband of Jennifer Jones who, at the edge of stardom, was stolen from him by the mighty producer David O'Selznick? Consequently, he became an alcoholic and died from an overdose. Things that happen!...Don't miss this small-scale, but charming movie.

Even though she doesn't sing in it,  it won't matter,  you will see her as an actress, which was what she wanted to be, not just a voice.  It is subtle in the love story and story itself.  Boy meets girl,  boy takes girl out to deliver milk,  boy loses girl,  boy finds girl, boy marries girl and boy leaves for war.  Vincente Minnelli was the perfect choice for directing this, he uses New York as a character that works against them,  but Boy and Girl make it through and marry.  It is a lovely love story.  Robert Walker is very sweet in it too.  Also Judy has a crying jag in almost every one of movies,  and this is the best/saddest crying scene.  Also look for Roger Edens (her mentor) playing the piano in the restraunt scene.  It is a must for all Judy Garland fans and those who love a good love story",1173657600,4,909,4.079545454545454

They spend the afternoon and night together, fall in love, and get married the next day basically racing time before Robert Walker's character's leave is up. I love the whole concept of love in 24 hours marriage in 48 hours & although they have to part at the end perhaps temporarily or forever you still have a little smile on your face knowing that the two had such a awesome time being in love.

It's also ironic that the 2 leads were already well along their respective paths to self destruction (Alcholic Robert Walker died only 6 years later). One of the lesser known jewels in the MGM crown; one that never makes any lists of classic films or great movie love stories, but should be acknowledged as one!

There is no swearing in this movie, no sex, no violence, just old fashioned romance and the display of the powerful need for love in human beings.

390140,4,6301967070,"A sincere piece of treacle just before the end of WWII, this 1945 romantic drama features a never-lovelier Judy Garland in her only non-singing role during her golden MGM years. Even though she is a talented enough actress without having to vocalize, she is in a movie that feels like a musical in its cinematic sensibilities - swooning romanticism, quicksilver plot turns and broad stock characters. That shouldn't come as a surprise since her then-fianc Vincente Minnelli directed and Arthur Freed produced, both much better known for their musicals of the period. Still, they have made a sweet film with worthwhile stylistic touches such as the use of long zoom shots in maneuvering through the swarming crowds in the subway and train stations and the screen panning used in showing the mini-dramas of background characters we never see again.

Garland plays Alice, an office worker who meets Joe, a young soldier on a 48-hour furlough, through a  mishap with her heel at Pennsylvania Station. From there, they awkwardly become drawn to each other starting with a Fifth Avenue double-decker bus ride, a walk through Central Park, a dinner date, a late night in another park, a post-midnight drive with an amusing milkman caught in an inadvertent left hook from a mouthy drunkard, breakfast with the milkman and his equally feisty wife and then the sudden decision to marry. Written by Paul and Pauline Gallico, the plot gets more melodramatic in the second half but becomes more emotionally resonant with Garland particularly shining in a crying scene where she realizes her wedding is not what she quite expected.

A callow Robert Walker plays Joe in his familiar golly-gee manner, a far cry from his sinister, penultimate work in Hitchcock's ""Strangers on a Train"" but nonetheless a sincerely affecting performance. Together, they manage to make the sudden relationship palpable and convey the urgency of their wartime situation. James Gleason as the milkman and his real wife Lucile Gleason as his wife in the film provide some nice moments, though I could have done without Keenan Wynn's unfunny turn as the drunkard and Ruth Brady as Alice's advice-giving roommate Helen. George J. Folsey's black-and white cinematography is quite striking. This is definitely worth seeking for Garland's poignant work in particular.",1160524800,4,2324,5.159151193633952

390183,4,6301967070,"Turner Classic Movies just ran it, and it is, in a word, breathtaking. What I especially love is the duality of Robert Walker and Judy Garland: they are both simple, lonely souls who literally stumble over each other one day, then get repeatedly teamed up in a series of seemingly innocent adventures (they ride a double decker bus; she shows him Central Park; he shows her an art museum)- each time attempting to part company but continuing to draw towards each other. When you analyze it, their courtship is almost fantastic, but the time of the film's 1945 release more than allows for the magic of budding romance. It is not really a sugary film; all the while the two leads communicate, you can see the improbability of their situation on their faces. When a milkman rescues them from being stranded at the end of a long date- and they wind up delivering his milk route- they burst out laughing at their situation. It makes a later scene of a subway separation particularly heartbreaking, and its later reunion at a train depot breathtaking (I guarantee tears in your eyes)- and that's sort of what the movie's all about. In retrospect, it's a bit ironic to watch the young sweetness of Walker and Garland- two stars who had tragic, frequently unhappy existences. Their chemistry here as strangers who become friends who fall in love is mesmerizing. Ms. Garland does not sing, but her dark, exquisite eyes are music to the camera lens. Several bios have cited this film and MEET ME IN ST LOUIS as the two films which really captured a beautiful Judy Garland, and I suspect that has something to do with the elegant taste and artistry of the director- who was in love with (and would soon marry) his star.

This is a sensual, Romantic and Dramatic film. Not something that Judy Garland was known for. Upon her request to do a Non singing film her husband Vincente Minnelli directed the song bird in her fist non singing film. As the story unfolds The two strangers Alice and Joe meet, fall in love and Marry in 48 hours, Yes 48 Hours, but they go through quite a bit in the during war romance. They meet under The Clock at 7 for a date and in that same night walk through Central park and share a passionate Kiss, then they decide to get married, But while they are in Grand Central station they accidently lose eachother and spend what time (Joe) has left before his leave is up.

390185,4,6301967070,"This is a delightful B&W film from 1945 starring Judy Garland in her first non singing role, playing a rather naive secretary who is working in New York but who still has her small home town outlook on life and values. Into her life comes her co-star, Robert Walker, playing a soldier during World War II, on a weekend pass to New York before he has to report back to camp.
They meet after she loses her heel on the subway and Robert Walker (Joe) asks her to show him the city. They eventually spend the day together but miss their last bus only to be given a lift by a milkman, after helping him to do his morning round. They both fall in love and decide to get married and there is a terrific race against time to obtain the necessary legal papers in order and meet the time deadline before Joe has to return to ""Uncle Sam"".
It is rather refreshing to see films like this where the actors actually speak to each other and there is no sex or violence but lovely old fashioned courting on screen.

The delicate, deliberate pace of their budding romance swiftly gives way to a panicked rush to marry, as they realize he's about to leave within hours, possibly never to return...

390187,5,6301967070,"New York's well known PBS station, Channel 13, ran this movie the weekend before September 11, 2002. That may have been fortuitous, or there just may be real a programming whiz there. Vincente Minnelli's THE CLOCK is just about as perfect a cinematic valentine to New York City as you're going to get. In many ways this 1945 movie--filmed during another critical period of U.S. and world history--relates perfectly to our experience today. Even people who don't ""heart symbol NY"" (not a camp I fall into, by the way, but I know there are those megalopophobics out there) will shed a tear or two for our lost innocence.
And it was, certainly, a more innocent era. Heck, this was a New York City where you could loll safely around Central Park until well past midnight--and then maybe hitch a ride with a passing milkman, of all things!
Robert Walker and Judy Garland are just about perfect as sweet boy-and-girl next door types who meet cute--as industry types say, or maybe less ""cute"" than innocent--in the big city, have a whirlwind courtship and race to marry while he is on a 48 hour leave before shipping out to fight in Europe. Their small town naivete (she's been there a year or so, but still has down home ways) is played off against urban gruffness, which is not to be confused with rudeness or indifference. The dyed-in-the-wool New Yorkers they bump up against are more like endearingly gruff uncles or eccentric aunts.
And some, like the older couple they meet up with and who pretty much inspire the youngsters to take the marital plunge, are just the salt of the earth. It's hard to come away from this movie without a warm glow. Heck even the (haphazardly) violent drunk played by a young Keenan Wynn is basically a mensch at heart.
The story and screenplay stemmed from Paul Gallico's writerly pen, and that may, in part, explain the intelligent dialog and the real sense of humanity with which all the characters and the city itself are imbued. It's a sweet movie, but if you're expecting pure corn syrup, you're in for a surprise. Life-affirming does not necessarily mean reality-denying, and there's a tinge of melancholy throughout the film. Minnelli and Garland proved once again to be a great cinematic team. Help from a very able supporting cast and an intelligent script make for a true classic.
I was suprised to see in the notes above that this film was not a huge success upon its relese, but after doing a little informal research of my own, I guess it's true that the film was, relatively speaking little seen. When I speak of it to people who would likely have seen it or at least would know of its existence, I'm surprised at how many scratch their heads and profess never to heard of it. The Amazon critic above cites the fact that the war was already drawing to a close upon the film's release as the main reason for its relative obscurity. The fact that it was not the splashy musical Judy fans may have come to expect may have been another. One nice thing about film, though, 57 years later it's still not too late to catch up.",1032134400,9,3063,4.60146252285192
