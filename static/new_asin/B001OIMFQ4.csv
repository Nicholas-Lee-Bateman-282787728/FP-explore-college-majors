3730376,5,B001OIMFQ4,"Great movie! The singing is sensational and the movie is very  interesting and funny. It has a little bit of everything I strongly recommend it if you like romance/comedy/great singing. By the way, this specific video has Portuguese subtitles but it didn't bother me at all.",1361404800,3,274,4.956521739130435
3730377,2,B001OIMFQ4,"to me, not one of the best movies, but it was good , It has the subtitles, at the bottom, and the picture is not all that clear,",1360281600,,128,3.607142857142857
3730378,2,B001OIMFQ4,"This movie ""It's a Date"" was not Deanna Durbins best acting role. I have bought all her movies but this one was
  disappointing to me, I can not recommend this movie. Sharon.",1357344000,,174,4.40625
3730379,5,B001OIMFQ4,I felt relaxed whenever I watch her movie. She has a very lovely voice. I have collected most of her movies and its worth having them.,1340582400,5,134,4.1923076923076925
3730380,5,B001OIMFQ4,"The movies with Deanna Durbin are ""feel good"" entertainment.
You laugh along with a few tears.  I have quite a few and I
enjoy viewing them over and over.
They are wonderful shows and you feel good afterwards.",1335052800,9,209,4.5
3730381,4,B001OIMFQ4,"I was not paying attention when I ordered product that the cover & menu of movie would be in Portuguese, but the movies are in English so that is great.  I love Deanna Durbin & her movies!  I have quite a few of her movies & enjoy them.",1332288000,8,236,3.8958333333333335

8330668,5,B001OIMFQ4,Again most enjoyable like all her DVD's,1405382400,,39,4.714285714285714
8330669,5,B001OIMFQ4,The plot is simple but enjoyable.  The reason that I buy the Deanna Durbin DVD's is for her singing.  She is great.,1401148800,,115,4.181818181818182
8330670,5,B001OIMFQ4,Very nice perfomance by Durban and co-actors. Well engineered comedy.  Bonus feature also very good except for some lack of focus in some instances.  Good buy - Surprised to see it imported - from Brazil??,1395446400,,205,4.828571428571428
8330671,5,B001OIMFQ4,"She thrills us and enthralls us...she was magic on the screen, it was a shame she left the screen so young...",1392336000,,109,4.238095238095238
8330672,5,B001OIMFQ4,"This DVD is another to add to one's collection of the marvellous films of the late and very much missed Deanna Durbin. The film is ""It's a Date"", don't be put off by the title ""Rival Sublime"" this is an alternative title given to the film by the DVD producers as this originates from South America. As long as you turn off the subtitles the film is in fact ""It's a Date"". Unless of course you are non English speaking in which case the subtitles are excellent. This film is hard to come by and it is great that this version is available from Amazon. The story is the usual froth that one expects from most of these films but the cast of characters are, as always, extremely likeable and the singing is wonderful. The quality of the film is quite acceptable and if you are a fan of the work of Deanna Durbin you will definitely need to get this DVD.",1374969600,5,848,4.2407407407407405
8330673,4,B001OIMFQ4,"Feature songs include ""Love is All"",  ""Loch Lomin"", Musetta's Waltz and Ave Maria (Schubert version).  Excellent cast includes Kay Frances, Walter Pidgeon, Samuel Hinds.
But it's Durbin's beautiful voice, charm and comic acting that make the film.
The Portuguese subtitles can be easily killed. From the menu choose ""legendas"" and ""sem legendas"".
The video is slightly degraded - this appears to be made from the VHS original. The audio is just fine.",1368057600,4,450,5.236111111111111
8330674,5,B001OIMFQ4,"If you enjoy older films and truly beautiful singing, you should enjoy these films. Highly recommended. Durbin is especially charming.",1366502400,,134,5.75
8330675,5,B001OIMFQ4,"The DVD played perfectly, good sound and video.

Deanna Durbin is the singing talent by which all other female vocalists should be compared with. On a scale of 1 to 10 she is a 15.

A cute and funny story, with beautiful singing.

Any a singing teacher can simply point to Deanna Durbin and tell her student, ""Sing Like That"" !",1363046400,,327,4.327868852459017
8330676,5,B001OIMFQ4,Bought this for my mother who is in a nursing home.  We enjoyed watching this together.  Deanna Durbin had an incredible voice which is timeless.  This is in English.  Great value.,1362355200,,180,4.709677419354839
