7626624,4,B01BDQOZLY,"Alright as a HUGE Psycho fan I got this in early last week from Scream Factory. I wanted to get my film early so that's why I didn't keep my order through amazon but enough on that lets talk the film and Blu-ray release. Psycho IV: The Beginning is a 1990 made for TV movie. It aired on Showtime on November 10th 1990 and stars Anthony Perkins playing Norman Bates one last time before he died, Olivia Hussey, Henry Thomas and C.C.H Pounder. Screenplay by Joseph Stefano and directed by Mick Garris. The film itself is suppose to be the 4th in the series of films but Psycho IV ignores 2 and 3 and is a direct sequel to the 1960 Psycho film. The film starts out in a radio station with Fran played ""Pounder"" hosting a radio talk show and the subject is why do boys kill there mothers. Norman Bates ""Perkins"" calls in and from there he tells his story of why he killed his mother. Norman wants to kill again and you found out as the film goes on that it's 30 years later and he is married and it's his birthday. His wife is pregnant and he told her he didn't want to have a child because he was afraid his seed is evil and wanted the Bates name to end with him. Fran eventually figuring out that he is Norman Bates tries to keep him on the line so he doesn't kill Eventually Norman hangs up and tells his wife to meet him at his old house. As the movie ends Norman fights his demons and burns down the bates house and is set free to live away from the demons he is haunted by. Henry Thomas played young Norman Bates and he did a alright job in my eyes and Olivia Hussey played Norma. I thought she was great. That's my basic synopsis of the film I didn't want to spoil too much. The film again is 30 years after the events of the first film and ignores Psycho 2 and 3. It has some really great moments and Perkins is amazing as always playing the part. The rest of the cast is a hit or miss but this is the only film that goes back to the past and shows how he became killer Norman. It's got it's really cheesy moments and over the top moments but I dig the flash backs and for a TV made film, it was good. Now enough about the film let's talk about the Blu-ray itself which is top quality, crisp picture and clear sound. The sound was perfect and Bernard's Psycho score blasts beautifully through the TV. Now those are pros on my half and the behind the scenes in the bonus features which was home videos taken on set. The rest of the bonus features lacked so much. I was hoping for interviews with Director Mick Garris, Olivia Hussey and Henry Thomas. There is only a commentary with the film with all 3 of them speaking about it but no interviews. I was disappointed with that and  no slip cover. This is not a collectors edition like the first 2 sequel releases. Interview with Tony Gardner was pretty good and pics from the film. Overall the Blu-ray release was not super great. Psycho 3 still has the best bonus features. Psycho 2 and IV lacked in that department and the lack of slip cover is disappointing. Overall the film is pretty good but I'm rating the Blu-ray release which will be 4 stars out of 5. Could of had more but for the price I cannot complain it would of gone down 1 if the price was more. I highly recommend it for you Psycho fans out there.",1472083200,4,3266,4.15955766192733

7626626,5,B01BDQOZLY,"I often wonder what Alfred Hitchcock would have thought about the sequels generated around the iconic Norman Bates character that he visually created in his 1960 film PSYCHO. Joseph Stefano's original screenplay was superbly realized under Hitchcock's direction and Anthony Perkins' portrayal of Bates. Stefano is back at the scripting helm on this movie, which was originally produced for the home Pay-TV market. PSYCHO IV is composed of a series of flashes from Bates' present (where Bates is engaged in interesting banter between a psychoanalyst and a Radio Phone-In host) to his past (where Bates recalls his painful and dysfunctional childhood). I have pondered the merits of this film over time. Where the character of Norman Bates may have been a screen creation of Hitchcock and Stefano, it is Perkins who owns this role and he has it down to a perverse yet enigmatic attraction for the viewer. Anthony Perkins is Norman Bates and that is the main appeal of this move and it is worth seeing.",1381190400,,999,4.9880239520958085

8749897,5,B01BDQOZLY,"This story starts with Norman Bates calling in a radio store from his wife's home.  It goes back in time to what caused Norman's problems.  It sticks so close to the original and answers all the questions we all had after seeing the original.  Henry Thomas plays the young Norman and it was amazing casting.  His acting is great, he looks like he could have grown up to look like Anthony Perkins, and he's even left-handed as is Anthony Perkins.  Olivia Hussey plays the demanding, manipulative, and crazy mother perfectly.  I love it not only because the boyfriend of Mrs. Bates was a close personal friend of mine (though that's why I watched it initially) but because it really is that good a film.",1521849600,,701,4.612903225806452
8749898,1,B01BDQOZLY,"Psycho IV, 1990 film

The story begins with a radio talk show about matricide. Raymond talks for his therapy and how he was paroled. [Can you believe this talk?] This provides a background. Then Ed calls in about this subject! We see past history about Norman Bates. A girl gets out of an old car and makes an offer to him. [Believable?] Unhook me. Is it a good smell? What was that noise? Mother talks to Norman. [You know what will happen next.] Has this story lost its shock value? [Is the movie being drawn out?] Does the talk provide any value? His father was stung to death by bees. Next we see a teenaged Norman. It keeps getting worse. Did jealousy motivate him? Is his problem due to genetics? Was his mother going crazy? Is the story embarrassing? Should they call the police? [Yes!]

There is another flashback. [The convention in some murder mysteries is to have a nasty person wind up as the murder victim.] There is a squabble at the radio station. Ratings count, whatever it takes. [Note how the announcer steers the conversation.] Remember glass bottles for milk and orange juice? Good toast. Can Norman learn to box? [What does he do in school?] This movie says Norman used strychnine. Does that leave signs on the victim? One false fact is Norman talking about a murder gene [in the 1950s]. Children of murderers do not become murderers (as with H. H. Holmes). He poisoned us. Norman increases his body count. [Two deaths but no coroners inquest?] They certainly emphasize the horror! Will Normans wife become the next victim? What are we doing here? [Watching the worst movie of the year.]

Connie wants a strong and healthy baby. They go up the stairs. Norman gets that big butcher knife. Connie decides it is time to leave. [Again this story is drawn out for added suspense.] Look at yourself. No more blood. Norman appears to have recovered. He will burn down this Second Empire mansion to get rid of his memories. But his memories return. These scenes are both funny and embarrassing. Im free. [Note how that mansion is smaller on the outside than suggested by its interior rooms.] Will they live happily ever after? [I doubt it.]

If the producers lost money is serves them right. Was this a surprising horror movie? Or some sort of educational movie? None of the above. [Silence of the Lambs had more horror.] Would a psycho serial killer like Norman Bates ever be released in the real world? Not in Wisconsin.",1501200000,,2435,4.655813953488372
8749899,3,B01BDQOZLY,"Listen, Norman Bates is on the radio, merrily yapping about his misspent youth with Fran (CCH Pounder), another mother killer and his dad, plus a snarky psychologist who once treated Norman.  He regales them with tales of his younger years with his extremely crazy mother (Olivia Hussey as Mama Bates).  This supposedly gives one insight into the behavior of poor Norman (Anthony Perkins) and why he ended up a mass murder that no one could confine behind bars no matter how many people he butchered.  Proving that you can get away with murder as long as you have a good excuse.  In this case, Mama made him do it.

The flashbacks zip in and out of the supposed present where Norman admits on air that he is thinking of killing his wife.  There is some rudimentary suspense that immediately gets lost with all the time traveling.

The actors know their craft, I don't fault them.  But this movie comes off as a glib explanation that purposely ignores the other two features in the series.",1489363200,2,988,4.637931034482759
