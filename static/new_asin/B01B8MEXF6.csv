7624051,5,B01B8MEXF6,"Everything Heidi Songs does is awesome! There are catchy jingles and motions for each letter of the alphabet and it's sound. I highly recommend this dvd, as well as her Sounds Fun DVD, which focus on phonic/digraphs like ch, sh, ng, ay, and aw.",1481328000,,244,4.568181818181818

7624053,5,B01B8MEXF6,Love the flexibility of the DVD. I have the online subscription last year and this is easier to navigate to find the letters that my kindergarteners need right then for review. The letter formation and the sound each letter makes is excellent. LOVE Heidi's products!,1474675200,,266,4.933333333333334

7624055,5,B01B8MEXF6,"I absolutely loved the Letters & Sounds Animated DVD by Heidi Songs. I ventured onto her website and was in awe of all of her helpful tips to get my 4 year old more involved in letter learning. Wow, what a difference this DVD has made! He is now making the sounds with the letters and matching them together. It also helps that the songs are very catchy and repetitive. I found the length of the DVD to be just right, especially for the attention span of small children. This is the perfect DVD for a preschool or kindergarten setting. Overall, I was very impressed.",1468281600,,566,4.4
7624056,5,B01B8MEXF6,"Daughter loves to sing, so she really enjoys this.",1462233600,,50,4.666666666666667
7624057,5,B01B8MEXF6,"I loved how the music video included phonics and how to draw the letters along with the letter names. My son (4) knows all his letters, but hasn't grasped phonics yet so these videos were definitely great for him, but would have appealed to younger children as well.",1457222400,,266,4.5625
7624058,5,B01B8MEXF6,"Bought this for my almost 5 year old son who learns very well through song.  He was having difficulty learning his letters in preschool and was not learning letters any other way. When we started he only knew 6 letters.  After a week of watching this every day and pointing out letters everywhere we go he now knows 15 letters.  The songs are very catchy and are easy to memorize which allows me to sing them with him throughout the day.

My 2.5 year old also likes to watch this and will sing the songs with us as well.",1456876800,,520,4.222222222222222
