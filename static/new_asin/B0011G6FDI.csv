3065539,1,B0011G6FDI,"Rob Zombie is now officially the master of horrible horror.

Like hack director Michael Bay, he no longer makes original movies. He just searches through the titles of great horror franchises of the past, grabs one and then ""reinvents"" the classic, knowing that it'll make a fast buck on its opening weekend, helped by internet hype, and sucking in the fanboys and horror buffs (like myself.)

At the rate he and Bay are going, they'll be forced to remake their own remakes--or, and this would be revolutionary--attempt to make an original thriller--something we haven't seen in many a moon. As it is, we've been deluged with hideous remakes (Asian horror, classic horror and sci-fi) and endless sequels and prequels.

H2 is filmed so darkly, against such turgid, slimy backdrops and interiors, you literally experience the sensation of watching a movie where the camera was placed in an unwashed toilet bowl. Wardrobes are so hideous, with all the females sporting frizzed and mangy hairstyles you can only cringe when they have sex.

Laurie, portrayed by the totally uncharismatic Scout Taylo-Compton, has almost zero dialogue, except for the F____ word that she spews out with gusto at regular intervals. The rest of the the time she shrieks, screams, blubbers, wails, keens, convulses without end. She looks like an animated corpse throughout with the worse hair (matted and strawlike) wardrobe (greasy looking ""punk"") and make-up (gray and sweaty)of any horror heroine in recent history.

There's no character to sympathize with. You've only got Zombie's usual gallery of deadbeats, skanky women and redneck morons.  Whenever one of the male idiots encounters the monster, they make the terminal mistake of ""messing with him."" His seven foot size doesn't appear to warn them of a lethal reaction.  After cursing at him or breaking something over his head, he comes after them. As the retards they are, they don't move away. They just stand there to be pulverized.

One of those who pays for his disrepect, has one line of dialogue that should result in an Academy Award for Best Script. As he lays all bloodied and dying, he mutters for five minutes:""F___, F___, F__, F___, F___, F___, etc.""
Maybe this is what dying neanderthals utter before they go to that big outhouse in the sky.

Whenever the hulking Michael Myers monster goes on the attack, he fast becomes a bore. He stabs and stabs until you're falling asleep. And you know that no tsunami of bullets or being run over by cars or blazing infernoes will keep him down.

Probably the most confusing device used by Zombie are the dream sequences. The movie begins with a ten minute long dream, Laurie awakens, and then she dreams again and again as the movie progresses.  We're also supposed to figure out the presence of the ghosts of Michael Myers mother and him as a boy.  Towards the end, Laurie goes into another endless convulsion of spasms. It goes on so long, like seeing someone learning how to perform the St. Vitus dance, that you are not surprised that she ends up in her favorite place: a hospital.

Before H2 was released last week, Rob Zombie announced he will start filming yet another horror/sci-fi classic: The Blob. Is everyone leaping into the air with wild applause and hysteria? Someone should whisper into his ear that after he ruins The Blob, there are yet other horror franchises he should consider remaking: Saw, Frankenstein< Dracula, The Wolfman, The Mummy, The Invisible Man--that is if Michael Bay doesn't grab them first.",1251590400,8,3513,4.943972835314091
3065540,2,B0011G6FDI,"I have never minced words to anybody who asks about my feelings whenever Rob Zombie's original ""Halloween"" is mentioned.

I actually liked his first film; I think he gave what many considered to be a struggling slasher franchise a much-needed and long-overdue shot in the arm.

With this one, however, I think he dropped the ball and it would seem I'm not the only fan who holds such sentiment. The opening minutes, which ironically pays strong tribute to Rick Rosenthal's ""Halloween"" sequel, are absolutely brilliant. Sheriff Brackett finds Laurie, caked in blood and shambling down the middle of a neighborhood street in petrified shock---one can assume only mere moments after shooting Michael squarely in the face. The next time we see her, she's having the many wounds she received at Michael's hands cleaned up and stitched at Haddonfield Memorial Hospital. Her friend, Annie, played once again by Danielle Harris, is convalescing in another room down the hall. All seems perfectly fine, as it should be. That is until Michael, upon awakening in a coroner's wagon, shows up....primed and ready to finish what he started. At this point early on in the movie, I was excited. All the memories of Rosenthal's ""Halloween 2"" came flooding back to me in virtual waves. It was only after what began as a heart-pounding chase from the hospital and into the pounding rain outside that Rob Zombie suddenly decided to shift gears and throw a major monkey wrench into the proceedings.

You see, after all this chaos, Laurie wakes up in bed safe and unharmed.

Yeah.

Those delicious, beautifully-crafted opening few scenes were nothing but a dream! And that is only the merest tip of where my disappointment in this movie stems. Zombie, who was given free reign to distance himself as far as he felt was needed from John Carpenter's universe of characters and story structure, took what could have been a truly effective follow-up to his own remake and steered it down a path most fans were not expecting and obviously did not appreciate. Apart from turning Michael into a Jason Voorhees clone with a Grizzly Adams beard, who in this film now seemingly bases his entire urge to kill around messed-up visions of his mother and a white horse, he has also committed the unthinkable blasphemy by transforming Malcolm McDowell's Dr. Loomis into a money-hungry media whore! Loomis has apparently written a tell-all book, documenting Michael's prior rampages at what can only be seen as the shrewd and unforgivable expense of his victims and their families. This, as any one who has followed this series will tell you, is NOT how Dr. Samuel Loomis represents himself.

But, still, that only encompasses everything I didn't like about this movie.

What I DID like deserves it's own seperate analysis here. I liked the therapy sessions Laurie participated in with her counselor; a surprising cameo by Margot Kidder, by the way. Those scenes, even if they did consist of some rather ceaseless and unnecessary profanity by Laurie, were honest and effective. Conversely, even though I outwardly despised what Zombie had done with the Loomis character, I was also quite taken by the manner in which Laurie discovers her genetic tie with Michael. She reads about it in the good doctor's newest book. That was, admittedly, a very emotional scene. Brad Dourif's second turn as Sheriff Brackett was another positive standout for me. His scenes helped in keeping my interest grounded, especially towards the end when he finally confronts Loomis in a mad rage over everything that's transpired.

This was, as Zombie admitted, a movie he made to close out the story he kick-started within his first film. Anyone else who has seen it will probably come away believing him.

I didn't hate the film, in general, I was just disappointed. Very disappointed. But I still went ahead and bought the DVD, based mostly on the few good things I felt the script had going for it; basically everything I liked, as outlined above.

That may not be the case for whoever else decides to give this a watch. As I always try to do when it comes to movies, I simply advise any fan reading this to rent the film for themselves and make up their own minds.",1251504000,,4207,4.887798036465638
3065541,3,B0011G6FDI,"Rob Zombie said he wouldn't do a sequel to his retelling of Halloween but here is the second and ""final"" chapter of his vision. I went into this with an open mind because I knew nothing could touch the original masterpiece.

We started off with the reason why Myer's is a killing machine. They could have put it in the middle of the film but we get it right off. The film starts off fine and Myers is more vicious then ever before and we get some brutal killings. Then we see something most people would probably hate but I really didn't let it bother me. Myer's inner child, who speaks for the silent killer, and his mother look on to his every move. Why? Seems like Myer's is on drugs thru out the film or just plain nuts. I think it's because Sherri Zombie has in every damn film her husband makes. Then we find it is was all a dream. The story is not very clear and is just one of the many weak points in the film. I suppose I'll say somethings I hated about the film before I end with postives

Sherri Zombie. Hey Rob, we all know your wife is a total babe. Does she really need to be in every damn film you make?

Every death scene shows Myers inner child and his mother. What the hell for? I like Myers a solo, cold, stalking killer.

The film is mostly black and it could be heard to see what is going on half the time.

Dr. Loomis is no longer your friendly doctor. No fame got to his head and he craves the media attention. I was shocked to see what happens to him at the end.

The ending. I shouldn't trust Zombie because he said he wouldnt make this sequel but here it is. I hated the ending and it spelled sequel, even though I have no idea where they could go with it.

Pros-

I like how they tried to show suspense in the beginning but that quickly faded.

The rock tracks were in the background and it seemed they actually tried a score instead. The original Halloween wouldn't be scary if not for Carpentar's amazing score.

Overall, I came into this expecting the worst and it really wasn't the worst film i've seen this summer. It's worth a watch even though some people will hate it and some people will love it. Hell, the theater I saw it at plays brand new movies on the weekends for three bucks, so I didn't get jipped. I enjoyed it but would have been cool to see Myers kill without mommy looking on.",1251504000,5,2324,4.155902004454343
3065542,3,B0011G6FDI,"first of all i think this halloween was ok.i was expecting a remake,which the first dream sequence gave us.instead this movie 'stories' seem confusing.and the ending was a twist.i must say it was entertaining.i know from rob zombie movies i was expecting gory killings/stabbings.michael's mom appears in dreams with a white horse and young michael.he's mom is the one motivating him to go after his sister.danielle harris reprises her role as annie,laurie's friend.this actress was michaels niece in part 4 and 5.dr.loomis is now banking in on the book he wrote about michael and laurie.this time he isn't helping in killing michael.there is some telepathic btween michael and laurie.at times she seems possesed.so for old fans of halloween 2 the original,u will not be expecting anything similarities.excluding the hospital scene ,which zombie tricked us .wait til the dvd comes out.",1251504000,2,884,5.321428571428571
3065543,1,B0011G6FDI,"(NOTE- this is the SECOND time I put this review!)

First off let me begin by saying I loved the first movie. While Zombie is no Carpenter, he managed to take an existing concept and show us how HE imagined it- Halloween 07 was not a remake, but a portrait of a killer we thought we knew. IT was disturbing, gritty, gory, real- I liked it a lot.

I was looking so forward to this. Halloween 07 was every bit as good as Halloween 78 and I loved seeing it in the theater. And I was HORRIFIED at how bad it was!!!!! I saw lots of potential in Zombie because of the sequel, and I thought it would be a great experience. Now I reconsider. Whereas H1 left me thinking ""That was good!"", this is the first time I walked out of a Zombie film thinking ""I enjoyed almost none of that."" Not to mention people were booing at the screening and I am not surprised.

I'll begin with what I did like- Malcolm McDowell is great as Loomis as usual, Compton and Sherri Moon are gorgeously hot, Bates' score was good. And that's about it.

The story screams ""fanfiction"" in the worst sense. I think even a 12 year old could do better than this garbage. How this film got made beats me. The gore was excessive and overdone. I love gore, but no, it was just way over the top. There was not a single moment where the characters were not annoying. What was with all the dream bits? That really distracted me. Also, the movie has a sloppily edited/rushed feel to it. I liked the first one a lot and couldn't wait for this one, but no, I may have to think long and hard before even thinking about going near the screening room for Halloween III. It really is that bad.",1251417600,8,1641,4.2
3065544,2,B0011G6FDI,"Everything that made Rob Zombie's ""Halloween"" such a great horror film is noticeably absent from ""Halloween II."" This is not a movie so much as a surrealistic freak show, a cruel, ugly-looking free-for-all that assaults the senses at every opportunity with lightning fast cuts, extreme close-ups, and grating music. Unlike what was released in 2007, ""Halloween II"" is not a remake of any film in the original ""Halloween"" series--it's a new story so strange, unpleasant, and inexplicable, it's as if Zombie wrote it completely off the cuff. What was he thinking? How could he let his vision go so horribly out of control? I can only hope that this isn't a sign of his success being a fluke, that ""Halloween II"" is merely a lapse of judgment from which he will soon recover.

It begins exactly where the first film ended, with Laurie Strode (Scout Taylor-Compton) savagely shooting Michael Myers (Tyler Mane) on Halloween night. An elaborate dream sequence follows, one that pays homage to Rick Rosenthal's 1981 version of the film by taking place in a hospital. As soon as Laurie wakes up screaming, we learn that a year has passed and that she's in therapy, and of course, she has the usual anxiety medications stashed in her medicine cabinet. She's now living with Sheriff Lee Brackett (Brad Dourif) and his daughter, Annie (Danielle Harris). No one knows the whereabouts of Michael, which is strange because witnesses do remember the county coroner putting his body into an ambulance. Needless to say, Michael is very much alive, living in the middle of nowhere while plotting his return to Haddonfield, Illinois.

He's after Laurie, of course. But why? The ads have given this plot point away, but if you've managed to avoid them, let it suffice to say that he feels a special connection with her. This ties into the weirdest subplot ever conceived of for a ""Halloween"" film, which involves visions of Michael's long since dead mother (Sheri Moon Zombie) walking next to a horse. She wears a flowing ghost-like dress and either walks down a brightly lit hallway or stands in front of brilliant white light. In one of the film's most bizarre scenes, Michael and his mother stand in front of a table where ghastly creatures (looking like rejects from ""Pan's Labyrinth"") seem to be reenacting Jesus' Last Supper. If there was any decent way to account for this ridiculous spectacle, I'd be the first to share it with you.

Meanwhile, Michael's former psychologist, Dr. Sam Loomis (Malcolm McDowell), is now promoting his new book about the Myers' family and the murders that took place a year ago. What a change twelve months can make; Loomis has de-evolved into an arrogant publicity hound, which is to say that the audience no longer has any reason to take him seriously. He's now nothing more than an opportunity for moments of comedy relief. What did Zombie hope to achieve by making Loomis a figure of fun? Given how deadly serious the rest of the film is, this seems incredibly out of place. When the foundation of the plot is a series of stabbings, spatters of blood, and a hell of a lot of screaming, a director can't believably pause to reveal that he also has a sense of humor. He has to show it all throughout in order for it to work.

The hideous visuals don't help matters much. Rather than eerie shadows that build tension, Zombie opts for muted tones that look dirty and disgusting, as if mud was smeared over the camera lens before shooting. There's no sense of tension with this kind of look; there's only a sense of filth and degradation. But this story isn't supposed to be one of exploitation. On the basis of ""Halloween,"" which was a skillful combination of suspense and primal fear, I would have thought that Zombie already understood this. Apparently he didn't, and that leads me to an unfortunate conclusion: ""Halloween II"" fails because Zombie created an original story. The 2007 film, on the other hand, wasn't a complete reinvention but more of an update on John Carpenter's original. Strange how a little creative restraint can paradoxically be so freeing.

Watching this movie is like witnessing a tragic fall from grace. Maybe that's to be expected, since sequels, especially in the horror genre, are notoriously inferior to the ones that started it all. Was there any way that ""Halloween II"" could have been better or just as good as ""Halloween""? Who can say? All I know is that this movie gets virtually nothing right, not the visuals, not the story, and definitely not the characters, who spew dialogue so foul and inane that they seem transplanted from another movie altogether. The whole thing is an unsightly mess with a nonsensical plot, a sideshow attraction that wants to pass itself off as a real horror film. I can't help but feel sorry for Zombie. ""Halloween II"" shows that he has lost his way as a director. Let us hope he will eventually get his bearings.",1251417600,7,4899,4.799763033175355
3065545,2,B0011G6FDI,"Let me start by saying ""Michael Meyers"" is the only horror film character that still gets to me and I was really excited about seeing this Rob Zombie remake.  I was thoroughly disappointed.  Zombie clearly has changed the story, and it seems to me the only reason for that is to have his wife in the movie.  Because of the way his remake of Part 1 last year ended, ""Michael Meyers"" mom, Zombie's wife, shows up in dream sequences and ghostly apparitions to tell the now grown ""Michael Meyers"" to kill people.  He also has turned Dr. Loomis into a greedy apathetic character.  As we know in the original series, Dr. Loomis seemed to alway show up and try to help others and stop ""Michael"".  Rob Zombie, as with most of his movies, made this remake extremely bloody and as weird as this sounds, extremely violent.  What I mean by that is when ""Michael"" kills people you can almost feel the anger in which he's doing it come across the screen.  You also can see the over-kill...no pun intended.  It's not a horrible film, although I didn't like it and if you're like me, someone who has set through all of the original series and last year's remake, you should go see this film but don't expect too much.",1251417600,4,1201,4.447488584474886
3065546,3,B0011G6FDI,"Rob Zombie's Halloween 2 isn't any better or worse than his last one. It's probably the least crazy of his four films and is more straight forward horror. The acting is about the same average quality this time around, though when Scout Taylor-Compton whines I can't stand the sound of her. You have to take these two Halloween films as something totally different than John Carpenter's 1978 masterpiece. If you want any kind of enjoyment while watching Rob's version, don't even try to compare them. The main thing I didn't like was seeing Michael Myers walking around without his mask on at times. He looks like a lumberjack, complete with a long beard and a mane of hair. He also makes silly grunting noises when he kills, even though he never made a peep the last time around. Quiet is scary when it comes to Michael Myers. I also hated how they made Dr. Loomis rude and unlikeable.

If you liked Rob Zombie's Halloween (2007) you will find much to enjoy here as well. If not, you would probably prefer to let Michael Myers stab you to death rather than sitting through somebody other than Carpenter's vision of an iconic killer.",1251417600,2,1132,4.6318407960199
3065547,5,B0011G6FDI,I thought it was very original and differnt from all teh other Halloween movies. It gave teh series a completely different look and hopefully teh studio allows michael to finally be dead.

I understand why it was necessary to replace him. Just a shame they didn't do the sequel right away instead of waiting so long that the kid got so much bigger.

3065713,2,B0011G6FDI,"[Moderate Spoilers] Let me get this straight:  In 2007, director Rob Zombie attempted to revive the original, successful ""Halloween"" movie series by creator John Carpenter that, while financially profitable, failed to meet hardcore purists' expectations, so Zombie makes a 2009 sequel to officially begin a whole new reboot of the movie series?  Zombie should've left well enough alone in the first place, though I suppose it's understandable that he decided on a sequel since 2007's version made a solid, nearly 60 million at the box office (this 2009 sequel, however, made just over half of that).  Scout Taylor-Compton (from the 2007 version, who reminds me of Julianne Hough of the ""Footloose"" remake), returns as ""Laurie Strode,"" and admittedly this 2009 version starts out great (the ambulance and hospital scenes) while it is actually more or less paralleling 1981's ""Halloween II"" very effectively and impressively so (though the original was no masterpiece).  But then the wheels fall off, with an abundance of blood, mayhem, and screams from Taylor-Compton but no real shocks or dark humor (and the white-horse scenes definitely seemed out of place).  The ending was actually unintentionally comical.  Interestingly, however, there are small parts by Margot Kidder (the original ""Superman"" movies) as a shrink, Octavia Spencer (future Best Supporting Actress winner for ""The Help"") as a nurse, and Meagan Fay as a cop at the very end (once Roseanne's snobby neighbor on TV's ""Roseanne's, but blink and you'll miss her).  Danielle Harris (who starred in a couple of the original ""Halloween"" movie series' sequels and in the first ""Halloween"" remake of this whole new movie series, which is confusing, I know) has a moderate role as well (and also had a recurring neighbor role on TV's ""Roseanne"").  Otherwise, this 2009 version, although the effort is apparent, injects little adrenaline into the original film series.  Some may argue that this newer movie series is also hurting Carpenter's reputation; therefore, although Zombie's reboot is acceptable, I hope it all ends here.",1477094400,,2088,5.303030303030303

This was choppier than his previous Halloween, but it was still interesting to watch.  There were also ridiculous moments such as an endless flashback between Michael Myers and his mother's ghost on a white horse, which was pointless except to keep the directors wife in the movie.  Laurie Strode doesn't stop screaming throughout the movie I was annoyed more than anything else.  It was way too over the top.  The actress was most definitely no Jamie Lee Curtis.  There was a whole sequence of her escape from the hospital that went on forever and then abruptly turns out to be a dream.  I know this is its own movie, but this movie wouldn't have existed if it weren't for John Carpenters original Halloween.

I like the idea behind the visions Michael experiences throughout the movie with his deceased mother, and a younger version of himself with a white horse, but in all honesty while understanding can take one far in life it fails to do anything other then making you realize that the visions are redundant. Yes it's a good concept trying to bring Michaels madness into a somewhat visible perspective, but you don't, and shouldn't understand it Michael is the shape he had plenty back story in rob zombies first remake we didn't need to expand upon that in the sequel. They didn't show good judgment either during the production of this movie they had so many issues with whole reels of film getting destroyed, and having to redo all that work again, but it would have been understandable if they changed the release date to another time instead of rushing to finish it I understand they wanted to get a finished product out to the public sooner rather then later, but it only hurt them in the end financially not waiting as should have been the case. 3 stars is a fair rating scout-taylor Compton did a phenomenal job portraying Laurie strode specially the therapist scenes, and the hospital scene at the beginning was nicely done, but much of this movie could have been edited out and redone a different way. I can understand what they were hoping to achieve, but they destroyed a good franchise needless to say it was already going downhill since The curse of Michael myers was released, but instead of saving the franchise they killed any hope of a remake part 3 the hospital scene should have been extended, and I enjoyed all the scenes with scout in them cause despite contradiction to this statement she did do a phenomenal job as I've said above. They shouldn't have changed doctor Loomis character he has always been the heroic psychologist, and while again I understand what they were going for, and he did change in the end it just didn't work. I'm a supporter of new ideas, and bringing innovation to old ideas, but sometimes it's best to leave a good thing alone don't fix something that isn't broken. It's a movie worth watching, but not repeatedly others may disagree, but I believe a truly good movie can be even constantly rewatched rewatchability is the difference between a great movie, and a horrible mistake.",1464912000,2,2410,4.699763593380615

More bloody than the original, the victims are mostly sexy and one of them is photographed very well indeed.

3065877,5,B0011G6FDI,"This is my favorite Halloween movie.

Unlike most people, I really enjoyed Rob Zombie's Halloween II, and it's my favorite movie in the series.  To start off with negatives, I dislike Dr. Loomis in this one.  I get that he would try to make money off of Michael's attacks, but he comes off as really rude until the end of the movie.  I also dislike Annie getting killed.  A bad end to a great character.  I also didn't like the ending to the Unrated version where Laurie dies.  I much more prefer the Theatrical cut where the pace is a little quicker, and Laurie lives.  She is my favorite character in the remake series.  I do like the Unrated version, I just prefer to watch the Theatrical version.

The good things about the movie, I like seeing how everyone changed because of the attacks.  Laurie has become a psychological mess, Annie has matured a lot, and Sheriff Brackett has become more caring towards Annie and Laurie.  I think Scout Taylor-Compton is a better actress as Laurie because not only do I strongly dislike Halloween H20: Twenty Years Later and Halloween:Resurrection, but since I'm a teenager now, she and her friends seem more relatable and more like the teens in my generation.  She also plays Laurie well in this one because seeing how she was a really friendly and nice person in the first one, and seeing how Michael has messed her life up makes her more sympathetic.  I don't mind Michael's look in this one because really what does he do for the rest of the year when it's not Halloween?  He's not going to wear the mask 24/7, because the latex will rot further.  It gets torn at one point in the movie and by the end of the movie, it looks like it could fall apart.  I don't mind the ""Hobo Michael"" look.  Seeing his mom with the ""White Horse"" concept doesn't bother me because it is his perception of her and not actually her spirit talking to him.  Dr. Loomis is my favorite character in the original movies, and Laurie is my favorite character in the remakes.  Annie has become more mature in this one and takes care of Laurie.  Sheriff Brackett is also likable, he is a beaten down father taking care of Laurie and Annie.

There are many other things I love about this movie.  Seeing the psychological effects on the characters is interesting.  I can imagine Laurie turning out like she did after what happened with in the last movie.  The hospital sequence which turned out to be a dream was well done and suspenseful.  I initially didn't like Michael grunting when he kills people, but now I don't mind it.  In the hospital scene, it makes sense becuase it's Laurie's dream, so she's going to have an exaggerated view on Michael's attacks.  Michael's kills were even more brutal than the last movie.  Annie's death is the most depressing movie death I have seen ever.  The music playing while Laurie holds her as she's dying was really sad.  Then Sheriff Brackett comes and breaks down.  Rob Zombie did a good job making you feel emotion in that scene.  Laurie's friend Mya's death was also kind of sad when she was brutally killed.  Dr. Loomis' death in the Theatrical version involves Michael hacking him 6 times and stabbing him 12 more times.  The party scene with Laurie and her friends was well done and entertaining.

The Theatrical version, which I am reviewing, is my favorite of the two versions because Laurie seems to try to get her life together, and the ending is much better, because in the Unrated version, Laurie is shot and dies.  Her dying vision is of her in an asylum as her real mother walks to her while ""Love Hurts"" plays.  Depressing, but I like the Theatrical version's ending, where she kills Michael and lives, then the scene transitions to the same scene in the asylum while ""Laurie's Theme"" plays, making the ending more sinister and creepy, and setting up for what could have been an interesting follow-up for a Halloween III.

This is, in my opinion, the most underrated Halloween movie.  Everyone is allowed their own opinion, and in my opinion, this is my favorite Halloween movie.  It's not like every other Halloween movie, Rob Zombie recreates the characters and makes them his own further than his first movie.  It's gruesome, emotional, gritty, and when Michael kills, you feel the victim's pain.  I love pretty much everything about this movie.  When I want to watch a Halloween movie, I usually watch Rob Zombie's Halloween and Halloween II.  A lot of people hate it because they consider it a remake of the original Halloween II from 1981, but it is not a remake, it is a sequel to Rob Zombie's remake/re-imagining.  I love this movie and I watch it often, and I enjoy it every time, no matter what others think.",1451606400,5,4691,4.597590361445783

3065903,1,B0011G6FDI,Let me start off and admit I an sick of horror remakes. But when I see a good one I will admit it's good. This one? The second just really makes me wonder if Rob Zombie truly is a fan of the movie or he just wanted to make it his vanity project. Scout is a horrible actress. And Zombie made Laurie someone you want to see die in a horror movie. At least for me. Plus this and the first really ruined the mystique of Michael Myers. Buy so did Halloween 6.

Weak ending and Michael Myers grunting all the time really distracted from taking this seriously. Whoever suggested that Michael should ever make sound should have been shot down. Very frustrating compared to how good the 1st remake was. Skip this and only watch the 1st one. So annoying. Tyler Mane was awesome in both except for the grunting in this one. Macolm's character in this 2nd movie was irritating and not realistic with his choice to exploit the story. So frustrating! Also the originl child actor who played Michael at an early age was great! He isn't in this one and that kinda sucked. Yes he grew older probably but still sucked.,1444521600,,760,4.595588235294118

I won't write a full review here but I will say Rob Zombie has done his homework when it comes to film making. In fact this film is so far and away from any of his other outings as a film maker it makes me wonder if he didn't have some uncredited assistance with the making of this. The cinematography, the story line(writing and character development), camera angles, the music...etc...I could go on but I'll end by saying ""Yes, this film is well worth the watch and worth studying if you're thinking about getting into film making.""",1437523200,,619,4.43859649122807

3065965,2,B0011G6FDI,"When Rob Zombie first tried his hand with remaking the original Halloween back in 2007, he did an awesome job. Unfortunately, success tends to make some filmmakers want to rush to get another film made and onscreen a little too quick. As they did after Halloween 4, even Moustapha Akkad himself admitted, we hurried after the success of Halloween 4 to get Halloween 5 made, and they did a bad job. Ironically i would gladly take Halloween 5, over this film. Now when Halloween II first got to theaters, a friend of mine and I rushed to a midnight showing with anxious anticipation. Just about an hour and a half later, we were stunned, we could not figure out what we had just seen. The first 10 to 15 minutes of the movie was great, the hospital chase with Laurie and Michael reminded us so much of Rick Rosenthal's 1981 Halloween II, that we were excited. The overuse of the phrase White Horse, and the actual overusing of a white horse was so disappointing, They could have done a lot better, Allowing Michael to walk Haddonfield with a cruddy hoodie with long hair and scrubby beard, made me think Zombie was trying to mirror image michael to look like himself. Really disappointing film, definitely ranks at the bottom of all of the other films. If you want to see the real Halloween II, the 1981 film is the only version to see.",1434585600,,1334,4.516528925619835

3065990,3,B0011G6FDI,"isn't watching a movie supposed to be fun? I say even a scary movie is supposed to be fun. Alien, the shining, the original halloween, the thing. those are movies I grew up with and they are scary but to me a lot of fun and perhaps they've spoiled me for modern horror movies as Ive rarely liked anything released in the last 25 or so years.

 you almost have to be a fan of the Halloween series to give its' most recent sequels a look. I am very much a fan of the first 3 Halloween movies but the reputation this series earned with the last 6 entries is making me wonder how far the series can fall. i want so badly for this series to turn around but it just doesn't happen with this one. it's not that this movie doesn't have some moments. as another reviewer mentions, the first 25 minutes or so is about as good as anything in the series, so how can the remaining hour and twenty minutes be so abysmal?

 the monster is the reason you watch a monster movie, but ive always thought the audience should be able to relate to some of the characters who fill the rest of this story. this would add to the tension and suspense and make me want to run from Michael just as much as the victims in the story. here the other characters are unlikeable to the point that you're cheering the villain.

 a rob zombie movie must have all his trademarks included even if it means taking a movie that works better with a focus on suspense and what is hiding in the shadows and instead giving explicit graphic violence for the sake of shock value. whats presented here is unsettling but not as effective nor as much fun for the audience as a simple camera cut as soon as you know the monster has struck. I get that rob zombie wants to make the story truly horrible and depressing but if its not fun for the audience, why are we watching it?

 as I said, there are a few good moments in this one and if you are halloween fan you're going to see it anyway, the story is pretty unique but the same thing that makes it so unique... rob zombie and his excessiveness ... is just too much for me to enjoy this as a halloween movie and not just a rob zombie movie that happens to feature Michael myers. it doesn't need the excessiveness of explicit gore and 100 f words. it almost feels like a parody of the originals rather than a horror movie. :(

 all this being said the Blu-ray is excellent as it gives a director's cut of what I hear was an even worse theatrical cut. (how is that possible?) multiple special features which are pretty interesting. full length director's commentary. picture quality is incredibly sharp. does have some grain. audio is excellent. great Blu-ray for a bad movie.

 how about rob zombie writes the next halloween story as he did give us two very original stories but someone else directs or at least co-directs.",1429747200,2,2824,4.307547169811321

Micheal spends at least the first part of the movie no mask and just wandering around and seeing visions of his mother with a white horse. That was just so he could get his wife in the film again.

He makes you hate ALL of your favorite characters from the series. There are still a few likeable characters, namely the Bracketts, but they aren't the main focus of the story. That's a big deal for me.

As far as gore and horror, that is where this movie succeeds. The opening is amazing. It shifts in greatness after the opening (you'll see). Regardless, the movie carries it's gore through the end. This is undoubtedly the most violent Halloween movie yet. Usually those are the only things one needs in a horror movie, so at least it accomplishes that.

I love his movies and I will relish every movie he delivers. Appreciate the man and let yourself fall in love with the madness that oozes out of Rob's great mind. This is a review for Halloween II the unrated director's cut, but definitely watch the unrated director's cuts of part 1 and 2 before enjoying the theatrical cuts. I like Rob Zombie am proud to be weird and like Rob don't give a damn about the people who just want to hate against him. You are entitled to your opinion, but open your mind and let the madness creep in and you'll fall in love with the legend of the weird, my man Rob Zombie. Check out all the other great movies out there and buy the soundtracks to the movies. The Devil's Rejects had one of the most fantastic music intros that told the story as much as the characters. Get ready for the next great project from Rob called 3I. It is on fan backed on twitter,check it out and show some love.",1414540800,,1592,4.4

In the Director's Cut just about every scene has been adjusted in some way, with many new scenes added, and a completely different climax.  I really enjoy both versions of it though and had to own them both.  Unfortunately the Theatrical cut is only available on DVD and didn't come in the 15 Disc Anniversary Collection.  I'm not sure why so many people hate this movie.  Its got a good deal of blood & gore, nudity, and film making creativity and passion.  Its not bland and lacking vision like so many other movies coming out in the world today.  Michael continues his path of brutality that he began in Rob Zombie's first chapter and Mr. Zombie doesn't hold anything back this time around.

3066108,4,B0011G6FDI,"If theres one thing Halloween: The Complete Collection has done for fans, its let them conveniently re-live their favorite movie in the franchise at any given moment in the comfort of their own home. October is one of my favorite times of year because of a certain horror-themed holiday which gives me even more reason to go through the Halloween series as furiously as possible. I recently took in Rob Zombies Halloween II after only seeing it once when it was released in 2009.

Zombies 2007 remake / reboot / origin story of John Carpenters classic tale took the first half of the film to give us exhaustive information on Michael Myers past and his reasons for becoming the cold-blooded killer he turned into. The second part was a rather faithful re-tooling of the original 1978 classic.

His Halloween II does the exact same thing as the remake. It loosely takes the storyline from Rick Rosenthals 1981 follow-up to Carpenters masterpiece and runs with it for the first 30 or so minutes before heading in a completely different direction. In a nut shell, Michael Myers is viciously making his way back to Haddonfield to finish the business he started in the first chapter. This time hes being led by the specter of his dead mother riding a white horse while leading around a vision of his childhood self. It seems Judith Myers wants Michael to bring his sister Laurie home.

Tyler Mane portrays Michael Myers as a coherent demonic force with an unquenchable fury. When he wants someone dead, he sees the job through grunting and viciously thrusting his weapon to the bitter end. Carpenters Myers was more calm and passive in his approach. Although cut from the same cloth, these are two very different versions of the same character.

Where the original 1978 film and even its sequel were studies in gore minimalism, Rob Zombies Halloween II revels in its onscreen gruesomeness. From the graphic opening scenes of Laurie Strode being put back together on the operating table to each and every kill performed by Michael Myers, its an exercise in excess blood and guts. Just what audiences crave in their horror films now.

Taking in Halloween II for a second time has revealed its not quite as cerebral as I originally thought on first viewing. Dont misunderstand me. Theres way more thought put into the script here than a slasher film really demands, but at its core its still just a modern update of a good old-fashioned stalking killer flick. I still think there are points in the film where its insinuated someone else besides Michael is doing the butchering.

Halloween: The Complete Collection features the unrated Directors Cut of Rob Zombies Halloween II. Its 14 minutes longer than the version seen by audiences in the theater. The extended edition is made up of 94 altered scenes including 42 examples of alternative footage and 14 re-cuts. Whats strange is theres no extra violence or sexual situations among any of the unused and amended material.

While still a worthy entry into the Halloween franchise, Rob Zombies sequel isn't quite as fulfilling on a second watch. I remembered it being a whole lot smarter than it really is. It does deserve props for trying to take the slasher genre in a heavier psychological and abstract route. However, at the end of the day, its still just another entertaining episode in the legend of Michael Myers.

One of the absolute worst horror movies and since 2009 ive seen really horrible horror movies.

Yet this one STILL stands out as one of the absolute worst ones.

Unlike a lot of people I loved the remake of Halloween I found it brutal raw in your face twisted sick suspenseful and satisfying.

The sequel however? Nope none of the above.

The beginning I admit started out promising with the hospital scenario that I found quite refreshing considering the Halloween fans remember the sequel taking place in a hospital.

However you are immediately snapped out of this scenario when it is revealed ...

SPOILER ALERT!!!!! It is simply Lauries nightmare in her own head not actually happening.

That part already ticked me off considering it insulted the audiences intelligence and from then on the movie kept getting worse.

I felt it had some potential in the beginning with the hospital scenario but once I realized id been tricked and fooled that was all she wrote for me.

I managed too watch the entire movie online not in a theater no way would I have ever PAID for this travesty of a film.

I watched the unrated version I seriously doubt the theatrical version was any better and the reviews I read when this movie was originally released into theaters confirmed that fact for me.

The characters in the sequel were so useless and unnecessary I do not even know where too even begin.

Lets start with Dr Loomis Malcolm Mc Dowells character from the first movie in the first movie he was a compassionate caring man trying desperately too save a little boy from being completely lost too the darkness and evil that was slowly consuming him.

However in the sequel they made Dr Loomis instantly unlikeable which is an extremely stupid mistake considering Dr Loomis was always someone we cared about even if at times he seemed really unstable mentally.

Malcolms Dr Loomis was grating extremely annoying stupid moronic selfish arrogant and a total narcissist.

No idea what Zombie was smoking when he made the sequel but he literally forgot how he had established Loomis in the first movie .

Its like this Loomis is in a completely different movie and hes a complete stranger too the beloved Halloween fans.

In the end I hated the guy and was rooting for him too die and that's even more unspeakable too actually make us want a beloved character too DIE.

Lets then move on too Laurie Scout Taylor Compton was a royal pain in the butt as Laurie.

Yeah she whined a LOT in the original film and was kinda annoying yet at the same time I found her likeable and sweet.

I was also rooting for HER too die in the sequel Im no prude by any stretch of the imagination.

But she sounded like a complete imbecile saying f this and f that literally every single time she opened her mouth.

Her annoying histrionics were also borderline psychotic and made no sense whatsoever .

I swear Zombie was seriously smoking some good s!$% when he made this sequel he literally changed everything about all the characters in the sequel and forgot all about what they were actually like in the first one.

Then we have Lauries dispensable friends who are literally useless and serve no purpose whatsoever too this film.

Then we have a friend who miraculously and stupidly somehow survived a brutal slaughter in the first film.

She has facial scarrings and scars on her body but the character is very bitter hateful and just flat out hates Laurie.

I wholeheartedly am with her in that regard.

There are also some hilariously bad tender moments that come out of nowhere and are supposed too make us feel for the characters.

Nope the footage was hilarious though and did not fit at all.

In all honesty this movie was more of a comedy then a horror film .

Yes it had brutal violence but it was also repetitive boring and unoriginal violence unlike the first film when the violence was more graphic visceral and disturbing.

I just could not get into Michael stabbing someone over and over I was like yeah yeah you have a knife geez get creative already with how you dispatch your victims ffs.

Then there are the random out of nowhere victims who also make no sense and are truly some of the stupidest people ive seen in a horror movie.

I swear I was rooting for Michael and even he sucked in this film.

The mask looked cheap and gaudy he wasn't intimidating or scary like he was one in the first one.

Now let me get too the absolute worst aspect of this movie which is pretty much every part of this film too begin with.

But I digress ladies and gentlemen I give you a dead mother a white horse a horribly bad teen actor portraying Michael as a child and there in you have the travesty that is Halloween 2.

What was so hilarious especially about the kid actor was it was NOT the original actor who portrayed Michael as a child in the first movie.

The actress that played the mother I found her likeable and sweet and caring in the first film.

In the sequel however? She couldn't act for s#$! nor could the teen playing Michael nor could the harping screaming freak out Laurie either.

In closing Rob Zombie single handedly destroyed the franchise with this entry.

Thankfully though I treat this film as the imaginary nightmare that it is and only think of 1 2 4 5 6 7 and the remake as true Halloween movies.

This is one film that NEVER should have seen the light of day and I know there are a LOT of people who agree about that.

Too bad I cant give this film a negative 0.

Oh almost forgot one of my all time favorite horror actors Brad Dourif the voice of Chucky was so misused here it wasn't even funny.

He was only in a tiny portion of the entire film and wasn't even given much too do.

The ending was also one of the worst endings ive seen in years.

I admit initially I found the unrated ending somewhat satisfying the twist was okay with me but it still showed just how stupid and badly made the entire film was whether unrated or rated.

Finding something somewhat satisfying is by no means praise for this garbage dump of a film its like a comedian telling a joke only too receive polite applause or awkward silence in return.",1411689600,5,6195,4.507168458781362

3066143,1,B0011G6FDI,"I will say that I felt John Carpenter's original ""Halloween"" was a ""sacred cow"" when it came to horror films, and was irked that Rob Zombie was going to remake it....I had a strong bias against the film before I even walked into the theater. I watched Zombie's take on the Myers tale, and picked apart everything wrong with that first film and hated it. Flash forward a few years, and I grab it off the shelf at Blockbuster (remember those places?), gave it a second viewing...and found that I actually enjoyed Zombie's ""Halloween"". While I think it will always remain in the shadow of Carpenter's film, Zombie's remake was a lot of fun and much better than most of the sequels which followed the original.

I was excited to see where Zombie would go with part 2....

I should have known I was in trouble when the movie opens with a dream sequence! There's a flashback of young Michael being visited by him Mom, who gives him a horse toy, and then we see things pick up right where we left off with the survivors of Michael's rampage being taken to the hospital, Michael is revived and stalks Laurie through a hospital and we soon discover this is all a dream??? I guess Zombie wanted to pay homage to the original ""Halloween 2"" with a few hospital scenes. We soon learn that it's actually been a year since Michael's attack and that Laurie is now living with Annie and her family. No one has seen Michael since he disappeared the previous Halloween, and he is presumed dead. Of course Michael is still alive and dreaming about his dead Mom, his younger self and a white horse?? With Halloween right around the corner, Michael returns to Haddonfield to finish off his sister.

This movie is all over the place, the narrative can barely hang together, the scares are non-existent, and worst of all the film is just painfully dull. Even if you hated Zombie's take on the original film, you have to admit, it wasn't dull. This film just makes no sense, and it almost feels like stuff is just crammed in here because ""why not?"". I left any and all baggage at the door going into this film, I had no bias. Zombie's ""Halloween"" won me over, so I went into this one expecting a good time.

I thought the first Halloween re-make was decent.  And I really enjoyed Rob Zombie's other films like The Haunted World of El Superbeasto, House of 1000 Corpses, & Lords of salem.  But the Halloween II Re-Make lacked ALOT.
  I think Zombie made an admirable attempt in trying to create a new ""Vision"" with this film.  But in the end he just fell short.  I mean, there was no ""Revelation"" that the heroine was Myers sister like we did in the original, we knew it from the first one.  We get no supernatural scare like we did in the original either.  The Closest we come to it is Michael & His sister's ""Shared"" Hallucination of their mother.  There was to much blood.  And it lacked the scare the original Halloween II but it instead it traded brutality.
  What I did like about it was Malcom McDowel as Loomis.  It was nice to see Loomis with another type of personality than the one in the Original.  I also enjoyed the Soundtrack witch I think is Enjoyable.  There were a few laughs that I think were great given the context of the movie.

3066171,3,B0011G6FDI,"The film should have opened with:

WHITE HORSE - Since my wife's character .. I mean, ... a main character was killed off in the first film, I will quote some mumbo-jumbo excerpt from ""The Subconscious Psychosis of Dreams"" and have my wife .. I mean, a lead actress, portray an important character that influences another important character in this film. She will be dressed in white.. just because... and we'll throw in a white horse.. just because. She will continue to reappear throughout this film until all of the filmed footage is used.

-Excerpt from
My Journal .. I mean ...""The Subconscious Psychosis of blah-blah""

Moving on...
When this film was released back in 2009, it was butchered (no pun intended) by the critics and most of the audience. I, personally, do not care because I actually like it and prefer it over Zombie's original re-visioning of ""Halloween"". This sequel is brutal, unsettling, ghastly and it moves at a pretty brisk pace (well, at least one of the versions does... more on this later). Admittedly, I prefer the theatrical version but this unrated Director's cut offers some interesting additional footage and in my opinion, a very disappointing climax. Also note, that this version is not exactly scarier or bloodier; it is longer with revisions to timelines and characters. Most of the additional scenes deal with Laurie Strode's mental anguish. Also thrown in are a lot of unnecessary footage of Mikey and Rob Zombie's wife. For the horror nut, watch both versions and decide which one you like (or detest) more.

This grisly sequel opens with a brief flashback of a young Michael and his mother that introduces the ""White Horse"" theme- a reoccurring theme for the duration of the film. The film then cuts to a shocked and wounded Laurie Strode, who aimlessly walks through an empty street in Haddonfield, having survived a near fatal confrontation with Michael. She is taken to the hospital where the diabolical Michael follows and I guess you can guess what happens there. The rest of the film does not even remotely resemble 1981's ""Halloween II"". Zombie did not try to imitate it and despite a brief scene taking place in the hospital, the rest of the film goes to places the original did not. Laurie Strode, because of her past traumatic experience, is clearly messed up seeking the help of a therapist (played by an almost unrecognizable Lois Lane.. I mean, Margot Kidder) while Dr. Loomis, shamelessly tries to cash in on the tragedy of the Haddonfield massacre by writing a tell-all book which reveals the truth about Myers and his connection to Strode.

The tone of the film is much darker than Zombie's ""Halloween"" and the executions here are explicit. Whatever built up anger Michael possessed is unleashed here; I mean, talk about overkill. The man really has a bone to pick with these people. In some of the kill sequences, I honestly had to look away. The characters here are also very different than what we were used to seeing in the original film and its sequel. Here the characters are raw and emotionally, they are cut open; we see them in their entirety. This is where the unrated version may offer a bit more substance, at least to those who have the patience and are not annoyed by multiple scenes of a constantly whining leading lady. Although Strode is exposed as a disturbed, confrontational young woman and a far cry from the shy, good girl Laurie played by Jamie Lee Curtis in both versions, it is in the unrated version where we fully see her downward spiral and extremely abrasive demeanor. Taylor-Compton's Laurie is not as likeable but it is understandable why she is such a hot mess. Danielle Harris who plays her friend Annie, is a more vulnerable, likeable character but she too has a rough edge. Whenever she is on screen, we see the ravages of her previous encounter with Myers across her pretty face. She remains the most sympathetic character in this film. Brad Dourif who plays Sheriff Brackett is also great here and like Harris, is given a bit more depth. I am used to seeing Dourrif play outrageous psycho characters. Here, he is far more human.

The film is not without its flaws. Although I warmed up to the ""white horse"" theme, it may appear silly to some. Zombie does permeate the film's surroundings with his usual unappealing flair - lots of swearing, some pretty horrible dialogue, unsavory main/supporting characters. As stated, I prefer the theatrical release; it is edited better, omitting unnecessary or pointless scenes fixing its pacing issues. The murder sequences are no less explicit and the climax is far more satisfying. Here Zombie simply added too much of Strode's emotional turmoil. There are far too many scenes of her losing her mind; whatever pity we may have felt for her slowly diminishes and by the time she is finally reunited with Michael, we are wanting him to silence her whining once and for all. I also do not think it was a good idea in showing us Myer's much too human face clearly in several frames. It takes away from this monsters magic and mythology. It didn't work for me in the first film and it certainly doesn't work for me here. With all of that said, as a slasher movie, it delivers.

""Halloween II"" (2009) is not for everyone. Those who are not a fan of Rob Zombie need to stay away. The squeamish or those with faint hearts, I recommend you watch something not as visceral like Disney's ""Pinocchio"". This fable is a dark one; it is sick, twisted, and brutal to the core. As I already stated, I prefer the sequel over Zombie's original vision of the Halloween legend and I will forever remain unapologetic.

The picture quality is good as is the sound. The version comes with a lot of extras that should please the fans. If you prefer the theatrical version, I recommend the&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Rob-Zombie-s-Halloween-Halloween-2-Double-Feature-Blu-ray/dp/B0057GUHWI/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Rob Zombie's Halloween / Halloween 2 (Double Feature) [Blu-ray</a>] that includes both Zombie's 'Halloween' (2007) and 'Halloween II'.  There are no extras but the films look good and is very affordable. If you are a completist like me and enjoy these films despite their short-comings, get them all and pleasant Dreams.

Zombie could have called it something else and it would have been just as terrible. The entire town of Haddonfield somehow was moved from a cute little suburban neighborhood that you saw in the first movie, to a rural setting with abandoned farms and houses. Sheriff Bracket now has long hair and a scruffy beard and Laurie as well as everyone else in the movie are complete white trash. It's a shame because I typically love Zombie's movies, but this one was just bad. This movie also features the Yoko Ono of Zombie's movies...his wife.

3066196,5,B0011G6FDI,"Rob Zombie's Halloween 2 is a great horror film and I think it does the Halloween franchise justice. I thought Zombie made this film different and was very creative. The opening to this movie is great as it pays tribute to the original Halloween 2 by having Myers stalk Laurie in a hospital. It all is a dream though. In real life time has passed and it has left a lot of trauma and bad memories to Laurie as she is an emotional wreck still trying to heal and get over that traumatic experience and learning that Myers is her brother. I thought it was realistic for someone to be like this after undergoing the experience. Compton is not a very good actress and having the most difficult part to play didn't help her in this movie.

  The acting large in part in pretty solid. Malcom Mcdowell gives a great performance as Dr. Loomis. Loomis has turned into a greedy, selfish egotist who will do anything to make a buck off his experiences with Myers. He has another book to sell and shows to appear on. He could care less about Myers being still out there as he is clearly out for himself. I like Zombie changing the character to make Loomis not an honorable man as in the original films. It's a strong point of the film that separates it from the original Halloween 2.

  Brad Douriff gives the best performance in the film as Sheriff Brackett. He is the most likable character in the movie and represents the honorable man that Loomis isn't. Brackett takes care of Laurie as if she is his daughter which is nice. Douriff has a great chemistry with Danielle Harris who returns as Annie. The two seem like a good father and daughter. Harris gives a great supporting performance in the film. She is someone on Myers's target list but also a survivor. It's cool having Harris once again in a Halloween movie since she has been doing them since she was a kid. Once Donald Pleasance passed on and Jamie Lee Curtis moved on from the Franchise Harris has carried on the tradition.

  Sheri Moon Zombie does a good acting job in the film as a ghost. I always thought Sheri Moon is a underrated actress. She did a great job in the first Halloween. The whole white horse thing was interesting. I like that Rob wanted to bring something new to the table. Chase Wright Vanek takes over the role of young Michael Myers. I thought the previous actor was much better and it was too bad he got too old for the part. There are some nice horror legends appearing briefly in the film. Margot Kidder from horror movies such as Black Christmas and Amityvillve Horror appears as a doctor. Caroline Williams from Texas Chainsaw Massacre 2 appears as Loomis's publicist. She is some nice added comic relief.

  The movie is very violent. It's brutal to put it in one word. My father said it best Myers was not too happy with Mrs Spencer who won an oscar after this film but in this film she plays a nurse who gets stabbed twenty times or so. That sets the tone for the whole movie. It's unrelenting and takes no prisoners. I know when Myers speaks in the film people didn't like that but once again it's being different than the Carpenter version. I liked that and thought it added to the great climax of the film.

  This is a very brutal and dark serious horror movie for the most part. When Danielle Harris is killed brutally it is a major shock and you care about her character and when Douriff finds his daughter it's one of the more tragic scenes in the history of horror. Douriff played the scene beautifully and instantly as the viewer we are on his side to get revenge on Myers. It was very dark and sad Annie dies. I like the flashblacks and dreams Laurie has during the film. It's well directed by Zombie.

  In the end Loomis finally comes to the realization that his fame is over, he's been a huge ass and Myers is alive and he maybe the only one that can stop him. He comes to help Laurie who is being held hostage by Myers. I won't say anything more but the unrated director's cut is one of the best endings to a horror film and I've seen a lot of them. I recommend this movie to all horror movie fans and Halloween fans! Cheers and Enjoy!",1396569600,3,4131,4.370757180156658

3066201,3,B0011G6FDI,"I'll admit I enjoyed a lot of what I saw, but I have to drop this movie down quite a lot from it's predecessor. I said that movie had problems as a remake but was ok as a movie. Here it's got problems as a movie and as part of the series it wasn't good.

First, what I enjoyed, I enjoyed the dark tone and the newness of the storyline. Also many of the arguments are actually close to real life arguments we may experience during our lifetimes. The deaths were gruesome, the film got tense as it went on and there was a general sense of helplessness/negativity that I usually don't like, but felt was good in this movie.

Now for the problems, this really isn't Halloween II. This is PTSD for everyone involved in the first and Michael just happens to show up at the end of the movie. Loomis went back to talk but little action and seemed very different from the previous movie. Trying to feel for Laurie was almost impossible even though I think that was the point. Michael having visions doesn't make sense as he didn't seem to have them before. Even though it's the best acted scene of the movie, I hated one perticuler characters death (you can figure it out).

Finally neither ending was done well. SPOILER ALERT PEOPLE SO YOU MAY WANT TO STOP. In both endings it's obvious Laurie is not a threat and yet she gets shot anyway. Also in the alternate ending Michael talking was a bad move. Finally, it's appearent that the film wants to indicate the ""evil"" has passed onto Laurie but why kill her/put her in the white room? Maybe watching special features will explain that, I dunno.

As one of the previous reviewers pointed out the gore was way to distressing. I found it sickening and way to much.

The characters turned a new direction. The acting remains the same as the other 2007 Halloween movie - all characters incredibly boring. Laurie Strode was the most irritating character - F this and F that! Constantly screaming!

Then there's the worst part of the movie the dreams. The white horse and that annoying woman. I have nothing against the actress whom plays Michael's mum. I am sure she is a nice woman in real life. But to bring her back in this movie was a really desperate move to make. The character and the horse just made no sense to the movie.

I am glad that Rob is not making Halloween 3.

This movie and the 2007 Halloween movie is the worse out of the whole Halloween series. I thought Halloween Resurrection sucked but is much better compared to this crap and the 2007 Halloween movie.

Hey, it was really good. A bit too much focus on little mental Michael and not fully in sync with the original. (WARNING: Spoilers Ahead! Read on if you want to know the worst things about the film) But the second just went and said, ""Hey, let's make Michael not wear the mask through half of it and show his face too.

Note, I liked Rob Zombie's original remake.

But as for this,

Its amazing when a reimaging of a Horror classic, actually has to do just about everything to intentionally trainwreck itself.

Not only are the original characters totally trashed, the film actually attempts to be more of a want-to-be psychological drama than a scary movie. We spend more time learning about how Laure is a psychotic whackjob with PTSD/medication issues and how Dr. Loomis is a scumbug than we see anything to do with Michael Meyers. Within the context of the Halloween series Rob Zombie turns out to not only annihilate your love for the original characters, the sinister prescence of Michael Meyers, the fear, the music score, and everything that makes the original films good, but he literally flips all these elements around and trashes them to the fullest extent possible. He makes the original characters as miserable and unlikable as possible, Michael is turned into a emotionally barren man with a Freudian Electra complex (Yea, i'm not kidding here, they make a particular allusion to this) there is no scare factor, jumps or suspense whatsoever. Dream sequences of imagined Michael Meyers killings literally replace horror scenes. Even the original score is cut out and replaced with possibly the worst soundtrack available to the human ear. Of course there is some psychic connection that is also explored between Laurie and Michael but of course this plot line is unresolved and completely unexplained while managing to take up most of the time you spend between the previously mentioned smagorsbord of pseudo-horror garbage.

Not only did he reinvent the worst possible film in the Halloween franchise, he actually had to go out of his way to ruin Halloween as much as possible and insults the very core of this series.  I'd rather watch Season of the Witch and Manos The Hands of Fate because at least they didn't try. This did try, it tried to go out of its way to intentionally destroy all the elements of the Halloween franchise and did so with astounding vigor.",1384041600,3,2080,4.979827089337176

3066249,1,B0011G6FDI,"I took the plunge and watched one of the Rob Zombie Halloween remakes from recent years.  Talk about an over-the-top pile of trash.  This movie is just a gore fest with a hillbilly/redneck feel to it.  Rob Zombie has made Michael Myers so brutal and over the top.  He kills so brutally that I say to myself, ""OK, OK, OK - we get it - the person is dead already.  No need to go so far with it.""  Why did these Halloween movies need to be remade to begin with?  They didn't.  As Rob Zombie says on the 25 Years Of Terror DVD, ""Everyone I know will go see a horror movie sequel knowing it's a piece of crap.""  You said it, Rob.  I must say, though, that I give you credit for realizing that yes indeed people will go see a sequel knowing it's a piece of crap.  You know there's a target audience out there, so for that I give you credit.

This movie is a shining example of why I stick to watching the old horror movies of the past from the 1920s, '30s, '40s, '50s, '60s, '70s, and '80s.  Nothing will ever top the horror movies of decades past, the horror movies of the first nine decades of the twentieth century.

3066251,5,B0011G6FDI,"Spoilers: Not since Alien 3 have we been treated to a downbeat slice and dice story where the heroine degenerates deeply into hopelessness. In Alien 3, Ripley was able to commit self sacrifice at the end, but in Halloween II, Laurie is driven farther into madness by the memory of what happened to her two years earlier, as well as the sudden appearance of ""ghost"" visions of her birth mother and of Michael as a child without the chance to do anything about it or help others. Laurie is shredded, emotionally, throughout this film, and left with nothing but her final vision of her mother coming to her as she dies. The film is a mixture of intense violence, psychological distress, building anticipation, and questions of sanity connecting Michael and Laurie. We get the treatment of the hospital from the 1981 Halloween II, but this is just a dream to set up Laurie's trauma that plays out as she uncovers who she really is and what that means. Meanwhile, Dr. Loomis, rich and capitalizing on the deaths in Haddonfield two years prior, is forced to look at what his fame has done to others, and he must make the choice to stay out or do something. Surreal images juxtaposed against graphically violent ones make for an interesting and emotional viewing experience. Don't be fooled by those who claim there is no plot or nothing original. This Laurie Strode collapses into emotional problems years before Jamie Lee Curtis' character succumbed in Halloween: Resurrection (2002).

He grunts and yells while killing and ultimately just didn't feel like Michael Meyers we all know and love.

I cannot say this film is easy on the eyes, but for gore hounds looking for an efficient time killer for the holiday season, Rob Zombie's ""Halloween 2"" is a must-see, and a surprisingly thought-provoking bookend to what would normally branch out as another franchise---or at the very least, a trilogy...",1382400000,,855,5.070921985815603
3066269,5,B0011G6FDI,"This version of Rob Zombie's Halloween II is unrelenting.  The descent into madness by the lead character as a result of the events from the first movie ... is to me ... both believable, sad and gripping.  The actual horror and violence is gritty and visceral and unlike what you see in most modern slasher flicks.  The tone is dark and bleak.  But it matches the overall aspect of the character arcs.

Some might find the white horse / ghost mom imagery as an ill-fitting placement, but in the directors cut, it just seems to fit a bit better than in the theatrical release.  That said, maybe one or two less uses would have been ideal.  However it doesn't take me away from the movie events.

The portrayal of Michael Myers I'm sure will be up for debate, but to me it seems grounded in Zombie's vision for the character.  He is a force of nature ... and it's truly depicted in this film.  He is brutal, he is as much beast as he is man.  He is a product of both innate evil and the evil that distorted his upbringing.

The evolution of Laurie and Annie and the excellent Sheriff Bracket characters make this movie a truly excellent piece of film-making.  To me they are all believable ... and doomed.  The extra scenes in the Director's Cut go even further in fleshing out what their lives have become because of the traumas that have and are again unfolding around them.

My only two ""complaints"" would be the turn of Dr. Loomis from one movie to the next.  Unlike the three characters above, his turn to a greedy shill seemed a bit forced here.  I thought he was played better in the first film.  Here he seems almost like a cartoon character coming across a bit too goofy for this dark Zombie world.  The second ""complaint"" would be the ending ... For me, I just enjoyed the ending of the theatrical release ending better.  I liked the ambiguity of it and I think it left it a bit more open to interpretation.  Here there is a definitive close ... which as Zombie notes in the commentary was his intention.  I'm just not sure it's best given the ""descent into madness"" tale he was spinning.

Overall, an excellent film that in enhanced by it's new material.  Commentary from Zombie is definitely interesting as well and helps to frame his mindset for these characters.  It wouldn't surprise me if this movie moved away from it's stigma as a failure and into the world of a cult classic as time goes on.",1381881600,,2408,4.430523917995444
3066270,4,B0011G6FDI,"First I need to mention that I admire this film for its change from the original, zombie made it a different kind of story. Second, I feel bad for those who bought the unrated version, the only one I saw in store, because its a completely different film and story. The theatrical cut is the one that is the best, but I don't see why zombie didn't release both. I guess he didn't like the changes in the theatrical because they were to please the fans. Anyway watch the theatrical edition! You'll probably like it....Laurie isn't a complete jerk in this version lol",1381795200,,564,4.485436893203883
3066271,4,B0011G6FDI,"I am not a Rob Zombie fanboy.  I say this because I see a lot of reviews dismissed by fans of the original.  I get where all the hate comes from.  Rob's vision of Michael Myers is drastically different than Mr. carpenters and is inferior.  Then again, of all the rip offs that have come since the original, none have surpassed it.  What this film and the original remake try to do is deconstruct the original films.  They start from the sibling angle that Carpenter hated from the original Halloween II, and has crafted the idea of the deplorable American family that deals with its problems through repressed sexual angst and violence.  I was iffy on the first film, though I did like many of the scenes from it, but absolutely hated this version when I saw it in theaters.  It was the worst movie I had ever seen in theaters and I nearly walked out.  It was incoherent and silly.  The point is that these films are not trying to be the original.  That film already exists.  There is no way to improve upon it, so he is doing something unique and different.  No matter what you think about these films, you have to give him credit that there is something very unique to what he is doing and saying on film.

I still maintain that stance towards the theatrical version.  I bought the director's cut because I am a completionist that loves Halloween and owns ever version of every film in the series.  After watching it and loving it, I bought the theatrical version to see if I was just out of it in the theater that night, and it really is a night and day difference.  Unlike the first remake, where the director commentary is identical between the theatrical and director's cut, except for additional commentary on the additional or changed scenes in the director's cut, there is a whole new explanation and thought that goes into this director's cut.  Maybe Mr. Zombie was expecting a Halloween release and was forced to finish the film early, because he says that he really was struggling to get something coherent out.  He failed, but when given the time to go in and fix the film, his vision really does stand out.

Even with a complete vision, it is still very decisive amongst fans.  Where the first film was very much so this frantic mess of cutting and movement that seemed to focus on people that are suffering, this film is much slower and really focusing on the wounds.  I know that doesn't sound like a very big jump in concept, but it really is. The frantic pace is slowed down to show the damage that is being caused by the killer both literally and psychologically.  When we are hurt by the unimaginable, that thing almost always wins because even if we survive, we still kind of are left in the wake of that tragedy.

Another interesting dynamic that plays in the film is that it was shot in rural Georgia.  There is a drastic change of pace and mood compared to the first film, despite supposedly happening in the same imaginary town.  You really can get a sense of city vs. country and how we view violence and how we take it.  In the first film, the violence is cut away from most of the time, almost like a squeamish city slicker, where here we see some of the hardest to take prosthetics I have ever seen in film.

I know a lot of people don't get the white horse, and maybe it really is just a throw away, but I think it speaks to the idea that we are all trying to get back to this pure place in our minds that really is our childhood.  While the Carpenter film was trying to make us afraid of the unknown, Zombie wants us to face what we can understand and wants us to look hard at ourselves.  I think of all the nostalgia for a time gone by after 9/11.  We become cynical and impulsive and we break down.",1378512000,3,3731,4.363768115942029

Then a bullet train derails and smashes into the side of the building and ruptures the gas line causing a massive explosion sending meat and chunks flying everywhere......yes, we would call that a disaster and that is what Halloween 2 is a G-D DISASTER......WOW!

Also a insane amount of cussing (I usually have not problems but seriously over 50 F bombs)which feels as if the actors are using strong words to convey emotions that they aren't capable of acting out.

3066297,3,B0011G6FDI,"*WARNING: This Review Contains Spoilers*

If I'm being completely honest, I was very surprised when it was announced that there would be a sequel to Rob Zombie's ""Halloween"". From what I read at the time, Rob Zombie wanted to make ""Halloween 2"" entirely his own & not go based off of John Carpenter's ""Halloween 2"" & from what I saw in the film, he accomplished that.
The Movie: I'd written a review for Rob Zombie's ""Halloween"" & said it was dark, gory & there was profanity, much like his other movies, but his version of ""Halloween 2"" is 10x worse than his reimagining of ""Halloween"". This takes place immediately after Laurie Strode ""kills"" her brother, Michael Myers, we see her in the hospital suffering from pretty substantial injuries & she goes into surgery. Nothing is left to the imagination, we're shown broken bones, open wounds, blood, stitches & it's all graphically shown. Skip ahead a couple of years & Laurie is a completely different person, she's depressed, has tattoos, has dreadlocked hair, she's very much a changed person from when we first met her in ""Halloween"". However, who wouldn't change drastically if they found out their brother was a serial killer who killed your entire family? Another character who has changed is Danielle Harris' character, Annie, she's become a positive, vegan, recluse, which is again the polar opposite of her character in the 2007 version. I personally wasn't a fan of Laurie's new friends in this movie, unfortunately, like in the 2007 version, I found them to be rather irritating when they hung out together, but hey, that's just my opinion. The ending was a disappointment to me, the final scene with Anthony Perkins in Alfred Hitchcock's ""Psycho"" only it wasn't unique & haunting.

The BluRay: It works very well, no issues with the disc. I believe there are some pretty good special features with this, I haven't watched the movie in a couple of years, but if I remember correctly a fan of the film would enjoy the included features.

Overall: I don't want to sound like I absolutely hate this film, because I don't hate it, it's OK, it's just not as good as other horror movies out there. It's your typical Rob Zombie film.",1370476800,2,2188,4.798408488063661

3066302,4,B0011G6FDI,"Where Zombie's HALLOWEEN was a true re-imagining of a horror classic, HALLOWEEN II is a very original chapter in the Michael Myers' legacy.

Picking up exactly where the first one left off, we see Laurie Strode walking along the road after shooting Michael Myers in the face. She is soon picked up by the sheriff and taken to the hospital. After a short incident with the morgue truck carrying Michael's body hitting a cow, Michael comes alive and begins his journey to finish what he started. Two years pass by but the nightmare remains for Laurie who is now on medication and seeing a therapist to deal with her night terrors and feelings about that fateful Halloween night. Rob Zombie presents to us a very disturbed and broken Laurie, a much different character than we've seen before. Her cheeriness and vibrancy for life has almost vanished and what remains is a woman on the edge of a nervous breakdown. Now living with her friend Annie and her sheriff father, Laurie tries to get back into normality but any hope of that soon comes crashing down when she reads Dr. Loomis' new book revealing her bloodline to the Myers' family. And of course Michael's re-return to town.

I think Rob Zombie has created something to be very proud of. Besides the initial beginning and the fact that it's called HALLOWEEN II, I wouldn't exactly consider this film a remake of the original sequel. Instead this newest instalment to the franchise is a fresh look at the aftermath of Michael Myers' horrific murder spree. The film includes quite a lot of realism with the inclusion of the scars left on Laurie and Annie's bodies as well as Sam Loomis' decent into a media hungry ego maniac who cares more for the fame than the misfortune. I consider this film to be the stronger of the two and admire Rob for making this his own and not just another remake.",1367366400,3,1844,4.636085626911315

3066339,3,B0011G6FDI,"Rob Zombie's first installment of Halloween can ostensibly be called a remake.  Although it did depart a lot from the original film it did essentially tell the same story.  Just with twists.  This one is just a direct sequel to that film, and while it does pay homage to the original version of Halloween II for the first 15 to 20 mins, after that it is its own movie and story.  It has much more of the strangeness and over the top gore that Rob Zombie's other horror movies have.  Loomis is turned into a raging prick who is just out to make a buck, and Laurie is definitely screwed up from her experiences.

That part of the story I did find interesting.  It is the part of the original Laurie Strode story line we did not see.  How did she cope as a teenager after the events of that night.  If it were just her messed up life and Michael coming back I think the film would have been better.  But the whole channeling the dead mother angle and Laurie can sometimes feel Michael (like when he is eating the dog) was just stupid.  Also having Michael yell die when killing Loomis should not have happened.

It is definitely a dark and twisted sequel.  Many devoted fans of the original two movies will probably hate this one.  Also people who would otherwise give it a chance if it were a remake of the second film will not like it either.  For everyone else there will probably still be a lot of disagreement.  Some will love it, others will hate it.  I am pretty lukewarm to it.  For what it is, if you can divest it from following the Halloween story verbatim, it is not horrible.  It is certainly better than Halloween 6 and Halloween Resurrection, but it is nowhere near as good as the original two films or even as good as Zombie's remake of the first movie.",1362787200,2,1766,4.313069908814589

3066345,2,B0011G6FDI,"There is really not a lot of good things to say here as the original Halloween 2 is one of the greatest sequels ever in film history. This film seems to count itself as a sequel to Rob Zombie's remake, while still taking cues from the original 1981 sequel directed by Rick Rosenthal. This film certainly plays much more to Rob Zombie's sensibilities than the first one did. While the first outing was entertaining and original, it was just too damn off the mark. This film got even weirder.

Folks seem to either love or hate the Rob Zombie Halloween films. I don't hate them, but I certainly don't love them. Both are flawed and, again, while the first one was decent, this film was just a mess. More of a departure of what the Laurie Strode character is to represent and a greedy, self serving Dr. Loomis make this film a joke.

Yes, there are similar elements and plot points from earlier Halloween films, including the original Part II (the hospital and the sister angle, which we knew from the first Zombie installment). But this is not a remake of the original Part II.

The movie overall is just an absolute mess that 3/4 of the way in loses plot and is extremely violent, vulgar and brutal... It's not a nod to old school horror as that had little vulgarity and violence that was often subtle and was more about mild violence and heavy suspense.",1356825600,3,1353,4.491869918699187

3066377,2,B0011G6FDI,"I have been a horror fan all my life and Micheal Myers was always my favorite modern movie baddy. It boggles my mind to think of all the great things Zombie could have done with this.

What I was looking for was some kind of an explanation for WHY Micheal Myers is the way he is. I don't mean the insanity part.. that's easy. That has been done over and over again in hundreds of movies. I mean the thing that makes Myers different from just a regular murdering psycho: his ""powers"". How did he get so big and strong if he spent his entire youth sitting in a room making masks?  How did he learn to fight, hide, stalk, and operate machines? Instinct? pffft.. Why is he so indestructible? How can he survive being burned alive, shot over and over, stabbed innumerable times, taking horrendous falls, and getting run over by cars? Why does he have superhuman strength?

 Both the Carpenter and Zombie versions depicted him as being this way, but only the Carpenter version eventually seemed to sort of sneak up on the possibility of a reason with the ""Thorne"" deal. But then that wall was thoroughly dropped, and hasn't been picked up again since.

Evidently Rob Zombie believes that just being psycho somehow grants one superhuman powers, but it doesn't.
So to break  it all down: Pinhead and Freddie are demons. Norman Bates, Leatherface, and Hannibal Lechter are crazies, Jason and The Crow are undead super-zombies and Micheal Myers is..... what?

Rob Zombie had the chance to go there, and I think he should have taken it. It was unexplored territory, plain as day. But instead he squandered it all on making the franchise ""his"".

So anyway if you saw the first one and actually liked it, then you might get something out of this one. I didn't like either one and I look at it as an opportunity missed.",1355875200,6,1805,4.56656346749226

The original Halloween 2 has people you might care about, might want to not see killed, but this version portrays everyone as such pathetic scum that death is a release from their tortured exsistence.

so, halloween 2, as directed by rob zombie:

honestly, i loathed rob's first halloween. i thought it was boring, needlessly violent, and a generally uneven attempt to pay homage to carpenter's, while adding his own, new material. but i love rob's other flicks and his music, so i gave halloween 2 a whirl and loved it. i couldn't stop thinking about it. it unsettled me, it excited me, it made me wonder why i like horror movies in the first place.

from the opening scene of laurie wandering bloody through the streets, i was hooked. her hospital scenes are excruciating. as we bleed into her normal routine later on, her emotional distress felt very real and believable to me. i enjoyed seeing the family that she, annie and the sheriff forged from tragedy and horror. i found her visitations to margot kidder to be illuminating and interesting.

watching michael drift across the country side reminds me of shelley's frankenstein's monster. like the monster, michael is attempting to find himself, figure out his purpose, and act on it. to do this, reuniting his family seems the best option, and he acts on it. i also found many of these scenes beautiful, wonderfully, sumptuously shot. the night shots were especially effective, shrouded in dark blue, but clear and discernible.

loomis' character in halloween 2 seems to generate the most criticism of anything, so attached to donald pleasance's brilliant portrayal of sam loomis most people seem to be, but i like this about the movie. the characters are carpenter's in name and position only; in terms of behavior and personality, they are all zombie's. this doesn't bother me, as i knew i wasn't seeing carpenter's movie (or rick rosenthal's, in the instance of the original halloween 2). i like the friction it creates in my brain to see characters i have long thought of in one way, presented in a different, oppositional light. i mean, why not explore all possibilities. genre fiction has long explored the doppelganger; everything, star trek, superman, bewitched, stephen king, whatever, has explored the notion of a dark half. is sam loomis so sacred? and in the end, he realizes his mistake--his self-absorption and aggrandizement--and does what he can to make things right.

i love the vibe of this movie. rob gets a lot of grief for his ""white-trash"" sensibilities, but i like it. i like captain clegg. i like all the supporting characters that show up. i like the country-fried feel of this movie.

the savage nature of the violence deeply affected me. on the one hand, it was horrifying and forceful, on the other, gratifying to see the anarchistic way that rob views human life. i find this chilling. i also thought annie's death, though horrible and raw, was thoughtful and beautiful. all the friction between her and laurie made her death matter when it happened. it was deeply moving, and showed me that rob can maintain a gentle hand, even when depicting horrible violence.

additionally, the make-ups, by wayne toth, also deserve props. the opening scenes, especially of laurie's hand, i found to be very convincing. i also love the set design. each space, each room, is gloriously trashy. halloween 2 is totally punk rock.

and while it may have been a tad obvious and seemingly out of step thematically with the rest of the movie, i think the whole white horse stuff added a nice touch of fantasy to the movie. who says you can't dramatically juxtapose images? frankly, i find it rather daring of rob, and it was a much more effective and interesting exploration of inner michael than the first films dysfunctional-by-the-numbers family portrait. and look, honestly, the white horse connected this movie to two other movies i adore--blade runner and (to a lesser degree) legend.

halloween 2 is about family, ultimately, about michael's attempts to make sense of his life and reconstruct his family (albeit with a knife) the only way he knows how. similarly, michael's actions in the first movie have forced laurie, annie, and the sheriff to forge a necessary family out of each other. family drives this movie, which is all the more awesome, considering what a brutal, rockabilly good time it is.

it seems that rob can't win: try to take halloween and its' characters in his own direction--while, i might add, paying homage to a variety of movies throughout horror's illustrious and varied history--and he just gets crucified. i mean, we bitch (well, not me, i don't mind them) about remakes and sequels and lack of originality, and someone comes along and takes an established character, who, c'mon, only really had one classic movie to his resume, arguably two that were decent (not saying i don't like more than that, just, you know, objectively), and moves the character off in a different direction, different vibe, and he gets taken apart, like he's never made any meaningful contributions to the genre.

halloween 2 is refreshingly original, vibrant, chaotic, tense and interesting.  i think it's sort of rob's middle finger to the world, to make something so polarizing, and, for me, it works.  i find truth in it. i urge viewers, especially fellow horror fanatics, to step outside their boxes, take off their visors, and embrace this manic work of creativity.  it's a beautiful, horrible thing.",1354147200,7,5302,4.954954954954955

3066385,5,B0011G6FDI,I got to say that Rob Zombie rocked with this installment of the popular horror icon. He broght such freshness to the screen for Michael Myers. There couldn't have been a more serious and devoted filmmaker. He made Michael so much more aggresive in this one. Tyler Maine did an excilent job playing the famous knife wielding masked phycho path yet again. Which saddens me because alot of people did not like this one at all. Why? I'll never know. All I know is that when my hommie and I went to the theater to see this one we never looked at Michael Myers the same again. There was talk in hollywood about a possible third film but the only cath though was that Rob Zobie wasn't gonna be involved. It got shelved though. I sure do hope they do move foward from this storyline and have Rob at the helm.

It wasn't as good as the original 1978 horror classic of course,but it was still pretty good...but this movie. Oh my God! Did I mention how terrible this was??? The story is just way out there and does not make ANY sense at all! The acting is absolutley horrid. And what the hell is ""Weird Al"" Yankovic doing in a Halloween film anyway?

This movie is just as violent and sadistic as the previous if not more so. However that does not mean it is better in any way. We all know that in the last 5-7 years remakes of Classic horror movies have been a dime-a-dozen. Now in my personal opinion the majority of them have been pretty lame. this movie does seem to carry some weight in the aspect that it is a new look on the series while still keeping some original details. If you have watched the original movies which were born from John Carpenters Halloween then you may not care for this movie. However teens who have not experienced the original movies will probably enjoy this ""new"" look on Halloween. Overall i picked this up to add to my collection because it is not entirely horrible.

3066438,5,B0011G6FDI,"I will start this review off by saying that I am one of the few horror fans out there that prefer Rob Zombie's ""Halloween"" to John Carpenter's ""Halloween"". I know, it's blasphemy and I will go down in horror hell for saying such a thing. But I personally love the back story that Zombie gave Michael and feel as though everything about the film (from the acting to the directing to use of music) was just about perfect. Everything about the film really worked for me and it was with appreciation that I approached the sequel. Going in, I had heard nothing but TERRIBLE things. I mean downright AWFUL comments. ""One of the worst horror sequels ever made"" and ""Rob Zombie will burn in hell for what he has done to this series"" were some of the nicer comments. So is ""Halloween II"" really as awful as horror fans have made it out to be?

In a short flashback, Deborah Myers (Sheri Moon Zombie) visits her son, a young Michael Myers (Chase Wright Vanek), at Smith's Grove Sanitarium. Deborah gives Michael a white horse statuette as a gift. Michael says that the horse reminds him of a dream he had of Deborah's ghost, all dressed in white and leading a horse down the sanitarium halls toward Michael, telling him she was going to bring him home. Moving ahead fifteen years, after having shot an adult Michael (Tyler Mane), Laurie Strode (Scout Taylor-Compton) is found wandering around in a state of shock and covered in blood by Sheriff Brackett (Brad Dourif). Brackett takes Laurie to the emergency room. Meanwhile, the paramedics pick up the Sheriff's daughter Annie (Danielle Harris) and Michael's psychiatrist Dr. Loomis (Malcolm McDowell), who are still alive after having been attacked by Michael, and take them to the hospital. Presumed dead, Michael's lifeless body is loaded into a separate ambulance. When the driver has a traffic accident Michael awakens and escapes the ambulance, walking toward a vision of Deborah dressed in white and leading a white horse.

Michael appears at the hospital, and begins murdering everyone he comes across on his way to Laurie. Trapped in a security outpost at the gate, Laurie watches as Michael tears through the walls with an axe, but just as he tries to kill her, Laurie wakes up from the dream. It is actually one year later and Laurie is now living with the Bracketts. Michael's body has been missing since last Halloween--still presumed dead--and Laurie has been having recurring nightmares about the event. While Laurie deals with her trauma through therapy, Loomis has chosen to turn the event into an opportunity to write another book. Meanwhile, Michael has been having visions of Deborah's ghost and a younger version of himself, who instructs him that with Halloween approaching it is time to bring Laurie home; so he sets off for Haddonfield.

I know that most horror fans seem to despise this movie but I find it to be a beautiful shot, misunderstood gem of a horror film. I admire Zombie for not doing a straight up remake of the original sequel and I like how you actually are able to see the emotional grief that the first travesty has caused its characters. We are able to see Laurie and Annie as real, flesh and blood characters that are each trying to deal with this travesty the only way that they know how. It's not a perfect film (the horse imagery is out of place to say the least) but it is an ambitious film and that's more than you can say about most horror movies today.",1337990400,4,3443,4.697019867549669

Sadly, the same cannot be said for this sequel. Rob Zombie tries too hard to go out with a bang, and in doing so, skips a good storyline and real scares in exchange for an attempt at shock value and gore. This movie could be classified under the 'torture porn' category (this is not a good thing). Rent it if you must, but don't spend the money buying it. I'll sum it up for you: Michael Myers kills everyone (some while not fully clothed), and the 'surprise' ending isn't really a surprise (as it's alluded to for most of the movie).",1329004800,2,712,4.32089552238806

The plot is soooo far removed from the original {& far superior} Halloween II, that it should of died a quick death right from its conception. True, you shouldn't make a remake EXACTLY like the original, but that doesn't mean you should stray TOO FAR from the original. Actor Malcolm Mc Dowell's awful portrayal of Dr. Loomis is appalling. He makes Actor Donald Pleasance's BRILLIANT portrayal of the good Doctor cringe in embarrassment. Same with Actress Scout Taylor Compton, who portrayed Laurie Strode.

To this day, even in the remakes of this movie, there's something about that white mask that just sends chills down my spine every time I see it.

3066471,2,B0011G6FDI,"Every writer injects a little bit of his or her own personality into their work.  It's a very basic fact of the craft.  Characters may be from their own hometown or loosely based on themselves. Stephen King was in a horrible car accident, and guess what, so was the main character in ""Duma Key.""  But what sets good writers apart from bad ones is how well they can wrap those autobiographical elements in characters and places that AREN'T based on themselves.  You have to be able to craft a place that's real, believable, and populated with characters who feel both authentic and different from each other.  And that's where Rob Zombie is a complete failure.  He claims that Halloween II is entirely his vision, and that is the truest thing that's ever been said of this movie.  Sadly, though, Rob Zombie is a man possessed of a great deal of tunnelvision.  He likes gore, f-words, heavy metal music, and strippers.  So every element of this film reeks of those things.  There are topless dancers where topless dancers don't make sense.  Every line of dialogue sounds like Zombie himself could have uttered it.  You could really mix and match a great majority of the characters and the dialogue wouldn't be affected by this at all because they all sound like each other.  They all sound like Rob Zombie.

Of course, Rob wanted this movie to be different than its predecessor.  So he decided to make Michael Myers a real person.  To believe this premise, you have to believe that Myers can survive a great deal more punishment than any human being is capable of.  You have to believe that being locked in a psych ward for most of his life somehow resulted in a human Myers growing into a musclebound behemoth. You have to believe that a man who has been institutionalized all his life and has the education of a 12 year old can somehow be resourceful enough to survive living in the wilderness for 2 years.  You have to believe also that a deranged, psychopatic killer who ISN'T motivated by supernatural forces but rather by an instinctive desire to murder can somehow lay low for 2 years and then suddenly decide to start killing again.

Zombie wants you to believe this is a deeper, more psychological exploration of Michael Myers the character.  But do we really see anything in the film that goes deeper than Myers having mommy issues?  No. It's a shallow and contrived plot convention that has been used lots of times before. Norman Bates, anyone?  Then you have Zombie throwing all of that out the window by introducing a psychic link between Myers and Laurie, which undercuts his desire to leave the supernatural out of it. Laurie is no deep character either.  She's upset because, like, her parents are dead.  Didn't you hear her?  Her parents...are...dead. And she's really upset.  So of course she needs to go to a party.  Because that's what disturbed kids with dead parents do, right?

I was a fan of Zombie's first two movies because they didn't aspire to be anything more than creepy, bloody films that served as Zombie's homage to grindhouse and exploitation. They had trashy characters and f-words and nudity, and they were great because of it.  But with Halloween and Halloween II, Zombie has proven that he has a very shallow field of vision that can't possibly contain anything that isn't Rob Zombie.",1320105600,3,3320,4.715277777777778
3066472,5,B0011G6FDI,"This was an awesome film. I think the majority of negative reviews come from people who don't understand that Rob Zombie doesn't make movies to appeal to the mainstream. This isn't Halloween H20. Zombie trys to portray Myers as realistic as possible. If Myers was a real person, how would he survive? Zombie shows this by portraying Myers as a Bum, who lives on the countryside and survives by feasting on animals that no normal person would eat, such as a dog. I thought this was an amazing concept. It goes very well with how the first Zombie Halloween movie showed Myers past and how a person in real life might end being like him. This is another classic up there with The Devils Rejects, a previous Zombie movie which was also a great film. However, something truly genius will only be appreciated by a minority.",1320019200,,817,4.602739726027397
3066473,1,B0011G6FDI,"First we are treated to a 20 minute psych-out as Zombie creates a homage to Rick Rosenthal's original sequel, leading us to think this may be another rehash, but no it's all a dream. Boo.

However, you think things might be ok, since Zombie appears to be wanting to go his own way this time and create something original. Unfortunately he has almost nothing original to add.

Zombie tries to go artsy with these visitations from Myers dead mother. (glowing white like some sort of angel and being followed about by a white horse) I'm assuming this is just Myers mental state and not a real ghost...since I have no idea why Myers mother would come back and direct her son to kill people...unless Zombie just couldn't help channeling Jason Voorhees once again into this thing. In fact, the more I think about it, the more it seems that Zombie really should have done a Friday the 13th reboot. He seems to love those mother-son/abusive childhood elements.

Otherwise he throws in a lot a elements that are cobbed from the various bad sequels: The psychic link between Myers/Laurie (mirroring the psychic link between Myers/Jamie from Halloween V), The bizarre ""vacation"" Myers takes between Halloween holidays (from Halloween IV & V. What is he doing all that time?! Apparently he`s eating dogs all year and no one seems to notice)

The one thing Zombie does add that is his own is his treatment of the Dr Loomis character: he destroys it. This more than anything reinforces my belief in Zombie's obsessive love for the Myers character. Zombie is now not just happy with making the original film's villain the hero, but turning Dr Loomis into the films villain! Here, Loomis is just another exploitive, selfish element of the society that Myers rages against. It's no wonder Myers went bad, he didn't even have good doctors treating him. The whole character could have been excised, but I'm assuming Zombie got a thrill out of corrupting the hero.

Brad Dourif does a good job as Sheriff Brackett, surprisingly being an authority figure that doesn't seem to represent Evil Society, (breaking from Zombies usual theme) However, rather than representing an oppressive or exploitive authority figure, he actually seems to represent the incompetent authority figure. Of course this all comes crashing down on Brackett's head as his own daughter becomes a victim of Myers, aka Zombie's personification of rage against society. The implication being that if people like Brackett had been able to do their job right, such forces would not be unleashed.

As far as the killings go, Zombie indulges in soulless violence. He seems to think that SFX and quick cutting are enough. Simple brutality is supposed to awe us here. What Zombie does not realize is that that era is over. Audiences are so desensitized now that it's not enough. He does not seem to have an inkling that creating a world we can believe in and characters we can care about are how one creates an emotional response.

The ending is a convoluted mess I don't feel like explaining in detail...suffice to say that Zombie rips off the ending of Halloween IV. He just takes way more time and tries to cover up the simplistic idiocy of it all with gobs of cryptic nonsense.

What are we to make of all this? That Hollywood has given up and decided that fan-fics are the way to go now? How long until some internet goober's Halloween fan-fic porno is considered worthy of a film treatment? Is the film industry really going to stop allowing artists to make films and just allow talent-less panderers hold up a mirror to the audience?",1320019200,21,3583,4.7957860615883305

Halloween 1 by Rob Zombie was an astoundingly fresh take on the decades old Haddonfield horror story. It was dark and reminiscent of the 70's. Rob is obviously sentimental about this period like me. You had to be there for you young uns. However H2 severely let me down because the lives of everybody in this movie were so disgustingly trashy that you were hoping for them to get killed and by the end of the movie you feel like you've been dragged through the gutter. It is very depressing and just makes you want to throw it off like a coat that's too heavy. We forgive you though Rob because we know you're capable of much better.

Other than that, the movie was awesome and I suggest for anyone who like horror, music, or Rob Zombie in general.",1314921600,,350,4.612903225806452
3066490,2,B0011G6FDI,"First off, let me say that i've been a big fan of John Carpenter's ""Halloween"" since I first saw it in 1980. Parts 2-wherever they left off...not so much. But i've always believed strongly that the original was, and is, one of the greatest horror movies ever made. Carpenter understood that mounds of gore and constant 'false' scares (the cat jumps out of the closet, etc) did nothing for a film's fear factor-in fact, the director is always far more important than the content. If you don't believe that, watch Hitchcock's ""Psycho""...then watch the remake. If you can stay awake through it.
  That being said, there's room in the genre for an artist that liberally piles on the carnage and shocks, as long as that artist has a vision beyond his potential paycheck for the inevitable sequel(s). Once I saw Rob Zombie's ""The Devil's Rejects"", I felt certain that the innovative musician had truly found his niche. He successfully created a film that could truly be called the only other possible compliment one can bestow upon a horror movie besides 'terrifying'...that compliment being 'disturbing'.
  Naturally, when i heard Carpenter's classic would be getting the old 'revision' treatment, I was mildly angry. Does EVERY good-to-great motion picture need to be re-enacted for the attention deficient generation? Still, at the announcement of Zombie being given the honors, I had to assume that an essence of actual quality was likely. I also felt a bit saddened for the former 'White Zombie' frontman-just as 'Rejects' had introduced a potentially potent new force in the horror film industry, i knew there was no better way to knock people off your bandwagon than screwing up a beloved classic, especially one made by the equally admired Carpenter.
  But once I finally decided to check out Mr. Zombie's remake, some 4 years after it's release, I was surprised, even shocked. This was one 're-imagining' that actually lived up to that oft-used, rarely-enacted word. Succinctly put, Rob Zombie's ""Halloween"" scared the bodily fluids out of me. It picked up where ""Devil's Rejects"" had left off in the 'disturbing' department. Monumentally graphic, but exuding a confidence lacking from other 'unstoppable serial killer of horny teenagers' flicks, I viewed each ensuing scene with dread-the good kind. By the time it was over, sleep was but a distant fantasy. Basically, it freaked me out.
  So I found myself almost eager to check out Zombie's version of ""Halloween II""-as little as I cared for the original film with the same title, I assumed the lack of high standards to live up to would just loosen the director's reigns even more. And after a brutally violent first act, which mostly took place in the hospital that housed poor Laurie Strode, I was pleasantly surprised to see that Zombie wasn't going to follow that cliched, limiting format that so hurt the original ""II""-that is, the action remaining inside the hospital for the movie's duration.
  Imagine my disappointment when, as the film dragged on, it gradually dawned on me that Zombie, in fact, had no grand vision to display. With each increasingly violent murder, it became obvious that Zombie had fallen into the ol' 'crazy masked psycho' trap-that is, depending on the audience's visceral reaction to the bloody massacres onscreen to mask the absence of any real imagination or creativity.
  Unlike his previous Michael Myers treatment, I had no such reservations about going to sleep once the final credits had rolled. It wasn't awful-there were some genuinely original and shocking moments scattered amongst the dreck; but the final verdict is in, and it's clear that Rob Zombie took the money and ran. Hopefully, it won't damage what i feel is still a very bright future, and will only exist as a blip on the road to horrifying greatness for the only director who can be called 'More human than human'.",1313712000,3,3877,5.003105590062112
3066491,2,B0011G6FDI,"Halloween II is absolutely dreadful.  I never would have guessed a horror movie that focused around nonstop violence, lots of blood and frequent stabbings would stink as much as it does, but well, it's true!  It's 100% true in fact.  I hated this film.

Oh sure, it starts out fine.  A nurse gets stabbed, and a teenage girl runs for her life down a hospital hallway the moment she witnesses a huge figure running towards her with a knife.  Eventually however, the storyline seems to go away completely and turn into a mess of random killings and disjointed storyline segments focusing entirely around this one girl.  The storyline isn't coherent enough and it showed.  People would just appear out of nowhere, and they'd die.  Zero concern for storyline consistency.

Plus there was a constant question buzzing inside of my head ""Why am I torturing myself with a low budget horror film?""  The acting, the stabbings and the supposed ""suspense"" were all really predictable and cliched.  The only truly interesting aspect is that people would die while classic rock songs were being played in the background such as 10cc's ""The Things We Do for Love"", the Moody Blues ""Nights in White Satin"" and Lynyrd Skynyrd's ""What's Your Name?""  That was the only interesting part of the movie- the song selection while death would occur.

I highly recommend avoiding this disaster of a horror movie.  The storyline was confusing, the deaths were predictable and bland, and the level of excitement just wasn't high enough to leave me with much of an impression.",1313366400,2,1547,4.8961538461538465
3066492,1,B0011G6FDI,"First of all, I like some of Rob Zombie's music. I have nothing against him. But he tried to push ""zombie"" type stuff in this movie and not only did it not work, but it ruined the whole point.

In the original movies, the character of Michael is mysterious, he is silent, and there is almost a sadness or feeling that he is missing something deep down. In the Zombie films though (at least this one, haven't seen the first one for a long time) this character is completely gone. Now Michael is apparently some old guy with a beard who eats raw dog meat and actually makes grunting noises while he kills. Now his character is protrayed as angry, ruthless, and just out to hurt people, completely unlike the original Michael.

The main thing I hate about this film is that Rob Zombie tried to make this into some sort of shocking grindhouse zombie movie. Michael's sister apparently lives in this middle class house, but her bedroom and bathroom look like the back room of some heavy metal band. Posters with cuss words all over them, a poster of Charles Manson, basically something that has nothing to do with the story but had to be added because it's a ""zombie"" movie now. When she finds out she is Michael's sister and becomes angry, she insists that she wants to go partying (really realistic). So they go to some party with people in really unrealistic mostly gothic looking costumes and topless women just hanging around dancing (is this a halloween party or a Zombie concert?).

The death scenes just *had* to be made especially disgusting, such as Michael stomping on someone's head, sawing someone's head off, etc. As expected there are crude jokes about dead girls and general depravity.

In the first movie I was actually interested in the storyline about Michael's long lost sister. In this movie it gets old. Now the ghost of her dead mother and Michael as a child follow him around and there is some weak storyline where Michael is supposed to find her so they can become a family again. In the end there is no conclusion to this.

Strippers, violence, sex, goth chicks, heavy metal, parties, topless women, the F bomb repeated over and over, am I missing anything? this whole film made me feel like I was watching a backstage movie of a Rob Zombie concert. Poorly done.",1312848000,10,2283,4.613300492610837
3066493,5,B0011G6FDI,"The backlash against this film is ridiculous.  I'll admit, when I first saw it in theatres - I hated it for the first half of the movie.  I felt betrayed by the use of the hospital scene - and I thought it was just grim and disgusting and didn't feel like a spooky horror movie you can sit back and enjoy while munching on popcorn.  Well, Rob Zombie doesn't make movies like that.  He isn't playful or tongue in cheek.  What Rob Zombie has done here was to take well-worn mythology and turn it into something realistic and evil and horrifying.

Don't get me wrong - the original ""Halloween"" is the greatest slasher movie of all time.  In fact, I have more of an issue with the first remake being even necessary.  However, because it was remade, and because there was a sequel - I feel it deserves a serious look.  I own the original Halloween series, but let's be honest- they're pretty weak.  (Don't get me wrong I love them but they fall flat compared to Nightmare on Elm Street or even Friday the 13th).  However, this movie is disturbing, disgusting, and horrifying.  And I think that was the point.  Rob wasn't making a movie about a spooky boogieman who can't die.  He was making a movie about Michael Myers as a very real and very evil person.  Moreover, the exploration of the mental strain placed on Laurie Strode as well as the rest of Haddonfield in the aftermath of the first film's events is compelling and very well done.

The movie is sometimes difficult to watch - and I don't mean because of the violence.  It seems Rob did get somewhat corny with Laurie becoming a gothic-type recluse and screaming her feelings to anyone who will listen.  On the other hand - it does emphasize what it could be like for someone living their life after such an ordeal.  The movie doesn't entertain in the way that many horror movies do - in that we're rooting for the killer and laughing afterward.  Here, Rob Zombie shows just how scary such behavior is.  Michael Myers isn't a hero - he's a dangerous psychopath who cannot stop killing.  Rob's take on the characters is very refreshing including, love it or hate it, making Loomis into a huge douchebag.  I wish they would have released both versions on one disc - because I have a tough time deciding which ending I like better.  Even the changes in end titles music is a characteristic that makes a big difference.  It's a shame Rob won't be doing a third one.  You might be glad he's not - but I'll bet there were people who were glad Tim Burton didn't do the third Batman movie and look how that turned out.",1312848000,4,2564,4.436830835117773
3066494,2,B0011G6FDI,"The title says ""Halloween II"" and it pretty much is more of the same from writer/director Rob Zombie... unfortunately, all Zombie can seem to manage is angry white trash yelling at each other and dropping f-bombs every other word, so if that's your cup of tea, then this movie's for you. In all honesty, this film does seem to be a step up from Zombie's previous entry, but that's not really saying much as almost any goofball with a camcorder could probably whip up a more decent movie than Zombie can with tons of money at his disposal. At any rate, Zombie seems to tone down the psychological mumbo-jumbo that permeated throughout his first film, which would be a good thing if he didn't replace it with just as heavy-handed spiritual mumbo-jumbo that has something to do with Michael reforming his family at any cost.

To this end, you get a lot of shots of Sheri Moon Zombie walking around in a flowing white dress like some sort of celestial being and toting a white horse that has some sort of ham-handed link to Michael's state of mind. Even with an opening quote that sort-of explains the whole 'white horse' schtick, that whole plot point really just serves the dual purpose of allowing Zombie to try some artsy-fartsy film composition and to shoehorn his wife into the film yet again. She mostly goes around muttering cryptic lines that are supposed to mean something, but I'm pretty sure these scenes are there so Rob can get some sort of fantasy Ridley Scott aspirations out of his system.

So, with that counting as the motivation for Michael (more or less), it's on to a film filled with just as many unlikable characters as the first one. Returning as Laurie Strode is Scout-Taylor Compton, who manages the rare feat of being even more annoying than in the first film. Obviously, she didn't take any acting lessons in between the two films and here she is, yet again, to force the audience to not even remotely like the film's central protagonist. There's no two ways around it - she's terrible, terrible, terrible. Need convincing? Watch the scene where she finds out she's Michael's sister and then runs to her work pals to party it up because she's tired of being the good girl. At one point, she exclaims: ""I want to party! I mean, f--- it, guys..."" in one of cinema's all-time worst line readings. It's so embarassing, it physically hurts. I mean, my friends and I made our own backyard films and we knew our acting was terrible, but this here... this right here... is supposedly a major motion picture and this is what we get for our lead? This girl needs to stop, take a breath, and reconsider her choice of profession. Sure, I'm being hard on her, but it's the truth. Here you have a character who was made sympathetic and likable in the previous incarnation by Jamie Lee Curtis (and it was the role that effectively launched her career) and I'm not saying Compton has to do the same thing, but just some sort of attempt at acting would be appreciated. Not this flailing around, screaming nonsense. Have you ever seen a kid in a department store completely lose it and start going into a fit because they don't want to be in the store anymore? That's kind of what Compton's acting is like and it's just as annoying. The average filmgoer will also have the same reaction that the average shopper would have upon seeing this: ""please remove this screaming child from my sight. Please leave it at home before subjecting the general public to this menace."" If there were ever a more distinct vision that would endorse birth control, I have yet to find it.

Anyways, she's useless and is just as grating as the last film. Also returning is Danielle Harris as Annie Brackett - one of only two likable characters in the film (the other being her dad Sheriff Brackett, played by Brad Dourif). She's a little more toned down in this film and a heckuva lot more likable. Unfortunately, she doesn't get to do much besides be a doormat for Laurie's drama. Ultimately, her fate is sealed and it looks like she won't be back for the next installment, which is sad because this series needed more Danielle Harris (once again, I'm left wondering how much better this film would be if Harris had played Laurie Strode. Then again, I also wonder how much better this series would be if they'd stop letting Rob Zombie wander on set to direct things.)

Malcolm McDowell is back as well, but it's such a thankless role that it really doesn't seem to matter whether he's here or not. It's interesting to see the character of Sam Loomis pull away from being the ultimate force of good and turn into the ultimate force of douche, but I guess I just don't get the purpose of it. Typically, Loomis is the yin to Michael's yang and it's a bit like having a Sherlock Holmes with no Moriarty the way Zombie presents him here. To be honest, I don't mind screwing with the formula, but there's no one here who really provides any sort of a threat to Michael and I guess it just seems to make the confrontations all the more meaningless because whatever's going on with Michael is going on inside of his head (which is filled with white ponies and Sheri Moon Zombie uttering bizarre fortune cookie dialogue.)

Like the first film, it's fun to pick out the random cameos from faces that may or may not be familiar - hey, Margot Kidder! Is that Dauber from ""Coach""? Oh, Frogurt from ""Lost""... nice to see you... and there you go through a car windshield... Bye! Other than these little moments, there's not much else in the way of casting that's anything to comment on. So, on to the film itself...

The film picks up from where the last film left off and it sort of jumps over major plot points without too much to-do about it. Laurie shot Michael in the face at the end of the last movie, but here he is walking around like some sort of ersatz Unabomber. He's mostly just hanging out in a shack somewheres, biding his time until next Halloween (actually two Halloweens from the previous Halloween - guess he took a year off to travel... or eat dogs... or whatever...) Though everyone makes a big deal about Michael's body disappearing, nobody seems to have gone looking for it and while I'm not sure how far away he is from Haddonfield in this movie, it sure seems like the cops gave up pretty quickly on finding him. Or maybe they never even looked for him in the first place - I dunno; cops in these types of films never seem to bother with procedure or with basic police work, so I guess it's okay. Laurie's still bothered by her previous encounter with Michael - so much so, that she has a 20 minute dream sequence involving a hospital after her initial attack from the first film (I guess this is a bit of an homage to the original Halloween II, but Zombie wisely chose not to restrict his sequel just to this one setting.) She's living with the Brackett's and, in general, just being kind of a pain in the ass (there's one scene where she hangs out with her new work friends and they rock out to ""Kick Out the Jams"" - which blew my mind that these kids would even know of that song, but I guess this is one aspect of teenage life that Zombie got right, whether intentionally or unintentionally. I'm not a music snob by any means, but I always found it funny when teenagers start to discover music that was made before today. They always seem to ignore any sort of context in which the song came about and instead choose to just rock out - kind of like listening to a 60's era protest song, but being completely ignorant about anything having to do with Vietnam. It's a moment that's just kind of humorous, exciting and sad all at once.)

Sorry about that tangent... so, Halloween comes around and Michael makes his way to Haddonfield and kills pretty much anything that gets in between him and his sister. There's a lot of Michael just walking into situations where he kills everything in sight and it sort of makes you wish for the way they did things in the old ""Halloween"" films where Michael would just drive to wherever he was going. There was no screwing around with random rednecks, strip joint a-holes or little kids who never learned not to talk to strangers. As funny as the thought of Michael Meyers driving around town was to me in the old films, I do kind of miss that as it gave the films a weird sort of charm that was lacking in your typical slasher film of the era. At any rate, Michael eventually gets to his sister and there's a lot of blah-blah-blah about being a family again, but Loomis finally shows up and everyone fires a lot of rounds of bullets into the Big Double M and he supposedly dies (then again, he was shot in the face in the first film, so why anyone thinks this is going to work this time is beyond me... then again, we've already mentioned that these cops aren't firing on all cylinders here, so whatever.) Then the movie ends with a completely ridiculous ending that tries to be arty-farty and just downright retarded all at the same time. I don't really know what Zombie's going for here at the end and, honestly, I don't care. I hate Laurie in this film, so anything having to do with her just goes over my head because I can't work up enough investment in the character. In fact, I just found myself thinking of other things whenever Laurie was on screen. Things such as the following:

1.) What era does this movie take place in? I asked this in the last film as well and this film seems to not conform to any specific timeline either. It's clearly a post-2000 era, but all that's ever on TV is old-ass cartoons and The Moody Blues (singing ""Nights in White Satin"" - presumably because Sheri Moon Zombie wanders around in white satin... subtlety doesn't seem to be Rob Zombie's strong point.)

2.) Though Michael killed a lot of people in the last film, the residents of Haddonfield don't seem concerned that his body was never found. No one moves away and no one seems to let this fact impair their enjoyment of the holiday. The parents even let their kids trick or treat on Halloween with no adult supervision. Worst. Parents. Ever.

3.) Why does everyone have a Halloween costume that's way more elaborate than anything you're ever likely to see ever? You see a lot of that in the Halloween party sequence. Speaking of... how old are these characters? In the last film, Laurie and company were still in high school, so at best, they were seniors and probably 18, but though it's only 2 years later, they attend a monster blowout that features lots of alcohol and rampant nudity and none of the cops seem to mind that this happens. They just all seem to hang out at the police station. Um, if cops knew there was some huge party going down that would probably be serving alcohol to minors, they would be camped outside that party all evening long busting everybody. Yet, like the parents of Haddonfield, the cops seem to have no clue. What's going on in this town?

4.) How come the town strip joint is empty all night? It's not even midnight yet and there's no one there. Most strip joints are open till 2 or 3 in the morning and, even at closing time, there's still a ton of people there. Wouldn't a strip joint that advertises being the home of Michael Meyers' mom be jumping the night before Halloween? Where is everybody in this town? Why did that one guy have to take out the garbage at the strip joint? Who made that garbage? There's no one there to produce any garbage. Why does this scene exist?

5.) So, Laurie survives an attack by a serial killer in the first film and is pretty screwed up because of it, but for some reason, she decorates her room with a giant poster of Charles Manson, one of the most well-known serial killers of all time? WTF?

6.) The entire Meyers family has some sort of psychic link.... oooookay.... So, this only kicks in if Michael is eating a dog and Laurie is eating vegetarian pizza at the same time? Where was this in the last movie? Suddenly, the Meyers' are psychics now? If only she had cool Firestarter powers like Drew Barrymore... or maybe she could have fought Michael with her psychic ninja powers like that one chick did against Jason Voorhees in that one Friday the 13th movie... That might've been better than what I'm watching now.

7.) How come Michael wears his mask sometimes, but not all the time? In the last movie, it was a big deal that Michael wore the mask because he was no longer Michael Meyers the sweet little kid and he just sort of regressed into his mask which was a way to deal with his being a killer. Now it just sort of appears and disappears at will. I guess no one wins on this because, frankly, he looked dumb with this mask on and he looked dumb without it on, so whatever.

All in all, this is a pretty lackluster film that doesn't deliver a whole lot. On the plus side, it has a ton of gore for the hardcore fans and it does have one scene that was nicely done and created a great amount of tension: when Annie is attacked and she slowly looks up to see Michael standing off to the side, the film then jumps to slow-motion and Zombie finally delivers the sense of dread he's been trying to get for two films now. For me, this was the one standout scene of the film and it showed just a touch of the right effect at the right time in an effort to truly play off the absolute dread that should exist in that scene. Wonderfully done, but not enough to redeem the entire movie. However, I will give Rob the credit on that one - if more of the movie were like this scene, it would be much easier to recommend this film.

As it stands, there's not a lot here to recommend. If you were a fan of Zombie's first film, then you'll probably carry on liking this one. If you weren't a fan of his previous film, then there's not much here that'll change your mind about Zombie as a filmmaker. Overall, I would say that this film was better than the first, but not by much. A good scene here, a really brutal gore scene there and the rest is just filler. Zombie doesn't really leave much to go on at the end of this one so it remains to be seen when and if another sequel will take place. For my money, I'd still be interested to see him just do his own riff on ""Halloween III: Season of the Witch"" and I think it'd be hilarious if both part 3's of both series had nothing to do with Michael Meyers, but I guess we'll just have to wait and see.

Maybe Zombie did what no other person could do... maybe he effectively killed off Michael Meyers for good.",1312675200,10,14461,4.426371149511645
3066495,4,B0011G6FDI,"This movie is a good sequel. The beginning reminded me of the original sequel which I loved. The whole movie was pretty good & I own it. I can see why so many people think this movie is atrocious, but they are failing to see the symbolism in this movie. At the beginning it gives you the symbolic definition of a white horse, which is a sign for purity. The visions in the movie that Laurie have are showing her connection with Michael and they are not just pointless. This movie was pretty good but nothing can compare to the first two. I like how Zombie took a different approach to the story instead of just re-doing it as we have seen before (Friday the 13th, which I thought was awful.) HIs take on it adds a whole new perspective and people need to realize that. Great movie, just wish there was more of Michael chasing Laurie whic freaked me out in the first place with the originals.",1309910400,,891,4.309523809523809

Surely purists of the original Halloween will undoubtedly keep the flame burning by trashing Zombie's latest horror flick. Either that or they will just sit this one out to wait for the Redbox rental & Netflix. In my honest opinion, I'd much rather be stabbed to death by Michael Myers himself than to sit through another one of those inane sequels to the original Carpenter flick. In fact, I'm kinda disappointed that no one acknowledges let alone admit that Zombie is actually breathing life into the lackluster horror genre. Obviously, Rob has stolen the crown of bloody horror from Bava, Franco, & I daresay even Argento. Eli Roth, eat your heart out dude! All hail the new King of mainstream horror & his name is Rob Zombie!

In the very first montage, we see a young Myers visited by his mother (played by Zombie's beloved wife) where he explains that his dreams of one day reuniting with the family. His mother then gives him a white horse toy as a gift & tells him to think of her whenever he plays with the horse. Michael hates nearly everyone in the world but he loves mommy & misses her more than life itself. Viewers can't help but feel a tad bit sorry for the tike in Zombie's reboot of the original & the sequel.

The film cuts to a dark yet colorful street where bloodied Laurie Strode is walking home. After being located by a police car, she is taken to a nearby hospital where she's treated & learns that her best friend Annie is still alive but in critical condition. After being told to vacate the ICU room & to return to her own room, Laurie realizes she is not strong enough to make it back down the hallway & calls for help. Quickly, our heroine realizes she's not alone & that Michael is in the hospital terrorizing the nurses. It's time to escape once again & the nightmare doesn't seem to be over. Not yet, at least.

Laurie wakes up screaming in her bed & realizes the hospital massacre was just a nasty dream, it's almost a year later after the events that took place in Haddonfield & Laurie is now living with Annie & her dad (played by the very underrated Brad Dourif) in the countryside. She's taking baby steps to rid herself of the traumatic experiences by visiting a shrink (Margot Kidder) who encourages her to face the demon & try to realize why these nightmares actually exist. Although Laurie would rather put all this out of her mind, she knows Halloween is just around the corner & dreaded memories are fairly easy to recall. What she doesn't realize is that family will be dropping in real soon.

H2 picks up right after Zombie's remake of the original took place & things are about to take a turn for the bloody worst if one can fathom such. Michael Myers' dead body was never found on that night of the Halloween massacre even though Laurie Strode tries to tell herself repeatedly that she killed the man in the mask. Sadly, Laurie can't seem to completely get on with her life & the recurring nightmares of that night. In fact, she even fears that homicidal tendencies may very well run in her blood although she still has no idea who her real family is. She's about to find out rather quickly who brother dearest is & that family is forever whether she likes it or not.

Dr. Loomis (played by magnificent Malcolm McDowell) on the other hand seems to be doing exceptionally well profiteering off the innocent lives of families who lost their loved ones by writing a novel which gives specifics to the origins of Michael Myers. Loomis even goes so far as to give details of Laurie's Strode's origins including her birth name & whereabouts as well. To further exploit the entire brutal massacre, his publishers insists on releasing the book on none other than Halloween. Fame & fortune seem to have smiled on our greedy Dr. Loomis & he's now a national celebrity to be seen everywhere including on a talk show with special guest Weird Al Yankovic.

Zombie obviously has a knack for creating some of the violent if not sickening images ever put on the mainstream circuit & we really should praise the man for actually getting away with it. There is a rather intense scene near the beginning of the film where two coroners discuss necrophilia before crashing head-on into a vehicle on the country road in what may very well be the most ugly car crash I've ever witnessed in a horror flick. One of the latter montages finds Myers crushing a man's face with his foot which could very be a homage to Gaspar Noe's scene in the notorious film Irreversible where a man's face is smashed with a fire extinguisher. In another graphic scene, Michael stabs a nurse repeatedly to a bloody pulp which could've very well earned the film a solid NC-17 rating. Even more sickening, our villain kills a dog on a prairie & proceeds to gutting the poor animal before eating it in gruesome detail. Thus, Zombie is one of the few directors who can envision some of the most mortifying imagery ever & still manage to find a home in your local multiplexes.

Above all else, Zombie has created some of the most unique if not artistic dream sequences I've seen in a long time which are unlike anything you will find in a typical slasher film. I can already hear the comparisons to Tim Burton (or even veterans like David Lynch come to mind) but I'd almost be willing to purchase this film on DVD for these sequences alone & I'd even be willing to bet many viewers would re-think their own judgment of Zombie if they were to check out these fantastic images. If Michael Myers has dreams like this, I'm truly envious. Kudos to Zombie!

In addition to making a film which should be cherished by slasher film aficionados everywhere worldwide, Zombie proves once again he can write some very intelligent dialog when he's not dropping the infamous f-bomb. (As with any film he makes, the language is extremely coarse & the dude clearly has no intention of mincing his words.) As with any sequel or reboot, try to watch this film for what it is instead of bashing it for not being an exact replica of the Carpenter classic. Personally,  I believe H2 could have very well been his opus had he just spent a bit more time with it although this is still one of the best horror offerings you are going to find & I would gladly take this any day over the unnecessary remakes we've seen all year long like Friday The 13Th for example. If Zombie isn't your thing, there's still plenty of crap-tastic PG-13 entertainment at your local cinema to make up for H2.",1309132800,4,6472,4.5286569717707446
3066507,1,B0011G6FDI,"The movie cover looks awesome, but really my friend was right. It was stupid! I wanted to see it for myself, and it was just stupid.
First off, Donald Pleasance would probably be dissapointed on how Rob Zombie reinvented Dr. Loomis. Instead of being concerned about finding Michael Myers and saving Laurie Strode, he's some guy who writes novels about how he's seen the evil in Michael Myers and is some greedy bastard that only cares about fame. Michael Myers mask is completely ruined, and the reason why Michael Myers is after Laurie Strode or excuse me ""Angie Myers"" so that they can be together with the mom or some stupid ridiculous crap. There is NOTHING original about the Halloween II remake. And she keeps having stupid dreams that don't make any sense at all, and of course Rob Zombie has to overdo EVERYTHING! He adds extra extra gore and unnecessary crap, honestly you really feel like turning the movie off, I wasted two hours of watching this. Seriously Halloween: Ressurection was waaaay better than this. People were saying that the old Michael Myers trilogy was going sour, and that they were running out of ideas, but Halloween H20 and Ressurection are far more better than putting a John Carpenter classic into the hands of Rob Zombie. I was thinking the same thing, it probably was gonna take place in the hospital, and it kinda does in the begining, but then it turns out to be some stupid nightmare, and is totally different, and isn't worth your time at all. They must have lost so much money remaking an actual classic that didn't need to be remade at all. The first Halloween remake was decent, but still not great. Coming from a die-hard Halloween fan who has a Michael Myers tattoo of the original mask, I'm seriously gonna tell you, Watch the original Halloween, Halloween II, Halloween 4, Halloween 5, Halloween: Curse of Michael Myers, Halloween: H20, and Halloween: Ressurection They're all great films, and don't need to explain why Michael Myers is the way he is, you just understand the concept as you go from film to film why he is the way he is. and make sure you get the ones that say ""A John Carpenter Film.""",1308700800,7,2147,4.667546174142481
3066508,1,B0011G6FDI,"I don't even know where to start......

First and foremost I am going to put this out there; I do not care for Rob Zombie. I never really cared for his music, not to say it is bad it just doesn't do anything for me.  So when I first heard he was going into the realm of cinema I wasn't too excited about it.  I totally detested ""House of a 1000 Corpses"", awful.  My friend suggested to me to watch his version of ""Halloween"" claiming that it was actually pretty good.  Being a fan of the old school ""Halloween"" flicks I figure I would give it a shot.  I must confess that I enjoyed aspects of ""Zombie's Halloween"" (mainly Malcolm McDowell version of Dr. Sam Loomis) but overall didn't care for it.  I figured I might as well watch the sequel, what a mistake.....

I will take back my original thoughts about Zombie's 2007 version of ""Halloween""; I appreciate it much more after I watch this schlock of a sequel.  In stead of providing text why this movie was awful I am going to note some key points.

* Don't know why Michael Myers was so pro-mask in the first film and in this sequel he would take it off quite a bit.

* Michael Myers looked like The Undertaker (the wrestler).

* Michael Myers eats a dog.

* I never thought I would get sick of seeing a white horse and a lady dressed in white. The lady in white is Michael's mom; the role is played poorly by Zombie's wife. I don't know who the horse is.

* Why waste 20 plus minutes on a no reason hospital dream?

* The character development of Dr. Sam Loomis wasn't believable as a money/media whore, given what had transpired in the previous film.  Then the last minute ""change of heart""?

* If a dollar could be given to repay the ""government bailout"" every time Laurie Strode cried, this country would be out of a recession.

* Speaking of Laurie Strode, Scout Taylor-Compton's acting was so horrible. Was she supposed to be a whiny Emo girl? I lost count how many times she used the F word and stated her life ""sucked"".

* Rob Zombie loves using the F word.

* The acting in this movie was truly poor.

* The over the top blood and guts was basically torture porn.  It is like Zombie is trying so hard to be ""dark"" and ""disturbing"" and it comes off comical. For instance, Michael Myers was going out of his way to kill people. Some of these moments I was laughing so hard it hurt.

* Every character was unlikeable; I truly didn't care what happened to anyone.  I am still questioning myself why I didn't turn the movie off.

* The entire supernatural/psyche aspect of Myers and Strode's relationship was totally out of left field.

* Does Margot Kidder know Rob Zombie?  Her two small scenes seemed really out of place.

* Did I mention the white horse and the lady dressed in white? Oh and Michael Myers eats a dog.

This movie didn't receive the praise as its predecessor and I can see why.  This movie at the end of the day was unnecessary; everything was really tied up in the first film.  This movie was nothing more that a pot boiler.  Recommended for a deflating your IQ or hard core Rob Zombie fan.",1308096000,22,3068,4.300174520069808
3066509,1,B0011G6FDI,"This movie was nothing but trash.  One reviewer said to mention this to your enemies. I wouldn't even do that!!  That would be inhumane.  Not only did this completely trash every character ( loomis is now a  money grabbing opportunist. Really?! ) Not to mention when it comes to blood and gore, those things alone does not a good horror film make. THe amount of gore, violence, profanity is ridiculous. This really should have been rated X  and not R.  The good side?  At least in this one zombie doesn't promote teenage sex like he did in the first.",1305590400,4,550,4.494949494949495

I have no problems with blood and gore, but the changes made to the characters was ridiculous. In the original Halloween 2 we rooted for Laurie, but in this remake I just wanted her character dead. She deserved all she got.
Just another example of a remake that destroys what we loved about the original.",1303862400,7,393,4.472222222222222
3066511,4,B0011G6FDI,"Though the film was met with a large majority of bad reviews I for one loved Zombie's sequel to his first re-telling of Halloween. A lot of the common staples of Michael Myers are removed. He talks (once), and we do get to see inside his psyche and see first hand what makes him tick. The look of Myers is great,coming across more like some twisted vision of a pagan frankenstein rather than a mysterious phantom. It seems as if the biggest problem with Halloween enthusiast when confronted with Zombie's re-imagining is that it indeed is a re-imagining and not a frame by frame remake of the original,when in fact dubiously copying the film (much like they did with the remake of A Nightmare on Elm Street) does more to insult and discredit the work put forth by the original cast and crew. No this film will not appease the hardcore halloween fans,but really,what would? At least Myers is not castrated by the pop culture in being kung fu kicked through a wall by Busta Ryhtmes this time around.

My biggest problem is everything Zombie employes in this revision,I believe would have worked far better in a friday the 13th remake rather than one for Halloween.",1299801600,3,1162,4.640776699029126

3066513,1,B0011G6FDI,"First let me start off by saying that up until this point I pretty much loved everything that Rob Zombie did. The first Halloween was a great movie and a refreshing take on a franchise that had seemed to run its course. This movie is just plain horrible, and not in a good way. Why is it that he has to throw his wife into everything he does now. Her part in the movie made no sense and seemed like it was written in so that she could be in this movie. Michael Meyers as a hobo? Come on this is a real stretch. After watching this movie I was actually upset that I had wasted all that time to watch it. I think I'll just stick with House of 1000 Corpses and use this DVD as a coaster.",1298246400,9,684,3.9280575539568345

3066547,1,B0011G6FDI,"The title of my review says it all. Zombie is a music video director, and his jumbled, and downright unlikeable movies, with their overkill cursing and almost comical vulgarity for vulgarity's sake, fall flat on their faces time and time again. I love horror movies, Rob and I probably love many of the same movies. But, the injustice that he has done to a classic, TWICE, is no homage. He needs to learn from the past instead of trying to mash up genres and loosely hold them together with trash film-making. How these movies end up in theaters round the country is beyond me...Wait, no, it's solely on the name Rob Zombie that he is given so much freedom.

For some incomprehensible reason  the Moody Blues singing ""Nights In White Satin"" is playing on televisions in the background while the first two or three murders are being committed.

Unlike the original halloween movies rob zombie takes this whole movie to pretty much describe WHY michael myers kills and what drives him. He also goes MUCH more in depth in the charecter lauri and truely shows just how messed up you would be after an incident like a mass murder took place in your life. The coolest part about this film and what made it such an instant classic for me definatly just had to be the scenes when michael was speaking with his mothers ghost. This just showed the true side of michael myers and raised the question in the end are we THAT much better than he is? He was just sacrificing for the ones he loved. Anyways its a great flick and full of gore and psyche and violence. Solid 4 in my book and she be picked up by any horror film fan in general.,1293667200,3,886,4.2176470588235295

Not close but I liked the whole back story and Michael Myers looked pretty cool and Scout Taylor Compton crappy acting I could overlook. But now to the second, I gave it two stars all because of Michael Myers he was awsome and I did like the whole thing with his Mother and him as a young Michael Myers around him that was cool to me. But other than that. They made Dr Loomis into something that to me that probably made Donald Plesence roll in his grave. Now I feel Malcolm Mcdowell is a legend an icon to movies but they made Dr Loomis something that made me sick to my stomach. If you are a horror purist don't even think about watching it. And if you are a huge Michael Myers fan buy this as cheap as you can. I did for a dollar. Because I really feel Tyler Mane does a great job. He is not as great as Tony Moran and the others who played Michael Myers in my opinion but I think he is the only reason I can watch this movie ""Good thing for scene selection and skipping option on a dvd player""  I really hated what they made Laurie Into. That is just spitting on Jamie Lee Curtis in my opinion. I would suggest to get this as low of a price as you can. Netflix it or redbox it.

3066552,3,B0011G6FDI,"Two years after Michael Myers decimated Haddonfield, Laurie is no longer a good girl. The nightmares have taken their toll; she's drinking, partying, anything to forget. Dr. Loomis is coping in his own way; he's written a tell-all book about the Halloween massacre and is drinking up the media love. Only Michael is still Michael, doing what Michael does. Working his way across the countryside, killing everyone whose path he crosses, he's set on getting Laurie this time. And he has supernatural help: his mother has come back, dressed in white, riding a white horse, telling him he needs to put the family back together. And that means Laurie has to die.

Halloween II is not a faithful retelling of the original, as Zombie's Halloween was, but a completely new story under the same title. It's also a return to his grindhouse roots, with lurid sex and violence, garish colors, and far more graphic killing than in Halloween. The difference between his version of Halloween and this movie is jolting and problematic. It doesn't really work as a sequel, and would have been better made as a standalone movie, names and places changed to protect the first movie.

If you like House of 1,000 Corpses and the Devil's Rejects, then you might like this version of Halloween II, but if you're looking for something more like Zombie's first remake, you'll be disappointed.",1292198400,8,1367,4.887931034482759

3066554,2,B0011G6FDI,"Well, to start things off, I was really looking foward to this movie. Considering that Zombie just ruined the whole point of remakes. I actually enjoyed the first Halloween remake, but this movie just tanked everything.

We see at the beginning of the movie. Michael as a child and his mom in Smith's Grove Sanitarium, where he was put after killing his sister. But he was given a white horse to reprsent his mom. But, about a minuet or so later, we see that Laurie is walking down the street absoltely covered in blood, and once Sheriff Brackett pulls over and ask's her what happeneed, she starts saying, ""I killed him,"" about four or five times. So of course, she is taken to a hospital, and so is Michael, but a crash along the way awakens him, and he kills the paramedic with a shard of glass. But, we see along the way, Laurie getting a imediate surgery, and put in a hospital bed. While finding the nurse, we see her walk out of a room and her chest is bloody, screaming and Laurie trying to run, we see Michael walk out of the room, and stab the nurse to death. Laurie, outisde, goes and hides in the gate keepers office type of thing, and he is killed with a random Ax that Michael has found, Michael knows that Laurie is in the small building because none of the windows are open, so busting down the wall, getting ready to kill her, Laurie wakes up from a serious nightmare.

We see the next day, a hooded Michael, and his mom's ghost, staring at a billboard of him as a child. So, the mission is confirmed by ""Mom"", and Michael sets out to find Laurie, killing people such as two trucker's and there daughter along the way, and a owner of a strip bar, his friend, and a stripper, which rips part of his mask off. But, while this is happening, Laurie start's to have horrific hallucinations, seeing Deborah, and a Clown-Faced Michael. Later in the movie, Laurie see's in a book with her friend's, that she is Angle Myers, Michael's long removed sister. Once she find's this out, getting drunk to forget about it, she and her friends Mya and Harley decide to go to a halloween party. But, before Harley is about to get boned by some random dude she met, he's killed by Michael while taking a wiz, and seconds later, Harley is choked to death. Going to the Brackett house, where Annie closes her drug cabnet and see's Michael's reflection. He chases her and stab's her repatedly and carves her, spewing blood everywhere. ""Angle"", and Mya come to Annie's aid when they find her, but she dies in Laurie's lap. Seconds later, you see Michael smashing the door to peices after killing Mya who was on the phone with paramedics. Laurie escapes the house, and pulls over a driver, who of course is killed a couple of seconds later. But michael takes Angle and takes her to a abandon shed. Where her imagination takes over her and a young Michael is holding her down, getting to say ""I love you mommy"". But then, Dr. Loomis comes into the shed, and is screaming and yelling at Laurie that nothing is holding her down. But, Deborah tell's Michael, ""Time to go home,"", and Michael stab's and carves Loomis.

Michael doesn't relize that he is in front of a window, and is shot in the arm. Once falling into the sharp equipment. Angle stab's him repeatedly and then takes his mask, and walks outside with it. The movie end's with Laurie being stranded in a all white psychiatric ward.

There were deleted scense that just ruined the movie. But, there was a alternate ending, when attacking Loomis, Michael unmask's and is shot to death, and Laurie comes out and has picked up Michael's knife, and then is shot to death.

So, overall this movie blow's, and just ruined the whole concept of Halloween. But, they are making a new Halloween movie which will not be directed by Zombie.

3066558,4,B0011G6FDI,"Once there was a movie named Halloween... Then there was a sequel called Halloween 2. 20something years later, a man named Rob Zombie decided to remake one of his favorite movies (Halloween) to give the series a much needed hand in getting back to what it was all about. No busta rhymes... no ""mark of thorn""... no man in black... just the basics. He stayed fairly true to Carpenter's original vision, while taking some liberties, exploring, and coming up with his own. Then the decision was made for him to finish his story. So he penned and helmed a SEQUEL. Rob Zombie has only remade one movie so far in his career, the aforementioned Halloween. This movie is his own thing. Sure it shares a title with a movie called Halloween II, but the reason people don't get it is because it is not a remake. These days, everything has to be a remake for people to understand it. I have been a huge Halloween fan for years, and to say this is the best one is simply not true. It is a good movie though. If you like originality and gritty b-movie style film making, then this is a must see... if you hold on to the notion of a remake, stay away from this because you won't understand. I wish more horror movies were done this way. And i love the fresh air Mr. Zombie has breathed into the series. My only hopes is they don't destroy it again whenever they get around to the once-rushed-now-sitting-on-the-shelf halloween 3D. hmm... A Michael Myers involved Halloween 3? that's going to make alot of people angry... because the original Halloween 3 didn't have myers. hmm... point proven. This is not a remake.

I understood all the dialogue, what was going on psychologically within each of the characters, and sincerely felt Laurie's rage and agony.  It all made complete sense to me.  But once again...

He's a real human being with real, uncontrollable rage burning inside of him... which to me is scarier than some ""masked monster.""  This should've already been expected after watching the original, as Zombie dwelved into Michael's psych from his childhood.

3066562,4,B0011G6FDI,"I've always rooted for the underdog movies, movies that very few people like or are victims of popular misconceptions (RoboCop 2, Hudson Hawk, Waterworld). But never in my life have I known a film to be on the receiving end of so much anger and undeserved hate than Rob Zombie's Halloween II.

Zombie didn't want to do the movie. He'd killed off Michael and that was that. But the studio went ahead with a sequel regardless, and he figured that if a sequel was going to be made then he should be the one calling the shots instead of someone else who might deviate from his vision.

Many were furious over his desecration of John Carpenter's original. I wasn't. I thought it was entertaining...but pointless. Zombie (and the makers of all the original sequels) just didn't grasp the fact that the minimalism and purity of the 1978 movie is what made it stand out. Copious amounts of back-story did nothing but bore me to death.

But the 1981 Halloween II was hardly sacred ground. Though it took place on the same night as the first the series had already degenerated into pure drudgery and sank even further from there. Zombie's Halloween II pays homage with the first 10 minutes but goes off into a brand new tangent following his own imagination.

His huge liberties with the Michael Myers mythology and rules may have offended fans, but after 31 years of keeping him in the dark it was time to bring the brutal ugliness into the light. This is hardcore slasher material. Compared to this the 80s and 90s sequels are PG family films. Violence and death in real life are not pretty, cool to look at, or bloodless. I'm sick of slasher films that are so clean and sterilized that they make murder look hygienic and harmless. What kind of message is THAT sending out?

Zombie has delivered, without a doubt, the most visually striking Halloween film yet. I wasn't too impressed with his editing or cinematography style in the 2007 movie. Carpenter shot his film in anamorphic Panavision and stuck with the format ever since. But Zombie opted for ugly Super 35, which gave his film-making style a garish, MTV feel. This time around he shoots in grainy 16mm and keeps the camera right in front of the carnage, keeping it in our faces. He also grinds raw, emotional performances out of his cast, especially Scout Taylor-Compton and Brad Dourif.

The hate, the anger, the condemnation...it's all completely unjustified. None of the original sequels were this bold, daring or imaginative. When it comes to drawn out franchises (especially horror films) there are frequent complaints of ""same old, same old"". But as soon as a sequel that DOES break the mold comes across it's torn apart for being too different.

It's our inability to make up our minds over what we really want in movies that pushes studios into making so much inoffensive garbage. Honestly, if you're the kind of person who likes Twilight then you really have no business watching this film.

The Blu Ray features the 119-minute Director's Cut of the film which several added scenes and a completely different ending. It's a much stronger film than the theatrical cut (which was still good) and if you're going to buy Halloween II it's best to buy this version. The 1080p picture is framed at 1.85:1 and is very grainy, but since this is the way the film was intended to look you can't blame it for not looking like Pixar. The sound design is loud and aggressive and there is a decent amount of extras.",1288569600,5,3462,4.691927512355848
3066563,3,B0011G6FDI,"You know, I often ask myself why I keep watching ""re-imaginings"", as much as I typically don't like them. I guess it's that horror-fan philosophy that you have to watch a lot of crap for those rare diamonds that sometimes filter through. I am not a fan of remakes...but I do run across one occasionally that takes me down a new path or makes me think of old faves in a way that I didn't before...and I'm thankful for those bright spots.

Rob Zombie's ""Halloween 2"" took me down an unfamiliar path all right, but instead of finding new thoughts or wrinkles, I instead wound up lost and disappointed.

That said, I realize that there's a whole new generation of horror fans that DIDN'T grow up watching what I consider classics, and for that reason they see these ""imaginings"" with fresh eyes and minds grown in a different time...so I'm going to try to give my opinion of this film bearing those facts in mind, and be objective and honest.

No promises except for the honesty, though.

Trying to maintain my policy of staying spoiler-free, I can only say that I neither felt I knew (since these are time-honored roles) nor cared about any character in this film other than Annie Brackett, her father the sheriff, and the father of Lynda at a book-signing scene.  Everyone else depicted was rather loathsome, morally-decrepit, and just plain sickening.  Sure, there was the occasional 'voice-of-reason' amidst the entropic nihilism, but overall every person is a deplorable example of humanity, at least the way my old-fashioned senses like to think it is.

Be advised, the following COULD give some things away...impossible to review this without pointing some things out:

Would it have been wrong to have a real hero in this film?  Are the original concepts of Dr. Loomis and Laurie Strode so outdated as it's important for us to see them as respectively a greedy, morally-ambiguous opportunist or a prescription drug addled, foul-mouthed, semi-goth burnout?

Maybe so.  The possibility exists that I just don't get it.

I can understand the illustration of how her experiences might have royally screwed Laurie up psychologically...I can take that.  I can see the realism depicted in Loomis...but sometimes, I think what a lot of us like in a horror film is to see good actually standing up to evil...at least in the ""Halloween"" mythology.  I've read the theory that this whole film is merely a psychotic delusion of Laurie as she sits institutionalized after her experience...that would explain much, although this is never really clear...it would at least give us a reason as to how Michael took a magnum round to the face from a foot away and survived...but overall the depiction, whether this theory is true or not, is confusing on the screen.

Perhaps Zombie wants to show the world as full of amoral, misanthropic, low-life rednecks who can't see beyond the end of their noses, and have only the f-bomb and a short assortment of nouns in their vocabularies...maybe he is trying to get us to recognize this; that the real horror is US...but for me, give me SOME light in the darkness, even if it loses in the end.  For me to have found some merit in his original crack at the ""Halloween"" story, Rob has really left me scratching my head over this defeatist and hopeless flick.

As for the film itself, taking out the thematic elements, it was well done.  The cinematography was excellent, the imagery and editing was otherworldly and fearsome in it's presentation, and the acting, for the material they had to work with, was very good.  Brad Dourif was emotional and excellent, Malcolm MacDowell was his usual pristine self, and Danielle Harris was wonderful.  It was also good to see some old favorites on the screen again...Margot Kidder and Caroline Williams, albeit in small parts, as well as a plethora of familiar character actors.  The special effects were brutal and raw, and hat's off to the artists who created them.

I can't really say I didn't like the movie; it had all of the things that I've mentioned that to me make a good film; I guess since it treads so heavily on a mythos I'm a huge fan of, I'm just not willing to buy into the bleak view it reflects as to how times have changed.

Had this been a stand-alone, original film, I'm sure I would have thought more highly of it; but riding the coattails of what is horror-movie legend, this revisionist take just left me feeling depressed.

2.5 stars for the imagery and acting skill shown.",1287792000,2,4464,4.7525906735751295
3066564,1,B0011G6FDI,"I absolutely loved Zombie's remake of Halloween, it is one of my favorite movies. That being said I'm here to review halloween II, which was nothing at all like the first one.

1. Michael Meyers doesn't wear a mask for about 75% of the movie, and looks dirty and disgusting. Everyone in this movie was dirty, like characters in the other R Zombie films.

2. Dream sequences-about 50% of the movie is dream sequences and useless ones. Not only are there dream sequences, but then out of the blue they'll show Michael's mom and little michael just standing in a hallway.....what purpose that serves? Couldn't tell you. Also some of these weirdo sequences take place in a dirty carnival looking enviornment just like the other R Zombie films. The white horse made no sense as well.

3. Michael Meyers eats animals......a dog specifically. I've heard that in the original Halloween II, he did eat a dog as well, but it was more subtle. Also I hear he did eat a guy in the bathroom, which wouldn't surprise me, but I must have missed that part. (and i refuse to watch this movie again)

4. Laurie Strode-what to say about her? She was screaming so much in this movie before Michael even chased her down. All she did was scream obscenities the entire film, also she looked dirty and smelly as well. And she has turned into a whiny freak, granted if i went through what she did, i probably would be too, but wow. Just shows how much Zombie is changing the original characters.

5. They used a different child actor to play little Michael....why? It couldn't have been more that two years, i'm sure the kid from halloween wasn't that old yet, and he was much creepier than the cutie in this movie.

6. Sam Loomis is like a totally different character altogether. Arrogant, sarcastic, and cared about no one but himself. Completely unlikeable.

7. No plotline whatsoever, i realize its halloween and michael meyers comes back to kill on halloween. But all it is, is a bunch of scenes that were just thrown together that really make very little sense. The first 30 minutes was the best of the movie.

To summarize-This movie was def along the lines of Devil's Rejects 2 and House of 1000 Corpses, which by no means are bad movies. But all Zombie did was steal the name Halloween and paste it on this creation. If it was labeled something else, it may have actually been a pretty decent movie. But,it deviated so far from the Halloween concept, Everyone looked like a dirty disgusting carnival freak, weird scenes and dream sequences that didn't fit in anywhere, characters that do not fit in with the originals, and the movie was absolutely nothing close to the first masterpiece that R Zombie created. Couldn't wait for Michael to kill everyone and end the movie. The ending was somewhat interesting but not worth sitting through an hour and half of garbage.",1287705600,3,2849,4.650099403578529
3066565,2,B0011G6FDI,"Let me start by saying I loved the originals (first two).  I think they are the best horror movies ever made.  Now Rob's remake of the first Halloween was pretty good. Much, much different then the orignal but was still a good movie.  Rob made Myers more human and more savage.

Now to the remake of the second Halloween.  Well I truly do not know where to begin. Well let start with the good points.

1) The voilence- it is truly stepped up a notch here.  Not gore but the violence. It
  really seemed to fit this Myers.  He is no longer this
  boogieman type character but a sadistic brutal killer.

2) Myers - Though I still like the original better this one is still great.  He's
  different.  Most will either love him or hate him not to many in the
  middle.

3) Dreams - We got to see what was driving Myers, what was going on in his head.

Now what was bad

1)Dr. Loomis -  Man does this Loomis really suck.  I mean the original really  helped make the movies. With out him the movie would have weakened greatly.  This Loomis nearly destroy's the movie.

2) Dreams - I can't really go into this to much without giving some things up but lets just say there to many of them and they should have been limited to Myers.

All in all I would like to have given 2 1/2 stars.  I think it would not be out of the question to give it a 3 star but that would be stretching it.  If Rob would just have had a better Loomis this movie would have been soooo much better.",1287446400,,1464,4.106761565836299

3066583,4,B0011G6FDI,"I've read elsewhere on the web that a lot of people have major problems with overall shoe string budget quality feel of director Rob Zombie's 2009 remake of Halloween 2. And also from that the overall picture failed in conveying a particular engaging story. I completely disagree or and in fact have to say that those low level aesthetics and shooting on the fly is what makes this film such a rich experience and a strong standout from the heard of remakes that we keep seeing year to year. I feel that Zombie has a very firm grasp on the release of dread and a control of the character development while still moving the story along in broad strokes. Most telling is the pizza dinner scene where Sheriff Brackett , Laurie, and Annie try to share a normal and calm makeshift family dinner before Laurie erupts into an ill timed emotional outburst that just drips with the looming dread that just lurks around the corner. But mainly the first 20 or so minutes with Laurie evading a grizzly murder via a now bearded almost more human Michel Myers in a dreary grey hospital just pumps with anxious momentum that thrives on a less is more approach. I wasn't going in to this a Rob Zombie fan but I left with the enjoyment of experiencing a hyper stylish, cool, blood drenched slasher epic. Plus the soundtrack and dream sequences work pretty well. I mean its cool so whatever....",1283990400,2,1376,4.574898785425101
3066584,1,B0011G6FDI,"This movie was a complete waste of time.  I wonder if its possible to sue Rob Zombie for the time wasted in watching this movie.  I am a huge fan of the original Halloween series (minus part three).  I also enjoyed Rob Zombie's first remake.  However, this was a futile effort in filmmaking.  Allow me to elaborate for a moment.

First of all, the picture quality stinks.  When viewing this dismal excuse of a movie you cannot even see the gory picture scenes.  Ok, I admit I am a little demented but the main reason to see a horror movie is actually see people being butchered by some maniacal psychopathic killer.  In this remake it is impossible to see the events of the death scenes because the producer failed to sufficiently light the scenes.

Secondly the acting was reminiscent of a William Shatner death scene.  Over the top and not at all believable.  It almost seemed as if they gathered a bunch of kids of the street and told them to act in a movie.  Were there no actual auditions? Or is it that the filmmakers have no eye for talent?

Finally the character development merely didn't exist.  We never got to know let alone relate to Lori Strode (the main female character).  The Dr. Loomis character was a joke.  In the original series Donald Pleasance portrayed him as the silent mentor type (or not so silent), with a passion for hunting down his arch nemesis.  His passion and fear in hunting down Michael Meyers was akin to that of Captain Ahab hunting his great white whale.  In this remake, Dr. Loomis is a bitter creation of a narcissistic society.  Whereas in the first series the Loomis character was a bastion of good, this new Loomis is almost as evil as Michael Meyers just in a different way.

Needless to say I only gave this movie a rating of one because there isn't a lower rating to give on Amazon.  Save your money and buy one of the following horror movies:  The original Halloween series, Nightmare on Elm Street, Friday the 13th, Hellraiser, or Camp Sleepaway.",1283817600,7,1994,4.53932584269663

Then Michael goes threw his killing spree, and trying to find his little sister. This movie got lots of gruesome detail murder scene, which would make any horror fan happy.

  Laurie Strode (Scout Taylor-Compton) is walking down the street in shock after shooting Michael Myers. Sheriff Brackett (Brad Dourif) stops his car to comfort her. She is taken to the hospital and is in extreme pain and hysteria.
  The body of Michael Myers is put in a Coroner's vehicle. On the road, the vehicle stops suddenly as it hits a cow. Michael, alive, busts out of the back doors and kills the passenger.
  Michael quickly finds his sister in the hospital and terrorizes her again.
  Suddenly, Laurie wakes up and it is 2 years later (unrated version).  Her nightmares are getting worse as Halloween approaches. Laurie believes she killed Michael.  She is living with Sheriff Brackett and Annie (Danielle Harris) who has also survived her ordeal with Michael.
  Laurie visits her therapist (Margot Kidder).
  Dr. Sam Loomis (Malcolm McDowell) has also survived his terror of Michael, his former patient, and is now on tour doing seminars and book signings about his new book on Michael Myers. Not everyone is happy with his tell-all book.
  He believes Michael is dead as well, however his body was never found.
  We see that Michael is still alive and is on his way to Haddonfield.
  Laurie's dreams are becoming too gruesome and bothersome. She is schizophrenic and hallucinates.  She really has it out with her therapist.
  The more that Michael nears Haddonfield, the worst Laurie becomes.

This sequal wasn't anything like it, all the way down to the different child actor playing the role of young Mike Myers.  I didn't understand why it seemed so important to portray his visions of his mother as some sort of white knight that he followed, it just seemed so unnecessary yet you could tell Rob Zombie did everything he could to introduce this into the film.

I really hope he doesnt continue making these Halloween films, or I at least hope he goes back to what made the first one so fantastic.  I was warned, I read the reviews and everyone told me the second was not as good.  However, Im a horror fan and I can usually find entertainment in any horror flick, just not this one.

3066601,3,B0011G6FDI,"The Amazonites have spoken and this movie got killed, lambasted by some as 'the worst Halloween movie', though there's no way it can approach the horror of the botched Curse or the Busta-Rhymes-was-the-best-part Resurrection.

I'm still not sure why this was given an August '09 release rather than...October/Halloween.  Presumably, they didn't want to run up against the latest Saw offering, and perhaps they sensed the buzz of Paranormal Activity.  Instead, they ran it against The Final Destination 3D, which still fared better.

Folks seem to love or hate the Rob Zombie Halloween excursions.  Say this about Zombie...he is a horror movie fan and he tries something more personal this time around.  Yes, we all know and (presumably) love the original Halloween II, where Michael Myers stalks Laurie in the eerily empty corridors of Haddonfield Memorial Hospital.  And yes, we all know that it was revealed that Laurie was, in fact, Michael's sister, a plot twist conceived by John Carpenter when he ran out of ideas.  So what should we expect when someone remakes 're-boots' or jump-starts a series and then remakes the sequel, too?

Yes, there are similar elements and plot points from earlier Halloween films, including the original Part II (the hospital, the sister angle, which we knew from the first Zombie installment, etc).  But this is not a remake of the original Part II.  Rob Zombie is going his own way with the blessing of the Akkad clan, and I think he does some interesting things story and plot-wise.  There are clearly some expressionistic nods to Italian horror directors (Bava, Argento), and there's a strong nod to the effects of post-traumatic stress disorder and general insanity after you've been chased by a knife-wielding lunatic.  The early scenes---again, picking up right after the events of the original---are well done, if unsettling.  There's the frenetic activity of the paramedics and authorities, the hospital atmosphere, the loving close-ups of emergency surgery and various injuries, and the spooky recurrence of The Moody Blues on TV.  There's a very nightmarish feel to everything and the looks and sounds are appropriately unsettling.  There's a focus on the trauma---the screaming! the terror!  The film is much more concerned with the idea that this Laurie Strode is losing her marbles, and is hardly the wholesome and pure Laurie of the previous series.  Zombie prefers some of the more disturbing elements of the material over the 'scary ones'...which in his world are nearly one and the same.  There is always the risk of wallowing in the downbeat versus showing that the filmmakers actually had any fun making this.  I think they did, but Halloween II definitely toes the line.

Like most horror flicks, this is not the sum of its parts, but I always give points for atmosphere and demented touches.  Actually, the weakest part of the film is the stalking and slasher action itself.  It is predictable, methodical, absolutely brutal, and dare I say...sometimes boring.  Michael stabs...and stabs...and stabs...and then stabs again...and again...and again.  We get it.  Am curious what they cut, because it's a hard R rating here.  No, Mr. Zombie does not ease up on the slasher gore, and we get at least one close-up of a knife in the head.

The better elements are the psychological angles (exploring...well, insanity), and the Loomis plotline.  This is not the same Loomis, tireless in his effort to stop evil on two feet, but rather a burnt out, cynical, media-obsessed sellout who may or may not have an ounce of altruism left in his shell.  Again, Malcolm MacDowell is excellent if underused this time.  There's also a bit of plot-timeline fudging toward the end during the 'final showdown'.

The movie is demented, and extremely violent and brutal...perhaps too much in that it distracts from the fresh or different elements that Zombie tries to infuse.  I still liked this better than most of the rent-a-hack horror output that comes along.  Give credit to a horror fan making horror films and trying something else.  Of course, you can't win in this genre.  You will be condemned if you make the same old movie (which people want to see) or you'll be condemned if you try something out of left field (because people want something fresh).  If you want the old Part II, go watch it, it's a different film.  But lordy, this is a heck of a lot better than the latter stages of the original Halloween series.

The DVD looks and sounds great.  I believe Zombie shot this on 16mm and converted it, so the images look grainier and darker...it's a very stark and appropriate look for this film.  The extras include a plethora of deleted scenes, most not essential but some interesting bits, plus the inevitable alternate ending.  Note that the ending here differs slightly from from what you saw in the theater (if you were such a fanatic), since this is the 'director's cut'.",1280102400,46,4925,4.970660146699267

I hope these remakes end now unless they can do better and they pick up making a sequal to resurrection which was also better than the Zombie directed Halloween films.

Rob Zombie's Halloween II has stupid characters (whom you wouldn't mind if they all died with the exception of Sheriff Brackett and Lori's poor friend Mya).  The dialogue is redundant and unintelligible.  You're left with wanting more plot.  A waste of time.  I was expecting more from Rob Zombie than something as dumb and blunt as this movie.  That's it.

Never ever in life have I came close to walking out of a movie, but between this & The Spirit my will power was tested. 1st what makes Michael Myers who he is IS THE MASK but for some reason the director didn't feel like he needed the mask. For most of the movie Michael is without the mask & jump suit (this time he wears a thousand hot a** jackets) & he grunts so much you start to think that at one point he's just going to flat out start talking. The kill's in this movie are way over the top to the point where you just start thinking to yourself are they serious. The sister he's after is 10x more annoying in this one than the last one, Dr. Loomis doesn't care about trying to stop Michael anymore he just cares about selling his book, for some reason there is a white horse that pop's up whenever the mom does & yeah he eats a dog...im so serious",1278720000,8,898,4.022346368715084
3066626,1,B0011G6FDI,"This is truly the worst film I've seen in many many years. A lot of people have a problem with Rob Zombie drastically changing the core story, and the characters personalities. Actually, I can live with that. A remake, in essence, should be a re-telling, with personal touches by the writer/director. After all, a shot for shot remake doesn't work, remember the god-awful Gus VanSant remake of Psycho??? Having said that, however, this movie just does not work. The Laurie Strode character is so annoying, you will pray for her death. I know I did. The Loomis character is now a media and money hungry parasite, who profits from the tragedy of the first movie. While detestable, this is at least a somewhat realistic possibility. The gore is extreme, to say the least. Personally, I found this the only aspect of the film worth watching. The visions???? The dreams????? I have no idea which is which, and what Zombie was trying to do. This is one big muddles mess of a movie. The biggest flaw, and I mean major flaw, is there is NOT ONE character who is sympathetic. You will not care one iota about any of these people. I rooted all the way for Michael Myers. I wanted him to kill every whining, obnnoxious, human being in this film. He almost did. I really don't know what to say about this movie. It just sucks. And Sheri Moon Zombie?? Gimme a freakin break. This skank couldn't act her way out of a paper bag. From the first moment I saw her in House Of 1000 Corpses, I hated her. There's a reason that the only movies she's in are her husbands. In closing, I would just give a word of advice to Rob Zombie. Go back to music and leave films for people with talent.",1278547200,16,1668,4.436482084690554

I mean you are all rating this movie like it is the most horrible movie you have ever seen, and it is not that bad at all. Obviously, Laurie is going to be very depressed and not the girl she was in the first, because she is severely tramatized and messed up because of all of this. So reviewers need to get over that right away. Dr. Loomis becomes a jerk, because he wants to make money off of others tragedies with his book. Who doesn't do that in Hollywood? As far as the kiiling scenes, they were nothing different than first. They had the same amout of severe gore and length as the first. Michael Myers was just as ruthless and frightening as the first doing nothing out of the ordinary from the first film. So all in all, not a bad movie at all. It will never compare to the first, but is not by far horrible in any way. You will either love it or hate it. See it for yourself and form your own opinion.

This is exactly what we get, but for the Manson/metal/666 crowd.  Evidently, the director's lifestyle influence is showing just a tad too much in this one.  Honestly, I actually enjoyed the first somewhat, but this follow-up is more concerned about turning one of the most truly iconic slasher killers into a long-haired, unshavened biker on some ridiculous walk-about quest to find/kill his sister.  This movie should not carry the Halloween name -- it's strictly a ""Devil's Reject"" spin-off.

Speaking of which, it's been awhile since I've wanted the lead actress killed off.  Usually you sympathize with their plight pull for them to survive.  It's unheard of when you care more for the secondary characters like the sheriff and his daughter than you do the leads.  Unfortunately, in this era all it takes are whines, shrills and F-bombs with attitude to make the cut.

Honestly, watch the movie if you're looking for something more similiar to ""Devil's Reject"".  If you want to get your Halloween fix, save your money and time and watch the originals.",1275868800,7,1183,4.959390862944162

3066632,4,B0011G6FDI,"I finally watched Rob Zombie's HALLOWEEN 2, and I must say that I didn't see the total disaster I was expecting. I'd heard all the arguments about how awful it was, including Zombie's ""white trash"" take on the classic 80s sequel. I'd also heard about Scout Taylor-Compton doing a terrible job as Laurie Strode, and her ""foul mouth"", ""whining"", and ""hysterical"" performance. Well, Zombie's version is different, but hardly as bad as it was made out to be! Michael Myers (Tyler Mane)is still the unstoppable killing machine we remember. Yes, he does take off the mask, and he does sport a raggedy beard. So what? I'd read how he looked ""homeless"", like a ""hobo"" Michael. I expected a real clown! Instead, he's even fiercer than he was in RZ's first HALLOWEEN! People complained that he ""grunted"" when he killed his victims. Again, so what? Mane is imposing and terrifying here, especially when he dispatches those hillbillies on the farm! Oh my! The only complaint I can agree w/ is the heavy-handed use of the horse imagery. Oh yeah, and Sheri Moon Zombie could have been used more sparingly! We get it already!

3066644,1,B0011G6FDI,"I was an extra in this movie, and even on the set I knew it was going to be a disaster....what I was unprepared for was the level of disaster that they took it to.

I have no problem with language or violence, but I do have a problem with it when there is no good reason. The script sounds like it was written by a middle schooler (honestly, who uses THAT many F bombs in regular conversation?). And the violence, while somewhat expected, went WAY over the top as far as simply telling the story. On the plus side, whoever did the makeup effects for this movie has one heck of a demo reel to show off now.

I'll agree that casting Maclolm McDowell as Dr. Loomis was a good move...it would have been even better if they had made him even remotely likable. Same goes for virtually any of the characters in H2.

Oh, memo to those who griped about Michael grunting....he grunted in Carpenter's original as well...just check out the scene where he strangles Lynda, or when he's breaking into the closet, or choking Laurie.

And of course they had to go the whole ""oh-my-God-she's-his-SISTER!"" route, which was stupid in the first HALLOWEEN 2 and is even more so this time around. John Carpenter came up with the idea in 1981 and even he admits it was a dumb one. Michael Myers is far more terrifying as simply the ""boogeyman"".....anybody could be his victim, nobody is safe. With this lame subplot, as long as you aren't related to him or between him and a relative, you're safe! Maybe it's nostalgia for the ""good old days"", but I think I'll avoid any of Mr. Zombie's future HALLOWEEN efforts and simply stick with Carpenter's classic....the unequaled original.....",1272672000,12,1661,4.563758389261745

3066649,1,B0011G6FDI,"Every once in a while a movie or a cd comes a long that I feel people should be warned about. This movie is definitely one of those. Being a true fan of what I call ""the trifecta of classic horror movie villians"" which of course means Freddy Krugar, Jason Voorhees, and Michael Myers, I was amazed at how well Rob Zombie remade the first Halloween movie. It showed Michael become the evil being that we all know and love. It gave us a new look into his past which was previously only partially revealed. Most of all it stuck close enough to the original Halloween while making subtle changes to delight old fans and enlighten new ones at the same time. Bravo Rob Zombie! Bravo!

Now..........Halloween 2. WHAT THE F&%$ HAPPENED? I swear Rob Zombie must have been asleep in the chair through most of this. It starts out just like the original Halloween 2. Laurie is in the hospital after being attacked and Michael comes for her leaving a bloody mess of bodies in the process. Beautiful. As im watching Im thanking god that Rob Zombie is remaking this classic. Then BAM! 30 minutes into the movie Laurie wakes up and whats this? It was all a dream? NOOOOOOOO! Then you get to sit through the next 90 minutes watching as Michael Myers keeps seeing visions of white horses and his dead mother? They take a killer with no motive and turn him into a mamas boy on an acid trip? I swear I will kick Rob Zombie in the nuts if I ever see him for ruining what should have been such an easy remake. I saw this in the theater when it first came out and about an hour into the movie I wanted to walk out. The only thing that kept me there was the hope that it would eventually get better. It never did. In fact.......the last scene is so stupid and juvenile you wonder if your even still watching a Halloween movie. DONT YOU EVER MAKE ANOTHER MOVIE AS LONG AS YOU LIVE ROB ZOMBIE!

I honestly don't know what he thinks a good horror movie should be, but this is not it. It was not enjoyable to watch at all. The scene at the Dance/Concert was pretty good, but it was the only thing that felt reminiscent of the older films. If he's trying to be gritty a groundbreaking... do it with your own characters! Don't ruin a classic beloved horror series, to make yourself feel all accomplished creatively!!! I was really let down by this. I'd even rather watch the one with Tyra Banks in it, than this mess! If the studios decide to go forward with new entries (wich I hope they do, because Zombie should NOT have the last word on this franchise!!!) I would hope they would push forward with a fresh new direction ignoring Rob Zombie's lack of caring. He really did not know his audience on this one, and I'm pretty sure he does not care.

Reviews have been saying how this movie sucked but it didn't they only saw it once, this movie is more complicated and deeper than you would think. But seriously watch this film again but make sure it's the unrated director's cut.

I really like the way Rob Zombie made the characters change from the first Halloween remake to this movie. Rob Zombie really opened up the dark side of Laurie Strode because it's a more realistic movie and I have to give Scout Taylor Compton some props for playing the part so well. I also have to congradulate Dr. Loomis played by Malcolm McDowell and sheriff Brackett played by Brad Douraf they both did an amazing job with there characters.

The only problems I had with this film is 1.

If u want to see a more in depth depressing yet more understanding version see the unrated, if you want a more typical version watch the r rated. Both are great, great acting and directing anyone who knocks this film dosent appreciate good film making.

I didn't mind the fact that he grunts when he kills people and that he sometimes doesn't have his mask on (which other reviewers commented on). After reading all the negative reviews I thought it would be rubbish but I was pleasantly surprised. With the grunting and the dream sequences and the apparations of young Michael and his mum Rob has tried to change the formula a bit which after this many installments was necessary.
I did however find Laurie a tad annoying making her hard to care about and it would have been better if they got the kid who played young Michael back in it. The most glaring fault with the movie is that its supposed to be set one year after the first therefore 1981, so why did Dr Loomis have a LCD TV in his hotel room and why were they talking about Mike Myers of Austin Powers fame? Maybe Rob forgot and thought it was 2009.

This movie takes itself TOO seriously and is a little too deep for a slasher flick.
It bounced around and made the mistake the previous sequels made by having useless character(ghost mom/ ghost younger Michael) constantly show up.
What made the first two(originals) successful was the suspenseful build up and climactic battles in the end.
This jumped all over the place, too many random scenes and no one to cheer on to fight Michael.
I didn't have much faith in this one.
My personal thoughts are that Michael truly died in the first ""Halloween II"" which is a MUCH more superior slasher than this garbage.
Rob Zombie needs to go back to making music videos. Leave the slasher flicks to the professionals.

3066688,2,B0011G6FDI,"I find that as a filmmaker Rob Zombie has been struggling to find his voice.  House of 1000 Corpses marked his transition from a music video director to a narrative storyteller and suffered from lack of story and an over abundance of random imagery thrown in for shock value.

Devil's Rejects was a much more clearly defined narrative effort that borrowed heavily from his favorite movies.  Basically, he was now retelling someone else's story while developing through his own eyes.  Though a tad too brutal for my liking.

I think that he was put in a tough spot on Halloween.  Let's be honest: there was no way he could win this one.  It seemed to me that he had nailed his visual style and his work with actors had definitely improved, but now he had to contend with an existing mythos that dictate his story.  I wonder what this would have been like had he not been compelled to show the origin of the mask and whatnot.  This movie almost worked for me; it just felt like he was still holding back or being forced to color in between the lines a bit too much.

Here there be spoilers.

That being said, I really want to like Halloween II, if at least for some of the risks it takes.  I love the idea of Laurie dealing with the trauma and I thought that the writing and performance of her character were spot on.  This seriously could have been a movie about her life after the massacre without Meyers ever returning and I would have like it.  The same goes for Dr. Loomis.  I love the direction his character goes in-- except he doesn't really have a character arc or any reason for being in this movie.  The scene with Weird Al is genius.  But none of this really matters.  I even like crazy homeless guy Micheal.  What I didn't like what the stupid white horse/ghost mom hallucinations that follow him around.  That alone killed this movie for me.  Why can't he just be a psychotic killer?

The problem with the sequel is the same problem that affects 99% of all sequels.  Instead of following the story to where it would logically want to go, sequels are forced to bring back all the main players to basically relive the events of the first film.  There's no room for character growth.  There's no room for them to exist outside of what happened in the first film.  The possibilities for a sequel are endless, but often overlooked.  How would this play out if Michael were at-large and killing in other towns but never returned to Haddonfield?  How would that affect Laurie?  or Dr. Loomis?  I don't know, I'm probably the only person who would want to see a movie like that, but my point is that Zombie got SO CLOSE to telling an interesting story all his own and then caved during the last half and let it devolve into the same crap that we always see.  Better luck next time.

Oh, and the white horse is still totally stupid.",1266883200,3,2835,4.423597678916828

There is no way that the director's cut could be anything but the boring garbage that film is, unless they put a completely
different dvd in the box.
It was dull, boring, coma-inducing... I could go on.  What was the point of this film?  Watching Michael Myers wander around,
occasionally killing someone in cut-away scenes so dark, I couldn't figure out how they died.  Hey, maybe THEY watched this film, too.
At any rate, its Halloween. and Michael is killing a fresh young cast of amazingly horrible actors.  (I'm leaving the veteran
cast alone.  They looked like they'd been tortued enough.)  That's all there is to it.  I don't think they had a budget for subplots and symbolism.
I don't know what else to say.  They released this film twice into theaters.  It was the wrong way to recycle the celluloid.  My condolences to those 10 people who shelled out their hard-earned money and leisure time.",1266537600,4,1018,4.721590909090909
3066703,4,B0011G6FDI,"I was immediately open to Rob Zombie's Halloween and generally liked it basically because it was different. It wasn't a shot-for-shot remake, but it was also a bit messy. The first half was certainly very good; Zombie's chronicling of Michael Myers' life stuck in institution was well explored ground and written very well, but then the second half feels like a push-pull between something like Gus Van Sant's shot-for-shot remake of Psycho to Zombie's interpretation of the original material, which is where the first film fell a bit flat. However, with the ""Unrated Director's Cut"" of Halloween II, Zombie goes in a different direction yet again, and it feels like Zombie's finally made Halloween his own.

It's been two years since the psychotic events of October 31st in Haddonfield, Illinois, and Laurie Strode is a mess. She's living with Annie Brackett, who used to be her best friend, but animosity has grown since the Halloween incident. She's having bizarre visions and a revelation in the new tell-all book by Samuel Loomis catapults her into events that will finally bring a close to the Michael Myers' rampage.

From the get-go, this isn't your typical horror film. It doesn't even seem like a horror film. Sure, there are deaths, stabbings, and freaky visions, but it plays out more like a drama that used horror as its basis. It's one of the smartest moves ever made in a horror sequel. Rob Zombie is the thinking horror fan's director, he won't do a retreading of material, he won't rehash ideas, he'll keep going in different directions, and I never cease being interested in what he has to say within his films.

Scout-Taylor Compton provides a fantastic performance as Laurie Strode and really makes Strode her own; the scenes involving Strode and Margot Kidder's psychiatrist are of a particular note, showing Strode spiralling out of control and Kidder's psychiatrist trying to work out how to help this poor girl.

Strode is having psychotic visions, and it is one of these visions that is probably my favourite parts of the film involving lots of profanity, almost silent movie-esque looks and a glass coffin which works very well, it's a scene that has a great impact and is visually pleasing, despite the amount of profanity being thrown at the camera.

Of particular positive notes is the inclusion of home video footage of Danielle Harris as a young Annie Brackett. The Halloween fan will know Harris played Jamie Lloyd, the niece of Michael Myers and daughter of Laurie Strode in Halloween 4: The Return of Michael Myers and Halloween 5: The Revenge of Michael Myers, and there is a poignancy of showing this footage with Harris' history in Haddonfield. It's quite moving actually, which leads me to Brad Dourif.

In the first film, Brad Dourif played Annie's father, Sheriff Brackett, and it wasn't terribly memorable. It was cool as Dourif is the voice of another horror icon, Chucky the Good Guy Doll from the Child's Play films, but other than that, there wasn't anything stand-out about him in Zombie's Halloween. He completely breaks out in Halloween II, showing a father falling to pieces, and bringing such a reality to his character and such sympathy, making Brackett my favourite character in Halloween II, and is probably the best performance Dourif has ever given on screen. It's positively fantastic, and words can't describe how amazing his performance is...you need to see it.

The Blu-Ray disc provides a great picture and sound, loud and threatening, just the way I like it. The image has changed from the cinemascope 2:35:1 of the first film to a normal widescreen image that helps bring across the raw energy the film oozes out of every grainy pore it owns. It's a faithful representation and helps communicate the raw energy of the film well.

Deleted and alternate scenes are included which aren't much to write home to mum about, they provide interesting but unnecessary alternative takes of different scenes. What would have been better is the inclusion of the theatrical cut. Audition footage is provided of some newcomers. While interesting to watch, is there a need for it? Do Rob Zombie/Halloween fans demand audition footage of as-yet-unknown actors? Of note is Chase Vanek, replacing Daeg Faerch as Young Michael Myers due to a growth spurt. Vanek provides a good substitute but didn't seem as gloomy as Faerch was. Make-up test footage is also included, which, too, is interesting, but hardly necessary. A blooper reel is included which probably made me smile once or twice.

There is a fictitious band made for this film named Captain Clegg and the Night Creatures, and about nine minutes of music video is provided, intercutting black-and-white typical ""music video shoot"" footage with the scene in the film with sprinklings of old horror films and cartoons. They're all the same and not my cup of tea.

Unce Seymour Coffin's Stand Up Routines. This guy is also in the club scenes and isn't funny, but does some jokes that may make you smile, but providing unused footage of unfunny stand-up routines for entertainment is redundant. I didn't even make it past one minute of it. The whole joke in the film is that this guy is funny because he isn't funny. Providing 5-10 minutes of unfunny material will keep hitting the nail on the head but eventually bore the hammer into the skull and then eventually into the brain matter, providing a painful experience. My thoughts go out to all who watch this in its entirety.

Finally is the audio commentary from Rob Zombie. Zombie is always great to listen to; he's intelligible and explains certain ideas, cuts, and things become even more clear. He's a great guy and while he does fall into the audio-commentary no-no of describing what is on-screen, he balances that out by explaining the ideas behind the scene or a story behind the scene, which is alright. He's insightful company and worth checking out for Zombie fans.

The disc is highly recommended for Zombie fans and for fans of horror in general. This isn't your typical horror film, not is it your typical Halloween film. But I liked that; it's refreshing and visually outstanding and has some fantastic ideas. I challenge all who saw the theatrical cut and hated it to watch this fantastic, albeit somewhat slow director's cut, and try not to change their minds.

The inclusion of the theatrical cut would have made for some nice analyses, and the inclusion of Captain Clegg music videos and Seymour Coffins' stand up routines are unnecessary waste of precious data space. A faithful reproduction of the image and audio provides the film with a great visceral experience. I could have loved it more, but I loved it more than I expected to.",1266451200,6,6705,4.9073256840247135

XFL, meant to improve on the traditional NFL. Like Vince, Zombie falls flat on his face!

What a total waste of effort(??)! Forget the obviously lame storyline! Zombie has taken the BEST parts of what I & others loved of John Carpenter's masterpiece and has profoundly spat on them, transforming & transposing them away from what made them appealing- Laurie Strode from a straight-lanced, innocently appealing & ultimately doomed heroine who we ended up rooting for to a foul-mouthed, UN-likeable blithering mess. Sam Loomis has been remade from a truly concerned savior, determined to stop his quarry (while being believably terrified of him at the same time)from spreading death & destruction into a greedy, uncaring opportunist. And what a howler THIS Michael Myers is......! Where-as he was a terrifying, shadowy form of living darkness in total control of his actions without expression or remorse in the original, Zombie's version is laughably inept, just another thuggish brute without the cunning or resilience of a true screen villian, led only by his childhood/""inner-self"" visions/images to explain his actions (oh, so T-H-A-T's why he does & is what he is!!!!! I d-i-d-n-'t k-n-o-w THAT!). I'm not sure how much effort was made by Tyler Mane to ""get into character"" but you never really truly believe he's Michael Myers, or at least I didn't. Dick Warlock ('the Shape' in 1981's H2) was more convincing, emerging out of a dark corner with the occasional creepy head tilt while remaining stoic was all that was really needed.

The way I see it, the only real excuse for these re-makes (or are they re-boots???)is a set-up for a future ""Michael vs Jason"" clash!",1266105600,29,1909,5.018927444794953

3066708,1,B0011G6FDI,"When I first heard Rob Zombie was going to direct horror movies, I was intrigued as he stated he was a big fan of 70's and 80's horror films as I am as well. I was hoping that maybe he would bring something creative and fresh to a genre of horror that has pretty much been killed by a lack of new ideas and its own cliches.

Zombies first two films, House of 1000 Corpses and the Devils Rejects weren't exactly good, but they were sorta fun in a there really isn't anything better on TV at the moment sort of way, but neither hinted at a director with a lot of potential. Then Zombie remade Halloween, a somewhat impossible task as there is no way a remake could ever surpass Carpenter's classic. Not surpringly, Halloween was fairly bad. Not terrible, but still, kind of bad. The main problem is that it didn't really add anything new other than trying to explain why Mike Myers became Mike Myers. Today's horror directors seem to think that the key to a remake is to explain why the killer became a killer and Zombie is no exception. But what is lost on these directors is that the lack of explanation is what makes a killer like Michael Myers truly scary. Why did he kill his sister and grow up to be a crazed killer in the original Halloween? Who knows, but the simple answer is that, as one of the little kids in the original stated, he is the boogie man.

So here we are with Halloween 2. I was interested in seeing this as the trailer looked pretty good and I heard that Zombie was not remaking Halloween 2 and therefore this would be his ""vision."" Well, there is no doubt about it now. Zombie has absolutely no vision and no idea how to direct a horror movie. This movie is utter, utter trash. There are no redeeming characters and absolutely no scares. Myers is basically played as a really pissed off redneck. He is much more leatherface than..well, Mike Myers. either way, it's amazing this was not a direct to video release. It is that bad. Avoid at all costs",1266019200,6,1971,4.338753387533876

It also brings back in some elements that were mostly missing from the 2007 remake but were dominant in the original series, including edging Michael Myers back in the direction of being something more than a warped psychopath, something inhuman: it's doubtful, for example, that any mortal human could have survived the ending of the previous movie, let alone come back for more.  There are other glimmers of elements which may or may not be supernatural.  In contrast to these emerging elements, there's a gritty, uncomfortable raw-ness to both the movie and the character that were never present in the earlier entries.  Whereas the original Michael Myers was so utterly unhuman and almost otherworldy - it was part of the ongoing subtext that Michael was really a physical incarnation of the 'boogeyman' - that his longtime psychiatrist Dr. Loomis refered to Michael as 'it' rather than 'he'; the Michael Myers in the current movies is, despite his preternatural strength and resistance to physical injury, at times all too human.  As in the 2007 movie, the question of whether Michael is twisted and insane or just raw evil is answered: he's both.  It's obvious the character's mind is warped, but it's just as obvious that not all the brutality, aggression and sadism of the character can be attributed to a damaged psyche: it's the real Michael.

  We see the world through Michael Myers's eyes in certain scenes - where his dead mother is still present and directing his actions, where Michael's younger self is there and interacts with the older version, and where there's frequently the strange appearance of a white horse, which is said in psychological terms to represent vast amounts of inner rage when seen in a dream or vision.

  Halloween II brings back almost all of the signifigant surviving characters from Halloween 2007 (and some of the dead ones, through visions and flashbacks), which is a welcome factor.  Most of the characters have changed signifigantly in the wake of that movie's events.  Among the most striking changes are those in Laurie Strode (Scout Taylor-Compton), who's psychologically disturbed and whose character continues to darken in her own inner rage as the movie progreses.  Anyone who saw the 2007 movie or is at all familiar with the Halloween mythos knows that Laurie is really Michael Myers's younger sister, and anyone who saw the movies in the original series (especially Parts 4-6) knows that the idea that there might be something 'wrong' not only with Michael but with other members of his bloodline was an evolving plot thread.

  One thing that I found occuring in Halloween II that's occasionally been trotted out in other movies but has Never worked so well as it has here, is the recurring sensation that much of what we're seeing on screen may not be real, but happening in one of the character's heads.  That's usually annoying; here it's frightening.  The idea that it may not be 'real' but may actually be happening simultaneously in More than one of the character's heads is just plain eerie.

  There are other unique factors at work too: it's rare that a movie, including a horror movie, can have so much brutal, gory violence on-screen and yet still leave the door open that there's much Worse happening offscreen.  Unsettling.  Another rarity to movies in general, although director Rob Zombie tends to work this into his own films on a regular basis: the movie will start off seeming to take place in such a nihilistic, ugly world, populated predominantly by unlikable, totally amoral characters.  But then as it progresses, you meet other much more sympathetic characters, or you find yourself warming up to some of the originally unlikable ones (one of the returning characters has changed for the worse, but you find yourself starting to find more redeeming values in him as it goes along).  An example of this dichotomy: in the opening of the movie, an ambulance carrying away the bodies of victims from the first movie has its driver and attendant discussing how much they'd like to have sex with the corpse of one of the female victims.  From the rather nasty, unpleasant tone this little moment sets, you'd never expect elements to crop in like the 'adoption' of Laurie by Sheriff Brackett (Brad Dourif)'s family or the way they continue to try and help her even as she grows more abusive as her personality darkens.  The ties of loyalty and extended family between the survivors are handled with great effect and even tenderness.  Even Laurie, even as she's darkening, has those feelings: she doesn't want to be growing increasingly aggressive, but is losing control of herself.  The way you get to know the characters makes the fates that befall some of them hit like sledgehammers.

  All this talk of the emotional ties and loyalties between characters doesn't mean that this is a tv drama-of-the-week treatment of Halloween.  It's a dark (the darkest in the series), psychologically disturbing, relentless horror movie.  The thing that so many of horror's detractors (who usually don't seem to have actually watched that many of its movies) fail to get is that being a vicious horror movie doesn't preclude any other elements from also being part of the package.

  Halloween II won't sit well with all fans.  It's less of an 'awesome, fun horror thrill ride' than many entries in the slasher-type field; its horrendously brutal, coarse, and disturbs on a very emotional level.  That said, it's just as great as the other kinds of slashers, just in a very different way.  One thing that can inarguably said for the Halloween remakes at this point: they're not just repeating what the original series did so well.  They're really forging their own identity, and it's a very dark, ruthless identity.

This movie has some interesting ideas, and I would have liked it more if it was not affiliated with Halloween. Rob has taken characters which are dear in our hearts, and made them unlikable. I think at this point Rob Zombie has a nice following. He should make movies with his own titles, and characters. This would leave an open mind with the viewer. Otherwise you face the wrath of the fans.

My number one complaint with Robs' Halloween movies is, why is Michael Myers seven feet tall, and have super strength. The allure of the original was that Michael was a normal guy. How come you didn't make his sisters seven feet tall? See what I mean. If these movies had just been made under a different label, there would be no wineing.",1265846400,,883,4.411042944785276

I don't mean that as a compliment.  I had to turn it off because I felt like less of a human being watching it.  No movie is worth that.",1265760000,6,545,4.1826923076923075
3066723,4,B0011G6FDI,"I'm a fan of the Halloween movies. But unfortunately, the last movie I had left the theatres really satisfyed with was Halloween:H20, back in '98. I still think the series should have stopped there, with Jamie Lee Curtis killing Michael.

But they decided to continue. And they made a huge mistake called Halloween: Resurrection. So, the only way to go ""on"" would be to reboot.

And there came Zombie. Now, I like him as a director. He'd done the amazing The Devil's Rejects. I thought Halloween could, maybe, use some of the brutality Rob would surely bring to it. After all, the Michael in Resurrection could not scare a 7-year-old in the dark.

Zombie did a good job with the movie, but there was something off about it. It was like seeing Halloween (78) being violated somehow. I can't help but feel that way. The movie was different, but close enough to the original to make me uncomfortable.

Now H2 is another story. Rob's taken his vision to the next level and we've been offered a whole new interpretation of the story.

I think the overuse of profanity may make everybody a bit uncomfortable (and maybe takes some people off the movie), but, you go past it, and you have a very good story of people dealing with a post-traumatic experience and also, with one another, in the background.

I think this is actually one of the Halloween movies that really invested on characters, and it is heartbreaking to see what they go through.

Michael is more vicious than I have ever seen. he's brutal. merciless. in a word, scary. And it felt great to feel that way.

The end is... interesting. If this is the end of the Halloween movies with these characters in this world, it's fine. Makes us wonder what could happen next. If it's not, I wonder where the story would go... and if Michael would be involved somehow. Is Halloween without MM Halloween?

Rob's Halloween II seemed more centered on the violence aspect and was closer to a ""Torture Porn"" genre than a true ""Slasher"".  Also, there was a lot of just plain weird stuff in it that made it hard to follow.

In the original Halloweens, Michael was an unstoppable force, a demon possessed and we all understood this and accepted it as such so naturally when he was shot at by police or whacked over the head or gutted with a knife, he could never be killed and he came back film after film after film until finally in ""Halloween ""Resurrection"", Laurie is killed and Michael is believed to be killed also and unfortunately shortly after that movie was finished, the producer of these movies, Moustapha Akkad, was killed in a suicide bombing and for all intents and purposes, that was the end of the original Michael Myers Halloween Movies because Moustapha said that the only way he would stop making them was if he were dead.

The reason why Carpenter was able to get away with bringing Michael back was because of the possession story I explained earlier that Michael was cast in.....

****SPOILER ALERT****IF YOU HAVEN'T SEEN THE FIRST ROB ZOMBIE HALLOWEEN MOVIE, STOP HERE!****SPOILER ALERT****
In Zombie's first Halloween movie, no such demonic possession existed, Michael was portrayed as a child who grew up in a really twisted and dysfunctional household and who himself was bullied at school and one day just snapped and went ballistic on the bully at school and killed him, and killed his scumbag father and was incarcerated and then his twisted mother who was a stripper (more on this later) blows her brains out and then he grows up to be this huge M****RF****R who breaks out of Smiths Grove (just like in the first movie), returns to Haddonfield and starts killing people, now this is all well and good until the end of the movie when Laurie, his sister, shoots him in the head and kills him.

Now, I don't know if you're following me here but if you're not a person possessed by a demonic soul, when you get shot in the head by a gun the size of the one Laurie used at the range she was at?, YOU'RE DEAD!.....This is the first reason why this movie is so stupid...Yeah Yeah, I know it's Hollywood and they can do things like that, I get that but if you're going to make a sequel to a movie like this, at least make it look half way plausible so you're not insulting the audiences intelligence.

I thought the first Rob Zombie film was the better of the two, far better, way better, I'm glad I just rented this film because it's a piece of crap, I don't know why he bother schmutzing it up with his wife in it through out the movie playing a ghost, I mean seriously, the scenes with her could have been substituted with some kill scenes instead because this movie was sadly lacking a body count.....there were more bodies in the Original Halloween II (the music was better also).

There are GOOD things about this movie if you can believe it, Brad Dourif was terrific as Sheriff Brackett, Malcom McDowell, with all due respect to his acting ability was okay as Dr. Loomis but could never replace the late great Donald Pleasance. I really thought Danielle Harris was great in these Zombie flicks, she played the part of Annie very well. Newcomers who do NOT know who Danielle Harris is, she played Laurie Strode's daughter in Halloween IV: The return of Michael Myers and Halloween 5: The revenge of Michael Myers but for some reason was quickly removed from the cast in any future movies after that until these two remakes.

If you must see this movie, RENT IT, DO NOT BUY IT, Trust me, YOU'LL BE SORRY IF YOU DO, I believe in series continuity just like the next guy and I feel like I need to get every movie in a series but if I don't like a sequel, I DON'T BUY IT...........PERIOD and I didn't like this one AT ALL, Stay away from it!",1265414400,7,4354,4.5152284263959395
3066726,3,B0011G6FDI,"I'm a huge fan of Rob Zombie. I am very sad that I have to say this about his 2 different films Halloween 2 theatrical with better ending. Spoilers alert read no further if you haven't seen the director's cut! The directors cut has more gore as suspected and more nudity. Also it has more of Rob's famous seventy's exploitation style! Both versions are entirely different films in an effort to make more money. This is from a huge fan! The theatrical version has John Carpender's theme and is a better film, more 80's style. I prefer Halloween movies with the only scary parts included suspense,(Rob only had that with his first movie, House of a thousand corpses! The directors cut has great stuff but no theme or suspense just plenty of shock and gore more disturbing images and I think more nudity. Rob is an innovator of what's been done before, but not since the seventy's. Italian directors such as, Joe D'mato, Dadanto, and others have out gored him but those films weren't received well in the States, Unfortunately even Argento's and Bava's movies are better than this. I love you Rob but I had to write this review because you tried to cash out in a bad economy! Both films are great horror films and to the point, but why do the true fans have to buy 2 of the same film. Rob, you should have packaged this differently, it's not fare to fans, like myself. PS. Danielle Harris is still adorable!!!",1265328000,3,1406,4.539370078740157
3066727,4,B0011G6FDI,"ok so it would get 5 but zombie has to always release directors cuts that change the best parts of his movies to make em more f ed up. remember halloween one? the prison break, instead we get rape. yeah don't expect the original master peace ending! he changes it to an ending thats ok. but it was a good movie. and it was better than what they were planning. a difforent director to do it in 3D? no 3D sucks. any way get it, but if you can find the theatrical version get that one.",1265241600,3,482,4.03125
3066728,3,B0011G6FDI,"Let's start out by admitting that Rob Zombie creates a kind of pornography of violence in every film he makes.  There HAS to be, at all times and everywhere, a woman getting stabbed, psychopathic characters (and not just Michael or whatever killer he's schmoozing about) breaking each others' necks, etc.  That's what his shtick is.

I don't deny that he's creative, but the impulses behind his creativity are limited.  He wants to paint a landscape of evil, white trash, corruption and just anything depraved at all, and he does it: but it's so excessive and over the top that I can't take him seriously.  And I'm kind of glad.

I liked the nod he gave to Herk Harvey and ""Carnival of Souls"" with this one and the supernatural element added to Michael, but where is the Passion of Dr. Loomis?  Malcolm McDowell was wasted in the first one but he is *especially* wasted in this one.  I longed for Donald Pleasance as Zombie takes us on pointless book signings and celebrity rides with a corrupt, fame hungry Dr. Loomis (the point Rob Zombie wants to make is thus: there are no heroes.  There will be no Van Helsing to Michael's Dracula as there were in the originals.  Everything and everyone is corrupt in my movies, and if they aren't, they're ineffectual.  Like Brad Dourif as the sherrif. When Brad Dourif is the only good guy in the movie, you know you're in a bad landscape.)

Michael GRUNTING?  Are you KIDDING ME?  Where is the subtlety, the REALLY scary motherf**ker we saw in Halloween 2 who doesn't make a sound and strikes like a quiet serpent?  What is this goofball mask about that exposes half his face?  You can talk about nostalgia and creative liberty all you want, but the simple fact of the matter is that this does not live up to the original sequel one iota.  It's goofball fun.  The only thing that was fun about it was the general celebration of the horror genre going on in the background, like at the party scene. Halloween 5 sucked, so what was the point of bringing that actress back?  Rob's private nostalgia?  And the ending!  I was hoping Zombie would show us his true colors as an artist with a real resurrection of Michael's terror, but again, he had to rob the ending of another movie to get by.  This was entertaining if a little excessive, and that's it.",1265068800,,2290,4.547677261613692
3066729,1,B0011G6FDI,The worst movie i have ever seen in my entire life. Laurie and Dr. Loomis have now become mean. The personalities are completely different from the original. I was wishing Michael would kill them so this nightmare of a movie would end. Recommend this one to all your enemies,1265068800,24,274,4.612244897959184
3066730,4,B0011G6FDI,"Before I even get into the review of this movie as a whole, I've seen so many reviews of ppl having no clue to the relevance of what we see throughout the entire movie.. Michael's mother standing next to a white horse. This is because to appreciate and understand what's happening, you HAVE to pay attention from the 1st second.

This isn't a movie you can put in, then walk away or you'll miss the most important part of the explanation of what you later continue to see. At the beginning of the movie, there's a quote of the meaning of certain dreams, i.e the white horse. It also explains (as the movie progresses) why Michael himself is so much different in his killings with alot more rage and anger to them than we've seen before. You also have to remember this is a Rob Zombie movie and alot of his movies make you have to think instead of everything being very black and white and spelled out for you scene by scene.

If you miss that quote at the beginning, the whole movie loses alot of meaning and opens the door for alot of confusion. It's also not one that you can talk on the phone for 10 minutes and just pick up knowing what's going on. It's a MUST to READ the beginning where the definition of the white horse and other meanings are to understand why we keep seeing a white horse and his mother in a white dress standing next to it throughout the movie. Too many ppl seem to miss that and then have no clue why it's happening.

We all know Michael is crazy, but in this movie, Rob Zombie gives Michael a voice through young Michael and let's us see what it is that Michael sees to make him do what he does. In other words, since Michael never talks, if something needs to be said, it's young Michael who does the talking.

Before Michael's mother killed herself in the 1st Zombie 'Halloween', it flashes back to his mother giving Michael a white horse while he's locked up. Young Michael tells his mother it reminds him of a dream he had. When she asks what the dream was about, he tells her she was wearing a white dress, how beautiful she looked, and how she was walking with a white horse promising to take him home.

She tells him when he sees the white horse she gave him to think of her. She meant it as any mom would in the sense of when he looks at the horse she gave him, to think of her and it'll be his reminder that she's always with him. In Michael's mind, it takes on a whole new meaning because this is the vision he sees before he attacks as some kind of message from her... mom in a white dress standing next to a white horse promising to take him home. But in his mind, it also means nobody goes ""home"" until they can all be together by finding his sister and bringing her home too.

With that said, this movie starts off exactly where the last Rob Zombie version left off. Laurie is running down the street all bloody after she shot Michael. Time goes by and she's now living with her best friend that survived and her friends father (The Sheriff). She's still dealing with everything that happened. She has horrible nightmares that are pretty creepy, and has completely changed from her sweet and innocent look she used to have. She goes to therapy and is having a difficult time because Halloween is coming up of course and she's still having trouble dealing with the death of her parents and why this guy was after her in the 1st place.

Once again, Michael is after his sister, killing anyone who gets in his way on his mission. There's Laurie's life and then Michaels life you'll keep seeing, but the 2 seem to intertwine. They have some kind of connection as many of the things she sees, feels, experiences, and even tastes is somehow connected to what Michaels doing, experiencing, tasting and feeling. Soon enough she finds out through a tell all book that Dr. Loomis wrote of all that took place and gives away who Laurie Strode really is (Michaels sister). Laurie reads it and freaks out of course and thats when things get going as he's getting closer to her. The closer he gets, the deeper this strange connection is where she's almost becoming a part of him.

Michael keeps seeing his mother and the white horse as their mother keeps letting Michael know it's time to bring Laurie ""home"" with him.. just like his dream at the beginning.

It's also not the same young Michael that was in the 1st movie but don't let that throw you off. People have complained about that but the kid who played young Michael in the 1st one is a teen now. You can't have flashbacks of a child when that child is now a large teenager. You need to keep that in mind and not let it distract you.

Michael finds Laurie as he always does and it just gets even more strange from there with what she's seeing and what's really happening. Her reality is off. To explain why is open to interpretation and also would give away too much. Overall, this movie is good but you have to pay attention to make the movie itself even make sense when it comes to this odd connection between Michael, Laurie, and their mom.

As a footnote, there was something missing throughout the entire movie that I think took away alot of what the Halloween movies are famous for. The creepy piano score music wasn't there. You only hear it once at the end of the movie and that's a HUGE part of what makes the Halloween movies so great. When you hear that music, you know something is about to happen. But in this one, there's silence and hardly any music at all actually. To me, even though it was a good movie, to take that out was a big mistake.",1264896000,2,5545,4.3375120540019285
3066731,1,B0011G6FDI,"I totally loved what Rob Zombie did with the Halloween subject the first time out, especially being a massive fan of the original film itself.  But this sequel just plain sucked.  I found myself laughing out loud at the pitiful acting (""Breathing excercises?  BREATHING EXERCISES?!?""), and the needless, excessive gore was just - well - just that: needless and excessive.  Was there even a plot to this flick?  In the end it just seemed like a back-and-forth marathon of over-acted crying scenes with the girl playing Laurie Strode, then a ridiculously gory murder, then the crying, then a murder, and so on.  Skip this.  Seriously.  ""Saw VI"" was Gone With the Wind compared to this crap.",1264896000,29,688,4.870689655172414

She now lives with her best friend Annie (Danielle Harris) and father Sheriff Breckett (Brad Douriff) since her real parents were murdered two years ago, everything seems nice and quiet in the sleepy town of Haddonfield where people still remembers the horrifying kills that happened. Dr. Samuel Loomis (Malcom Mcdowell) has been doing the latest book based on Michael Myers's mental history including updating it about the incidents that happened two years ago and believes in his mind that Michael is dead, unfortunately the shape still lives in the outskirts of town as he sees supernatural visions of his mother (Sheri-Moon Zombie) telling him to kill.

Fair sequel to Rob Zombie's unneccessary but enjoyable remake of ""Halloween"" from John Carpenter. This one isn't a remake of the underrated 1981 Halloween 2 but more in name-only except with a few homages to the original part 2 such as the hospital but done in a nightmare. The film features suprises appearences by Weird Al Yankovich and Caroline Willaims (Texas Chainsaw Massacre 2) just for the fans, it's very entertaining but feels like a jumbled mess at times. There's too much white-trash in this one which i think Zombie has a foundness for except that it was done well in his first two movies which were great but not for the Halloween series. And feels too much like a Friday The 13th then an actual movie on the Halloween franchise, there's also too much vulgarity which sounds like the kind that the Full Metal Jacket drill Sgt would say with graphic gory violence. All in all it's not bad for a sequel but i think Rob Zombie had enough of Halloween and will make one more remake called The Blob then back to doing original stuff like his dream project ""Tyranosaurous Rex"", although ""Haunted World of El Superbeasto"" made up for this one.

This Blu-Ray offers the film in it's unrated director's cut featuring never-before-seen footage not shown in theaters with perfected picture including awesome sound.

As it turned out I gave Zombie props for providing everyone with a ""re-make"" instead of a ""re-do"". A re-make is when a director takes an old film, sometimes even a classic, and makes it different, and ideally, *better*. A re-do is when a director takes a film and adds nothing to the original. Zombie may not have made a *better* movie than the original, but he sure did give the movie a unique spin.

The first half of Zombie's 2007 Halloween was devoted to telling the Michael Myers story. The movie started by showing Myers' at age 10. It's during this time that Zombie chronicles how Myers went from troubled to tormented to demented to completely psychopathic. The kid that played Myers at age 10 was outstanding. In fact, the first half of Zombie's first Halloween movie was so well done that I was saying to myself as I was watching that ""this is a great movie."" But then the second half just collapsed with too many clich&eacute; horror movie ""oh that would never really happen"" moments. The whole point of the first half of Zombie's first Halloween movie seemed to attempt to show that Myers was human and just a psychopath, but that starts to go out the window in the second half as Myers starts showing a few immortal traits.

And Zombie's 2009 Halloween II pick's up right where the first one left off, and it takes the unbelievable and the supernatural aspects of the first movie and expands on them resulting in kind of a mess of a movie. And speaking of mess, the Myers murders in Halloween II are brutal. Not so much gory as plain outright savagely brutal. So if that's your bag, then at least you get that with Halloween II. Halloween II has some flashbacks to Halloween I, but it's not even the same kid playing young Michael Myers; in H2 it's some look-alike kid that's unremarkable at best.

If you're a preservationist that doesn't want his classics messed with, then Zombie's adaptations of Carpenter's Halloween franchise will probably leave you angry and unsatisfied. I, on the other hand, was entertained by Zombie's Halloween, but the second one, the one that this review is attached to, left me feeling that maybe Zombie gave us one Halloween too many.",1264723200,5,2630,5.3173076923076925

3066746,1,B0011G6FDI,"""Halloween 2"" is an intelligent failure. The obviously talented and wise Rob Zombie, in my humble opinion, saw too big for his tail of a mute and ineffable human wreck who wants to kill his sister in order to bring her back to his ghostly family. You simply can't put too much layers of metaphores into something that doens't allow it. The leitmotiv of the white horse, the visions of the mother and little Michael shared by both Laurie and the big Michael, all this falls flat. A little more and you'd start hearing a voice-over. It's easy to see that Mr. Zombie wanted it to be his ""Blade Runner"".

I really wanted to like ""Halloween 2"". Rob Zombie's course as a horror filmmaker is an interresting and promising one. His first and subsequent movies weren't necessarily perfect but they did show a sensible, yet twisted and demented, artist with a true vision and a thing or two to say. In interviews or within his own documentaries, you see him as a cunning and visionary author who truly has his characters and story at heart. The people he works with seems to want to go at incredible lenghts in order to please him.

Here, he kept saying that he could at last be free and bring his visions to a full circle. But Michael Myers, without any emotion or lines, simply doesn't have enough ""juice"" to go on for two hours. And the other characters are either tiring, annoying (the ever so screaming Laurie), misscast or simply laughable. Brad Dourif as the sheriff and Malcom Mcdowell are probably crazier and scarier than Michael Myers, the self-centered psychologist being built as a badly-written archetype character with a cheap and clich attempt at redemption at the end.

Plus, after seing movies like ""Scream"" and others ""Horror Movie"" who made fun of all the clichs used in horror films, you'd think that a wise person like Rob Zombie wouldn't put those clichs in his ""serious"" movie... well, those clichs are there all right. The killer walking calmly still managing to catch the running victims, The killer appearing out of nowhere, the victims (with a close-up on their faces) not seing the killer who's beside them simply because we, as spectators, aren't seing him either, the victims who's hidden places are revealed to the killer because they can't stop screaming, i mean heck! A bit more and they would have pull the old trick of the cat behind the door.

Plus Rob Zombie, i feel, made an error of tone. In his previous movies (""House..."" and ""... Rejects""), the story allowed for quaint, hillbilly characters. Not here. It's more dark, serious and ""deep"". Therefore, The crazy and scary looking sheriff or psychologist don't fit. And Rob Zombie, although i think he is talented, has weak points nonetheless. One of those is to always put simple and stupid characters with cheap lines, like the two ambulance drivers in the beginning.

The long nightmare at the start is also a perfect example of a director shooting himself in the foot. By the time we realize that it is a nightmare, we've already said ten times to ourselves that it was stupid and clich. Even if we're going ""Oh, ok. It's a bad dream. We can start over."", the damage, i feel, is already done.

I mean, the story was so small that Michael Myers needed to voluntarily make a couple of useless detours in order to kill complete innocent strangers who didn't have any link what-so-ever with the main plot, thus making these horrible kills perfectly gratuitous. Killing for the sake of killing.

All in all, i'm still very curious about Rob Zombie's visions and i'm still going to follow him in his creative, yet twisted, journey as a filmmaker. ""Halloween 2"" was a ""faux pas"" but i think that ultimately, he will become better and more focused because of it.

In my humble opinion of course.",1264636800,2,3771,4.694402420574886

I would rate Halloween 1- Rob Zombie remake a 2.5 if possible but since it isn't I believe I rated it a 3. However, this movie- OMG. Where to begin? Didn't Dr. Loomis die in the first movie of the remake? I think he did but he is alive and very greedy in this one. He also portrays very little moral. Laurie is just a nut- a girl with way too many psycho episodes and with too many anxiety and anger issues- sweet, depressed, reliable Laurie Stroude she is not. Micheal, well he talks and makes noises. He also walks around without a mask and we see his whole face and wow it has way too much facial hair! Then there is this whole issue with visions that Micheal has and dreams that Laurie does (acted mostly by Zombies wife I hear) that really don't make sense- they simply don't fit. They just make the film seem odd. The timing in the movie is off- the first remake seemed to be made modern day, this remake who knows. The TV's are turn dials and black and white, yet there are cars from the 90's and there is rock parapanalia (spelling?) all over the place that make me think of the late 90's. Also, Zombie seems to have taken parts of other Halloween sequels and used them in this part- yawn. In addition, I don't know if some parts were meant to be funny but if they were they fell flat. As for what was wrong with the first remake, that continues to be wrong here, there is entirely too much trash going on. This is not the middle class suburb that John Carpenter portrayed in his movies. These characters are very much working class and at the same time lacking class. The characters cuss all too much and without good reason alot of the time, just for the sake of it seems. This movie tries to go into Micheals Psychi (spelling?) making him human but just crazy rather than the simple he's just a psychopath. There is no suspense just kill, kill.

Why is Rob Zombie's wife in every one of his movies? Anyway the problem i have is Laurie isn't even a likable character. Also neither is Dr. Loomis. In the original you got behind the 2 main characters almost rooting for them. In this one i found myself WANTING Michael Myers to KILL them!! The characters are horrible, foul mouthed people, with Laurie being a promiscuous woman(or so i thought). Jamie Lee played the part the way it should be-the virginal good kid. Dont they know the rules(thanks Scream!) I am ashamed that Rob Zombie would put out something like this, yes the killing was more brutal with the stabbings and all but overall the characters and story were very weak.

Just finished re-screening the first part of Halloween II while eating dinner and giving some Bitburger ale a proper seeing-to.  This was followed by a shot of Johnnie Walker Black Label.
The way I see it, Halloween and Halloween II are ritual drama.  The plot is obscure, verging on the incoherent.  Michael Meyers' mother, after her suicide, has apparently crossed over to the dark side and is now exhorting Michael to bring Boo home - i.e. stab the living crud out of her.  This, seemingly is Michael's mission.  Michael lives off the land, walking cross-lots a la Shawcross.  However, in the process of finding Boo - Laurie Strode, who has now refreshingly turned into a foul-mouthed, death-rocking nightmare on wheels, Michael must also put down many worthless hillbillies.  This indiscriminate killing does not seem related to his vision quest to stab Boo to death, and so contributes to the dream-like incoherence of the plot.  I mean it's hardly like Michael is harvesting these souls to populate the same ""heaven"" to which he is recruiting Boo.  One gets the impression that these souls are undesirable.  And yet slay them Michael must and slay them Michael does, for reasons known only to himself.
Also, as the story progresses, Young Michael appears alongside the adult Michael, leading the earnest viewer to drunkenly conclude that the adult Michael is a kind of Golem, created by his now-evil mother, to roam the earth and cull garbalogical humans while on his solemn quest to slay Boo down.
Meanwhile, Loomis has himself turned into a nightmare on wheels.  His eventual slaying by Michael seems to confer more dignity than he merits.  This adds to the basic sense of incoherence and dream logic, elements that seem intrinsic to ritual drama.  In ritual drama, the audience knows what must happen.  People must run screaming with their faces carved up and purple blood bubbling from their mouths while their eyes work apoplectically.  The audience knows the necessary plot so well that what does happen is soothingly immaterial.  Due to this strict determinism, the movie goes through its evolutions with the tranquility of things already happened.  In such a ritual drama, only the incoherence of the plot lends the sense of possibility and space.  Thus, in a Noh drama, the Samurai who slays the evil witch who flys about by whirling her long neck, he is lent charisma and dignity by the fact that his actions are at a basic level incomprehensible.  The basic message being a metaphysical observation: if the world did not contain something irrational, it could not be.",1264291200,3,2707,5.026905829596412
3066763,5,B0011G6FDI,"If you are going to watch the new Halloween films, let me state that you need to watch the UNRATED director's cut versions and not the theatrical versions. I can honestly say that now Rob Zombie's Halloween films are among my top favorite films of all time. He has done an incredible job of taking the character Michael Myers and making him ""human"". Don't get me wrong. I appreciate the original but now there is a complete story to the mayhem inside Michael's mind. The story is believable and realistic. I don't want to give anything away but I will say this is NOT a remake of Halloween Two. Unlike the first Zombie film which did somewhat follow along the original (except for the addition of a few murders and the institution scenes) this film is entirely different. I will say that the opening few minutes of the film recreate the hospital massacre (with even more brutality) but the rest of the film then jumps ahead to two years later. I won't say anything more than that. What you can expect is to be genuinely terrified.

Forget what you know about the old films. This is a more brutal Michael and yet at the same time, you almost feel a little sorry for him because he is so mentally disturbed. I also wasn't thrilled with the casting of Laurie in the first Zombie movie, but I have to say she really shined as an actress in this one and I now appreciate her more. Keep an open mind and check out this movie!",1264204800,5,1419,4.395437262357414
3066764,1,B0011G6FDI,"I grew up watching Michael Meyers. I loved all the Halloween movies even the most hated one Resurrection. And i aint gonna lie Rob Zombie did a OK job with the first one, but he totally missed on the second. Making Michael have flashbacks of his mom and a white horse. This was just a lame way to put his wife in the movie. The story just bores. The characters are stupid. Why do you have to show Michael without his mask so much. Meyers is suppose to be scary. By the end of the movie you lose interst in fear for him. And why does he happen to look like Rob Zombie himself without his mask!?! Not to mention the Picture quality of this blu ray is awful.  Anyways TRUE fans of Halloween will be sadly disppointed I was!",1264118400,5,720,4.142857142857143
3066765,3,B0011G6FDI,"I actually really enjoyed Rob Zombies 2007 release, I thought it was well done and enjoyable with nothing too horbly far fetched. However, this was not at all what I had thought it would have been. The first thing that really got me was how awful they made Laurie (Angel) and her friends. I realize that someone with that past would be a little messed up in the future, but as someone previous stated they went from ""Highschool girls to Suicide Girls"". It was overly played that she was mentally disturbed when we see her room and how filthy the area she lives in is, and how trashy her friends are. But that was tolerable- I went along with it. However, I cannot and will not ever be alright with his addition of a young Michael and his mother (Sherri Moon) along with a white horse constantly showing up. A supernatural twist in this film ruined it for me. Perhaps one scene would have been okay for me, but this was repetitive and became annoying. Although I will give him credit, adding The Moody Blues ""The Night- Nights in White Satin"" gave an interesting twist on the perspective of the mother being a ""Knight in white satin"". Aside from that, her constant prescence in the film was ridiculous. Also, having Laurie have the same dreams and visions as Michael and even being held down by a ghost was beyond repair for me. I gave the film a three because without the supernatural ghosties, the story was alright and the effects were good. I doubt if a third comes out I will bother.",1264032000,4,1487,4.470588235294118
3066766,3,B0011G6FDI,"I have to give Rob Zombie credit, for when he makes a sequel he doesn't just make the same film over again. Zombie obviously loves the old horror film and it shows in every horror film he has made. I watched both the unrated and theatrical versions of the film and I think the theatrical moves along more smoothly and has a better ending. The gore is trimmed down slightly, but doesn't take away from this brutal film in any way.

Zombie gives this film a very cool look and does create some eerie atmosphere, but I did find some elements confusing at times and that does take away from the overall experience. I wish they could have had the original actor who played young Michael in the first film as this actor just doesn't seem to be playing the same character. While the original was very withdrawn, the one in this film just seems like a regular kid. This could be due to the fact that he is only in the film as a figment of adult Michael and Angels imagination.

The kill scenes are brutal and not just because of the excessive gore, but because the set ups are genuine and that makes from some gut wrenching murders. Zombie also has a knack for placing actors that we have seen over the years in these scenes, so we feel an little more sorry for them.

The unrated version is longer and pulls us out of the action more times than needed, but it is certainly worth seeing for fans...I just preferred the theatrical. I do have one big gripe, why do they need to release the two versions separately?....I know the answer (GREED!), but it's shameful to charge fans twice for a film that isn't all that much different. I know I'm not alone when I say I want both versions, but I don't think it's worth paying the price! Both releases have a bunch of extras that are the same including outtakes, gag reel, music videos by the kooky horror band in the film and commentary.

Overall if you like Zombie or newer horror films, you will probably like this film. I happen to love old horror film,but there are some good horror films out there today and this film will stay with you like all of Zombies Horror outings.....and isn't that what good horror films should do?",1264032000,17,2165,4.3915211970074814
3066767,4,B0011G6FDI,"After an extremely long month+ layover, Sid the Elf has made a triumphant return back into the world of B. It was long overdue and thought a great way to celebrate would be with the newly released Halloween 2. Now as you may or may not know the Sid brothers are a huge fan of the original Halloween series but never turn down the chance to check out a different concept of Myers. Original Myers has always been one of the most feared characters in horror history with good reason. He's an unstoppable force of sheer terror, but did lack in a few departments. Zombie's version of Myers takes removes any lack of fear due to the fact that he's a giant lunatic with superhuman strength. Never before have the killings been more gruesome. Say farewell to the typical stabbings as he goes to new lengths to keep your jaw dropped in pure shock. We'd even put money on the fact that Zombie's Myers would kick the snot out of original Myers hands down.

In Halloween 2 Zombie took his own spin on things making the film entirely his own idea. Yeah there's a little bit of hospital action going down, but nothing like the original Halloween 2. We pick up with a very jacked up pill addicted Laurie Strode trying to erase the memory of Myers prior attacks. With Loomis pushing his new top selling book, that exploits Laurie at every turn, all the old wounds are opened up while Myers gets back to business as usual. While seeing visions of his mother along with a young version of himself (CRAZY CRAZY) he becomes more and more enraged demolishing anyone in his path on his quest to finish off his sister Laurie. Overall the film was pretty solid but was almost too much. We've never seen a Myers this brutal leaving us legitimately freaked out which is what earned it 4 stars. So if there's any question to who is king of the slasher, there is no other correct answer besides new Myers. This guy will mess you up for the rest of your life.",1263945600,3,1930,4.421348314606742
3066768,5,B0011G6FDI,"Michael Myers was always my favorite horror icon, scared the crap out of me as a kid and after the first two original films, was hoping for more of the same (not watered down sequels).  It never happened, then came the re-envisioned first Halloween.  I loved Rob's House of a Thousand Corpses and Devil's Rejects so when I saw the first one, my mind was blown. I like opening my mind to new ideas, a new take on my favorite Horror movie.  Like most, I was dying for Rob's Halloween 2, I missed the theatrical release (long story) so it was even worse to wait for the Blu-ray to come out.

Zombie did it again, right when I thought I had an idea of what he was going to do, he elevates the story. The beginning was very cool with reflections of the original Halloween 2 and then made it just a nightmare. LOVED THAT! Why?  Because now I didn't know what was going to happen.  Making Laurie mentally/emotionally lose it was brilliant, I  mean how could that onslaught from Michael in the first movie not do that to any sane person?

Loved the Sheriff bringing Laurie into his home and of course watching how Annie and Laurie's relationship fall apart due to what happened to them.  The ending was beautiful, Rob knew what to do with his story version and how to give it great closure.  Not sure why people hated how Loomis turned out, I loved the original but this Loomis is not the same character.  Fame got to his head, Rob showed flaws in Loomis. Nice touch.

Also Michael is a nut case, why wouldn't he imagine himself as a kid and talking to his mother?  It fit this version of Halloween.  Over all, it was a great fresh surprise in Halloween 2. It makes me sad that it's done for Zombie but I also didn't want ten sequels.

Thank you Rob for this version of Michael Myers, I loved the original and this version, sits right next to it in my heart of Horrors.",1263945600,2,1861,4.307471264367816
3066769,2,B0011G6FDI,"Well I would first warn any readers that this review may contain some spoilers, but honestly, I don't think it would even really matter. In fact, I might be doing some of you guys a favor by telling you what happens in the film rather than you having to actually sit and watch it! Ok ok..maybe this film is not THAT bad, but it isn't good by any means, and you shouldn't be expecting anything great, especially if you've seen the first installment of the Zombie remake. And that's why I definitely wasn't expecting anything good before going to the theaters to watch this film, but I left the theater just as disappointed as I did after viewing the first remake. But since I'm a big horror fan, and have purchased all the other Halloween films, including the first Zombie film, I had to buy this one too, and decided to give this one a couple of more viewings before writing this review. But to say my opinion has changed any since I viewed this film the first time, that really isn't the case. Just like the first film, there are just way too many things wrong with this film for me to really enjoy it.
  So where do I begin to list the many problems I have with this film? How bout the way Rob Zombie dupes the audience into thinking the movie is going to be actually semi-decent in the first 25 minutes of the movie? Talk about being completely disappointed! When watching this for the first time, and seeing the hospital chase scene, like that of the original Halloween 2, I was thinking to myself..could it be? Has Rob Zombie redeemed himself here and actually made a straight-forward, in-your-face film that pays true homage to the original films? My interest was peaked..and I was genuinely excited..until of course, Laurie wakes up, and you find out that Zombie just used the oldest trick in the book to fool, and in my case, disappoint his audience.
  Now onto other problems..first off, the Laurie Strode character. The way her character is portrayed, it's just really hard to sympathize with her. For the most part, she comes off as a bitch, using the F word every other word in many scenes (which can be blamed on bad script writing as well). She's sad and depressed one minute, then is a wild, care-free party chick the next..there are really no qualities about her that make me want to care about her character at all. And the Sam Loomis character, where do I begin here? His character was so painful to watch. Just a complete travesty compared to the original Loomis character played by Donald Pleasance. Why turn the Loomis character into a money hungry, self-centered bastard? Then only have him ""turn"" good in the last 10 minutes of the film, like its gonna make a difference..its completely unbelievable. Now I'm not blaming Mr. McDowell for his performance. For the kind of character I'm sure he was told to portray, he did an alright job.  Again, its the overall writing of the character that's so bad. Also, there's a new actor that plays young Michael Myers rather than Daeg Faerch. And although Chase Vanek looks the part much better than Faerch did, his acting leaves much to be desired, with all his lines being almost read in a monotone voice. The same could be pretty much said about Sheri Moon's performance as well, which was mediocre at best.
  Now on to Michael Myers..just when I thought Rob Zombie had done enough damage to his character in the first film, his continues to do so in this one. The grunting when he's stabbing people, the hoodie he wears (are u kidding me, a hoodie?!), the 10 little cut scenes where it shows him walking through some field like Bigfoot, giving him superpowers to be able to turn cars over, and worst of all..showing his face time and time again! Since Zombie claims to be such a horror fan, I would think he would have learned something from suspense master Alfred Hitchcock, and that is, many things should be left up the audience's imagination. The great thing about Michael Myers is that blank, emotionless mask. You don't know what is behind it, and that's a great thing. But when you show his face, and he looks just like some big bearded guy (actually, he looks like Zakk Wylde!), then it takes away from the character, and is much less scary or mysterious. But even that isn't as bad as what happens at the end of the film, when Michael actually SPEAKS..yes, speaks! This is a different ending from that of the theatrical version, and overall, I thought this unrated directors was actually better than that version, but when Michael utters the word ""Die!"" to Loomis at the end, I just shook my head in disgust.
  Much like the first film, I feel that Zombie just missed the mark here. First off, why have Michael's mother as the main catalyst for his rage? For originality, I give him a 1 for that. Hasn't he ever heard of any little movies called Friday the 13th?! The point of Michael Myers doing the evil things he does, is just that..he's pure evil. You don't know his motives, and again, not knowing something is scarier then trying to give an explanation to everything. Not only does Zombie give you this explanation, but he runs it into the ground by showing scene after scene of a white horse or Michael's mother, and young Michael, while they're talking off bad dialogue. Yeah, we get it, enough is enough..the audience doesn't need to be reminded of it every 5 minutes. It felt like more or less that Zombie just put those scenes in to give his real-life wife more screen time.
  With all the problems I had with this film, I did enjoy a couple of things. Again, the first 25 minutes of the film were good. And I do have to say, that for the most part, this version is better than the theatrical version too. And though I've read some reviews that put down Zombie down for showing more blood and gore, and making the film more violent, this is something I think he did very well. The kill scenes, though simplistic (mostly just stabbing, stomping, or smashing), were done very good.
 Maybe I'm just too hard on this film, I just can't like this movie. Its probably a bit better than the first Halloween, since you're not having to sit through an hour of crappy backstory about Michael's childhood. At least this one jumps right into the story. But the writing and imagining of many of the characters are just plain bad. I understand Zombie wanted to do something different here, but at some point, enough is enough. It's one thing to re-image something, its another thing to completely change established characters and story. With just a little tweaking, this could be an entirely different film, having nothing to do with the Halloween series at all. Slap another title on it, and there you have it. And I think I would have really liked these two films, if that was the case. However, when remaking or re-imaging an established classic film, there should be some boundaries. Simply put, Zombie should just stick to creating original material.",1263945600,6,6929,4.592562651576395

3066781,4,B0011G6FDI,I wanted to see this movie in the theatre but missed it. So when it came out on DVD i scooped it up ASAP! I was not disappointed! I love the way Zombie made this sequel! He did not change Carpenters' Halloween nor do I think he meant to. He improved on a classic and gave it more depth and understanding of all the characters. I have to say it isn't really scary but the shock and brutality that occurrs in this film make up for that!!! I love the way he uses the Moody Blues' Nights in White Satin song. It fits the scenes perfectly; including the White Horse reference. I like how Zombie humanizes the death and depravity of the murdered victims throughout the movie unlike some other horror flicks that just show non-sensical slaughter with no emotional attachment. I unfortunately did not like Zombie's first installment of Halloween but this definitely takes the cake!!! Rob Rocks!!!!!!!,1263859200,,892,4.616352201257862

I would've wanted to see more actual gore rather than the after-effects of someone being stabbed/pummeled. His first Halloween was 100 times better, but then again how could you top that!!! Overall, I'd still recommend this movie because the storyline actually made sense and of course he leaves the door open for M. Myers to come back for another go. I can't allow my expectations to ruin the ratings of a good film. It's worth seeing once.",1263859200,,678,4.6115702479338845
3066785,3,B0011G6FDI,"*** THIS REVIEW MAY CONTAIN SPOILERS *** SPOILER ALERT! ***

""Halloween II"" is a bit of a disappointment as a follow-up to Zombie's remake of the original.  That doesn't mean that the movie is bad.  My main problems with the movie are how dark the picture is (there are several scenes where you can't really see what's going on. It's all part of Zombie's direction though, which is good in it's own way) and the ""reviving"" of several characters that were victims of Michael Myers' previous killing spree in ""Rob Zombie's Halloween"". For example, Dr. Loomis is a prominent figure in ""Halloween II"". I seem to remember the end of ""Rob Zombie's Halloween"" when Loomis has his eyes CRUSHED INSIDE HIS SKULL by Michael Myers. Even if you firmly believe in suspension of disbelief, which I do, it is very far-fetched that Loomis would survive such an attack, let alone regain his sight for this sequel  (and yes, I know that Loomis is seen alive after the attack in ""Rob Zombie's Halloween""... that's too far-fetched as well). Too unbelievable, even for a horror movie. I also didn't really care for the dream sequences, they seem kinda corny and are used as simple filler material at times to provide some lengthy Myers' killing scenes, seemingly to take up time. I think the script was probably short to begin with and was difficult to stretch into a 90 minute movie, thus the dream sequences.  I really don't like Scout-Taylor Compton's acting, and unfortunately, the entire movie centers around her character, Lorrie Strode.  I have heard some people review this movie and say, ""This is Rob Zombie's best film yet.""  That's not true at all.  It's his worst if you have to pick a spot for it. Again, that doesn't make it bad. The movie doesn't skimp on violence at all, as this sequel is as brutal as any other Rob Zombie film, thus far at least. The movie is overall disturbing and depressing and entertaining.  Despite it's flaws, I enjoyed it.  3 and 1/4 stars.",1263859200,2,1961,4.690962099125365
3066786,5,B0011G6FDI,"The directors cut of Rob Zombie's HALLOWEEN 2 is certainly the finest film in the series since John Carpenter's original film.  I didn't think Zombie's original remake was exceptional, although it was miles ahead of most of the garbage remakes we are being subjected to by the likes of Michael Bay and his wretched cohorts at Platinum Dunes. Based on bad word of mouth from friends and reviewers I decided to skip this film in the theatres and check it out when the video was released.  I watched it at a friends house last night and this morning got out of bed and rushed to the store to buy my own copy.  This was so much more than I expected it to be, in fact I would suggest that it is the finest sequel to a slasher film ever made, and certainly the most artfully photographed.

I can full understand why those wanting nothing more than a remake of the original HALLOWEEN 2 would have problems with this film, and I can also relate to the problems people have with changing a beloved horror icon into something new and different, but the changes Zombie has made have truly brought new life and a new (and far more original) direction to this series.  Michael Myers is now far more frightening without his mask than he is with it.

I rarely have any emotional connection to the characters and events in a horror film but Rob Zombie pulled a lot of emotions out of me with this one, in particular the stunning ending of the film.  David Lynch has never composed a
more beautiful sequence than the one that ends this film.  All of the scenes that feature Shari Moon Zombie as Deborah Myers are exceptionally beautiful and there is something quite wonderful about seeing her family reunited in this film. / I think it would also take a viewer with a very hard heart not to be moved by the scene where Sheriff Brackett (played very well indeed by Brad Dourif) discovers the body of Annie (Danielle Harris).

HALLOWEEN 2 manages to be beautiful and ugly at the same time.  Zombie shot the film on 16mm stock and it looks pretty good in most scenes.  Surreal images abound in this and of particular interest is the ""dinner party"" which is unlike anything I've seen before.  I don't know where Zombie gets his ideas (and I'm glad such ideas don't come to me) but they are truly original.

Most of the cast is excellent and in addition to Moon, Harris and Douriff, we get wonderful performances from Margot Kidder, Howard Hessman and Bill Faggerbach (spelling?).  Alas, not all of the cast is great.  Malcolm McDowell (miscast in both of these films) is distractingly over the top and the repulsive Scout Taylor-Compton screams, cries and pouts her way through this one and becomes so unlikable that I'm really ready for Michael to cut her open from top to bottom long before the end of the film.  These are serious complaints but I can live with them because everything else in this film works so beautifully.

In response to those who complain that Rob Zombie is ruining the HALLOWEEN franchise, I can only wonder if they have ever watched HALLOWEEN 5, or HALLOWEEN:RESSURECTION (a film so relentlessly awful that I have only watched it twice in my life and never intend to watch it again . . . now that was a film that could wreck a franchise).  The original HALLOWEEN and all of the sequels are still right there on your shelf, ready to be watched whenever you feel like it and they will be exactly as you remember them.  Rob Zombie can not change those films one bit.  If you don't like what he has done with his versions, don't buy them or watch them.

So what is on the disc?  Not as much as the other three Zombie films have had.  There is a highly entertaining commentary track from Zombie (his commentaries are always informative and interesting), some very poor deleted scenes (a half hours worth), some bloopers, several clever music videos of Captain Clegg and the Night Creatures (the band playing at the party in the film) and a dumb unedited Stand-up routine of Uncle Seymore (the guy with the teeth on stage at the party).  The extras are the same on both the DVD and the BluRay and since this is a rather messy looking, grainy film, it is perhaps safe to save your money and buy the DVD rather than the Bluray disc, as the poor film stock is highlighted in higher resolution.  Sony/Dimension decided to really rape viewers by not including both theatrical and director cuts on one disc and forcing them to be bought seperately by those who want to have both versions.  Money grubbing bastards.

While this isn't a perfect film, it is certainly far above average, and a real surprise in this day of inept remakes and idiotic sequels and Michael Bay films.  I really love HALLOWEEN 2.",1263772800,,4696,4.531990521327014
3066787,1,B0011G6FDI,"I'm going to begin with the positives: the movie features Brad Dourif, who is one of the best actors working today, doing his best to give a good performance and hack his way through this with a thinly written character and clunky dialog. Also we get to see legendary veteran actor Malcolm McDowell, in all his charisma and charm. Rob Zombie even manages to build a character arc into the plot for him, however unconvincing it may be.
And now for the negative: this is one of the worst movies I have ever seen. It builds no tension, sustains no suspense, introduces no characters I could care about. It is horribly edited, coming off as a jumble of scenes which do not seem to hang together or build upon each other properly. It is frustrating. Much of the film is confusing, and in the end I just didn't care. At all. It is so poorly written, at times I wasn't believing what I was hearing coming out of the actor's mouths. If all that weren't bad enough, if commits the number one sin of the horror film: it isn't the slightest bit scary. This movie is a mess. I think there were some things here that could have been taken and built upon to make a decent film, but these opportunities were missed. A few shots work on their own, but that's a long way from creating any kind of sustained experience. Dreadful!",1263772800,2,1311,4.399176954732511
3066788,4,B0011G6FDI,"I am a fan of the original Halloween movies.  I have to admit the first time I saw this film, I was quite disappointed.  However, after seeing it a second time I came to really enjoy it.

The main reason I found this second oppinion, is this...

In the original Halloween films it reveals that Laurie Strode is in fact Michael's sister and that Michael is trying to kill everyone in his family, but it never explains why.

In Rob Zombie's second helping of Halloween we finally are given a glimpse as to why he wants his family dead and I feel that that is really what has saved the movie.

Yes there are a lot of dream sequences, but they are vital to revealing the psychology of the movie.

Many of the people who have reviewed this focus on the violence, gore, and fowl language that is rampant in all Rob Zombie movies.  If you are looking to find if this is appropriate for children the answer would be Heck No!

I get how it ties into the movie, but it is a different character completely, until the end at the shed.  Finally, Michael has always had sister problems, his mother never told him when to kill, I think that ol' Rob Zombie got Michael and Jason confused.  Should have just changed Haddonfield to a lake and called it Friday the 13th, it would have been better than the last movie in that series.",1263772800,2,571,4.349056603773585

I wasn't exactly a big fan of the remake from 2007 and expectations for this film were incredibly low, nobody can really be prepared for how terrible this film really is. Since there's so much wrong with this film, we'll try and start with what was actually was enjoyable.

Brad Dourif as Sheriff Brackett is really the highlight of the film as far as acting goes. While that probably isn't saying much and his role isn't as big as you may expect, he does a good job with the screen time he gets. His character is intense right from the start, but as things take a turn for the worse for his character his downward spiral is the most enthralling aspect of the film. A few of the deaths were also really satisfying. Mainly Buddy the Security Guard. There's a night scene where an officer is out on Sheriff Brackett's lawn and we're looking at the silhouette of a tree while the officer searches the premises. Before you know it, we see Michael emerge from that tree silhouette and kill the officer.

Everything else in the film was just horrendous. The flaws are almost so overwhelming that it's nearly impossible to know where to begin. The whole white horse thing is ridiculous. So if Deborah Myers tells young Michael that he can think of her whenever he looks at the white horse figurine she gave him, wouldn't that make her a horse by default? The inconsistencies in the film are incredibly glaring, as well. Laurie and Annie's injuries from the previous film seem more severe at the start of this one, Laurie being able to put weight on an injured leg by walking on it but it causing her extreme pain when she's lifted from a stretcher to a bed at the hospital, Michael chopping off a guy's head with a shard of glass, etc. The ""Nights in White Satin"" thing was literally beaten into your skull by the time the film ended. If you sit through the film, it's like Rob is sitting next to you each time the song comes on nudging you with his elbow going, ""Eh? Do you get it? You get it?"" Michael was way too vocal for my liking. Heavy breathing is one thing, but when we're hearing him grunt loudly every time he stabs somebody then it takes a lot of it. When he actually talked at the end of the film, I was done. He also seemed to spend more time stabbing women than men in the film. Guys get their head chopped off or an axe to the back while women get stabbed a dozen times or have their face smashed against a mirror nine times. The choreography didn't seem as good as the remake either. There's a scene where water gets on the camera and it's on there the entire scene. It's interesting at first, but after a few minutes you just want someone to get a towel to wipe it down. As powerful as Michael seems to be, it at least made a bit more sense in the original film by John Carpenter. Michael was pure evil. That was the explanation, so him not being able to die at least sort of made sense. Now that he's been given this white trash upbringing in the remake, his super strength and inability to die just seems even more farfetched than it originally did. So when Michael is busting through walls and lifting cars with his bare hands all Incredible Hulk style in this film, it's laughable. Not to mention what happened to the Dr. Loomis character. There are just way too many things wrong with this sequel to list here.

Rob Zombie has certainly made Halloween his own with Halloween II. It's just a shame that it's really not worth watching seriously. Let's put it this way, the highlight of the film is Weird Al's cameo. After five films of dealing with white trash families, it's time for Zombie to move on to something different. It's safe to say he's bled that idea bone dry. I wouldn't seriously recommend this film to anyone, but if you're looking for a film to watch with some friends to laugh at and make fun of while it's going then this is the perfect film.",1263772800,4,4000,4.366442953020134

It's just like any other Rob Zombie movie except it is set to Halloween. It's just a bunch of brutality mixed with bad acting, trailer-trash stereotypes, and hallucinations on the part of the protagonist and the antagonist. The camera shots are dull and boring (and shaky - I think that particular 'horror effect' is ridiculous and actually makes movies look worse), a far cry from the original series, which always established truly creative and horrific shots when the Shape appeared.

3066803,1,B0011G6FDI,"Well, it's January again. Christmas time has come and gone, the New Year has begun, and what better way to start things off than with a deluge of horror films. At least that's what Hollywood apparently believes. Apparently the annual January to February tradition for rentals is to make available the many horror films that were released to theaters the previous September and October. The most recent horror film from last year to be released was the not-so eagerly anticipated (at least by me) Rob Zombie sequel to his ""Halloween"" remake from 2007, the aptly titled ""Halloween 2"".

""Halloween 2"" finds Laurie Strode (Scout Taylor Compton) struggling to find some semblance of understanding as to why the masked monstrosity known as Michael Myers attacked her and her friends without provocation. Now, two years after that horrific night, the presumed dead Michael Myers has mysteriously returned to Haddonfield to finish what he started.

While watching this horrible creation spawned from the twisted mind of former rocker turned writer/director Rob Zombie, I was reminded yet again that this new remake driven ""Halloween"" franchise is nothing at all like its predecessor. For clarification, the fact that a remake-centric series is drastically different from the original is not necessarily a bad thing. In this case though, the bad far outweighs any good that one could possibly gleam from the first two entries into the new franchise.

For starters, the initial remake in 2007 was a twisted amalgamation of depravity, sadism, and gratuitous sex and gore that shared only a slight resemblance to the John Carpenter classic to which it was supposedly paying homage. Not only did it have all that working against it, but it also tried to create a sense of empathy for Michael Myers, and I for one do not want to feel sorry for or understand him. I preferred the Michael that was more mysterious and ultimately less savage than what we find in this series. So, with the initial movie, this series of ""Halloween"" films was already off to a bad start and with ""Halloween 2"" the quality appears to have suffered even more.

In the sequel, everything that was sick and twisted about the first film is taken even further in this entry. The gore is even more grotesque and pervasive, the characters are even more morally bankrupt, and the unbridled savagery of Michael is taken to an all-time low for either series. Essentially, there are no redeemable aspects to find within this movie, except (and this is a stretch) it does attempt to bring a resolution to the story that was started in the previous film... oh, and the fact that the movie ends (that was my favorite part of the experience).

Now, this is not to say that the original series was brilliant filmmaking or a treasure trove of movie goodness, but it never once sank to the depths of darkness and despair that has consumed this newest franchise. The aspects that made the original John Carpenter classic so intriguing were as follows: Michael was a mystery to the audience, the story constantly kept a steady pace, the characters were moderately interesting, and whenever an attack were about to occur the suspense was so palpable that it could be cut with a knife.

With Rob Zombie's revisionist look at the series all the suspense has been stripped away and replaced with an in your face approach that leaves nothing to the imagination and excessive gore that rivals the ""Saw"" franchise. The plot plods along at a meandering pace for much of the time. For example, how many times must we be shown Michael just walking around? I get it, the man doesn't really drive or run anywhere he goes, he has to walk, point taken. Then, there's the odd psychological elements included in the movie that are more distracting than illuminating. The intentions of these scenes is to give us some insight into Michael's inner psyche; however, the scenes come off as being an amateurish and pathetic attempt to make the movie seem smarter than it could ever hope to be.

Honestly, these film work best when less time is spent on explaining the reasoning and driving forces for these villains. If Zombie would have paid better attention, the original franchise went south when the writers started trying to explore what made Michael tick, rather than just leave his story be with what was revealed about his and Laurie's connection in the second film. This movie's running time of nearly two hours could have been trimmed down by at least 30 minutes had we removed all the unnecessary walking bits or the nonsensical, ponderous moments showcasing Michael's inner neurosis.

Another oddity to me is the fact that the characters swear with almost every other word that is spoken. I know that they're supposed to be teenagers, some of which have survived some decidedly grisly events, but I think one would be hard-pressed to find any true teenager that has a vocabulary so limited that cuss words are used for the majority of their adjectives, verbs, and so on. To me, I think Rob Zombie takes the approach when making a movie that he is going to take every aspect to the extreme even if it sacrifices realism and/or becomes irritating and disrupts the flow of the movie. Either that or this is an example of just how limited his vocabulary truly is. Who knows?

Now, that I feel I have sufficiently torn into the bulk of the film and its shortcomings, let's discuss the cast for a moment. Out of the entire film, the primary cast members are the only elements that can receive even a glimmer of praise.

Leading the cast is Scout Taylor Compton reprising her role as Laurie Strode. Scout does a passable job of trying to keep Laurie grounded without going too overboard in the hysterics while coping with her nightmarish memories. Although, she does go a little crazy in a few scenes and out of the entire cast she is the primary culprit for using expletives incessantly. As I pointed out above, the constant battery of four letter words does begin to distract. Not to mention, take away from the proceedings, plus making Laurie seem uneducated due to such a restricted vocabulary.

The supporting cast is essentially comprised of the other survivors from the previous movie. Malcolm McDowell as Dr. Sam Loomis, who was one of the best parts of the previous film, is flat-out irritating in this installment. For whatever reason Loomis is now a glory seeking media hound who is trying to find his fame by capitalizing on Michael's murderous rage. Previously, Loomis was a sympathetic character who only wanted to help Michael and then stop him in the end due to his feeling responsible for his continued existence (much the same way as Donald Pleasence's version of Loomis had done). However, in this film, there is only the slightest glimmer of that Dr. Loomis lurking within, and what has replaced him is a narcissistic man who lives solely for the limelight. Despite this change in character, Malcolm does handle this new Loomis very well and makes his purported self-importance believable in every scene.

Rounding out the supporting cast is Brad Dourif and Danielle Harris as Sheriff Brackett and his daughter Annie, respectively. Neither of these two characters really got to do all that much in this film. Both were much more involved in the previous movie, but this time around were relegated to the background and only popping up to provide some arguably questionable moral support for Laurie.

Lastly, Rob Zombie's wife, Sheri Moon Zombie, does appear several times throughout the film, mainly during the moments spotlighting Michael's inner thoughts. Her performance was fairly one-note, nowhere nearly as emotional or intriguing as she had been in the previous film. Plus, her scenes in this movie were some of the most boring and drawn out in the entire film. Her character would have been better off left in the sole flashback sequence seen at the beginning of the movie, as this was the most engaging moment for her character.

Not that this is necessary, but in summation, this movie is an absolutely dreadful piece of cinematic garbage that should have remained in the recesses of Rob Zombie's twisted imagination. Containing only scant moments of interest yet filled to the brim with unreasonable amounts of gore, violence, and language. ""Halloween 2"" is by far one of the worst films ever created for any genre, and that's saying a lot.

""Halloween 2"" is available in rated R and unrated editions; both contain pervasive violence, language, and nudity.",1263772800,4,8514,4.882352941176471
3066804,1,B0011G6FDI,"I am a fan of Zombie and can say I am one of the few that enjoyed ""House of a Thousand Corpses"" and it's sequel.
I was disappointed when he decided to take on remaking ""Halloween"" for the simple reasoning that It's a remake.
I rather have seen a new story being told by Zombie rather than retelling one. I liked his ""Halloween"" but wasn't thrilled by it. I have issues with him changing the idea of Michael Myers of being a mystery and that he is the ""Boogie man"" to an over long epic of his childhood which was all Zombie to then a full fledge remake.
Now here comes ""Halloween 2"" a complete mess that makes the original sequel from 1980 look like a masterpiece in horror. Zombie has to be kidding with his art film-ish visions with ghosts and a white horse. Ok Rob nice why don't you make this art horror film but use an original concept instead of using the ""Halloween"" franchise and it's characters to do It? and BTW you're NOT David Lynch! This movie is just a mess of unoriginal bits and pieces of other ideas. Anyone that says Zombie is a master of horror hasn't seen many older classic horror films to realize he just comes across as a hack with this piece of crap.  There isn't much going on in this opus of crap. Michael wanders around in a field in a hood and a beard., while his mother the ghost trails behind with a white horse (should have been a unicorn, imo). Dreams... Kills a few idiots More dreams...  and then Laurie cries and screams and cries, not because she's being stalked by Michael, no she's having mental issues ...More more dreams.. and I wished Michael would come and end her misery cause she Is so damn annoying.  The ghost and her horse keep showing up and to then start appearing in front of Laurie... ZZzzzzz

3066806,1,B0011G6FDI,"OK I have always thought that the most over rated and useless profession that ever existed is that of a movie critic. However after having just watched this movie I feel compelled to throw in my own opinion even though by my standards it makes me the fool.

  First let me say I love the work of Rob Zombie. His movies have always stood out because of the outstanding cinematography excellent writing and most of all (for me anyway) is the fact that even the most twisted characters were genuinely likeable.

  So this movie did not surprise me in that the cinematography and writing are up to his usual standards, however the most important ingredient in any movie is missing. In my own opinion this movie does not have one single likeable character or even one to sympathize with. I don't know if RZ was trying to make Michael Myers into the sympathetic character by making every on else in the film so un likeable. If this was his intention he picked the wrong character to do this with as MM is by nature a mindless unfeeling killing machine, and who can sympathize with that ? Maybe its just me and I was supposed to like and feel for the female lead, but it wasn't that I felt ambiguous toward her, I actually disliked her. If we were supposed to actually like any of these characters then this was the worst job of casting ever.

  Anyway this is why I think movies critics are worthless pieces of s**t, because we all like different things and for someone to think that their opinion is that of the rest of us should tell you something about their inflated sense of self worth. After all back in the day many critics said ""Gone with the wind"" was a terrible movie. The only reason I wrote this is I'm pissed I spent $19 on the DVD.

3066808,4,B0011G6FDI,"Ignore my review for the first one. After seeing RZ'S first two movies, I have newfound respect for what he did with Halloween and it's sequel.
Let me start by saying after watching the first one a couple times that it grew on me-and Rob Zombie contacting John Carpenter saying he wanted to 'redo his Halloween' when JC said 'make it yours' and he did. The language is kind of excessive, but the storyline in these makes up for that.
I recently saw Devil's Rejects and 1,000 Corpses-didn't care much for them, but Rob's version of Halloween, I like em. I also like Sherri Moon Zombie in both films as Michael's mother, but a few other charecters stand out as well, Brad Dourif does a nice job as Sherrif Brackett, and Malcolm McDowell does a decent Dr. Loomis, but to me these films should be taken on their own merits and not compared to JC's classic, although with a horror classic this well known, comparing is hard...not to do.
I'm not saying that RZ'S version is better, in fact, his version is alot darker, but in many ways he didn't just re-make the story, he re-invented the franchise. Any fan of Michael Myers can certainly appreciate what Rob came up with, although I'm sure some people who enjoyed JC's won't like this one, some won't, but you know what they say' don't judge a book by it's cover, basically, give both of these a chance before assuming you won't like em.",1263600000,3,1382,4.50996015936255

3066810,5,B0011G6FDI,"No, you don't have to be a degenerate to enjoy director Rob Zombie's violent remake/sequel of ""Halloween 2."" Director Rick Rosenthal's original ""Halloween 2"" (1981) qualified as a one-dimensional, no-brainer sequel bloodbath with stabalicious Michael Myers prowling a hospital and killing everybody in sight, not always with a knife. Michael assumed a supernatural omnipotence in ""Halloween 2"" and he survived virtually everything, even being blinded by Laurie. Nevertheless, ""Halloween 2"" told us nothing new about Michael other than he derived satisfaction from killing more people in different ways. Writer & director Zombie doesn't make this mistake with ""Halloween 2"" and it is virtually as brilliant and psychologically insightful as its predecessor. The cinematography and the songs, especially ""Nights in White Satin"" by the Moody Blues, enhance the atmosphere of this chiller. Zombie's ""Halloween 2"" is a surreal saga and a commentary about family values. This remake of ""Halloween 2"" is far more ambitious, gruesome, and psychological than the original.

Briefly, in the prologue, Zombie flashbacks to 10-year old Michael at the mental asylum conversing with his mother (Sheri Moon Zombie of ""House of 1000 Corpses"") about a white horse that she has given him. The first thing we see is a definition of a white horse and that it symbolizes the rage of the protagonist. Meanwhile, the Michael that talks with his mom is the Michael before he retreated behind the mask. Sure, it is unfortunate Zombie couldn't bring back Daeg Faerch to reprise his role as young Michael. According to Zombie, young Faerch had grown too old to play a 10-year old. Nevertheless, Chase Wright Vanek brings his chilly presence to the role, resembling a murderous munchkin.

Thereafter, Zombie's ""Halloween 2"" replicates the original as ambulances deliver both Laurie and Annie (Danielle Harris) to Haddonfield Hospital where the emergency room physicians perform miracles, especially the hacked up Annie. Meanwhile, Sheriff Brackett (Brad Dourif of ""Dune"") orders the coroner to lock up Michael's body until he can examine it. No sooner have the two sleazy attendants loaded Michael and driven off than they slam into a cow on the highway, killing the driver instantly, smashing up his partner, and allowing Michael to escape. At the hospital, Laurie isn't doing so well. Laurie is frantic about Annie and she still suffers from the trauma of having emptied a revolver into Michael. Just as she is regaining her grip on reality, Michael comes a-slashing and nobody can keep him out. He chases a hysterical Laurie during a storm around the hospital and corners her in the security guard shack with a fire axe. He chops his way into the shack, but Laurie manages to escape.

Indeed, Laurie escapes by waking up. Dreams, hallucinations, and nightmares pervade ""Halloween 2"" and you can never be sure when reality is real. Michael is driven by the image of a giant white horse held on a rope by his dutiful mom Deborah, with himself standing alongside her as an angelic 10-year adolescent. Family solidarity means a lot to Michael, and Michael has sworn to reunite the family, even if it means butchering Laurie like a steer. However, Zombie shows us a deeper, psychic linkage between Laurie (Scout Taylor-Compton) and Michael. When Michael (Tyler Mane of "" Troy "") slaughters a dog and dines on it, Zombie cross-cuts images of Michael devouring the dog with Laurie eating a pizza. Psychically, Michael and Laurie groove on the same wavelength and Laurie winds up vomiting. because she can taste the dog meat. Without spelling it out in dialogue, Zombie tells us it is this deep, psychic connection between Michael and Laurie as blood kin that enables him to track her down.

Life after Halloween has not been a picnic for Laurie. She visits her therapist (Margo Kidder of ""Superman""), works at an old hippie-style coffee house run by none other than Howard Hesseman of ""WKRP in Cincinnati ,"" and hangs out with two trippy girlfriends. Repeatedly, Laurie has lurid nightmares about Michael's attacks, but Michael is nowhere nearby. Indeed, he has gone into hiding in the woods, until two pugnacious rednecks catch up with him and too late realize their error. Like the original ""Halloween 2,"" Laurie doesn't know she is related to Michael Myers, and this revelation scrambles her brain.

Laurie Strode is the chief protagonist in ""Halloween 2"" and the film justly belongs to Scout Taylor-Compton as she struggles to survive. She lives now with Annie and her father at their rural house. Not only does ""Halloween 2"" look different from its predecessor, but also Zombie emphasizes the rural quality of the area. In his remake of ""Halloween,"" we were trapped along with the principals in what appeared to be a rural suburb. ""Halloween 2"" takes us back to the woods. Michael spends his time communing with nature and the visions of his mother, the white horse, and himself as an innocent adolescent before he resumes his murderous ways.

Not surprisingly, the violence in ""Halloween 2"" is gruesome but not sickening. In other words, we rarely see close-ups of the knife penetrating flesh. Zombie's favorite tactic is to let Michael strike just as things are calming down and part of this involves sudden movements and things like glass or wood shattered by his fists. There are moments when the violence takes on a traumatic weight that will scare the daylights out of the squeamish while gorehounds may yawn at some of Zombie's discretions.

""Halloween 2"" is both a triumph in style and substance with an ending that suggests Zombie may pull the biggest surprise in the franchise should the saga continue.",1263513600,5,5685,5.080299785867238

It was just wierd! And Loomis being an arrogant p***k with an ego bigger than Tyler Mane!!! Hated that!

And....my biggest pet peeve with sequels: If you can't get the same actors from the first movie, DO NOT write a part for that character in the sequel with a different actor! (young Michael)! I F'ING HATE THAT!!!!!

I like Sherry Zombie in The Devils Rejects (one of my faves) but not in this sequel. Her and young (different actor) Michael are just irritating and out of place in this flick.

The kill scenes are great and violent but we don't get to see enough. I like the gory stuff and want to see EVERYTHING. I'm sick like that. The head stomp was pretty good and effective though.

Anyhow....the whole walking cross country and Michael kicking it in barns was just wierd to me. If someone else understands where the hell he was walking from and where the hell he was chillin for 2 years, then feel free to let me know.",1263427200,4,1581,4.446366782006921

3066817,5,B0011G6FDI,"When creating anything in this world one must be true to oneself. Trying to second guess what other people want is pointless and will never produce honest work. With so many remakes out there today, especially of horror film classics, it is important to add something new and fresh beyond fast camera work and digital effects. I feel Zombie has put his heart and soul into this film and made the best film he could possibly make. it feel like he made it for himself and that honesty and conviction shows through in the film to me. For a film like this to resonate with me it needs to have something new. Zombie added his own take on the who, what, when, where, and why and peppered it throughout with homages, nods, and new ideas.

I can see how people might come away thinking all that white horse stuff was just a bunch of mumbo jumbo but for me it added an artistic dimension to the film. It gave me something new to think about. It also made me curious about Zombie a bit more. He is obviously a well read person, even if his reading material may not be the same taste as mine.

The idea of Michael as some Terminator of destruction was toned down and as to the bullet he received in the head in H1, well, it at least can be speculated on. Bullets do go into peoples heads and they live. Sometimes it happens. I come at a film like this differently than i would a film form an other genre. Horror films have a stigma and strikes against them already. To me there are only a few horror films that take it seriously enough to consider it art at all. Most films like this are tongue in cheek and use the cliche language of a thousand horror films past as a roadmap. While Zombie clearly used this language and gave us a few traditional ""cat scares"" there was enough of a departure from this early on for me to get deeply hooked. There was also a realism, power and intensity in this and H1 that I enjoyed greatly.

The power and raw energy that Zombie imparts to Michael is exactly what makes these 2 films of his so great to me. While not unstoppable Michael is still more ferocious than he was in any of the originals. I see Michael as force of nature here, similar to Anton Chigurh in No Country For Old Men. The allusions that are made with Michael to the dark side of man and what horrors we are capable of is the core of what is at work in these 2 films. The originals and many other slasher films may have this in them too, but I suspect Zombie knows this and pushes this aspect of what it is about horror films that make us love them and flirt with so much death. Our mortality and the unknown forces at work in us and what truly makes us tick is important to many slasher films. Rather than just make another unstoppable killer we care little for, Michael in these films and this one in particular is given what often lacks in 99% of films like this...motivation. Michael is motivated to make his family complete again. He is bitter about all that went wrong in his life. His internal clockwork is all messed up and he has been left with little else but a few fond memories he clings to an distorts to achieve what he hopes will make him complete.

The character of Laurie Strode is given more to work with in this film too. She has her demons that haunt her and a metaphysical connection between her and Michael is alluded to, suggesting that perhaps there may be something wrong with that family or there may just be a connection between the two of them. In H1 Michael did care for her when she was a baby and saw her as a pure untainted soul. When he finally go to her in this film he did not mindlessly kill her but rather contemplated her and the gravity of a complete family and what that means.

My complaints with this film are mostly with the Loomis character. He was not the same character from H1 and I did not care for the change. I saw what Zombie was pushing with him as a media shilling for money but felt this aspect of our society could have been toned down a bit and was unnecessary here. There was too much departure to all that talk show stuff that felt out of place and could have been made better with inserted news footage or just less Loomis in general. This was my one complaint. Still I am sure Zombie thought long and hard about all that stuff and to him it was what he wanted. For his efforts and delivering what I feel was a way above par film for a genre that usually produces unwatchable garbage (Saw films) almost every time, I commend him. Zombie has made an honest film and despite the faults it is still a gem in my opinion and worth a few more viewings for sure.",1263340800,5,4608,4.2318181818181815

People are used to Michael Myers being a mindless killing machine, having no motivation but to just kill everyone. Well, while the visions of his mother and himself as a boy are a little wierd, do you expect normal thoughts to be flowing through the head of Michael Myers? I don't, and neither should you. Just take this movie for what it is, a different view of Halloween and the killer himself. Even his sister, angel myers (Laurie Strode), played by Scout Taylor-Compton, has gone crazy and is slipping into a dark world herself. There are also references to the older movies involved, such as the end of the movie where Laurie or Angel seems to be under the influence of Michael, just as Danielle Harris was in the end of Halloween 4. Also, this movie actually packs alot of emotion, you will actually find yourself feeling genuinely sad in certain parts of the movie. Change of pace, but a great movie.

His wife adds a great touch taking Michael through his ravages and keeps him focused on the mission at hand.  Reuniting the family - come here sister!  Great job once again.

3066832,5,B0011G6FDI,"Rob Zombie a master of the horror-genre. Like all masters-of-their-craft, he has perspicaciously developed and tuned his own ""touch"" or panache in creating his art. From H1000C, Devils Rejects, and onto H 1&2, his style has ostensibly matured.

I find it absurd that people are displeased with this film. It seems people expected a re-make which would simply reproduce the original product. However, since this was not his directive in the first rendition, it only follows that the sequel would be even further driven in its own direction (away from the original series). With that, we are given a whole new Michael Myers, and a whole new Halloween. This is not an extension of the overwrought series seminal of early classics; rather, it is a monster of its own. Depicting the greatest figure of horror from a new, modern, and most importantly, Zombie perspective.

Zombie adds, and exposes, new dimensions of the ice cold killer. He approaches the characters with a modern approach. The new, greed driven, and orotund Loomis. The deeply disturbed, haunted, and seemingly telepathically connected to her ""Big Bro""Laurie Straud. Although, this version seems to lack an overt ""Ahab"", I think the Sheriff coupled with Laurie's need to rid herself of her pathogenic hex, can assume this role. Further, the infusion of the ""navigational"" apparitions of Michael's mother and the human remnants of Michael, as a child, are chilling and highly intriguing; which also pays homage to the role of ""mother"" in Friday the 13th.

The movie is great, it is deep and at the same time presents classic Halloween brutality with no remorse.

Zombie deserves the deference of a horror legend, I cannot wait for what he gives us next!",1263340800,3,1714,5.024647887323944

3066834,4,B0011G6FDI,"I went into this movie expecting the worse. I had read the negative reviews and being a long time Halloween fan I was worried this would be another ""Resurrection"" type of failure. But being the Halloween fan I am, I had to check it out regardless. Let me say that on its own it is a pretty decent movie. In my opinion you have to go into it with a blank slate, forget all you remember about the older movies, or this one will frustrate you. I was a little put off by the mask-less, semi-vocal Micheal, and the new actor for young Mike, but it seemed to work for this movie. Parts of this film that I did enjoy were the homage's to the Halloween films of the past. No matter what Rob Zombie has said, the homage's are too apparent to disregard. And Brad Dourif really seemed shine in this one. for me he was the stand out actor of the entire film. Very good job!

Overall I'm satisfied with this film. It's not a remake, not a sequel to the old movies, it's a standalone sequel to the 2007 remake (if that makes sense). I am glad I saw the Directors cut first. I hear its the better version. I will eventually check out the theatrical cut, but I'm satisfied with this version so I'm in no hurry to do so. I don't know that I'm ready for the upcoming H-3d,I think it is too soon for another sequel but I will give it a chance like I did this film.

3066837,4,B0011G6FDI,"I gave this movie 4 stars. I waited to see the movie because I was skeptical of it. I heard it getting trashed, but then I was slightly surprised when I saw it. A total of 2-3 years is suppose to have passed regarding this sequel. What we get is more of Zombie's delving into the human psyche, than an actual remake of the Halloween film. It has plenty of social undertones in it, and if you don't watch with a close eye, and a relative understanding of what's actually being done here then you'll likely won't appreciate the movie, and you'll turn into a mind less critic.

I'm interested in the directors cut because Laurie's healing is supposed to be traded in for a much darker experience. We also find that Michael is living inside his own head, and the results are a mixed bag. Michael believes either his mother is angel from heaven (that explains the white horse) or we get the feeling she is a demon trying to fool him. The mask plays a more relevant role in this film. We tend to find that Michael's identity is that mask. So when you do see him out of that mask he is just blank, devoid of all human emotion, but the identity inside that mask brings forth a monster that even Jason himself could not become. Michael is filled with unbridled rage, and you get a lot of grunting, and a hell of a lot of screaming in one particular scene. I read one review about a face less Michael screaming ""die!"" but that wasn't the same movie I was watching.

Loomis after his egotistical stint of apparently failing Michael has for whatever reason not gotten any better. In fact Loomis doesn't even redeem himself until the end of the movie but unlike some reviewers I am not going to spoil it. What we find here is Loomis has authored a ""Non Fiction"" book where he examines Michael, and instead of admitting his failure he has instead let success go to his head and corrupt his heart. Couple that with Annie's sympathy, and you're instantly at odds with what Loomis has become. This is the kind of tension you look to get lost in.

The end of the movie itself was completely the opposite of what I was going for. And any effort to ignore this in Halloween 3D is just an injustice itself. But I guess time will tell.

Some times people can get caught up in trashing a movie, or feel like their expectations are never going to be met that they can't appreciate something different. Halloween 2:The Theatrical Cut is definitely not for everybody. I'll be buying the directors cut on DVD & after I view it I'll post a second review regarding the difference.",1263254400,4,2551,4.409766454352441

3066840,2,B0011G6FDI,"I keep reading how Zombie was suppose to have made this movie from his own thoughts: You know, his version. We all know that this is the case because clearly it is nothing like the original. The first version of Halloween that Zombie did wasn't THAT bad, it was actually pretty nice to see Michael rise up again(for this new generation I mean). What I don't understand is why Zombie didn't just do a REMAKE of the original part II and then for PART III do his own thing. Then there wouldn't be so many expectations for him to follow the original second one; and, in more ways then one, he could have completely wrote the script for it. The Season of the Witch wasn't a bad movie, it just wasn't Myers-y. This was probably due to the fact that John wasn't going to do the Halloween series movies like the Friday the 13th series. He had originally planned on killing Myers off in the second one and the Season of the witch was going to begin a completely spin off and so on. The fan of course. --- Either way. This movie wasn't so bad, but it just wasn't the Myers style. The killings were kind of cliche(though good enough to see). However the fact that the Theme wasn't in the movie and that Michael didn't have his mask for half of the movie is what sort of ticked most people off. Sure. The theme in itself was like an important page to completing the ""picture perfect"" book -- so was the mask(sort of how they completely ruined Freddy's voice in this new remake: which will completely throw people off of the original vibe). I guess you just have to be open for new things.

Personally I wish the guy would stop here before he ruins all the 7 classic halloween movies (counting Halloween H20.)  The movie was disgusting with its burn victim operations a miserable replacement for the dead actor that played the original Dr. Lomus.  It missing on the lighter notes like the couple in the hospital hot tub that brought some humor to the original Halloween 2.  I never like the idea of knowing the face behind Micheal's mask.  Just as his first Halloween movie felt like a combo of one and 2 the Halloween raves in this movie has a Curse of Micheal Myers feel to it as well as other elements of the film remind one of Return of Micheal Myers and Revenge of Micheal Myers. Also part of what made Myers character so great in original films is not knowing the man behind the mask never even seeing the pupils in the mask eye sockets. Rob Zombie with his childhood background scenes takes away what made the character mysterious and interesting as a horror movie killer.,1263254400,2,1060,4.587301587301587

Scenes are extended to give us more context. And the acting all around has improved dramatically. Its a shame he didn't get the chance to release his cut of the film, but I sincerely believe once people give this one a shot they will be pleasantly surprised at the depth and feeling this movie has, and I have to say in a morbid way I was quite moved by the finale.

3066871,1,B0011G6FDI,"Contrary to many die hard fans of John Carpenter's original classic, I enjoyed Rob Zombie's 2007 remake of Halloween for what it was.  Being a huge success, a sequel is naturally the next stage of the game, and here we are with Halloween II, which finds Zombie destroying any and all good will that he probably ever had.  Beginning right after the last film, with Laurie Strode (Scout Taylor-Compton) still in shock from her ordeal with Michael Myers (Tyler Mane) in a segment that sort of finds Zombie paying homage to Rick Rosenthal's original Halloween 2, which shockingly enough winds up being a better sequel than this one.  From that point forward, we see Laurie pick up the pieces of her life with fellow survivor Annie (Danielle Harris) and her father the Sheriff (the great Brad Dourif), while Dr. Loomis (Malcolm McDowell) profits off of Michael's rampage and familial link with Laurie with a best-selling tell-all book.  And oh yeah, Michael is still alive (and looking like a homeless Alan Moore) and wreaking all sorts of bloody havoc.  The biggest question that appears to the viewer during watching Halloween II is just what isn't groan worthy?  Is it the dream sequences that feature the dead mother (Sheri Moon Zombie) and young Michael (Chase Vanek) with a white horse in tow?  Is it the pointless, senseless brutality that by this point just seems more boring than anything else?  Or is it Zombie's surprisingly hackneyed script, direction, and shifted characterizations (the take on Dr. Loomis here is lightyears in contrast to the one we saw the last time around, or seen at all for that matter) that ultimately kill Halloween II?  All that and the ultra predictable ending, which we've seen a version of before, all help ruin something that could have been interesting at the least.  All in all, whether you enjoyed or hated Rob Zombie's 2007 remake of Halloween, avoid Halloween II by any and all costs, you'll be glad you did.",1262304000,2,1950,4.846385542168675

And what the hell did rob zombie do? He gave the fans a Halloween 2 with no fear or scares. The only thing that stands out is the violence and I'm not impressed. I'm pissed off that he turned Dr. Loomis into a completely unsympathetic money-hungry character, pissed off that the film offered no scares backed up by a musical score so frighteningly perfect that it became a ringtone. Zombie was quoted as saying Carpenter's music did not fit with what was happening in the film.

In no way would I go in to this movie thinking hospital night revisited - if wanted that I'd watch the original, which is great movie but...so is this totally different reuse of some original characters.

He pulls out all the stops and gives us his version of a Halloween that could never be, but now always will.  I don't think he ruined anything.

STARRING:  Scout Taylor-Compton, Tyler Mane, Brad Dourif, Malcolm McDowell, Shari Moon Zombie, Danielle Harris, oh yeah and `Weird Al' Yankovic

WRITTEN BY: Rob Zombie

DIRECTED BY: Rob Zombie

Rated: R
Genre: Horror
Release Date: 28 August 2009

Rob Zombie's 2007 remake of Halloween was hands down one of the best horror films of the last decade; then came Halloween II.

The film opens up with another child-actor playing a young Myers back at the asylum with his mother (Sheri Moon Zombie) who brings him his toy horse.  I would love to know why they weren't able to get the same kid from the previous film to reprise his role as Michael. He did a phenomenal job and watching all of the special features, he had an absolute blast with the role. This new kid isn't creepy and is nowhere near the actor the other kid was. I was immediately disappointed by this.  The entire opening was slow and weak.

Things pick up a bit and we're right back where we left off from the first film. All the rest of the original cast is back, thank God. The next 15 minutes or so were done very well; lots of gore, great acting, amazing cinematography; all paying homage to the classic hospital sequence of the original sequel. Good stuff. Michael is kicking butt and not caring to take names.

And then, Laurie Strode (Scout Taylor-Compton) wakes up and the entire sequence was apparently a dream. Wow, we just wasted 15 minutes. Okay, so we go with it and learn that Laurie Strode is no longer the quiet innocent virgin she once was. Apparently she has had some trouble adjusting to the painful memories of the previous Halloween night; transforming her into a dark misfit with ratty hair, grungy clothes and even a token tramp stamp tattoo. It's understandable she'd change but it feels too much like Rob Zombie and not like Halloween.

Then we meet back up with Dr. Loomis (Malcolm McDowell).  My first instinct was to discredit him for his performance but then I found myself realizing that it wasn't his fault; the entire character was changed from the charming hero he was in all of the other films, into an egotistical, self centered butt-head.  Where did this come from? Loomis spends about 95% of his screen time trying to soak up his 15 minutes of fame from his new book. If he's not doing that, he's just being flat out rude to everyone he comes into contact with.  Why was he changed into such a jerk-off?

And oh yes, there's the new and improved Michael Myers (Tyler Mane). Or as I like to call him: Jason Voorhees-Myers, because he's now every bit of a mamma's boy as Jason.  He sees his mother (who killed herself in the previous film), often with a large white horse (I'm guessing the toy horse?) and a younger version of himself, taunting him to kill; as if that's not enough, now he apparently grunts with anger when he slays his victims, which bothered me severely.  We see him eat, we see his eyes way too often and he must be cold because he wears a hoodie for a good portion of the film. Yes that's right, a hoodie.  Zombie has added way too many human elements to Myers, making him dull and not scary at all. Traditionally what has made Myers terrifying, is he looks human but he's simply just not there behind that mask. That is why we go to see him. That is what makes him intriguing and horrifying.

There are also two huge ingredients missing from this film. One is THE SCORE. Where is the brilliant Halloween theme we have all come to love? It never shows up until the end credits start to roll. The movie feels so empty without it. And the second is sex. There are no sex scenes in this film; a few close calls, but no dice. We want to see some sex before we get our blood Mr. Zombie. It's a Halloween film for God's sakes!

With all of that as bad as it was, the third act was the most disappointing of all. I'm not even going to mention it in detail; mainly because I'm so confused by it my head may explode. Why did the sheriff seem to be more concerned for Laurie, than he was for his own daughter? Why did Loomis finally care enough to show up? Were we watching Cops or Halloween II? What was the point of the ending? I'm at a loss for words here.

One good thing about the film was the performance of the Sheriff played by the legendary Brad Dourif. His acting alone earned one whole star for this sad film in my book.

As much as I complained about Zombie's vision here, he is an amazing director. The scenes with the dead mother and the horse were creepy and the last scene of the film reminded me of something out of The Shining. He shows us awesome stylized camera shots and slow motion sequences. There's even a dramatic sad score playing when one of Michael's victims dies slowly; while I can appreciate all of those elements for how well they were filmed, I just don't understand what they are doing in a Halloween film.",1260921600,,4863,4.427130044843049
3066880,2,B0011G6FDI,"Probably one of the dumbest movies ever made.
Despite pretty-good acting, the story is just terrible. The original Halloweens were about nudity, suspense, and killing people in creative ways (ie. having their face shoved in liquid nitrogen then smashed on a table.) The first remake dealt more with Michael Myers' childhood and tried to expand on the original Halloween story. Not bad at all.
Halloween 2 is Rob Zombie's second shot at ""house of a thousand corpses"". Lots of people die, and lots of people say ""Fk"", and lots of ghosts, and visions, and dreams. Oh... and people say ""Fk"".
There are three stories in here:
1) Michael killing people. He kills everyone by stabbing them in the chest or throat, or smashing their head/face into things. Two ways. so... lots of the same thing over and over.
Oh... and people say ""Fk"".
2) The story of the Doctor. In this movie he is a complete self-centered, greedy, show-boating, media hog, trying to sell his book about michael.
3) Jessie Myers (Michael Myers' sister who survived the first film) who is in therapy now, and is all trailer-trash now, and just a waste of screen time with her outbursts, and mood swings.

Do not watch this.
Wolf Creek is 10 times better, and that is a 2 star film.
Even the new remake of Last House on the Left is much better then this trash.",1260921600,5,1320,4.617021276595745

The weird visions/dreams that Laurie Strode receives are very reminiscent of HO1C, it has the gritty look and feel of Devil's Rejects, and it takes the characters from the previous Halloween and instead of retreading the same story again, Zombie puts them into something entirely new and uncharted that was never attempted in the John Carpenter originals. Yes, it's extremely brutal and violent, but, it IS a horror movie, and a Rob Zombie one to boot, so what did you really expect out of it? Zombie said from the get-go that he set out to take the Halloween story and make it his own vision, which is exactly what he's accomplished with his two entries into this franchise. It's not high art, nor does it set out to be. It's a pure escapist, pop-corn genre flick, much in the vein of the exploitation movies that Mr. Zombie was weened on, and I applaud him for making it in such a fashion.",1260144000,5,1071,4.55440414507772

3066899,1,B0011G6FDI,"Rob Zombie manages the seemingly impossible with this sequel - make a movie that is actually worse than his first remake of ""Halloween"".

This is the man who was asked why he included the sister storyline in his first remake since that was a plot twist at the end of the original ""Halloween 2"", and said that he hadn't seen the movie in so long he forgot that wasn't part of the plot - one would think that *watching* the iconic movie you are remaking would be first thing on the list of a competent filmmaker, but not for this guy.

It follows that he never saw any of the subpar sequels to the original ""Halloween 2"", either, and is completely unaware of some of the scenes and bad ideas that had already been introduced to the ""Halloween"" franchise that he included in his ""Halloween 2"":

Escape from a crashed ambulance: Halloween 4

Revelation that a female relative is crazy, too, when she wears his clown costume and stabs someone: Halloween 4

A psychic connection between Michael and the disturbed female relation: Halloween 5

He also continues his trashing of the original characters:

Both Loomis and Laurie are badly-acted and unlikable characters.

The iconic image of the white mask and coveralls has been replaced; Michael's mask is now falling off his face, and there are actually a couple of times when we see him unmasked, and he looks exactly like Rob Zombie - bet that caused some chuckles on the set, huh Rob? And he now wears a hoodie (not making this up, honestly) and is referred to in internet circles as ""Hobo Myers"".

The classic ""Halloween"" music is not used until the very end of the movie, when we hear ""Laurie's theme"" and the classic main title.

And for someone who loved to offer simple-minded criticisms of the original ""Halloween"" (look up online/magazine interviews with Rob Zombie), he sure offers a lot of plot holes himself:

His Michael is human, not supernatural, but he manages to survive several gunshots, an ambulance crash, and can overturn a car with his bare hands.

How does he know where Laurie is staying?

In the first movie he stopped talking after his Mother died, in this one there's a flashback scene of him talking about his dead Mother.

In the first remake, Loomis had his eyes gouged out and was presumably dead. In this one, one year later, he is fine with no signs of injury.

In one interview during his first remake, Zombie made a sarcastic comment that his Michael would ""not be eating any dogs in this one"", but he includes a scene like this in ""Halloween 2"".

And as a hack writer/director with an inflated sense of self-worth because his inner circle dare not offer honest criticism, he offers his attempts to elevate this movie into a higher plane of celluloid existence by including scenes which he must have thought were ""arty"":

A white horse being led by a lady in white (Ghost Mommy Myers) that is the folie a deux of Michael and his sister, Laurie. These scenes are numerous and are laugh-inducing.

Also included are awful scenes that are intended to be funny or offensive, but are neither:

A man in a crashed vehicle saying the ""F"" word dozens of times in different inflections - a scene that defies belief in its awfulness.

A similar scene with Laurie, in a vehicle, saying the ""F"" word over and over again.

This film is ""99% my vision"" claims Rob Zombie, but why the Weinsteins, who are notorious for the control they have over the films they release, gave final cut to this man is a mind-boggling question that only they know the answer to.",1258329600,11,3524,4.615384615384615

And That Shocking Ending is Not Shocking
Laurie Strode taking over the Mantal of the killer WOW
That idea seems so Familiar ooohhhh yes Paramount did that with Friday the 13th 20yrs ago

I really like Rob Zombie's 1st two Films (Which he Created and can do anything with ""His""  Characters)

His Vision/Re-make of Halloween was good for what it was
He did allot of Good things  Between the Cast, A New Point of View on a Young Michael Myers

The Halloween Re-Make is Bye far the Best re-make of all The ""NEW"" Horror Films  (FT13, TX Chainsaw Massacre, Next will be the taking of  Nightmare on Elm Street)
Halloween II  Completely does two things
1. Takes away any credibility Rob Zombie may have had as a Hip New Horror Film Director
Take his writer/director's Hat away from his and burn it

It seems like Sherieff Bracket had the Dr. Loomis role for this movie,and Dr. Loomis was a sellout,Michael's new look i acutally liked because it was fresh,and Laurie Strode was the worst charcter in this movie,Annie Brackett was more of a survivor than Laurie in this movie.

This is ROB'S take on the series, a series that became a real joke after so many horrible sequels. So yeah it needed a HUGE reboot.  Horror has changed throughout the years, and what rob made was his version on current horror. I for one loved the brutality, intensity, and all out craziness and sadness that came with the film. Even Danielle Harris who plays annie loved it and was shocked by the hardcore direction he took.  People complained about the grunting, what do you think a guy with a knife does? yeah he's angry,just got shot in the face by his sister, and he's crazy, and when he attacks you, he's gonna make noise. duh.  He's expressing all that rage. This film had some amazing cinematography, a great score, intense scenes, and was a real horror film that stuck with me and my friends for days. I highly recommend you see it soon, the directors cut is coming with tons more footage with annie and lori along with many other scenes that rob had to cut due to time.  the gore wasn't trimmed, but theres plenty more scenes like the fight with annie n lori that will make the film make more sense.  If your into raw, gritty, non commercial horror, then you will love this shocking film. but like so many hollywood myers fanboys, they simply cannot handle the indie influence zombie brings.  The only bad parts were sherri moon, who i love, but did not fit in this film and the new younger myers, man he was bad. Other than that, brilliant work. A real balls out horror film. Not for the candy coated myers fans. Come on guys, watch some french horror films or something.

More interesting ""character"" scenes with Scout Taylor-Compton a particular stand-out in what would have been an Oscar-nominated performance in a ""Drama"".
Yeah, she's THAT good in this new cut!
There are NO bad performances in this film,though Zombie's wife is...to excuse the pun...""Zombiefied"" and the new ""little Mikey"" is not quite up to Daeg's original.

End of story! This H2 is totally unnecessary and totally lame. Just a big, elaborate and expensive excuse to show off Sheri Moon Zombie's ass on film once again. It tries to be too dramatic at times, too deep, too abstract, and falls flat. The only thing that made it even remotely enjoyable were the bit parts played by Howard Hessman and Weird Al Yankovic, and the brief playing of Diamonhead's ""Am I Evil?"" which was made famous by Metallica. The killings were routine, the shaky camera work was dizzying (I get that it's done for effect, but we also like to SEE what's happening), hardly any original John Carpenter Halloween score music which would have helped, the performances (especially Dr. Loomis) were annoying, and they couldn't even get the same kid to play young Michael - that was the biggest distraction. I am a big admirer of Rob Zombie, musician and director, but this film does not stand up to his previous 3... a fresh story with fresh ideas would suit his career better, I think.",1254441600,7,1243,4.680365296803653
3066920,5,B0011G6FDI,"I walked away from the first viewing of this film with just about everyone else's reaction, WTF? After getting over what I thought the film should be and accepting what it was, I found that I needed a second time around to have an unbiased oppinion of the film.
 I loved this movie, I have found that as much as liked the 07 installment, I have to go with this one as the great denoument that really pushes the violence to the level that Michael needs to be at, unbound and raw, a souless killing machine, a sympathetic monster.
 Granted this movie is chuck full of continuity errors and annoying acting, but I for one came to see Michael do his thing and I got just that. The death scenes were the best I've seen so far, that first nurse's death made me feel both perspectives of a murder from the killer and victim perspective that it set my teeth on edge. Also let's not forget the great look and feel of a Halloween based Haddonfield that has not been topped in any Halloween film before, I'm still searching as to where I can find the giant evil pumpkin king decoration at the party scene.
 I think everyone's major problem with this as was mine at first is that this film is not what you expected from the series, like the original Halloween 3 it is a different film that really sets the essence of Halloween in full.
 One more thing, why the beard? Why the hair in the face in the last film? BECAUSE THESE ARE MASKS TOO! The shot of Tyler Mane's face when the little kid bumps into him on the street is freaking scary, he looks like a stone cold crazy very effectively.
 The bottom line is, see this film. If you didn't like it because it wasn't what you expected, see it again, you might be suprised at what you think about it after leaving your preconceptions at the door.

3) suggestions that said female family member is psychotic, too (Halloween 4).
4) same female family member wearing Michael's clown costume and holding a sharp object to do bodily harm (Halloween 4).

Third ingredient: complete disregard for any of the icons of the series:

1) no classic ""Halloween"" music until the closing credits.

- Myers looked like Frankenstein in a hoody.
- He didn't even wear the mask for more than half of the film.
- Where was Haddenfield in this movie? These films were suppose to take place in a middle class town.
- Everyone was dirty and down right disgusting. What was the deal with the Sheriff's house and the graffiti all over the inside?
- What happen to Laurie and her friends? They went from high school girls to suicide girls.
- Dr Loomis, a complete arrogant jerk who all of the sudden has a change of heart at the end. Wow that was original.
- The Halloween theme was no where to be found.
- Non-stop slow motion.
- Jumping from place to place to kill to kill for no apparent reason.
- Non stop dream sequences, including the first 25 minutes of the movie!  The longest dream sequence in film history.
- Ghosts holding down Laurie?  Yes I said it right, ghosts in a Halloween movie!
- Laurie saying ""I love you brother"" after Michael ruined her life and killed everyone she knew?
- Sweeping shots of Michael walking in fields.

3066938,1,B0011G6FDI,"An opinion not a review. I loved Zombie's 2007 remake, but this sequel is a terrible let down. The best part of the movie is a dream laurie's having. The only time you hear any of the Halloween theme is at the end. For me that doesn't cut it. Zombie is a musician and he can't see the need in using the theme throughout this disaster of a movie?. It might have taken my mind off the fact that his wife isn't one of the greatest actors out there. This ridiculous plot involving her isn't an example of his creative mind at work, it's just a plain stupid way to have her in the whole movie. Thanks a million Rob. This just does not have the ""feel"" that a Halloween film should have. Haddonfield has turned in to a trailer park full of dirty looking characters who I never ended up caring about, especially Loomis. Loomis is the most unlikable character in the entire movie. So much so, that I caught myself wishing he wasn't in it at all. I loved the updated Loomis in 2007 but here I couldn't believe the changes that were made to what should have been an important character. See this for yourself and draw your own conclusion. If your even half a fan of the series you'll see a bad difference between this and a real Halloween film.

Continuity problem: There is a scene in this film where Loomis is at a convention for the book he has writen. Before he takes the stage to answer questions, the convention crowd is seeing a clip of him interviewing young Michael. He says to Him (I can't quote exact)""Your mother won't be coming to visit you any more....""
Michael answers him. In Zombies original Michael had stopped talking before his mother killed her self. So, Zombies not following the continuity he set for himself in the 1st film. All to support a storyline about connection.",1252195200,13,1782,4.416413373860182

With that being said I'm gonna get the ball rolling! This installment honestly left me leaving the theater in AWE! There was nothing funny about this film AT ALL it was just one sick trip into the mind of a madman/woman..(which ever angle you look at it). The kills got next to me (and yes i liked the fact that Michael grunted it made it more brutal)One kill that got next to me was Annie's...off screen, pitch black and nothing but grunts and screams (gives me chills just thinking about it)!Loved the fact that Loomis was an a$$hole..cuz honestly how many times do we see this type of person in everyday life! I like the fact that they opened up Sherriff Bracket's character more...he kinda got Laurie into this mess in the first one; but he didn't hang her ""out to dry"" he stepped in and had her living in his home!  Dealing with all the messed up stuff to follow! And his reaction to his daughter's death was ON POINT (as a parent to have your child escape on helluva night and then have to deal with the fact that you couldn't have protected her enough..sad)As far as the ""dream"" sequences yeah I could have did without 'em but I did realize that Michael still saw himself as a child being that they mimicked each others movements. This film was gritty, dirty, and raw as hell! And for the nay-sayers...I say this: Step back take a deep breath and realize that you put no money into making this film, this film is not YOUR film! Some of the reviews I've read seem to be more ""I'm gonna hate cuz everybody else is"" which is scary because I thought lovers of this genre don't give a F*%^& what everybody else thinks. That's why I'm a fan of Rob Zombie's movie...he doesn't care what you think and will tell you to your face...lol (sounds like me).

Now as a big horror fan I was also dissapointed in the fact that Michael was grunting throughout the film making odd noises. Not a big problem but kind of pushes a bit off the path Michael has traveled in the last 30 years...wow...30 years. Congratulations Mr. Carpenter.

The gore, and kill scenes throughout the movie were pretty good, possibly better than the first but the storyline just wasn't there. Anythang to put Rob's (Zombie) wife into the film I guess(she's in all of them!).

Overall a decent movie but I would put it in the same catagory as Halloween 3. Its worth to check out at the movies if you're bored, you may or may not like it depending on your standpoint on horror movies, especially classics.",1252108800,9,1011,4.508196721311475
3066953,1,B0011G6FDI,"Just like with Rob Zombie's 2007 re-make, my mind is racing with thoughts, feelings, and a sense of not exactly knowing what to say. Like many, I was horrified and disgusted when I heard that this classic was being re-made in the first place. Rob's re-make was far from great, littered with flaws and things I didn't like, would never of wanted for Michael Myers or a Halloween movie, but I actually kinda liked it. When the sequel came along, I was hesitant. This wasn't going to be a Halloween movie, but a full on Rob Zombie movie. And that's exactly what we got.

The plot, such as it is, picks up exactly after the last film's final moments. It's these first 15 minutes or so that are the best part of the entire movie. It's also a cheat. We pick up 2 years later and re-connect with Laurie Strode(Scout Taylor-Compton), who is living with the Bracketts(Sheriff and Annie), and is a total, goth, rock and roll chick who is barely hanging on. This is not Laurie from the first film. Meanwhile, Michael is living the hobo life(and looking like it), having artsy fartsy visions of his mother with her white horse, and decides to come looking for Laurie again. Oh, and Dr. Loomis(Malcolm McDowell)is a demanding diva, treated like a rock star, and on a book tour. More on that in a minute.

Where to start?. The problems with the re-make are still very much evident here. The horrendous dialogue, constant swearing(I'm no prude, but the ""F"" word coming out of everyone's mouth every 2 seconds gets old very fast and becomes pathetic), greasy, trashy, hillbilly people, slutty girls, and more of the backstory that tries, along with the visions, to ""humanize"" Michael, which was a huge mistake in the first, and continues that trend here. The movie and the kills are very brutal to the point of being stupid and pointless. Michael just doesn't kill people, he KILLS people. Way, way overdone. Speaking of the kills, they are of the ho-hum, mundane type. Nothing new or creative. Typical, run of the mill stuff that Michael lingers too long on. Some of Laurie's friends didn't have much screen time to get to know them well in the last, and the same is true here, except for Annie. What else?. Dr. Loomis. Malcolm McDowell does a good job, and clearly has fun with the character, but the doctor's characterization here is abominal. This is a Loomis nobody knows, and doesn't want too. Some of his book storyline is interesting, but it all feels disconnected with the rest of the film, and Loomis doesn't even have anything to do with what's going on until the last few minutes. Loomis feels tacked on and serves no real purpose being there. Finally, the visions of his mother and white horse is probably what's going to get a lot of people hating this movie. I really don't care what Michael sees in his head. I don't want to know. I don't want things explained to me. Zombie still doesn't realize that it's the ""unknown"" that makes someone like Michael Myers creepy and scary. It ruins the mystique and creepiness of the whole character. Not knowing who exactly is underneath that mask or why they are doing what they are doing, is what makes it interesting. Tyler Mane is imposing, but he's too big. Michael Myers is not 20 feet tall and built like a mountain. I don't care for the size or crashing thru walls or tossing people around like rag dolls. It's too Jason/Terminator.

Is there anything good?. Not much. McDowell has fun, Scout is okay in some scenes, but it's really the Brackett family that hold things together. Brad Dourif and Danielle Harris, returning as the Sheriff and Annie, are the acting standouts here. It's a movie about family, Laurie and Michael's, but the Brackett family are the acting stars here. I already mentioned the first 15 minutes. The best part of the movie. It's the only time the movie is remotely interesting or suspenseful, and the hospital with it's few Halloween decorations has some good atmosphere and tone. That completely vanishes later on.

I have nothing against Rob Zombie. He seems like a nice, intelligent guy, and he does have an eye for things, but it's just not computing with the Halloween series or the character of Michael Myers. I understand when he says why do it if it's the same thing?. Do something different. Great, but you can't completely change or remove very vital things and details that have come to make these movies what they are and why fans love them and keep coming back to see them. No Halloween music until the end credits!. It was an interesting experiment, Rob, but I am more than ready now for Michael Myers to be back at being the ultimate, shadowy, elusive boogeyman that scared the daylights out of me. Maybe the already announced ""Halloween 3D"" will do that.

Oh, and if you see the Director's Cut, you will bare witness to this Laurie Strode becoming the most annoying, unbearable horror movie heroine I have ever witnessed. You wished Michael finished her off in the opening moments and the heroine of this film was Annie. Just intolerable.

""Halloween II"" is no treat. There could of been an interesting, fun movie here, but it's a bit too weird and still too ""Rob Zombie"".",1252108800,7,5160,4.6586169045005486
3066954,3,B0011G6FDI,"The first time I saw the 2007 remake I was not impressed.  After several viewings, I started to see the Zombie-vision/revision of the classic and it grew on me.  I honestly began to feel more out of it than the original.  So, for the sequel, I was silently amped.
I've seen every Halloween movie at the theater(except the direct-to-video part 6), a tradition in our family  and I can tell you, the worst one I have seen at the theater is still Resurrection, even though part 5 and now this one are not too far behind.
  Atmosphere is something Zombie gets and doesn't get all at the same time.  He nails deep rooted ambience at moments when it is not needed (such as the interesting hospital intro) and then where he should finish us off, he sort of fumbles around (like throwing his wife in to give some meaning behind the massacre).  The shots are usually good, but for this flick, I was severely disappointed.  It did remind me a bit of part 6: the curse of michael myers in it's raw cheesiness.  The shots were too close, too obscure and relied heavily on imagination, which is fine, but if you're going to go all out with a brutal murder scene, give us a look-see, would you? I love the posters for this movie...they have a grainy texture that gives Michael a raw edge.  You don't get that in the film.  The photography on the posters is better than the cinematography of the film and I wish I was exaggerating.
  Dialogue is almost painful and character development is slow and bitter.  Sherriff Bracket is great and Loomis is also good (even though many will hate him in this one...a sign of good acting), as both bring light to true human nature.  I think the actors in Zombie's movies are actually getting bad direction and dialogue, so I can't blame them.
  Michael himself does a great job being the murder-some brother, but he looks awful.  I can sympathize with the idea of him becoming somewhat of a vagabond, but the classic look of the mask is all but gone, turning the 'shape' into the 'bum'.  He looked and acted far better in the first Zombie take on Halloween than this one.  And the kid who plays Michael is different, which is never a good thing in a sequel of any kind.  It shows a lack of budget and integrity. There are some great murder scenes, but due to clumsy editing, you won't see much.  Too bad ALL of the murder scenes were pretty much the same on this one.
  The whole mom and young Michael bit was weird and insubstantial and having ***SPOILER ALERT*** Laurie put on the mask at the end and become the next ""Michael' was a cliche trick we've seen before (end of Halloween 4).  Nice for Rob to give his old lady a part, but it wasn't needed and it hardly carried the movie in any way, or even made for an interesting artsy filler of any kind.  Maybe he just needs to make an entire movie about just his wife and get it out of his system already.  Anyways, the tie-in seems pointless.
  It's a sad movie because the pieces are there and I guess we can all hope when the DVD comes out, it's slightly better.  I wouldn't say it's as awful as some have said, but that's because I'm partial to the series, but it was missing a lot.  Don't expect much and you might be able to appreciate some things in it.  There was a masterpiece to be had here, but the crew seems tired, out of touch and unwilling to fulfill a vision of autumn terror.",1251936000,11,3366,4.342948717948718

The first Halloween remake, in my opinion, was excellent and I was craving more. RZ's Halloween 2 does not deliver...at all...ever. One huge mistake that makes this movie nearly unwatchable is that fact that you will not care about any of the characters....not one. There's nobody to cheer for. Whether you want to believe it or not, that is an important part of any movie. You want to be on somebody's side. I couldn't have cared less about any of the characters, even Laurie Strode! Yawn. Swearing in a film doesn't bother me, but in H2 it is just out of hand, sticks out like a sore thumb, and takes away from the credibility of the film. The acting overall is average at best. Sorry for you fans of the one-dimensional Sheri Moon, but she was just awful and her character in this film is simply annoying. The change to Dr. Loomis' character was really lame, and certainly did not bring out the best in Malcolm McDowell. RZ has made it clear in all of his films that the killings are going to be brutal. Halloween 2 is no exception. You can defintely feel Michael's anger when he decides to off someone. However, the majority of the killings are boring, repetitive, and become predictable. A sure sign of a bad horror film is when the audience laughs at a point where the director wants to establish fear, and the possibility of another sequel. If you watch this abomination, you will know what I'm talking about, as I'm sure your fellow audience members will laugh too.

3066957,5,B0011G6FDI,"DO NOT READ THIS REVIEW IF YOU HAVE NOT SEEN THIS MOVIE!!!!!!!!!!

I was a little worried about seeing this movie after reading some of the reviews out there.  I was a huge fan of the first remake and was hoping the sequel was not as bad as many made it out to be.  I must say I was very pleasantly surprised.  I left the movie theatre in awe!

You have to go into this movie with an open mind.  The first remake followed the original John Carpenter movie in many ways.  Many of the characters were the same and it followed a similiar story line adding a much more detailed development into the character of Michael Myers.  I loved that.  The sequel takes a sharp turn and goes into completely unfamiliar terrority.  This opened the door to give a fresh new outlook on the characters.  If you are looking for them to be anything like they were in the original Halloween movies, you will be extremely disappointed with this one.  This is especially true for Dr. Loomis' character.  He does become quite the money hungry, don't care who I hurt, jerk which quite honestly I found to very believable and refreshing.  There are always people out to make a buck from tragedy.  This is nothing new.  This is quite a drastically different character then who Donald Pleasance played, but that is what I liked about it.  I loved how Laurie's character changed as well.  We get a great view into her mental state after her experience from the events in the first movie.  I did not find the dream sequences confusing at all as many reviews have stated.  I felt they were all logical and fit the story line perfectly. We learn that Michael and Laurie have some kind of mental connection when she is eating pizza, and this explains why she later had visions of her biological mother and her brother at the age he was when he first started killing.  We already know that these visons are what was driving Michael to do what he was doing. I was curious how this would work because the whole reason the mother committed suicide was becuase she couldn't live with what Michael had become, so why would she all of a sudden be encouraging her son to kill?  The answer.  It is all in his mind.  When we see the video of Dr Loomis telling Michael his mother is dead, he gets it in his head at that time she will come back and that is how it manifested itself, in his mind.  This is actually one problem I have with the movie.  Michael stopped speaking before his mother died, so why did he speak after hearing about her death?

Some other problems that I had with this movie, but does not change my rating:

Sherriff Brackett seemed more upset at Dr. Loomis for spilling the beans about Laurie's biology then he was about his daughter just dying. One aspect of Michael's character is that he is silent, that should not change.  I did not like the grunting.  In the beginning, when the ambulance crashes, the amount of times the paramedic says f**k was just way too much!  When Laurie told Michael that she loved him, that was just cheesy, however at this point I think she had started to loose her sanity, and who can blame her after what she went through.  Dr Loomis denied the possibility of Michael still being alive without a body being found and blamed that on how the law enforcement handled the situation.  I don't think that kind of wishful thinking is logical at all especially for his character.  He is not a stupid man.

All in all, no movie is perfect, but I commend Rob Zombie for taking the direction he did with this movie. It was bold and unique. I completely enjoyed myself!  I look forward to buying it on DVD.",1251676800,8,3606,4.41060606060606
3066958,3,B0011G6FDI,"Hot on the heels of his 2007 remake of the John Carpenter classic, Rob Zombie has returned to resurrect his version of ""Halloween"" to the big-screen yet again in ""Halloween II."" Picking up where the original left off and re-uniting all surviving characters, you'll be pleasantly surprised to find a leaner and more meaner effort than the first, which is unfortunately still plagued by poor characters and weak story-telling. At the very least, though, you'll find ""Halloween II"" to be more of a ""Halloween"" film than its predecessor, and for some, that will be enough to satisfy their thirst.

To gives this film a few compliments: First off, the mood is unmistakably Halloween in this film. Make no mistakes about it: Rob's second entry in the franchise means business and has the cinematography to back it up. Not since maybe ""Halloween 4"" has the look and feel been nailed so brilliantly. Michael Myers is less of a character and more of a presence in this film when compared to Zombie's first take, and that's one of the other things Rob gets right this time around. While the portrayal of The Shape was pulled off menacingly enough by Tyler Mane in the previous film, a lot of the bite was taken out of the character by over-exposing him and shedding far too much light on a far too troubled past. Here, he is relegated to the shadows, living in the outskirts of Haddonfield and acting as an urban legend to the characters.  When he does appear and strikes -- as he so often does -- it is with maximum impact and brutality. Not only is this Michael Myers more mysterious, but he is also much, much more cruel and punishing than any version we've seen before.

In fact, part of what sets this film apart from any of the original eight films or even Rob's remake is the sheer magnitude of violence that is at hand. Completely opposite from John Carpenter's original version - and even the original ""Halloween II"" - this film is unrelenting and unflinching in its portrayal of Michael's wrath. Granted, it's not the goriest movie you'll find nowadays, and as far as effects go, it's tame compared to the previous film, but the way the violence is handled is in a blunt and all too realistic way. Almost like the exploitation films that Zombie admires so much, this is a film that presents its violence in a stark and ugly light. Michael grunts as he jabs his knife in and out of his victims just as anyone exerting any such force would do, and the results make a more human and, in turn, more frightening incarnation of the character than we have seen in a long while. Unfortunately, though, Michael Myers is the only character in this film that is handled with any care, and in turn, the sheep lined up for his slaughter are a faceless bunch.

Enter Laurie's new group of pals, whom are dispatched before we even get to know them. Then there are the countless people Michael picks off during little intermissions within the narrative. These moments are, for all intents and purposes, filler, and reveal just what a rushed product Rob's sequel really is. Then, of course, we have the return of the surviving characters from the previous film. Danielle Harris ties Jamie Lee Curtis with most appearances in the franchise with her reprisal of Annie, who still lives with her Dad, Sheriff Brackett (Brad Dourif), who has taken the now orphaned Laurie Strode under his wing. While Dourif isn't given much to do in his role, he is given a lot of screen-time and makes the most of it. Unfortunately, however, Scout Taylor-Compton's take on the iconic Laurie Strode is just as flat as it was in the previous film and is not made any more likeable by her angsty performance. Here, instead of being the charming and likeable girl-next-door, she comes across as a self-loathing mallrat who needs a slap in the face and needs to spend less time shopping at Hot Topic. Then, of course, we have Malcolm McDowell as the iconic Dr. Loomis, who serves no purpose in this film other than to pop up in the final act and try to save the day.

Four paragraphs and I feel I've yet to sum up Rob Zombie's ""Halloween II"" in a nutshell. As many things as Rob gets right in his sequel - the atmosphere, the handling of Michael's character - he also gets wrong. To be frank, there's hardly a person here you'll give a coroner's corpse about and the film is still as riddled with bad dialogue and bad acting as the first. These minor grievances wouldn't drag the film down so bad, however, if they weren't punctuated by some unnecessary and ineffective dream sequences/hallucinations, shared by Michael and Laurie. What was meant to be creepy and unsettling on paper turns out to be goofy in the context of the film, and each time one of these scenes pops up, the film comes to a screeching halt. Nothing sticks out like a sore thumb more than the satisfying and chilling final frames that are tainted by yet another wacky hallucination. Truth be told, this film has one of the most unsettling endings of the entire franchise, and for a moment, Rob nails the tone. Almost. But then, we see his wife and we see the white horse and we are instantly taken out of the mood again. Such is the curse of Rob Zombie's limited story-telling ability, and therefore goes a long way to sum up what is both good and great about ""Halloween II."" For a moment, he almost had us.",1251590400,5,5337,4.578451882845188

I have FAITHFULLY followed the Halloween saga and John Carpenter's excellent making of a cult classic, which has now been RUINED by the ABSOLUTE WORST JUNK REMAKE I have ever witnessed. I am sure John Carpenter spent the weekend weeping into a whiskey bottle that this is what his classic has become. Disgusting garbage that TOTALLY changed the very essence of every damn Carpenter character. It's one thing to put a new twist on an old tale. It's another thing to bury Laurie and Dr. Loomis in JUNK CHARACTERS. This movie needs to HIT THE ROAD and FAST!!!!!!!!!!!!!! JUNK. JUNK. JUNK. JUNK. JUNK.",1251590400,12,645,4.767857142857143
3300036,1,B0011G6FDI,"Rob Zombie is now officially the master of horrible horror.

Like hack director Michael Bay, he no longer makes original movies. He just searches through the titles of great horror franchises of the past, grabs one and then ""reinvents"" the classic, knowing that it'll make a fast buck on its opening weekend, helped by internet hype, and sucking in the fanboys and horror buffs (like myself.)

At the rate he and Bay are going, they'll be forced to remake their own remakes--or, and this would be revolutionary--attempt to make an original thriller--something we haven't seen in many a moon. As it is, we've been deluged with hideous remakes (Asian horror, classic horror and sci-fi) and endless sequels and prequels.

H2 is filmed so darkly, against such turgid, slimy backdrops and interiors, you literally experience the sensation of watching a movie where the camera was placed in an unwashed toilet bowl. Wardrobes are so hideous, with all the females sporting frizzed and mangy hairstyles you can only cringe when they have sex.

Laurie, portrayed by the totally uncharismatic Scout Taylo-Compton, has almost zero dialogue, except for the F____ word that she spews out with gusto at regular intervals. The rest of the the time she shrieks, screams, blubbers, wails, keens, convulses without end. She looks like an animated corpse throughout with the worse hair (matted and strawlike) wardrobe (greasy looking ""punk"") and make-up (gray and sweaty)of any horror heroine in recent history.

There's no character to sympathize with. You've only got Zombie's usual gallery of deadbeats, skanky women and redneck morons.  Whenever one of the male idiots encounters the monster, they make the terminal mistake of ""messing with him."" His seven foot size doesn't appear to warn them of a lethal reaction.  After cursing at him or breaking something over his head, he comes after them. As the retards they are, they don't move away. They just stand there to be pulverized.

One of those who pays for his disrepect, has one line of dialogue that should result in an Academy Award for Best Script. As he lays all bloodied and dying, he mutters for five minutes:""F___, F___, F__, F___, F___, F___, etc.""
Maybe this is what dying neanderthals utter before they go to that big outhouse in the sky.

Whenever the hulking Michael Myers monster goes on the attack, he fast becomes a bore. He stabs and stabs until you're falling asleep. And you know that no tsunami of bullets or being run over by cars or blazing infernoes will keep him down.

Probably the most confusing device used by Zombie are the dream sequences. The movie begins with a ten minute long dream, Laurie awakens, and then she dreams again and again as the movie progresses.  We're also supposed to figure out the presence of the ghosts of Michael Myers mother and him as a boy.  Towards the end, Laurie goes into another endless convulsion of spasms. It goes on so long, like seeing someone learning how to perform the St. Vitus dance, that you are not surprised that she ends up in her favorite place: a hospital.

Before H2 was released last week, Rob Zombie announced he will start filming yet another horror/sci-fi classic: The Blob. Is everyone leaping into the air with wild applause and hysteria? Someone should whisper into his ear that after he ruins The Blob, there are yet other horror franchises he should consider remaking: Saw, Frankenstein< Dracula, The Wolfman, The Mummy, The Invisible Man--that is if Michael Bay doesn't grab them first.",1251590400,8,3513,4.943972835314091
3300037,2,B0011G6FDI,"I have never minced words to anybody who asks about my feelings whenever Rob Zombie's original ""Halloween"" is mentioned.

I actually liked his first film; I think he gave what many considered to be a struggling slasher franchise a much-needed and long-overdue shot in the arm.

With this one, however, I think he dropped the ball and it would seem I'm not the only fan who holds such sentiment. The opening minutes, which ironically pays strong tribute to Rick Rosenthal's ""Halloween"" sequel, are absolutely brilliant. Sheriff Brackett finds Laurie, caked in blood and shambling down the middle of a neighborhood street in petrified shock---one can assume only mere moments after shooting Michael squarely in the face. The next time we see her, she's having the many wounds she received at Michael's hands cleaned up and stitched at Haddonfield Memorial Hospital. Her friend, Annie, played once again by Danielle Harris, is convalescing in another room down the hall. All seems perfectly fine, as it should be. That is until Michael, upon awakening in a coroner's wagon, shows up....primed and ready to finish what he started. At this point early on in the movie, I was excited. All the memories of Rosenthal's ""Halloween 2"" came flooding back to me in virtual waves. It was only after what began as a heart-pounding chase from the hospital and into the pounding rain outside that Rob Zombie suddenly decided to shift gears and throw a major monkey wrench into the proceedings.

You see, after all this chaos, Laurie wakes up in bed safe and unharmed.

Yeah.

Those delicious, beautifully-crafted opening few scenes were nothing but a dream! And that is only the merest tip of where my disappointment in this movie stems. Zombie, who was given free reign to distance himself as far as he felt was needed from John Carpenter's universe of characters and story structure, took what could have been a truly effective follow-up to his own remake and steered it down a path most fans were not expecting and obviously did not appreciate. Apart from turning Michael into a Jason Voorhees clone with a Grizzly Adams beard, who in this film now seemingly bases his entire urge to kill around messed-up visions of his mother and a white horse, he has also committed the unthinkable blasphemy by transforming Malcolm McDowell's Dr. Loomis into a money-hungry media whore! Loomis has apparently written a tell-all book, documenting Michael's prior rampages at what can only be seen as the shrewd and unforgivable expense of his victims and their families. This, as any one who has followed this series will tell you, is NOT how Dr. Samuel Loomis represents himself.

But, still, that only encompasses everything I didn't like about this movie.

What I DID like deserves it's own seperate analysis here. I liked the therapy sessions Laurie participated in with her counselor; a surprising cameo by Margot Kidder, by the way. Those scenes, even if they did consist of some rather ceaseless and unnecessary profanity by Laurie, were honest and effective. Conversely, even though I outwardly despised what Zombie had done with the Loomis character, I was also quite taken by the manner in which Laurie discovers her genetic tie with Michael. She reads about it in the good doctor's newest book. That was, admittedly, a very emotional scene. Brad Dourif's second turn as Sheriff Brackett was another positive standout for me. His scenes helped in keeping my interest grounded, especially towards the end when he finally confronts Loomis in a mad rage over everything that's transpired.

This was, as Zombie admitted, a movie he made to close out the story he kick-started within his first film. Anyone else who has seen it will probably come away believing him.

I didn't hate the film, in general, I was just disappointed. Very disappointed. But I still went ahead and bought the DVD, based mostly on the few good things I felt the script had going for it; basically everything I liked, as outlined above.

That may not be the case for whoever else decides to give this a watch. As I always try to do when it comes to movies, I simply advise any fan reading this to rent the film for themselves and make up their own minds.",1251504000,,4207,4.887798036465638
3300038,3,B0011G6FDI,"Rob Zombie said he wouldn't do a sequel to his retelling of Halloween but here is the second and ""final"" chapter of his vision. I went into this with an open mind because I knew nothing could touch the original masterpiece.

We started off with the reason why Myer's is a killing machine. They could have put it in the middle of the film but we get it right off. The film starts off fine and Myers is more vicious then ever before and we get some brutal killings. Then we see something most people would probably hate but I really didn't let it bother me. Myer's inner child, who speaks for the silent killer, and his mother look on to his every move. Why? Seems like Myer's is on drugs thru out the film or just plain nuts. I think it's because Sherri Zombie has in every damn film her husband makes. Then we find it is was all a dream. The story is not very clear and is just one of the many weak points in the film. I suppose I'll say somethings I hated about the film before I end with postives

Sherri Zombie. Hey Rob, we all know your wife is a total babe. Does she really need to be in every damn film you make?

Every death scene shows Myers inner child and his mother. What the hell for? I like Myers a solo, cold, stalking killer.

The film is mostly black and it could be heard to see what is going on half the time.

Dr. Loomis is no longer your friendly doctor. No fame got to his head and he craves the media attention. I was shocked to see what happens to him at the end.

The ending. I shouldn't trust Zombie because he said he wouldnt make this sequel but here it is. I hated the ending and it spelled sequel, even though I have no idea where they could go with it.

Pros-

I like how they tried to show suspense in the beginning but that quickly faded.

The rock tracks were in the background and it seemed they actually tried a score instead. The original Halloween wouldn't be scary if not for Carpentar's amazing score.

Overall, I came into this expecting the worst and it really wasn't the worst film i've seen this summer. It's worth a watch even though some people will hate it and some people will love it. Hell, the theater I saw it at plays brand new movies on the weekends for three bucks, so I didn't get jipped. I enjoyed it but would have been cool to see Myers kill without mommy looking on.",1251504000,5,2324,4.155902004454343

3300040,1,B0011G6FDI,"(NOTE- this is the SECOND time I put this review!)

First off let me begin by saying I loved the first movie. While Zombie is no Carpenter, he managed to take an existing concept and show us how HE imagined it- Halloween 07 was not a remake, but a portrait of a killer we thought we knew. IT was disturbing, gritty, gory, real- I liked it a lot.

I was looking so forward to this. Halloween 07 was every bit as good as Halloween 78 and I loved seeing it in the theater. And I was HORRIFIED at how bad it was!!!!! I saw lots of potential in Zombie because of the sequel, and I thought it would be a great experience. Now I reconsider. Whereas H1 left me thinking ""That was good!"", this is the first time I walked out of a Zombie film thinking ""I enjoyed almost none of that."" Not to mention people were booing at the screening and I am not surprised.

I'll begin with what I did like- Malcolm McDowell is great as Loomis as usual, Compton and Sherri Moon are gorgeously hot, Bates' score was good. And that's about it.

The story screams ""fanfiction"" in the worst sense. I think even a 12 year old could do better than this garbage. How this film got made beats me. The gore was excessive and overdone. I love gore, but no, it was just way over the top. There was not a single moment where the characters were not annoying. What was with all the dream bits? That really distracted me. Also, the movie has a sloppily edited/rushed feel to it. I liked the first one a lot and couldn't wait for this one, but no, I may have to think long and hard before even thinking about going near the screening room for Halloween III. It really is that bad.",1251417600,8,1641,4.2
3300041,2,B0011G6FDI,"Everything that made Rob Zombie's ""Halloween"" such a great horror film is noticeably absent from ""Halloween II."" This is not a movie so much as a surrealistic freak show, a cruel, ugly-looking free-for-all that assaults the senses at every opportunity with lightning fast cuts, extreme close-ups, and grating music. Unlike what was released in 2007, ""Halloween II"" is not a remake of any film in the original ""Halloween"" series--it's a new story so strange, unpleasant, and inexplicable, it's as if Zombie wrote it completely off the cuff. What was he thinking? How could he let his vision go so horribly out of control? I can only hope that this isn't a sign of his success being a fluke, that ""Halloween II"" is merely a lapse of judgment from which he will soon recover.

It begins exactly where the first film ended, with Laurie Strode (Scout Taylor-Compton) savagely shooting Michael Myers (Tyler Mane) on Halloween night. An elaborate dream sequence follows, one that pays homage to Rick Rosenthal's 1981 version of the film by taking place in a hospital. As soon as Laurie wakes up screaming, we learn that a year has passed and that she's in therapy, and of course, she has the usual anxiety medications stashed in her medicine cabinet. She's now living with Sheriff Lee Brackett (Brad Dourif) and his daughter, Annie (Danielle Harris). No one knows the whereabouts of Michael, which is strange because witnesses do remember the county coroner putting his body into an ambulance. Needless to say, Michael is very much alive, living in the middle of nowhere while plotting his return to Haddonfield, Illinois.

He's after Laurie, of course. But why? The ads have given this plot point away, but if you've managed to avoid them, let it suffice to say that he feels a special connection with her. This ties into the weirdest subplot ever conceived of for a ""Halloween"" film, which involves visions of Michael's long since dead mother (Sheri Moon Zombie) walking next to a horse. She wears a flowing ghost-like dress and either walks down a brightly lit hallway or stands in front of brilliant white light. In one of the film's most bizarre scenes, Michael and his mother stand in front of a table where ghastly creatures (looking like rejects from ""Pan's Labyrinth"") seem to be reenacting Jesus' Last Supper. If there was any decent way to account for this ridiculous spectacle, I'd be the first to share it with you.

Meanwhile, Michael's former psychologist, Dr. Sam Loomis (Malcolm McDowell), is now promoting his new book about the Myers' family and the murders that took place a year ago. What a change twelve months can make; Loomis has de-evolved into an arrogant publicity hound, which is to say that the audience no longer has any reason to take him seriously. He's now nothing more than an opportunity for moments of comedy relief. What did Zombie hope to achieve by making Loomis a figure of fun? Given how deadly serious the rest of the film is, this seems incredibly out of place. When the foundation of the plot is a series of stabbings, spatters of blood, and a hell of a lot of screaming, a director can't believably pause to reveal that he also has a sense of humor. He has to show it all throughout in order for it to work.

The hideous visuals don't help matters much. Rather than eerie shadows that build tension, Zombie opts for muted tones that look dirty and disgusting, as if mud was smeared over the camera lens before shooting. There's no sense of tension with this kind of look; there's only a sense of filth and degradation. But this story isn't supposed to be one of exploitation. On the basis of ""Halloween,"" which was a skillful combination of suspense and primal fear, I would have thought that Zombie already understood this. Apparently he didn't, and that leads me to an unfortunate conclusion: ""Halloween II"" fails because Zombie created an original story. The 2007 film, on the other hand, wasn't a complete reinvention but more of an update on John Carpenter's original. Strange how a little creative restraint can paradoxically be so freeing.

Watching this movie is like witnessing a tragic fall from grace. Maybe that's to be expected, since sequels, especially in the horror genre, are notoriously inferior to the ones that started it all. Was there any way that ""Halloween II"" could have been better or just as good as ""Halloween""? Who can say? All I know is that this movie gets virtually nothing right, not the visuals, not the story, and definitely not the characters, who spew dialogue so foul and inane that they seem transplanted from another movie altogether. The whole thing is an unsightly mess with a nonsensical plot, a sideshow attraction that wants to pass itself off as a real horror film. I can't help but feel sorry for Zombie. ""Halloween II"" shows that he has lost his way as a director. Let us hope he will eventually get his bearings.",1251417600,7,4899,4.799763033175355
3300042,2,B0011G6FDI,"Let me start by saying ""Michael Meyers"" is the only horror film character that still gets to me and I was really excited about seeing this Rob Zombie remake.  I was thoroughly disappointed.  Zombie clearly has changed the story, and it seems to me the only reason for that is to have his wife in the movie.  Because of the way his remake of Part 1 last year ended, ""Michael Meyers"" mom, Zombie's wife, shows up in dream sequences and ghostly apparitions to tell the now grown ""Michael Meyers"" to kill people.  He also has turned Dr. Loomis into a greedy apathetic character.  As we know in the original series, Dr. Loomis seemed to alway show up and try to help others and stop ""Michael"".  Rob Zombie, as with most of his movies, made this remake extremely bloody and as weird as this sounds, extremely violent.  What I mean by that is when ""Michael"" kills people you can almost feel the anger in which he's doing it come across the screen.  You also can see the over-kill...no pun intended.  It's not a horrible film, although I didn't like it and if you're like me, someone who has set through all of the original series and last year's remake, you should go see this film but don't expect too much.",1251417600,4,1201,4.447488584474886
3300043,3,B0011G6FDI,"Rob Zombie's Halloween 2 isn't any better or worse than his last one. It's probably the least crazy of his four films and is more straight forward horror. The acting is about the same average quality this time around, though when Scout Taylor-Compton whines I can't stand the sound of her. You have to take these two Halloween films as something totally different than John Carpenter's 1978 masterpiece. If you want any kind of enjoyment while watching Rob's version, don't even try to compare them. The main thing I didn't like was seeing Michael Myers walking around without his mask on at times. He looks like a lumberjack, complete with a long beard and a mane of hair. He also makes silly grunting noises when he kills, even though he never made a peep the last time around. Quiet is scary when it comes to Michael Myers. I also hated how they made Dr. Loomis rude and unlikeable.

If you liked Rob Zombie's Halloween (2007) you will find much to enjoy here as well. If not, you would probably prefer to let Michael Myers stab you to death rather than sitting through somebody other than Carpenter's vision of an iconic killer.",1251417600,2,1132,4.6318407960199

Again, its a different Michael than were use to seeing but its not really all about him anyway. Give it a shot.

3300210,2,B0011G6FDI,"[Moderate Spoilers] Let me get this straight:  In 2007, director Rob Zombie attempted to revive the original, successful ""Halloween"" movie series by creator John Carpenter that, while financially profitable, failed to meet hardcore purists' expectations, so Zombie makes a 2009 sequel to officially begin a whole new reboot of the movie series?  Zombie should've left well enough alone in the first place, though I suppose it's understandable that he decided on a sequel since 2007's version made a solid, nearly 60 million at the box office (this 2009 sequel, however, made just over half of that).  Scout Taylor-Compton (from the 2007 version, who reminds me of Julianne Hough of the ""Footloose"" remake), returns as ""Laurie Strode,"" and admittedly this 2009 version starts out great (the ambulance and hospital scenes) while it is actually more or less paralleling 1981's ""Halloween II"" very effectively and impressively so (though the original was no masterpiece).  But then the wheels fall off, with an abundance of blood, mayhem, and screams from Taylor-Compton but no real shocks or dark humor (and the white-horse scenes definitely seemed out of place).  The ending was actually unintentionally comical.  Interestingly, however, there are small parts by Margot Kidder (the original ""Superman"" movies) as a shrink, Octavia Spencer (future Best Supporting Actress winner for ""The Help"") as a nurse, and Meagan Fay as a cop at the very end (once Roseanne's snobby neighbor on TV's ""Roseanne's, but blink and you'll miss her).  Danielle Harris (who starred in a couple of the original ""Halloween"" movie series' sequels and in the first ""Halloween"" remake of this whole new movie series, which is confusing, I know) has a moderate role as well (and also had a recurring neighbor role on TV's ""Roseanne"").  Otherwise, this 2009 version, although the effort is apparent, injects little adrenaline into the original film series.  Some may argue that this newer movie series is also hurting Carpenter's reputation; therefore, although Zombie's reboot is acceptable, I hope it all ends here.",1477094400,,2088,5.303030303030303

This was choppier than his previous Halloween, but it was still interesting to watch.  There were also ridiculous moments such as an endless flashback between Michael Myers and his mother's ghost on a white horse, which was pointless except to keep the directors wife in the movie.  Laurie Strode doesn't stop screaming throughout the movie I was annoyed more than anything else.  It was way too over the top.  The actress was most definitely no Jamie Lee Curtis.  There was a whole sequence of her escape from the hospital that went on forever and then abruptly turns out to be a dream.  I know this is its own movie, but this movie wouldn't have existed if it weren't for John Carpenters original Halloween.

3300335,3,B0011G6FDI,"They should have spent more time working on the script then they seem to have done. I like the idea behind the visions Michael experiences throughout the movie with his deceased mother, and a younger version of himself with a white horse, but in all honesty while understanding can take one far in life it fails to do anything other then making you realize that the visions are redundant. Yes it's a good concept trying to bring Michaels madness into a somewhat visible perspective, but you don't, and shouldn't understand it Michael is the shape he had plenty back story in rob zombies first remake we didn't need to expand upon that in the sequel. They didn't show good judgment either during the production of this movie they had so many issues with whole reels of film getting destroyed, and having to redo all that work again, but it would have been understandable if they changed the release date to another time instead of rushing to finish it I understand they wanted to get a finished product out to the public sooner rather then later, but it only hurt them in the end financially not waiting as should have been the case. 3 stars is a fair rating scout-taylor Compton did a phenomenal job portraying Laurie strode specially the therapist scenes, and the hospital scene at the beginning was nicely done, but much of this movie could have been edited out and redone a different way. I can understand what they were hoping to achieve, but they destroyed a good franchise needless to say it was already going downhill since The curse of Michael myers was released, but instead of saving the franchise they killed any hope of a remake part 3 the hospital scene should have been extended, and I enjoyed all the scenes with scout in them cause despite contradiction to this statement she did do a phenomenal job as I've said above. They shouldn't have changed doctor Loomis character he has always been the heroic psychologist, and while again I understand what they were going for, and he did change in the end it just didn't work. I'm a supporter of new ideas, and bringing innovation to old ideas, but sometimes it's best to leave a good thing alone don't fix something that isn't broken. It's a movie worth watching, but not repeatedly others may disagree, but I believe a truly good movie can be even constantly rewatched rewatchability is the difference between a great movie, and a horrible mistake.",1464912000,2,2410,4.699763593380615

3300352,4,B0011G6FDI,"What I didn't like about the first Halloween remake was the fact that it slowly becomes nothing but a shallow imitation of the original John Carpenter masterpiece. Halloween 2 is a totally original Michael Myers story, and it's all the better for it. Rob Zombie loves Halloween (the season) imagery and I totally dug the costume party scenes, the unrelenting brutality of Myers and the bizarre dreamlike ""visions"" in this film. Halloween 1 offered nothing new and just made me appreciate the original film even more. Halloween 2 is it's own thing entirely and I really enjoyed it for that.",1456012800,,589,4.9

It is different storytelling in that it stretches further into the future, and the insert of a Moody Blues 1967 music video gives it a certain atmospheric timelessness like It Follows. More bloody than the original, the victims are mostly sexy and one of them is photographed very well indeed. Some of the camera work is too flashy, and pole dancing is a female gymnastic exercise so you never ever do it in heels even if you were born in them.",1452211200,,570,4.598039215686274
3300374,5,B0011G6FDI,"This is my favorite Halloween movie.

Unlike most people, I really enjoyed Rob Zombie's Halloween II, and it's my favorite movie in the series.  To start off with negatives, I dislike Dr. Loomis in this one.  I get that he would try to make money off of Michael's attacks, but he comes off as really rude until the end of the movie.  I also dislike Annie getting killed.  A bad end to a great character.  I also didn't like the ending to the Unrated version where Laurie dies.  I much more prefer the Theatrical cut where the pace is a little quicker, and Laurie lives.  She is my favorite character in the remake series.  I do like the Unrated version, I just prefer to watch the Theatrical version.

The good things about the movie, I like seeing how everyone changed because of the attacks.  Laurie has become a psychological mess, Annie has matured a lot, and Sheriff Brackett has become more caring towards Annie and Laurie.  I think Scout Taylor-Compton is a better actress as Laurie because not only do I strongly dislike Halloween H20: Twenty Years Later and Halloween:Resurrection, but since I'm a teenager now, she and her friends seem more relatable and more like the teens in my generation.  She also plays Laurie well in this one because seeing how she was a really friendly and nice person in the first one, and seeing how Michael has messed her life up makes her more sympathetic.  I don't mind Michael's look in this one because really what does he do for the rest of the year when it's not Halloween?  He's not going to wear the mask 24/7, because the latex will rot further.  It gets torn at one point in the movie and by the end of the movie, it looks like it could fall apart.  I don't mind the ""Hobo Michael"" look.  Seeing his mom with the ""White Horse"" concept doesn't bother me because it is his perception of her and not actually her spirit talking to him.  Dr. Loomis is my favorite character in the original movies, and Laurie is my favorite character in the remakes.  Annie has become more mature in this one and takes care of Laurie.  Sheriff Brackett is also likable, he is a beaten down father taking care of Laurie and Annie.

There are many other things I love about this movie.  Seeing the psychological effects on the characters is interesting.  I can imagine Laurie turning out like she did after what happened with in the last movie.  The hospital sequence which turned out to be a dream was well done and suspenseful.  I initially didn't like Michael grunting when he kills people, but now I don't mind it.  In the hospital scene, it makes sense becuase it's Laurie's dream, so she's going to have an exaggerated view on Michael's attacks.  Michael's kills were even more brutal than the last movie.  Annie's death is the most depressing movie death I have seen ever.  The music playing while Laurie holds her as she's dying was really sad.  Then Sheriff Brackett comes and breaks down.  Rob Zombie did a good job making you feel emotion in that scene.  Laurie's friend Mya's death was also kind of sad when she was brutally killed.  Dr. Loomis' death in the Theatrical version involves Michael hacking him 6 times and stabbing him 12 more times.  The party scene with Laurie and her friends was well done and entertaining.

The Theatrical version, which I am reviewing, is my favorite of the two versions because Laurie seems to try to get her life together, and the ending is much better, because in the Unrated version, Laurie is shot and dies.  Her dying vision is of her in an asylum as her real mother walks to her while ""Love Hurts"" plays.  Depressing, but I like the Theatrical version's ending, where she kills Michael and lives, then the scene transitions to the same scene in the asylum while ""Laurie's Theme"" plays, making the ending more sinister and creepy, and setting up for what could have been an interesting follow-up for a Halloween III.

This is, in my opinion, the most underrated Halloween movie.  Everyone is allowed their own opinion, and in my opinion, this is my favorite Halloween movie.  It's not like every other Halloween movie, Rob Zombie recreates the characters and makes them his own further than his first movie.  It's gruesome, emotional, gritty, and when Michael kills, you feel the victim's pain.  I love pretty much everything about this movie.  When I want to watch a Halloween movie, I usually watch Rob Zombie's Halloween and Halloween II.  A lot of people hate it because they consider it a remake of the original Halloween II from 1981, but it is not a remake, it is a sequel to Rob Zombie's remake/re-imagining.  I love this movie and I watch it often, and I enjoy it every time, no matter what others think.",1451606400,5,4691,4.597590361445783

The second just really makes me wonder if Rob Zombie truly is a fan of the movie or he just wanted to make it his vanity project. Scout is a horrible actress. And Zombie made Laurie someone you want to see die in a horror movie. At least for me. Plus this and the first really ruined the mystique of Michael Myers. Buy so did Halloween 6.

Weak ending and Michael Myers grunting all the time really distracted from taking this seriously. Whoever suggested that Michael should ever make sound should have been shot down. Very frustrating compared to how good the 1st remake was. Skip this and only watch the 1st one. So annoying. Tyler Mane was awesome in both except for the grunting in this one. Macolm's character in this 2nd movie was irritating and not realistic with his choice to exploit the story. So frustrating! Also the originl child actor who played Michael at an early age was great! He isn't in this one and that kinda sucked. Yes he grew older probably but still sucked.,1444521600,,760,4.595588235294118

In fact this film is so far and away from any of his other outings as a film maker it makes me wonder if he didn't have some uncredited assistance with the making of this. The cinematography, the story line(writing and character development), camera angles, the music...etc...I could go on but I'll end by saying ""Yes, this film is well worth the watch and worth studying if you're thinking about getting into film making.""",1437523200,,619,4.43859649122807

3300462,2,B0011G6FDI,"When Rob Zombie first tried his hand with remaking the original Halloween back in 2007, he did an awesome job. Unfortunately, success tends to make some filmmakers want to rush to get another film made and onscreen a little too quick. As they did after Halloween 4, even Moustapha Akkad himself admitted, we hurried after the success of Halloween 4 to get Halloween 5 made, and they did a bad job. Ironically i would gladly take Halloween 5, over this film. Now when Halloween II first got to theaters, a friend of mine and I rushed to a midnight showing with anxious anticipation. Just about an hour and a half later, we were stunned, we could not figure out what we had just seen. The first 10 to 15 minutes of the movie was great, the hospital chase with Laurie and Michael reminded us so much of Rick Rosenthal's 1981 Halloween II, that we were excited. The overuse of the phrase White Horse, and the actual overusing of a white horse was so disappointing, They could have done a lot better, Allowing Michael to walk Haddonfield with a cruddy hoodie with long hair and scrubby beard, made me think Zombie was trying to mirror image michael to look like himself. Really disappointing film, definitely ranks at the bottom of all of the other films.

3300487,3,B0011G6FDI,"isn't watching a movie supposed to be fun? I say even a scary movie is supposed to be fun. Alien, the shining, the original halloween, the thing. those are movies I grew up with and they are scary but to me a lot of fun and perhaps they've spoiled me for modern horror movies as Ive rarely liked anything released in the last 25 or so years.

 you almost have to be a fan of the Halloween series to give its' most recent sequels a look. I am very much a fan of the first 3 Halloween movies but the reputation this series earned with the last 6 entries is making me wonder how far the series can fall. i want so badly for this series to turn around but it just doesn't happen with this one. it's not that this movie doesn't have some moments. as another reviewer mentions, the first 25 minutes or so is about as good as anything in the series, so how can the remaining hour and twenty minutes be so abysmal?

 the monster is the reason you watch a monster movie, but ive always thought the audience should be able to relate to some of the characters who fill the rest of this story. this would add to the tension and suspense and make me want to run from Michael just as much as the victims in the story. here the other characters are unlikeable to the point that you're cheering the villain.

 a rob zombie movie must have all his trademarks included even if it means taking a movie that works better with a focus on suspense and what is hiding in the shadows and instead giving explicit graphic violence for the sake of shock value. whats presented here is unsettling but not as effective nor as much fun for the audience as a simple camera cut as soon as you know the monster has struck. I get that rob zombie wants to make the story truly horrible and depressing but if its not fun for the audience, why are we watching it?

 as I said, there are a few good moments in this one and if you are halloween fan you're going to see it anyway, the story is pretty unique but the same thing that makes it so unique... rob zombie and his excessiveness ... is just too much for me to enjoy this as a halloween movie and not just a rob zombie movie that happens to feature Michael myers. it doesn't need the excessiveness of explicit gore and 100 f words. it almost feels like a parody of the originals rather than a horror movie. :(

 all this being said the Blu-ray is excellent as it gives a director's cut of what I hear was an even worse theatrical cut. (how is that possible?) multiple special features which are pretty interesting. full length director's commentary. picture quality is incredibly sharp. does have some grain. audio is excellent. great Blu-ray for a bad movie.

 how about rob zombie writes the next halloween story as he did give us two very original stories but someone else directs or at least co-directs.",1429747200,2,2824,4.307547169811321

3300530,1,B0011G6FDI,This was a horrible sequel and didn't need to be made I only bought so I could have all the Halloweens. I thought Zombie did something really cool.with his remake by spending more time with Myers as a child. In this sequel however it makes no sense and seems to drag on. Micheal spends at least the first part of the movie no mask and just wandering around and seeing visions of his mother with a white horse. That was just so he could get his wife in the film again. Loomis is a total ass in this which sucks because Zombie just trashed his character. Id skip this not worth the time to watch it big disappointment.,1425513600,12,616,4.228813559322034

He makes you hate ALL of your favorite characters from the series. There are still a few likeable characters, namely the Bracketts, but they aren't the main focus of the story. That's a big deal for me.

As far as gore and horror, that is where this movie succeeds. The opening is amazing. It shifts in greatness after the opening (you'll see). Regardless, the movie carries it's gore through the end. This is undoubtedly the most violent Halloween movie yet. Usually those are the only things one needs in a horror movie, so at least it accomplishes that.

It is not for the sensitive viewers, but if you love watching a family connected by an evil destiny that can only end like the slogan says ""Family Is Forever"". The director's cut goes into the deep psyche of a madman and his family who suffer from the evil that envelops them all. I thought this was a beautiful movie of fates colliding on a runaway train headed straight to hell. I'm sick of these people who want to criticize Rob Zombie and his desire to tell stories that deliver true horror that makes you uncomfortable. I love his movies and I will relish every movie he delivers. Appreciate the man and let yourself fall in love with the madness that oozes out of Rob's great mind. This is a review for Halloween II the unrated director's cut, but definitely watch the unrated director's cuts of part 1 and 2 before enjoying the theatrical cuts. I like Rob Zombie am proud to be weird and like Rob don't give a damn about the people who just want to hate against him. You are entitled to your opinion, but open your mind and let the madness creep in and you'll fall in love with the legend of the weird, my man Rob Zombie. Check out all the other great movies out there and buy the soundtracks to the movies. The Devil's Rejects had one of the most fantastic music intros that told the story as much as the characters.

I really enjoy both versions of it though and had to own them both.  Unfortunately the Theatrical cut is only available on DVD and didn't come in the 15 Disc Anniversary Collection.  I'm not sure why so many people hate this movie.  Its got a good deal of blood & gore, nudity, and film making creativity and passion.

3300605,4,B0011G6FDI,"If theres one thing Halloween: The Complete Collection has done for fans, its let them conveniently re-live their favorite movie in the franchise at any given moment in the comfort of their own home. October is one of my favorite times of year because of a certain horror-themed holiday which gives me even more reason to go through the Halloween series as furiously as possible. I recently took in Rob Zombies Halloween II after only seeing it once when it was released in 2009.

Zombies 2007 remake / reboot / origin story of John Carpenters classic tale took the first half of the film to give us exhaustive information on Michael Myers past and his reasons for becoming the cold-blooded killer he turned into. The second part was a rather faithful re-tooling of the original 1978 classic.

His Halloween II does the exact same thing as the remake. It loosely takes the storyline from Rick Rosenthals 1981 follow-up to Carpenters masterpiece and runs with it for the first 30 or so minutes before heading in a completely different direction. In a nut shell, Michael Myers is viciously making his way back to Haddonfield to finish the business he started in the first chapter. This time hes being led by the specter of his dead mother riding a white horse while leading around a vision of his childhood self. It seems Judith Myers wants Michael to bring his sister Laurie home.

Tyler Mane portrays Michael Myers as a coherent demonic force with an unquenchable fury. When he wants someone dead, he sees the job through grunting and viciously thrusting his weapon to the bitter end. Carpenters Myers was more calm and passive in his approach. Although cut from the same cloth, these are two very different versions of the same character.

Where the original 1978 film and even its sequel were studies in gore minimalism, Rob Zombies Halloween II revels in its onscreen gruesomeness. From the graphic opening scenes of Laurie Strode being put back together on the operating table to each and every kill performed by Michael Myers, its an exercise in excess blood and guts. Just what audiences crave in their horror films now.

Taking in Halloween II for a second time has revealed its not quite as cerebral as I originally thought on first viewing. Dont misunderstand me. Theres way more thought put into the script here than a slasher film really demands, but at its core its still just a modern update of a good old-fashioned stalking killer flick. I still think there are points in the film where its insinuated someone else besides Michael is doing the butchering.

Halloween: The Complete Collection features the unrated Directors Cut of Rob Zombies Halloween II. Its 14 minutes longer than the version seen by audiences in the theater. The extended edition is made up of 94 altered scenes including 42 examples of alternative footage and 14 re-cuts. Whats strange is theres no extra violence or sexual situations among any of the unused and amended material.

While still a worthy entry into the Halloween franchise, Rob Zombies sequel isn't quite as fulfilling on a second watch. I remembered it being a whole lot smarter than it really is. It does deserve props for trying to take the slasher genre in a heavier psychological and abstract route. However, at the end of the day, its still just another entertaining episode in the legend of Michael Myers.

Rob Zombie's ""Halloween II: Unrated Director's Cut"" is available now on the ""Halloween: The Complete Collection"" Deluxe and Standard Edition box sets.",1412640000,,3514,4.874371859296482

3300620,1,B0011G6FDI,"Absolutely horrible in every single capacity imaginable.

One of the absolute worst horror movies and since 2009 ive seen really horrible horror movies.

Yet this one STILL stands out as one of the absolute worst ones.

Unlike a lot of people I loved the remake of Halloween I found it brutal raw in your face twisted sick suspenseful and satisfying.

The sequel however? Nope none of the above.

The beginning I admit started out promising with the hospital scenario that I found quite refreshing considering the Halloween fans remember the sequel taking place in a hospital.

However you are immediately snapped out of this scenario when it is revealed ...

SPOILER ALERT!!!!! It is simply Lauries nightmare in her own head not actually happening.

That part already ticked me off considering it insulted the audiences intelligence and from then on the movie kept getting worse.

I felt it had some potential in the beginning with the hospital scenario but once I realized id been tricked and fooled that was all she wrote for me.

I managed too watch the entire movie online not in a theater no way would I have ever PAID for this travesty of a film.

I watched the unrated version I seriously doubt the theatrical version was any better and the reviews I read when this movie was originally released into theaters confirmed that fact for me.

The characters in the sequel were so useless and unnecessary I do not even know where too even begin.

Lets start with Dr Loomis Malcolm Mc Dowells character from the first movie in the first movie he was a compassionate caring man trying desperately too save a little boy from being completely lost too the darkness and evil that was slowly consuming him.

However in the sequel they made Dr Loomis instantly unlikeable which is an extremely stupid mistake considering Dr Loomis was always someone we cared about even if at times he seemed really unstable mentally.

Malcolms Dr Loomis was grating extremely annoying stupid moronic selfish arrogant and a total narcissist.

No idea what Zombie was smoking when he made the sequel but he literally forgot how he had established Loomis in the first movie .

Its like this Loomis is in a completely different movie and hes a complete stranger too the beloved Halloween fans.

In the end I hated the guy and was rooting for him too die and that's even more unspeakable too actually make us want a beloved character too DIE.

Lets then move on too Laurie Scout Taylor Compton was a royal pain in the butt as Laurie.

Yeah she whined a LOT in the original film and was kinda annoying yet at the same time I found her likeable and sweet.

I was also rooting for HER too die in the sequel Im no prude by any stretch of the imagination.

But she sounded like a complete imbecile saying f this and f that literally every single time she opened her mouth.

Her annoying histrionics were also borderline psychotic and made no sense whatsoever .

I swear Zombie was seriously smoking some good s!$% when he made this sequel he literally changed everything about all the characters in the sequel and forgot all about what they were actually like in the first one.

Then we have Lauries dispensable friends who are literally useless and serve no purpose whatsoever too this film.

Then we have a friend who miraculously and stupidly somehow survived a brutal slaughter in the first film.

She has facial scarrings and scars on her body but the character is very bitter hateful and just flat out hates Laurie.

I wholeheartedly am with her in that regard.

There are also some hilariously bad tender moments that come out of nowhere and are supposed too make us feel for the characters.

Nope the footage was hilarious though and did not fit at all.

In all honesty this movie was more of a comedy then a horror film .

Yes it had brutal violence but it was also repetitive boring and unoriginal violence unlike the first film when the violence was more graphic visceral and disturbing.

I just could not get into Michael stabbing someone over and over I was like yeah yeah you have a knife geez get creative already with how you dispatch your victims ffs.

Then there are the random out of nowhere victims who also make no sense and are truly some of the stupidest people ive seen in a horror movie.

I swear I was rooting for Michael and even he sucked in this film.

The mask looked cheap and gaudy he wasn't intimidating or scary like he was one in the first one.

Now let me get too the absolute worst aspect of this movie which is pretty much every part of this film too begin with.

But I digress ladies and gentlemen I give you a dead mother a white horse a horribly bad teen actor portraying Michael as a child and there in you have the travesty that is Halloween 2.

What was so hilarious especially about the kid actor was it was NOT the original actor who portrayed Michael as a child in the first movie.

The actress that played the mother I found her likeable and sweet and caring in the first film.

In the sequel however? She couldn't act for s#$! nor could the teen playing Michael nor could the harping screaming freak out Laurie either.

In closing Rob Zombie single handedly destroyed the franchise with this entry.

Thankfully though I treat this film as the imaginary nightmare that it is and only think of 1 2 4 5 6 7 and the remake as true Halloween movies.

This is one film that NEVER should have seen the light of day and I know there are a LOT of people who agree about that.

Too bad I cant give this film a negative 0.

Oh almost forgot one of my all time favorite horror actors Brad Dourif the voice of Chucky was so misused here it wasn't even funny.

He was only in a tiny portion of the entire film and wasn't even given much too do.

The ending was also one of the worst endings ive seen in years.

I admit initially I found the unrated ending somewhat satisfying the twist was okay with me but it still showed just how stupid and badly made the entire film was whether unrated or rated.

Finding something somewhat satisfying is by no means praise for this garbage dump of a film its like a comedian telling a joke only too receive polite applause or awkward silence in return.",1411689600,5,6195,4.507168458781362

3300640,1,B0011G6FDI,"I will say that I felt John Carpenter's original ""Halloween"" was a ""sacred cow"" when it came to horror films, and was irked that Rob Zombie was going to remake it....I had a strong bias against the film before I even walked into the theater. I watched Zombie's take on the Myers tale, and picked apart everything wrong with that first film and hated it. Flash forward a few years, and I grab it off the shelf at Blockbuster (remember those places?), gave it a second viewing...and found that I actually enjoyed Zombie's ""Halloween"". While I think it will always remain in the shadow of Carpenter's film, Zombie's remake was a lot of fun and much better than most of the sequels which followed the original.

I was excited to see where Zombie would go with part 2....

I should have known I was in trouble when the movie opens with a dream sequence! There's a flashback of young Michael being visited by him Mom, who gives him a horse toy, and then we see things pick up right where we left off with the survivors of Michael's rampage being taken to the hospital, Michael is revived and stalks Laurie through a hospital and we soon discover this is all a dream??? I guess Zombie wanted to pay homage to the original ""Halloween 2"" with a few hospital scenes. We soon learn that it's actually been a year since Michael's attack and that Laurie is now living with Annie and her family. No one has seen Michael since he disappeared the previous Halloween, and he is presumed dead. Of course Michael is still alive and dreaming about his dead Mom, his younger self and a white horse?? With Halloween right around the corner, Michael returns to Haddonfield to finish off his sister.

This movie is all over the place, the narrative can barely hang together, the scares are non-existent, and worst of all the film is just painfully dull. Even if you hated Zombie's take on the original film, you have to admit, it wasn't dull. This film just makes no sense, and it almost feels like stuff is just crammed in here because ""why not?"". I left any and all baggage at the door going into this film, I had no bias. Zombie's ""Halloween"" won me over, so I went into this one expecting a good time. But this nonsensical mess is a complete let-down. Not recommended at all.",1407369600,,2255,4.495121951219512

I thought the first Halloween re-make was decent.  And I really enjoyed Rob Zombie's other films like The Haunted World of El Superbeasto, House of 1000 Corpses, & Lords of salem.  But the Halloween II Re-Make lacked ALOT.
  I think Zombie made an admirable attempt in trying to create a new ""Vision"" with this film.  But in the end he just fell short.  I mean, there was no ""Revelation"" that the heroine was Myers sister like we did in the original, we knew it from the first one.  We get no supernatural scare like we did in the original either.  The Closest we come to it is Michael & His sister's ""Shared"" Hallucination of their mother.  There was to much blood.  And it lacked the scare the original Halloween II but it instead it traded brutality.
  What I did like about it was Malcom McDowel as Loomis.  It was nice to see Loomis with another type of personality than the one in the Original.  I also enjoyed the Soundtrack witch I think is Enjoyable.  There were a few laughs that I think were great given the context of the movie.

There is no denying that this is the worst film in the entire Halloween franchise (even though Rob Zombie's franchise should remain completely separate from the original); but, I'm not even saying that!  I'm saying that this is possibly the worst movie I have ever seen in my life!!!",1400112000,,331,4.689655172413793
3300668,3,B0011G6FDI,"The film should have opened with:

WHITE HORSE - Since my wife's character .. I mean, ... a main character was killed off in the first film, I will quote some mumbo-jumbo excerpt from ""The Subconscious Psychosis of Dreams"" and have my wife .. I mean, a lead actress, portray an important character that influences another important character in this film. She will be dressed in white.. just because... and we'll throw in a white horse.. just because. She will continue to reappear throughout this film until all of the filmed footage is used.

-Excerpt from
My Journal .. I mean ...""The Subconscious Psychosis of blah-blah""

Moving on...
When this film was released back in 2009, it was butchered (no pun intended) by the critics and most of the audience. I, personally, do not care because I actually like it and prefer it over Zombie's original re-visioning of ""Halloween"". This sequel is brutal, unsettling, ghastly and it moves at a pretty brisk pace (well, at least one of the versions does... more on this later). Admittedly, I prefer the theatrical version but this unrated Director's cut offers some interesting additional footage and in my opinion, a very disappointing climax. Also note, that this version is not exactly scarier or bloodier; it is longer with revisions to timelines and characters. Most of the additional scenes deal with Laurie Strode's mental anguish. Also thrown in are a lot of unnecessary footage of Mikey and Rob Zombie's wife. For the horror nut, watch both versions and decide which one you like (or detest) more.

This grisly sequel opens with a brief flashback of a young Michael and his mother that introduces the ""White Horse"" theme- a reoccurring theme for the duration of the film. The film then cuts to a shocked and wounded Laurie Strode, who aimlessly walks through an empty street in Haddonfield, having survived a near fatal confrontation with Michael. She is taken to the hospital where the diabolical Michael follows and I guess you can guess what happens there. The rest of the film does not even remotely resemble 1981's ""Halloween II"". Zombie did not try to imitate it and despite a brief scene taking place in the hospital, the rest of the film goes to places the original did not. Laurie Strode, because of her past traumatic experience, is clearly messed up seeking the help of a therapist (played by an almost unrecognizable Lois Lane.. I mean, Margot Kidder) while Dr. Loomis, shamelessly tries to cash in on the tragedy of the Haddonfield massacre by writing a tell-all book which reveals the truth about Myers and his connection to Strode.

The tone of the film is much darker than Zombie's ""Halloween"" and the executions here are explicit. Whatever built up anger Michael possessed is unleashed here; I mean, talk about overkill. The man really has a bone to pick with these people. In some of the kill sequences, I honestly had to look away. The characters here are also very different than what we were used to seeing in the original film and its sequel. Here the characters are raw and emotionally, they are cut open; we see them in their entirety. This is where the unrated version may offer a bit more substance, at least to those who have the patience and are not annoyed by multiple scenes of a constantly whining leading lady. Although Strode is exposed as a disturbed, confrontational young woman and a far cry from the shy, good girl Laurie played by Jamie Lee Curtis in both versions, it is in the unrated version where we fully see her downward spiral and extremely abrasive demeanor. Taylor-Compton's Laurie is not as likeable but it is understandable why she is such a hot mess. Danielle Harris who plays her friend Annie, is a more vulnerable, likeable character but she too has a rough edge. Whenever she is on screen, we see the ravages of her previous encounter with Myers across her pretty face. She remains the most sympathetic character in this film. Brad Dourif who plays Sheriff Brackett is also great here and like Harris, is given a bit more depth. I am used to seeing Dourrif play outrageous psycho characters. Here, he is far more human.

The film is not without its flaws. Although I warmed up to the ""white horse"" theme, it may appear silly to some. Zombie does permeate the film's surroundings with his usual unappealing flair - lots of swearing, some pretty horrible dialogue, unsavory main/supporting characters. As stated, I prefer the theatrical release; it is edited better, omitting unnecessary or pointless scenes fixing its pacing issues. The murder sequences are no less explicit and the climax is far more satisfying. Here Zombie simply added too much of Strode's emotional turmoil. There are far too many scenes of her losing her mind; whatever pity we may have felt for her slowly diminishes and by the time she is finally reunited with Michael, we are wanting him to silence her whining once and for all. I also do not think it was a good idea in showing us Myer's much too human face clearly in several frames. It takes away from this monsters magic and mythology. It didn't work for me in the first film and it certainly doesn't work for me here. With all of that said, as a slasher movie, it delivers.

""Halloween II"" (2009) is not for everyone. Those who are not a fan of Rob Zombie need to stay away. The squeamish or those with faint hearts, I recommend you watch something not as visceral like Disney's ""Pinocchio"". This fable is a dark one; it is sick, twisted, and brutal to the core. As I already stated, I prefer the sequel over Zombie's original vision of the Halloween legend and I will forever remain unapologetic.

The picture quality is good as is the sound. The version comes with a lot of extras that should please the fans. If you prefer the theatrical version, I recommend the&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Rob-Zombie-s-Halloween-Halloween-2-Double-Feature-Blu-ray/dp/B0057GUHWI/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Rob Zombie's Halloween / Halloween 2 (Double Feature) [Blu-ray</a>] that includes both Zombie's 'Halloween' (2007) and 'Halloween II'.

3300693,5,B0011G6FDI,"Rob Zombie's Halloween 2 is a great horror film and I think it does the Halloween franchise justice. I thought Zombie made this film different and was very creative. The opening to this movie is great as it pays tribute to the original Halloween 2 by having Myers stalk Laurie in a hospital. It all is a dream though. In real life time has passed and it has left a lot of trauma and bad memories to Laurie as she is an emotional wreck still trying to heal and get over that traumatic experience and learning that Myers is her brother. I thought it was realistic for someone to be like this after undergoing the experience. Compton is not a very good actress and having the most difficult part to play didn't help her in this movie.

  The acting large in part in pretty solid. Malcom Mcdowell gives a great performance as Dr. Loomis. Loomis has turned into a greedy, selfish egotist who will do anything to make a buck off his experiences with Myers. He has another book to sell and shows to appear on. He could care less about Myers being still out there as he is clearly out for himself. I like Zombie changing the character to make Loomis not an honorable man as in the original films. It's a strong point of the film that separates it from the original Halloween 2.

  Brad Douriff gives the best performance in the film as Sheriff Brackett. He is the most likable character in the movie and represents the honorable man that Loomis isn't. Brackett takes care of Laurie as if she is his daughter which is nice. Douriff has a great chemistry with Danielle Harris who returns as Annie. The two seem like a good father and daughter. Harris gives a great supporting performance in the film. She is someone on Myers's target list but also a survivor. It's cool having Harris once again in a Halloween movie since she has been doing them since she was a kid. Once Donald Pleasance passed on and Jamie Lee Curtis moved on from the Franchise Harris has carried on the tradition.

  Sheri Moon Zombie does a good acting job in the film as a ghost. I always thought Sheri Moon is a underrated actress. She did a great job in the first Halloween. The whole white horse thing was interesting. I like that Rob wanted to bring something new to the table. Chase Wright Vanek takes over the role of young Michael Myers. I thought the previous actor was much better and it was too bad he got too old for the part. There are some nice horror legends appearing briefly in the film. Margot Kidder from horror movies such as Black Christmas and Amityvillve Horror appears as a doctor. Caroline Williams from Texas Chainsaw Massacre 2 appears as Loomis's publicist. She is some nice added comic relief.

  The movie is very violent. It's brutal to put it in one word. My father said it best Myers was not too happy with Mrs Spencer who won an oscar after this film but in this film she plays a nurse who gets stabbed twenty times or so. That sets the tone for the whole movie. It's unrelenting and takes no prisoners. I know when Myers speaks in the film people didn't like that but once again it's being different than the Carpenter version. I liked that and thought it added to the great climax of the film.

  This is a very brutal and dark serious horror movie for the most part. When Danielle Harris is killed brutally it is a major shock and you care about her character and when Douriff finds his daughter it's one of the more tragic scenes in the history of horror. Douriff played the scene beautifully and instantly as the viewer we are on his side to get revenge on Myers. It was very dark and sad Annie dies. I like the flashblacks and dreams Laurie has during the film. It's well directed by Zombie.

  In the end Loomis finally comes to the realization that his fame is over, he's been a huge ass and Myers is alive and he maybe the only one that can stop him. He comes to help Laurie who is being held hostage by Myers. I won't say anything more but the unrated director's cut is one of the best endings to a horror film and I've seen a lot of them. I recommend this movie to all horror movie fans and Halloween fans! Cheers and Enjoy!",1396569600,3,4131,4.370757180156658

3300698,3,B0011G6FDI,"I'll admit I enjoyed a lot of what I saw, but I have to drop this movie down quite a lot from it's predecessor. I said that movie had problems as a remake but was ok as a movie. Here it's got problems as a movie and as part of the series it wasn't good.

First, what I enjoyed, I enjoyed the dark tone and the newness of the storyline. Also many of the arguments are actually close to real life arguments we may experience during our lifetimes. The deaths were gruesome, the film got tense as it went on and there was a general sense of helplessness/negativity that I usually don't like, but felt was good in this movie.

Now for the problems, this really isn't Halloween II. This is PTSD for everyone involved in the first and Michael just happens to show up at the end of the movie. Loomis went back to talk but little action and seemed very different from the previous movie. Trying to feel for Laurie was almost impossible even though I think that was the point. Michael having visions doesn't make sense as he didn't seem to have them before. Even though it's the best acted scene of the movie, I hated one perticuler characters death (you can figure it out).

Finally neither ending was done well. SPOILER ALERT PEOPLE SO YOU MAY WANT TO STOP. In both endings it's obvious Laurie is not a threat and yet she gets shot anyway. Also in the alternate ending Michael talking was a bad move. Finally, it's appearent that the film wants to indicate the ""evil"" has passed onto Laurie but why kill her/put her in the white room? Maybe watching special features will explain that, I dunno.

As one of the previous reviewers pointed out the gore was way to distressing. I found it sickening and way to much.

The characters turned a new direction. The acting remains the same as the other 2007 Halloween movie - all characters incredibly boring. Laurie Strode was the most irritating character - F this and F that! Constantly screaming!

Then there's the worst part of the movie the dreams. The white horse and that annoying woman. I have nothing against the actress whom plays Michael's mum. I am sure she is a nice woman in real life. But to bring her back in this movie was a really desperate move to make. The character and the horse just made no sense to the movie.

I am glad that Rob is not making Halloween 3.

Note, I liked Rob Zombie's original remake.

But as for this,

Its amazing when a reimaging of a Horror classic, actually has to do just about everything to intentionally trainwreck itself.

Not only are the original characters totally trashed, the film actually attempts to be more of a want-to-be psychological drama than a scary movie. We spend more time learning about how Laure is a psychotic whackjob with PTSD/medication issues and how Dr. Loomis is a scumbug than we see anything to do with Michael Meyers. Within the context of the Halloween series Rob Zombie turns out to not only annihilate your love for the original characters, the sinister prescence of Michael Meyers, the fear, the music score, and everything that makes the original films good, but he literally flips all these elements around and trashes them to the fullest extent possible. He makes the original characters as miserable and unlikable as possible, Michael is turned into a emotionally barren man with a Freudian Electra complex (Yea, i'm not kidding here, they make a particular allusion to this) there is no scare factor, jumps or suspense whatsoever. Dream sequences of imagined Michael Meyers killings literally replace horror scenes. Even the original score is cut out and replaced with possibly the worst soundtrack available to the human ear. Of course there is some psychic connection that is also explored between Laurie and Michael but of course this plot line is unresolved and completely unexplained while managing to take up most of the time you spend between the previously mentioned smagorsbord of pseudo-horror garbage.

Not only did he reinvent the worst possible film in the Halloween franchise, he actually had to go out of his way to ruin Halloween as much as possible and insults the very core of this series.  I'd rather watch Season of the Witch and Manos The Hands of Fate because at least they didn't try. This did try, it tried to go out of its way to intentionally destroy all the elements of the Halloween franchise and did so with astounding vigor.",1384041600,3,2080,4.979827089337176

3300746,1,B0011G6FDI,"I took the plunge and watched one of the Rob Zombie Halloween remakes from recent years.  Talk about an over-the-top pile of trash.  This movie is just a gore fest with a hillbilly/redneck feel to it.  Rob Zombie has made Michael Myers so brutal and over the top.  He kills so brutally that I say to myself, ""OK, OK, OK - we get it - the person is dead already.  No need to go so far with it.""  Why did these Halloween movies need to be remade to begin with?  They didn't.  As Rob Zombie says on the 25 Years Of Terror DVD, ""Everyone I know will go see a horror movie sequel knowing it's a piece of crap.""  You said it, Rob.  I must say, though, that I give you credit for realizing that yes indeed people will go see a sequel knowing it's a piece of crap.  You know there's a target audience out there, so for that I give you credit.

This movie is a shining example of why I stick to watching the old horror movies of the past from the 1920s, '30s, '40s, '50s, '60s, '70s, and '80s.  Nothing will ever top the horror movies of decades past, the horror movies of the first nine decades of the twentieth century.

I don't recommend Halloween II.  If you want to watch a movie called Halloween II, watch John Carpenter's 1981 movie.",1383436800,4,1231,4.178723404255319

3300748,5,B0011G6FDI,"Spoilers: Not since Alien 3 have we been treated to a downbeat slice and dice story where the heroine degenerates deeply into hopelessness. In Alien 3, Ripley was able to commit self sacrifice at the end, but in Halloween II, Laurie is driven farther into madness by the memory of what happened to her two years earlier, as well as the sudden appearance of ""ghost"" visions of her birth mother and of Michael as a child without the chance to do anything about it or help others. Laurie is shredded, emotionally, throughout this film, and left with nothing but her final vision of her mother coming to her as she dies. The film is a mixture of intense violence, psychological distress, building anticipation, and questions of sanity connecting Michael and Laurie. We get the treatment of the hospital from the 1981 Halloween II, but this is just a dream to set up Laurie's trauma that plays out as she uncovers who she really is and what that means. Meanwhile, Dr. Loomis, rich and capitalizing on the deaths in Haddonfield two years prior, is forced to look at what his fame has done to others, and he must make the choice to stay out or do something. Surreal images juxtaposed against graphically violent ones make for an interesting and emotional viewing experience. Don't be fooled by those who claim there is no plot or nothing original. This Laurie Strode collapses into emotional problems years before Jamie Lee Curtis' character succumbed in Halloween: Resurrection (2002). The characters and their journeys are the focus here, as well as the severed sanity of Michael and Laurie.",1383350400,,1586,4.834558823529412
3300749,3,B0011G6FDI,I will start this by saying I wasn't a big fan of Rob Zombies Halloween 1 but I had heard this one was much darker (which the original was also) so I was hopeful. Sadly it was just darker but kind of a chaotic mess. Michael Meyers was now a person and we actually see his face. He grunts and yells while killing and ultimately just didn't feel like Michael Meyers we all know and love. What this movie did do was make me actually like Rob Zombies Halloween 1 remake a little more. I recommend seeing it but not sure I can recommend owning it unless it's really cheap (which it was when I bought it).

Dr. Loomis in this version is completely different from who I remembered... He is much more greedy and very business man like.  The setting is more of Texas Chainsaw/Jason VS. Freddy movies than Halloween movie.  All the characters that effected by Micheal are much more damage than the original, especially Laurie.  O and poor Annie, for those who saw it, that was brutal what Micheal's done to her!  Surprisingly, actor Brad Dourif, who played  Sheriff Lee is the weakest one here!

Like its predecessor, only about twenty minutes worth of the movie acts as the legitimate sequel that pays homage to the original, in which Laurie Strode is attacked by the menacing Michael Meyers in the hospital, and plays out as an entirely new spectacle that follows the traumatized Laurie trying to cope with the survivors guilt and the realization that she is Michael's sister. I cannot say this film is easy on the eyes, but for gore hounds looking for an efficient time killer for the holiday season, Rob Zombie's ""Halloween 2"" is a must-see, and a surprisingly thought-provoking bookend to what would normally branch out as another franchise---or at the very least, a trilogy...",1382400000,,855,5.070921985815603
3300766,5,B0011G6FDI,"This version of Rob Zombie's Halloween II is unrelenting.  The descent into madness by the lead character as a result of the events from the first movie ... is to me ... both believable, sad and gripping.  The actual horror and violence is gritty and visceral and unlike what you see in most modern slasher flicks.  The tone is dark and bleak.  But it matches the overall aspect of the character arcs.

Some might find the white horse / ghost mom imagery as an ill-fitting placement, but in the directors cut, it just seems to fit a bit better than in the theatrical release.  That said, maybe one or two less uses would have been ideal.  However it doesn't take me away from the movie events.

The portrayal of Michael Myers I'm sure will be up for debate, but to me it seems grounded in Zombie's vision for the character.  He is a force of nature ... and it's truly depicted in this film.  He is brutal, he is as much beast as he is man.  He is a product of both innate evil and the evil that distorted his upbringing.

The evolution of Laurie and Annie and the excellent Sheriff Bracket characters make this movie a truly excellent piece of film-making.  To me they are all believable ... and doomed.  The extra scenes in the Director's Cut go even further in fleshing out what their lives have become because of the traumas that have and are again unfolding around them.

My only two ""complaints"" would be the turn of Dr. Loomis from one movie to the next.  Unlike the three characters above, his turn to a greedy shill seemed a bit forced here.  I thought he was played better in the first film.  Here he seems almost like a cartoon character coming across a bit too goofy for this dark Zombie world.  The second ""complaint"" would be the ending ... For me, I just enjoyed the ending of the theatrical release ending better.  I liked the ambiguity of it and I think it left it a bit more open to interpretation.  Here there is a definitive close ... which as Zombie notes in the commentary was his intention.  I'm just not sure it's best given the ""descent into madness"" tale he was spinning.

Overall, an excellent film that in enhanced by it's new material.  Commentary from Zombie is definitely interesting as well and helps to frame his mindset for these characters.  It wouldn't surprise me if this movie moved away from it's stigma as a failure and into the world of a cult classic as time goes on.",1381881600,,2408,4.430523917995444
3300767,4,B0011G6FDI,"First I need to mention that I admire this film for its change from the original, zombie made it a different kind of story. Second, I feel bad for those who bought the unrated version, the only one I saw in store, because its a completely different film and story. The theatrical cut is the one that is the best, but I don't see why zombie didn't release both. I guess he didn't like the changes in the theatrical because they were to please the fans. Anyway watch the theatrical edition! You'll probably like it....Laurie isn't a complete jerk in this version lol",1381795200,,564,4.485436893203883
3300768,4,B0011G6FDI,"I am not a Rob Zombie fanboy.  I say this because I see a lot of reviews dismissed by fans of the original.  I get where all the hate comes from.  Rob's vision of Michael Myers is drastically different than Mr. carpenters and is inferior.  Then again, of all the rip offs that have come since the original, none have surpassed it.  What this film and the original remake try to do is deconstruct the original films.  They start from the sibling angle that Carpenter hated from the original Halloween II, and has crafted the idea of the deplorable American family that deals with its problems through repressed sexual angst and violence.  I was iffy on the first film, though I did like many of the scenes from it, but absolutely hated this version when I saw it in theaters.  It was the worst movie I had ever seen in theaters and I nearly walked out.  It was incoherent and silly.  The point is that these films are not trying to be the original.  That film already exists.  There is no way to improve upon it, so he is doing something unique and different.  No matter what you think about these films, you have to give him credit that there is something very unique to what he is doing and saying on film.

I still maintain that stance towards the theatrical version.  I bought the director's cut because I am a completionist that loves Halloween and owns ever version of every film in the series.  After watching it and loving it, I bought the theatrical version to see if I was just out of it in the theater that night, and it really is a night and day difference.  Unlike the first remake, where the director commentary is identical between the theatrical and director's cut, except for additional commentary on the additional or changed scenes in the director's cut, there is a whole new explanation and thought that goes into this director's cut.  Maybe Mr. Zombie was expecting a Halloween release and was forced to finish the film early, because he says that he really was struggling to get something coherent out.  He failed, but when given the time to go in and fix the film, his vision really does stand out.

Even with a complete vision, it is still very decisive amongst fans.  Where the first film was very much so this frantic mess of cutting and movement that seemed to focus on people that are suffering, this film is much slower and really focusing on the wounds.  I know that doesn't sound like a very big jump in concept, but it really is. The frantic pace is slowed down to show the damage that is being caused by the killer both literally and psychologically.  When we are hurt by the unimaginable, that thing almost always wins because even if we survive, we still kind of are left in the wake of that tragedy.

Another interesting dynamic that plays in the film is that it was shot in rural Georgia.  There is a drastic change of pace and mood compared to the first film, despite supposedly happening in the same imaginary town.  You really can get a sense of city vs. country and how we view violence and how we take it.  In the first film, the violence is cut away from most of the time, almost like a squeamish city slicker, where here we see some of the hardest to take prosthetics I have ever seen in film.

I know a lot of people don't get the white horse, and maybe it really is just a throw away, but I think it speaks to the idea that we are all trying to get back to this pure place in our minds that really is our childhood.  While the Carpenter film was trying to make us afraid of the unknown, Zombie wants us to face what we can understand and wants us to look hard at ourselves.  I think of all the nostalgia for a time gone by after 9/11.  We become cynical and impulsive and we break down.",1378512000,3,3731,4.363768115942029

Then a bullet train derails and smashes into the side of the building and ruptures the gas line causing a massive explosion sending meat and chunks flying everywhere......yes, we would call that a disaster and that is what Halloween 2 is a G-D DISASTER......WOW!

Also a insane amount of cussing (I usually have not problems but seriously over 50 F bombs)which feels as if the actors are using strong words to convey emotions that they aren't capable of acting out.

3300794,3,B0011G6FDI,"*WARNING: This Review Contains Spoilers*

If I'm being completely honest, I was very surprised when it was announced that there would be a sequel to Rob Zombie's ""Halloween"". From what I read at the time, Rob Zombie wanted to make ""Halloween 2"" entirely his own & not go based off of John Carpenter's ""Halloween 2"" & from what I saw in the film, he accomplished that.
The Movie: I'd written a review for Rob Zombie's ""Halloween"" & said it was dark, gory & there was profanity, much like his other movies, but his version of ""Halloween 2"" is 10x worse than his reimagining of ""Halloween"". This takes place immediately after Laurie Strode ""kills"" her brother, Michael Myers, we see her in the hospital suffering from pretty substantial injuries & she goes into surgery. Nothing is left to the imagination, we're shown broken bones, open wounds, blood, stitches & it's all graphically shown. Skip ahead a couple of years & Laurie is a completely different person, she's depressed, has tattoos, has dreadlocked hair, she's very much a changed person from when we first met her in ""Halloween"". However, who wouldn't change drastically if they found out their brother was a serial killer who killed your entire family? Another character who has changed is Danielle Harris' character, Annie, she's become a positive, vegan, recluse, which is again the polar opposite of her character in the 2007 version. I personally wasn't a fan of Laurie's new friends in this movie, unfortunately, like in the 2007 version, I found them to be rather irritating when they hung out together, but hey, that's just my opinion. The ending was a disappointment to me, the final scene with Anthony Perkins in Alfred Hitchcock's ""Psycho"" only it wasn't unique & haunting.

The BluRay: It works very well, no issues with the disc. I believe there are some pretty good special features with this, I haven't watched the movie in a couple of years, but if I remember correctly a fan of the film would enjoy the included features.

Overall: I don't want to sound like I absolutely hate this film, because I don't hate it, it's OK, it's just not as good as other horror movies out there. It's your typical Rob Zombie film.",1370476800,2,2188,4.798408488063661

3300799,4,B0011G6FDI,"Where Zombie's HALLOWEEN was a true re-imagining of a horror classic, HALLOWEEN II is a very original chapter in the Michael Myers' legacy.

Picking up exactly where the first one left off, we see Laurie Strode walking along the road after shooting Michael Myers in the face. She is soon picked up by the sheriff and taken to the hospital. After a short incident with the morgue truck carrying Michael's body hitting a cow, Michael comes alive and begins his journey to finish what he started. Two years pass by but the nightmare remains for Laurie who is now on medication and seeing a therapist to deal with her night terrors and feelings about that fateful Halloween night. Rob Zombie presents to us a very disturbed and broken Laurie, a much different character than we've seen before. Her cheeriness and vibrancy for life has almost vanished and what remains is a woman on the edge of a nervous breakdown. Now living with her friend Annie and her sheriff father, Laurie tries to get back into normality but any hope of that soon comes crashing down when she reads Dr. Loomis' new book revealing her bloodline to the Myers' family. And of course Michael's re-return to town.

I think Rob Zombie has created something to be very proud of. Besides the initial beginning and the fact that it's called HALLOWEEN II, I wouldn't exactly consider this film a remake of the original sequel. Instead this newest instalment to the franchise is a fresh look at the aftermath of Michael Myers' horrific murder spree. The film includes quite a lot of realism with the inclusion of the scars left on Laurie and Annie's bodies as well as Sam Loomis' decent into a media hungry ego maniac who cares more for the fame than the misfortune. I consider this film to be the stronger of the two and admire Rob for making this his own and not just another remake.",1367366400,3,1844,4.636085626911315

3300836,3,B0011G6FDI,"Rob Zombie's first installment of Halloween can ostensibly be called a remake.  Although it did depart a lot from the original film it did essentially tell the same story.  Just with twists.  This one is just a direct sequel to that film, and while it does pay homage to the original version of Halloween II for the first 15 to 20 mins, after that it is its own movie and story.  It has much more of the strangeness and over the top gore that Rob Zombie's other horror movies have.  Loomis is turned into a raging prick who is just out to make a buck, and Laurie is definitely screwed up from her experiences.

That part of the story I did find interesting.  It is the part of the original Laurie Strode story line we did not see.  How did she cope as a teenager after the events of that night.  If it were just her messed up life and Michael coming back I think the film would have been better.  But the whole channeling the dead mother angle and Laurie can sometimes feel Michael (like when he is eating the dog) was just stupid.  Also having Michael yell die when killing Loomis should not have happened.

It is definitely a dark and twisted sequel.  Many devoted fans of the original two movies will probably hate this one.  Also people who would otherwise give it a chance if it were a remake of the second film will not like it either.  For everyone else there will probably still be a lot of disagreement.  Some will love it, others will hate it.  I am pretty lukewarm to it.  For what it is, if you can divest it from following the Halloween story verbatim, it is not horrible.  It is certainly better than Halloween 6 and Halloween Resurrection, but it is nowhere near as good as the original two films or even as good as Zombie's remake of the first movie.",1362787200,2,1766,4.313069908814589

3300842,2,B0011G6FDI,"There is really not a lot of good things to say here as the original Halloween 2 is one of the greatest sequels ever in film history. This film seems to count itself as a sequel to Rob Zombie's remake, while still taking cues from the original 1981 sequel directed by Rick Rosenthal. This film certainly plays much more to Rob Zombie's sensibilities than the first one did. While the first outing was entertaining and original, it was just too damn off the mark. This film got even weirder.

Folks seem to either love or hate the Rob Zombie Halloween films. I don't hate them, but I certainly don't love them. Both are flawed and, again, while the first one was decent, this film was just a mess. More of a departure of what the Laurie Strode character is to represent and a greedy, self serving Dr. Loomis make this film a joke.

Yes, there are similar elements and plot points from earlier Halloween films, including the original Part II (the hospital and the sister angle, which we knew from the first Zombie installment). But this is not a remake of the original Part II.

The movie overall is just an absolute mess that 3/4 of the way in loses plot and is extremely violent, vulgar and brutal... It's not a nod to old school horror as that had little vulgarity and violence that was often subtle and was more about mild violence and heavy suspense.",1356825600,3,1353,4.491869918699187

3300874,2,B0011G6FDI,"I have been a horror fan all my life and Micheal Myers was always my favorite modern movie baddy. It boggles my mind to think of all the great things Zombie could have done with this.

What I was looking for was some kind of an explanation for WHY Micheal Myers is the way he is. I don't mean the insanity part.. that's easy. That has been done over and over again in hundreds of movies. I mean the thing that makes Myers different from just a regular murdering psycho: his ""powers"". How did he get so big and strong if he spent his entire youth sitting in a room making masks?  How did he learn to fight, hide, stalk, and operate machines? Instinct? pffft.. Why is he so indestructible? How can he survive being burned alive, shot over and over, stabbed innumerable times, taking horrendous falls, and getting run over by cars? Why does he have superhuman strength?

 Both the Carpenter and Zombie versions depicted him as being this way, but only the Carpenter version eventually seemed to sort of sneak up on the possibility of a reason with the ""Thorne"" deal. But then that wall was thoroughly dropped, and hasn't been picked up again since.

Evidently Rob Zombie believes that just being psycho somehow grants one superhuman powers, but it doesn't.
So to break  it all down: Pinhead and Freddie are demons. Norman Bates, Leatherface, and Hannibal Lechter are crazies, Jason and The Crow are undead super-zombies and Micheal Myers is..... what?

Rob Zombie had the chance to go there, and I think he should have taken it. It was unexplored territory, plain as day. But instead he squandered it all on making the franchise ""his"".

So anyway if you saw the first one and actually liked it, then you might get something out of this one. I didn't like either one and I look at it as an opportunity missed.",1355875200,6,1805,4.56656346749226

The original Halloween 2 has people you might care about, might want to not see killed, but this version portrays everyone as such pathetic scum that death is a release from their tortured exsistence.

so, halloween 2, as directed by rob zombie:

honestly, i loathed rob's first halloween. i thought it was boring, needlessly violent, and a generally uneven attempt to pay homage to carpenter's, while adding his own, new material. but i love rob's other flicks and his music, so i gave halloween 2 a whirl and loved it. i couldn't stop thinking about it. it unsettled me, it excited me, it made me wonder why i like horror movies in the first place.

from the opening scene of laurie wandering bloody through the streets, i was hooked. her hospital scenes are excruciating. as we bleed into her normal routine later on, her emotional distress felt very real and believable to me. i enjoyed seeing the family that she, annie and the sheriff forged from tragedy and horror. i found her visitations to margot kidder to be illuminating and interesting.

watching michael drift across the country side reminds me of shelley's frankenstein's monster. like the monster, michael is attempting to find himself, figure out his purpose, and act on it. to do this, reuniting his family seems the best option, and he acts on it. i also found many of these scenes beautiful, wonderfully, sumptuously shot. the night shots were especially effective, shrouded in dark blue, but clear and discernible.

loomis' character in halloween 2 seems to generate the most criticism of anything, so attached to donald pleasance's brilliant portrayal of sam loomis most people seem to be, but i like this about the movie. the characters are carpenter's in name and position only; in terms of behavior and personality, they are all zombie's. this doesn't bother me, as i knew i wasn't seeing carpenter's movie (or rick rosenthal's, in the instance of the original halloween 2). i like the friction it creates in my brain to see characters i have long thought of in one way, presented in a different, oppositional light. i mean, why not explore all possibilities. genre fiction has long explored the doppelganger; everything, star trek, superman, bewitched, stephen king, whatever, has explored the notion of a dark half. is sam loomis so sacred? and in the end, he realizes his mistake--his self-absorption and aggrandizement--and does what he can to make things right.

i love the vibe of this movie. rob gets a lot of grief for his ""white-trash"" sensibilities, but i like it. i like captain clegg. i like all the supporting characters that show up. i like the country-fried feel of this movie.

the savage nature of the violence deeply affected me. on the one hand, it was horrifying and forceful, on the other, gratifying to see the anarchistic way that rob views human life. i find this chilling. i also thought annie's death, though horrible and raw, was thoughtful and beautiful. all the friction between her and laurie made her death matter when it happened. it was deeply moving, and showed me that rob can maintain a gentle hand, even when depicting horrible violence.

additionally, the make-ups, by wayne toth, also deserve props. the opening scenes, especially of laurie's hand, i found to be very convincing. i also love the set design. each space, each room, is gloriously trashy. halloween 2 is totally punk rock.

and while it may have been a tad obvious and seemingly out of step thematically with the rest of the movie, i think the whole white horse stuff added a nice touch of fantasy to the movie. who says you can't dramatically juxtapose images? frankly, i find it rather daring of rob, and it was a much more effective and interesting exploration of inner michael than the first films dysfunctional-by-the-numbers family portrait. and look, honestly, the white horse connected this movie to two other movies i adore--blade runner and (to a lesser degree) legend.

halloween 2 is about family, ultimately, about michael's attempts to make sense of his life and reconstruct his family (albeit with a knife) the only way he knows how. similarly, michael's actions in the first movie have forced laurie, annie, and the sheriff to forge a necessary family out of each other. family drives this movie, which is all the more awesome, considering what a brutal, rockabilly good time it is.

it seems that rob can't win: try to take halloween and its' characters in his own direction--while, i might add, paying homage to a variety of movies throughout horror's illustrious and varied history--and he just gets crucified. i mean, we bitch (well, not me, i don't mind them) about remakes and sequels and lack of originality, and someone comes along and takes an established character, who, c'mon, only really had one classic movie to his resume, arguably two that were decent (not saying i don't like more than that, just, you know, objectively), and moves the character off in a different direction, different vibe, and he gets taken apart, like he's never made any meaningful contributions to the genre.

halloween 2 is refreshingly original, vibrant, chaotic, tense and interesting.  i think it's sort of rob's middle finger to the world, to make something so polarizing, and, for me, it works.  i find truth in it. i urge viewers, especially fellow horror fanatics, to step outside their boxes, take off their visors, and embrace this manic work of creativity.  it's a beautiful, horrible thing.",1354147200,7,5302,4.954954954954955

3300882,5,B0011G6FDI,I got to say that Rob Zombie rocked with this installment of the popular horror icon. He broght such freshness to the screen for Michael Myers. There couldn't have been a more serious and devoted filmmaker. He made Michael so much more aggresive in this one. Tyler Maine did an excilent job playing the famous knife wielding masked phycho path yet again. Which saddens me because alot of people did not like this one at all. Why? I'll never know. All I know is that when my hommie and I went to the theater to see this one we never looked at Michael Myers the same again. There was talk in hollywood about a possible third film but the only cath though was that Rob Zobie wasn't gonna be involved. It got shelved though. I sure do hope they do move foward from this storyline and have Rob at the helm.

It wasn't as good as the original 1978 horror classic of course,but it was still pretty good...but this movie. Oh my God! Did I mention how terrible this was??? The story is just way out there and does not make ANY sense at all! The acting is absolutley horrid. And what the hell is ""Weird Al"" Yankovic doing in a Halloween film anyway?

Family Is Forever!! This is a personal favorite Rob Zombie film!!! This is by far the most heavy, emotional and original ""sequel"" ever made for a horror movie!!! The brutal and NON-Formula (for Halloween sequels in general) violence in this movie is only matched by the inner turmoil we all can have inside of us.

This movie is just as violent and sadistic as the previous if not more so. However that does not mean it is better in any way. We all know that in the last 5-7 years remakes of Classic horror movies have been a dime-a-dozen. Now in my personal opinion the majority of them have been pretty lame. this movie does seem to carry some weight in the aspect that it is a new look on the series while still keeping some original details. If you have watched the original movies which were born from John Carpenters Halloween then you may not care for this movie. However teens who have not experienced the original movies will probably enjoy this ""new"" look on Halloween. Overall i picked this up to add to my collection because it is not entirely horrible. If you can find this film at a good price $6-8 it is worth adding to your movie collection. Heck it is even worth watching with your friends on Halloween Night.

I will say though is you are a fan of the Halloween sequels... you don't want to see this. It has nothing to do with those paint by numbers films. (and thank god) This is something very different, and a level above your usually horror stuff.",1341532800,2,568,4.461538461538462

3300935,5,B0011G6FDI,"I will start this review off by saying that I am one of the few horror fans out there that prefer Rob Zombie's ""Halloween"" to John Carpenter's ""Halloween"". I know, it's blasphemy and I will go down in horror hell for saying such a thing. But I personally love the back story that Zombie gave Michael and feel as though everything about the film (from the acting to the directing to use of music) was just about perfect. Everything about the film really worked for me and it was with appreciation that I approached the sequel. Going in, I had heard nothing but TERRIBLE things. I mean downright AWFUL comments. ""One of the worst horror sequels ever made"" and ""Rob Zombie will burn in hell for what he has done to this series"" were some of the nicer comments. So is ""Halloween II"" really as awful as horror fans have made it out to be?

In a short flashback, Deborah Myers (Sheri Moon Zombie) visits her son, a young Michael Myers (Chase Wright Vanek), at Smith's Grove Sanitarium. Deborah gives Michael a white horse statuette as a gift. Michael says that the horse reminds him of a dream he had of Deborah's ghost, all dressed in white and leading a horse down the sanitarium halls toward Michael, telling him she was going to bring him home. Moving ahead fifteen years, after having shot an adult Michael (Tyler Mane), Laurie Strode (Scout Taylor-Compton) is found wandering around in a state of shock and covered in blood by Sheriff Brackett (Brad Dourif). Brackett takes Laurie to the emergency room. Meanwhile, the paramedics pick up the Sheriff's daughter Annie (Danielle Harris) and Michael's psychiatrist Dr. Loomis (Malcolm McDowell), who are still alive after having been attacked by Michael, and take them to the hospital. Presumed dead, Michael's lifeless body is loaded into a separate ambulance. When the driver has a traffic accident Michael awakens and escapes the ambulance, walking toward a vision of Deborah dressed in white and leading a white horse.

Michael appears at the hospital, and begins murdering everyone he comes across on his way to Laurie. Trapped in a security outpost at the gate, Laurie watches as Michael tears through the walls with an axe, but just as he tries to kill her, Laurie wakes up from the dream. It is actually one year later and Laurie is now living with the Bracketts. Michael's body has been missing since last Halloween--still presumed dead--and Laurie has been having recurring nightmares about the event. While Laurie deals with her trauma through therapy, Loomis has chosen to turn the event into an opportunity to write another book. Meanwhile, Michael has been having visions of Deborah's ghost and a younger version of himself, who instructs him that with Halloween approaching it is time to bring Laurie home; so he sets off for Haddonfield.

I know that most horror fans seem to despise this movie but I find it to be a beautiful shot, misunderstood gem of a horror film. I admire Zombie for not doing a straight up remake of the original sequel and I like how you actually are able to see the emotional grief that the first travesty has caused its characters. We are able to see Laurie and Annie as real, flesh and blood characters that are each trying to deal with this travesty the only way that they know how. It's not a perfect film (the horse imagery is out of place to say the least) but it is an ambitious film and that's more than you can say about most horror movies today.",1337990400,4,3443,4.697019867549669

Rob Zombie tries too hard to go out with a bang, and in doing so, skips a good storyline and real scares in exchange for an attempt at shock value and gore. This movie could be classified under the 'torture porn' category (this is not a good thing). Rent it if you must, but don't spend the money buying it. I'll sum it up for you: Michael Myers kills everyone (some while not fully clothed), and the 'surprise' ending isn't really a surprise (as it's alluded to for most of the movie).",1329004800,2,712,4.32089552238806

Michael has been living off the land recovering from a gun shot to the face for the last 2 years until Baby...Mom says its time to go home.  This is the way Michael was destined to be portrayed.

The plot is soooo far removed from the original {& far superior} Halloween II, that it should of died a quick death right from its conception. True, you shouldn't make a remake EXACTLY like the original, but that doesn't mean you should stray TOO FAR from the original. Actor Malcolm Mc Dowell's awful portrayal of Dr. Loomis is appalling. He makes Actor Donald Pleasance's BRILLIANT portrayal of the good Doctor cringe in embarrassment. Same with Actress Scout Taylor Compton, who portrayed Laurie Strode.

3300968,2,B0011G6FDI,"Every writer injects a little bit of his or her own personality into their work.  It's a very basic fact of the craft.  Characters may be from their own hometown or loosely based on themselves. Stephen King was in a horrible car accident, and guess what, so was the main character in ""Duma Key.""  But what sets good writers apart from bad ones is how well they can wrap those autobiographical elements in characters and places that AREN'T based on themselves.  You have to be able to craft a place that's real, believable, and populated with characters who feel both authentic and different from each other.  And that's where Rob Zombie is a complete failure.  He claims that Halloween II is entirely his vision, and that is the truest thing that's ever been said of this movie.  Sadly, though, Rob Zombie is a man possessed of a great deal of tunnelvision.  He likes gore, f-words, heavy metal music, and strippers.  So every element of this film reeks of those things.  There are topless dancers where topless dancers don't make sense.  Every line of dialogue sounds like Zombie himself could have uttered it.  You could really mix and match a great majority of the characters and the dialogue wouldn't be affected by this at all because they all sound like each other.  They all sound like Rob Zombie.

Of course, Rob wanted this movie to be different than its predecessor.  So he decided to make Michael Myers a real person.  To believe this premise, you have to believe that Myers can survive a great deal more punishment than any human being is capable of.  You have to believe that being locked in a psych ward for most of his life somehow resulted in a human Myers growing into a musclebound behemoth. You have to believe that a man who has been institutionalized all his life and has the education of a 12 year old can somehow be resourceful enough to survive living in the wilderness for 2 years.  You have to believe also that a deranged, psychopatic killer who ISN'T motivated by supernatural forces but rather by an instinctive desire to murder can somehow lay low for 2 years and then suddenly decide to start killing again.

Zombie wants you to believe this is a deeper, more psychological exploration of Michael Myers the character.  But do we really see anything in the film that goes deeper than Myers having mommy issues?  No. It's a shallow and contrived plot convention that has been used lots of times before. Norman Bates, anyone?  Then you have Zombie throwing all of that out the window by introducing a psychic link between Myers and Laurie, which undercuts his desire to leave the supernatural out of it. Laurie is no deep character either.  She's upset because, like, her parents are dead.  Didn't you hear her?  Her parents...are...dead. And she's really upset.  So of course she needs to go to a party.  Because that's what disturbed kids with dead parents do, right?

I was a fan of Zombie's first two movies because they didn't aspire to be anything more than creepy, bloody films that served as Zombie's homage to grindhouse and exploitation. They had trashy characters and f-words and nudity, and they were great because of it.  But with Halloween and Halloween II, Zombie has proven that he has a very shallow field of vision that can't possibly contain anything that isn't Rob Zombie.",1320105600,3,3320,4.715277777777778
3300969,5,B0011G6FDI,"This was an awesome film. I think the majority of negative reviews come from people who don't understand that Rob Zombie doesn't make movies to appeal to the mainstream. This isn't Halloween H20. Zombie trys to portray Myers as realistic as possible. If Myers was a real person, how would he survive? Zombie shows this by portraying Myers as a Bum, who lives on the countryside and survives by feasting on animals that no normal person would eat, such as a dog. I thought this was an amazing concept. It goes very well with how the first Zombie Halloween movie showed Myers past and how a person in real life might end being like him. This is another classic up there with The Devils Rejects, a previous Zombie movie which was also a great film. However, something truly genius will only be appreciated by a minority.",1320019200,,817,4.602739726027397
3300970,1,B0011G6FDI,"First we are treated to a 20 minute psych-out as Zombie creates a homage to Rick Rosenthal's original sequel, leading us to think this may be another rehash, but no it's all a dream. Boo.

However, you think things might be ok, since Zombie appears to be wanting to go his own way this time and create something original. Unfortunately he has almost nothing original to add.

Zombie tries to go artsy with these visitations from Myers dead mother. (glowing white like some sort of angel and being followed about by a white horse) I'm assuming this is just Myers mental state and not a real ghost...since I have no idea why Myers mother would come back and direct her son to kill people...unless Zombie just couldn't help channeling Jason Voorhees once again into this thing. In fact, the more I think about it, the more it seems that Zombie really should have done a Friday the 13th reboot. He seems to love those mother-son/abusive childhood elements.

Otherwise he throws in a lot a elements that are cobbed from the various bad sequels: The psychic link between Myers/Laurie (mirroring the psychic link between Myers/Jamie from Halloween V), The bizarre ""vacation"" Myers takes between Halloween holidays (from Halloween IV & V. What is he doing all that time?! Apparently he`s eating dogs all year and no one seems to notice)

The one thing Zombie does add that is his own is his treatment of the Dr Loomis character: he destroys it. This more than anything reinforces my belief in Zombie's obsessive love for the Myers character. Zombie is now not just happy with making the original film's villain the hero, but turning Dr Loomis into the films villain! Here, Loomis is just another exploitive, selfish element of the society that Myers rages against. It's no wonder Myers went bad, he didn't even have good doctors treating him. The whole character could have been excised, but I'm assuming Zombie got a thrill out of corrupting the hero.

Brad Dourif does a good job as Sheriff Brackett, surprisingly being an authority figure that doesn't seem to represent Evil Society, (breaking from Zombies usual theme) However, rather than representing an oppressive or exploitive authority figure, he actually seems to represent the incompetent authority figure. Of course this all comes crashing down on Brackett's head as his own daughter becomes a victim of Myers, aka Zombie's personification of rage against society. The implication being that if people like Brackett had been able to do their job right, such forces would not be unleashed.

As far as the killings go, Zombie indulges in soulless violence. He seems to think that SFX and quick cutting are enough. Simple brutality is supposed to awe us here. What Zombie does not realize is that that era is over. Audiences are so desensitized now that it's not enough. He does not seem to have an inkling that creating a world we can believe in and characters we can care about are how one creates an emotional response.

The ending is a convoluted mess I don't feel like explaining in detail...suffice to say that Zombie rips off the ending of Halloween IV. He just takes way more time and tries to cover up the simplistic idiocy of it all with gobs of cryptic nonsense.

What are we to make of all this? That Hollywood has given up and decided that fan-fics are the way to go now? How long until some internet goober's Halloween fan-fic porno is considered worthy of a film treatment? Is the film industry really going to stop allowing artists to make films and just allow talent-less panderers hold up a mirror to the audience?",1320019200,21,3583,4.7957860615883305
3300971,1,B0011G6FDI,This is the stupidest and worst movie ever made. The use of blood and gore is so disgusting and overkill. The actors/characters are horrible idiots. Don't waste your time or money on this POS.  Zombie is a moron not a film maker. It's amazing why people would put up money to make such a POS. John Carpenter should sue as*wipe Zombie for taking his movie and ruining it with this waste of film...I'm just happy I didn't pay to watch this abomination.,1319932800,16,450,4.487804878048781
3300972,2,B0011G6FDI,I just want to start by saying I like Rob Zombie. His music is good and normally his movies are too. Halloween 1 by Rob Zombie was an astoundingly fresh take on the decades old Haddonfield horror story. It was dark and reminiscent of the 70's. Rob is obviously sentimental about this period like me. You had to be there for you young uns. However H2 severely let me down because the lives of everybody in this movie were so disgustingly trashy that you were hoping for them to get killed and by the end of the movie you feel like you've been dragged through the gutter. It is very depressing and just makes you want to throw it off like a coat that's too heavy. We forgive you though Rob because we know you're capable of much better. Try again and maybe we'll give you another chance.,1319846400,3,785,4.3108108108108105
3300983,2,B0011G6FDI,"After watching the remake, I was looking forward to the sequel.  It has elements from the original sequel, but goes off in various directions. I was not thrilled with the casting of young Michael in the first film and even less with the updated version. The depth taken to reveal more of young Michael was unnecessary and distracting. As were the spirit sequences with Michael's mother; which to me seemed forced to give Mrs. Zombie more screen time. In addition, the older Michael just didn't seem like Michael.  It's definitely more gory and dirty than the first; overall long and disappointing.",1319760000,10,597,4.900990099009901

3300985,5,B0011G6FDI,"Rob Zombie's Halloween II is my favorite since the original(a record previously held by H2O).It has a surprisingly  fresh and dark story. Some of the images in this film are deeply disturbing(SPOILER!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!)including the scenes where michael eats a dog,kills a man by crushing his head with his foot,and the whole hospital scene. I think that Mr. Zombie is sick in the head,but this may be what attracts me to his movies. He ans Human Centipede director Tom Six don't care about the audience's stomach! They are just out to make a film that will shock people,yet that people will like. They are artists and this(though disturbing) is their art.",1318550400,,662,5.073394495412844

The only character change from the original was Mike Myers as a child.  Other than that, the movie was awesome and I suggest for anyone who like horror, music, or Rob Zombie in general.",1314921600,,350,4.612903225806452
3300987,2,B0011G6FDI,"First off, let me say that i've been a big fan of John Carpenter's ""Halloween"" since I first saw it in 1980. Parts 2-wherever they left off...not so much. But i've always believed strongly that the original was, and is, one of the greatest horror movies ever made. Carpenter understood that mounds of gore and constant 'false' scares (the cat jumps out of the closet, etc) did nothing for a film's fear factor-in fact, the director is always far more important than the content. If you don't believe that, watch Hitchcock's ""Psycho""...then watch the remake. If you can stay awake through it.
  That being said, there's room in the genre for an artist that liberally piles on the carnage and shocks, as long as that artist has a vision beyond his potential paycheck for the inevitable sequel(s). Once I saw Rob Zombie's ""The Devil's Rejects"", I felt certain that the innovative musician had truly found his niche. He successfully created a film that could truly be called the only other possible compliment one can bestow upon a horror movie besides 'terrifying'...that compliment being 'disturbing'.
  Naturally, when i heard Carpenter's classic would be getting the old 'revision' treatment, I was mildly angry. Does EVERY good-to-great motion picture need to be re-enacted for the attention deficient generation? Still, at the announcement of Zombie being given the honors, I had to assume that an essence of actual quality was likely. I also felt a bit saddened for the former 'White Zombie' frontman-just as 'Rejects' had introduced a potentially potent new force in the horror film industry, i knew there was no better way to knock people off your bandwagon than screwing up a beloved classic, especially one made by the equally admired Carpenter.
  But once I finally decided to check out Mr. Zombie's remake, some 4 years after it's release, I was surprised, even shocked. This was one 're-imagining' that actually lived up to that oft-used, rarely-enacted word. Succinctly put, Rob Zombie's ""Halloween"" scared the bodily fluids out of me. It picked up where ""Devil's Rejects"" had left off in the 'disturbing' department. Monumentally graphic, but exuding a confidence lacking from other 'unstoppable serial killer of horny teenagers' flicks, I viewed each ensuing scene with dread-the good kind. By the time it was over, sleep was but a distant fantasy. Basically, it freaked me out.
  So I found myself almost eager to check out Zombie's version of ""Halloween II""-as little as I cared for the original film with the same title, I assumed the lack of high standards to live up to would just loosen the director's reigns even more. And after a brutally violent first act, which mostly took place in the hospital that housed poor Laurie Strode, I was pleasantly surprised to see that Zombie wasn't going to follow that cliched, limiting format that so hurt the original ""II""-that is, the action remaining inside the hospital for the movie's duration.
  Imagine my disappointment when, as the film dragged on, it gradually dawned on me that Zombie, in fact, had no grand vision to display. With each increasingly violent murder, it became obvious that Zombie had fallen into the ol' 'crazy masked psycho' trap-that is, depending on the audience's visceral reaction to the bloody massacres onscreen to mask the absence of any real imagination or creativity.
  Unlike his previous Michael Myers treatment, I had no such reservations about going to sleep once the final credits had rolled. It wasn't awful-there were some genuinely original and shocking moments scattered amongst the dreck; but the final verdict is in, and it's clear that Rob Zombie took the money and ran. Hopefully, it won't damage what i feel is still a very bright future, and will only exist as a blip on the road to horrifying greatness for the only director who can be called 'More human than human'.",1313712000,3,3877,5.003105590062112
3300988,2,B0011G6FDI,"Halloween II is absolutely dreadful.  I never would have guessed a horror movie that focused around nonstop violence, lots of blood and frequent stabbings would stink as much as it does, but well, it's true!  It's 100% true in fact.  I hated this film.

Oh sure, it starts out fine.  A nurse gets stabbed, and a teenage girl runs for her life down a hospital hallway the moment she witnesses a huge figure running towards her with a knife.  Eventually however, the storyline seems to go away completely and turn into a mess of random killings and disjointed storyline segments focusing entirely around this one girl.  The storyline isn't coherent enough and it showed.  People would just appear out of nowhere, and they'd die.  Zero concern for storyline consistency.

Plus there was a constant question buzzing inside of my head ""Why am I torturing myself with a low budget horror film?""  The acting, the stabbings and the supposed ""suspense"" were all really predictable and cliched.  The only truly interesting aspect is that people would die while classic rock songs were being played in the background such as 10cc's ""The Things We Do for Love"", the Moody Blues ""Nights in White Satin"" and Lynyrd Skynyrd's ""What's Your Name?""  That was the only interesting part of the movie- the song selection while death would occur.

I highly recommend avoiding this disaster of a horror movie.  The storyline was confusing, the deaths were predictable and bland, and the level of excitement just wasn't high enough to leave me with much of an impression.",1313366400,2,1547,4.8961538461538465
3300989,1,B0011G6FDI,"First of all, I like some of Rob Zombie's music. I have nothing against him. But he tried to push ""zombie"" type stuff in this movie and not only did it not work, but it ruined the whole point.

In the original movies, the character of Michael is mysterious, he is silent, and there is almost a sadness or feeling that he is missing something deep down. In the Zombie films though (at least this one, haven't seen the first one for a long time) this character is completely gone. Now Michael is apparently some old guy with a beard who eats raw dog meat and actually makes grunting noises while he kills. Now his character is protrayed as angry, ruthless, and just out to hurt people, completely unlike the original Michael.

The main thing I hate about this film is that Rob Zombie tried to make this into some sort of shocking grindhouse zombie movie. Michael's sister apparently lives in this middle class house, but her bedroom and bathroom look like the back room of some heavy metal band. Posters with cuss words all over them, a poster of Charles Manson, basically something that has nothing to do with the story but had to be added because it's a ""zombie"" movie now. When she finds out she is Michael's sister and becomes angry, she insists that she wants to go partying (really realistic). So they go to some party with people in really unrealistic mostly gothic looking costumes and topless women just hanging around dancing (is this a halloween party or a Zombie concert?).

The death scenes just *had* to be made especially disgusting, such as Michael stomping on someone's head, sawing someone's head off, etc. As expected there are crude jokes about dead girls and general depravity.

In the first movie I was actually interested in the storyline about Michael's long lost sister. In this movie it gets old. Now the ghost of her dead mother and Michael as a child follow him around and there is some weak storyline where Michael is supposed to find her so they can become a family again. In the end there is no conclusion to this.

Strippers, violence, sex, goth chicks, heavy metal, parties, topless women, the F bomb repeated over and over, am I missing anything? this whole film made me feel like I was watching a backstage movie of a Rob Zombie concert. Poorly done.",1312848000,10,2283,4.613300492610837
3300990,5,B0011G6FDI,"The backlash against this film is ridiculous.  I'll admit, when I first saw it in theatres - I hated it for the first half of the movie.  I felt betrayed by the use of the hospital scene - and I thought it was just grim and disgusting and didn't feel like a spooky horror movie you can sit back and enjoy while munching on popcorn.  Well, Rob Zombie doesn't make movies like that.  He isn't playful or tongue in cheek.  What Rob Zombie has done here was to take well-worn mythology and turn it into something realistic and evil and horrifying.

Don't get me wrong - the original ""Halloween"" is the greatest slasher movie of all time.  In fact, I have more of an issue with the first remake being even necessary.  However, because it was remade, and because there was a sequel - I feel it deserves a serious look.  I own the original Halloween series, but let's be honest- they're pretty weak.  (Don't get me wrong I love them but they fall flat compared to Nightmare on Elm Street or even Friday the 13th).  However, this movie is disturbing, disgusting, and horrifying.  And I think that was the point.  Rob wasn't making a movie about a spooky boogieman who can't die.  He was making a movie about Michael Myers as a very real and very evil person.  Moreover, the exploration of the mental strain placed on Laurie Strode as well as the rest of Haddonfield in the aftermath of the first film's events is compelling and very well done.

The movie is sometimes difficult to watch - and I don't mean because of the violence.  It seems Rob did get somewhat corny with Laurie becoming a gothic-type recluse and screaming her feelings to anyone who will listen.  On the other hand - it does emphasize what it could be like for someone living their life after such an ordeal.  The movie doesn't entertain in the way that many horror movies do - in that we're rooting for the killer and laughing afterward.  Here, Rob Zombie shows just how scary such behavior is.  Michael Myers isn't a hero - he's a dangerous psychopath who cannot stop killing.  Rob's take on the characters is very refreshing including, love it or hate it, making Loomis into a huge douchebag.  I wish they would have released both versions on one disc - because I have a tough time deciding which ending I like better.  Even the changes in end titles music is a characteristic that makes a big difference.  It's a shame Rob won't be doing a third one.  You might be glad he's not - but I'll bet there were people who were glad Tim Burton didn't do the third Batman movie and look how that turned out.",1312848000,4,2564,4.436830835117773
3300991,2,B0011G6FDI,"The title says ""Halloween II"" and it pretty much is more of the same from writer/director Rob Zombie... unfortunately, all Zombie can seem to manage is angry white trash yelling at each other and dropping f-bombs every other word, so if that's your cup of tea, then this movie's for you. In all honesty, this film does seem to be a step up from Zombie's previous entry, but that's not really saying much as almost any goofball with a camcorder could probably whip up a more decent movie than Zombie can with tons of money at his disposal. At any rate, Zombie seems to tone down the psychological mumbo-jumbo that permeated throughout his first film, which would be a good thing if he didn't replace it with just as heavy-handed spiritual mumbo-jumbo that has something to do with Michael reforming his family at any cost.

To this end, you get a lot of shots of Sheri Moon Zombie walking around in a flowing white dress like some sort of celestial being and toting a white horse that has some sort of ham-handed link to Michael's state of mind. Even with an opening quote that sort-of explains the whole 'white horse' schtick, that whole plot point really just serves the dual purpose of allowing Zombie to try some artsy-fartsy film composition and to shoehorn his wife into the film yet again. She mostly goes around muttering cryptic lines that are supposed to mean something, but I'm pretty sure these scenes are there so Rob can get some sort of fantasy Ridley Scott aspirations out of his system.

So, with that counting as the motivation for Michael (more or less), it's on to a film filled with just as many unlikable characters as the first one. Returning as Laurie Strode is Scout-Taylor Compton, who manages the rare feat of being even more annoying than in the first film. Obviously, she didn't take any acting lessons in between the two films and here she is, yet again, to force the audience to not even remotely like the film's central protagonist. There's no two ways around it - she's terrible, terrible, terrible. Need convincing? Watch the scene where she finds out she's Michael's sister and then runs to her work pals to party it up because she's tired of being the good girl. At one point, she exclaims: ""I want to party! I mean, f--- it, guys..."" in one of cinema's all-time worst line readings. It's so embarassing, it physically hurts. I mean, my friends and I made our own backyard films and we knew our acting was terrible, but this here... this right here... is supposedly a major motion picture and this is what we get for our lead? This girl needs to stop, take a breath, and reconsider her choice of profession. Sure, I'm being hard on her, but it's the truth. Here you have a character who was made sympathetic and likable in the previous incarnation by Jamie Lee Curtis (and it was the role that effectively launched her career) and I'm not saying Compton has to do the same thing, but just some sort of attempt at acting would be appreciated. Not this flailing around, screaming nonsense. Have you ever seen a kid in a department store completely lose it and start going into a fit because they don't want to be in the store anymore? That's kind of what Compton's acting is like and it's just as annoying. The average filmgoer will also have the same reaction that the average shopper would have upon seeing this: ""please remove this screaming child from my sight. Please leave it at home before subjecting the general public to this menace."" If there were ever a more distinct vision that would endorse birth control, I have yet to find it.

Anyways, she's useless and is just as grating as the last film. Also returning is Danielle Harris as Annie Brackett - one of only two likable characters in the film (the other being her dad Sheriff Brackett, played by Brad Dourif). She's a little more toned down in this film and a heckuva lot more likable. Unfortunately, she doesn't get to do much besides be a doormat for Laurie's drama. Ultimately, her fate is sealed and it looks like she won't be back for the next installment, which is sad because this series needed more Danielle Harris (once again, I'm left wondering how much better this film would be if Harris had played Laurie Strode. Then again, I also wonder how much better this series would be if they'd stop letting Rob Zombie wander on set to direct things.)

Malcolm McDowell is back as well, but it's such a thankless role that it really doesn't seem to matter whether he's here or not. It's interesting to see the character of Sam Loomis pull away from being the ultimate force of good and turn into the ultimate force of douche, but I guess I just don't get the purpose of it. Typically, Loomis is the yin to Michael's yang and it's a bit like having a Sherlock Holmes with no Moriarty the way Zombie presents him here. To be honest, I don't mind screwing with the formula, but there's no one here who really provides any sort of a threat to Michael and I guess it just seems to make the confrontations all the more meaningless because whatever's going on with Michael is going on inside of his head (which is filled with white ponies and Sheri Moon Zombie uttering bizarre fortune cookie dialogue.)

Like the first film, it's fun to pick out the random cameos from faces that may or may not be familiar - hey, Margot Kidder! Is that Dauber from ""Coach""? Oh, Frogurt from ""Lost""... nice to see you... and there you go through a car windshield... Bye! Other than these little moments, there's not much else in the way of casting that's anything to comment on. So, on to the film itself...

The film picks up from where the last film left off and it sort of jumps over major plot points without too much to-do about it. Laurie shot Michael in the face at the end of the last movie, but here he is walking around like some sort of ersatz Unabomber. He's mostly just hanging out in a shack somewheres, biding his time until next Halloween (actually two Halloweens from the previous Halloween - guess he took a year off to travel... or eat dogs... or whatever...) Though everyone makes a big deal about Michael's body disappearing, nobody seems to have gone looking for it and while I'm not sure how far away he is from Haddonfield in this movie, it sure seems like the cops gave up pretty quickly on finding him. Or maybe they never even looked for him in the first place - I dunno; cops in these types of films never seem to bother with procedure or with basic police work, so I guess it's okay. Laurie's still bothered by her previous encounter with Michael - so much so, that she has a 20 minute dream sequence involving a hospital after her initial attack from the first film (I guess this is a bit of an homage to the original Halloween II, but Zombie wisely chose not to restrict his sequel just to this one setting.) She's living with the Brackett's and, in general, just being kind of a pain in the ass (there's one scene where she hangs out with her new work friends and they rock out to ""Kick Out the Jams"" - which blew my mind that these kids would even know of that song, but I guess this is one aspect of teenage life that Zombie got right, whether intentionally or unintentionally. I'm not a music snob by any means, but I always found it funny when teenagers start to discover music that was made before today. They always seem to ignore any sort of context in which the song came about and instead choose to just rock out - kind of like listening to a 60's era protest song, but being completely ignorant about anything having to do with Vietnam. It's a moment that's just kind of humorous, exciting and sad all at once.)

Sorry about that tangent... so, Halloween comes around and Michael makes his way to Haddonfield and kills pretty much anything that gets in between him and his sister. There's a lot of Michael just walking into situations where he kills everything in sight and it sort of makes you wish for the way they did things in the old ""Halloween"" films where Michael would just drive to wherever he was going. There was no screwing around with random rednecks, strip joint a-holes or little kids who never learned not to talk to strangers. As funny as the thought of Michael Meyers driving around town was to me in the old films, I do kind of miss that as it gave the films a weird sort of charm that was lacking in your typical slasher film of the era. At any rate, Michael eventually gets to his sister and there's a lot of blah-blah-blah about being a family again, but Loomis finally shows up and everyone fires a lot of rounds of bullets into the Big Double M and he supposedly dies (then again, he was shot in the face in the first film, so why anyone thinks this is going to work this time is beyond me... then again, we've already mentioned that these cops aren't firing on all cylinders here, so whatever.) Then the movie ends with a completely ridiculous ending that tries to be arty-farty and just downright retarded all at the same time. I don't really know what Zombie's going for here at the end and, honestly, I don't care. I hate Laurie in this film, so anything having to do with her just goes over my head because I can't work up enough investment in the character. In fact, I just found myself thinking of other things whenever Laurie was on screen. Things such as the following:

1.) What era does this movie take place in? I asked this in the last film as well and this film seems to not conform to any specific timeline either. It's clearly a post-2000 era, but all that's ever on TV is old-ass cartoons and The Moody Blues (singing ""Nights in White Satin"" - presumably because Sheri Moon Zombie wanders around in white satin... subtlety doesn't seem to be Rob Zombie's strong point.)

2.) Though Michael killed a lot of people in the last film, the residents of Haddonfield don't seem concerned that his body was never found. No one moves away and no one seems to let this fact impair their enjoyment of the holiday. The parents even let their kids trick or treat on Halloween with no adult supervision. Worst. Parents. Ever.

3.) Why does everyone have a Halloween costume that's way more elaborate than anything you're ever likely to see ever? You see a lot of that in the Halloween party sequence. Speaking of... how old are these characters? In the last film, Laurie and company were still in high school, so at best, they were seniors and probably 18, but though it's only 2 years later, they attend a monster blowout that features lots of alcohol and rampant nudity and none of the cops seem to mind that this happens. They just all seem to hang out at the police station. Um, if cops knew there was some huge party going down that would probably be serving alcohol to minors, they would be camped outside that party all evening long busting everybody. Yet, like the parents of Haddonfield, the cops seem to have no clue. What's going on in this town?

4.) How come the town strip joint is empty all night? It's not even midnight yet and there's no one there. Most strip joints are open till 2 or 3 in the morning and, even at closing time, there's still a ton of people there. Wouldn't a strip joint that advertises being the home of Michael Meyers' mom be jumping the night before Halloween? Where is everybody in this town? Why did that one guy have to take out the garbage at the strip joint? Who made that garbage? There's no one there to produce any garbage. Why does this scene exist?

5.) So, Laurie survives an attack by a serial killer in the first film and is pretty screwed up because of it, but for some reason, she decorates her room with a giant poster of Charles Manson, one of the most well-known serial killers of all time? WTF?

6.) The entire Meyers family has some sort of psychic link.... oooookay.... So, this only kicks in if Michael is eating a dog and Laurie is eating vegetarian pizza at the same time? Where was this in the last movie? Suddenly, the Meyers' are psychics now? If only she had cool Firestarter powers like Drew Barrymore... or maybe she could have fought Michael with her psychic ninja powers like that one chick did against Jason Voorhees in that one Friday the 13th movie... That might've been better than what I'm watching now.

7.) How come Michael wears his mask sometimes, but not all the time? In the last movie, it was a big deal that Michael wore the mask because he was no longer Michael Meyers the sweet little kid and he just sort of regressed into his mask which was a way to deal with his being a killer. Now it just sort of appears and disappears at will. I guess no one wins on this because, frankly, he looked dumb with this mask on and he looked dumb without it on, so whatever.

All in all, this is a pretty lackluster film that doesn't deliver a whole lot. On the plus side, it has a ton of gore for the hardcore fans and it does have one scene that was nicely done and created a great amount of tension: when Annie is attacked and she slowly looks up to see Michael standing off to the side, the film then jumps to slow-motion and Zombie finally delivers the sense of dread he's been trying to get for two films now. For me, this was the one standout scene of the film and it showed just a touch of the right effect at the right time in an effort to truly play off the absolute dread that should exist in that scene. Wonderfully done, but not enough to redeem the entire movie. However, I will give Rob the credit on that one - if more of the movie were like this scene, it would be much easier to recommend this film.

As it stands, there's not a lot here to recommend. If you were a fan of Zombie's first film, then you'll probably carry on liking this one. If you weren't a fan of his previous film, then there's not much here that'll change your mind about Zombie as a filmmaker. Overall, I would say that this film was better than the first, but not by much. A good scene here, a really brutal gore scene there and the rest is just filler. Zombie doesn't really leave much to go on at the end of this one so it remains to be seen when and if another sequel will take place. For my money, I'd still be interested to see him just do his own riff on ""Halloween III: Season of the Witch"" and I think it'd be hilarious if both part 3's of both series had nothing to do with Michael Meyers, but I guess we'll just have to wait and see.

Maybe Zombie did what no other person could do... maybe he effectively killed off Michael Meyers for good.",1312675200,10,14461,4.426371149511645
3300992,4,B0011G6FDI,"This movie is a good sequel. The beginning reminded me of the original sequel which I loved. The whole movie was pretty good & I own it. I can see why so many people think this movie is atrocious, but they are failing to see the symbolism in this movie. At the beginning it gives you the symbolic definition of a white horse, which is a sign for purity. The visions in the movie that Laurie have are showing her connection with Michael and they are not just pointless. This movie was pretty good but nothing can compare to the first two. I like how Zombie took a different approach to the story instead of just re-doing it as we have seen before (Friday the 13th, which I thought was awful.) HIs take on it adds a whole new perspective and people need to realize that. Great movie, just wish there was more of Michael chasing Laurie whic freaked me out in the first place with the originals.",1309910400,,891,4.309523809523809

Surely purists of the original Halloween will undoubtedly keep the flame burning by trashing Zombie's latest horror flick. Either that or they will just sit this one out to wait for the Redbox rental & Netflix. In my honest opinion, I'd much rather be stabbed to death by Michael Myers himself than to sit through another one of those inane sequels to the original Carpenter flick. In fact, I'm kinda disappointed that no one acknowledges let alone admit that Zombie is actually breathing life into the lackluster horror genre. Obviously, Rob has stolen the crown of bloody horror from Bava, Franco, & I daresay even Argento. Eli Roth, eat your heart out dude! All hail the new King of mainstream horror & his name is Rob Zombie!

In the very first montage, we see a young Myers visited by his mother (played by Zombie's beloved wife) where he explains that his dreams of one day reuniting with the family. His mother then gives him a white horse toy as a gift & tells him to think of her whenever he plays with the horse. Michael hates nearly everyone in the world but he loves mommy & misses her more than life itself. Viewers can't help but feel a tad bit sorry for the tike in Zombie's reboot of the original & the sequel.

The film cuts to a dark yet colorful street where bloodied Laurie Strode is walking home. After being located by a police car, she is taken to a nearby hospital where she's treated & learns that her best friend Annie is still alive but in critical condition. After being told to vacate the ICU room & to return to her own room, Laurie realizes she is not strong enough to make it back down the hallway & calls for help. Quickly, our heroine realizes she's not alone & that Michael is in the hospital terrorizing the nurses. It's time to escape once again & the nightmare doesn't seem to be over. Not yet, at least.

Laurie wakes up screaming in her bed & realizes the hospital massacre was just a nasty dream, it's almost a year later after the events that took place in Haddonfield & Laurie is now living with Annie & her dad (played by the very underrated Brad Dourif) in the countryside. She's taking baby steps to rid herself of the traumatic experiences by visiting a shrink (Margot Kidder) who encourages her to face the demon & try to realize why these nightmares actually exist. Although Laurie would rather put all this out of her mind, she knows Halloween is just around the corner & dreaded memories are fairly easy to recall. What she doesn't realize is that family will be dropping in real soon.

H2 picks up right after Zombie's remake of the original took place & things are about to take a turn for the bloody worst if one can fathom such. Michael Myers' dead body was never found on that night of the Halloween massacre even though Laurie Strode tries to tell herself repeatedly that she killed the man in the mask. Sadly, Laurie can't seem to completely get on with her life & the recurring nightmares of that night. In fact, she even fears that homicidal tendencies may very well run in her blood although she still has no idea who her real family is. She's about to find out rather quickly who brother dearest is & that family is forever whether she likes it or not.

Dr. Loomis (played by magnificent Malcolm McDowell) on the other hand seems to be doing exceptionally well profiteering off the innocent lives of families who lost their loved ones by writing a novel which gives specifics to the origins of Michael Myers. Loomis even goes so far as to give details of Laurie's Strode's origins including her birth name & whereabouts as well. To further exploit the entire brutal massacre, his publishers insists on releasing the book on none other than Halloween. Fame & fortune seem to have smiled on our greedy Dr. Loomis & he's now a national celebrity to be seen everywhere including on a talk show with special guest Weird Al Yankovic.

Zombie obviously has a knack for creating some of the violent if not sickening images ever put on the mainstream circuit & we really should praise the man for actually getting away with it. There is a rather intense scene near the beginning of the film where two coroners discuss necrophilia before crashing head-on into a vehicle on the country road in what may very well be the most ugly car crash I've ever witnessed in a horror flick. One of the latter montages finds Myers crushing a man's face with his foot which could very be a homage to Gaspar Noe's scene in the notorious film Irreversible where a man's face is smashed with a fire extinguisher. In another graphic scene, Michael stabs a nurse repeatedly to a bloody pulp which could've very well earned the film a solid NC-17 rating. Even more sickening, our villain kills a dog on a prairie & proceeds to gutting the poor animal before eating it in gruesome detail. Thus, Zombie is one of the few directors who can envision some of the most mortifying imagery ever & still manage to find a home in your local multiplexes.

Above all else, Zombie has created some of the most unique if not artistic dream sequences I've seen in a long time which are unlike anything you will find in a typical slasher film. I can already hear the comparisons to Tim Burton (or even veterans like David Lynch come to mind) but I'd almost be willing to purchase this film on DVD for these sequences alone & I'd even be willing to bet many viewers would re-think their own judgment of Zombie if they were to check out these fantastic images. If Michael Myers has dreams like this, I'm truly envious. Kudos to Zombie!

In addition to making a film which should be cherished by slasher film aficionados everywhere worldwide, Zombie proves once again he can write some very intelligent dialog when he's not dropping the infamous f-bomb. (As with any film he makes, the language is extremely coarse & the dude clearly has no intention of mincing his words.) As with any sequel or reboot, try to watch this film for what it is instead of bashing it for not being an exact replica of the Carpenter classic. Personally,  I believe H2 could have very well been his opus had he just spent a bit more time with it although this is still one of the best horror offerings you are going to find & I would gladly take this any day over the unnecessary remakes we've seen all year long like Friday The 13Th for example. If Zombie isn't your thing, there's still plenty of crap-tastic PG-13 entertainment at your local cinema to make up for H2.",1309132800,4,6472,4.5286569717707446
3301004,1,B0011G6FDI,"The movie cover looks awesome, but really my friend was right. It was stupid! I wanted to see it for myself, and it was just stupid.
First off, Donald Pleasance would probably be dissapointed on how Rob Zombie reinvented Dr. Loomis. Instead of being concerned about finding Michael Myers and saving Laurie Strode, he's some guy who writes novels about how he's seen the evil in Michael Myers and is some greedy bastard that only cares about fame. Michael Myers mask is completely ruined, and the reason why Michael Myers is after Laurie Strode or excuse me ""Angie Myers"" so that they can be together with the mom or some stupid ridiculous crap. There is NOTHING original about the Halloween II remake. And she keeps having stupid dreams that don't make any sense at all, and of course Rob Zombie has to overdo EVERYTHING! He adds extra extra gore and unnecessary crap, honestly you really feel like turning the movie off, I wasted two hours of watching this. Seriously Halloween: Ressurection was waaaay better than this. People were saying that the old Michael Myers trilogy was going sour, and that they were running out of ideas, but Halloween H20 and Ressurection are far more better than putting a John Carpenter classic into the hands of Rob Zombie. I was thinking the same thing, it probably was gonna take place in the hospital, and it kinda does in the begining, but then it turns out to be some stupid nightmare, and is totally different, and isn't worth your time at all. They must have lost so much money remaking an actual classic that didn't need to be remade at all. The first Halloween remake was decent, but still not great. Coming from a die-hard Halloween fan who has a Michael Myers tattoo of the original mask, I'm seriously gonna tell you, Watch the original Halloween, Halloween II, Halloween 4, Halloween 5, Halloween: Curse of Michael Myers, Halloween: H20, and Halloween: Ressurection They're all great films, and don't need to explain why Michael Myers is the way he is, you just understand the concept as you go from film to film why he is the way he is. and make sure you get the ones that say ""A John Carpenter Film.""",1308700800,7,2147,4.667546174142481
3301005,1,B0011G6FDI,"I don't even know where to start......

First and foremost I am going to put this out there; I do not care for Rob Zombie. I never really cared for his music, not to say it is bad it just doesn't do anything for me.  So when I first heard he was going into the realm of cinema I wasn't too excited about it.  I totally detested ""House of a 1000 Corpses"", awful.  My friend suggested to me to watch his version of ""Halloween"" claiming that it was actually pretty good.  Being a fan of the old school ""Halloween"" flicks I figure I would give it a shot.  I must confess that I enjoyed aspects of ""Zombie's Halloween"" (mainly Malcolm McDowell version of Dr. Sam Loomis) but overall didn't care for it.  I figured I might as well watch the sequel, what a mistake.....

I will take back my original thoughts about Zombie's 2007 version of ""Halloween""; I appreciate it much more after I watch this schlock of a sequel.  In stead of providing text why this movie was awful I am going to note some key points.

* Don't know why Michael Myers was so pro-mask in the first film and in this sequel he would take it off quite a bit.

* Michael Myers looked like The Undertaker (the wrestler).

* Michael Myers eats a dog.

* I never thought I would get sick of seeing a white horse and a lady dressed in white. The lady in white is Michael's mom; the role is played poorly by Zombie's wife. I don't know who the horse is.

* Why waste 20 plus minutes on a no reason hospital dream?

* The character development of Dr. Sam Loomis wasn't believable as a money/media whore, given what had transpired in the previous film.  Then the last minute ""change of heart""?

* If a dollar could be given to repay the ""government bailout"" every time Laurie Strode cried, this country would be out of a recession.

* Speaking of Laurie Strode, Scout Taylor-Compton's acting was so horrible. Was she supposed to be a whiny Emo girl? I lost count how many times she used the F word and stated her life ""sucked"".

* Rob Zombie loves using the F word.

* The acting in this movie was truly poor.

* The over the top blood and guts was basically torture porn.  It is like Zombie is trying so hard to be ""dark"" and ""disturbing"" and it comes off comical. For instance, Michael Myers was going out of his way to kill people. Some of these moments I was laughing so hard it hurt.

* Every character was unlikeable; I truly didn't care what happened to anyone.  I am still questioning myself why I didn't turn the movie off.

* The entire supernatural/psyche aspect of Myers and Strode's relationship was totally out of left field.

* Does Margot Kidder know Rob Zombie?  Her two small scenes seemed really out of place.

* Did I mention the white horse and the lady dressed in white? Oh and Michael Myers eats a dog.

This movie didn't receive the praise as its predecessor and I can see why.  This movie at the end of the day was unnecessary; everything was really tied up in the first film.  This movie was nothing more that a pot boiler.  Recommended for a deflating your IQ or hard core Rob Zombie fan.",1308096000,22,3068,4.300174520069808

3301008,4,B0011G6FDI,"Though the film was met with a large majority of bad reviews I for one loved Zombie's sequel to his first re-telling of Halloween. A lot of the common staples of Michael Myers are removed. He talks (once), and we do get to see inside his psyche and see first hand what makes him tick. The look of Myers is great,coming across more like some twisted vision of a pagan frankenstein rather than a mysterious phantom. It seems as if the biggest problem with Halloween enthusiast when confronted with Zombie's re-imagining is that it indeed is a re-imagining and not a frame by frame remake of the original,when in fact dubiously copying the film (much like they did with the remake of A Nightmare on Elm Street) does more to insult and discredit the work put forth by the original cast and crew. No this film will not appease the hardcore halloween fans,but really,what would? At least Myers is not castrated by the pop culture in being kung fu kicked through a wall by Busta Ryhtmes this time around.

The first Halloween was a great movie and a refreshing take on a franchise that had seemed to run its course. This movie is just plain horrible, and not in a good way. Why is it that he has to throw his wife into everything he does now. Her part in the movie made no sense and seemed like it was written in so that she could be in this movie. Michael Meyers as a hobo? Come on this is a real stretch. After watching this movie I was actually upset that I had wasted all that time to watch it.

I love horror movies, Rob and I probably love many of the same movies. But, the injustice that he has done to a classic, TWICE, is no homage.

He also goes MUCH more in depth in the charecter lauri and truely shows just how messed up you would be after an incident like a mass murder took place in your life. The coolest part about this film and what made it such an instant classic for me definatly just had to be the scenes when michael was speaking with his mothers ghost. This just showed the true side of michael myers and raised the question in the end are we THAT much better than he is? He was just sacrificing for the ones he loved.

3301049,3,B0011G6FDI,"Two years after Michael Myers decimated Haddonfield, Laurie is no longer a good girl. The nightmares have taken their toll; she's drinking, partying, anything to forget. Dr. Loomis is coping in his own way; he's written a tell-all book about the Halloween massacre and is drinking up the media love. Only Michael is still Michael, doing what Michael does. Working his way across the countryside, killing everyone whose path he crosses, he's set on getting Laurie this time. And he has supernatural help: his mother has come back, dressed in white, riding a white horse, telling him he needs to put the family back together. And that means Laurie has to die.

Halloween II is not a faithful retelling of the original, as Zombie's Halloween was, but a completely new story under the same title. It's also a return to his grindhouse roots, with lurid sex and violence, garish colors, and far more graphic killing than in Halloween. The difference between his version of Halloween and this movie is jolting and problematic. It doesn't really work as a sequel, and would have been better made as a standalone movie, names and places changed to protect the first movie.

3301051,2,B0011G6FDI,"Well, to start things off, I was really looking foward to this movie. Considering that Zombie just ruined the whole point of remakes. I actually enjoyed the first Halloween remake, but this movie just tanked everything.

We see at the beginning of the movie. Michael as a child and his mom in Smith's Grove Sanitarium, where he was put after killing his sister. But he was given a white horse to reprsent his mom. But, about a minuet or so later, we see that Laurie is walking down the street absoltely covered in blood, and once Sheriff Brackett pulls over and ask's her what happeneed, she starts saying, ""I killed him,"" about four or five times. So of course, she is taken to a hospital, and so is Michael, but a crash along the way awakens him, and he kills the paramedic with a shard of glass. But, we see along the way, Laurie getting a imediate surgery, and put in a hospital bed. While finding the nurse, we see her walk out of a room and her chest is bloody, screaming and Laurie trying to run, we see Michael walk out of the room, and stab the nurse to death. Laurie, outisde, goes and hides in the gate keepers office type of thing, and he is killed with a random Ax that Michael has found, Michael knows that Laurie is in the small building because none of the windows are open, so busting down the wall, getting ready to kill her, Laurie wakes up from a serious nightmare.

We see the next day, a hooded Michael, and his mom's ghost, staring at a billboard of him as a child. So, the mission is confirmed by ""Mom"", and Michael sets out to find Laurie, killing people such as two trucker's and there daughter along the way, and a owner of a strip bar, his friend, and a stripper, which rips part of his mask off. But, while this is happening, Laurie start's to have horrific hallucinations, seeing Deborah, and a Clown-Faced Michael. Later in the movie, Laurie see's in a book with her friend's, that she is Angle Myers, Michael's long removed sister. Once she find's this out, getting drunk to forget about it, she and her friends Mya and Harley decide to go to a halloween party. But, before Harley is about to get boned by some random dude she met, he's killed by Michael while taking a wiz, and seconds later, Harley is choked to death. Going to the Brackett house, where Annie closes her drug cabnet and see's Michael's reflection. He chases her and stab's her repatedly and carves her, spewing blood everywhere. ""Angle"", and Mya come to Annie's aid when they find her, but she dies in Laurie's lap. Seconds later, you see Michael smashing the door to peices after killing Mya who was on the phone with paramedics. Laurie escapes the house, and pulls over a driver, who of course is killed a couple of seconds later. But michael takes Angle and takes her to a abandon shed. Where her imagination takes over her and a young Michael is holding her down, getting to say ""I love you mommy"". But then, Dr. Loomis comes into the shed, and is screaming and yelling at Laurie that nothing is holding her down. But, Deborah tell's Michael, ""Time to go home,"", and Michael stab's and carves Loomis.

Michael doesn't relize that he is in front of a window, and is shot in the arm. Once falling into the sharp equipment. Angle stab's him repeatedly and then takes his mask, and walks outside with it. The movie end's with Laurie being stranded in a all white psychiatric ward.

There were deleted scense that just ruined the movie. But, there was a alternate ending, when attacking Loomis, Michael unmask's and is shot to death, and Laurie comes out and has picked up Michael's knife, and then is shot to death.

So, overall this movie blow's, and just ruined the whole concept of Halloween. But, they are making a new Halloween movie which will not be directed by Zombie.

He stayed fairly true to Carpenter's original vision, while taking some liberties, exploring, and coming up with his own. Then the decision was made for him to finish his story. So he penned and helmed a SEQUEL. Rob Zombie has only remade one movie so far in his career, the aforementioned Halloween. This movie is his own thing. Sure it shares a title with a movie called Halloween II, but the reason people don't get it is because it is not a remake. These days, everything has to be a remake for people to understand it. I have been a huge Halloween fan for years, and to say this is the best one is simply not true. It is a good movie though. If you like originality and gritty b-movie style film making, then this is a must see... if you hold on to the notion of a remake, stay away from this because you won't understand. I wish more horror movies were done this way. And i love the fresh air Mr. Zombie has breathed into the series. My only hopes is they don't destroy it again whenever they get around to the once-rushed-now-sitting-on-the-shelf halloween 3D. hmm... A Michael Myers involved Halloween 3? that's going to make alot of people angry... because the original Halloween 3 didn't have myers. hmm... point proven. This is not a remake.

Rob Zombie needs to stick with coming up with his own ideas adn stay away from classic films espeically.  This film is a waste of anyhones time and money.  If you want to watch a good movie watch the originals, even though they are older they are still far better than this crap being shoved off on to the new generation as horror remake.",1289865600,4,605,4.4324324324324325

It continues on directly and straightforward from the first Halloween, and having PTSD myself... I think Zombie did his homework extremely well in researching exactly how trauma victims really and truly try to go on with their lives, react, and handle the aftermath after going through complete HELL and back.  I understood all the dialogue, what was going on psychologically within each of the characters, and sincerely felt Laurie's rage and agony.  It all made complete sense to me.  But once again... I have PTSD myself.  Those who don't know anything about mental illness--feel VERY BLESSED--and PRAY that you never have to know.  Michael is not ""The Boogey-Man"" anymore.  He's a real human being with real, uncontrollable rage burning inside of him... which to me is scarier than some ""masked monster.""  This should've already been expected after watching the original, as Zombie dwelved into Michael's psych from his childhood.  A very realistic and a much darker version than his original remake... but still a very good, in-depth, worthy sequel to his original, IMO.  To each their own, I always say!  Ignore what people say, too, Zombie, and keep doing your thing!!  ;)",1289088000,2,1268,5.072463768115942
3301059,4,B0011G6FDI,"I've always rooted for the underdog movies, movies that very few people like or are victims of popular misconceptions (RoboCop 2, Hudson Hawk, Waterworld). But never in my life have I known a film to be on the receiving end of so much anger and undeserved hate than Rob Zombie's Halloween II.

Zombie didn't want to do the movie. He'd killed off Michael and that was that. But the studio went ahead with a sequel regardless, and he figured that if a sequel was going to be made then he should be the one calling the shots instead of someone else who might deviate from his vision.

Many were furious over his desecration of John Carpenter's original. I wasn't. I thought it was entertaining...but pointless. Zombie (and the makers of all the original sequels) just didn't grasp the fact that the minimalism and purity of the 1978 movie is what made it stand out. Copious amounts of back-story did nothing but bore me to death.

But the 1981 Halloween II was hardly sacred ground. Though it took place on the same night as the first the series had already degenerated into pure drudgery and sank even further from there. Zombie's Halloween II pays homage with the first 10 minutes but goes off into a brand new tangent following his own imagination.

His huge liberties with the Michael Myers mythology and rules may have offended fans, but after 31 years of keeping him in the dark it was time to bring the brutal ugliness into the light. This is hardcore slasher material. Compared to this the 80s and 90s sequels are PG family films. Violence and death in real life are not pretty, cool to look at, or bloodless. I'm sick of slasher films that are so clean and sterilized that they make murder look hygienic and harmless. What kind of message is THAT sending out?

Zombie has delivered, without a doubt, the most visually striking Halloween film yet. I wasn't too impressed with his editing or cinematography style in the 2007 movie. Carpenter shot his film in anamorphic Panavision and stuck with the format ever since. But Zombie opted for ugly Super 35, which gave his film-making style a garish, MTV feel. This time around he shoots in grainy 16mm and keeps the camera right in front of the carnage, keeping it in our faces. He also grinds raw, emotional performances out of his cast, especially Scout Taylor-Compton and Brad Dourif.

The hate, the anger, the condemnation...it's all completely unjustified. None of the original sequels were this bold, daring or imaginative. When it comes to drawn out franchises (especially horror films) there are frequent complaints of ""same old, same old"". But as soon as a sequel that DOES break the mold comes across it's torn apart for being too different.

It's our inability to make up our minds over what we really want in movies that pushes studios into making so much inoffensive garbage. Honestly, if you're the kind of person who likes Twilight then you really have no business watching this film.

The Blu Ray features the 119-minute Director's Cut of the film which several added scenes and a completely different ending. It's a much stronger film than the theatrical cut (which was still good) and if you're going to buy Halloween II it's best to buy this version. The 1080p picture is framed at 1.85:1 and is very grainy, but since this is the way the film was intended to look you can't blame it for not looking like Pixar. The sound design is loud and aggressive and there is a decent amount of extras.",1288569600,5,3462,4.691927512355848
3301060,3,B0011G6FDI,"You know, I often ask myself why I keep watching ""re-imaginings"", as much as I typically don't like them. I guess it's that horror-fan philosophy that you have to watch a lot of crap for those rare diamonds that sometimes filter through. I am not a fan of remakes...but I do run across one occasionally that takes me down a new path or makes me think of old faves in a way that I didn't before...and I'm thankful for those bright spots.

Rob Zombie's ""Halloween 2"" took me down an unfamiliar path all right, but instead of finding new thoughts or wrinkles, I instead wound up lost and disappointed.

That said, I realize that there's a whole new generation of horror fans that DIDN'T grow up watching what I consider classics, and for that reason they see these ""imaginings"" with fresh eyes and minds grown in a different time...so I'm going to try to give my opinion of this film bearing those facts in mind, and be objective and honest.

No promises except for the honesty, though.

Trying to maintain my policy of staying spoiler-free, I can only say that I neither felt I knew (since these are time-honored roles) nor cared about any character in this film other than Annie Brackett, her father the sheriff, and the father of Lynda at a book-signing scene.  Everyone else depicted was rather loathsome, morally-decrepit, and just plain sickening.  Sure, there was the occasional 'voice-of-reason' amidst the entropic nihilism, but overall every person is a deplorable example of humanity, at least the way my old-fashioned senses like to think it is.

Be advised, the following COULD give some things away...impossible to review this without pointing some things out:

Would it have been wrong to have a real hero in this film?  Are the original concepts of Dr. Loomis and Laurie Strode so outdated as it's important for us to see them as respectively a greedy, morally-ambiguous opportunist or a prescription drug addled, foul-mouthed, semi-goth burnout?

Maybe so.  The possibility exists that I just don't get it.

I can understand the illustration of how her experiences might have royally screwed Laurie up psychologically...I can take that.  I can see the realism depicted in Loomis...but sometimes, I think what a lot of us like in a horror film is to see good actually standing up to evil...at least in the ""Halloween"" mythology.  I've read the theory that this whole film is merely a psychotic delusion of Laurie as she sits institutionalized after her experience...that would explain much, although this is never really clear...it would at least give us a reason as to how Michael took a magnum round to the face from a foot away and survived...but overall the depiction, whether this theory is true or not, is confusing on the screen.

Perhaps Zombie wants to show the world as full of amoral, misanthropic, low-life rednecks who can't see beyond the end of their noses, and have only the f-bomb and a short assortment of nouns in their vocabularies...maybe he is trying to get us to recognize this; that the real horror is US...but for me, give me SOME light in the darkness, even if it loses in the end.  For me to have found some merit in his original crack at the ""Halloween"" story, Rob has really left me scratching my head over this defeatist and hopeless flick.

As for the film itself, taking out the thematic elements, it was well done.  The cinematography was excellent, the imagery and editing was otherworldly and fearsome in it's presentation, and the acting, for the material they had to work with, was very good.  Brad Dourif was emotional and excellent, Malcolm MacDowell was his usual pristine self, and Danielle Harris was wonderful.  It was also good to see some old favorites on the screen again...Margot Kidder and Caroline Williams, albeit in small parts, as well as a plethora of familiar character actors.  The special effects were brutal and raw, and hat's off to the artists who created them.

I can't really say I didn't like the movie; it had all of the things that I've mentioned that to me make a good film; I guess since it treads so heavily on a mythos I'm a huge fan of, I'm just not willing to buy into the bleak view it reflects as to how times have changed.

Had this been a stand-alone, original film, I'm sure I would have thought more highly of it; but riding the coattails of what is horror-movie legend, this revisionist take just left me feeling depressed.

2.5 stars for the imagery and acting skill shown.",1287792000,2,4464,4.7525906735751295
3301061,1,B0011G6FDI,"I absolutely loved Zombie's remake of Halloween, it is one of my favorite movies. That being said I'm here to review halloween II, which was nothing at all like the first one.

1. Michael Meyers doesn't wear a mask for about 75% of the movie, and looks dirty and disgusting. Everyone in this movie was dirty, like characters in the other R Zombie films.

2. Dream sequences-about 50% of the movie is dream sequences and useless ones. Not only are there dream sequences, but then out of the blue they'll show Michael's mom and little michael just standing in a hallway.....what purpose that serves? Couldn't tell you. Also some of these weirdo sequences take place in a dirty carnival looking enviornment just like the other R Zombie films. The white horse made no sense as well.

3. Michael Meyers eats animals......a dog specifically. I've heard that in the original Halloween II, he did eat a dog as well, but it was more subtle. Also I hear he did eat a guy in the bathroom, which wouldn't surprise me, but I must have missed that part. (and i refuse to watch this movie again)

4. Laurie Strode-what to say about her? She was screaming so much in this movie before Michael even chased her down. All she did was scream obscenities the entire film, also she looked dirty and smelly as well. And she has turned into a whiny freak, granted if i went through what she did, i probably would be too, but wow. Just shows how much Zombie is changing the original characters.

5. They used a different child actor to play little Michael....why? It couldn't have been more that two years, i'm sure the kid from halloween wasn't that old yet, and he was much creepier than the cutie in this movie.

6. Sam Loomis is like a totally different character altogether. Arrogant, sarcastic, and cared about no one but himself. Completely unlikeable.

7. No plotline whatsoever, i realize its halloween and michael meyers comes back to kill on halloween. But all it is, is a bunch of scenes that were just thrown together that really make very little sense. The first 30 minutes was the best of the movie.

To summarize-This movie was def along the lines of Devil's Rejects 2 and House of 1000 Corpses, which by no means are bad movies. But all Zombie did was steal the name Halloween and paste it on this creation. If it was labeled something else, it may have actually been a pretty decent movie. But,it deviated so far from the Halloween concept, Everyone looked like a dirty disgusting carnival freak, weird scenes and dream sequences that didn't fit in anywhere, characters that do not fit in with the originals, and the movie was absolutely nothing close to the first masterpiece that R Zombie created. Couldn't wait for Michael to kill everyone and end the movie. The ending was somewhat interesting but not worth sitting through an hour and half of garbage.",1287705600,3,2849,4.650099403578529
3301062,2,B0011G6FDI,"Let me start by saying I loved the originals (first two).  I think they are the best horror movies ever made.  Now Rob's remake of the first Halloween was pretty good. Much, much different then the orignal but was still a good movie.  Rob made Myers more human and more savage.

Now to the remake of the second Halloween.  Well I truly do not know where to begin. Well let start with the good points.

1) The voilence- it is truly stepped up a notch here.  Not gore but the violence. It
  really seemed to fit this Myers.  He is no longer this
  boogieman type character but a sadistic brutal killer.

2) Myers - Though I still like the original better this one is still great.  He's
  different.  Most will either love him or hate him not to many in the
  middle.

3) Dreams - We got to see what was driving Myers, what was going on in his head.

Now what was bad

1)Dr. Loomis -  Man does this Loomis really suck.  I mean the original really  helped make the movies. With out him the movie would have weakened greatly.  This Loomis nearly destroy's the movie.

2) Dreams - I can't really go into this to much without giving some things up but lets just say there to many of them and they should have been limited to Myers.

All in all I would like to have given 2 1/2 stars.  I think it would not be out of the question to give it a 3 star but that would be stretching it.  If Rob would just have had a better Loomis this movie would have been soooo much better.",1287446400,,1464,4.106761565836299

And also from that the overall picture failed in conveying a particular engaging story. I completely disagree or and in fact have to say that those low level aesthetics and shooting on the fly is what makes this film such a rich experience and a strong standout from the heard of remakes that we keep seeing year to year. I feel that Zombie has a very firm grasp on the release of dread and a control of the character development while still moving the story along in broad strokes. Most telling is the pizza dinner scene where Sheriff Brackett , Laurie, and Annie try to share a normal and calm makeshift family dinner before Laurie erupts into an ill timed emotional outburst that just drips with the looming dread that just lurks around the corner. But mainly the first 20 or so minutes with Laurie evading a grizzly murder via a now bearded almost more human Michel Myers in a dreary grey hospital just pumps with anxious momentum that thrives on a less is more approach. I wasn't going in to this a Rob Zombie fan but I left with the enjoyment of experiencing a hyper stylish, cool, blood drenched slasher epic. Plus the soundtrack and dream sequences work pretty well.

3301081,1,B0011G6FDI,"This movie was a complete waste of time.  I wonder if its possible to sue Rob Zombie for the time wasted in watching this movie.  I am a huge fan of the original Halloween series (minus part three).  I also enjoyed Rob Zombie's first remake.  However, this was a futile effort in filmmaking.  Allow me to elaborate for a moment.

First of all, the picture quality stinks.  When viewing this dismal excuse of a movie you cannot even see the gory picture scenes.  Ok, I admit I am a little demented but the main reason to see a horror movie is actually see people being butchered by some maniacal psychopathic killer.  In this remake it is impossible to see the events of the death scenes because the producer failed to sufficiently light the scenes.

Secondly the acting was reminiscent of a William Shatner death scene.  Over the top and not at all believable.  It almost seemed as if they gathered a bunch of kids of the street and told them to act in a movie.  Were there no actual auditions? Or is it that the filmmakers have no eye for talent?

Finally the character development merely didn't exist.  We never got to know let alone relate to Lori Strode (the main female character).  The Dr. Loomis character was a joke.  In the original series Donald Pleasance portrayed him as the silent mentor type (or not so silent), with a passion for hunting down his arch nemesis.  His passion and fear in hunting down Michael Meyers was akin to that of Captain Ahab hunting his great white whale.  In this remake, Dr. Loomis is a bitter creation of a narcissistic society.  Whereas in the first series the Loomis character was a bastion of good, this new Loomis is almost as evil as Michael Meyers just in a different way.

Needless to say I only gave this movie a rating of one because there isn't a lower rating to give on Amazon.  Save your money and buy one of the following horror movies:  The original Halloween series, Nightmare on Elm Street, Friday the 13th, Hellraiser, or Camp Sleepaway.",1283817600,7,1994,4.53932584269663

  Laurie Strode (Scout Taylor-Compton) is walking down the street in shock after shooting Michael Myers. Sheriff Brackett (Brad Dourif) stops his car to comfort her. She is taken to the hospital and is in extreme pain and hysteria.
  The body of Michael Myers is put in a Coroner's vehicle. On the road, the vehicle stops suddenly as it hits a cow. Michael, alive, busts out of the back doors and kills the passenger.
  Michael quickly finds his sister in the hospital and terrorizes her again.
  Suddenly, Laurie wakes up and it is 2 years later (unrated version).  Her nightmares are getting worse as Halloween approaches. Laurie believes she killed Michael.  She is living with Sheriff Brackett and Annie (Danielle Harris) who has also survived her ordeal with Michael.
  Laurie visits her therapist (Margot Kidder).
  Dr. Sam Loomis (Malcolm McDowell) has also survived his terror of Michael, his former patient, and is now on tour doing seminars and book signings about his new book on Michael Myers. Not everyone is happy with his tell-all book.
  He believes Michael is dead as well, however his body was never found.
  We see that Michael is still alive and is on his way to Haddonfield.
  Laurie's dreams are becoming too gruesome and bothersome. She is schizophrenic and hallucinates.  She really has it out with her therapist.

It was really dark and ""gothy"", maybe he was going for that image, but the story wasn't there. The first movie was WAY better, the ORIGINAL Halloween 2 with Donald Pleasance was really great. This movie compared to that, makes this movie look.........well....not well written or directed. i love Malcolm McDowell, but his role in this movie was not good. Really dissapointing. Don't waste your money on this one, buy the original with Jamie lee Curtis you will like it much more than this one. It had potential.....but what a waste of time......",1283040000,3,660,4.798245614035087

3301096,2,B0011G6FDI,"Im not sure what path Rob Zombie went down with this movie, but it was not the right one.  The first Halloween he did was incredible and is now among one of my favorite horror movies in my top 5.  This sequal wasn't anything like it, all the way down to the different child actor playing the role of young Mike Myers.  I didn't understand why it seemed so important to portray his visions of his mother as some sort of white knight that he followed, it just seemed so unnecessary yet you could tell Rob Zombie did everything he could to introduce this into the film.

I really hope he doesnt continue making these Halloween films, or I at least hope he goes back to what made the first one so fantastic.  I was warned, I read the reviews and everyone told me the second was not as good.  However, Im a horror fan and I can usually find entertainment in any horror flick, just not this one.

If you havnt seen either of his Halloween remakes, just watch the first one and forget he released a sequal because it really detracts from entertainment of the first.",1282262400,3,1058,4.313131313131313

Halloween II may have not followed the traditional but I still thought it was a good flick. The ""unecessary gore"" was awesome. I'll admit it was a little strange, But shouldn't you expect that from a Rob Zombie film!?",1280966400,5,343,4.4603174603174605
3301098,3,B0011G6FDI,"The Amazonites have spoken and this movie got killed, lambasted by some as 'the worst Halloween movie', though there's no way it can approach the horror of the botched Curse or the Busta-Rhymes-was-the-best-part Resurrection.

I'm still not sure why this was given an August '09 release rather than...October/Halloween.  Presumably, they didn't want to run up against the latest Saw offering, and perhaps they sensed the buzz of Paranormal Activity.  Instead, they ran it against The Final Destination 3D, which still fared better.

Folks seem to love or hate the Rob Zombie Halloween excursions.  Say this about Zombie...he is a horror movie fan and he tries something more personal this time around.  Yes, we all know and (presumably) love the original Halloween II, where Michael Myers stalks Laurie in the eerily empty corridors of Haddonfield Memorial Hospital.  And yes, we all know that it was revealed that Laurie was, in fact, Michael's sister, a plot twist conceived by John Carpenter when he ran out of ideas.  So what should we expect when someone remakes 're-boots' or jump-starts a series and then remakes the sequel, too?

Yes, there are similar elements and plot points from earlier Halloween films, including the original Part II (the hospital, the sister angle, which we knew from the first Zombie installment, etc).  But this is not a remake of the original Part II.  Rob Zombie is going his own way with the blessing of the Akkad clan, and I think he does some interesting things story and plot-wise.  There are clearly some expressionistic nods to Italian horror directors (Bava, Argento), and there's a strong nod to the effects of post-traumatic stress disorder and general insanity after you've been chased by a knife-wielding lunatic.  The early scenes---again, picking up right after the events of the original---are well done, if unsettling.  There's the frenetic activity of the paramedics and authorities, the hospital atmosphere, the loving close-ups of emergency surgery and various injuries, and the spooky recurrence of The Moody Blues on TV.  There's a very nightmarish feel to everything and the looks and sounds are appropriately unsettling.  There's a focus on the trauma---the screaming! the terror!  The film is much more concerned with the idea that this Laurie Strode is losing her marbles, and is hardly the wholesome and pure Laurie of the previous series.  Zombie prefers some of the more disturbing elements of the material over the 'scary ones'...which in his world are nearly one and the same.  There is always the risk of wallowing in the downbeat versus showing that the filmmakers actually had any fun making this.  I think they did, but Halloween II definitely toes the line.

Like most horror flicks, this is not the sum of its parts, but I always give points for atmosphere and demented touches.  Actually, the weakest part of the film is the stalking and slasher action itself.  It is predictable, methodical, absolutely brutal, and dare I say...sometimes boring.  Michael stabs...and stabs...and stabs...and then stabs again...and again...and again.  We get it.  Am curious what they cut, because it's a hard R rating here.  No, Mr. Zombie does not ease up on the slasher gore, and we get at least one close-up of a knife in the head.

The better elements are the psychological angles (exploring...well, insanity), and the Loomis plotline.  This is not the same Loomis, tireless in his effort to stop evil on two feet, but rather a burnt out, cynical, media-obsessed sellout who may or may not have an ounce of altruism left in his shell.  Again, Malcolm MacDowell is excellent if underused this time.  There's also a bit of plot-timeline fudging toward the end during the 'final showdown'.

The movie is demented, and extremely violent and brutal...perhaps too much in that it distracts from the fresh or different elements that Zombie tries to infuse.  I still liked this better than most of the rent-a-hack horror output that comes along.  Give credit to a horror fan making horror films and trying something else.  Of course, you can't win in this genre.  You will be condemned if you make the same old movie (which people want to see) or you'll be condemned if you try something out of left field (because people want something fresh).  If you want the old Part II, go watch it, it's a different film.  But lordy, this is a heck of a lot better than the latter stages of the original Halloween series.

The DVD looks and sounds great.  I believe Zombie shot this on 16mm and converted it, so the images look grainier and darker...it's a very stark and appropriate look for this film.  The extras include a plethora of deleted scenes, most not essential but some interesting bits, plus the inevitable alternate ending.  Note that the ending here differs slightly from from what you saw in the theater (if you were such a fanatic), since this is the 'director's cut'.",1280102400,46,4925,4.970660146699267

There are cool parts in this film, good gore, the killings are very realistic but the plot is garbage and the ending is the worst I have seen in a long time.  I hope these remakes end now unless they can do better and they pick up making a sequal to resurrection which was also better than the Zombie directed Halloween films.

Zombie really had something going with his first attempt at breathing some much needed life into the franchise and putting his own spin on things.maybe he should have have just left it at that.all i know is he took several steps back with this misfire.for me,Halloween II (2009)is a 2/5",1280016000,,673,4.912280701754386

The dialogue is redundant and unintelligible.  You're left with wanting more plot.  A waste of time.  I was expecting more from Rob Zombie than something as dumb and blunt as this movie.  That's it.

Never ever in life have I came close to walking out of a movie, but between this & The Spirit my will power was tested. 1st what makes Michael Myers who he is IS THE MASK but for some reason the director didn't feel like he needed the mask. For most of the movie Michael is without the mask & jump suit (this time he wears a thousand hot a** jackets) & he grunts so much you start to think that at one point he's just going to flat out start talking. The kill's in this movie are way over the top to the point where you just start thinking to yourself are they serious. The sister he's after is 10x more annoying in this one than the last one, Dr. Loomis doesn't care about trying to stop Michael anymore he just cares about selling his book, for some reason there is a white horse that pop's up whenever the mom does & yeah he eats a dog...im so serious",1278720000,8,898,4.022346368715084
3301123,1,B0011G6FDI,"This is truly the worst film I've seen in many many years. A lot of people have a problem with Rob Zombie drastically changing the core story, and the characters personalities. Actually, I can live with that. A remake, in essence, should be a re-telling, with personal touches by the writer/director. After all, a shot for shot remake doesn't work, remember the god-awful Gus VanSant remake of Psycho??? Having said that, however, this movie just does not work. The Laurie Strode character is so annoying, you will pray for her death. I know I did. The Loomis character is now a media and money hungry parasite, who profits from the tragedy of the first movie. While detestable, this is at least a somewhat realistic possibility. The gore is extreme, to say the least. Personally, I found this the only aspect of the film worth watching. The visions???? The dreams????? I have no idea which is which, and what Zombie was trying to do. This is one big muddles mess of a movie. The biggest flaw, and I mean major flaw, is there is NOT ONE character who is sympathetic. You will not care one iota about any of these people. I rooted all the way for Michael Myers. I wanted him to kill every whining, obnnoxious, human being in this film. He almost did. I really don't know what to say about this movie. It just sucks. And Sheri Moon Zombie?? Gimme a freakin break. This skank couldn't act her way out of a paper bag. From the first moment I saw her in House Of 1000 Corpses, I hated her. There's a reason that the only movies she's in are her husbands. In closing, I would just give a word of advice to Rob Zombie. Go back to music and leave films for people with talent.",1278547200,16,1668,4.436482084690554

I mean you are all rating this movie like it is the most horrible movie you have ever seen, and it is not that bad at all. Obviously, Laurie is going to be very depressed and not the girl she was in the first, because she is severely tramatized and messed up because of all of this. So reviewers need to get over that right away. Dr. Loomis becomes a jerk, because he wants to make money off of others tragedies with his book. Who doesn't do that in Hollywood? As far as the kiiling scenes, they were nothing different than first. They had the same amout of severe gore and length as the first. Michael Myers was just as ruthless and frightening as the first doing nothing out of the ordinary from the first film. So all in all, not a bad movie at all.

This is exactly what we get, but for the Manson/metal/666 crowd.  Evidently, the director's lifestyle influence is showing just a tad too much in this one.  Honestly, I actually enjoyed the first somewhat, but this follow-up is more concerned about turning one of the most truly iconic slasher killers into a long-haired, unshavened biker on some ridiculous walk-about quest to find/kill his sister.  This movie should not carry the Halloween name -- it's strictly a ""Devil's Reject"" spin-off.

Speaking of which, it's been awhile since I've wanted the lead actress killed off.  Usually you sympathize with their plight pull for them to survive.  It's unheard of when you care more for the secondary characters like the sheriff and his daughter than you do the leads.  Unfortunately, in this era all it takes are whines, shrills and F-bombs with attitude to make the cut.

Honestly, watch the movie if you're looking for something more similiar to ""Devil's Reject"".  If you want to get your Halloween fix, save your money and time and watch the originals.",1275868800,7,1183,4.959390862944162

3301129,4,B0011G6FDI,"I finally watched Rob Zombie's HALLOWEEN 2, and I must say that I didn't see the total disaster I was expecting. I'd heard all the arguments about how awful it was, including Zombie's ""white trash"" take on the classic 80s sequel. I'd also heard about Scout Taylor-Compton doing a terrible job as Laurie Strode, and her ""foul mouth"", ""whining"", and ""hysterical"" performance. Well, Zombie's version is different, but hardly as bad as it was made out to be! Michael Myers (Tyler Mane)is still the unstoppable killing machine we remember. Yes, he does take off the mask, and he does sport a raggedy beard. So what? I'd read how he looked ""homeless"", like a ""hobo"" Michael. I expected a real clown! Instead, he's even fiercer than he was in RZ's first HALLOWEEN! People complained that he ""grunted"" when he killed his victims. Again, so what? Mane is imposing and terrifying here, especially when he dispatches those hillbillies on the farm! Oh my! The only complaint I can agree w/ is the heavy-handed use of the horse imagery.

3301141,1,B0011G6FDI,"I was an extra in this movie, and even on the set I knew it was going to be a disaster....what I was unprepared for was the level of disaster that they took it to.

I have no problem with language or violence, but I do have a problem with it when there is no good reason. The script sounds like it was written by a middle schooler (honestly, who uses THAT many F bombs in regular conversation?). And the violence, while somewhat expected, went WAY over the top as far as simply telling the story. On the plus side, whoever did the makeup effects for this movie has one heck of a demo reel to show off now.

I'll agree that casting Maclolm McDowell as Dr. Loomis was a good move...it would have been even better if they had made him even remotely likable. Same goes for virtually any of the characters in H2.

Oh, memo to those who griped about Michael grunting....he grunted in Carpenter's original as well...just check out the scene where he strangles Lynda, or when he's breaking into the closet, or choking Laurie.

And of course they had to go the whole ""oh-my-God-she's-his-SISTER!"" route, which was stupid in the first HALLOWEEN 2 and is even more so this time around. John Carpenter came up with the idea in 1981 and even he admits it was a dumb one. Michael Myers is far more terrifying as simply the ""boogeyman"".....anybody could be his victim, nobody is safe. With this lame subplot, as long as you aren't related to him or between him and a relative, you're safe! Maybe it's nostalgia for the ""good old days"", but I think I'll avoid any of Mr. Zombie's future HALLOWEEN efforts and simply stick with Carpenter's classic....the unequaled original.....",1272672000,12,1661,4.563758389261745

Being a true fan of what I call ""the trifecta of classic horror movie villians"" which of course means Freddy Krugar, Jason Voorhees, and Michael Myers, I was amazed at how well Rob Zombie remade the first Halloween movie. It showed Michael become the evil being that we all know and love. It gave us a new look into his past which was previously only partially revealed. Most of all it stuck close enough to the original Halloween while making subtle changes to delight old fans and enlighten new ones at the same time. Bravo Rob Zombie! Bravo!

Now..........Halloween 2. WHAT THE F&%$ HAPPENED? I swear Rob Zombie must have been asleep in the chair through most of this. It starts out just like the original Halloween 2. Laurie is in the hospital after being attacked and Michael comes for her leaving a bloody mess of bodies in the process. Beautiful. As im watching Im thanking god that Rob Zombie is remaking this classic. Then BAM! 30 minutes into the movie Laurie wakes up and whats this? It was all a dream? NOOOOOOOO! Then you get to sit through the next 90 minutes watching as Michael Myers keeps seeing visions of white horses and his dead mother? They take a killer with no motive and turn him into a mamas boy on an acid trip? I swear I will kick Rob Zombie in the nuts if I ever see him for ruining what should have been such an easy remake. I saw this in the theater when it first came out and about an hour into the movie I wanted to walk out. The only thing that kept me there was the hope that it would eventually get better. It never did. In fact.......the last scene is so stupid and juvenile you wonder if your even still watching a Halloween movie. DONT YOU EVER MAKE ANOTHER MOVIE AS LONG AS YOU LIVE ROB ZOMBIE!

The scene at the Dance/Concert was pretty good, but it was the only thing that felt reminiscent of the older films. If he's trying to be gritty a groundbreaking... do it with your own characters! Don't ruin a classic beloved horror series, to make yourself feel all accomplished creatively!!! I was really let down by this. I'd even rather watch the one with Tyra Banks in it, than this mess! If the studios decide to go forward with new entries (wich I hope they do, because Zombie should NOT have the last word on this franchise!!!)

I really like the way Rob Zombie made the characters change from the first Halloween remake to this movie. Rob Zombie really opened up the dark side of Laurie Strode because it's a more realistic movie and I have to give Scout Taylor Compton some props for playing the part so well. I also have to congradulate Dr. Loomis played by Malcolm McDowell and sheriff Brackett played by Brad Douraf they both did an amazing job with there characters.

I own both Versions the R Rated and Unrated, yes there is a big difference between both versions. This is a different movie and it shows one that Michael is a Human being not some soul less thing walking about that is immortal. (SPOILER) The only complaint I had was watching the beautiful Danielle Harris in a bloody mess and felt her character didn't need to be killed off . If u want to see a more in depth depressing yet more understanding version see the unrated, if you want a more typical version watch the r rated. Both are great, great acting and directing anyone who knocks this film dosent appreciate good film making. I prefer the R rated because the unrated is way too depressing however the unrated lets the viewer understand a lot more about these characters.

loved the ending though - think taylor scout did a great job!

I didn't mind the fact that he grunts when he kills people and that he sometimes doesn't have his mask on (which other reviewers commented on). After reading all the negative reviews I thought it would be rubbish but I was pleasantly surprised. With the grunting and the dream sequences and the apparations of young Michael and his mum Rob has tried to change the formula a bit which after this many installments was necessary.
I did however find Laurie a tad annoying making her hard to care about and it would have been better if they got the kid who played young Michael back in it. The most glaring fault with the movie is that its supposed to be set one year after the first therefore 1981, so why did Dr Loomis have a LCD TV in his hotel room and why were they talking about Mike Myers of Austin Powers fame? Maybe Rob forgot and thought it was 2009.

This movie takes itself TOO seriously and is a little too deep for a slasher flick.
It bounced around and made the mistake the previous sequels made by having useless character(ghost mom/ ghost younger Michael) constantly show up.
What made the first two(originals) successful was the suspenseful build up and climactic battles in the end.
This jumped all over the place, too many random scenes and no one to cheer on to fight Michael.
I didn't have much faith in this one.
My personal thoughts are that Michael truly died in the first ""Halloween II"" which is a MUCH more superior slasher than this garbage.
Rob Zombie needs to go back to making music videos. Leave the slasher flicks to the professionals.

Rob Zombie was attempting to get the girl over as insane but the character ending up being very annoying with the repetitive screaming scenes. Her screaming was just way over done. I CAN STILL HEAR HER SCREAMING!!! The effects are great and it's a decent story.

Zombie needs to release a 3-Disc Halloween II set with the movie on one disc.

3301185,2,B0011G6FDI,"I find that as a filmmaker Rob Zombie has been struggling to find his voice.  House of 1000 Corpses marked his transition from a music video director to a narrative storyteller and suffered from lack of story and an over abundance of random imagery thrown in for shock value.

Devil's Rejects was a much more clearly defined narrative effort that borrowed heavily from his favorite movies.  Basically, he was now retelling someone else's story while developing through his own eyes.  Though a tad too brutal for my liking.

I think that he was put in a tough spot on Halloween.  Let's be honest: there was no way he could win this one.  It seemed to me that he had nailed his visual style and his work with actors had definitely improved, but now he had to contend with an existing mythos that dictate his story.  I wonder what this would have been like had he not been compelled to show the origin of the mask and whatnot.  This movie almost worked for me; it just felt like he was still holding back or being forced to color in between the lines a bit too much.

Here there be spoilers.

That being said, I really want to like Halloween II, if at least for some of the risks it takes.  I love the idea of Laurie dealing with the trauma and I thought that the writing and performance of her character were spot on.  This seriously could have been a movie about her life after the massacre without Meyers ever returning and I would have like it.  The same goes for Dr. Loomis.  I love the direction his character goes in-- except he doesn't really have a character arc or any reason for being in this movie.  The scene with Weird Al is genius.  But none of this really matters.  I even like crazy homeless guy Micheal.  What I didn't like what the stupid white horse/ghost mom hallucinations that follow him around.  That alone killed this movie for me.  Why can't he just be a psychotic killer?

The problem with the sequel is the same problem that affects 99% of all sequels.  Instead of following the story to where it would logically want to go, sequels are forced to bring back all the main players to basically relive the events of the first film.  There's no room for character growth.  There's no room for them to exist outside of what happened in the first film.  The possibilities for a sequel are endless, but often overlooked.  How would this play out if Michael were at-large and killing in other towns but never returned to Haddonfield?  How would that affect Laurie?  or Dr. Loomis?  I don't know, I'm probably the only person who would want to see a movie like that, but my point is that Zombie got SO CLOSE to telling an interesting story all his own and then caved during the last half and let it devolve into the same crap that we always see.  Better luck next time.

There is no way that the director's cut could be anything but the boring garbage that film is, unless they put a completely
different dvd in the box.
It was dull, boring, coma-inducing... I could go on.  What was the point of this film?  Watching Michael Myers wander around,
occasionally killing someone in cut-away scenes so dark, I couldn't figure out how they died.  Hey, maybe THEY watched this film, too.
At any rate, its Halloween. and Michael is killing a fresh young cast of amazingly horrible actors.  (I'm leaving the veteran
cast alone.  They looked like they'd been tortued enough.)  That's all there is to it.  I don't think they had a budget for subplots and symbolism.
I don't know what else to say.  They released this film twice into theaters.  It was the wrong way to recycle the celluloid.  My condolences to those 10 people who shelled out their hard-earned money and leisure time.",1266537600,4,1018,4.721590909090909
3301200,4,B0011G6FDI,"I was immediately open to Rob Zombie's Halloween and generally liked it basically because it was different. It wasn't a shot-for-shot remake, but it was also a bit messy. The first half was certainly very good; Zombie's chronicling of Michael Myers' life stuck in institution was well explored ground and written very well, but then the second half feels like a push-pull between something like Gus Van Sant's shot-for-shot remake of Psycho to Zombie's interpretation of the original material, which is where the first film fell a bit flat. However, with the ""Unrated Director's Cut"" of Halloween II, Zombie goes in a different direction yet again, and it feels like Zombie's finally made Halloween his own.

It's been two years since the psychotic events of October 31st in Haddonfield, Illinois, and Laurie Strode is a mess. She's living with Annie Brackett, who used to be her best friend, but animosity has grown since the Halloween incident. She's having bizarre visions and a revelation in the new tell-all book by Samuel Loomis catapults her into events that will finally bring a close to the Michael Myers' rampage.

From the get-go, this isn't your typical horror film. It doesn't even seem like a horror film. Sure, there are deaths, stabbings, and freaky visions, but it plays out more like a drama that used horror as its basis. It's one of the smartest moves ever made in a horror sequel. Rob Zombie is the thinking horror fan's director, he won't do a retreading of material, he won't rehash ideas, he'll keep going in different directions, and I never cease being interested in what he has to say within his films.

Scout-Taylor Compton provides a fantastic performance as Laurie Strode and really makes Strode her own; the scenes involving Strode and Margot Kidder's psychiatrist are of a particular note, showing Strode spiralling out of control and Kidder's psychiatrist trying to work out how to help this poor girl.

Strode is having psychotic visions, and it is one of these visions that is probably my favourite parts of the film involving lots of profanity, almost silent movie-esque looks and a glass coffin which works very well, it's a scene that has a great impact and is visually pleasing, despite the amount of profanity being thrown at the camera.

Of particular positive notes is the inclusion of home video footage of Danielle Harris as a young Annie Brackett. The Halloween fan will know Harris played Jamie Lloyd, the niece of Michael Myers and daughter of Laurie Strode in Halloween 4: The Return of Michael Myers and Halloween 5: The Revenge of Michael Myers, and there is a poignancy of showing this footage with Harris' history in Haddonfield. It's quite moving actually, which leads me to Brad Dourif.

In the first film, Brad Dourif played Annie's father, Sheriff Brackett, and it wasn't terribly memorable. It was cool as Dourif is the voice of another horror icon, Chucky the Good Guy Doll from the Child's Play films, but other than that, there wasn't anything stand-out about him in Zombie's Halloween. He completely breaks out in Halloween II, showing a father falling to pieces, and bringing such a reality to his character and such sympathy, making Brackett my favourite character in Halloween II, and is probably the best performance Dourif has ever given on screen. It's positively fantastic, and words can't describe how amazing his performance is...you need to see it.

The Blu-Ray disc provides a great picture and sound, loud and threatening, just the way I like it. The image has changed from the cinemascope 2:35:1 of the first film to a normal widescreen image that helps bring across the raw energy the film oozes out of every grainy pore it owns. It's a faithful representation and helps communicate the raw energy of the film well.

Deleted and alternate scenes are included which aren't much to write home to mum about, they provide interesting but unnecessary alternative takes of different scenes. What would have been better is the inclusion of the theatrical cut. Audition footage is provided of some newcomers. While interesting to watch, is there a need for it? Do Rob Zombie/Halloween fans demand audition footage of as-yet-unknown actors? Of note is Chase Vanek, replacing Daeg Faerch as Young Michael Myers due to a growth spurt. Vanek provides a good substitute but didn't seem as gloomy as Faerch was. Make-up test footage is also included, which, too, is interesting, but hardly necessary. A blooper reel is included which probably made me smile once or twice.

There is a fictitious band made for this film named Captain Clegg and the Night Creatures, and about nine minutes of music video is provided, intercutting black-and-white typical ""music video shoot"" footage with the scene in the film with sprinklings of old horror films and cartoons. They're all the same and not my cup of tea.

Unce Seymour Coffin's Stand Up Routines. This guy is also in the club scenes and isn't funny, but does some jokes that may make you smile, but providing unused footage of unfunny stand-up routines for entertainment is redundant. I didn't even make it past one minute of it. The whole joke in the film is that this guy is funny because he isn't funny. Providing 5-10 minutes of unfunny material will keep hitting the nail on the head but eventually bore the hammer into the skull and then eventually into the brain matter, providing a painful experience. My thoughts go out to all who watch this in its entirety.

Finally is the audio commentary from Rob Zombie. Zombie is always great to listen to; he's intelligible and explains certain ideas, cuts, and things become even more clear. He's a great guy and while he does fall into the audio-commentary no-no of describing what is on-screen, he balances that out by explaining the ideas behind the scene or a story behind the scene, which is alright. He's insightful company and worth checking out for Zombie fans.

The disc is highly recommended for Zombie fans and for fans of horror in general. This isn't your typical horror film, not is it your typical Halloween film. But I liked that; it's refreshing and visually outstanding and has some fantastic ideas. I challenge all who saw the theatrical cut and hated it to watch this fantastic, albeit somewhat slow director's cut, and try not to change their minds.

The inclusion of the theatrical cut would have made for some nice analyses, and the inclusion of Captain Clegg music videos and Seymour Coffins' stand up routines are unnecessary waste of precious data space. A faithful reproduction of the image and audio provides the film with a great visceral experience. I could have loved it more, but I loved it more than I expected to.",1266451200,6,6705,4.9073256840247135

This movie was nothing but slaughtering and killing someone a hundred times over...stabbing too much and crushing bones....and gallons of blood galore. 8- Why the hell would Laurie Strode have a Manson poster in her room....it just doesn't fit after all she went through in the past and she is supposed to be a shy and innocent young lady. 9- Rob Zombie...you don't have to put your wife in every single movie you make! ......I could go on forever but enough already.

XFL, meant to improve on the traditional NFL. Like Vince, Zombie falls flat on his face!

What a total waste of effort(??)! Forget the obviously lame storyline! Zombie has taken the BEST parts of what I & others loved of John Carpenter's masterpiece and has profoundly spat on them, transforming & transposing them away from what made them appealing- Laurie Strode from a straight-lanced, innocently appealing & ultimately doomed heroine who we ended up rooting for to a foul-mouthed, UN-likeable blithering mess. Sam Loomis has been remade from a truly concerned savior, determined to stop his quarry (while being believably terrified of him at the same time)from spreading death & destruction into a greedy, uncaring opportunist. And what a howler THIS Michael Myers is......! Where-as he was a terrifying, shadowy form of living darkness in total control of his actions without expression or remorse in the original, Zombie's version is laughably inept, just another thuggish brute without the cunning or resilience of a true screen villian, led only by his childhood/""inner-self"" visions/images to explain his actions (oh, so T-H-A-T's why he does & is what he is!!!!! I d-i-d-n-'t k-n-o-w THAT!). I'm not sure how much effort was made by Tyler Mane to ""get into character"" but you never really truly believe he's Michael Myers, or at least I didn't. Dick Warlock ('the Shape' in 1981's H2) was more convincing, emerging out of a dark corner with the occasional creepy head tilt while remaining stoic was all that was really needed.

The way I see it, the only real excuse for these re-makes (or are they re-boots???)is a set-up for a future ""Michael vs Jason"" clash!",1266105600,29,1909,5.018927444794953

3301205,1,B0011G6FDI,"When I first heard Rob Zombie was going to direct horror movies, I was intrigued as he stated he was a big fan of 70's and 80's horror films as I am as well. I was hoping that maybe he would bring something creative and fresh to a genre of horror that has pretty much been killed by a lack of new ideas and its own cliches.

Zombies first two films, House of 1000 Corpses and the Devils Rejects weren't exactly good, but they were sorta fun in a there really isn't anything better on TV at the moment sort of way, but neither hinted at a director with a lot of potential. Then Zombie remade Halloween, a somewhat impossible task as there is no way a remake could ever surpass Carpenter's classic. Not surpringly, Halloween was fairly bad. Not terrible, but still, kind of bad. The main problem is that it didn't really add anything new other than trying to explain why Mike Myers became Mike Myers. Today's horror directors seem to think that the key to a remake is to explain why the killer became a killer and Zombie is no exception. But what is lost on these directors is that the lack of explanation is what makes a killer like Michael Myers truly scary. Why did he kill his sister and grow up to be a crazed killer in the original Halloween? Who knows, but the simple answer is that, as one of the little kids in the original stated, he is the boogie man.

So here we are with Halloween 2. I was interested in seeing this as the trailer looked pretty good and I heard that Zombie was not remaking Halloween 2 and therefore this would be his ""vision."" Well, there is no doubt about it now. Zombie has absolutely no vision and no idea how to direct a horror movie. This movie is utter, utter trash. There are no redeeming characters and absolutely no scares. Myers is basically played as a really pissed off redneck. He is much more leatherface than..well, Mike Myers. either way, it's amazing this was not a direct to video release. It is that bad. Avoid at all costs",1266019200,6,1971,4.338753387533876

It also brings back in some elements that were mostly missing from the 2007 remake but were dominant in the original series, including edging Michael Myers back in the direction of being something more than a warped psychopath, something inhuman: it's doubtful, for example, that any mortal human could have survived the ending of the previous movie, let alone come back for more.  There are other glimmers of elements which may or may not be supernatural.  In contrast to these emerging elements, there's a gritty, uncomfortable raw-ness to both the movie and the character that were never present in the earlier entries.  Whereas the original Michael Myers was so utterly unhuman and almost otherworldy - it was part of the ongoing subtext that Michael was really a physical incarnation of the 'boogeyman' - that his longtime psychiatrist Dr. Loomis refered to Michael as 'it' rather than 'he'; the Michael Myers in the current movies is, despite his preternatural strength and resistance to physical injury, at times all too human.  As in the 2007 movie, the question of whether Michael is twisted and insane or just raw evil is answered: he's both.  It's obvious the character's mind is warped, but it's just as obvious that not all the brutality, aggression and sadism of the character can be attributed to a damaged psyche: it's the real Michael.

  We see the world through Michael Myers's eyes in certain scenes - where his dead mother is still present and directing his actions, where Michael's younger self is there and interacts with the older version, and where there's frequently the strange appearance of a white horse, which is said in psychological terms to represent vast amounts of inner rage when seen in a dream or vision.

  Halloween II brings back almost all of the signifigant surviving characters from Halloween 2007 (and some of the dead ones, through visions and flashbacks), which is a welcome factor.  Most of the characters have changed signifigantly in the wake of that movie's events.  Among the most striking changes are those in Laurie Strode (Scout Taylor-Compton), who's psychologically disturbed and whose character continues to darken in her own inner rage as the movie progreses.  Anyone who saw the 2007 movie or is at all familiar with the Halloween mythos knows that Laurie is really Michael Myers's younger sister, and anyone who saw the movies in the original series (especially Parts 4-6) knows that the idea that there might be something 'wrong' not only with Michael but with other members of his bloodline was an evolving plot thread.

  One thing that I found occuring in Halloween II that's occasionally been trotted out in other movies but has Never worked so well as it has here, is the recurring sensation that much of what we're seeing on screen may not be real, but happening in one of the character's heads.  That's usually annoying; here it's frightening.  The idea that it may not be 'real' but may actually be happening simultaneously in More than one of the character's heads is just plain eerie.

  There are other unique factors at work too: it's rare that a movie, including a horror movie, can have so much brutal, gory violence on-screen and yet still leave the door open that there's much Worse happening offscreen.  Unsettling.  Another rarity to movies in general, although director Rob Zombie tends to work this into his own films on a regular basis: the movie will start off seeming to take place in such a nihilistic, ugly world, populated predominantly by unlikable, totally amoral characters.  But then as it progresses, you meet other much more sympathetic characters, or you find yourself warming up to some of the originally unlikable ones (one of the returning characters has changed for the worse, but you find yourself starting to find more redeeming values in him as it goes along).  An example of this dichotomy: in the opening of the movie, an ambulance carrying away the bodies of victims from the first movie has its driver and attendant discussing how much they'd like to have sex with the corpse of one of the female victims.  From the rather nasty, unpleasant tone this little moment sets, you'd never expect elements to crop in like the 'adoption' of Laurie by Sheriff Brackett (Brad Dourif)'s family or the way they continue to try and help her even as she grows more abusive as her personality darkens.  The ties of loyalty and extended family between the survivors are handled with great effect and even tenderness.  Even Laurie, even as she's darkening, has those feelings: she doesn't want to be growing increasingly aggressive, but is losing control of herself.  The way you get to know the characters makes the fates that befall some of them hit like sledgehammers.

  All this talk of the emotional ties and loyalties between characters doesn't mean that this is a tv drama-of-the-week treatment of Halloween.  It's a dark (the darkest in the series), psychologically disturbing, relentless horror movie.  The thing that so many of horror's detractors (who usually don't seem to have actually watched that many of its movies) fail to get is that being a vicious horror movie doesn't preclude any other elements from also being part of the package.

  Halloween II won't sit well with all fans.  It's less of an 'awesome, fun horror thrill ride' than many entries in the slasher-type field; its horrendously brutal, coarse, and disturbs on a very emotional level.  That said, it's just as great as the other kinds of slashers, just in a very different way.  One thing that can inarguably said for the Halloween remakes at this point: they're not just repeating what the original series did so well.  They're really forging their own identity, and it's a very dark, ruthless identity.

  Killer ending to boot, setting the potential for the next chapter to develop and differentiate itself even further.",1265846400,3,6480,5.163793103448276
3301208,3,B0011G6FDI,"I am a big fan of the Halloween franchise. I even like some of the weaker installments. I like Rob Zombie's films. I just do not like them together.

This movie has some interesting ideas, and I would have liked it more if it was not affiliated with Halloween. Rob has taken characters which are dear in our hearts, and made them unlikable. I think at this point Rob Zombie has a nice following. He should make movies with his own titles, and characters. This would leave an open mind with the viewer. Otherwise you face the wrath of the fans.

My number one complaint with Robs' Halloween movies is, why is Michael Myers seven feet tall, and have super strength. The allure of the original was that Michael was a normal guy. How come you didn't make his sisters seven feet tall? See what I mean. If these movies had just been made under a different label, there would be no wineing.",1265846400,,883,4.411042944785276

After the black woman in the hospital was stabbed repeatedly & Michael Myers left the knife buried in her head, I realized watching that scene actually depressed me.  I think most people who feel human feelings would feel depressed after watching that.  I've seen hundreds of horror movies, this is one of the only ones I had to turn off.  I don't mean that as a compliment.  I had to turn it off because I felt like less of a human being watching it.  No movie is worth that.",1265760000,6,545,4.1826923076923075
3301220,4,B0011G6FDI,"I'm a fan of the Halloween movies. But unfortunately, the last movie I had left the theatres really satisfyed with was Halloween:H20, back in '98. I still think the series should have stopped there, with Jamie Lee Curtis killing Michael.

But they decided to continue. And they made a huge mistake called Halloween: Resurrection. So, the only way to go ""on"" would be to reboot.

And there came Zombie. Now, I like him as a director. He'd done the amazing The Devil's Rejects. I thought Halloween could, maybe, use some of the brutality Rob would surely bring to it. After all, the Michael in Resurrection could not scare a 7-year-old in the dark.

Zombie did a good job with the movie, but there was something off about it. It was like seeing Halloween (78) being violated somehow. I can't help but feel that way. The movie was different, but close enough to the original to make me uncomfortable.

Now H2 is another story. Rob's taken his vision to the next level and we've been offered a whole new interpretation of the story.

I think the overuse of profanity may make everybody a bit uncomfortable (and maybe takes some people off the movie), but, you go past it, and you have a very good story of people dealing with a post-traumatic experience and also, with one another, in the background.

I think this is actually one of the Halloween movies that really invested on characters, and it is heartbreaking to see what they go through.

Michael is more vicious than I have ever seen. he's brutal. merciless. in a word, scary. And it felt great to feel that way.

The end is... interesting. If this is the end of the Halloween movies with these characters in this world, it's fine. Makes us wonder what could happen next. If it's not, I wonder where the story would go... and if Michael would be involved somehow. Is Halloween without MM Halloween?

The last Halloween III (in the eighties) tried and failed. Could the new one succeed? Only time will tell. But I have hope. Halloween II gave it to me.",1265760000,7,2004,4.591036414565826
3301221,2,B0011G6FDI,"I've been a huge fan of the Halloween series of movies since I was a kid.  And Rob Zombie's interpretation of the first Halloween movie thrilled me, as it delved into the history of Michael Myers that the original didn't.  After seeing Rob's first Halloween, I was very eagerly anticipating this second one, since Halloween II was my favorite of the original Halloween series.  However, this one seemed to miss the mark with me.  It wasn't a BAD movie.  It just didn't expand on the original like the first one did.  Rob's Halloween II seemed more centered on the violence aspect and was closer to a ""Torture Porn"" genre than a true ""Slasher"".  Also, there was a lot of just plain weird stuff in it that made it hard to follow.

Overall, as a big fan of the Halloween series, this was worth watching.  If for no other reason, just to see someone else's take on the movie.  But, next time I sit down to watch Halloween II, it will be the original.",1265500800,,946,4.416184971098266
3301222,1,B0011G6FDI,"Let me get this out of the way so that there is no mistaking what direction this review is going:

JOHN CARPENTER'S HALLOWEEN II IS MILES...NO MAKE THAT LIGHT YEARS AHEAD OF THIS REMAKE....NO QUESTION ABOUT IT!

And the reason I can get away with saying this so easily is that being a collector of horror movies and having the complete set of every Michael Myers Halloween and even the one Non-Michael Myers Halloween movie ever made, I can tell you that this second Rob Zombie remake blows monkey chunks so bad, that just when I thought it was impossible to watch, a watchable part came strolling by the screen....and even THAT isn't saying too much but first, a back story to why this remake is not plausible.

In the original Halloweens, Michael was an unstoppable force, a demon possessed and we all understood this and accepted it as such so naturally when he was shot at by police or whacked over the head or gutted with a knife, he could never be killed and he came back film after film after film until finally in ""Halloween ""Resurrection"", Laurie is killed and Michael is believed to be killed also and unfortunately shortly after that movie was finished, the producer of these movies, Moustapha Akkad, was killed in a suicide bombing and for all intents and purposes, that was the end of the original Michael Myers Halloween Movies because Moustapha said that the only way he would stop making them was if he were dead.

The reason why Carpenter was able to get away with bringing Michael back was because of the possession story I explained earlier that Michael was cast in.....

****SPOILER ALERT****IF YOU HAVEN'T SEEN THE FIRST ROB ZOMBIE HALLOWEEN MOVIE, STOP HERE!****SPOILER ALERT****
In Zombie's first Halloween movie, no such demonic possession existed, Michael was portrayed as a child who grew up in a really twisted and dysfunctional household and who himself was bullied at school and one day just snapped and went ballistic on the bully at school and killed him, and killed his scumbag father and was incarcerated and then his twisted mother who was a stripper (more on this later) blows her brains out and then he grows up to be this huge M****RF****R who breaks out of Smiths Grove (just like in the first movie), returns to Haddonfield and starts killing people, now this is all well and good until the end of the movie when Laurie, his sister, shoots him in the head and kills him.

Now, I don't know if you're following me here but if you're not a person possessed by a demonic soul, when you get shot in the head by a gun the size of the one Laurie used at the range she was at?, YOU'RE DEAD!.....This is the first reason why this movie is so stupid...Yeah Yeah, I know it's Hollywood and they can do things like that, I get that but if you're going to make a sequel to a movie like this, at least make it look half way plausible so you're not insulting the audiences intelligence.

I thought the first Rob Zombie film was the better of the two, far better, way better, I'm glad I just rented this film because it's a piece of crap, I don't know why he bother schmutzing it up with his wife in it through out the movie playing a ghost, I mean seriously, the scenes with her could have been substituted with some kill scenes instead because this movie was sadly lacking a body count.....there were more bodies in the Original Halloween II (the music was better also).

There are GOOD things about this movie if you can believe it, Brad Dourif was terrific as Sheriff Brackett, Malcom McDowell, with all due respect to his acting ability was okay as Dr. Loomis but could never replace the late great Donald Pleasance. I really thought Danielle Harris was great in these Zombie flicks, she played the part of Annie very well. Newcomers who do NOT know who Danielle Harris is, she played Laurie Strode's daughter in Halloween IV: The return of Michael Myers and Halloween 5: The revenge of Michael Myers but for some reason was quickly removed from the cast in any future movies after that until these two remakes.

If you must see this movie, RENT IT, DO NOT BUY IT, Trust me, YOU'LL BE SORRY IF YOU DO, I believe in series continuity just like the next guy and I feel like I need to get every movie in a series but if I don't like a sequel, I DON'T BUY IT...........PERIOD and I didn't like this one AT ALL, Stay away from it!",1265414400,7,4354,4.5152284263959395
3301223,3,B0011G6FDI,"I'm a huge fan of Rob Zombie. I am very sad that I have to say this about his 2 different films Halloween 2 theatrical with better ending. Spoilers alert read no further if you haven't seen the director's cut! The directors cut has more gore as suspected and more nudity. Also it has more of Rob's famous seventy's exploitation style! Both versions are entirely different films in an effort to make more money. This is from a huge fan! The theatrical version has John Carpender's theme and is a better film, more 80's style. I prefer Halloween movies with the only scary parts included suspense,(Rob only had that with his first movie, House of a thousand corpses! The directors cut has great stuff but no theme or suspense just plenty of shock and gore more disturbing images and I think more nudity. Rob is an innovator of what's been done before, but not since the seventy's. Italian directors such as, Joe D'mato, Dadanto, and others have out gored him but those films weren't received well in the States, Unfortunately even Argento's and Bava's movies are better than this. I love you Rob but I had to write this review because you tried to cash out in a bad economy! Both films are great horror films and to the point, but why do the true fans have to buy 2 of the same film. Rob, you should have packaged this differently, it's not fare to fans, like myself. PS. Danielle Harris is still adorable!!!",1265328000,3,1406,4.539370078740157

3301225,3,B0011G6FDI,"Let's start out by admitting that Rob Zombie creates a kind of pornography of violence in every film he makes.  There HAS to be, at all times and everywhere, a woman getting stabbed, psychopathic characters (and not just Michael or whatever killer he's schmoozing about) breaking each others' necks, etc.  That's what his shtick is.

I don't deny that he's creative, but the impulses behind his creativity are limited.  He wants to paint a landscape of evil, white trash, corruption and just anything depraved at all, and he does it: but it's so excessive and over the top that I can't take him seriously.  And I'm kind of glad.

I liked the nod he gave to Herk Harvey and ""Carnival of Souls"" with this one and the supernatural element added to Michael, but where is the Passion of Dr. Loomis?  Malcolm McDowell was wasted in the first one but he is *especially* wasted in this one.  I longed for Donald Pleasance as Zombie takes us on pointless book signings and celebrity rides with a corrupt, fame hungry Dr. Loomis (the point Rob Zombie wants to make is thus: there are no heroes.  There will be no Van Helsing to Michael's Dracula as there were in the originals.  Everything and everyone is corrupt in my movies, and if they aren't, they're ineffectual.  Like Brad Dourif as the sherrif. When Brad Dourif is the only good guy in the movie, you know you're in a bad landscape.)

Michael GRUNTING?  Are you KIDDING ME?  Where is the subtlety, the REALLY scary motherf**ker we saw in Halloween 2 who doesn't make a sound and strikes like a quiet serpent?  What is this goofball mask about that exposes half his face?  You can talk about nostalgia and creative liberty all you want, but the simple fact of the matter is that this does not live up to the original sequel one iota.  It's goofball fun.  The only thing that was fun about it was the general celebration of the horror genre going on in the background, like at the party scene. Halloween 5 sucked, so what was the point of bringing that actress back?  Rob's private nostalgia?  And the ending!  I was hoping Zombie would show us his true colors as an artist with a real resurrection of Michael's terror, but again, he had to rob the ending of another movie to get by.  This was entertaining if a little excessive, and that's it.",1265068800,,2290,4.547677261613692
3301226,1,B0011G6FDI,The worst movie i have ever seen in my entire life. Laurie and Dr. Loomis have now become mean. The personalities are completely different from the original.

3301227,4,B0011G6FDI,"Before I even get into the review of this movie as a whole, I've seen so many reviews of ppl having no clue to the relevance of what we see throughout the entire movie.. Michael's mother standing next to a white horse. This is because to appreciate and understand what's happening, you HAVE to pay attention from the 1st second.

This isn't a movie you can put in, then walk away or you'll miss the most important part of the explanation of what you later continue to see. At the beginning of the movie, there's a quote of the meaning of certain dreams, i.e the white horse. It also explains (as the movie progresses) why Michael himself is so much different in his killings with alot more rage and anger to them than we've seen before. You also have to remember this is a Rob Zombie movie and alot of his movies make you have to think instead of everything being very black and white and spelled out for you scene by scene.

If you miss that quote at the beginning, the whole movie loses alot of meaning and opens the door for alot of confusion. It's also not one that you can talk on the phone for 10 minutes and just pick up knowing what's going on. It's a MUST to READ the beginning where the definition of the white horse and other meanings are to understand why we keep seeing a white horse and his mother in a white dress standing next to it throughout the movie. Too many ppl seem to miss that and then have no clue why it's happening.

We all know Michael is crazy, but in this movie, Rob Zombie gives Michael a voice through young Michael and let's us see what it is that Michael sees to make him do what he does. In other words, since Michael never talks, if something needs to be said, it's young Michael who does the talking.

Before Michael's mother killed herself in the 1st Zombie 'Halloween', it flashes back to his mother giving Michael a white horse while he's locked up. Young Michael tells his mother it reminds him of a dream he had. When she asks what the dream was about, he tells her she was wearing a white dress, how beautiful she looked, and how she was walking with a white horse promising to take him home.

She tells him when he sees the white horse she gave him to think of her. She meant it as any mom would in the sense of when he looks at the horse she gave him, to think of her and it'll be his reminder that she's always with him. In Michael's mind, it takes on a whole new meaning because this is the vision he sees before he attacks as some kind of message from her... mom in a white dress standing next to a white horse promising to take him home. But in his mind, it also means nobody goes ""home"" until they can all be together by finding his sister and bringing her home too.

With that said, this movie starts off exactly where the last Rob Zombie version left off. Laurie is running down the street all bloody after she shot Michael. Time goes by and she's now living with her best friend that survived and her friends father (The Sheriff). She's still dealing with everything that happened. She has horrible nightmares that are pretty creepy, and has completely changed from her sweet and innocent look she used to have. She goes to therapy and is having a difficult time because Halloween is coming up of course and she's still having trouble dealing with the death of her parents and why this guy was after her in the 1st place.

Once again, Michael is after his sister, killing anyone who gets in his way on his mission. There's Laurie's life and then Michaels life you'll keep seeing, but the 2 seem to intertwine. They have some kind of connection as many of the things she sees, feels, experiences, and even tastes is somehow connected to what Michaels doing, experiencing, tasting and feeling. Soon enough she finds out through a tell all book that Dr. Loomis wrote of all that took place and gives away who Laurie Strode really is (Michaels sister). Laurie reads it and freaks out of course and thats when things get going as he's getting closer to her. The closer he gets, the deeper this strange connection is where she's almost becoming a part of him.

Michael keeps seeing his mother and the white horse as their mother keeps letting Michael know it's time to bring Laurie ""home"" with him.. just like his dream at the beginning.

It's also not the same young Michael that was in the 1st movie but don't let that throw you off. People have complained about that but the kid who played young Michael in the 1st one is a teen now. You can't have flashbacks of a child when that child is now a large teenager. You need to keep that in mind and not let it distract you.

Michael finds Laurie as he always does and it just gets even more strange from there with what she's seeing and what's really happening. Her reality is off. To explain why is open to interpretation and also would give away too much. Overall, this movie is good but you have to pay attention to make the movie itself even make sense when it comes to this odd connection between Michael, Laurie, and their mom.

As a footnote, there was something missing throughout the entire movie that I think took away alot of what the Halloween movies are famous for. The creepy piano score music wasn't there. You only hear it once at the end of the movie and that's a HUGE part of what makes the Halloween movies so great. When you hear that music, you know something is about to happen. But in this one, there's silence and hardly any music at all actually. To me, even though it was a good movie, to take that out was a big mistake.",1264896000,2,5545,4.3375120540019285

But this sequel just plain sucked.  I found myself laughing out loud at the pitiful acting (""Breathing excercises?  BREATHING EXERCISES?!?""), and the needless, excessive gore was just - well - just that: needless and excessive.  Was there even a plot to this flick?  In the end it just seemed like a back-and-forth marathon of over-acted crying scenes with the girl playing Laurie Strode, then a ridiculously gory murder, then the crying, then a murder, and so on.

Fair sequel to Rob Zombie's unneccessary but enjoyable remake of ""Halloween"" from John Carpenter. This one isn't a remake of the underrated 1981 Halloween 2 but more in name-only except with a few homages to the original part 2 such as the hospital but done in a nightmare. The film features suprises appearences by Weird Al Yankovich and Caroline Willaims (Texas Chainsaw Massacre 2) just for the fans, it's very entertaining but feels like a jumbled mess at times. There's too much white-trash in this one which i think Zombie has a foundness for except that it was done well in his first two movies which were great but not for the Halloween series. And feels too much like a Friday The 13th then an actual movie on the Halloween franchise, there's also too much vulgarity which sounds like the kind that the Full Metal Jacket drill Sgt would say with graphic gory violence. All in all it's not bad for a sequel but i think Rob Zombie had enough of Halloween and will make one more remake called The Blob then back to doing original stuff like his dream project ""Tyranosaurous Rex"", although ""Haunted World of El Superbeasto"" made up for this one.

As it turned out I gave Zombie props for providing everyone with a ""re-make"" instead of a ""re-do"". A re-make is when a director takes an old film, sometimes even a classic, and makes it different, and ideally, *better*. A re-do is when a director takes a film and adds nothing to the original. Zombie may not have made a *better* movie than the original, but he sure did give the movie a unique spin.

The first half of Zombie's 2007 Halloween was devoted to telling the Michael Myers story. The movie started by showing Myers' at age 10. It's during this time that Zombie chronicles how Myers went from troubled to tormented to demented to completely psychopathic. The kid that played Myers at age 10 was outstanding. In fact, the first half of Zombie's first Halloween movie was so well done that I was saying to myself as I was watching that ""this is a great movie."" But then the second half just collapsed with too many clich&eacute; horror movie ""oh that would never really happen"" moments. The whole point of the first half of Zombie's first Halloween movie seemed to attempt to show that Myers was human and just a psychopath, but that starts to go out the window in the second half as Myers starts showing a few immortal traits.

And Zombie's 2009 Halloween II pick's up right where the first one left off, and it takes the unbelievable and the supernatural aspects of the first movie and expands on them resulting in kind of a mess of a movie. And speaking of mess, the Myers murders in Halloween II are brutal. Not so much gory as plain outright savagely brutal. So if that's your bag, then at least you get that with Halloween II. Halloween II has some flashbacks to Halloween I, but it's not even the same kid playing young Michael Myers; in H2 it's some look-alike kid that's unremarkable at best.

If you're a preservationist that doesn't want his classics messed with, then Zombie's adaptations of Carpenter's Halloween franchise will probably leave you angry and unsatisfied. I, on the other hand, was entertained by Zombie's Halloween, but the second one, the one that this review is attached to, left me feeling that maybe Zombie gave us one Halloween too many.",1264723200,5,2630,5.3173076923076925

3301243,1,B0011G6FDI,"""Halloween 2"" is an intelligent failure. The obviously talented and wise Rob Zombie, in my humble opinion, saw too big for his tail of a mute and ineffable human wreck who wants to kill his sister in order to bring her back to his ghostly family. You simply can't put too much layers of metaphores into something that doens't allow it. The leitmotiv of the white horse, the visions of the mother and little Michael shared by both Laurie and the big Michael, all this falls flat. A little more and you'd start hearing a voice-over. It's easy to see that Mr. Zombie wanted it to be his ""Blade Runner"".

I really wanted to like ""Halloween 2"". Rob Zombie's course as a horror filmmaker is an interresting and promising one. His first and subsequent movies weren't necessarily perfect but they did show a sensible, yet twisted and demented, artist with a true vision and a thing or two to say. In interviews or within his own documentaries, you see him as a cunning and visionary author who truly has his characters and story at heart. The people he works with seems to want to go at incredible lenghts in order to please him.

Here, he kept saying that he could at last be free and bring his visions to a full circle. But Michael Myers, without any emotion or lines, simply doesn't have enough ""juice"" to go on for two hours. And the other characters are either tiring, annoying (the ever so screaming Laurie), misscast or simply laughable. Brad Dourif as the sheriff and Malcom Mcdowell are probably crazier and scarier than Michael Myers, the self-centered psychologist being built as a badly-written archetype character with a cheap and clich attempt at redemption at the end.

Plus, after seing movies like ""Scream"" and others ""Horror Movie"" who made fun of all the clichs used in horror films, you'd think that a wise person like Rob Zombie wouldn't put those clichs in his ""serious"" movie... well, those clichs are there all right. The killer walking calmly still managing to catch the running victims, The killer appearing out of nowhere, the victims (with a close-up on their faces) not seing the killer who's beside them simply because we, as spectators, aren't seing him either, the victims who's hidden places are revealed to the killer because they can't stop screaming, i mean heck! A bit more and they would have pull the old trick of the cat behind the door.

Plus Rob Zombie, i feel, made an error of tone. In his previous movies (""House..."" and ""... Rejects""), the story allowed for quaint, hillbilly characters. Not here. It's more dark, serious and ""deep"". Therefore, The crazy and scary looking sheriff or psychologist don't fit. And Rob Zombie, although i think he is talented, has weak points nonetheless. One of those is to always put simple and stupid characters with cheap lines, like the two ambulance drivers in the beginning.

The long nightmare at the start is also a perfect example of a director shooting himself in the foot. By the time we realize that it is a nightmare, we've already said ten times to ourselves that it was stupid and clich. Even if we're going ""Oh, ok. It's a bad dream. We can start over."", the damage, i feel, is already done.

I mean, the story was so small that Michael Myers needed to voluntarily make a couple of useless detours in order to kill complete innocent strangers who didn't have any link what-so-ever with the main plot, thus making these horrible kills perfectly gratuitous. Killing for the sake of killing.

All in all, i'm still very curious about Rob Zombie's visions and i'm still going to follow him in his creative, yet twisted, journey as a filmmaker. ""Halloween 2"" was a ""faux pas"" but i think that ultimately, he will become better and more focused because of it.

In my humble opinion of course.",1264636800,2,3771,4.694402420574886
3301244,1,B0011G6FDI,"With a slew of horror movie remakes lately, this one has to be the worst.  First, let me say that I wasn't a fan of the first one, but this one was about 10 times worse.  It has to be the most disgusting, vile movie I have ever seen.  I am never watching another RZ movie again, I wish filmmakers would leave the classics along, Friday the 13th, My Bloody Valentine, Halloween and now they are remaking A Nightmare on Elm Street.  Will it never end?  None of them can hold a candle to the original, the three mentioned above were all horrible.  The killings in this movie were just way over the top in being violent and sick.  Please RZ do not remake The Blob ( as I have read he will) and ruin that movie as well.  Laurie annoyed the heck out of me as did the Dr. Loomis character, the only thing interesting about the movie was Danielle Harris (Jamie from Halloween 4&5) being in the movie.  Please don't waste your money or time on this movie.",1264464000,12,946,4.211111111111111
3301245,3,B0011G6FDI,"I bought this blu-ray having seen the original theatrical version. While I enjoyed that version this director's cut is nearly a completely different movie. Rob Zombie expands on the story of his two main characters, Micheal Myers and Laurie Strode. But the direction he takes them in isn't necessarily a better one. This is one case for me where less is more. And the ending is very different as well. So be forewarned that if you liked the theatrical version, this version is very different and you may or may not like it.",1264377600,,523,4.634408602150538
3301246,4,B0011G6FDI,"I am a huge fan of the original.  I think it ranks as one of the top 5 horror of all time...and always will.  This movie is bloody, brutal, and does not appologize for a damn thing.  I never expected to be a fan of Rob Zombie's film - but H2 ranks up there with Devil's Rejects.  This movie was pure Zombie.  All slasher sequels have the killers fit into the same mold, Zombie actually humanized this character we have seen thru 8 movies.  For the general Final Destination going audience, this movie does not play like a video game.  It makes you think more than most slashers do.  I recommend it to anyone that enjoyed Rob Zombie's movies - and any Halloween fans with an open mind...  And I will never hear Nights in White Satin and Love Hurts the same way again!",1264291200,2,766,4.263888888888889
3301247,1,B0011G6FDI,"Wow! Let me begin by saying that I would rate the original Halloween 1 and 2 a four. I would rate Halloween 1- Rob Zombie remake a 2.5 if possible but since it isn't I believe I rated it a 3. However, this movie- OMG. Where to begin? Didn't Dr. Loomis die in the first movie of the remake? I think he did but he is alive and very greedy in this one. He also portrays very little moral. Laurie is just a nut- a girl with way too many psycho episodes and with too many anxiety and anger issues- sweet, depressed, reliable Laurie Stroude she is not. Micheal, well he talks and makes noises. He also walks around without a mask and we see his whole face and wow it has way too much facial hair! Then there is this whole issue with visions that Micheal has and dreams that Laurie does (acted mostly by Zombies wife I hear) that really don't make sense- they simply don't fit. They just make the film seem odd. The timing in the movie is off- the first remake seemed to be made modern day, this remake who knows. The TV's are turn dials and black and white, yet there are cars from the 90's and there is rock parapanalia (spelling?) all over the place that make me think of the late 90's. Also, Zombie seems to have taken parts of other Halloween sequels and used them in this part- yawn. In addition, I don't know if some parts were meant to be funny but if they were they fell flat. As for what was wrong with the first remake, that continues to be wrong here, there is entirely too much trash going on. This is not the middle class suburb that John Carpenter portrayed in his movies. These characters are very much working class and at the same time lacking class. The characters cuss all too much and without good reason alot of the time, just for the sake of it seems. This movie tries to go into Micheals Psychi (spelling?) making him human but just crazy rather than the simple he's just a psychopath. There is no suspense just kill, kill. Oh and no joke her- Micheal kills and eats a dog (a twist but really unnecessary.) Wow!",1264291200,3,2028,4.242894056847545
3301258,1,B0011G6FDI,"First let me say i have always been a fan of the Halloween movies since i was a child. The original is one of the best horror movies of all time (in my opinion). After the Rob Zombie remake i thought they have a guy who cares about the franchise and will make them ""scary"" again as the first one was. This garbage is not! Why is Rob Zombie's wife in every one of his movies? Anyway the problem i have is Laurie isn't even a likable character. Also neither is Dr. Loomis. In the original you got behind the 2 main characters almost rooting for them. In this one i found myself WANTING Michael Myers to KILL them!! The characters are horrible, foul mouthed people, with Laurie being a promiscuous woman(or so i thought). Jamie Lee played the part the way it should be-the virginal good kid. Dont they know the rules(thanks Scream!) I am ashamed that Rob Zombie would put out something like this, yes the killing was more brutal with the stabbings and all but overall the characters and story were very weak.

3301259,5,B0011G6FDI,"Warning: the following review may contain spoilers and/or reference to hardcore boozing.  Suitable for selected audiences.
Just finished re-screening the first part of Halloween II while eating dinner and giving some Bitburger ale a proper seeing-to.  This was followed by a shot of Johnnie Walker Black Label.
The way I see it, Halloween and Halloween II are ritual drama.  The plot is obscure, verging on the incoherent.  Michael Meyers' mother, after her suicide, has apparently crossed over to the dark side and is now exhorting Michael to bring Boo home - i.e. stab the living crud out of her.  This, seemingly is Michael's mission.  Michael lives off the land, walking cross-lots a la Shawcross.  However, in the process of finding Boo - Laurie Strode, who has now refreshingly turned into a foul-mouthed, death-rocking nightmare on wheels, Michael must also put down many worthless hillbillies.  This indiscriminate killing does not seem related to his vision quest to stab Boo to death, and so contributes to the dream-like incoherence of the plot.  I mean it's hardly like Michael is harvesting these souls to populate the same ""heaven"" to which he is recruiting Boo.  One gets the impression that these souls are undesirable.  And yet slay them Michael must and slay them Michael does, for reasons known only to himself.
Also, as the story progresses, Young Michael appears alongside the adult Michael, leading the earnest viewer to drunkenly conclude that the adult Michael is a kind of Golem, created by his now-evil mother, to roam the earth and cull garbalogical humans while on his solemn quest to slay Boo down.
Meanwhile, Loomis has himself turned into a nightmare on wheels.  His eventual slaying by Michael seems to confer more dignity than he merits.  This adds to the basic sense of incoherence and dream logic, elements that seem intrinsic to ritual drama.  In ritual drama, the audience knows what must happen.  People must run screaming with their faces carved up and purple blood bubbling from their mouths while their eyes work apoplectically.  The audience knows the necessary plot so well that what does happen is soothingly immaterial.  Due to this strict determinism, the movie goes through its evolutions with the tranquility of things already happened.  In such a ritual drama, only the incoherence of the plot lends the sense of possibility and space.  Thus, in a Noh drama, the Samurai who slays the evil witch who flys about by whirling her long neck, he is lent charisma and dignity by the fact that his actions are at a basic level incomprehensible.  The basic message being a metaphysical observation: if the world did not contain something irrational, it could not be.",1264291200,3,2707,5.026905829596412
3301260,5,B0011G6FDI,"If you are going to watch the new Halloween films, let me state that you need to watch the UNRATED director's cut versions and not the theatrical versions. I can honestly say that now Rob Zombie's Halloween films are among my top favorite films of all time. He has done an incredible job of taking the character Michael Myers and making him ""human"". Don't get me wrong. I appreciate the original but now there is a complete story to the mayhem inside Michael's mind. The story is believable and realistic. I don't want to give anything away but I will say this is NOT a remake of Halloween Two. Unlike the first Zombie film which did somewhat follow along the original (except for the addition of a few murders and the institution scenes) this film is entirely different. I will say that the opening few minutes of the film recreate the hospital massacre (with even more brutality) but the rest of the film then jumps ahead to two years later. I won't say anything more than that. What you can expect is to be genuinely terrified.

Forget what you know about the old films. This is a more brutal Michael and yet at the same time, you almost feel a little sorry for him because he is so mentally disturbed. I also wasn't thrilled with the casting of Laurie in the first Zombie movie, but I have to say she really shined as an actress in this one and I now appreciate her more. Keep an open mind and check out this movie!",1264204800,5,1419,4.395437262357414
3301261,1,B0011G6FDI,"I grew up watching Michael Meyers. I loved all the Halloween movies even the most hated one Resurrection. And i aint gonna lie Rob Zombie did a OK job with the first one, but he totally missed on the second. Making Michael have flashbacks of his mom and a white horse. This was just a lame way to put his wife in the movie. The story just bores. The characters are stupid. Why do you have to show Michael without his mask so much. Meyers is suppose to be scary. By the end of the movie you lose interst in fear for him. And why does he happen to look like Rob Zombie himself without his mask!?! Not to mention the Picture quality of this blu ray is awful.  Anyways TRUE fans of Halloween will be sadly disppointed I was!",1264118400,5,720,4.142857142857143
3301262,3,B0011G6FDI,"I actually really enjoyed Rob Zombies 2007 release, I thought it was well done and enjoyable with nothing too horbly far fetched. However, this was not at all what I had thought it would have been. The first thing that really got me was how awful they made Laurie (Angel) and her friends. I realize that someone with that past would be a little messed up in the future, but as someone previous stated they went from ""Highschool girls to Suicide Girls"". It was overly played that she was mentally disturbed when we see her room and how filthy the area she lives in is, and how trashy her friends are. But that was tolerable- I went along with it. However, I cannot and will not ever be alright with his addition of a young Michael and his mother (Sherri Moon) along with a white horse constantly showing up. A supernatural twist in this film ruined it for me. Perhaps one scene would have been okay for me, but this was repetitive and became annoying. Although I will give him credit, adding The Moody Blues ""The Night- Nights in White Satin"" gave an interesting twist on the perspective of the mother being a ""Knight in white satin"". Aside from that, her constant prescence in the film was ridiculous. Also, having Laurie have the same dreams and visions as Michael and even being held down by a ghost was beyond repair for me. I gave the film a three because without the supernatural ghosties, the story was alright and the effects were good. I doubt if a third comes out I will bother.",1264032000,4,1487,4.470588235294118
3301263,3,B0011G6FDI,"I have to give Rob Zombie credit, for when he makes a sequel he doesn't just make the same film over again. Zombie obviously loves the old horror film and it shows in every horror film he has made. I watched both the unrated and theatrical versions of the film and I think the theatrical moves along more smoothly and has a better ending. The gore is trimmed down slightly, but doesn't take away from this brutal film in any way.

Zombie gives this film a very cool look and does create some eerie atmosphere, but I did find some elements confusing at times and that does take away from the overall experience. I wish they could have had the original actor who played young Michael in the first film as this actor just doesn't seem to be playing the same character. While the original was very withdrawn, the one in this film just seems like a regular kid. This could be due to the fact that he is only in the film as a figment of adult Michael and Angels imagination.

The kill scenes are brutal and not just because of the excessive gore, but because the set ups are genuine and that makes from some gut wrenching murders. Zombie also has a knack for placing actors that we have seen over the years in these scenes, so we feel an little more sorry for them.

The unrated version is longer and pulls us out of the action more times than needed, but it is certainly worth seeing for fans...I just preferred the theatrical. I do have one big gripe, why do they need to release the two versions separately?....I know the answer (GREED!), but it's shameful to charge fans twice for a film that isn't all that much different. I know I'm not alone when I say I want both versions, but I don't think it's worth paying the price! Both releases have a bunch of extras that are the same including outtakes, gag reel, music videos by the kooky horror band in the film and commentary.

Overall if you like Zombie or newer horror films, you will probably like this film. I happen to love old horror film,but there are some good horror films out there today and this film will stay with you like all of Zombies Horror outings.....and isn't that what good horror films should do?",1264032000,17,2165,4.3915211970074814
3301264,4,B0011G6FDI,"After an extremely long month+ layover, Sid the Elf has made a triumphant return back into the world of B. It was long overdue and thought a great way to celebrate would be with the newly released Halloween 2. Now as you may or may not know the Sid brothers are a huge fan of the original Halloween series but never turn down the chance to check out a different concept of Myers. Original Myers has always been one of the most feared characters in horror history with good reason. He's an unstoppable force of sheer terror, but did lack in a few departments. Zombie's version of Myers takes removes any lack of fear due to the fact that he's a giant lunatic with superhuman strength. Never before have the killings been more gruesome. Say farewell to the typical stabbings as he goes to new lengths to keep your jaw dropped in pure shock. We'd even put money on the fact that Zombie's Myers would kick the snot out of original Myers hands down.

In Halloween 2 Zombie took his own spin on things making the film entirely his own idea. Yeah there's a little bit of hospital action going down, but nothing like the original Halloween 2. We pick up with a very jacked up pill addicted Laurie Strode trying to erase the memory of Myers prior attacks. With Loomis pushing his new top selling book, that exploits Laurie at every turn, all the old wounds are opened up while Myers gets back to business as usual. While seeing visions of his mother along with a young version of himself (CRAZY CRAZY) he becomes more and more enraged demolishing anyone in his path on his quest to finish off his sister Laurie. Overall the film was pretty solid but was almost too much. We've never seen a Myers this brutal leaving us legitimately freaked out which is what earned it 4 stars. So if there's any question to who is king of the slasher, there is no other correct answer besides new Myers. This guy will mess you up for the rest of your life.",1263945600,3,1930,4.421348314606742
3301265,5,B0011G6FDI,"Michael Myers was always my favorite horror icon, scared the crap out of me as a kid and after the first two original films, was hoping for more of the same (not watered down sequels).  It never happened, then came the re-envisioned first Halloween.  I loved Rob's House of a Thousand Corpses and Devil's Rejects so when I saw the first one, my mind was blown. I like opening my mind to new ideas, a new take on my favorite Horror movie.  Like most, I was dying for Rob's Halloween 2, I missed the theatrical release (long story) so it was even worse to wait for the Blu-ray to come out.

Zombie did it again, right when I thought I had an idea of what he was going to do, he elevates the story. The beginning was very cool with reflections of the original Halloween 2 and then made it just a nightmare. LOVED THAT! Why?  Because now I didn't know what was going to happen.  Making Laurie mentally/emotionally lose it was brilliant, I  mean how could that onslaught from Michael in the first movie not do that to any sane person?

Loved the Sheriff bringing Laurie into his home and of course watching how Annie and Laurie's relationship fall apart due to what happened to them.  The ending was beautiful, Rob knew what to do with his story version and how to give it great closure.  Not sure why people hated how Loomis turned out, I loved the original but this Loomis is not the same character.  Fame got to his head, Rob showed flaws in Loomis. Nice touch.

Also Michael is a nut case, why wouldn't he imagine himself as a kid and talking to his mother?  It fit this version of Halloween.  Over all, it was a great fresh surprise in Halloween 2. It makes me sad that it's done for Zombie but I also didn't want ten sequels.

Thank you Rob for this version of Michael Myers, I loved the original and this version, sits right next to it in my heart of Horrors.",1263945600,2,1861,4.307471264367816
3301266,2,B0011G6FDI,"Well I would first warn any readers that this review may contain some spoilers, but honestly, I don't think it would even really matter. In fact, I might be doing some of you guys a favor by telling you what happens in the film rather than you having to actually sit and watch it! Ok ok..maybe this film is not THAT bad, but it isn't good by any means, and you shouldn't be expecting anything great, especially if you've seen the first installment of the Zombie remake. And that's why I definitely wasn't expecting anything good before going to the theaters to watch this film, but I left the theater just as disappointed as I did after viewing the first remake. But since I'm a big horror fan, and have purchased all the other Halloween films, including the first Zombie film, I had to buy this one too, and decided to give this one a couple of more viewings before writing this review. But to say my opinion has changed any since I viewed this film the first time, that really isn't the case. Just like the first film, there are just way too many things wrong with this film for me to really enjoy it.
  So where do I begin to list the many problems I have with this film? How bout the way Rob Zombie dupes the audience into thinking the movie is going to be actually semi-decent in the first 25 minutes of the movie? Talk about being completely disappointed! When watching this for the first time, and seeing the hospital chase scene, like that of the original Halloween 2, I was thinking to myself..could it be? Has Rob Zombie redeemed himself here and actually made a straight-forward, in-your-face film that pays true homage to the original films? My interest was peaked..and I was genuinely excited..until of course, Laurie wakes up, and you find out that Zombie just used the oldest trick in the book to fool, and in my case, disappoint his audience.
  Now onto other problems..first off, the Laurie Strode character. The way her character is portrayed, it's just really hard to sympathize with her. For the most part, she comes off as a bitch, using the F word every other word in many scenes (which can be blamed on bad script writing as well). She's sad and depressed one minute, then is a wild, care-free party chick the next..there are really no qualities about her that make me want to care about her character at all. And the Sam Loomis character, where do I begin here? His character was so painful to watch. Just a complete travesty compared to the original Loomis character played by Donald Pleasance. Why turn the Loomis character into a money hungry, self-centered bastard? Then only have him ""turn"" good in the last 10 minutes of the film, like its gonna make a difference..its completely unbelievable. Now I'm not blaming Mr. McDowell for his performance. For the kind of character I'm sure he was told to portray, he did an alright job.  Again, its the overall writing of the character that's so bad. Also, there's a new actor that plays young Michael Myers rather than Daeg Faerch. And although Chase Vanek looks the part much better than Faerch did, his acting leaves much to be desired, with all his lines being almost read in a monotone voice. The same could be pretty much said about Sheri Moon's performance as well, which was mediocre at best.
  Now on to Michael Myers..just when I thought Rob Zombie had done enough damage to his character in the first film, his continues to do so in this one. The grunting when he's stabbing people, the hoodie he wears (are u kidding me, a hoodie?!), the 10 little cut scenes where it shows him walking through some field like Bigfoot, giving him superpowers to be able to turn cars over, and worst of all..showing his face time and time again! Since Zombie claims to be such a horror fan, I would think he would have learned something from suspense master Alfred Hitchcock, and that is, many things should be left up the audience's imagination. The great thing about Michael Myers is that blank, emotionless mask. You don't know what is behind it, and that's a great thing. But when you show his face, and he looks just like some big bearded guy (actually, he looks like Zakk Wylde!), then it takes away from the character, and is much less scary or mysterious. But even that isn't as bad as what happens at the end of the film, when Michael actually SPEAKS..yes, speaks! This is a different ending from that of the theatrical version, and overall, I thought this unrated directors was actually better than that version, but when Michael utters the word ""Die!"" to Loomis at the end, I just shook my head in disgust.
  Much like the first film, I feel that Zombie just missed the mark here. First off, why have Michael's mother as the main catalyst for his rage? For originality, I give him a 1 for that. Hasn't he ever heard of any little movies called Friday the 13th?! The point of Michael Myers doing the evil things he does, is just that..he's pure evil. You don't know his motives, and again, not knowing something is scarier then trying to give an explanation to everything. Not only does Zombie give you this explanation, but he runs it into the ground by showing scene after scene of a white horse or Michael's mother, and young Michael, while they're talking off bad dialogue. Yeah, we get it, enough is enough..the audience doesn't need to be reminded of it every 5 minutes. It felt like more or less that Zombie just put those scenes in to give his real-life wife more screen time.
  With all the problems I had with this film, I did enjoy a couple of things. Again, the first 25 minutes of the film were good. And I do have to say, that for the most part, this version is better than the theatrical version too. And though I've read some reviews that put down Zombie down for showing more blood and gore, and making the film more violent, this is something I think he did very well. The kill scenes, though simplistic (mostly just stabbing, stomping, or smashing), were done very good.
 Maybe I'm just too hard on this film, I just can't like this movie. Its probably a bit better than the first Halloween, since you're not having to sit through an hour of crappy backstory about Michael's childhood. At least this one jumps right into the story. But the writing and imagining of many of the characters are just plain bad. I understand Zombie wanted to do something different here, but at some point, enough is enough. It's one thing to re-image something, its another thing to completely change established characters and story. With just a little tweaking, this could be an entirely different film, having nothing to do with the Halloween series at all. Slap another title on it, and there you have it. And I think I would have really liked these two films, if that was the case. However, when remaking or re-imaging an established classic film, there should be some boundaries. Simply put, Zombie should just stick to creating original material.",1263945600,6,6929,4.592562651576395

3301278,4,B0011G6FDI,I wanted to see this movie in the theatre but missed it. So when it came out on DVD i scooped it up ASAP! I was not disappointed! I love the way Zombie made this sequel! He did not change Carpenters' Halloween nor do I think he meant to. He improved on a classic and gave it more depth and understanding of all the characters. I have to say it isn't really scary but the shock and brutality that occurrs in this film make up for that!!! I love the way he uses the Moody Blues' Nights in White Satin song. It fits the scenes perfectly; including the White Horse reference. I like how Zombie humanizes the death and depravity of the murdered victims throughout the movie unlike some other horror flicks that just show non-sensical slaughter with no emotional attachment. I unfortunately did not like Zombie's first installment of Halloween but this definitely takes the cake!!! Rob Rocks!!!!!!!,1263859200,,892,4.616352201257862

Rob Zombie has a really morbid perspective when he does movies so I had extremely high expectations. The plot was decent, the horror was good. I would've wanted to see more actual gore rather than the after-effects of someone being stabbed/pummeled. His first Halloween was 100 times better, but then again how could you top that!!! Overall, I'd still recommend this movie because the storyline actually made sense and of course he leaves the door open for M. Myers to come back for another go. I can't allow my expectations to ruin the ratings of a good film. It's worth seeing once.",1263859200,,678,4.6115702479338845
3301282,3,B0011G6FDI,"*** THIS REVIEW MAY CONTAIN SPOILERS *** SPOILER ALERT! ***

""Halloween II"" is a bit of a disappointment as a follow-up to Zombie's remake of the original.  That doesn't mean that the movie is bad.  My main problems with the movie are how dark the picture is (there are several scenes where you can't really see what's going on. It's all part of Zombie's direction though, which is good in it's own way) and the ""reviving"" of several characters that were victims of Michael Myers' previous killing spree in ""Rob Zombie's Halloween"". For example, Dr. Loomis is a prominent figure in ""Halloween II"". I seem to remember the end of ""Rob Zombie's Halloween"" when Loomis has his eyes CRUSHED INSIDE HIS SKULL by Michael Myers. Even if you firmly believe in suspension of disbelief, which I do, it is very far-fetched that Loomis would survive such an attack, let alone regain his sight for this sequel  (and yes, I know that Loomis is seen alive after the attack in ""Rob Zombie's Halloween""... that's too far-fetched as well). Too unbelievable, even for a horror movie. I also didn't really care for the dream sequences, they seem kinda corny and are used as simple filler material at times to provide some lengthy Myers' killing scenes, seemingly to take up time. I think the script was probably short to begin with and was difficult to stretch into a 90 minute movie, thus the dream sequences.  I really don't like Scout-Taylor Compton's acting, and unfortunately, the entire movie centers around her character, Lorrie Strode.  I have heard some people review this movie and say, ""This is Rob Zombie's best film yet.""  That's not true at all.  It's his worst if you have to pick a spot for it. Again, that doesn't make it bad. The movie doesn't skimp on violence at all, as this sequel is as brutal as any other Rob Zombie film, thus far at least. The movie is overall disturbing and depressing and entertaining.  Despite it's flaws, I enjoyed it.  3 and 1/4 stars.",1263859200,2,1961,4.690962099125365
3301283,5,B0011G6FDI,"The directors cut of Rob Zombie's HALLOWEEN 2 is certainly the finest film in the series since John Carpenter's original film.  I didn't think Zombie's original remake was exceptional, although it was miles ahead of most of the garbage remakes we are being subjected to by the likes of Michael Bay and his wretched cohorts at Platinum Dunes. Based on bad word of mouth from friends and reviewers I decided to skip this film in the theatres and check it out when the video was released.  I watched it at a friends house last night and this morning got out of bed and rushed to the store to buy my own copy.  This was so much more than I expected it to be, in fact I would suggest that it is the finest sequel to a slasher film ever made, and certainly the most artfully photographed.

I can full understand why those wanting nothing more than a remake of the original HALLOWEEN 2 would have problems with this film, and I can also relate to the problems people have with changing a beloved horror icon into something new and different, but the changes Zombie has made have truly brought new life and a new (and far more original) direction to this series.  Michael Myers is now far more frightening without his mask than he is with it.

I rarely have any emotional connection to the characters and events in a horror film but Rob Zombie pulled a lot of emotions out of me with this one, in particular the stunning ending of the film.  David Lynch has never composed a
more beautiful sequence than the one that ends this film.  All of the scenes that feature Shari Moon Zombie as Deborah Myers are exceptionally beautiful and there is something quite wonderful about seeing her family reunited in this film. / I think it would also take a viewer with a very hard heart not to be moved by the scene where Sheriff Brackett (played very well indeed by Brad Dourif) discovers the body of Annie (Danielle Harris).

HALLOWEEN 2 manages to be beautiful and ugly at the same time.  Zombie shot the film on 16mm stock and it looks pretty good in most scenes.  Surreal images abound in this and of particular interest is the ""dinner party"" which is unlike anything I've seen before.  I don't know where Zombie gets his ideas (and I'm glad such ideas don't come to me) but they are truly original.

Most of the cast is excellent and in addition to Moon, Harris and Douriff, we get wonderful performances from Margot Kidder, Howard Hessman and Bill Faggerbach (spelling?).  Alas, not all of the cast is great.  Malcolm McDowell (miscast in both of these films) is distractingly over the top and the repulsive Scout Taylor-Compton screams, cries and pouts her way through this one and becomes so unlikable that I'm really ready for Michael to cut her open from top to bottom long before the end of the film.  These are serious complaints but I can live with them because everything else in this film works so beautifully.

In response to those who complain that Rob Zombie is ruining the HALLOWEEN franchise, I can only wonder if they have ever watched HALLOWEEN 5, or HALLOWEEN:RESSURECTION (a film so relentlessly awful that I have only watched it twice in my life and never intend to watch it again . . . now that was a film that could wreck a franchise).  The original HALLOWEEN and all of the sequels are still right there on your shelf, ready to be watched whenever you feel like it and they will be exactly as you remember them.  Rob Zombie can not change those films one bit.  If you don't like what he has done with his versions, don't buy them or watch them.

So what is on the disc?  Not as much as the other three Zombie films have had.  There is a highly entertaining commentary track from Zombie (his commentaries are always informative and interesting), some very poor deleted scenes (a half hours worth), some bloopers, several clever music videos of Captain Clegg and the Night Creatures (the band playing at the party in the film) and a dumb unedited Stand-up routine of Uncle Seymore (the guy with the teeth on stage at the party).  The extras are the same on both the DVD and the BluRay and since this is a rather messy looking, grainy film, it is perhaps safe to save your money and buy the DVD rather than the Bluray disc, as the poor film stock is highlighted in higher resolution.  Sony/Dimension decided to really rape viewers by not including both theatrical and director cuts on one disc and forcing them to be bought seperately by those who want to have both versions.  Money grubbing bastards.

While this isn't a perfect film, it is certainly far above average, and a real surprise in this day of inept remakes and idiotic sequels and Michael Bay films.  I really love HALLOWEEN 2.",1263772800,,4696,4.531990521327014
3301284,1,B0011G6FDI,"I'm going to begin with the positives: the movie features Brad Dourif, who is one of the best actors working today, doing his best to give a good performance and hack his way through this with a thinly written character and clunky dialog. Also we get to see legendary veteran actor Malcolm McDowell, in all his charisma and charm. Rob Zombie even manages to build a character arc into the plot for him, however unconvincing it may be.
And now for the negative: this is one of the worst movies I have ever seen. It builds no tension, sustains no suspense, introduces no characters I could care about. It is horribly edited, coming off as a jumble of scenes which do not seem to hang together or build upon each other properly. It is frustrating. Much of the film is confusing, and in the end I just didn't care. At all. It is so poorly written, at times I wasn't believing what I was hearing coming out of the actor's mouths. If all that weren't bad enough, if commits the number one sin of the horror film: it isn't the slightest bit scary. This movie is a mess. I think there were some things here that could have been taken and built upon to make a decent film, but these opportunities were missed. A few shots work on their own, but that's a long way from creating any kind of sustained experience. Dreadful!",1263772800,2,1311,4.399176954732511
3301285,4,B0011G6FDI,"I am a fan of the original Halloween movies.  I have to admit the first time I saw this film, I was quite disappointed.  However, after seeing it a second time I came to really enjoy it.

The main reason I found this second oppinion, is this...

In the original Halloween films it reveals that Laurie Strode is in fact Michael's sister and that Michael is trying to kill everyone in his family, but it never explains why.

In Rob Zombie's second helping of Halloween we finally are given a glimpse as to why he wants his family dead and I feel that that is really what has saved the movie.

Yes there are a lot of dream sequences, but they are vital to revealing the psychology of the movie.

Many of the people who have reviewed this focus on the violence, gore, and fowl language that is rampant in all Rob Zombie movies.  If you are looking to find if this is appropriate for children the answer would be Heck No!  But if you can overlook those aspects as most adults have to do anymore it is not that bad a movie.",1263772800,2,1017,4.227979274611399

I get how it ties into the movie, but it is a different character completely, until the end at the shed.  Finally, Michael has always had sister problems, his mother never told him when to kill, I think that ol' Rob Zombie got Michael and Jason confused.  Should have just changed Haddonfield to a lake and called it Friday the 13th, it would have been better than the last movie in that series.",1263772800,2,571,4.349056603773585
3301287,1,B0011G6FDI,"This film has to set the record for dream sequences, which makes you wonder if the entire film is nothing more than a dream. I wasn't exactly a big fan of the remake from 2007 and expectations for this film were incredibly low, nobody can really be prepared for how terrible this film really is. Since there's so much wrong with this film, we'll try and start with what was actually was enjoyable.

Brad Dourif as Sheriff Brackett is really the highlight of the film as far as acting goes. While that probably isn't saying much and his role isn't as big as you may expect, he does a good job with the screen time he gets. His character is intense right from the start, but as things take a turn for the worse for his character his downward spiral is the most enthralling aspect of the film. A few of the deaths were also really satisfying. Mainly Buddy the Security Guard. There's a night scene where an officer is out on Sheriff Brackett's lawn and we're looking at the silhouette of a tree while the officer searches the premises. Before you know it, we see Michael emerge from that tree silhouette and kill the officer.

Everything else in the film was just horrendous. The flaws are almost so overwhelming that it's nearly impossible to know where to begin. The whole white horse thing is ridiculous. So if Deborah Myers tells young Michael that he can think of her whenever he looks at the white horse figurine she gave him, wouldn't that make her a horse by default? The inconsistencies in the film are incredibly glaring, as well. Laurie and Annie's injuries from the previous film seem more severe at the start of this one, Laurie being able to put weight on an injured leg by walking on it but it causing her extreme pain when she's lifted from a stretcher to a bed at the hospital, Michael chopping off a guy's head with a shard of glass, etc. The ""Nights in White Satin"" thing was literally beaten into your skull by the time the film ended. If you sit through the film, it's like Rob is sitting next to you each time the song comes on nudging you with his elbow going, ""Eh? Do you get it? You get it?"" Michael was way too vocal for my liking. Heavy breathing is one thing, but when we're hearing him grunt loudly every time he stabs somebody then it takes a lot of it. When he actually talked at the end of the film, I was done. He also seemed to spend more time stabbing women than men in the film. Guys get their head chopped off or an axe to the back while women get stabbed a dozen times or have their face smashed against a mirror nine times. The choreography didn't seem as good as the remake either. There's a scene where water gets on the camera and it's on there the entire scene. It's interesting at first, but after a few minutes you just want someone to get a towel to wipe it down. As powerful as Michael seems to be, it at least made a bit more sense in the original film by John Carpenter. Michael was pure evil. That was the explanation, so him not being able to die at least sort of made sense. Now that he's been given this white trash upbringing in the remake, his super strength and inability to die just seems even more farfetched than it originally did. So when Michael is busting through walls and lifting cars with his bare hands all Incredible Hulk style in this film, it's laughable. Not to mention what happened to the Dr. Loomis character. There are just way too many things wrong with this sequel to list here.

Rob Zombie has certainly made Halloween his own with Halloween II. It's just a shame that it's really not worth watching seriously. Let's put it this way, the highlight of the film is Weird Al's cameo. After five films of dealing with white trash families, it's time for Zombie to move on to something different. It's safe to say he's bled that idea bone dry. I wouldn't seriously recommend this film to anyone, but if you're looking for a film to watch with some friends to laugh at and make fun of while it's going then this is the perfect film.",1263772800,4,4000,4.366442953020134
3301298,1,B0011G6FDI,"I have seen some positive reviews for this film and for the life of me, I cannot understand why. Terrible script, terrible acting,terrible dialogue just to name a few problems.

It's just like any other Rob Zombie movie except it is set to Halloween. It's just a bunch of brutality mixed with bad acting, trailer-trash stereotypes, and hallucinations on the part of the protagonist and the antagonist. The camera shots are dull and boring (and shaky - I think that particular 'horror effect' is ridiculous and actually makes movies look worse), a far cry from the original series, which always established truly creative and horrific shots when the Shape appeared.

3301300,1,B0011G6FDI,"Well, it's January again. Christmas time has come and gone, the New Year has begun, and what better way to start things off than with a deluge of horror films. At least that's what Hollywood apparently believes. Apparently the annual January to February tradition for rentals is to make available the many horror films that were released to theaters the previous September and October. The most recent horror film from last year to be released was the not-so eagerly anticipated (at least by me) Rob Zombie sequel to his ""Halloween"" remake from 2007, the aptly titled ""Halloween 2"".

""Halloween 2"" finds Laurie Strode (Scout Taylor Compton) struggling to find some semblance of understanding as to why the masked monstrosity known as Michael Myers attacked her and her friends without provocation. Now, two years after that horrific night, the presumed dead Michael Myers has mysteriously returned to Haddonfield to finish what he started.

While watching this horrible creation spawned from the twisted mind of former rocker turned writer/director Rob Zombie, I was reminded yet again that this new remake driven ""Halloween"" franchise is nothing at all like its predecessor. For clarification, the fact that a remake-centric series is drastically different from the original is not necessarily a bad thing. In this case though, the bad far outweighs any good that one could possibly gleam from the first two entries into the new franchise.

For starters, the initial remake in 2007 was a twisted amalgamation of depravity, sadism, and gratuitous sex and gore that shared only a slight resemblance to the John Carpenter classic to which it was supposedly paying homage. Not only did it have all that working against it, but it also tried to create a sense of empathy for Michael Myers, and I for one do not want to feel sorry for or understand him. I preferred the Michael that was more mysterious and ultimately less savage than what we find in this series. So, with the initial movie, this series of ""Halloween"" films was already off to a bad start and with ""Halloween 2"" the quality appears to have suffered even more.

In the sequel, everything that was sick and twisted about the first film is taken even further in this entry. The gore is even more grotesque and pervasive, the characters are even more morally bankrupt, and the unbridled savagery of Michael is taken to an all-time low for either series. Essentially, there are no redeemable aspects to find within this movie, except (and this is a stretch) it does attempt to bring a resolution to the story that was started in the previous film... oh, and the fact that the movie ends (that was my favorite part of the experience).

Now, this is not to say that the original series was brilliant filmmaking or a treasure trove of movie goodness, but it never once sank to the depths of darkness and despair that has consumed this newest franchise. The aspects that made the original John Carpenter classic so intriguing were as follows: Michael was a mystery to the audience, the story constantly kept a steady pace, the characters were moderately interesting, and whenever an attack were about to occur the suspense was so palpable that it could be cut with a knife.

With Rob Zombie's revisionist look at the series all the suspense has been stripped away and replaced with an in your face approach that leaves nothing to the imagination and excessive gore that rivals the ""Saw"" franchise. The plot plods along at a meandering pace for much of the time. For example, how many times must we be shown Michael just walking around? I get it, the man doesn't really drive or run anywhere he goes, he has to walk, point taken. Then, there's the odd psychological elements included in the movie that are more distracting than illuminating. The intentions of these scenes is to give us some insight into Michael's inner psyche; however, the scenes come off as being an amateurish and pathetic attempt to make the movie seem smarter than it could ever hope to be.

Honestly, these film work best when less time is spent on explaining the reasoning and driving forces for these villains. If Zombie would have paid better attention, the original franchise went south when the writers started trying to explore what made Michael tick, rather than just leave his story be with what was revealed about his and Laurie's connection in the second film. This movie's running time of nearly two hours could have been trimmed down by at least 30 minutes had we removed all the unnecessary walking bits or the nonsensical, ponderous moments showcasing Michael's inner neurosis.

Another oddity to me is the fact that the characters swear with almost every other word that is spoken. I know that they're supposed to be teenagers, some of which have survived some decidedly grisly events, but I think one would be hard-pressed to find any true teenager that has a vocabulary so limited that cuss words are used for the majority of their adjectives, verbs, and so on. To me, I think Rob Zombie takes the approach when making a movie that he is going to take every aspect to the extreme even if it sacrifices realism and/or becomes irritating and disrupts the flow of the movie. Either that or this is an example of just how limited his vocabulary truly is. Who knows?

Now, that I feel I have sufficiently torn into the bulk of the film and its shortcomings, let's discuss the cast for a moment. Out of the entire film, the primary cast members are the only elements that can receive even a glimmer of praise.

Leading the cast is Scout Taylor Compton reprising her role as Laurie Strode. Scout does a passable job of trying to keep Laurie grounded without going too overboard in the hysterics while coping with her nightmarish memories. Although, she does go a little crazy in a few scenes and out of the entire cast she is the primary culprit for using expletives incessantly. As I pointed out above, the constant battery of four letter words does begin to distract. Not to mention, take away from the proceedings, plus making Laurie seem uneducated due to such a restricted vocabulary.

The supporting cast is essentially comprised of the other survivors from the previous movie. Malcolm McDowell as Dr. Sam Loomis, who was one of the best parts of the previous film, is flat-out irritating in this installment. For whatever reason Loomis is now a glory seeking media hound who is trying to find his fame by capitalizing on Michael's murderous rage. Previously, Loomis was a sympathetic character who only wanted to help Michael and then stop him in the end due to his feeling responsible for his continued existence (much the same way as Donald Pleasence's version of Loomis had done). However, in this film, there is only the slightest glimmer of that Dr. Loomis lurking within, and what has replaced him is a narcissistic man who lives solely for the limelight. Despite this change in character, Malcolm does handle this new Loomis very well and makes his purported self-importance believable in every scene.

Rounding out the supporting cast is Brad Dourif and Danielle Harris as Sheriff Brackett and his daughter Annie, respectively. Neither of these two characters really got to do all that much in this film. Both were much more involved in the previous movie, but this time around were relegated to the background and only popping up to provide some arguably questionable moral support for Laurie.

Lastly, Rob Zombie's wife, Sheri Moon Zombie, does appear several times throughout the film, mainly during the moments spotlighting Michael's inner thoughts. Her performance was fairly one-note, nowhere nearly as emotional or intriguing as she had been in the previous film. Plus, her scenes in this movie were some of the most boring and drawn out in the entire film. Her character would have been better off left in the sole flashback sequence seen at the beginning of the movie, as this was the most engaging moment for her character.

Not that this is necessary, but in summation, this movie is an absolutely dreadful piece of cinematic garbage that should have remained in the recesses of Rob Zombie's twisted imagination. Containing only scant moments of interest yet filled to the brim with unreasonable amounts of gore, violence, and language. ""Halloween 2"" is by far one of the worst films ever created for any genre, and that's saying a lot.

""Halloween 2"" is available in rated R and unrated editions; both contain pervasive violence, language, and nudity.",1263772800,4,8514,4.882352941176471
3301301,1,B0011G6FDI,"I am a fan of Zombie and can say I am one of the few that enjoyed ""House of a Thousand Corpses"" and it's sequel.
I was disappointed when he decided to take on remaking ""Halloween"" for the simple reasoning that It's a remake.
I rather have seen a new story being told by Zombie rather than retelling one. I liked his ""Halloween"" but wasn't thrilled by it. I have issues with him changing the idea of Michael Myers of being a mystery and that he is the ""Boogie man"" to an over long epic of his childhood which was all Zombie to then a full fledge remake.
Now here comes ""Halloween 2"" a complete mess that makes the original sequel from 1980 look like a masterpiece in horror. Zombie has to be kidding with his art film-ish visions with ghosts and a white horse. Ok Rob nice why don't you make this art horror film but use an original concept instead of using the ""Halloween"" franchise and it's characters to do It? and BTW you're NOT David Lynch! This movie is just a mess of unoriginal bits and pieces of other ideas. Anyone that says Zombie is a master of horror hasn't seen many older classic horror films to realize he just comes across as a hack with this piece of crap.  There isn't much going on in this opus of crap. Michael wanders around in a field in a hood and a beard., while his mother the ghost trails behind with a white horse (should have been a unicorn, imo). Dreams... Kills a few idiots More dreams...  and then Laurie cries and screams and cries, not because she's being stalked by Michael, no she's having mental issues ...More more dreams.. and I wished Michael would come and end her misery cause she Is so damn annoying.  The ghost and her horse keep showing up and to then start appearing in front of Laurie... ZZzzzzz

3301303,1,B0011G6FDI,"OK I have always thought that the most over rated and useless profession that ever existed is that of a movie critic. However after having just watched this movie I feel compelled to throw in my own opinion even though by my standards it makes me the fool.

  First let me say I love the work of Rob Zombie. His movies have always stood out because of the outstanding cinematography excellent writing and most of all (for me anyway) is the fact that even the most twisted characters were genuinely likeable.

  So this movie did not surprise me in that the cinematography and writing are up to his usual standards, however the most important ingredient in any movie is missing. In my own opinion this movie does not have one single likeable character or even one to sympathize with. I don't know if RZ was trying to make Michael Myers into the sympathetic character by making every on else in the film so un likeable. If this was his intention he picked the wrong character to do this with as MM is by nature a mindless unfeeling killing machine, and who can sympathize with that ? Maybe its just me and I was supposed to like and feel for the female lead, but it wasn't that I felt ambiguous toward her, I actually disliked her. If we were supposed to actually like any of these characters then this was the worst job of casting ever.

  Anyway this is why I think movies critics are worthless pieces of s**t, because we all like different things and for someone to think that their opinion is that of the rest of us should tell you something about their inflated sense of self worth. After all back in the day many critics said ""Gone with the wind"" was a terrible movie. The only reason I wrote this is I'm pissed I spent $19 on the DVD.

3301305,4,B0011G6FDI,"Ignore my review for the first one. After seeing RZ'S first two movies, I have newfound respect for what he did with Halloween and it's sequel.
Let me start by saying after watching the first one a couple times that it grew on me-and Rob Zombie contacting John Carpenter saying he wanted to 'redo his Halloween' when JC said 'make it yours' and he did. The language is kind of excessive, but the storyline in these makes up for that.
I recently saw Devil's Rejects and 1,000 Corpses-didn't care much for them, but Rob's version of Halloween, I like em. I also like Sherri Moon Zombie in both films as Michael's mother, but a few other charecters stand out as well, Brad Dourif does a nice job as Sherrif Brackett, and Malcolm McDowell does a decent Dr. Loomis, but to me these films should be taken on their own merits and not compared to JC's classic, although with a horror classic this well known, comparing is hard...not to do.
I'm not saying that RZ'S version is better, in fact, his version is alot darker, but in many ways he didn't just re-make the story, he re-invented the franchise. Any fan of Michael Myers can certainly appreciate what Rob came up with, although I'm sure some people who enjoyed JC's won't like this one, some won't, but you know what they say' don't judge a book by it's cover, basically, give both of these a chance before assuming you won't like em.",1263600000,3,1382,4.50996015936255

3301307,5,B0011G6FDI,"No, you don't have to be a degenerate to enjoy director Rob Zombie's violent remake/sequel of ""Halloween 2."" Director Rick Rosenthal's original ""Halloween 2"" (1981) qualified as a one-dimensional, no-brainer sequel bloodbath with stabalicious Michael Myers prowling a hospital and killing everybody in sight, not always with a knife. Michael assumed a supernatural omnipotence in ""Halloween 2"" and he survived virtually everything, even being blinded by Laurie. Nevertheless, ""Halloween 2"" told us nothing new about Michael other than he derived satisfaction from killing more people in different ways. Writer & director Zombie doesn't make this mistake with ""Halloween 2"" and it is virtually as brilliant and psychologically insightful as its predecessor. The cinematography and the songs, especially ""Nights in White Satin"" by the Moody Blues, enhance the atmosphere of this chiller. Zombie's ""Halloween 2"" is a surreal saga and a commentary about family values. This remake of ""Halloween 2"" is far more ambitious, gruesome, and psychological than the original.

Briefly, in the prologue, Zombie flashbacks to 10-year old Michael at the mental asylum conversing with his mother (Sheri Moon Zombie of ""House of 1000 Corpses"") about a white horse that she has given him. The first thing we see is a definition of a white horse and that it symbolizes the rage of the protagonist. Meanwhile, the Michael that talks with his mom is the Michael before he retreated behind the mask. Sure, it is unfortunate Zombie couldn't bring back Daeg Faerch to reprise his role as young Michael. According to Zombie, young Faerch had grown too old to play a 10-year old. Nevertheless, Chase Wright Vanek brings his chilly presence to the role, resembling a murderous munchkin.

Thereafter, Zombie's ""Halloween 2"" replicates the original as ambulances deliver both Laurie and Annie (Danielle Harris) to Haddonfield Hospital where the emergency room physicians perform miracles, especially the hacked up Annie. Meanwhile, Sheriff Brackett (Brad Dourif of ""Dune"") orders the coroner to lock up Michael's body until he can examine it. No sooner have the two sleazy attendants loaded Michael and driven off than they slam into a cow on the highway, killing the driver instantly, smashing up his partner, and allowing Michael to escape. At the hospital, Laurie isn't doing so well. Laurie is frantic about Annie and she still suffers from the trauma of having emptied a revolver into Michael. Just as she is regaining her grip on reality, Michael comes a-slashing and nobody can keep him out. He chases a hysterical Laurie during a storm around the hospital and corners her in the security guard shack with a fire axe. He chops his way into the shack, but Laurie manages to escape.

Indeed, Laurie escapes by waking up. Dreams, hallucinations, and nightmares pervade ""Halloween 2"" and you can never be sure when reality is real. Michael is driven by the image of a giant white horse held on a rope by his dutiful mom Deborah, with himself standing alongside her as an angelic 10-year adolescent. Family solidarity means a lot to Michael, and Michael has sworn to reunite the family, even if it means butchering Laurie like a steer. However, Zombie shows us a deeper, psychic linkage between Laurie (Scout Taylor-Compton) and Michael. When Michael (Tyler Mane of "" Troy "") slaughters a dog and dines on it, Zombie cross-cuts images of Michael devouring the dog with Laurie eating a pizza. Psychically, Michael and Laurie groove on the same wavelength and Laurie winds up vomiting. because she can taste the dog meat. Without spelling it out in dialogue, Zombie tells us it is this deep, psychic connection between Michael and Laurie as blood kin that enables him to track her down.

Life after Halloween has not been a picnic for Laurie. She visits her therapist (Margo Kidder of ""Superman""), works at an old hippie-style coffee house run by none other than Howard Hesseman of ""WKRP in Cincinnati ,"" and hangs out with two trippy girlfriends. Repeatedly, Laurie has lurid nightmares about Michael's attacks, but Michael is nowhere nearby. Indeed, he has gone into hiding in the woods, until two pugnacious rednecks catch up with him and too late realize their error. Like the original ""Halloween 2,"" Laurie doesn't know she is related to Michael Myers, and this revelation scrambles her brain.

Laurie Strode is the chief protagonist in ""Halloween 2"" and the film justly belongs to Scout Taylor-Compton as she struggles to survive. She lives now with Annie and her father at their rural house. Not only does ""Halloween 2"" look different from its predecessor, but also Zombie emphasizes the rural quality of the area. In his remake of ""Halloween,"" we were trapped along with the principals in what appeared to be a rural suburb. ""Halloween 2"" takes us back to the woods. Michael spends his time communing with nature and the visions of his mother, the white horse, and himself as an innocent adolescent before he resumes his murderous ways.

Not surprisingly, the violence in ""Halloween 2"" is gruesome but not sickening. In other words, we rarely see close-ups of the knife penetrating flesh. Zombie's favorite tactic is to let Michael strike just as things are calming down and part of this involves sudden movements and things like glass or wood shattered by his fists. There are moments when the violence takes on a traumatic weight that will scare the daylights out of the squeamish while gorehounds may yawn at some of Zombie's discretions.

""Halloween 2"" is both a triumph in style and substance with an ending that suggests Zombie may pull the biggest surprise in the franchise should the saga continue.",1263513600,5,5685,5.080299785867238

Buy the Theatrical version(http://www.amazon.com/Halloween-II-Brad-Dourif/dp/B002V3HT2Q/ref=sr_1_3?ie=UTF8&s=dvd&qid=1263573960&sr=8-3) if you want to see the ending from theaters. I was honestly a little upset that ending was nowhere to be found on this disk.

Don't get me wrong the ending on this version is great too, but completely different than the ending that was in theaters.

In my opinion Rob Zombie makes amazing movies and I loved this movie and the Halloween remake. Very violent, very bloody. Tyler Mane does an amazing job playing Micheal Myers again. Everyone else also does a amazing job as their characters, Sheri Moon Zombie, Scout Taylor-Compton, Brad Dourif, Malcolm McDowell. Everyone. They were all great.

The only thing is that the special features seemed to be lacking for me. Just some deleted scenes, short blooper reel ans some audition footage is about it. I'd honestly rent this and wait for a different version to be released in the future with some more extras.

3301309,1,B0011G6FDI,This was such a horrible mess. Hopefully they won't ask Rob Zombie to do anymore Halloween movies after this crap. His remake was enjoyable- I really liked it- but this was just HORRIBLE. There is no suspense element whatsoever to this movie- he just walks up to people and slashes them to death. It's so overdone that you know it's VERY VERY acted without giving it an element of realism. He should have done another movie with his ideas and left Michael Myers completely out of his idea for a new Halloween because it just doesn't work at all. I doubt they will be asking him to do another Halloween movie since this one bombed so bad. I AM very happy I didn't pay theatre price for this trash.

3301312,2,B0011G6FDI,"Alright...........just watched this mess last night.

Halloween 1 and 2 (the originals) are my favorite horror movie.

Zombies revision (or whatever) of Halloween 1 was pretty cool in my book. My only complaint about that one is at the end of the movie with the whole bashing in the ceiling and walls to get to Laurie...it went on wayyyyy too long.

Now........On to this one.

He ends up in the meat wagon...it hits a cow....he escapes....then what the hell happened? He becomes a character from Lord Of The Rings and WALKS and WALKS and WALKS for 2 years too get back ""home""? What? He looked like a mix between a hobo bum and Mick Foley from the WWE! It was just wierd! And Loomis being an arrogant p***k with an ego bigger than Tyler Mane!!! Hated that!

And....my biggest pet peeve with sequels: If you can't get the same actors from the first movie, DO NOT write a part for that character in the sequel with a different actor! (young Michael)! I F'ING HATE THAT!!!!!

I like Sherry Zombie in The Devils Rejects (one of my faves) but not in this sequel. Her and young (different actor) Michael are just irritating and out of place in this flick.

The kill scenes are great and violent but we don't get to see enough. I like the gory stuff and want to see EVERYTHING. I'm sick like that. The head stomp was pretty good and effective though.

Anyhow....the whole walking cross country and Michael kicking it in barns was just wierd to me. If someone else understands where the hell he was walking from and where the hell he was chillin for 2 years, then feel free to let me know.",1263427200,4,1581,4.446366782006921

3301314,5,B0011G6FDI,"When creating anything in this world one must be true to oneself. Trying to second guess what other people want is pointless and will never produce honest work. With so many remakes out there today, especially of horror film classics, it is important to add something new and fresh beyond fast camera work and digital effects. I feel Zombie has put his heart and soul into this film and made the best film he could possibly make. it feel like he made it for himself and that honesty and conviction shows through in the film to me. For a film like this to resonate with me it needs to have something new. Zombie added his own take on the who, what, when, where, and why and peppered it throughout with homages, nods, and new ideas.

I can see how people might come away thinking all that white horse stuff was just a bunch of mumbo jumbo but for me it added an artistic dimension to the film. It gave me something new to think about. It also made me curious about Zombie a bit more. He is obviously a well read person, even if his reading material may not be the same taste as mine.

The idea of Michael as some Terminator of destruction was toned down and as to the bullet he received in the head in H1, well, it at least can be speculated on. Bullets do go into peoples heads and they live. Sometimes it happens. I come at a film like this differently than i would a film form an other genre. Horror films have a stigma and strikes against them already. To me there are only a few horror films that take it seriously enough to consider it art at all. Most films like this are tongue in cheek and use the cliche language of a thousand horror films past as a roadmap. While Zombie clearly used this language and gave us a few traditional ""cat scares"" there was enough of a departure from this early on for me to get deeply hooked. There was also a realism, power and intensity in this and H1 that I enjoyed greatly.

The power and raw energy that Zombie imparts to Michael is exactly what makes these 2 films of his so great to me. While not unstoppable Michael is still more ferocious than he was in any of the originals. I see Michael as force of nature here, similar to Anton Chigurh in No Country For Old Men. The allusions that are made with Michael to the dark side of man and what horrors we are capable of is the core of what is at work in these 2 films. The originals and many other slasher films may have this in them too, but I suspect Zombie knows this and pushes this aspect of what it is about horror films that make us love them and flirt with so much death. Our mortality and the unknown forces at work in us and what truly makes us tick is important to many slasher films. Rather than just make another unstoppable killer we care little for, Michael in these films and this one in particular is given what often lacks in 99% of films like this...motivation. Michael is motivated to make his family complete again. He is bitter about all that went wrong in his life. His internal clockwork is all messed up and he has been left with little else but a few fond memories he clings to an distorts to achieve what he hopes will make him complete.

The character of Laurie Strode is given more to work with in this film too. She has her demons that haunt her and a metaphysical connection between her and Michael is alluded to, suggesting that perhaps there may be something wrong with that family or there may just be a connection between the two of them. In H1 Michael did care for her when she was a baby and saw her as a pure untainted soul. When he finally go to her in this film he did not mindlessly kill her but rather contemplated her and the gravity of a complete family and what that means.

My complaints with this film are mostly with the Loomis character. He was not the same character from H1 and I did not care for the change. I saw what Zombie was pushing with him as a media shilling for money but felt this aspect of our society could have been toned down a bit and was unnecessary here. There was too much departure to all that talk show stuff that felt out of place and could have been made better with inserted news footage or just less Loomis in general. This was my one complaint. Still I am sure Zombie thought long and hard about all that stuff and to him it was what he wanted. For his efforts and delivering what I feel was a way above par film for a genre that usually produces unwatchable garbage (Saw films) almost every time, I commend him. Zombie has made an honest film and despite the faults it is still a gem in my opinion and worth a few more viewings for sure.",1263340800,5,4608,4.2318181818181815

People are used to Michael Myers being a mindless killing machine, having no motivation but to just kill everyone. Well, while the visions of his mother and himself as a boy are a little wierd, do you expect normal thoughts to be flowing through the head of Michael Myers? I don't, and neither should you. Just take this movie for what it is, a different view of Halloween and the killer himself. Even his sister, angel myers (Laurie Strode), played by Scout Taylor-Compton, has gone crazy and is slipping into a dark world herself. There are also references to the older movies involved, such as the end of the movie where Laurie or Angel seems to be under the influence of Michael, just as Danielle Harris was in the end of Halloween 4. Also, this movie actually packs alot of emotion, you will actually find yourself feeling genuinely sad in certain parts of the movie. Change of pace, but a great movie.

His wife adds a great touch taking Michael through his ravages and keeps him focused on the mission at hand.  Reuniting the family - come here sister!  Great job once again.

3301329,5,B0011G6FDI,"Rob Zombie a master of the horror-genre. Like all masters-of-their-craft, he has perspicaciously developed and tuned his own ""touch"" or panache in creating his art. From H1000C, Devils Rejects, and onto H 1&2, his style has ostensibly matured.

I find it absurd that people are displeased with this film. It seems people expected a re-make which would simply reproduce the original product. However, since this was not his directive in the first rendition, it only follows that the sequel would be even further driven in its own direction (away from the original series). With that, we are given a whole new Michael Myers, and a whole new Halloween. This is not an extension of the overwrought series seminal of early classics; rather, it is a monster of its own. Depicting the greatest figure of horror from a new, modern, and most importantly, Zombie perspective.

Zombie adds, and exposes, new dimensions of the ice cold killer. He approaches the characters with a modern approach. The new, greed driven, and orotund Loomis. The deeply disturbed, haunted, and seemingly telepathically connected to her ""Big Bro""Laurie Straud. Although, this version seems to lack an overt ""Ahab"", I think the Sheriff coupled with Laurie's need to rid herself of her pathogenic hex, can assume this role. Further, the infusion of the ""navigational"" apparitions of Michael's mother and the human remnants of Michael, as a child, are chilling and highly intriguing; which also pays homage to the role of ""mother"" in Friday the 13th.

The movie is great, it is deep and at the same time presents classic Halloween brutality with no remorse.

Zombie deserves the deference of a horror legend, I cannot wait for what he gives us next!",1263340800,3,1714,5.024647887323944

3301331,4,B0011G6FDI,"I went into this movie expecting the worse. I had read the negative reviews and being a long time Halloween fan I was worried this would be another ""Resurrection"" type of failure. But being the Halloween fan I am, I had to check it out regardless. Let me say that on its own it is a pretty decent movie. In my opinion you have to go into it with a blank slate, forget all you remember about the older movies, or this one will frustrate you. I was a little put off by the mask-less, semi-vocal Micheal, and the new actor for young Mike, but it seemed to work for this movie. Parts of this film that I did enjoy were the homage's to the Halloween films of the past. No matter what Rob Zombie has said, the homage's are too apparent to disregard. And Brad Dourif really seemed shine in this one. for me he was the stand out actor of the entire film. Very good job!

Overall I'm satisfied with this film. It's not a remake, not a sequel to the old movies, it's a standalone sequel to the 2007 remake (if that makes sense). I am glad I saw the Directors cut first. I hear its the better version. I will eventually check out the theatrical cut, but I'm satisfied with this version so I'm in no hurry to do so. I don't know that I'm ready for the upcoming H-3d,I think it is too soon for another sequel but I will give it a chance like I did this film.

3301334,4,B0011G6FDI,"I gave this movie 4 stars. I waited to see the movie because I was skeptical of it. I heard it getting trashed, but then I was slightly surprised when I saw it. A total of 2-3 years is suppose to have passed regarding this sequel. What we get is more of Zombie's delving into the human psyche, than an actual remake of the Halloween film. It has plenty of social undertones in it, and if you don't watch with a close eye, and a relative understanding of what's actually being done here then you'll likely won't appreciate the movie, and you'll turn into a mind less critic.

I'm interested in the directors cut because Laurie's healing is supposed to be traded in for a much darker experience. We also find that Michael is living inside his own head, and the results are a mixed bag. Michael believes either his mother is angel from heaven (that explains the white horse) or we get the feeling she is a demon trying to fool him. The mask plays a more relevant role in this film. We tend to find that Michael's identity is that mask. So when you do see him out of that mask he is just blank, devoid of all human emotion, but the identity inside that mask brings forth a monster that even Jason himself could not become. Michael is filled with unbridled rage, and you get a lot of grunting, and a hell of a lot of screaming in one particular scene. I read one review about a face less Michael screaming ""die!"" but that wasn't the same movie I was watching.

Loomis after his egotistical stint of apparently failing Michael has for whatever reason not gotten any better. In fact Loomis doesn't even redeem himself until the end of the movie but unlike some reviewers I am not going to spoil it. What we find here is Loomis has authored a ""Non Fiction"" book where he examines Michael, and instead of admitting his failure he has instead let success go to his head and corrupt his heart. Couple that with Annie's sympathy, and you're instantly at odds with what Loomis has become. This is the kind of tension you look to get lost in.

The end of the movie itself was completely the opposite of what I was going for. And any effort to ignore this in Halloween 3D is just an injustice itself. But I guess time will tell.

Some times people can get caught up in trashing a movie, or feel like their expectations are never going to be met that they can't appreciate something different. Halloween 2:The Theatrical Cut is definitely not for everybody.

3301337,2,B0011G6FDI,"I keep reading how Zombie was suppose to have made this movie from his own thoughts: You know, his version. We all know that this is the case because clearly it is nothing like the original. The first version of Halloween that Zombie did wasn't THAT bad, it was actually pretty nice to see Michael rise up again(for this new generation I mean). What I don't understand is why Zombie didn't just do a REMAKE of the original part II and then for PART III do his own thing. Then there wouldn't be so many expectations for him to follow the original second one; and, in more ways then one, he could have completely wrote the script for it. The Season of the Witch wasn't a bad movie, it just wasn't Myers-y. This was probably due to the fact that John wasn't going to do the Halloween series movies like the Friday the 13th series. He had originally planned on killing Myers off in the second one and the Season of the witch was going to begin a completely spin off and so on. The fan of course. --- Either way. This movie wasn't so bad, but it just wasn't the Myers style. The killings were kind of cliche(though good enough to see). However the fact that the Theme wasn't in the movie and that Michael didn't have his mask for half of the movie is what sort of ticked most people off. Sure. The theme in itself was like an important page to completing the ""picture perfect"" book -- so was the mask(sort of how they completely ruined Freddy's voice in this new remake: which will completely throw people off of the original vibe). I guess you just have to be open for new things.

3301348,2,B0011G6FDI,Other reviewers are right when they say this movie isn't for everyone.  Personally I wish the guy would stop here before he ruins all the 7 classic halloween movies (counting Halloween H20.)  The movie was disgusting with its burn victim operations a miserable replacement for the dead actor that played the original Dr. Lomus.  It missing on the lighter notes like the couple in the hospital hot tub that brought some humor to the original Halloween 2.  I never like the idea of knowing the face behind Micheal's mask.  Just as his first Halloween movie felt like a combo of one and 2 the Halloween raves in this movie has a Curse of Micheal Myers feel to it as well as other elements of the film remind one of Return of Micheal Myers and Revenge of Micheal Myers. Also part of what made Myers character so great in original films is not knowing the man behind the mask never even seeing the pupils in the mask eye sockets. Rob Zombie with his childhood background scenes takes away what made the character mysterious and interesting as a horror movie killer.,1263254400,2,1060,4.587301587301587
3301349,5,B0011G6FDI,all i can say is WOW!! i really loved rob's retelling of the first halloween because for the first time michael myers was given more of a back story than in the original. i wasn't even expecting rob to do a sequel until i saw a trailer for it so i went to see it on the big screen opening day and OMG as gory as the 1st one was this one pushes the envelope even further as to what horror should be. and i agree with everyone else that too many critics disliked this movie and i say if you liked rob's retelling of the 1st halloween then see it for yourself. even though he took halloween II in a different direction than the original sequel he made it work and i personally loved it!!,1263168000,5,684,4.036764705882353
3301350,5,B0011G6FDI,"If you go by the theatrical cut of the movie then its just not good, way better than the first, but falls short nevertheless. I have to say this director's cut is not the same movie released in theatres. In fact its a ten fold better one. Zombie really put on his filmmakers cap on this one and it shows.

Its a shame he didn't get the chance to release his cut of the film, but I sincerely believe once people give this one a shot they will be pleasantly surprised at the depth and feeling this movie has, and I have to say in a morbid way I was quite moved by the finale.

3301368,1,B0011G6FDI,"Contrary to many die hard fans of John Carpenter's original classic, I enjoyed Rob Zombie's 2007 remake of Halloween for what it was.  Being a huge success, a sequel is naturally the next stage of the game, and here we are with Halloween II, which finds Zombie destroying any and all good will that he probably ever had.  Beginning right after the last film, with Laurie Strode (Scout Taylor-Compton) still in shock from her ordeal with Michael Myers (Tyler Mane) in a segment that sort of finds Zombie paying homage to Rick Rosenthal's original Halloween 2, which shockingly enough winds up being a better sequel than this one.  From that point forward, we see Laurie pick up the pieces of her life with fellow survivor Annie (Danielle Harris) and her father the Sheriff (the great Brad Dourif), while Dr. Loomis (Malcolm McDowell) profits off of Michael's rampage and familial link with Laurie with a best-selling tell-all book.  And oh yeah, Michael is still alive (and looking like a homeless Alan Moore) and wreaking all sorts of bloody havoc.  The biggest question that appears to the viewer during watching Halloween II is just what isn't groan worthy?  Is it the dream sequences that feature the dead mother (Sheri Moon Zombie) and young Michael (Chase Vanek) with a white horse in tow?  Is it the pointless, senseless brutality that by this point just seems more boring than anything else?  Or is it Zombie's surprisingly hackneyed script, direction, and shifted characterizations (the take on Dr. Loomis here is lightyears in contrast to the one we saw the last time around, or seen at all for that matter) that ultimately kill Halloween II?  All that and the ultra predictable ending, which we've seen a version of before, all help ruin something that could have been interesting at the least.  All in all, whether you enjoyed or hated Rob Zombie's 2007 remake of Halloween, avoid Halloween II by any and all costs, you'll be glad you did.",1262304000,2,1950,4.846385542168675

And what the hell did rob zombie do? He gave the fans a Halloween 2 with no fear or scares. The only thing that stands out is the violence and I'm not impressed. I'm pissed off that he turned Dr. Loomis into a completely unsympathetic money-hungry character, pissed off that the film offered no scares backed up by a musical score so frighteningly perfect that it became a ringtone. Zombie was quoted as saying Carpenter's music did not fit with what was happening in the film. Carpenter created the film and the music and if it didn't fit into the film, then rob zombie made the wrong movie. Finally, I'm pissed of that he turned Michael Myers into a bearded Paul Bunyan.

In no way would I go in to this movie thinking hospital night revisited - if wanted that I'd watch the original, which is great movie but...so is this totally different reuse of some original characters.

STARRING:  Scout Taylor-Compton, Tyler Mane, Brad Dourif, Malcolm McDowell, Shari Moon Zombie, Danielle Harris, oh yeah and `Weird Al' Yankovic

WRITTEN BY: Rob Zombie

DIRECTED BY: Rob Zombie

Rated: R
Genre: Horror
Release Date: 28 August 2009

Rob Zombie's 2007 remake of Halloween was hands down one of the best horror films of the last decade; then came Halloween II.

The film opens up with another child-actor playing a young Myers back at the asylum with his mother (Sheri Moon Zombie) who brings him his toy horse.  I would love to know why they weren't able to get the same kid from the previous film to reprise his role as Michael. He did a phenomenal job and watching all of the special features, he had an absolute blast with the role. This new kid isn't creepy and is nowhere near the actor the other kid was. I was immediately disappointed by this.  The entire opening was slow and weak.

Things pick up a bit and we're right back where we left off from the first film. All the rest of the original cast is back, thank God. The next 15 minutes or so were done very well; lots of gore, great acting, amazing cinematography; all paying homage to the classic hospital sequence of the original sequel. Good stuff. Michael is kicking butt and not caring to take names.

And then, Laurie Strode (Scout Taylor-Compton) wakes up and the entire sequence was apparently a dream. Wow, we just wasted 15 minutes. Okay, so we go with it and learn that Laurie Strode is no longer the quiet innocent virgin she once was. Apparently she has had some trouble adjusting to the painful memories of the previous Halloween night; transforming her into a dark misfit with ratty hair, grungy clothes and even a token tramp stamp tattoo. It's understandable she'd change but it feels too much like Rob Zombie and not like Halloween.

Then we meet back up with Dr. Loomis (Malcolm McDowell).  My first instinct was to discredit him for his performance but then I found myself realizing that it wasn't his fault; the entire character was changed from the charming hero he was in all of the other films, into an egotistical, self centered butt-head.  Where did this come from? Loomis spends about 95% of his screen time trying to soak up his 15 minutes of fame from his new book. If he's not doing that, he's just being flat out rude to everyone he comes into contact with.  Why was he changed into such a jerk-off?

And oh yes, there's the new and improved Michael Myers (Tyler Mane). Or as I like to call him: Jason Voorhees-Myers, because he's now every bit of a mamma's boy as Jason.  He sees his mother (who killed herself in the previous film), often with a large white horse (I'm guessing the toy horse?) and a younger version of himself, taunting him to kill; as if that's not enough, now he apparently grunts with anger when he slays his victims, which bothered me severely.  We see him eat, we see his eyes way too often and he must be cold because he wears a hoodie for a good portion of the film. Yes that's right, a hoodie.  Zombie has added way too many human elements to Myers, making him dull and not scary at all. Traditionally what has made Myers terrifying, is he looks human but he's simply just not there behind that mask. That is why we go to see him. That is what makes him intriguing and horrifying.

There are also two huge ingredients missing from this film. One is THE SCORE. Where is the brilliant Halloween theme we have all come to love? It never shows up until the end credits start to roll. The movie feels so empty without it. And the second is sex. There are no sex scenes in this film; a few close calls, but no dice. We want to see some sex before we get our blood Mr. Zombie. It's a Halloween film for God's sakes!

With all of that as bad as it was, the third act was the most disappointing of all. I'm not even going to mention it in detail; mainly because I'm so confused by it my head may explode. Why did the sheriff seem to be more concerned for Laurie, than he was for his own daughter? Why did Loomis finally care enough to show up? Were we watching Cops or Halloween II? What was the point of the ending? I'm at a loss for words here.

One good thing about the film was the performance of the Sheriff played by the legendary Brad Dourif. His acting alone earned one whole star for this sad film in my book.

As much as I complained about Zombie's vision here, he is an amazing director. The scenes with the dead mother and the horse were creepy and the last scene of the film reminded me of something out of The Shining. He shows us awesome stylized camera shots and slow motion sequences. There's even a dramatic sad score playing when one of Michael's victims dies slowly; while I can appreciate all of those elements for how well they were filmed, I just don't understand what they are doing in a Halloween film.",1260921600,,4863,4.427130044843049
3301377,2,B0011G6FDI,"Probably one of the dumbest movies ever made.
Despite pretty-good acting, the story is just terrible. The original Halloweens were about nudity, suspense, and killing people in creative ways (ie. having their face shoved in liquid nitrogen then smashed on a table.) The first remake dealt more with Michael Myers' childhood and tried to expand on the original Halloween story. Not bad at all.
Halloween 2 is Rob Zombie's second shot at ""house of a thousand corpses"". Lots of people die, and lots of people say ""Fk"", and lots of ghosts, and visions, and dreams. Oh... and people say ""Fk"".
There are three stories in here:
1) Michael killing people. He kills everyone by stabbing them in the chest or throat, or smashing their head/face into things. Two ways. so... lots of the same thing over and over.
Oh... and people say ""Fk"".
2) The story of the Doctor. In this movie he is a complete self-centered, greedy, show-boating, media hog, trying to sell his book about michael.
3) Jessie Myers (Michael Myers' sister who survived the first film) who is in therapy now, and is all trailer-trash now, and just a waste of screen time with her outbursts, and mood swings.

Do not watch this.
Wolf Creek is 10 times better, and that is a 2 star film.
Even the new remake of Last House on the Left is much better then this trash.",1260921600,5,1320,4.617021276595745

The weird visions/dreams that Laurie Strode receives are very reminiscent of HO1C, it has the gritty look and feel of Devil's Rejects, and it takes the characters from the previous Halloween and instead of retreading the same story again, Zombie puts them into something entirely new and uncharted that was never attempted in the John Carpenter originals. Yes, it's extremely brutal and violent, but, it IS a horror movie, and a Rob Zombie one to boot, so what did you really expect out of it? Zombie said from the get-go that he set out to take the Halloween story and make it his own vision, which is exactly what he's accomplished with his two entries into this franchise. It's not high art, nor does it set out to be. It's a pure escapist, pop-corn genre flick, much in the vein of the exploitation movies that Mr. Zombie was weened on, and I applaud him for making it in such a fashion.",1260144000,5,1071,4.55440414507772

3301396,1,B0011G6FDI,"Rob Zombie manages the seemingly impossible with this sequel - make a movie that is actually worse than his first remake of ""Halloween"".

This is the man who was asked why he included the sister storyline in his first remake since that was a plot twist at the end of the original ""Halloween 2"", and said that he hadn't seen the movie in so long he forgot that wasn't part of the plot - one would think that *watching* the iconic movie you are remaking would be first thing on the list of a competent filmmaker, but not for this guy.

It follows that he never saw any of the subpar sequels to the original ""Halloween 2"", either, and is completely unaware of some of the scenes and bad ideas that had already been introduced to the ""Halloween"" franchise that he included in his ""Halloween 2"":

Escape from a crashed ambulance: Halloween 4

Revelation that a female relative is crazy, too, when she wears his clown costume and stabs someone: Halloween 4

A psychic connection between Michael and the disturbed female relation: Halloween 5

He also continues his trashing of the original characters:

Both Loomis and Laurie are badly-acted and unlikable characters.

The iconic image of the white mask and coveralls has been replaced; Michael's mask is now falling off his face, and there are actually a couple of times when we see him unmasked, and he looks exactly like Rob Zombie - bet that caused some chuckles on the set, huh Rob? And he now wears a hoodie (not making this up, honestly) and is referred to in internet circles as ""Hobo Myers"".

The classic ""Halloween"" music is not used until the very end of the movie, when we hear ""Laurie's theme"" and the classic main title.

And for someone who loved to offer simple-minded criticisms of the original ""Halloween"" (look up online/magazine interviews with Rob Zombie), he sure offers a lot of plot holes himself:

His Michael is human, not supernatural, but he manages to survive several gunshots, an ambulance crash, and can overturn a car with his bare hands.

How does he know where Laurie is staying?

In the first movie he stopped talking after his Mother died, in this one there's a flashback scene of him talking about his dead Mother.

In the first remake, Loomis had his eyes gouged out and was presumably dead. In this one, one year later, he is fine with no signs of injury.

In one interview during his first remake, Zombie made a sarcastic comment that his Michael would ""not be eating any dogs in this one"", but he includes a scene like this in ""Halloween 2"".

And as a hack writer/director with an inflated sense of self-worth because his inner circle dare not offer honest criticism, he offers his attempts to elevate this movie into a higher plane of celluloid existence by including scenes which he must have thought were ""arty"":

A white horse being led by a lady in white (Ghost Mommy Myers) that is the folie a deux of Michael and his sister, Laurie. These scenes are numerous and are laugh-inducing.

Also included are awful scenes that are intended to be funny or offensive, but are neither:

A man in a crashed vehicle saying the ""F"" word dozens of times in different inflections - a scene that defies belief in its awfulness.

A similar scene with Laurie, in a vehicle, saying the ""F"" word over and over again.

This film is ""99% my vision"" claims Rob Zombie, but why the Weinsteins, who are notorious for the control they have over the films they release, gave final cut to this man is a mind-boggling question that only they know the answer to.",1258329600,11,3524,4.615384615384615
3301397,4,B0011G6FDI,"Though I have yet seen Halloween II, but as an owner of Rob Zombie's Halloween (Standard DVD) it amazes me ALL the negative comments an amateur of motion pictures one has to say.  Have you even taken, in your life, a film course?  Or actually just sat back and watched the film for more than just entertainment purposes?  Hell, film critics who make money watching a film even watch the movie NOT for entertainment.  And half of them don't even comprehend what they are watching!  So, next time you're watching a movie, whether or not it is in the privacy of your own home or in a crowded theatre, even if it includes the horror genre, look beyond the film.  The French were the FIRST to consider film a form of art!  Try to understand what the director is saying in his film.  Every motion picture has some message.

It's bye far The worst entry in Any Mainstream Series  EVER

The writing is off the wall.  Maybe u have to be in a Drug Induced state  to follow it and understand what is going on
There are allot of WTF Moments
The Gore/Violence is beyond Unnecessary  (Thanks SAW)

There is no redeeming quality in any of the charters but,  Brad Dourif,  and Danielle Harris
Turning Dr. Loomis into a Monster in the same League of Michael Myers  are u for real?!?!
And That Shocking Ending is Not Shocking
Laurie Strode taking over the Mantal of the killer WOW
That idea seems so Familiar ooohhhh yes Paramount did that with Friday the 13th 20yrs ago

I really like Rob Zombie's 1st two Films (Which he Created and can do anything with ""His""  Characters)

His Vision/Re-make of Halloween was good for what it was
He did allot of Good things  Between the Cast, A New Point of View on a Young Michael Myers

The Halloween Re-Make is Bye far the Best re-make of all The ""NEW"" Horror Films  (FT13, TX Chainsaw Massacre, Next will be the taking of  Nightmare on Elm Street)
Halloween II  Completely does two things
1. Takes away any credibility Rob Zombie may have had as a Hip New Horror Film Director
Take his writer/director's Hat away from his and burn it
2. Put the Nail in the Coffin for the Halloween Series

As a hardcore Halloween fan I found H2 very different from the rest but still disturbingly enjoyable.  It's a psychological horror ride as we try to understand the man behind the mask, Michael Myers, and why he is the way he is.

Don't expect a remake but rather a re-imaginining of the greatest horror icon of all time.  Rob Zombie has done a fantastic job and I have absolutely no complaints from either film, with Halloween 07' being in the top of my favorite films of all time.",1257033600,6,622,4.469026548672566

I loved the concept and the idea for this movie,but it was to much like Friday The 13th,it seemed Rob Zombie has a thing for it looks good on paper,but when it comes to directing he messes up,but it was realistic.

It seems like Sherieff Bracket had the Dr. Loomis role for this movie,and Dr. Loomis was a sellout,Michael's new look i acutally liked because it was fresh,and Laurie Strode was the worst charcter in this movie,Annie Brackett was more of a survivor than Laurie in this movie.

The ending was bad,but they are setting up to make a 3rd one due in 2010

This is ROB'S take on the series, a series that became a real joke after so many horrible sequels. So yeah it needed a HUGE reboot.  Horror has changed throughout the years, and what rob made was his version on current horror. I for one loved the brutality, intensity, and all out craziness and sadness that came with the film. Even Danielle Harris who plays annie loved it and was shocked by the hardcore direction he took.  People complained about the grunting, what do you think a guy with a knife does? yeah he's angry,just got shot in the face by his sister, and he's crazy, and when he attacks you, he's gonna make noise. duh.  He's expressing all that rage. This film had some amazing cinematography, a great score, intense scenes, and was a real horror film that stuck with me and my friends for days. I highly recommend you see it soon, the directors cut is coming with tons more footage with annie and lori along with many other scenes that rob had to cut due to time.  the gore wasn't trimmed, but theres plenty more scenes like the fight with annie n lori that will make the film make more sense.  If your into raw, gritty, non commercial horror, then you will love this shocking film. but like so many hollywood myers fanboys, they simply cannot handle the indie influence zombie brings.  The only bad parts were sherri moon, who i love, but did not fit in this film and the new younger myers, man he was bad. Other than that, brilliant work. A real balls out horror film. Not for the candy coated myers fans. Come on guys, watch some french horror films or something.

More interesting ""character"" scenes with Scout Taylor-Compton a particular stand-out in what would have been an Oscar-nominated performance in a ""Drama"".
Yeah, she's THAT good in this new cut!
There are NO bad performances in this film,though Zombie's wife is...to excuse the pun...""Zombiefied"" and the new ""little Mikey"" is not quite up to Daeg's original.
Rob knows how to direct Horror because he is a ""Horror Fan"" and yes, this film is even MORE violent now...but it's also a genuine ""Creep-fest"" and tragic ""Psychological Study"".
Yes, we COULD have used a little of the classic music (Unrated doesn't have any,) Loomis shouldn't have been such an ass and the friggin' white horse is there because Michael's mother brings him a white toy horse at the beginning.

3301416,1,B0011G6FDI,"All of the other negative reviews are right on the money, but I will add this: one of the best things about Zombie's first Halloween was that it ended with Laurie shooting Michael in the face, blood splattered everywhere, an unexpected twist. End of story! This H2 is totally unnecessary and totally lame. Just a big, elaborate and expensive excuse to show off Sheri Moon Zombie's ass on film once again. It tries to be too dramatic at times, too deep, too abstract, and falls flat. The only thing that made it even remotely enjoyable were the bit parts played by Howard Hessman and Weird Al Yankovic, and the brief playing of Diamonhead's ""Am I Evil?"" which was made famous by Metallica. The killings were routine, the shaky camera work was dizzying (I get that it's done for effect, but we also like to SEE what's happening), hardly any original John Carpenter Halloween score music which would have helped, the performances (especially Dr. Loomis) were annoying, and they couldn't even get the same kid to play young Michael - that was the biggest distraction.

3301417,5,B0011G6FDI,"I walked away from the first viewing of this film with just about everyone else's reaction, WTF? After getting over what I thought the film should be and accepting what it was, I found that I needed a second time around to have an unbiased oppinion of the film.
 I loved this movie, I have found that as much as liked the 07 installment, I have to go with this one as the great denoument that really pushes the violence to the level that Michael needs to be at, unbound and raw, a souless killing machine, a sympathetic monster.
 Granted this movie is chuck full of continuity errors and annoying acting, but I for one came to see Michael do his thing and I got just that. The death scenes were the best I've seen so far, that first nurse's death made me feel both perspectives of a murder from the killer and victim perspective that it set my teeth on edge. Also let's not forget the great look and feel of a Halloween based Haddonfield that has not been topped in any Halloween film before, I'm still searching as to where I can find the giant evil pumpkin king decoration at the party scene.
 I think everyone's major problem with this as was mine at first is that this film is not what you expected from the series, like the original Halloween 3 it is a different film that really sets the essence of Halloween in full.
 One more thing, why the beard? Why the hair in the face in the last film? BECAUSE THESE ARE MASKS TOO! The shot of Tyler Mane's face when the little kid bumps into him on the street is freaking scary, he looks like a stone cold crazy very effectively.
 The bottom line is, see this film. If you didn't like it because it wasn't what you expected, see it again, you might be suprised at what you think about it after leaving your preconceptions at the door.

3301430,1,B0011G6FDI,"First ingredient: An incompetent director/writer who thinks his ""vision"" is original because he never saw any of the subpar sequels.

Second ingredient: been-there, done-that borrowings from said sequels:

1) escape from a crashed ambulance (Halloween 4).
2) psychic connection between Michael and a female family member (Halloween 5).
3) suggestions that said female family member is psychotic, too (Halloween 4).
4) same female family member wearing Michael's clown costume and holding a sharp object to do bodily harm (Halloween 4).

Third ingredient: complete disregard for any of the icons of the series:

1) no classic ""Halloween"" music until the closing credits.
2) Laurie is a badly-acted and very unlikable character.
3) so is Loomis.

Where do I start?

- Myers looked like Frankenstein in a hoody.
- He didn't even wear the mask for more than half of the film.
- Where was Haddenfield in this movie? These films were suppose to take place in a middle class town.
- Everyone was dirty and down right disgusting. What was the deal with the Sheriff's house and the graffiti all over the inside?
- What happen to Laurie and her friends? They went from high school girls to suicide girls.
- Dr Loomis, a complete arrogant jerk who all of the sudden has a change of heart at the end. Wow that was original.
- The Halloween theme was no where to be found.
- Non-stop slow motion.
- Jumping from place to place to kill to kill for no apparent reason.
- Non stop dream sequences, including the first 25 minutes of the movie!  The longest dream sequence in film history.
- Ghosts holding down Laurie?  Yes I said it right, ghosts in a Halloween movie!
- Laurie saying ""I love you brother"" after Michael ruined her life and killed everyone she knew?
- Sweeping shots of Michael walking in fields.

3301435,1,B0011G6FDI,"An opinion not a review. I loved Zombie's 2007 remake, but this sequel is a terrible let down. The best part of the movie is a dream laurie's having. The only time you hear any of the Halloween theme is at the end. For me that doesn't cut it. Zombie is a musician and he can't see the need in using the theme throughout this disaster of a movie?. It might have taken my mind off the fact that his wife isn't one of the greatest actors out there. This ridiculous plot involving her isn't an example of his creative mind at work, it's just a plain stupid way to have her in the whole movie. Thanks a million Rob. This just does not have the ""feel"" that a Halloween film should have. Haddonfield has turned in to a trailer park full of dirty looking characters who I never ended up caring about, especially Loomis. Loomis is the most unlikable character in the entire movie. So much so, that I caught myself wishing he wasn't in it at all. I loved the updated Loomis in 2007 but here I couldn't believe the changes that were made to what should have been an important character. See this for yourself and draw your own conclusion. If your even half a fan of the series you'll see a bad difference between this and a real Halloween film.

Continuity problem: There is a scene in this film where Loomis is at a convention for the book he has writen. Before he takes the stage to answer questions, the convention crowd is seeing a clip of him interviewing young Michael. He says to Him (I can't quote exact)""Your mother won't be coming to visit you any more....""
Michael answers him. In Zombies original Michael had stopped talking before his mother killed her self. So, Zombies not following the continuity he set for himself in the 1st film. All to support a storyline about connection.",1252195200,13,1782,4.416413373860182

With that being said I'm gonna get the ball rolling! This installment honestly left me leaving the theater in AWE! There was nothing funny about this film AT ALL it was just one sick trip into the mind of a madman/woman..(which ever angle you look at it). The kills got next to me (and yes i liked the fact that Michael grunted it made it more brutal)One kill that got next to me was Annie's...off screen, pitch black and nothing but grunts and screams (gives me chills just thinking about it)!Loved the fact that Loomis was an a$$hole..cuz honestly how many times do we see this type of person in everyday life! I like the fact that they opened up Sherriff Bracket's character more...he kinda got Laurie into this mess in the first one; but he didn't hang her ""out to dry"" he stepped in and had her living in his home!  Dealing with all the messed up stuff to follow! And his reaction to his daughter's death was ON POINT (as a parent to have your child escape on helluva night and then have to deal with the fact that you couldn't have protected her enough..sad)As far as the ""dream"" sequences yeah I could have did without 'em but I did realize that Michael still saw himself as a child being that they mimicked each others movements. This film was gritty, dirty, and raw as hell! And for the nay-sayers...I say this: Step back take a deep breath and realize that you put no money into making this film, this film is not YOUR film! Some of the reviews I've read seem to be more ""I'm gonna hate cuz everybody else is"" which is scary because I thought lovers of this genre don't give a F*%^& what everybody else thinks. That's why I'm a fan of Rob Zombie's movie...he doesn't care what you think and will tell you to your face...lol (sounds like me).

He turned Michael Myers from a psychotic killer to a psychotic killer with a wussy little desire to be a happy family.  The stupid-ass visions Michael AND Laurie have of Michael's mother, Michael as a child and a white horse throughout the movie don't belong in the series!!!

Zombie would have been better off making a new franchise with a new killer to compete with the likes of Michael, Jason, Freddy and so on but instead he craps all over an established franchise by adding his own pointless, ""From the mind of Rob Zombie"" supernatural bullcrap!

There was way too much nonsense throughout the film including dreaming, visions and well...need I say more? Who wants to watch a movie full of dreams? Unless its ""Field of Dreams"" Im not watching it!

Now as a big horror fan I was also dissapointed in the fact that Michael was grunting throughout the film making odd noises. Not a big problem but kind of pushes a bit off the path Michael has traveled in the last 30 years...wow...30 years. Congratulations Mr. Carpenter.

The gore, and kill scenes throughout the movie were pretty good, possibly better than the first but the storyline just wasn't there. Anythang to put Rob's (Zombie) wife into the film I guess(she's in all of them!).

Overall a decent movie but I would put it in the same catagory as Halloween 3. Its worth to check out at the movies if you're bored, you may or may not like it depending on your standpoint on horror movies, especially classics.",1252108800,9,1011,4.508196721311475
3301450,1,B0011G6FDI,"Just like with Rob Zombie's 2007 re-make, my mind is racing with thoughts, feelings, and a sense of not exactly knowing what to say. Like many, I was horrified and disgusted when I heard that this classic was being re-made in the first place. Rob's re-make was far from great, littered with flaws and things I didn't like, would never of wanted for Michael Myers or a Halloween movie, but I actually kinda liked it. When the sequel came along, I was hesitant. This wasn't going to be a Halloween movie, but a full on Rob Zombie movie. And that's exactly what we got.

The plot, such as it is, picks up exactly after the last film's final moments. It's these first 15 minutes or so that are the best part of the entire movie. It's also a cheat. We pick up 2 years later and re-connect with Laurie Strode(Scout Taylor-Compton), who is living with the Bracketts(Sheriff and Annie), and is a total, goth, rock and roll chick who is barely hanging on. This is not Laurie from the first film. Meanwhile, Michael is living the hobo life(and looking like it), having artsy fartsy visions of his mother with her white horse, and decides to come looking for Laurie again. Oh, and Dr. Loomis(Malcolm McDowell)is a demanding diva, treated like a rock star, and on a book tour. More on that in a minute.

Where to start?. The problems with the re-make are still very much evident here. The horrendous dialogue, constant swearing(I'm no prude, but the ""F"" word coming out of everyone's mouth every 2 seconds gets old very fast and becomes pathetic), greasy, trashy, hillbilly people, slutty girls, and more of the backstory that tries, along with the visions, to ""humanize"" Michael, which was a huge mistake in the first, and continues that trend here. The movie and the kills are very brutal to the point of being stupid and pointless. Michael just doesn't kill people, he KILLS people. Way, way overdone. Speaking of the kills, they are of the ho-hum, mundane type. Nothing new or creative. Typical, run of the mill stuff that Michael lingers too long on. Some of Laurie's friends didn't have much screen time to get to know them well in the last, and the same is true here, except for Annie. What else?. Dr. Loomis. Malcolm McDowell does a good job, and clearly has fun with the character, but the doctor's characterization here is abominal. This is a Loomis nobody knows, and doesn't want too. Some of his book storyline is interesting, but it all feels disconnected with the rest of the film, and Loomis doesn't even have anything to do with what's going on until the last few minutes. Loomis feels tacked on and serves no real purpose being there. Finally, the visions of his mother and white horse is probably what's going to get a lot of people hating this movie. I really don't care what Michael sees in his head. I don't want to know. I don't want things explained to me. Zombie still doesn't realize that it's the ""unknown"" that makes someone like Michael Myers creepy and scary. It ruins the mystique and creepiness of the whole character. Not knowing who exactly is underneath that mask or why they are doing what they are doing, is what makes it interesting. Tyler Mane is imposing, but he's too big. Michael Myers is not 20 feet tall and built like a mountain. I don't care for the size or crashing thru walls or tossing people around like rag dolls. It's too Jason/Terminator.

Is there anything good?. Not much. McDowell has fun, Scout is okay in some scenes, but it's really the Brackett family that hold things together. Brad Dourif and Danielle Harris, returning as the Sheriff and Annie, are the acting standouts here. It's a movie about family, Laurie and Michael's, but the Brackett family are the acting stars here. I already mentioned the first 15 minutes. The best part of the movie. It's the only time the movie is remotely interesting or suspenseful, and the hospital with it's few Halloween decorations has some good atmosphere and tone. That completely vanishes later on.

I have nothing against Rob Zombie. He seems like a nice, intelligent guy, and he does have an eye for things, but it's just not computing with the Halloween series or the character of Michael Myers. I understand when he says why do it if it's the same thing?. Do something different. Great, but you can't completely change or remove very vital things and details that have come to make these movies what they are and why fans love them and keep coming back to see them. No Halloween music until the end credits!. It was an interesting experiment, Rob, but I am more than ready now for Michael Myers to be back at being the ultimate, shadowy, elusive boogeyman that scared the daylights out of me. Maybe the already announced ""Halloween 3D"" will do that.

Oh, and if you see the Director's Cut, you will bare witness to this Laurie Strode becoming the most annoying, unbearable horror movie heroine I have ever witnessed. You wished Michael finished her off in the opening moments and the heroine of this film was Annie. Just intolerable.

""Halloween II"" is no treat. There could of been an interesting, fun movie here, but it's a bit too weird and still too ""Rob Zombie"".",1252108800,7,5160,4.6586169045005486
3301451,3,B0011G6FDI,"The first time I saw the 2007 remake I was not impressed.  After several viewings, I started to see the Zombie-vision/revision of the classic and it grew on me.  I honestly began to feel more out of it than the original.  So, for the sequel, I was silently amped.
I've seen every Halloween movie at the theater(except the direct-to-video part 6), a tradition in our family  and I can tell you, the worst one I have seen at the theater is still Resurrection, even though part 5 and now this one are not too far behind.
  Atmosphere is something Zombie gets and doesn't get all at the same time.  He nails deep rooted ambience at moments when it is not needed (such as the interesting hospital intro) and then where he should finish us off, he sort of fumbles around (like throwing his wife in to give some meaning behind the massacre).  The shots are usually good, but for this flick, I was severely disappointed.  It did remind me a bit of part 6: the curse of michael myers in it's raw cheesiness.  The shots were too close, too obscure and relied heavily on imagination, which is fine, but if you're going to go all out with a brutal murder scene, give us a look-see, would you? I love the posters for this movie...they have a grainy texture that gives Michael a raw edge.  You don't get that in the film.  The photography on the posters is better than the cinematography of the film and I wish I was exaggerating.
  Dialogue is almost painful and character development is slow and bitter.  Sherriff Bracket is great and Loomis is also good (even though many will hate him in this one...a sign of good acting), as both bring light to true human nature.  I think the actors in Zombie's movies are actually getting bad direction and dialogue, so I can't blame them.
  Michael himself does a great job being the murder-some brother, but he looks awful.  I can sympathize with the idea of him becoming somewhat of a vagabond, but the classic look of the mask is all but gone, turning the 'shape' into the 'bum'.  He looked and acted far better in the first Zombie take on Halloween than this one.  And the kid who plays Michael is different, which is never a good thing in a sequel of any kind.  It shows a lack of budget and integrity. There are some great murder scenes, but due to clumsy editing, you won't see much.  Too bad ALL of the murder scenes were pretty much the same on this one.
  The whole mom and young Michael bit was weird and insubstantial and having ***SPOILER ALERT*** Laurie put on the mask at the end and become the next ""Michael' was a cliche trick we've seen before (end of Halloween 4).  Nice for Rob to give his old lady a part, but it wasn't needed and it hardly carried the movie in any way, or even made for an interesting artsy filler of any kind.  Maybe he just needs to make an entire movie about just his wife and get it out of his system already.  Anyways, the tie-in seems pointless.
  It's a sad movie because the pieces are there and I guess we can all hope when the DVD comes out, it's slightly better.  I wouldn't say it's as awful as some have said, but that's because I'm partial to the series, but it was missing a lot.  Don't expect much and you might be able to appreciate some things in it.  There was a masterpiece to be had here, but the crew seems tired, out of touch and unwilling to fulfill a vision of autumn terror.",1251936000,11,3366,4.342948717948718
3301452,1,B0011G6FDI,"I am a huge Halloween fan and I even thought that the 2007 remake was actually pretty darn good, but this grotesque and boring sequel butchered whatever potential the rebooted franchise started out with.
  The whole movie is absolutely absurd and really doesn't even feel like a real Halloween movie. The characters from the last movie are complelely different and that whole mother Myers thing with the white horse made absolutely no sense. The franchise would have been better off just ending the story with the 2007 remake. Do yourself a favor and avoid this absurd entry into the Halloween franchise. Zombie really screwed this whole thing this time.
  Seriously, what the hell were the Akkad's thinking getting the guy who directed 'House of 1000 corpses' to do the Halloween movies.",1251936000,9,788,4.99236641221374
3301453,1,B0011G6FDI,"Anyone who gives this movie more than 2 out of 5 stars is not being honest with you. I am a huge fan of the Halloween movies and also a big fan of Rob Zombie as a director. The first Halloween remake, in my opinion, was excellent and I was craving more. RZ's Halloween 2 does not deliver...at all...ever. One huge mistake that makes this movie nearly unwatchable is that fact that you will not care about any of the characters....not one. There's nobody to cheer for. Whether you want to believe it or not, that is an important part of any movie. You want to be on somebody's side. I couldn't have cared less about any of the characters, even Laurie Strode! Yawn. Swearing in a film doesn't bother me, but in H2 it is just out of hand, sticks out like a sore thumb, and takes away from the credibility of the film. The acting overall is average at best. Sorry for you fans of the one-dimensional Sheri Moon, but she was just awful and her character in this film is simply annoying. The change to Dr. Loomis' character was really lame, and certainly did not bring out the best in Malcolm McDowell. RZ has made it clear in all of his films that the killings are going to be brutal. Halloween 2 is no exception. You can defintely feel Michael's anger when he decides to off someone. However, the majority of the killings are boring, repetitive, and become predictable. A sure sign of a bad horror film is when the audience laughs at a point where the director wants to establish fear, and the possibility of another sequel. If you watch this abomination, you will know what I'm talking about, as I'm sure your fellow audience members will laugh too. RZ has the potential to be an incredible director, but unfortunately it doesn't show here.",1251849600,12,1737,4.465408805031447
3301454,5,B0011G6FDI,"DO NOT READ THIS REVIEW IF YOU HAVE NOT SEEN THIS MOVIE!!!!!!!!!!

I was a little worried about seeing this movie after reading some of the reviews out there.  I was a huge fan of the first remake and was hoping the sequel was not as bad as many made it out to be.  I must say I was very pleasantly surprised.  I left the movie theatre in awe!

You have to go into this movie with an open mind.  The first remake followed the original John Carpenter movie in many ways.  Many of the characters were the same and it followed a similiar story line adding a much more detailed development into the character of Michael Myers.  I loved that.  The sequel takes a sharp turn and goes into completely unfamiliar terrority.  This opened the door to give a fresh new outlook on the characters.  If you are looking for them to be anything like they were in the original Halloween movies, you will be extremely disappointed with this one.  This is especially true for Dr. Loomis' character.  He does become quite the money hungry, don't care who I hurt, jerk which quite honestly I found to very believable and refreshing.  There are always people out to make a buck from tragedy.  This is nothing new.  This is quite a drastically different character then who Donald Pleasance played, but that is what I liked about it.  I loved how Laurie's character changed as well.  We get a great view into her mental state after her experience from the events in the first movie.  I did not find the dream sequences confusing at all as many reviews have stated.  I felt they were all logical and fit the story line perfectly. We learn that Michael and Laurie have some kind of mental connection when she is eating pizza, and this explains why she later had visions of her biological mother and her brother at the age he was when he first started killing.  We already know that these visons are what was driving Michael to do what he was doing. I was curious how this would work because the whole reason the mother committed suicide was becuase she couldn't live with what Michael had become, so why would she all of a sudden be encouraging her son to kill?  The answer.  It is all in his mind.  When we see the video of Dr Loomis telling Michael his mother is dead, he gets it in his head at that time she will come back and that is how it manifested itself, in his mind.  This is actually one problem I have with the movie.  Michael stopped speaking before his mother died, so why did he speak after hearing about her death?

Some other problems that I had with this movie, but does not change my rating:

Sherriff Brackett seemed more upset at Dr. Loomis for spilling the beans about Laurie's biology then he was about his daughter just dying. One aspect of Michael's character is that he is silent, that should not change.  I did not like the grunting.  In the beginning, when the ambulance crashes, the amount of times the paramedic says f**k was just way too much!  When Laurie told Michael that she loved him, that was just cheesy, however at this point I think she had started to loose her sanity, and who can blame her after what she went through.  Dr Loomis denied the possibility of Michael still being alive without a body being found and blamed that on how the law enforcement handled the situation.  I don't think that kind of wishful thinking is logical at all especially for his character.  He is not a stupid man.

All in all, no movie is perfect, but I commend Rob Zombie for taking the direction he did with this movie. It was bold and unique. I completely enjoyed myself!  I look forward to buying it on DVD.",1251676800,8,3606,4.41060606060606
3301455,3,B0011G6FDI,"Hot on the heels of his 2007 remake of the John Carpenter classic, Rob Zombie has returned to resurrect his version of ""Halloween"" to the big-screen yet again in ""Halloween II."" Picking up where the original left off and re-uniting all surviving characters, you'll be pleasantly surprised to find a leaner and more meaner effort than the first, which is unfortunately still plagued by poor characters and weak story-telling. At the very least, though, you'll find ""Halloween II"" to be more of a ""Halloween"" film than its predecessor, and for some, that will be enough to satisfy their thirst.

To gives this film a few compliments: First off, the mood is unmistakably Halloween in this film. Make no mistakes about it: Rob's second entry in the franchise means business and has the cinematography to back it up. Not since maybe ""Halloween 4"" has the look and feel been nailed so brilliantly. Michael Myers is less of a character and more of a presence in this film when compared to Zombie's first take, and that's one of the other things Rob gets right this time around. While the portrayal of The Shape was pulled off menacingly enough by Tyler Mane in the previous film, a lot of the bite was taken out of the character by over-exposing him and shedding far too much light on a far too troubled past. Here, he is relegated to the shadows, living in the outskirts of Haddonfield and acting as an urban legend to the characters.  When he does appear and strikes -- as he so often does -- it is with maximum impact and brutality. Not only is this Michael Myers more mysterious, but he is also much, much more cruel and punishing than any version we've seen before.

In fact, part of what sets this film apart from any of the original eight films or even Rob's remake is the sheer magnitude of violence that is at hand. Completely opposite from John Carpenter's original version - and even the original ""Halloween II"" - this film is unrelenting and unflinching in its portrayal of Michael's wrath. Granted, it's not the goriest movie you'll find nowadays, and as far as effects go, it's tame compared to the previous film, but the way the violence is handled is in a blunt and all too realistic way. Almost like the exploitation films that Zombie admires so much, this is a film that presents its violence in a stark and ugly light. Michael grunts as he jabs his knife in and out of his victims just as anyone exerting any such force would do, and the results make a more human and, in turn, more frightening incarnation of the character than we have seen in a long while. Unfortunately, though, Michael Myers is the only character in this film that is handled with any care, and in turn, the sheep lined up for his slaughter are a faceless bunch.

Enter Laurie's new group of pals, whom are dispatched before we even get to know them. Then there are the countless people Michael picks off during little intermissions within the narrative. These moments are, for all intents and purposes, filler, and reveal just what a rushed product Rob's sequel really is. Then, of course, we have the return of the surviving characters from the previous film. Danielle Harris ties Jamie Lee Curtis with most appearances in the franchise with her reprisal of Annie, who still lives with her Dad, Sheriff Brackett (Brad Dourif), who has taken the now orphaned Laurie Strode under his wing. While Dourif isn't given much to do in his role, he is given a lot of screen-time and makes the most of it. Unfortunately, however, Scout Taylor-Compton's take on the iconic Laurie Strode is just as flat as it was in the previous film and is not made any more likeable by her angsty performance. Here, instead of being the charming and likeable girl-next-door, she comes across as a self-loathing mallrat who needs a slap in the face and needs to spend less time shopping at Hot Topic. Then, of course, we have Malcolm McDowell as the iconic Dr. Loomis, who serves no purpose in this film other than to pop up in the final act and try to save the day.

Four paragraphs and I feel I've yet to sum up Rob Zombie's ""Halloween II"" in a nutshell. As many things as Rob gets right in his sequel - the atmosphere, the handling of Michael's character - he also gets wrong. To be frank, there's hardly a person here you'll give a coroner's corpse about and the film is still as riddled with bad dialogue and bad acting as the first. These minor grievances wouldn't drag the film down so bad, however, if they weren't punctuated by some unnecessary and ineffective dream sequences/hallucinations, shared by Michael and Laurie. What was meant to be creepy and unsettling on paper turns out to be goofy in the context of the film, and each time one of these scenes pops up, the film comes to a screeching halt. Nothing sticks out like a sore thumb more than the satisfying and chilling final frames that are tainted by yet another wacky hallucination. Truth be told, this film has one of the most unsettling endings of the entire franchise, and for a moment, Rob nails the tone. Almost. But then, we see his wife and we see the white horse and we are instantly taken out of the mood again. Such is the curse of Rob Zombie's limited story-telling ability, and therefore goes a long way to sum up what is both good and great about ""Halloween II."" For a moment, he almost had us.",1251590400,5,5337,4.578451882845188
