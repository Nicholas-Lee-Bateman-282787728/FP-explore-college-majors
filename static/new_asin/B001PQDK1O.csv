My mother loved this movie and got me hooked on it. Every time I view it, I think of her fondly. It is very entertaining.  Nice to see the indoctrination of the maid into France. Portrayed the accomodations authentically. Movie takes us away from our daily lives and transports us to France as he moves into a new life, job and finds love. Very entertaining as to how he wins the little girl over.
I would recommend this highly as a family movie, hard to find these days.
