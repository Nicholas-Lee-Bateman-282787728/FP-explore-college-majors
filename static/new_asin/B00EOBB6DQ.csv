The series portrays the most wonderful stories about situations which occur in our lives and how we are affected by them . The idea of the angels  actually being in the series help us on how to view and deal with certain tragedies or difficult occurrences in life especially unexpected ones. The cast selected in this series possess a beauty, charm and understanding making them the perfect angels. Love it!!! I would recommend this series to all who love a beautiful story with a sad touch but leave you feeling that in life all is not lost and everything happens for a reason.

5929805,5,B00EOBB6DQ,"I became dissatisfied with TV fifteen or twenty years ago when prime-time viewing began featuring unfunny sitcoms, unreal reality shows and melodramatic dramas. At about that time they started producing DVDs of some old shows, so I decided to collect the best of them to watch anytime.
 So far Ive bought DVDs of forty shows. Ive found some fine shows, such as Matlock and Trapper John, which I missed the first time around. And I have been disappointed by shows such as The Greatest American Hero and The A Team, which I once enjoyed.
No issues with Little House on the Prairie or Touched by an Angel, however. After watching many reruns of the great shows, I now consider these two to be the greatest.
Martha Williamson was superb at writing, directing and producing shows that truly were touching. Lovely angel Monica (Roma Downey) did a terrific job of reaching out to people in need of a special touch from God. So did death angel Andrew (John Dye) and angel-in-charge Tess (Della Reese), whose singing voice was a bit too strident for my taste.
Valerie Bertinelli joined the angelic brigade for the final two seasons, and youll recognize some guest angels, including Bill Cosby.
A great, great show!
Here are the ten shows I watch most often in a delightful fare of prime-time DVD viewing: 1. Little House on the Prairie; 2. Touched by an Angel; 3. The Closer; 4. Lois & Clark: The New Adventures of Superman; 5. Bonanza; 6. Hawaii Five-0 (the original show with Jack Lord); 7. The Dick Van Dyke Show; 8. Highway to Heaven; 9. Wings; 10. Jackie Gleasons Honeymooners. This list features at least one show from every era of TV.",1384905600,38,1632,4.686411149825784

But one cannot watch this series without realizing which God is referred to (He is called I AM in the show), and that, of course, He is the God of the religion which has Jesus as God.

5929822,5,B00EOBB6DQ,"""Touched by an Angel"" is perhaps my all-time favorite television series, and I'm grateful to own this entire collection of episodes.

The scenery in each episode is stunning and beautiful.  I've always appreciated how the beauty of nature is highlighted at the beginning and ending of each episode.  (I believe that many of the episodes were filmed in Utah, which inspires me to want to travel there someday).

The characters are both likeable and believable.  As each of us may struggle to become a better person, there are also episodes (such as ""Until Death Do Us Part"" in Season 6), where we find the angels likewise struggling to be better, more holy, beings.  The late John Dye was such a great actor in this series, and his role in that episode was especially good.

Most importantly, the message of each episode is always inspiring and uplifting!  Jesus Christ provided us with such commandments as ""Love your neighbor as yourself"", and this series provides 211 episodes where that happens.  Hope is a wonderful gift from God and, with over 200 episodes, hope is something that each of us can enjoy and appreciate over and over again.

In my opinion, this series deserves 5 stars.  No argument at all.  If I could suggest one improvement, it would be to include a (paper) guide which outlines each of the 211 episodes, with a brief summary of each.  I suppose it could be called something like ""Your guide to the Angels"".  :)  Regardless, it would be helpful to have a short reference booklet to accompany this incredible series.",1522454400,2,1537,4.768939393939394

5929831,5,B00EOBB6DQ,"When I was a child, my parents watched Touched by an Angel during it's seventh, eighth and ninth seasons. Eleven years later, I saw the 2014 film Son of God and said ""Who is that woman playing Mary?"" So I looked up Roma Downey's film credits and all those episodes I hadn't given thought to for so long came back to me as if I had seen them only yesterday--the tornado, the tarot cards, the ark of the covenant, the bus crash, the showdown with Andrew and Gloria in the synagogue with the skinheads, the little boy who hides his sister in the basement from their abusive father, etc.--when you're young, your mind is very impressionable.

Since then, I have taken to re-watching the show and I appreciate it much more as an adult, now that I have a deeper understanding of my faith and the realistic situations depicted. I haven't seen the show in its entirety but I have covered Seasons 3 and 7 and large chunks of 1, 2 and 8--enough to pronounce a well-informed opinion.

Before I discuss my reservations, I want to make something clear. I love this show. I love it way down to the bottom of my heart. It's one of my all-time favorites.

It does a great job illustrating the concept of a spiritual battle, (The Invitation, In the Name of God, The Netherlands and the Kathleen episodes) tackling some controversial issues without getting politically correct, (The Violin Lesson, The Empty Chair, A Death in the Family) emphasizing the concept of free will (that this is why bad things happen, not because God doesn't care but because he wants us to love and obey him out of the goodness of our hearts) and developing the three main characters in that even though they are angels, they have their faults and struggles to work through too. (Sign of the Dove, The Netherlands and In the Name of God.) There was even an episode about an actor who stars in a show about angels I am an Angel which served as a statement that the producers held themselves accountable for the messages they presented. It would indeed be heartless to ignore all the high points this show has going for it.

However, there are a few things I wish were different to make the show a little more realistic and theologically sound.

 1. (And I know I'm not alone on this one.) Mention of Jesus Christ. For a show that is supposedly Christian-based, it lacked any mention of the principle character. I don't know why Martha Williamson (producer) did this but for her to profess to be a Christian and then leave out mention of Jesus simply defies the senses. Yes, there were a few references, like when a little boy reads the Christmas story in ""The Violin Lesson"" and the baptismal scene in ""Shallow Water"" but they were quick and vague and the show didn't dwell on them. This is a major theological problem because the only way to the Father is through the Son. Jesus shouldn't have just been alluded to once in a while; he should have been mentioned ALL THE TIME.

2. Monica should have been a much younger angel than Tess and Andrew. In the beginning, she comes across as naive, innocent and inexperienced which is appropriate since she is Tess' student. But then there are some episodes (An Angel on my Tree, Fallen Angela, Netherlands) where she says she's been around since the first Christmas, the Flood and the Great Rebellion. This didn't make sense because if she were that old, she'd be an 'older wiser angel' like Tess. I would have made her character much younger at the beginning, or even a newly created angel like Gloria when we first see her in ""The Face of God."" That way, when Gloria shows up and Tess tells Monica she has a student of her own to look after, now that she has some experience under her belt, the character development would feel more believable.

3. Failure endings. There should have been some episodes where the people prove to be too much for the angels and they have to stop bothering them and let the chips fall. In Season 7, there is an episode called ""Legacy"" where Monica saves a girl from being gang raped. She grabs one of the men and says ""God is watching you and you are breaking his heart."" But he chooses to continue down the path of darkness and even encourages his son to join the gang as well. So Monica warns the boy of his father's mistake and encourages him to stand up for whats right. I give the show credit for pointing out how some hearts are so hardened, not even a supernatural experience would make them change but I think there should have been more episodes like this to emphasize it.

4. People dying and ending up lost. They do mention Hell once in a while as the place where the unrepentant go after death (The Birthday Present, The Sins of the Father and Into the Light) but just as there were episodes of Andrew escorting the saved souls through a door filled with light there should have been some episodes of demons showing up, dragging the lost souls into a door filled with darkness, smoke and flames. This would have served as a warning to the audience that while God loves everyone, he is also just. The day of salvation is now and no one has a promise of tomorrow.

(Update from June 11th, 2018: Im fishing through Season 5 right now and Beautiful Dreamer and Into the Fire are a couple exceptions but if youve never seen them youd think the show never approached the topic.)

5. The angels always reveal themselves. God doesn't work that way. He wants us to live by faith rather than sight. With all the episodes of the angels glowing in the climaxes, it feels like the people are living in the Bible times instead of 21st century America. If Monica, Tess and Andrew kept their identities secret and only revealed themselves once in a while, it would have been more realistic and made the show less redundant.

Make no mistake. I still love this show and if I didn't love it, I wouldn't have taken so much time to criticize it! It has a lot of redeeming values and does an outstanding job showing how God loves us and wants to be part of our lives. I just wish it were a little clearer on some things to emphasize its Christian worldview. I admire it greatly for what it does but am mindful at the same time of what it doesn't do. Despite my reservations, it is still a classic--with class.",1519516800,,6237,4.475813544415128

5929865,5,B00EOBB6DQ,"""Touched By An Angel"" is the one of the most well -written television dramas of all time. The stories are well written and developed without depending on formulaic emotion manipulation in modern series. There is enough diversity in the stories so that the viewer does not get bored with the series after the first few seasons. The characters are delightful with angelic-like qualities that are very convincing. I never saw Roma Dowey, Della Reese, or John Dye, but I saw Monica, Tess, and Andrew. This show is very uplifting without being saccharine. There are not always happy endings but twists and turns in the plots just like real life.

The only thing I might add is that I would have liked to have had descriptions of each episode like they do when you buy a single season of episodes like Season 1 separately. Also you have to be careful with these cases, because there's several discs in one of each of the three cases. The good thing about this is that they're all together and you don't have to go hunting for the individual seasons. A single season of episodes can cost $10 more. I bought this collection of 9 seasons for about $91 and that included the tax. You might be able to find them for a little less.",1476662400,8,674,4.31496062992126

I know of many who have become Christians and have walked totally out of that lifestyle with God's constant help and the support of Loving Christians who vow to Love them Unconditionally.  That is so very important for all of us to see, hear & know. Especially in this world and Nation today.

5929921,5,B00EOBB6DQ,"Thank you BH Impact for sending us this DVD set to review!

Touched by an Angel began in 1994 and was almost cancelled after its first season. However, it was brought back for eight more seasons after the fans of the show wrote enough letters to change CBS mind.  During seasons three through six, Touched by an Angel was one of CBS highest rated series.  While it was nominated several times for the Golden Globe Awards it never won them.  It did however win multiple Outstanding Drama Series awards, and rightfully so!

The series begins with a couple of angels named Tess and Monica.  Tess is Monicas supervisor and Monica is a newly promoted case worker who lends a helping hand to people in dire situations.  The show doesnt pull any punches with the topics it discusses.  There are shows about alcoholism, drug addiction, AIDS, cancer, teen pregnancy, racism, homosexuality, and thats just within the first couple of seasons!  While many of the shows are kid safe, some of them have serious themes and minor language that may not be suitable for young children.  I am happy to report that intimate relationships are eluded to and not explicitly shown.

I also like how this show displays God's love and even though we may be going through tough times, God never abandons us.  It also makes it clear that tough times are not necessarily a punishment and our mistakes still have consequences despite repenting and being forgiven for them.  The angels are not depicted as being perfect either; both Tess and Monica let their pride and emotions get to them and they get set back on track and confess their sins and make amends.  Andrew (from season two on), the angel of death, often appears in the show as well.  His appearance doesn't always mean that someone is going to die, but it's usually the case.

Throughout the nine seasons and fifty-nine DVDs in this set there are numerous guest appearances from many popular celebrities including Bill Cosby, Celine Dion, Montel Williams, Randy Travis, and Wynonna Judd.  I also like how the shows finale has guest characters from the first season reprising their roles and bringing closure to this inspiring series.

Despite the low picture quality of the first couple of seasons, the stories are timeless.  Widescreen format is not available until the final season!  The musical talents of Della Reese (Tess) and other guests is a pleasure to listen to and the writing is excellent.  Some of the episodes will bring tears to your eyes so keep some Kleenex handy!

The complete series retails for $145 but is available for less than $90 on Amazon.  Thats a great price for over one hundred and sixty-five hours of inspiring entertainment.",1460419200,4,2688,4.808278867102397
5929922,5,B00EOBB6DQ,"I decided to review this rather than each individual season, since I own almost the entire series. I found Touched by an Angel during college and was immediately impressed. The show is clean and in line with my values--God exists and loves us all, and God wants us to turn to Him and love our neighbors as ourselves. However, cleanliness does not mean characters and plots get scrimped on. Being a TV series, the episode formats are somewhat formulaic, but there's always some twist and relatable characters.

The angels themselves are a real pleasure to watch, especially Monica, a new caseworker played by the illustrious Roma Downey. She, Della Reese, and John Dye have perfect chemistry as the main cast. Their message is delivered with such sincerity that for awhile, every episode of the show made me cry. Also, each one has a unique personality that works well when dealing with human assignments. Monica, for instance, is the spirited yet compassionate one. Tess, as the no-nonsense mentor/supervisor, is nevertheless tender and loving. Andrew acts as the levelheaded one, yet as the Angel of Death, is arguably most in tune with the supernatural aspects of his ""career."" Gloria, who is added into the mix later, brings a needed logical, yet innocent vibe.

Rather than go over everything I love about the show's plots, I'm going to list a few favorite episodes I think viewers should try, my personal top 10.

1. In The Name of God (Season 1)--Tess and Monica confront a hate group, and take down Satan, while helping a Jewish doctor build an AIDS hospice.
2. Sympathy for the Devil (Season 2)--Monica helps a businessman forgive his abusive father and end generations of anger, while dealing with fallen angel and former friend Kathleen.
3. A Joyful Noise (Season 3)--Monica and Tess reach out to a child psychologist who's treating Melissa, a seven-year-old girl who can hear the angel choir.
4. A tie between How Do You Spell Faith and Elijah from Season 4. In the first, the angels assist a young boy named Aaron who is socially awkward but gifted in spelling and academics. In the second, their assignment is a Brooklyn slum lord who must confront his greed and avarice to save his son.
5. Fool for Love (Season 5)--The angels assist Sarah, a young lawyer who married an abusive deadbeat at 17 and had to abandon her baby girl to keep her from being sold to a ""baby broker.""
6. Life Before Death (Season 6)--In one of my favorite episodes, Monica returns to Ireland with Tess and Andrew to help Catholic and Protestant teens on a peacekeeping project at the end of The Troubles era.
7. A three-way tie between Band of Angels, God Bless the Child, and An Angel on my Tree from Season 7. In the first, the angels help a juvenile offender sentenced to prison for killing his mentor; Christian band Plus One is featured. The second concerns Charnelle, a young black teen who is headed for a drug overdose and who Monica tells the story of Billie Holliday. The third, a Christmas episode, features the angels assisting a family with a dad in prison; the oldest son has Tourette's Syndrome.
8. Chutzpah--The angels assist a Torah scribe and his daughter, who takes out old rage at her dad by drawing gradually anti-Semitic comics.
9. Virtual Reality (Season 9)--The angels help two boys whose addiction to a violent video game led to the serious injury of a classmate.
10. Bonus: The Spirit of Liberty Moon, a two-parter dealing with the persecution of Chinese dissidents.

I'm going to try to find a sound bar or speaker that will amplify the sound so I can hear it. If that doesn't work, I will return the set. I wish the set had closed captioning. The series by far is excellent, but if I cannot hear it or understand the words that I do here, it's not worth much. I have a substantial DVD library that I can hear well enough to enjoy. Right now, I cannot recommend this set  it to anyone. I will give it more stars with the caveat if I can find a device that lets me.

Update: I did return this set. However, I bought the series as a packet and the sound quality was better than the box set. Then I bought a Polk sound bar with base that allowed me to increase just the voice volume and I am really enjoying the DVD's now. It's been a long time since I've enjoyed TV without closed captioning. I mention the Polk sound bar because it had 3 volume controls:  volume/voice/base. That feature really works.

Its relevance to our world today, from dealing w/abortion, adultery, stepfamilies, suicide & many other problems facing regular, ordinary people like you & me is handled in a delicate but strong way as the angels, Tess, Monica & Andrew are so likable & down to earth.  They turn to God for help whenever they face a difficult task.

I really long to be able to purchase the entire series one day when I can afford it.  It would be delightful to be able to watch any show I'd like to enjoy.... as nowadays there are about 2 programs that are even worth watching on any of the networks.  Common, vulgar & disturbing ""comedies"" are anything but  & reality shows push people to do anything & everything against their fellow competitor, showing lack of compassion & greed.

(Della Reese)  is  Tess  the  leader  of  the  3  &  Monica's  superior.  Monica's  (Roma Downey) job  is  to  try  to  help  them  with  their  frustrations.  It  often  takes  time  for  the  message  to  get  across.  Her  advice  is  good. &  even  if  the  situation  is  pretty  painful  for  the  ones  they're  working  with  its  their  job  to  reason  with  them  &  set  their  thinking  straight  &  find  their  positive  side.  Near  the  end  of  the  show  light  shines  on  Monica  &  she  tells  them  that  she's  an  angel  sent  by  God.  In  my  opinion  Monica  is  good  at  being  sincere. She  knows  how  to  get  through  to  them  even  if  she  has  to  shed  tears  to  do  it. In  some  episodes  the  people  they're  helping  have  got  a  gift  or  something,  something  that  they're  good  at  that  they're  about  to  give  up  on  &  eventually  when  the  right  things  are  said  they  realize  they  can  continue  with  what  their  goals  are.  &  see  how  important  trust  &  faith  is!  &  although  I  can  understand  them  not  wanting  to  listen  when  they're  not  in  the  mood,  listen  to  Monica, Tess,& Andrew,  its  necessary  that  they  find  the  answers  to their  problem.  Angels  may  tell  us  stuff  we  don't  want  to  hear.  Maybe  they  want  to  ignore  the  situation.  But  its  vital  that  they  hear  them  out!  What  they  say  to  people  isn't  just  suggestions  or  advice,  but  what  they  must  hear  that  will  help  resolve  their  matter.  Most  importantly  helping  them  get  through  their  tough  times  so  they  can  move  forward.
Finally  they  stop  to  pray  after  Monica's  final  talk  to  them.  God  stands  by  them  through  thick  &  thin  no  matter  how  tough  the  situation  is  that  they're  going  through.
Touched  by  an  angel  is  a  good  show,  worth  watching,  &  to  teach  children  about  God,  there  is  no  vulgar  language  in  any  of  the  episodes  on  this  show,  that's  what  I  like  about  it. Its  the  kind  of  show  that  will  make  you  stop  &  think, &  make  you  feel  good  all  over  again.  I've  never  complained  about  any  of  the  episodes  I've  seen. I  like  this  show, there  are  quite  a  few  good  tips.  I'm  overwhelmed  over  how  they  change  right  &  wrong,  dealing  with  them  &  their  negative  behavior.  &  easing  their  stress, pain, &  sorrow. At  the  end  of  the  show  everybody's  smiling. Even  us  viewers! In  the  end  you  kind  of  just  want  to  pat  them  on  the  back  for  helping  you. If  I  had  to  stand  in  front  of  Tess, Monica, & Andrew  I'd  compliment  them  for  sure. I  use  to  watch  this  show  quite  often. &  its  a  show  I  don't  think  I  could  ever  put  down!  If  you  don't  like  going  to  church  I  highly  recommend  checking  this  show  out!
This  is  truly  a  not  miss  show!!  &  I  have  to  give  it  2  thumbs  up.  There'll  never  be  another  show  like  this,  &  it  is  positively  absolutely  one  of  the  best  shows  I've  ever  found  &  seen  on  the  (Hallmark)  &  Family  channels!
About  the  white  Dove.  He  or  she  is  satisfied  with  the  progress.  &  gives  the  show  a  finishing  touch.  I  almost  wish  to  ask  the  dove  how  it  feels  about  the  end  of  each  episode.  &  I  kind  of  wonder  what  it  would  say!  Anyone  who  watches  this  show  should  or  may  grow  fond  of  the  dove.",1442620800,5,3898,4.203470031545741

5929969,5,B00EOBB6DQ,"This family friendly series was on TV Sunday nights from 1994 to 2003.  Without a doubt, this series provides wholesome entertainment about life (and death).  Our older children grew up watching this series and learning powerful lessons about right and wrong.  We just purchased the series so that our 7 year old daughter can also appreciate all that is involved in making the right decisions as she starts to get older.  Unlike the majority of ""Family""  shows on TV today, ""Angel"" is a program that everyone in the family can enjoy.
When our daughter was a toddler, we watched the ""Full House"" complete series.  In that series, she followed the 3 daughters growing up and interacting  with each other.  After that series was finished, we purchased all 11 seasons of ""Seventh Heaven"" that followed the Camden family with 7 children. The father was a minister at a local church. The program dealt with all the social issues of the day (drug usage, teen pregnancy, discrimination, etc.) and their effect on the family.",1421712000,5,1016,4.866279069767442
