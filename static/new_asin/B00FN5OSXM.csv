8617112,5,B00FN5OSXM,"I had great fun working with Michael Thomas Roe on this one.  I sent him five dozen self-contained fractal deep zooms asking that he pick out the best ones for a short video.  Michael them set about to creating a custom score for each of them.  I first started working with Micheal at a small bar called Kavarna.  It once had a monthly showcase where electronic musicians could perform live on-stage and have their music streamed out over the internet.  I had been asked to provide the background visuals.  It was cool to see the devotion, gear being used, and to have a chance to learn from other artists what their inspiration was and how they got their start in performing.  To really get the most out of this DVD you'll probably want to buy a pair of ChromaDepth 3D glasses from American Paper Optics (who manufacture them).  With them you'll be able to see warm colors (red, orange, yellow) float off the monitor or TV set.  Green serves as a neutral middle ground color.  While Blue, Indigo, and Violet are the cool colors which appear to sink into not just the background, but the video display itself.  Increase your viewing distance and you just might find yourself trying to touch, poke, scoop, grab, or otherwise manipulate the optical illusions these wonderful 3D glasses present.

One thing though...Please buy this DVD from Amazon.  They make each disc on-demand and handle all the sales and shipping.  Plus Michael gets a royalty for every disc that is sold here.  I bring it up because there are some scammers trying to sell my work as bootlegs for extremely high prices.  I no longer pay a licensing fee to use ""all fract up"", nor do I operate my old web site of the same name either.  If you are doing business with that site please be careful.",1488758400,,1762,4.578274760383387
