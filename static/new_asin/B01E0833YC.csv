7728474,1,B01E0833YC,I love Melissa. She is everything. But this movie is horrible. I was so bored. I never laughed. I think her movie Tammy was better. This was just bad.,1461888000,2,150,4.206896551724138
7728475,4,B01E0833YC,"This movie is about this kid that grows up in in an orphanage. The people that take her home keep dumping poor her back on the sister in charge. Well, she gets an attitude and says f the world she's going to be a superstar. Michelle becomes megarich and puts on eloborate motivational events. One big problem though, she uses illegal tactics at one point. This dwarf she used to sleep with and dumped finds out and decides to destroy her and her empire. He's still very bitter about this. Anyways, she does her time and winds up living with her previous assistant and her smart a daughter. The daughter is some type of brownie or scout or something like that. Michelle goes to a meeting with her and gets real nasty with one of the other girl's mom's. The scouts plan to sell sweets to make money, and Michelle decides to use her business senses to help them. Well, the girl's are alright with this as they are pretty devious too. Here comes the dwarf back, he's still very upset!",1461715200,7,980,4.419889502762431
7728476,4,B01E0833YC,"Michelle Darnell (Melissa McCarthy) who never knew family becomes a major CEO who possess the worst qualities of Suze Orman and Donald Trump combined. As art imitates life, she does a stint in prison for insider trading and loses her empire, forced to start over. Being not liked by everyone, (Be nice to people on the way up...) she finds a home with a former employee (Kristen Bell) who makes great brownies. Renault (Peter Dinklage) is a former vindictive lover who has it in for her.

The theme of the film is about friends as families, as Michelle undergoes a transformation. The film is cliche and hack in writing, although funny in some parts thanks to the delivery ability of Melissa McCarthy. Many scenes simply didn't work that could have worked such as the brownie melee, the martial arts fight, and the boob check scene that lasted pointlessly too long.

This is not as good as ""Spy"" and certainly not as good as ""The Heat,"" but better than ""Tammy.""

7728478,3,B01E0833YC,"The Boss
 In terms of physical comedy Melissa McCarthy can really bring it on.  She does however have to have something to work with.  ""The Boss"" might well drive the stake into the heart of poorly thought out Melissa McCarthy movies and finally kill the beast.  One might hope.
 We have often decried the studio films put together by bean counters.  The trope is that some soulless studio number cruncher put a film together from unrelated parts.  Get a famous star, bring out a proven writer, hire a competent director and so on, throw the bits in a bag, shake and serve.  Here the same process seems to be in play.  The difference here is that the husband-wife team of Melissa McCarthy and Ben Falcone serve in all the parts.  Falcone directs from a script penned by Falcone and McCarthy.  Steve Mallory, an actor, also helps with the writing in his first shot a script writing.  And to no one's surprise, Ben Falcone and Melissa McCarthy are among the producers.  McCarthy of course stars with the usual in her films cameo by Falcone.  It is entirely their film.  They took some funny bits, some dirty bits and some bits that didn't work at all, tossed them in a bag and served them up to a public hungry for their sad star, Melissa McCarthy.  What a terrible shame.
 We have Michelle Darnell (""The Boss"", McCarthy), a self made, hyper aggressive multimillionaire giving motivational speeches to packed auditoriums full of adoring acolytes, eager to know how to go and do likewise.  In the back story we discover that Darnell came from a loveless childhood, raised by nuns after a series of unsuccessful adoptions.  She relies upon no one but she cares for no one either.  You can see how this makes for a character who the audience has a hard time feeling symphony for.  At her best, she is not a person that we want to spend time with.
 But after spending time in the poky for insider trading and losing her vast wealth, she remains someone we do not want to spend time with.  She imposes herself upon the only person she can, her former assistant (Kristen Bell) and her daughter.  There follows a screwball scheme to take over the commercial space occupied by Girl Scout cookies and there by regain her fortune.  What follows is a combination of bombast and schmaltz which is nether believable nor admirable.  Throw in some of the worst anti-woman comments imaginable (and from McCarthy's mouth to boot) and you have the flavor of the film.  This could have been and should have been a show case for the very best efforts of a competent actress.
 Kristen Bell can and has done excellent work but here she is not expected to do more than recite her lines.  Peter Dinklage throws himself into a very strange character, the ex-lover of ""The Boss"", a guy who still carries the torch for her even after getting her thrown in jail.  Kathy Bates has a small role as Michelle Darnell's former mentor.  Ben Falcone appears in an even smaller role.  Bates in a few brief moments on screen shows how much she has to offer as an actress, but to no avail.
I want to be generous and give ""The Boss"" an average three saw blades but I just can't do it.  There is too much wrong with this unambitious two saw blade not so funny comedy.  It is ""R"" rated however for smarmy rather than funny sexual discussions and bad language.  It runs for one hour and 39 minutes.  On a generous $29 million budget it returned $25 million at the three day week end box office.  That put this unworthy film in the number one spot by a whisker.  If producers McCarthy and Falcone make money on this one we will get more of the same.  Pity that.",1461024000,5,3616,4.504615384615384
7728479,5,B01E0833YC,"Best, funniest movie ever seen so far this year. Great movie!!",1460764800,,62,4.7272727272727275
7728480,3,B01E0833YC,"I have never been a fan of insult humor. Clearly I am out of step or Don Rickles would NEVER have had such a successful career; furthermore, many in our screening audience laughed all the way through, including the rude fellow who sat next to me! So there is still an audience out there who wants to see one character verbally (and physically!) trash another.

Having said that, remember Martha Stewart's little stretch in the clink? It's obvious that writer/director Ben Falcone (""Tammy"") and his screen-writing collaborators Steve Mallory and Melissa McCarthy (Ben's wife) were inspired by this real-life situation. Of course being comedy writers, they not only ran with it, they took it over the top...waaaay over the top....

Here is part of the cast:
  * Melissa McCarthy (""Identity Thief"") is Michelle Darnell, the doyenne of the business world, ready to come back with a vengeance, now that she's paid her debt to society. Problem is, nobody likes her.
  * Kristen Bell (""Frozen"") Claire's first responsibility (after getting a new bra) will be to help her former boss get back on her feet. Those brownies might help...
  * Peter Dinklage (""Game of Thrones"") Renault can see Michelle will never change. His desire to humiliate and destroy her is not business...it's personal.
  * Kristen Schaal (""A Walk in the Woods"") Sandy will never regain control of her Dandelion troop, no matter how hard she tries.
  * Kathy Bates (""American Horror Story"") Ida knows a good thing when she sees it. I just wish there had been more screen time for her, and I wish I knew if my suspicions were right about Little Orphan Michelle.

This is a McCarthy/Falcone collaboration so expect it to be an outrageous, R-rated romp. Brace yourself for extremely vile language, slapstick humor, and realize that if a situation is funny, Ben and Melissa will milk it and milk it and milk it until it loses its punch. At least to me.

Both of these people are talented and funny, I just wish they had a trusted friend who could rein them in. Melissa McCarthy's screen presence is hot right now; I don't want to see her burn out.

Side note: I'm still bummed about Martha Stewart serving time for her penny-ante insider trading. Half of Wall Street deserves to be locked up RIGHT NOW for their egregious crimes which crippled the world economy! Aarghhh!",1460764800,,2330,4.804511278195489

She plays an orphan who grows rich as a flashy con-artist who is brought low and imprisoned for insider trading by one of her ex-boyfriends.

7728489,4,B01E0833YC,"What I liked most about the movie was being an extra and part of its filming!  If you don't blink, and are good at finding Waldo in those books, then there's a 10% chance you will find me in the audience during the opening convention scene.  While the 13 hour day, which included a tornado warning, only lasted a brief second in the final movie, getting to ""work"" with Ben Falcone, T-Pain, David Banner and others as Melissa McCarthy ""flew"" down from the ceiling on a golden phoenix was worth it.

I'm a big Melissa McCarthy fan, but I'll admit this wasn't one of her best films.  It has some of the sarcastic, crass humor that Melissa is better known for, but they are downplayed due to the storyline revolving around a Girl-Scout-like cookie business.  That being said, there are still plenty of faux pas and belly laughs throughout.  The movie is a good choice when you're looking for something to watch on a lazy weekend.  Just don't rent it expecting an Oscar winner that's going to change your life.

It's really too bad that Melissa McCarthy who IS a highly talented Actress alongside Kristen Bell, (another talented actress, who also needs some way better scripts sent her way) participated in such a corny and ridiculously stupid movie.
As a former Girl Scout, I personally was offended by the tearing down of such a fine value and character building establishment that really gives girls a chance to learn so MANY useful life skills, and I had all the badges to prove it. Not once, did anyone in my troop have to do a bunch of ""boring"" tasks like the ones mentioned in this movie.
This movie was such a farce.
It seemed disjointed and felt almost like Ms. McCarthy was up on stage moving from sketch to sketch all by herself with too few jokes and even less of a story. I just expected better quality that I know these writers and actors are so capable of.

Not appropriate for small kids but the story line was light (which was to be expected) and I swear Melissa McCarthy did her homework with the ""get rich guru"". She had all the theatrics that they have at their conventions that you spend 2 arms and both legs for. I thought it was a nice light movie. A 5 Star rating for me. The purpose of movies is that the people we love to see acting portray different characters. This was one of them. I think those that are expecting to see her and not the character may have been disappointed. I wasn't. It was a really fun movie!",1489017600,7,734,4.176056338028169

It wasn't till the credits I realized I hadn't been tempted to scroll once. I did laugh out loud several times. I actually really enjoyed the story. I thought it would be really light on plot. Yes it was predictable but utterly enjoyable. Plus there were a lot of quirky little plot twists and unexpected humor. I really enjoyed the cameo appearances from Kathy Bates, Gayle King, Kristen Schaal and Cecily Strong. Peter Dinklage was awesome as usual. Ellen Anderson who played Rachel, Bell's daughter, was really impressive. Top shelf acting. Overall this movie was a pleasant surprise. Funnier than expected.

7728619,5,B01E0833YC,"I wonder if it's fair to say Melissa McCarthy is turning into the female version of Jim Carrey!  Seriously both are extremely funny if you're into flat out ridiculous silly humor. Both are over the top outrageous comedians.  I feel a movie like the Boss places Melissa McCarthy in a position where she's not quite at the height of her career but approaching that point.

As for the Boss, it's hilarious of course!  Just like Spy, it begins on a quiet and normal note.  You're not quite expecting the story to take such an outrageous turn but sure enough, it does!  I had a feeling it would based on my previous viewing of Melissa McCarthy films.  In the Boss Melissa portrays a rich CEO lady who gets busted for insider trading, goes to jail for 4 months and losses all her money.  When she's released, she moves into the apartment with her former assistant (Kristen Bell) and her young daughter (played by Ella Anderson).

At first Kristen rejects Melissa knowing what kind of person she is.  Very bossy, hoity toity and demanding.  Also highly inappropriate.  But the daughter sort of convinces Kristen that Melissa must stay since she has nowhere else to go.  I'm a little shocked the movie completely skips over Melissa's time in prison.  I felt the opportunity for several hilarious moments could have occurred with Melissa behind bars.  At least we see Melissa play tennis.  Do they even allow tennis ball machines in prison?

Anyway, you're probably wondering if the humor is edgy and inappropriate like it often was in Spy.  The answer.... YES!  The sexual jokes are *very* high throughout the Boss, and they only get stronger and grosser as the story rolls along.  It's quite unusual considering the story focuses on children so often, and how there's so many appearances by children.

And oh yeah, the story!  Melissa wants to rebuild her empire.  At least, start a new one on a much smaller scale.  She gets involved in a brownie selling business with the Girl Scouts at school.  Too bad this particular part of the story sort of falls apart halfway through, but for what it is it's *really* funny.  Of course Melissa's as dirty as ever, and the Girl Scout meetings is when her dirty mouth is revealed.

The one mother who attends the meetings, Janell Islas' character, is a total snotty you-know-what.  Of course her personality is NOT going to blend well with Melissa's!  You can see this coming a mile away.  The segment with Melissa fighting Janell and Janell's group of girls out on the streets because one street is supposedly Janell's territory is the best moment in the Boss for me.  Very violent and outrageous indeed with girls being tossed and thrown all over the place.  It's topped off with a nearby car set on fire!  Even a wagon rolls across the street on fire as Melissa and her girls triumphantly storm off!  I love the one teenage girl named Crystal who has an attitude and likes to punch people.

Kristen Schaal is the teacher of the Girl Scouts who is too shy to speak out against Melissa and Janell's conversations.  She has a gentle cat loving side.  She excels with her many deeply concerned facial expressions.  An underrated actress Kristen Schaal is.  Maybe she's on the verge of bigger success.  I get the feeling she is.  She has a distinctive personality and I enjoy it.  From what I've seen of the Fox show the Last Man On Earth, she's a *very* funny person too.

Kathy Bates also makes a couple appearances.  Darn, that's not enough!  She's one of my favorite actresses ever!  She's still hilarious and almost reaches Melissa McCarthy's level of total insanity at times.  Funny when Kathy cusses out Melissa early on.  Even though the words are blurted out for this particular segment, you can pretty much understand them anyway!  There's also Peter Dinklage's character.  He's Melissa's former lover and comes back later for some sword slicing action.  Yup, another action-packed final segment to end the movie not much different from the same stuff you'd see in Spy.  He's the one responsible for Melissa losing her CEO job.

Kristen Bell's boss (Cecily Strong) is a lot like Janell's character, but perhaps even worse.  What an angry demanding sarcastic woman!  Goodness.  I couldn't work for someone like her seriously.  Tyler Labine's character works with Kristen.  He's shy and bad with women despite having good intentions.  Kristen refuses to go out on a date with him.  He's also responsible for some of the more vulgar oral sex jokes later on.  The scene with the security guard is quite funny though.  The security guard revealing he likes to live in a fantasy world when Tyler walks up to him in a clown suit is just... it's so silly and in bad taste due to the many oral sex jokes, but darn I couldn't stop laughing!

Perhaps this movie doesn't quite capture the good intentions of Melissa McCarthy as well as other films she stars in.  At least, the part at the end where she breaks into Kristen's house to apologize but ends up hiding in her closet is the most sincere moment of the movie.  I love her explanation when asked why she's hiding in the closet.  I can't remember it word for word, but it was something like ""I wanted to wait at the kitchen table and surprise you when you came downstairs, but I got scared figuring you'd think I was breaking into your home so I hid in the closet instead"".  LOL!

The action is pretty strong throughout, the story isn't quite as memorable as the one in Spy.  I can say the same concerning the action too.  The sincerity of Melissa's character doesn't quite reach the level of Spy either.  I know I know, ""Stop comparing everything to Spy!"" you're thinking.  Okay I'll stop!  Just one more thing- basically the Boss is slightly quieter/calmer than Spy in terms of story and action, but the sexual jokes are a couple notches higher.  I easily recommend the Boss if you think Melissa McCarthy is funny.",1485043200,,5901,4.680311890838206

7728655,1,B01E0833YC,"I think Melissa McCarthy is a talented comedic actress so I couldn't believe how terrible this movie actually was.  Did she need another house?  Or did her contract make her do this movie?  The plot was so thin it reminded me of a cross between Troop Beverly Hills and several equally unmemorable movies focused on the woes of corporate titans tossed to the curb (like that even happens in America anymore).

Had McCarthy and several other big names not been headlined this movie would not have been able to escape the cutting room floor, if it had it would have gone straight to Netflix or Redbox.

Additionally, it's main focus was foul language and strange sexual references that not only weren't funny they were perverse (I watched the rated version so I don't want to imagine the weirdness of that).  I can't believe I watched it in its entirety, yes, really it was that bad.  I didn't laugh or even smile at any of the ""funny"" scenes.  Frankly, I am disappointed at the fact that anyone would rate this a 4 or 5 star, but of course, many people like sex and bad language so that may explain it, it certainly wasn't due to the creative storyline.

Do yourself a favor skip this and clean out that drawer with all the junk in it or organize your paperwork or go out to dinner with friends.  This is not worth your time or your money.

If you liked Bridesmaids or The Heat don't use those as a reference point for this movie.  It was worse than Tammy or Identity Theft by miles!  The best thing I can say about this movie is that McCarthy tried.",1482969600,,1548,4.408450704225352

no, I never found her as a funny comedian. she is excellent actress but not a funny one at all.

stupid roles are her only roles I saw at all
tv series and movies with that actress are boring due to the idiot stories!

Seriously, you cant have a hit for every movie and she certainly pulled out some of her signature work here: pushy tough and physical stuff.  The kids were a fun genre sorta like a cruella daville seeking to get back in the game of sales at all costs.  I bought it regardless but its definitely a rental.  her others are great: Identity theft, The Spy (her best yet), the one with Bill Murray is touching and funny..St. Vincent.  I think its in her collaborations with other great comedians she shines.  Tammy, with Susan Sarandon and her road trip with grandma is really Melissa at her best, she needs a side kick and a good moderate one This movie and her most recent Ghostbusters were not same quality even tho budget gets higher.

7728882,3,B01E0833YC,"Directed by her husband Ben Falcone again (Tammy), Melissa McCarthy manages to get in a few very funny rants.  Unfortunately the rest of the movie just isn't very good.  McCarthy plays Michelle Darnell, a gilded investment broker who plays her followers like the Mary Kay crowd with lavish events.  After she makes a fortune using insider information, her jilted boyfriend and fellow investor, Renault (Peter Dinklage), who she calls Ronald, rats her out to the SEC.

At this point we might accept her aggressiveness given early scenes of her being left and returned to an orphanage many times.  After 6 months of playing tennis in prison, Michelle returns to civilian life to find all of her assets gone.  She goes to her one time personal assistant, Claire (Kristen Bell) and takes up space on her couch.  Claire and her cutesy 11-year old daughter Rachel (Ella Anderson) accept Michelle because she has no other place to go.  True.  Everyone hates Michelle because she lied and back stabbed everyone in her climb to the top of the financial mountain (47 richest woman in America).

By now it is pretty obvious where this is all going.  The only question is how will Michelle get her comeback started.  Well, she goes to a meeting of Rachels Dandelions, a spoof on the Girl Scouts/Brownies.  Michelle gets some rebels to revolt to her side and begins selling Claires homemade brownies, competing directly with the Dandelions cookies.  Game on.  In a scene I thought was very funny, the girls get into a knock-down-drag-out brawl in the middle of a residential neighborhood.

Afterwards at a celebratory dinner, Rachel gives Michelle a framed picture of them along with Claire, and we start to grab for our tissues.  But Michelle bolts, moves out and eventually sells the company out from Claire when they were 50/50 partners.  This whole section of the movie is quite ridiculous.  For one thing, we know it isn't going to last.  Frankly the whole movie is ridiculous, but oh those brief opportunities when McCarthy and her excellent straight-man (Bell) go off the rails almost makes it worthy, but not quite.",1475193600,2,2110,4.906779661016949

7728919,4,B01E0833YC,Melissa McCarthy never truly disappoints and I laughed a lot during this movie. Some scene were a bit much when it involved kids but it wasn't to the point that it was vulgar. The scene where the little brownie troops were fighting was absolutely hilarious. Melissa can be serious and she can be funny. Her character evolved and realized that there was more to life than money. The money was taking place of how she was always brought back to the orphanage when families would attempt to adopt her. Kathy Bates plays as her mentor that teaches her to be ruthless and make money. Kirsten Bell is her assistant while she was a millionaire making millions! Then she ends up in prison and once she gets out Melissa's character moves in with Kirsten. It is a storyline older than the times but never gets old when it ends well.,1474761600,,822,4.523489932885906

7728921,5,B01E0833YC,"Very, very, very, very, very, very, funny, funny, funny. funny, funny, funny, funny, funny COMEDY!

Real movie stars like Melissa McCarthy make excellently managed movies.

From the beginning to end THE BOSS has the jokes, and an entertaining story. Excellent acting by Melissa McCarthey and Kristen Bell in THE BOSS. It appears to be a somewhat fictional story regarding the issues of insider trading, and the life after the punishment of that type crime. It is a look into the point of view of someone living that life. Bosses in the real world rarely end up in prison for insider trading but it can obviously. happen.

There are many questions. Where do they go? Do they get in more and more trouble? Are they able to survive?

One of the more humorous areas in the movie are the unfortunate survival circumstances. There are also many funny jokes as well but it is really the characters situation from an orphan, to a success, to an insider trader, to a criminal, to an ex-con having to start over, that makes this movie somewhat different from the usual comedy.

Everyone gets in trouble at work, or a traffic ticket eventually, but it is still rare to get in serious trouble for insider trading, but it does really happen. So although it is a serious crime and punishment, there is a certain human element that gets thrown into this type of story. No one really wants to know a criminal after their punishment is over in the USA.

This fact can seem unfair to a certain point, and mostly for those caught, but that reality is also turned into some comedic scenes and situations in THE BOSS. Although it is fiction it has several subjects and areas most movies usually do not risk going into. The USA is still a popularity contest and people want to know the winners not the losers, but that is also what ends up later causing internal management problems.

It is five stars for the jokes and acting for the most part. The above mentioned complex insider trading and management disaster in the plot and script add a great deal of new points of view about such crimes and the reality of the human side of what occurred.

People can end up making poor decisions,  but they are still people after the fact and judgement is over, and some are hilarious criminals!",1474761600,,2264,4.598014888337469

7729100,4,B01E0833YC,"I don't always like Melissa McCarthy's characters, sometimes she tries to hard at making a character strong, and they come across on screen as a bully, but with The Boss, although her character is mildly crude and a bit unethical, I found Michelle Darnell to be overall likable. She does talk down to everyone but really only really rude to those who have attacked her first and somewhat deserve it, such as the mother who obviously enjoys bossing everyone else around at the girl guide type place and tries to get her removed from attending because she's been to jail.  I didn't get the joke of the neck brace (which obviously isn't a neck brace because it always a different filmy scarf like material) that her character always wore that went up to her chin.  They really needed a line or something in there to explain why her character wore that.

The Boss maybe lacks a little bit though in laughs and when it does have a funny scene, can sometimes continue that scene on for too long. I watched the extended version (region 4 DVD) so some of my comments may not be applicable to the theatrical release version. But the teeth exposed scene for one, I was seriously contemplating fast forwarding after a while.  Overall even though I only saw it last night, I can't think of many you've got to see this moments to talk about with whoever watches it in the future.  The street brawl maybe.  I liked Peter Dinklage's scenes however they enforced the whole this movie isn't trying to be realistic at all vibe.  Overall the movie is pretty much a single mother who was a former assistant of a tycoon who went to jail, now hates her job and needs her former big pushy personality boss to force her way back into her life to motivate her to do something better with her life type of film.  Kristen Bell plays that mother, but I did find her to be a bit underutilised in this film, especially on the comedy side of things.

The Boss is a film worth watching once, but not really one that will motivate too many repeat viewings.",1473206400,,2023,4.475543478260869

7729206,2,B01E0833YC,"My mom and I rented this.  Her, my step father and I started watching.  We laughed at a few parts.  I had a hard time getting into it.  It seems to play like it is a family movie, with language that in no way, would be good for children.

Another thing, there really is no story.  They just put you into this ladys life.  Ok, I understand that showing how she got to her position, would be another movie.  Still, they could have worked a lot more to at least give it something.

Sometimes, she will whisper into another ladys ear.  One who she does not like.  The stuff she says, just means nothing.  It was funny the first time.  But then, it is like they just didn't care to make anything of it.  They had the idea, but went nowhere with it.

I would have given this a three out of five.  We are going to finish the movie tonight.  As I said, we did laugh at a few parts.  But, there is one scene that throws this movie in the trash.  Two groups are fighting.  You see one girl, standing with a sword.  Then, when they walk away, you see fire all over the place.  I mean, it threw the entire movie off.  It was just completely random and pointless.

If you were wondering, the movie is about a lady who has a tough time as a kid.  She becomes really successful with business.  She gets in trouble from her rival.  See one day sees girls selling cookies and asked about the profit and stuff like that.  THEN, she starts her own group.  Selling something that a friend of hers makes.  That is it.  haha",1472688000,2,1502,4.128919860627177

I find her physical humor hysterical, she's willing to do anything and her comedic timing is always fun too....but I didn't really care for this movie. It's not McCarthy's fault either, it's just that his character isn't fun to watch and much of that has to do with the writing. There were some genuinely funny moments but over all I really didn't laugh as much as I hoped to.

I also found the cussing to be way over the top. I'm not easily offended in that manner it's just that the over-use of it in a movie that just doesn't seem to really need it is well....dumb. It dumbs-down the entire film when the writers get that cheap.",1471824000,,684,4.34375

Kristen Bell is a very standard issue put upon single mom trying to make it character that is as boring as watching paint dry. It really has no plot; its just a series of dumb vignettes mashed together to the extent that you feel as if you saw all of the good stuff in the trailer. I can see what they were trying to do, but the whole movie is a mess and it just comes across as lame. Youll really wish you had waited for it to come out on TBS.

7729432,5,B01E0833YC,"I enjoyed this movie, however, I'm a big fan of the sharp raw movies by Melissa McCarthy.  This is not Gilmore Girls nor Mike and Molly.

I feel the unrated version is way better than the theatrical version.  Lots of cussing and insulting sharp take-no-prisoner humor.  If it bothers you hearing women and kids cuss this may not be for you.

The character, Michelle Darnell, was created about 15 years ago at the Groundlings Improv Theater---which is hilarious.  Do a google search...very funny.  I found the background they gave her as child having a hard time finding a family to adopt and ""keep"" her to the redemption of creating, destroying and then saving a brownie ""girl scout-ish"" business for an single mom ex-assistant and her daisy-girl daughter to be hilarious and touching.

Other Actors:
I LOVE LOVE LOVED the cameo of her mentor and ""to have a family or no-family"" adviser---Kathy Bates is strangely tender in a money greedy dysfunctional way.  (I wanted to see more of this character and their relationship)

Peter Dinkelage as her ex love interest is superb and the dynamic of him and his assistant finding ways of undercutting Michelle is too funny.  The riffing between the two is funny and comfortable.  The 80's greed history and competitive relationship between the two of them is well developed and too funny.

Kristen Bell and her daughter bring the sweetest and softness to his sharp humored movie.

MOVIE EXTRAS: Fun to watch and wish there were more.  The alternate scenes and deleted scenes were the most entertaining.

The little kid that plays as a main character is a horrible actor and nothing really makes you attached to any other character. Even McCarthy herself has a role thats really not worth getting into.

I love Melissa McCarthy . . . and just about everyone else in the film, but there were several glaring errors that were just too disappointing to overlook.  The writing was uneven, as if Melissa and Ben weren't sure whether to make this an action movie, a crime story, a heartwarming story, or a ""show off"" film for Melissa's weight loss.  (And hiding Melissa's neck throughout -- whether she was onstage or in bed -- that was just wrong . . . along with the overdone makeup that never faded or changed in the entire two hours of showtime.)

I'm glad I saw this on pay-per-view because I would never watch it again if I owned it.  Although The Boss is better than most so-called comedies out now, it was still a big disappointment.  I want the funny, friendly, down-to-earth Melissa back.",1470873600,,884,4.459627329192546

7729527,1,B01E0833YC,"The film stumbles from scene to scene trying to make you laugh with a kind of sad, awkward desperation that makes you feel embarrassed to not laugh. Like a comic just bombing on stage, but they keep on going, throwing out anything for a laugh so they can at least end on a high note. That note never comes for The Boss. You're stuck, praying to god enough people pity chuckle for a gracious exit or someone finally gets drunk enough to heckle them off the stage so you can quietly say to your friends that it take a lot of courage to stand up there, but secretly you're relived the world is full of drunk a-holes.

Throughout the movie Melissa McCarthy wears absurdly high turtlenecks. At first I thought it was an attempt to give her a slimmer/more aggressive angular face when she was on top of the world, but she kept wearing them, even when she's down and out. It's almost like one of the writers came up with a bit/gag they intended to expand upon as the movie progressed, but it never got beyond the first scene of having an absurdly high turtleneck. And that really sums up the writing in The Boss.

Acting. Whatever. Pretty much a fail by everyone, which is a shame since with a decent script I've seen what Peter Dinklage can do. I'm fast becoming a non-believer in McCarthy. Spy was great, and who doesn't like a good poop scene (Bridesmaids), but I just don't buy her as the fast talking, foul mouthed type.

In short, pirate this one. Waste your time watching it, not your money.",1470787200,,1491,4.414545454545454

I wish I could give a negative star rating.",1470528000,,389,4.328767123287672

The Boss was an incoherent, senseless, no plot, no rhythm no point waste of time. Melissa's talent and natural beauty unrecognizable and non-existent in this unrated garbage.  I rented it yesterday morning and I am still angry with myself for wasting five dollars on it.  Melissa why?",1470528000,,387,5.095238095238095

7729651,4,B01E0833YC,"What struck me most about this film was how perfectly McCarthy captured her character, down to the verbal and physical mannerisms. Even the hand gestures were perfectly cultivated - if you've ever spent time following the big lifestyle gurus you'll know what I mean. There was just enough slapstick to hearken back to classic ""Melissa moments"" of her usual comedy style, but a more nuanced performance around character development and her emotions. It's a light comedy, no major world-shaking philosophy here, but some really fun moments. Personal fave was the gang war between the rival cookie factions, which took girl-fight to a whole new level for me. Hilarious stuff. I also happen to adore Kristen Bell, and she was a good ""straight man"" for Melissa's over the top personality. Peter Dinklage is sort of a random bad-guy, useful as a plot device but not particularly funny - probably the only weak spot in the film really. He just didn't make sense to me, the backstory was sort of jammed into the movie sideways and didn't really mesh. I guess we're supposed to just laugh at the physical juxtaposition of their body shapes. Definitely worth a few bucks and hours as a rental on a Friday night, perfect microwave popcorn movie.",1470441600,15,1234,4.880952380952381

7729654,2,B01E0833YC,"Man, I really wanted to like this movie. I love so many of Melissa McCarthy's movies and seek out movies she stars in because her humor resonates with me. (I also love Peter Dinklage, who plays the villain in this movie.) Sadly, this was a flop for me. It felt half-baked and relied on predictable base humor and sight gags more than original stuff and lacked relatable characters. The movie glossed over the main character's background and why she was the way she was, and the big ""battle"" fell really flat and was unexciting and lacked any twists or surprises.",1470355200,,562,4.63

I never laughed 1x..the story was so beyond ridiculous and cliche and far fetched it was impossible to care about it. I'm amazed that the biggest comedic star would green light the script. Kristen Bell is so flat and non charismatic it's like she's punching the clock in her brain during the whole movie. Melissa is so funny it's hard to believe she couldn't make me laugh once and her character was not at all the usual endearing misfit. It was odd, awkward and plain awful .

7729671,2,B01E0833YC,"I am sorry to say we really did not care for this movie.  We just love Mellissa McCarthy, but it just fell short.  It was totally not our sort of humor at all.  Once again this is our personal choice and opinion.  We felt the attempt at humor was not really appropriate for us.  There was a number of scenes that depicted violence involving teenage girls and we just found most of the movie distasteful.  I really do not think it is suitable for young people.  I am really trying to be kind here and not over the top.  I would suggest if you want to see it, you might want to stream it or something less expensive than buying it.",1470096000,,629,4.140495867768595

I think there may be a glitch, because there were that were really funny to that felt like something was missing the 2nd and 3rd time I watched. I think the system may have stream the regular version the 2nd and 3rd time I watched it, and streamed the unrated version the first.  This has happened to me before.

7729684,2,B01E0833YC,"One criterion in judging the mettle of a performer is whether they can make reading the phone book interesting.  Unfortunately that is basically what Melissa McCarthy is called upon to do here.  McCarthy is fine but she has little to hang her performance onto due to an inept script by husband Ben Falcone who is also the film's director.  Ditto Peter Dinklage who gets sparse laughs as McCarthy's vengeance minded former lover.  My reaction is not knee-jerk because I was a fan of the previous collaboration between McCarthy and Falcone, ""Tammy"".  To be democratic my wife absolutely loved this film finding it to be an uproarious feminist empowerment comedy.",1470009600,4,660,5.018348623853211

Call if you need a witness..and I'm very sorry about your loss. P.S. If you liked this movie, get help!",1469836800,,584,4.679611650485437

7729837,3,B01E0833YC,"In The Boss,"" Melissa McCarthy plays business superstar Michelle Darnell, the worlds 47th-richest woman. When we first meet her, shes appearing in a stadium filled with thousands of fans as she provides motivational aphorisms about self-actuation and discovering ones inner self. Shes a virtual rock star and icon who has amassed a fortune, not always through strictly legal means.

Arrested for insider trading, she spends several months behind bars. When released, she discovers that the government has seized her assets. With no money and no place to go, she lands on the doorstep of her former assistant, single mother Claire (Kristen Bell), who agrees to put Michelle up in her small apartment until she can get on her feet.

A Girl Scout meeting she attends with Claires daughter, Rachel (Ella Anderson), gives Michelle an idea for getting back into the money game: sell Claires delicious brownies door-to-door. Michelle teaches her young protges how to succeed using cutthroat methods that don't always coincide with genteel behavior.

Director Ben Falcone (Ms. McCarthys husband) draws on his wifes ability to balance slapstick with her talent for reaching beneath the surface gag to show some depth to Michelle. However, the film is at its freewheeling best when McCarthy says outrageously inappropriate things, faces down an annoying Girl Scout mom, longs for sympathy from hard-working Claire, fires up Rachel and her pals to break sales records whatever it takes, and comically spurns the advances of a former lover (Peter Dinklage).

Not since Lucille Ball and Carol Burnett has there been a comedienne so adept at physical comedy. Ms. McCarthy seems game to do anything as long as it results in a laugh. The Boss takes full advantage of this talent while also focusing on Michelles transformation from ruthless go-getter to grounded, compassionate people person. The last third of the movie becomes overly sentimental and we miss the brash, bull-in-a-china-shop version of Michelle.

Kristen Bell has the thankless job of being straight man to McCarthys Michelle. Shes there to react, provide set-up lines, be the voice of reason in a madcap swirl of craziness, and be the adult trying to set a good example for her daughter despite Michelles unrestrained ways.

This is not a picture for the whole family. Its R rating reflects strong language, sexual situations, and drug use. By pushing the envelope in nearly every scene, the movie creates anticipation as we wait, open- mouthed, to see how far the filmmakers will go.

The Boss is not one of Ms. McCarthys best films, but she is undeniably fun to watch in this larger-than-life role. The true test of comedy is whether it generates laughs. Though many of the gags border  and even enter the realm of  questionable taste, The Boss is often hilarious.

Bonus extras on the unrated 2-disc Blu-ray/DVD Combo Pack include the featurettes Peter Dinklage Gets to the Point and Everybody Loves Kristen Bell; alternate ending; deleted scenes; extended/alternate scenes; and gag reel. A digital HD copy is included.",1468627200,,3074,5.1546184738955825

7729843,4,B01E0833YC,"I don't need anyone. Im going straight to the top."" Michelle Darnell (McCarthy) has had a hard life. Living in and out of orphanages growing up hardened her and made her the woman she is today; one of the richest and most powerful women in the world, and former prison inmate. When she is released she has nothing and no one to turn to, except her former assistant Claire (Bell). Willing to accept her in for a few days but after Michelle takes Claires daughter to her Girl Scout meeting everything changes. After watching the last few McCarthy movies I have said that she only has a few movies left before her humor starts to get played out. After watching this one I realize that I am wrong. She is as hilarious as ever in this one and is one of her best movies she has ever made. She really lets loose in this movie and says and does things that are different then her usual unsure of herself characters, and it works. There is something about her that is just so likeable that even when she plays a character like this you cant help but laugh with, and not at. Overall, one of the funniest and smartest comedies I have seen in a while. I laughed out loud many many times watching this, and I watched by myself. McCarthy is a comic genius and I cant wait till her next movie. Watch this today, unless you offend easy. I easily give this an Aa very very hilarious A.",1464220800,24,1368,4.285714285714286

That includes characters created by McCarthy herself, like the blustering one-percenter Michelle Darnell in ""The Boss"". Directed and co-written by McCarthy's husband, Ben Falcone, the film resembles in all of the worst ways their previous collaboration, the road trip debacle ""Tammy"", in that it's never quite as scathing as it wants to be, and isn't heart-warming enough to be redemptive.

The best scenes in ""The Boss"" occur early on as McCarthy is set free to cut loose in a shower of glorious white collar excess. Looking like the turtleneck and pantsuit-wearing offspring of Hillary Clinton and Tony Robbins, Michelle Darnell preaches her brand of ""get rich quick"" Wall Street mumbo jumbo to a packed arena. While she preaches that everyone who follows her plan will get rich, it's really all about showing off just how disgustingly wealthy she already is, arriving on the back of a flaming phoenix and boasting that she once paid to have Destiny's Child reunite in her home, just to watch them break up again.

The redemption process begins early and hilariously through flashbacks of Michelle as an orphaned child, repeatedly dumped by parent after parent, turning her into the fiercely independent woman she would turn out to be. But that isolation has also made her incredibly self-involved; her office is decked out with huge self-portraits, and she can barely remember that her beleaguered assistant Claire (Kristen Bell) is a single mother with her own problems. After Michelle spends four months in prison for insider trading, she's forced to live in Claire's cramped Chicago apartment, on a foldout couch that might as well double as a catapult. But it's there that Michelle has a brilliant money-making idea; use Claire's daughter Rachel (Ella Anderson) to sell brownies through her Dandelion troop.

Who knew the brownie selling business could be so cutthroat? Michelle rips up and down the stuck-up moms who refuse to let their daughters join, erupting into a brawl that nearly puts Anchorman's star-studded fights to shame, except that it's a bunch of little girls and women beating up little girls...which is admittedly a little creepy. Michelle also has run-ins with her former love, Renault (it's really Ronald...from New Jersey), played by Peter Dinklage, who holds a grudge against her. The problem is that Renault isn't much of a foe, and when he's gone for long stretches it doesn't really matter. But Michelle is also only interesting when she has someone to tear into, be it woman or child. The film's best one-liners (best saved for maximum laughter) are Michelle's vicious verbal assaults on one mother played by ""Bridesmaids"" and ""Joy"" writer Annie Mumolo. She can't call her tall daughter a ""freak"" enough, or suggest that she's a lesbian-in-waiting. And like some of McCarthy's less successful films, when the jokes dry up she relies on falling flat on her face, with diminishing results. Physical humor is one of the things she does best, but it's not a substitute for a lousy script or Falcone's shoddy direction.

The final act, which includes an impromptu heist of some important business documents, is especially barren, except to cement Michelle's unsatisfying change-of-heart. Many of McCarthy's characters undergo a similar transformation, but so little effort is put into redeeming them that it almost never works. Michelle is one of those cases; she's just as terrible and unlikable at the end as she was in the beginning, troubled upbringing or not. And it's not like she just tells one lie or two, she actively destroys lives. Why do we want to root for her?

McCarthy and Falcone have a great rapport with one another on the big screen, always with him as a character refusing her sexual advances. They flash that ironic chemistry in ""The Boss"", as well. But as filmmaking partners it may be a good idea to have an open relationship.&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Boss-Blu-ray/dp/B01E0832W0/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Boss [Blu-ray</a>]",1463788800,,4318,5.243125904486252

They were painted as vicious monsters. But the truth is that these dogs are lovable and make great family pets. Then in the 90s the Rottweiler was the ""villain dog"" but with the right people it can be a great family dog. And now today the pitbull has a terrible stigma for no reason. Pitties  can be excellent family pets if they are in the hands of the right people.  There is always some sort of dog being demonized in our culture.  it has to stop.",1528675200,,613,4.222222222222222
