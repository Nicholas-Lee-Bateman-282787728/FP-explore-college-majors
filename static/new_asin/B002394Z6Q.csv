8349725,5,B002394Z6Q,"This film shows us that even priests are like the rest of us, human; that we all have problems. But the catch here, as the film tries to convey is how we as humans deal with those problems. What I didn't like is, it seems, the church's reluctance in helping their fellow man. Yes he was relieved of some of his duties; even did some rehab, but the church didn't really extend their hand. They were aware he had problems but that was it. The actor portraying this troubled priest did an excellent job in carrying out his role and the film makers also made this an excellent film by showing, via flashbacks, some of the reasons or should I say the causes of some of these problems.",1390780800,,679,4.3125
