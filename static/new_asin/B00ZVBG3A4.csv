7295342,5,B00ZVBG3A4,"A Room with a view is an outstanding movie that I never tire of watching, and it holds up just as well today as when it was released.  There is no question the movie deserves five stars, hence my rating.  That said, this Criterion 4K bluray transfer leaves a *lot* to be desired on the video side of the equation.  There is significant grain throughout, but that can't really be helped due to the film's age I would guess.  What is unforgivable, is a continuous video glitch throughout the film easily noticeable on my LG EC9300 Oled TV, that adds what can best be described as a white screen door-like effect to the picture, taking the viewer out of the cinematic experience.  I sincerely hope that either I had a defective disc, or all the discs are defective, because I can't believe Criterion would give the green light to such a horrific video transfer intentionally.  I will be looking forward to a disc recall and exchange without the glitch in the near future with any luck.",1443657600,14,982,4.551136363636363
7295343,5,B00ZVBG3A4,"This little masterpiece has never had a good time on home video. It's been released with an aspect ratio of 4x3, 1.85 and 1.78. It's been scrubbed and timed for a glossy amber glow. It's been DNR'd to sterility. But finally, nearly thirty years later, the film gets the respect it deserves. The proper aspect ratio of 1.66:1 has been observed and the film itself has gone through extensive restoration to fix a really horrific problem with the original negative I'd never heard about until now. It seems the negative was developed too quickly in the bath, which resulted in uneven development of frames throughout the entire feature, causing flicker and color and brightness shifts. All of that has been healed with this 4k transfer. Also, color timing is as close to I remember seeing the film theatrically in 1987 (yes, it played for over a year in Los Angeles!!). Audio is Dolby 2.0, mercifully NOT spread to 5.1 or wider for bored, slack-jawed modern audiences. Special features are slim, but delightful. What can one expect for a movie that cost a mere 3 million?

So after watching this blu ray with unblinking wide eyes for nearly two hours, I feel a tremendous sense of relief that this kind of redemptive restoration is still happening, and for home video, too. I used to frequent that sad site, Home Theatre Forum, and would argue correct aspect ratios with the basement-dwellers there. I insisted over and over that A Room with a View was originally released in 1.66 and even that charlatan film ""restorer"" Robert Harris (whose only real claim to fame was making Lawrence of Arabia too damned long) would argue back that 1.66 was no longer being projected in America, if it ever was, since the seventies or sixties. His pack of sycophantic lickspittles followed suit, groaning that a 1.78 crop was not harmful, that it was only a slight sliver. This disc proves it does indeed matter, for the point of digital restoration, any kind of restoration, is to remain true to the film's original intent. This is a stunning blu ray, with film grain intact, but a fresh image that you can step right into. The film, like the novel it is based on, transports one to another time and place - Italy and England in 1908. Thank you Criterion, for this. I almost forgive you for the debacle of Howards End!",1443571200,49,2302,4.698019801980198
7295344,5,B00ZVBG3A4,"A Room With a View is set in 1907 and moves between a pensione in Florence, Italy, and the Surrey countryside where Lucy Honeychurch (Helena Bonham Carter) lives with her mother (Rosemary Leach). Chaperoned by her fussbudget Aunt Charlotte (Maggie Smith), well-to-do Lucy is traveling on a journey designed to expose her to new experiences and broaden her horizons. Though a young woman of privilege and breeding, Lucy is opened up to passions she didn't realize she harbored. While on holiday in Florence, she falls in love with the socially unacceptable George Emerson (Julian Sands). A simple kiss from free spirit George at a picnic turns Lucys world topsy-turvy as she tries to sort out her burgeoning romantic feelings. Though attracted to Georges independent nature, she is engaged to bookish Cecil Vyse (Daniel Day-Lewis) back in more conservative Surrey.

Director James Ivory has assembled a sterling cast in his adaptation of the E.M. Forster novel. Ms. Carter, who has been seen of late in sinister, grotesque roles (Sweeney Todd, Les Miserables, Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 2), makes a charming Lucy torn between societal expectations and her own heart. Maggie Smith plays the sort of character she was born for  a variation of Lady Violet Crawley of Downton Abbey. Watching her survey a room at the pensione is a great example of how an expression or a gesture can speak volumes.

Bonus features on the Blu-ray release include new interviews with director James Ivory, crew members, and actors Helena Bonham Carter, Simon Callow and Julian Sands; a segment about Merchant-Ivory Productions from a 1987 episode of NBC Nightly News; and a critical essay. The new digital transfer was supervised by James Ivory and cinematographer Tony Pierce-Roberts.",1443312000,4,1777,5.163194444444445
7295345,5,B00ZVBG3A4,"In romance movies, there is always some obstacle that needs to be overcome before the lovers can come together for good. But what if the obstacle is one of the lovers?

Such is the problem in ""A Room With A View,"" a classic Merchant-Ivory film adapted from E.M. Forster's lightest and sweetest novel. And while it follows the will-they-won't-they formula of most romcoms, there's a poignancy and enchanted quality to the movie that results -- director James Ivory fills it with exquisitely lush countryside, a natural unfolding of romantic and personal problems, and a magnificent cast playing characters who end up being quite likable.

After a childhood spent in a small, idyllic Surrey village, Lucy Honeychurch (Helena Bonham-Carter) journeys to Italy with her middle-aged cousin/chaperone Charlotte (Maggie Smith). Charlotte is dismayed when their rooms at the pensione don't have a view, which inspires the outgoing but clueless Mr. Emerson (Denholm Elliott) to volunteer the more ""viewy"" rooms of himself and his awkward, quiet son George (Julian Sands).

During the stay, Lucy becomes better acquainted with George, the pleasant Reverend Beebe (Simon Callow), some nice old ladies, and a cheesy romance novelist (Judi Dench). Then George impulsively and passionately kisses Lucy in a field of flowers, but Charlotte convinces Lucy that he's just a rake seeking an easy conquest.

Upon their return to Surrey, Lucy becomes engaged to a pompous and wealthy young man, Cecil Vyse (Daniel Day-Lewis), and seems destined for a completely conventional life. But then she learns that Cecil has arranged for a local country villa to be rented by the Emersons -- and George's friendship with her brother causes him to enter her orbit. Soon Lucy finds that not only are George's feelings for her very real, but she may not be able to hide what she feels for him as well.

Out of all of Forster's stories, ""A Room With A View"" is perhaps the lightest and most enchanting -- there aren't any sudden deaths, contrived obstacles, social upheavals or then-taboo subjects. It's just a sweet love story, where the lovers' biggest problem is that one of them is reluctant to admit that she loves the other. There are a few convenient coincidences (which George chalks up to ""fate""), but for the most part, it's all about two people's awkward, rocky road to finding true love.

And Ivory makes every scene like a glorious painting come to life -- the lush Italian countryside and sunlit cities, the quaint English villages, the forests full of murky ponds and waving ferns. The story unfolds at a gradual, pleasant pace, punctuated by pretty tableaus of tennis, carriage rides and meanders through the woods, and dialogue that ranges from amusing (""Why shouldn't she be transfigured? It happened to the Goths!"") to beautiful in its simplicity (""He doesn't love you. But I love you. I want you to have your own thoughts and ideas and feelings, even when I hold you in my arms!"").

Occasionally Ivory's artistic taste gets a bit self-indulgent (a very long, mildly homoerotic nude frolic/wrestling match by Beebe, Frederick and George in the woods), but he knows when to insert gentle humor and a tinge of bittersweetness (Charlotte's unspoken lament over her own lost chances at love).

And one of the most striking things about the story is how likable everyone is. All the characters have flaws (Cecil is a snob, Charlotte is an uptight Victorian, Lucy is excessively stubborn, Mr. Emerson is loud and clueless, George is socially awkward) but they ultimately all prove to be good, kind people when their flaws and mistakes are revealed to them. There is no villain or even an antagonist -- though Cecil seems like he will be the major obstacle to George and Lucy's happiness, the sudden breaking of their engagement shows that he isn't that bad a guy, and that he did care for her.

It also helps to have a magnificent cast, including Bonham-Carter, Sands, Smith, Eliott, Dench and Day-Lewis. Bonham-Carter gives a sublime performance in particular, and though Ivory often reminds us that Lucy is unconsciously lying to herself and everyone else, she nails it in a final emotional outpouring in front of Mr. Emerson. Sands is outstanding as a passionate, beauty-loving young man who doesn't really know how to properly woo a young lady, as the counterpoint to the repressed, over-cautious Smith, who has to rediscover what young love can be. And while Day-Lewis seems to be playing a caricature at first, he does imbue the character with depth and a measure of likability.

As for the Criterion edition of this movie, it's relatively bare-bones compared to some of their other releases. As well as the usual digital/audio refinement, it also has a news item on Merchant Ivory Productions, an essay by John Pym (no, not the Parliamentarian) and several interviews with actors, James Ivory and the costume designer John Bright.

The excellent actors and glorious direction make ""A Room With A View"" a glorious experience -- a warm'n'fuzzy period romance with characters that are easy to like. Bright, bittersweet and a treat for the senses.",1443052800,11,5129,5.015276145710929

7295348,2,B00ZVBG3A4,"First, the good: cinematography, picture and audio quality are excellent! Hard to believe that this is a 1985 movie. The acting of protagonist is also good, within the restraints put on her by the script.

Now the bad: the dialogues are so banal and the characters are so stereotyped, that I thought it must have been a movie from 2010 or later (ok I am not fair here as 1985 had seen the releases of Rambo, Commando and Out of Africa, all fair company to A Room with a view). The lines of the protagonist and others are unnatural to the point that it feels as if the script is a copy-paste of dialogues from some third-rate novel, without even adopting it to be watchable when spoken by live human beings. (I am not saying anything about the original novel on which this film is based; maybe it's good - I don't know). I wanted to stop watching it every five minutes after the first five minutes. Kept watching mainly because of the plenty of praising reviews here on Amazon, but after the first 50 mins, enough is enough. What made all these people rate it on average almost as high as ""All about Eve"", ""On golden pond"" or ""Terms of endearment"", is a mystery for me. On my part I should have at least watched the trailer of this movie before blowing $27 on the blu ray.

Merchant Ivory Productions, led by director James Ivory and producer Ismail Merchant, became a household name with A Room with a View, the first of their extraordinary adaptations of E. M. Forster novels. A cherubic nineteen-year-old Helena Bonham Carter plays Lucy Honeychurch, a young, independent-minded, upper-class Edwardian woman who is trying to sort out her burgeoning romantic feelings, divided between an enigmatic free spirit [Julian Sands] she meets on vacation in Florence and the priggish bookworm [Daniel Day-Lewis] to whom she becomes engaged back in the more corseted Surrey. Funny, sexy, and sophisticated, this gargantuan art-house hit features a sublime supporting castincluding Simon Callow, Dame Judi Dench, Denholm Elliot, and Dame Maggie Smith  and remains a touchstone of intelligent romantic cinema.

Andrews Blu-ray Review: This is one of the best romantic films of all time that I knew immediately was destined to be among one of my all-time favourites. Now, for well over thirty years later, I still love it to pieces. A thoroughly entertaining screen adaptation of novelist E.M. Forster's romantic comedy of manners about the Edwardian English upper class at home and abroad, distinguished by superb ensemble acting, intelligent writing and stunning design.

Produced by Ismail Merchant and directed by James Ivory, A Room with a View was filmed under cloudless blue skies in the spring and summer of 1985. It is set at the beginning of the twentieth century, and the chief locations are Florence, the cradle of the Italian Renaissance, and a large late nineteenth-century country house in South East England. In an arid Italian Tuscany (notwithstanding one dramatic downpour) and verdant Kent (standing in for Surrey), where the bracken grows chest-high, the sun seems always to shine. And despite one or two richly lit interior scenes and one sequence inside the Basilica of Santa Croce in Florence, the film leaves the spectator with an overwhelming impression of being entirely suffused with heart-lifting, open-air sunlight and not unlike, in this respect, some of the masterworks of Renoir or Rohmer.

Among certain film snobs, ""Merchant Ivory"" eventually became shorthand for an introvert, highbrow costume drama, but A Room with a View, the first worldwide Merchant Ivory hit, is a vibrant comedy that is the opposite of stiff and dull. It teems with life, with passions both hidden and overt, with youthful energy and witty observations on the manners and customs of a bygone era. Based on E.M. Forster's 1908 novel, the film begins in Florence, where young upper middle-class Lucy Honeychurch is touring with her irritating chaperone, Charlotte Bartlett [Dame Maggie Smith]. Among the other English tourists staying at their Pensione Hotel are freethinking socialist Mr. Emerson and his son George Emerson, who are a rung or two down the social ladder from Lucy. When George's growing interest in Lucy leads to a stolen kiss, she flees in confusion. Back in England, their paths cross again, and Lucy Honeychurch must face her feelings for George Emerson.

Yet revisiting A Room with a View, thirty years on, one is struck not only by the glorious sunlight but equally by an effervescent lightness of tone, but also  a sense that the film has weathered the years without, in any significant way, growing old or stale. The tone is set at the opening, especially with the very elaborate descriptive title cards for the storys characters, such as Mr. Emerson, an English tourist.

Filmed on location in Italy, London and Kent, England this film has some gorgeous cinematography! Every shot is such a picturesque scene! There's the city of Florence with various historical sites and there's scenes shot in the amazing Tuscan countryside peppered with poppies! Then the last half of the film is shot in the English countryside at a Foxwold House and St. Mary's Church in Chiddingstone, Kent, England.

And when the film opens with the most beautiful lovely classical theme and the music throughout is just lovely. There also some lovely Italian songs like ""O mio babbino caro"" that set a wistful mood. Lucy also plays the piano and her brother Freddy does once as well. Part of the plot rests upon Mr. Beebe's thoughts that If Miss Honeychurch ever takes to live as she plays, it will be very exciting, both for us and for her.

But what make this exquisite romantic film look so beautiful, is of course all the designed costumes by Jenny Beaven that makes the Edwardian fashions again look truly scrumptious! The hats, boots, parasols, gloves, blouses, skirts and dresses are so lovely. Lucy Honeychurch's styles are particularly sweet and pretty and her puffy hairstyles are actually very nice and if untidy at times. The gentlemen are always very smart in their dandy outfits with colourful ties and vests to make their outfits unique. Overall the costumes are some of the best I've ever seen for the time period they are portraying.

The cast for A Room with a View was a combination of polished veteran actors such as Dame Maggie Smith, Denholm Elliott, Dame Judi Dench, and Simon Callow, and rising newcomers. It was only the second film for Helena Bonham Carter, who plays Lucy Honeychurch. She had the title role in another historical drama, Lady Jane [1986], which was released almost simultaneously with A Room with a View. Helena Bonham Carter would star in another Merchant-Ivory adaptation of a Forster novel, Howard's End [1992], as well as other period dramas, including The Wings of the Dove [1997], for which she won an OSCAR nomination. Helena Bonham Carter has joked about being a ""corset sex symbol,"" and has gone on to a career filled with varied and quirky roles.

The costumes, which the actors seem entirely at home in, are also perfect as is Bonham Carters mastery of the piano pieces she needed to be able to fake for the film. The script is marvellous and conveys the dilemma faced by Lucy as she grapples with her hearts desire vs the social mores of the time while still remaining humorous and entertaining. For Lucy must choose between her restricted upper-class life and the freeing new world represented by the Emersons. As her mother tries to convey to Freddy, there is a right sort and a wrong sort and Lucy must decide who falls into which category for her.

A Room with a View cost $2.8 million to make and grossed over $60 million worldwide, breaking box office records. It played in one London cinema for an entire year. The film was a hit with the critics as well. Vincent Canby of the New York Times called it ""an exceptionally faithful, ebullient screen equivalent to a literary work that lesser talents would embalm . . . Mr. James Ivory and Miss Ruth Prawer Jhabvala have somehow found a voice for the film not unlike that of E.M. Forster, who tells the story with as much concern as astonished amusement.""

This is a smart, intelligent film which takes its time but which never wastes time nor makes me look at my watch to see how much time is still left. It flows effortlessly for me and before I know it, Ive reached the scene which is depicted on the cover and that shows which man Lucy has picked. This isn't a stuffy, period drama. Its light, romantic and fun. Once again I cannot say it enough times, that it is one of my all-time favourite films of mine for years and one I cannot recommend enough in a heartbeat!

Blu-ray Video Quality  A Room with a View is presented in the directors preferred aspect ratio of 1.66:1. But on your Widescreen Television screen, you will see some very slim horizontal black bars either side of the image to maintain the screen format. According to notes from The Criterion Collection bonus insert, this new awesome digital transfer, which was supervised by director James Ivory and cinematographer Tony Pierce-Roberts and was created in 4K resolution on an ARRISCAN film scanner from the original 35mm camera negative. It is believed when the original camera negative was processed; it was removed from the final fixation bath too soon, resulting in Chroma hue shifting across the entire feature. Frames were slightly different even within the same shot, causing distracting colour imbalances. The restoration process involved the manual removal of thousands of instances of dirt, debris, scratches, splices and warps, using the MTTs DRS, while Digital Visions Phoenix  was used to address the Chroma hue shifting, small dirt, grain, noise management, flicker and jitter. I originally had this film on a very inferior DVD, but now with this release on the awesome stunning The Criterion Collection Blu-ray disc reaches the level of crispness, filmic quality, and vibrancy that one can always expect from a Criterion restoration. I can inform you that this is an excellent transfer that takes your breath away. This definitely gets my 10 out of 10 star rating.

Blu-ray Audio Quality  The original 2.0 surround soundtrack was remastered at a 24-bit from the 35 mm magnetic track. Clicks, thumps, hiss, hum, and crackles were manually removed using a Pro Tool HD, AudioCubes integrated workstation, and iZotope RX 4. We are informed that please make sure your Dolby Pro Logic decoding on you're A/V Receiver is properly set up to play the 2.0 surround soundtrack. The orchestral and operatic classical score has a wide dynamic breath with a lot of natural air, the dialogue is very clear and full, and the especially natural ambience of Italy and the English countryside comes through wonderfully, and you also gets some wonderful now and again brilliant surround effects, especially when you are riding in the carriages with the actors. The transfer supervisors were James Ivory, Lee Kline, and Tony Pierce-Roberts. Colour grading was done by Stephen Bearman at the Deluxe Digital in London.

Special Feature: Thought and Passion [2015] [1080p] [1.77:1] [21:20] This special informative documentary, produced by The Criterion Collection, features new interviews with James Ivory, Tony Pierce-Roberts, and costume designer John Bright, discussing the production of A Room with a View. First up we get some slightly grainy images from the film, while we get at the same time a voice over from James Ivory, who eventually reveals himself to the camera. James Ivory comments that, It is just a great romantic entertainment, and it is funny, but thats it. But I mean it also is full of romance, nice complicated romance, but it is also about sort of higher issues and knowing yourself and not lying to yourself for all kinds of wrong reasons and living life you want to live and is set in Italy and beautiful to look at and all those things added up to make something. James Ivory also talks about E.M. Fosters novel A Passage to India, which inspired him to read A Room with a View and wanting to film in Italy, and especially Florence. James Ivory also informs us that E.M. Foster was a beautiful observer of people and especially the English. But to raise the money to make the film A Room with a View James Ivory and Ismail Merchant had to go to California, and they had to visit this this mini studio owned by Sam Goldwyn and wanted to change the story, because he felt the story of Edwardian people would not interest a modern audiences and to also turn the main female character of the young lady from English to American, but Ismail Merchant was having none of it and was so persuasive in telling the outline of the story synopsis, that he secured the financing of the film. Tony Pierce-Roberts, who was involved with the classic British comedy film A Private Function, who James ivory was very impressed with the said film and was keen to have Tony on-board to work on A Room with a View because James was so impressed with his cinematography. James Ivory tells a story about his first meeting with Helena Bonham Carter, especially with her big black boots and tells James not being able to play the piano properly, but despite this James thought Helena would be perfect for the part in the film. Originally the part of Cecil Vyse was going to be Rupert Everett [YUK what a horrible thought] and James Ivory turned him down immediately as he knew he would not be perfect with any of the male characters in the film. Then James met Daniel Day-Lewis and felt he would be perfect for the character part of Cecil Vyse. James Ivory saw Julian Sands in The Killing Fields film and knew he would be perfect as the character of George Emerson. As to the actor Rupert Graves, James Ivory had never heard of him, but was recommended by his female casting director because of his part in the film MAURICE, and of course Hugh grant was also in that film and came to James for an audition, but was kicked out as James thought he was rubbish and totally not ideal for any of the male characters in the film. What was also nice to hear James Ivory say, I have always thought that in the relationships between actors and director, that directors are wide, but rather shallow, whereas actors are very contained and deep and that is how I feel. James also likes actors to give ideas about how they want to pursue their character, but sometimes James tells the actors what he wants out of the actors. Next up is John Bright and tells us that James Ivory learned a lot from Johns import into Edwardian style of clothing. John also informs that he wanted the Italian actors to be in black clothing to match their macho image. The English actors he wanted them to wear wishy washy and touristy. Where you see the three actors walking past the pond, he wanted them to be complete in white, as that gave the impression that they were angels. James also informs us that Ismail Merchant was a great promoter, as he knew lots of people in the film industry. James Ivory also informs us that he had a great relationship with his Editor named Ruth, and when the rough cut was finished, he would allow Ruth to make any comments where Ruth felt the film could be improved, but James also informed us that the Editors in America, especially in Hollywood would of never allowed James Ivory anywhere near the Editing Suite, that is why he much prefers to work in England. As we come to near the end of this special feature, James Ivory talks about the success of A Room with a View and how much money they made. And helped James Ivory and Ismail Merchant to go on to make other films like Howards End [1992]; Reamins of the Day [1993] and Jefferson in Paris [1995]. So all in all, this is a really nice extra and you hear much more entertaining snippets of information about the process of making the film A Room with a View.

Special Feature: The Eternal Yes [2015] [1080p] [1.77:1] [36:20] This special documentary, produced by The Criterion Collection is a New interviews with actors Helena Bonham Carter, Simon Callow, and Julian Sands. We first off start with clips from the start of the film, then Helena Bonham Carter informs us that before starting on A Room with a View Helena appeared in the film Lady Jane [1986], but eventually wanted to go to University, but just on the last days shooting Helena got a call to turn up for an interview with for a her part in the film A Room with a View and later on Helena found out that Ismail Merchant was not very impressed with Helena, because he felt that Helena was totally not interested, but Helena informs us that because of the film schedule of the previous film, she was very tired. Next up we have Simon Callow, who informs us that he was introduced to James and Ismail through the actress Felicity Kendell, who had worked with Simon in the stage play Amadeus and  James and Ismail wanted Simon to work on the film Heat and Dust, but sadly was too busy with his schedule work at the National Theatre in London, but eventually Simon got a call to start filming on A Room with a View where James and Ismail wanted his to play the part of the vicar, but was persuaded he would be perfect for the part and eventually was proved wrong, as he loved that part in the film. Finally, we get to hear views from Julian Sands, and talking about his part in the film, and felt the E.M. Forster novel was too old fashion, but on the other hand when he finally viewed the film, he loved everything about the film and especially his character in the film, but most of all loved being very subversive, but also at the same time being totally romantic. But when he accepted the part in the film, he also loved the idea of going to Italy to film and especially in Florence, and especially working with such talented actors, where he felt totally extraordinary and also felt at the same time like being at a wonderful magic picnic. Helena Bonham Carter reminisces about the room that she stayed in the hotel, that was just a box room with no windows, but when James ivory visited her in her room, he felt it was perfect as it was at the back of the hotel and no traffic noise outside and that Helene would have a peaceful nights rest ready for the next days shoot, whereas Dame Maggie Smith was in a sumptuous room, but outside was heavy traffic noise that would never stop, so causing a lot of disruption with sleep. But all in all, all three actors praised James Ivory, because if he liked a shot, would most of the time say nothing, which all three actors were warned in advance of his style of directing. All in all this is a brilliant special feature and also gives us a fascinating insight into the workings of how the film affected them in working on A Room with a View.

Special Feature: NBC Nightly News [1987] [480i] [1.33:1] [4:04] The NBC Nightly News excerpt, was broadcast on the 29th March, 1987, and profiles director James Ivory and producer Ismail Merchant. This was also broadcast the night before The Oscars was televised and the presenter talks about whom would likely with the small gold statue. But the presenter also talked about the outsiders who have got a lot of attention and of course these were James Ivory and Ismail Merchant, which you see talking together in front of the camera and about their experiences on the making of A Room with a View. We also get comments from Gene Siskel [Movie Critic]; Roger Ebert [Movie Critic] and Jennifer McLogan [Reporter]. All in all this was not too bad a news report, but also at the same time a typical over the top American style of reporting and especially the terrible crap quality of the video recording.

Theatrical Trailer [1986] [1080p] [1.66:1] [2:21] This is a very stylised presentation Original Theatrical Trailer for A Room with a View. Plus we have the stunning composers music in the background and you can see why audiences wanted to flock to see this very romantic Edwardian drama.

PLUS: You have a really beautiful essay by film critic and author John Pym entitled English Hearts and Italian Sunshine. You also get a section entitled About the Transfer. Finally, you get to see some wonderful beautiful colour images from the film. Stills were courtesy of Westchester Films, Inc.

BONUS: You have a New beautiful stunning printed Blu-ray cover inside out was produced and designed by F. Ron Miller.

Finally, the actors in A Room with a View [1985] is absolutely brilliant, the costumes are also totally gorgeous, the scenery is stunning and the music is so lovely. This is a totally beautiful film and the story is very intriguing and has its very sweet moments and it is a film that one can watch time after time and see lots of delightful nuances that one missed from the first viewing. The sit back and enjoy the Florentine scenery, especially the notable art direction by Gianni Quaranta and Brian Ackland-Snow. Jenny Beavan and John Brights costumes designs, that they both won an OSCAR deservedly. Tony Pierce-Roberts luminous, gleaming and utterly beautiful Florence location cinematography. And the film and all its elements are exquisitely controlled by California-born masterly directed James Ivory, who is on his finest form, sympathetically working with such ideal material. But of course when you view this film via this stunning The Criterion Collection Blu-ray disc, you will see why this film was a critical success and an Academy Awards massive winner. A Room with a View is funny, romantic, and a totally sweeping glorious story! Very Highly Recommended!

7295392,5,B00ZVBG3A4,Ignore the many nit-picking negative comments on the quality of the Criterion blu-ray transfer. If you are an ordinary movie viewer with ordinary quality equipment and not hyper-sensitive to exotic technical issues this is a spectacular cinematic experience of a spectacularly beautiful film. Every  gorgeous scene and frame come across with tremendous impact and reinforce the marvelous story-telling. Just enjoy.,1446336000,,414,5.9
7295393,5,B00ZVBG3A4,"I have watched ""Room With A View"" countless times over the years, on tape, DVD, cable, streaming, Blu-Ray. This new 4K restoration of the film gives amazing new life to the image quality. Like many recent 4K restorations it is not just a matter of added pixels and resolution but also of the added luminance and nuance that the expanded color space of the 4K standard adds, even if the image is being displayed in an 8-bit medium. Some sections of the film have a very slight flicker. This is caused by unequal fading of color in the original negative for the film due to an error at the lab with fixing the image at the time the negative was originally processed. The effect has been minimized as much as possible but was impossible to eliminate completely. Still, the benefits of the new higher resolution scan far outweigh a minor flaw that only appears in a few scenes. There's no need to go over details of the film itself. Almost anyone who wants it probably already knows it well. The added new supplemental interview feature with some of the cast members recalling the production is delightful. No matter how many times you have seen the film, or whatever other copies you may own, this is the one to have. RECOMMENDED.",1446076800,10,1227,4.581818181818182

7295395,3,B00ZVBG3A4,"A Room with a View is a lush Victorian drama that aims to carry its viewers away with breathtaking scenery, beautiful costumes, and a respected group of actors and actresses, but oddly enough, it's the forced acting that drags the film down. It could be the fault of the director (and/or possibly the fault of E. M. Forster) that too many of the characters seem implausible. Daniel Day-Lewis and Judi Dench push their roles into the realm of caricaturism with exaggerated acting while Helena Bonham Carter's performance is half-hearted, almost lackluster. Whether or not you're a fan of Rupert Graves, there's no denying that as ""Freddie"", he is positively charming and brilliant. He's fully dedicated to his role and thus proves to be a real scene-stealer. Sadly, the chemistry between Lucy (Bonham Carter) and George (Sands) isn't quite there. One can't help but think that George would rather be in Freddie's embrace.

While some refer to the Victorian era as being stuffy and oppressive, that doesn't mean that a film set in the same period has to be the same. I've seen ""A Room with a View"" twice and I can only recommend ""Howard's End"" over this piece, for it possesses all of the spirit, convincing acting, and enticing drama that this one lacks.",1444953600,,1253,4.855140186915888
