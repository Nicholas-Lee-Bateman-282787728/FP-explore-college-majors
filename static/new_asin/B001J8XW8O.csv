It is a long documentary and I was going to show part of it to my students but they (high school students) asked to watch more of it. We still didn't watch the whole thing (it is long!) but I was so impressed with how interested my students were in it. This shows the process beginning in their home countries and what they have to do to get visas and paperwork and then the challenge they face once they arrive in the USA. It also shows people coming from all different parts of the world, for very different reasons. I really enjoyed it.",1483142400,,685,4.444444444444445

This is a poignant exploration of the values, integrity, goodness and close family relationships of people who endure too much.",1314403200,,235,5.051282051282051
8312166,5,B001J8XW8O,"Here's an absolutely transformative documentary.

Why ""transformative""? Because immigration and cultural diversity are two enormously important issues right now and we need media like this documentary series that will transform our assumptions about immigrants.

Thanks to Facets Video, Gita Saedi's entire 411-minute production of ""The New Americans"" now is available now on DVD. It's well worth the investment, because Saedi spent a long time and an enormous number of miles exploring this broad spectrum of real-life stories involving immigrants.

As the main photo on the cover suggests, we learn about a poor Hispanic-American family struggling through the maze of American immigration hurdles. Their story is all the more poignant because they are trying to do all the right things in their move to America.

But there's so much more here!

We meet a prominent African family, reduced to refugee status because of their tribe's work on behalf of human rights, now trying to re-establish themselves in the U.S. The family quickly discovers problems at nearly every turn, even though Americans celebrate the kind of brave activism that wound up pushing this family toward our shores.

We also meet Dominican baseball players facing life-and-death challenges of their own. And, deep in the series we meet an Indian couple moving to the U.S. for professional work -- and discovering that American culture is quite different than what they expected.

The mother of a hopeful pro-baseball player, who lives in poverty in her own homeland, says it all: ""Poor people's dreams are very deep things.""

They are -- and so is this terrific series.",1233532800,2,1641,5.260536398467433

The films follow the lives of several new immigrants and their families, documenting the struggles they must go through in adapting to a new country and culture. Featured are a Palestinian couple, two Nigerian families, a Mexican family, a trio of baseball players from the Dominican Republic, and a couple from India.

Each of the stories is very different - some are coming here for work, some to bring their families together, some in hopes of better opportunities for the future - while at the same time they share many similarities. All must learn a new language, adjust to a new culture, and deal with racism in America. In their day-to-day lives, we see them looking for work, going to school, caring for their families, and making new friends and acquaintances. Often their preconceived ideas of the United States and what it will offer them do not match the reality, and this can be a crushing blow. This series highlights just how difficult all this can be.

The filmmakers have done a fantastic job capturing moments, and over the course of the three films, the viewer gets to the know each family quite intimately. We share in their struggles, disappointments, and dreams for the future. This is a truly eye-opening set of films. It really ought to be required viewing for high school students, as most American-born and raised people have little idea of the difficulties faced by immigrant families. I highly recommend ""The New Americans"" to students and educators alike.",1117670400,5,1629,4.877256317689531
