8537577,5,B0098753YE,My son and daughter in law purchased this video for me. It is in Danish with English subtitles. It is excellent! After viewing it I was able to visit the actual place that this written about and met the granddaughter who is running the establishment now and her son! Great food! Pleasant surroundings! I like this DVD as it portrays the fact that there were more heroes than just what we see about the military victories. TX Pen Feather,1379635200,4,436,4.531645569620253
