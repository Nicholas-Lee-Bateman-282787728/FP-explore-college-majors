I remember setting up a Bob Costa's Coast to Coast Remote broadcast from Disney ( I used to work as a broadcast engineer.) Mr. Costas asked me if I was a real Cardinal fan, who did I root for in the 68 Series. I told him that was a fair question, and I replied the Cardinals. I told him that Bob Gibson and Lou Brock were 2 of my favorite all time players. I remember getting chills up my spine whien Bob Gibson broke the strikeout record in that first game, and I also remember Curt Flood in that crucial game 7 misjuding the fly ball that gave the Tigers the series. It was a great series and I wish the whole series were available on DVD. It would also be nice in Color.",1265328000,,830,4.006024096385542
8173265,3,B000MX667Q,"This game was very important to me growing up because it was the first time I ever saw color television. I watched it with my failing grandpa. Alas, though the film was broadcast by NBC in living color the dvd is in black and white!!!!! The broadcast is just as it was by NBC except in a poor quality black and white. It is also very overpriced. This is the game in which Bob Gibson broke the WS strikeout mark besting 31 game winner--and later convicted felon--Denny McClain. It is very interesting from a baseball historical perspective but it is not in COLOR. Ironically NBC blurbs throughout the game ""broadcast in living color.""  I feel rooked.",1184630400,2,649,4.594827586206897
