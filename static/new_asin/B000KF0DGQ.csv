2688795,5,B000KF0DGQ,"U.F.C 8

A very interesting and enjoyable disc that reminds us why the early years of the Ultimate Fighting Championship are examples pure Martial Arts Gold.

Featuring the return of Ken Shamrock to Superfight action in a match against KIMO (the man credited of making Royce Gracie look human), the event was set to promise an exciting card. In the traditional Ultimate Challenge Tournement, the unstoppable Don Frye makes his memorable U.F.C debut with a hard hitting punch and the eqaully famous Gary ""Big Daddy"" Goodridge makes his own U.F.C debut in the same fashion. Sporting a black Gi Goodridge produced a remarkable performance, proving both his strength and character as Frye showed off his grappling skill and strong heart.

In a strange yet appealing sense, the U.F.C introduced it's first ""Themed"" event that promoted the small ""David"" versus the giant ""Goliath"" story. This was carried throughout the event but the initial tournement match up's were actually deliberatley styled to reflect the big man versus the small man. An interesting concept that eventually reflected this cards action and suprising outcomes.

The disc's special features include a recent interview with Don Frye and a retrospective look at U.F.C 8 by Mixed Martial Arts expert Scott Peterson. The event is a welcome addition to any U.F.C Collection and represents the best days of the organization.",1171756800,,1384,5.192825112107624

2688797,4,B000KF0DGQ,"This DVD features an 8 man tournament as well as the SuperFight between Ken Shamrock and Kimo. It is dubbed David vs. Goliath because of the huge difference in size between the competitors in the tournament. This features the first UFC appearance of both ""The Predator"" as well as ""Big Daddy.""

Quarterfinals: Don Frye vs. Thomas Ramirez- Frye makes short work of Ramirez in ten seconds, knocking him out.

Paul Varelans vs. Joe Moreira- This fight goes the distance and is a stand-up fight only. It does not go to the ground at all. Varelans wins all three judges' decisions because he was the aggressor throughout most of the fight. Moreira did get some solid hits in, but he was backing away while Varelans was moving forward.

Jerry Bohlander vs. Scott Ferrozzo- Very interesting fight here, Ferrozzo uses his size to his advantage with a lot of grappling, a couple of nice suplexes are landed and the fight goes to the ground. A lot of stalemates though as he gets Bohlander up against the fence. Bohlander comes up with the win with a tapout.

Paul Herrera vs. Gary Goodridge- Another short fight, Herrera shoots immediately but gets caught in a bad spot, and Goodridge nails him repeatedly with some nasty elbows and gets the KO.

Semi-Finals: Frye vs. Adkins*- *Varelans is replaced because of an injury and Adkins gets his spot in the tournament. Here we have a boxer vs. wrestler fight and we all know how these usually end up. Frye with an early takedown and starts throwing down punches, and Big John McCarthy stops it.

Bohlander vs. Goodridge- Nice ground fighting by both men until Goodridge nails two solid punches and McCarthy stops it.

The Superfight: Ken Shamrock vs. Kimo- This fight goes to the ground immediately. Kimo nails some solid punches but got caught in an ankle lock and taps out.

Final: Frye vs. Goodridge- Goodridge was looking good in the early portions of the fight, but made a mistake and Frye rolled him over and got control and gets a couple of short punches in. At first I thought Big John stopped it, then we see a towel thrown in the Octagon so I assume that was the reason. Either way a win for ""The Predator"" but a very nice showing by ""Big Daddy"" as well. Don Frye is the UFC 8 champion.",1166918400,2,2233,4.607052896725441
8155990,5,B000KF0DGQ,"This is definitely one of the best of the early UFC events.

As a longtime MMA fan - indeed, since I was a preteen in the mid-1990s (1995, to be exact) - I've seen the UFC through its controversial early days up until now.  177 is an example of how bloated the league has gotten, unfortunately: with at least one card every month, and with all the weight classes, you're bound to have some lesser talent showcased on the cards.  Nonetheless, the early days have the disadvantage of less well-rounded skill sets: the Thomas Ramirez/Don Frye fight on this card is an example of such.  So even though there were fewer fighters (less bloating), the skill sets weren't evenly distributed.  Which is worse: a fledgling league where fighters specialize, but aren't that well-rounded (the early UFC days), or when there are many average, well-rounded fighters without any dominance (today's UFC, especially with the retirement of Georges St. Pierre and the age of Anderson Silva)?

I can't say for sure.  All I can say is, we can weigh each card for what it is, considering all attributes, and enjoy or dislike the card either way.  With that in mind, don't assume that newer=better and thus thoughtlessly discount older UFCs just because of the more splintered skill sets.  UFC 8 is one of the best early UFCs.  Pitting David vs. Goliath, this UFC proves that it's not so much size that matters, but the skill of the fighters.

Regarding skill, it's apparent early on that Don Frye, Gary Goodridge, Ken Shamrock, Kimo, and Jerry Bohlander had skills beyond the ranks of the specialists who were looking to make their marks in the UFC's early days.  The best modern UFC fighters combine the best elements of BJJ, wrestling, Muay Thai, and basic striking to their advantage.  Yesteryear's fighters, being unsure of such advantages, tried to wing their way to the top, and yet even here back in early 1996, we see wrestling in particular making its mark (as BJJ had with Royce Gracie even earlier), along with vicious striking in the person of Don Frye, the first great striker to make an impact on UFC.

It's also great to see how quick the fighters learned.  Goodridge is well-spoken in his after-fight with Frye, praising the value of stamina.  Bohlander's wrestling prowess and age speak to the value of striking and experience.  And Frye's example speaks to the value of having veteran trainers at your side.  Even as early as 1996, fighters could see the value of being well-rounded.

It's no different now - the only difference is we have more guys training, more glitz, more glamor.  I look forward to a future UFC where there are more Silvas, more St. Pierres, more guys mixing up both again, and in greater degrees.  The UFC could take a look back here to take a step forward.  Let's always hope for the best fighters and the best fights, regardless of era, and appreciate how the best fights always transcend context, making the best use of the greatest skills no matter what the year is or who the fights are between.",1409529600,,3019,4.721374045801527

8155994,5,B000KF0DGQ,"I have seen all of the UFC's up to #50. And this one is by far my favorite. The early UFC's were filled with mismatched matches (fun to watch in there own right). This one is no exception, but it did have Gary Goodrich and Don Frye. Don would leave for Pride in a couple of shows, but he was right in the thick of UFC at this time, and he was ""The Predator"" that his nickname claimed him to be. An unstoppable rear kicking machine. Gary Goodrich was also quite the fighter at this time, even though he was basically just given the rank of third degree blackbelt by the martial arts he is claimed to be a master of. The crucifex hold where he knocked his opponent out on three elbows and then still landed six more before the ref stopped it has never been seen again. The final battle of the tournament is still my favorite fight of all time, every bit as entertaining as a well planned pro wrestling fight. A great show from before the UFC becaame more known for guys hugging it out on the ground for 20 minutes, well worth the purchase for a nice relaxed saturday afternoon of some world class head pounding.",1323216000,2,1109,4.260663507109005

The format of this tournament is a ""David vs. Goliath"" style setup, in which fighters with great skill meet fighters of enormous size and strength. It worked out perfectly, as every fight is extremely entertaining, and Gary Goodridge's elbow's will haunt my dreams forever. The superfight between Kimo and Ken Shamrock is an early UFC fight fan's dream, as it is a short, yet very exciting battle ending in a painful submission. I would highly recommend this dvd, as there is not a bad fight on the card. Also, if you do end up buying this dvd and you find yourself rooting for ""the Predator"" as much as I do, I highly recommend purchasing the dvd of Pride 21: Demolition, which features the best Don Frye fight of them all, and perhaps THE most brutal fight of all time, his war with Yoshihiro Takiyama. If you have not seen this fight, you must youtube clips of it. Like, right now. In conclusion, do yourself a favor and buy UFC 8.

DAVID VS GOLIATH

This was one of my favorites back in the day and still is to this day, I love the David vs Goliath idea.

1. DON FRYE VS THOMAS RAMIREZ-Don Frye shows exactly why they call him The Predator in this fight. This fight lasts only seconds as The Predator Don Frye lays the Goliath out with some great strikes. Excellent quick fight but very very fast. 5/5

2. JOE MOREIRA VS PAUL VARELANS-this fight lasts the entire 10 minutes which very much the opposite of the last match. Also unlike the last fight the Goliath won this via unanimous decision, Varelans. The fight was very close and is actually not boring in my opinion. 4/5

3. JERRY BOHLANDER VS SCOTT FERROZZO-Ferrozzo the Goliath in this fight starts things off nicely and dominates the lion den's fighter. Jerry tries to lock in a guillotine choke but is thrown to the floor eventually. The fight gets restarted a couple of times but then with less than a minute left Jerry finally sinks that choke and takes it for the Davids. 4.5/5

4. PAUL HERRA VS GARY GOODRIDGE-maybe even shorter than Don Frye's fight but Big Daddy and Goliath of the fight Gary destroys Paul with one of the most vicious knock outs ever. You have to see this one right here. 5/5

5. DON FRYE VS SAM ADKINS- Sam Adkins replaces Varelans due to him being injured, so here we go with the first semi final fight. Still it does not matter as Frye makes his way through this go almost as fast as the last. He takes him down and just demolishes him with some great ground and pound. Another great showing fro Frye in this one. 5/5

6. JERRY BOHLANDER vs GARY GOODRIDGE-this is an excellent fight right here as it truly is a back and forth battle. Gary starts really strong and gets him down but after a while Jerry hits a nice sweep and gets the mount and pounds away. But Gary eventually comes out on top as in position and with the win. 5/5

SUPERFIGHT
7. KEN SHAMROCK VS KIMO-excellent fight right here that shows why Ken is the World's most dangerous man. Ken is on top for a while on this one looking for the mount. Once he finally gets  it Kimo sweeps him and takes the top. But Ken being the deadly submission fighter he is he rolls into a beautiful knee bar. Great fight right here. This fight puts into place the rematch between Ken and Dan Severn who Ken beat the last time. 5/5

8. DON FRYE VS GARY GOODRIDGE-the finals of the David vs Goliath ends with a David vs Goliath fight. A very exciting fight takes place in the finals as these two really do battle. Gary slams him around and goes for big strikes while Don is more precise with his punches and ends up making big Daddy tap to strikes. There is a lot of exciting moments in this one. 5/5

This was one of my favorites from the original UFC days, I absolutely loved the David vs Goliath idea. I recommend buying this one right away.",1248134400,2,2846,4.320825515947467
