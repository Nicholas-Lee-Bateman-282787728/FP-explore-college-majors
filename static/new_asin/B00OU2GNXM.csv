6761122,5,B00OU2GNXM,I liked it. Most episodes begin with a dead body found on the beach or in the water. It is a mystery in that the killer is not revealed until the end. Like most series it does spend time on family issues which I could do without but it is not overdone.,1425772800,2,252,3.8653846153846154
6761123,4,B00OU2GNXM,"Stories are a bit repetitive in that some false suspects are identified. The two other police officers are not developed much at all.

Spoiler alert - Season I ends with wife and kids going to France and momma to Hamburg. I smell an affair coming with Emma. Wife definitely going through a mid-life crisis, while Anders seem to be absorbed by each case to the exclusion of much else. Great line when Knut sends wifey a postcard from New Zealand and says it pretty just like home... we can tell that this is not exactly comforting to the wife who has a much  more adventurous side compared to Anders.  I like the show.... some things a bit odd like why does Emma live with them for 2 years, who is the father of Emma's baby, etc.",1423872000,6,728,4.338235294117647

6761125,3,B00OU2GNXM,"This German-made cop drama is set in Gotland, the largest Swedish island in the Baltic Sea. It follows Inspector Robert Anders who is from Germany who follows his blond, blue-eyed, very attractive wife and children back to her native land. As an efficient, stoic German who is uncomfortable, if not afraid of the sea, he is a ""fish-out-of-water"" in this Swedish vacation island. He fights crime from Visby, the island's principal town and UNESCO heritage site with a female Inspector, a male sergeant and a female pathologist. Almost all  episodes  feature the sea in their plots. Despite being a ZDF (German) production and produced in the German language, the stories are take from Swedish crime writer Mari Jungstedt and have a very similar vibe to other Swedish series such as Beck, Irene Huss, Maria Wern and Wallender ( the Swedish Wallender, not the slower BBC version).

Each hour and a half episode is well-paced to hold interest and is a story unto itself, though the family backstory slows down the pace as the series goes on. About halfway through the two six-episode set his wife  is awkwardly written out and then his kids. Then Anders takes up with his wife's shorter, chunkier, and less attractive friend. Go Figure. Perhaps another reviewer who has seen and program AND read the novels can explain this.

The series takes full advantage of the beauty of the Hanseatic League city of Visby and Gotland and is a treat for the eyes. The English language subtitles cannot be tuned off, which is true for all Mhz offerings, but, at least, there are on the screen long enough to be comfortably read by most viewers. The first episode is cursed with being filmed by a hand-held camera which is only used occasionally thereafter. The shaky camera is so aggravating that, if continued, the series could not be recommended at all. Parents should be aware that there are some four-letter words spelled out in each episode, a small amount of nudity, a few sexual situations and one that is completely gratuitous. Of the German language series from Mhz International Mysteries, this is one of the better ones, but not as good as Brunetti.",1421539200,37,2142,4.841530054644808
6761126,3,B00OU2GNXM,"If you, like me, are desperate to escape the tv fare that assumes you are either barely a teenager, or a nitwit, or both, then you might well enjoy The Inspector and the Sea. A compendium of  discrete stories featuring the same lead characters, the series has just enough suspense and plausibility to be watchable without keeping you on the edge of your seat. Nordic noire, a la The Killing, The Bridge, or Borgen it is not. But it is ostensibly Swedish, albeit a German production with  German-speaking cast, and it sure as hell beats the likes of Blue Bloods!",1421539200,22,561,4.6

6761130,4,B00OU2GNXM,"You couldn't ask for a more gorgeous or atmospheric setting than Visby. This is a very good procedural, not among the very best, but good enough to enjoy, with breathtaking locations to marvel at if the story sometimes feels a bit plodding.",1460851200,,240,4.738095238095238
6761131,1,B00OU2GNXM,"The video quality is very poor, which pretty much dooms this to the re-cycle bin. The story line isn't nearly good enough to overcome that flaw. Not recommended.",1459209600,,161,4.785714285714286
6761132,5,B00OU2GNXM,"Yes, we thought that it was very good. Also very nice for relationships were one partner is German and the other English speaking since it has subtitles. The only problem with our particular season 1 set was that the first disc was mislabeled and was a duplicate of the last disc. Too bad... but the movies are very attention grabbing and very good entertainment for your evening. Season 2 had no problems and was just as entertaining and exciting. We would like to enjoy more seasons.",1458345600,,485,4.651162790697675

6761136,4,B00OU2GNXM,"Good series but quite as good as Beck, Wallander, and the other Swedish and Danish productions. But I'd like to add some information that the Amazon description doesn't give. This is, as Amazon says, a German production, in German with English subtitles. In Europe it was actually shown in two versions: Swedish and German, for those two countries. Many of the actors are Swedish, such as the great Peter Haber known for his role as Beck, others are German. Some of the Swedes played their roles in Swedish, although Haber actually played his in German. For the German version, the one Amazon is selling, German was dubbed on top of the Swedish. This is why some of the German dialogue seems out of sync. For the Swedish version, Swedish was dubbed on top of the German, which in Peter Haber's case stirred up huge controversy, because his German was dubbed in someone else's voice back into Swedish instead of his playing his role in Swedish or doing the dubbing himself.",1453593600,6,972,4.723529411764706
6761137,4,B00OU2GNXM,"This crime series is set in one of the most beautiful locations ever: Gotland in Sweden. The acting is premiere. The captions don't bother me or my husband (we enjoy hearing the German, unsere besten Freunde sind Deutsch). But there are brutal scenes of violence & especially toward animals. I won't be able to watch any more. We watched the first 3 episodes & there was a dog killed (not so brually, seen bloody after the killing). But in the last episode we watched, a horse was hacked up & its head put on a pole. Horrific, even though it went with the story line. Just can't bear seeing animals brutalized, although my husband is an actor & we know no real animals are harmed.",1449792000,7,680,4.448
6761138,4,B00OU2GNXM,"Word of warning: Two of my discs were mislabeled. At first I panicked but checked the discs and all the episodes were there, the disc labels were switched.

I enjoyed the characters and the scenery. I've read the books so it is wonderful to see the landscapes of Gotland.",1447977600,,271,4.530612244897959

6761144,2,B00OU2GNXM,"I found the scenery, although often bleak, to be the best part of this series. The family is not portrayed sentimentally. The inspector's priority is his work so he often doesn't know what is going on at home. Without him around much, his wife doesn't find her work as homemaker and midwife fulfilling and later flirts openly and dates another man. The crimes are a mystery, which does help us endure to the end. This is not for family viewing; graphic dead bodies and often nudity, with full frontal male nudity in the 2nd series. I like a lot of foreign series but should not have bought these without first seeing them.",1434672000,5,622,4.5625
6761145,5,B00OU2GNXM,I really enjoyed this German mystery series. There are English subtitles so even if you don't understand German you can enjoy the series. Lighter in tone that many of the Scandinavian mysteries that are so popular today.,1430697600,,220,4.972972972972973
6761146,5,B00OU2GNXM,"I love international mysteries, and this one was very enjoyable. It was interesting, without being to bloody or gory. The main character was believeable, which was nice .  he's not super human or a genius, just a regular guy",1430265600,2,224,4.743589743589744

8684848,3,B00OU2GNXM,"The strongest aspect of this series is the scenery.  It is beautiful and some of the homes are positively gorgeous. The storylines are the usual gory deaths of females of various ages.  Predictable in that sense.  Also predictable in that the happy family life of the lead character doesn't last.  The wife and mother of 2 young children is suddenly unsettled by a visit from an old beau who has been a nomad for 20 years.  Now nothing about her once perfect life suits her and she suddenly takes off with the 2 kids for a visit because Robert loves his work.  He loved his work when she married him and up until the old beau came for a visit she was effusively happy.  The fact that she goes off with him for a boat trip and then for movie on his last night in town was a bit much.  I can't imagine any husband worth his salt allowing his wife to date another man.  I'll watch episode of series 2 to see if things get better.  It is not awful, just not good and one needs a good story to go along with the great scenery.",1512518400,,1021,4.137055837563452
8684849,4,B00OU2GNXM,"The Inspector and the Sea, is an interesting Series. The inspector, played by Walter Sittler, is German, now settled in Gotland, an Archipelago off Sweden. He seems to be a man who wants to do everything on his own. This is a six episode series.

Inspector Robert Anders, lives by the sea, even though he is frightened of water. He lives with his wife, Line, played by Paprika Steen. She is a midwife, and both of their professions bring new people into their lives. They have two children, and part way through this series we meet Roberts divorced mother and father. Emma Winarve, one of their children's teachers and patient of Line, Emma, played by Frida Hallgren, also plays an integral part.

Throughout the six series we meet Roberts work Family, with whom he spends more time than his own family. Karin Jacobsson, played by S&oacute;lveig Arnarsd&oacute;ttir, Tatort, is Roberts main sidekick, who does a lot of the investigating. Thomas Wittberg, played by Andy Gatjen, is the new guy, but he is very intuitive and knows a great deal via his college an$ general life experience. Eva, played by Inger Nilsson, is the pathologist and is the glue that keeps them all together.

The crimes often involve women who have been murdered, but all have interesting and varied stories. Robert, as I said, is a loner and seems to make too many investigations his own and puts himself at danger.  The title of the series I found off putting, and would not have viewed the series if not for another review.

8684854,4,B00OU2GNXM,"After watching two seasons of this addictive mystery, I have concluded that a) Gotland, an island southeast of Stockholm, is a place I'd like to visit for its stunning forests and seashore and its midnight sun; b) the author of the novel on which this series is based has a problem with female characters, most of whom, even the good ones, are motivated by dark forces.

One of the most enjoyable aspects of this mystery is the backstory of the detective, his family, which includes his restless wife and two nice kids, his eccentric mother, and an engaging female friend-in-need of the family; unfortunately, this comfortable backstory, which holds the series together, goes off the rails somewhere near the beginning of the second season, for reasons that are not made clear. Characters are simply dropped mid-story (with convenient but brief explanations that do not enlighten).

Despite this, the mysteries are complex and intriguing, and I hope that there might be a third season that will explain and resolve the detective's problems satisfactorily for the viewing audience.",1470787200,,1080,5.130681818181818
