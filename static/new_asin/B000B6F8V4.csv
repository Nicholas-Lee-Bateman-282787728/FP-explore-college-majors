8082356,4,B000B6F8V4,"Ive owned two sets of these DVDs for years and decided to undertake a marathon through all of them in 2017, prepping myself with Asimovs Guide To Shakespeare (review posted simultaneously with this one) and reading Williss The BBC Shakespeare Plays (again, review posted simultaneously) as background. For a moderately experienced Shakespeare fan, it was a most worthwhile exercise.

The performances feature some legendary Shakespearean talent, but the compromises are not to be denied. First, the complicated financing of the canon constrained the productions to be undertaken in a traditional manner: principally being set either in historically accurate times, or in Shakespeares time. There was no gender-bending other than that specified by the Bard himself. This gave me no grief: one of the prime aims of the series was to introduce Shakespeare to newcomers and this constraint seemed reasonable.

Second, the series was made just around the time that home video recording was beginning to catch fire. The prime target would be expected to watch off-air, rather than enjoying, for example, the facility of watching a couple of acts tonight and time-shifting the rest to the weekend. This led to an initially hard, but later slightly softened, limit of 2h per play. Even that was regarded as risky; the received wisdom being that once one goes beyond 2h, the off-air audience falls away rapidly. This meant cuts in all the plays, and some hefty cuts in some. Again, this gave me little grief: most theatre performances and movie productions embed cuts and the BBC used experts to do this sensibly. Interestingly, the H6/R3 tetralogy all run at well over 3h, but they were broadcast in 1983, by when timeshifting had become part of everyday life.

The biggest issue for me was the constraint of shooting in a studio. With a broadcast of a live theatre performance, the television audience is essentially given a privileged seat in the theatre and experiences both the pros and cons of that. With a big budget movie, there is no sense of live performance, but the viewer is treated to a much more spectacular visual treat than could be presented in a theatre. The studio shooting is neither fish nor flesh. Theres none of the electricity of a live performance and yet the visual spectacle can be quite disappointing. How much impact this has will vary from viewer-to-viewer and play-to-play. I was never tempted to give up, although I did make a note to follow up a number of the plays by watching a more lavishly produced movie version. On the other hand, one definite glory of this series is that one gets the chance to see plays which are very rarely performed in theatres and which are generally unavailable in other media.

One final compromise, which I fully understand, was the use of talent from UK situation comedies and soap operas for many of the supporting roles. The principal aim of the series was to get newcomers watching Shakespeare and one can see the sense in pulling in viewer-friendly names from popular shows. Alas, talented though these names were in their own milieux, not all of them flourished in Shakespeare.
For all that, at about $4 per play, this is an extraordinary bargain.",1515110400,,3210,4.949907235621521
8082357,5,B000B6F8V4,I bought my set a couple of years ago from Amazon.co.uk at a very fair price with a small amount for shipping.  Region 2 discs work perfectly on my computer,1485302400,3,156,4.2
8082358,5,B000B6F8V4,"Initially the adaptations received generally negative reviews, although the reception improved somewhat as the series went on, and directors were allowed more freedom, leading to interpretations becoming more daring. Several episodes are now held in high esteem, particularly some of the traditionally lesser known and less frequently staged plays. The complete set is a popular collection, and several episodes represent the only non-theatrical production of the particular play currently available on DVD.--Wikipedia
The productions have now become the standard since it is the only complete set available by which to judge all others, the staging in the history plays is interesting as the set is aged from new to ratty and threadbare. Plus you can enjoy all the plays acted as we were intended to enjoy them.  Worth buying a PAL DVD player to enjoy.",1467244800,2,853,5.318518518518519
