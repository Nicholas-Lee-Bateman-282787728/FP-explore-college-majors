8310560,5,B001IAAJQQ,"Although this DVD is expensive, it is a fantastic journey of blunt dissection of the human brain told by a member of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology community that proves to be as valuable as the functioning brain itself.  An understanding of basic brain pathways is prerequisite, but Lennart's explanations and demonstrations prove to be necessary laboratory information for the advancement of brain research.  The presentation is comprehensive and analytical.  The DVD is an excellent complement to biopsychology, behavioral neuroscience, and medicine, too.  Brain anatomy remains an integral component into the elucidation of the functioning of the central nervous system as a member of the human organism as a whole.",1342483200,,730,5.609090909090909
8310561,5,B001IAAJQQ,"This video is incredible (and yes, the accent is thick, but still engaging. I doubt that it's British, though. Probably Ukranian/Slovakian?). Definitely worth the money. Wish I could write more to sing its praises, but I'm a first-year med student and I now have to commit all of this to memory! :)",1294790400,,298,4.75
8310562,5,B001IAAJQQ,"Except for a relative thick british accent by the narrator (no offense meant by this, please!), this is an outstanding video of the dissection of the human brain.  Strongly recommended for medical students.",1291161600,,206,5.242424242424242
