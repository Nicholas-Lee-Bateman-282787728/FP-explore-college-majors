2434984,4,B000BPL2G0,"Before the dolphin Flipper became a TV show, he started out with two movies.  This two sided disc contains both of the films made before the TV show began.

First up is ""Flipper.""  This movie tells us the story of how Flipper and Sandy Ricks (Luke Halpin) became friends.  It all started with a hurricane that hit the island in the Florida Keys were Sandy lives with his mother and fisherman father.  While his father is getting his boat fixed, Sandy and a friend find an injured dolphin.  Sandy nurses him back to health, and the two become friends.

Frankly, this movie suffered from the problem I often have with pilots, it spent so long getting the main characters into place that the resulting story was slow and boring.  Still, there were some fun scenes that made me smile and laugh.  I found it most interesting that Luke Halpin was the only actor from this movie to make it to the series.

Side two contains ""Flipper's New Adventure,"" a much better movie.  While Porter Ricks (Brian Kelly taking on the role) is away training for a new job, Sandy gets the news that their home is being reclaimed by the government.  Fearing that he will lose Flipper, Sandy sets out in a boat to find a deserted island where they can live.  Unfortunately for Sandy, the island soon becomes the home of three castaways sent their by escaped convicts.

This movie had a couple slow parts, but on the whole it moved much faster.  There were lots of great dolphin scenes in this one.  And the climax is truly thrilling.  This movie also serves as a nice transition between the first and the TV series as it sets up several things that had changed between the two.

As I mentioned, this is a two sided disc.  Each side contains one movie and the original trailers for both films.  Each side is supposed to have a Tom and Jerry short as well.  While the one on side A works, I couldn't even find the one for side B.  That was a little disappointing, but since I've never been a huge fan of the duo, it didn't bug me too much.

This disc is worth getting for the second film.  Frankly, I can imagine kids, especially those who love animals, enjoying both films.",1203638400,22,2146,4.429667519181586
2434985,3,B000BPL2G0,"The double feature DVD contains all the features of the two individual movies at about the same price as either.  This is the disc to buy if you take an interest in the stories.

Luke Halpin stars in both films as Sandy Ricks, the Florida Keys teen who befriends a dolphin, Flipper.

In ""Flipper"", Sandy's father, Porter Ricks, is having a tough time as a fisherman.  Between Red Tide and hurricane damage, cash is tight.  Setting the stage, Porter tells Sandy the ancient Greek legend of a dolphin rescuing a boy named Arion from the sea.  While Porter is away, Sandy goes spearfishing with some friends.  When Flipper and one spearfisher each get injured, Sandy helps out.  When Porter returns, friendly Flipper is doing tricks for Sandy.  Is Flipper a devourer of Ricks family income?  Does the Arion story get reenacted?  Is Flipper a keeper?  The movie goes to its expected happy ending.

The movie and the resultant TV series were so popular that ""Flipper's New Adventure"" was created.  The state of Florida has plans to develop the area.  Flipper has to go.  Sandy decides to flee in a motorboat, to accompany Flipper out into nearby Caribbean island waters.  The two find a deserted island paradise.  Then a group of escaped criminals hijack a large sailboat, marooning three English women on the island.  Sandy makes cautious friends with Penny Hopewell (played by Pamela Franklin), while keeping hidden from the others.  Then the criminals sail back.  What can Flipper and Sandy do?  There is another happy ending.

These are both enjoyable family movies.  The Elijah Wood ""Flipper"" is good too.",1187222400,12,1605,4.881040892193308

8090621,4,B000BPL2G0,"FLIPPER (1963)

Directed by James B. Clark, Flipper stars Luke Halpin as a boy in the Florida Keys who saves a dolphin and develops a relationship with the animal. Chuck Connors and Kathleen Maguire play the parents.

As far as dolphin flicks go, I prefer 2010s Beneath the Blue with cutie Caitlin Wachs, but Flipper is worthwhile as heartwarming innocuous entertainment. Its also of historical interest to observe life in Southern Florida in the early 60s. Not only do you get the dolphin, Flipper (Mitzie in real life), but you also get the kids pet pelican, Pete.

THE MOVIE RUNS 87 minutes and was shot in Grassy Key, Florida, and (studio) Miami. WRITERS: Arthur Weiss from the story by Ricou Browning & Jack Cowden.

GRADE: B-

=========================

FLIPPER'S NEW ADVENTURE (1964)

Directed by Leon Benson, Flippers New Adventure has Luke Halpin returning as teenager Sandy who runs away to an island where he discovers three female castaways, a mother and two daughters (Helen Cherry, Francesca Annis & Pamela Franklin). Meanwhile there are three escaped convicts on the loose. Brian Kelly replaces Chuck Connors as the kids father, Po.

As a family adventure/fantasy/animal flick, this sequel has even more Yeah, right moments than the first one, but I like it better because theres more human interest and sense of adventure. Luke was 16 during filming and Pamela 13. Their chemistry is real seeing as how Pamela was Lukes first girlfriend and he later traveled to England to see her, although it never morphed into anything permanent.

Its amusing to observe Sandy basically becoming a teenage Tarzan as he aids the three females: Penny (Franklin) secretly receives his help while humorously pretending to possess great survival skills to her mother & sister. The showdown with the three convicts in the last act is actually kinda thrilling for a kids adventure.

The dolphin Mitzie played Flipper in the first movie whereas Suzy performs as Flipper in this one. Right before the films release Luke confessed that Mitzie was more affectionate.

THE MOVIE RUNS 94 minutes and was shot in Bahamas and Key Biscayne & Miami, Florida. WRITER: Ivan Tors. ADDITIONAL CAST: Lloyd Battista plays the lead convict while Tom Helmore plays the Brit patriarch.
