8267241,2,B0017TFJYA,"there are two listings on Amazon - one with studio name ""Designer Skin"" which sounds like a bootleg. The only (seemingly) legit retail VHS tape I've seen was the 1989 Ray Bren Productions, and the recording had a technical problem near the end. Video content flickered and overlapped with itself during the ski chase. I don't know if all their copies had these glitches or not.",1419724800,2,377,4.7272727272727275
8267242,5,B0017TFJYA,Very well written story. The made for television movies of the 1970s were a good time for all. Nice stories with little violence and gore and a bevy of terrific actors. I give this little unknown gem a thumbs up.,1383091200,,212,4.325
