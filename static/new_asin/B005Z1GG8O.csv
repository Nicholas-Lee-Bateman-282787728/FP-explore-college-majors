8489387,4,B005Z1GG8O,"Be reasonable, no one can make this music easy to play for you, it takes practice and work. But for a simple DVD, at this price, I think Andy gives us  insight and useful riffs. It's not a full note by note of Crossroads, but it is a fun, interesting look at Robert Johnson and Clapton's versions.
I am happy I bought this and will work on some of the licks incorporating them into my own playing style.",1432252800,,403,4.166666666666667
8489388,4,B005Z1GG8O,"It was fun, interesting, and informative, although I already knew some of Crossroads already. The study of position playing , and some of Eric's licks was helpful, but I was a bit disappointed it didn't explore his playing style more. This however was balanced somewhat by the fact that more time was spent on Robert Johnson's style and technique than I expected it's amazing how open tunings such as used by Johnson can create such a beautiful sound.",1393804800,,451,4.794871794871795
8489389,2,B005Z1GG8O,I thought the instructor had the riffs down pretty good but all he pretty much did was go over boring scales.  His Robert Johnson version of Crossroads wasn't the best I've heard and he totally copped out on teaching the Clapton version.  He went over how to play the intro (easy) but when he came to the soloing he brushed it off by saying that this is something  we (the customers who bought this lousy DVD) could figure out on our own.  There are two PDFs included that are just the boring scales he went over.  None of the solos are tabbed.  A total rip!,1393459200,3,558,4.266666666666667
