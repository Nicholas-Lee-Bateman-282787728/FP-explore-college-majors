8231641,4,B00004R7F0,"There are three stories on this independently-done tape, a sort of anthology type. The first, 'The Strange Case of Ezra Bumble' is dark but funny, with a really cute girl. Barry King is really good as the  blackmailing homosexual. The main actor is a little wooden, but I get the  feeling he's supposed to be!
The second tale, 'Bothered' is much darker  and graphic. The mood is great and the end has a definite twist to it.  Horror fans may like this one the best, but my favorite is definitely the  third tale, 'Homecoming'. It's a creepy tale of Larry, a guy who's lost in  the countryside and quickly gets involved with ghosts who may be something  more than they seem.
All in all, a good bargain for the money and well  worth watching repeatedly. I recommend it.",964396800,2,767,4.507246376811594
8231642,4,B00004R7F0,"With three seperate stories, ""Realm of the Bizarre"" manages to create three different moods. ""The Strange Case of Ezra Bumble"" is the first story and probably the best. Its fast paced, the girl in it is  very sexy and its really funny. One of the highlights is Barry King who  plays the blackmailing homosexual friend of Ezra. This  is followed by  ""Bothered"" which is completely opposite in terms of mood. This  story is very dark and moody that the viewer can't help but be drawn into.  A bit slow at times but still nicely done. Lastly, is  ""Homecoming"". From the opening scene as the bare feet walk out of  the graveyard, you know you're in for a wild ride. Featuring Barry King  again as Larry Fine, this tale of ghosts and invisible dogs will have you  guessing right up to the end. Overall, I really liked ""Realm of the  Bizarre"" and was impressed with the quality of the stories and the  video work. I could tell these folks enjoyed making this tape and it comes  through on screen. I look forward to the next release from E.I. and  Dept. 13. Pick up a copy, you won't be disappointed!",951091200,2,1093,4.454545454545454
