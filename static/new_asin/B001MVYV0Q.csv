8322186,5,B001MVYV0Q,"Conductor Andrew Davis provides entertaining and insightful comments on Elgar's glorious Enigma Variations by elucidating the inspirations behind each variation. Though the modern-day re-enactments are a tad jarring, the music is so gorgeous that it hardly matters. After the piece is taken apart, one can also watch a full, uninterrupted performance of the entire work.",1427241600,,370,5.745454545454545

8322189,5,B001MVYV0Q,"Elgar's Enigma Variations is beautiful by itself, but this presentation of ""the meaning"" of the piece is exceptional.  Filmed and recorded in the cathedral and in the surrounding countryside of Elgar's hometown (Winchester, I believe), it features Sir Andrew Davis narrating what is know about this enigma.  Includes the ""Nimrod"" movement, one most people relate to a tune of mourning and sorrow, but I find hopeful and up-lifting.  Also features the music and video without the narration.  This ia ""a must-have"" for anyone interested in British classical music.",1250553600,7,562,5.3522727272727275
