To make matters worse, his brother, Sinclair, appears to have it all. He has a perfect stinger and is a world-renowned explorer, but he lacks one thing. He can not fly. Together, they use their special talents to hunt for lost treasure with their father's map.

All in all I have to say I enjoyed watching this with my 3 year old son. I don't know if he quite got the message, but he sure did like the bugs. It's based on Psalm 139: Verses 13-14: ""For you created my inmost being; you knit me together in my mother's womb. I praise you because I am fearfully and wonderfully made; your works are wonderful, I know that full well."" What a great message for kids and adults alike!",1236124800,,842,4.397435897435898
3777804,4,B001RPYU12,"I received Seeter and the Mystery of the Lost Mosquito treasure today to review. This animated DVD is a part Max Lucado's Hermit and Friends series. The animation is very well done and the message is priceless.

Skeeter is a mosquito who has a crooked nose that stands out for all his friends and acquaintances to see.  He also has a poor sense of direction which causes problems and the two not so perfect characteristics are the blunt of jokes by his friends at times.

To make things worse his brother, Mr Sinclair M Skeeto,  who is a world famous adventurer is perceived as Mr Perfect.  Skeeter lives under the cloud that his father loved his brother best because he was perfect and could do nothing wrong while Skeeter had a crooked nose and could do nothing right.

This animated adventure unfolds the truth that everyone has their own weakness and talents and that God makes no mistakes.  When we perceive our worth through our weaknesses or through what the world says we will believe we have no worth, but if we perceive ourselves through God's eyes then we know we have much worth. It also gives a great lesson that we need each other and each one of us has what the other needs to open  doors in their lives.

I would recommend this DVD to all those with children ages pre-school to 8 years. I can't wait for my youngest grandchildren to watch it.",1236124800,,1358,4.487804878048781
3777805,5,B001RPYU12,"I was excited to watch the new Hermie video with the kids for our movie night.  Having seen a couple of the other Hermie & Friends, I knew Skeeter and the Mystery of the Lost Mosquito Treasure was going to be good.  And I was not disappointed.  Beyond the lesson it teaches, about being unique, it was plain fun to watch.

Like all good animated movies it has entertainment for both the kid and the adult.  One of my favorite parts was when Sinclair presents his presentation to the garden friends.  His pictures are being projected onto a sheet of paper which reads, ""From the desk of Max Lucado.""  Beyond the little bits of humor, parents will also love the message on how God designs each of us unique, and our differences do not make us less worthy than someone else.

The DVD also includes a fun, little cartoon short, ""Hermie Had a Little Lamb,"" along with other extras.  There are coloring pages, a sing-along, a trivia game and a recipe for a fun dessert to make with your kids.  I highly recommend Skeeter and the Mystery of the Lost Mosquito Treasure to anyone with toddlers in their house.  You might even want to use your kids as an excuse to watch it yourself.",1235779200,,1173,4.434579439252336

I love how Max Lucado can teach a Biblical precept in story form.  Learning these lessons through quality entertainment is a great way to reach the younger generation.  Some of the truths weaved into this story are that God made is who we are, God is always here, and God loves us just the way we are.  Sometimes I need to hear these truths as much as my children.

Both my 7 and 10 year olds enjoyed the DVD.  My 10 year old thought that the cartoon short was weird, but he still liked the Skeeter story saying that it was kind of like real life.  I am glad that he can translate these entertaining stories to his own life.

Surprisingly, my 2  year old sat and watched the entire feature with me. I did not think it would hold her attention, but she seemed to enjoy it. Obviously, at 2 , I'm sure she did not understand the main lesson - uniqueness.

Skeeter, a mosquito with a crooked stinger, has always felt badly that his stinger gives him a bad sense of direction and gets him lost. While Skeeter has a crooked stinger, his brother has a perfectly straight one and has been on all kinds of exciting adventures. Skeeter has always believed that his dad liked his brother better... Skeeter's brother, Sinclair M. Skeeto, arrives in the garden to the awe and adoration of all the other insects. Sinclair is on a treasure hunt...and needs help! Much to Sinclair's dismay, the only one who can help him is Skeeter.

Working together, the two brothers realize that God made each of them special...and that their dad loved each of them for his own uniqueness.

My only real complaint of the DVD is trivial to most, I'm sure. John O'Hurley, who I cannot stand, is the voice of Sinclair M. Skeeto. Drove me crazy and I wished to hurry through the story! However, Tim Conway fits his ""Hermie"" character quite perfectly. The DVD also contains bonus features, like a trivia game, silly nursery rhyme song, and a look into how sound gets into a movie.

In a day and age where appropriate television is hard, if not impossible at times, to find, Skeeter and the Mystery of the Lost Mosquito Treasure is fairly safe. Our family is quite strict with what we allow ourselves to watch. Being a ""Christian"" based movie does not always mean that it is appropriate, either. I am not sure that the voice actors are ""Christians"" and it always bothers me when they are cast in such movies. Each family must use discernment in their viewing habits - whether for the child or adult!",1235692800,,1943,4.601156069364162

Max Lucado's Hermie and Friends
Thomas Nelson
DVD

Skeeter isn't overly excited when he learns that his big brother Sinclair is returning to the garden for a visit. After all, Sinclair is a world famous adventurer, and he is practically perfect. Skeeter, on the other hand, has a crooked stinger, and he feels that everyone makes fun of him because he is far from perfect.

When the garden gang is in awe of Sinclair and fawn all over him, Skeeter isn't sure what to think. But then he learns that Sinclair has returned in search of a treasure that he believes is hidden somewhere in their garden.

Sinclair can't find it anywhere, and he needs Skeeter to help him.

SKEETER AND THE MYSTERY OF THE LOST MOSQUITO TREASURE is about being unique, and it really presents this message in a way that is sure to appeal to young kids. My three-year-old and six-year-old sat enthralled by the story line, though it didn't have the same reaction on my teenagers! They found the whole concept stupid and irritating!

While this DVD may not appeal to teens (and adults) it does appeal to the littler set, and teaches them a valuable lesson as well. This DVD includes special bonus materials. Approximate running time is 60 minutes.  Pick up a copy of SKEETER AND THE MYSTERY OF THE LOST MOSQUITO TREASURE DVD for your favorite preschooler today.

3777809,4,B001RPYU12,"Skeeter and the Mystery of the Lost Mosquito Treasure is a Max Lucado feature based on Psalm 139:13-14 which says ""13 You formed my inmost being; you knit me in my mother's womb. 14 I praise you, so wonderfully you made me; wonderful are your works!"" (NAB).

The video starts with Lucado talking to Hermie, a caterpillar, about his (Lucado's) big nose and how he wishes it was smaller. He feels sure everyone notices his huge nose. Hermie tells him that maybe they are looking at Lucado's wonderful earlobes instead. Then the show starts.

The cartoon part of the show is about two brothers, Skeeter and Sinclair, who are both mosquitoes. Sinclair is world famous and is costumed a la ""Raiders of the Lost Ark"". He is a world traveler and adventurer. He is returning to his hometown to give a talk and all the ladies are crazy about him. In his hometown lives his brother, Skeeter, who has a crooked stinger--but an excellent sense of smell. Skeeter is klutzy and has an awful sense of direction. He is envious of his brother.

 SPOILER ALERT!!!! (In case any pre-schoolers are reading this)

When Sinclair returns the two brothers head off on a hunt for a treasure their father left them. During the course of the quest we discover Sinclair's secret--he can't fly. Working together the two brothers find the treasure--and they need both Sinclair's straight singer and Skeeter's crooked one to open it. The treasure is a letter from their dad telling them he loved them both just the way they were--and a box of their favorite treats.

My four year old liked the movie, but didn't understand the point it was trying to make. My thirteen year old said it was one of the dumber movies she's seen (she was in the room playing on the computer while her sister and I were screening the movie). I thought it was cute and the pre-show with Max Lucado reminded me of Mr. Rogers talking to the puppets in his house before going to the Land of Make-Believe. Given the opinions of the females in my house, I'd say the movie would be great for kids from about 4-8; and definitely not right for a 13 year old.",1235606400,,2096,4.546419098143236

Skeeter and the Mystery of the Lost Mosquito Treasure is a prime example of teaching ourselves and our children that it is okay to be different in the world today.

This quaint little story line is all about two brothers who are different in more ways than one.  Even though, they are both mesquites, one brother has a straight nose and a sense of adventure.  The second brother, whose nose is crocked, can't find his way around the garden without getting lost.  Together they pair and find out that their differences are what make them unique and special.

The important lesson in this story - We are all special and uniquely made.  Those unique qualities set us apart from anyone else, and allow others to love us in different ways, special ways, heartfelt ways then someone else.

If you have someone unique in your life, a child perhaps, this movie is a great way to show them how important they are not only to you, but also to God, and the world around us.",1235606400,,1135,4.5024390243902435

My youngest who is 10 enjoyed the movie. She is tinkering on not enjoying cartoons as much. She enjoyed the content and lessons learned. Skeeter is another Hermie and Friends cartoon. This particular one is on Being Unique. The leasson is based on Paslm 139:13 and 14. We were all designed by God. We each bring our own ""uniqueness"" into God's plan for our lives. We were not an accident. We all have something to bring to the table! The colors in the movie are wonderful, and the voices to boot!

Voices of each character include the likes of John O'Hurley...I think he was on Dancing with the stars a season or two ago! Funny man Tim Conway as the character Hermie, Robb Pottorf and Melissa Disney.

The movie running time about 60 minutes. Just long enough for little ones to sit and enjoy the movie. This is good quality TV watching verses other stuff that our little ones may be tempted to watch. Your little ones are sure to enjoy this movie. Max Lucado is one very talented man!

In Minnesota we all know about pesky Mosquitos...you are sure to get a kick out of Sinclair the mosquito. There is a little treasure map and a little adventure/mystery. You are sure to realize that even mosquitos have a place in our world. God must have created them for a purpose!

I felt at times that the story line dragged and I was losing interest but then I'm not the target audience. I would imagine that this DVD (and others in the series) is best suited for 3-9 year old children. The music sequence was not catchy enough that I remembered the words but maybe a child would since they would watch the story over and over again.

First of all, Max Lucado has been instrumental in my walk with Christ.  When I first became a Christian, Lucado's books help to reveal God's heart for me.  I am thankful for the wisdom God has allowed Max to share with thousands of people.  When I discovered several years later that Max Lucado was involved in children's ministry through books and movies I was very excited.

Hermie's friend Skeeter has a crooked stinger.  This causes him to feel inferior to other mosquitoes, especially his brother Sinclair, who seems to be perfect in every way.  Sinclair has come home to find a treasure hidden by the mosquitos' father.  Skeeter wants to help, but is not sure if his stinger can lead the adventurers to the treasure.

This movie is very sweet.  It teaches us that God makes all unique, and he thinks that we are perfect just the way we are.  It also teaches us not to compare ourselves with others. Believing God loves us can help overcome feelings of insecurity and self-doubt.

My children really like this movie, and ask to watch it often.  We also like the recipe that is included as a bonus.

3777816,4,B001RPYU12,"DVD Review for Skeeter and the Mystery of the Lost Mosquito Treasure

Adorable!! There is really no other way to describe this kid's movie. This movie is all about learning to love yourself for who you are and realizing that God created you for a purpose. It also stresses that everyone is unique and has things they don't like about themselves. Often it is those things we don't like or understand, that make us special. It addresses everything from living in someone's shadows, arrogance, and seeing past our insecurities.

All the character were fun and charming. There is bound to be one that your kids will relate to. There is Skeeter who can't see past his imperfections and is constantly reminded of them by everyone around. There is the lovable Hermie who is always around to help out. Finally, there is Sinclair who seems to have everything but has hidden insecurities nobody know about.

Included are several bonus materials. There is everything you would need to make this into a Sunday School lesson or to watch with your kids at home. There are trivia games, coloring sheets, and short films.

I highly recommend this to anyone that has small children at home or works with kids. It is a great resource

Along the way, they learn that no one is perfect and that it's okay to be different and that it is important to work together. This led to some great conversations with my boys (6 and 8) who have different interests and talents and sometimes have problems with sibling rivalry. My younger kids (2 and 4) also enjoyed the DVD and wanted to watch it over and over.

The cute, animated characters and fun, lively music were hits with the kids and I loved the message it shared. I loved how the brothers had to work together and learn that God gave them their specific talents for a reason. Skeeter portrays an important message in a way kids will remember.

3777818,4,B001RPYU12,"Okay, so I watched this flick with the kids the other day and thought I'd share some thoughts on it. It's a short animated film for children. The plotline basically centers on two brothers, Skeeter and Sinclair, who are very different in makeup, with Skeeter feeling inferior to his adventurous brother Sir Sinclair. Without giving away the entire story, I will summarize by  stating that these two brothers need to find a treasure and realize that they need one another. They realize that their unique gifts actually complement one another.

Though the story is an advertised reinfircement of Psalm 139, where we are told that God uniquely makes each person, it is also a basic reminder of 1 Corinthians 12, where Paul likens the Church to a body with various parts. The Corinthian Church struggled with various issues, one of which was a galvanizing superiority among some who were rich or endowed with certain Spiritual gifts. Paul essentially says that God is sovereign in the distribution of Spiritual gifts and that none should boast over whatever gifts they have. We need each other in the Body of Christ and I can personally attest to how I have been most edified at times from certain saints in the Church who had what some would consider insignificant gifts. This story reminded me of the beauty of seeing two people complement each other in a common goal. I commend the story for kids and pray that all kids would realize that they are all uniquely gifted and I pray that those tempted toward bullying would refrain in light of the fact that God made us as we are.",1238371200,,1575,4.723636363636364
3777819,5,B001RPYU12,"Several years ago our family was introduced to Max Lucado's Hermie & Friends series. So, when the opportunity came along to write a review for a recent episode, I was quite excited.

In Skeeter and the Mystery of the Lost Mosquito Treasure, Hermie's friend Skeeter Skeeto learns that God didn't make a mistake when He created him with a crooked nose. in the midst of a treasure-hunting adventure, he also discovers that his ""perfect"" and famous brother Sir Sinclair M. Skeeto is not quite as perfect as Skeeter had always believed. Together the brothers finally understand that they both are special just the way God made them, and they are loved as such as well.

The story lives up well to the standard of Hermie & Friends. The message is presented very clearly, but not stiffly, and the story line held the interest of my children (girls aged 7 and 5 and boy aged 2) all the way through. They laughed and laughed at the silly antics of Hermie and his friends, and they urged Skeeter to use his own gifts and talents to find the treasure they sought.

Once the feature film ended, there was a cartoon short called ""Hermie Had a Little Lamb."" Although it was cute and comical, my kids didn't seem to get into it all that well. They began to break away from tv time and move on to other things, glancing back occasionally to see what was going on.  It was fine as an ""extra,"" but it is not strong as a selling point, and I doubt we'll watch it all that often.

It is important to keep in mind that Skeeter and the Mystery of the Lost Mosquito Treasure, as with all of Max Lucado's Hermie & Friends episodes, has a strong Biblical message and Christian perspective.  As a parent, I am very conscientious of what my children learn from all they read and watch, and I want to know that books and movies that claim to have a Christian perspective are well-grounded and firmly rooted in Scripture.  This Hermie episode definitely fit the bill.  It was a well-made story with a good, solid lesson for children. I'm delighted to have it in our video library!",1238284800,,2051,4.479892761394102

But when his famous older brother comes to town with a treasure map, the brother's must work together to find the treasure.  In the process they find that God made them unique for a reason and that God doesn't make mistakes.

The moral is good, the story is cute, but I have to say the pace of this little video was S.L.O.W.  And the humor (or attempts at humor) was not clicking with me... at all.  If it were up to me, I would never watch it again.  But then, I'm not exactly in the target audience.

When the video was over I asked my kids what they thought.  My three-year-old immediately replied, ""I want to watch it again.""  A positive review.

My five year old did not.  When I asked her why she said the part where they got lost was scary.  Honestly, I don't know what she was talking about; this movie is the opposite of scary.  In my attempt to get a logical response I asked her what she learned from the movie.  She replied, ""Everyone is not perfect because that is how God made us.""

If you are looking for a video with a good message, Skeeter and the Mystery of the Lost Mosquito Treasure definitely fits the bill.

Max Lucado, with the help of a caterpillar named Hermie, and his friends, does a superb job of illustrating this point for children.

Skeeter is a mosquito that is ashamed of his crooked stinger. His brother has a straight stinger, and is a great adventurer. When Skeeter's brother, shows up, as the hero, in the garden where Skeeter lives with his friends, things get a little tough. Skeeter has always felt that their father looked down on him because of his crooked stinger. However, throughout the story it is discovered that, Skeeter's brother cannot fly due to small wings. The brothers are led on a treasure hunt that their father had left them.

They are led to a treasure that reveals to them the truth of Psalm 139:13-14.

If you are not familiar with the Hermie & Friends Series you've been missing out. The animated cartoon series is based on biblical principals and told in a way that is both entertaining and easily understood by young children.

  For you created my inmost being;
  you knit me together in my mother's womb.

  I praise you because I am fearfully and wonderfully made;
  your works are wonderful,

Skeeter (a mosquito) feels that his famous brother, Sir Sinclair M. Skeeto, can do no wrong with his perfect stinger and sense of direction to match while poor Skeeter has a zig zag nose that he cannot straighten no matter what he does and to make matters worse he is always getting lost. When Skeeter's brother brings a mysterious treasure map left by their father to the garden he is understandably less than thrilled as he sadly watches all of his friends fawn over his perfect brother.

Yet things turn around for Skeeter as he joins his brother on the hunt for the secret treasure and discovers his own gift as well as his brother's less-than-perfect secret.

We just watched ""Skeeter and the Mystery of the Lost Mosquito Treasure"" and loved it!  It is a dvd based on Max Lucado's Hermie and Friends series and it is adorable.  After watching this dvd, I could not help but look at the other ones in the series as I am sure they are all as wonderful as this one.

The theme of this cartoon movie is ""Being Unique"" and it is such a great display of showing that it is okay to be different.  I remember I was a little eccentric as a child and my mom would always say ""Be yourself"" and ""There is nothing wrong with being unique.""

The video is about two brothers, Skeeter and Sir Sinclair, who couldn't be more different.  Skeeter is overshadowed by his ""perfect"" brother Sir Sinclair M. Skeeto, the world famous adventurer, whom everyone loves and is in awe of.  They are in search of a treasure that is on a treasure map left to them by their father.  The two brothers each realize their strengths and work together.  Aidan loves this dvd as not only is it featuring cartoon bugs but it does have some action.  I would say this dvd is perfect for any child 2 and up, although Aidan is 26 months and doesn't understand just yet the theme, but that's okay because some day he will hopefully!

This 60-minute long dvd not only has wonderful animation, but it also features the voices of some favorite celebrities:  John O'Hurley, Tim Conway, Rob Pottorf, and Melissa Disney.  When you are done watching the dvd, there are also some neat special features when you play it on the computer.  Kids can sing along to ""Super Skeeter,"" save their own computer wallpapers, print coloring pages, watch short films about Hermie, play a trivia game and more!",1237766400,,1918,4.421652421652421

Skeeter thinks his brother's perfect. His brother has spent much of his life hiding a secret of his own, while becoming famous.  Their father left them both a secret that requires their cooperation in working together.  The father affirms each brother for their uniqueness and differences.
My three girls were glued to the T.V while it played. Wild cheering followed the end of the movie when a monumental discovery was discovered.  Each child connected with the characters.
Produced by Thomas Nelson, this DVD  is # 12 in the series about Hermie and friends.  I enjoyed the fact that it opened conversational dialogue with my children to talk about our differences. God talks directly to Skeeter in this DVD, providing more opportunity for conversation with our children.  The running time for this DVD is just under 60 minutes and is well worth the price.

Publisher: Thomas Nelson
Running Time:  60 minutes including bonus features

Story: From DVD back cover:  ""Skeeter can't do anything right. But his famous brother can do no wrong. Which will find the treasure? Skeeter's ""perfect"" brother Sir Sinclair M. Skeeto, the world famous adventurer, comes to the garden with a mysterious treasure map left by their father. All the garden gang are in awe of Sinclair, and fawn all over him. But could it really be up to wrong-way Skeeter and his crooked stinger to solve the mystery of the treasure's location? Lesson is based on Psalm 139:13-14.""

Production Quality: Bright and vivid computer animation. The backgrounds were well done, but no lavish.

Music: The background music and songs were very upbeat. My son and daughter were dancing at the start of the movie. There was a chirping bird sound in the background that was a little annoying during most of the scenes.

Story: There were several unique insect characters that helped to serve as the basis of this story. I enjoyed how God spoke directly to the characters at one point in the film. The movie did an excellent job showing the importance of each persons special talents and skills God has given them. The voice acting was excellent and enjoyable.

Kids Viewpoint: My four year old stayed in rapt attention throughout the whole film. She said she liked when the two brothers used teamwork to solve the mystery!

DVD extras: Mary had a little Lamb was added to the end of the main Skeeter movie, but really should have been included as bonus material on the DVD. It seemed a little thrown together and not funny or creative like the main film. Bonus features include: A trivia quiz, the sounds of Hermie (shows how/what sounds were used in the movie. I found this very interesting), a sing-along, and quite a bit of DVD ROM for computer stuff.

Final opinion: This DVD had great animation, good music, unique characters, and an amazing story. There were a couple twists and turns that were unique and original. The length of the film seemed just right for adults and young children. I would recommend this for children (and adults) of all ages!  Psalm 139:13-14 - ""For you created my inmost being; you knit me together in my mother's womb. I praise you because I am fearfully and wonderfully made your works are wonderful, I know that full well."" (NIV)

3777828,5,B001RPYU12,"I recently requested Skeeter and the Mystery of the Lost Mosquito Treasure from the Thomas Nelson book review site. This was a cute video from the Max Lucado's Hermie & Friends series. In this video, Skeeter's brother Sir Sinclair M Skeeto is perfect, at least in Skeeter's eyes. All of Skeeter's life, he has wished he could be like his brother. Instead, Skeeter has a crooked nose, crooked antennae, and has no sense of direction. Sir Sinclair M. Skeeto is a world famous adventurer who arrives at the garden with a mystery treasure map left by their father. The brothers must work together to find the answer to the mystery. In their quest, they discover that both of them have unique qualities...Sir Sinclair M. Skeeto has tiny wings and is afraid to fly, but is very adventurous, which Skeeter loves to fly but has no sense of direction. So they help each other out. When they finally find their treasure, they realize their dad loved each one of them just as they were, crooked nose and tiny wings.

This was a cute movie. My little girl didn't sit still long enough to watch all of it, but I enjoyed it! I think the message it conveyed was a great one, especially in this day and age where is seems everyone is judged by their looks and abilities.",1237248000,,1254,4.524229074889868
3777829,4,B001RPYU12,"When Skeeter the mosquito hears that the great Sir Sinclair M. Skeeto is coming to town, he's less than thrilled. For Sir Sinclair M. is Skeeter's talented and famous older brother -- the brother that Skeeter knows their dad loved best because of his straight stinger and great sense of direction. Skeeter, on the other hand, has a zig-zag stinger which won't go straight no matter what he does. He also gets lost a lot.

However, when Sir Sinclair shows up it turns out Skeeter is the only one who can help him on his current quest. As they work together they make some life-changing discoveries in this newest DVD in the Max Lucado Hermie and Friends series Skeeter and the Mystery of the Lost Mosquito Treasure.

This wise and imaginative Max Lucado story translates into a fun movie. The colors are gorgeous, the animation smooth, and the lovable characters come to life through the voices of John O'Hurley, Tim Conway, Rob Pottorf, and Melissa Disney. The quick-moving action, humorous dialogue, and lively music will have your kids - toddlers to elementary age - asking to see it again and again. Even adults can benefit from repeated hearings of God's message about the value of uniqueness to these little creatures: ""It doesn't matter what others think of you. It only matters what I think of you. And I think you're just right.""

DVD extras include a rejigged version of ""Mary Had a Little Lamb"" for the youngest set, and for kids of all ages a quiz (with some multiple choice answers sure to coax a chuckle out of the adults), an explanation of the audio part of movie-making, a sing-a-long, and the recipe for Ooey Gooey Butter Cakes (but how much is a ""a stick of butter, a box of sugar""?).

Skeeter and the Mystery of the Lost Mosquito Treasure would be a wonderful addition to a children's church library.  It's part of a series of dvds by Max Lucado, that help teach about morals to young children.  I think I would enjoy seeing some of the other dvds also.

My son who is 19 months seemed to think it was cute.  My older son, who is almost 12, thought it was kind of boring, though.  I think it would be better for kids under 10.

It is the story of brothers and how different they are and how special each of them are.  One of the brothers, who are mosquitos, seems to be perfect and everyone loves him.  However, the other brother has a very crooked stinger. He feels unloved and he can't even fly straight.  The perfect brother is in search of a treasure, but needs help from someone.  The only person who ends up being able to help him is his brother with the crooked stinger.

The story is based a couple verses from Psalms about being unique.  It is a great story to watch with young kids.  The dvd opens up time for discussion with kids about values and how everyone is special in their own way.  I would recommend this to anyone with small children.  It would especially be a great dvd for a church.",1237161600,,1443,4.925311203319502

This DVD is in the Hermie & Friends collection, and has the voice talent of John O'Hurley, Tim Conway, Rob Pottorf, and Melissa Disney. The whole lesson of the movie is based on Psalm 139:13-14, and it teaches the viewer about being uniquely made by God. Throughout the 30 minute movie, the main character, Skeeter, struggles with his imperfections, compares himself to others (mainly his 'perfect' brother), looks for approval from his family, and then finally realizes that God has made him unique. There is an adventure woven into these lessons, and I think kids pre-school age and up would enjoy this DVD! It has bright, colorful graphics that are eye-catching. The characters are fun to watch, and I think the story would hold the attention of a younger audience. There are also several bonus features on the DVD. It has Trivia Games and a Quiz that would help implement the ideas after watching the movie. It also has a few short films, coloring pages, and a sing-along, among other things.

He doesn't realize the significance of the symboland continues on. Once he gets to the garden he learns that Sir Sinclair M. Skeeto is scheduled to visit and share his tales of great adventure with everyone.

Sinclair is Skeeter's brother and Skeeter is none to happy that he's visiting. Sinclair has always made Skeeter feel ashamed about his crooked nose. Once Sinclair arrives the real truth behind his visit is revealed. Sinclair is looking for a treasure and the only clue he has is a mysterious symbol. Skeeter remembers seeing it but doesn't remember where and they begin the search.

During the search Skeeter learns the truth. All the time Skeeter felt ashamed of his crooked nose he thought their father loved Sinclair more. On the other hand Sinclair can't fly and because of that he thought their father always loved Skeeter more.

Once they find the tree with the symbol they work together to unlock the hiding place and find a surprise from their father worth more than all the treasure in the world.

This was a great family DVD. The moral of the story is to love yourself no matter how you look and this is taught subtly with entertainment instead of a lesson.

When it takes both Skeeter and his brother to unlock the secret of the treasure they both realize that each of them is unique and special in his own way.

The cute creatures and the outstanding acting of the talents behind the voices add to the lesson about each one of us being designed by God.

Neither of us had seen any other Hermie & Friends DVDs, but we both enjoyed this one so much that'll we'll definitely be on the lookout for more! I picked this DVD out to review because Jason and I are trying hard to get more wholesome, uplifting books, music, and movies into our family ... and, of course, I had the children in mind with this pick too.
Skeeter and the Mystery of the Lost Mosquito Treasure is about being different and how it's ok to be unique. It teaches children that God doesn't make mistakes when He creates something -- and that means us, as people, too. I think this movie had a great message ... especially in a world that screams that girls should be thin and perfect and every little outward `imperfection' can be fixed or removed.
Seeing how this is a children's item, I thought I'd get Gabriella opinion on it too. She loved it. Wanted to watch it again right after we were done, actually. Makes this Momma happy that we found something better than Barbie!

It is a Christian based cartoon about a mosquito who thinks there is something wrong with the way he looks, but later finds out that he is just unique. At the beginning Skeeter does not like the way his nose looks, he is very self conscious about it thinking that no one likes him because of his nose. Skeeter also learns he is not the only one unique but everybody is unique in their own way. As the story of the movie goes on he learns that his brother's nose may be straight but his brothers wings are to short to fly. The moral of the movie is you should not worry about what others think of you bet only what god thinks of you. This DVD is perfect for young children and preteens. Skeeter the mosquito teaches children it is okay to be different! The story is based on the Bible verses Psalm 139:13-14 where God created us all unique.

I really like how it incorporated Max Lucado in the beginning about not liking his nose because he thinks it is too big.  Everyone has things about themselves that they don't like, but God in Heaven loves us just the way we are!  How wonderful a theme for a DVD can you get?
The story concluded with Hermie and his friends, including bringing back past characters such as Busby and Wormie, attempting to act out nursery rhymes.  Overall it was a very good DVD.  There was one part of the DVD that bothered me a little.  At the conclusion of the film, it showed Max and Hermie chatting again.  It ended with Max purposely leading Hermie in the wrong direction of a piece of raspberry pie when he had it behind his back the whole time.  I know it was meant to be cute and funny, but when you are producing these kinds of films, you wouldn't think they would use a lie to get a laugh.  Picky, picky...I know.

With the proper blend of humor and humility by tales' end both Skeeter and his brother learn some important lessons about themselves and each other.

She gets attached to the characters and loves to give them kisses (even if they are on tv). So I was especially excited to let her in on my latest project, reviewing a DVD movie. ""Skeeter and the Mystery of the Lost Mosquito Treasure"" was her first big feature film (at least the one that she's sat through the entire time).

Since we are new to television and movie watching for my little one, we weren't familiar with Max Lucado's series, Hermie and Friends. I was very familiar with Max Lucado though as I have read many of his adult books and enjoyed them.

We love Skeeter! It's a story ""based on Psalm 139:13-14 about each of us being designed especially by God"". It's about being unique, a little bit of sibling rivalry and a parent's love (not only from our heavenly father, but from our earthy parents too). The graphics are bright and cheery as the setting is in a beautiful garden. The characters are lovable. The lesson is important for kids to learn.....because we all have things we don't like about ourselves.

As an adult, I loved playing the ""who is that voice"" game. Don't you do that too? John O'Hurley was easy, but I knew the voice of Hermie and yet couldn't ever place it. Who was it? Tim Conway - any of you out there in your 30's who used to watch the Carol Burnett show with your parents might know this voice.

Coupons - you know I am all about coupons! The DVD came with 5 coupons that don't expire until 2011 (one was for $2 off another Hermie & Friends DVD).

Music - there's a Bonus Sing-a-long. This one my daughter loved and it had her singing and dancing.

Other great bonus features: Coloring pages (when you put the DVD in your computer) and a trivia game too (great for memory). There's also an auto-start which I wasn't familiar with until now. I am not sure I will be teaching my little one to use the DVD anytime soon, but it allows for your youngster to just insert the DVD and watch (auto-start).

We will definitely be looking at other Hermie & Friends movies in the future. The only bad thing I can say about the DVD is technical - we weren't able to access some short films that came as a bonus....like ""Hermie Had a Little Lamb."" We can't figure out why, but we'll keep trying.",1236556800,,2327,4.36027713625866

It has been an interesting chance to take a look at some of the items published by this Christian company - some cross the line for me into discomfort, and others are open enough in their world view to intrigue me.

This month I requested a dvd for the kids - Max Lucado's Hermie & Friends: Skeeter and the Mystery of the Lost Mosquito Treasure.  My kids love Veggie Tales videos and I've found those to be not-preachy enough to pass my comfort test.  Sure, they're telling Bible stories and they occasionally talk about God, but they are not trying to convert the kids or to say that their way is the only way.  (You need to keep in mind that my son has decided that the ""real"" God is Amun-Ra, and that there are many, many other Gods as well!  Being Unitarian Universalists, we like to learn about all kinds of religious ideas and keep what works for us.  We can embrace Christian traditions, stories or videos as long as they are not overtly close-minded.)

I was pleased with this Hermie & Friends dvd.  As the box says, ""It's About... Being Unique.""  In the story, Skeeter the mosquito is sad because his stinger has been crooked since birth, and he has no sense of direction.  His famous brother Sinclair comes to visit - Sinclair, the famous explorer, with a great sense of direction and perfectly straight stinger.  The story deals with Skeeter's bad feelings about himself and his belief that their father always loved Sinclair best, but in the end, of course, a lesson is learned.  The ""perfect"" Sinclair can't fly and always thought his father preferred Skeeter.  Skeeter, it turns out, has an amazing sense of smell and finds the Lost Mosquito Treasure by sniffing raspberries.

There was a little talk of God, of course, but the only time it felt over the top was when Skeeter asked God why he was born with a crooked stinger... and the booming male voice from the clouds answered him.  ""I don't make mistakes, Skeeter.""  But my son didn't have a problem with that - and, now that I think about it, he might actually love the idea of a God talking to the bugs, since he's a fan of the Greek gods who routinely meddled in the affairs of... well, humans and mosquitoes!

My kids liked the dvd, the story was sweet and the basic moral was good.  I'm grateful to Thomas Nelson for letting us review it.",1236556800,,2391,4.493055555555555

The poor guy has a ""stinger"" that is very crooked, and it seems to ruin his sense of direction - keeping him lost all of the time. However, the crookedness must be conducive to good smelling, because this bug can smell stuff miles away! So Skeeter has this unusual life of discovering yummy things like raspberries only to get lost trying to find them again to share them with his friends. How frustrating is that?

In the midst of all this confusion in Skeeter's life his brother - Sinclaire M Skeeto the third - comes to town. This great adventurer and world-famous treasure hunter has a ""stinger"" that is straight as an arrow, and everyone swoons over his great tales of bravery. Trouble is, Sinclaire is about the most conceited bug around, and he has no problem pointing out Skeeter's shortcomings.

Well, Sinclaire is looking for a lost treasure left behind by his father. Skeeter has seen the mysterious markings leading to the treasure, and if he can just remember where it was he saw the markings, he can help his brother uncover the most meaningful treasure of his career. What an opportunity! Will Sinclaire let his brother assist him in his search? Will Skeeter remember where he saw these mysterious markings that lead to the treasure?

I can't spoil this for you! Just suffice it to say that by the end of the tale the brothers both learn that they are both unique by design and loved in spite of what others perceive to be flaws. It's a great lesson to teach children at a young age, and these brightly colored bugs are the perfect medium in which to introduce basic lessons from the Bible. The viewer also gets to hear from Max Lucado himself at the beginning and end of the film, so that is kind of neat too.

Oh, and there is a feature about nutty nursery rhymes that is hysterically funny! I laughed out loud several times watching this buggy film! So consider exploring the world of Hermie and friends!

3777854,4,B001RPYU12,"In looking at presents for the grandsons and my youngest niece, I have considered the Hermie series by Max Lucado, but Skeeter and the Mystery of the Lost Mosquito Treasure is the first one that I've ever watched.  The hubby and I watched the this DVD together, and we thought that it would be appropriate for our youngest grandson, who is four, as well as the six and eight-year-olds.  The four-year-old would enjoy the characters, but the six and eight-year-olds, we think, would actually get the story as well as enjoy the extras.  It's intended for kids ten and under.

The basic story is about Skeeter the Mosquito, who has a crooked stinger and a really bad sense of direction.  His brother, Sir Sinclair M.  Skeeto III, a famous adventurer, is coming to Skeeter's garden for his next adventure, to find a treasure left to him by his father.  Sinclair is confident and famous, and he has a perfectly straight stinger, so Skeeter doesn't think he measures up.  It's Skeeter's nose, though, that finds the treasure.  In working with his brother, Skeeter finds out that Sinclair's wings are less than perfect, and both brothers realize that their earthly father--and their heavenly Father--loves them just the way they are.

The hubby and I liked the graphics of this story, and we liked the voices and the soundtrack, too.  At first I thought that the characters were too simple and the older kids wouldn't watch it, but there were enough chuckles in the beginning as Skeeter's nose led him the wrong way that I think the story would keep their interest.  It moves along pretty well.

There's a trivia quiz for kids at the end of the video that would be interesting for beginning readers.  You have to use the remote to enter the answers.  There's also a recipe for 'Ooey Gooey Butter Cakes from Bismarck,"" a treat that appears in the story.  They sound delicious, but beware the full box of powdered sugar.  I know that would give my grandsons the wiggles!  The only thing I saw that detracted from the video was the trailers that you can't get past in the beginning.  It's been my experience that when  kids want to watch DVDs, they don't want to wait.

We live in a world that puts a lot of emphasis on appearance, so I think it's never too soon to remind kids that God created them the way they are for a reason.  I also think there can't be enough reminders.  Our kids are aware of their differences, and the world doesn't always view them as pleasantly unique.  I'd give this story high marks as a reminder that, no matter how the world sees our kids, God sees them as being wonderful just the way they are.",1236470400,,2617,4.5665236051502145
3777855,5,B001RPYU12,"This is the first of Max Lucado's family-oriented series, Hermie & Friends that I have ever experienced.  Given that its target audience was for children ages 10 and below, I pulled in my son, who was a willing participant for anything animated.

At first, he said that the characters were for the little kids.  It was at that point that I felt this may be a long hour.  However, what followed was a small miracle.

The DVD we viewed was ""Skeeter and the Mystery of the Lost Mosquito Treasure"".  In this episode, Skeeter's brother, Sir Sinclair M. Skeeto, a world famous adventurer, visits the garden inhabited by the cast of characters in search of a mysterious treasure map left by their father.  Everyone in the garden fauns over Sinclair's pomp and circumstance; moreover, they are shocked that the great Sinclair with all his celebrity, could be Skeeter's own brother.  The differences in both Skeeter and Sinclair, and the former's resultant insecurity, are the issues addressed in this modern day parable.

Several times throughout the movie, my son guffawed and chuckled.  My wife and I also had a few laughs at the expense of the perfectly timed dialogue and top-notch talents of the star-studded cast which included the great Tim Conway and animated John O'Hurley.

The generous soundtrack helped to keep the pace moving along as well as kill any potential dead-space that could leave a child's mind wandering.  The animation was fluid and bright and the colors were digitally crisp.  The characters were endearing and the lesson uplifting. One of the unexpected treats was being able to see Max Lucado himself open and close the episode.  I have seen pictures of him in his books over the years, but it was great seeing him interact with Hermie and the audience.

My wife and I loved this DVD so much that we brought it to our Sunday worship service the following day and give the children an opportunity to enjoy this animated and well thought-out gem.  Is there a better way to express my recommendation?",1236470400,,2017,4.819767441860465
3777856,5,B001RPYU12,"Skeeter and the Mystery of the Lost Mosquito Treasure was beside my television one morning when my granddaughter (age 3) spotted it and decided that it would be the movie she watched on the way to school that morning. So, she was able to preview the movie without me.  Later that afternoon she and I sat down to watch.

The lesson in this movie is about being unique. Skeeter has a crooked stinger and feels upstaged by his brother, Sir Sinclair M. Skeeto, who is a world adventurer with a straight stinger. While working together to find the treasure Skeeter finds out that his brother has his own unique problem. Skeeter and his brother set out to find the treasure's location using Skeeter's extra keen sense of smell, he leads them to the map he remembered seeing when he was picking raspberries. When they finally get to the tree that the treasure is hidden in, Skeeter finds out about his brothers problem. It is then that Skeeter is able to help his brother get to the map and they find that without Skeeter's crooked stinger they would not be able to unlock the treasure at all. So my granddaughter and I learned that even though there may be something about us that we don't like, there may also be something about us that others envy.

Lesson is based on Psalm 139:13-14 about each of us being designed especially by God.",1236384000,,1331,4.5375
3777857,4,B001RPYU12,"My boys just finished watching Skeeter and the Mystery of the Lost Mosquito Treasure by Max Lucado for the third time. I think I can safely say they enjoyed it.  This edition of  Hermie & Friends is about being unique and how God has created us just the way he wants us.  The lesson is based on Psalm 139:13-14.
What a great lesson for my children! Especially for my dyslexic son.  There have been many times when he has asked me, with tears in his eyes, why he has to have dyslexia.  In the video Skeeter is wondering why his sting is crooked and why God would make him that way.  Skeeter just figures it is a design flaw.  God answers Skeeter's wondering's by saying, ""I don't make mistakes.  It doesn't matter what others think of you.  It matters what I think of you, and I think your just right.""
I was thrilled to apply that to my son's situation and it was a great reminder to him that God made Him the way he is for a reason.",1236384000,,933,4.167597765363128
3777858,5,B001RPYU12,"I really enjoyed letting my kids watch Skeeter and the Mystery of the Lost Mosquito Treasure.

This is a Hermie and Friends movie that focuses on how God has made each of us unique and special, even if we don't feel that way. Set in a garden, there's lots of bugs and adventures to keep your little one entertained. My two year old likes the caterpillar and my four year old enjoyed the treasure hunt. Even more, the movie teaches an important lesson about valuing yourself, and realizing that God has a special purpose for each of us and that there are no ""mistakes"", whether it's a crooked stinger like Skeeter the protagonist has, or too small wings, like his ""perfect"" brother has.
I definitely recommend this movie because it kept my kids glued to their seats and taught them an important lesson.",1236384000,,801,4.601398601398602
3777859,5,B001RPYU12,"Skeeter and the Mystery of the Lost Mosquito Treasure (DVD) Review

  The Hermie videos are great for children. My sister is 6 years old and gets so focused on watching these that you can't get her attention unless you pause the movie. Max Lucado has done a great job putting the fun of great animated characters with a lesson from the bible for everyone. This movie teaches children that everyone is unique. Even tho, Skeeter might have a crooked nose that's what makes him Skeeter. It's a great movie for any kid, but especially for any kid who is very self conscientious.",1236297600,,574,4.607843137254902
3777860,4,B001RPYU12,"I just want to say how much my daughter (age five) enjoyed watching the new Hermie DVD. In fact, she watched it twice in one day. The story is about Skeeter who has a crooked stinger and is terrible with direction, which becomes the point of some of his friend's jokes. All of his life he has been compared to his famous older brother Sir Sinclair M.Skeeter. His brother appears to have the perfect life and everyone looks up to him the problem is he does not fly. These two brothers join together to find their father's lost treasure and both learn that their father loved them.

Max Lucado's Hermie and Friends are wonderful for young children although my seven and twelve year old sat down and watched with the video with their sister. The storyline is based on Psalm's 139:13-14. I asked my daughter what she learned and she said that God makes everyone special. My daughter watched the video and understood the intended lesson,

There is a wonderful part in the story where Skeeter is asking God why he made him with a crooked stinger and if He made a mistake. God says he never makes mistakes.  I love that this little video is not only fun to watch for both parents and children but it also has a message.

My daughter also loved the bonus material included. There is a wonderful sing-along and auto start is always a plus so I do not have to stand around waiting to push play.

With the difficulty of finding children's movies that are appropriate to watch this one fills that void.",1236211200,,1490,4.483394833948339

8338525,4,B001RPYU12,"As a parent, I really appreciate the message of Skeeter and the Mystery of the Lost Mosquito Treasure. It addresses sibling rivalry and a parent's unconditional love for his children. The theme of accepting yourself as a unique creation of God's is also interwoven throughout. This DVD offers parents a good opening to discuss some of these important themes with their children.

As far as my young children (4 yrs old and under) are concerned, this is not one of those videos that they ask to watch repeatedly, but neither do they protest when I put it in. Perhaps the themes are a little more relevant to the 5-7 yr. age group? Overall, I'm happy with the video and believe as my children get older, we will be able to use this video as a springboard for discussions about each person's unique, God-given gifts.",1246838400,,813,4.645833333333333
8338526,4,B001RPYU12,"As a mom to three little ones, I'm always searching for appropriate entertainment for them. Something that will engage their curiosity, have a positive message without violence and keep them occupied while I get some things done that don't require little helpers. As much as I love to have them help me with household chores, they can't be tied to my {invisible} apron strings all of the time.

As a Book Review Blogger for Thomas Nelson, I was honored to have the opportunity to review Skeeter and the Mystery of the Lost Mosquito Treasure by Max Lucado on DVD. The video is about 60 minutes in length is based on Psalm 139:13-14.

At the first viewing, none of my children managed to watch the whole thing. Not even 10-15 minutes into the program. I'm not sure if it was the talking in the beginning or because they realized it was not Miss Spider's Sunny Patch that didn't captivate their attention.

With that, I put the video up for a later day.  After a few more attempts, they are now asking for the video.  This was accomplished by not plopping in the video and walking away for them to soak it all in.  This program is best suited if you sit with your children, at least the first time, to talk with them about what they are watching.  There are many opportunities for talking points -- match real world experiences.

Skeeter has a crooked stinger and feels less important than his brother who is a bit more worldly and has a straight stinger.  Differences that can be matched with your own children and their peers such as height, eye or hair color, etc...  No matter what, each is special in their own way.

I'm so glad that I waited to write this review.  Although I am not obligated to write a positive review as part of my Book Review Blogger status with Thomas Nelson - I felt that it wasn't the message or the format that didn't capture my kids' attention - rather it was my presentation.  I knew that this met my criteria for appropriate viewing so I went ahead and popped in the DVD and expected them to sit and watch it...  without me.  Lesson learned.",1245715200,2,2071,4.456233421750663
8338527,3,B001RPYU12,"I'm always looking for things that will both entertain and educate or edify my kids, so I picked up a (review) copy of Skeeter and the Mystery of the Lost Mosquito Treasure.

The story is of a mosquito named Skeeter who, through a treasure-hunting adventure with his cooler and more popular brother, learns to appreciate the things that make him unique. It's typical kids' movie fare.

Did the kids like it? Well, the three-year-old wandered off about two minutes into the cartoon (not counting the opening live-action scene with Max Lucado). The five-year-old got a little restless at one point, but she got into it in the end.

Can the parents stand it? It's ok. I'm sure we've all seen some kids videos that made us wish for an early death. This isn't that bad. That's not to say parents will love it, but it's not bad.

Any cause for concern? There was no violence or scary scenes. I am mildly concerned about one scene where two of the characters talk to God and God talks back. Audibly. I wouldn't want my kids to think that's normal, but it's not a terribly big deal.

So is it any good? The show is a little too blunt with the moral of the story. As for the story and music, well it's no Veggie Tales (of course, sometimes neither is Veggie Tales), but it's not bad. If you're in that place where you really need your kids to watch something different, this is worth picking up.",1243555200,,1386,4.440944881889764
8338528,5,B001RPYU12,"Skeeter and Sir Sinclair M. Skeeto are two very unique individuals.  They are unique not simply because they are mosquitos but also in that they are brothers with very different personalities.  Skeeter has a crooked nose that he is ashamed of and wonders if he is of any use.  Sir Sinclair M. Skeeto on the other hand is quite proud of himself but also hides a little something he is ashamed of.  The two brothers join together to find the lost treasure and discover that their individual particularities are what makes them unique and allows them to discover the treasure.

Based on Psalm 139:13-14, our two friends learn a very important lesson: Each of us is special because we are created by God.  Just like the other stories in this DVD series, this one is very well done.  The characters are fun to watch and you'll enjoy getting to know them.  The story is mixed with a good dose of humor.  My kids enjoyed watching it and have asked to see it over and over again.  The specific theme of each DVD makes it easy for parents to open up discussion with their children and elaborate on the theme.  The DVD quality is great plus it offers a few bonus features.

I certainly recommend this DVD and the others in the Hermie & Friends series.  Your kids will enjoy them and so will you!

You get the newest in Max Lucado's Hermie and Friends line of DVDs.  And it is a treat.  To top off the excellent quality of the movie, the lesson in this particular one is wonderful.  All about celebrating our uniqueness and realizing that we are designed by God to be exactly who he made us to be.

8338530,4,B001RPYU12,"Because we don't spend a lot of time in front of the TV screen I am fairly selective about what my children view. Since we had recently seen a Hermie movie at our AWANA club, I was pretty sure that Skeeter and the Mystery of the Lost Mosquito Treasure would be A-OK! I'm happy to report that I was right!

The story has to do with two brothers, Skeeter and Sinclair. Sinclair is debonair and something of a world traveler with a distinguished reputation. Skeeter is... a ""homegrown"" mosquito with a crooked stinger... lovable, but with a penchant for getting lost. The moral of the story has much to do with the fact that God created each one of us, just the way we are. We each have strengths and weaknesses, but if we focus on the strengths and work together to overcome our challenges, we are much more likely to reach a common goal.

My children* enjoyed the story, from the 21-month old(The animations kept his attention) to the 8 and 11 year-olds (Who ended up thinking about the ""Message"", and it left us (Mom and Dad) with smiles on our faces as well. If you are looking for ""Family viewing"" that will entertain a variety of ages, including the littlest in the family, this could be a good choice for you.
