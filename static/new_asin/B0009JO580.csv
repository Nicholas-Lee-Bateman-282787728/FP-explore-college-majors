8062013,5,B0009JO580,My son loved to watch these tapes. It is a wonderful overview of music and different types of instruments. He can listen to songs and pick out the different instruments. It teaches about a variety of musical styles. They are divided into lessons but if I was busy he would watch for as long as possible. Great for preschool-first grade.,1298851200,,336,4.616666666666666
