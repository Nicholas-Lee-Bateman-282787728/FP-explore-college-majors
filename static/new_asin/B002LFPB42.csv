This review is for the CD version not the DVD.  I accidentally ordered the DVD by mistake, then returned it for the CD.  This rating is for the CD.",1388620800,,289,4.296296296296297

8372848,1,B002LFPB42,I bought the DVD because I thought I would be watching Brad Paisley singing the songs in three different festive scenes or locations. But I was very disappointed to discover that Brad did not appear at all. I may as well have just bought the CD.,1294099200,,245,4.3478260869565215

8372851,5,B002LFPB42,"This DVD adds to your holiday celebration. For a sit by the fire with some friends over and great music in the back ground, or a scenic view to enjoy while you sit and drink your hot coco. I myself and my wife sit and just gaze at our tree in the dark with the scenic view of the log cabin while Brad Paisley sings some great tunes to us so we can enjoy as much of the holidays as we can to make it as much as posible. I love it!",1260921600,,429,3.6739130434782608
