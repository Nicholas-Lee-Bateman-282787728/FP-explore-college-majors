1524710,4,B00005JNHT,"""Kojak"" is one of the best of the ""Golden Age"" of the the television detective which was the 1970's.

Telly (actually ""Aristoteles""} Savalas is a fine actor who

up until he got this series was simply a good character

actor who played ""heavies"".  Here he really comes into his own playing the gruff lollipop-loving New York City Police Lieutenant who deep down has a heart of gold and while being seemingly tough and cynical really cares about his men and wants to rid the world of evildoers.

What is special about this series as compared to the others

of the same period are the especially lush, colorful sets used and the views of New York City

both from ground level as well as from the air.  Even tenement dwellings are shown with a lot of detail, so much thought and expense was given by the producers and directors to make the shows a  pleasure to watch.  My only negative comment, which

makes me give it only a 4 star rating instead of 5, is that

the clues and leads come very quickly which sometimes makes it

difficult to follow the plot and prevents development of

potentially interesting characters, which is the strong suit

of others series from the same period such as Columbo (who had 1.5 to 2 hours in which to fill out the story unlike Kojak who had only an hour) or The

Rockford Files.  In any event, I hope that this outstanding series will become available in DVD.",1102464000,21,1392,4.48207171314741

1524712,5,B00005JNHT,"KOJAK was the best new series of 1973-74. Telly Savalas deserved his Best Actor Emmy for his portrayl of Lt. Theo Kojak, NYPD. The first season boasts 23 of the best one hour teleplays-dramas in the history of television. Authentic atmosphere and locations (the first season was shot primarily in NYC before shifting to L.A.) gave the premiere season a unique look absent in the following years. The first rate scripts by Jack Laird, Halstead Wells, Mort Fine and Gene Kearney were amplified by stellar performances by Savalas, Kevin Dobson (who came from the Long Island Railroad and stock to play Detective Bobby Crocker), George Savalas (Telly's brother, who went under the nom-de-gere Demosthenes for 2 seasons) and Dan Frazier. The guest stars were also outstanding, most noteable: Harry Guardino (DEAD ON HIS FEAT), Jackie Cooper (LAST RITES FOR A DEAD PRIEST), Tina Louise (DIE BEFORE THEY WAKE), Harvey Keitel (SIEGE OF TERROR) Paul Michael Glasser (DOWN A LONG AND LONLEY RIVER, which also features Jennifer Aniston's father, John, as mobster Albert Dansek) and a very young James Woods (DEATH IS NOT A PASSING GRADE). Telly was the man and he made the character his own: the charm, the ethnicity, the custom made suits. The first season of KOJAK continues to rank the best of the series 5, especially with the John Cacavas soundtrack of Season 1. FYI: What was to become Telly's signature line (""Who loves ya?"") debuts in DIE BEFORE THEY WAKE. Without a doubt, we all loved you Telly!!!!",1091491200,96,1497,4.944444444444445

Since I was in pre-school when this show originally aired, it is wonderful to watch as an adult to see a slice of the 70s.  NYC looks so much nicer back then, sleaze & all.  Sure, some of the scripts are iffy & the acting occasionally over the top, but it is such a fun show!!

1525234,5,B00005JNHT,"Kojak  Season 1

This was a very popular television series back in the early 1970s. The first season has twenty two shows (fifty minutes each). These DVDs have excellent quality. Those old cars may bring back memories for those over fifty. Note the use of revolvers by the police. Often the bad guys use an automatic, a tradition going back to the 1930s. Car chases always add action to the story. In some scenes you can see people in the background standing on the sidewalks to watch the filming. Will the shows be as good as you remember them? This was one of my favorite shows then (I would sometimes recognize the street scenes).

I wonder how many such gun stores are in business today (Siege of Terror)? Would any police detective enter a place controlled by armed robbers (except in a drama)? The passage of many years makes some of these scenes implausible. A Manhattan store selling M 16s? Note the manual typewriters on the desks. Some of the actors seem familiar from other shows. Youll note some `political correctness in these scripts. One alarm clock reads Made in U.S.A., a sign from the past. After the show is nearly over the good guys win in the end. Then Kojak worries about the paperwork!

1525235,5,B00005JNHT,"First thing that comes to mind when writing this review is how much I want the rest of the series!!!  That's how good KOJAK is.

I vaguely remember watching this with my mom in the 70's & really discovered it late at night while in college in the 90's.  I love HAWAII FIVE-O.  I love STARSKY & HUTCH.  KOJAK is my favorite 70's show.  Fascinating thing is with all the cop dramas produced in the 70's, none were alike.  No CSI, CSI NY, & CSI MIAMI.  Each 70'S drama brought something different to the table.  KOJAK is New York.  The location is everything in this show & the actors, particularly Savalas reflect the city.  The shots of the city are wonderful.  The plots usually are strong & the acting is superb. Can't praise this show enough.

Video is sharp & although there are no extras, the episodes are enough for me. Hope subsequent seasons are released.  Excellent show!!",1287187200,3,880,4.487341772151899

I did know who Telly Savalas was as Big Joe on Kelly's Heroes and as Blofeld from On Her Majesty's Secret Service. My grandmother talked me into picking up this box set, and I couldn't stop watching it. Unfortunately, I was informed a short while afterwards that Universal Studios has no plans at this time to release any more seasons of Kojak. What a huge disappointment!

1525309,3,B00005JNHT,"Overall, this disappointed me because it wasn't the Kojak remembered until the final few episodes of this first season: you know, the ""Who loves ya baby?"" Kojak character played so well by Telly Savalas.

It took half the episodes before Kojak even sucked on his first lollipop. In other words, the ""Theo Kojak"" as we remember him, took almost a year to develop and that took up most of this disc. I am hopeful that more seasons will come out on DVD because those would all be what I was looking for in the first place......but so far, I haven't heard any word of that happening. Maybe this first season DVD did not sell well.

The last month of this season, when the shows got a lot more entertaining, were so not only because Kojak came to life but humor was injected with ""Stavros"" (George Savalas) and his pet plant ""Shirley,"" as well as a few other neat touches.

One of the episodes in this first set interested me because it starred Lola Albright, the blonde who was a knockout on the old Peter Gunn television series. It was interesting to see her after a long absence. Speaking of women, this was the first look I had of Kojak's girlfriend who was something else - a great looker - but suddenly disappeared and never came back with no explanation!

The most interesting of the earlier shows was the one that featured James Woods as a student in a crime class. If you know Woods, you know he wound up playing an intense, evil guy.

The cast in here is good. Kojak's boss, ""Frank"" (Dan Frazer) was a good guy as was one of Kojak's assistants ""Crocker"" (Kevin Dobson) who got more screen time as the series went on. Stavros was always fun to watch, especially Kojak calling him ""Curly"" or ""Fatso"" or ""Baldy.""

Check out the dinky .38s the police pack, although the lieutenant could and did kill folks with that short barrelled pea shooter. The good thing, for me, about this package was that I did not see the show in syndication.  So, with my memory, most of the episodes were new to me.  Now, here is a great suspenseful cop show with terrific backup characters, but without the intense violence and ""social redeeming values"" of modern crime dramas.  You can even watch the DVDs, for the most part, with your children without addling their little undeveloped brains. In short, a fine entertainment value...

1525457,5,B00005JNHT,"The 1970's had some of the most entertaining police shows on television. Telly Savalas starring as the no nonsense, street smart New York City Police Lieutenant Theo Kojak brings down the toughest criminals any way he can. Telly Savalas was an outstanding movie and television actor and Kojak was one of his crowning achievements during his long acting career.

Five stars all the way for this classic cop show from the 1970's. The video transfer from Universal is excellent and the audio is crisp and clear. The sound of Kojak yelling ""Crocker"" never gets old. It's unfortunate that the original pilot movie which first introduced the ""Kojak"" character in the 1973 TV movie (The Marcus-Nelson Murders) is not included in the set. I don't know if it was an oversight by Universal when compiling the season one set but it definitely should have been included. It's also too bad the studio didn't include any sort of commentary or interviews from any of the surviving actors of this great show.

Overall ""Kojak"" season one is pure entertainment and a definite must have for Savalas fans. Telly Savalas in the role of Theo Kojak remains one of television's greatest detectives to ever hit the screen and season one of ""Kojak"" is a treat to finally have on DVD. Recent rumors from Universal Studios are that future seasons of Kojak are not in the works; suddenly my lolly-pop has gone sour!

I don't know why these studios continue to release a season set with no follow up of future seasons. I'd rather see a complete series set.

1525458,5,B00005JNHT,"I did not really remember watching this show when I was a kid, but I recently bought the DVD set on a sale at Amazon.  I could not believe how good this show was.  I was under the mistaken impression that Kojak was a 100% macho tough guy cop who always saved the day by the use of brute force.  Boy am I glad I was wrong.  Telly Savalas did portray Kojak with a macho toughness but with intelligence, compassion, warmth and sense of humor.  He also had a sartorial eloquence unmatched by his peers.

It is also interesting to note all the young guests on season one who went on to big careers later in life (James Woods, Harvey Keitel, John Ritter, etc)  I do hope to see the remaining seasons (2-5) issued by Universal.  This is top quality entertainment, and I'll take it any day over the garbage being passed off as entertainment on tv today.

1525459,5,B00005JNHT,"I have been ordering TV shows that I liked but have not seen in awhile. I am part of the growing trend of the population that watches less TV (less than 4 hours a week live TV), but spends a lot of time with radio and internet entertainment, so when I saw I could get season one of Kojak (used) for about 20.00 I was all over that. I was on the young side when Kojak aired but it was filmned in the streets of New York City where I grew up and I actually saw them using my favorite pizzaria after school for an episode so it was like rooting for your home team for me to be a fan of Kojak. I just watched episode one Siege Of Terror and I was not dissappointed, the show holds up VERY well. I counted over 100 bullets shot, 3 wounded or dead people, realistic street scenes, realistic (to me) action, the things you can appreciate in a police action show. Also, the ending was not all happy and was actually sad, thats what good TV drama is all about in my book. So yeah for the price I paid I'm going to get all of my money's worth watching Kojak's 22 season one episodes. The show was great and won many awards, I guess it was a bridge between the Hawaii Five  O/ Mannix type show and the next period which I think started with Hill Street Blues. Kojak was street smart like a Hill Street but didn't have much continuity from episode to episode just as the shows Mannix/ Hawaii 5 -0 didn't. You could watch an episode of Kojak in mid season and it was fine, where as if you missed the first half season of Hill Street Blues you'd have missed a lot of character development. So I guess thats why it didn't last past 5 seasons, but in TV years thats a long time. Great show 5 stars. *******Now about this Universal DVD set. After watching episode one on disc one, I checked the episode guide online and found out it was NOT the first Kojak made. There was a pilot episode that aired the TV season earlier as a TV movie. That is NOT on this set. Maybe Universal didn't make it and thats the reason why it's not here, but it is pretty major letdown. I found it on region 2 and will probably get it as I am always curious to see a good shows roots and how it's introduced to the audiance. There are also no extra's that I spotted like interviews and that stuff, I know Telly is gone but maybe his brother who was also on the show (if he is still alive) could have given the fans some stories about Telly, I think that would have been great to listen to. Fans of Kojak are undoubtably fans of Telly so something in the way of a commentary would have been nice. Other TV DVD sets have those extra's and I know Universal is not known for extra's but I'm just mentioning this for those who don't know these things. 3 stars for the packaging, 5 stars for the show. I've seen whole run's of Mannix and Barnaby Jones (!) among others being sold on the internet, I'll be looking for the rest of Kojak (even if it is old VHS transfers) since Universal has decided not to release the other 4 seasons on DVD (are you listening Universal?).",1164844800,6,3025,4.135823429541596

So, it was with some glee that I discovered season one of KOJAK on DVD. Would the show be as good as I remembered it all those years ago? Would it just be a 'memory cheat' like so many others and good for nostalgia only. The answer to both questions is no. The reason? It's even better than I remembered. Great scripts, interesting plot lines and a real warmth from all the main characters. You just get to love having them around.

In a modern age where cellphones intrude everywhere, it's nice to see a slice of life where people had to run to the payphone on the corner. Buy this DVD and enjoy the big cars, big style and big heart of Telly Savalas. We miss you Telly.

Not the case. I clearly remembered these episodes and even the music, and the way the credit would cube the picture, when showing the intro.  This was a very memorable show for me.

I can honestly say, Kojak (Telly Savales) was one of my heroes.  He truly was.  His acting was phenomenal, and he was somebody to look up to.  Its too bad he is no longer with us.

I've seen some comments from other reviewers about music being changed, and I have to say, I'm quite adept at this type of thing, but since I was so young, I really have no memory of changed, or updated music.  How do you all have such a strong memory? I'm pretty sure most of the music was instrumental, and not any famous songs you might hear on the radio.

Humor amidst horrible situations..which is reality as sometimes its the only way to get through the day.  The first realistic city police show.  It doesn't get any better than Telly Savalas as Theo Kojak.",1132531200,8,290,5.239130434782608
1525525,4,B00005JNHT,"This is a warning to anyone who buys multiple set DVDs or especially ""flipper discs"" (double-sided DVDs).  There could be a problem with ""sticking"" (the picture freezes or skips) with these DVDs. When ever you buy a multiple DVD set (or any DVD for that matter), quickly view or fast foward through all of the DVDs to make sure that there are no defects on any of them.

I believe that, unfortunately, the makers of these products are just out to make a quick buck, so they just rush, crank 'em out as quickly as possible, not worried so much about the quality of the final product.

As for the Kojak shows themselves, in my opinion, they're excellent.  The show plots, dialog, and action (and Telly Savalas) are worth the price of the DVDs themselves (and the shots of '70's New York are priceless!!).  The picture quality is good, although I do have to turn up the volume a bit to hear the sound. You can read more indepth reviews of ""Kojak"" on this site.

I brought these DVDs in March of this year and just a few days ago found out that there was a defect on one of them, on the third (3 of 3) DVD, of course!  I didn't suspect anything wrong with the set, since while I have only a few DVDs, none of them have had this ""sticking"" problem.  I was taking my time, watching one episode about one to three times every month after having just brought them.  Then I get to the third DVD, episode 19 to be exact, and near the end, the DVD freezes, then about 5 minutes later (after a few tries to get it to play) skips to the end credits, freezes a few more times, then ends.  And it was soooo good up until this point!  And I can't return it because its waay after the 30 day return period.  s***!!

Again, check the DVDs you buy right away.  You don't want to be stuck with a DVD you can't watch.",1131753600,56,1796,4.198250728862973

and I have one question:  When is Season 2 coming out?

I am a die-hard Kojak fan, ever since the show first

aired.  Of all the police shows I have watched over the years,

coming from a law-enforcement family, Kojak is the best I

have seen.

Please tell me how I can obtain information as to when

Season 2 will be available for sale.

Thanks very much.",1124668800,3,414,4.259740259740259
1525529,4,B00005JNHT,"A long overdue release, the series may be over 30 years old but still an iconic series as a cop show with great characters. Ahead of its time but still one of the best. Nothing much in the way of extras but good value nevertheless.",1122508800,2,231,4.155555555555556

1525617,5,B00005JNHT,"This complete first season DVD set of Kojak is wonderful.  There are no extras, but the episodes are complete and uncut.  Really takes me back to my teen years in the 70s.  I loved this show along with Hawaii Five-O and other classics of the era.  Sadly, the movie length pilot for Kojak, entitled The Marcus-Nelson murders, is not included with the Season One release.  It is also an excellent Kojak story and Telly Savalas had already set the tone for the character in the pilot.  Hopefully all the Kojak seasons will be released in complete sets.  Would love to see the pilot released as an extra with a future complete season set.",1113782400,18,634,4.557522123893805
1525618,5,B00005JNHT,"i first got into Kojak several years ago when i discovered it late night on some cable station..WGN i think...i loved the show and caught as many eps as i could. well, i hadnt seen the show in a long time since then so i was elated to see the dvd release. out of all these eps there are only 2 i had recalled seeing before so this was a joy. i really hope they decide to release the other 4 seasons. it'd be great to own the entire run.",1113350400,3,436,3.8555555555555556
1525619,4,B00005JNHT,"very good release overall. really the best and only essential kojak season to release. Season 1 was shot on location in NYC and  was very authentic for that reason. the following seasons the show shot out of Los Angeles , and that  along with poorly  written and anti climactic story lines makes seasons  3 to 5 basically throwaways. Hopefully the studios will release the other essential 70's crime dramas. having already released 2 seasons of the drek that is Columbo, 70's crime drama fans deserve to have  ( Mannix, Streets of San Fran, Cannon and the Mod Squad) on DVD format. bring it on",1112745600,3,593,4.663461538461538
1525620,5,B00005JNHT,"I canceled my satellite dish a few years ago and never got cable so I don't know if this show is currently running anywhere on cable. But the picture quality on this show is unbelievable. Yes, there are no extras per se and no booklet or info included, but the shows themselves are the thing! Great plots, a lot goes by that you miss, so watching an episode a second time is not a waste of time. Season has great views of 1970s New York City. The character actors and guest stars are also first rate. All in all, an awesome package. Put me down for the second season. Watched about 12 or 13 of the episodes over the first 3 or 4 days I had the set. Being Greek-American, it gives me goosebumps when I hear Greek being spoken or references to his Greek heritage. Yasou! Again, great colors. Remember, this show was on in the early '70s, so before cable and digital. This is like watching the show all over again for the first time! Again, the best DVD purchase I ever made, even better than seeing The Twilight Zone on DVD.",1112572800,2,1022,4.27319587628866
1525621,5,B00005JNHT,"I'm digging the new Kojak with Ving, but the original classic is fantastic and I'm thrilled to have it on DVD. Kojak is a special kind of detective. The new and classic Kojaks are both stylish ""prince of the city"" types who protect the innocent and bend the rules to do what's right. The ""prince of the city"" was an unusual angle for a cop show when Telly did it. It's still pretty unusual today. TV cops these days are even less likely to be that protective or altruistic, but both the classic and new Kojak are stylish, sharp witted, good hearted, and damn good at keeping the mean streets of the Big Apple safe. Kojak is a class act and it's impossible for me not to like both versions of the character. There's no other detective quite like Kojak. I sincerely hope they release all of Telly's Kojak episodes and tv movies on DVD. The more Kojak the better!",1112572800,5,860,4.38125
1525622,5,B00005JNHT,There is no Kojak unless it is Telly Savalas.  He is Kojak.  Just like Raymond Burr was Perry Mason.  I love the new release of Season 1 and I hope all seasons will be released as I will buy them all.  This is one of my most favorite crime shows and I hope to see other episodes from other seasons.  At least I have season 1,1112400000,4,324,3.8484848484848486
1525623,4,B00005JNHT,"The other Theo Kojak catch phrase. I am greatful for this box set! A fan from the begining and a great show to follow Cannon on Wednesday nights back in 1973-74. The series, though bares little to the Marcus Nelson Murders, the televison movie which introduced him, his name was spelled Kojack. The show was greatly influenced by the cinema of it's day, Shaft, The Godfather, Across 110th Street, and The French Connection. Sonny Grosso, the former New York cop, and who Roy Scheider's character was based on, was a techincal advisor with sometime actor and fellow former cop, Burton Armus. I have only a few  problems with the set, no extras, the ad breaks are edited as they would do in a movie, and the great trailers of the next episode narrated by the man himself, Telly Savalas!!! I saw some of the new Ving Rhames Kojak, as Adam West said when the 1989 Batman movie was released, ""you can have the classic coke, or the new stuff"". Classic for me! The picture quality is great, and after 26 years of watching the shows in synication on various channels, this is a pure joy! I will by every season including the shark jumping 5th, bad stories, except for ""The Summer of 69"", and the disco Kojak ""77"" theme, which for some reason I own a copy of. Bring on The Rockford Files!",1112140800,8,1279,4.489270386266094
1525624,4,B00005JNHT,"The success of this show is illustrated by the fact this show is back on TV with Ving Rhames as Kojak. This is another successful cop show that aired in 1970s in the same era as Baretta, Starsky & Hutch, and Columbo to name a few. This show also offered authenticity and paved the way for NYPD Blue. The Greek, bald-headed, Kojak brought no-nonsense approach to homicide cases in Manhattan. While working cases with his captain Frank McNeil and closest colleagues Crocker, Kojak had a knack for bending the rules to solve a crime. There are 22 episodes of first season on three discs. The first season of the series shows appearances by some the best talents on TV that includes John Ritter, Paul Michael Glaser, Dabney Coleman and Harvey Keitel. It is nice to watch some of these actors during the initial stages of their career on a good crime drama. Any one who was a fan of 1970s cop shows would certainly love to have a copy of this DVD.",1112140800,5,942,4.482558139534884

If you love 70's detective shows and you want to feel transported back in time, you must have this set.  Telly Savalas is at his best.
