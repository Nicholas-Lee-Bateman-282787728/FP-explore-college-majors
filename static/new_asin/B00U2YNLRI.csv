7028472,5,B00U2YNLRI,This is a fantastic film! I cried and was filled with hope. Excellent writing and acting. It's a must see.,1443398400,,106,4.35
7028473,5,B00U2YNLRI,"Loved the movie great message behind it trying to write a review and avoid giving off a spoilers at the same time. But considering that there are allot of domestic violence in the world this will bring forth a powerful message and probably present the biggest gift of it all, its prevention. Would like to shout out everyone involved in this great film and I recommend everyone support and purchase your copy! - Nathan Walsh

7028503,3,B00U2YNLRI,"I have seen a few really low budget movies on Amazon and it's obvious why they are low budget. Most of them are very poor movies. You know there's no money for big screen sets, big name actors, etc. but there can still be good writing and good acting. This movie is surprising good. By far, not the best movie I have ever seen, not even close. There are some holes in the plot that are obvious but overall better than I expected.",1480723200,,429,4.180722891566265

7028523,2,B00U2YNLRI,This was a terrible movie.  Just didn't make sense. Why would a NURSE tell a patient who has been a coma for 1 1/2 yrs tell patient that his parents died while he was in that coma.  Why is he in bed with no hospital robe on after all that time. Put a patient out to wander on the street....... Just on and on. I couldn't bear it any longer.,1471737600,8,340,3.842857142857143

7028526,3,B00U2YNLRI,not a bad movie!,1470700800,,16,3.25
7028527,2,B00U2YNLRI,"The directors appear to have been trying to make the point that domestic violence is never okay. However they fell horribly short at illustrating how a young lady should safely navigate her way to a loving relationship in which she is treated with respect. The leading man has a sad story that has led him to homelessness. Their partnership begins with her providing a place for him on her couch fairly early on, unwise and out of order. Then, the characters have sex and then begin to discuss where the relationship might go. Out of order once again.

There is one scene that gives a glimpse of where some depth and insight should have been added. The male lead having come from a home where his father abused his mother is very likely to continue that pattern. In this one scene when he says something offensive to his love interest and she reacts angrily he grabs her arm. Red flag. Then once she forgives his remark, meant to be humorous, yet any intelligent person would not have found it to be so, he repeats the same ignorant, inappropriate comment. She laughs and invites him to lunch. Waving red flag. So this shows that she's open to having her feelings disregarded. Btw, his offensive remark was an attempt to make light of an earlier incident where the boyfriend of his love interest was choking her and he had to come to her rescue. What's the message here?

An odd twist in the story that's never explained, her abusive boyfriend disappears with no explanation so she starts giving away his stuff to her new love interest. Where was he? Jail? With a new love interest? The leading man shares with his future leading lady that he was always good and that he's just passing thru to get on his feet. He works cleaning the dance studio with 5 students where the female lead works..no depth or insight into who these 2 lead characters truly are.",1470441600,6,1854,4.564564564564565

7028529,5,B00U2YNLRI,It was a great love story. Low budget movies usually don't keep my attention but this one was a really good one,1469491200,,111,4.090909090909091

7028535,1,B00U2YNLRI,"This has to be one of the worst movies I have ever seen - Look, the script was awful.  Who ever wrote this; a first year high school writing novice could have done better as a ""first-time"" experimental project.  I have a young daughter (22) in grad school - I hope she never has to use this film as an example of anything she could run into representing normal Black people.  How on earth could a Producer spend thousands of dollars to produce such a mess!! But worst than that, I notice several people gave this fiasco, 5 Stars.  These people were either friends of the people that produced this mess, drunk, or from some other planet where movies don't exist.  Can these people honestly say this nightmare compares to Roots, Glory, The Color Purple, Gone With The Wind, The Help, To Kill a Mockingbird, just to name a few ""5 Star"" dynamos......This is just an embarrassment to Black people and Black movie-making anywhere.",1468713600,,924,4.609756097560975
7028536,5,B00U2YNLRI,Wow this movie was really good. Great job to the director and the cast. I think it needs a part 2 to it. I want to see more..

8704296,5,B00U2YNLRI,"No words I write can accurately describe this movie.  The movie is so good that I think calling it a movie is an insult.  It's a cross between what you know is real and the fairy tales you also dream.  It's like someone peaked into your brain, captured those thoughts you reveal (and the ones you keep hidden), and decided to share you with the world.  You'll pause just to confirm it is a movie.  You'll hold your breath in excitement and in fear.  And yes, tears will fall as well.  Like I said, you and this fantastic work of art will be one.  You'll feel like a champion and defeated.  You'll rise at times.  In some cases, you won't either due to a true incapability or for lack of trying.  When the worst of the worst has been thrown at you, you'll find it comes down to the spirit.  With that said, I'll let you see if there will be a rise or a fall.  This wonderful masterpiece will become you.  Now, how could they manage that?  Are you ready to embark on this riveting journey?
