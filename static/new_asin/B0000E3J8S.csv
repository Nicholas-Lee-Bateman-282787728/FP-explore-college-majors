This video consists of 10 different pieces of combined choreography to create a beautiful and masterful dance to please the soul. Her instruction was clear with reviews; and still I'm thankful for the rewind button. Rania is a pleasant instructor, with very good environment and sound quality to back her up. If you're a professional or experienced Raqs Sharqi dancer: don't bother acquiring this to learn new moves; but you may find it could be an inspiration for choreography combination ideas.",1124236800,,631,5.019047619047619
8001771,4,B0000E3J8S,"I like this video.  It teaches a drum solo in the most straightforward way possible with clear instructions.

Rania breaks the choreography up into 7 parts that she teaches sequentially.  For each part, she runs throught the part slowly, then does it twice at full time with music before moving on to the next sequence.  I like how this choreography demonstrates ways the movements can illustrate the music.  At the end, she does the choreography in full costume.  The obligatory live performance at the end is also included (I've noticed that many people complain when an instructional belly dance video is missing it).

With most bellydance videos, the problem with choosing one has less to do with the quality of the video and instruction, than with selecting a video appropriate for the bellydancing student's level of skill.  A video too difficult will be frustrating while a video too easy is boring and not helpful at all.  The perfect video is one that is just slightly above a person's level of skill, so that the student may learn to reach that level without too much frustration.

This choreography is appropriate for the intermediate student who knows the basic moves and isolations but who needs to increase their skill in learning new choreography, increasing their coordination and choreography learning speed,and learning how to put together drum solos.  These are the reasons I bought this video and I'm satisfied that I got exactly what I wanted.  It's perfect for me.  I've learned all the isolations fairly thoroughly and I'm just learning layering.  I'm not all that quick at picking up new footwork, so I'm trying to expose myself to new footwork all the time to become better and more coordinated.  It's working.

She does include some moves that I'm still practicing and haven't yet mastered, like layering and body rolls, so this video is still a bit over my head, which makes it the perfect video for me.  If it was too easy for me, it would be useless.  While learning the choreography, I just do the best I can and make sure I learn the footwork.

I think beginning students will think this is advanced, while advanced students may think this is too basic.  I think it's a step between the two.",1100822400,24,2222,4.7973684210526315
