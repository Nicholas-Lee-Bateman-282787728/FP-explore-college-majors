8105801,5,B000E5JW8W,"Barney Miller, the late, great police sitcom of the mid-1970s-early-1980s, lives on in the wonderful episodes featured in ""Gone Berserk"" (VHS).  We are introduced to Captain Barney Miller and his group of diligent sargaents at the New York City 12th Precinct.  These men must take on some of the most outrageous and memorable situations, with their share of truly distinctive characters.
Episodes on this video are:
1.  ""Doomsday""
 A disgruntled man with a belt of dynamite threatens to blow himself and the squad room sky high unless President Nixon agrees to speak with him; the plumbing goes kaput; Wojo arrests a phony man-of-the-cloth.
2.  ""Toys""
 Feuding toy makers create a disturbance; Barney faces his first holiday as a separated man; a claustrophobic prisoner has an understandable problem with the cage.
3.  ""The Child Stealers""
 A self-proclaimed time traveler tells Harris to fine tune his stock portfolio; Marty's divrorced gentleman friend Mr. Driscoll attempts to reclaim his son by abducting him from the playground.
4.  ""The Doll""
 An expensive doll is abducted for ransom; a man claims he was swindled in exchange for a ticket on the space shuttle; Luger informs Barney that he's in his will.

What really makes Barney Miller such a great show is the combination of wit, intelligence and sensitivity showcased in the great writing and the brilliant delivery of the cast (regulars, as well as special guest appearances).  This is one sitcom that is truly timeless.  Yes, the fashions have changed, and so has some of the lingo, but the stories still ring true as significantly today, as more than thirty years ago.",1167868800,5,1633,5.071161048689139
8105802,5,B000E5JW8W,"I was so happy to find that some of the best episodes from Barney Miller, one of the greatest cop shows ever on television, were available for purchase.  The distributors really must release the rest of the seasons on DVD (besides season one), and I hope that someone takes note of the great following this show has, even though it has been off of the air for 25 years now.

""Lewd and Lascivious"" is a great collection of some of the most risque and wonderful episodes from the show.

The episodes are:

1.  ""The Courtesans""

 A prostitute threatens to file harassment charges against Wojo; Rachel wants to move into her own apartment.

2.  ""Evaluation""

 The members of the squad nervously await Barney filling out their evaluation forms. Meanwhile, Harris arrests a numerologist who will only give his name as ""1223,"" and a porno shop reporting vandalism turns out to be a mom and pop operation being hassled by their kids.

3.  ""Movie 1""

Harris is assigned to direct a pornographic movie; an old-time radio newsman assaults a vacuous television anchor.

4.  ""Movie 2""

A blind mugging victim and an overzealous charity collector are among the disparate audience members at the screening of Harris' overbudget film.

I really appreciate their great brand of wit, combined with a wonderful sensitivity for the subject matter presented in the episodes.  What's more, the cast was made up of some of the finest comedians I have ever seen.  Note:  Abe Vigoda (who played Sargaent Fish, in ""The Courtesans"" episode), is still seen on occasion on The Conan O'Brien Show.  This is a great show that more people really ought to know about today.  There is a whole new generation that needs to really experience what great writing is, and it is evident in Barney Miller.",1165968000,,1764,4.806666666666667
