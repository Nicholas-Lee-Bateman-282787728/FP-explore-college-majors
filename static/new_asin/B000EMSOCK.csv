8111533,3,B000EMSOCK,"I liked the beginner, high beginner and intermediate, dances.  The Level 3's were very hard for me.  If I was a younger person and had more skills with dance steps I might have liked them as  well.  Younger dancers would love this DVD.  Some of the dances were just to advanced for me even with their good instruction.",1365379200,,318,4.413793103448276
8111534,5,B000EMSOCK,I loved this DVD as I need to get back more movement in my joints. I have done line dancing in the past but not for the last four years. I moved after my husbands death and this DVD of Scooter Lees has helped enormously as I have not anywhere here to go for line dancing. The dances are gone through in stages with new steps shown at each stage. Thank you Scooter Lee for an excellent DVD.,1173484800,8,389,4.0
