1366532,2,B00004X025,"This is a great movie (just read the others reviews!), but once again Manga Ent. release a poor DVD edition... the english surround track is just unlistenable, it sounds like a realaudio clip streaming on 28.8k modem (Yes it's that bad; 8bit PCM samples sound better!), so trust me and save some bucks... :(",993945600,2,307,4.703703703703703
1366533,5,B00004X025,"Patlabor 2 is a complex, reflective, interestingly-convoluted political drama.  It secondarily provides some good mech-related action sequences, but that amounts to perhaps ten/fifteen percent of the movie.  So don't expect even the relatively moderate level of action that attends the Evangelion series.
What you can expect is a great, startlingly well-animated movie that requires you to follow closely.  Although a certain level of intelligence is indeed required to view it with understanding, it is more a matter of simply paying attention.
Which can be tough since the artwork and characters are so captivating.
Along with the 4-disc Serial Experiments: Lain, this is my favorite ""thoughtful"" anime.  Ghost in the Shell being a distant, more simplistic (believe it or not) runner-up.  Even the music was surprisingly good (just ordered the CD, in fact).",988416000,5,859,5.4772727272727275
1366534,5,B00004X025,"I would warn anybody from getting the DVD if they expect an anime Robot action movie.  Though a lot of impressive looking military hardware is shown, they are not the focus of the story.  Another warning is that, since this is a sequel of a movie based on a cartoon series, it doesn't bother re-introducing all the old characters to a new audience.  So, many of the characters could seem unfleshed out.
Note also, this being a Japanese movie, the movie likes to do animated ""Aspect-to-Aspect Transitions"".  Scott McCloud describe those as ""... used to establish a mood or a sense of place, time seems to stand still in these quiet contemplative combination.""
This being an often-used tradition in Japanese comics, its usage blend separate scenes into one single moment or atmosphere.  It's also the reason why 80% of the critics (and probably 90%the general audience) describe the movie as slooooow...
Also, the movie has a strong anti-war undertone, as with numerous Japanese movies and animation (though it usually a surprise for us Americans).
Also, since this is a serious and subtle movie, my advice is to use the Japanese dub with subtitles to avoiding undermining the pace of the dialog, not to mention to catch the subleties of the characters' interaction.",979430400,6,1264,4.943396226415095
1366535,5,B00004X025,"For once, a serious anime for mature adults. Political intrigue and conspiracy issues comes across expertly as an incredible intelligent and thought provoking film. This anime movie is what anime is supposed to be. Don't believe the myth that anime on the whole is sophisticated. Just cause it's respected in Japan doesn't mean they'd produce more mature entertainment in animated form. Patlabor 2 is different from the norm in anime. Patlabor 2 is about human nature and how predictable people can be when their fears are exploited in the right way. Nice small character bits and their relationships are done well also. Pacing so well done, you'll be at the edge of your seat the whole way. Patlabor 2 is a great movie.",978307200,,720,4.861788617886178
1366536,3,B00004X025,"This anime is one of the flims that makes me wonder if it's really done by sinlge team under single direction. Some part shows good cinematography and background artworks and such, while other parts show complete lack of attention to details and visual justification. It exposes awful camera-works and lightings too frequently. Someone uses the word ""visual-wonder"" for this anime. That word should be reserved for films like ""Wings of Honneamise"" or ""Grave of the Fireflies"" or at least ""Kenshin OVA"" (not the TV series). By any chance, you should not expect anything like ""Ghost in the shell"" just because of the name of the director. It's just not in the same league.  Technically, the sound effects almost makes me laugh since it is so not matching often-times, temporally and thematically. Music's contribution to the drama, which is usually a stronger point of Anime, is not any better case either here. Too much part of the animation appears very hastily done at the very least. The awful snow that you have to deal with all along, the lack of facial expressions from the main characters ( even after some consideration for the possible intentions ), blatantly static enviroment/props/minor characters etc. A few times, I almost checked if my DVD player's running. If someone's gonna tell me that all those were probably designed as such for the sake of atmosphere and story, I'll say that he is way too understanding. No. This is a case of lack of artistic efforts. I also felt a unfulfilled sense of an ending in terms of the plot. Maybe it has more intricate storyline compared to many other so so animes, but that doesn't justify the anti-dramtic ending and the villian's mindset at the end. Overall, I have to say that this is one of the most overrated animes out there. One last thing. I don't know if I would buy another anime DVD from Manga USA or Central Park Media, no matter how much I want to see/keep the film. Their transfer is still far behind to be considered as professional. I feel ripped-off everytime. Can someone who owns Japanese releases provide some comparison? Just too curious.",975715200,5,2110,4.81267217630854
1366537,5,B00004X025,"Combining beautiful images with suspense similar  to that of Seven Days in May, it is not to be  missed. The image of the Japanese Self-Defense  Force deploying into Tokyo while snow falls  softly is what first grabbed my attention - and it  is both preceded and followed by fascinating and  beautiful scenes. The plot isn't bad, either, with  the Police trying to unravel a plot before a military  coup becomes irreversible.",969580800,4,425,4.887323943661972
7925781,5,B00004X025,"I saw a part of the movie many years ago. I then spent years trying to figure out what it was so I could watch it again. Finally bought this version of the movie on VHS. I still love it and have the all the TV show stuff and movies on DVD.

About this version... I like it more than the remastered version, or at least it's harder to love the remastered version if this is what you're used to. The subtitles make more sense, I think. Also, one part of one of the main songs is better, which gives that part of the movie much more oomph. The music in the remastered version is excellent, but the editting/volume control wasn't.

Anyway, a good buy and the Patlabor 2 movie you probably know and love. It's even a better movie if you watch it first, before the TV show and first movie. You'll never know it's the same plot that the writer rehashed several times. Those were practice. =)",1348531200,,884,4.224852071005917
7925782,5,B00004X025,"Patlabor 2 is a very good anime, both by the technical quality of Oshii's team's work, and by a very good and smart screenplay, using politic and terrorism as background.

This movie show us that anime is not only for kids (see Disney) and that japanese anime can have a beautiful picture and good screenplay.",1128816000,,309,4.618181818181818
7925783,5,B00004X025,"The movies of Patlabor have always set themselves aside from their various TV incarnations. They have also been independent, that is to say that a new viewer can watch the movies and still feel as if they understand the characters and their universe. 'Patlabor the movie 2' is a cold departure from the events of the first movie. Those expecting the same volume of commedy or action will be dissapointed. The story centers itself on two very prominent yet often over looked characters, captains Ohda and Negumo. Although always featured in the TV shows they were never really fleshed out or showen to have different sides to their personalities. Here they shine in the stark cold setting.

The film will appeal to Patlabor fans and those fond of technological and political thrillers. As in the last film, offensive action is saved for the climax and is complemented by a very well written and touching finnale.

The essence of this film is focused on realisim and authenticity, as such there is a real worldly detail to the set design and characters. So much so that in places it is quite possible to forget that you are watching an animated feature.

Anyone dissinterested with the doe-eyed designs and fan-service filled shows that they have come to associate with all ""Anime"" are strongly advised to give this a viewing.",1122076800,3,1324,4.849557522123894
7925784,5,B00004X025,"This was an amazing movie. I am not a not of patlabor the tv series & after a couple, will not be keen to pursue it. But you don't have to be a fan of patlabor to enjoy, what I think is the BEST of the 3 patlabor movies.

Everyone said the first one was the best. I disagree. This is the best because the dialogue & ideas presented is so thought-provoking that it is still relevant today, like the first Matrix. And the action that occurs toward the end is amazing in terms of damage.

I am a fan of Mamoru Oshii's work & I think this is the best of his work. THe visual palette & detail is beyond compare. It was breath-taking to watch. I would just turn off the sound & play it on TV like a screensaver.

I highly recommend this movie, especially you like clever dialogue ala British tv Yes Minister & inferential/deductive reasoning.

Enjoy a great film",1112659200,4,856,4.201219512195122
7925785,1,B00004X025,"This is NOT your typical Cowboy Bebop action anime. Rather it's about political intrigue and dialogue after diagolue that it left like I was watching a radio-show. Absolutely boring. I didn't care much for the animation either or even the characters. The characters look japanese this time, unlike what we're used to. I guess they want to make the story a more realistic trying to deal with mordern day issues.
There's barely any action. I must admit that I couldn't finish the movie because it was way too boring with all the cloak and dagger stuff going on. Likely, I was able to get this from the public library. I would have been upset if I rented this movie. This movie is recommended to hardcore anime  fans. Those of you looking for action, humor etc go watch Cowboy Bebop or something like that. Not this movie!!!",1078876800,5,821,4.623287671232877
7925786,2,B00004X025,"Perhaps I am just a miserable bugger, but I genuinely am better able to express why I *don't* like something that I am able to say why I *do*.
So, ""Patlabor 2."" A terrorist act sets in motion a chain of chaotic events which threaten to plunge Tokyo into anarchy. Sound interesting? Certainly does.
Too bad it's not.
""Patlabor 2"" is very easy to compare to ""Ghost in the Shell,"" except it's nowhere near as engaging. It suffers from ""GitS"" biggest flaw - idiotically long streams of overblown, expository dialogue which the viewer must strain to pay attention to, not helped by the fact that for the majority of these sequences, the animation is little more than a static shot, or a dull still pan. It doesn't stop there - you will have to sit through a ridiculously complex plot which could have been a lot simpler and not lost anything, and devastatingly, gut-wrenchingly, soul-destroyingly slow pacing that leaves the viewer genuinely *bored*.
It is fair to say the the Patlabor series and movie are not about mecha action, but the amount of Labor action in this film is so disgustingly low that it hampers it even further - those who tell you there is enough action in it are not being truthful. Given the chaotic nature of the story, one would think action was inevitable, yet it has somehow been worked around in favour of boring the audience to tears.
Additionally, the woefully overdone bird imagery of the film - which has no evident *meaning* - is rammed down the viewer's throat in a clumsily-constructed, unending stream which rapidly becomes intrusive and infuriating.
That all said, ""Patlabor 2"" has it's heart in the right place - it's a meticulous tale that has been painstakingly crafted, with beautiful, atmospheric animation. The problem is, it has been made without regard for the viewers. It's an overlong film, which pretends to be more than it is, because on closer inspection, it's actually about an hour of plot, stretched out into a shockingly empty two-hour movie.
Hardcore anime fans have a tendecy to praise this movie, and, yes, there are elements that are praiseworthy. The intent, if nothing else, is a great one. But the simple fact is, that the final composition of the praiseworthy elements is, bluntly, not a good movie.",1056585600,5,2255,4.799485861182519
7925787,5,B00004X025,"This movie is good.  I watched this movie with no previous Patlabor experience and it didn't prove a problem at all.  This anime forms a complex web of political intrigue and does have mecha fight scenes but they all serve in a commentary on the precepts that shape our world.  It asks the very disturbing questions like what would happen if all forms of ""official"" authority were wiped away tomorrow? How would people handle their too-perfect freedom?  And even, do people want to be free?  Not at all characteristic of the mecha genre, Patlabor 2's famous climax is a very quiet discussion about the nature of Japan's ""unjust peace"" of the post-war era and the retribution that may come from Japan building its affluence while simultaneously turning a blind eye to the rest of the world.  At its heart, it is an exploration of the postmodern ""unreal city"" and it subtly and disconcertingly asks each of us if we actually welcome and internalize the illusions that shape and control our lives.",1020297600,3,994,4.783625730994152
7925788,4,B00004X025,"i watched patlabor 1 and it was like nails on a chalkboard. i don't know what made me buy patlabor 2 but it was a 1000 percent improvement on the first one. the second one is really well done, the storyline, plot, characters interact well - its a little moderate pace but overall its still worth the buy.
if u like politics n action mixed into ur anime this baby is for u!  cheers!
God bless.",1016236800,,392,4.157894736842105
7925789,5,B00004X025,"Patlabor 2 is, perhaps the most detailed, intelligent, visually astounding anime movie you may see. It has a fairly complex and realistic plotline involving political standoffs and military coups, but that shouldnt be percieved as a bad point - although action scenes are fairly thin on the ground it has an unbelievable sense of depth that few animes match. The excellent atmospheric artwork, characters and backdrops, coupled with Kenji Kawaii's superb score makes Patlabor 2 a sensory feast and an incredibly good film
If you don't have an open mind about anime as a serious medium, you may not like this at first, and dismiss it as dull, but after watching several times to understand the intricacies of the plot, you really appreciate it.
The Disc itself is average - not many extras, but the film is on there and thats all that matters, really.
I rarely give full marks, but i'll make an exception!
Cant wait for Oshii's next one - Jin Roh!",999648000,5,946,4.774390243902439
7925790,5,B00004X025,"This is so good. It is very good. There is not much action so don't expect another GiTS. But when there is action it is GOOD. This is a talker. Everbody talks and that what's great about this movie. It is very interesting and diffrent. But it works fine. It is not boring at all.
One scene is so very beatiful and scary. It's when the army moves in and secures the city. And it is snowing. And the music. It is all very powerful stuff. I am glad I live where I do.
Get you paws on this folks. Does not get much better.",994723200,,518,3.942857142857143
