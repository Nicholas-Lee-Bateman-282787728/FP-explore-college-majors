6333641,5,B00J5G1OL4,"3 year old is obsessed with Team Umizoomi. I originally recorded shows on our dvr, but more than half of a 30 min program has commercials. When it's bedtime & I need him to wind dow before lights out, these commercials get really distracting. So I got these which are awesome and not full of advertising like on tv. Very happy!",1453420800,2,327,4.377049180327869
6333642,4,B00J5G1OL4,"Cute but didn't last long. She's not even interested in Umizoomi anymore. Lasted maybe a month. I don't think it really taught her anything either, not that I was expecting it to but 'they' said kids love it.",1447027200,,208,4.5

8648348,5,B00J5G1OL4,"For some reason, none of my local stores (Toys R Us, Walmart, Best Buy) will carry Team Umizoomi, and in fact I was told by Toys R Us that they have ""phased out"" all of their products. Why?! This is a very popular show; my daughter has loved it since she was 1 year old.

To those leaving negative reviews based on the fact that this is a duplicate product whose only difference is the slipcase... really? A few minutes of research into the product you are buying would go a long a way to avoiding similar issues in the future. It took me all of a second to recognize that the only difference between this ""version"" of the DVD, and this one: https://www.amazon.com/Team-Umizoomi-Donovan-Patton/dp/B004X1M4FG/ref=pd_sim_74_3?ie=UTF8&pd_rd_i=B004X1M4FG&pd_rd_r=4X5EW1VCQZ3JM8NVKDGM&pd_rd_w=SlfaI&pd_rd_wg=6uarW&psc=1&refRID=4X5EW1VCQZ3JM8NVKDGM, are, for some reason, the price, and the fact that one case has a ""School Essentials"" border, while the other one doesn't.

It's a simple thing, too, to Google the individual DVDs to see what episodes are on them, as it is a simple thing to check the other customer reviews here on Amazon to notice that some people have included a list of episodes as part of their review, or have even shared an image of the back of the DVD case.",1475452800,2,1275,5.154589371980676
