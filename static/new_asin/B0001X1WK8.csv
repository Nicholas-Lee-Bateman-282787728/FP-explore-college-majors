2040821,3,B0001X1WK8,"Please release the ""Deadly Blessing"" on dvd. I think it is fun to see Sharon Stone as she was 26 years ago.",1177545600,6,107,3.909090909090909
2040822,2,B0001X1WK8,"Deadly Blessing is one of Wes Craven's pre ""A Nightmare on Elm Street"" films. Deadly Blessing is about a Hiteit community, where a mysterious killer is killing off people of the community. The locals blame it on a woman they call the incubus. Deadly blessing is nothing more than a dull movie. Really only notable for an early appearance of Sharon Stone.",1132876800,3,354,4.725806451612903
2040823,4,B0001X1WK8,"This is a creepy little movie that I am surprised is not on DVD.  It should be!  That snake in the tub scene freaked me out when I first saw it years ago,

as well as the spider scene.  Maybe it has something to do with my natural fear of snakes and spiders!  Waiting for a smart company to bring this out of print Craven flick back so it will get the attention I think it deserves.",1129593600,11,382,3.909090909090909
2040824,5,B0001X1WK8,"I still think this is one of Wes Craven's best movies. I know it goes completely crazy at the end and doesn't make a lot of sense but it has great atmosphere, great scares, and a young Sharon Stone looking hotter than any woman has a right to. Why this isn't out on DVD is beyond me.",1090540800,9,283,3.982456140350877
2040825,4,B0001X1WK8,"ONE of Craven's earlier chillers which I thought was pretty good. Mara Jensen and her husband live on a farm and her husband is accidentally killed. (not a spoiler it happens in the first ten minutes!) Her friends Sharon Stone and Susan Buckley(patty from grease) come to stay with her. Besides them, Mara's only other friends are Lois Nettleton and her shy daughter who live nearby. Soon more accidents are happening ,obviously a killer is on the loose! You get a snake in the tub(just try to watch!), Mara Jensen in two catfights, and sharon stone freaking out in a barn and falling down stairs. i don't know why this is so hard to find. they should re-release it. luckily i have a copy i bought used a few years back. if you can find it get it.",1089590400,34,747,4.420289855072464

2040967,5,B0001X1WK8,One of Wes Craven's best. What a cast to boot. A very young Sharon Stone in this one. She looked good then and still does. This DVD is very hard to find and all I can say is scoop it up before it becomes out of print and hard to find and if you're lucky you might find a copy of it at a garage/yard sale. This one is a keeper and great story line. You won't get bored with this one. Buy it you'll like it.,1478736000,,405,3.6666666666666665

The ending sucked so bad, it did not make sense at all!!!!  So take off about the last minute of the movie and you have a pretty good show!!!  Oh and if ya like seeing chicks shoot guns, as I do.

Very strange movie that is fun to watch. Ernest Borgnine was great and although it was unusual to see him in such a film, it was enjoyable. It is also neat to see a young Sharon Stone before she was famous. Great casting and an interesting story.",1456531200,,391,4.157894736842105
2041016,3,B0001X1WK8,ok movie. I watched it as I like Wes Craven and hadn't seen this one. And I liked the premise - a religious cult with a secret. Acting was ok but the storyline was a bit messy. And the ending - totally off course. Not really sure why it ended the way it did. Felt like a cheap thrill thrown in at the last minute. Anyway - just ok for me.,1456531200,,338,3.7746478873239435

2041020,4,B0001X1WK8,"This was an early Wes Craven film & after watching it I could see certain things that would later show in Nightmare on Elm Street. I won't get into many of them cause I don't want to spoil it for people but the bathtub scene in particular will easily remind people of the tub scene in Nightmare. Now on to the movie, basic plot is in a Hittite community some strange killings are happening & the community seems to think its an Incubus. Very early screen appearance for Sharon Stone &, very good performance by the cast as a whole & a great performance by Ernest Borgnine as the leader of said community. Some good, tense moments (barn kill & car kill) to be found here as well. One thing I didn't like was the ending. Had the movie ended 5 minutes sooner it would've been perfect but I feel the last 5 mins kind of take away from the rest of the film. Special features include commentary, trailer, radio spots, still gallery & interviews. At first I didn't know how I would enjoy it since I haven't liked all of Cravens work (like Scream) but it honestly surprised me. If you are a fan of Craven or 80s horror films definitely give Deadly Blessing a watch.",1446940800,,1157,4.336405529953917

2041023,5,B0001X1WK8,"I liked this movie a lot.  Wes Craven was not my favorite director.  But I can see that he has much potential in the beginning of his works.  In fact, I haven't watched any of the Freddie Movies, knowing how not like the master, Hitchcock was, that Wes had no hold boundaries when it came to torture, blood, and terror.  I just couldn't stand them, no matter who played in them, and I believe John Depp was one of the first movies.  I just couldn't do the movies, nor had any desire to do them.
I was surprised at the famous characters that Wes put into the cast, of which was excellent, and watching it knowing it is a 60's movie bring back for me a great remembrances of music, emotional uproar just being a kid growing or grown in to a man, and being restricted by faith.  I do not agree with that upbringing but, I can see and was shown the value, yet the destruction of both family, values, and other very important things that we need just to love one another.
Sharon Stone was the best of the best in a part that wasn't the first part, but the actress that played the main part, could not have been casted better.

Personally, I'm not certain what the big draw was for that woman after her husband was murdered; living amongst people like that.
If I'd been her, I would be like.......hey there girl friends, nice of you to visit but don't bother to unpack your bags because we, yea that's right, I said WE are all heading back to the airport and back to L.A. right NOW!!!.......and then we're gonna throw a bottle of Grey Goose in the freezer with  frosty glasses.

I mean seriously, the entire town is deranged; never mind with that ""are you a good witch or a bad witch"" routine, they're all F****** U*** crazy.

I sure as hell wouldn't want to be a Monsanto salesman talking' with those lunatics about new and improved corn seed.
That was a nice touch about the Incubus thing though, that's right, rip up the floor boards, brimstone and all, grab victim and the floorboards fix themselves. Now you don't have to bother looking for a contractor on Angie's List.

2041040,4,B0001X1WK8,"Wes Craven has always been an enigma to me as a filmmaker. He has an academic background and he seems to put intellectual content into each of his new screenplay projects, but the resulting movies that he either writes or directs usually end up being intellectually shallow and only half-rewarding as scare film pieces--and scares are all that seem to make it into the final soup. Well, in the case of ""Deadly Blessing"", it was not Craven's original idea or screenplay, but his directorial hand seems to be grasping for a firm grip on the material throughout. ""...Blessing"" was written by Matthew Barr and Glenn M. Benest as an original script (that's ""story"" to the WGA), based upon a National Geographic article about the Amish (don't laugh) and their peculiar anti-society living methods, and the idea was to write an independent horror film since Barr had always been an aspiring filmmaker and Benest had a background in poetry writing and theater. Still, it's a shame that Craven's reworking of their initial draft (he claimed that their were ""structural problems"" when he spoke rather dismissively about the original story on the audio commentary track offered here) seems to have diluted their main source of ideas--I have no idea what the original hand-written script contained, but I have an inkling that the resulting picture is quite a bit removed from its initial source play. Craven's movies are always interesting conceptually, but sometimes the resulting films themselves are a little lacking.
""Deadly Blessing"" is something like a murder mystery film that feels as if a tacked on shock ending were included merely for the purpose of getting more die-hard horror fans into the theaters to rally behind it--the tactic didn't work, since ""Deadly Blessing"" almost immediately fell between the sheets of cinematic obscurity. Although Craven complains in the audio commentary that the women are ""too glamorous"" (and there is a bit of nudity on behalf of actress Maren Jensen--what a little hottie!), I think it is by now obvious that the three beautiful leads are what sell this picture, and even the lovely Lois Nettleton turns in a solid performance here as yet another pretty face on display (she was in a ""Twilight Zone"" episode, and I think even a ""Night Gallery"" or two...). Anyway, if you don't like spiders and snakes in your movies (and some gore), ""Deadly Blessing"" will not be for you, but for the most part it is a clever horror film, suspenseful, uneasy, and inventive, with an apostate son returning to his Hittite family in the middle of nowhere, which sets off a chain of events that lead to the unraveling of a strange murder mystery case. Although the plot can be a bit confusing for a horror film, James Horner's chilling and choir-driven score gives this one a proper layer of menace that it may not have had otherwise.
The extras on this Scream Factory disc are typically impressive and prove to me once again why it is never a waste of time or money to invest in their quality line of reissued films on either DVD or Blu-Ray. The ""Rise of the Incubus"" extra features the man who was head of Special Development Projects at Don Post as he discusses how the demon creature for the film was constructed--frankly, he looks a bit bewildered that he's even talking about this, but it's a brief extra. The interview with actor Michael Berryman is typically friendly and informative, as he discusses his relationship with Wes Craven and makes a plea for younger filmmakers to not forget about actors of his generation when doing casting calls for new pictures. The interview with actress Susan Buckner is pretty brief, but she mentions that she enjoyed making the film and offers some amusing insights into how she was cast. The best interview feature, running about twenty minutes in length, is ""So it was Written,"" in which the film's two screenwriters discuss how their script was picked up by three independent film company funders and eventually noticed by Wes Craven. The two of them also discuss their backgrounds in theater and film work and discuss how they came to be collaborators upon this very unusual horror film. The trailer, TV spots, and radio spots are all quite good. The audio commentary by Wes Craven (moderated by Shawn Clark of HORROR HOUND magazine and the TV program ""Horror's Hallowed Grounds"") gives a lot of insight into his relationship with Sharon Stone (Stone, I believe, was more interested in Craven's wife, but I'm not really sure what was going on there!), how he came to cast certain parts, and what his feelings are about the difficulties of shooting films very quickly and then having to deal with interference from the studio and the two main producers (Jon Peters and Peter Guber, who were back here just getting started for the kind of heights that they would climb in the future). Overall, this is the ONLY copy of ""Deadly Blessing"" that you will ever need on home media, with great extras and an extraordinary picture/sound transfer. A-",1430697600,,5003,4.873239436619718

2041058,5,B0001X1WK8,"I have been a fan of horror films since I was a teenager. Since then, I have built quite an extensive collection of horror films on DVD and Blu Ray. Shout/Scream Factory did a truly outstanding job with this Blu Ray. From the slipcover/blu ray artwork...to the quality of the film...to the extra Blu Ray features...this is a nice addition to my horror film collection!
The Blu Ray release includes Theatrical trailer, tv spots, radio spots, as well as a few other short interview segments about different elements of the film...discussed with Michael Berryman and Susan Bruckner...amongst others. For those of you that don't own a Blu Ray player, this release is also available on DVD!
What's mindboggling is how many people DON'T KNOW ABOUT or HAVEN'T HEARD of this movie! Especially considering the MANY horrible horror movies that there have been! This film, released in 1981, was VERY out of the 'norm' from the other style of horror films that had previously been directed by Wes Craven. There was a very cheap and gritty appearance to 'The Hills Have Eyes' and 'Last House On The Left.'  This movie was beautiful as far as the cinematography is concerned! It's also safe to mention that the acting is very good in the film. This was Sharon Stone's first major film and her acting is okay. However, the acting of Ernest Borgnine, Maren Jensen, Michael Berryman and the others more than made up for Sharon's not-so-good performance!
This is a strange movie...that may require more than one viewing for you to truly make sense of everything that this film wants us to believe and understand!
The film has a great creepy atmosphere, ideal locations for a horror film and enough twists and turns to keep even the average horror fan entertained for it's running time!
There are slasher elements...supernatural elements and all of these blend together to create a truly original and atmospheric horror masterpiece!
Having seen many of Wes Craven's films, this is by far my favorite...even though he brought us such classics as 'The People Under The Stairs,' 'NIghtmare On Elm Street,' 'Scream,' 'Deadly Friend,' The Hills Have Eyes,' 'Red Eye,' and 'Last House On The Left.'
This horror film has everything that a film of this kind should have...great setting...great cinematography...excellent acting...strange and eerie plot...fantastic music score...female nudity...and a few jump scares!
I highly recommend this to fans of classic slasher films and fans that enjoy obscure horror films!
Gorehounds beware...this IS NOT for you! This movie deals with the depravity that lies in human nature,
Even though this was a recently discovered horror film for me, it's now at the very top of my horror favorites list!
Do yourself a favor and discover this fantastic example of a brilliant horror director coming into his own and in the meantime, creating a 'unique' film that brilliantly blends different horror elements all into one fantastic movie!

2041065,4,B0001X1WK8,"In discussions of the works of Wes Craven, Deadly Blessing usually isn't the first(or second, or third) film brought up.  I think most Craven/horror fans eventually get around to seeing it.  For the most part it's considered to be an ""okay"" movie-an interesting footnote in a master's career, but nothing to write home about.  Yes, I can definitely see how this film earned that reputation, but I will admit that I do enjoy it a bit more than that.
  Deadly Blessing is about a woman living next to a farm of religious nuts called Hitites(Wasn't this the name of the cult who worshipped Gozer in Ghostbusters?).  Martha's the name, and her husband is an ex-Hitite.  Hubby's killed in an ""accident"", but Martha refuses to sell the farm to the Hitites.  She invites some of her girlfriends over, and soon we're treated to mysterious murders, odd dreamlike mumbo jumbo, and Hitite harassment.  It doesn't all make much sense, but at the same time it isn't confusing either.  To me, this felt a tad like an Italian ""giallo"" movie.
  I agree, the shock ending seems like a last minute slap on, and kinda cancels out everything that had been established up to that point.  I do have to say that I like the scene in of itself, but in the end it really had no place in the movie.
  All in all I would certainly recommend it to raven fans and fans of 80s horror.  If anything else, it's a unique film, and certainly isn't boring.",1402012800,,1420,4.531496062992126

A married woman named Martha (Maren Jenson) just lost her former hittite husband Jim (Douglas Barr), her friends (Sharon Stone and Susan Buckner) visit her to comfort her. However there is a dark secret that the Hittites are hiding from Martha, there is a deadly incubus curse going on which has been kept for generations as some people begin to drop like flies and weird things start happening.

Highly underrated 1981 supernatural horror thriller from co-writer and director Wes Craven is one of his most overlooked movies. This movie is quite different as it's a horror flick set in Amish country which no one has ever thought of, a very well acted and creepy slasher film with thrills and chills and makes you guess who is this killer. Sharon Stone makes her second film debut before becoming a big star, Michael Barryman does a sympathic role as the mentally challenged deformed Hittite and Borgnine is terrific as the religious leader, however the ending is kind of a cop-out which nearly hurts the purpose of the film but despite that it's still enjoyable stuff.

2041130,5,B0001X1WK8,Really enjoyed this movie. Story takes place in a Amish type community where a former member of the religious cult dies in a mysterious accident. Strange events continue to happen to his wife and her friends. Look for a very young Sharon Stone as one of the friends. Ernest Borgnine is tremendous as the leader of the religious cult and Michael Berryman of The Hills Have Eyes fame is good as a member of the religious cult who constantly harasses the girls. One of my Wes Craven favorites.,1363046400,3,490,4.579545454545454
2041131,5,B0001X1WK8,"Deadly Blessing 81' Ernest Borgnine, Sharon Stone. After Wes Craven's Success of The Hills Have Eyes and Last House on the Left and before the height of his Nightmare on Elm St days, he helmed this multi-faceted, Isolated supernatural slasher, set in an Amish-type setting.

A young pregnant Martha Schmidt(Maren Jensen) loses her husband in a farming accident, attempts to stay on the farm with the help of her friends Vicki and Lana (starring a young voluptuous Sharon stone and Susan Buckner). Vicki suffers her own hell after being trapped in the barn and battles nightmares of a spider and Lana tries seducing a curious Hittite, who was the brother Hittite turned wordly John Schmidt. The Hittites (as quoted from the film ""Makes the Amish look like swingers"") continue to torment these three woman with threats of vandalism and planting typical scares for the genre helmed by the screen captivating Michael Berryman, until they decide to fight back and arm themselves.

The films third act transcends into the supernatural, and delivers more frightening tension than an average slasher with a sleep walking psychic, ghostly visitation and one hell of a shoot out that was not scene in Craven's films until this one. The ending rings a bell for exploitation fans of Russ Meyer's Beyond the Valley of the Dolls.

Borgnine's strong performance as the overbearing rule enforcing elder brings strength to the story, and his harsh way of dishing out punishment to even shunning his own people.

If you are a Craven completist or are tired of the regular late 70's early 80's slasher fair, this will be a breath of fresh air.",1362787200,,1624,4.937728937728938

2041133,5,B0001X1WK8,"If you are a fan of 1980's horror/suspense, the you will love Deadly Blessing.  Personally, I've always had a crush on Maren Jensen.  Her character on Battlestar Galactica was prominent at first, then forgotten about as the episodes went on.  She is fine in the role of Martha, a widow left alone after the mysterious murder of her husband who was going to the shed to pack bearings on his tractor.  Michael Berryman, Ernest Borgnine, Sharon Stone and the rest were a delight to watch.  I have been waiting for this movie to be available on at least DVD for 10 years or more.  I bought a used VHS from Amazon just to see it again.  The blu ray transfer is just fine.  The darks are exactly the way that I like them, and the subtle soft edges look great where they left the colors alone without messing with film grain.  James Horner's score i spot on, and there are moments when I feel like I am listening to either ""The Wrath of Kahn,"" or ""Aliens.""
  Overall I am VERY pleased with this release and the extras are fabulous.  I want to give a personal thanks to Scream Factory for delivering these older classics of sometimes forgotten films.  This will be the 12th purchase I have made from them in High Definition and they are by far my favorite company.  I LOVE that they do not forget the original classics from the 80's that paved the way for a generation of wannabe horror films.
  Keep doing what you are doing!  My only problem is that my wife is complaining that my movie area is getting too large for her liking.  I can always hide some of them!",1360540800,4,1555,4.358885017421603

I won't reveal any spoilers, but suffice it to say that the cast makes this a fun chiller.  The gorgeous (and underused) Maren Jensen is one of the lovelies in the cast, along with then-unknown Sharon Stone.  This film is fun, although gorehounds might find it less potent than other Craven films.  Despite the cast presence of Ernest Borgnine and Michael Berryman, this is a female-centric thriller, as though Robert Altman set out to make a slasher flick.",1360108800,2,610,4.836538461538462
2041135,4,B0001X1WK8,"This blu ray is an improvement on the previous region 2 dvd which I had, not only in the extras department but also visually. The movie is in widescreen- the scenes of the Texas farmlands are beautiful, and many of the night shots (during which certain murders occur) are just the right balance of light and dark so that you feel it's really night and the action is clear enough to make out. One problem is that the high quality of the blu ray image shows-up the limited quality of a couple of effects shots. The audio commentary by Wes Craven has interesting antecdotes about filming and setting-up some of the creepy built-up set pieces as well as dealing with certain actors and the ending which he did not choose but was forced to use. The sound is good- James Horner's eerie and sometimes overblown score is louder than ever, and dialogue and sound effects shocks are sharp and clear. The interviews explain almost too much about the film, taking away the mystery of a film of which little was told of over the years except for the segment about a certain creature effect in the film (hardly anything is shone clearly). The interviews with both screenwriters are the most revealing of the story and filmmaking process. This was also the first time I had seen the interesting-looking actor Michael Berryman interviewed. The TV spots are interesting- I had not seen them since I watched these advertisements on network TV back in 1981. Thanks to Shout! Factory for releasing yet another cool 80's rarity.",1358985600,15,1507,4.712121212121212
2041146,4,B0001X1WK8,"I don't know how Shout! Factory chooses the classic forgotten gems of the horror genre they re-issue and give the Blu-ray treatment, but they are doing a great job. They've given fright fans high-definition access to cult favorites like ""The Island,"" ""Death Valley,"" ""They Live,"" and ""Halloween III: Season of the Witch."" Now they've unleashed Wes Craven's ""Deadly Blessing"" on us.

Jim Schmidt (Doug Barr) turns his back on his Hittite faith and moves to the city to start a new life. He returns with his new bride, Martha (Maren Jensen), to the place he grew up. His father, Isaiah (Ernest Borgnine), and family have disowned him for leaving the Hittite faith. They will have nothing to do with him or his bride. When Jim is killed in a mysterious tractor accident, Martha begins to suspect that the Hittites are trying to drive her away from the land she lives on and still claim is theirs. A series of brutal murders further prove something's not right in the little country community.

Director Wes Craven obviously used ""Deadly Blessing"" as practicing grounds for his future horror exploits. One example is a very familiar camera angle used in ""Deadly Blessing"" that he re-used in the original ""A Nightmare on Elm Street."" It left me smiling throughout the entire sequence. One thing I'll give Craven is he knows how to drum up enough suspense to make you nervously bite your fingernails through pacing and editing alone. There are some genuinely nerve-wracking moments in ""Deadly Blessing.""

The movie boasts an interesting variety of cast members at various times in their careers. ""Deadly Blessing"" is Maren Jensen's (""Battlestar Galactica"") last big-screen role. It features Sharon Stone in one of her first film appearances. Genre-favorite Michael Berryman (""The Hills Have Eyes"") appears as a creepy mentally handicapped Hittite.

Ernest Borgnine had already won Academy and Golden Globe Awards before taking the role of cult leader Isaiah. Any other actor of his caliber probably would've stuck his nose up in the air and walked away when offered this role in a low-budget horror film. Borgnine instead throws himself into the character and adds a level of class to the movie that takes it to a whole new level.

The audio and video quality for the ""Deadly Blessing"" Blu-ray release is both satisfying and disappointing. The high-definition video transfer breathes new life into the movie without robbing it of any of its original ""real"" film flavor. Although it's ultimately pleasing, the lack of a stereo upgrade does factor into a truly favorable viewing experience.

The bonus material will thrill genre fans. There's audio commentary for the film by director Wes Craven. We also get new interviews with actors Susan Buckner and Michael Berryman in which they reflect on the making of the movie. Interviews with Creature Designer John Naulin and Writers Glenn Benest and Matthew Barr are included as well. TV spots and a theatrical trailer round out the special features.

""Deadly Blessing (Collector's Edition)"" is another feather in the cap of Shout! Factory. These releases give me another chance to catch rare cult films I missed as a child sheltered from the horror genre. My only complaint is the ridiculously cheesy tacked-on finale. If I were a snootier genre fan, that part alone would have ruined the entire experience for me. Putting the end aside, this is the perfect example of a suspenseful thriller that keeps your attention throughout its entire running time.",1358812800,4,3492,5.052083333333333

2041148,4,B0001X1WK8,"If there is a bigger Wes Craven fan than myself, I haven't met them. From his early work, the incomparable ""Last House on the Left"", to his latest work, the hugely entertaining ""Scream franchise"", there are very few movies of his that I don't enjoy on at least some level. Of course, all of this comes into play while reviewing the slasher gem of the night, the little known and unappreciated ""Deadly Blessing."" How people have never heard of such an elegant and supremely suspense film is a mystery to me. Yes, dear reader, it really is that good.

""Deadly Blessing"" begins with young couple Martha (Maren Jensen) and Tom Schmidt (Jonathon Gulla) living in an isolated farm named `Our Blessing', where most of it's population are of the Hittite religion. Jim used to be a Hittite himsef but left the community when he got married. Martha tells matron Louisa Stohler (Lois Nettleton), who is the mother of Faith (Lisa Hartman)that she is pregnant. That night, Tom searches in the barn after hearing strange noises from inside, but is murdered when a mysterious figure runs him over with his tractor. This is seen as a mechanical accident.

Friends Lana Marcus (Sharon Stone) and Vicky Anderson (Susan Buckner) visit Martha after Tom's funeral. Some time after Martha refuses to sell the farm to Isaiah Schmidt (Ernest Borgnine), the leader of the Hittites, and slams the door in his face. When William Gluntz (Michael Berryman) goes to the house at night to search for his shoe he accidentally left earlier when sneaking around, he is stabbed through the back by an unseen figure.

Martha is now being accused of being the incubas. Lana enters the barn the next day to look for something in the haystack but all the doors and windows suddenly close, trapping her inside. In a panic, she searches for a way out but encounters a figure dressed in black. When escaping out the now open barn door William's corpse swoops down at her, hanging from a rope. The police clears up the mess as the sheriff (Kevin Cooney) advises the three friends to move out of town, as someone may be after them. However, Martha descides to stay where she is and buy a gun for protection. Multiple events follow, such as a snake being put into Martha's bathroom while she's taking a bath by an unseen figure who creeps in her house. She manages to get out of the bath and kill it. Little do the friends know that the trouble has only began.

I cannot possibly oversell ""Deadly Blessing"". The cinematography is pitch perfect, the deaths are extremely suspenseful, and the ending, while a bit out there, stays completely true to the story. It is with this film that Craven showed the film world that he could make a horror movie that relied on actual intelligent filmmaking as opposed to cheap scares. While it is true that the film is a bit slow and meanders a bit in its middle act, it is still a fine horror movie that deserves a re-release. If you haven't seen it yet, check it out immediately. Sadly, however, it is only available in region 2 release so unless you have a VCR or a multiregion dvd plyer, you may be out of luck.",1322438400,,3105,4.609403254972875

2041152,3,B0001X1WK8,"Deadly Blessing (Wes Craven, 1981)

The trailers for Deadly Blessing, way back when, made the movie seem spider-obsessed. Spiders crawling into people's mouths and people running through spiderwebs. I was twelve when this movie came out, and had no idea who anyone in this movie was except Ernest Borgnine and Michael Berryman, both of whom I revered as a kid (and still do). And I hated spiders. I had to see it. And man, did it creep me out. Recently, it got a big honkin' DVD special-edition release pretty much everywhere but the U.S. Recently, I grabbed a copy of it and sat down to relive some old nightmares. While the movie hasn't really aged all too well, it does a lot of the things Wes Craven did very well early in his career, and does them in a different way than most early Wes Craven movies, trading in the cutting-edge gore he was infamous for in the late seventies and going for the atmosphere instead.

The movie takes place in a California Hittite commune (as one character says, a line I've remembered for a quarter-century, ""the Hittites make the Amish look like swingers"") where, as we open, the shunned Tom Schmidt (Jonathon Gulla in his only screen appearance) and his wife Martha (Battlestar Galactica's Maren Jensen, who also never worked onscreen again after this film) are living on the edges of the commune. Tom's father Isaiah (Borgnine), the leader of the community, shunned Tom not only for going away to Los Angeles to school, but for bringing back a ""serpent"" wife (the Hittites consider everyone who's a non-Hittite a serpent, at least in this flick) who doesn't share their beliefs. Not long after the film begins, Tom dies in a suspicious tractor accident, and after the funeral, three of Martha's LA friends--Lana (Sharon Stone), Vicky (Grease's Susan Bucker... who one again never worked onscreen after this; are you sensing a trend?), and Melissa (Colleen Riley, who would team up with Craven again four years later for The Hills Have Eyes Part II)--come out to the farm to console her. From here, while it's undoubtedly a cross between a horror flick and a mystery, much of the movie becomes an outsider drama, except that instead of the Hittites being the outsiders, it's the modern folks. (Think Witness here.) Problem is, the four women are being harassed by what the Hittites believe is an incubus, a demon who seduces (figuratively or literally) women in order to turn them away from the faith, but the women themselves believe is the guy who killed Tom. More so, perhaps, because Hittite bodies begin piling up, and the Hittites, believing that the incubus has manifested in Martha, are ready to nail her up and use her as a scarecrow. She finds one friend in the town itself, Faith (veteran TV actress Lisa Hartman), a non-Hittite who is similarly shunned by the community. The women must find out what's going on before either the killer gets them or the Hittites do.

Deadly Blessing does a lot of things right. First and foremost, it's a creepy movie; really effective atmosphere provided by the sets, not to mention Borgnine's crazy Hittite elder. Also, while the script is deeply, deeply prejudiced (though the Hittites aren't a real American religious sect, it's pretty obvious that they're meant to represent the Mennonites), Craven does his best to make the interpersonal relationships between the Hittites and the outsiders levelheaded, at least when the Hittites are treating outsiders like humans (which does occur in a couple of scenes). He also avoids falling into an obvious trap in the Big Reveal, though I can't go into what that is for obvious reasons. And that final scene... man, that's been sticking with me since the early eighties.

While the film has its strengths, it has weaknesses as well, which are divided pretty equally between the script (the already-mentioned prejudice is just the tip of the iceberg) and the acting. It's pretty easy to see why a lot of people who were in this movie never worked again, as their acting is as flat and two-dimensional. However, I am more than willing to grant that in many cases, that may have been the script's fault. Some really, really awful writing here, especially as regards character development, which ranges from the ham-handed to the nonexistent. Some of the characters, even the main ones--especially the main ones, in at least one case--are running around with ""kill me"" tattooed on their foreheads. It does a great deal to undercut the movie's suspense when you know a character exists just to get killed off at some point.

Not at all the brilliant movie I remember, but it still has some undeniable effect. A minor Craven movie, to be sure, but one that Craven fans will probably be satisfied to see, if America ever gets around to doing a whiz-bang DVD release like Europe and Australia have. ***",1243814400,3,4825,4.8295042321644495

""You are a stench in the nostrils of god!""

The above is just some of the exquisite dialogue that awaits you in 1981's ""Deadly Blessing"", an odd offering from Wes Craven, whose first (technically) mainstream production features some wholesome TV stars of the past, trapped in an unmitigated miasma of weirdness. Some of the actors are:

Sweet, exotic/Hawaiian-looking girl next door, Maren Jensen from the 70's ""Battlestar Galactica""; strapping boy next door Doug Barr, the sidekick from the ""The Fall Guy"" TV show; Lisa Hartman from her pre-""Knots Landing"" days; Jeff East, the young Clark Kent from 1979's ""Superman - The Movie""... And the list goes on....

The basic story is (or so it seems): an Amish-like religious sect, called the Hitites, tries to harass and kill the widow of their recently departed kin (not to mention, her city slicker-girlfriends who are visiting) so they can reclaim the ""consecrated"" land ""wrongly"" bequeathed to her. Like all outsiders to this sect, she has been branded the ""Incubus"" (a demon that takes you in your sleep) ... and she must be destroyed!!!

Many viewers find this movie to be wildly incongruent and confusing ... and, you know what, they're all right. Especially guilty is the ending, where the film's three contributing screenwriters must have had some sort of creative mental breakdown. Still, I must also defend the film by saying it has a certain uncanny SOMETHING! This is a horror flick that has a cozy leisurely quality, due, in no small part, to its pastoral setting and TV movie vibe. However, shamelessly applied to this tranquil canvas are a slasher film's prowling camera, leather gloved hands, peeping tom shots of naked women, the foreboding ""Supernatural"", primitive and ritualistic (almost pagan) motifs - spiders, snakes, and chickens ... etc.

As for the quality of the filmmaking, it is quite good. Wes Craven creates a realistic intimacy between the young widow and her girlfriends, and is an elegant craftsman in creating suspense - he only flounders toward the film's climax, where he resorts to bombastic chaos, instead of genuine tension; the photography is, simply put, very atmospheric; and, finally, the score by James Horner (which features rich-sounding ceremonial GONGS) beautifully alternates between the idyllic and the sinister - his only misstep is to pepper the soundtrack with ridiculous chanting, taken straight from the ""The Omen"". Not good.

Since many of the actors were borrowed from television, their performances come off as workmanlike. Not bad, though! Ernest Borgnine, however, shines as he earnestly hams it up as the fanatical leader of the Hitites. A young, slightly Rubenesque Sharon Stone also stands out - not particularly for her acting (it turns out she gives a pretty spacey performance) but for her otherworldly fashion model presence.

As for the film's many twists, they are not satisfyingly calculated ... they are of the slapdash kind ... Almost as if the film's screenwriting trio were sporadically taking drugs to heighten their creativity ... ""making it up as they went along"". Visually, however, the film always works. It's the type of movie that FEELS right, but whose plot motivations are sketchy.

Some of the film's head-scratching moments are:

1. A virginal supporting character is SUDDENLY revealed to be a clairvoyant killer.

2. The protagonist, played by Maren Jensen, discovers that her dead husband's body has been exhumed from its grave and strategically replaced with a horde of frisky chickens that leap out of the coffin and terrify our heroine.

3. A cute, but dowdy, neighbor played by Lisa Hartman, clandestinely paints the Maren Jensen character from across a field while she's doing chores outside her house. She is obsessed with her. Toward the end of the film, the Jensen character discovers the paintings. It is eventually revealed that Lisa Hartman is a hermaphrodite with a crush on Jensen. Also, we discover that Hartman's mother is psychotically overprotective about her half-and-half offspring and will do anything to shield her from heartbreak. The film even intimates that she (not the Hitites) may be the one stalking Jenson and her female houseguests. The final exhausting kicker is when the filmmakers reveal that the Hartman character is the messenger of the ""Incubus"" ... not the Jensen character, who was initially branded by the Hitites. Got all that?

4. Earlier in the film, the Jensen character eventually locates the missing body of her dead husband (good guy Doug Barr) in the barn/studio of Lisa Hartman. He is reverently propped up in his burial clothes like some embalmed maharajah. This does not make any sense since the Hartman character is obsessed with Jensen, not her husband.

Still, despite all of the film's loopy loose ends, I rather watch something cheesily intriguing like ""Deadly Blessing"" over tedious Oscar prestige films like ""The English Patient"" or ""The Hours"". Any day!",1232841600,3,5014,5.137423312883436
