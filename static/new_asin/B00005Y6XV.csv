7956499,4,B00005Y6XV,"This video collection showcases Hal Ketchum's stunning tenor in a reasonably good way. ""Stay Forever,"" ""Past the Point of Rescue,"" and ""Small Town Saturday Night"" are some of the better songs featured. If you are a fan of Mr. Ketchum, you might like this. It goes well with his Hits Collection CD.",1149120000,10,297,4.730769230769231

7956501,5,B00005Y6XV,"I bought this DVD although I am in Australia, because I knew that the chances of getting a Region 4 copy are slim.  Jo Dee is not that well known in Australia, and probably also not that well known in Region 4 countries.  Luckily, my computer DVD Rom is capable of viewing Region 1, otherwise I would miss out.  As an Australian customer, I have only seen Jo Dee occasionally on Pay TV, and had seen ""Bye-Bye"" and ""Burn"", but none of the others were familiar to me.  The track listing is only 9 songs, and it would have been even better if there were more, but this satisfies my longing for the moment.
""Burn"" is great, especially since she asked permission of our wonderful Tina Arena if she could remake her exceptional hit song.  I thought Tina did a stunning job of it, but Jo Dee more than did it justice.  I have to say the video isn't quite as good as I'd hoped though.  Jo Dee is a beautiful woman, but the makeup did not make her look as wonderful as usual.
""That's the Way"" - this video unfortunately annoyed me.  It was too fun and cute for me.  I had built a picture in my mind of the song, and the colourful silliness of this video just didn't really work for me.  ""Closer"" is okay - I love the song, the video is alright.  ""Because you love me"" was pretty good, very symbolic, although I swear there are times when you can see her sort of waiting for the shot to be over.
""Stand beside me"" is great - classic song, great video.  She does  it wonderfully, and looks beautiful.  ""I'm alright"" is also great.  The older songs seem to embrace her strong beauty and really work with it, whereas the newer videos appear to try to soften her, which loses some of her appeal to me.  ""Bye Bye"" again wonderful.
""Do you wanna make something of it"" again great, as is ""Heads Carolina Tails California"".
So I really liked the first two albums and their videos, but the newer videos are trying to remake her look and I don't completely agree.  She has a fantastic smile and when she's looking too serious you can't see it!!!
Great DVD though, I'm very glad that the internet has allowed me to purchase something like this.  In Australia I doubt this will become available.",1055289600,9,2173,4.323456790123457
7956502,5,B00005Y6XV,"I've seen most of her videos...I'm Alright is awesome, Bye Bye is my favorite video of hers, I saw half of Heads Carolina, Tails California, etc...but I don't have this yet, I might buy it, but I want to know what songs are on it, but I can't find that here.  If anyone could tell me how to find out, or just give me a list of the songs, that'd be awesome.  I mostly want to know if the video for ""You Wanna Make Something Of It"" is on there, or ""Downtime"" (I don't know if Downtime HAD a video though).",1014076800,3,503,3.9702970297029703
7956503,5,B00005Y6XV,"Okay, the verrrrrrrry rarely seen on CMT or GAC ""Do You Wanna Make Something Of It"" ALONE makes this DVD well worth the price, but add the never released ""Closer"" and this truly becomes a MUST-HAVE item!!  ""Closer"" is like a video within a video and shows Jo Dee's light-hearted side.

The DVD also contains everything from the vintage ""Heads Carolina, Tails California"" (how hot is that guy?!?!) to ""Burn"". The release of the DVD was supposedly delayed by the record company for the addition of her latest ""Bring on the Rain"" - which is notably absent. :( The video for ""That's the Way"", Jo Dee shows off her dancing prowess with some very asthetically-pleasing dancers and ""I'm Alright"" actually features her MOM!

""Stand Beside Me"" beautifully illustrates the song perfectly, as does the video for the Phil Vassar-penned ""Bye Bye"". My personal fave is the haunting video for the touching ""Because You Love Me"".

It is cool to seeing how Jo Dee has evolved from ""Heads Carolina..."" to ""Burn"", which was filmed in a castle in upstate New York. This is a great DVD for any country music fan. Jo Dee shares the screen with everyone and everything from a mini-Jo Dee, to her mom, to a '66 GTO, to a hot guy, and everything in between! Awesome, awesome, awesome stuff!! I wish there were some extras like behind the scenes footage or Jo Dee's commentary on each video, but oh well.  Thanks Curb Records for giving the fans what they want!",1012176000,20,1435,4.6561264822134385
