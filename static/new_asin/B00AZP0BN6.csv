5538579,5,B00AZP0BN6,"Got my copy of the Princess Twilight DVD in the mail today.
It's very good.

Basically its the best of Twilight Sparkle on the DVD & these 5 episodes prove it.

In Games Ponies Play Princess Cadence Invites Twilight & her friends to The Crystal Empire to prepare for the arrival of the representative to the Equestria Games.

Magical Mystery Cure has Twilight searching for a antidote to her friends awkward behavior. Its also the 3RD season finale how Twilight becomes a princess.
Excellent musical numbers by composer Daniel Ingram.
This episode one of the highest rated in the Hub's history.

In MMMystery On The Friendship Express Pinkie Pie & her pony pals escorts the Cake family's huge cake to the train depot in Ponyville to the best desert contest in Canterlot. On the train some pony ate parts of the cake & its up to Pinkie & Twilight to find the culprit.
(With funny results)

Magic Duel: The Great & Powerful Trixie returns to Ponyville as she challenges Twilight on who's the best magician in the land.

Lesson Zero wraps up the DVD as Twilight scrambles to write a report to the Princess on the lessons of friendship.

Extras has a sing along of A True True Friend (From Magical Mystery Cure)
And printable coloring sheet for the kids.

Lotsa laughs, enjoyable music for all ages well worth getting.",1367452800,8,1314,4.682608695652174
5538580,1,B00AZP0BN6,"Hasbro's got their eyes on pandering to only one of their demographics, and it isn't the one with actual captiol. Weeell you're hurting yourself but not in a crippling way, it's impossible to screw up entirely with this big of a success.

I won't be purchasing anything from them, however, ever.",1367280000,3,295,4.784313725490196
5538581,5,B00AZP0BN6,"Princess Twilight Sparkle is a dvd meant to specifically highlight Twilight, so it shows her best moments (or her spazzing out in lesson zero >.>).

The episodes included are:

Games Ponies Play  (the episode where they try to impress the Equestria Games Inspector so the Crystal Empire can host the games. Twilight leads the welcome and learns self control from Cadence)

Magical Mystery Cure  (the episode where she becomes a Princess)

Mmmystery on the Friendship Express  (the episode where they try to figure out who took a bite out of the cake on the train. You get to see Twilight be a detective)

Magic Duel  (Twilight vs Trixie in season 3)

Lesson Zero  (The episode where she basically loses her mind from worry because she thinks she has to send a friendship letter to Princess Celestia every week and she's late) (Aha, scary Twilight  >.>)

There are two special features (no commentary, but I think those are reserved for the full season boxsets). Those are a printable coloring sheet, and a singalong. The singalong is to the song ""A True, True Friend"" The picture quality is fine. I didn't really notice anything wrong with it. It's in 1:78:1 anamorphic widescreen. The sound is 5.1 surround.

So yeah, if you're a brony, you should definitely get this. Good sales on these lead to more dvds and maybe blu-ray later on too. So, you can't go wrong.",1367280000,14,1363,4.74468085106383
5538582,5,B00AZP0BN6,"My Little Pony is beloved in my house so Paige and I were excited to sit down and watch Friendship is Magic: Princess Twilight Sparkle together. As  soon as Paige heard ""My Little Pony"" and ""princess"" in the same title she was jumping up and down with excitement.

I love the overall theme of these DVD's Friendship is Magic. Paige is at the age where friends are becoming a very important part of her life so it's fun to see the little ponies in their friendships and all the ups and downs that come with them that parallel real life.

What little girl doesn't love princesses? They are magical and beautiful so combine them with the whimsical ponies and you have a hit for all little girls. Paige was so engrossed in this DVD I couldn't tear her away. For days after watching it all she wanted to do was play princess with her little ponies.

I love when a DVD like this comes along with great messages about friendship that encourage imagination and get my child playing with her toys in a creative way. I personally enjoy and appreciate the humor. It's not always fun for parents to watch kids shows but when it makes me laugh and it comes from my generation I actually enjoy watching!

My Little Pony: Princess Twilight Sparkle is a great addition to the My Little Pony series and Paige's new favorite!",1367280000,7,1307,4.474789915966387

As for myself I am willing to wait for a Complete Season 2 and 3 DVD release.

Why the 5 stars you may ask? Well if you have watched the show you will know why.

5538586,4,B00AZP0BN6,"Princess Twilight Sparkle was a very cute episode if you haven't seen it yet! My Little Pony: Friendship Is Magic is a light-hearted show that always teaches good lessons.

My only issue with this product is that it says that it includes 5 episodes, but does not list which episodes (as of the time of posting this). Why would anyone buy a disk set if they aren't sure that they don't already own 4/5ths of the disk set?",1361750400,9,420,4.384615384615385

5538600,5,B00AZP0BN6,"The episode opens in a dark room full of machinery. A vent grating opens and out crawl Jesse, James, and Meowth. They jump into the room and look around, stopping at a large machine. They smile.
The next day, Ash, Misty, and Brock are still walking towards Cerulean City. Brock and Ash are eager to get there, but Misty doesn't share their feelings and makes it known that she doesn't want to go. Unfortunately for her, Ash is set on challenging the city's Gym Leader and won't change his mind.

Once they arrive, Brock notices that Misty isn't following them anymore. Ash isn't exactly torn up about this. As they walk, they notice a very large crowd gathered in front of a store. Interested, they ask as to why everyone is here and find out that it was robbed of a large vacuum and a huge hose, nothing more. Suddenly, Officer Jenny appears asking why they're so interested in the situation. Ash is surprised to see her here as he thought he'd seen her in Viridian City. She explains that the Viridian City Jenny is her Sister-in-law and announces her suspicion of the two. After Ash and Brock clear the matter with Dexter and one of Brock's badges, Brock tries to ask her to dinner. He is, needless to say, turned down and he goes off on his own while Ash searches alone for the gym.

He finds the gym and enters only to find a synchronized swimming performance going on. He is greatly confused until he meets the three girls who were doing the show a little later. They explain that they are the Gym leaders and are the World-famous Sensational Sisters. Ash is eager to fight but the sisters decline, saying that they don't feel like fighting because they had just been beaten three times in a row by Ash's rivals from Pallet Town. All they have left is a wimpy Goldeen.
They are about to just give Ash the Cascade Badge when Misty shows up. She introduces herself as the ""Fourth Sensational Sister,"" but her sisters begin teasing her, saying that they thought she had left and wasn't coming back until she was a Pokmon Master. When she replies that she's only here because Ash was here, they comment on her choice of a boyfriend making Ash fall over Anime style and Misty enraged. She challenges Ash to a match for the Cascade Badge.
Ash tries to send out Pikachu, but he refuses to fight. He sends out Butterfree instead to fight Misty's Staryu. The fight goes on for a couple minutes with Misty's sisters looking on with interest, and Butterfree is defeated. Ash then sends out Pidgeotto and Misty sends out Starmie. Pidgeotto is about to defeat Starmie when Team Rocket makes a not-so dramatic entrance by crashing through a wall.

They were the ones who had stolen the vacuum and hose and were planning on sucking up all the water in the pool to steal the Pokmon swimming in it. They manage in sucking up the Sensational Sisters' Seel and Pikachu is swept into the water. It occurs to Ash that water conducts electricity, so he has Pikachu use a Thunderbolt attack, thus electrocuting Team Rocket. They fall into the pool, get sucked up by the vacuum, and are spit out the other end. Ash shuts off the vacuum just in time to save Pikachu (Seel was outside).
Misty's sisters thank Ash for ridding them of Team Rocket and give him the Cascade Badge as a reward. Misty is upset since he didn't really win the match, but her sisters explain that if he had used Pikachu, Misty wouldn't of stood a chance. They wish them both luck on their journey, and, after meeting up with Brock again, Ash and Misty head off toward Vermilion City.",1382140800,2,3537,4.514820592823713
