2197844,5,B0006Z2NHM,"This is a great film to see on the 25th Anniversary of the Falklands conflict.  A very British film, a lot of the details may at first be unclear to American viewers.  The film chronicles the hectic moments leading up to the illegal Argentine Invasion of the islands in April 1982.

Fans of Ian Richardson will love him in the role of Rex Hunt, the fussy British governor of the Island.  The film is very much seen from his perspective.  Both the absurdity and absolute confusion on the eve of the Argie invasion is conveyed very well.  Hunt was given only very basic information from the British Foriegn Office concerning Argtentine actions.  He is left on his own to piece things together while trying to stay within the rules of diplomatic formality.  In the end he is left with little choice but to piece together a scratch defence with a weak company of Royal Marines.

The film shows how the British tried to stage a symbolic defence.  Hunt opts to concentrate his meager forces around government house, thus sparing the inhabitants the ordeal of a house to house battle in Port Stanley.  With the limited resources at hand, the Royal Marines none the less put up a stout little defence of the island.  Contrast this with the US Marines at Teheran who surrendered without a fight in the Iran hostage crisis just a few years before.

The film really keeps the viewer in suspense as to what will actually happen.  The invasion comes across as a confused, almost comical affair for both sides.  The ensueing firefight at Government House is extremely well done.  Both sides actually did fire a lot of rounds ineffectively at each other.  Those viewers use to seeing bullets and bodies will be surprised here.  I suspect this is how most firefights at night appear, and the film really does a superb job at conveying this.

This is one of the few films available in the US about this conflict.  It won't give you the complete story of course, but it will stimulate your interest to find out more.  Fans of Ian Richardson will love him in this role, and the film has all the absurd qualities of a classic British film.  An Ungentlemanly Act deserves greater noteriety for sure, and what better way to mark the 25th Anniversary of this fascinatingly absurd little war.  The DVD features some minor extras to round out the package.",1193616000,5,2330,4.643031784841075
2197845,4,B0006Z2NHM,Decent little flick about the residents of the Falkland Islands just prior to the invasion by Argintine forces. Good British dialog (some very hard to understand) but filmed on location and interesting stuff. Good attention to detail and illustrates the stubborn pride of the Brits and the Royal Marines. Not an epic but interesting to watch.,1163116800,2,342,5.125
2197846,5,B0006Z2NHM,"""An Ungentlemanly Act"" is a gem of a film.  The movie recounts the events leading to the Argentine capture of the Falklands in early April 1982.  Without background music or typically staged settings, the story allows the viewer to almost act as a witness to the actions of Governor Rex Hunt and the Royal Marine Garrison as they prepare for an invasion they cannot hope to halt by themselves.

If the portrayals are true, as the opening pre-credit text indicates, one cannot come away with anything but admiration for Governor Hunt and Major Mike Norman, the newly minted commander of the garrison, as they prepare the colony and its modest military contingent for the inevitable.  Both the Governor and Major Norman act pragmatically, yet temper themselves and their compatriots with a great sense of national pride and patriotism as they steadfastly work to repel the invaders and up hold sovereignty until the absolute end.  The films credits both men with the calm leadership that gives an example of people performing at their best when their circumstances are very dire.",1141689600,16,1077,4.994413407821229
2197847,4,B0006Z2NHM,"&#65279;This is a very good, made-for-TV 1992 movie that apparently fairly accurately depicts the opening salvos of the Falkland-Islands war between Argentina and Great Britain. The events shown take place over an approximately 24-hour period on 1-2 April 1982. Surprisingly, only one person died on that first day, although subsequent hostilities claimed 255 British and some 645 Argentine lives. The always watchable Ian Richardson gives an excellent performance as the beleaguered governor. There is a fair amount of humor--some of it black humor, which testifies to the absurdity of war in general and this little war in particular.

Bonus materials include cast biographies, a detailed (26 frames!) timeline describing events from 2 Feb. to 12 Oct. 1982, and a brief fact file for the Falkland Islands. The DVD is only in standard (4:3) aspect ratio and, especially in the first third or half, focus is very soft and colors are off (on the reddish side). Nevertheless, the movie is quite viewable and has some good scenery shots and superb performances.",1127692800,17,1058,5.223529411764706
2197848,5,B0006Z2NHM,"I will begin by saying that I have not actually bought this DVD, I first saw this film when it was shown on the BBC for the tenth aniversary of the outbreak of the war.  It has the taste of an Ealing comedy, laced with delicious black humour.

The previous reviewer seems to have completely missed the point with the regard to chauvanism or nationalism.  This film is devoid of either.  The news footage at the end of the fim serves to illustrate the cost in lives of this pointless war, a contest between two vastly unpopular governments, redeemed only by the courage of the men who fought in it.

  I will admit, if you are american the first few minutes of this film won't make much sense.  Mention of Scrap Metal merchants on South Georgia will have no meaning.  Those of us who were living in the UK at the time will have no problem recalling the newspaper headlines and the TV coverage.

The film itself offers an accurate depiction of the comic-opera start to Britain's last great Imperial adventure.  The Falkland Islanders were none to pleased by the way they were depicted in the movie and some of the British military personnel's low opinion of them was shown as well.

The acting was uniformly excellent, Ian Richardson and Bob Peck never do a bad turn.  The script was terrific too, there are some great one-liners.  For anyone thinking of buying this I would say go ahead and give yourself a treat.",1110672000,17,1412,4.529644268774703
2197849,3,B0006Z2NHM,"This is an account of the Falkland Island invasion of April 1, 1982 by Argentine troops.  It's mildly interesting, in large part because of the ever-arresting presence of Richardson and the convincing acting by old pro Rosemary Leach.  But the film has major flaws.  The opening ten minutes are puzzling, as the plot is not at all clear and some of the characters cannot be understood.  The invasion scenes show several thousand rounds of bullets being fired with only one person killed.  Several of the minor characters in the story, such as the two people manning a radio station, never quite come to life.

The larger point of the film is British chauvinism.  After the fall of the town, the whole point of the film, news clips appear for a minute or two at the end showing live footage of the British reconquest of the tiny islands.  There's Margaret Thatcher and the flag and the music...  It helps to be British to enjoy this minor television film.",1108512000,7,954,4.664670658682635
8044173,5,B0006Z2NHM,"This was an excellent film, shown from a British perspective. It was very well done and accurate according to the reading I have done regarding this conflict.

I was somewhat disappointed that they did not tell the story of the recapture of the Falklands, but that would have been much better suited for a film of its own or as a mini-series. There was also only a reference to the Royals that had traveled to South Georgia and the amazing fight that took place there. It would've been great to see that also.

Either way, excellent film. A great addition for any fan of history.",1502236800,,579,4.504761904761905

8044175,2,B0006Z2NHM,The quality of the recording / image was pretty poor.,1474329600,,53,4.4
8044176,5,B0006Z2NHM,"Besides its witty script (which takes surprisingly little dramatic license with the historical facts), this delightful motion picture was filmed almost entirely in the Falkland Islands and uses the actual locations that featured in the 1982 war. Government House, the streets of Stanley, the Catholic Church and the countryside around Stanley are all put to great use. As someone used to seeing war movies filmed nowhere near their supposed settings (the scene of George C. Scott striding around the ruins of ""Carthage"" in the film Patton -- which was actually filmed in Morocco), I found it a remarkable thing to actually see a war movie filmed where the war took place. For the most part the acting is superb, the story hews close to the facts, and the characterizations are more or less accurate. There are a few composite characters and a handful of telescoped scenes but you feel almost as if you're watching a documentary. And filmed within a decade of the actual Falklands War, you get to see Stanley more or less the way it was at that time, not as developed as it is today (I was there in 2015). A remarkable film and a must for war buffs or Falkland Islands enthusiasts.",1452643200,3,1180,4.733009708737864
8044177,3,B0006Z2NHM,"Fun watching and informative, and gives you an accurate feel for life in such an isolated society as those islands, however it could have done a much better job of shedding light on the motives of both sides.",1368921600,,208,4.5
8044178,5,B0006Z2NHM,"This is an historically accurate portrayal of the infamous 1982 invasion,  Filmed in Stanley and actually has cameos of the Royal Marine Commander Major Mike Norman.  I sent a copy to President Christina Fernandez-Kirchner so she could enjoy also!!!",1363219200,3,249,5.358974358974359
8044179,5,B0006Z2NHM,Excellent acting and outstanding subject matter of the events leading up to and including the beginning of the Falklands battle from the perspective of the island dwellers and assigned Royal Marines.  The thump of L1A1s in action is worth the admission price alone!,1356739200,2,265,5.162790697674419
8044180,3,B0006Z2NHM,"I love Ian McKellan especially in ""To Play a King.""  This was very slow moving and quite frankly boring. I found myself dozing off. Not sure why so many other reviewers rated it so high.",1270512000,,186,4.314285714285714
8044181,4,B0006Z2NHM,I won't go into the story line. I believe the Falklands War are well documented. This a well written and performed story. Sir Ian Richardson as in almost every thing he does is wonderfull. I highly recommend this DVD.,1252800000,2,217,4.589743589743589
