1848681,5,B00008K7AM,This Was Such A Funny Movie. Rob Schnieder Rules. The Transformation Aint Realistic But The Movies Pure Hilarious. Everyone Should Watch It.,1052956800,,140,5.409090909090909
1848682,4,B00008K7AM,"alright it's not an oscar winning role it's not trying to be..this movie is stupid...but a very funny kind of stupid....I just got this dvd today and i must say i did enjoy this movie. it made me laugh. The out takes is also very hilarous..
if you want a intelligent thoughtful movie this movie isn't for you..but if you wanna watch a movie that will make you laugh out loud. this is absolutley the movie for you.",1052870400,,413,4.3076923076923075
1848683,5,B00008K7AM,"Rob Schneider is the best comedy actor, I`ve see.
 The movie is a very nice representation of what can happen if a man change of body with a woman, the true is The Hot Chick is the best comedy movie of the last 10 years, and anybody can say not, because There`s Something About Mary (I thinked this was the best comedy movie of all the times, but now, I don`t think it) won too much awards for be the most funny comedy movie, But now, I can say, The Hot Chick is the better movie of all the times.",1052179200,,497,3.97
1848684,4,B00008K7AM,"Anyone who sees this movie will be pleasantly pleased with the wackiness and silliness of it all. The plot is light and fast paced and the jokes keep coming one right after another. Rob Schneider plays a criminal who switches bodies with a rude and mean spirited teenaged girl and the two desperately try to find ways to get back into their old bodies. I don't want to say anymore because to say too much would spoil the fun of the movie, but I think there is plenty of fun to be had with this movie. Anna Faris, an extremely talented comedic actress willing and able to do anything for big laughs, especially shines as Jessica's best friend. She, more than the quirky and mildly funny Schneider, is the reason to watch this film. A film that might tug at your heart a few times and keep you smiling from start to finish.",1051920000,4,821,4.372549019607843

1848729,3,B00008K7AM,"You have seen it a million times from ""Freaky Friday"" (Disney) to ""Vice Versa"" with Judge Reinhold. This movie is one of the most formula stories around. So now it boils down to if you like the acting style and the ""one liners."" Or if you just like to ogle young girls and extra hairy guys.

The basic story is simple. A person who in intentionally rude, but unconscious of the rudeness, soon will find tables turned (gaining or losing an appendage in the process) and learn to feel for the other person. Then again it is the story of making mugging and dancing a little easier if you have the right body.

For an excellent version, that excels at exchanging bodies, watch ""Goodbye Charlie."" Debby Reynolds did not have to act like a baseball player to emphasize the change.",1503360000,,774,4.521428571428571

For those who like offensive movies also known as raunchy, this is rather tame.

1848849,4,B00008K7AM,"I'm emailing you regarding an employee you toke my call on Amazon video issue. Her name is Tara or Cara. You was not only unprofessional but was rude and undermining when she toke my call even when I asked that to have another customer service to help me who was not rude and is capable of performing the job she just said ""okay"" place me on hold and came back on line again.
Tara spoke to me with ""uh huh"" each time after I answer her questions.
Half way through trouble shooting and updating my PlayStation 3 for 15 mins  she was mad that I didn't know what she was talking about when she told me ""to go to setting on the Roku"". She never apologize for her mistake and made me felt like I did not know what I was talking about.
The issue of the video is lack of speaking sound, but background music/sound were heard which was explained multiple time but she kept asking ""are you sure your tv sound is not muted"".
After we got the speaking sound working. Th movie no longer plays in HD as purchased.
After I clarified with Tara that yes the device was plugged into an HDMI outlet. She proceed to ask ""are you sure your tv has HDMI"" I mean seriously?
I've been a long time customer of Amazon since it was only books purchase. And since I've purchase everything on Amazon. This experience was terrible and I'm flabbergasted that such employee is working with Amazon.

1848906,2,B00008K7AM,"Oh, man......indefensible on so many levels......however, the game cast delivers and gets away with the cinematic equivalent of murder here.  It's the ol' body switcheroo premise once again when a selfish teenage girl changes places with a scuzzy low-level crim.  Poorly written but manages to squeeze out a number of big laughs, regardless, thanks to the enthusiasm of McAdams, Faris and, of course, the ever-likeable Schneider.  If you haven't tired of crude comedies with a sentimental streak you'll get some joy, otherwise this will likely get the schlacking it maybe deserves.

1848925,4,B00008K7AM,"The Hot Chick movie, was a little disappointing for me, maybe because I am a homosexual, and would have gone in a more adult direction, that made a real social psychological statement about being unashamed of being gay and transgender, and maybe realizing that you need to come out, because heterosexuality wasn't your real cup of tea anymore.  The film had an excellent flow in editing idea, plot, and what I like to call film movement, but I think the film was made to appeal to heterosexual audiences mythology of how gay or transgender people are expected to act in heterosexuals minds and eye.  The film could have been both funny but yet a serious comedy that made a statement, but yet lost non of its expected and obvious mirth, which the director did not take advantage of as a film.",1437177600,,791,4.602836879432624

As for Rob Schneider...I want to like him, but he just hasn't made a movie that I've seen that I can like him in.  Even putting Rachael McAdams mind into his body doesn't help.  The scenes of him ""learning"" how to be a man were just awkward...not a chuckle out of me there.  The only thing that made me laugh at all was when he called ""his"" former boyfriend, crying and speaking as McAdams would and the boyfriend believing it was a former priest or camp counselor he knew...I think I can be considered creepy for enjoying that.  Overall, this film had promise but it just crashed and burned and nobody noticed until after it had been released to theaters.  So many of its jokes are forced and there's no chemistry between McAdams, Schneider, or any of the supporting characters, even when there's supposed to be.

Rob Schneider and Rachel McAdams switch bodies, and so Rob Schneider plays a girl trapped in a 30-year-old guy's body. The movie goes through all the usual jokes in this type of movie (bathroom scene, ""lesbo"" romance, etc), but does it well. The movie really focuses on Rob Schneider's antics, rather than Rachel McAdams. That's one thing that could have been done better, to go back and forth between the characters more, especially because Rachel McAdams herself is such a talented actress. Overall, a good attempt at a redoing a classic theme.",1307145600,,657,4.771929824561403

1849073,3,B00008K7AM,"This is a good movie and that's about as far as I'll go with it. What you get with the HOT CHICK is a switcheroo movie like Freaky Friday, Like Father Like Son, Wish Upon a Star, 17 Again, 18 Again!, Big and 13 Going on 30. In other words, the concept has been done many many many times. The big difference here is that Rob Schneider, a dirty, sleazy plumber, switches places with Hot Chick Cheerleader and all around popular socialite Jessica (Rachel McAdams).

This gives Rob Schneider some ample time to show off his hilarious girly side. The problem is, this was Rachel McAdam's first big film in the U.S. and who would have known, at the time that this film came out, that she was gonna be the huge star that she is right now.  Well, anybody who saw the film and the few scenes that she was in, would have known.  Every single fleeting scene that she participated in was hilarious.

To watch McAdams portray Rob Schneider was equally or even more hilarious than Schneiders portrayal of her. Yet, once the transformation takes place, we barely see McAdams anymore. This, to me, is the problem. The filmmakers focused all their attention on Schneiders side of the story and lost many opportunities to use McAdams comedic talents.

THE HOT CHICK is still a good movie and better than most comedies that come out these days, especially because this is where Rachel McAdams launched from. This is where Rachel McAdams showed how good and funny she was... unfortunately, the creators of THE HOT CHICK didn't have the foresight to use her more.",1291075200,,1542,4.613138686131387
1849074,4,B00008K7AM,"What I like about the Hot Chick is that it's ""appropriately"" funny meaning it's not a dirty teenage comedy like so many other films released at the time.

There's no sex or crude humor in the Hot Chick unlike so many other teenage comedies, so this is a movie that people of all ages can appreciate and not be offended by.

The plot is about a teenage girl waking up one day as a man because she stole something valuable in a shopping mall that results in a curse, and the guy she turns into is... Rob Schneider's character.

This means Rob Schneider's character has to convince her friends... I mean HIS friends that he's actually the same person, but a guy now.

It's a very inoffensive style of comedy without hardly any cussing or inappropriate scenes, as I mention above.  Very very rare to see teenage comedies that are like this these days.

It has its dry moments of storytelling which is why I take exactly ONE point away from the overall rating, but besides that, I recommend it to everybody who's in the mood for a light-hearted comedy film.",1287619200,,1052,4.481675392670157
1849075,4,B00008K7AM,"Attractive girls, hijinks and hair removal, this movie has it all :)

I saw this a few years ago, and my husband and I liked it so much that I bought it for our anniversary. Adam Sandler (Happy Gilmore) produced movies are as usual as silly as they can be. This one, however, elicited many laughs from my husband and I, and we usually don't like overly silly movies. This one, however, was not, and has a moral: You learn how to treat people and what is really important, as the girl was popular in her high school and treated others who weren't in her clique badly. It turns out that when things went bad, it was them she needed to get through it. There's a few relationships in the movie that need tweaking, which adds the conflict films need to work. I did like the relationship between her and her brother, who is going to be probably one of the best female impersonators when he grows up :)Watch for the scene where after the switch, she tries to do the same seductive action at the mall, this time as a man, and the dance club scene.

The Hot Chick takes the Freaky Friday switch and made it work. This is just one review, see The Hot Chick and draw your own conclusions!",1286236800,,1177,4.273542600896861
1849076,5,B00008K7AM,"""The Hot Chick"" is an extremely hilarious movie about a girl who suddenly switches bodies with a man who is a wanted criminal. The film deals with the girl and her friends trying to find out what has happened and their efforts in getting the girl back to her female self. Rob Schneider is excellent as ""the girl"" whose body has invaded the wanted fugitive.

 The film sort of reminds me of ""Freaky Friday"" where a girl switches bodies with her mother.

 Upon release to theatres in 2002 ""The Hot Chick"" went on to enjoy enormous boxoffice raking in over $50,000,000 worldwide. The DVD set sold huge quantaties as well. The DVD includes deleted scenes, an alternate ending, a music video, and much more.

 ""The New York Post"" says, ""I haven't laughed harder at anything this year!""",1282262400,,780,4.656934306569343
1849077,1,B00008K7AM,"Do you want to know how awful this movie really is? Well, imagine a large pizza that's covered in dead crickets, dead earthworms, and dead centipedes. Then imagine rotten frog legs and some disgusting pig feces wrapped in a tortilla. And then imagine a carton of milk that's been expired since the summer of 2002. So now, It's dinnertime, and this is the main course. So what's the point of all this? Well, personally, this is how I felt like when I was watching this poor excuse for a comedy. It felt like the entire movie was feeding me nothing but s***! The jokes are stale, the teenage girls were annoying as hell, and Rob Schneider.....well, he should just stay away from comedy. Why? Because he sucks at it! I will admit, though, that there are far worse comedies than this, such as Freddie Got Fingered and The Master of Disguise. But this one, The Hot Chick, is just plain bad.

While Martin's physical comedy far outstrips Rob Schneider's, Schneider brings a sweetness and believability to the screen, and as the movie progresses I grew very fond of him...er, her.

A popular girl who takes things for granted named Jessica steals some cursed earrings from a store in the mall while with her hot girl-friends. They go to a gas station that's being robbed by Clive Maxtone. Clive pretends to be the gas station employee. Somehow, she drops an earring and Clive finds it. The next day, Jessica finds out she's switched bodies with Clive. She tries to tell her best friend April about it, but she doesn't believe her at first. Throughout the movie, a lot of hilarious situations happen such as Jessica trying to use the restroom standing up, and getting her boyfriend to believe. Across town, Clive is in Jessica's body and taking advantage of the situation by becoming a stripper and making more money. Later, Jessica learns some valuable lessons.

1849083,2,B00008K7AM,"It's hard to put this any other way, The Hot Chick is one of worst movies in the history of cinema.  Frankly, I'm amazed that any serious actor would even give this pile of garbage a second look, and since Rachel McAdams and Anna Farris are the only serious actresses - and that's being quite generous - it's clear that everyone involved is either a career masochist, or completely oblivious to how bad the idea for this movie was when they read the script.  And if it's the latter, then they have the decision making skills of an infant.

The plot of this movie - and I'm using the words plot and movie loosely - is based off of the tired storyline where one person has their personality switched with another.  In this case, it's an incompetent male theif (Rob Schneider) being switched with the typical, prettiest girl in the class (Rachel McAdams) who also happens to be heinously mean.

It's up to the girl (Schneider) and her/his friends to find out how and with whom the switch took place.  Unfortunately, the people behind this travesty decided it would be a good idea to have Rob Schneider not only dress in women's clothes, but also chose a size that would only have worked if he were 50 lbs. lighter.  Aside from that, the movie is awkward in that ""accidentally waving to someone who's waving to someone behind you"" sort of way.  From nail-painting scenes, pillow fights, and an entire movie full of scenes of a 40-year old guy hanging out with three teenage girls, it just fails on every single possible level.

The most preposterous part of the entire movie is the fact that a teenage girl goes missing for an entire week, and her parents hardly even notice.

I'm sure there's a message in there, a completely insane message of tranny-acceptance or something like that, and an completely failed attempt at cohesion, but I started to feel nauseous after about 30 minutes of seeing Schneider's ugly mug in Hello Kitty t-shirts; so, I obviously had to fight through the rest of the trainwreck.",1208649600,,2003,4.632768361581921

1849086,3,B00008K7AM,"As utterly uninspired and ridiculous as `The Hot Chick' is (and what Rob Schneider movie isn't utterly ridiculous) I couldn't help but find it funny.  Sure, none of the laughs are really original and none of them are smart or witty in the way that some newer comedies have been but `The Hot Chick' will succeed it smacking your funny bone around quite a bit.  It's stupid humor, and as can be assumed by the main star and the subject matter it's going to be `dirty' humor as well, but it's humorous and that's what counts.

The story revolves around rich snob Jessica and petty thief Clive who magically switch places after a pair of cursed earrings cross their paths.  I know, I know, the beginning is a total `Mummy' rip off but come on, it's stupid yet funny.  Anyways, with this pair of earrings in their possession (each has one half of the set) they wake up in the others body and that's when everything hits the fan.  Clive is happy with his newfound situation since he realizes he can use Jessica's body to make much more money but Jessica is devastated to wake up in Clive's body (who wouldn't be) and so she enlists the help of her best friend April and a slew of other girls to get her old body back.

This is far from an original idea and the funny is far from fresh, but it's still extremely funny.  It's predictable as all get out but it's mindless fun and sometimes you just want to sit back, turn off the brain and soak in the funny.

Rob Schneider is not the most talented actor or even the funniest comedian but here he does serve up laughs effectively.  I just love Anna Faris.  She has that whole `sweet girl' shtick brilliantly and while this is not her best performance it is still delightful.  Michael O'Keefe and Melora Hardin are effective as Jessica's troubled parents who look to their mysterious gardener (Clive, er um, Jessica) for advise.  The rest of the cast is hot or miss and no one else really has enough screen time to justify a shout out but no one takes away from the film and Adam Sandler's cameo is quite memorable and entertaining.

So, it's not perfect, not even close, but as far as commercial comedies go it's worth watching at least once.  Just know not to expect anything revolutionary or thought provoking, but I'm sure that you can ascertain that by the cover of the DVD, let alone the name that occupies the `starring' slot.",1196899200,,2373,4.448036951501154

If you haven't turned it off by that point (it was a close thing for me) then it does actually start to get funny, once the 'accident' happens.

I guess I have sheer boredom or desperation to thank for actually watching this abysmal feature about a thief who finds a magical earring, which transforms him into a blonde teenager overnight.  This body transforming-opposite sex switcharoo has been done time and time again, but not this badly.

If the dwarf size Schneider makes you laugh because he looks like he's been on a narcotics binge for months on end, you might like this film.  I can cut the guy some slack because the script is so horrible that it would be hard for Lawrence Olivier to be convincing.

The majority of scenes intended to make you laugh are physical bits that aren't remotely funny.  Girls having pillow fights where Schneider overpowers them and sends them flying through the air with each blow (literally), the standard overweight character that dances sexy even though it's the most vile thing you've ever seen.  Schneider falling down bleachers, smashing his face against every seat, a cross dressing eight-year-old boy...

Adam Sandler has been stealing money for years because this same movie going public has made him a superstar.  He makes a cameo, talks so low you can't understand a word he's saying and wears quite possibly the worst wardrobe ever assembled by a costume designer.

Two things make this film at least worth watching if you're as mind numbingly bored and desperate as I was last night:  1)  Whoever the Foley Artist was for this film should never work again.  Pillows making contact, Schneider falling down, rear end slapping..it's all the same sound.  It's exactly like someone stood on a third story balcony and dropped a suitcase full of bowling balls onto the street below.

1849098,3,B00008K7AM,"""The Hot Chick"" pretty much beats out its bad teen comedies competition and is a whole lot more subtle and cutting edge than ""Freaky Friday"". I normally do not find Rob Schneider particularly entertaining but because he is only one of three main characters he does not feel compelled to carry the whole movie and his performance is reasonably restrained. Normally I feel much the same about Adam Sandler but he is hilarious as the bongo playing ""you can put your weed in there"" salesman.

The classic scene is when the mother falls on the family cat, complete with expected sound effects.

Rachel McAdams and Anna Faris are excellent. McAdams ""Mean Girls"" performance was obviously not an accident and fortunately Faris can play someone besides Scary Movies' Cindy Campbell. Maria-Elena Laas is perfect as McAdams rival.

What elevates ""The Hot Chick"" are many subtle components in its mixed bag of humor. Although much of the scatological humor is moronic there is a whole lot of underplayed stuff that is flat-out funny. For example: when the security guards arrest Bianca for shoplifting one of them says ""you are coming with us Winona"" and when McAdams is opening the box jewelry box the suspenseful music is being supplied by a stoned Sandler on the bongos.

1849099,3,B00008K7AM,"I do believe that this movie is quite hilarious. People say it is stupid, well, of course it is, but it's fun to see how a woman can cope up with herself and her surroundings in a male's body. The acting was really hilarious.

Rob Schneider is great at acting out mistaken identities like ""The Animal"" for instance. He can really carry out the personalities of the other character he's playing in the movie. It's almost like he's acting 2 people in a movie.

Basic Plot:

Jessica(Rachel Adams), a mean teenage girl, starts off the movie with her and her friends stealing the magic earings that, which she doesn't,know can change people's identities. She wears them to a gasoline station where Clive (Rob Schneider), a theif is stealing away goods at a small food shop. She accidently drops her other earing and Clive took it. This is where the craziness begins. The next day, Jessica finds herself in Clive's body and is desperate to get her original body back while Clive is in Jessica's body. Clive uses Jessica's body to gain money at a local strippers night club.

Overall, I thought the movie was nuts but hilarious at the same time. It's a good watch especially during boring days. Sure can make you laugh.

1849100,2,B00008K7AM,"Rob Schneider is a great character actor (see 50 First Dates or Big Daddy), but when he's handed the hollywood reins, it just doesn't quite work out (see The Animal or Deuce Bigelow). Movies like this one or The Animal have a few really great moments, ones that you'll be able to remember later, but that's about it.

In The Hot Chick, Schneider plays a sleezy crook who switches bodies with a girlie, giggly prom queen named Jessica (played by Rachel McAdams). The movie mostly centers around Schneider attempting to play a high school girl, and I say ""attempting"" because he's not that convincing. McAdams, on the other hand, in her very limited screen name, manages to do what Rob Schneider cannot-- pretend to be a sleezy man trapped inside a beauty queen's body. Jessica obviously wants her body back, and is utterly grossed out to be a guy. She does manage to convince her friends that it really is her inside this man's body, so they nickname her ""Spence"" and have her pose as the janitor just so she can attend school. What's the con-man doing with the hot body? Stripping, of course, and conning and stealing because it's much easier to do as a sexy woman than as a sleezy looking little weasel.

We see very little of McAdams in this movie, which is one of it's biggest faults. This is also a plot that has been been done so many times, that in order to do it, you have to do something really original. I like the concept of a con-man switching bodies with a high school girl, but there was no balance between these two characters. It should've been called The Rob Schneider Movie. Yes, he's funny and entertaining, but that doesn't make this movie good. If you're a Rob Schneider fan, you'll definitely love this movie. Everyone else... all I can say is rent before you buy.",1123891200,,1785,4.540372670807454
1849101,5,B00008K7AM,"Like ""Animal Farm"" and ""The Handmaid's Tale,""  ""The Hot Chick"" is another insightful cautionary tale warning us of the inevitable fallout created by a capitalist economy.  In this case it's the hollow, narcissistic personalities the system must nurture to sustain its existence.

""Jessica"" is an ordinary suburban high school girl who does and buys what she is told to, and like so many teenagers today she experiences an emptiness inside that seems impossible to fill.  She looks to her peers, to boys, to the media, to fashion -- but these are all external things.  This emptiness can only be filled by a father figure, who, due to the demanding nature of today's corporate world, was rarely home during most of her upbringing.  In this sense, Jessica is the feminine counterpart of the feral Victor from Truffaut's ""L'Enfant Sauvage.""  There is no caring Dr. Itard in suburbia, however, and in order to survive this ""jungle,"" Jessica must transform into her own protective father figure -- only she has had no proper role model; she can only fashion herself after the most primitive male archetype, brilliantly portrayed by ""The Animal"" Schneider.

This is the second film in Tom Brady's ""Animal"" trilogy, and here he makes clear his desire to make a collection of films that establish a moderate position between the somewhat pessimistic and chaotic vision of Geoffrey Reggio's ""Qatsi"" trilogy and the hopeful, synchronistic themes found in Krzysztof Kieslowski's ""Three Colors"" films.

Learning to overcome shame is one of the main themes of ""The Hot Chick.""  When Jessica cries to her friends ""It's me!"" and they only see Schneider, this awakens many a subconscious fear in the audience of rejection due to deficiencies in their own psychological dynamics: whether it be parental dysfunction, sexual confusion, lack of education, poor economic status, or their brother Arnie.  The audience's fear of openly confronting this shame might explain the film's less than stellar performance at the box office, but successful home video run.

Many of Jessica's epiphanies in ""The Hot Chick"" are similar to those Carl Jung had during his time in Africa, which Brady cleverly alludes to in a cameo by Adam Sandler.  Here Brady uses Sandler to link Jung's idea of a collective unconscious with Wassily Kandinsky's synesthetic theories, which were used heavily in P.T. Anderson's Sandler vehicle, ""Punch Drunk Love.""

But where ""Punch Drunk Love"" represented Sandler's emotions with abstract sound and imagery, ""The Hot Chick"" takes a more direct approach, rejecting Kandinsky's reliance on abstraction and mysticism.  And just to be sure we understand he isn't merely putting a phallus in the O'Keeffe, Brady also cleverly rejects Freudian drive theory in the bathroom urinal sequence.  What's left seems to be an outlook in alliance with Swiss psychologist Alice Miller's -- a belief that conflicts with one's parents must be resolved or else one will remain a prisoner of childhood forever.  (A forewarning about not addressing this issue is dramatically illustrated when we see Jessica's younger brother dancing in front of a mirror, wearing lipstick and a brassiere.)

For the most part ""The Hot Chick"" succeeds in all of its intentions, and unlike other films in its genre (Terry Gilliam's ""Brazil"" for instance) gives the viewer a sense of hope -- and a challenge: Address ""The Animal"" inside yourself, and save our world from the dehumanizing corporate machine that exploits our shame and turns us into obedient drones.

1849104,1,B00008K7AM,"The Touchstone comedy entitled THE HOT CHICK (2002) is an ugly and uninspired lump of less-than-interesting characters, a formulaic plot, sloshy sentimentality, and overplayed, raunchy humor.

I kept thinking, ""I can't believe they made a movie about this.""

We have two `magic' earings; when two different persons put them on, they swap bodies. With that, we require very little effort to figure out where the story will go. Meet Jessica (Rachel McAdams): a popular but snobbish high school girl. She likes strolling around with her girlfriends. Enter Clive (Rob Schneider): a low-living dudd who has little going for him. And so, as it happens, Clive mugs Jessica. Man, and chick, put on earrings, thus switching forms. Man and chick must reacquire their original bodies. That's it.

At no point did I begin to care for the characters. Maybe that's because the story's basic problem - to say nothing yet of the way it was played off - is so ludicrous that it renders any serious overtones nearly entirely overlookable. Adding to that problem is the relentlessly juvenile quality of the comedy, that begs us, on hands and knees, to take next to nothing seriously. So absolutely silly - and sustained - is this humor that, when the usual moment to promote a couple serious elements arrives, the movie shifts into a misplaced moralizing tone, toting that ""inner beauty"" line after already implying that the outside package is King. And this behind a wake of sex-ploitation ad nauseum.

THE HOT CHICK is your standard role/body reversal flicks, this time it's Rob Schneider's petty thief with caustic teen beauty Rachel MacAdams.  Schneider's impersonation of a teenager is hilarious and witty, and surprisingly very touching.  His rapport with Jessica's best friend, Jessica's father and brother is priceless and engaging.  Whether he's strutting around like a prissy drag queen, or trying to utilize his/her new peeing vessel, Schneider chews up the role and is gloriously funny.  The fart/peeing gags work this time because they are part of the plot--imagine the difficulty a girl might have in using a urinal.  Schneider as the gardener, the janitor, the cheerleader, he's a real hoot.

And once again we get the talented and underrated actress Anna Faris in the role of Jessica's friend, April.  Faris has been the heart and soul of the SCARY MOVIE trilogies, a physical, sensual and sensitive performer who gives her all to any role she tackles.  Here she's brilliant as the best friend who finds herself falling in love with the man Jessica's become.  Other wonderful performances include: Michael O'Keefe as Jessica's jock father who wants to rekindle his marital passion; Matt Weinberg as Jessica's little brother, Boogar, who likes to dress up in his sister's clothes; Matthew Lawrence as Billy, Jessica's boyfriend who has a hard time believing Schneider is his girl.  Add Adam Sandler's spacy bongo player in a few hilarious scenes, and you have a very funny, entertaining and surprisingly touching movie.  I think it's Schneider's best so far.  Remember, it is a comedy and you don't have to take it too seriously, but it's worth a look.",1091059200,15,1791,5.030508474576271

It is not worth the $17.99 it is still listed as, but it is worth a rental.  The cast of girls and the interaction with Rob Schneider makes for some amusing scenarios.
The plot is not surprising, but it is not insulting - given the premise.  It doesn't bog down in lessons or morales. I was again surprised.

Age plays a huge factor for the audience - I'd recommend it to teenagers and people in their 20's, but anyone much older or younger will probably find it repulsive or confusing.
The basic storyline is that Jessica, this stereotypical popular girl, accidentally switches bodies with a disgusting man (played Rob Schneider).  She overcomes a gazillion challenges while trying to get her body back and Rob Schneider should really be commended for his acting.  Sure, this sort of character isn't going through any extreme mental drama, but it isn't as if normal teenage girls act just like her, either.  Every nuance of over-superficiality is purposely there to make the audience laugh, and I can honestly say I was rolling on the floor with by the end of the movie (whether it be the first time I watched it or the tenth).
While almost every scene contained something hilarious, my favorite was when Rob Schneider and three other girls were having a pillow fight and s/he doesn't know her/his own strength and ends up practically throwing the other girls in the walls and knocking them out.  Whoever was Anna Faris' stunt double did a fantastic job.
Overall, it's just a fun, happy romance/drama/comedy/action/etc. that deals with a wide variety of teenage issues, from accepting one's culture (as seen in Ling-ling, one of the girls in Jessica's clique) to parental marriage trouble.",1087257600,,1604,4.92962962962963
1849115,5,B00008K7AM,"The movie ""THe hot chick""is the funniest movie I'v ever seen!!!
The subject of the movie is amusing and interesting, I have never seen a movie with such a unique idea. The movie began as a legend of a pair of earrings who swich bodies. The movie itself is at the year 2002, it is about a young girl named Jessica how has a perfect life: the perfect look, the perfect boyfriend, the perfect friends... .
Jessica saw in an antiquity shop this earrings, but jessica didn't know what this earrings can do. The owner of the shop told here that the earrings are not for sale but Jessica wanted them for the home-comming prom so she stole them.
As Jessica and her friends were on their way home Jessica lost one of the earrings and a 30 year old man who stole from a gase stashion found the earring. Here the story gets complicated, Jessica gets the body of a man, no-one belives here and she is miserable. At last she convinsed her best friend April that she is Jessica. April fals in love with the ""boy"" jessica. This is a excellent act of Rob Schneider. I personally think that Rob Schneider is one of the gratest acters today.
And back to our story jessica look's for a way to get back to her-self. Mean-while jessica missed her boyfriend .She tried talling him the truth but he didn't believe jessica that she is a boy.
At the end jessica found out that the earrings were the cause of all that happened. She went to conflict wuth the man that has her body.
All the story is in a defined time , because she needed to get the earrings back together befor the full moon stricks or else she would stay in that boby forever.
The story is lened with funny scenes.",1086652800,,1655,4.3076923076923075

1 star = abysmal; some movies deserve to be forgotten
2 star = poor; a total waste of time
3 star = good; worth the effort
4 star = very good; what a movie should be
5 star = fantastic; must own it and share it with others

STORY: Through coincidence a high-school beauty and an idiot criminal switch bodies when they happen upon magical ancient Egyptian earings. Now starts the ""comedy"" of how they and their friends cope to the sudden change.

MY FEEDBACK:
1) Much of the humor was in the same vain as the Scary Movie trilogy = silly to the point that you still find yourself chuckling at how stupid it all is
2) Not a movie I'd recommend for kids as some people will find it offensive that the movie touches on (and seems to encourage) homosexuality, cross-dressing and marital unfaithfulness.
3) The cast did their job and must have had fun at such a ridiculous comic romp.
4) The story was predictable and no new ground explored here nor old ground handled in a fresh way
5) Adam Sandler's bit part (he produced the movie it appears) were as dumb as they get. Don't know why he even bothered appearing in the movie other than to help boost viewership.

OVERALL: It got enough chuckles out of me that I didn't find it a total waste of time but it was close. I'd rather go back and watch Liar Liar or Happy Gilmore for some true original laughs.",1086566400,,1363,4.337254901960784
1849117,3,B00008K7AM,"This is another in the series of Rob Schneider movies in which he is placed in inappropriate or impossible situations, and reacts. Consider this to be the Devil's Spawn of the 'Freaky Friday' genre. Petty thief Rob changes places with 'Jessica', the prettiest girl in school via some magical earrings, and hilarity ensues. Well, that's the theory, anyhow. Truth be told, there are some amusing and a couple of quite funny moments in the film, but overall it's pretty formulaic.
I have two favorite subplots.  My favorite involves Rob (well his body with Jessica inside) becoming a gardener for Jessica's father. In this ruse, he is transformed into 'Taquito', and sports a very bad Mexican accent. They go through some ritual male bonding exercises (talking about women, playing basketball, etc.) and eventually Rob is able to save his marriage by resisting having an affair with Jessica's mother, in which Rob has the best line in the entire film when he says, while brushing off her clumsy pass: ""This is so wrong in at least five different ways."" I don't know why, but that really did amuse me. In the end, Rob says the right things to both parents and their love life is reborn!
My other favorite subplot is a bit more base, but basically involves Jessica learn to use a male body. This comes to a peak when she (in Rob's body, of course) tries to learn to use a urinal with the help of an elderly bathroom assistant. It's a very visual piece of shtick, but it was funny, in a base, teenage sort of way.
In the end they get the two lead characters back together and the movie's only bout of special effects gives us the Jessica to Rob pole dancing transmogrification.
This movie is very much a cookie cutter formula comedy, but it actually has a few moments of amusement to be seen. On balance, it's an OK way to pass the time if you don't want any heavy thinking involved, and it's WAY better than 'Corky Romano'!",1074643200,5,1918,4.591836734693878

Schneider gas station attendant character trades bodies with a sorority queen after he tries on her magic earring.  Schneider then mugs around for the next hour and a half learning to deal with the surprises of having a guys body while trying to get his former body back all with predictably hilarious results.  Except that the results are instead predictable, dull and poorly thought out.  Is a urinal really that hard to get used to that it takes a week to master?  Wouldn't s/he have been beaten up for breaking the guy code and starting a conversation in the bathroom, never mind admiring someone else's mastery of the urinary process?  And if you fight like a girl in a fight you're not going to win - you're going to get taunted and then smacked down.  I don't care if you're a girl trapped in a guys body or not - you can't kick another guy in the happy sacks.

No one expects THE HOT CHICK to be Shakespeare but if you approach it with the right frame of mind you will enjoy the laughs and the occasional uneasy situations (O'Keefe is a joy too).

Jessica and April are populare Cheerleaders and think that they control the world and Jessica steals a pair of ear rings that switch bodies for the 2 people that wear them. And she switiches bodies with Rob, who is a thief. And she ( he ) wakes up the next morning with an umm man hood. And tries to escape and tells April what happened and April wants to see her umm hood, throughout the whole movie as they try to find who might have done this to Jessica and they suspect a science nerd and a witch-wannabe and they end up in a club tearing shirts off cheerleaders and Rob tries to pee wit his hood and watches other men do it and say they do it well...some what of a disturbing movie, with cracks on gayness ( april develops feelings for Jessica in her male form ) and it ends up they find Jessicas body in a Strip club and so the story goes...

1849131,3,B00008K7AM,"You may remember the brief cycle of Hollywood ""body switch"" themed movies that came out around 1987-88. The only three of those I can remember are VICE VERSA (Judge Rheinhold switches bodies with Fred Savage) LIKE FATHER LIKE SON (Dudley Moore switches with Kirk Cameron) & SWITCH (Jimmy Smits swaps with Ellen Barkin). So for about 14 or so years the concept has been pretty much dead and buried. But Hollywood is always looking to update and rehash old themes, & Rob Schneider's latest comedic vehicle THE HOT CHICK is the result.
Jessica (Rachel McAdams) is the hot chick of the title. A snotty, uppity teen who uses her good looks to take advantage of others less fortunate than her.
One day while out shopping at the mall with some friends she comes across a pair of Ancient Abyssynian earrings in an antique store run by a Rastafarian pothead (Adam Sandler who also exec-produced). After shoplifting them Jessica co-incidentally has a run in with a bumbling mugger (Rob Schneider), which leaves the duo with an earring each.
For some reason that night before going to bed they both sleep with an earring on.... & wake up the following morning to discover they've switched bodies much to Jessica's horror & the low-life's delight.
So once Jessica (now played by Rob Schneider) manages to convince her best friend April (Anna Farris from SCARY MOVIE) that she's now a guy she must lay low until they can find a way to retrieve the other earring & change her back.
This, despite a more romantic tone than Rob Schneider's other work, of course leads to lots of the expected scatalogical humor, some of which is pretty funny; especially ""Jessica""s first attempt at using a urinal, plus experiencing locker-room talk first hand as well as her father showing a macho side he's never displayed before when she poses as his Spanish gardener & they bond over a beer... and is very nearly seduced by her own mother!
Sadly, not much time is devoted to McAdam's time as a guy as she is just as funny as Schneider, if not more so, in her slobbish role.
THE HOT CHICK is not a classic by a long stretch; but it's a fun & amusing time filler that will be enjoyed by anyone who liked Schneider's other lowbrow comedies, though prudes & the hopelessly senile are advised to steer clear of this one.",1060473600,2,2286,4.646913580246913

Anyway, I was very surprised by seriousness of the beginning movie setup which was markedly different than the rest.
Lets face it people... fart jokes, body oder and bodily functions and yes even homosexuality still work as comedic fodder.  This isn't your typical Chevy Chase pratfall or Three Stooges romp.  It addresses real issues that kids have faced in high school and spins it like a top to exaggerate the complete nonsense of how cruel the popular people are to those with lesser looks or little money.  The movie did not drag (in my humble opionion) as other reviewers had said. Instead it moved from one carefully, sometimes predictable, but always hysterical scene to the next.

Okay, sometimes I love a dumb comedy and this movie fits the bill. Rob is excellent as the confused, and snotty Jessica. Rachel did a good job playing the ""Hot Chick Bandit.""  The young man who played Billy was perfect. The cameos of Adam Sandler as the pot-loving Rastafarian was just too funny.

The problem I have with this movie is not with its improbability.  In the aftermath of ""There's Something About Mary"" it seems that every comedy has forgone the genuine laugh for the hearty gross out and while, I must admit, I found myself doing the cringe/chuckle during many of this movie's totally ridiculous vignettes I can't say that the cumulative result of those two hours spent in the dark was worthwhile.  Yes, Schneider is at his usual, self-depricating best.  Yes, there are some moments that will make you laugh.  But the plot, such as it is, does not hold together in anything but the most superficial way, leaving the viewer completely unfulfilled by the final fade out.
TRANSFER WISE: A nice looking DVD with sharply contrasted, clear images.  Black levels and colors are well balanced.  Minor edge enhancement and a hint of pixelization are present but they are extremely rare, for a very smooth looking visual presentation.  The audio is 5.1 and nicely spread over the surrounds, especially in the music tracks.
EXTRAS: A making-of featurette, music video, audio commentary and deleted scenes.  Nicely put together.

Rob Schneider plays a traditional fish out of water role, having had the personality/soul/whatever of a beautiful young prissy coed transferred into his body (normally a 30 something semi-conscious, small-time thief).  The ensuing predicaments that he finds himself in, although already played out in at least 10 other movies I can think of, do prove to a humorous flavor to them that only Schneider can provide.  Although heavy on toilet and vaguely homoerotic humor, the movie manages to provide adequate chuckles throughout its 104-minute length.  Supported by a reasonably talented cast including Anna Faris, the Mowry Twins, Adam Sandler in a very one dimensional cameo, Michael O'Keefe (remember him from Caddy Shack?) as the coed's overly hormonal father, and a virtually unrecognizable Michelle Branch, Schneider manages to keep this movie slightly above the level of your typical teenage romp film.
The DVD is a moderately good package, including the movie, featurettes on each of the main characters and stunt production, a dozen or so deleted scenes, an alternate ending, and a very well done music video.  The big question is ""Is it worth spending [$$$] to own?""  Well, if you are a big Rob Schneider fan...sure.

But instead of thoughtfully being disappointed by Rob Schneider's performance, I found him to be rather funny and endearing even. Yes, endearing.
 Schneider (A criminal) and ""perfect"" high school girl Jessica mistakenly switch bodies after putting on a pair of ancient earrings that has the mystical ability to switch bodies. All in all, they take this plot and make a minimum spoof on high school. But there's much more to see in The Hot Chick. Actual lessons on friendship, family, and love are here too. I guess that's where ""endearing"" is coming from.
 Rob Schneider and Anna Farris' chemistry in the film really pulled this along also. The club scene was a riot. Watch for that one. The supporting cast all had different little quirks and made for some great laughs along the way. There's a cameo from Adam Sandler to boot, too.

And Brady wrote and directed films at Harvard? Schneider co-wrote and Sandler co-produced. Running Time: 101 minutes and rated PG-13 for crude and sexual humor, language, and drug references.",1056931200,,835,5.192592592592592

Once I saw it, my mouth stays shut, but not during the movie.  I was laughing the WHOLE time!  It was very amusing.  It was worth watching it.

1849159,5,B00008K7AM,"The Hot Chick is a wonderful guilty pleasure. True, the plot is totally cliche and predictable, but I haven't laughed so hard at anything in a LONG time. Rob Schneider's previous crass vehicles (""Deuce Bigelow"" and ""The Animal"") gave no hint that the ""Saturday Night Live"" vet was capable of a bravura - at times astonishingly convincing - performance as a gorgeous 16-year-old female cheerleader who wakes up one morning in the body of a balding, homely 30-year-old man.
As the result of a pair of magic earrings, Jessica (Rachel McAdams) unwittingly trades bodies with Clive (Schneider), a small-time crook. We don't catch much more than a couple of glimpses of Clive in Jessica's body until a raucous climax, but for Jessica, her new male body is a life-altering experience. For one thing, Jessica must learn to negotiate the mechanics of urinating while standing up with the help of a confused men's room attendant (a hilarious Dick Gregory). And to explain her suddenly male presence at home, Jessica pretends to be a Mexican gardener named Taquito, who has to endure her dad (Michael O'Keefe) describing his sex life - and, worse, fend off a pass from her mom (Melora Hardin). Body-switch comedies usually wimp out in sexual situations, but this one takes full advantage.
Faris, who survived ""Scary Movie 2,"" emerges as a promising young actress, and the same could be said of Rachel McAdams in her first sizable role. As for Schneider, he may be obnoxious, but he is, more important, talented and fearless, the driving force of the film.

This is mindless fun at its best.",1055808000,,1579,4.891791044776119
1849160,4,B00008K7AM,"This movie is stupid but I did laugh a lot. Rob Schneider plays a girl very well. Just pure, stupid fun. Were you expecting anything less from Schneider?",1055635200,,153,4.5

Anyhoo, I made sure to get comfy before the movie because I was prepared to sleep through it. I'm not a big fan of slapstick humor and Rob Schneider is the king of stupid movies. But I was surprised to see this movie is actually very funny! I found myself laughing out loud through most of the movie. I was also pleasantly surprised to see all of the extras on the DVD including an alternate ending. Check this movie out",1055462400,,547,4.121495327102804
1849162,2,B00008K7AM,"As I sit here about to write a review for this latest adventure that pits Rob Schneider into some kind of comedic lunacy, I have to wonder what kind of cartoonish situation Hollywood will put him in next. He's already been a gigolo, an animal, and now he's a teenage girl. What's next?. Rob Schneider as Martha Stewart?!. I think I would actually watch that. This film, like every other Schneider movie, is a film to watch and best be enjoyed if you turn your brain completely off. Like ""Deuce Bigalow"" and ""The Animal"" before it, the movie's premise is somewhat funny when you think of Schneider doing it. It always starts off rather fun and laughable, and kind of entertaining. But, as usual, the movie wears out it's premise too thin by the middle or so, and it reaches the conclusion wheezing and gagging. Barely making it to the end with the comedic touch it had in the beginning. This is the way it is with all his movies, and this one is definitley no exception. The movie has a popular, pretty, sexy teenaged girl named Jessica(Rachel McAdams), who is the queen of the school. You know the type. She has her clique of other popular, pretty girls along with her. After Jessica gets some ancient, magical earrings at a store at the mall, she changes bodies with a low life crook named Clive(Schneider), after a run in with him at a gas station. She has one earring, and he got the other. They both wake up the next morning in each other's bodies. This does set up some funny situations, but it also stirs up some predictable ones you can see a mile away. Jessica, in Clive's body, gets the help of her closest friend(played by Anna Faris, who appeared in both ""Scary Movie"" pics), in hopes of finding out what happened and get back into her own body. Along the way, Faris begins to fall for Schneider, even though it's really her friend Jessica. Like we didn't see that coming. Being trapped in the man's body opens Jessica up to the things around her. Her friends, her boyfriend(Matthew Lawrence), love, and the troubled relationship of her parents. By the way, her mom is hot!. It's the usual lesson we have seen a million times when a rude, selfish person sees what they were so oblivious too. As I had said before, the movie's premise is quite fun at the start, but it soon becomes rather repetitive the longer it goes on. The things that made you laugh earlier are now gone, and in it's place are limp jokes and sight gags that seem rather desperate to make you laugh, or to even smile. When it finally ends, it ends sufferably, and you just want to put it out of it's misery. The cast, tho, all seem game and seem to be having a fun time making the movie. Wouldn't you?. Schneider has always come across as a likeable guy, and can be rather funny when given the right material. Sadly, he hasn't been given the right material vey much. Anna Faris is a real sweetheart. I can't exactly put my finger on it, but she has a real sweet charm and quality to her. She is adorable with an extremely lovely and loveable presence. She was the only one that gave the 'Scary Movie' films some kind of solid credibility. Plus, she looks great as a blonde. Michael 'O' Keefe(""Caddyshack"" and ""Roseanne""), plays Jessica's father, and Adam Sandler, one of the film's producers, pops up in a rather unfunny and annoying cameo. This movie is innocent fun. There is nothing here that says that this is a movie that is anything but stupid fun. Stupid?. Yes. Fun?. At times. These movies are harmless, and they will always have a place in the theaters. I, and most others, still have that part of ourselves that will see these movies and still have a couple of chuckles come out. I hope we never lose those parts of ourself. It would be quite boring. However, it would be so much better if the movies themselves, like this one, put a little more effort into it.",1055462400,2,3851,4.463829787234043

The chick in the movie who he changes bodies with, is very hotttt. Thats worth seeing the movie alone.

1849167,4,B00008K7AM,"I'm from the UK so have just seen this film at the cinema. I really liked the look of the film from the trailers, though i did read a really bad review of it on teletext.co.uk. I still went to see the film and I'm really glad I did! It's not a major complicated film and sometimes you don't need it to be! I just fancied having a few laughs and that's exactly what I got. I really like the fact that adam sandler is always is his films and vice versa! Yes, there were cheesy lines and american stereotypes, but hey, that's all part of the fun of it. Critics who review these films think they obviously are always right and don't even consider the target audience. I'm 21 and I don't consider myself to be a 'moron' who has no intellectual capacity thank you very much!

I was apalled with how many urinal jokes there were and how Taquito wore those small clothes. Dreadlock boy should've banged his head with the drumsticks. Oh yeah, that little brother was the unfunniest thing that I've seen in a long time. ""Battlefield Earth"" had more laughs. This movie is unapproved by me.",1054166400,3,577,4.958762886597938

1849171,4,B00008K7AM,"...otherwise, you might want to catch some other flick.
The hot chick is an unpretentious little comedy about body switching, starring SNL alum Rob Schneider. The basic story is that a bitchy, head cheerleader type has her body changed with that of a 30'ish down on his luck burglar and all around loser (Schneider)...after that, hilarity (mostly) ensues.
It's your typical fish out of water comedy (or should I say fish in someone else's body comedy). We see Schneider as he tries to find a way to revert things, while hiding from her boyfriend, friends, family and school authorities, with the help of a few of her girlfriends (including Anna Faris in a hilarious role as a not so bright cheerleader).
While it'll never be in any AFI comedy lists, you get to spend some good times with this film. Just plain comedy,  la Rob Schneider.",1053907200,3,836,4.726027397260274
1849172,4,B00008K7AM,"Let's face it. 'The Hot Chick' will not be nominated for an Academy Award (or any other award, for that matter), but that does not mean it is a bad movie. Actually, it's the exact opposite. It's actually quite funny and sweet. I rented it the other day mostly because there was nothing much else to rent. I rented it hesitantly, because I figured it would be one of those stupid, silly, slapstick un-funny comedies that we are presented with way too often. I guess you could sort of stick this film in that category, but I hope you don't.
Rachel McAdams plays Jessica - a teenaged girl who, via a pair of special antique earrings, wakes up one morning as a man. Actually, she has switched bodies with a robber she met briefly the day before, played by Rob Schneider. Schneider then had the difficult role of playing a teenaged girl stuck inside a man's body, who tries to act like a real man so that no one will find out the truth. He (she) reveals this to her best friend April (played by Anna Farris of all of those 'Scary Movie' films), who not only accepts her new hairy best friend, but actually starts to enjoy hanging out with him (her).
Yes, it's silly. No, there's really no originality to be found here. But it made me laugh on more than one occasion. There's a great cameo by a dred-locked Adam Sandler, and Schneider does a decent job portraying a teenaged girl. And there is also a great storyline revolving around the two best friends Jessica and April that is really very sweet. But, if you're looking for a mature comedy, this is not your film. If you just want to watch a fun movie and find yourself chuckling, I honestly think you'll enjoy 'The Hot Chick'.",1053561600,,1674,4.4207119741100325

1849176,4,B00008K7AM,"After critics totally bludgeoned this movie, I decided to wait for rental.  I'm not sure I made the right decision because this was actually funny and taught some good life lessons along the way.
Rob Schneider is able to pull off a gender-swapping mishap when the high school's snotty princess five-fingers a pair of ancient earrings with transmuting powers.  As fate would have it, they each put on one of the earrings, wake up the next day and the fun begins!!
The writing is surprisingly good with some hilarious scenes, especially in the bar.  Matthew Lawrence adds some nice eye candy as the love-lorned boyfriend to the princess now in a man's body.  As the story concludes, the princess makes right with many people she's wronged, helps her parents heal their marital wounds and discovers what true friendship really is in her best friend April.
All in all, this movie didn't deserve the beating the critics gave it...but after all, it's a modern day comedy and these types of movies seldom fair well with a bunch of pent-up, old foggies.  'Nuff said!",1053043200,,1058,4.791208791208791
