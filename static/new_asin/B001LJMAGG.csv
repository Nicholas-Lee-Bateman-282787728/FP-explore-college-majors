8318274,5,B001LJMAGG,"Great cheap 5 event set that has a lot of fights from fights before they were big. I like watching these fights, because you get to see how they evolved as a fighter.",1368662400,,166,4.0606060606060606
8318275,2,B001LJMAGG,"I was pretty disappointed in this DVD set. I previously purchased the ""Rumble on the Rock - The Superstar Collection"" DVDs and I guess I expected the fights on this one to be of similar quality. Not even close. Night and Day difference.

OK, I only paid ~$7 + shipping for the series, but that was in line with what I paid for the ROTR set, so that's no real excuse.",1284249600,2,366,4.154929577464789
8318276,5,B001LJMAGG,"This Icon Sport 5 Event box set is a great buy.  There are many entertaining fights that feature UFC, Affliction, IFL, and Elite XC veterans such as Matt Hughes, Tim Sylvia, Rich Franklin, Robbie Lawler, Jason ""Mayhem"" Miller, KJ Noons, Ben Rothwell, and many more.

The 5 events consist of Superbrawl events.  (Superbrawl later changed its name to Icon Sport)

There is a mistake on the package.  It does not contain Superbrawl 19 like it says on the package.  Instead when you access it on the dvd it plays an event known as Superbrawl Icon.  This is last event before they officially changed their name to Icon Sport.  Although this is a mistake in labeling, Superbrawl Icon is an exponentially better event than Superbrawl 19.

The picture quality isn't the best on some events, but if you are buying MMA events that are over 7 years old and from promotions who wouldn't have a ton of money you can understand why the picture isn't perfect.

Overall a good assortment of fights from fighters who would go on to become big stars.",1240185600,10,1032,4.651933701657459
