352505,4,6301750667,"I recently purchased this video thinking all the songs were from Disney's 'The Little Mermaid' but they only have two from 'The Little Mermaid' which includes 'Besala' {Kiss the Girl} and 'Bajo el Mar'{Under th Sea} so don't be fooled by the cover. The ten Disney songs featured in this video are: 'The Little Mermaid', 'Peter Pan', '20,000 Leagues Under the Sea', 'The Rescuers', and more. This video is fun and educational for kids or any one who is studying spanish. I now know some of the songs by heart in spanish with the help of this video. Now me and my Mexican friend can sing together. This will keep kids occupied for days while teaching them! Also you can check out other 'Canta Con Nosotros' videos featuring other popular Disney films.",987897600,8,749,4.681818181818182
352506,4,6301750667,"I saw this video every single day in my Spanish class. We were a 6th period class, and nearly every day, halfway through the period, my teacher would stop teaching and turn on this video. I got to know the ""By the  Sea""/""En El Mar"" song quite well. We're also currently  watching the ""Kiss the Girl""/""Embrasse-La"" song on the  video in my French class, but thankfully my teacher has the decency to show  the video in moderation. Anyway, now that you know more about my class  schedule than you ever wanted to know, I'd just like to say that this is a  pretty good video. I just bought it in English this past Saturday night,  because it was kind of getting old to the see same videos in Spanish and  French but never in English (like what happened last year with Beauty and  the Beast). ANYWAY, I would recommend buying this singalong tape, more than  the other ones, especially the ones that are live from Disneyland or Disney  World. The live ones have people dressed as characters that aren't the  slightest bit believable. This video has the songs done with clips from the  movies they're from, or just random video clips if they're not from a  movie.",944438400,14,1155,4.516908212560386
352608,5,6301750667,"I got this movie remembering all of my 2-3 year old memories! When I opened it and watched it, I almost cried :) It's so musical and every song is classic!",1287792000,,155,4.032258064516129
352609,5,6301750667,"I have the entire sing along collection on VHS from when my son was a baby.  He is 16 now & we have a 3 year old who loves the 3 videos we can get on DVD.  We don't  even have a VHS player anymore & of all the sing alongs this was my favorite.  In no way do I think that the ""old fashioned"" songs are incapable of holding a child's interest.  We loved the Codfish Ball, By the Beautiful Sea, A Whale of a Tale & especially Never Smile at a Crocodile.  This song in particular I wanted when my daughter started showing an interest in crocodiles.  Since this video is not available in DVD format I bought the movie of Peter Pan.  Only to find that the instrumental version of the song was the only one in the movie.  I sing the song to my daughter but I have missed the rest of the songs enough to look up all the lyrics so I can sing those to her too.  I really wish Disney would release this video on DVD.
I think the upbeat tunes (even if some of the graphics don't look like hi-def videos our kids are used to today) are very entertaining & definitely catchy.",1252454400,,1061,3.985781990521327
352610,5,6301750667,A family member bought this vhs for me when I was little. I think before 1994. I am now 25 years old and the songs still this day will put a smile on my face. It took a while for me to get use to some of the older songs but once I got it I was dancing around the house and pretending I could sing all day to them. Im going to purchase it for my daughter now and hope that it brings as much joy to her as it did to me. It is a  must have. It will keep the kids interested.,1147651200,,471,3.4857142857142858
352611,5,6301750667,"This video is incredibly fun, musically and visually.  I have two girls, two and four years old, and it puts them in stitches every time they watch it.  If I'm otherwise engaged, my littlest girl runs to get me several times during the video, towing me by the finger to see what I'm missing.

It's a sing-along, so all the lyrics are displayed at the bottom.  A good thing, too, because you'll need to actually see the lyrics if you want to learn these fast-paced songs in their entirety.

The tunes are upbeat and the lyrics, although pure and enjoyable to a young child, are in many ways far more complex than the monotonous, simple-minded pop music that is often marketed to teens and young adults.  Adults with broad musical tastes won't need to feign delight.

My girls' three favorites include two of the disparaged 1940s songs/cartoons (supposedly ""too old fashioned to engage the mind of a present-day child."")  My four-year-old daughter told me this morning that she couldn't get the song, ""By the Beautiful Sea"" out of her head, and woke up hearing the song and seeing the images in her mind.  ""At the Codfish Ball"" is the other oldie they love.  Their third favorite is ""Never Smile at A Crocodile"".

I wrote down the words to these three songs, so we could learn them without any gaps and could sing them together anytime.  You'll have to imagine the music (each upbeat, yet very distinctive), but here are the lyrics:

=============================================

""By the Beautiful Sea"" (A charming male/female duet)

By the Sea, by the sea, by the beautiful sea,

  You and me, you and me, Oh! how happy we'll be.

When each wave comes a-rolling in, we won't duck or swim,

  And we'll float and fool around the water.

Over and under and then up for air,

  Pa is rich, Ma is rich, so now what do we care?

I love to be beside your side, beside the sea,

  beside the seaside, by the beautiful sea.

----------------------------------------------------

Joe and Jane were always together,

  Said Joe to Jane, I love summer weather.

So, let's go to that beautiful sea,

  Follow along, say you're with me.

Anything that Joe would suggest to her,

  Jane would always think it was best for her.

So, he'd get his Ford, holler, ""All aboard!""

  Gee, I want to be

  by the sea, by the sea, by the beautiful sea.

(repeat from top, down to dashed line above.)

============================================

""At the Codfish Ball"" (sung in the manner of an old-time 1920s crooner, with far-out, hilarious and detailed visual depictions you can't even imagine!)

Come along and follow me, to the bottom of the sea,

  We'll join in the jamboree, at the codfish ball.

Lobsters dancing in a row, shuffle off to Buffalo,

  Jellyfish sway to and fro, at the codfish ball.

Fin and Haddie lead the eels through an Irish reel.

The catfish is a dancing man, but can't can-can like a sardine can.

Tunas truckin' left and right, minnies moochin' what a night.

  There won't be a hook in sight, at the codfish ball.

(short instrumental)

Each red snapper's lookin' dapper, dressed up to the gills.

The octopuses all have fun as they wait to see all the grunion run.

So, come along and follow me, to the bottom of the sea.

  We'll join in the jamboree, at the codfish ball.

-----------------------------------------------------

At the bottom of the sea, everyone is family.

  Come and join the jamboree, called the codfish ball.

All the swordfish love to play, every clam is here today,

  to shell-e-brate this holiday, at the codfish ball.

Shark and salmon play backgammon, til the break of day.

And each seahorse is here of course,

  this is the place where the plaice play!

Yellowfin swim in and out, dancing with each bass and trout.

  Water beetles twist and shout, at the codfish ball.

So, come along and follow me, to the bottom of the sea.

  We'll join in the jamboree, at the codfish ball.

===============================================

""Never smile at a Crocodile"" (with scenes from ""Peter Pan"")

Never smile at a crocodile.

  No you can't get friendly with a crocodile.

Don't be taken in by his welcome grin.

  He's imagining how well you'd fit within his skin.

Never smile at a crocodile.

  Never tip your hat and stop to talk awhile.

------------------------------------------------------

Never run, walk away, say ""Good night"", not ""Good day.""

  Clear the aisle and never smile at Mr. Crocodile.

You may very well be well bred.

  Lots of etiquette in your head.

But, there's always some special case,

  I will place to forget etiquette.

(repeat entire song til this point)

For instance!

(repeat from top til dashed line above)

Don't be rude, never mock, throw a kiss not a rock.

  Clear the aisle and never smile at Mr. CROCK--O--DILE!

This is a highly stimulating video.  It can entertain by itself, but its real strength is as a thrilling parent-child activity.",1137283200,16,4921,4.799031476997579
352612,5,6301750667,"Now when I review Disney's Sing Along Songs, I have a favorite (5 stars) that sets the bar for the rest. This Sing Along Songs video is not my favorite, but it's pretty close.

It's just so much fun. Hosted by Ludwig Von Drake, the title song ""Under The Sea"" from The Little Mermaid sets the upbeat tempo for the whole video- it's full of so much energy.

Enjoy dancing, tapping, and singing along. Looking for the funnest Disney Sing Along Songs video?- this is it!",1123718400,5,466,4.406976744186046
352613,4,6301750667,"My daughter loves it which is most important. I didn't like the fact that songs from other movies other than ""The Little Mermaid"" was inserted. It should only have songs from the original movie. At least I thought the front cover implies that.",1082851200,,243,4.674418604651163
352614,2,6301750667,"This is not the best of the Disney Sing-Alongs.  ""Under The Sea"" is on it twice and it's further padded with song clips from the 40's like ""By The Beautiful Sea"" and ""The Sailor's Hornpipe"" which are faded and too old fashioned to engage the imagination of a present-day child (although they're kind of interesting to adults).",1054252800,5,326,4.719298245614035
