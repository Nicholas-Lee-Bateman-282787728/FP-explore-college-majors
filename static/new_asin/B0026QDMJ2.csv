8353475,5,B0026QDMJ2,"Touching, sad character study of a father forever protective and loving of his ever more deranged daughter, who murders a boy she is obsessed with in high school. The film covers the years that follow as the father refuses to ever give up on his daughter, no matter what she has done, and what his loyalty costs him.

This could have been sappy and it is occasionally melodramatic, but the acting is all beautifully understated and real, and the background of the rise of fascism and the ravages of WWII in Italy gives a larger context to the questions of guilt, innocence, forgiveness and loyalty.  I found  it only grew on a second viewing, probably because this is a film of beautifully observed details and behavior, not plot.

A quiet film, but a strikingly memorable one.",1442880000,,777,4.6911764705882355
