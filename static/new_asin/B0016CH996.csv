8262139,5,B0016CH996,"The best version of Star Wars Episode IV on the market untouched. This movie was released many times before this version came out, but never had been ""remastered"" for picture and sound before. IV-VI were released in the mid 1990s on the Laserdisc format. A format that was touted at the time to be far superior to VHS, which it was.  For all SW fans out there that want the SW original trilogy ""untouched"" or ""fixed up"", I have to say this is the way to go and is the best available at the moment. Blurays of this version are not available and the only dvd of it is included in the 2006 ""Limited Edition"" sets. However, the dvd versions of the originals are NOT cleaned up and remastered for picture and sound as this THX Laserdisc is.",1384387200,2,735,4.326086956521739
8262140,5,B0016CH996,"For all Star Wars fans, this is a the last medium where you can watch the original version of the movie before George Lucas decided to add in all the CGI rubbish and where Han Solo shot Greedo first! This version is no longer available on DVD or Blu-Ray!",1364601600,,254,4.204081632653061
