8128129,5,B000G0O5LE,"This bonus pack is a great deal to get your kids in the moods for Halloween.  My ""kids"" happen to be a couple of parrots who love to watch movies.  I knew this one was going to be a hit with them when Elmo said, ""Helloooo!"" and one of the birds replied, ""Hello!""  They both seem to like Elmo and all the Sesame Street characters with their cute voices and the colorful graphics.  All the fall colors really come out in these two DVD's.  I'll have to admit that Elmo's voice can get a little irritating after a while, but it's much better than a loud shriek from a Macaw.

The two movies included in this bonus pack are A Magical Halloween Adventure and Elmo Says Boo!  Both are charming and the stories and songs are very upbeat.  I think that most kids who like Sesame Street would enjoy these.  The DVD teaches about Halloween and costumes and scary things and monsters that aren't really so scary.  There are some songs by the Count which are always cute.  Elmo is so funny when he tries to scare guest, Julia Roberts.  I think that even adults could enjoy watching these.  And it's a great deal, since each movie alone would normally cost almost as much as these two do together.  Two thumbs up!",1256342400,,1199,4.342342342342342

8128131,5,B000G0O5LE,"I grew up watching Sesame Street and now my daughter is doing the same.  She absolutely adores anything Sesame Street and if it's on TV, she stops what she's doing and runs to watch.  She loves the Halloween DVD and watches it even though Halloween has passed.  I'd recommend it to anyone that wants entertaining television that also teaches numbers and ABC's.",1196726400,,360,4.774193548387097
8128132,5,B000G0O5LE,"This is the first movie my 17 month old son insists that I play over and over. I also really like this special, I just wish they were longer. For those with small children, this is a great halloween treat. Good songs, good story. I highly recommend it!",1193443200,,252,4.270833333333333
8128133,4,B000G0O5LE,"I simply gave this 4 stars because of my 3-year olds' reaction.  She seemed a little scared, which surprised me because we've owned Sesame Street videos before and they are perfect.  You can expect this, though, since they are Halloween videos.
Just a suggestion, if you gently, simply explain to your little one that things are pretend, honestly I think they'll be ok.  For example, my daughter was very scared at first of the skeleton in 'Elmo Says Boo'.  I could see that in her face, so I simply said it was just silly and we all have bones, so tell the skeleton to ""Get some skin!""  That's just what she says now and she's not scared anymore.
Another caution, on the second video, they do talk about monsters being in the closet, which obviously may create a problem for your little one's imagination.  I simply explained that the monsters were funny monsters just like Elmo and they were playing peek-a-boo.  That seemed to resolve the issue.
Overall, I recommend these videos and you can't beat it for the deal.  Great to watch all fall through the Halloween season.  Enjoy if you decide to purchase this set!",1190764800,,1116,4.624365482233503
8128134,5,B000G0O5LE,"I bought this pack for my two year old son. He loved it! He still asks to watch it long after Halloween. The pack included ""Elmo Says Boo"" & ""A Magical Halloween Adventure"". My son is going through a ""scared of everything"" phase, so I was a bit worried, but there wasn't anything on either disc that upset him. He enjoyed every minute. He laughed through both shows. Keeping a two year old interested is a pretty tough trick but these shows sure worked on my little guy. I highly recommend it!",1170201600,3,493,4.369565217391305
8128135,5,B000G0O5LE,"I bought this for my 20 month old son bc he loves Elmo (or Ehmo as he says) and these are great!  They are so good, I kept them out for 2+ extra months after Halloween bc he loved them so much and only just yesterday packed them up with Halloween goodies so he would be excited next year.

You won't be disappointed:-)",1167782400,,318,4.031746031746032
8128136,5,B000G0O5LE,"We have both of these, although we purchased them seperately. Save yourself the time and money and just get them together. The Magical Halloween Adventure has characters picking out costumes to wear and then it goes into hayrides, pumpkin patches, carving pumpkins and making cider. There is a cute songs about monsters not being scary. The Elmo Says Boo! one has cute songs with different poeple and charcters and of course has Elmo all over it. We have had these since my daughter was 2 and she has never expressed fear about them or anything like that. In my opinion, they are not scary. Also, we watch them year round...especially the Elmo one. She will pull it out and ask for it...who knew you could have Halloween in July???",1162080000,,731,4.674418604651163
