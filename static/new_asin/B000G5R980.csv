8128961,5,B000G5R980,"This film takes you into an acid induced, insanity-laced nightmare and refuses to let go. Surrealist Horror is a genre which deserves the utmost attention and Andrey Iskanov is a master at portraying such a story through this medium. If you want visuals, a disturbing plot, strange noises, and things that go bump in the inner echoes of a psychotic mind, this movie is for you. From the hypnotic fractals to the nails being driven into the skull of the protagonist (if he can be called that) ""Nails"" is a wonderment of modern film making and should be held high in regard with cult Horror movies. If you are unfamiliar with Andrey Iskanov, watch this movie and your perception of film will never be the same.",1337212800,,708,4.626984126984127
8128962,4,B000G5R980,"Oh no. The words to cross my mind when I started watching. I was tempted to turn it off after 5 minutes due to the handheld film quality and awkward  opening sequence. I wanted to stick with this one however because I knew it was basically a homemade film created with no budget. This is pure Guerrilla film making here folks. Andrey Iskanov had a vision and I would say he executed it quite well. Needless to say the movie did get better and managed to immerse me into its surreal atmosphere. Thats what this film does best. I enjoyed the whole atmosphere of the movie due to the unconventional lighting effects,musicand the plain sometimes dirty interior. The characters descent into madness did seem strange in the calmness of it all. Never did I feel shocked or horrified by what he was doing. Whether or not thats what Iskanov was trying to achieve I am not sure. The only real nagging turn off was the few cheesy CGI scenes which could have been left out. It did break the atmosphere at times. Over all it was good to me and a great example of what can be done with no budget and a vision.",1283299200,,1095,4.367647058823529
8128963,4,B000G5R980,"Puncturing a whole in the soul of brainless cinematic reality, NAILS is a psychedelic surreal descent beyond the recognized realm of sanity.  Director Andrey Iskanov (PHILOSOPHY OF A KNIFE) always violates the acceptable standards or formulas behind the camera.  Graphic, nightmarish, and just plain weird, his debut film is not for the weak of heart or the feeble of mind.

It starts off in a dull black and white--a colorless edge of hell.  A government assassin becomes disillusioned with his role as a cold-blooded killer.  With his past haunting him, he fumbles upon a book that offers an extreme solution--""trepanation"".  It is a barbaric procedure of hammering holes in the human skull.  Nails pierced into specific locations in the brain, which ideally relieves certain tensions and mental pressures.  This experiment opens up a hole new world.

Vivid colors soon seep into the screen, along with the most eerie soundtrack your ears will ever be subjected to.  We witness the incomprehensible bloody pain coupled with screeching industrial racket.  Just a headache within a headache.  Our hitman delves further and further into a demonic state of questionable existence.  Torture, follows reward, follows torture...the painful cycle pushes him past the brink of quantifiable consciousness.

NAILS drags you along on a bizarre trip of paranoid psychosis, a mental unraveling with no hope of relief.  There are some graphic images your brain won't want to comprehend.  This is arthouse horror at its most sick and uncontrollably twisted.  Can you survive 60 minutes of hell?",1281830400,2,1580,5.281124497991968
8128964,5,B000G5R980,"I got this movie for Christmas as a gift from my grandma. She understands I love horror as well as anime and manga and I had asked for this film as well as Visions of Suffering for this year's gift. I just watched the movie early Wednesday Morning and was floored, it was if I had dropped LSD and watched my TV come to life.

How to explain this film? Well Let's say Quentin Tarantino and David Lynch met at Cannes and decided to remake Eraserhead with an assassin instead of a guy with big hair. The plot structure is not linear, more of an arc. An assassin, played by the director's resident composer Alexander Schevchenko, is having nightmares about his previous kills and decides to solve his problems by hammering 6 inch nails into his head after reading an article about a man who had over 500 nails in his head and suffered no problems whatsoever.  It works.  .  . too well. Suddenly we are thrust into this day glow colored world where the line between reality and fantasy blurs in gory fashion.

Having seen ""Philosophy of a Knife"", the director's pseudo documentary on Japan's Unit 731, I knew what to expect just not how it was presented. Mr Iskanov is becoming the Russian arm of the Splat Pack, a group of directors  in the US whose films are extremely violent. But unlike Eli Roth or James Wan and Leigh Whanell whose films are more show than tell Iskanov is more of the artistic cousin of the pack filling his film with surreal imagery reminiscent of the Brothers Quay or Luis Bunel's ""Un Chien Andlou""  The gore is there, oh yes it's there in spades, but it is an afterthought,and has no real purpose. The star of the show and the audience's focus is the visuals and story, allowing us to get involved like never before.

It is a shame that Mr. Iskanov's films are not more widely recognized as those of his foreign counterparts like Dario Argento or Takashi Miike. If you haven't seen this movie, pick it up. I guarantee that you will never be the same.",1262217600,8,1970,4.4527777777777775
8128965,5,B000G5R980,"This is a good movie, but please BE CAREFUL WHILE WATCHING IT!!!!!! The movie is lout, and it'll make your head hurt after you watch it. It made my head hurt, but I didn't have a headache. This is a strange movie. The Russians are very good!",1218499200,3,241,4.148936170212766
8128966,4,B000G5R980,"The Production values are a little scant, and the first ten minutes I viewed with some unease.  Gazing over at my Amazon receipt hoping it said: ""used"". BUT! As the film marched on fear was replaced with admiration. This great storyline was not wasted. The director does a terrific job of creating an intense psychological atmosphere. I was impressed at the way my biggest criticism (low budget) ended up giving it a certain charm. The primitive element of the presentation added layers of animated paranoia. This movie does not take itself seriously and there is an element of humor that carries throughout. There are some bonus psychedelic visuals that are artfully presented also. I don't know, Maybe I'm just a sucker for a guy hammering nails into his head. But I would be very interested to see more from this young Russian director.",1216252800,4,839,4.8671328671328675

really bizarre a manikin spitting up blood a man obsessed with
putting nails in his head and a girl who loves wearing water
goggles while hitting her victims with a hammer???  Again
I have not seen but 20 min of this so can't really review it
but wanted my HORROR Bros(you sick devils know who you are)to

JACOB'S LADDER-TIDELAND-MEATBALL MACHINE-VISITOR Q and THE BEGOTTON  this might be up your alley.........WEIRD",1201910400,12,542,4.56701030927835
8128968,5,B000G5R980,"Nails (Andrey Iskanov, 2003)

If you haven't yet heard the name Andrey Iskanov, you should have. Russia is not a country that's been known for its horror films over the years, with its best-known directors all living up to the stereotype of heavy, slow dramas. Iskanov intends to change all that, and Nails, his first feature, does a fantastic job of throwing down the gauntlet.

The story concerns a hit man (Aleksandr Shevchenko) who is subject to strange, unsettling visions. After reading about the process of trepanation, he decides to see if it might help him; rather than go the normal route, though, he decides to pound a six-inch nail into his skull. Rather surprisingly, the technique seems to offer him some relief, and he goes on about his life. As with any temporary measure, though, he builds up a tolerance, and pretty soon he turns to somewhat larger, more destructive implements...

Nails couples the body horror of David Cronenberg with the surrealist sensibility of Jan Svankmajer. While it's probably jumping the gun to say a (relatively) new director is on the same level as those two, I think Iskanov certainly has the potential to have his name mentioned in the same breath once he's got a larger body of work under his belt. (Those who would argue that the cheese factor of Nails would stop this comparison from being valid, let me direct your attention to Rabid and Alice, respectively.) Simply put, the kid's good. Very good. I grant you, Nails is not for everyone, but for those who find that sort of thing amusing, this is a film you absolutely must see at the earliest opportunity. **** ",1181433600,18,1616,4.781362007168458
