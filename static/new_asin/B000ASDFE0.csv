But I don't recall. The only thing I can be sure about was that I didn't have nightmares. As a reviewer for this product I have too be completely honest so i will state that I am an Amazon customer who was diahnossed with autism in the past. But that was is ancient history and I'm beyond that now! So what I was going to say was when I watched this with my dad I didn't have nightmares. Probably it just didn't register or I couldn't process everything. I do remember that I didn't really understand the point of the movie. But now that I'm older and well developed I can say this is a good movie if your fine with mature adult content and there should no reason for this too be bad for kids. Especially if they have autism.",1318896000,,895,4.12
