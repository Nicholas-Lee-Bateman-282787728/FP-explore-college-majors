4957544,4,B006512I7Q,"The amazing Steven Soderbergh directs and elevates another film genre. Specifically, ""B"" movies that focus on espionage, intrigue and high action martial arts fighting. In an unusual mixture of actors, he brings in former MMA superstar and calendar girl Gina Carano as the headliner. She plays an agent for hire who works for one of those Blackwater-type firms that do a lot of the foreign dirty work for Uncle Sam. For some reason, she is believed to be expendable and is used as a pawn in a double-cross to kill a Chinese journalist in Spain.

Unlike, the lithe Zoe Saldana in ""Columbiana"", Ms Carano is tall, firm and fully packed. The daughter of a former Dallas Cowboys quarterback, the beautiful fighter is very believable. She appears to be doing all of her own stunt work and from what I can discern without the aid of wiring and other devices. For example, in a rooftop chase she doesn't just leap up to grab a roof and catapult herself to the top. You can see the effort in her face. She's really doing this stuff! Her MMA skills also come into play with obvious boxing training. And you have to love it when she does a figure-4-leg-lock (sorry, I don't know the official name for the hold) around some guy's neck. She needs to get comfortable with the acting component of her new career, but she is far from terrible.

Soderbergh also manages to bring into the mix an assortment of ""A"" list actors, who must have been begging to have their asses kicked by this girl. Michael Douglas is the government man (CIA?) who hires the mercenaries headed by Ewan McGregor and who is Mallory's (Carano) boss. Bill Paxton is her dad. Michael Fassbender (his scenes with Carano are priceless) is a rogue MI:6 agent. Channing Tatum is a co-worker and part time lover. Antonio Banderas is a middle man playing both sides. The plot isn't overly complicated and even makes sense but no one should confuse this movie as an Oscar contender or even the caliber of the new ""Mission: Impossible"" film, but it is fun, fast and furious and highly recommended.

BLU RAY UPDATE (8-31-12): In this re-look at this terrific Soderbergh coming out party for Gina Carano, I'll focus on the Blu ray version.  The film looks terrific featuring scenes from hotel rooms to the ocean to bustling cities to the Colorado mountains.  Soderbergh presents a color palette unlike other films of the genre.  He's not afraid to use hues of yellow and brown mixed in with the usual basics.  The film has a 1080p transfer with an aspect ratio of 2.40:1.  The audio mix is also excellent with a lossless DTS-HD Master Audio 5.1 mix.  When I first saw this film I overlooked an early scene when Mallory (Carano) and her 3 partners rescue a Chinese journalist in Barcelona.  When a gunfight begins, the gun shots and bullet hits are muted to the extent they are dull thuds.  This allows the retro jazzy soundtrack to play loud and clear.  Very cool as is the whole movie.  The disc only has two extras and they total 21 minutes.  One is called ""Gina Carano in Training"" and the second is ""The Men of Haywire.""  I'd upgrade the film to 4.5 stars.",1330992000,108,3107,4.603260869565218
4957545,5,B006512I7Q,"Imagine yourself being pursued by all manner of for-profit and government assassins. What do you do? Who can you trust? Can you trust anyone? And is it still possible to make this interesting?

  Mallory Kane (played by Gina Carano) is a former Marine employed by a private contractor to deal with clandestine issues of national security for the United States government. When we first see her she is in a diner in a remote area by herself when, moments later, a former coworker by the name of Aaron (played by Channing Tatum) asks her to come with him back to their employer and assaults her when she refuses. Aaron (Tatum) has the upper-hand until a patron in the diner comes to Mallory's aid and this allows Mallory to injure and incapacitate Aaron and escape with said patron, Scott (played by Michael Angarano) in his car. Worried this might be her only chance and looking for any help she can get, Mallory recounts the events that resulted in her being on the run to Scott (Angarano) while he mends her injuries from her encounter with Aaron and she drives. Meanwhile, Mallory's employer and former boyfriend (for lack of a better word) Kenneth (played by Ewan McGregor) is making plans to contain the situation and the inevitable blowback that will result.

  Though I didn't know it going in, Carano's voice was dubbed over in the film. Having heard her voice since seeing the movie, I'm not sure of the motivation. Usually the motive for dubbing is inferior acting, inability to speak the language, or incompatibility between the character and the voice of the actor portraying them. I can only assume that she fell short as an actress but it doesn't show onscreen. The music chosen by and work of director Steven Soderbergh in addition to the fight scenes are all top-notch. Surprisingly so, as Channing Tatum has not made one film up to this point that I've watched without regretting it later. Great movie.",1330819200,9,1918,4.7620481927710845
4957546,4,B006512I7Q,"If you've ever seen the movie, ""Point Blank"" with Lee Marvin (which you probably haven't, poor you), you're familiar with the wronged agent/criminal/whatever seeking recompense from the baddies. Granted, it is a simple formula, but because it is so straightforward, it is difficult to pull off, much less with the style that Steven Soderbergh so gracefully stamps ""Haywire"" with.

Perhaps too generic a title, ""Haywire"" still is a feat that is hard to achieve - an action movie solely devoted to one character seeking revenge on another (or others), and yet being appealing in its atmosphere and storyline. ""Haywire"" is lush in location detail, efficient in its storytelling, and not insulting to its audience.

Big-screen newcomer Gina Carano is actually quite good as the protagonist out to right the wrong done to her. There is never a dull or predictable moment in this hard-driving story, yet the humanity is not lost in the shuffle. The performances are solid throughout with no duds in the mix (not even Channing Tatum!). Who does our feminine, but take-it-to-the-mat heroine need to dispatch with next? That question would normally fall into cliche, but in this film's case, it literally is a you-don't-know who to trust game that she must discern correctly.

What makes this film especially fun is the creative angles and shots cinematographer-for-life Soderbergh takes. There is not a wasted opportunity to make an old estate look beautiful, backed with a distance-shot of a full-speed Gina Carano closing in to jump onto an adversary and into the audience's direct vision.

This is a creative, illuminating, and original film which got sorely overlooked by the ticket-buying public. It is well worth the price of admission: an entertaining and engaging ride through a world which looks new, yet familiar under the steady hand of the director. Well worth a look for the entertainment value, and alone for the beautiful way in which it was shot. This is not your run-of-the-mill shot-em-up: this not only has emotional heft, it's got style, baby.",1330819200,9,2055,5.107142857142857
4957547,1,B006512I7Q,"A very disappointing and boring movie. Especially the first half, the pace is too slow for audience to care. And the flashback narrative makes the story chaotic and draw-out. For all your people out there who want to watch Gina Carano, there are not many fighting scenes in the movie. That did make me wonder why they cast her in the first place. The movie was only in my local theater for one week, so I have to spend $7 on train in addition to the movie ticket. After I finished watching, I understood why it made so little money at boxoffce.

The casts are talented, but that doesn't make the movie much more watchable since they weren't given much to do.

Bottom line is, ordinary people won't enjoy this movie, and neither will most extraordinary people.",1330732800,3,759,4.532846715328467

4957550,4,B006512I7Q,"So this was many months ago: Stunned in the aftermath of a brutal shellacking meted out by Chris Cyborg, MMA fighter Gina Carano entertained one of them standing at the crossroads moments. Which is around when Hollywood came knocking, when Steven Soderbergh decided to call and ask her to star in a movie. And here's HAYWIRE, fruit of their collaboration, a film that isn't high-brow or artsy or a Major Motion Picture. What it is, though, is gritty and action-packed and massively appealing. It just might make a movie star of Gina Carano. She's better looking than the Rock.

From the opening scene in an upstate New York diner, your eyes are fixed on Carano. She sits at her table quietly, but there's a trapped animal watchfulness about her and you're instantly put on guard. And yet when the sitch goes sour, it happens in a shocking heartbeat and you're caught unprepared anyway (unless, of course, you've seen the trailer). Carano plays Mallory Kane, an exceptional employee in a private contracting company that takes on all manner of dirty ops work. The narrative doesn't follow a linear track. It shifts back and forth from the present and the past. As the film opens, Mallory Kane already has a bullseye on her.

Mallory must work thru a labyrinthine puzzle to figure out all them what betrayed her. It all goes back to an eventful rescue mission executed by Mallory and her fellow agents in Barcelona - of which entirety we see in flashback. But all this is a superfluous info dump. It's the film's MacGuffin. Somewhere along the way, someone high up in the cloak & dagger community made the decision to sanction Mallory Kane. This then allows us to marvel at Carano as her resourceful, lethally capable character travels the globe bent on exacting revenge. From Barcelona to Dublin to New Mexico to upstate New York, she leaves a trail of busted up bodies.

Even when Soderbergh is slumming, his stuff registers high on the watchability scale. HAYWIRE is his spin on the action thriller, and it's a well-crafted one. It's not just one fight after another. It takes its time in unfolding its narrative beats (okay, there are some slow spots). But HAYWIRE overall feels like the product of a master filmmaker letting his hair down and having fun but not neglecting his due diligence. It's obvious that Soderbergh set out to make Carano a star. HAYWIRE showcases her pretty brilliantly. Carano isn't half bad at the acting bits, and she is most definitely eye candy. But recognizing that she's a fledgling actress, Soderbergh populates her film with big Hollywood names. We're treated to hard-hitting scenes in which Carano opens a mean can on hunks like Channing Tatum, Michael Fassbender, and a slightly weasely Ewan Macgregor. The cool thing is these actors - along with Michael Douglas and Antonio Banderas - seem to not mind playing second fiddle to a rookie actress. The performances are universally solid, with the biggest surprise being that Gina Carano does hold her own in their company. There's something about her, about her attitude, a sense that she's working hard but still not taking herself seriously. And when she smiles that flirty smile, there's a feel of wheels spinning internally. I believed that her character really was that intelligent and resourceful and undeterred. I already knew she was sexy.

Soderbergh plonks her in diverse settings which showcase her versatility. We see her glamorous side as she partners Michael Fassbender's dashing MI6 operative on a work night in Dublin. We see her down and dirty as she gets to the business of eluding her assassins and dishing out payback. I didn't doubt that Gina Carano would be able to sell her action scenes; she's photogenic that way, too. Her fights are nasty affairs, no holds barred and sometimes not pretty to look at. Carano is explosive and marvelously athletic, and when she hits a body you don't doubt that her blows have a serious impact. And, to make it even more realistic, Carano also absorbs her share of punishment, lots of it. Soderbergh opted to not have a music score framing these no-quarter-given scraps. All you hear are the desperate grunts and harsh breathing and the thuds of striking feet and fists. It makes it even more believable.

I heard someone mention this already, and, in fact, a cop in the film even refers to Carano by that name. But if the role of Wonder Woman is still being cast, why not Gina Carano? She's got the goods. And she probably won't even need that lasso of truth to whup on them villains. In any case, Gina Carano needs to do more films.",1329955200,85,4576,4.802030456852792

4957552,3,B006512I7Q,"I am a big fan of director Steven Soderbergh. He is one of a very small handful of directors who work in a wide range of genres and consistently try out new things; he really pushes his artistic abilities and doesn't seem content to make similar films. But I have noticed a trend in his films. For every great, accomplished, interesting film, there are two or three films leading up to it that fall short, he seems to be using these two or three other films to try out the artistic ideas and devices, perfecting them for his next ""Erin Brockovich"", his next ""Traffic"", his next ""Out of Sight"". Some of these 'starter' films turn out to be good and have a life of their own. Others, are quickly forgotten when the more interesting, higher profile films are released and start to earn praise.

""Haywire"" is one of those 'starter' films. But it has a significant problem that will all but ensure it is ultimately forgotten.

The story goes that Soderbergh saw Mixed Martial Artist Gina Carano and decided that he wanted to make a movie to showcase her talents. Lem Dobbs, a frequent collaborator, wrote a screenplay and they made this film.

The biggest problem is that the film feels like a showcase. It seems like a series of set-ups to show us the MMA stars various moves. It doesn't feel like a movie with a real, significant plot or narrative.

Mallory (Carano) walks into a diner in upstate New York and seems to take solace in the brief moment of respite and the cup of coffee that comes with it. But the moment is short-lived. Aaron (Channing Tatum) arrives and states that he is taking her back. But she doesn't want to go, so they get into a no-holds barred fight and do a lot of damage to each other and the diner. Mallory manages to escape and convinces Scott (Michael Angarano), a local kid, to let her use his car. As they escape, she tells him the story leading up to the confrontation in the diner. Two men (Michael Douglas and Antonio Banderas) hire a Black Ops company run by Kenneth (Ewan McGregor) to retrieve a journalist being held hostage in Barcelona. They insist Mallory be a member of the team, because they want her expertise, her skills. Things don't go as planned and Mallory is determined to take out the people responsible. This leads her to track the men responsible from Barcelona to Dublin to New York to New Mexico.

From the moment the film begins, you get the feeling the filmmakers want to create the female equivalent of a typical Jackie Chan or Jet Li film, the type of film that thrusts the martial arts stars into a decidedly North American world and narrative, to give them the opportunity to show off their stuff and become an international star. The difference here is that Jackie Chan's films are usually presented with a wink and a nudge clueing us into the fact the filmmakers aren't taking the material all that seriously. Li's films are usually more serious and definitely less enjoyable because you have more trouble believing in them. One of the problems with ""Haywire"" is that it takes everything very, very seriously. Because of this, we are looking for and in need of a narrative that helps us believe everything we are watching. And Dobbs creates a cliff notes version of the narrative that we need for this film to work.

Carano has an undeniable intensity about her and may have a career playing female vigilante types, the strong, silent, warrior-type. I don't see her playing emotionally complex roles, because there is simply no hint of that type of ability in this performance. I definitely see her as part of the Keanu Reeves School; the less acting required the better. Allow her to stare pensively at another character or at the horizon, and you can believe she is deep in thought, plotting the next step of her revenge against those responsible for her predicament.

The impressive cast of actors playing the men in Mallory's life are all pretty boring and even wasted. Antonio Banderas plays Rodrigo who may have an ulterior motive in hiring the black ops company Mallory works for. Or he may not. Either way, he simply stands to one side and seems to watch the proceedings as if he is watching a television show he is more interested in. During much of the film, his face is covered in a big, wooly beard. Then, it disappears, thankfully, for his last scene. Michael Douglas plays Coblenz, a CIA operative who may also have ulterior motives. At one point, he makes a blatant play for Mallory to join his forces. In doing so, he reveals more about his character and makes him a little more interesting. Michael Fassbender, the new ""It"" kid, plays an MI-6 operative paired with Mallory in Dublin. Their characters have the big fight in the hotel suite featured prominently in the trailer. This moment also leads to a lengthy and interesting chase sequence through the streets of Dublin. But his character barely registers. There is a scene late in the film between Fassbender and McGregor that is meant to illustrate how the ""It"" Kid plays a role in the story. This is another example of Soderbergh playing with timelines; chronologically this scene happens much earlier than we watch it. Channing Tatum plays Aaron. He and Carano share the most screen time together and there are hints to a relationship. But still, his character doesn't really register all that well. Tatum has six, SIX, really at least six new films, coming out this year. He's really good looking, but I have seen little evidence that he can act. I hope that one of these new films catches on or he will definitely be overexposed and people may begin to wonder what all of the fuss was about. Bill Pullman plays Mallory's dad, an ex-Marine who now enjoys a Tom Clancy-esque life as a writer living in New Mexico. His character seems so inconsequential it is almost mind-numbing. He is included to give Mallory some sort of humanity. But it doesn't work. His character is far too cold and distant, her character is too cold and distant and what happens at his house seems to shock even him. It seems difficult for either of them to show any emotion towards one another, so why should we invest any time in the relationship? What's the point?

Ewan McGregor plays Kenneth, the man in charge of the company Mallory works for. They seem to have a close relationship and it quickly becomes apparent that Kenneth is behind the scenes, pulling the strings, but it is never really clear why he is pulling those strings, trying to manipulate Mallory's life. Is it really because he holds a grudge? Is that it?

Soderbergh has used many interesting and innovative techniques in his films before, playing with narrative and visuals. Color blocked film noir, color coding scenes to keep us grounded in shifting timelines and listening to out of sync conversations are ideas Soderbergh has explored before to greater success. He uses some of these ideas here again, but doesn't really take them anywhere new. When he shows George Clooney and Jennifer Lopez staring at each other over a glass of wine as we hear their earlier conversation, it brings a heightened intensity to their words. This is one of the many things that made ""Out of Sight"" so interesting. In ""Traffic"", he gave each storyline a sort of color identity, allowing us to instantly immerse ourselves back into the sprawling narrative every time we revisit a character. He used both of these techniques in earlier works, as though auditioning them. In ""Haywire"", he seems to be moving backwards. Instead of trying something new in a smaller film, he is recycling ideas used in his bigger, more accomplished films and reusing them in this smaller film to lesser effect.

The Dublin sequence is involving, exciting and a really well choreographed action scene. The fight in the diner is also interesting and seems especially brutal. The problem is that everything in between seems like we have seen them a hundred if not a million times before. And everything in between just seems boring. So, we have two well done, interesting sequences sandwiched among a multitude of boring, lengthy passages. And these boring bits drag the entire film down and make it seem longer than its 90 minutes of running time. A lot longer. And it is never a good thing to leave an action film feeling as though the film was longer than it actually is.

Soderbergh's next film is ""Magic Mike"", from a screenplay by Channing Tatum about his life as a male stripper before he became an actor. It stars Tatum, Matt Bomer (TV's ""White Collar""), Alex Pettyfer (""I Am Number 4"", ""Beastly"") and Joe Manganiello (HBO's ""True Blood"") as fellow strippers. Yeah. Another Oscar contender, I'm sure. Then, his HBO biopic of Liberace starring Michael Douglas and Matt Damon. Hopefully, Soderbergh will then be back on track and create something to rival ""Out of Sight"", ""Erin Brockovich"" or ""Traffic"".",1329177600,,8850,4.725388601036269
4957553,5,B006512I7Q,"I loved Haywire, it was a refreshing old school action movie with a simple primal and clean plot (revenge) that relied on awesome fighting scenes and great action rather than the much over used special effects that we see way too much nowadays.

I was REALLY impressed with Gina Carano in this movie not only was this her first real movie, and not only was she in there with a top notch all-star who's who of Hollywood cast where poor acting would have REALLY stood out but she was the star of the movie, who the movie was focused on, and she did an amazing job of carrying this movie.  Gina's fight scenes were just awesome!!!!!, her portrayal of a gorgeous badass black opps contractor for hire was totally believable..............I also found myself both liking and rooting for Mallory Kane (Gina's character) and the fighting scenes were so brutally real i found myself cringing and wincing at some of the impacts................Like I said it was hard to believe this was Carano's first real movie, if she doesnt become a ""bigtime"" action star like the Rock I will be very surprised and very disappointed!!!!

I'm REALLY hoping for a sequel to Haywire it kinda reminded me of the Bourne series movies..........All I can say to anyone who  didn't like Haywire, I think either you don't really care for action movies or you saw the big time all star cast and figured there would be a much more complex plot with more dramatic character development and acting  rather than the simple very clean plot that I feel worked very well, with the main focus on the amazing fight and action scenes..........on a similar note to anyone who didn't like Gina Carano as Mallory Kane, you have to ask yourself was she believable as a gorgeous badass black opps contractor for hire, did you find yourself liking and/or rooting for Mallory Kane, did you find yourself cringing or wincing during any of the brutally realistic fighting scenes.........if you answered yes to any of these then Gina did a great job............Good actors or actresses inspire strong feelings, they pull you into the movie and make you feel what they are feeling, like or hate or root for them........Poor actors are either miscast and/or not believable in their roles or say or do something annoying or distracting that takes our focus away from the story and character they are trying to portray. The acting and casting in Haywire was top notch.

Right now the Rock is the ONLY real ""bigtime"" action star we have Stalone, Arnold, VanDam, Seagal,  etc......have pretty much passed the baton and are pretty much retired action movie stars, and we've NEVER really had a woman action star............I think just like The Rock, Gina Carano has the charm, charisma, beauty and skills to become a bigtime action star.........I think thats what Soderberg saw in her as well, and I think thats why she was so popular in MMA...........she has that ""something special"" that will allow her to fill a key niche and make lots of amazing badass movies, she's a total package with amazing fighting skills that translate to the big screen very well, great charisma and charm, and a rare combination of beauty, while still being totally believable as a badass..............I cant think of another action star who was as good in their first movie........she was MUCH better than Arnold, VanDam, Seagall,  Rampage Jackson...........and worlds better than Triple H, John Cena etc.........under MUCH more difficult circumstances ( being the STAR of her first movie with an all star who's who of Hollywood cast to measure up to)

Like the Rock I also think Carano could be versatile enough to play other roles than action and be good.  she has a lot of charm and charisma and a genuine down to earth sweetness and I think she would be could in romantic comedy type movies and of course super hero movies and dramas...........Not sure if she could be mean enough to play a villain or not though........but I do think she would make an AMAZING  Wonder Woman........since Lynda Carter played that role I NEVER thought another actress could match up to her but I take that back today Carano has the beauty, charm, sweetness and amazing smile to play the role plus she brings the badass amazonian comic book presence to the role as well that I cant see ANYONE but her bringing.

In closing I'm hoping to see more Haywire sequels!!!!...........and ALOT more Gina Carano!!!!!",1327795200,3,4412,4.836870026525199

I first watched it when it came out on Netflix and before Gina Carano got the recognition from Deadpool that she now has. Wow! From the opening scene I was caught off guard and surprised with the turn of events. It is now Dec2016 and I just watched it again. I vaguely remembered the movie, but was caught off guard again.

Fight scenes are great stylistic fighting and feel very realistic.

What is with the cast of class A actors? Wow! So many big names in this movie, meaning everything is well acted.

Sure the overall plot has been done before, but it felt original.

Great use of color and cinematography.

Thus use of music and sound (or lack thereof) created a retro mood, but also heightened the suspense.

More people need to give this movie a chance, as it is fully entertaining, stylistic in mood and action and so much better than the Jason Bourne 2016 movie. I mean basically that is what this is...female Jason Bourne.",1481673600,,1010,4.516483516483516

4957875,5,B006512I7Q,"Well, some say it's a female version of Jason Bourn.
But it's a bit different.
It's Steven Soderbergh you know. He started his career as an indie filmmaker and then became famous with <ERIN BROCOVICH> and action movies like <OUT OF SIGHT> then jumped into <TRAFFIC> then famous <OCEAN'S  11> then <OCEAN'S 12, 13>.
Then he was not able to make any more famous movies since then.
This one was not so famous too.
But that doesn't mean that it's a bad film.
Many people are crazy about this movie because 1. It has a wonderful chase scenes not with cars but with foot.
2. It has a lot of fighting shots not with guns or swards but with fists and feet (But mostly with fists). Yes it isn't a kung fu movie. But it is really serious fight movie all right and it is really serious. When the main actress Gina Carano is fighting with Channing Tatum we harely can breath not only because our main hero is a woman and she is beaten by a man kicked and almost killed and fight back of course to be survived.

Also the chasing scene happening on the roof top reminded me of TAKEN, but it is way more intensive.
Gina Carano could have been killed by fallen off the roof a million times.

Again Gina Carano is a charmming woman. She is not super pretty but somewhat good to look at the whole time. She knows how to please the audience. She is somewhat sexy even.
She is a Nikita feeling warrior also.
She is tought but soft at the same time.

You can see her again from DEADPOOL it's a small roll but she acted the Angel dust. It's charming body built lady she acted.

All in all, this movie is a pop corn flick and you will enjoy your evening with nothing serious but relaxed and take a ride.",1471305600,,1680,4.221183800623053

Ewan McGregor, Michael Fassbender, Antinio Banderas, Bill Paxton and even Michael Douglas support martial arts athlete Gina Carano in this $23 million action film.  But there is not nearly enough action and the story is so confused that we often don't know exactly what is going on.  That does not make a good movie experience.
  Director Soderbergh does a good job of shooting around his star, a non-actress.  He concentrates her screen time to shots of her walking around, looking around and of course chasing or being chased by bad guys.  Or fighting bad guys which she does in a very convincing way.  But her romantic interlude, and indeed most of the back story set ups, seems just stuck in rather than organic.  ""Hey Marty, let's get the kids to kiss in the third scene, ok?""

Gina Carano is utilized well here, presenting a stoic, taciturn protagonist with a formidable presence throughout.  Surrounding her with a number of top-tier actors was a good decision to help balance out her lack of acting experience/ability.
DO NOT go into this expecting a Bourne/Taken-esque action movie. Director Steven Soderbergh makes the movie feel almost like a throwback to action films of old, complimented by its classy score, and stable non-frenetic camerawork.",1454112000,,598,5.351063829787234

Yeah, i have to accept that the stunts by Gina Carano seem really good (not awesome) and she does some nice moves, but that's about it!. there is nothing really interesting here. The movie has some action sequences but the lack of story just makes you keep wondering when something interesting will happen or when the movie will present you with a twist. But this never happens..by the end of the movie you still want more..but  not because the movie gave you lots of action and you wish there was more content..but because there just isn't enough worth the price for the dvd or blu-ray...soo you just wish there would have been at least a better and more entertaining story..they could have given the veteran actors (like Mcgregor, Banderas or Douglas) more credit or better roles during the movie.

4958238,2,B006512I7Q,"I've got a lot of respect for what Gina Carano has accomplished as an athlete despite the fact that I don't watch MMA, but she has a long way to go as an actress.  It's as if the entire film had to be directed around her inability to act...every time she talks the dialogue is slow and awkward, so they limit her to single words and short sentences.  Aside from her thunder thigh MMA style take downs, we've seen all this action before and when you compare it to how good Hollywood can make Liam Neeson look (Taken, etc.) the action in the scenes feels more like a Van Daam movie from the 80's.

I was impressed with the cast and thought it would be decent, but it lost me early on and got worse as it went...the story is stupid and Ms. Carano's acting made me feel like I was watching a porn flick...hey there's an idea.

For those that like this movie, I've got something I'm sure you will like:

Even though Gina Carano is no Bruce Lee, this girl can kick some serious ass. She is beautiful, sexy and equal to any man enemy in this movie.

4958352,5,B006512I7Q,"Be very honest with yourself:  Do you like spy thrillers?  Because, not knowing you, if I had to guess your reaction to this film I would guess you'll like it about as much as you like the genre in which it fits so snugly within.  It's a spy thriller about a wronged spy simultaneously avoiding danger and seeking justice.  You have seen this film before if you are familiar with the genre.

That being said, I enjoyed the visual texture of the film, the tight storyline (little to no fluff; just progression of the main story), and, most of all, Gina Carano.  On the one hand, they obviously dubbed her voice.  Those of us who remember her from her MMA days will notice that more or less right away.  It's an odd choice partly because the voice-over actress has a very stern and unpleasant voice that doesn't fit Gina at all, and partly because if you take a big chance by casting an unknown non-actor in a film like this, it seems a bit unsteady and weak to cancel out part of that bravery by dubbing the woman's voice.  Neverminding that, the fight scenes are outstanding; most especially the fight in the hotel, which I would rank as one of the better exchanges of its kind captured on film.

All that being said, just remember:  it's a genre film.  It won't change your mind about the genre or appeal to people who ordinarily hate spy thrillers.  But if you are at least somewhat intrigued by that menu option, I'd recommend this film to you.",1418774400,3,1447,4.4356060606060606

No super close-ups, shaky cam, or quick editing to be found here, you can clearly follow every single brutal move and counter-move. Like I mentioned above, the choreography is very well done and much better than the hand-to-hand combat typically seen in western action movies. It reminded me a little of The Raid, though these fights don't drag on the way those did.
Plot is nothing special, though I will give credit for not making everything crystal clear through heavy handed exposition. The viewer is expected to be competent enough to follow the plot though jumps in time/place as well as a double cross or two.
Gina Carano is a fine lead for this movie. Her physical abilities are incredible and obviously the reason she was cast. Her acting tends to be pretty subdued, but in all fairness she is paired up with folk like Michael Fassbender, Ewan Macgregor, Michael Douglas and other long time actors and she holds her own ok.

4958584,3,B006512I7Q,"""Haywire"", as most of us know, is Gina Carano's first foray into the world of cinema and there are no real surprises with stunts and fighting, but with acting. Carano goes toe to toe with veteran actors and easily holds her own. Yes, I have heard criticism about her acting but I feel it is unwarranted. She emotes naturally and although green around the edges at times, is really making an impressive transition towards being a thespian . As to her physical appearance, she can go from being ultra sexy looking to a bit hard and drab looking, and that to me is not such a bad thing. When you see the less beautiful Gina your looking at a real women and it further attracts you to her character. ""Haywire"" has three solid fight scenes that some might want to watch the film alone for, including myself. This is the lure of a Gina Carano film. I don't foresee her in some great artsy period piece and I don't know that I want to. She is simply a dynamite female action star with an alluring screen presence.

The story itself is a choppy spy flick that offers more than a few dull moments. Antonio Bandaras is the most interesting of the purposely male crammed ""super talent"" names attached to the film as he conveys a sneaky self pleasing demeanor. Michael Douglas is again showing that his ""boss in charge"" role highlights his typical schtick. His performance adds nothing special to the movie. He didn't even show up for some commentary in the ""Men Of Haywire"" featurette .Director Soderberg was certainly on the right track selecting a first venture such as this for Carano but he seemed too focused on creating a bag of twists and turns that rely heavily on flashbacks and quick glimpses which in turn take you through stretched out moments of non entertainment.

One other point is that Bill Paxton was terribly miscast as Carano's dad. There may be an absolute age gap in real life but for film purposes Paxton didn't look the part. The unintended poor chemistry between father and daughter was extremely apparent to boot. Many films contain negatives but are still enjoyable, and Haywire"" is one of them. Amazon at this point doesn't carry the blu ray version. Just keep that in mind because I feel this is the kind of film that would be good for HD viewing, particularly as it relates to sound. The musical soundtrack is awesome. I guess the film was called ""Haywire"" because things go wrong, otherwise I don't get a great mental connection to the film from the title. Maybe guys (and girls) go ""haywire"" seeing Carano in a dress, and that's definitely understandable.",1406851200,,2576,4.634573304157549

I forced myself through it just cause I had paid for the rental and I don't like to waste...On that note, I'm a huge Carano fan, she is gorgeous and also is an amazing athlete, so I get why they made this role for her, but she needs to develop a better on screen personality. She should study some Angelina Jolie because if she (Carano) could act a little better, she would be a superstar. Also, Chatum needs to develop a darker, more serious on-screen personality and he could be a bad A5$! Overall, there was plenty of opportunity to wow the audience because of the plot, but the lack of a true action-based cinematic presentation really was disappointing to me. There was also a ton of lag time (stretched out scenes) throughout the show that had me racking my head against the remote. It almost feels like they filmed the first reading of the script and went with that for the movie. I only gave two stars because of the Cast, the person who recruited all this cast should be given some sort of an award to be able to sell a B-rated film to all those stars.",1401667200,,1152,4.313364055299539

Gina Carano was surrounded by a cast of really fine actors to showcase her talent. They delivered and allowed her to shine. She certainly has the chops to play this kind of role.  I look forward to seeing her in other films. One note I would like to make is that this was not a real test of her ACTING ability. I suspect she will become a competent actress, given time and the right scripts and direction.

The plot for this was intricate without being too confusing.  I was left wondering at first, but the way Soderbergh chose to tell the tale  made for an entertaining train ride.  What I found amusing was that I did not recognize Ewan McGregor. The way he played his part and the way he was directed was so different from the roles I have seen him in previously, that I I failed to recognize him. Another plus for this film!

amazing & incredibly tight fight scenes set this apart from most action movies, during all of her fights you get the sense that she's acutely aware of every inch of her body & always in total control.

midway through the movie there's a great fight scene, and where most movies would fall back on in your face music... you get nothing but combat sounds during a life and death struggle.

her acting is great, especially for someone who's so junior... she doesn't mumble or stammer through her lines... her self-confidence really shines through.

4958688,3,B006512I7Q,"One of Eastwood's famous quotes goes that he hates it when a $25 million movie ends up looking like a $4 million movie.

Eastwood is not going to like this movie much.

I'm not an American resident and I would never watch martial arts on TV anyway. Apparently Gina Carano is a hot property on the martial arts circuit. I wiki'd her and googled Images Gina Carano and was surprised to learn that she has a really nice smile and smiles a lot in public. You'd never guess it from this movie. The script calls for her to have the personality of a wounded warthog and she executes that perfectly. Small wonder that the movie has failed even to break even.

Probably some of the $25 million budget was wasted on high-priced names like Banderas and Douglas. What was the point of casting these guys, really?

Apart from that, I liked the action sequences, obviously. The camerawork contributes strongly to the mood, being brisk and businesslike with no time wasted on establishment shots and pretty scenery. I can't understand the ""doof doof"" sound effects for gunshots instead of the realistic ""bang bang."" Otherwise the sound was pretty good. Normally non-Americans struggle to understand American actors, more because of mumbled inaudible lines than due to the accent. I heard it all perfectly and had no need to switch on subtitles. Sound engineer, take a bow.

It's a pretty standard example of the thriller genre. Fast plot, international, violence, good action scenes. They cast Carano in the lead not only because of her martial arts background, but because she's eye candy. Then they told her to act like a sexless robot. It didn't really work for me and it hasn't worked for paying audiences either.",1388188800,,1702,4.795221843003413

It is raw, gritty and much more realistic than the junk they pump out of tinsel town. The jazz score is outstanding and worth owning on its own.

4958691,1,B006512I7Q,"I greatly respect Steven Soderbergh as a smart man who knows the industry well and knows his cinema.

But this movie is the most appalling disaster I have ever had the displeasure of watching.

- Fire the editor
- Fire the music composer
- Fire the DP
- Fire the colorist
- Fire the set designer

*Keep the fight choreographer.

I don't even know where to start, this is Paranormal Activities bad.

Okay, here we go.

Look Hollywood, I know you guys think Gina Carano is gorgeous, and she is definitely very pretty. But let's get one thing straight here. Gina Carano is at best, a stunt woman. She is not and will never be an actress. The girl can't act, period the end.

Her character was quite bland as was her acting. But her fight scenes? Those were the stars of the show. In fact, it was only because of the fight scenes that I wanted to watch the movie. (Well and the fact that it's a female lead.)

When Hollywood complains that female leads don't draw in audiences. It's because movies like this which should have great potential, are done so poorly. I am a huge supporter of female lead movies and even wrote a book about a superheroine lead. But this movie is not a step in the right direction. She is so poorly written, the movie so poorly done, it felt like I was watching a student film.

Need a more in-depth breakdown? All right, let's get this done before I'm late for dinner.

1.) Who thought it was a smart idea to have a piss colored yellow filter over almost all the shots? It's hideous, it's distracting, and an overbearing vignette makes the movie look much darker than it should.

2.) The music was so out of place for this movie. I kept on expecting Bruce Lee to pop up and for the camera to do a rapid zoom in to the close up shots. Terrible selection of music which ruined the mood and atmosphere of the whole movie. It was very campy and didn't mesh well with anything in this movie.

3.) Where the hell is the tension? News flash to the editor. Cutting a bunch of scenes of Gina Carano running around without someone actually chasing her. Is very boring. Having her chase someone through Spain without even the obligatory fruit cart turn over, is boring. Sitting on a shot of her reversing a car for almost 2 minutes, IS BORING!

What the hell where they thinking with this movie? Everything was so drawn out and so padded, and so damn boring. Take a note from the James Bond movies, they know how to do a foot chase.

4.) Poorly written script with awful dialogue. I didn't feel surprised or shocked with any of the reveals in the movie because they just weren't that interesting and have been done to death.

So I did a bit of homework and checked IMDB. So apparently Steven did the cinematography and the editing.

Sorry dude, I have great respect for you as an intelligent man, but you're fired.

If you're looking for a heart pounding action movie with a bad ass female lead. Keep looking, because this movie ain't it. Don't even watch it for free.",1387497600,3,2981,4.390909090909091

The long, drawn out pacing of scenes makes the occasional frenetic action more exciting. No one doubted Ms. Carano could handle the physical side, but she didn't let us down on the acting either.

4958750,2,B006512I7Q,"But it's not her fault.  Carano does a pretty good job as does the stellar cast she's surrounded with.  The problem lies solely on the shoulders of director Steven Soderbergh.
Soderbergh is known for strong female leads and likes to make smart movies.  A movie featuring an ex-MMA fighter as a betrayed agent out for revenge almost can't fit that second part.  What should have been a fast paced, sexy action movie featuring lots of fight scenes and gunplay (which is what the previews make it look like!) is instead a plodding, lumbering dinosaur of a movie that just never gets up and goes.
Ultimately the movie is just boring.  The gunfights are stilted and disappointing.  The fight scenes are all the same: Carano gets hammered by which ever man she's fighting in this 10 minute segment until she lands one big spectacular shot that turns the tide and allows her to end the fight.  The only moment of excitement comes during the car chase scene more than halfway through the movie.  Too bad that scene only lasts about 2 minutes.
Ultimately Carano is a likable and able rising action star.  She just needs to find a better director to make her a name brand and leave Soderbergh to direct more movies featuring George Clooney.  After all, that's what he's best at.",1373932800,,1268,4.671171171171171

The bigger surprise was that her acting in the non-action heavy scenes was pleasantly solid.  The supporting cast was also excellent.  Though... I can never take Bill Paxton seriously.
The storyline is straightforward with a few quirky not exactly hard to see coming twists, but I wasn't left needing any more nuanced story.  The simplicity left the filmmakers with the opportunity to focus on some of the other details like the score and fight scene choreography.

Carano falls somewhere in between. She definitely does not have the charisma of The Rock, and in this movie is very raw. You can tell that the script was written with that in mind. She is not good at conveying emotion. While she does have potential, and if she keeps at it and gets training, can probably be OK, her performance here is best described as wooden. You could not tell the difference between any emotional state. She was the same serious, angry, horny, and scared. She is basically there to look pretty and fight. And she does that well.

There is a good backing ensemble cast that you can tell was put in place to support that fact that Carano was green. Unfortunately the script was such that they even the A list actors in the cast could do much. All that said, if you are in to action movies, and can handle a so so script and marginal acting ability from the lead role, this can be enjoyable.

4958792,2,B006512I7Q,"Haywire (Steven Soderbergh, 2011)

I'll start off with two confessions: (a) the last Steven Soderbergh movie I actually liked was 1999's The Limey, and (b) not a single review I read of Haywire before watching the film mentioned that it was directed by Steven Soderbergh, so when I added it to my Netflix queue, I had no idea it was anything other than the Gina Carano vehicle I'd seen it painted as so many times. Soderbergh earned my eternal scorn with the trio of remakes he did just after The Limey, which desecrated two of my favorite movies of all time (Ocean's 11 and Solyaris) and turned an interesting, intelligent TV miniseries into a brainless rah-rah-rah feature (Traffic) that begged me to turn it off at least once a minute for its entire length. And I rush to add that Haywire, brainless as it is, is nowhere as awful as that trio of obscenity, but all those ""Gina Carano vehicle"" reviews are right, in the classic sense of the term: this is a movie that focuses the viewer's attention on Carano despite there being the usual bevy of huge-name stars who seem to cleave to Soderbergh like remora sucking on hammerheads.

Plot: MMA champ Carano plays Mallory Kane, an ex-government operative now working for a private company headed by Kenneth (Ewan MacGregor, whose very presence in a film spells doom). As we open, she's sitting in a little diner in upstate New York, waiting to be extracted after a botched operation. Aaron (Magic Mike's Channing Tatum), another operative, shows up. We get the idea from their conversation that he was somehow involved in the operation, but we don't have details yet. He attempts to forcibly abduct her when she refuses to go with him; despite being able to take care of herself, she is aided both by a waitress (stuntwoman Debby Ross Rondell in one of her few appearances as an actress) and Scott, an innocent bystander (Red State's Michael Angarano). Presumably, the waitress has to finish out her shift, so Kane--one of only three people in the film with a given last name--grabs Scott, heads out the door, commandeers his car, and spends most of the rest of the movie in flashback, telling him about said botched operation. It seems Kenneth sent her to Barcelona to extract a guy while partnered with an MI6 agent named Paul (Hunger's Michael Fassbender). Problem is, the guy in question ended up dead, as did Paul after he attempted to kill her, resulting in Kane doing a bunch of globetrotting with agents, cops, and pretty much the rest of the world on her trail--and now her fate is in the hands of a nineteen-year-old whose greatest achievement is having just bought a Prius. (I think it was a Prius.) Can Mallory, filtering all the data she has through Scott, figure out what went wrong before she ends up in the hands of people who obviously want her dead?

I didn't even scrape the surface of the massive names here. The opening scene, where the Barcelona job is hashed out, has MacGregor in a room with Michael Douglas and Antonio Banderas, who's a really good friend of Matthieu Kassovitz' (if the name isn't as familiar as those first three, go grab yourself a copy of La Haine posthaste. I'll wait). Kane's father is played by Bill Paxton; the guy they're supposed to extract is Anthony Brandon Wong, from the Matrix franchise. I could go on and on. And while Carano is a decent enough actor for genre work, it's kind of ridiculous to expect her to hold her own with a cast of that caliber. But...she does.

And here's where my problems with Steven Soderbergh come to the fore. Here's a guy who, at the beginning of his career, was notable for getting fantastic performances out of his actors; was Andie MacDowell ever better than she was in sex, lies, and videotape? But once you get past Terence Stamp kicking ass and taking names in The Limey, and the similarity of Stamp's role there and Carano's here has not escaped me, Soderbergh seems to have gone the exact opposite way. Everyone in this movie save Carano and MacGregor, who is never capable of acting even up to the ""meh"" level, gives a performance best characterized as ""meh"". Which, by default, makes Carano the standout. How does that happen in a movie containing Michael Fassbender, who's under consideration by a whole lot of people I know as the Best Actor Working in Movies Today (TM)? It has to be Soderbergh's direction.

That said, if you're looking for a turn-your-brain-off action picture that showcases Gina Carano doing a whole lot of what she does best--beating people up--than Haywire is as good a choice as anything. But, man, Lem Dobbs' script is all over the place, way too complex and not nearly enough fun. Dobbs has always been inconsistent; I still have a hard time believing the guy who wrote the sublime Dark City was also responsible for the ridiculous Hider in the House (we'll also note in passing: guess who wrote The Limey?). This, however, represents a new low for Dobbs, if not for Soderbergh. **",1364256000,,4954,4.689655172413793

4958812,4,B006512I7Q,"Steven Soderbergh, the director of HAYWIRE, took a chance casting a mixed-martial arts star named Gina Carano in this movie released in January 2012.  It was her first film.  Carano plays an ex-Marine, now government assassin who turns rogue. Onscreen she's a cross between Linda Fiorentino (The Last Seduction) and Noomi Repace (The Girl With the Dragon Tattoo). As beautiful and raven haired as Fiorentino and as svelte and agile as Repace in black leather, Carano plays her role more like a Cyborg than a human. And she does her own stunts...great stuff.

As Time film critic Richard Corliss writes in his review, this movie is ""sooo 1940's.""  Yes, it's an ""ingenious, old-school, thrill-a-minute"" entertaining movie needing no special effects, loud sound track, wild car chases nor hand-held cameras. And it's filmed mainly in Ireland...with one segment in a luxury suite in The Shelbourne Hotel for a little glam.

Gina Carano may be new to film-goers...but there's an impressive array of male superstars.  Michael Douglas, Ewan McGregor, Michael Fassbender, Antonio Banderas and Channing Tatum.  ""...effervescent eye candy for guys and gals alike.""

Critic Corliss sums up the action with a comparision to another popular action thriller: ""It's James Bond vs. Rosa Klebb in the From Russia With Love train compartment.  Only you're rooting for Rosa...""

4958831,2,B006512I7Q,"I really like and admire Gina Carrano, and I hate to pan this movie, but the directing and screenplay were both just so painfully bad that honesty compels me to do so. Gina Carrano tried her best, and she gives an entirely credible performance, especially considering her background is that of an MMA cage fighter, not an actress. But Steven Soderbergh was a very poor choice of a director for an action film. The Sitcom is his forte, and he apparently has no understanding of any other genre.

The story is the same trite, cliche nonsense we have all seen 100 times before, ""secret agent set up and betrayed by her own agency, and now she's on the run and looking for revenge"".

The military uses the term ""blivet"" to mean 20 pounds of steer manure stuffed into a ten-pound bag, and that's a good description of this movie.",1360627200,,824,4.523489932885906

4958846,5,B006512I7Q,"Gina Carano stars as a former-Marine turned agent for a private security company. This film is reminiscent of the Bourne series in that Carano's character is meticulous, highly intelligent and indefatigable. Director Soderbergh keeps you guessing while Carano is on the run; he uses long, continuous shots in which the viewer doesn't know how the plot will unfold.
The plot is a bit hard to follow at first, you have to pay close attention in order to make sense of all of the inside references i.e., ""I was a devil dog"", ""I'm on a 1024...check a New Mexico license for Mallory Kane"", etc.
Carano's performance is steely. She exudes an understated confidence and explodes in her fight scenes with live action that is not in the rapid cutting style of most modern action films. She kicks ass in real time AND Gina Carano is *really* doing it. In real life, Gina Carano is an experienced and very successful mixed martial arts athlete. She does all of her own stunts in the film (with the exception of just one scene in which a stunt woman who specializes in gymnastics performed a fall off of a building in Carano's place).
Carano got panned in the NYtimes for not being emotional enough in her role as an action heroine- which is just blatant sexism. Matt Damon was no less stoic in his performance as Jason Bourne and nary a critic complained about his acting. This film is singular for many reasons, one of which is that the viewer is being asked to care about a woman who never gets naked, or behaves as a stereotypical sex object in an *action* movie. Finally, an action movie in which women can relate to the main character and men are invited to identify with a female protagonist who kicks men's asses left and right (as opposed to the age old formula of action hero = man, and female viewers must learn to identify with the male protagonist, regardless of how sexist he may be).
Sequel, please.

4958848,5,B006512I7Q,"I loved Haywire, it was a refreshing old school action movie with a simple primal and clean plot (revenge) that relied on awesome fighting scenes and great action rather than the much over used special effects that we see way too much nowadays.

I was REALLY impressed with Gina Carano in this movie not only was this her first real movie, and not only was she in there with a top notch all-star who's who of Hollywood cast where poor acting would have REALLY stood out but she was the star of the movie, who the movie was focused on, and she did an amazing job of carrying this movie.  Gina's fight scenes were just awesome!!!!!, her portrayal of a gorgeous badass black opps contractor for hire was totally believable..............I also found myself both liking and rooting for Mallory Kane (Gina's character) and the fighting scenes were so brutally real i found myself cringing and wincing at some of the impacts................Like I said it was hard to believe this was Carano's first real movie, if she doesnt become a ""bigtime"" action star like the Rock I will be very surprised and very disappointed!!!!

I'm REALLY hoping for a sequel to Haywire it kinda reminded me of the Bourne series movies..........All I can say to anyone who  didn't like Haywire, I think either you don't really care for action movies or you saw the big time all star cast and figured there would be a much more complex plot with more dramatic character development and acting  rather than the simple very clean plot that I feel worked very well, with the main focus on the amazing fight and action scenes..........on a similar note to anyone who didn't like Gina Carano as Mallory Kane, you have to ask yourself was she believable as a gorgeous badass black opps contractor for hire, did you find yourself liking and/or rooting for Mallory Kane, did you find yourself cringing or wincing during any of the brutally realistic fighting scenes.........if you answered yes to any of these then Gina did a great job............Good actors or actresses inspire strong feelings, they pull you into the movie and make you feel what they are feeling, like or hate or root for them........Poor actors are either miscast and/or not believable in their roles or say or do something annoying or distracting that takes our focus away from the story and character they are trying to portray. The acting and casting in Haywire was top notch.

Right now the Rock is the ONLY real ""bigtime"" action star we have Stalone, Arnold, VanDam, Seagal,  etc......have pretty much passed the baton and are pretty much retired action movie stars, and we've NEVER really had a woman action star............I think just like The Rock, Gina Carano has the charm, charisma, beauty and skills to become a bigtime action star.........I think thats what Soderberg saw in her as well, and I think thats why she was so popular in MMA...........she has that ""something special"" that will allow her to fill a key niche and make lots of amazing badass movies, she's a total package with amazing fighting skills that translate to the big screen very well, great charisma and charm, and a rare combination of beauty, while still being totally believable as a badass..............I cant think of another action star who was as good in their first movie........she was MUCH better than Arnold, VanDam, Seagall,  Rampage Jackson...........and worlds better than Triple H, John Cena etc.........under MUCH more difficult circumstances ( being the STAR of her first movie with an all star who's who of Hollywood cast to measure up to)

Like the Rock I also think Carano could be versatile enough to play other roles than action and be good.  she has a lot of charm and charisma and a genuine down to earth sweetness and I think she would be could in romantic comedy type movies and of course super hero movies and dramas...........Not sure if she could be mean enough to play a villain or not though........but I do think she would make an AMAZING  Wonder Woman........since Lynda Carter played that role I NEVER thought another actress could match up to her but I take that back today Carano has the beauty, charm, sweetness and amazing smile to play the role plus she brings the badass amazonian comic book presence to the role as well that I cant see ANYONE but her bringing.

In closing I'm hoping to see more Haywire sequels!!!!...........and ALOT more Gina Carano!!!!!",1359331200,4,4412,4.836870026525199

4958868,4,B006512I7Q,"Steven Soderbergh delivers a tense and pretty intense very physical and gritty even amidst its elegance thriller.  Gina Carano was critiqued as being ""strong, fast, relentless"" and I'd have to agree.  She more than holds her own as Mallory Kane, a black ops badass who is about to get out of the business but is pulled in for that one last job.  After reading what I just wrote I can see how many people would groan, but you need not!  The story is packed with verve and visceral fights, showcasing an engaging Carano in one-on-one knockdowns as well as beating up multiple bogeys.  But it is the one-on-one fights that really shine as she goes against men that look the bigger and stronger.  It certainly doesn't hurt that Soderbergh pulled in a lot of stars (from the ""it"" man Channing Tatum to Obi Wan Kenobi himself, Ewan McGregor).  The story contains a few twists that are tidied up by story's end and it all ends satisfactorily for our heroine.

This actioner plays by the rules for the most part and doesn't try to twist your brain inside out or make you think than it is more than it is.  I appreciate that especially when the film is exciting.  Two scenes that stand out in my mind still after watching it several months ago are the coffee shop ambush where Carano goes up against a brutish and heavy-handed Tatum and in the hotel where she and her partner, spies posing as a married couple, do a brutal and bashing dance to the death.  This was much more satisfying (and even felt believeable) than anything that, say, ""Mr. & Mrs. Smith"" ever threw at us.

4958896,4,B006512I7Q,"I would like to give this a 5-star rating to offset the many negative reviews.  But, to be fair, the movie did seem low-budget, the story-line was choppy, and some of the scenes were contrived.  The acting was good because the actors (Douglas, Banderas, Tatum, Fassbender, etc.) are good and the directing solid.  As some have stated, this was a vehicle to introduce Carano.  My take on that is, she's believable as an action acter like Cynthia Rothrock and Michelle Yeoh but with much more realistic (and affective) fighting.  She is fast, tough, and brutal (those are good things).  Her character did not require a broad range of acting skills (but look at Arnold, Stallone, Strathom, etc.) but what it did require, Carano delivered.  I hope she gets the chance to show us more.

Would like to mention one other thing.  Hollywood seems to have conditioned audiences to want hystrionics in the dialog and reactions to events.  I found the measured reponses in this movie to be much more believable.  I think the negative reviews generally reflect more on the desire of viewers to see what Hollywood has conditioned them to want to see.",1352851200,2,1136,4.804123711340206

There's a lot of really good fighting sequences, and I think this was the perfect movie to introduce Carano to the world of cinema.

4958901,3,B006512I7Q,"The action hero genre has long resisted a strong female lead. Although Angelina Jolie is the current reigning queen, her sexiness is as much a driving force as her martial prowess. Steven Soderbergh clearly thought he could do better with Gina Carano, a real life mixed martial arts champion. Is she up to the challenge?

Yes and no. One the one hand, Soderbergh has created a character that's not very hard for her to play. Mallory Kane (Carano) is a Jason Bourne-style cipher, with a ruthless reputation. When she is tapped for a mission as a government contractor, there are layers upon layers of intrigue that swirl around her, with Kane as the most valuable piece in the game. That doesn't really ever reflect on Carano's face though, which seems to be frozen in a bemused smirk.

The story is told in media res as she meets a man in a diner who isn't who she hoped. Soderbergh carefully stages each one of her fight scenes, and it's fascinating to see Carano in action. She literally crawls up her opponents, using a woman's physical advantages - powerful legs - to counterbalance opponents who are out of her weight class. After fleeing the scene with the assistance of an innocent bystander, she tells him -- and the audience - her tale.

And it's a doozy. A Chinese dissident/professor/journalist has been kidnapped and it's up to Carano's team to get him back. Or is it? Is she working for the good guys or the bad guys? This being a Soderbergh film, it's likely there are no good guys here.

Soderbergh has fun with his, casting Carano in a variety of scenes where she brutally beats men to death. See Kane kill a man in a diner...in a cocktail dress...and on a beautiful beach as the sun sets!

Carano plays Kane as uncomfortable in social settings. ""I don't do the dress thing"" she quips. But she has to, because that's a staple of the modern spy genre and Carano is beautiful enough to pull it off. The scene of course ends with more bare-knuckled brawling in an evening dress, which unfortunately still feeds into the observer effect common to these kinds of films.

Still, Carano lends a toughness and believability to a character archetype that has long been fetishized. You can see it in her combat style, in her eyes, and most importantly in her hands. Her paws are big and meaty, not the dainty fingers of an actress who lives a life of luxury off set. Kane looks like she can punch you in the face, and that's exactly how it should be.

4958925,4,B006512I7Q,"I am a lover of well choregraphed fight scenes. From Bruce Lee classics to Jet Li, Jackie Chan, and beyond, I have seen and loved many a fight scene. My recent favorites have been Ong Bak, Unleashed, and The Raid. While this film doesn't come close to these films, it does leave a mark in its own way.

The other martial arts films mentioned are based around fighting multiple baddies at once, and big boss-style battles. They also feature high flying styles of fighting. This film has several fight scenes that showcase Carano's MMA skills. Mixed Martial Arts is the most practical style of fighting around. It combines jui-jitsu with wrestling an other stlyles. What it ends up looking like on screen is a really well choregraphed and skill-ful brawl. No backflips and spinning roundhouses here. Just realistic, grounded, and brutal violence.

The movie itself is not too bad. Carano's acting is a bit choppy, though its her first film. Some of the characters don't get their stories fleshed out too much. But I liked Channing Tatum (good fight scene), Ewan Magregor, and Antonio Banderas. The music is brilliant. Perfect 70s B movie awesomeness.

4958930,2,B006512I7Q,"Prolific director Steven Soderbergh has made so many great movies - ""Sex, Lies, and Videotape,"" ""Erin Brockovich,"" ""Traffic"" and more - and a few bad ones. Whatever he makes, he brings in something new into the material, and ""Haywire"" is no exception. It is stylishly shot. It avoids loud music and big effects. It has some authentic martial arts action stunts. It has a mouth-watering cast that includes Michael Angarano, Antonio Banderas, Michael Douglas, Michael Fassbender, Mathieu Kassovitz, Ewan McGregor, Bill Paxton and Channing Tatum. And it is boring. Yes, ""Haywire"" has styles, but that doesn't mean it is a great movie.

""Haywire"" is about a vengeful black ops agent Mallory Kane played by Gina Carano. This is basically an action movie template that is used differently. The lead is Mallory, a strong female agent. The car chase ends up in an unexpected fashion. The rooftop chase sequence unfolds more slowly (and realistically) than those of usual Hollywood blockbusters. I see the point. Still I must say the film is dull.

For the film's story goes nowhere. Directed by Steven Soderbergh, whose penchant for experimental film techniques is well known among filmgoers, ""Haywire"" goes back and forth in time, showing bits of action here and there, giving us clues as to what happened and is happening. The unique narrative method of deconstructed storyline, that was effectively used in ""The Prestige,"" does not work in ""Haywire,"" of which script is made up of a hackneyed origin story and recycled ideas.

Another disappointing thing about ""Haywire"" is the heroine Mallory Kane herself. Gina Carano can do action (as seen in the film's thrilling martial arts combat scenes), to be sure, but her acting needs to be worked on.

It is reported that the director wanted to create ""a Pam Grier movie made by Alfred Hitchcock."" Well, I see what the director is trying to do, reinventing the espionage-action genre, but Pam Grier has never been dull, and neither is Alfred Hitchcock, master of suspense whose stylish touch never bored us.",1349136000,4,2047,5.047337278106509

People giving this film negative reviews are simply people who don't get the movie and subscribe to mindless fodder like the Fast and the Furious franchise and Top Gun to get their action movie fix. This film is paced like an actual film and not some s&%@ action movie with a bunch of close shots of people fighting hand to hand with quick cuts and edits. What Ronin did with car chases, this movie does with hand to hand fight scenes. The plot lays on a bit thick and does not cater to people who aren't paying attention, no one over acts and Gina Carano isn't the terrible actress people make her out to be. If you can sit through Jessica Alba or Angelina Jolie, then you shouldn't complain about Gina. The music is in the vein of Lalo Schifrin (Bullit, Enter the Dragon) with a very 1970's style score which really adds to the movie. It's shot with digital cameras which allowed for the film to be shot without artificial light which adds to the very cool aesthetic and look of the lighting for the film. While there isn't a fight scene every ten minutes, when they do happen they hit hard and are brutal. This isn't a movie, this is a film, it feels foreign and since it's shot mostly overseas it looks foreign. If you like most of the generic Jason Statham action movies that come out yearly (not counting the 1st Transporter because that movie was awesome and I like Jason Statham) or any of the Fast and Furious movies, you won't like this movie most likely.

4958954,3,B006512I7Q,"First, I hope this film doesn't doorstop Gina Carano from getting a really good action film under her belt. It was acceptable B -  movie fare by a thread but Soderbergh was either asleep or leaving most of the directing duties to a 12 year old. The story, the talent and, probably, the money demanded something better. This could have been Carano's  'Enter the Dragon' but played out like a big budget episode of any current television actioner.
  It really irks me when there are so many of the right cards being held and then, some where along the way, the holder chokes on a simple bet and loses on a beautiful straight.
  I REALLY want to see Gina Carano in more films. She held up her end of things in this one and has credible acting chops to stride along with the physicality of her role and she's hot. This could have been in league with a Bourne flick and even surpassed 'Salt' just with Carano's obviously full inclusive stunt work.
  There was no use of any true camera artistry that wasn't laughable in the 80's.  Steven Soderbergh has done some great films  and owed the entire cast better attention.
  Bill Paxton has mere moments of screen time but owns his part as does Micheal Douglas. Ewan McGregor is a good, smarmy  corporate-type slime-ball and everyone else seems to have fun with their roles.

On to the review:

The film stars Gina Carano as a mercenary for hire (Mallory), who is betrayed by her employers, and must subsequently go on a revenge binge in order to find justice and answers alike. The plot of ""Haywire"" is threadbare, to be sure. But I don't have any problem with that. The problem is that it doesn't really make a whole lot of sense, and it's hard to get invested in the characters or their plight.

Some of the acting is excellent (Michael Douglas and Antonio Banderas, in limited roles), but much of it is a bit stilted (Carano and Paxton). Particularly awkward is the dialogue between Mallory and her father, as they exchange wooden lines as if reading from cue cards.

An interesting technique the director used was to kill all music during fight scenes. The results are mixed. At times, it adds a level of tension and reality to the scenes. However, if you're going to try to pull this off without using music or special effects, you better be really, REALLY good at choreographed fighting. Carano's stage combat is at times convincing, but at others, looked a little silly (like jumping off a wall to kick somebody in the head, ""Underworld"" style). However, this is apparently Carano's first film, so I can't be too hard on her, and this would more the director's responsiblity than the actor's.

This is a decent action/spy/revenge movie to entertain you for an evening, with a rather subdued quality to it. But if you're expecting Mission Impossible or James Bond, you might be disappointed.",1348099200,,2286,4.89922480620155

4958962,3,B006512I7Q,"Gina Carano is a terrible actress.  Outside of that, `Haywire' is a fun ride.  It is a little choppy and at times slightly nonsensical, but in the vein of Soderbergh's other stylized thrillers (like `Ocean's Eleven') this works rather well.  It has a huge ensemble that all hold their own and it has a sharp attention to detail that makes for a lot of thrilling scenes (THIS is how you shoot an action sequence) and yet when all is said and done it makes a minimal impact and thus becomes largely forgettable.  This isn't a film you'll remember for a long time, despite merit in some respects.

This basically follows a rogue black ops soldier, Mallory, who was sold out by someone close to her and is on the run for her life covering up someone else's mistake.  We open with her beating the tar out of Channing Tatum and then explaining how she got there, which then leads into flashbacks of her beating the tar out of Michael Fassbender and then eventually beating the tar out of Ewan McGregor.

As a tool for physical violence, Carano works very well, but when she is given dialog to spew or emotions to portray, she winds up feeling so forced and so calculated that she distracts from the movie.  They should have found a better actress and just used Carano to do the stunt work.  Still, the rest of the cast (especially Fassbender and a shady, bearded, Banderas) shine in their respective roles, and Soderbergh really directs this with finesse and captures all the action marvelously.  No unnecessary close-ups and hectic angles to worry about here.  No frantic movements that confuse the audience and leave the action scenes looking fussy.  Instead, everything is clean and sharp and precise.  I wish that this was a better movie, but I'm not regretting my decision to watch it one iota.",1348012800,2,1793,4.653968253968254

4958967,2,B006512I7Q,"HAYWIRE was a deeply disappointing movie.  Steven Soderbergh has helmed some truly outstanding movies over the year, and when I heard that he was making his own action-thriller with a great cast...I was pretty pumped.

My first hint that this movie might not be great was in his casting of Gina Carano, a well-known MMA star, in the lead.  She brought limited acting experience to the film, which Soderbergh essentially crafted for her.  This is similar to the way in which he created GIRLFRIEND EXPERIENCE to showcase porn star Sasha Gray in a ""legit"" role.  The movie was well-nigh unwatchable, and Gray was okay at best.  Carano is also okay at best.  She's supposed to be carrying an entire movie on her shoulders, but through no fault of her own, she isn't much of an actor.  She's got the action moves down, and I certainly believed she could kick the butt of all these male adversaries...but when required to show emotion, or humor, or determination or any recognizable emotion...her skills were pretty tiny.  Again, Soderbergh apparently saw ""movie star"" in her somewhere and crafted this project for her.  I don't blame her for letting him...but I also doubt we'll be seeing her in many lead roles in the near future.

HAYWIRE tells the story of a black-ops agent (Carano) who has apparently been targeted for elimination by someone she knows as an ally.  The movie tells its story out-of-order...and frankly, I'm not sure there's a good reason for that.  It makes the story needlessly complicated, yet adds NOTHING to the suspense.  We're essentially going from one fight scene to another, and the plot is so thin and the explanations so sketchy...all we know is that we should be rooting FOR her and against anyone trying to kill her.  I suppose I could have given more effort to sorting out the plot specifics...but the movie is so murkily filmed and so un-involving from the get-go that I had no impetus for working that hard.

I had hoped for a guilty-pleasure film...but I'm astonished to say that even a mediocre Jason Statham movie will give you more vicarious action thrills, and will skip the artsy pretense.  There is certainly a case to be made for ""artsy"" genre thrillers (DRIVE springs to mind)...but HAYWIRE is just boring.  Carano has some pretty high profile co-stars, but their roles are either tiny and undemanding (Bill Paxton, Michael Douglass, Antonio Banderas) or the actor can barely muster up any intensity for their role (Ewan McGregor is bland as Carano's boss and Michael Fassbender seems vaguely embarrassed to be in the film).  Channing Tatum generates momentary interest...but his dialogue is also mush-mouthed at times.

It's tempting to give this film one-star, but I'll stick with two because if nothing else, the one-on-one fight scenes ring with some authenticity...people actually seem to get hurt.  I think Carano could be a nice small part of a bigger film...something like THE EXPENDIBLES, perhaps.  But she is no star...no matter how well she kicks a*s.",1347235200,2,3003,4.916666666666667

4958970,4,B006512I7Q,"Steven Soderbergh has directed many successful movies ranging from Sex, Lies and Videotapes to Syriana, Michael Clayton and Oceans Eleven. The latter three all starring George Clooney.

So, when he saw MMA fighter Gina Carrano fight he had the idea to build a movie around her character, and Haywire is the result. His fascination with her is understandable, and he takes an appreciable risk casting an unknown and inexperienced actress in a leading role.

The risk I think does pay off. While she may lack the smooth acting technique of a more established actress, she more than compensates for this with her charisma and presence, her impeccable fighter skills, and fascinating physicality.

When an operation goes wrong members of a shady organisation, intent on cleaning up pursue her with the intent to kill. It's nothing personal just business.

I loved for example that she traveled to Ireland on a mission, and part of the pursuit takes place through Dublin City. The odds against her seem insurmountable, and she has to push to get even before she gets squared away.

Because of her fighting skills the fight scenes have a gripping realism, and usually she is fighting men who are also very skilled, and whether she will win is by no means certain. In one fight she is attacked by surprise from behind.

I have to admit I did enjoy this movie a lot more than I expected. It's a refreshing change from the formula where the fight scenes are obviously choreographed, and you get MTV style cross cutting and slow motion where the heroines hair doesn't get mussed.

You can watch many clips of Gina Carrano on youtube, and decide for yourself if you are intrigued and I totally enjoyed the movie. I do hope it's not the only movie she makes. Haywire boasts an impressive cast that includes Ewan McGregor, Michael Douglas, Michael Fassbender, and Channing Tatum.

The movie has its moments, but its few and far between. It mostly looks like a long music video and sounds like a home movie but doesn't have any of the symbolism or charm of neither. The plot is there just to make people fight each other and the choreography doesn't take full advantage of the star's abilities. Characters are introduced for no reason, I'm not sure of many of the character's motivations, and the ending is corny and baffling.

On the other hand, Nina is probably the most believable female action star I've seen in a while (I am sure she can whoop my behind easily). She's not the typical 85 pound model KOing baddies with a right cross. A few times she does use jiujitsu and leg kicks that have made her infamous in the MMA world. Antonio Banderas phones in another performance but still manages to steal every scene he's in -- but then again it's not like he has much competition.

It's an action film with a story that's nothing new, but it's serviceable, and it's perfect if you're looking for something to just pop in, sit back and relax and enjoy.

Gina Carano is Mallory Kane, a mercenary who is set up for a murder and finds herself the target of her own mercenary contract company and, unlike the audience, she's not going to take that sitting back. The story's been done before and from the onset, we can pretty much guess who the dastardly, double-crossing bad guys are, but Soderbergh manages to keep us engaged with a brisk pace and some nice, unexpected, little twists.

Acting-wise, the A-listers (McGregor, Tatum, Fassbender etc.) competently pull off their roles as you would expect them too. For a newcomer, Gina Carano also holds her own with what she is given; she's sexy, dangerous and in control and it gives her a strong screen presence. When she jumps into action, running, climbing, kicking ass, she delivers as good as she gets...move over Jason Statham.

Speaking of action, it's fast and brutal. There are fights, shoot-outs, car chases...the works. I'm thankful that Steven Soderbergh keeps the camera still with little cutting during action so I can actually track what's going on, it's not that I don't appreciate the in-the-action handheld style of shooting that directors so love to use these days, but if you've got a well-choreographed hand-to-hand fight, I want to see it, not bits and pieces because of jarring camera work.

It's not perfect - I still have some questions about the plot - but 'Haywire' is a fun ride. Carano's an enjoyable leading lady to watch, the action is hard-hitting and Soderbergh adds some real flair with his direction and cinematography work to what would've been a by-the-numbers action movie in the hands of anyone else.

The girl really is as good as some others wrote - believable, and you enjoy watching her, anticipating what she is going to do next and how she is going to act in the next situation, which are the marks of a good actor.

The superstars in this, Michael Douglas, Antonio Banderas, Ewan McGregor add to the overall quality.  Channing Tatum (from the dance flick ""Step Up"") great to see in a different role.

Casting her in a feature film where she's allowed to utilize her expertise and not much else is nothing short of a gimmick.  This project was fabricated solely to showcase her talent.  It was populated with no less than six ""names"" in bit parts to help give her and this film some credibility.  The story is paper thin and easily summed up in a single sentence with the tagline: why bother.

I was not impressed.
The problem with this film is that the person with the most screen time should have been allotted the least.  When Carano isn't beating the crap out of someone, the film stalls.  She has no charisma, no natural charm, she doesn't evoke mystery; she simply stands there and recites her lines by rote.  A lamppost could spark more interest.  It was annoying how little effort she put into the non-action sequences.  Not that she was entirely to blame; this movie was little more than a bunch of fight scenes strung together.  Nothing about this movie surprised me.  In the end, I was glad I checked it out of the library rather than waste any money on it.

The film also has decent characterization and an able supporting cast to see it through.  The film heralds a real star in Gina Carano.  Carano is as lithe as a cat and just as sexy.  With Carano's Mallory Kane, Zoe Saldana as Colombiana, and Anne Hathaway as Salina Kyle there's a real boom in female action stars.  Not classic but good popcorn entertainment.  I'm still puzzled by the film's ""R"" rating.  There is a certain degree of violence but it's mostly muted and not gratuitous.

4958986,4,B006512I7Q,"*Spoilers*

I have to agree with other viewers about Gina--she makes the fight scenes more realistic, but she's also pretty good as a foil to her male counterparts.

Also, the sound is way too dynamic (and/or hollow) on the bass end and covers up the dialogue which is too soft.

If you use your mind as an editing machine, you can remove all the flashbacks and run the film straight through and find the weak point.  We never hear the conversation with Kenneth that gets her to the diner where she instead meets Aaron.  All the other flashbacks fill in the motivation for the actions--especially the plot points that Kenneth reveals (in flashbacks) at the end of the movie (same like Soderbergh's Contagion where we cycle through the events that come to Patient Zero at the end of the film).  Yet, even if we would straighten out the film so that it ran with no flashbacks, it still has a problem.

Earlier, we hear Kenneth try to talk to Gina after she finishes off Paul, but no conversation.  Subsequently, a meeting with Kenneth somehow gets set up--with no conversation in flashback or anything.  Filling in that conversation would not solve the film's problem, though.

After you watch the film all the way through you find out that Kenneth thinks Gina is going to steal his clients and go off on her own.

Here's the weakness in the film:  Kenneth never confronts Gina about either their relationship that ended or the business relationship that he believes will end.  In fact, because their relationship isn't developed (where the flashbacks really belong), I have a hard time believing that either one had anything at stake.  The spine of the movie should have been Gina and Kenneth's love and biz relationship because that would have made the betrayal much stronger (and more mysterious for Gina).  You could even have a flashback for her dad warning her about Kenneth because she says he evidently did.

All the rigmarole with those other dudes is a distraction.  Kenneth betrays Gina because he suspects Gina will betray him, but that's never really developed.",1343260800,3,2072,4.791549295774648

I was amazed at the number of heavy hitter actors playing in this movie, but did find it interesting that they all changed their line delivery to match hers. This added to the slow feel to the film. I might have given it four stars for plot, but they never did wrap up dad's story line. Was he the real deal or just an author???

If you're looking for excellence in film making, writing, acting, and social commentary, you'll have a bad time. Gina Corano is of course the main draw of the movie. She actually does a good job acting; of course there's not a lot of depth to the character. Considering there are many actors out there that can make even a shallow character portrayal painful, it's refreshing that she does the job right.

The protagonist is played in a relatively realistic manner, she's not running around easily beating the hell out of guys much bigger than her, each fight she takes quite a beating--indeed, some scenes are almost uncomfortable as she's getting the tar knocked out of her.

That she has enough acting chops to make you think she isn't just appearing in an extended cameo is a compliment to her. And this is why this movie (mostly) works in its goal of being a good action thriller.

Her acting was spare, as someone else wrote, a sort of feminine Jason Statham. In other words, she knows her strengths and one of them isn't acting. She keeps the emotions spare and doesn't try to milk a scene which lets the movie flow.

Not a legendary thriller action flick, but a good one that is worth the rental for a night. Weaknesses are the rather scatter-shot collection of Big Names brought in somewhat randomly in an attempt to flesh out the very spare plot. Outside of Channing Tatum, I thought the rest of the Big Names were almost slumming their way through the film. I just didn't buy their emotional investment (Michael Douglas looked a bit faded for obvious reasons, Banderas and McGregor didn't seem committed and Fassbender didn't have enough to chew on in the script.)

But when the movie stops trying to justify itself and just gets to fighting and fury, it is at home and a fun time. This is a flick, not cine-mah.

Fortunately for the viewer, Mallory makes the improbable decision to tell her story to a random stranger whose car she steals while making one of her getaways from the people who are trying to kill her.

Apart from being hard to follow, the direction of Haywire is a little too gimmicky.  Choppy editing is intended to convey a sense of edginess.  Action scenes frequently shift between sepia-tinted frames, black-and-white frames, washed-out frames, and normal-colored frames.  I suppose it's interesting to watch but it's all been done before.  Steven Soderbergh has done it all before, and he's clearly capable of better things.

If you like chases, shootouts, and fistfights -- and who doesn't? -- Haywire has plenty to offer.  There are some wicked fight scenes that are enough to make the movie worth watching.

Black-ops agent Mallory Kane (Gina Carano) is double crossed and left for dead by her own agency in this Steven Soderbergh directed action thriller.

Video

Haywire was filmed with Red One cameras which results in an awesome picture that has remarkable clarity but I did notice that the picture got softer  in extremely bright scenes.  I am sure it stems from the fact  that the backdrops did not have any artificial light and relied solely on natural light. While the picture was soft in well-lit scenes it maintained a great deal of detail. Darker scenes seemed to be where the filmed shined best because a lot of small details became extremely clear.

Audio

Haywire was mastered with a DTS-HD 5.1 track  which made gunfire very immersive. In certain quiet scenes I did have to crank up the volume because the dialogue was extremely muffled. Most times the muffled dialogue came from Antonio Banderas so be aware of that if you are watching this film at low volume. The HD track did a great job with a lot of the close contact fight scenes since every impact resonated through the front and center speakers in my home theater. Punches and kicks did not come off as canned sounds like in a lot of films but had a genuine feel. Sound engineers did great work in that regard. One thing I noticed Soderbergh did often was use music in non dialogue scenes frequently which some may find annoying. I actually found the music complimented the fight scenes well.

Extras

Extras in this film were rather limited. I am not a big viewer of extras but one focused on Gina Carano's fight training and the other on the male leads (Channing Tatum, Antonio Banderas, Michael Fassbender, Michael Douglas, Bill Paxton and Ewan McGregor) that shared screen time with Gina Carano.

My Take

Haywire at first glance has the makings of an action classic but I felt let down after the credits rolled. Gina Carano minus her altered voice did a great job in her acting debut and had awesome chemistry with all the male leads. She had natural screen presence which is something very  fighters and pro wrestlers lack when they transition to acting. Fight choreography was the high point of this film due to the very close proximity of the camera during fights.  Carano did a great job making the fights look believable and showcased her MMA and Muay Thai background well.  The plot of the film though was very paint by numbers like most action thrillers which is something I did not expect from Steven Soderburgh after seeing his other work. The film ended abruptly and really failed to close out certain plot points which again considering the director was a big blemish.

Recommendation

Haywire is a solid action film that does not demand repeat viewing sadly. If you are a fan of Steven Soderburgh then you may want to check this out but I can't in good faith recommend this as a purchase if anything it's rental worthy at best.",1341532800,,2916,4.673189823874756

4959004,4,B006512I7Q,"I had sworn off Steven Soderbergh films after a couple of dreadful ""Ocean's"" movies and that paragon of self-indulgence ""Bubble"", so it's fortunate that I knew nothing about ""Haywire"" before I saw it. Soderbergh conceived the film as a vehicle for mixed martial arts fighter Gina Carano, who has an imposing combination of good looks, physicality, and charisma. Soderbergh filmed, directed, and edited the film, but he did not write it. That job went to Lem Dobbs, who gives us a storyline sufficiently convoluted that it gives the audience the impression it is watching a spy thriller. But this is basically a chase film, with a great cast, that showcases Gina Carano's charms and skills in a series of great hand-to-hand combat scenes.

Mallory Kane (Gina Carano) is on the run in the car of a young man named Scott (Michael Angarano), who happened to be available when she was attacked by ex-colleague Aaron (Channing Tatum). As she drives with injured arm, she tells Scott why and from whom she is running. It began in Barcelona, where Mallory was sent by her employer Kenneth (Ewan McGregor) to rescue a dissident journalist who had been kidnapped. All went well; the team split up and headed home. But experiences on her next  job in Dublin led Mallory to believe that she's being set up. Government agent Alex Coblenz (Michael Douglas), who contracts with her security firm, seems to know this but is more interested in discovering Kenneth's motives than in helping Mallory.

I admire the spareness of this film. ""Haywire"" is only 93 minutes long. No CGI. No explosions. Just running, fighting, a car chase, and some tantalizing scenes in which Mallory interacts with fellow contractors. They never trust one another. Female action heroines don't usually make much of an impression. The exceptions are Sigourney Weaver of the ""Alien"" franchise and Angelina Jolie, who has had moderate success as an action star. Both of those women are tall, with features striking enough to hold their own onscreen beside men and artillery. Gina Carano goes one better, as she is really a fighter. She does action in real life. I love the visceral quality of ""Haywire""s fights.

I especially love Mallory's fight in a cocktail dress. Usually when women get into physical altercations while wearing a skirt in a movie, it's preposterous. But Mallory kicks off her heels, the dress tears at the seam, her pantyhose run, while she beats the stuffing out of someone. It's down and dirty and glamorous too. -Though I was moved to some pity for the men; the actors must have been black and blue from head to toe. There were no stunt doubles. ""Haywire"" is an exercise in style. There is not much plot. The device by which Mallory recounts the story to Scott, so that we enter midway in the narrative, is clumsy. But ""Haywire"" is seductive and energetic, and that is all one asks of an action flick.

The DVD (LionsGate 2012): There are two featurettes. ""Gina Carano in Training"" (16 min) interviews Jamie Levine of World Extreme Fighting, Stephen Soderbergh, some of the cast, Special Ops technical advisor Aaron Cohen, fight choreographer J J Perry, and Gina Carano about the conception of the film, preparation, and behind-the-scenes insight into the three main fight scenes. ""The Men of Haywire"" (5 min) interviews Michael Fassbender, Ewan McGregor, Antonio Banderas, and Channing Tatum about what attracted them to the project and working/fighting with Carano.

4959006,5,B006512I7Q,"Spy flicks are usually a mixed bag, some good, some great, some ok and some just plain awful, usually if a good cast and director are involved more often than not they fall under the great or at least good category. ""Haywire"" has director Steven Soderbergh (""Traffic"" and ""Ocean's Eleven"") at the helm who brings his talents to an otherwise typical story of a black-ops agent named Mallory (Gina Carano, Former MMA Star) who rescues a hostage and is given a job that leads to her being (gasp) betrayed by someone close to her.

So naturally she must fight back and use her training and skills to find out who betrayed her and well take them out for lack of a better word. Since this is her first major film role, its good that Soderbergh put together an all-star supporting cast with her. Among them are Ewan McGregor (The new ""Star Wars"" Trilogy), Antonio Banderas (""The Mask of Zorro"" and ""Shrek 2""), Bill Paxton (""Twister"" & ""Frailty""), Michael Douglas (""Basic Instinct"" & ""The Sentinel"") and others really add some pep to this flick.

The music by David Holmes also really fits the movie, its stylish and really soothing and also jolting when it has to be but it doesn't overpower the movie. The story while simple is well done thanks to the layered cast, the previously mentioned music, Soderbergh's direction and to me Carano shines here as she's not given way too much to do but looks equal parts tough and very, very beautiful. I literally couldn't take my eyes off of her throughout the movie.

4959015,5,B006512I7Q,"I'm pretty shocked at the mixed response this movie has gotten. I just watched it and was wowed, but looks like it's not everyone's cup of tea, at least here on Amazon. All I can say is that, in addition to the raw, kickass fight scenes, the characters are quite deep and compelling, especially given how little time is permitted to sketch some of them within the confines of a fast-moving spy flick.

Soderbergh is definitely a hit-or-miss director, and this one definitely has some of the usual trappings of his other movies. But to me, Haywire is a dead-on hit, and the Soderbergh cliches that are present (music by the always-funky David Holmes, quick, jargon-heavy, almost-noir dialogue by uber-attractive leads, a sense of seriousness that flirts with self-parody) are quite welcome b/c they're handled so well. To me, Haywire came across like a return to his roots, much more similar to the tightly-tuned and quietly powerful ""Out of Sight"" than to some of his later, more far/over-reaching efforts.

Perhaps most surprising, I thought athlete Gina Carano was terrific as an actress -- imposing but still vulnerable, witty, and just very real (and smokin' hot, of course). And between this and 21 Jump Street, Channing Tatum is turning into quite a promising star. And all the other amazing, established A-list actors are as consistently great as always without overwhelming the movie with star power; what a cast!

So definitely give this one a try if you like smart, raw action flix, you won't regret it. And yes, the plot and dialogue are twisty, but to me that just makes them more authentic-sounding, even if I had to rewatch the movie to catch all the nuances.",1340064000,4,1673,4.863157894736842

The fight scenes are excellent, and Gina Carano has the makings of a real action star.  The plot was fairly well put together, and the cast was terrific.  I really would like to see her in some more of these types of films.  Maybe a series is in store for ""Mallory Kane""

Her voice is flat and untrained, but that makes her even more interesting.  She's a natural actress.  Lots of big talented actors surrounding her.

That alone was worth the price of admission. It was one of the best theatrical fight scenes to come along in years. But then you have the Barcelona fight which consisted of a drawn out footchase followed by a few seconds of grappling. Carano is inexplicably given less credit than she deserves. She did alright acting wise. There were just a couple of times when her ""don't mess with me"" stare resembled a ""what's that smell?"" look. There's a fine line between the two.

At first I thought I was watching the set up for an action movie.  Then It went into a spy movie, then it tried to end being an action movie.

This movie also tried to be Pulp Fiction where they show the movie happening all out of order, and it was just stupid.

Also what was the point?  Why did they want her dead?  On top of that we didn't get to see the ending of the movie.  She just dropped on the guy's patio and he's all like, ""Oh my god!""

It may work when he used the exact same thing in Oceans 11 but it doesn't fit and failed miserably when using during tense chase scenes.

The second big fail was his lead choice.  While this girl clearly has the looks and athletics to carry something like this, she didn't quite pull it off.  Carano is nice to look at but she lacked dept during the few chances for her character to show any emotion.  They had to fall back on a flash back to an earlier scene in the movie to give some exposition on what her character is feeling - never a good sign.

Then I come on here to re-rent Haywire (because it was that good) and see all the bad reviews.

What's WRONG with people?!

I originally saw this movie (in the theater) because Ewan McGregor (who I love) was in it... but MAN, the lead woman was AMAZING! She blew Ewan away!!

I just really really loved this movie. It reminded me a bit of Kill Bill (which I also loved). FULL of action and a little bit of humor too. If you like intelligent action movies that kick ass... I highly recommend.",1338249600,13,783,4.386206896551724

It has some moments reminiscent of Ocean's 11; you can tell that this film was lovingly crafted when it came to the soundtrack, scenery, editing, and all the other little things that take a movie from good to excellent. The story was compelling and very clever. It's a smart movie. You have to do a little work to put the pieces together, but it's worth it and makes it that much more enjoyable.

What I loved most is that the actress who plays Mallory, the protagonist, looks like a REAL secret agent would look--muscular curves, practical clothes, minimal makeup. There's a great scene of her relaxing while cleaning her gun and drinking a glass of wine with her hair tied up in a scarf. That's me every night (sub out the gun for a book though, lol)! Moreover, Mallory gets the job done without heavy reliance on her sex appeal although she definitely has it. When she gets down to business she's kicking butt in boots, not running around flailing wildly on five inch heels. The supporting cast is great as well, and it's wonderful to see a movie where men regard the female character as their equal (or better) without trying to put her in her place.

Gina Carano more than holds her place among more seasoned actors. She really lights up the screen and I hope to see her in more films.",1338163200,4,1377,4.4603174603174605

Independent operator and ex-Marine Mallory Kane played by Gina Carano has been double-crossed him set up. But who could've done it? A friend? Her employer? His employer? Or some other obscure character in the story?

Time is running out all the authorities are after her and she must still be the goat on the stick until they find out who the bad guys are. Of course she's really the lion and no one's going to put her on a stick.

I suggest that if you really do like these chemistries that you do not miss this vintage version titled ""Three Days of the Condor"" with Robert Redford.

4959066,5,B006512I7Q,"Holy Smokes! Yahoo!

I was somewhat familiar with Gina Carano prior to her film debut and it was already well known she had that unusual combination of being seriously hot in addition to being a serious badass. But this - this is something altogether new. Something amazing.

What anorexic Angelina was attempting to capture in her film 'Salt' - Gina actually accomplished in 'Haywire'; profiling the life of a genuine female spec operator. No wires, no cinematic camera tricks, no politically correct faux-empowerment b.s. This is sheer power and a lifetime of martial arts training packaged into a stunning shell of female beauty. A full-on bleeping medieval babe. Hot damn! :-D

I can remember when Cynthia Rothrock was the kickass-chick-du-jour of her time and she did an okay job of carrying the titular role of ""Baddest Babe On The Planet"". But Gina, whooboy, she's taken that to a completely new level!

In this fun action-packed film, Gina plays former Marine and current independent contractor Molly Kane. A hardcore and disciplined warrior whose services are in demand for the same reason that real-life female operators are sought out - that very rare combination of brains, skills and sexuality. Her current assignment: Rescue a kidnapping victim.

But is the job what it appears?

A well-trod action/adventure made completely fresh by Ms. Carano and her exquisite confluence of bone crushing devastation and sensual lethality. Her wicked beauty and monster skills really drive this well beyond your typical action flick.

Altogether fantastic and highly enjoyable - one that I have already purchased for repeat screenings.

My fear is that she might have started in films too late. Not sure how long her looks can last in comparison to the types of roles she might take on. But I'm not betting against her.

I'm also hoping that Soderbergh considers doing a trilogy - making up to us for his mishandling of the Ocean's trilogy. Would pay big bucks to see another Molly ""Hatchet"" Kane film.

The only complaint I have is very minor. In the scene when Coblenz, played by Michael Douglas, meets Molly for the first time, he's accompanied by bodyguards that would better suited protecting some silly reality tv starlet. The lack of professionalism shown - they're standing by with their hands in their pockets - is disturbing to say the least and sincerely dangerous at the worst.

There is a LOT of talking during this movie, which is perhaps why some people don't care for it. An incredible amount of dialogue to develop the story.  Me? I love a good action movie, but if there's no story to drive the action, it becomes very boring.

It has an awesome cast, and Gina Carano is incredible in it, but there were a lot of scenes that just...needed something.
The fight scenes, while well choreographed (I know that she's an MMA fighter and an excellent athlete, but she still makes it all look so easy), needed some music or better sound effects to emphasize the urgency of the fights.  They looked really cool, but they just weren't as exciting as they should have been.  They needed an additional something to draw me into the moment.
Another element that could use some work was the music.  For some reason, while watching this, I was reminded of a 70's cop show, and it ended up just feeling a bit out of place, since the movie takes place in a modern day setting.

4959098,4,B006512I7Q,"Generally, it is not my style to offer an opinion on a film with a large number of reviews, however, the large number of 1* & 2* reviews are compelling me to comment.

""Hit me Harder"" was an actual conversation that Gina Carano had with her co-star Ewan McGregor.  I believe that he either broke or severely strained his hand hitting her.

I happen to like the Soderbergh style.  This is not about taking an actor and trying to make her into an action star (a la Angelina).  This is about taking 140lb MMA fighter Gina Carano and building an action movie around her with a side effect of her sometimes looking sexy as hell!

I really liked the action scenes in this film and thought that Gina did a credible job.  I heard a rumor that she will be joining the hugely successful ""Fast and Furious"" franchise for the next offering.",1336953600,11,828,4.407894736842105
4959099,3,B006512I7Q,"It seems that we've never had a female version of the James Bond character. Certainly Bond has had his share of femme fatales but never has one taken the lead role in a film. The closest we've had in the past was Cynthia Rothrock who starred in a series of martial arts films, but those were always B movie quality. That all changes with HAYWIRE.

MMA star Gina Carano starts as Mallory Kane, an operative for a private group that hires out to the likes of the CIA. An ex-Marine, Mallory is more tomboy than girly girl. As the film opens she makes her way to a diner where she meets up with Aaron (Channing Tatum), a fellow operative sent to bring her in. When she refuses the first of many well choreographed fight sequences begins. Mallory escapes and is on the run with a young man from the diner in tow. As they speed off she begins to tell him her tale.

It all went sour with a job in Barcelona. Mallory's boss Kenneth (Ewan McGregor) has sent her out at the request of Coblenz (Michael Douglas), the head of a secret government agency one would assume is the CIA, and fellow spymaster Rodrigo (Antonio Banderas). It should be a simple snatch and grab, rescuing a hostage and taking him home. When one of the guards for the hostage takes off, Mallory chases him down resulting in another well choreographed fight sequence.

Home after the run Mallory finds Kenneth waiting for her and asking her to do one more job before some well earned time off. This time the job takes her to Ireland where she is to meet up with a member of MI-6 named Paul (Michael Fassbender). At a party hosted by some big wig, Mallory wanders around and discovers the hostage from the Barcelona affair with a bullet in his head. Something seems wrong which becomes painfully obvious when Paul tries to kill Mallory when they return to their hotel room. He doesn't succeed.

Traveling home with the intent of revenge, Mallory has ended where we found her at the beginning of the film. Just who she can and can not trust is in question. The only person she does is her father, an ex-military man himself (played by Bill Paxton). When a hit squad with Kenneth shows there the chances of their survival are slim even though they exude confidence. How the film finishes, just who was it that was behind all the skullduggery and who will pay make for a fine film.

Directed by Steven Soderbergh this is not his usual style of film. This outing into the world of action adventure shows he is quite capable. While not quite up to par with the Bourne films, the movie does take its action sequences seriously and shoots them in the way they should be shot, with the camera back a way so we can actually watch the fight scenes rather than in the middle looking for close ups.

The story is well written and thought out though it takes a while to get to the bottom of things. Perhaps more clues along the way would have upped the ante here, but as it is the movie still tells a compelling story.

The movie seems made for Carano, forming around her and her incredible fighting skills, showing them off as best as they can. One would think that her acting ability would be lacking but she demonstrates an ability to do better than most real life action stars pushed into the world of film. Her character does offer a rather stoic look more often than not, but for a first feature role she does outstanding. Future films will tell if she can get the acting chops she needs or not.

For an action film the action must be non-stop and well thought out. It must be paced at regular intervals and those scenes must work well within the story. That is done here in spades. It also must feature someone who can handle the action as well as co-stars who can do the same. That's also well done here, including having Fassbender do his own stunts in the fight sequence he performs with Carano. It all results in a fast paced, well made action film that's worth your rental fee.",1336953600,2,3936,4.419310344827586

So I have watched it twice and thought Gina did an absolutely perfect job. She holds her own with all the other established actors in the film. Gina is the best female action hero I have seen in years. I think she is just stunning to watch and very natural. So many times actors feel they have to play their role so over the top. Even the best male action stars in movie after movie, get pretty hokie from time to time. The continuity and crediblilty of the action was right on. I love the little nuances that Gina brought to the fight scenes. It is very obvious this girl is a scrapper in real life. If I ever need to be rescued, I hope they send Mallory Kane. I would highly recommend this film and am very much looking forward to Gina's next action movie. I only have two things to criticise. One it wasn't long enough and two the music track was mixed too high for the dialoque in the beginning few minutes of the movie. I liked it so much I bought the DVD.

4959106,1,B006512I7Q,"(1.) Most of the movie didn't make any sense and it required the final scenes to piece it all together. The ""Let's make it jump all over the place confusing."" technique is to show how intelligent the writer and director are while keeping the audience guessing about what's going on for as long as possible. Poorly thought out e.g. in the beginning she's doesn't take or disable her pursuer's car so that he can't chase her but grab's some stranger and his car. The rest of the movie was typical Hollywood actors making dumb decisions courtesy of writers who lead sheltered lives.
(2.) Production: Dialogue had a low quality echoey sound. Background music was a loud, overbearing and aggravating. A cheap substitute to compensate for poor storyline. Cinematography and camera settings such as color palette looked washed out with a greenish tone.
(3.) Self indulgent editing and directing. Two examples: A foot chase scene and later a fight scene each utilized between six and ten different camera angles while annoyingly constantly switching amongst the angles. Viewing from the bottom, top, sides all looked artificial and was a pointless distraction. Also nauseating.
(4.) Acting was of the type where you sign up a few big names (they agree because they had nothing to do for a day and it's good money); the resulting  commitment to naturalism is to read lines like actors portraying actors.  Also looked non-commital and artificial.
(5.) A rip off of the ""Girl with ..."" and ""Girl Who ..."" ""Kick-Ass"", ""Hanna"" movies with Carano in ""Haywire"" as Mallory Kane and was not at all convincing, especially in comparison to Rapace, Moretz, Ronan in their roles. The problem is not so much in whether Carano knows her kicks and punches but in the editing and filming where people dramatically start falling before they're hit and her not emotionally conveying an interesting, believable character.",1336867200,5,1893,5.025477707006369

There was danger, but with a jazz track running underneath the action - the danger had no teeth.  With a name like Haywire, one would expect some crazy action scenes and a lot of blood, but this was just so... tame.  And calm and dull.

4959108,1,B006512I7Q,"I had seen the trailer for this movie and thought it looked rather compelling, so I was eager to rent it when it became available in the local Red Box rental machine.  Before I had actually watched it, my daughter saw the DVD and mentioned that she had seen the movie in the theater and that it was disappointing.  I told her about the trailer, and she said it contained the best two minutes of the entire movie.  It turns out her assessment was entirely accurate.

I had a sneaking suspicion that the movie was going to be a total dud after viewing it for only about five minutes.  The longer I watched it, the more my suspicion was confirmed.  This movie is the kind you keep watching because you hope it's going to pick up its pace, but that never happened. I finally just shut the movie off after about 50 minutes.  Even though there were only about 40 minutes remaining, and even though I could have invested the remaining time to at least see how things ended, I just didn't care anymore. It was really that bad.

To give you an idea of the movie's content, the movie opens with a scene in a diner where Mallory Kane (Gina Carano) and Aaron (Channing Tatum) end up fighting. Aaron is totally pummeling the hell out of Mallory, but in a manner taken straight out of the old Channel 47 wrestling matches of the 1970s, even though Mallory should have been knocked out (or killed) several times, there is a miraculous reversal in the action, and she ends up dominating Aaron and subduing him.  What then follows are 40 minutes of slow-moving scenes, pointless filler, flash-backs that seem like they might be from a different movie or storyline, bland dialogue, and a totally awful soundtrack.  There is eventually another fight scene between Mallory and Paul (Michael Fassbender), and it's the same I-almost-kill-you-but-you-miraculously-manage-to-turn-the-tables kind of fight.  It was just ridiculous, and it utterly strained credulity.

Even though there are some big names in this movie, it just isn't worth your time, and it certainly isn't worth your money.  If you feel compelled to see it, do yourself a favor and rent it first to see what I mean. I am usually pretty forgiving when watching movies, and I am willing to forgo things like character development and plot for good special effects and action, but this movie cannot claim credit for any of these things.

No, it was the script's fault, primarily, followed by the directing. The film just didn't have much of a story to tell: at least, not one we hadn't already seen five hundred million times before. Character development was inadequate, too; Carano's character is a cipher.

4959122,3,B006512I7Q,"Steven Soderbergh, considered quite the indie auteur with films like sex, lies and videotape, KAFKA, THE LIMEY and THE UNDERNEATH has also side-stepped that for the bright lights and big fun of studio filmmaking, and surprisingly, he's quite good at it. His work on the OCEAN's trilogy and TRAFFIC is proof of that. But then he'll go back and do films like FULL FRONTAL and THE GIRLFRIEND EXPERIMENT. After that, he'll return to Hollywood and do the big cast outbreak disaster film CONTAGION. But this film here, HAYWIRE, is kind of in-between his Hollywood and his indie sensibilities. And in Soderbergh's pursuit to do a film in every type of genre, he has taken it upon himself to make a spy actioner with former American Gladiator and MMA fighter Gina Carano as his muse and his lead amongst a cast that boasts Ewan MacGregor, Michael Douglas, Antonio Banderas, Channing Tatum, Bill Paxton and Michael Fassbender.

The plot is pretty rote: Mallory Kane (Carano) is former CIA-turned-independent-contractor. She has been double-crossed by her boss, Kenneth (MacGregor) and is on the run. She intends to return the favor in kind. Along the way, there are some pretty spectacular hand-to-hand fight sequences, some fun little chases and a plot twist or two. It's not the type of film you haven't seen before a hundred times, and there's the pity.

Soderbergh and his occasional partner-in-crime screenwriter Lem Dobbs did a fantastic job subverting the crime drama a bit with THE LIMEY, and they could have used some of that same energy and smarts added to this film's interal workings. Instead, they decided to go with the same old, same old.

Gina Carano is quite striking (in a number of ways) and is a talented actress. I hope that she's able to get more starring work, but I said the same thing about Zoe Bell from Tarantino's DEATH-PROOF and that hasn't happened yet. The rest of the ensemble don't really have a whole lot to do, but they all put themselves into it. Nothing feels particularly phoned in. MacGregor is a coward, Douglas is powerful, Tatum is conflicted, Fassbender is charming, Banderas is duplicitous, and Paxton is paternal. That's really all they needed for this film.

The most important thing about HAYWIRE is that it's Soderbergh's chance to make a low-budget but globe-trotting actioner and also to bring someone like Carano into the cinema firmament, and it's fun and goofily serious, but it's nothing that will stay with you for a long time.",1336521600,2,2473,4.909090909090909

4959136,3,B006512I7Q,"Don't get me wrong. This is definately a good movie that has its many moments. The use of Gina Carano in this film was brilliance. She's a good actress and a phenomenal fighter. Not to mention, she's a phenomenal fight/actor as well. In fact, ""HAYWIRE"" has tremendous action scenes and tremendous fight scenes. The movie as a whole though, has many problems.

Carano, rooted in Mixed Martial arts, is new to acting, but this movie alone proves that she has a career in it. She holds her own and she is far from the problem with this film. She is exactly what she is supposed to be in this film, a top secret operative named Mallory Kane who lives for the job and is such a force to be reconed with that even the men in her business don't want to mess with her. Many of her scenes are just plain action movie eye candy, and I'm not talking about her beauty. There is a fight in a hotel room, a scene where she is fleeing from heavily armed police men and a scene where she is pinned down on a snowy road in the middle of the woods and many more.

These are all great scenes, but the movie as a whole just doesn't have any meat to it. When a movie can be explained by simply calling it a ""revenge flick"". It's too simple. Especially these days. That's what it is. No more needs to be said. It isn't enough to have a bunch of cool action scenes thrown together for the purpose of serving one objective. Audiences are too smart these days and the actors in this film (McGregor, Douglas, Banderas, Fassbender, Carano & 'yes' even Tatum) are better than this.

After watching Carano participate in many hand to hand fight scenes to go through her objective, which were all cool, It began to get tiresome. We know that Carano can fight and fight/act, but on one of her ""revenge"" scenes, instead of taking care of something quickly and steathly, we have to endure another unnecessary fist fight. As good as she is 'supposed to be', I would think a long unnecessary exchange of fists would be frowned upon if unavoidable. This, to me, is a perfect example of the lack of creativity from the filmmakers and Soderbergh.

A cool movie that will fall into the forgettable pile by no fault of the actors involved or the fight choreographers.",1336435200,,2227,4.398058252427185

4959139,4,B006512I7Q,"Steven Soderbergh doesn't always make critically acclaimed movies; yet, he remains a critical darling.  I think it's because he takes chances with his films.  He's willing to try his hand at new genres and to push at the boundaries of those genres.

Haywire, at its core, is a straightforward revenge-driven action thriller.  Mallory Kane (Gina Carano) did a job in Barcelona.  Shortly after, she finds herself betrayed by her agency and pursued by assassins.  But the movie begins after that, with Mallory's first contact post-betrayal with former coworker Aaron (Channing Tatum).  The Barcelona and Dublin jobs fold out in flashbacks.

There are moments when Haywire shines.  The script is lean, allowing the images to carry the story.  Most of the action unfolds wordlessly to a jazzy electronic score by David Holmes.  At Haywire's release, critics made a big to do over a female action star who looked like she could actually carry out the action.  Now, Carano did her time as an MMA fighter.  She's got muscle, and it shows, especially in the rare scene where her bare arms make an appearance.  But she's not particularly Amazonian.  Her muscle is more toned than bulky.  But Carano carries the physicality of the movie wonderfully.  She can do her own stunts and the choreography is quite wonderful.

Carano's acting is not up to par with her stuntwork.  She does good at playing cold, which is necessary for most of the film, but she's less convincing when having a touching moment with her father.  The role of Mallory suits Carano well, and she might certainly have a future as an action star.  Most of the acting is carried off by the very able supporting cast, which includes Michael Fassbender and Michael Douglas.  I adore Ewan McGregor, but his Kenneth didn't always work for me.  (It may be because I associate blond Ewan McGregor with&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/I-Love-You-Phillip-Morris/dp/B002ZG9800/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">I Love You Phillip Morris</a>&nbsp;and thus think blond Ewan McGregor is the sweetest thing ever.)

As much as I loved the flashbacks, the framing was somewhat awkward.  Mallory explains her story to a preternaturally calm kid.  I'm not blaming the actor.  It was a strange part, and it's for the best that the end of Haywire forgets that he ever existed.

If you like action movies or any of the actors involved, I'd buy or rent Haywire.  It delivers heavily on stylish, brutal, and realistic action.  The story isn't ridiculously stupid and the long interlude with Mallory and Paul (Fassbender) is delightfully tense.  But don't go in expecting more than a fun movie.  Being slightly more clever than the average thriller does not a masterpiece make.",1336348800,,2746,5.184510250569476

I also loved the supporting cast in this movie as well. So why do I have a problem. First fire the guy who picked the music for this movie. The music sucks balls omg did a proper lady like my self say that. Yes I did because that is how much I disliked the music that I risked my proper lady like self to write something my boy friend would say. You don't take an action movie and add weird creepy 70's music to it.

They took a potentially good movie and some how messed it up. First you don't know why anything is happening so instead of getting intrigue somehow you get confused which causes the movie to get boring it does not keep you engaged(plus your mind is trying to escape the weird music so you fall asleep lol) Since, you don't know what the heck happens or why as if some how the purpose got lost somewhere. You don't get engaged like you do with Bourne identity. I only mention that because while you don't know what happens in that movie in the beginning your engaged because the character has purpose he needs to find out who he is. with this movie you don't get to know who your protagonist is and so the movie gets lost somehow.

The fight scenes were nailed an awesome really done well and Gina is likable. Something went wrong in this movie and I hope they correct it because would love to see Gina come back with her in the lead or even a second but this time well done hay wire 2 this time get the director of the Avengers(Joss Whedon) he understands what we need when it comes to action Hero's. Gina ask Joss Whedon to Direct your next move you won't be disappointed and your stardom will be Born.

However, as an action Hero lover I still saw this movie for a second time just because I love me some Gina kickass action even if I had to endure some sleepy time. Please please Joss save Gina and Direct one of her next movies as long as your the writer Joss you can help her.

While the stars like Michael Douglas, etc. only really have cameo roles, it's Gina's performance that you're here to see.

4959153,3,B006512I7Q,"This movie was definitely mediocre at best. It's really a shame, because it's possible Miss Carano won't get more opportunities like this one, and I think she should. I seriously wouldn't place the blame on Gina Carano for the fact that this movie doesn't really work. As surprising as it might sound, considering the caliber of the other actors and the director's credentials, she's really the only thing that makes this movie worth watching.

Certainly her acting wasn't very good, but this is her first big-budget leading role, and she's aspiring to be an action star, not an Oscar- or Tony-winning Shakespearean actress. I think she was really let down in terms of her acting by the direction and writing in this movie, and that's really where the problem was overall. The director's style just didn't work in this context. He created a very odd mix between the story scenes and the action and chase scenes that felt uneven and jarring throughout, and not in a positive way. I didn't mind the tendency towards visual exposition, but mixing that with deadpan action movie one-liners and some stark and unemotional violence just made it seem like Gina was a worse actress than she really was. The writing was genuinely cringe-worthy in certain parts...There was really nothing any of the actors could have done with some of those lines.

The fight scenes in the movie didn't really work because the choreography and timing (editing) was poor...I'm not sure if Gina choreographed her own fights or if someone else did who was completely in awe of her real-life skills, but it just didn't translate well to the big screen. Combining that with the director's decision to try and create a more visceral feel by removing any music and just displaying the fights exactly as they were, and you end up with all the fight scenes looking odd at best, and downright fake at worst. Sometimes you have to do things a bit less realistically on film to make it look real, if that makes sense. It's pretty much impossible for a magician to pull off a trick if the camera is trained on his hands the whole time. I guess I can understand that the director wanted to put her real-life skills on display...but I think the movie, and Gina Carano, would have been much better served with some really solid movie fight choreography. She has the presence and look of someone who can kick your ass, and it would sell good movie fight scenes without any trouble at all.

I sincerely hope she's given more opportunities as the lead in movies. She definitely has an unapologetic power and can be quite intimidating, and I think that's far too rare in female movie stars. She's a very welcome breath of fresh air from the sickly waifs that we are normally expected to take seriously when they are throwing people around or punching out 250-pound men. She undeniably hot, and at the same time it's easy to take her seriously. I'll go see any movie in which she stars, simply because I really would like to see more leading women like her in action movies. She's just all-around awesome. I have no doubt she'll develop enough acting chops to make legitimately great action movies, if she can work with directors and writers that don't drop the ball like they did with this movie.",1336176000,,3250,4.708260105448154
4959154,3,B006512I7Q,"Okay, okay I admit I did a bad thing by missing this movie when it was in theaters. I've watched Gina Carano in many Mixed Martial Arts events and always thought she would translate well in a movie as a kick-ass agent of destruction. We were teased by her cameo appearance in 2009's B-classic Blood and Bone as a street fighter. Tell me when she gave Isaiah Bone (main: Michael Jai White) her number- you weren't hoping she'd be seen again.

And so, when a trailer emerges that shows Gina Carano doing the CIA-MMA combat style, you have to get amped. The trailer also showed Michael Douglas so you felt that the good acting was going to be handled by an able veteran. Add Ewan McGregor and Antonio Banderas and you have a can't-miss bundle. Well it has just arrived on rental and DVD so now I'm getting my chance to see Gina in action.

Plot Ploddings

At about the 36 minute mark I realized I had no idea what was going on, why and who any of the characters were. I had to check myself to see if I had checked out and stopped paying attention and missed some clues. No, it's one of those movies where they leave it blurry and bring it into focus at the very end, which doesn't quite make sense since the overall plot is as simple as it seemed in the trailer: super agent is double-crossed and sets out on a mission to find out why and at the same time - seek revenge. It doesn't work to keep us in the dark about something we already knew walking in.

Cut to the chase
Let's get to the action and choreography since that's supposed to be the meat of this flick.  In true fanboy service, you will get to see Gina Carano as freelance agent Mallory Kane pull off several bread and butter MMA moves- including the triangle, Muay Thai leg kicks and the superman punch. The only problem is; all the best moments are pretty much shown in the trailers. The early scenes are well edited and frenetic enough to warrant the name haywire, but later they begin to feel like set ups. It's as if the director looked at the clock and figured it was time for a mini-fight scene and placed the characters in, oh just enough peril to have a quick fight. By the time the climatic confrontation (Which you won't know is going down until the credits roll) occurs you'll be hoping you can see something different. Unfortunately the action plays out the same as the first fight and only the quick jump-cuts make the fight seem any different.

Sometimes it feels like I've slipped from watching an action movie to watching an action reel meant to prove Gina Carano is a great action-hero fit. We have long shots of her running (for almost no damn reason), which proves she can run and look cool [like James Bond] and we have her in several outfits showing off her curves. She is also allowed to play it sexy, aloof and cool in a few quiet moments. Her action-acting resume is accepted. In much the same style as Hanna (2011 main: Saoirse Ronan) there are several scenes set to music as if we are watching a music video. And that's another bothersome point. It feels as if director Steven Soderbergh (Ocean's Eleven, Traffic, Erin Brockovich and Solaris +) was more concerned with getting a cool shot and placing the camera in an interesting place than following any kind of logical course of action for our heroine to take. To his credit, he may be a saving factor because removing those cool camera angles might have left some scenes looking very boring and plain. I mean, she's jumping over roof tops, but with no real sense of danger and no discernable reason to be doing so. She's not exactly trapped and the pursuing baddies aren't even sure where she is. So what's she doing besides looking awesome?

In the end, I feel the whole is not equal to the sum of its parts. You have many underutilized, bankable actors, a great physical actress and a plot as simple as it gets. Sure there are scenes with creative camera work. Sure there are moments when MMA-lovers can cheer at the screen and call out the techniques being used, but overall this movie represents a first step in what I hope is the budding film career of Gina Carano. I can easily see her as a Bond villainess or arch nemesis in the next Charlie's Angels. Although our heroine says early in the film that she doesn't like loose ends, this movie leaves us with a lot of loose ends. Hopefully, action superstar Gina Carano gets a chance to tie them up in her next movie role. Worth renting, not owning.

4959163,2,B006512I7Q,"Once again we must ask how a cast as fine as the one assembled for this mess of a movie signed on to be associated with it.  Surely there must be a reason because if they had read the script (which could have been more than two or three pages of lines in length!) they would have seen that there is no plot to speak of - just a series of poorly executed incidents, each they response to a newly identified character whose background is so ignored that we are left without a clue as to how the characters are interrelated. Lem Dobbs is credited as `writer' and the big surprise is that this is a product of Steven Soderbergh's direction.

The plot is summarized as follows: `Beautiful freelance covert operative Mallory Kane (Gina Carano) is hired out by her handler to various global entities to perform jobs which governments can't authorize and heads of state would rather not know about. After a mission to rescue a hostage in Barcelona, Mallory is quickly dispatched on another mission to Dublin. When the operation goes awry and Mallory finds she has been double crossed, she needs to use all of her skills, tricks and abilities to escape an international manhunt, make it back to the United States, protect her family, and exact revenge on those that have betrayed her.'

The supporting cast, most of the characters are so ambiguous that we forget their names, is carried out by such fine actors as Michael Angarano, Channing Tatum, Michael Douglas, Antonio Banderas, Ewan McGregor, Michael Fassbender, Bill Paxton, Maximino Arciniega, and some other very talented but misused actors.  Even the special effects are poorly executed.  Apparently this film was created to feature the MMA (that's Mixed Martial Arts for those who don't follow sports) champion Gina Cardona. An actress she is not.  Pass.  Grady Harp, May 12",1336003200,12,1825,4.81150159744409

4959165,3,B006512I7Q,"I see all these REALLY bad reviews of this movie and after reading them I think they are being a little unfair.  So here's the thing, it does have its problems. Story elements are unclear at times and I would have liked to see more of the main character discovering things for herself rather than tracking guys down and being told what was going on.  But it does have some very good things going for it.  Unlike many spy and action movies made recently it moves very quickly and is well edited (it has to, it is only an hour and a half, gasp! An hour and a half movie? These days?!) I thought Mallory was a very wooden character and that this Carano person could have used some acting lessons.  But then I watched the special features because I was bored, and that was what really made this movie better for me. It turns out Gina Carano is a lady cage fighter! I didn't even know there was such a thing.  The director was inspired to make this movie after seeing her fight on TV.  So that is why her acting isn't that great, she isn't an actress. But her fighting was amazing, and it was very refreshing to see the actress do the fighting and not a stunt double.  Also, Carano is this fascinating balance of pretty and buff.  Too often I see movies where I just can't believe that a skinny 110 pound actress is throwing big guys around.  I was a big Alias fan but I always had to smile at the fight scenes because I just didn't believe Garner could really do what she was doing. But Carano is 145 pounds of kick-ass.  She looks really strong but she still looks like she has maintained a normal female body fat ratio. In a world where female action stars are either too dainty to be believable or are so masculine that they are not fun to watch it is refreshing to see Carano take off her high heels and kick butt in a dress.  If she gets some acting lessons she could do really well. I hope to see more of her.  So, if you are in the mood for some refreshing fighting and a more artsy edited movie, don't listen to the bad reviews, go ahead and give it a watch.",1336003200,5,2062,4.179292929292929
4959166,3,B006512I7Q,"There is some good and not so good about this movie that made me sit back and think about it before writing a review.

The Good
- Gina Carano. She is attractive and plays a leading role as a tough girl. When Angelina Jolie did it she was acting. Gina Carano can most likely really kick your ass. It was nice to see her play the kind of role usually held by guys and it really made her more attractive as the movie played out.
- There are quite a few well known actors in the movie, which was a little surprising.
- Gina's fight scenes. You could tell she knows what she is doing so her part of the fighting was more realistic.
- I personally didn't think Gina's acting was bad. Some people have a problem with it, but she did decent considering shes a MMA fighter and not an actor.

The Bad
- The fight scenes. Outside of Gina herself the fights were a mixed bag. It was occasionally kind of obvious it was fake because the person she was fighting cant operate at her level, like the fight with Ewan Mcgregor, though the fights with Channing Tatum and Michael Fassbender were decent. For a movie billed as an action movie there also was not that much action which was disappointing.
- The overall story was kind of dull. It really sort of left me saying is this it? The viewers were not really given a reason to care.
- The ending. I really didn't like it. It felt like the last 15 minutes of the movie that should have been there were suddenly cut off.

Overall this is an average movie, and there are both good and bad areas to it. If you go into the movie just looking for a popcorn flick and some action then you will most likely be satisfied. Haywire is definitely worth renting, but I wouldn't buy it.",1336003200,3,1707,4.2140672782874615
4959167,4,B006512I7Q,"Gina Carano plays an agent working for a private contractor who really kicks butt when she finds out she's been betrayed. The first action scene in the diner is shocking at first, the viewer is alarmed that a woman is being brutalized in such force in public with just a couple feeble attempts to help by the other patrons...but keep watching and you'll see she's not going to take it! She returns the brutality in triple force. Michael Fassbender and Ewen McGregor are favorites of mine and I also enjoyed their performance. In my opinion, the movie slowed down a tad too much in some areas, but in the words of the talented screenwriter Nick Kazan (and probably several others) 'Perfection is the Enemy of Art'. Just because I didn't get the pace in a couple areas doesn't mean it doesn't fit. Overall, I think it's a great action film and the fight scenes are done really well (made me wince more than once). It's great to see a woman putting the bad guys in their place. Gina Carano...you go girl!",1336003200,7,1001,4.535911602209945
4959168,4,B006512I7Q,"*edited* This movie is wwritten well in my opinion but maybe would have been better produced if they would have gotten a real martial arts choreographer. For a pro muay thai and mma female fighter to star in it, they should have had much better fight scenes although the grappling scenes aren't bad. The only thing that saves this movie remotely at all is that Gina Carano is so pretty and smoking hot. I would not call her a ""beauty queen"" in any way but there is just something about her that is so attractive and very womanly and tough. She has  a very pretty face. But on the quality of this movie it reminded me of some kind of mission impossible copy or Angelina Jolie spoof for an upcoming action beauty. There is a lot of action, suspense, fighting, stunts and like I said decent plot, but altogether I think it would have been a magnifiscent movie if they got someone who knew how to use the mixed martial arts bombshell, like a female steven seagal/chuck ""chick"" norris/, or jean-claud. In some areas I want to give this movie 5 stars and in others one star so I'll end up with 3 stars or 4 if in kind spirits. NOt bad for her ""blockbuster"" movie debut..at least that I've ever seen her in(i know she's been in others but i've never heard of them or seen them). Gina carano is stunning though. A starlett that keeps your attention lol. I would fail this movie in terms of giving it a passing grade, but all in all considered it was not a bad movie and not a bad breakthrough performance for her. All the other supporting actors were tremendous! B+. She also reminds me or kind of looks like rachel leigh cook. I was a little disppointed we didn't get to see more of her athletic ""form."" I also was very shocked and astounded to learn of her extensive fighting background because until I looked her up on wikipedia I though this woman never fought in her life and never acted in any movie. To my suprise she both has acted and starred in many movies, and was a pro muay thai fighter and then a mma fighter as well as an american gladiator (crush) lol. I then changed my whole view to bad fight scene producers and choreographers who didn't bring there ""A"" game. If they can make angelina jolie look good, they definitely can make an undefeated (i cancel her fight with santos due to steroids) mma fighter look fabulous. I am definitely looking forward to her in future roles when they will give her better fight scenes and more close-ups of how beautiful she is!!! As in my title she was voted maxims #16 top 100 hottest women for a reason and all the guys go haywire for her in this cinematic action ride! GOdbless!
Took a lot of research and time on this so whatever to you haters who think this isn't helpful. I watched it 3 times in 1 days so I know somewhat what's up!

So when I say this movie is really boring I mean it was REALLY boring. It is only the 3rd movie in my life that put me to sleep. Not once, because I gave it the benefit of the doubt that I may have been more tired than I thought and tried watching it again when I woke up at 12:30 am (I usually go to bed around 2am but fell asleep at 10pm watching this film) and ended up falling asleep again and sleeping on the couch all night. I had rented it but I may purchase it now just for nights when I can't seem to fall asleep as this movie is better than medication.",1335916800,2,692,3.8125
4959173,1,B006512I7Q,"On a scale of 1 to 10 I would give this movie a 1, but only because I couldn't give it a 0.

The plot is so slow and boring that I had to fast forward over 95% of it at 4X speed to keep from falling asleep.  And even at that I couldn't take it anymore about halfway through and ejected the DVD so I could watch a rerun of Gunsmoke.

Gina is hot, but her fight scenes mainly consist of her getting jumped from behind and getting beat up.  She ultimately prevails with some ground submission thing out of Gracie jujitsu which is inconsistent with the rest of the fight.

The other action scenes mainly consist of her running away from someone.

I don't know if the second half of the movie is any better, but I didn't want to fast forward through it long enough to find out.",1335916800,8,772,4.079470198675497
4959174,2,B006512I7Q,"This movie is really lousy and is not worth paying full price. I'm not even sure I'd recommend that you pay 99 cents when it goes on sale, but if you really need to see it for yourself, I'd say be patient and wait until it goes on sale, at least you won't be as disappointed as I am.

I admit, I've never even heard of this film or this new action star Gina Carano before I stumbled across this title in the Amazon lineup today. And if you didn't know about any previous reviews, which I didn't, yet wish that I did...well, the trailer makes it seem like it will be an exciting action film. Unfortunately, the trailer severely misrepresents the film. It's very slow to start, and the action sequences are few and far between. Now, in a film with a better story, and better acting, well, that would not necessarily be too bad, however, this new action star cannot act to save her life and the story is weak. She can fight, she's got a pretty face and a sultry voice, I will give her that, but that is not enough to make a good actress nor is it enough to make this film even remotely entertaining. Carano basically has two expressions throughout the entire film, which are - the determined to catch my guy and kick his ass face, and the slight smile, annoying biting her lip face which she does way too often to make it cute. She also stumbled on some lines a bit, which they actually allowed to remain in the film, and I can only think they allowed it to remain because she probably botched the line so many times that they just gave up so as not to waste any more time or film.

To make matters worse, they put this newbie in a cast with top actors like Douglas, Banderas and McGregor which makes her horrendous acting stand out all the more. I'm not meaning to be harsh here, but to explain it best just how bad her acting is, well...I've seen made for the Sci-Fi channel B movies with better acting, and that is not really saying much. She really needs to take some classes before doing her next film, and if she already has had a small bit of drama lessons, she needs to look into a better acting school.",1335916800,,2108,4.241293532338308

4959176,2,B006512I7Q,"I like how Soderbergh will alternate between making big-budget popcorn flicks with low-budget experiments. It's nice to see a director trying to expand beyond his usual oeuvre, although that also means there's bound to be more than a few misfires. In fact, the last off-beat Soderbergh I saw that I liked was BUBBLE. The rest have been, well, good for him for trying is the point.

Don't let the big names in HAYWIRE fool you. Everyone here -- Michael Douglas, Ewan MacGregor, Antonio Banderas, Bill Paxton -- these people are the A-list powder sugar dusting on what is essentially Soderbergh filming Gina Carano beating people up for an hour and a half. If you don't know who Carano is, neither do I, and I didn't like this movie enough to look her up. I have heard that she was some kind of martial arts wunderkind, which is evident in the film. The fight choreography is a lot of fun without being cartoonish. There's also quite a bit of it.

When Carano isn't fighting, she's trying very hard to convey emotions with what I have decided are paralytic good looks. I cannot tell if she chose to sublimate every one of her character's feelings under the same cold facade (if so, lazy and boring choice) or if she -- being new to film -- was afraid to look anything but her best in the movie, and so she always has the exact same sexy half-smirk in every scene. It's like the girl you know who does the duckface in every photo because she thinks its the only way she can take a good photo. Of course, maybe Carano just doesn't really know how to act, and the look on her face is muted confusion.

The story might be partly to blame for that. Characters toss out vague references to being spies and such, and there's dozens of references to foreign places as if they were events. ""Did he tell you about Barcelona? I'll never forget Dublin! Don't tell me you were behind Madrid!"" The meat and potatoes of the plot work in the same overly general way. It's hard to understand much of what's going on, and when all is made (somewhat) clear, it turns out to be your basic spy-by-numbers plot. Even more disappointing than that is that the final revelations are made in true, clunky, B-movie style by having one character explain everything in a drawn-out monologue.

The weirdest example of this happens near the very beginning, when Carano steals a man's car, but then politely tells him all about her jaded history as a private spy before crashing the car into Act Two. It's never fully explained why she sweetly reveals everything to this total stranger -- maybe he was supposed to go to the cops with his second-hand info from a wanted criminal? -- and when the topic is brushed over, it's dismissed without fanfare. Because who cares, right? Character actions and motivations be dammed! What people really want is Carano beating the snot out of Michael Fassbender for ten minutes.

Well, I didn't want that. Soderbergh apparently did. If you do, too, then you might enjoy this film. If you're looking for someone to tell you a story with something other than their fists, though, you might want to look elsewhere",1335916800,6,3112,4.6

The premise of Haywire is simple, but Soderbergh's deft handling makes what would be an otherwise so-so action flick and makes it something unique thanks to his style.  Carano's line delivery could use some work, but her action sequences are wonderful, and it doesn't hurt that she's quite easy on the eyes.

4959182,4,B006512I7Q,"There isn't a whole lot of substance to the plot of HAYWIRE: former mercenary Mallory Kane is double-crossed by her employer/boyfriend, and goes about seeking revenge.  Yep, it's that simple.  You've seen/read/heard the story a dozen times before, and that's only if you aren't a fan of the spy genre.  The structure is slightly unique--the story is told in flashbacks, anchored by a ""present tense"" scene involving Mallory dictating her story to a reluctant passenger (RED STATE'S Michael Angarano).  But even this nonlinear structure is a bit tired by now, and honestly most of the story could've benefited from a straightforward approach.

Why should you watch HAYWIRE then?  Because it's a film by Stephen Soderbergh, a filmmaker so utterly devoted to his craft, he's threatened to retire from it (yeah, one of ""those"" auteurs).  Sarcasm aside, Soderbergh knows what he wants, and he almost always delivers.  HAYWIRE isn't intended to be anything original; and it's not.  It's a straight-up action film, full of those twists and fight scenes and menacing baddies that all action films feature, but filtered through Soderbergh's well-honed lens.  The cinematography is perfect; the fight-scenes are flawlessly choreographed, with no weird cuts or music to take away from the brutal punches and shattering glass.  These are real people doing real stunts.  Yep, just like it used to be.

Soderbergh's choice of star is well-intentioned and mostly on-cue.  Gina Carano isn't an actress, and it shows; but then, she rarely has to do much acting, and certainly no actor could do her stunts quite like she can.  That's obviously clear in the fight scenes between the likes of Michael Fassbender and Channing Tatum: both actors bring their best (and Tatum's best is surprisingly good), and while they can act circles around Carano any day, they can't hold their own in the ring with her.  Also bearing some of the acting burden are Ewen McGregor (a decent villain), Michael Douglas (barely there but always welcome), Bill Paxton (again, little to do, but he does it well), and Antonio Banderas (who, with the best one-liner in the film, proves he's still a contender, and not just an animated bee or cat).  Ultimately, HAYWIRE will be enjoyed by one of two camps: the Soderbergh fans, and those who like an old-fashioned action/espionage thriller, the kind without computer effects or noisome soundtracks or too many gimmicks.  HAYWIRE isn't a perfect film, and it probably never could have been...but it's a Stephen Soderbergh film, which is definitely saying something.",1335830400,4,2567,5.1298076923076925

4959184,1,B006512I7Q,"Roger Ebert gave this movie three (out of four) stars, primarily because MMA champ Gina Carano appears to use her MMA skills in the fight scenes and because of the film's all-star cast. Note: Ebert did not remark on Carano's acting skills or lack thereof. According to Ebert's users, the movie deserved 2.5 stars.

The first person to comment on this movie, in Amazon, gave it 5 stars and said it was non-stop action. Whoever wrote that garbage had to have been high. In the first hour of the movie, there were a total of four fight scenes; all of which totaled about 5 minutes of combined time. One of the fight scenes is only about 20 seconds, which came after a 1-minute chase scene in which Carano's character is running after ""Bad Guy #1"" through the streets of Barcelona. The majority of the first hour, you're left watching boring dialogues with very few words. Carano (Mallory Kane) actually does very little speaking the entire film - primarily because she's not an actress; she's an MMA competitor.

Ebert was also correct, when he criticized the director of the movie, Steven Soderbergh. This was Soderbergh's first attempt at an action thriller, and hopefully, it will be his last. The script was horrible, the plot was hideously cliche, and even the fight scenes were very obviously and very poorly choreographed. If you're hoping for a ""Bourne"" or ""Salt"" style action sequence, you won't find it here. In some fight scenes, you can actually watch the actors manipulate each other into the next move... like in one scene, you can picture hearing Carano say ""Pick your arm up, so I can get you in a sleeper hold."" LOL.

The funniest aspect of the whole thing was that Carano's character gets punched and kicked in the face multiple times, and at one point, she actually gets a cup of hot coffee thrown in her face, and she never shows even as much as an abrasion. No blood, no bruising... not even some redness or blistering caused by the hot coffee. I found this to be pretty hilariously stupid. I don't know how anyone can get punched in the face five or six times and not even show a bruise. This gave the movie a professional wrestling feel... like ""It's obviously not real, because she doesn't even have a bloody lip.""

...Not that I expect movies to be real, but I do expect them to be realistic, or as realistic as possible, if they're not animated. Even fist fights in the old TV show ""Gunsmoke"" showed people with bloody lips and noses, so it seems pretty lame when a movie is made today, in which nobody ever gets so much as a visible blemish on their face.

If you're an MMA fan, or if you're a Carano fan, you will probably love this movie, because it lacks the choreography movie goers enjoy in good Hollywood action movies.

But, if you're an action/thriller/espionage fan with a sweet tooth for well-made fight scenes and conspiracy theories, save your money for the next Bourne movie, because everything about this movie blows in every way from start to the bitter end.",1335830400,29,2997,4.62406015037594

4959188,4,B006512I7Q,"I freakin' loved this movie! Yeah, it isn't like these modern day action flicks with unrealistic over-the-top action, nudity and an overabundance of explosions and coarse language -- It's a throwback to 70's espionage thrillers. Even the music with its cool, driving bass riffs had me thinking Steve McQueen would've fit right into this cast of characters.

And then there's Gina. Have I mentioned Gina Carano? That is one beautiful bad ass chick. It is refreshing to see a strong, athletic woman in a film role that actually requires a strong, athletic woman. No spaghetti armed little 110 pound actress. No shaky cam. No whip pans and camera tricks required to give her the appearance of looking like a fighter. Gina Carano IS a fighter and she is glorious to watch. The fact that this is her first film role and she still manages to hold her own without much experience is pretty impressive. She has a definite career ahead of her (I hear she has just been signed for Fast & Furious 6) and I am looking forward to more projects from my new favorite action star. Gina, you rock.

Sadly there isn't much in the way of special features on the Blu Ray, only two little shorts -- One on Gina Carano and her rise from MMA, how Soderbergh 'discovered' her, to the training and some behind the scenes on the film.  There is another very brief short on the men of 'Haywire'. No commentary at all which is a missed opportunity in my opinion. It would've been interesting to hear Director Steve Soderbergh and Gina Carano discuss the film.

I like what Soderbergh has done here with this nice little film. It's just cool. I'm sure there are some people who won't get it, I mean a lot of people aren't into older films. That's okay. Everybody has their likes and dislikes but this little gem deserves some attention. And hey, did I mention Gina Carano?",1335830400,6,1843,4.592705167173253

I won't begrudge anyone for their opposing view of mine or the consensus of critics, but I will if the action goes unheralded. There is a reason why physicality is commonly depicted the way it is - to obscure the marked inability of actors and their reliance of stunt-doubles.

4959197,2,B006512I7Q,"Hmmm.  Well, I liked the concept, at least. Unfortunately, I wasn't impressed with much else.

Okay, perhaps that sounds unduly dismissive.  It's not all bad.  There are a couple of nice moments of action; and the cast - at least in concept - is good.  Gina Carano acquits herself respectably. The role does not require great acting of her (and is therefore likely a good first film role, one on which she can cut her acting teeth), and she is more than able to handle the physical demands that the role requires.  In that sense, she is the best performer in this movie.

But as for the rest...  Sigh. The film is nominally director Steven Soderbergh's stab at genre storytelling.  Not a bad thought - at least not initially.  I like genre storytelling, and action movies; and if you happen to make a noir-infused action movie, all the better.  (Soderbergh seems to have been striving for the latter here.)  Better yet - in theory, again - Soderbergh isn't a stranger to genre moviemaking.  The Ocean's films, after all, are essentially glossed-up heist movies, and I enjoyed them to varying degrees.

But this film doesn't work.  A good action film - even a slow-burn, noir-ish, `thinking persons' actioner like this one wants to be - should have a palpable sense of forward momentum.  Alas, this film never seems to build any.  Aside from Carano, the performances have a certain laziness to them; actors like Michael Douglas and Ewan McGregor sleepwalk through their roles.  Only Antonio Banderas seems to have any spark, but even then I'm not sure that it wasn't simply the same glimmer of charm that he always has.

Finally, a caveat: except in rare circumstances, I'm still not sold on the overall look of films shot on digital cameras, as 'Haywire' has been. I know that digital may well be the future of cinema, but right now I feel that the format imbues the final products with a rather unfinished aspect; an end result that occasionally feels to me less like cinema and more like old fashioned video.  Soderbergh has been working with digital for some time now and so is better practiced at concealing this aspect than most, but there are still moments when I feel that 'Haywire' looks unpolished.",1334016000,4,2207,4.727748691099476

4959201,4,B006512I7Q,"With Cynthia Rothrock considered yesterday's news and the film world over-enamored with Milla Jovovich in her over-produced blockbusters, it really surprises me that a movie like ""Haywire"" could still be made under the Hollywood umbrella. Not only is an action movie starring a woman getting the big-name treatment, but it's an action movie starring a genuine fighter and not some stunt-doubled starlet. While most of the professional cage brawlers who've made it to the film world have had to slug it out in some remarkably bad low-budget fare (e.g.&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Never-Surrender/dp/B001RLW9Y6/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Never Surrender</a>), MMA heroine Gina Carano lucks out with a great director and a surprisingly good cast in a pretty satisfying CIA revenge flick that could easily become the foundation of a very promising career.

The story: black ops operative Mallory Kane (Carano, who had a bit part in&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Blood-Bone/dp/B002FU8JTW/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Blood & Bone</a>) embarks on an intercontinental mission to find out why she was betrayed by her allies...

I can easily see why the general, non- action-oriented public might not like this movie. Director Steven Soderbergh is definitely one of contemporary Hollywood's best, and because this isn't&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Traffic/dp/B000067IZ3/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Traffic</a>, people who aren't in it for the punches and kicks might consider it a step down for him. Additionally, even I was surprised by this one's cast: I would have expected to find Channing Tatum (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Fighting/dp/B002E01LL6/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Fighting</a>), but Antonio Banderas (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Desperado/dp/0800130448/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Desperado</a>), Ewan McGregor (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Trainspotting/dp/B0057ZAA6W/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Trainspotting</a>), and Michael friggin' Douglas (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Wall-Street/dp/B00003CXDB/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Wall Street</a>)? It's as though Steven Soderbergh called in some favors and bets he won... Truthfully, some of these big names aren't necessary to the film - Michael Douglas' role as a CIA director could've easily been played by someone else - so again, some viewers who will watch this film for name recognition are chancing disappointment when these big stars end up not doing too much. With that said, everybody generally does well and you have to hand it to star Gina Carano for making the most of her first major role: even when not kicking butt, her dramatic offering is more than acceptable.

Of course, the main reason I saw the film was for the butt-kicking, and I'm pleased to say that I wasn't disappointed. Mixed martial arts movies contradict my belief that the best fight scenes are produced by low-budget fare where choreographical creativity can be embellished and not stifled by the whims of producers: while the majority of direct-to-video MMA movies have featured truly awful fight scenes, Hollywood seems to have a better bead on how to make the most of ""realistic"" fighting, and ""Haywire"" is a great example. Carano has six fights of varying lengths throughout the film, and to say that she uses them to redefine how powerful a woman can appear onscreen is an understatement. Even though I like only four of these brawls (which include a standup battle against Ewan McGregor of all people), they're good enough to make me reconsider the place of mixed martial arts in movies. The fights are, for the most part, well-shot and Carano displays the same sort of brutal efficiency as in her Strikeforce career, though she's not above the occasional flashy move like a rebounding roundhouse off the wall. When it comes to looking like she really means it but still being entertaining, Gina's got few equals.

The production is strong, which should be a given in a Soderbergh movie. Some of the European scenes are shot on location, others are fudged, but it all looks authentic. The film doesn't try to do anything aesthetically new, but as far as I'm concerned, it doesn't need to: unless you're particularly needy of car chases and explosions, this movie delivers what an action picture should and does it with a complete lack of pretense. My only major qualm? - the ending comes from out of nowhere and bit too soon for my taste, but I can live with this. Definitely worth a watch, and probably even a buy.",1333065600,7,4760,6.0788690476190474
4959202,3,B006512I7Q,"A perfect example of having all the right ingredients, yet still getting an average pot of soup. ""Haywire"" looked promising: Good director? Check.

This is a spoilerless review, and if you want to get a sense of the plot the main Amazon review above does a fine job. The movie itslef gets stuck sometimes trying to be a modern day version of the 70s tv show ""Baretta"", while other times attempting too much Bond like international intrigue. The end result comes across as mixed genres and ultimately falls flat.

Towards the end Carano has her longest fight scene of the film, set on a gorgeous beach as the sun begins to set. What could have been a great opportunity to showcase her talent instead comes off as terribly staged and hokey. You know she could really kick your butt, and maybe it's partially because Ewan McGregor looks like he couldn't defend himself against an overly aggressive girl scout, but everything from the multiple cutaways to the lighting is wrong. This is arguably supposed to be the dramatic conclusion, but when the scene is shown from a multitude of angles it comes across more like the director is desperately trying to find the one shot that might actually work. Other parts of the movie feel the same way, including a very cardboard like performance by Bill Paxton as Carano's father.

Worth seeing once? Maybe, it does have several good moments early on, and Carano is a real talent we'll no doubt see again. A good rookie effort for sure. But the movie itself is only a charitable 3 stars.",1332633600,,1914,5.1877022653721685
4959203,4,B006512I7Q,"Steven Soderbergh's HAYWIRE is the perfect argument against Hollywood's long-standing tradition of ""waif-fu,"" wherein the studio tries to convince us that a tiny, hundred-pound heroine manages to cut down baddies three-times her size (and weight) without flinching. (Bonus points if said heroine holds two Uzis akimbo and isn't knocked back on her butt.) Soderbergh's foray into action-schlock ditches that paradigm altogether by hiring an actual bruiser (MMA fighter and former AMERICAN GLADIATOR Gina Carano) to do all the rough-and-tumble work.

Carano's Mallory Kane, a mercenary with a private firm hired by the U.S. government to rescue a Chinese journalist (Anthony Brandon Wong) from Barcelona, is less of a ""honeypot"" and more of a bulldog. Packing 145-pounds of muscle and a steely demeanor, Carano gut-punches, sleeper holds, and kicks her enemies without breaking a sweat. There's a story in HAYWIRE (penned by THE LIMEY's Lem Dobbs), with Kane determined to find anwers after being double-crossed by her boss (Ewan McGregor), but it's only there to guide us through setpiece after setpiece of Carano busting balls and taking names. Soderbergh films with a careful (and semi-distant) eye; Carano's athleticism isn't lost to the kinetic cameras that plague most action films in the post-Bourne world. Stripped of choreography and background music, the fights in Haywire astound.

Like THE GIRLFRIEND EXPERIENCE, Soderbergh takes a relative non-actor and builds a world that plays to their strengths. Surrounded by heavyweights like Michael Fassbender and Michael Douglas, Carano may look out of place when she's trading words rather than trading blows. Yet, she holds her own thanks to her indomitable screen presence, having more enthusiasm than similar fighters-turned-actors of yesteryear (e.g. Jean Claude Van Damme, Chuck Norris).

If CONTAGION was Soderbergh making an Irwin Allen film, then Haywire is him making a mid-eighties martial arts film. I don't know what possesses Soderbergh to try more off-beat experiments than other directors, but I admire his technique. Haywire isn't an arthouse deconstruction of an action film; it's an action film, period.",1332547200,5,2175,5.545180722891566
4959204,3,B006512I7Q,"Here is an R-rated Action/Thriller directed by Steven Soderbergh (""Ocean's"" trilogy). My biggest problem was that there was very little action and it certainly wasn't a thriller. In fact, this was the most passion-less thriller I have endured recently. There was a lot of talk, but even the talk was emotionless and ineffective; the plot was never very clear. Maybe when Amazon.com notifies me of the DVD release I can figure it out.

The central issue seemed to be money, but there were so many double crosses and conflicting coalitions, I finally lost track. It's too bad because I found the lead to be attractive and ""the real deal."" She clearly wasn't using a stunt double, as a matter of fact, in ""real life,"" she is a Mixed Martial Arts champion and this is only her second film.

These folks tried to make it work:
  * Gina Carano (""Blood and Bone"") at first glance seems to be the token female, but her character is the former black ops super soldier whose betrayal initiates all the action.
  * Channing Tatum (""The Vow"") is a fellow professional agent who works with our heroine.
  * Michael Fassbender (""Shame,"" who is enjoying being the flavor-of-the-year in Hollywood), plays an agent sent to Barcelona take her out. (He mostly keeps his clothes on in this one...smile...)
  * Ewan McGregor (""Beginners"") seems to be in charge of the professional agents, but his motives aren't totally clear.
  * Antonio Banderas (""Puss in Boots"") is the mouthpiece for the kingpin in Barcelona...we think...
  * Michael Angarano (""Red State"") is the hapless guy in the diner whose car is commandeered and him along with it. He goes from cautious to helpful to terrified in just three scenes.
  * Michael Douglas (""Solitary Man"") is a government official who seems to be playing both ends against the middle.

I guess Soderbergh doesn't have to hit a home run every time at bat. The most tantalizing thing about this film was the R-rating. I don't know why. There were only a couple of gunshots, we saw no blowie uppie stuff, there were very mild car pursuits, and I noticed no profanity or nudity. Yawn....",1332547200,3,2104,4.767955801104972

4959211,1,B006512I7Q,This is Soderbegh in poor form. Soderbergh basically has taken a mainstream genre formula and given it an independent school of filmmaking. The hybrid of these two sensibilities don't gel that succesfully together. The shoot-outs are poorly staged and have no genuine intensity. Carano has no acting experience and it badly shows. She's convincing in the fight scenes and that's about it. Surrounded by high-class actors in this film helps overcome Carano's shortcomings with her stilted performance. Soderbergh likes using digital cameras to film his movies. I hate digital film as there's a flatness and coldness to the film. Some scenes have poor pictorial composition and it shows badly. There's just no intensity and genuine suspense in the chase through back-alleys and rooftops of Dublin. When one see's what Philip Noyce did for Angelina Jolie in SALT that's a director at the height of his game. HAYWIRE is extremly formulaic and routine. The extraction set-piece in Barcelona should have been bravado filmmaking but Soderbergh chooses to shoot the entire set-piece in silence and muted noise which would irritate mainstream audiences seeking huge thrills. The last 15 minutes of this film sinks even lower in mediocrity where it becomes nothing more then a below-par-cable movie. People looking for the female Jason Bourne will be disappointed with this film as the premise had great potential for something explosive with a more daring director.

4959212,5,B006512I7Q,"...It is not for everyone. Some will be (legitimately) completely turned off or bored or confused by it.

Here's why:

Soderbergh is a highly formalist filmmaker, and even though sometimes he subordinates his formalism to the content of his works (as in the Oceans' movies, where even though the formalism is still very much on display, it is clearly way down below the very glossy, entertaining surface of scenery-chewing movie stars having a blast tearing through all those wonderful twists and turns of the heist plots), in other films (witness, for example, The Girlfriend Experience and The Limey) he really lets that formalism take center stage.

As it is nicely summarized on Wikipedia, ""Formalist film theory is a theory of film study that is focused on the formal, or technical, elements of a film: i.e., the lighting, scoring, sound and set design, use of color, shot composition, and editing."" That entry futher goes on to state that, ""Formalism is primarily concerned with style and how it communicates ideas, emotions, and themes (rather than, as critics of formalism point out, concentrating on the themes of a work itself).""

That last bit of the quote in parenthesis about critics of formalism is basically, I think, the place where people who don't end up enjoying Haywire are coming from. If you want to watch a spectacular action movie where you feel caught up in the plot and action in an exhilarating and sensational way, Haywire might disappoint you.

Now, not all filmmakers are necessarily engaged in the theoretical side of filmmaking, but I think we can rest assured that Soderbergh, who has won the best director Oscar and The Palme d'Or at Cannes, or any director who has won and been nominated for so many awards is pretty deeply invested in his or her work as capital A ""Art."" By this I mean to say that while Formalism is primarily considered a means of analysis by critics after films are made, it does also cross over into being a tool in an artist's bag for use during production itself.

One of the things that I find so persistently interesting and enjoyable about Soderbergh is that while his movies often rise to that level of capital A ""Art"", they don't necessarily come off as self-consciously ""arty"" in the way that films by, for example, Lars von Trier (Melancholia, Antichrist) or Nicolas Winding Refn (Drive, the Pusher trilogy) do. Soderbergh seems to enjoy walking on the commercial side of the street, so to speak, while also indulging himself in his Artistic (Formalist) pursuits.

In Haywire - which reunites him with writer Lem Dobbs, who penned his other formalist masterpiece The Limey - Soderbergh uses a kind of skeletal genre framework (that many other reviewers have described, expressing varying degrees of satisfaction) upon which to hang image after crystalline image of fantastically detailed and playful formal experimentation with editing (shot length, juxtaposition, construction of time and space, scene transtions, etc.) , sound design (both in the sounds connected directly to the story or ""diegetic sound"", and in the use of music or ""non-diegetic sound""), image framing and composition, camera movement, and even the fight choreography. He surely hired a professional fighter as his star at least partly with the thinking that it would give him more flexibilty behind the camera (he shoots his own movies under the pseudonym Peter Andrews) to experiment without needing to construct fights with editing in the way that many American action films do in order to make Hollywood movie stars appear to also be accomplished martial artists.

At any rate, I have now managed to compose a review here - as I set out to do - that is completely free of any ""spoilers"" (indeed free of any information at all about the actual content of Haywire, which you may freely find elsewhere in abundance), while I hope to have also opened a door that some people might consider walking through when viewing this movie.",1331251200,10,3966,4.962349397590361
