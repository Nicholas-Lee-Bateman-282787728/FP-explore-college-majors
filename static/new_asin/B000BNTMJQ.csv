2430726,5,B000BNTMJQ,Is an excellent product. The bakers should do more of this dvd for the persons who doesn't have the naturally kitchen art. Thanks Patricia,1140998400,6,138,4.791666666666667
2430727,5,B000BNTMJQ,This is a very good and well made DVD. I'm happy to have it.,1140566400,3,60,3.357142857142857
2430728,5,B000BNTMJQ,This DVD is very helpful.  It has delicious looking desserts.  Some of them are in Martha's Dessert book and others are in her new Baking cookbook but it helps to watch her make the recipes rather than just read about them.  The information in the DVD is appropriate for beginning bakers.  I particularly like the tools and equipment overview given in the beginning.  I highly recommend this DVD.,1138665600,16,396,4.764705882352941
2430729,5,B000BNTMJQ,"Just to give fair warning, I am a ""Martha-head"", but I think I can be pretty objective. So with that in mind, once again, we have been given another treasure of a DVD. It is full of the best of her baking favorites, and per expected Martha-standard, it is perfect.

The segments have been taken from her former TV format where you are in her home as she brings you cookies, cakes, pies, and tarts and shows you how you can create any of these delightful treats, with detailed instruction and clarity. The segments are color-perfect, the sound quality on the button, and all the recipes are easy to download on your computer. But if you don't own a computer, not a problem, because she gives the ingredients and their measure as she goes along.

Something that I think people will enjoy is the ""Special Features"" section at the end of the DVD. You get all sorts of idea's and tips that range from creating a ""Baking Pantry 101"" to cake decorating tips to how to make perfect pie crusts, etc.

And one of the best additions was the ""Blooper"" section. Martha has taken quite a beating in regards to her alleged impatience in her pursuit of perfection but this will show you the funny and giggly side of her, with several segments that have gone a bit awry. She has a good sense of humor and she rolls with it.

2430735,4,B000BNTMJQ,I thought I was buying a cook book not a vidio so for that reason I was dissapointed. .. The Vidio was great but a cook book would have been prefered,1402185600,,149,3.838709677419355
2430736,4,B000BNTMJQ,"She has good recipes, I like to see her and her mother cook, do not like her other guests, I would rather just have her
teach me how to bake.",1388016000,2,141,3.7333333333333334
2430737,1,B000BNTMJQ,"this dvd is poorly made. the picture and sound freeze and images became blury, don't waste your money. It is to bad that the quality is lacking",1361664000,3,143,4.333333333333333
2430738,5,B000BNTMJQ,"I am well aware that not many women/men like Martha Stewart.  Her voice is imperialistic and condescending at times, but she should be respected for her abilities.  She is an excellent
baker and cook.  Her step by step instructions are
important for todays economy.  It is good that we try to create baked goods from scratch instead of
buying over-priced, over-processed baked goods in the supermarkets.",1346025600,4,403,5.0606060606060606
2430739,4,B000BNTMJQ,"I can not begin to say how much the information contained herein has helped me so much in my baking. The lessons on pie making, especially the crusts (my nemesis), cake techniques ie. creaming, beating egg whites (merengues), and all of the different recipes and ways to make and decorate, are indespensible.  I simply adore this tutorial. For a person who does not cook or bake, much, mostly because of fear of messing up and guilt of wasting (I dislike throwing away anything that can be made and used for sustenance, even if it is a sweet) I now have the skill, which is so simple to master, on how to bake. I know now how to make a perfect pie crust, by hand. Me!

There are however, a few cons that come along with this tutorial. The video starts out slow with Martha introducing the recipes and walking the viewers through it. Great! When the guest segments start, the recipes seem to fly by which makes it confusing a bit. People talking over one another, steps being intermingled, which leads me to the next con...

No clearly explained ingredients for the recipes. In the beginning of each segement, I think there should have been a clear run through of all of the ingredients/equiptment needed, then go into the recipe making. Here, there is none. A big dissapointment. If you listen carefully, you can jot down the ingredients as they go along and/or go back, if you can catch what it is they are saying... Which leads me to the next, you know...

There are no English subtitles. Closed Captions, sure, Spanish and French subtitles, sure. But no english. Where were the tecnichals for this dvd produced? Because we live in America, no english subtitles? We live in America. Sometimes the words of those on screen are not clear enough, although I must admit Martha's english is superb.

Anyhow, for technique and recipes this dvd is woth every penny and every minute of your time, it about three hours long, and that's just the recipe section. WOW! A must for every beginner, intermediate beginner for learning and mastering the basics. If you are afraid, Martha saves the day, and your baked goods.",1276560000,12,2109,4.658602150537634
2430740,5,B000BNTMJQ,The Martha Stewart Baking and Cooking DVDs are wonderful!  They came in excellent condition and speedy delivery.  I would definitely use this seller again.,1211846400,2,155,5.416666666666667
2430741,3,B000BNTMJQ,"As a beginner in the realm of baking ( i mostly dabble in alchemy - turning wood into sawdust, gold into goldfish, etc.), this is a pretty helpful video.  Of course, if you don't like Martha, you won't be able to get over the ""martha-ness"" of the whole thing.  But, it shows you some simple techniques that are the basis of many baked goods.  I would have liked more cookies, as well as more tricks of the trade - especially ways to substitute ingredients for slightly lower fat or sugar versions. still, not bad overall and complements some of the recipes in the baking handbook pretty well.",1189468800,,592,4.514018691588785
2430742,4,B000BNTMJQ,"The DVD is very good. I especially like the printable recipes.

It makes everything look so easy, but I have the feeling Martha is not telling everything there is to know about the tricks one needs to get the same results... I am not 100% sure though as I have not had time yet to try any of the recipes out. Hopefully I am wrong.",1179187200,2,330,4.076923076923077
2430743,4,B000BNTMJQ,"Although there are some good recipes, I did buy the video to learn the techniques such as cake decorating, etc.  I am unable to pull up this section of the dvd.  It refers me to a web link to solve technical issues, but the link does not exist.  Perhaps this is because I have a Mac.  I'm not sure.",1144281600,2,298,4.0
2430744,5,B000BNTMJQ,I was very excited when I found out that Martha would be releasing a series of DVD's.  Every product that Martha Stewart puts her name on is of the highest quality.  Fans will love this DVD!!!!,1142208000,2,193,4.333333333333333

8089713,5,B000BNTMJQ,"I have been cooking and baking for over 50 years and Martha can teach! I used to watch her great program during the 90's with my young granddaughters. Watching various segments you can see how comfortable she is and explains things so well. Her Mom is on here with her and has since passed away. The video covers needed equipment, pie crusts, the Ultimate Chocolate cake (OMG), Lemon 1-2-3-4 cake, I love the tips, comments with Mom, and it is you being right there with her watching how to do it step by step...not jumping over steps. Baking is chemistry and Martha explains it while beating , mixing, icing, stenciling finished cakes. This is like going to baking school but relaxed and fun.
The sections of the video are 1 techniques...covers equipment, pie crust, cake stenciing. 2. Cake...Ultimate Chocolate, Lemon Meringue cake,Red Velvet, Boston Cream Pie, Chocolate Angel Food, Hummingbird cake 3 Pies Tarts Cobblers 4 Cookies 5 Special features: bloopers, printable recipes, Baking pantry 101, Cake Decorating, all kinds of tips for wonderful baked treats.
I admit I have lots of good memories of cooking for my family...now that all are grown and gone I do feel there has been a Great loss of the charm and fun of cooking and baking due to Moms having to work. Think about buying videos and maybe  learning with your kids or grandkids the fun of sharing time in the kitchen making food from scratch. Memories are made from spending time together. I know when my grandaughters see their videos lots of memories will flood back of being little girls watching Martha in her kitchen making their mouths water! I highly recommend all of her videos...she is a great teacher and all about detail and quality. Unreserved 5 STARS!",1430524800,5,1731,4.828282828282828
