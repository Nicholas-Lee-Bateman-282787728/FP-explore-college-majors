7921215,3,B00004REFK,"This offering showcases my fave moments- actually, in my opinion, the ONLY exciting moments- in motorsports: the crashes, collisions, crack-ups, & burn-ups. There's nothing quite like watching a dragster &#8220;catchin' air&#8221; and doing a backflip. Or a funny car's canopy suddenly disintegrating in mid-run for no apparent reason. Or a top fueler disintegrating as it rolls over a dozen times. Or a speedboat capsizing, and the driver skimming across the water like a skipping stone! Now THAT'S what racing's all about!
A nice advantage to this DVD is that there's no narration or any dialogue, except for the crowd's reaction. Although most of the footage is mainly drag-racing & nitro funny cars, there are a couple of monster-truck flips, a bit of motorcross bikin', a demolition derby, and a few snippets of less-than-successful auto stunts.
Sadly, the picture quality's not always the best. Since most of the footage was originally shot on video, the clarity leaves something to be desired at times. During the night drag racing scenes, in a lot of instances you can only tell the dragster's there by the flames shootin' out of the exhaust pipes. Another annoyance is the repeating of the same crashes. There was one funny-car disintegration that was shown five times throughout the presentation from three different angles. A couple of the speedboat capsizings were repeated as well.
If you're into drag racing's little moments of mishap mayhem, give this disc a rent (granted you can find it). I wouldn't recommend buying it, however...",997228800,2,1548,5.171314741035856
