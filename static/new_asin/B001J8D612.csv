8451071,5,B001J8D612,"Mariah Carey Live in japan is a rare find indeed. The quality of the picture is not spectacular (you can tell this has been recorded off tv), but it doesn't matter, because that voice, that glorious voice, is captured so incredibly clearly it brings tears to my eyes. This truly is raw Mariah.  No dubbing, just that pure, amazingly powerful range that she could perform so effortlessly back in the good old days. There are moments in this concert, where Mariah has to hold the microphone an impressive distance  away so the audience is not deafened by the vocal force and power. It was interesting to see in the interview at the end, that even back in 1996 (Mariah's 'golden era' of singing, when she was virtually flawless with her live performances, even when singing those grand, sweeping, 'Forever' type ballads), she says she has her 'good days' and 'bad days' depending on how much rest, sleep etc she's had.

It seems Mariah had a choice: either rest, sleep and take care of your voice to preserve it to the best of your ability,  but have pretty much no life outside of singing. Or, live a little, but your voice may not be as good anymore. In the coming years, Mariah would choose the latter. And I can't say I blame her. No wonder she felt trapped in a cage - she was expected to sing, amazingly, all the time.  I loved how Mariah came out of a cage at the start and then went back into it at the end. It shows her emotional turmoil at the time. She truly did feel like the beautiful canary kept in a cage, only let out to sing, then being locked back in again. People cared about Mariah the Voice, not Mariah the Person. We didn't wanna see personality, we wanted to be wowed by her talent.

It breaks my heart a little to think that this amazing woman, with a larger than life voice, is now having to resort to lip synching because that power is no longer there. That middle range is almost completely gone. How can someone go from having such incredibly powerful, soulful vocals to now only being a shadow of her former self? In this concert, this is the Mariah I remember as a little girl. The one whose voice I used to listen to to get to sleep at night. That incredibly sweet girl from the Daydream era who could have been your best friend. Mariah's children will now grow up listening to that voice, and i only hope they get to see this amazing live performance, to appreiciate the stunning voice their mother once possessed.

I loved the performance of Anytime You Need a Friend because it mixes it up with the C&C remix! Which is great fun. Her version of Underneath the Stars made fall head over heels for this song. The way Mariah so huskily sings about warm summer nights, with amazing vocal riffs and runs gives me chills. If you want to be reminded of the magic of Mariah's voice, try and get your hands on this DVD. It is a sad fact to state, but she will never sing like this again. I absolutely love this performance. To say 'Well done, Mariah' is not  high enough praise.",1337299200,,3000,4.383093525179856
8451072,5,B001J8D612,"This is Mariah at her best. Already a superstar with numerous #1 hits, she shows a sold-out Tokyo Dome why she deserved the recognition that she got with her first 4 or 5 CDs. Showing off her full 5 octave range and making it look effortless is no easy feat, but Mariah pulls it off. Loads of hits here, a great backup band and singers, Mariah shows everyone what virtuosity is all about.
This is, unfortunately, one of the last times that Mariah was able to perform with the full power and range of her incredible voice. Subsequent CDs and concerts show the strain and abuse of her voice. In later shows, she began singing with her ""whisper"" style voice. She still has the whistle range, and her lower range, but the awesome power and expression of her mid to high range is sadly gone now.
If for no other reason, any fan of Mariah's or of vocal virtuosity should own this CD to see how incredible her voice once sounded. This concert absolutely deserves 5 stars and is highly recommended.",1279065600,2,990,4.475138121546961
8451073,5,B001J8D612,"This DVD is a bootleg of Mariah's Daydream tour in Tokyo, Japan, 1996.  Mariah's voice sounds amazing and she really gives her all in every performance.  This is the Mariah that everyone fell in love with!  I highly recommend this to any fan.  The quality is great and I promise you won't be disappointed!  A few tracks to take note of are ""Underneath The Stars (gives me chills...it's THAT good) and ""I Don't Wanna Cry"" (she sings it different than the album version...simply amazing!).

FYI: You can buy this on Ebay.",1233100800,4,519,4.648351648351649
