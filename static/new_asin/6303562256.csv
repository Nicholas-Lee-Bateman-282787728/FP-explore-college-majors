7855069,5,6303562256,This is the story Madonna does not want you to know about her.it is not glamorous- it is slutty!!!! I'm sure she wants to forget it.this is a must have for Madonna fans whether you buy a region free portable DVD player or get it on vhs- don't let this gritty tale of her rise to fsme slip away! The woman who plays Madonna looks and acts just like her at that age- don't miss out!!!,1500508800,,382,4.0394736842105265
7855070,3,6303562256,"This 1994 Made for TV movie shown on FOX television was based on the Christopher Andersen biography ""Madonna Unauthorized"". The movie focuses on Madonna's arrival in New York City shortly after graduating high school and all the bumps in the road she faced to claw her way to her first big break as a recording artist. Terumi Matthews does a really great job capturing Madonna's persona but the script was somewhat sloppy with its storytelling. The film does capture her determination to make a name for herself but unfortunately the film makes her come across so cold and calculating...even with her most intimate relationships. I cut her some slack there because she was a young woman at the time and I don't think anyone would be critical of her if she were a man trying to make into the music business.

Despite its flaws here and there, I still found this movie to be entertaining. ""Just Shoot Me"" fans will also enjoy some earlier work of Wendie Malick (Nina Van Horn). It'll be a perfect collectible for any Madonna fan out there or someone who enjoys watching biographical films on famous people.",1276387200,2,1104,4.75

7855072,5,6303562256,"Even though the acting has some goofy moments (like the way Madonna holds the microphone as she sings into it and when her first manager hurts her hand), I enjoy watching this film.  If it portrays anything accurately, it's the fact that she knew what she was doing.  Honestly, part of the movie's appeal for me is it's goofiness.  Her boyfriend's part was acted well.",1202342400,,368,4.630769230769231
7855073,3,6303562256,"i thought this was a good movie.  the acting could have been better.  they picked a great choice in casting.  then again , where are any of those actors now??  they also got a lot of their names wrong , like :
  - paul = dan gillroy (madonna's boyfriend;head of ""breakfast club"")
  - and mitch = jellybean beitenez (dj @ club)
however, a great movie for a madonna fan!!
P.S.= they should have rated this movie too :
PG-13 for sexuality\nudity, and language",1052524800,2,456,4.409638554216867
