174557,5,0983728887,"I consider myself pretty informed about world news and views, but this documentary reminded me that gun control is more than just a political issue. Its a human issue. Its easy to say leave our guns alone when those that die are statistics and not real flesh and blood people. Richie does a great job reminding us that the people suffering are human and not another example of political fuel. The message was extremely powerful! Great watch!",1508544000,,441,4.740259740259741
174558,5,0983728887,"This is a valuable portrait of the current state of gun ownership and usage in America. It takes into account the views of NRA members and victims of gun violence while showcasing why our laws are the way they are, despite 91% of the country agreeing that they should change.",1508544000,,275,4.52
174559,5,0983728887,I'm 100% sure that 91% is worth a watch. There's something for everyone to learn and take to heart. We are better than the politicians we elect!,1508630400,,144,4.37037037037037
174560,5,0983728887,"Excellent, thoughtful film about how most Americans, even NRA members, agree that the background check loophole must be closed.",1508630400,,127,5.7368421052631575

174562,5,0983728887,A must see! This film is a sobering realization to the fact that our elected officials care more for the NRA than the people who put them in office.,1508630400,,148,4.137931034482759
174563,5,0983728887,"If you care about the proliferation of guns in the US, you should see this film.",1508630400,,80,4.0625
174564,5,0983728887,"This film is well done. Capturing the views of NRA and telling the story of the many victims. We seem to forget that while some survive mass shootings, they, nor their familes, receive  help with the massive medical issues and bills. Highly recommended.",1508630400,,253,4.883720930232558
174565,5,0983728887,"With our culture of division and sides and ""anyone who doesn't think exactly like me is an idiot,"" it was really refreshing to watch this balanced, informed take on an issue that everybody has an opinion on but nobody wants to discuss with ""the other side."" This documentary stresses the point that, at the end of the day, whatever your opinion on gun control, we all want the same thing: a safe society, and the way to get that is through building dialog and finding common ground, rather than demonizing and driving the rift in society further apart. In times when mass shootings are becoming commonplace, this doc and its message are more vital than ever. Highly recommended to anyone with an interest in... what... society? gun control? normalcy? basically everyone.",1508630400,,770,4.885496183206107
174566,5,0983728887,"Few debates can roil the public like U.S. gun policy. But John Richie handles the topic deftly in his new documentary. From the parents of gun violence victims to gun show attendees and enthusiasts, Richie captures the nuances of the debate through his interviews. What he does here is something  no other documentary has done to this point. If you care about the topic of gun violence in America, you have to see this.",1508544000,,419,4.662162162162162
174567,5,0983728887,"John Richie delivers a down-to-earth and heartbreaking look into the devastating effects of gun violence in this country. The film gets to the bottom of the fact that 91% (probably even more now) of Americans WANT effective and stricter gun laws and why it just isn't happening. It's his portraits of a few victims of devastating gun violence that leave you asking over and over: ""How many more until something is done?"" Since this film was made it seems we are going to forever be asking.",1508544000,,489,4.6976744186046515

7795202,5,0983728887,"We see a lot in the news about mass shootings and the immediate aftermath, but this movie excels in telling the stories of those who have lost loved ones and/or struggle with the physical and emotional pain as a survivor of gun violence. This movie wasn't quite released 2 years ago, but the number of annual gun deaths in the US has increased more than 2,000 or 3,000 to more than 36,000 per year. Theyre spot on that action on the federal level is needed and all our our voices need to be heard to require national background checks. Speak up, vote and throw those that won't take a stand on this issue out of office.",1523059200,,619,4.344827586206897
7795203,5,0983728887,"91% is a documentary by John Richie that does a great job of laying out the facts and consequences of obtaining a gun in America. It does a good job of interviewing people on both sides of the argument. The interviewees range from NRA gun advocates to victims of gun violence.
This documentary is well-made, informative and surprising at the same time. Highly recommend it!!!",1510012800,,375,4.7846153846153845
7795204,5,0983728887,"91% is a thoughtful, balanced film about guns in America. It doesn't try to preach to its audience about whether or not we should restrict gun ownership. Instead, it focuses on the one thing most Americans on both sides of the debate can agree upon: requiring comprehensive background checks for all gun owners.

Before watching this film, I would have thought background checks were a non-issue. I assumed, like many other Americans, that a background check was a required part of buying a firearm. What I learned is that there's a few key loopholes in this policy: background checks don't apply when it comes to gun dealers at trade shows and on the internet.

Director John Richie (director of a previous documentary on gun violence, ""Shell Shocked"") makes a smart move by centering real people's stories, instead of a bunch of talking heads and policy wonks. The film takes you into the lives of those who have been directly affected by mass shootings. In each case it's clear that these loopholes are making it much easier for deranged, ill meaning people to get guns and slide by without passing a background check. I was especially touched by the story of one woman who was shot in a public mall and still suffers chronic pain from the shooting.

This is a crucial film to watch at a time when we've seen a record number of mass shootings in the US in the past year.

I recommend it 100% for those who may not know much about gun policy and want to learn more.",1509494400,,1467,4.587786259541985
7795205,5,0983728887,91% does a remarkable job of explaining the loop holes in gun control laws which lead to the US having a disproportionately high rate of gun violence. It tells the fascinating story of how this happens even though the large majority of citizens agree with universal background checks. 91% inspired me to take steps that we all could take to help change this problem. It is a very important  film that I hope everyone takes the time to watch.- Laura Clabough,1509235200,,457,4.6419753086419755
7795206,5,0983728887,"""91%"" is a well crafted, thought provoking and deeply moving examination of gun violence  and its disastrous consequences on this country.
The documentary  focuses on current gun legislation and explores how a few simple changes, such as creating mandatory background checks, would have an enormous impact in reducing fatalities and increasing public safety.
Richie interviews people of different cultural backgrounds and political orientations, including gun supporters and members of the NRA,  surprisingly revealing that the majority  of the american public, a baffling 91%, supports the idea of enforcing stricter gun regulations.
Striking a perfect balance between powerful character driven scenes and delivering important factual information, the movie manages to remain engrossing without ever becoming dry.
Whether you are interested in gun legislation or simply a documentary buff, this is definitely a must watch!",1508716800,,923,5.917293233082707
7795207,5,0983728887,"91% is an excellent documentary about gun violence.  John Richie finds the right balance between statistics, expert testimony, and victim experience in this compelling film.  This informative and compelling film is just the right length, lending itself well to in-depth conversation on this critical issue after viewing.  I've seen several gun violence produced in the last few years, and I believe 91% is the best of the bunch.",1508716800,,428,5.264705882352941
7795208,5,0983728887,"This film should be required viewing for anyone in America who believes that our deeply flawed background check system for firearm purchases is effective, particularly lawmakers who have been bought by the NRA. The film profiles individuals who have been harmed by guns easily acquired without a background check by dangerous people. It also provides excellent information from researchers and experts in the field of gun violence prevention. It is factual, direct, and to the point without being gruesome. It shows how everyday Americans can engage in advocating for gun policy reform. I highly recommend this film for community groups, faith groups, civic groups, high school and college students, or anyone concerned about gun violence in America.",1508716800,,750,5.418803418803419
7795209,5,0983728887,"John Richie has created a thought provoking and powerful work of art in 91%. I am a high school Civics teacher and have used this film in my classes the past two years. It touches on Constitutional questions, lobbying and special interests, the legislative process, and the American court system. At its heart though, this film is a story about individual people and families who have been touched by gun violence in America. Behind the bombardment of statistics there are real people who have found their lives altered forever. Richie does a skillful job at eliciting their stories and subsequent actions while never pandering. I highly recommend this film. A great conversation starter.",1508716800,,688,5.097345132743363
