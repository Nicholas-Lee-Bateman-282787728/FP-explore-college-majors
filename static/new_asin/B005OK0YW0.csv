4853102,1,B005OK0YW0,"This is a truly bad movie. The acting was mediocre. The supposed romantic attractions were wooden and unconvincing. The direction and editing was unconvincing, with action sequences lacking continuity, landscape repetitions. The story line I think was heartfelt, but in the end awkwardly symetrical and without nuance What a waste of time.",1396569600,3,339,5.538461538461538

4853104,4,B005OK0YW0,"Its a fair western  for the right price. 79 minutes in length,fullframe,in color,and 4 out of 5 transfer. Story line a little stale and the acting a little stiff. Peter Graves maybe even tries to oversell his acting credentials. Overall a fun Saturday night western....support your favorite artists.",1390003200,3,299,5.229166666666667

4853114,5,B005OK0YW0,"This movie stands out from many other fort flicks.  The quality of the original print stands the test of time, as the digital images are very clear to watch.  After watching the show, I mentioned it to my brother-in-law, who immediately commented that it was one of the best westerns he watched to date.  He had the opportunity to see this movie when it was released to theaters, so he formed a favorable opinion, as a young man.  Peter Graves did a wonderful portrayal of the besieged Army officer, during the 1880s.",1409616000,,517,4.586956521739131
4853115,5,B005OK0YW0,a good lesson to learn!,1408406400,,23,3.8
8481458,2,B005OK0YW0,The movie was done in a time when women were second class citizen. Seeing Peter Graves acting by slapping out a woman then kissing her was not very well done.  The movie had its good points about racism. The action was not that great and the writing was very bad.  The ending was normal for that time when it was made.,1490486400,,318,4.19672131147541

8481466,2,B005OK0YW0,weak ending,1466467200,,11,5.0
8481467,1,B005OK0YW0,"Cavalry vs. Indians in one of the most dismal displays of military ineptitude on the screen.  Lieutenant Ben Keegan (Peter Graves) makes Lt. Colonel Owen (Henry Fonda) in FORT APACHE look almost competent.  The NCO's and enlisted men aren't any better.  About eight minutes into the movie a cavalry courier is captured by the Indians and blusters unconvincingly and unrealistically at the Indians. In the fight in which the detachment is decimated, the sergeant major completely ignores his duty and responsibilities.  This is one of those movies which made me want to yell idots at the screen.

I streamed this movie via Amazon Prime so can not comment on any dvd's.",1466294400,,667,4.972972972972973
