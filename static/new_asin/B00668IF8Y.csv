8493822,5,B00668IF8Y,Got this for hubby because he's Frederick Forsyth's fan.  He loves the set and watches them over and over when there's nothing on TV or not on NetFlix.,1410825600,,151,4.392857142857143
8493823,3,B00668IF8Y,These six movies of which I saw four are at best mediocre. There is no comparison to The Day of The Jackal which of course I thought was better than excellent. I guess it was too much to expect that Frederick Forsyth could equal the afore mentioned movie..,1406332800,,256,4.354166666666667
8493824,4,B00668IF8Y,"this six pack is a great value for the price ie., bang for the buck. all made for tv movies, reasonably good acting, plot, and location. mr. forsyth introduces each film and places it in the proper context. the best of the B spy movie genre.",1372809600,6,241,4.260869565217392
