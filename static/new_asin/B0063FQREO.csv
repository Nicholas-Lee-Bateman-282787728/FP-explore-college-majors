4935925,4,B0063FQREO,"Lionsgate's Easter blockbuster is a lengthy, high-octane dramatisation of&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Hunger-Games/dp/0545425115/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Hunger Games</a>, a ""young adult"" novel by Suzanne Collins. It is the first in a series about which I'd heard nothing before this screening. My eleven-year-old son tells me it is quite the thing at the moment. He's read the whole series and was mightily aggrieved to find out that his square old Dad was going to see it and not someone more fully deserving, like himself.

Life's like that, son - which is more or less the starting premise of the screenplay. The Hunger Games skips nimbly from the heroic quest via a cutting social satire - our vacuous TV lives are mocked in the style of Neil Postman's&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Amusing-Ourselves-to-Death/dp/014303653X/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Amusing Ourselves to Death</a>&nbsp;- to a pretty blunt commentary on contemporary geopolitics (the backdrop is a close simile for the Arab Spring), without ever forgetting the momentum and pulse of a great story. Director Gary Ross easily could have laid on the sanctimony too thickly but his touch was light and the picture was the more effective for it.

The premise is simple: post apocalypse, there is a ruling clique in the Capitol. They live contented if empty lives by exploiting the plebian ghettoes surrounding their city. As punishment for a long distant uprising, each year two dozen proletariat children are picked out from these ""districts"" to fight to the death for the titillation of the Capitol's chattering classes.

Here you'll surmise, correctly, that the story is heavily derivative, but of so many things it blurs. There are shades of&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/1984/dp/B0039O8AQK/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">1984</a>,<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Mad-Max/dp/B000IZXR7U/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Mad Max</a>,<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Blade-Runner/dp/B000UBMSB8/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Blade Runner</a>,<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/King-Arthur/dp/B0060CXW3O/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">King Arthur</a>,<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Running-Man/dp/B0027V6AL8/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Running Man</a>,<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Lost/dp/B0036EH3WU/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Lost</a>,<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Fifth-Element/dp/0800195175/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Fifth Element</a>,<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Truman-Show/dp/B005DNPKSQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Truman Show</a>, Avatar, Total Wipeout and I'm A Celebrity, Get Me Out Of Here. There were no straight rip-offs, but it was difficult to say the film was any meaningful way novel.

But it was executed with plenty of style, with much frenetic use of steadycam. I was sitting in the second row, cowed before a football-field sized screen. I had real trouble keeping the whole thing in focus. The jumpier scenes faded in and out dizzily and it was hard to take in without getting a headache.

Nonetheless Katniss (Jennifer Lawrence, looking not a million miles from a ninja Laura Ingalls), dominates the screen and has more than enough presence to carry the drama. She musters chemistry with pretty much every character on the set except Peeta Mellark (Josh Hutcherson), her notional romantic interest, who is a fellow combatant she must, in theory, kill if she is to survive. Hutcherson is badly miscast as a beta-male gladiator, and was in any case asked to play the most conflicted of all the characters. We suspect Katmiss pined instead for lantern-jawed Gale (Liam Hemsworth) an under-explained hunk, or an effete Cinna (Lenny Kravitz) - anyone, in fact, other than Peeta. Even Donald Sutherland's President Snow.

For a long film with a long build-up, the background exposition was rushed. The tragic history of the Everdeen family was really only hinted at. Katniss' mother (Paula Malcolmson) is emotionally unstable in ways that aren't explained, and is scripted only moon-faced stares to convey her inner conflict. Partly, there are too many characters doing not enough each to make for a tight backstory. Some economising on roles would have helped a good deal.

Still, the film works surprisingly well. The drama struck me, at first, of being a little pat (a rap on TV Reality Gameshows, suggesting contestants really are gladiatorial victims self-wounding for the titillation of the great unwashed) but as it developed the heroic aspect resonated more clearly with more recent geopolitical unrest. Wikipedia reveals that Collins' inspiration came to her when channel surfing between reality TV and CNN's coverage of the invasion of Iraq. This has been cannily updated in terms of the Arab Spring, and in particular the current situation in Syria.

""Give them hope,"" mutters Seneca Crane (Wes Bentley), another otiose character in a film full of them, ""but not too much hope.""

At which point one must mention a splendid turn from Haymitch Abernathy (Woody Harrelson) providing comic relief and vital plot exposition, at least until he resorted to parachuting lines of his script into the rest of the cast rather than saying them (you think I'm exaggerating, don't you).

Through some convenient contrivances the seemingly inevitable downbeat ending was avoided, and resolute stares from all assembled at what was a rather unfulfilling conclusion suggest strongly that more episodes from Collins' series are planned.

This is a well executed film which is well shot, well scripted, well edited and well paced - although it was a good twenty minutes longer than it needed to be.

I am reading the Mockingjay now (last of the trilogy). It has been enthralling from the first to the last. If it is played out close to the book plot it would be a big hit on the big screen. Undoubtedly a call for the trilogy would ring out.

Last start a push for the movie release.

4936034,1,B0063FQREO,"I am truly shocked at the popularity of these books and movies.  If we have devolved into a society who delights in reading and/or watching about children killing children in some of the most horrific ways possible, and the violence that is depicted in the rest of the society in the stories, then what does that say about us?  Does evil and horror exist in the world?  Of course.  Why would you want to be a spectator to it?  Just like they watch in the book/movie.  But the way it is portrayed in this series, it is BEYOND my imagination on why someone would feel ENTERTAINED on any level by reading about or watching it.  I had nightmares about what I did see and read.  And I have to question what kind of person Suzanne Collins is and how her mind is wired in order to write these horrific things.  It is truly very sad.  Because of the popularity, I have attempted to read and watch pieces of each of these, but simply cannot bring myself to do so.  I have no comprehension of why someone would find anything entertaining or interesting about all of this violence.  I have thought this for years, but the movies keep coming up over and over again on TV.  Very sad.

I just read that Ms. Collins has received numerous awards in the young & teen categories for these books.  REALLY?  Is this the kind of violence you want to put in young children's minds?  I would NEVER have allowed my young children to read this kind of material.  It's no wonder the kind of violence they are committing in society today, along with suicides and bullying, because seeing it at the movies or reading about it puts it in their minds and makes it okay in a twisted way for them to do!  I just don't understand.",1510963200,,1697,4.3471337579617835

4936086,5,B0063FQREO,"In Shirley Jackson's ""The Lottery"" (1948), regarded as one of the most famous short stories in American literature, someone in a small rural town is selected by lottery to engage in the center of a yearly ritual which will cleanse the town of its sins. ""The Hunger Games"" presents a similar compelling premise. In the world of Panem, there is one Capitol and 12 districts. Before the events of the story, there were 13 districts which eventually rose up in rebellion, led by District 13. The Capitol was able to put down the rebellion, and District 13 was razed to the ground. However, the rebellion was not the end of the story, and the current dictator of Panem upholds a yearly tradition to remind the remaining districts of their violent past, called ""the Dark Days"".

As punishment for the rebellion and as a reminder of who's ""in charge"", the Capitol hosts a violent pageant every year. Twenty-four young people of pre-college age are chosen by lottery to participate in the pageant; one boy and one girl from each district. The plot is a dark take on reality television contests: the pageant, called ""The Hunger Games"", requires the 24 tributes (they're not called contestants) engage in a fight-to-the-death contest in a wilderness-like arena controlled by unseen technicians in a war room of sorts. Only one tribute can be declared the winner at the end of the games, essentially requiring the other 23 tributes to perish. The games are broadcast on large screens so members of each district can watch the fates of their representatives. The event is hosted by a television game-show host/MC, Claudius Templesmith (Stanley Tucci), who makes Richard Dawson (of Family Feud fame) seem like a high-cultured gentleman. ""And may the odds be ever in your favor!"" is the motto of the Games.

Of the 12 remaining districts, District 12 is the poorest, made up of primarily miners and other blood-and-sweat workers. Katniss Everdeen (Jennifer Lawrence) is a teen girl who has self-taught herself to use the bow to hunt for game and sell in the town. On Tribute Day, all the youth from age 12 to 18 are brought to the town square where Effie Trinket (Elizabeth Banks), a resident of the Capitol who, like many of her colleagues, enjoys wearing garish and flamboyant outfits, hosts the lottery ceremony. She picks Primrose Everdeen (Willow Shields), Katniss' sister to participate. Katniss, stunned, offers to volunteer for the Games in her sister's stead. Since this is the first time someone has ever volunteered, the proposition is accepted by the State. The other tribute from District 9 is Peeta Mallark (Josh Hutcherson).

Katniss and Peeta are chaperoned by Effie Trinket to the Capitol on a bullet train. There they meet their mentor, Haymitch Abernathy (Woody Harrelson), a winner of the Hunger Games many years previously. He is there to help train and instruct Katniss and Peeta, but his highest priority seems to be drinking and snoozing. Eventually, Katniss and Peeta with interesting finesse convince Abernathy that they are worth helping.

Once at the Capitol, they are paraded in front of the elite residents who cheer and decide which tributes they wish to root for. The tributes are then brought to a training facility, being told not to ""hurt"" any of the other tributes. They say there will be plenty of time for violent engagement relatively soon! They are treated like celebrities about to embark on a fashion pageant, being given beautiful outfits to wear during interviews. Of course, everyone knows the outcome of the pageant means 23 of the 24 tributes will not survive. Eventually, on the fateful day, the 24 tributes are transported to the arena-wilderness area where food and weapons are strewn about which can be used to better someone's chances. We also learn that the game is also ""rigged"". The control room doesn't just monitor the tributes but has power to influence situations. There are also ""sponsors"", Capitol residents, who can aid tributes they like. This story has become more relevant with the rise of ""fake news"" and distrust of television journalism with distorted media.

Overall, a well-done and impassioned view of a bleak future which rings of Orwell's ""1984"" and the 1970's cult classic ""Roller Ball"". In ""Roller Ball"" two teams donning skates battle each other on a rink. In the final game, players can only leave the game if they're killed, which is essentially the same idea as ""The Hunger Games"". The film finds a good balance between the heartlessness of the competition (if competition it can be called) and the emotions of the characters. At one point, Katniss befriends a young African-American girl, Rue (Amandla Stenberg), who is obviously too young to be part of the games. They become allies to help each other defend against another ""gang"" who desires to kill them. One of the most touching and poignant moments of the film is their friendship and Rue's fate.",1495929600,7,4918,4.956363636363636

4936093,4,B0063FQREO,"The Hunger Games is a great young adult book about a heroine, Katniss Everdeen, as she fights to stay alive in an annual game known as the Hunger Games where children are forced to fight to the death in a grand arena. Though the book portrays Katniss as a powerful female in the position to be a role model for others, the book also raises issues relating to feminism and how women are viewed in todays society. While reading the book, keep the following few things in mind. First, Katniss only choice in the book is to save her sister. Everything else that happens to her are reactions to what is happening around her or things that the men in the Capitol are doing to her. A whole series is able to base itself around the one choice that Katniss makes. Second, the thing that saves Katniss is a her love life. During the games after she learns that she may also live if she and her male teammate, Peeta, can make it to the last two, her whole life becomes dependent on him. Although it is an integral part of the story, what kind of message is it sending to audiences that a womans life may continue if she can also keep alive another man? Third, though she is portrayed as a powerful, independent woman, she is still constantly being either targeted by men for her strength as they are intimidated by it, or being associated with me for her life romantically. I thoroughly enjoyed reading The Hunger Games as well as watching the film series, but I never fully realized just how heavily Katniss life is dependent on men. More than this, it clearly becomes apparent that she has little to no control over her life as the life she lives is dominated and controlled for her by men. Keeping all of this in mind, I still highly recommend this book as it does feature a powerful woman who is able to survive even when everything seems to be against her. Katniss is an inspiration especially in the society we live in today as she shows that a woman can not only survive, but thrive and find happiness in a world where men dictate her life.",1493856000,,2036,4.388888888888889

4936113,5,B0063FQREO,"The Hunger Games is a great movie, and a great book. I love them both. The fact that Ive read and watched them both multiple times is my best endorsement.

I haven't seen any of the movies or TV series from the following book series, but I did read the first books, Harry Potter and the Sorcerers Stone, Twilight, Outlander, Fifty Shades of Grey, The Long Earth, Divergent, etc. I sample a lot of first books, but I don't read many complete series. (Who has that much time?) The Hunger Games trilogy by Suzanne Collins, and The Song of Ice and Fire (Game of Thrones) series by George Martin are a couple of exceptions.

Ive read both of those series more than once. Both are five star. The first three books in The Song of Ice and Fire series are the best. The Game of Thrones TV series is also five star. The first two Hunger Games movies are five star, but then they got greedy and tried to make two movies out of the Mockingjay book when there was barely enough source material there for one movie. The first two books in The Hunger Games trilogy are better than third book, Mockingjay, and the first two movies, The Hunger Games and Catching Fire, are better than the two Mockingjay movies.

Starship Troopers (1959) (not like the movie) by Robert A. Heinlein is the book that got me started in sci-fi adventures, and has remained one of my top five favorite military science fiction adventure stories for decades. The Forever War (1974) by Joe Haldeman, Armor (1984) by John Steakley, Enders Game (1985) by Orson Scott Card and Old Mans War (2005) by John Scalzi, round out my top five military sci-fi adventure stories.

If you like any of the above you might also like Jack Campbells The Lost Fleet series, Taylor Andersons Destroyermen series, Andre Nortons Star Soldiers, Andy Weirs The Martian, or Frank Herberts Dune. Other sci-fi and fantasy authors I like include Douglas Adams, Isaac Asimov, Paolo Bacigalupi, Arthur C. Clarke, Earnest Cline, Suzanne Collins, Abe Evergreen, Terry Goodkind, Hugh Howey, Robert Jordan, George Martin, Larry Niven, Patrick Rothfuss, Brandon Sanderson and J.R.R.

4936153,3,B0063FQREO,Thats about where it ended for us. Perhaps some actors who could make it a bit more compelling would have helped especially in the lead role. What carried it for us was the cinematography and costumes but once the gang was dropped into the games it was a yawner. We tried the second one and more of the same. Perhaps its just a matter of taste but there was no sense that people were emotionally involved while the film expected you to believe their life & death struggles. But thats just me and I think Jennifer was a very bad choice for this series.,1486425600,,551,4.3076923076923075

We all should think, 'if we assume this unrealistic thing is real, they/we all should be fighting to rip apart the 'capital (government)', not killing each other for survival.

But don't let that stop you from watching this decent time-waster. Woody Harrelson's character was the only one with, well, any character. The rest of the cast was there to recite their lines. Don't think I'm panning the movie. It had movement. It went somewhere. At least it wasn't making me roll my eyes and fast forward through most of it.

While the individual districts focus only on their citizens individual part to play, the Government quells allows only small instigated riots but keeps the districts from uniting together against the Government. This is sort of how the Liberal elite today is pitting races against each other, as well as local police in a them vs. us mentality.  While we think we are fighting for justice and against our true enemy, our Government waits, till the turmoil gets out-of- hand enough to clamp down with marital law and suspension of our Representative Republic under a Constitution.  Some of their other tools besides ethnic divisiveness and local government, are class, economic, religion, as well as other lesser tools,  Similar but somewhat different methods of turmoil and strife is being Engineered in Europe, the Middle East, Asia, Africa, and the rest of the Americas.  Global Martial Law and control is the ultimate goal.  Then the Elite will form the Totalitarian World Government where they are our Masters and we are their permanent Slaves that can be used for anything as they see fit They will win because turmoil and strife have always been with us.  We have never learned to unite in peace together, so the tyranny will come.and with that the never ending wars that keep us pulled apart.

4936650,5,B0063FQREO,"I love this series. It's well written and executed beautifully. Even the music inspires. Don't make the mistake of thinking that this is a movie only for teens.
 It's easy to relate to the overall theme of central government oppression over the districts. But this series isn't only a political narrative. The characters are beautifully written and portrayed. There is love, hardship, friendship, sacrifice and betrayal. You see the best and the worse of mankind. You get to know and care about these characters.  By the way, I've also read the books by Suzanne Collins. They are a fast read and don't disappoint. And the movies follow very closely what is in the books. Even a lot of the dialogue is the same.

The actual 'Hunger Games'  are barbaric and yet the central government would portray them as a reminder of the need for solidarity and allegiance. They're really a threat and a show of the government's power over the districts. Donald Sutherland is fantastic as President Snow. It's wonderful to see his evil bounced off the good of Katniss (Jennifer Lawrence), Peeta (Josh Hutcherson), and Gale (Liam Hemsworth). Don't miss seeing all of the Hunger Games movies and read the books as well.",1473552000,2,1202,4.877450980392157

4936674,5,B0063FQREO,"My granddaughter and I enjoyed this film,
This film is set in a dystopia era were there is one government the Captial and areas are separated into Districts because of previous rebellion against the Captial, In one of these districts is a girl named Katniss Everdeen ( Jennifer Lawrence ) in this district she lives with her sister Primrose ( Willow Shields ) and their mother Mrs. Everdeen ( Paula Malcomson ), every year a boy and a girl between the ages of 14 to 18. Are selected to participate In a process called the reaping, ( from all the districts ) at the reaping we meet Effie Trinkett ( Elizabeth Banks ) a lady who teaches etiquette to all chosen to be sent into the games, two are chosen, Peeta Mellark ( Josh Hutcherson ) and Katniss Everdeen.

After they are chosen we meet their mentor Haymitch Abernathy ( and boy is he unique.. To say the least..lol.. ) we watch them go through the process of training during the time they spend in the Captial we also get an insight into the personalities of the other participates from the other districts and what are main character and supporting character will have to face while in the area. What follows after the training is a fight for survival. ( for parents of young and impressionable children there isn't enough violence in this film that one should be concerned about, the director and author made sure of that, if one isn't sure watch the film first and make the call :) ) there is action in this film but not over the top.

So don't expect a whole lot, plus, this film was based on the first book so everything that happened in the book can't always be put into films, do I think the film could have been better, yes, I felt like it was missing something, then again, because of time constraints and money things that could've been. Added to the film weren't, I think that people will enjoy this film whether by; yourself, with family, friends.",1471824000,,1912,4.4756446991404015

I finally watched the Hunger Games film, figuring I should know what the shouting was all about.  It turned out that I really enjoyed the movie and then read the book and loved it also.  I haven't been able to get into the later stories, but this one can stand on its own, leaving you to imagine what the future might hold.  The film's additions to the book help tell the story extremely well, since a story told in first person does require some creative film writing.

You can get the basic gist of the story from watching the trailer.  I obviously knew she won, since she's in the next movie.  There were no surprises in the movie.  It's a contest and you already know who wins from the beginning.  But, I gave it three stars since it didn't put me to sleep.",1469491200,,418,4.1625

Not having a younger child in the house who had read the books and only hearing about it in passing at work, I didn't know if it would have been worth watching.  I took a long while before I finally saw it.  I can say I was intrigued.  What is the Hunger Games?  Remember the TV series Survivor?  Well, that's about it - except with children.

It's certainly not warm and fuzzy, kids killing kids but it has elements of love, caring and kinship.  Perhaps this isn't the best way to show those attributes, but it does get through.  I cannot guarantee you'll enjoy the movie.  I did and I was happy to know there'd be more.  This is much like the Divergent series.

4936780,2,B0063FQREO,"NOT RATING THE MOVIE. The two stars are actually for the disappointment of ordering a blu-ray with a DIGITAL COPY (in Jan/2016) and then discovering that the digital copy expired in August of 2013. TWO AND A HALF YEARS. And yet it's still being sold as a combo blu-ray / digital copy. Yes it explains somewhere that copies must be redeemed prior to the expiration dates, which can be found in the package. This was a gift and wound up not being opened until after the return policy expired. And because I'm generally happy with Amazon I can't for the life of me find somewhere to contact customer service. So instead, I'll write a review. And there you have it. BEWARE buying older movies if you want a digital copy. And by older I mean more than a year old I guess.",1465344000,2,766,4.401408450704225

Jennifer Lawrence's performance was great and all of the other actors were incredibly cast.

4936894,1,B0063FQREO,"I have survived quite a few of the Hunger Games films, and all of them are boring, predictable, cheesy, and devoid of any interesting storytelling or performance. The main character does not know how to act, she has one facial expression throughout the film, that of a mild constipation no matter whether she looks into her beloved boyfriend's eyes, or watches people get killed. She looks pampered and content, not hungry or desperate; there is zero emotion between the characters, special effects are terrible (a dress with flames? you must be kidding me, right?), costumes do not match the environment, and dialogue is that of a bad fanfic. I have no clue why this is so popular, the subject has been done before million of times, if you want real art with the similar subject, you could watch Terry Gilliam's ""Brazil"".",1460505600,6,822,4.836879432624113

And in order to hear the thing you have to turn it way up to the 30-40's.  And then it starts to blare so loud. Someone did not do a very good job on the volume mix to these movies. I have heard my friends say the same thing. To bad because I really love the Hunger Games Saga. All four of the movies are very enjoyable and I especially love that there is no cussing in  any of the movies. Cussing just runes movies for me. I me really are they not smart enough to have to cuss every other word or cuss through the whole movie. Come on people surely you are all intellectual enough to not have to cuss. Are you not? Personally I think it belittles the actor or person who cusses a lot. I am just saying, ask yourself do you really want your children to hear you speak thoses words?

4936908,2,B0063FQREO,"Superb acting, directing, location, special effects. Jennifer Lawrence makes the movie watchable and is genius as always, camera work stunning, music and sound amazing. The violence is never the focus, in fact the director goes out of his way to not show the barbaric scenes that are in the book in order to keep PG-13 rating. I would rate the effort here as 10 stars if there was a script that made sense.

The problem is the sick, sadistic, despicable premise of setting teenagers to killing each other. Alone, innocent, untrained, unprotected physically and unarmed initially: the only purpose is to broadcast a gruesome show in real time. There can be nothing gained by picking random kids to kill, it does not enforce discipline, only rage at the unfairness of the ""game"". I could not think of a more disgusting premise to make a movie. What's next--toddlers with guns?. Without Lawrence and this director making something from less than nothing I would never consider such nonsense. 10,000 positive reviews here, however, show that our society has not evolved from gladiator/ public guillotining spectacles. At least gladiators were adult and most had some protection and weaponry.",1459296000,,1187,5.087179487179487

4936931,5,B0063FQREO,"Very entertaining, well-made first installment of the Hunger Games trilogy. Jennifer Lawrence gives an exceptionally understated performance as Katniss Everdeen, which is just what the character and movie needed. Josh Hamilton, Stanley Tucci and Donald Sutherland are also very good indeed.
Lawrence and Hamilton provide the very ambivalent chemistry the movie demands. As an older viewer of the movie, I must say I was struck by the remarkable similarity between the insanely ridiculous ""reality TV"" shows, and the insanely serious competition comprising the Hunger
Games.
This film may be based on books written for young adults, but the movie is accessible and entertaining even if you happen to be just a tad older than the target audience.",1458864000,,744,5.367521367521367

Shes been dying for the movies, so I thought they would make the perfect birthday gift for her!  It was perfect  she loved it!  Having read the books myself, we sat down to watch the movie together!

In terms of the packaging and quality of the discs, they were in perfect condition.  The movie itself wasn't bad either.  While the books are definitely the better option, this movie captured the essence of the book extremely well.  We felt there was a lot on the leading up to the games and quite a bit was left out about the actual games, but this could have been due to several factors I wouldnt begin to imagine.  It was entertaining, kept out attention, and provided the desire to watch the next in the series.

If you're looking for a movie to share a mix of emotions ranging from disbelief, sadness, excitement, and ultimately a happy ending, then you will want to add this to your collection!  If you are looking to get an accurate depiction of the book, skip the movie  youll like the book better, always.  You will no doubt enjoy this movie for many movie nights to come!

4936946,5,B0063FQREO,"In the country of Panem, a single wealthy city, the capitol, sits in the middle of twelve working (and impoverished) districts.  And each year, as punishment for a rebellion nearly a century earlier, all twelve send one male and one female 'tribute' to take part in the Hunger Games, a vicious contest where the 24 battle to the death until only one victor remains.  The thing about this scenario that really struck me the first time I watched it, and it still seems relevant, is that when you watch the movie (I haven't read the books yet, although I plan to) the story doesn't require NEARLY the amount of suspension-of-disbelief it should to get into it.  Whether that's a plus mark for the skills of the filmmakers or a minus mark for the direction our world is going in I don't know, but the movie, and the rest of its series, feel surprisingly 'real'.

The central character for the movie is 18 year-old Katniss Everdeen (brilliantly played by Jennifer Lawrence), who takes the rare step of actually volunteering for the Games when her 13 year-old sister Primrose (Willow Shields) is drawn at random to be their district's tribute for the 74th annual Hunger Games; a loophole in the rules allows a person picked tribute to be withdrawn if another candidate volunteers to take their place.  Drawn as the male tribute is Peeta (Josh Hutcherson), who's secretly loved Katniss for years.  And thus the two are whisked off to begin being mentored and training for the upcoming event.  The Games themselves usually take a couple weeks to conclude and are fought inside a force field-sealed vast area of wilderness.  The participants compete not only against one another directly, but also fight it out in the arena of popularity.  The Games are broadcast live across Panem, and the more popular a participant is, the better the chances of gaining rich sponsors, who can pay to have food or weapons or other items drone-delivered to their favorite player.

It would be easy to go on for pages getting into the movie and its sequels and all its subplots and allegories in detail, but the main points are how well done the whole thing is (for starters, ALL the performances are excellent), how strangely plausible it comes across, and how powerful of an emotional punch it carries - this is one film that may make you cry or at least mist up.  And it does what a first installment in a planned series should do - it has its own powerful ending while still setting the stage for the rest of the movies to come.  10/10",1458345600,,2513,4.660633484162896

4937004,5,B0063FQREO,"In my personal opinion, both the book and the film are much deeper and much more ambitious, than what most critics and reviewers would make us believe. After reading the reviews in ""New York Times"", ""Le Monde"" and on ""Msn.com"" (to cite only few) I was surprised that they mostly missed everything that is important in this film. With a kind of amused superiority, which people from Capitol in this movie would immediately recognize, the ""professional"" reviewers pointed at the obvious allusions to gladiator fights, the reality shows, the importance of trashy entertainment in today's TV, the search for a new franchise able to replace ""Twilight"", etc., etc.

But they almost entirely failed to see, that this film is first and above all about much more important things: how to keep hope, not lose the courage and preserve humanity and dignity under a totalitarian oppressive regime.

I believe that almost everybody now knows that when writing ""Hunger Games"" Susan Collins attempted basically a modern (even futurist) retelling of the old Greek myth of Theseus and Minotaur. According to this ancient tale, after losing a war, every year the city of Athens had to send a tribute of seven young men and seven maidens to the king of Crete. Once there the young people were locked in the Labyrinth, to be devoured by the monster Minotaur. This yearly punishment and humiliation lasted until Theseus, crown prince of Athens, volunteered to be one of the tributes and once locked in the Labyrinth he defeated and killed the Minotaur.

In ""Hunger Games"" what was once United States (and I think also Canada) is now called the Panem. It is a country divided in twelve Districts remaining under the control of the Capitol central metropolis. There was once thirteen Districts, but when they rebelled against the central power, the Capitol destroyed completely the District 13 with all its population and then defeated and submitted again the twelve others. In order to remind to its subjects how absolute is its power, the Capitol claims a yearly tribute - one girl and one boy of ages from 12 to 18 from every District. The tributes are then send to an arena and forced to fight, until only one remain alive. This yearly event is called the Hunger Games and it is shown live on TV to all the population of Panem. This film tells the story of what happened at the 74th edition of Hunger Games...

For Capitol the purpose of Hunger Games is to remind yearly how powerful is the central metropolis and how dire can be the consequences of its wrath, but also - and even more importantly in my opinion - to humiliate and degrade the people of the Districts by forcing them to become accomplices (even if under duress) of a barbarian custom in which some of their own children are send to the slaughterhouse. And as all bullies and abusers know, it is much easier to oppress, abuse and brutalize victims who lack self-esteem...

Well, in this film we can see how one of the tributes from District 12, an exceptionnal young girl named Katniss Everdeen (Jennifer Lawrence), manages to turn the tables on the Capitol and by allowing people of Panem to regain some of their dignity she will be the pebble which starts the avalanche. The exact way in which she does that will not be revealed here, but both in the book as in the film it is described in a very intelligent and very moving way...

This may seem a rather improbable thing that a 16 years old child can do something that will ultimately bring down a seemingly invincible and all-powerful tyranny, but let's not forget that in the real world, the great wave of revolutions of Arab Spring began on 18 December 2010 with a desperate gesture of a dirt-poor 27-years old Tunisian street vendor, Mohamed Bouazizi, who set himself on fire after having been robbed and beaten by the corrupt local police one time too much... Less than two years after, the opressive regimes in Tunisia, Egypt, Libya already collapsed, the seemingly invulnerable dictator of Yemen had to resign and the Syrian brutal regime is facing a massive armed rebellion..

Bottom line, this film is first and before all a story about how even a seemingly powerless person can horribly hurt a tyrannic regime with a magic potion made of lots of courage, an ice-cold determination, a great personal dignity, a little compassion, a handful of flowers, a couple of tears and one defiant and powerful gesture...

The powerful message and excellent scenario are not the only reasons why I consider ""Hunger Games"" as a masterpiece. Actors were selected very carefully and they perform well. Jennifer Lawrence is simply perfect - there is no other word to describe her performance! However, after seeing her in ""Winter's Bone"" and ""X-Men: First class"" I didn't expect anything less.

But the real surprise in this film comes from Josh Hutcherson who plays Peeta Mellark, the boy tribute from District 12. His character is more difficult to play, because Peeta is in the same time more limited but also more complicated than Katniss. Josh Hutcherson could have very easily fall in one of the many traps which are build in Peeta's character. By overacting or underacting he could have make him a wimp or a passive follower or an immature kid, but he avoided those snares with grace and his Peeta comes out of this film as a surprisingly complexe and also a very likeable character. He is certainly not a hero and a fighter like Katniss - but until the very end he preserves his honor, in a deadly place where he shouldn't ever be send...

A special mention goes to little Amandla Stenberg, who plays 12-years old Rue, the youngest of all the tributes. Her character is both secondary and in the same time incredibly important - and this little cute pixie played it perfectly!

Other, more known actors contribute to the success of this film. Woody Harrelson is excellent as Haymitch, the only person from District 12 who ever won in the Hunger Games and is now an advisor to Katniss and Peeta. Lenny Kravitz portrayed a perfect Cinna, the man in charge of image of tributes from District 12 in public appearances before the games begin. And finally there is the giant figure of Donald Sutherland, who plays the supreme ruler of Panem, President Coriolanus Snow. He is purely incredible. There is a moment in this film when he says to somebody ""I like you"" - and I believe that I have never heard such a terrible and deadly threat in one short sentence since the archifamous Schwarzenegger's ""I will be back""...

I also absolutely adored the using of the cameras. In some moments of this film we have the impression of going after the characters with a camera, like a war correspondent following the fighters (this style was also very skillfully used in ""The Shield"" series). Of course not all the film is turned in this way, but mixing this kind of scenes with more conventional ones gives here an excellent effect.

The games themselves are very skillfully described and are a very dramatic tale, full of surprises and twists. I found them much much better than ""Battle Royale"", to which this book and film are often compared. The games are deadly and brutal, but there is only limited gore - I think this film is suitable for young teenagers, although not for children younger than 12. There is also absolutely no nudity, sex or strong language and I for one found it a most excellent thing.

There are still many more good things to say about this film, but I believe you should discover them by yourself. One more thing however about the book - it is of course possible to see and greatly enjoy this film without reading the book, but I believe that reading the novel first is a good idea. If reading the whole book is out of question, I would advise to read at least the first hundred pages. It will not reveal much about the games themselves, but it will allow for a better understanding of some of the key elements: the strength of the bond between Katniss and her younger sister, the history that Katniss shares with her hunting partner Gale, the complicated relation between Katniss and her mother and last but not least, the mysterious bond existing between Katniss and Peeta Mellark.

About this last point: if you did not yet read the book I do not want to spoil the pleasure of discovery so I will say just this - Katniss and Peeta lived for 16 years in the same village, but they never spoke one to another (except for an occasional ""Hello"") and they never touched one another in any way. And still, they share a secret as big as life and death, a secret which both bonded them together and in the same time separated them deeply... If you want to know the solution of this riddle you have either to watch very very carefully every scene of the film or simply read the book...

Conclusion: this film is a masterpiece! I loved it and I am going to buy the DVD as soon as it is available. And I am SOOO going to see the the second part, as soon as it opens!",1456099200,,8970,4.660556257901391

She's read the books twice and the movies who knows how many times in the last two months. It is a very interesting franchise and the concepts within are very interesting to think about.

Yes, they did, but this wasn't the mindless bloodbath that the title would imply.

If you've never read the book, you'll be at a loss as to why certain things happen. Important symbols are not explained. The relationship between Peeta and Katniss seems forced. It's like the movie writers threw in many of the dialog lines from the book and didn't bother to try to convey important details.

4937306,5,B0063FQREO,"I used Prime's video service to rent this. I had no issues with video quality when streaming via XBox One. The price was reasonable for a long term rental, and the convenience was worth it!

I waitied a few years to see this movie after a friend said she didn't like it. I have to say - I really enjoyed this film. I feel that having not read the books made this a bit confusing for my nine year old, but I was able to follow along (also having not read the books) without any issues. If anything, this made me WANT to read the books. I'll say that this movie is definitely the best out of the four - and in my opinion the quality and story goes down-hill after this one. I'm thinking this is probably because there was a lot of material to cover from the books and they had to leave out key character developments and plot points due to time constraints.

If you're wondering whether or not you should let your little one watch this - I'd say that you need to understand your child's emotional range before making that decision. There are a few graphic scenes (or at least what is implied is graphic); this is a book series about kids being put in an arena to murder each other - and they do just that. My kiddo didn't get scared, but she definitely wanted to stop and talk about what was happening and why it was happening a few times - which is good (at least she didn't get bored or frustrated with it and stop watching it). Be careful - once you watch the first movie, you'll want to watch the others; they all sort of end on a cliff-hanger (although not so horribly that this movie can't stand alone). The reason I say 'be careful' is that as the series progress, the murders and violence really take on a darker tone (if that's possible) and you may find yourself needing to explain some things that you weren't prepared to explain (i.e. allegory, sacrifice, corruption, using love/sex to manipulate others).",1448841600,,1915,4.346368715083799

4937311,4,B0063FQREO,"Like many adaptations,  this one leaves you amazed at Lionsgates staggering contempt for the movie viewing public,  a contempt similar to the Capitals contempt for the populations of the Districts;  so perhaps their attitude is appropriate.

Susan Collins source novel (she is complicit in this insult as she had a least some part in the adaptation), the first of a trilogy,  is the story of an existential heroine (Katniss Everdeen) who performs a single heroic act, volunteering to take the place of her younger sister in the post-apocalyptic games from which the grim trilogy gets its name.

But Katniss immediately knows that there was nothing heroic about her action, that her lightening fast decision required no contemplation but was something she was compelled to do.  For the rest of the first book (upon which the 2012 film is based) Katniss is buffeted along by mix of free will and destiny, second-guessing each of her decisions and feeling far more guilt than satisfaction over the consequences and (more fundamentally) over her decision to essentially prostitute herself to the Capital in the service of survival.

And the reader gets full access to the inner working of her mind because the story is told entirely (100%) from her point of view.  This storytelling device shrinks the scale of the story, as a reader never goes out beyond the reach of the first person storyteller.  This fosters the sort of reader identification Edgar Rice Burroughs brought to his John Carter of Mars series.

Apparently Lionsgate felt that viewers were not up to the mental challenge of Collins storytelling technique and they converted to a third person POV, going so far as to completely dispense with a voiceover narration by the main character.  A puzzling decision since film offers wonderful opportunities for the juxtaposition of objects of contrasting scale.

Lionsgate also felt the need to draw in characters and events from the second book in the series (endless scenes of President Snow and signs of the beginning of dissent in the Districts).  These immediately destroy the scale unique to the first book and the concept of a faceless enemy, so that the progression of the trilogy from small to vast is compromised.  Overt dissent in the Districts appears far too soon in the adaptation,  effectively spoiling both the intimacy of the first book and the expansion of the struggle in later books.

The film's ham-handed treatment of the story is reflected in Haymitch's explanation for the high score Katness receives after shooting the apple out of the pig's month.  He says it is because they liked her guts;  but his explanation in the book is that they liked her temper,  that this exhibition of her fierceness has made her a player who they believe will bring some heat to the games.  Guts are not going to attract sponsors or win the games,  nor are they going to incite anyone to revolt.  It is a critical change of phrase because throughout the trilogy it is not her courage but her mix of fierceness and humanity that is the difference maker for Katniss,  and it is this mix that gives the character the dimensionality necessary for reader identification.

Most remarkable, however, is Lionsgates inexplicable failure to feature the most powerful and most memorable moment in the entire trilogy;  the moment Katniss receives the bread from District 11.  Arguably the most intense segment ever written.  This is really the first books climatic scene, as Katniss slowly grasps that the bread was originally intended for Rue,  with those in her district making a great sacrifice in order to support her.  And that after Rues death they elected to redirect the gift to a participant from another district, the first time in the 70+ year history of the games that such a gesture was made.  And the first hint of a unification of the twelve intentionally isolated districts.

This is the turning point of the entire story,  much like the moment in The Magnificent Seven when the villagers tell Chris they collected everything of value in their poor village to hire him and he accepts this small sum,  saying: I have been offered a lot for my work, but never everything.

Then again, what do I know?  I'm only a child.",1448755200,,4231,4.90154711673699

She has what I would describe as the prototypical Appalachia look. As far as her acting, it's just okay. Also, it's really hard for me to take any movie seriously that has Woody Harrelson in it.

I was expecting people running some sort of gauntlet of obstacles for a bowl of ice cream, a T-bone, or a succulent roast pig.  I can see how the people in the show would be hungry at times but it seems their motivation for the game was much more than a sandwich.  While I was disappointed it was not about people fighting their way through a Canned Foods Grocery Outlet it turned out to be an alright flick. It was entertaining.  If in real life there was a canon fired every time someone died it would make us all more conscientious about our own mortality and perhaps we would all be nicer to each other.

4937439,5,B0063FQREO,"This is an apocalyptic story of a government in the capital, ruling over twelve districts with an iron hand. There is severe poverty and the people are hungry. The capital, which is not poverty stricken, demands two ""tributes,"" a girl and a boy from each district be chosen to compete in the annual Hunger Games. Twenty-four young people, chosen by lottery, must fight to the death, to show the capital's control over the twelve districts, and for the entertainment of the capital's population. It has a Roman coliseum feel to it. The winner not only gets to live, but gets showered with wealth.

An exceptional girl, Katniss Everdeen, goes to the lottery and when her little sister is chosen, she intervenes and volunteers to take her place. All she has to do is survive, right? One problem, the other member of district twelve is Peeta, and he makes it known he is in love with her. Only one can win the Hunger games.

I purchased the movie when I saw it at least respected the book and author not to completely butcher by taking a small fragment of the book and making a whole movie out of it like Percy Jackson and the Lightening Thief did. Nor did the creators distort themselves into an inescapable corner they had to create bogus scenes to patch their oops-es like Harry Potter.

They also cut out most of the backstory, which was unfortunate since it set up the future books/movies. If you haven't read the books, you'll probably enjoy this movie more. Jennifer Lawrence is a great actress, and portrays Katniss accurately (perpetually sullen). Woody Harrelson is the highlight of THG, since he's really the only funny part in this dark and depressing tale of teen angst. I do wish Katniss had been a more interesting character, but this movie is definitely not the worst I've seen.

Jennifer Lawrence plays the heroine to the tee. Her empathy, her perseverance over all the obstacles she has to overcome, her becoming a heroine when her only goal was to replace her sister who was picked, and so much more. I personally loved all t
four movies and felt they did a marvelous job. I will continue to reread the books but also watch these movies.",1446249600,,552,4.368932038834951

4937556,5,B0063FQREO,Great Movie,1442966400,,11,5.0
4937557,4,B0063FQREO,"This movie was a great mix of action, adventure, and romance.  The helpless, dystopian future was well portrayed, perfect for our hero Katniss Everdeen to emerge from.  The plot was well structured with good amounts of action and romance incorporated.  Although the movie does not quite accurately recreate the atmosphere presented in the book, I felt like it was done with good reason.  In order to reach a wider audience, it had to change some parts, but they still managed to get every major theme into the film.  For example, although the film does not linger as much on the scene where the kids are awaiting the countdown in the stadium, we can still see the horror of kids being forced to kill other kids.  Movies also have a time limit, so not every detail can be included.  Certain parts had to be shortened in order to keep the pace up.  Overall, although it may not have lived up to the book, it was still a great movie that should be watched.",1442966400,,953,4.5
4937558,4,B0063FQREO,"I definitely enjoyed The Hungers Games movie more than expected. I was very excited about it when it came out in theaters but, since I had already read the book, I didn't have high expectations for the content of the movie. Even though the movie missed a lot of background, like most movies do, it surprisingly captured a lot of what Katniss is thinking/feeling. Whether that be the director's decision or Jennifer Lawrence's superb acting, it was a good choice that really connected the audience to her character. The action was of course the main attraction. I love the director's decision to make the bloodiest scene open to our imagination by not really showing what is going on. I also enjoyed how they made such a huge contrast between Katniss with her forest and the Capital with its buildings and flamboyant people.
I would recommend this movie if you are looking for a dark but entertaining, young fight for survival.
Overall the movie gets four stars for entertainment, direction and acting.",1442966400,,1001,4.859649122807017
4937559,4,B0063FQREO,"Director Gary Ross's film adaptation of The Hunger Games by Suzanne Collins was very action packed. I think it showed a little more of the violence as opposed to the character development, like all movie adaptations, because it needs to put in more of the storyline than the small details for time's sake. As someone who read the book, I would say it was lacking some of the emotional impact that I thought the book had. When you're reading, you can stop and think of a connection that ties you to the characters of the book, but the movie keeps on going. If I had not read the book, I would think the movie was phenomenal. The actors Jennifer Lawrence, Josh Hutcherson Liam Hemsworth, Elizabeth Banks, Woody Harrelson, Stanley Tucci, and the others portrayed their characters very well. The special effects were all spectacular. And lastly, the scoring of the movie was astounding; each song, especially the one Katniss sings herself, is perfectly placed to match the mood. I would recommend this movie to anyone looking for an action, romance, and sci-fi movie all rolled into one.",1442966400,,1083,4.7967914438502675
4937560,4,B0063FQREO,"Unlike many of these reviewers, I did not previously read the book before watching the movie.  Therefore, if you are looking for a compared review of the two forms of the Hunger Games this is not the review to read.  As a ""blind"" viewer, I was very impressed with the film.  The plot as well as production quality was very well executed, leaving me excited to watch the next few films.  I did not know what the movie was about before watching it and the suspense and storyline kept me drawn in.  I was eager to see what would happen and once finding out, I was satisfied with the film in total.  I believe that Jennifer Lawrence did a great job in portraying Katniss.  I felt as if she captured the character in the same way the author would have hoped for.  The only negative thing I really have to say about the film is that I felt like the battle scenes could have been played up a little bit.  Though it did not take away from the quality of the film, I definitely think it could have helped intensify what was going on.  The topic of children killing children is such an intense one and truly one of the main ideas of the film that I thought the battles should have better paralleled that.  I understand that the editors had to keep in mind who their intended audience was, but I still think that in the way they edited the film or even portrayed the scenes could have been done up without crossing any lines.  In general, I believe the filmmakers did a great job in creating what was a  very highly anticipated film.",1442880000,,1522,4.298245614035087
4937561,5,B0063FQREO,"Before watching any of the Hunger Games movies I made sure I read all of the books. They always say that the book is better than the movie, and in most cases I would agree, but for this movie I would have to disagree. I thought the director, Gary Ross, did an amazing job keeping to the material from the book. Most of the time, because of time constraints, movies are forced to leave out a lot of details from the book. However, this movie did not. I also think that this movie does a great job at developing character back grounds. I think that in making a book into a movie most of the time character development is lost. This movie really focuses on developing the main characters, Katniss, background so we get the same emotion attachment as we do when we read the book. The first part of the movie can be pretty slow as it builds up to the games. Once the games get under way the movie had me on the edge of my seat the whole time. Overall I would highly recommend this movie to anyone and give it 5 out of 5 stars.",1442880000,,1021,4.135678391959799
4937562,4,B0063FQREO,"Compared to some, I didn't read the books before I saw the movie and I think that is largely why i loved the movie so much! All of the actors spoke true to their character and I can honestly say there were no ""bad actors"". The editing of the movie kept the audience on their toes the whole time, and there really wasn't a boring moment in the movie. However, I will speak truthfully that if you are one that has read the book first and want to purchase the movie, be prepared to see that there are many differences just in editing wise, but if you are one to just accept that movies and books portray things differently and would like to see the directors take on the novel, by all means watch the movie!",1442880000,,704,4.1838235294117645
4937563,4,B0063FQREO,"This movie was well made with a ton of great scenes. Jennifer Lawrence does an excellent job playing Katniss. The movie had a relatively good plot, but has some flaws. The one thing I didn't understand was how Peeta and Katniss were able to both come out alive. I know they claim they were in love but they really weren't. Even though Katniss was loved by all the districts no Hunger Game before this one allowed two survivors regardless of the situation. Another thing I didn't like about the movie was how rebellious Katniss was. Yes she is a very smart and talented character but what makes her different from the last 74 victors in the Hunger Games? I think what made Katniss special was that she was willing to help others and she had a hard time comprehending death, she was never going to kill someone unless she had too.  I also noticed a lot of cliche ""one liner"" scenes that are in ever action film, not bad but can be redundant at times. Even though she does try to get the people to rebel against the capital, we don't know her ulterior motives or anything.  Besides that the movie was really well put together. From camera angles, to cinematography, to acting. Everything was very well produced. The script was in-depth enough to entertain me, and emotional enough to get me attached to the characters.",1442880000,,1315,4.567796610169491
4937564,3,B0063FQREO,"""The Hunger Games"" is the first of the four in its series of Young Adult novel film adaptations. It's directed by Gary Ross (known for ""Big"" (1988) and ""Seabiscuit"" (2003)), and spotlights well-loved movie stars Liam Hemsworth (The Last Song), Josh Hutcherson (Bridge to Terabithia), and Jennifer Lawrence (Winter's Bone) - who in particular became extremely popular after accepting her roll as Katniss Everdeen. The film could also be considered ""star-studded,"" with Lenny Kravitz, Donald Sutherland, and Stanley Tucci all in supporting roles.
""The Hunger Games"" takes place in a dystopian future - which I feel the need to point out is quite the unoriginal trend going around right now - in which the majority of the country Panem (once the USA) lives in poverty, slaving away and starving so that the 1% who are lucky to be born into wealth can live as luxuriously as they please in the Capitol. Katniss (Lawrence) is one of the many unfortunate citizens who lives in the poorest of the country's twelve districts. With her father dead in a mining accident, she has taken over as head of the family and is the sole provider for her mother and younger sister. Unfortunately for Katniss, the Hunger Games exists. As if the country wasn't messed up enough, every year two teenagers from each district are randomly selected to participate in the Games...which wouldn't sound so bad, except that participation consists of killing everyone else or getting killed yourself. The Hunger Games is a literal cut-throat reality series with the duel purpose of entertaining the Capitol citizens and keeping the districts under the thumb of the government. The film opens when it's that fateful time of the year for the two names to be drawn and fight in the Games. And - of all the thousands of other options that could have been drawn - it just so happens that Katniss's little sister is the lucky girl. As the respective second parent, Katniss immediately steps in as a volunteer to replace her sister, and together she and the boy tribute, Peeta (Hutcherson), are taken to the Capitol to prepare for what could be their final days.
About half of the movie covers the Games themselves, but I don't want to get too spoilery with any of that. The film heavily appeals to a teenaged audience -- the same crowd that was at your local theater every midnight for years in a row to watch all the ""Harry Potter"" premieres. A huge chunk of its viewers also consists of the fans of ""The Hunger Games"" book trilogy, who gave the general consensus of disappointment after realizing how much changed in the book-to-movie transition. As someone who belongs to both of those groups listed prior, I have to say that I thought it was just okay. Ross has a serious problem with his ""shaky camera"" technique, and for around 30% of the movie I was getting motion sickness. There was also the matter of a narrator. The novels are told from Katniss's point of view, and as a result her thoughts are inserted into every moment of the story. On the other hand, the filmmakers made the decision to avoid anything like a voice over, and so a lot of chemistry and depth to the characters and their relationships became weaker or disappeared completely. The story itself remains invigorating, action-packed, and heart-wrenching, but viewer be warned that it is not for the weak-hearted.
If you are a lover of the very specific yet popular ""strong female lead in a dystopian future"" genre, you will not be sorry you watched this. Otherwise, you may decide on something else to watch.",1442880000,,3546,4.795751633986928

I think that this movie is okay. It has potential to be a good movie, but there are just some things about it that bother me, and I think they hold the movie back from being good. The first thing is that it is not as good as the book. The characters are less developed in the movie compared to the book. It's hard to tell what they are thinking in the movie, whereas the book tells you exactly what they are thinking. But I can't blame the director for that, because there really is no way to express thought in a film without it being really cheesy. The second thing that bothers me is that I feel bad for Liam Hemsworth, because he loses the part of Thor to his brother, and his consolation prize for that is barely getting any screen time in this movie. His character is a very good one, and he plays it well, but you don't get to see enough of him. The rest of the casting is great. Stanley Tucci is one of my favorite actors, and he is so underrated. He is the best part of the entire movie. The entire buildup to the games is good, but when the games actually happen, it's disappointing. The killings aren't graphic enough for me to feel anything. I also don't like how everything goes silent at the very beginning of the games when the countdown ends. I get why they did that, but it just didn't feel right to me, and during the rest of the games it's hard to gather what is going on because they keep cutting away to different scenes. The actual games just weren't epic enough for me. I really believe this movie could've been great, but they just didn't focus enough on the most important part, and that's why I give it a rating of ""okay.""",1442793600,,1798,4.169540229885057
4937567,4,B0063FQREO,"Coming from a position of watching the movie before reading the book, I found this production to be better than average.  The book filled in details that were overlooked in the movie, however I enjoyed the movie's view of the book.  It managed to give me chills, and bring to life the fiction written by Suzanne Collins.  While the film focused almost solely on on Katniss Everdeen, it still brought the tributes to life.  The movie carried its own weight in evoking sadness for the death of most tributes by giving a general persona for a majority of the teens.

I can easily see how reading the book first would alter your views of the movie, and this review may be meaningless for you, but if you haven't read the book I can almost guarantee you will find an odd fascination for the massacre of these teens.",1442793600,,810,4.482993197278912
4937568,4,B0063FQREO,"The Hunger Games directed by Gary Ross starring Jennifer Lawrence (Katniss Everdeen), Josh Hutcherson (Peeta Mellark), and Woody Harrelson (Haymitch) is the film adaptation of Suzanne Collins series of the same name. In this film, the protagonist Katniss volunteers to replace her younger sister Prim who has been selected to compete in the annual Hunger Games. These games are a televised event hosted by The Capital in which 12 boys and 12 girls, 2 from each district, are put in an arena to fight to the death. Katniss, with the use of her bow and arrow, fights to stay alive and protect Peeta, the baker's son from her district. It is always hard to adapt a work that is so widely known because every fan will be critically analyzing the film for fidelity. The problem is that films and novels are not independent they have a dynamic relationship as seen through the use of Suzanne Collins as a screenwriter for this blockbuster. All adaptations must be negotiated by the filmmakers and their choices to evoke the essence of the film and allows other works not seen in the text influence the way one sees the work. The Hunger Games for the most part tried to be faithful to the original text for the sake of the fandom although this stifles the creativity on the part of the filmmaker. Minor changes were made to battle scenes to achieve a PG-13 rating and some characters were less developed due to time constraints and inability to hear innermost thoughts, but overall the work achieves its goal of captivating its audience and encouraging a new age of eager readers.",1442793600,,1573,4.723636363636364
4937569,4,B0063FQREO,"I had not read The Hunger Games book series before seeing the movie so I did not know what to expect. When I watched the movie I was intrigued by the plot line and loved the complexity of all the different story lines that the movie had going on. From the obvious struggle to win the games and stay alive to the underlying reasons that drove Katniss to do it (love for her family and friends), the movie keeps you on the edge of your seat the entire time. This is a great movie to see as a family or even on a date night, everyone can find something to relate to. If you are like me and have not read the books but are wondering who will win the games (Katniss or Peeta) you better watch this movie because the ending may just surprise you.",1442793600,,740,4.075342465753424

4937571,4,B0063FQREO,"I saw the movie The Hunger Games for the first time without having read the book and I thought that the film was very good. People say that the movie does not have as much substance as the books, which is definitely true, however, there is a reason for that, it isn't just because they don't want it to. The films operate with a significant time budget as where the books don't. It was made clear to me that the film doesn't go into enough detail about the emotions of the characters in and around the time of the actual ""games"" themselves. This is because the movie director only shows what he or she thinks is necessary in the allotted time he or she has. This is also why some people prefer the book over the movie. There are though, many people who would sacrifice that detail for gruesome action scenes and magnificent adventure shots.

To critique the film as just the film in itself, it was very good and well-visioned. In other words, it was enjoyable to watch and I think many other people thought so as well. The acting was superb. The CGI and visual effects were amazing. And it left the audience in a ""wow"" state of mind upon conclusion. The idea of the film is very ""out of this world"" and unrealistic, but still is appealing for those very reasons. People will never experience such emotions in real life, thus to be able to have a taste of it through film is special enough.

All in all, it was an appealing movie that I recommend most people see.",1442793600,,1462,4.3713235294117645

4937583,5,B0063FQREO,"This is one of my favorite movies of all time as it is all about bravery and strength against the odds.  It is a fascinating good vs evil storyline with excellent character development.  What i find especially interesting is the observation that people that get their needs met (i.e., the wealthy)  don't show much concern for others  (have nots) who are less fortunate- which certainly  mirrors one of the shortcoming of the human race. We have seen this play out from the Roman times of the gladiators in the arena to 3rd world countries using child labor to the unionization of workers in the industrial era to prevent rich/ greedy from taking advantage of workers.  It also is a good example of how knowing some survival techniques can really come in handy.  I don't see this as a children's movie which might be suggested from Amazon advertising the book as a children's books.  It is truly a teen to adult movie.",1442275200,2,918,4.658385093167702

4937683,3,B0063FQREO,"This film adaptation of the book ""Hunger Games"" is an okay flick. Even though I never read the book, I could tell the movie was rushed, trying to cram in things as much as possible in to a two hour window. The film really suffers for this, there werea lot of times I didn't understand something and had to ask my wife (who read the books) to clarify.
Once you get past that, it was entertaining enough to enjoy.
The book is definitely better, I don't even have to read it to know that, but there are very few movies that are better than their book counterparts anyway",1437091200,,567,4.2592592592592595

4937728,5,B0063FQREO,I would have never expected to enjoy this movie.  I never read the books.  I kept seeing bits of this movie while on vacation in Mexico.  When I got home I finally watched the movie and really enjoyed it.,1435190400,,204,4.17948717948718
4937729,4,B0063FQREO,"Its been hard for the last few years to not hear about The Hunger Games.  Even before the movies started coming out, everyone who read talked about the books.  While I have been holding out on reading them or watching the movies, I knew at some point Id see what all the buzz is about.  The first movie being on ABC Family last weekend was just the push I needed to plunge into this world.

Katniss (Jennifer Lawrence) is a typical teenager  at least in her world.  She is part of district 12, one of the outlying regions in Panem.  While the wealth is located in the capital, the rest of the country struggles to survive.  And every year, two teens, a boy and a girl, are randomly chosen from each district to compete in a brutal contest to the death until only one of them remains.

As the movie opens, it is once again time for the lottery.  When her sister is chosen, Katniss volunteers to take her place.  Taken to the capital along with Peeta (Josh Hutcherson), a boy shes known all her life, she must suddenly figure how to compete for her very life.  That includes being nice and getting sponsors who might help her during the games, something she is not very good at.  But even with help, will Katniss be able to overcome the odds and survive the Hunger Games themselves?

Since I haven't read the books, I am coming to the movie with no preconceived ideas of how the story should be told, so you won't find any complaints about changes from the book here.  However, I did find the story a little hard to get into.  Part of it, Im sure, is the fact that character development is one thing always cut when a book is made into a movie.  (Okay, fine, a book to movie comparison.)  Plus, I knew how the story would have to end, at least partially, so I didn't allow myself to get too emotionally invested in the majority of the characters.  Still, I did find the killing in the movie hard to watch, which Im sure was the point.  Unlike slasher movies (which I do enjoy upon occasion), this movie rightly makes the killing something horrible to be reviled even though each death means Katniss is closer to winning.  The violence wasn't graphic (at least on TV), but it was still rightfully hard to watch.

Honestly, this dichotomy has been one reason Ive been hesitant to read the books.  I knew Id struggle with all the death, again weird since I do read murder mysteries most of the time.  The story definitely treats the entire thing as something truly evil, as it should be, with those who celebrate the games being monsters, again as it should be.  The result is something deeper to think about when you are done with the movie.

I am thrilled to see what a great character Katniss is.  She is a selfless young woman who sacrifices for her sister.  When the games begin, she actually goes out of her way to avoid killing, only killing in self-defense and even doing her best to protect one of the youngest competitors for a time.  Mind you, she has the skills to take out the others if she has to, but she doesnt do it unless absolutely forced to do so.  It is easy to get behind her as a result, and I was glad to see such a wonderful role model in the story.

The cast does a great job with their various roles.  Again, I came to this with no preconceived ideas of how anyone should look or act, but I thought the actors were great at bringing their characters to life.  I especially enjoyed Woody Harrelson as the only winner from District 12 who then mentors Katniss and Peeta before the games begin.  Jennifer Lawrence carries much of the movie, and she is wonderful as Katniss.

The director chose to go with the shaky camera work for the film, a technique I hate.  Fortunately, on the small screen, it didn't bother me too much, although all the quick cuts at times made it hard to tell exactly what was happening.  Thats my biggest complaint about the film.  I also thought a few of the cut aways to other locations slowed down the story.

I think my reaction to the film fits how I thought I would feel about the franchise.  Still, I am curious how the series progresses, so I will be on the lookout for the sequel to The Hunger Games so I can watch it soon.",1435104000,,4176,4.338064516129032

(which I think most kids under 12 would actually miss.) The movie, thankfully tones down some of the violence that was in the book. The acting was superb. Jennifer Lawrence rocks. Love Woody Harrelson, too. Hunger Games is worth seeing to understand what is going on before you see the second through fourth movies. (not sure when Mocking Jay Part 2 comes out). The second and third movies are actually great and magnify the real enemy on screen, which is the Capital and oppression of the districts, leading up to an all-out war between the Capital and the districts, with Jennifer Lawrence fueling the hope to fight.

4937838,2,B0063FQREO,"I watched this on a 100 inch home theater screen which may have exaggerated things for me personally. The first half of the movie is almost unwatchable. The camera zooms in then out then right then back then up then down all in about 2 seconds in scene after scene after scene. And it happens either simply looking at someones face or any other NON-action scene. It make's you feel dizzy just watching this. What is this supposed to be, a violent roller-coaster ride simulator or a movie? If you have to ""give the feeling"" of some type of deep emotion by violently shaking the camera around then you have a poor director who can't tell a compelling story properly or a story that should have been left in book form. If you can stomach the first half of the movie the rest is OK at best. Not the best action, acting or the best story plot to warrant some 11,000+ reviews. The best I can figure is those who read the books, loved them so much that they are into this franchise and support it no mater what. Perhaps not all popular books can transition into film correctly. Unless the book actually stated on page one ""shake this book wildly while reading chapters 1 through 5 to get the real feel of the story"" then this ""movie"" really missed the mark and should not have messed with a popular book series.",1430611200,,1304,4.392561983471074

Love it even more for the affirmation of how individuals can turn it around, if they care enough and are willing to make the effort, and the sacrifices necessary to effect change...

The movie versions, for the most part, translated to screen quite well, especially after the first one. I wish much more detail from the books could carry over to the movies, although I realize that the movies would have to be six hours long to get it all.

If you can read the books, then see the movies, I highly recommend doing it that way. If reading isn't your thing, I still recommend the movies!

The script is on a par with an episode of "" Honey Boo Boo "" The question is then .....if you put all of these elements together......does the acting make this  movie better or worse ?......The answer is that the acting, like the rest of the movie , is so bad that it actually hurts to watch this movie- I'd suggest that  this movie should be used as a device to interrogate terrorists but that would really be cruel & inhuman punishment - Beware ! -- Avoid this movie at all costs !!",1430006400,4,839,4.23125

4937859,4,B0063FQREO,"I admit that The Hunger Games was a surprisingly good film, considering that it's based on a fantasy novel for teenagers, and I'm not *that* young anymore.

I haven't read the novels, but the film reminded me of Running Man, with its parody of staged reality shows and violent entertainment. Running Man was made in 1987. It seems nothing has changed in the entertainment industry! Besides, the next logical step in reality TV probably is a gladiator contest. I mean, the networks are running out of ideas with a shock factor...

But, of course, The Hunger Games goes deeper. The story probably works best if you see it as a caricature of today's society: elite groups out of control, super-exploited subjects in outlaying districts, and panem et circenses for the stupid masses. The Hunger Games is a weirdly believable futuristic scenario. I can almost see it happening.

So much of the book revolves around Katniss's thoughts about everything - life in the district, her impressions of the Capitol, her emotions during the games - and it simply doesn't translate into the movie. Don't let it stop you from watching the rest of the series tho - Catching Fire and Mockingjay Part 1 were MUCH better.

4937877,5,B0063FQREO,"I guess I got on the Hunger Games late but I thought I would watch just to see what all the buzz was about. I was unexpectedly surprised. The story of Catness as a tribute for her district's Hunger Games entry just didn't seem on the surface to get my attention but as I watched the film it sucked me in. The social messages it puts out are obvious but not preachy and by the middle of the movie I found I was engaged into a fun little ride. The movie centers around a character that has a Jerry Springer type of television show, and he oversees the games with a play by play that made me think of American Idol to the death. The games have all the production, design, and choreography of those types of reality shows, but the stakes are life and death. The way that the main character develops throughout the movie is all the fun.

I'm 50 years old and this wasn't made for my demographic but I was pleased with the story and I immediately went looking for the sequel ""Catching Fire""  I think The Hunger Games is a great film.",1429315200,,1027,4.208121827411167

4937886,5,B0063FQREO,"Well, I just fished watching The Hunger Games movie and thought they did a really good job in interpreting the book to the big screen and Suzanne Collins who is the author of the novels was also one of the screen writers of the movie so even thou the was many changes made in the movie such as not showing as many flashbacks as what took place in the book! For example in the novel one of the flashbacks that Katniss has is the how she first meet Gale during one of her hunting trips and became best friends and there was hints that they were going to be more than friends. So, as far as people that the emotional aspects of the novel where a little more intense and it took place over a longer period of time in the novel compared to the movie! The other thing was the fact that Peetra's leg injury was a little more severe in the novel where they had to replace his leg with a fake one as well as Katniss hearing was damaged during the explosions was left out! Overall, I understand why changes where made so that if every detail was there than the movie would of been much longer and for the most part stayed fairly accurate to novel. Kathleen, I understan your disappointment but I guess you didn't pay close enough attention to the credits of the movie but the author Suzanne Collins was actually one the the screen writers invoked in helping to create the script!",1428969600,,1369,4.289575289575289

Since I've never seen the movie in its entirety I'll just give it 4 stars because it looks really good :),1428537600,,375,3.9473684210526314

4937945,2,B0063FQREO,"Its undeniable that The Hunger Games (2012) tells a fascinating, dystopian story. An all-powerful, almost maniacal government reigns over Panem, the country that once was America. The Hunger Gamespitting teens against each other as a TV showis their way of punishing their subjects for an uprising some years ago. It's President Snow's way of keeping his country in line.

  The story kind of puts me in the mind of ancient Rome and its arenas, gladiators, lions, and avid, bloodthirsty audience. So in that way, I can actually look at the story of The Hunger Games (2012) as a fascinating tale based on a possible occurrence. Theres no fairytale about it. Governments/rulers can often become corrupted the more power they gain. The human heart is very capable of carrying out all kinds of devious things when theres things like power, fear, revenge, and riches involved.
  Yeah, so it was very interesting to me. However, I cant say I would ever watch it again. Its one thing to force people to fight; its another when these people are teens. And half of them have been trained to fight all their lives and actually look at it as a game, finding sick pleasure in it. Obviously, it could be a real scenario. The ""good guys"" in the movie are sickened and sorrowed by it. You know, all that. But it was just too much for me.

  Quite a bit of yucky stuff in this movie. Most violence isn't really graphic; but there's a lot of gross/creepy to make up for that. It's just not my thing. I will say however, that the movie is much better than the book, The Hunger Games. I listened to that as an audiobook, and had to mute it many times. *Gag* So many unneeded details. The filmmakers definitely did a better job being more delicate with the horrific violence (though still, I didn't like it). And they made Katniss's character more sensitive and humane than in the books. So that's a thumbs up for them anyway.

  There was some good things about this movie. The capital was disgusting but interesting. The TV host, Ceaser. Kind of funny; yet strange and unfeeling. The dresses made by Cinna for Katniss...amazing!

  I love Katniss's relationship with her younger sister, Primrose. How she volunteered for Prim's place in the Hunger Games... And yes, Peeta and Katniss, *sigh again*. Haymitch was an interesting guy. Definitely wounded by his time in the Games. And Rue, she was such a sweetie, *cries*

  Katniss Everdeen is an incredible character. She's a brave young woman, fighting to keep her family safe. She sneaks outside of Panem's electric fences and hunts for game to feed her widowed mother and little sister, Primrose. Her childhood friend, Gale Hawthorne, is often involved in these hunts. He's apparently in love with her. And while I like Gale...he's not for her.

  Peeta Mellark however... *Sigh* I love his story with Katniss. Throwing her the bread. Falling in love. He's just such a dear. A thoughtful, good man. He and Katniss's journey together is poignant. I have high hopes for them!!

  So yes. Again, The Hunger Games (2012) was an intriguing story for sure. Emotional and gripping. Sends my storytelling senses reeling. But the sickening violence... Teen against teen, some as young as thirteen... Hmmm. It could have been just a powerful, captivating story if they wouldn't have made it so...yucky! I don't know. Anyway, I just don't care to make it my entertainment. I really wouldnt recommend it to anyone.

4937973,4,B0063FQREO,"There were a couple of things that SHOULD NOT have been left out.  1.  Cato stabbing Peeta in the leg when Peeta is defending Katniss.  If I hadn't read the book then I wouldn't have known how he got the wound.  I guess they wanted to make Katniss the only hero but it was a key element in the book.  Without showing that in the movie(which only would've taken a second to put in) you leave ppl confused about his alliance with the careers and how he got hurt.  2. They should've left how Thresh died alone.  Cato kills him in the book or so they lead you to believe.  Plus, the dogs are much more advanced in the book and look like the dead tributes.  3.  When they pick up Kat and Peeta, they immediately take Peeta into surgery, leaving Katniss screaming and going nuts that they took him away from her until they sedate her.  After which she finds out that he has a prosthetic leg.  None of those things should've been left out.  Especially #1,  that whole thing was confusing.",1427068800,,981,4.2896174863387975

4938051,5,B0063FQREO,"Around the time that I was about to retire from teaching high school, my students were really starting to read ""The Hunger Games"" and its sequels. Normally, I tried to read what they were reading, but I never got around to this series. Finally, I gave up intentions of reading the book  and decided to watch the movie, although from what I had heard, I didn't think I would want to watch the others in the series.  As it turns out,  I was completely fascinated by this movie.
  The director steadily builds characterization as the plot progresses with mesmerizing dramatic tension.  I was spellbound by the contrast between the realistic, earthiness of the ""district"" people when juxtaposed with the quirky, cruel, futuristic administration.
  I would also recommend it for study in both literature and social studies classes. The topics for discussion are endless.

4938090,3,B0063FQREO,"This movie just never came together for me.  It was as if the director was already thinking ahead to Hunger Games 2 + 3, and treatment of this film was perfunctory.  Despite a depressingly believable futuristic premise, and elaborate sets and costumery, it had no more depth or nuance than the many tiresome TV action dramas I wouldn't watch either.  Jennifer Lawrence cuts a fine figure with a bow, but her part in this film is as unaffecting and one-dimensional as a super-hero cartoon, and I wouldn't know she could act if I hadn't seen Winter's Bone and American Hustle.  If you like futuristic movies, see Blade Runner, Road Warrior.....there's any number more clever, intelligent and thought-provoking futuristic films than this one.",1425600000,,739,5.032786885245901

4938097,2,B0063FQREO,"I know this film series is all the craze among teens, but the idea of children having to kill each other off--I think it is horrible, and a cheap way to give people a high from the negative adrenaline rush of fear.  What a vision of a future world!  Really?  Children forced to kill each other?  We are creating the future now, and I find this version of the future unimaginative and irresponsible.  It takes more ingenuity to conjure a future world that hasn't fallen apart so brutally.  The film was well produced, the sets and costumes were well designed, and the acting made it tolerable to watch.  But so what?  The question is why writers and filmmakers continue to focus so frequently on the lowest common denominator of the human psyche when they could be designing a future on behalf of all of us that is spectacularly beautiful instead.",1425427200,,846,4.593333333333334

4938102,2,B0063FQREO,"It's a girl in a death-match game trying to ""be good"" by avoiding hurting anyone, and yetBIG SURPRISEshe ends up winning while employing this non-strategy! Which relied on so many incidents of overwhelmingly good luck that the story is far from believable. Katniss was lucky that Rue wanted to help her  but why did Rue want to? She was lucky that Thresh was killed by mutts, relieving Katniss from having to kill him herself. She was lucky that her arrow, though hitting Cato in the hand  which wouldn't kill him and therefore ""wasn't immoral""  caused him to fall and be killed by the mutts.

It's a series of far-fetched contrivances built up to give support to a Christian-moralistic narrative. Was her moralistic, uber-righteousness the ""reason"" behind why she won? She ""had to win"" because she was the ""moral one""? I would apply all of these criticisms to the book as well.

This was a good movie opening up to the whole hunger game franchise. It worked off a good script to make this movie entertaining and holding your interest without being annoyed along the way.

The actors were good in their roles especially from veteran actor Woody Harrelson. Jennifer Lawrence was solid. Donald Sutherland was his typical villain self.

Being the first movie to start off maybe it was the action sequences that I didn't find too impressive but it was the rest of the story that carried this movie.",1424131200,,748,4.567164179104478

4938211,4,B0063FQREO,"Great movie & books, my only issue(s) is why did the author write Katniss as being so dense and selfish, except when she volunteered for Prim? Also, everything she did was for her own benefit, the ""whoa's me"" pity party and the ""what do I get out of it"" thinking about Peeta. Peeta & Gale were the ""you don't know what you got till it's gone"" because Katniss was an ""Oracle"" in her delusions. But with Peeta it was ""it would be better to kill you now (making his decisions for him) because it'll be easier for me (even pertaining to Finnick"" and that is plain selfish.

Katniss, the girl on fire, with the weight of the world in her shoulders, making friend or foe's to kill or not to kill choices for them because she thinks it's her responsibility and she's smarter than them..

Suzanne Collins seems to have written Katniss as not showing any emotion (passive aggressive) unless extreme situations happen (I can maneuver Finnick to be killed, sooner better than later) way of thinking until he daves Peeta's life. She's like a ""logical (in her mind) thinking robot."" exa. Peeta chance at survival is slim, so I might as well kill him myself now... "" or"" better I kill Finnick now before I get to know him... "" then after Finnick saved Peeta's life, ""well maybe I'd have a better chance at survival with Finnick as an ally"" (how can it better MY situation?)

So Katniss has no clue on the topic of strategy, only a whole bunch of jumbed nonsense spinning around in that 16-17 year young grey matter. Like Katniss has more schizophrenic conversations in her own brain than what comes out of her mouth. Very little meaningful substance within her other than how to survive in the woods. It was Peeta who was able to converse WITH  people, dropping ""bomb shells"" on the Capitol people,while Katniss only ""twirled & giggled."" (no substance). And her inability to (play chess) use strategy, wasn't programmed into her, obsolete. She kept much information from everyone thinking only of herself and her family even if others were in jeopardy too because president snow spoke to her only. This shows that Katniss was very selfish while Peeta was the lovable boy who was selfless. Without the sub characters, Peeta, Finnick, Johanna Mason, Haymitch and even Rue, Katniss would've been loathed because of her inability to care about anyone but herself, Prim and maybe get mother. And all those years with Gale, she was so dense about him loving her, clueless.

It wasn't until (first book/movie) the game makers announced that two from the same district could both win that she thought of Peeta. But this was for HER sake, not his. It's funny that Katniss hatred being used or manipulated when she was the very one who used and manipulated everyone, but she always self justified that it was for a better benefit...her's. She damned herself each time she felt that she failed to keep her promise. Then she attacks Haymitch for failing to save Peeta because anything that benefits herself is more important than her promises that she couldn't keep. Hypocritical.

But even though these many parts of the book/movie were frustrating, and I wished that someone would slap her upside her head (thank you Johanna Mason lol) the books and movies let me ""live"" in what a dystopian world would be like.

Those of you who had previously commented wrongly need to stop comparing the real world to the way it is on Panem because everything in Panem is based on a dystopia society. The closest planet earth's various societies to compare too would maybe be China  or another ""dictatorship"" country like maybe North Korea or Syria. So please stop with the comparing your own situations to the books character situations. Both are in a separate category!

The reason for the 4-stars was these book(s) & movies took me to another place where everything is so different and entertaining. It was well written in Suzanne's direct collaboration with the director in creating Panem on screen. And even with (the books) the multitude of grammatical errors, having to re-read the sentence or paragraph to understand, this was an ever exciting movie to watch! (oh, and thank you Amazon for the lowest compared to everywhere!",1423785600,,4194,4.773793103448276

4938228,5,B0063FQREO,"Wow!  The Hunger Games certainly lives up to the hype.  I was originally informed that the movie is about children who have to kill each other to survive in an arena.  Well that was half right- it's not necessarily children (well some of them are I suppose) but it's mostly older kids and teens.  Also, I didn't know the arena is actually a forest and a field which is MUCH better than what I was envisioning the actual battlefield to be like all this time (that being, an old Egyptian-style arena for some crazy reason).

What makes this movie so great is the intensity.  The movie is incredibly intense during the first 45 minutes when the lottery drawing takes place to determine which kids/teens are headed to training camp to battle 25 other teens all doing everything in their power to survive.  There can only be 2 winners... make that 1 winner.  There's an impossible to describe amount of tension when the actual ""game"" gets underway which takes up the final 50% of the movie surprisingly enough.

This story is no game however.  It's a desperate life or death situation.  While it's obviously science fiction based on the outrageous storyline and the special effects that come into play throughout the second half concerning the way contestants are informed who's been killed/how many are left, there's a feeling of uneasiness watching kids/teens strategically kill each other so raw and aggressively.  Can you imagine the worldwide mob that would form if kids really WERE killing themselves to survive?  This isn't some kind of confusing to understand type of sci-fi either.  The storyline is so easy to follow because it's all about wondering how the events are going to play out.

Jennifer Lawrence is the star of the film.  She's absolutely *amazing* in her role too.  She has exactly the right characteristics for the part.  She's smart, she's constantly aware of her surroundings, she doesn't let emotion or other people's opinions overshadow her instincts to survive, she takes NO crap from anyone, and I'd even say she's wise beyond her years.  You can tell just by looking at the self-confidence in her eyes.  She doesn't strike me as the type that wants to be beautiful or someone who wants to fit in with the other girls- instead she strikes me as a loner determined to fulfill her mission.  It doesn't hurt that she has a talent for shooting bullseye targets either.  The bow and arrows is her best friend when the hunger game takes place.

Of course it's quite unusual that near the middle of the film there's a couple segments devoted to showing Jennifer Lawrence dressing up and looking beautiful for the purpose of a talk show interview in front of an audience.  I understand the reason behind this particular segment- to illustrate the sickness that actual killing is supposed to be some kind of game, but still.  She didn't need to look beautiful.  This interview could have occurred in a more nonchalant way after a training routine instead of a more glamorous/fake way.  By the way, how great was the part where nobody at a training party was paying attention to Jennifer's arrow-shooting skills so out of frustration she fires an arrow in their direction, lol.  They all pay attention *then!*  I was actually thinking she would've been better off deliberately missing her targets- that way she wouldn't be seen as a threat.  She could then surprise her foes when the actual game gets underway and give everyone a rude awakening.  Just a thought.

Also how awful is it that these kids/teens are dying one by one and yet, the people in charge choose to suddenly change the rules in the middle of the game.  So awful!  There's also relationship struggles written into the story non-awkwardly believe it or not, and a memorable hallucinating beehive scene that I won't spoil.  Friendships and alliances are short-lived because it's every man and woman for themselves.  The crooked people in charge of the game are just horrible, as is the fake white-faced elegant woman who's perhaps the biggest fruitcake I've ever seen.

This is just an incredible movie.  I seriously loved it.  I was skeptical at first when my dad's girlfriend described it and I honestly wasn't sure if the Hunger Games would be as good as others have said.  I'm relieved that it *is* as good as others have said!  Believe the 12,000 reviews here on amazon, most of which are really positive.  This movie will have you wondering the fate of Jennifer Lawrence's character and those she becomes friends with.  The Hunger Games has it all.",1423353600,,4534,4.803617571059432

I have never read the books so I can not comment on weather the movie is faithful to the source material. I do know that I was reluctant to see this movie because I thought it was just another YA story for the masses. I was pleasantly surprised by how much I enjoyed this film. I was of course sucked in by Jennifer's acting but I was also impressed by the production level of the film and the quality acting by the rest of the cast. I did go on to see the 2 sequels: Catching Fire and Mocking Jay Part I. I am impatiently awaiting the last film: Mocking Jay Part II.,1422576000,,642,3.9461538461538463

4938299,4,B0063FQREO,"Think teen ""Running Man"" meets ""I'm a non-celebrity get me out of here"" with shades of ""Logan's Run"" and ""Metropolis"" and you're pretty close to summarising this film. The reality show format for a sci-fi rite of passage tale is an interesting take on an old theme and, despite its obvious heritage, it works very well and feels fresh and original. Set in a post apocalyptic world where a number of `districts' have been subjugated by a vast & powerful city state, the Hunger Games are an annual event where two children are taken from each district for a gladiatorial entertainment contest and to serve as a punishment for the districts following a revolt against the city seventy four years ago. The contrast between the poverty of the districts and the opulent, decadent city serves as a splendid backdrop to the action and the entire film is engaging, the pace is almost relentless and it is surprisingly absorbing; in the two hour and twenty minute duration there is never a dull moment.

The ending, however, is a little bit disappointing. There is ultimately no moral to the tale and the underlying message seems to be that conforming to the norm and maintaining the status quo is the goal; striving for change just isn't worth the effort. Perhaps, however, that is the whole point so it could actually be a clever commentary on the superficiality of modern life. Either way, this is a very entertaining and enjoyable film. The cast are great, the action never stops and the whole flashy package is smartly executed. Excellent stuff.",1421452800,,1540,4.811320754716981

Didn't read the book so cannot comment on same. Actors were interesting and effective.  DVD 2 ruined by politics, and unending narcissistic monologues by the Director (Ross?).  It even includes a rant by an old Canadian Socialist who does Capitalistic voice overs for Florida Orange Juice.

4938332,4,B0063FQREO,"How often do you get to kick off an event? Well, if your like me not very often. So, one of the best things about The Hunger Games is its momentum. And perhaps momentum best describes this film. Jennifer Lawrence certainly has momentum as Katniss Everdeen, a coveted role that is a guaranteed star maker. Predator/Prey films always find ways of grabbing your attention and The Hunger Games is no exception. It is refreshing that this film focused on survival and not brooding, because brooding is not a great way to kick off an event.",1420934400,,534,4.631578947368421

4938409,4,B0063FQREO,"Overall, this was very well done, although I found that the director completely fails to establish the truly dismal living conditions in Katniss's sector. The book elegantly describes that they are, and have been maintained by the Capital in a relentless condition of near-starvation. The grinding, de-humanizing effects of chronic hunger are key to the the climate of the book, and it is a shame that is missing from this movie.

Of course, my other problem with the movie, is that I am not sure it needed be done at all. The book is so personal. So much of it has to do with internal reflections within Katniss, that there just isn't all that much to be added by turning it into a movie. My overall feeling is therefore: Great job everyone, but why?

What's the harm? Lots of people will miss out the pleasure of imagining in their own mind the images served ready made in the movie.",1420156800,,885,4.559748427672956

It was an almost miraculous feat that I somehow managed to watch it all the way through.

The character development was nonexistent.  As in, zero.  The writing/dialogue was so vapid and cliched that I often laughed out loud.  Even the CGI was ridiculously poorly done.

Jennifer Lawrence was fine in the starring role.  But she had no chance of salvaging this total cinematic disaster.

Presumably the novels are more compelling (I have not read them), because the overall premise clearly has some potential.  However, those responsible for the film adaptation should never be permitted to work in this medium again.",1419292800,6,736,5.008264462809917

4938537,3,B0063FQREO,"The movie, and, I assume the book it is based on (I haven't read it) is very much geared toward a young adult audience.  Most of its elements - a female heroin, young idealistic love, have general appeal but particularly for adolescents and 20-somethings.  The basic premise, at least in the movie, of sacrificing youths to memorialize victory over social strife seems far fetched as is the juxtaposition of high tech and primitive conditions.
The visuals are impressive and the plot kept my attention but I'm less inclined to watch the sequels than I might otherwise have been.",1418774400,,578,4.887755102040816

4938580,5,B0063FQREO,"All your special features are on a separate disc.  The making-of documentary is two hours long. It is split into sections (with a handy play all option) and you are taken through the entire film making process from the book being optioned, writing, casting, pre-production, shooting, post and the mania revolving around the opening weekend.  Gary Ross talks you through each section and it is so comprehensive that you do not need a commentary, which I initially was disappointed this Blu-ray did not have.  The cast members are interviewed throughout and Jennifer Lawrence is as hysterical as ever.  You learn a lot about how the movie was made, the creative options that were taken and the overall process of page to screen.  There is fun behind the scene stuff, insight into stunts and a couple of entertaining anecdotes from the cast.  Naturally I don't want to ruin it for you! This making-of alone makes it worth buying the Blu-ray.

The other features are your standard fare - just snippets of  conversations with those behind the scenes.  The best of the rest for me is actually the propaganda film.  I initially overlooked it, but anything that is narrated by Donald Sutherland is worth checking out.

Overall the 2-disc set is well worth having in your collection for any hunger games fan. The making-of is good enough you'll watch it more than once.",1418169600,,1360,4.8441558441558445

4938612,4,B0063FQREO,"This movie was, overall, a faithful adaptation of the book.  I really enjoyed the production design (the look of the world of Panem, the costumes, etc.).  The cinematography is different than what I am used to--lots of quick cuts and shaky-handheld shots, but you get used to it, and I think it fits the feel of the film.  In the book, the entire story is told from the perspective of Katniss.  They mostly maintained this in the movie, though when they did cut away from her, it was for good effect.  One great use of this was to use Caesar Flickerman and Cladius Templesmith as TV commentators who would explain certain aspects of the game or the storyworld to the audience (i.e., us).  It was a very natural, organic way to add some exposition.  Very enjoyable to watch.",1417910400,,773,4.557971014492754

4938685,4,B0063FQREO,I feel the scenes and content of kids kiling kids in order to survive was a lot for an adult who has seen a lot in her day so for kids in the world we live in today is really tough I feel and will be emotionally rough for them. It will teach them how to turn emotions off before I feel their developed enough to understand and it was rough for me and I did a job for 30 years you have to turn off. The acting and scenery really makes it real which only makes it for adults only or older teens that are emotionally ready to undertake this movie. The acting and scenery are well done and the overall making of this movie did make it feel real. The intensity of this movie would make it a 5 but I didn't like the rating so i took a star off for it.,1417392000,,745,3.8129032258064517

Crazy right?!  A clever paradox making this movie (the one before it and the sequels after) a box office success. Finally, Jennifer Lawrence is one of THE best actresses out there and though short lived (for now) Jeffrey Wright is too. Hop that his role expands should he make it to another sequel.

4938817,4,B0063FQREO,"Great movie.  Jennifer Lawrence carries it, of course.  She is always so understated, yet charismatic. She underacts, which pulls you into her unstated feelings even more.

The movie itself is a very interesting combination of color and almost black and white, stark, cold with images that look like the old 1940's pictures of dustbowl America and futuristic shapes and concepts.  Very effective.  Very moody. Highly recommended.

If you have not already, see ""Winter's Bone"", Lawrence's first film to catch a glimpse of her future stardom.  A small, dark, ugly movie, but well worth seeing.  Let me know if you see it, and what you think.",1416873600,,639,5.019047619047619

4938860,4,B0063FQREO,"When it comes to the hunger games I will admit that I fell into the category of people who had watched the movie(s) before I had even read the book and thought I had known everything based off what I saw in the cinema. I had recently read books 1-3 and my views on the movies changed. When I first watched the hunger games movies, I will admit I enjoyed them, but it is very easy to get bored with them. I didn't have a full grasp on why the franchise was so popular, because none of the characters were particularly interesting or had a persona that was easily relate-able based on what was shown on-screen.

After I read the books, I became attached to the characters. I understood what it was like to be in the thinking head of katniss. I also had faces to put to names, and body language I was able to vividly imagine in my head. The books were hard to part with because of how relate-able the characters were and how touching the emotion I felt was.

I had to watch the movies again after I had re-read the books. I without hesitation bought a 24 hour rental for the Hunger Games movie on Amazon. I needed to revisit Panem and understand what was so different about the movies. I was obsessed with finding out what made me so indifferent about whether or not I saw these movies and whether or not I truly cared what happened to the characters in them.

I was followed by much expected disappointment. Small, minuscule details bothered me, mostly because I thought I had the movie all figured out, but also because it was unnecessary to play the stories out that way. We first see Buttercup a black and white cat, when he is really orange (the color of a buttercup flower) as explained in the book. I don't know why this detail bothered me when we only see the cat once in this movie, but it did. He plays a big part in the last book, and should at least I would hope make a bigger appearance in the very last two movies.

A woman who I presume is Greasy Sae, gives katniss the mockingjay pin, and creates no significance. We don't even hear about madge. Not that her character really plays a part, but Katniss did have another friend aside from Gale, a person whom she co-existed with, was terminated from the movie, therefore we as the audience would never be able to feel the emotion behind the mockingjay pin, and instead only look at it as an insignificant bit, that had a minor exchange between prim and katniss.

The exchange between peeta and katniss was hardly filled in detail as well. All we could tell from her flash back memory was that  she was cold in the rain one day, and peeta had thrown her some bread. We never receive the context that he burnt it on purpose, and that his mother gave him a black eye for it, and that she was nearing death. We hear some what about this while they're in the games, but its a very bland conversation, and was meant for a pre-story climax, so that the characters can develop.

The only thing we knew about Katniss before they got into the games (from the movie pov) was that she was a hunter, she deeply cared for her sister, she was rude to her mother (which is because her mother mentally abandoned them after their father died, but the movie doesnt tell us this) She and gale unless truth be told otherwise were most likely going to end up being together when they were older out of the convenience and mutual relationship that just kind of worked for them.

Another thing that bothered me was the unnecessary inclusion of words that they had two weeks to win the hunger games. What? There was no mention of that in the book, if anything, it would have been easier to find some way to sneak into the script that they were in there for about a month. Because they were.

I really needed answers about this film. it saddened me because the characters never developed. Peeta is never understood to truly be hopelessly inlove with katniss. all we get is that he loved her, and before I had read the books. I thought (because of an opinion developed having only watched the movies at first) that Both Peeta and Katniss were pretending to like each other. I had thought, based off movie personas, that they would fall in love based off the act, and thats how they would end up together. Boy was I wrong. And gladly I appreciated their relationship way more after I had read the books. I secretly loathed the idea throughout my reading that they may not be together.

I highly suggest reading the books before ever considering watching this movie. The movie steps out of Katniss' head. So you don't have any forethought. All you see are facial expressions, that have no grounds. It is very confusing.

At any rate, I am giving this movie 4 stars because it really brings panem to life and helps you plug in what you don't see in film, into your imagination from what you know about the books.",1416700800,,4843,4.381959910913141

4938864,2,B0063FQREO,"I tried for the third or forth time to rent a movie on Amazon. After it timed out 7-8 times for up to a full minute each time, we gave up and rented it on iTunes- no problems there. The other rentals I've paid for on Amazon were refunded to me within a couple days, without any prompting from me, with emails from Amazon saying something like, ""We notice you had issues with your rental. We apologize and are refunding your payment."" But, I guess you have to struggle through a whole movie that times out consistently throughout to get a refund. We bailed on this one after just 15-20 minutes, knowing from experience that it would be too annoying and time-consuming. No refund offer...
So, I'll only be fully buying movies I really want on Amazon, if they offer better pricing than iTunes, from now on. Renting just doesn't work for us. I definitely blame this partly on small-town ISP. But, again, iTunes rentals work for us, so...

Its easy to see why this franchise is so popular with its target audience: downtrodden teens pitted against a decadent ruling class of adults is irresistible, but for adult audiences problems with the fundamental ideas behind the movie will probably dilute its impact. All the performances are excellent and the production values are high. The film retains a good pace throughout its 140mins and never outstays its welcome.

4938954,5,B0063FQREO,"Hunger games has brought in an awe inspiring $214 million worldwide in the last three days.  The producers are dancing for joy with their $78 million investment while the hordes of fans storm box offices around the world.  What is the point of a review?  The people, in their wisdom, in their millions have spoken.  But what the heck, it is what I do.
 I say hurrah for this extremely good, but not quite an immortal classic, film.  I literally sat on the edge of my seat through the very long (most of the movie) action sequences.  And I have read the book, at the recommendation of a movie insider friend, so there was nothing that surprised me.  I was still on pins and needles, thats how good it is as action entertainment.  For a good story to become a great story on film above all else we must like and identify with the central character.  We love Jennifer Lawrence as Katniss Everdeen (the names from the original novel by Suzanne Collins are almost Dickens-like in their sounds).  We care deeply if she succeeds or fails.  This sympathetic character is so compelling that we can safely ignore any minor flaws in the film.
 Only 21 Jennifer Lawrence has an Oscar nomination to her credit for her heroine in 2010s Winter Bone.  She also vividly brought us the young blue painted Mystique in last years X-Men: First Class.  She is still young enough to play ingnue parts successfully.  But she can do more than just be a pretty young girl.  There is a subtle ruthless under-current to her portrayal of Katniss, and not just the obvious struggle to be the single survivor in the 24 contestant death match that is the Hunger Games.  Hunger Games is based on the mega hit young adult novel of the same name by now filthy rich author Suzanne Collins.  Collins also served as executive producer and helped with the script for the movie.  In the book and film, America in the future has devolved into a Romanesque nightmare.  The common folk live in one or another of the twelve surviving districts.  District 13 has been rubbed out in revenge for a pan-district revolt against Capitol 70 odd years before current time.  As a part of the effort to suppress the souls of the commoners, each year a teenage boy and girl from each district are drafted to participate in the Hunger Games, an over produced reality TV show that forces the teens to murder one another until a single winner emerges.  The populace of Capitol all seem to be vapid fashonistias.  Imagine Hollywood agents and flacks competing with each other for most garish costumes and you have something of the sensibility and taste of the citizens of Capitol.
 Around the edges of the teen on teen killing we have a series of memorable roles by significant actors.  Donald Southerland comes and goes in brief, terrifying appearances as President Snow, who seems to be the only one in Capitol who is smart enough and evil enough to really understand the Hunger Games.  Stanley Tucci is the spot on as Caesar Flickerman, the impresario of the Hunger Games for nationwide (compulsory) TV.  Woody Harrelson plays Haymitch Abernathy, the alcoholic survivor of games-gone-by who mentors the kids from District 12.  Lenny Kravitz is the soul of kindness (and ambition) as the image maker for the district 12 contestants.  Elizabeth Banks has the most fun in an over the moon depiction of the shallow, horrible and selfish minder for the kids, Effie Trinket.  Love those names.  Finally, co-star Josh Hutcherson plays the male half of the district 12 tribute team, Peeta Mellark who wears his heart on his sleeve for Katniss.
 This four saw blade film runs a solid two hours and 22 minutes.  It is rated PG-13 for lots of not too gory dead teenagers.  I didn't much like the computer generated ravenous monsters or the confused, hand held filming of the fight scenes but thats being picky.  This is already a maga hit-as it should be.  Lawrence is only 21 and likes to work.  We will see her again and again for many years.",1415232000,,3977,4.6513629842180775

Children fight to the death in an arena.  It is a well conceived concept because it is not so distant in our modern era.  The only thing I found a let down is that for the most part of the first half of the movie, they train HARD.  Oh my, they trained in a way that would make you believe that they are extremely tough warriors and that there will be lots of cool fighting in this movie.  Nope.  Mostly everyone dies in the way in which you were to walk down a dark alley and get ambushed.  I just think it is laughable at how much they built up the idea of these children being tough warriors and having gone through intense training with lethal skills, only to die from bees.

The Hunger Games, a cheap hybrid of ""Lord of the Flies"" and ""The Truman Show"" is a stultifying, boring, predictable, sloppy morass of bad acting and a plot line that screams, ""So?""
Set in a dystopian future (isn't anyone tired of the word ""dystopian"" yet? When an author can't write he creates a dystopia. Ha! He's the dystopia...) the Hunger Games demonstrates how low the bar has been set for what passes as entertainment today.
The acting? Fair to dismal. Wow, teenagers running around with arrows and platitudes. Ooh, dramatic. And they must have offered Donald Sutherland a fortune to show his actor's face in this stupid mess.

4939020,3,B0063FQREO,"As a movie goer I saw this film for the first time at a pal's place and I can tell you now, this moved way to fast, it didn't give enough details to the story and how we came to be where we were because this reality is a very extreme example of a reality and there was just a sense of confusion and frustration at how little time was spent actually explaining why the Hunger Games existed and while no one ever rebelled.

I know many people will see this as an eye rolling statement but seriously the book was a thousand times better because it took the time to explain things. I understood FULLY what was going on where as when I saw the movie I could hardly get my damn head wrapped around this universe. They left out very very key things that came into huge character development pieces and the characters in the movie are left feeling very very hollow by comparison because they just were not given enough. They simply weren't given what they needed which was more detail. People would have sat through a longer movie for one of the highest grossing books to have come out within the last 5-6 years I promise.

In general it was okay. Again I saw the movie first before reading the books and it just left a sour taste in my mouth because the ideas were not handles well. I felt little attachement beyond basic empathy and bitterness for the situation rather than all the people involved. In short, I would still say you can watch it, probably should if you are a casual Hunger Games fan, but in general it was okay at best.",1412985600,2,1528,4.302083333333333

Bottom line: Given implausible parameters, people still act like people - a macabre, voyeuristic taste for sadism - so long as it isn't their behind. Go figure!",1412208000,,563,4.814432989690721

4939105,4,B0063FQREO,"This is a disturbing movie, and one that I am surprised qualifies for teenager/young adult status. Then again, maybe I am not so surprised.

The driver of the movie is the use of gratuitous violence as a form of mass entertainment [and secondarily as a means of oppression of the have-nots by the haves]. The obscenity of it is the forced [and sometimes not so forced] participation in the ""entertainment"" by teenagers.

This takes us to the land of social commentary populated by Animal Farm,  1984, and Fahrenheit 451. And, as such, it is very good.

I could complain about the little jumps in logic, science, etc., the story takes to create and then solve problems, conflicts, and the like in the movie [Hallucinogenic Bees?] But, you know what, these  are not major detractions.

This one is worth seeing.",1412121600,,809,4.784172661870503

I don't see the big deal about Jennifer Lawrence.  She was good in the picture but I wouldn't say great.  Woody Harrelson did a pretty good job too but he plays this kind of part in everyone of his movie.

The cinematography and art direction are top-notch, as when contrasting the gray, depression era look of District 12 and the candy colored decadence of the Capitol. Jennifer Lawrence is terrific and the casting of Woody Haralson is inspired. The rest of the cast is great as well, especially Donald Sutherland who brings a quiet, polite and terrifying menace to his role as President Snow. There is a lot of political sub-text here as well. I'm not going to get into that except to say that whether you are on the Right or Left you will see parallels to America today.

But I found it rather silly at times, particularly the depictions of the adult citizens of the big city where the contestants were taken.  If clothing like that ever came out of a Parisian fashion show, they should shoot the designers on the spot.  The kids were better dressed in this film; at least they had sensible clothing.  However, if you can get beyond the clothing problem, the plot is good and the acting excellent.  But all through this film I kept thinking, why do these people put up with this punitive annual event?  Why not put those adults with their silly clothing and wild hairdos into this very same situation, i.e., the Hunger Games?  They wouldn't last five minutes out there.  The twelve districts should have risen up in revolt a second time and this time win their war.",1411603200,,876,4.535031847133758

4939202,3,B0063FQREO,"The premise at the centre of this story is so unthinkable that it is easy to dismiss it as a work of fiction and forget that equally heinous crimes against humanity have been committed in the past and continue to happen in the present. Think of children working in sweat shops in South-East Asia; Child soldiers in Africa and elsewhere; infanticide, honour killings, genital mutilation, and lack of educational opportunities forced upon girls in many societies. Children sold into prostitution and forced labour. Remember, there was even a Childs Crusade to the Holy Land. Gladiatorial Combat fueled the Bread and Games of the Circus that led to the demise of the Roman Empire. The use of pain inflicted on others to satisfy the twisted entertainment needs of a populous. Is the continued acceptance of fighting in hockey any different? Or the popularity of Mixed Martial Arts Tournaments? Or the blood and gore that constitutes the nightly news?",1410825600,,946,5.031847133757962
4939203,4,B0063FQREO,"Predictable and formulaic, but even though knew what was coming it was still enjoyable.  Also didn't care for the unnecessary violence even though the first in the series was heavily edited for the PG-13 rating.  Did enjoy Jennifer Lawrence with her performance of a caring character with a sense of values.  My wife felt it rated three stars because of the violence.",1410739200,,367,4.887096774193548

4939208,5,B0063FQREO,"Enjoyed it. Even though it was just a movie, It made me think of during the Roman times and how the Romans loved to be entertained with violent games of the Colosseum and the killing of Christians. I wonder how far away we really are from turning back to this form of ""entertainment"".
One can only hope that history will not repeat itself and we will never choose this type of entertainment again.",1410652800,,397,4.4520547945205475
4939209,5,B0063FQREO,Great movie that we will enjoy a number of times from our collection,1410652800,,68,4.3076923076923075
4939210,5,B0063FQREO,"Good as a movie will get, but bread tossing scene could have more detail in terms of story. The book details Katniss at 11 year old is unable to feed her mother and sister, is unable to sell her sister's ragged baby clothes at the Hob, searches garbage cans in the shop district, and is yelled at by Peeta's mother for scrounging. The movies takes it from there. Also, two loaves of bread were tossed, not one loaf.

Cast, directing and editing was excellent. For example, choices Lawrence as Katniss, Banks as Effie, Ceasar and Haymitch was brilliant, memorable reaping scene is way better than in Catching Fire, where the scene was absolutely contrived and corny.

Finally, Hunger Games is a modern movie with full colors. In comparison, the sequel Catching Fire used the typical digital editing, which cause Catching Fire to have the modern shadowy and blue tinge, and parts with indoor lighting for Catching Fire hints of the modern color effect of kerosene lamp lighting or looking through a jar of yellow fluid, you know what I mean. Hunger Games in contrast, I see colors as in my present reality.",1410652800,,1104,4.744791666666667

On the trip there , they have a sponsor , He is supposed to prepare them for the games , played by Woody Haralson , but He's a poor bloke who on the train ride He can get free food an drinks instead of really telling them what they are up against . We seen all this before bits an pieces from the running man, Gladitator type gigs . It don't explain why a certain group formed so fast against the others , which is a good idea , but We have no idea who those People are. It seems this girl is a lot stronger than this older teen that came with Her. he fond of Her and that make Him weak. The Girl,  who is  good with a bow an arrow . The movie was ok . The district where the  tacky blur hair an the sets all look like a Hollywood set  !  its all  cheesy , the film seemed aimed at a young  audience  , and plays along Young girls an the co star Guy is just there to  attracts young girls  . Once I got pass that the plot is to turn these young teens into vicious killers ,as it seemed  .I  saw it on Netflix . Seems like this teen couple  pissed off Sulthland character and He has plans for them in the next film which will be better produced than this film since it made so much at the box offices  should be much more better  Ill give it 3 1/ 2 stars",1408060800,,1405,3.76027397260274

4939391,4,B0063FQREO,"I don't know the books. But I heard good things about this. So I watched it with an open mind.

I found this film to be engaging, but not ""memorable"". The story was interesting, and maybe the books fill you in about the three finger salute you'll see and give you the history of the conflict that created the 12 districts (which sounds suspiciously familiar from many other science fiction stories I've read over the last fifty years.

But I digress...

I'm not sure putting young people, especially those under 18, into a fight for life makes any kind of rational sense. It seems pointless. Clearly the older kids will prevail and the young are fodder for the ""game"".

And this story only adds fuel to the fact that at some point, given our penchant for violence, a very real progress toward a game in which someone actually does die lies in our future.

At it's worst, this is just another dystopian future portraying the best and worst of humanity in yet another arena where life and death are the inevitable end of the journey.",1407715200,,1031,4.551351351351351

4939425,4,B0063FQREO,"I do not know how to put in another half a start but 4.5 would be my rating.  Bread and circuses are the recipe the Capitol uses to amuse the ruling class and keep the districts in line.  The circus is nothing but stress and death for the districts and the bread is scarce for most. Very strong acting performances from the primary actors, especially Jennifer Lawrence as Katniss, who reflected a spectrum of emotions from within a girl who'd been forced to be strong and even grim at times for the sake of her emotionally wounded family.  I didn't know she had it in her to be that good.  The choice of scenery that echoes Nazi Germany and the Great Depression at the beginning of the movie immediately gives that dystopian feel to things...and the pomp and pageantry that the people of the Capitol enjoy along with modern creature comforts make the great contrast apparent right away.  Donald Sutherland makes the most of his character.  I was unhappy with Elizabeth Bank's parody of a parody of Effie, surely such a buffoon would not remain as the official representative to the Panem districts for long!  We would have liked more Cinna and more of almost everything...I would have given five stars for a thee hour movie that gave us more of the tributes being prepared AND fighting to live.  There was room to explore the uneasy alliances between tributes and the preparation phase of the ritual.  I also wish someone taught Jennifer how to hold a bowstring properly (farther out on the fingertips, not with one digit wrapped around the string) but the ""arrow in the apple"" scene was brilliant as she missed the first shot and corrected with the second, which is what you would expect from an expert with a new weapon.

My wife and I (and our kids) read the books.  The movie is pretty consistent with the novel - movie shortcutting is inevitable - so no huge changes made to the basic plot.  It was almost two and a half hours so choosing cuts was important.  I think the three-book series should have been a five movie presentation so that we could have scrunched more into that first movie and end it with the victory of the two District 12 tributes.  Again, if it had been three hours long we would have been more than happy to watch it, the movie captured us from beginning to end!",1407196800,,2290,4.54014598540146

It has everything you want in pure movie escapism.  Jennifer Lawrence, again, proves what a major talent she is.

4939431,5,B0063FQREO,"I was pretty sure I didn't want to watch this movie after reading the novels. The novels were excellently written, and also very stark and brutal.

I'm glad, though, that I did see this movie. While not as explicitly brutal as the novels, it's also not sugar-coating anything and does an excellent job of hitting the main points of the book and making them work on film.

Lawrence is especially great here. Her Katniss is somewhat less of a cipher than the Katniss of the novels, but that's appropriate for a movie.

Obviously, the novel is more nuanced. But the filmmakers did an excellent job of translating it to film, especially in choosing Lawrence as Katniss.

If you found the books compelling, I don't think you'll be too disappointed in the film version. If you found them compelling but overwhelming- well, the film version is somewhat less explicitly brutal, while not glossing over much.

This is one of the better film adaptations of a novel that I have seen.",1407024000,,972,4.727810650887574

The movies are good, however they do not develop Katniss' home life enough to understand the relationship with her mother, sister, Gail nor life in the districts.

4939531,1,B0063FQREO,A bad love story.  Though it is quite true at how far the government will go to manipulate TV and the people to keep them subdued and where they want them.  It wasn't about hunger at all as nobody goes hungry but it probably wouldn't have made it to the box office if it had been called Killing Games.  The disparity between the rich and poor are most likely lost on a large majority of viewers.,1405555200,2,395,4.171052631578948

4939551,3,B0063FQREO,Keep in mind I am 66 years old. The experience of younger people will probably be different. I was disturbed by the theme of the movie; children killing other children to survive. But it made clear that all was not rosy for the survivors. A bit predictable in some areas but Jennifer Lawrence was so good in her role.  It probably deserves another star but because of the graphic portrayals and theme I gave it 3. Anyone under 18 should not see this movie. The futurestic view of our world makes one think.,1405036800,,506,4.440860215053763

4939575,3,B0063FQREO,"While the film is competently acted, almost everything else about it is atrocious.  Since I haven't read the novels, I can't speak to the faithfulness in comparison with the source material, but for a book that supposed to be rather violent, the movie was very tame.  My biggest complaint would be the shaky-camera work, which, while useful in creating a sense of intensity or confusion, is quite headache-inducing and more importantly, obscures the action.  Among the positives were Elizabeth Banks and Woody Harrelson, who I felt gave rather entertaining performances, and the lighter, more humorous bits of the film were more enjoyable to watch.  In regards to the preparation for the Games, I take issue with the backdrop of the whole affair, as it reeks of so-called ""reality"" TV, which I despise.  But overall, I felt like this movie was like a watered-down rip-off of Battle Royale, without half of the emotional depth and pretty much none of the visceral content.",1404777600,,971,5.0062111801242235

I'm torn in my decision. If I were just rating this as a movie, stand alone, it's not bad. I'm a little disturbed at the concept of kids killing each other for simple sport, but the plot moved along well, I would watch ANYTHING with Stanley Tucci, and overall it was a pretty decent film. On the flip side, the parent aspect of me is horrified that this movie was rated PG-13, given the graphic hack and slash scenes in the actual competition. Granted, I haven't actually read the books, but I know they are youth based and I thought the film was too violent for the PG-13 rating. Just my opinion tho.",1404691200,,618,4.3826086956521735

4939635,1,B0063FQREO,"I must confess I was already biased against this movie since before its premiere when I heard the critic clique and the media parrot multitude making a big fuss out of it as compared to the ""bad"" John Carter (a long overdue movie about a SciFi classic whose steps were followed by George Lucas from start and which further development was aborted for good due to the bad propaganda since they actually killed John Carter by driving the sheeple away from it and to see this... well, I finally decided to watch it here since it won't cost me a dime and I could have an objective opinion, contrary to those who passed John Carter and had to content themselves with the critic's opinion. So I started seeing the movie, it wasn't too bad until the real ""action"" started. Seriously guys, if you find amusement in ""kids killing kids"" you REALLY need to seek professional help. No wonder we have so many mass shootings involving ""kids"" if this sort of cruelty is what the media is feeding them. On the other hand, it may be seen as a rebuff to the gun-control crowd, hee a lot of senseless carnage was done without firing a single shot. I could only hold until two-thirds of the movie before jumping to the frustrating end. I couldn't taking anymore. This said, the performances were so good they made me puke, so if the purpose of this movie is to be a vomit inducer it actually does it.",1403568000,4,1380,4.458498023715415

However, the Hunger Games was written almost as if it was designed to be put on the big screen.  With only minor changes to the story to make things more dramatic for the movie, The Hunger Games succeeded as a movie, beyond any expectation I would have had.

Plus, it has Jennifer Lawrence in it.... how can you go wrong?  ^_^",1403481600,5,449,4.174418604651163

I thought it would be a movie with a lot of killing machines and no human feelings involved. Very well done and directed movie. The acting was also excellent.,1403481600,,245,4.590909090909091

4939645,4,B0063FQREO,"I saw many similarities to the events of the 1900s Soviet Union more than a conquering nation occupying another (e.g. Germany/France of the 1940s) - ruling elite (Politburo/Russians) controlling the distribution of resources, poor class (outer districts or was that Eastern Europe?) fighting for daily existence.",1403481600,,312,5.804347826086956

How it could be.

Are you tired of all of the propaganda, programming, and lies in Hollywood filth?

This movie is a rare refreshment among the filth of Hollywood.

4939647,4,B0063FQREO,"Before seeing Catching Fire, I thought this movie was the bomb.com. But after seeing Catching Fire, I started to notice some things about this movie that wasn't really happy about. I just saw this movie today to refresh my memory on what all happened.
Plot: The movie didn't stay too true to the book. The whole Mockingjay story was totally fake, the Avoxes, Madge, and the hovercraft picking up tributes weren't there at all, and for the love of God, can you please get Buttercup right? Also, the scene where Katniss asks Gale how many times he put his name in the reaping would go right over your head if you haven't read the book. The mutts don't resemble the tributes like in the book. Also, why does nobody look hungry? It's the damn HUNGER GAMES, for God's sake! Finally, I will send you a challenge: try to look for a tribute that when they die, don't have open eyes (except for Marvel).
Cinematography: I will create an entire category just for the fact that the hand-held camera scheme DROVE ME NUTS!!! Almost every shot had shaky cam in it! I saw in an article that Gary Ross did that because he wanted the experience of the Games to ""feel real"". Well may I say on the behalf of the Men in Tights: ""*cough* Bulls***!"" The scenes that exclude the actual Hunger Games was shaky! It's like trying to record something, while someone is actually shaking you! I'm starting to believe that that's what happened!
Acting: The acting was pretty good for the most part, although in Catching Fire everyone does a much better performance.
Special Effects: For being a big budget movie I had to say the effects were pretty lame. I was hoping the movie would be a lot more gritty and violent like the book, but I was wasn't surprised when it got so much money for being a PG-13. The fire effects were really unimpressive, unlike Catching Fire. The only cool things I saw was the capitol buildings and the mutts rising from the ground.
Costuming: The costumes for the capitol were outlandish which is really cool, because that's what I actually expected. Katniss' dress for  interview wasn't for me though.
Music: Woodsy and natural for District 12 and flimsy and outlandish for the capitol was adequate. Definitely not James Newton Howard's best work at all. The only pieces that I liked from the score was Rue' s death, flower covering and uprising in 11, the Katniss/Peers/Cato fight scene, and the Reaping, although they lost me when the trumpets came out. Look up on YouTube ""The Fog"". At 2:50 it really starts getting  good and 3:23 that's where the similarities start. They used violins as the dominant instrument rather than the trumpets at 4:00, which is a HUGE improvement.
In conclusion, I think that 3 out of 5 is VERY generous, and although Catching Fire is a WAY better movie, you should see this movie first.",1403395200,,2817,4.632
4939648,5,B0063FQREO,I was pleasantly surprised by this movie  I thought it was going to be much more violent and graphic than it was as I was expecting to have to turn it off but I didn't and enjoyed it to the end!,1403395200,,194,3.731707317073171

4939654,5,B0063FQREO,This is one of the best movies I've seen in along time. Similar in plot to a couple others but that's where the similarities end. Don't be discouraged by the 1st 20-30 minutes. All good movies want you to know the characters. I've watch 4 or 5 times and will again.,1403395200,,265,4.215686274509804

I was suppose to see this movie a long time ago in theaters but I just never got around to it. This movie was actually the first thing I watched when I actively started making use of my prime membership streaming videos. From beginning to end this movie had all my attention . In a way the things that happened in this movie actually feels like a reality even though it's not. Even though it's free to stream, I think I will still buy this movie. One of the best movies I've seen in a while. This movie will make you feel every emotion at least once .",1403395200,,643,4.070866141732283
4939656,4,B0063FQREO,"This film takes the viewer away to a different world: a militarized state dominated by the rich who periodically and gratuitously ask the impossible of its young citizens: after a lottery drawing selecting a male and female from each district, they must participate in a bloody fight to the death, much of which is televised, with one victor. Once the film gets past ""The Reaping"", the pageantry, and the trials, much of which seems to be a lot of vamping, the action, as expected, picks up considerably in the woods with some great developments and team formations. The film's vicarious on-the-scene hidden cameras for the viewing of the nation's audience show some similarity to ""The Truman Show"" cameras. Jennifer Lawrence with her exotic good looks, fine shape, energy, and attitude is mesmerizing as Katniss Everdeen and was only one movie away from winning a Best Actress Academy Award by way of ""Silver Linings Playbook"". ""The Hunger Games"" also stars Woody Harrelson, Elizabeth Banks, Donald Sutherland, and Stanley Tucci who steal their scenes consistently, as well. This is a superb Sci-Fi film that is Very Definitely Recommended. Four COMPELLING stars! (Amazon Prime Video; Time-2:22)",1403308800,2,1196,5.2020725388601035

4939663,3,B0063FQREO,"i suppose the raves for this film were mainly due to all the action, and the star, Jennifer Lawrence, the cumulative attraction thereof
i won't try to deny.  however, though i watched it, and pretty much enjoyed it, i noticed over and over, my attention to the action or
plotting being interrupted by unnecessary breaks in the flow.  i really think those breaks should have for the most part been noted and seen to by the writer and director working together.  some breaks could have been easily forgiven as a matter of taste and opinion... but so many?  it's as if the intelligence of the audience was demeaned by the inattention to detail.  i was not impressed.
to those who loved this film, i can see why... but cannot agree.  to those who want a 'for instance', i say, 'watch it again' more critically, attuned to the places where something doesn't make sense.  those instances are 'breaks in the flow' of the film.  a few are ok, a lot are not, IMO. pip - [alapip.deviantart.com]",1403222400,,984,4.582857142857143

 Most of it is just plan dumb, but I guess that's what most people like today and good movies are seen by vary few people because they don't kill enough people or blow enough things up for them.

4939728,5,B0063FQREO,"With all of the hype that I've heard about The Hunger Games franchise, I had to find out for myself just what it was all about.  I really loved this movie too -- it wasn't too long, nor too short.  Each actor/actress went the extra mile to get their storylines across.  I loved some of the lines that Jennifer Lawrence said -- my favorite one being ""I volunteer as tribute!""  She says her lines with such fierceness, poise and restraint, yet it's enough to have a devastating, brilliant effect on the audience.  Donald Sutherland's character is a very mean you-know-what, but because he carries out his ""President Snow"" role so well, I'm willing to look past his brutal personality.

On the second disc of this set, director Gary Ross and the producers go into extreme detail about how they created this movie and why.  And because I bought this movie from Target, it also came exclusive with a third disc, which consists of the ""tributes""/cast character interviews and diary videos.  And it only cost me $13!  :)  It's practically a steal, but it's worth it for the serious fans.

I did hear that a third AND fourth sequel of The Hunger Games was coming out in the next 2 or 3 years -- so please feel free to correct me if I'm wrong!  Oh, and may the odds be EVER in your favor!  :)  (That's my other favorite line from the movie...)",1401753600,3,1334,4.458677685950414

I have not read the books, so wasn't up on the storyline, but found it interesting and looking forward to the next one. All of fan postings after the first one regarding casting was a turn off. But, I watched anyway and was pleasantly surprised.",1401753600,,313,4.607142857142857
4939732,3,B0063FQREO,"But I don't mean that as a knock against the film. I realize now - after having seen it - that I wasn't the target demographic. Just as my elders scratched their heads when I was spouting jubilantly about Star Wars back in 1977, I do so now with a production like this. I know how it goes and accept that the older I get, the less Hollywood cares for my dollar. That said, the film gets a passing grade for it's technical merits, and the somber tone of the dystopian society comes across nicely without overdoing it. There was balance to the storytelling, not too sappy, not too violent, and the actors performances were top notch. Since I am as old as I am, I can't look at this film with wonderment because I've seen so many like it. Within the last hour of ""Hunger Games"" I got the impression that I was watching a blend of ""Rollerball"", ""Tron"", ""Running Man"" and ""Ender's Game"". If this review comes across as being unfair that is my fault because I want to be fair. That's why I prefaced it with my allusion to my age. If I were younger, I would have been impacted well-enough to want to see this one again.",1401753600,,1112,4.274881516587678
4939733,5,B0063FQREO,"This is one of my favorite book-turned-to-movie adaptations. I felt that the movie stayed true to the story. Yeah, few important elements from the book were left out, but it seems that they've done a good job of telling the story for people who haven't read the books.

I was really worried when I heard that they were going to make this book into a movie, because the book was so introspective to Katniss' experience. But I was really pleased when I saw what they've done with it. You see the differences between the people living in the outer districts, and those of the Capitol, especially how outrageous their lives seem compared to those of Disctrict 12. And there are so many characters to get to know.

The cast did a superb job in their portrayals of these characters. You see Effie really begin to love being assigned to this district, you see Haymitch believe in Katniss and Peeta, you see the two of them really working hard to play their part, and you see Cinna be a real support to Katniss.

I think it was cast perfectly and the production of the film was great.",1401667200,,1076,4.479591836734694

4939737,5,B0063FQREO,I really liked it. I think it has a really strong message about life. With the super rich being the people in capital city who watch the games and call it a sport. The pigs of socieity who only care about themselves and want to see a blood bath. The poor incconent people who just want to live in peace in the districts. As a history nerd it reminded me a lot about ancient Rome  With the galaditor games and the slaves who are forced to fight to death. Also the 1920's with the super rich and how they lived and dressed.,1401580800,,521,4.107843137254902

The film manages to do this very nicely and the action is non-stop. The only parts of the movie that might not be clear without reading the book is the relationship between Katniss and Peeta and Katniss and Gale, and the mine explosion that had such a devastating impact on Katniss's mother. Also, no one in District 12 really looks like they are starving, and some might wonder how such a poor district could afford to have a bakery where Peeta is decorating cakes! but this is explained in the book.

I have to wonder as our capital is requiring more and more ""taxes"" in money and resources to feed its huge appetite are we evolving into our own form of Hunger Games....the acting was very good and it followed the book fairly closely.  Repression and suppression of people will ultimately fail.  The movie echoed that sentiment.",1400371200,,349,4.88135593220339

The special effects were amazing and yet in keeping with and plot of the story, at times unsettling.  I rewatched the video because as I thought about it, I wanted to be sure that I caught all the details.  I only give 5 stars to the videos that I like well enough to purchase so it is possible that in the future I will change my rating.  I would caution that this is not a story for children.

4939841,1,B0063FQREO,"Kiddish best describes this movie with its thread line that adults are stupid, self absorbed, warring fools and kids are somehow bright, intelligent, and well reasoned is designed and purposed for information warfare against unsuspecting minds. The Willie Wonka styles worn by adults are distracting and annoying at best.  The battle ground is managed remotely through technology by game planners in order to direct the game in interesting ways for the adult audience. Who ever dreamed up this nonsense should be psychologically evaluated and committed. The message that war is an innate trait in humans and in order to avoid wars in the natural world, the innate need can be fulfilled through entertainment is nonsense.  The twist of denying the audience of their need through mutually assured destruction (M.A.D.) is utterly looney. The fact, that an inexperienced kid comes up with this novel solution is beyond fantasy and that adults twist it again into M.A.D. for love is even more nutty. The stylistic approach of the movie impresses me as being of Asian origins and minds. Romeo and Juliet was more entertaining. At least, in that movie Juliet's boobs can be seen. The movie is out-of-touch with the true human condition and conveys no redeeming message.",1399593600,3,1262,5.121359223300971
4939842,2,B0063FQREO,it was a slow boring start but picked up slightly. my older daughter fell asleep on it the first time she tried to watch it.  it may be best to read the book but movie was not good.,1399593600,,181,3.763157894736842

This film is done extremely well and I have come to love Jennifer Lawrence.  Never heard of her before this movie, but now she is popping up all over the place in many different types of movies.  So far, there is not a movie she has been in that I do not like.  I recommend that you read the books before you see the movies in the Hunger Games Trilogy.  In this case, I thinks the films follow the books quite well.",1399248000,,547,3.9724770642201834
4939856,5,B0063FQREO,"This movie is SO GOOD! Jennifer Lawrence is phenomenal in the role of Katniss, and I fell in love with Peeta because of Josh Hutcherson.

4939863,4,B0063FQREO,"I liked the Hunger Games video because it emphasized two fundamental themes which I appreciate. One, it highlights governmental control over food production and control of the nutrients produced. It seems like even today that we are eager to trade self determination for easy of existence. Two, it shows that one person can make a big difference in political and social business. The good people win!",1399075200,,400,5.075757575757576
4939864,5,B0063FQREO,I was not ever going to see this movie. I felt it was probably not worth seeing it. I figured it was going to be some stupid thing like some far out fictional story line. It really was a good flick and good acting as well. it met certain things of the future to contain war and what people might consider doing at some point to keep from having war. Many older movies have used similar dialogue in the past but this was a good movie.,1399075200,,433,4.046511627906977

I felt there was too much violence however, with kids killing kids.",1398988800,,194,4.514285714285714
4939869,4,B0063FQREO,"This is not a movie for adolescents without parental input.  The violence in here, though part of a larger story, is extreme and needs to be presented within the context of the bigger story of the ""Revolt"" that occurred several decades previously and has resulted in an oppressive, totalitarian society exacting revenge upon its citizens.  The movie is very well done.  I wish a little more groundwork had been presented in the opening scenes.",1398988800,,443,4.95945945945946

4939875,5,B0063FQREO,The movie that establishes the franchize has to be excellent; and it is great. Watching it on my iPhone while I am winding down after working night shift even better.,1398902400,,166,4.566666666666666
4939876,5,B0063FQREO,It was wonderful to see the book come to life on screen. I only wish they would of put a little more of the games in the film. The book definitely portrayed more of a struggle for each of the characters.,1398816000,,203,3.975609756097561

4939878,3,B0063FQREO,"It was a bit ""wordy"" in places, which in turn made it a longer movie than it needed to be.  The action was good but had to many lulls as the actors/actress did to much talking.  This is an older movie but it is entertaining enough to view even at this date.",1398816000,,257,3.923076923076923

4939880,5,B0063FQREO,Jennifer Lawrence was great.  I never read the books. I really liked the movie. Can't wait to see the second installment,1398816000,,120,4.714285714285714
4939881,4,B0063FQREO,Really enjoyed it but I found that there were several areas that I would not have really understood had I not read the  book first.,1398816000,,131,4.24
4939882,1,B0063FQREO,Why would anyone make such a horrific movie. It makes violence acceptable to our kids. You can see why violence is so rampant in our schools today,1398816000,2,146,4.444444444444445
4939883,5,B0063FQREO,Great movie.  Really kept my attention throughout.  I would recommend to people who usually don't watch this type of movie.  You might be surprised that you like it.,1398816000,,165,4.821428571428571
4939884,3,B0063FQREO,"After watching the previews for this movie, I watched it with much anticipation.  I thought it was going to be a great movie.  In the end, it sadly didn't live up to my expectations.  Now don't get me wrong, there was plenty of violence, suspense, the acting was pretty good, and it left you wondering what would happen next.  Those weren't the main problems I had with the movie.  I felt that because of the targeted audience the makers of the movie tamed it down a little bit.  There was at least one, if not more, of the contestants that died off screen and all you heard was the blast that indicated another contestant had been killed off.  I also hated the scene where one of the move ruthless characters had a knife up to Katniss neck and instead of killing her, which she clearly had no problems doing, decides to take the opportunity to have a little chat with her.  In the movie world thats a recipe for allowing the protagonist an opportunity to escape.  Which, of course, happened seconds later.  There were plenty of other things that I didn't like about the movie, which I won't get into, but I think Ive addressed the point that this movie was far from perfect.  It was enjoyable and entertaining at times, slow at other times, but overall did not live up to my expectations.

4939895,4,B0063FQREO,I've seen this twice with my husband and we have enjoyed it both times. Dystopian theme but timely considering the intrusiveness of our government over the last couple of years. The idea of these young people killing each other was not that enjoyable but it goes with this kind of thematic movie.,1398643200,,296,4.711538461538462

4939897,5,B0063FQREO,"I've watched this movie several times and each time the character of Rue brings me to tears, as well as Jennifer Lawrence's performance in the scenes with her. Injustice, in any form, is hard to oppose when those at the top can trample those at the bottom with impunity.  In particular, I'm amazed by the author's and movie's portrayal of Katniss as the clueless heroine who truly can't see beyond Peeta's & hers survival. This is so consistent with many of our youth of today. Perhaps it's social media which encourages self-ingratiating perspectives that seldom look farther than what to wear and how to clone oneself into your peers. So I've encouraged my 14 yr-old daughter (who must have hundreds of selfies to watch  the movie with me to understand that there's a bigger world out there with young people who struggle just to see each new day. Great and sensational movie but the underlying meaning is more important if you can get teens (and future leaders of our society) to look beyond the obvious themes and see the relationship to their own lives and each person's impact on the world around them.",1398643200,,1108,4.7357512953367875

Intricate and entertaining story. but clearly the author and the movie makers in an effort to get that wonderful demographic of young people made the characters old just mostly too young. The idea of having 12 year olds fighting against 17 year old is just flat silly and may the story very unbelievable. But you got your high school boys so I guess it's okay. with an older and more believable cast I would have given it 5 stars. But the casting which was old against young just reminded me of those stupid movies that came out in the early 70's with people like Christopher Jones.

4939959,5,B0063FQREO,"Though movies cannot and usually do not depict all that one reads in a book, this movie seemed more authentic to the parts it could include. It is a good movie for the family to watch together.  And, it helps my preteen grandchildren to understand the value of their reading assignments.",1398038400,,287,4.627450980392157
4939960,3,B0063FQREO,"There were descriptive details that the book just did better and more details on the book. Movie was very good and true to book as far as it went, but if you read book you could be in for a disappointment. I did like seeing the city and the arena controllers and the dress of the Capital.",1398038400,,288,4.0701754385964914

4939963,4,B0063FQREO,It was an interesting movie with unexpected twist but personally I did not like so much violence for young people,1397952000,,113,4.7
4939964,4,B0063FQREO,"Well done (acting, cinematography, special effects, etc.) considering the 'fanciful"" plot.  I guess a little more attention to setting the stage for the story and touching on what happens next would have helped, but a higher rating would have required a better fit with the viewer's taste in science fiction.",1397952000,,308,5.16

But to be honest, I expect more things in this movie, it didn't surprise me at all, sounds like it a great movie, but it's actually just a normal one.",1397865600,,345,4.149253731343284

4939975,5,B0063FQREO,"The characters are sympathetic and believable; the plot is so real it could be used to describe many situations now occurring around the world; the outcome, unfortunately for the impatient, is the perfect teaser for the second book/movie.

It wasn't until a few months ago that I noticed it on Netflix so out of boredom one night I turned it on and was immediately hooked!  I've since purchased and read the 3 book series as well as Catching Fire (part 2) Jennifer Lawrence does an amazing job of playing the heroin Katness. In fact the entire cast is amazing and the story line is very compelling. Mockingjay is due to come out a week before Thanksgiving this year (2014) and I can't wait!  One of my all time favorite movies now!  Highly recommend!",1397692800,,579,4.333333333333333

Great experience overall.",1397692800,,146,6.35
4939986,2,B0063FQREO,I can't believe this movie became a huge hit! It seems like a very predictable and too much kid violence. Most kids don't need help these days wih that.,1397692800,,152,4.275862068965517
4939996,2,B0063FQREO,The story just didn't gel for me. I felt it was asking me to believe in a premise that was too removed from reality.,1397692800,,116,3.875
4939997,4,B0063FQREO,"I liked this action-futuristic drama for its unusual theme, suspense, & action.  It is an interesting representation on how people might react in stressful situations they have no control over, & live in fear every day.  Though it has a violent theme, it shows people can also be kind, self-sacrificing, & stronger than they knew they were.  It shows what can happen when a few ""rulers"" lay down horrible rules, find killing amusing, & humans expendable entertainment.  The heroine portrays many of humanity's finer qualities, while finding her inner strength, using her skills, & making the best of a horrible situation.  I look forward to watching the second installment of this trilogy, & have heard from friends it is even better.  I wouldn't recommend it for viewers younger than 14 due to its violent content using children & young people about their same age.  Innocence is lost soon enough for our youth; this portrayal of youthful violence I think is a bit too much for the younger set.",1397692800,,995,4.886904761904762
4939998,4,B0063FQREO,"I read the trilogy before the movies came out and loved the books. I was skeptical that the movie would catch the mood of the books and was ready for liberties to be taken with the story line in the interest of time and getting in as many explosions and as much fighting as possible. I was pleasantly surprised that this was not the case. I do think knowing the story already helped in the understanding of the different districts, how the Capital residents respond and why they look like they do. But most of the backstory was represented such as Peta giving bread to Katniss, her relationship with Gayle and why she knew how to hunt. A very unique story, I would highly recommend it.",1397606400,,685,4.444444444444445
4939999,1,B0063FQREO,"Hunger Games falls short as it jumps back and forth like a child with diagnosed ADHD on a sugar high, skipping scenes and going to kids pawing at each other then BLUR away for the kill. It doesn't describe more about the society at large more then they are poor..That's it. Sure there are games of death but what ever, they are poor. My favorite part has to be when the guy volunteers because he wants her, and gave her a piece of bread..WOW That is the way into anyone's pants..a Smile and a Hershey bar...Oh wait that was Vietnam. The rest of the story blows they just hide, fight.. She gets high on bees does the boy when she finds him again, try to kill them selves. This is the essence of a teen movie..But for some reason they pushed a much more adult idea of murder and fighting along side the romance and fear..Well I say fear though you never see it on screen from Katnis(Dear lord I can't wait to see all the kids named this, what retarded meth-ed up rat came up with that name.), she never shows fear, and she is obviously 21, the rest of the kids are younger and at a huge disadvantage, no wonder she doesn't die shes the oldest most experienced person..But that won't stop her from going after some young lovin' from the baker's son..Who is oh so happy to indulge.. I am sure she gets knocked up after this, but it will turn into a WHO'S THE DAD situation..Mamma Mia..Twilight..Its..All the same. Anyway if you can't handle senseless killing where it doesn't even really show it.. Teenage strange lovin'.. The actress playing a bad role, bad special effects (Im talking you 1996 flaming dress) and a retarded cast..Then stay away from this movie.",1397606400,2,1659,4.4605263157894735

4940014,1,B0063FQREO,"What a hideous, hideous concept for a book.  I read the whole series after my 12-year-old daughter had done so just to see what all the hype was about and decide if the movies were appropriate for her.  If I'd read them first, I wouldn't have allowed her to do so.  The storyline is nauseating -- children pitted against each other in an arena fight to the death.  Horrible!  The fact that 'all the kids' are reading these and loving them is almost as disturbing as the books themselves.",1397520000,5,487,4.426966292134831

4940054,4,B0063FQREO,"Loved the acting. The whole idea is contrived and unrealistic but the acting makes up for it Donald Sutherland is great on it as well as the main protagonists. They make you believe the story and make the story itself come alive. I found myself rooting for the underdog at first as expected but the touching story of self-sacrifice, the drive to survive and the dislike of the portrayed aggression made me stay and watch every bit of it. Stanley Tucci's role provided unexpected comic relief. I want a hard copy!",1397520000,6,512,4.637362637362638

4940061,2,B0063FQREO,children on children violence is not appealing at all. It was easy to tell who would win in the first 5 minutes of the movie and the outcome of the love story was predictable. The idea of the story was interesting but the violence was a complete turnoff. Costumes and makeup were amazing and worthy of award.,1397433600,,308,4.421052631578948

4940075,5,B0063FQREO,"This is a very thought provoking movie. This reveals what happens when the government ""elite"" use the people they govern for their own amusement.

4940079,4,B0063FQREO,Hunger Games is a very good film. The real joy is watching Jennifer Lawrence. She is a wonderful actress and she brings the script to life.

I can say she is no girly girl at all and I like that cause I'm not a girly girl either. I would recommend this movie to anyone and the book's are amazing too. I think out of all the book's I've read so far Hunger games series are up there with the Harry Potter series. I think the only down fall I have is the stupid love triangle.,1397260800,,457,3.7708333333333335

4940132,2,B0063FQREO,"What doomed this movie was the low budget.  While the book had its moments of cliche and trope abuse, it also managed to put a spin on most of them.  The film?  Not so much.

This is not a movie that can be enjoyed by someone who didn't read the book.  Too much of the background, exploration of the setting (if one doesn't know about District 13, the reason for the Games falls apart.), of the characters, was scuttled.

In every instance where we're supposed to be overwhelmed by the decadence of the Capital, the jaded elite who view the Games and make their livings by it, the movie manages to trip over its own feet and fall flat.  The entire train sequence, where Katniss and Peeta are supposed to be overwhelmed by the sheer luxury and the sheer amount of food available flopped--because what we saw looked more like the free continental breakfast you get at a Comfort Inn.  All of the key relationships have been scraped down to the bare bones development-wise.  A movie viewer gets *no* sense of why Katniss and her mother have the relationship they do, why some people put their names in for consideration more than once (a critical detail!)  Effie's character was reduced to a mere caricature, which was criminally stupid.  Donald Sutherland was *wasted* in this movie.  I hope he got a lot of money to make up for having to perform such a narrow, limited role.  The real horror of the dogs (muttations, to use the book's term), even the arena itself, got whitewashed.  Oddly, I'm most disappointed in the presentation of the Cornucopia--I was expecting a huge golden structure, not something that looked like it got dragged out of a railyard scrap heap.

The only thing that made me sit up and take notice was the riot in District 11.  That, and Cato's penultimate scene at the Cornucopia--I actually felt sorry for him.  The soundtrack/score tried very hard to deliver, but at its best, it never went beyond late-80's one-hit wonder level.

I saw this for free through Amazon Prime.  I got what I paid for:  nothing.",1396915200,,2029,4.630252100840337

4940139,4,B0063FQREO,Followed the book well(suggest you read). A little dark but very touching. Very well acted and wonderful costumes. If you enjoy some action and don't mind people being killed to tell a good story worth a watch.,1396915200,,210,4.702702702702703

I ended up looking up the book trilogy it was based on and promptly read all three - they were quite good, even if written for teenagers.

I thought the movie was really good - sometimes hard to watch because of the suspense, at least for me, but then again I'm told I'm a light weight when it comes to that sort of thing.",1396828800,,483,4.204301075268817

It centers around the girl for most, if not all, of the movie. This is a teen's flick all in all.

4940175,1,B0063FQREO,"Naturally, the movie isn't as good as the book, that's usually the case and we all know that going in; it's unrealistic to expect the movie to be just as good as the book. However, I suppose I had higher expectations for this movie going in because of Peter Jackson's work on the LOTR trilogy. My thought was that since Peter Jackson could condense such a complex world into such good movies, couldn't an experienced screenwriter/author such as Suzanne Collins, author of the books themselves, which are nowhere near as complex as the world or story in LOTR, could do the same? Not quite, apparently.

Clearly, an effort was made to bridge the gap between book and movie. I would have given the theatrical movie 3.5 stars; it was worth seeing because the actors gave wonderful performances and it had a visual impact that the book didn't, as well as scenes that were not in the book that enhanced the story. It doesn't stand on its own though, it's more of a companion to the novel, like illustrated pictures that move and speak. However, they cut scenes from the DVD that were in the movie, some that had been in the book and some that were not, but all things that made the movie worth seeing. Everything certainly would have fit on the disc, so I just cannot make sense of why they were cut from the DVD.

Initially, the thing that annoyed me about the movie was the loss of the true story of the Mockingjay pin. However, there are some things in the movie that were either not in or you couldn't get from the book. The real reason to watch the movie is to get a visual representation of the book's scenes. Not because children killing children is at all glamorous or fun, it's not. It's because while it's horrific enough to read about, the full horror comes home to you when you see it played out on screen. It's a little like the difference between hearing about the Titanic sinking and watching the movie ""Titanic,"" but more like the difference between hearing about the Holocaust and watching ""Schindler's List,"" or hearing about slavery and watching ""Roots.""

But I have to go back to the pin. So much is made of the pin in the book that I can't understand why they changed its story in the movie. I certainly don't understand how they could refer to it as if it were something of a ""good luck charm"" after the way it was used in the movie. Katniss finds it randomly in the Hob and gives it to her sister Prim for ""protection"" right before Prim's first Reaping. Immediately thereafter, Prim, whose name is only entered once in the Reaping, is chosen as tribute from among hundreds of names. Prim then gives the pin back to Katniss for ""protection"" in the games. Really? After the poor protection the pin gave Prim that's more like a sinister Greek tragedy than sisterly love. After Prim was chosen, they should have thrown the thing into the fire at Mount Doom. That plot change was ridiculous.

Because it was completely changed and diminished in the movie, the real story of the pin isn't even a SPOILER- unless you haven't read and still plan to read the books. This is the actual story of the pin. If your first instinct is to roll your eyes, let me ask you this: can you imagine the Lord of the Rings with the story of the One Ring changed and Gollum cut out? Again, this next part is only a SPOILER if you haven't read the book; because it's not in either of the first 2 movies released so far (Hunger Games or Catching Fire) at all.

The mockingjay pin was actually a fine gold piece of jewelry that belonged to a classmate acquaintance of Katniss' named Madge. Madge wore it the day of the Reaping and wasn't chosen as tribute, then rather urgently gave it to Katniss during Katniss' allotted goodbye visits before leaving for the games. Before Madge, it belonged to Madge's aunt Maysilee. Maysilee was a young woman chosen as tribute for the Hunger Games in a Reaping the same year as Haymitch was, 24 years earlier in the 2nd Quarter Quell. That year, twice the number of tributes were sent into the arena. Madge's mother and her aunt Maysilee were twin sisters and both were good friends with Katniss' mother in school as well. Maysilee turned out to be handy with a blowpipe and poison darts she found in her backpack in the arena; she actually saves Haymitch's life at one point in the games, after he stumbled into a pack of careers. They allied for a while after that, until she decided they should go their separate ways, not relishing the thought of having to kill each other if it came down to them as the last two. Shortly after they split up, she was attacked by some huge pelican like birds that fatally stabbed her neck, and while Haymitch was too far away to help, he still came back to hold her hand and comfort her while she was dying.

Haymitch wins his games by outsmarting the game makers. He stays off by himself (when not allied with Maysilee) not provoking fights, not killing unless necessary to defend himself until he is one of the final two survivors. When it comes to their big showdown, he throws a hatchet into a force field and it flies back up and into his opponent, killing her. Therefore, the kill that won him the game was not caused by a direct act on his part, the game killed her for him. Because of that and because he did not gleefully participate in the games by hunting down and savagely killing his opponents he shows up the Capitol and is punished. His mother, brother and girlfriend are all killed off in separate ""accidents,"" and Haymitch comes to realize that anyone he cares about will be killed. So he retreats into life as a loner who cares about no one in order to keep more people from being killed, slowly sinking into alcoholism. Each year he's forced to watch as his district's tributes are targeted and killed off. Then Katniss comes along wearing a pin that belonged to Maysilee, with not only the skills to win the game but the spunk to show up the Capitol at the same time. The pin is a thread from the past, a Mockingjay echo from a fallen tribute reaching into the present, sparking hope for the districts rebellion against the Capitol's cruelty. That is why the pin was so important, why it's really the soul of the story.

With so much already lost in going from book to movie, I just cannot understand why they would cut parts of the actual theatrical movie out of the DVD when it would easily have fit. I would give this DVD release negative stars if I could. One star is four too many. It's not worth buying unless the chintzy studio idiots re-release it in an extended version that includes the entire theatrical movie on it.",1396569600,3,6609,4.475124378109452

4940177,3,B0063FQREO,"I found the movie terrifying.  The concept of all those young people killing each other was awful.  I wonder if the author had read Shirley Jackson's ""The Lottery"" that also deals with a yearly ritual at which one villager who draws  the ""lucky"" ticket is stoned by the others so that crops will grow.
 On the plus side I thought Jennifer Lawrence was marvelous.  Since there are three books I didn't worry about her survival.  The movie avoided  some of the blood and gore that would have rated it completely unsuitable for teenagers. Compassion prevails in several situations.
I would like to read book 2 before seeing the movie. I have recovered sufficiently to want to go on to the next book

I'm always leery of movie adaptations, especially when I really loved the book. However, all the reviews said the movie was really good, so I took the chance and watched it. It is worth it. The book goes more into the psychology of Kat and her experiences in the Games, while the movie focuses more on the events. But that isn't a bad thing. There are a lot of events to cover, and the underlying mental games still show through. Yes, I knew how it ended, but the ending is still dramatic.

I wish there could have been more, but since the movie is already almost 2.5 hours long, there was only so much that could be included. Since so much was cut, I think it is important to read the book before watching the movie. (Things make more sense that way.)",1396569600,,854,4.233128834355829

4940185,5,B0063FQREO,"I remember reading the Hunger Games books in maybe three days, that's how enthralled I was with this storyline and all it represents. I thought there was just no way they could make the movies even close to as good as the bookswrong.  I have no idea how many times I've watched the first movie and was so excited for this one to come out.  I went the first night it was in the theater, and I never go to the theater.  I was not disappointedintense is an understatement for Catching Fire.  It took me days to absorb all that I saw and process in the dynamic plot... those times where you know your about to be scared out of your mind so you think your prepared and it won't smack you in the face, but no, you're still scared out of your mind.  When I mean scared, I mean psychological scaryso much better than horror or any other genre.  Then there are those little tidbits that you just laugh and you think I'm laughing in a Hunger Games movie.what??  Oh, there was one intense moment I actually SCREAMED out loud in the movie theater and about a half dozen other people did the same thing, and then the rest of the crowd laughed at us. :)  The funny thing is, I jumped again when I watched the DVD.

So, I'm purposefully being vague because I wouldn't want to spoil a minute.  I guess, what I would end with isif you are a total book worm like me, you are often disappointed with the movie versions of your favorite books.  It couldn't be more the opposite in this case.  Of course, there are details missing that I think is important to the story in the movies, but for the most part, I wouldn't change a thing.  Oh, my husband who hasn't read a word of the books, but watched both movies with me the other day, really liked them (he actually has done survival training and been out in the woods with no more than a knife and some flint and steel, eating bugs and I don't know what else-ewwww).

4940190,2,B0063FQREO,"The director employs a 'let's throw the camera around everywhere' technique reminiscent of Blair Witch making it impossible to actually follow what is supposed to be happening.  This is done during fights, meaning I couldn't tell if the characters were rolling on the ground hugging or trying to punch each other.

I could not identify several references the movie tried to make.  I'm not sure if ""Smells Like Roses"" was supposed to mean something else in the interview period.  The emphasis on that wording seemed odd.  Also I've been told the book is all about 'power over the common people', and the movie did a terrible job of making this clear.  The scenes which illustrate this are boring because they aren't given supporting context.

My impression of the work was 'way too clean'.  The characters in the actual games themselves always look like they just took a shower (with the exception of the finale where they have obvious wounds).  Also, none of the characters were shown to 'think about their circumstances of slaughter'.  There was no reflection on the horrible things they were asked to do.  Instead we are constantly shown close-ups of Katniss's boyfriend who gets like two lines in the first five minutes of the movie whenever she does something with Peeta.  That had no chemistry and was just distracting from the actual storyline.  It's like the director transformed this gritty totalitarian book into a chick flick by hedging over the violence and trying to make it about which boy Katniss will pick.  I did not like that.",1396569600,,1543,4.884615384615385

4940236,4,B0063FQREO,I like it and the story is quite a good one which attracts my attention all the time.it's my favorite kind of movie,1396310400,,115,4.043478260869565
4940237,5,B0063FQREO,reminded me of the Roaman empire where they watched gladiators and Christians being put to death and jeering at them as if it was all a big game.,1396310400,,145,4.214285714285714
4940238,4,B0063FQREO,"Book much better! Overall well done keeping it around 2 hrs with decent explanation of the plot; however, underdeveloped regarding characters and backgrounds of the Districts.",1396224000,,175,5.769230769230769
4940239,5,B0063FQREO,"This is a really good movie! I got it in a very timely manner, and I bought it new! very happy with my purchase!",1396224000,,112,3.7083333333333335
4940240,5,B0063FQREO,My hubby and I are hooked!!!! Can't wait for the next one!! Never a boring second. Jennifer Lawrence reminds me of Elizabeth Taylor in her younger years.,1396224000,,153,4.703703703703703
4940241,5,B0063FQREO,It's a great movie and I think they did a great job converting the book into a movie.  I saw it once in theaters and once from home; I thoroughly enjoyed it both times.,1396224000,,168,3.9411764705882355
4940242,5,B0063FQREO,"But I'm a huge fan of the movies. Woody Harrelson and Jennifer Lawrence are great in this film. Although some of the scenes are kind of tear jerking, it is mostly action adventure.",1396224000,,180,4.484848484848484
4940243,3,B0063FQREO,"Given the young age of the characters, this dramatic story is likely to appeal to teens and young adults. But it also holds some interest for older adults as well.",1396224000,,163,4.466666666666667
4940244,4,B0063FQREO,"Went pretty well with the written story. Well acted and sets, scenes were all nicely handled.  Editing from book was well done.",1396224000,,127,4.7727272727272725
4940245,5,B0063FQREO,"I've been looking forward to seeing the first Hunger Games movie and it does not disappoint.
Lots of action from start to finish.  Really unique seenery really helps to draw you in even further.",1396224000,,194,4.705882352941177
4940246,4,B0063FQREO,It wad s a very interesting and entertaining film. It kept my interest and imagination throughout the film. Highly recommended,1396224000,,126,5.35
4940247,5,B0063FQREO,"Science fiction is always about what is happening right now or right around the corner.  There is a wonderful balance between character development and social commentary.  Jennifer Lawrence was born to play this part.  The novels keep their moral center all the way through.  I hope the sequels also do that. We are eating our children alive in the present.  This series simply rips off the veneer we are now living through.  It also reveals how we are hopelessly manipulated by the visuals the media feed us and how revolution often leads to replacing one monster with another.  I can't fault the books given what they are, literature for young adults who are really children.  Don't just watch it, discuss what you can learn from it, especially with your teenagers who are about to live in a dystopia not much different from the one depicted here.",1396224000,,849,4.767123287671233
4940248,5,B0063FQREO,I put off watching this movie as I did not think I would like and found that I loved the movie. Jennifer Lawrence does a great job and I can't wait to the Hunger Games Catching Fire,1396137600,,181,3.918918918918919
4940249,4,B0063FQREO,"Actually worth the hype. Intriguing, surprising, charming, and thought-provoking, mixed in with LOTS of action! Definitely worth the time to watch.",1396137600,,147,6.0476190476190474
4940250,4,B0063FQREO,"The first book in the trilogy lays the foundation.  Dystopian scenarios are not my favorite plot device - too much like real life where bad things happen to good people.  In The Hunger Games, there was enough lightness to balance the dark.

The books are page turners, well written easy reading.  The characters have flaws, make mistakes and still slog on.  The books deserve the attention they are getting.

As a caveat, I am quite stingy with five star ratings.  I save the five star ratings for works of art that change my life.",1396137600,,531,4.585106382978723
4940251,3,B0063FQREO,Decent action flick. Sometimes too predictable. Overall enjoyable. Good way to kill a couple of hours. Well played by cast.,1396137600,,123,5.2
4940252,4,B0063FQREO,"I am new to the Hunger Games series, and have not read the books or heard very much about them. I am not the usual age
demographic that watches or reads this type of entertainment.  I did however, find the acting, the photography, and the story
to be exceptionally well done.  The film held my interest the entire viewing time. I was uncomfortable the way the ""Tributes"" were
chosen, thinking that there should have been an age limit from which the young people could be selected. Overall, a very interesting film.",1396137600,,514,4.637362637362638
4940253,5,B0063FQREO,"The underlying idea is a bit rough, however the movie still manages to come out on top. It was worth the watch so long as you can later remove the plot from your head as it is the picture of ugliness.",1396137600,,200,3.902439024390244
4940254,4,B0063FQREO,Enjoyed the book.  Enjoyed the movie.  Good entertainment. I'm looking forward to the next movie coming out and will definitely see that as well.,1396137600,,145,5.0
4940255,5,B0063FQREO,I use this movie in my Civics class. The students have to answer different questions about forms of government being shown and amendments that are being violated. It helps them get a better understanding of what I am teaching.,1396137600,,226,4.82051282051282
4940256,5,B0063FQREO,"We really enjoyed this movie, multiple times. Fast paced, good special effects and performances by the actors followed the book closely",1396137600,,135,5.476190476190476
4940257,5,B0063FQREO,"Loved it
Complimented the book very well
Jennifer Lawrence is the mocking jay
Donald Sutherland is menacing
A very good movie",1396137600,,125,5.0
4940258,3,B0063FQREO,"I feel this movie is for the younger audience.  I found it depressing, and it reminded me loosely of the short story The Lottery.",1396137600,,129,4.375
4940259,5,B0063FQREO,"I am a BIG believer in reading a book first, BEFORE seeing a Movie!  There is just so much more information in a book than what can be portrayed in a Movie which is limited by time restraints.  I absolutely loved The Hunger Games Trilogy of books and read them a few times, (which is very unlike me, usually).  I watched the Twilight Movies & The Harry Potter Movies, without reading the Books.  I can't help but feel that I must have missed a good bit of the ""Magic"" that Fans who had read them first must have had.  But now, I have no desire to read those books, and will move on to the next Big things...so, my point is, READ FIRST so that you can fully understand the Author's messages.

Back to the Review - Great Movie...Amazing Actors...but can't imagine how those who only see the movie without reading the book could possibly ""get"" some of the important points.  I have to give the Movie 5 Stars though, because it was well-done & I LOVE all things ""Hunger Games"".",1396051200,,973,4.342541436464089
4940260,4,B0063FQREO,I read all the books. I loved the books. This movie I bought in the past. I like it but still not as exciting as the book. but I still hope I can find it. If not I will buy it again. I would recommend it to anyone who loved the books.,1396051200,,234,3.519230769230769
4940261,5,B0063FQREO,My Girls love these books and these movies. I had no desire to see this and they begged me to watch it with them. I am glad I did. This is a great movie!,1396051200,,153,3.5294117647058822
4940262,3,B0063FQREO,"Ok.  Not the best movie I have seen, not the worst either.  A little slow moving. The acting wass good. I found the book much more interesting than the move. The Haymitch actor was a perfect fit for sure ( don't want to spoil).",1396051200,,227,4.136363636363637
4940263,4,B0063FQREO,"I enjoyed watching this movie, and being able to watch this on my time. This is awesome movie! You must see this movie.",1396051200,,119,4.217391304347826
4940264,4,B0063FQREO,"Although not as good as the book, and most movies seldom I are, I was very impressed with this theatrical interpretation. I stayed engaged even though I already knew the story line and look forward to the next one!",1396051200,,214,4.512820512820513
4940265,1,B0063FQREO,"The description suggested that this ""set"" included the new sequel. Well, it doesn't. It's just the initial release plus a lot of dumb extras. I feel REALLY screwed.",1396051200,3,164,4.892857142857143
4940266,5,B0063FQREO,"There is something about this movie that makes me want to see it again and again. Maybe it is related to feeling the pain and frustration of a society that is made hostage by an elite minority.  Unfortunately, this story is not far beyond belief in our world given the unbelievable wealth of so few and the human penchant for turning wealth into control and power.",1396051200,,364,4.515151515151516
4940267,4,B0063FQREO,"But I think the character development for the supporting roles could have been better.  Plot was good, but the theme was thin.",1396051200,,126,4.7272727272727275
4940268,4,B0063FQREO,"Great entertainment.
Enjoyed the movie very much.  I was interested to see how they captured the characters, as I had read all the books.

Nice way to spend an afternoon.",1396051200,,170,4.633333333333334
4940269,5,B0063FQREO,"I really enjoyed Jennifer Lawrence's acting in this movie! Original story that engages you from the very beginning. I heard this was based on books targeted for the teen/young adult audience but as a young, old lady I really liked it.",1395964800,,234,4.7317073170731705
4940270,5,B0063FQREO,The movie is a good rendition of the book. Will continue to follow the series to the end.  Enjoyable to watch more then once.,1395964800,,125,4.208333333333333
4940271,4,B0063FQREO,"The characters are interesting and a foundation is laid for larger themes of hope and freedom.  Donald Sutherland remains the incarnation of a devious old man that one crosses at his peril.  Overall character chemistry is good and story offers a critique the present state of ""reality TV"" without drifting from the adventure film genre.  Parents will have to decide whether they believe the content is appropriate for children/young teens.  Some of the killing scenes are brutal and this is child on child/teen on teen violence. Having not read the book I'll leave it to others to offer comparisons.",1395964800,,599,5.02020202020202
4940272,5,B0063FQREO,"A great Sci-fi film! The story plot, in the future, shows that history repeats it's self. I found the acting, sets, as well as the landscape did justice to the film. I can not wait to see the next one!",1395964800,,201,4.05
4940273,4,B0063FQREO,"Good movie, I can see how teenagers could like but not believe this could really happen so they like it more.",1395964800,,109,4.238095238095238
4940274,5,B0063FQREO,"I thought this was the new Hunger Games so I started watching it. Once I realized I watched it already, I turned it off. But it played well and sound was good. No complaints",1395964800,,173,4.117647058823529
4940275,5,B0063FQREO,"I finally got around to watching it and have to say that I enjoyed it.  When it first hit the theatre, I thought the whole concept of kids killing other kids was going to be too disturbing to watch.  Not the case.  It was so much more and Jennifer Lawrence deserves all the attention she has been getting since starring in this movie.",1395964800,,334,4.26984126984127
4940276,5,B0063FQREO,Awesome movie! More than what I expected. Cannot wait until Mockingjay comes out so that I can continue the series.,1395964800,,115,4.8

4940278,3,B0063FQREO,"Good story line at the beginning. However, it lacked the action scenes I expected. The sci-fi bees and dogs, not to mention the fireballs, took too much away from the movies gladiator styled theme. The movie was not as exciting as a result.",1395964800,,240,4.604651162790698
4940279,5,B0063FQREO,"I watched this with much hesitation, but was told it was good, so decided to give it a try. It is a bit far fetched, but the storyline was well written. Acting was good. Special effects were pretty neat as well.",1395964800,,211,4.170731707317073
4940280,5,B0063FQREO,Love this movie.  I've read all the books and think the movies are great.  Great cast as well.  Recommend this movie.,1395964800,,117,4.476190476190476
4940281,5,B0063FQREO,"I was reluctant to watch this movie because I had heard that there was so much violence in the books but I have to say that I loved, Loved, LOVED this movie!!  The acting in this was superb and the chemistry between Katniss and Peeta was undeniable (good job Jennifer and Josh!!).  They left me wanting more.....so I just finished watching Catching Fire and I can't wait for the next movie in November.  Needless to say that I will be re-watching this movie as well as the sequel numerous times until the new release graces the big screen later this year.  I swear I'm as giddy as a school girl!!  I was even thinking of picking up the books as well.",1395964800,,650,4.338842975206612
4940282,3,B0063FQREO,"Finally caught up to this one.  My overall rating is ""meh,""  its OK, but not earth-shattering by any means.  Elements of the story are entirely implausible, and the story runs at least 20 minutes too long.  As best I can tell, the 'event' itself plays out over about 4 days, when (I am told) the book takes 2 weeks..which is certainly more realistic.  No one in the 'games' is in the event long enough to hardly get dirty, much less suffer any actual 'hunger.'  In making it 4 days long, any actual 'survival' element in the story is eliminated entirely.

In short, a decent time-consumer, but nothing I would pay for.",1395964800,,618,4.513513513513513
4940283,5,B0063FQREO,"I have watched The Hunger Games and have enjoyed very much.  So much action and moves very fast.
Plan on watching it again soon.",1395964800,,128,4.333333333333333
4940284,4,B0063FQREO,"The movie is hard to follow unless you have already read the book and know the story.  The book provided much more detail than the movie, but overall a pretty good movie. Jennifer lawrence fits Katniss' character well.",1395964800,,218,4.7368421052631575
4940285,4,B0063FQREO,"No movie can make the impact of the book it is based on, excepting, perhaps, Gone with the
Wind.  That should give you an idea of just how old I am...that being said, I was surprised with the movie, and it held my interest, which  is unusual for me.  I would rather use my imagination on what things looked like and felt like than be spoon fed.....I think the best part was the directors having some humanity come out during the games, our heroine was sweet and yet you could see her  gauging what she could use and how best to use it to her advantage.  Donald Sutherland was just as evil as anything Jack Nicholson portrayed.  Well done Mr. Sutherland.....I found myself hating your character, which is, of course, what you wanted.....Overall it was a good old insomniacs diversion, and I hope it is not prescient for our future.",1395964800,,830,4.5
4940286,5,B0063FQREO,I loved this movie. I only ever saw the first half with my girlfriend but now i finally got to see the whole movie. Very good movie,1395964800,,131,3.888888888888889
4940287,4,B0063FQREO,If things in America keep going like they are this movie might look like our future if our nation does not turn back to God!,1395964800,,124,4.0
4940288,5,B0063FQREO,"I saw this movie in the theater when it first came out. I remember thinking the book was much better and that there was too much shaky camera technique used. Well, I've now watched it twice on my 32"" TV using my blu ray player and I really have begun to appreciate this flick. It holds up well and is quite well produced. It's not for young and/or sensitive viewers. There is death and much heavy emotion that might upset some. I recommend reading the first two books of this series, and then watch the movies. Maybe the third movie will actually be better than the sub par third book.",1395964800,,585,4.327272727272727
4940289,5,B0063FQREO,Arrived quickly and packaged well. It's a great follow up movie from The Hunger Games and didn't dissapoint! I do not recommend  for children under age of 11 or 12 because the violence and plot is too much to see on the screen verses reading books and using imagination. Visual effects are awesome and costumes are magnificent! Can't wait to see Mocking Jay.,1395878400,,358,4.682539682539683
4940290,5,B0063FQREO,I had a different story in my head. Too much outside influence during the games. But actors saved the movie,1395878400,,107,4.4
4940291,5,B0063FQREO,"good family movie if you have older kids, strong role model for girls, and the second movie is even better.",1395878400,,107,4.4

4940294,4,B0063FQREO,"I loved the books and the movie was awesome too!  It was one thing to read the book and think about how unusual the citizens of Panem were; however, seeing them dressed in blue hair and living in extreme luxury was another.  It was a gentle reminder about the differences in their lives.  I can't wait to see the next movie.",1395878400,,324,4.278688524590164

4940298,5,B0063FQREO,"What an awesome movie! I loved every minute of it with the exception of the ending. I thought the ending could have been more indepth, but I guess they had to conserve on time. I loved the movie overall though. Katniss shows that there can be a heroine in a book/movie who doesn't curse, drink alcohol, or show any bad attributes and still comes out a winner in the end.",1395878400,,370,4.3
4940299,5,B0063FQREO,"When the previews for this first came out I was not at all interested is seeing it.  Then my pastor talked to me about it as she had just read all three books; I borrowed them and read them.  Wow!  Then I went and saw it in the theatre.

4940301,4,B0063FQREO,I probably should have read the book because I found myself wanting to know more about the war that was the reason for the games.  But I liked the movie and like the idea that a female is the heroine.,1395878400,,200,4.0

4940304,3,B0063FQREO,"Striking a near-perfect balance between grit and sensationalism, it takes viewers through a world marked by violence, double-dealing, and racial division, with an emphasis on the ambiguous morality and personal and familial baggage that come with a life lived between the straight world and the criminal one. The machinations of the characters and the twists of the plot are almost operatic, but the show remains rooted in the harsh realities of gangland.

The movie was not the greatest, I think I liked it less because of all of the hype.  I read the book after the movie, and the movie just seemed to leave some details out.

4940315,5,B0063FQREO,"I hesitated a long time before finally watching this...Being a senior, I didn't think I would enjoy the movie or the concept of it.  I was pleasanly surprised....enjoying everything about this movie.  So looks like I will be watching the next movie also.  Great acting, by the way.",1395878400,,281,4.8125
4940316,5,B0063FQREO,very well done!! why do I need any amount of words? I can rate it with fewer words and get my view to you,1395792000,,105,3.4166666666666665
4940317,2,B0063FQREO,Slow with a non-appealing story line. Did not finish watching the movie. Thought costuming of their present day world to be comic rather than futuristic.,1395792000,,153,5.16

4940319,4,B0063FQREO,simplistic rather than nuanced portrayals of oppressors and oppressed . Ms Lawrence does a nice job.  No surprises but generally fun,1395792000,,132,5.285714285714286
4940320,5,B0063FQREO,I loved the first one but the second one blew my mind. Can't wait for Mockingjay! May the odds be ever in your favor!,1395705600,,117,3.9166666666666665

4940322,5,B0063FQREO,"The districts remind me of my grandparents during World War II. They worked hard for little while their children made the ultimate sacrifice in distant lands. Katniss doesn't have superpowers, nor is she marked as ""special"" in any way. It is only her learned skill of hunting and her determination that helps her survive. While a complete fantasy, it does feel more real than most Sci-Fi.  The heros are human and scared and courageous. I really liked it.",1395705600,,455,4.833333333333333
4940323,3,B0063FQREO,"Do yourselves a favor and read the books. The imagination can outdo this movie 10 times out of 10. However the movie wasn't bad, it just can't compete with the book.",1395705600,,165,4.354838709677419

4940329,4,B0063FQREO,"An excellent movie!  Jennifer Lawrence is a powerful young actress and she takes this story to a whole other level.  I will watch the sequel to see what happens next to Katniss Everdeen. I highly recommend this movie. Not for very young children, though.",1395705600,,254,4.75
4940330,4,B0063FQREO,"This is an entertaining movie, but the premise is a little tough to swallow. How are the hunger games supposed to pacify the people again? And if only one can survive, why form groups. Okay, it's more fantasy than sci-fi, and it still has good bad guys, like Donald Sutherland, and good good guys, like Jennifer Lawrence, who totally carries the movie. She is rare talent, and if her charisma helps to empower a new generation of women, then better yet.",1395705600,,453,4.604938271604938
4940331,5,B0063FQREO,"I have read the books more than once - and after getting over the shaky camera work and not being in Katniss' head with her thoughts - I was incredibly drawn into this story.  The actors nailed each of their roles and brought emotions to their characters that can't help but affect the viewer.  The reaping scene chokes me up every time.  We aren't big movie goers, or buyers, but after watching this numerous times and Catching Fire twice so far - my wife is convinced they will be added to our home library.",1395705600,,509,4.3936170212765955

4940334,5,B0063FQREO,"When a book is converted into a movie, they're not always translated well. Hunger Games the movie was just as awesome as the book!! The special effects were amazing too!! I'll definitely be watching this movie again!!",1395705600,,217,4.891891891891892
4940335,5,B0063FQREO,We wanted to watch Hunger Games again before Catching Fire.  Even better the 2nd time around!  Great family movie as there were 3 generations watching and it provided wonderful bonding time to discuss the movie afterward.,1395705600,,221,5.111111111111111
4940336,5,B0063FQREO,I loved it so much that I rented it again a few days later!  I am not sure which one I loved more - Hunger Games or Catching Fire.,1395705600,,130,3.4827586206896552
4940337,5,B0063FQREO,True to the book and well crafted. Misses a couple of key points regarding the circumstance leading to this structure of society.,1395705600,,129,4.909090909090909
4940338,5,B0063FQREO,"Watched this movie to see what my Granddaughter was watching. Jennifer Lawrence did a SUPER job. Found the movie stayed very true to the book. Enjoyed entire movie, never lagged.",1395705600,,178,4.966666666666667

4940340,5,B0063FQREO,I was very surprised with how good this movie was. The story line was excellent and the characters were developed and entertaining.  The topic was a little uncomfortable to watch but most of the scenes were tastefully done.,1395705600,,223,4.868421052631579
4940341,4,B0063FQREO,"The first installment of Hunger Games was an entertaining introduction and good fun.  There was something a bit hollow in the characters, as I didn't feel myself rooting for any of them during the entire ""tournament.""  All in all, good fun.  I'm glad I didn't pay to watch it in theaters, though.",1395705600,,296,4.653846153846154

4940343,3,B0063FQREO,"Like all movies based on books, it does not do the series justice and was difficult for people who have never read the book to follow.
Was disappointed after the first time watching it, but happened to watch it again a few months later and actually enjoyed it more the second time around.
Perhaps going in with low expectations (without comparison to the book) makes it more enjoyable.",1395705600,,385,4.676470588235294
4940344,5,B0063FQREO,The movie is based on children killing each other is not inpressive to me.  However this could happen in real life to prevent mass killing in war.  I hope I am not arround if this happen.,1395705600,,187,4.166666666666667
4940345,3,B0063FQREO,"This story was different and violent. To see young people easily and viciously slaughter each other without a second thought was surprising. I am still not sure what the contest winner gets, whether it is food for life for his/her family or community.

I wanted to see it because it was different, and I would recommend it because of that, however, be aware that sometimes it is a little slow moving and there are some harsh killings of the young against the young. Putting the very young against the older students was also hard for me to accept. If I were setting these games I would have made age groups.",1395705600,,607,4.5181818181818185

4940348,5,B0063FQREO,Very enjoyable and a refresher before I watch Catching Fire after reading the book.  It was well acted and went to Ashville and saw the area where it was filmed (not the main reason for the visit),1395705600,,196,4.297297297297297
4940349,4,B0063FQREO,This was very well done. I had resisted watching as I thought it was a Twilight type of movie.  Now I'm into the series.,1395705600,,120,4.0

4940354,3,B0063FQREO,ok.  Not that interesting.  I guess I don't get it. Some of the visuals were interesting.  Not my kind of movie. I will not watch the sequel.,1395705600,,141,4.148148148148148

4940356,5,B0063FQREO,Little slow to get started but necessary to build the story; various surprises throughout and acts of kindness intertwined into an awful situation.,1395705600,,147,5.434782608695652
4940357,5,B0063FQREO,"I was a big fan of the Hunger Games books.  I've found in some respects the movie exceeded the book.  The premise of the story is unique and provides non-stop excitement.

4940366,3,B0063FQREO,"I loved the excitement I had leading up to watching the movies, I could not put the books down!!

 However almost right away the movie deviated from the heart of the storyline by changing who gave Katness the Mockingjay pin!! The pin was given to her by Madge Undersee who's aunt, Maysilee Donner a tribute who died in a previous games had worn! To my dismay this proceeded to throw off all of the storyline and the movies that followed.....

If you have not read the books, I would say this would be an energy packed movie of great enjoyment and thought of how we need to be careful of our global choices as to not loose the right to be free.
 If you loved the books with as much fur-fer as myself, the movie was enjoyable just watch it with a grain of salt.",1395619200,,759,4.213793103448276

4940368,5,B0063FQREO,"This one is far better than the first movie. As always some things had to left out that were in the book, but, for the most part the story covered the mood and action VERY well",1395532800,,176,3.9166666666666665
4940369,5,B0063FQREO,"We read the books as soon as they came out and thoroughly enjoyed them.  The movie followed the story-line of the book obviously lacking a lot of the details.  I was pleased the movie was rated PG-13.  I thought there were far too many children in the theater under 10 and can only hope their parents discussed the movie with them.
I believe this movie is more enjoyable if you have read the book first, although that is not always the case. Without the details contained in the book, the movie would contain a little too much gratuitous violence.  Many of today's kids, who don't read, get a whole different mind-view of the story.",1395532800,,632,4.517543859649122

4940372,5,B0063FQREO,I watched The Hunger Games 2 and realized that I needed to watch this movie.  The entire movie was so riveting and poignant.

The books were very well written and were an amazing twist as to what could be waiting for America in the future! The directors of the movies have outdone themselves by bringing these books to life just like Peter Jackson did with ""The Lord of the Rings"" and ""The Hobbit"" films!!! Both films are TOTALLY AWESOME!!!!!!!!!! I, for one, CAN'T WAIT the last two films to come!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

It must have been a low cost movie to make since some of the portions were completely black, or only a small spot of light was shown.  I had read the book and was really looking forward to seeing some of the scenes clearly.  I was definitely disappointed in this movie.  My husband does not read, so he was completely lost and did not know what was going on.  I have never had to tell others in my group what was happening in a movie.

But, I don't understand the multiple continuity errors I discovered. I will only mention one for all the fans of the books and movies, and hopefull it will not completely ruin the experience for the die-hard fans since this error sets-up a large portion of the second movie's writing. So, here it is...... how does the character named Thresh know about the friendship and supportive treatment between Katniss and Rue? Thresh is in the game and cannot see these things, only the general audience can see everything that happens in the games.

And an update for January 2016..... why is this movie not on Prime yet? I mean..... I saw it on TBS a few days ago............",1395273600,,796,4.896296296296296

4940441,5,B0063FQREO,"Jennifer Lawrence was the total main character.  The basic theme of the movie was unique.  The general population was just a show for the upper social class.  This movie brought a totally new idea to the word ""games.""",1395187200,,217,4.657894736842105

4940450,4,B0063FQREO,"This movie was surprisingly well done, Jennifer Lawrence is an amazing actress, I may go so far as to state she may be the Meryl Streep of our generation. There were several A list stars in this movie as well. Stanley Tucci was amazing as the over the top games host. Donald Sutherland did a great job as the President. While the movie was predictable, it was a fun way to spend a Saturday afternoon with the family. It's rare these days that a movie will have such broad appeal. While the post apocalyptic action movie has been done ad nauseaum, the premise and story line were actually surprisingly fresh. I did not read the books, but many of those who have feel the screen adaptation was very well done.  My family and I are looking forward to the remaining segments of the story hitting our local theater. Well worth the time and money. Enjoy!!",1395100800,,849,4.47741935483871

4940452,4,B0063FQREO,Held off from watching this for a long time but it was not as bad as I thought it would be. A lot of youngsters in this but it's better than watching anyone of those Twilight films.,1395100800,,181,3.918918918918919

4940455,3,B0063FQREO,It was good and I was entertained. It isn't like the book though. I don't think it is suitable for children under 12.,1395100800,,117,4.130434782608695
4940456,5,B0063FQREO,"I am somewhat ashamed to admit I am a fan of the Hunger Games.  But I have read the books now, call my husband and I fans.  While this may be a YA series I know many of 30-40's who love it. It's a bit more grown up than Harry Potter and a lot less  ""love"" focused than Twilight.  This is a winning concept!",1395100800,,306,3.734375
4940457,4,B0063FQREO,"This movie is VERY intense. The whole concept is set in this post-apocalyptic world where the inhuman and murderous and iron-fisted and Big-Brother-like government has set up these games where 24 children chosen at random are torn from their families and slaughter each other. I think it was part of their goal to shock about the inhumanity of the world. And it is shocking and somewhat disturbing. Rather violent, and realistically so, none of this imaginary superhero violence but real children with real screams and real looking blood.

BUT, that said, against this incredibly dark background, the hero Katniss stands out incredibly well. She is the symbol of the person, of love, of teamwork and self-sacrifice, of dedication, of humility, and I could go on for a while. When people close to her die, it is actually really satisfying to see her exhibit the completely human emotions of grief and sorrow that are completely and very conspicuously absent in everyone else in her insane world.

Her intense commitment to these ideals bring out the best in other people as well. As the show progresses you see people that otherwise were just going with the brutal flow of the society grasp onto her as a role model and example and start to be a little human as well. Unfortunately, some of those people get killed. So that's also a little disturbing. Overall I gave it 4 stars because of the disturbing-ness (definitely not for a kid under 15, I'd say). I don't want to watch it again any time soon because of the violence but it was SO worth it to see it at least once because I truly felt inspired to value the people around me I had been taking for granted.

That's also not to say that I won't see the second one. I've heard that one's not as graphic.",1395100800,,1755,4.636655948553055
4940458,4,B0063FQREO,"I'd heard so much about this movie and the books, so felt compelled to view. Interesting and scary concept. Reminded me of the Star Trek episode where warring entities just sacrificed people into an elevator-like contraption to avoid the destruction of actually fighting.

4940471,4,B0063FQREO,"The celebrating regarding the beginning of the games and the sacrifice of the chosen participants is sickening. The people who run the games are weird-looking and ridiculous.  The heroine, however, is characterized as a real and self-effacing person--someone with good values--someone who knows how to live off the land--a strong young woman.  She is someone who does not want to kill but avoids violence and only kills if necessary to survive.  She manages to somewhat outwit the people who run the games.

4940483,2,B0063FQREO,The movie did not do justice to the book. The characters were not well developed at all and the nuances in the relationships were totally overlooked. I am glad that I didn't pay to watch it.,1395014400,2,190,4.305555555555555

4940488,3,B0063FQREO,"Just another bubble-gum teenage fantasy flick.  Great actors starving for real roles.  Should have been ""The Starving Actors Guild"".  Failed to impress. Lacks any real imagination or plot. To obvious from start to finish.",1395014400,,221,5.4411764705882355

4940492,5,B0063FQREO,"We were pleased with the uninterrupted screening of the movie Hunger Games.  The movie itself was a little rough for me, being a parent, at first because every year parents send their children to die.  I continued watching it because Catniss was not their average contestant and she helped the other kids and received help from them in return.",1395014400,,343,4.796610169491525
4940493,5,B0063FQREO,I loved this movie. I played it because I saw a really good review from other person. So I give it a try and got me since the beginning.,1395014400,,136,3.7241379310344827
4940494,4,B0063FQREO,I thought this was an entertaining movie that was worth my time to watch. Some parts were sad deplicting the depravity of mankind.,1395014400,,130,4.695652173913044

4940499,5,B0063FQREO,"Wow, with all the hype over the Hunger Games II release, I'm glad Amazon Prime offered the first movie for free. This has all the elements of a classic action-packed movie while having bits of romance and suspense.  All this along with superb acting at all levels of major cast and also supporting. I can't wait for the trilogy to finish and am so tempted to actually get ahead and read the book but alas, don't want to spoil it... not yet.",1394928000,,440,4.365853658536586
4940500,5,B0063FQREO,"The Hunger Games book series is, in my opinion, great reading.  Very thought provoking.  The movie is excellent, especially when you consider all of the details that it has to entail, infer, or skip altogether.  The actors were excellent, the costumes and scenery must have been a challenge.  It was all done very, very well.  I would recommend this move for every reason one would recommend an excellent movie. Excellence!  (...and more to come with the sequels...)",1394928000,,466,4.987012987012987

4940502,4,B0063FQREO,"Hunger Games is a Sci Fi fantasy as far as I am conerned. I read the book and for the most part found the movie to interesting and true to the book.  However, in order to understand the meaning of some of the movie you must read the book. Anyone who enjoys these types of movies should enjoy this one.  Intense, interesting, stimulating, and enjoyable. Be sure to watch it. It met my expectations.",1394928000,,397,4.351351351351352
4940503,1,B0063FQREO,"My goodness. Had heard the name all over the place and wondered why it was so popular. Silly, absurd, and a violent premise. I suppose that's the very reason it's popular with some teens. I'm talking about the ones who do nothing but play violent video games all day, not the awesome teenagers. Ridiculous.",1394928000,5,306,4.685185185185185

4940507,4,B0063FQREO,"Having seen Jennifer Lawrence in a host of public appearances, I wonder why some of her real life vitality wasn't brought forth in her acting?
She seemed subdued and withdrawn. For me the show was very predictable and unrealistic. I see where the Hunger Games 2 is already available. I doubt I'll watch it.",1394928000,,306,4.685185185185185
4940508,4,B0063FQREO,"I have small children so I am not sure how appropriate it would be for them to watch it, but as an adult it was an enjoyable movie.  Looking forward to seeing Catching Fire!  The whole series is very entertaining.",1394928000,,213,4.3

4940512,4,B0063FQREO,A very introspective movie that makes you think about a dystopian future. The movie writers kept it nearly authentic to the book.,1394928000,,129,4.909090909090909

4940514,5,B0063FQREO,Well thought out plot. Great movie choice! Not for children under 10 in my opinion. Nor children at any age who can't handle violent scenes.,1394928000,,140,4.64

4940516,3,B0063FQREO,This was a good movie but the idea of society manipulating kids to kill themselves for entertainment is disturbing. Reading history about the roman coliseum and the thirst of blood for entertainment is enough for me. My personal opinion is why make a movie with the same morbid thirst using kids ?,1394928000,,297,4.730769230769231
4940517,5,B0063FQREO,"I loved the movie because it gave actual faces to the characters.  I think the book covered more than the movie, but all in all it followed the book fairly well.",1394928000,,161,4.193548387096774
4940518,4,B0063FQREO,Very entertaining.  Picks up where the 1st left off. Great acting! Ending leaves room for another movie to be made.,1394928000,,115,4.75

4940520,5,B0063FQREO,Loved it...watched it 4 times already. It was a new twist on the last Hunger Games. Very Exciting... Everyone must see it,1394841600,,121,4.545454545454546

4940522,4,B0063FQREO,"I heard this was bad to see, since kids kill kids, but the actual killing seens with young kids was minimal. there are a lot of violent seens shown though but for the little kids in movie you just see them fall or lay there with blood near them. action is good and acting is not bad.
I thought some parts were not clear enough in storyline but still enjoyable",1394841600,,359,4.142857142857143

4940525,4,B0063FQREO,"I didn't really think this movie would be my cup of tea as it seemed to have a teenage or young adult target audience.  However, after seeing Jennifer Lawrence nominated for so many awards this year, I decided to see where it all started.  Guess what!  Although I am a senior citizen, this was a fun, exciting movie which I really enjoyed.  The premise of the movie was sort of a ""Star Trekkie"" type challenge which seems to pop up frequently in science fiction movies.  Hunting humans instead of animals has long been a theme in literature and has always seemed hard to believe for me.  But, when you see how Katniss is forced into the games to protect her beloved little sister, it is no far fetched.  And, you can see the ""evil government"" using these games to exert authority over the populace.  It IS believable.  So, all in all, it was a good story and Katniss is a character you cheer for.",1394841600,,896,4.414634146341464

Not that it wasn't good, but I was a little disappointed. I would have liked to see ""kat"" use her bow skills a lot more since it appeared from the cover and the beginning of the movie, that she was a super bow hunter.  I thought Jennifer Lawrence did a good job, but she did better in X-Men 1st Class. She came across as too emotionless. I hope Liam Hemsworth is in HG Catching Fire, definitely can't see too much of him. The guy from her district was OK, but I don't even remember his name (not either one of them).  Donald Sutherland's character could have been played by just about anyone else and it would have been better. Surprisingly, Woody Harrelson did a good job with his character and I'm NOT a Harrelson fan. He's normally a freak.
I'll likely watch Catching Fire when I can see it on Prime, but not until then.",1394582400,,945,4.273743016759776

I though is not as much a prude as many others regarding violence.  As a kid, I saw Westerns and Karate flicks that were only good when people were killed.  Of course those movies did not have not children killing children but the Hunger Games was fantasy/make believe and given my kids are pretty well exposed, they could differentiate fact from fiction..... well at least they have not killed us yet. ;-)",1394582400,,546,4.323529411764706

4940589,3,B0063FQREO,"The ""Hunger Games"" was an interesting movie.  The movie proposes that the society run a contest every year where each 'province' was to send 2 representatives to compete in games.  The objective of the games is to KILL as many other players as possible as there is only 1 (ONE) winner.  While the movie is entertaining and interesting, the solution proposed is a poor solution to the prevention of war or other societal issues.

Rather, it would be so much better if society went ahead and made these types of deadly competitions for the sake of satisfying people's needs to murder, kill and win at all costs an illegal type of activity.  Rather, more innovative solutions would be a more positive benefit to society at large without needlessly or inappropriately killing people for the sake of a game that is supposed to keep society out of major wars.  The concept is ignorant.  It is an ignorant concept,because people will find ways to avoid the potential of being picked as a competitor and most likely be killed.  Rather, they will kill, hide, obfuscate and do any activity that will keep them out of the games that would most likely end up killing them if they participated.

Nonetheless, I give the movie a 3 star rating, because it was a fairly well made film that addresses a large societal issue.  I suspect the new ""Hunger Games"" movie will continue to discuss the concept and hopefully, will reach a better solution than the one that is being used in the first movie.  And, in general, the movie is entertaining.",1394496000,,1525,4.695488721804511

to me the movie is a re-hash of something that has been done on an outer limits episode or something like that
the acting was marginal although as the movie progressed it got better
special effects are cgi and left me flat, I was unimpressed
I could also predict what was going to happen so no surprises here

My only complaint, and its same complaint I have with almost every movie I've seen, is that the background music and/or sound effects are so loud that I miss enough of the words being spoken, severely reducing my enjoyment of it. I do have impaired hearing, 50% loss and background noise cancels out definition of voices in particular, or any sound of the voices completely. Not everyone can afford hearing aids so your people that put it all together should take that into consideration before you lose chunk of your audience. And no, I don't want to read subtitles! That's like trying to watch a movie and read a book at the same time. Thank you for your time. Sincerely, Debi Taylor",1394409600,,724,4.569230769230769

4940614,5,B0063FQREO,"This movie pretty much picked up where the first one ended. But fortunately for me, there was a lot less emphasis on the killing aspect of the participants (which I found a bit unsettling) and introduced the participants to battle another opponent (big brother aka the government).

So we have a girl from a rural community who gets swept up during ""The Reaping"" and ends up in a Utopian City full of strange clothes and even more bizarre hairstyles... So the Capitol is OZ and Katniss is Dorothy... Except that after arriving in OZ instead of going on a friendly journey to get back home she must kill The Scarecrow, The Tin Man and the Cowardly Lion and probably have to eat Toto to survive... But fear not boys and girls because in the end she does get back home...
Does that make Woody Harrelson's character Glinda? It would seem so as he vacillated between concerned mentor and just being ""fabulous""...

Umm... This was a silly but watchable movie and my biggest surprise was that Joel Schumacher didn't direct it... And did Wes Bentley really eat those berries? Stay tuned... ""Catching Fire""

And what was up with the Mockingjay Pin? It starts as a useless trinket given to Katniss for free who then gives it to her sister who than gives it back and suddenly it becomes the symbol of survival and victory! WTF? Love you JLaw...",1394150400,,1102,4.477611940298507

4940642,4,B0063FQREO,"This movie I've watched twice now, which means it's connecting with me on an emotional level. It's not so great that I'd give it five stars, but I'll definitely watch the other movies that come out and probably read the books. The acting could be a bit better. Lawrence never convinced me her character was experiencing the terror or deep dread that I would imagine the tributes should be feeling. Only the actor playing Katniss's little sister was convincing at that, as the day of reaping approached. The actor playing Peeta was also stone-faced and too detached from what was about to happen. I would have been a basket case in such a situation, as I would imagine most young people would have been. Now, the tributes from districts 1 and 2 were fine; because they were trained for the games all their lives, their attitudes felt true-to-life.

Ok, I'm maybe picking nits here, but I do like the film. I'll just need to read the books to see if this issue is handled differently there. So, by all means, watch. Good movie. Not great. But good.",1394150400,,1046,4.593582887700535

4940644,5,B0063FQREO,Loved the book and the movie stayed pretty true to it. The story is very relevant to the times we live in right now. The actors and director do a great job letting the viewers know what the characters are like and what they are thinking. The focus is on the characters thoughts and emotions rather than just presenting a bunch of action and gore.,1394150400,,346,4.338461538461538
4940645,2,B0063FQREO,"Some of this was good but as for myself I'm asking why would I watch a movie where there is no choice but one (or in this video two) only are allowed to survive and whenever the cannon booms it's a relief because someone died. Near the end there's a boy who knows he's going to die but he keeps holding on (literally) to Peeta and there's lions on the ground and the boy is bleeding and saying he's dead anyway but then saying he could still do this (by killing Peeta and Katniss. Katniss shoots his hand with an arrow and he falls to the lions. You can hear him screaming. It's horrible. I don't know why but I felt so bad for this guy because it was almost like he was reaching out for help, you may know what I mean if you watched it, but was instead shot down to a horrible death. I don't know about you but I don't understand why we'd watch this type of thing that is desensitizing but even more do we wonder why there's kids everywhere that shoot and kill and don't think much of it?

It subtly makes a moral commentary on power, absolute power, fear, rebellion - all the usual suspects....  Jennifer Lawrence is very good, as are all her co-stars.

While I will admit the basic premise of the movie was similar I did not in fact find this movie to be a ripoff.  The basic story is very different and the execution of the story line is also not the same.  I thought the Japanese movie was even more horrific than was this movie.  I cannot say I enjoyed the Japanese movie while I found this story to be ""entertaining"".

I thought all the actors in this movie performed admirably.  Woody Harrelson as is usually the case brought believeability to his role in spite of the premise.  I had never seen Jennifer Lawrence before and I think that she is a really good actress.  I will make certain to see the sequel when it is available.",1393891200,,783,4.308219178082192

4940705,3,B0063FQREO,"Maybe I fell victim to the hype, and went into watching this movie with too high of expectations, but this movie was nowhere near as good as I was expecting it to be.  The acting was solid, Jennifer Lawrence did not disappoint, displaying effectively the full spectrum of human emotions.  The supporting cast, Stanley Tucci in particular, was good.

But, like most movies that are based on a book series, this movie felt like there was a greatly compressed timeline.  Events transpired too quickly for there to be any real attachment to the characters or the predicaments in which the characters were placed.  Very little backstory was given.  There was no truly effective ""villain"" that was introduced.  Sutherland's role as the President was the closest that the story came, but so little plot, dialogue, and screen time was allotted to him that he just became a generic ""bad guy"" without any believable motive behind his actions.

Special effects were good, directorial style was also quite good, allowing the viewer to see and feel what the characters would have seen, introducing some ""shaky camera"" bits, but not going too over-the-top with it, the way some ""gritty"" action movies are won't to do.  I personally felt that the sound editing was a bit off, as dialogue tended to get lost in the sound effects, sound track, and background noise, and I found that I was continually adjusting my volume up for dialogue and down for action scenes.

For anyone who wants to claim that this movie was excessively violent and to ""be warned,"" then perhaps they should actually understand a bit about what the movie is about before watching it:  24 children left alone in, basically, a Pay-Per-View bloodbath that pits them against each other in a lone-survivor-takes-all event.  24 children, stuck in the woods, until 23 of them are dead, either by violence or by exposure or injury.  It's rated PG-13, and I think that's appropriate.  if you're concerned about the violence and blood, then don't let your 12 year old watch it.  It's that simple.  I watched far worse when I was 8 years old (The Terminator, Alien, Aliens), and I didn't find anything in this film that even approached the levels of violence and horror that Aliens dished out in the 1980s.",1393804800,,2251,4.838120104438643

4940717,5,B0063FQREO,Good  old new-fashioned drama in a lie-world run by unsaintly politicians. Power does not always come from the barrel of a gun.,1393718400,,127,4.7727272727272725
4940718,4,B0063FQREO,The Hunger Games is a good story as is. It would have rated 5 stars if they had stayed closer to the storyline from the book. If you haven't read the story it can be a little difficult to figure out exactly what is going on. Since the book is written in the 1st person it would have made more sense for Katniss to tell the story where there were no speaking parts. Still a good story.,1393718400,,384,4.0
4940719,5,B0063FQREO,What can you say. Jennifer Lawrence is awesome and not bad to look at either. I read all three books and am eagerly waiting for the third movie...,1393718400,,146,4.25
4940720,5,B0063FQREO,great dealer great shipping and the movie is one the husband and I can sit and watch together and both enjoy.  Can't wait until March 7 when the next comes out.,1393718400,,160,4.161290322580645
4940721,5,B0063FQREO,I like this story.  Stayed true to the books.  I would highly recommend as a great story and movie for the family.,1393718400,,114,4.136363636363637
4940722,5,B0063FQREO,"Fantastic characters; a believable plot (in the fictional sense); great actors, gorgeous setting, wardrobe, makeup; not as much violence as I was braced for (a surprising and definite plus for me these days!), and a decent ending. Can't wait to see the next one.",1393718400,,262,4.9772727272727275
4940723,5,B0063FQREO,"I watch movies for entertainment, not message, but I enjoyed this story for both. Life is hard but there is hope, if you are willing to fight for it. Even hope is not free.",1393718400,,172,4.088235294117647
4940724,4,B0063FQREO,There were lots of futuristic scenario books written in the late 1950's early 1960's and this story line fits that model. Some very interesting camera work.,1393718400,,156,5.038461538461538
4940725,4,B0063FQREO,Enjoyed watching a movie that had impacted so many and holds a humane story line.  Missed it in the movie house just add good watching our at home.,1393718400,,147,4.25

4940727,2,B0063FQREO,Weak plot. Very depressing.  I did not feel the situations made much sense. Kids killing kids.  It was Sad! Sad! Sad!,1393632000,,117,4.523809523809524
4940728,5,B0063FQREO,"Tremendous piece of work here!  Bravo!!  Well done by everyone involved! All of these young people were tremendous athletes, the acting was superb and the scenery was absolutely gorgeous.  Can't get any better than this!",1393632000,,220,5.228571428571429
4940729,4,B0063FQREO,"When I first heard about the movie I thought it very much reminded me of Running Man from the 90's but instead of convicts it was children.  The actors and actresses were extremely impressive and the sets were astonishingly beautiful.  I found the plot just as with Running Man ridiculous.  But it makes you look at a potentially real dark side of the human concept of entertainment in a garish and mocking manner.  The mocking element is probably why I give it a 4 instead of a 3. It looses a star because it uses relatively young children which for some reason I find a little disturbing but for the sake of entertainment these kids did so well it in essence made a pretty decent movie.  Fortunately, it wasn't gory just the concept a little disturbing.",1393632000,,755,4.522058823529412

4940732,4,B0063FQREO,"I originally didn't think I would like this movie, but after watching it I found it very interesting and can see where it may have been developed for follow-ups.  The plot was intriguing.",1393632000,,187,4.666666666666667
4940733,5,B0063FQREO,Amazing story of where our country is heading!  Young love with action and heart break and some political undertones.  Jennifer is beautiful and a completely believable character actress.,1393632000,,187,5.642857142857143
4940734,1,B0063FQREO,What's all the fuss about? Not compelling or interesting to me in the least. Maybe the books are better. Glad it was a free stream.,1393632000,,131,4.28
4940735,4,B0063FQREO,"The movie was very good and overall I liked it.  The acting was good and the characters believable.  However, the idea of having children fight each other as a sort of sport...to the death is disturbing.  Further, to televise this sport of children killing other children to win the prize of food for their village with deranged adults amused by the ""show"" is sick.  It reminds my of historical ""games"" that were also to the death back in the Roman Colosseum.  The movie was marketed to teens and young adults which makes me wonder what impact it will have on them.  Certainly, it was the topic of significant discussion with my teenager following our viewing. I recommend that parents use caution when allowing young people to watch this movie.  It has the power to be an excellent history lesson as well as driving home points about courage, mercy and self reliance.  I recommend viewing with an adult who will actively discuss the contents with the young person to avoid any negative feelings, thoughts or impressions the movie could leave.",1393632000,7,1043,4.787709497206704
4940736,5,B0063FQREO,It was a great movie.  Hope our civilization never comes to that.  I loved Jennifer Lawrence in this movie.  She looked so naturally sexy.  I think it actually is worth a sequel.,1393545600,,178,4.46875
4940737,4,B0063FQREO,"An interesting way to connect the Roman Gladiators, contemporary game shows and reality shows.  The plot was mediocre, but the acting was excellent.",1393545600,,148,5.434782608695652
4940738,5,B0063FQREO,We really enjoyed the movie The Hunger Games and would recommend it to teen audiences and above. It follows the books well.,1393545600,,123,4.636363636363637
4940739,5,B0063FQREO,"I don't like to hear about people using it as a morality tale for their children, though.  I think it's much too violent -- bloody, gory violent -- for kids, even young teens.",1393545600,,175,4.303030303030303
4940740,5,B0063FQREO,"I really enjoyed this movie

I enjoyed watching this again.",1393545600,,116,4.318181818181818
4940741,5,B0063FQREO,Excellent audio and video quality. Watched it on by big HDTV thru my Sony Blu-Ray player. I was very surprise how great it looked and it steamed in flawlwssly without any delays or pauses.,1393545600,,188,4.5588235294117645
4940742,5,B0063FQREO,the best hunger game. I love Jennifer Lawrence she makes this movie. I can't wait until the next come out,1393545600,,105,4.3

4940744,5,B0063FQREO,Excellent movie.  Can't wait for the sequel.  My son read the series and thought this was a good versio. Of the story.,1393545600,,118,4.318181818181818
4940745,4,B0063FQREO,Love this movie.  Because I did read the book I didn't give it the 5 stars because I thought needed more details,1393545600,,112,4.090909090909091

4940747,5,B0063FQREO,"I love the Hunger Games! I saw the movie before I read the book, and I've probably watched it eight or nine times by now......it just gets better and better every time I watch it (I see something new and different in it during each viewing).

I saw Hunger Games: Catching Fire eight or nine times during it's theatrical release, I can't wait for it to be released on Blue Ray, I'm reading the book now.

I've become a huge Jennifer Lawrence fan, I can't imagine anyone else playing Katniss Everdeen!",1393545600,,499,4.472527472527473
4940748,5,B0063FQREO,This is a grate movie. It's very inspiring and Its one of my favorites you should read the book to understand it fully.,1393459200,,119,4.217391304347826
4940749,5,B0063FQREO,"The Hunger Games movie follows closely to the book.  Some details are left out, but this not take away from the movie.",1393459200,,118,4.363636363636363
4940750,5,B0063FQREO,Awesome movie and visual effects. Nice that it is on amazon prime so I can watch it again when I feel like it!,1393459200,,110,3.8260869565217392
4940751,2,B0063FQREO,"The Hunger Games seemed like a rushed, frantic showcase of CG and teen romance.  Maybe reading the novel would have helped, but the entire film seemed contrived and improbable, where scene after scene you're left asking unresolved questions (""would the elite rich people really be sitting in an unguarded room watching the tributes practice with their weapons?"", ""why the disproportionate age ranges in the tributes?"", ""would the hero really reach for a wasp nest without wrapping her sleeping bag material around her hands and/or face?"", etc,)  The changing of the rules to accomodate the romance just seemed inane.  I'll agree that this was a fair action/adventure story and had some entertaining moments, but throw in the CG dogs and it was all over for me.",1393459200,,760,5.064
4940752,4,B0063FQREO,Enjoyed the movie.  Read the book first and this pretty much follows the book.  There is a lot more detail and story in the book.  Would recommend reading the book as well.,1393459200,,172,4.3125
4940753,4,B0063FQREO,Is was a good movie and followed the book reasonably well.  I enjoyed the entire series of books.  The movie was a bit different but did not disappoint.,1393459200,,152,4.392857142857143
4940754,5,B0063FQREO,I love this movie.  It has enough of the elements of the book to keep me happy while keeping my husband (who hasn't read the books) entertained as well.,1393459200,,152,4.241379310344827
4940755,5,B0063FQREO,I've been wanted to watch this movie for months and my husband finally agreed. We were both absorbed into the movies quickly and thoroughly enjoyed it. The movie is paced fast enough that it seemed no where near 2 hours and 20 minutes. We are excited to watch the sequel,1393459200,,270,4.42
4940756,5,B0063FQREO,I liked the Hunger Games movie (and books as well).  Once you get past the premise that this movie is about kids killing kids and the need to survive then the story line is a decent one.,1393459200,,186,4.027027027027027
4940757,4,B0063FQREO,"Very good movie.  The premise is horrific, but the story is a good one. I would recommend the movie to others.",1393372800,,110,4.238095238095238
4940758,5,B0063FQREO,I was very surprised that this movie was as good as the book.  All the actors were as I had imagined them in the book.  I would highly recommend this movie to everyone.  Now waiting for the second movie's release.,1393372800,,213,4.275
4940759,4,B0063FQREO,A lot of action. Interesting story. I want to see the next one. i would suggest you to watch it.,1393372800,,96,3.85
4940760,5,B0063FQREO,"Greet movie, shown seamless and attention grabber, right on point. Worth watching again  and again, watching it gave me a new though about movies",1393372800,,145,5.041666666666667
4940761,5,B0063FQREO,"In the genre of ""poetic licence"" to modify a book to suit the thoughts of the masses that don't even read books....it is hard to find many movies that actually follow the book.
This one did far more than I would have imagined.
I would also like to say it was very smart to keep the ""Names"" stars out of it, for the most part, and was surprised how they matched my mind's eye view of the characters, as described in the book, fit.
Scared of the sequel, hoping it will live up to this adaptation of the first book.",1393372800,,512,4.13
4940762,1,B0063FQREO,"The *movie* appears to be good, but I can't say for certain since the DVD skipped half an hour in the middle.

It's pretty amazing in this day and age that a brand new DVD can't be properly produced.",1393372800,,199,4.102564102564102
4940763,5,B0063FQREO,This movie is great and Jennifer Lawrence definitely delivers. It's very entertaining and I highly recommend it to any action movie fan.,1393372800,,136,5.2272727272727275
4940764,5,B0063FQREO,Anyone who is an action fan should like this movie. An ageless classic. Fun for all ages. Two thumbs up!.,1393372800,,105,4.3
4940765,4,B0063FQREO,"If you are comparing it to the book, you will be disappointed. It leaves out some of the more mundane things or passes by them too quickly.
With that said, It is fast paced and emotional. What it leaves out, you can infer from the actors.. Jennifer Lawrence shows her acting chops in this movie, and her supporting cast does a wonderful job.. Even though I knew what was going to happen, I was still on the edge of my seat... Scenery was extremely close to what I imagined it would be and this added greatly to my enjoyment.",1393372800,,524,4.303030303030303
4940766,4,B0063FQREO,"I have heard so much about the Hunger Game movie, I was glad Amazon Prime had it for me to watch.  I wasn't bowled over with this movie. It was sweet and predictable and had a good ending and at least it was  something you could watch with your kids without bare boobs and over the top sexual scenes.",1393372800,,300,4.067796610169491
4940767,2,B0063FQREO,It was just an OK movie. Not sure why everyone kept hyping it saying how great it was. Enjoyable - yes. Phenomenal - no.,1393372800,,120,4.041666666666667
4940768,4,B0063FQREO,Clearly a lot of money and creativity has been lavished on this movie.  It's a wonderful visual spectacle.  I haven't read the books so I can't comment on the accuracy of the plot.,1393372800,,180,4.424242424242424
4940769,5,B0063FQREO,"This movie is wonderful! So inspiring for young girls, I think, as it portrays a strong, smart heroine.  The violence is a bit disturbing, bit so important to the movie.  Love it!",1393372800,,179,4.5625
4940770,4,B0063FQREO,It was obviously a disturbing movie but well done and it was fun to watch it on the Kindle. The sound and image quality was great.,1393372800,,130,4.038461538461538
4940771,5,B0063FQREO,"I had read the book so I was anxious to see this movie and I was surprised at how good it was. It was entertaining, followed the book, and the actors did a good job. Next on the list is ""Catching Fire"".",1393372800,,202,3.8333333333333335
4940772,5,B0063FQREO,"Began watching movie on laptop. Sound volume was too low. Shifted to iPad without missing a syllable. Picture and sound quality, including volume, was outstanding.",1393372800,,163,5.56

4940774,3,B0063FQREO,"Story line was well done, though I've seen this before (remember the one with Arnold Schwarznegger?) years earlier. Jennifer Lawrence was a good choice for the role and very believable. Special effects well done. Just glad I got to see this for free under Amazon Prime.",1393286400,,269,4.869565217391305
4940775,5,B0063FQREO,I had the chance to see this movie in a local theatre but when I heard the concept of the movie I declined.  I had second thoughts this past weekend and was pleasantly surprised to see that the rental was free because I am a Amazon Prime member.....the movie at times was a bit hard to take but overall I loved the movie....,1393286400,,324,4.142857142857143
4940776,5,B0063FQREO,I really enjoyed the entire series it kept me wanting more it was one exciting chapter after another the movies were good as well,1393286400,,129,4.416666666666667

4940779,4,B0063FQREO,"Didn't want to see it in theaters, however We enjoyed it very much. We have ordered second one of series.
However we ordered it in Dec. and found out much later we will not receive it till around March 13.",1393286400,,205,4.15
4940780,3,B0063FQREO,"This young adult book has been praised many as enjoyable for all adults.  It is interesting and for the most part, well written, but it includes too much time dwelling on the inner thoughts of the main character.  What could have been subtle becomes tedious by the end of the book.  The premise, though alarming, is handled in such a manner as to actually be credible, and from the beginning, the reader is drawn into the story.  I do expect to read the next two books in the trilogy.",1393286400,,484,4.404494382022472

4940782,5,B0063FQREO,One of the best adaptations from a book to film. Loved the book. Love the movie  and Jennifer Lawrence is perfect as the lead.,1393286400,,126,4.25
4940783,4,B0063FQREO,"I recently read the books and thought they were great. However, like most book to movie adaptations it was missing something.  It felt like they rushed the story a bit. I loved the story line between Peeta and Katniss, the love story... it was completely lost in the movie. The games portion was rushed, what they said was weeks in the book felt like only a few days in the movie. I understand that they can't put everything from the book in the movies but I think they could have added more with the time they had.",1393286400,,515,4.309278350515464
4940784,5,B0063FQREO,"In my opinion, I thought the movie was great, plenty of story line,  and lots of action. It even has romance.",1393286400,,109,4.190476190476191

4940786,3,B0063FQREO,"The upside is that I really loved some ideas and scenes in this film. There just weren't enough of them. Maybe it suffered from having to deliver too much within the constraining timeframe of a feature film. If The Hunger Games had been a TV miniseries over, say 5 hrs., it might have been better.  But being a 2 hr. big budget movie, fleshing out a cornucopia of ideas and emotion was competing with the director's access to a cumpulsory arsenal of special effects, plus a chance to show teenagers locked in terminal gladiator-style combat. So not surprisingly, CGI stuff and mayhem won out. But who cares? The movie was a blockbuster so bottom line is that people who give it only 3 stars don't matter. Besides, we're the kind of people who don't buy concession junk food either. We sit at home and watch PBS and eat salads, right?",1393200000,,833,4.553333333333334
4940787,2,B0063FQREO,"I don't understand the accolades this movie has received.  I fell asleep in the first 15 minutes.  Highly rated, so maybe it's just me.  Glad I didn't pay to see this one at the theater.",1393200000,,186,4.257142857142857

4940791,3,B0063FQREO,Jennifer Lawrence was excellent in this film.  The futuristic special effects were interesting.  I did not like the violence depicted against kids,1393200000,,146,5.590909090909091
4940792,4,B0063FQREO,And I really was taken by it!  I can tell it was set up for sequels.  Jennifer Lawrence is just an amazing actor.  So young and so good!,1393200000,,136,3.7857142857142856
4940793,5,B0063FQREO,Was not sure how they ciuld make the book into a movie. They did a great job! Loved it. Looking forward to seeing the other 2 books/movies.,1393200000,,139,4.185185185185185

So okay, I liked it so much, I've already pre-ordered Hunger Games: Catching Fire. Thank you Amazon for having the best prices, and new DVD's at my doorstep on the day they're released!",1393200000,,336,4.435483870967742
4940797,5,B0063FQREO,"So true to the book.  It was well acted, graphics were beautiful.  I was afraid the film would be dark and dreary...very surprised at how colorful in the appropriate scenes.  A movie not to be missed!",1393113600,,200,4.5
4940798,1,B0063FQREO,"Firstly for all of you reviewers, never compare a movie to a book it is simply foolish; books and movies are two different things and if I have to read a book to understand the movie then the movie is a failure. I am at a loss to try to understand how the makers of this film found a way to turn a girl into a hero that did absolutely nothing but get others killed. Katniss is a complete fraud. She is a manufactured hero. Other than that one tiny detail,  the movie is dull and boring to watch, I would recommend this movie to people with a sleep disorder of some sort that need to find a way to fall asleep.",1393113600,,609,3.9918032786885247
4940799,4,B0063FQREO,"Good movie, and suspense packed with a lot of action & mystery. Jennifer Lawrence did an excellent job and deserved all of the honors that went with her performance.",1393113600,,165,4.724137931034483

4940802,2,B0063FQREO,"Interesting concept for story, attractive actors and slick presentation.  The story does not hang together though.  Where are the destroyed cities?  Actors all look very well nourished. The creation of wild man-eating beasts by computer operators on the spurr of the moment is one of the most ridiculous examples of the invention of anything to carry the story with no preparation of the event or rational basis.  The killing was rampant, but the impact on the killers or the doing of the violence was masked to be of little dramatic effect.  The game part was nearly non-existent.  How did the alliance groups really work?  Were they formed by indoctrination of the youngsters from birth, knowing that one of the district would end up killing the other?  Again, very far fetched.

I am not a teenager, watched only to try  to understand why this was well received.  I understand from commentary on the movie that the dystopian setting was after horrible wars and global sea rise. Non of this was set up in the film or was it was done very obliquely and I missed it.  The dynamics of the districts versus the capital city oppressors was very incomplete. Why would such a system arise?  Why did the districts rebel in the first instance?

Lead actress did very well but looked much older/ mature than age 16.  I guess, it might be worth seeing if the sequels improved on this first of the sequels.  Otherwise, it might be better to devote time to some classics from the post world war II era, showing the impact of war on veterans and populations in a more thoughtful way.",1393113600,,1571,4.658181818181818

To be fair, I'm not into futuristic, apocolyptic type movies - especially when they center on our society having ""less"" and people needing to kill each other... blah, blah, blah.  The other day, my husband saw it on Amazon Prime account and wanted to see it so, I let him have the remote and I went into my office.  When the movie was over, I asked him what he thought and the response was ""Well, I can say that I've seen it"".",1392854400,,559,4.110091743119266

4940829,5,B0063FQREO,"Suzanne Collins trilogy is a fascinating story that  features (initially) 16 year old Katniss as she volunteers to enter a fight to the death to protect her 12 year old sister.  Katniss has been providing food and other things for her sister and her mother, who went into a depression following Katniss's father's death in the coal mines of Panem's District 12.  In this DVD, director Gary Ross brings Suzanne's book to life.  Ross's ability to reaching the fans of The Hunger Games by staying true to the novel is key to the making of this movie.  His choice of the cast also reflects the strength of direction that he brought to this film.  With Jennifer Lawrence as Katniss, Josh as Peeta,  and Liam as Gale, he has a trio that brings printed words to life on film.  Jennifer's rextraordinary ability to bring the feelings and fears of Katniss to life is both entertaining and inspiring to its viewers.",1392768000,,905,4.647798742138365

4940831,4,B0063FQREO,"I enjoyed it but as usual, the movie did not really do the book justice.  There was just so much missing that seemed really relevant to the story.  Oh well!  That's just the way it is I guess.  Too bad because the book was so much better.",1392768000,,238,4.0
4940832,5,B0063FQREO,"Great movie!  We'd already seen it, though, so I knew we'd like it.  It's a reminder what can happen to a society that allows the government total control.  Some think children shouldn't see it, but I believe it opens up a great dialogue about courage, right and wrong in the face of a subtly evil dictatorship.  Look at the Nazi youth.  Do you think they could have been indoctrinated into becoming killers if they were aware of the possibility beforehand?  I don't want my kids to be unaware of the dangers of blindly following leadership that encourages disobedience to God.

I miss the bonus stuff you get w/ an actual DVD, but the digital version is really handy.  We took a 4-hour trip, and we were able to download it to a device before we left.  Made the trip go by faster.  We also like that we can watch it through our Wii on the TV.  It doesn't come through in HD via the Wii, though.",1392768000,,895,4.331325301204819

Abject poverty,a cruel lottery that selects young people as gladiators, in a futuristic televised arena, to battle each other until only one lives, shows that man's cruelty to man is still part of the world's play.  The movie keeps you at the edge of your seat until the conclusion.",1392768000,,339,4.633333333333334

Blatant filler for #3.

Jennifer Lawrence does an amazing job portraying Katniss Everdeen.

Although the rebellion was dreamed about by adults it takes the extreme courage of two young people to begin to turn the tide.  Although we are introduced to the worst possible living conditions and the horror of trading one's life for a young one's life is very revolting, at the end the heroes take center stage.  The cruel dictator sees his totalitarian authority begin to erode.

The interesting aspect of this book and movie deals with the pathetic self-absorbed people enjoying the bloody demise of so many youth.  To watch the political bargaining to keep a chosen one alive or to kill a chosen one is nauseous. Yet, the characters draw you into rooting for them or even against them.  The book allows you to imagine what and how. The movie skips a lot (only if you've read the book).  In the end, you will be rooting for the youth to find a way to stop the madness.",1392508800,,1013,4.532967032967033

4940880,3,B0063FQREO,Never got to finish watching it because Amazon Prime streaming has been disconnecting several times during the movie and not reconnecting meanwhile the internat is fully up and running just Amazon steaming seems to be the only problem at the time of this review.,1392508800,,262,4.9772727272727275

I don't know if this is someone's idea of what they think this country is headed for in our future or what.  The ending made me wonder if the movie was over or not.  Are they hoping for a sequel or could they just not figure out how to end it?  Sorry, this didn't do much for me.",1392422400,,363,3.9178082191780823

It's over 2 hours long, but you won't notice the time because the movie keeps your attention.  We are anxiously awaiting March 7, 2014 when the sequel, Catching Fire will be released.

4940889,4,B0063FQREO,"I thought the actors/acting did a great job. the cinematography was impressive, too. The reason I gave it 4 stars vs. 5 is the movie would be difficult to follow at times, if you haven't read the book.",1392422400,,201,4.315789473684211
4940890,4,B0063FQREO,"While not as good as the book (most movies aren't) this adaptation was done very well. The young actors doe an excellent job portraying their character and Donald Sutherland makes a wonderfully evil President. I don't want to say too much that would spoil it for anyone who hasn't read the books, but there are two more parts of this trilogy and IMHO the second one is best.

Just finished reading all three of the books for the first time and wanted to refresh on the movie.  I have to say this was an excellent adaptation of the first book.

World between the rich versus poor - the rich fighting to sustain their growing wealth and the poor attempting to reach to it's wealth for a chance of a better life.  From the beginning to end, you follow your instinct not the crowd - and there you will find peace.",1392336000,,443,4.378048780487805

We watch Katniss hunting for food before the games, see her waxed and styled and given fighting tips from a Games survivor, and then watch her run and jump, and empty her quiver as others die around her. The story-line, settings and costumes are re-hashed from films like The Running Man, The Most Dangerous Game,  Logans Run, and even The Wizard of Oz, but it will still be widely popular with this new generation of film-watchers.",1392336000,2,729,4.870967741935484

For anyone whom has not read the books, they might not feel any connection with the characters, which is a shame. The second film ""Catching Fire"" comes much closer to the book, better character development, etc. Can't wait until it's available so I can see it again.",1392336000,,444,4.5625

4940928,4,B0063FQREO,"I liked this movie - I gave it 4 stars because it's visually pretty and fairly well acted. However, if I had not read the books, I doubt this movie would have gotten more than two stars, as I would not have understood what was actually going on.

I also have to say that casting might have been better. When I read the books, the person I pictured as President Snow was Malcolm McDowell. I like Donald Sutherland, who has had a long and lucky career - but he simply didn't have the complete ""rotten-ness"" that the character was supposed to possess. He was ""mean,"" but just didn't permeate ""evil.""

The same with the ""Peeta"" and ""Gayle"" roles - I believe I would have reversed those two actors.

Not sure how HG 2 will fare - since all three books are basically the same action, just with various motivations, and since 2 brings us to no conclusion (and the motivations are more subtle), I'm just not sure that it will be much fun to see another similar movie that really won't have an ""ending"" (well, except for setting us up for 3).  :)",1392163200,,1037,4.357512953367876

4940932,4,B0063FQREO,"Succinct and to the point....I didn't read the book yet but thought this movie was well done but typical underdog rises to the top scenario.  I thought that there were way too many 'saves' for Catniss in this story though.

4940982,5,B0063FQREO,I think the movie is great and the theme is very well timed..  A lot of power and money in the hands of a few.  There is a saying about power corrupts..,1391904000,,152,3.71875

4940987,3,B0063FQREO,"if you don't have anything else to do -- but certainly not a great movie.  It revolves around an amoral society -- nothing really redeeming about it.  Of course, I enjoyed seeing Jennifer Lawrence's amazing talent in action.",1391817600,,224,4.868421052631579
4940988,5,B0063FQREO,"When I enjoy a movie, it's because I don't have to over think it.  It is good acting so I don't notice the actors are acting.  The scenery is good so I don't have to think about it being realistic.  The plot is interesting so I don't have to think of what would have been better.  The Hunger Games was an entertaining movie.  I was entertained by it.  No need to over think it.",1391817600,2,377,4.027027027027027

4940998,5,B0063FQREO,It is very difficult to get past the storyline of kids killing kids but does do a good job of stirring your call to action to end the game. Excellent storyline.,1391817600,,160,4.193548387096774
4940999,4,B0063FQREO,Finally decided to watch and glad I did. Maybe just a little violent for young children.  Amazon prime is definitely worth the money.,1391817600,,133,4.782608695652174

Cant wait to try again.

Waiting for the sequel to be available!",1391731200,,99,3.9
4941005,5,B0063FQREO,This movie was very close to the book. I'm not one to watch the movie after having read the book usually because they change too many details.  No regrets with this movie. It follows the book quite well and is enjoyable to watch.,1391731200,,229,4.325581395348837
4941006,5,B0063FQREO,Compelling and heartwarming and violent - although not as violent as the book. I watched it on Amazon prime while away from home and it was the perfect entertainment.,1391731200,,166,4.758620689655173

4941009,5,B0063FQREO,"Great film. Interesting characters. Jennifer Lawrence is engaging and great to look at. Not usually the type of film I watch, but I ended up reading the trilogy and watching all the movies so far-- so that's something.",1391731200,,218,4.7631578947368425
4941010,5,B0063FQREO,"Unfortunately, my review might be biased by the book, which is outstanding, and my admiration for Jennifer Lawrence as an actor.  While the story is not new, the twist is original and the plot is engaging.  The books are geared toward young adults, though I sometimes wonder if they will pick up on all of the political nuances, particularly when some aspects get barely a passing mention in the movie when they are devoted more coverage in the book.  There is something for everyone in this film -- action, intrigue, sci-fi tech and futuristic themes, romance and even a little dark humor.  Like all of her movies, Lawrence does a fantastic job with this character and the movie is one I have watched over and over.",1391731200,,716,4.658730158730159

4941013,3,B0063FQREO,"Not your typical Hollywood movie, so three cheers for that. Set in a post-rebellion dystopia. Jennifer Lawrence carried the movie for me. Other characters I could take or leave.  Worth a watch. Probably more appealing to a younger crowd.",1391644800,,237,5.076923076923077
4941014,5,B0063FQREO,This movie is great. Jennifer Lawrence is fantastic. The movie was cast wonderfully. If you have read the books this is a must see. Of course now we have seen Catching Fire which believe it or not surpasses The Hunger Games.,1391644800,,224,4.487804878048781
4941015,5,B0063FQREO,good flick kept interest good acting long movie but does not feel like it is fast moving engaging entertainment two thumbs up,1391644800,,125,4.7272727272727275
4941016,5,B0063FQREO,"I saw it in a cinema first and was one of my best science fiction movie experience. So I decided to watch it again on a business trip in the hotel room. I was not disappointed, still a very good movie! I will definitely watch the continuation of it. In a cinema first, of course!",1391644800,,279,4.090909090909091

4941018,5,B0063FQREO,I have read all the books and the movie stays pretty close to the literature. I loved this movie just as much as the book which is a rare thing for me. Great must see movie!,1391644800,,173,3.8333333333333335
4941019,2,B0063FQREO,"I purchased The Hunger Games  DVD as a birthday present for a friend who is crazy about the series. We watched it  together, she loved the movie since she has read the complete series of books. I just could not get the message in the story about young people having to kill each other just for food or fame whatever it was they are trying to accomplish. Not great to my taste, that's the reason why I only rate the movie 2 stars",1391644800,,428,4.144578313253012
4941020,4,B0063FQREO,"I thought this was a very good movie, though not the best of the best -- hence four rather than five stars.  At first, it seemed too violent.  But that must be weighed against the complexity of the characters and the quality of writing.  It could certainly be seen as an allegory of our present-day widening gap between the haves and have-nots, and even of American football.",1391644800,,375,4.567164179104478
4941021,5,B0063FQREO,"We loved this movie - it was suspenseful and kept our interest.  Good for the whole family - when our youngest is 10, that is.",1391644800,,126,4.04
4941022,5,B0063FQREO,"The book was well written.  The movie script kept to the best of the story line.  The heroic female character betters her male contestants in the ultimate battle of life and death while showing empathy and compassion.  The cast of the movie is excellent with experienced, recognized top quality members of the guild and the set designs are contrasting opulent to poverty of a coal mining community. Again with emphasis on the underdog rising to the top.  Romance is at a minimum level and trumped by compassion.",1391644800,,511,4.839080459770115

4941024,2,B0063FQREO,"The Hunger Games was an amazing book that was fresh and creative. This is another movie with too much money that placed more emphasis on the background than the actually central plot. The acting was poor, except Cinna and Haymitch. The familiar faces of acting Katniss and Peeta took away the purpose of a random pair that was chosen from the Reaping. The movie had the general storyline, but did not fulfill my expectations",1391558400,,424,4.743243243243243

4941039,5,B0063FQREO,"We did not choose to watch ""The Hunger Games"" in the theater, as we thought it was going to be too violent. The movie promoters did not do themselves any good by showing some of the most violent scenes in the trailers. Actually, while there certainly is violence, most of the movie is centered around a thought provoking struggle for mental, and perhaps, eventually, physical freedom. WELL WORTH seeing!",1391558400,,403,4.855072463768116

4941041,4,B0063FQREO,"The Hunger Games is a movie that is about a girl who is chosen for battle to the death over the course of a couple weeks.  Before you see the movie I recommend you read the book first.  When watching the movie no one is really introduced.  After you read the book you will understand what is going on during the movie.  The movie is really good, but personally I think they could have done better.  When the movie was made it was based on her perspective, which involved shifting cameras and so forth.  I think it was a good idea, but it just did not work.  I think they did a good job with the scenes, background materials, and sound effects.  Overall I think the movie was still really good.",1391472000,,693,4.236641221374046

4941043,5,B0063FQREO,"Totally awesome movie, the action and drama are something else, I would recomende this movie to everyone it is so good!!!!!!!!",1391472000,,126,5.0476190476190474
4941044,3,B0063FQREO,"Average at best though I didn't mind watching it too much.  Weaknesses:  Superficial characterizations and plot, very little tension, mostly predictable.  In time of starvation and deprivation...why are all the central characters from the impoverished outlying ""districts"" healthy and fit...like Olympic athletes?  She  (J.Law.) chows down on a piece of bread like she's starving...but she's so healthy looking it's not believable.  Put all those make-up artists to work -- you know the one's on set creating the superfluously coiffed hair of the elitist city dwellers inhabiting later scenes.

Conflict for protagonist?  Minimal.  She (J.Lawrence) never really had to face the most difficult decisions...in fact her major decisions are reflexive.  Who would let their helpless kid sibling get slaughtered?  Not just helpless, but more helpless than all the other kids her age...based on her reactions on day of lottery.  No one...no one with a heart, so that's not really a choice -- it's like a reflex anyone would have.  When she kills later...it's reflexive...in self defense or in defense of another.  But will she kill the cute and mostly likeable male from her district?  The conflict always remains in the background as minor and gets resolved easily.  She never has a tough decision here...she never places him in the sights of her drawn bow and trembles with doubt.  To do so, then sacrifice yourself for him...then love him for his sacrifice...this would lift the heart of the audience -- at least to above average heights.  Perhaps, by now, I've forgotten the strengths...",1391472000,,1584,5.243027888446215
4941045,4,B0063FQREO,"It is a 5 because it was suspenseful and was able to create empathy and compassion for the main female character. It had deception, loyalty, love, betrayal and laughs...the  ingredients needed for a great film",1391472000,,209,4.9714285714285715
4941046,3,B0063FQREO,"Very loud music in places.  Science Fiction.  She runs through the forest falling down, wading in water but never gets dirty. Hair is combed. No dirt on her clothes.  She is escaping from people trying to kill her.  Interesting movie but not for me..",1391472000,,250,4.613636363636363
4941047,5,B0063FQREO,The time flew as you got so involved in this movie!  Heaven help us if this happens in the country.  You definitely cheered for the heroine and felt bad as some of the others died! Wild clothes and hair styles made it a very bright and interesting movie and the beauty of the woods balanced it out.,1391472000,,298,4.2105263157894735
4941048,5,B0063FQREO,Followed the book.  Well done.  It is worthwhile for science fiction.  Looking forward to the movie on the second book,1391472000,,118,4.8

4941052,4,B0063FQREO,Not as good as the book.  I am glad I read it before seeing the movie.  But they did well with a great deal of sub-plots to try and cover.,1391385600,,138,3.566666666666667

4941057,5,B0063FQREO,The Hunger Games was a great movie!  I read all the books and this one was true to the story.  A lot of movies that are based on books are rewritten and a lot of things are changed.  This was a good one and I can't wait to see the 2nd one.,1391385600,,239,3.5576923076923075
4941058,3,B0063FQREO,"Solid movie, did a decent job covering the story in the book, but like lots of books urn into movies, the book was far superior.  Not sure if I had seen the movie before reading he book how I would have felt.  It was good, just not great.",1391385600,,238,3.9375

4941065,5,B0063FQREO,I thought this was going to be a chick flick because od Facebook talk but then I actually watched the trailer and found out what the movie was all about. Watched it and it was awesome. You can definitely relate that something like this could happen in the future. Story line and acting was excellent. Glad I gave it a chance. I highly suggest checking it out. There is a reason why everyone says it was awesome. Just watch it and thank me after.,1391385600,,445,4.309523809523809

4941068,4,B0063FQREO,Movie is ok.  But the movie streaming was so bad.  Had to stop and use Netflix. Will not recommend.  This should be free with that type of quality.,1391385600,,147,4.178571428571429
4941069,2,B0063FQREO,"Watched this movie because of all the reviews we heard about it. I don't get what the excitement was about. It was just an OK movie with a really sadistic story line. Too much blood and gore thats totally not needed to tell the story. And we wonder why our children take human life so lightly. lets keep producing trash movies like this to de sensitize them even more. Lets show them how to be all for me me me me and kill their peers to get what they want. The acting was just so so, wait to watch it for free.",1391385600,,511,4.019607843137255

I saw the movie in the Theater would not watch it again it is kind of depressing,  My grand daughter and I went to see it and had planned to see Monumental the same night but decided against it and was very glad we did, We loved Monumental, and she liked Hunger Games but they would not be companion back to back movies.  I own Monumental, I have only seen Hunger Games once.
I love historical Documentaries. don't like fiction that is two close to what is happening in our world to day.",1391299200,2,565,4.072072072072072
4941079,5,B0063FQREO,"This movie is true to the book. Yes, it is a little slow, but if you have read the books, you can recall that the first book (and the third) was tad slow, especially to start with. The second is the best book, and most likely movie, of the three. Jennifer Lawrence plays Katniss to a tee.",1391299200,,288,4.0701754385964914

4941081,3,B0063FQREO,"This was very violent and the entire film has the presence of fear.  I thought this was extremely violent for a tween-teen target audience it was created for.  I do not like the underlying element that human life has lost all value.  I realize it is ""make-believe"", however, the themes that tend to play out in Hollywood- seem to greatly influence the themes becoming reality in our society.  Whether should be or not..it is.",1391299200,,425,4.702702702702703
4941082,2,B0063FQREO,Don't know what the fuss is all about. This movie was flat. There was little that was likable or interesting about the characters. The story plot is interesting. But the gruesomeness of watching kids killing kids was not something I want to entertain myself with.,1391299200,,263,4.866666666666666

4941084,4,B0063FQREO,Have now watched this movie and Catching fire 3 times and read the books twice.  Noticed some differences in production style  between the two but they have done well in tracking with the books.  It will be interesting to see if the franchise can keep up the momentum while splitting up the final dance into two installments.,1391299200,,325,4.666666666666667
4941085,4,B0063FQREO,"To say I approached this one with trepidation is an understatement.  I bought it on sale Christmas 2012 and it sat on my shelf collecting dust.  I was intrigued by its popularity but was leery of its central premise of kids killing kids essentially for adult bloodlust.  Wasn't this in essence a form of child exploitation?  What was perplexing to me was its popularity among kids.  Having now seen it some of my questions have been answered but my fears haven't been entirely quelled.  The sight of kids engaging in hand-to-hand combat to the death still turns my stomach but maybe that's the point of the creators of the books and films who would make the reverse argument that this is a metaphor for adult violence.  I think kids also embrace the heroine, Katniss Everdeen, charismatically played by Jennifer Lawrence.  Katniss is not portrayed as a killer but a survivor. This flick reminded me of ""Lord of the Flies"" by way of ""The Running Man"".  Give kids credit, though, for recognizing sophisticated irony and dark humor.  I would have liked this film to have gone more in depth about the futuristic society that stages these games but my guess is that is probably covered in future installments.  Bring on ""Catching Fire""! R.I.P. Philip Seymour Hoffman.",1391299200,,1262,4.823255813953488

4941107,5,B0063FQREO,"I believe it is essential that you have read the book before seeing the movie to truly appreciate what a great job the film makers did.  It was enjoyed by all of us, even those who had not read the story, but it follows the book so well you get a better idea of what is happening all the time.

The actors, each and every one, do a superb job staying in character and the characters match quite well with the original story.  Unlike some movies, like Godfather where the don was James Bond smooth and was portrayed as a mumbly jumble Marlon Brando, there is no disappointment in the screen personas.

The special effects are superb as well.

Easily a 5 star film.",1391212800,,663,4.314516129032258

Awful, vapid and shallow. mind numbingly boring. I'm not sure if someone could smoke enough herb to make this movie watchable. Yecch!

Had recently purchased ""The Searchers"" from amazon in order to follow up the book ""Empire of The Summer Moon"". Not really not into westerns anymore but I had to see the movie as it was based on a good deal of the true history in the book about the great  Comanche wars that took place in Texas and on the plains in the mid to late 1800's.

Incredible book. The Searchers movie re -acquainted me with the utterly great movies, actors and directors who knew how to pull you deeply into a story and not let you go. Utterly superb movie The Searchers. The Hunger Games crew would not be worthy to clean up after the horses in the Searchers.

4941119,4,B0063FQREO,My husband and I really didn't know much about The Hunger Games and found that we enjoyed it much more than we expected.  It was exciting and well done.  Also appreciated that it was without vulgar language or explicit sex.  The storyline probably makes it not appropriate for young children but otherwise would consider it a family movie.  We were glad we watched it and look forward to seeing the next one in the trilogy.,1391126400,,423,4.6

4941121,2,B0063FQREO,I know everyone says that this is a great movie but I just couldn't buy into the premise during the first 5 minutes. I just can't believe that any modern society would allow a death-duel as part of their culture.,1391126400,,212,4.325

I must say that the second installment in the trilogy is better than than the first, however I would recommend both to anyone that enjoyed the books. Truly looking forward to the third & final film!",1391040000,,398,4.115384615384615

4941144,4,B0063FQREO,There was a lot of character development in the book that the movie just didn't have time for.  The whole background of the Hunger Games was important and without the book I'm not sure I'd have enjoyed the movie as much as I did.  I think I might have found it confusing how all the pieces fit together.  The movie was a real treat and did a great job of locking in my mental visuals.  The action scenes are absolutely awesome!,1391040000,,427,4.234567901234568

4941147,2,B0063FQREO,"I probably shouldn't review this film as I am not into futuristic or science fiction movies. I watched to see what the shouting was all about. I would say acting is good - but like so many other recent releases, toooooo long.",1391040000,,225,4.380952380952381

I appreciate how it appeals to multiple age groups and that, as an adult, I do not have to be embarrassed to admit that I am a District 12 fan. These movies are very well made and nothing that was on the big screen was lost in translation when put onto Blu-Ray discs. All of the imagery and sound quality is still intact and I can enjoy the movie at home just as I did in the theater.",1390953600,,549,4.045871559633028
4941151,5,B0063FQREO,"This one was riveting...and the feels! OMG, the feels! Hunger Games just lifts you up and guts you in the stomach with a brutal reality. Jennifer Lawrence does well as do most of the teenage/child actors in bringing to life the characters they have even with little screen time. It reminds me of a cross between Lord of the Flies and The Lottery with some Brave New World thrown in for back drop.",1390953600,,396,4.438356164383562

4941154,5,B0063FQREO,I loved the movie in the theater and wanted a copy for myself.  The Blue-Ray copy I received was in excellent condition and was delivered rapidly.  Thanks you.,1390953600,,159,4.642857142857143
4941155,1,B0063FQREO,This is basically a movie about how a wayward society has forced children to kill one another for the entertainment of it.  Not sure how we should view this as entertainment and really didn't get any sort of higher purpose to the film.,1390953600,2,235,4.465116279069767
4941156,3,B0063FQREO,The movie was ok and since I'm a older dude in my late forties this movie was not made for my age group.  I do love science fiction so there is some of that in the movie but very little.  I do recommend the movie but barely.,1390953600,,224,3.74468085106383
4941157,3,B0063FQREO,"The books had me hooked, but then I pictured a war torn country in which gladiators were selected to fight until death in some sort of sick, twisted political propaganda game.  The movie follows that story line, but turns it into a PG-13, Twilight/ Disney version short of emotions and character depth.  If you have read the books, don't bother with the movie.

On another note, I love Amazon Prime and the included amazon instant video selection.  I view the movies on my television, but recently switched from streaming through my computer to streaming through xbox one.  For some reason, the video quality has diminished greatly, and I had to resort to streaming through my computer again for now.",1390953600,,700,4.848739495798319

4941162,5,B0063FQREO,Superb plot combined with very good acting made this a recipe for a very entertaining movie. It's good to see that the studios are still capable of producing better movies.,1390953600,,172,4.766666666666667

4941167,4,B0063FQREO,It's a solid movie that is entertaining.  The only complaint I have is that it leaves out parts that I think would add depth to the story from the book.,1390953600,,152,4.066666666666666
4941168,5,B0063FQREO,I thought that the movie dealt with a whole range of emotion- which was what gave Katniss her advantage in the competition.,1390953600,,123,4.636363636363637
4941169,4,B0063FQREO,"I liked the movie.  I thought they did a good job of matching things up with the book.  If they had put everything from the book in there, it would have been 4 hours long, so I was glad they kept it as fluid as they could without going overboard.  It actually made me want to go back and read the book again.  :)",1390953600,,312,3.828125

4941172,5,B0063FQREO,"I enjoyed the movie on the big screen, it was indeed a scifi, futuristic treat. The plot was within the realm of believable fiction that should be enjoyed by the rated PG-13 audience",1390953600,,182,4.545454545454546
4941173,2,B0063FQREO,It wasn't all that.  I think they should've eaten the berries.  Romeo & Juliet.  However it is worth watching. 2 stars,1390953600,,118,4.523809523809524
4941174,1,B0063FQREO,"If you haven't read the book it would be hard to grasp the story. For example, during the pre-game interviews, how would someone who hasn't read the book know what Peeta is talking about when he asks Caesar if he smells like roses?

4941182,5,B0063FQREO,"Most movies destroy books.  They change it beyond all recognition.  This movie did not.  The changes made were to integrate the overall story from first person narrative and her thoughts to a visual and dialogue narrative.  The visuals were stunning.  The last 10 minutes alone I could watch over and over.  Everyone talks about Jennifer Lawrence- for very good reason, but Donald Sutherland gives the performance of his life.  And having seen ""Catching Fire""  I can tell you he is continuing to do so.  I loved these books, more than any other in a long, long time; and I love this movie.  I saw it twice in the theatre, and once (so far) on Amazon Prime.  When all of them are offered as a set, I will buy them.",1390867200,,713,4.449612403100775

Husband hadn't heard of it and wasn't sure if he would like it, but decided he didn't want to scroll through so many pages of other options, so he went with my choice.  I got so caught up in the story and wasn't really wondering if he was enjoying it (not a normal thing for me), but I knew he was hooked when he started yelling ""Shoot the apple!

4941189,5,B0063FQREO,Movie was great. I would recommend watching it. The special effects were very good. We may watch it again soon,1390867200,,110,4.55
4941190,3,B0063FQREO,"The acting was good. Special effects were well-done.  Story line was not altogether unique.  A wealthy ruling class keeping the ""drones"" under their thumb -- a great disparity between the 1 percenters and the rest of us. There were aspects of it that reminded me of Mad Max Beyond Thunderdome, particularly the scenes with the emcee.  Maybe I should have seen it coming but the ending has a bit of a twist to it.  I wasn't particularly impressed with Woody Harrelson's role.  Jennifer Lawrence did a great job of acting.  It isn't something I would go out of my way to see again. It wasn't bad, just something I would not nominate for an Academy Award.",1390867200,,652,4.577586206896552

4941211,3,B0063FQREO,"Obviously to me, this story was designed to have a part 2. Either because they could not summarize a completion in part 1, or just as a formula piece to have two movies with blockbuster gate expectations.
The main acting was strong and had good character development drawing us into the abstract ideas of children fighting to the death for the entertainment of a crowd detached from any sense of reality. There had to be an agenda that this story allegorizes. A number of parallels can be drawn between this and other sci-fiis like The Matrix, which did make us consider what we think is real and what really is!
The story has its moments. It also left me empty. There was no real victory even though they crowned 'champions' who would have failed if it were not for outside help. In that sense they only won because of the combined wishes of the audience and some of the competitors. I guess the losers [also the dead] would call that cheating.

4941227,4,B0063FQREO,"I did like this movie, although a bit of an odd story.  My almost 11 year old has recently asked to see it since the 2nd one is out at the theaters.  I had been reluctant because of the violence and not sure how she would deal with the brutal killings.  She did like it however and I think watching it with a parent is best for anyone under 13 years.  The lead female character does appear to be a caring person put into a situation that is beyond her control.

4941229,5,B0063FQREO,"Don't get me wrong - I quite liked the book The Hunger Games.  It's not the best written book, though - the writing is nothing super spectacular.  It's narrated from Katniss' point of view, and, well, much of the time she sounds like the teenager that she is.  I think the filmmakers put so much TLC into the film because of the widespread popularity of the book, meaning that, if readers who saw the movie were disappointed, the movie would fail to bring in any profits.  The directing, the acting, and the script-writing were really well done.  It was the best translation from book to film that I'd seen in a long time.  I liked it better than the original book, mainly because the WRITING was so much better.  I've watched this movie several times, but I've only read the Hunger Games trilogy once.  Even people who haven't read the book can enjoy the movie and know what's going on, unlike the Harry Potter films (all us HP readers got it, but I have friends who just could not figure out what was going on in one or the other of the HP movies).",1390608000,,1050,4.376288659793815

The theme is worn out; you know; RollerBall, A.I., Recall, The Running Man, etc...etc. There are very good actresses  and actors in this movie that could have chosen a film that plays upon their talents...but they didn't.

Of course, you can't fit all of the details but they've done a really great job.

4941241,3,B0063FQREO,"Film is collaborative. Writing is frequently derivative. Collins has written a series of compelling stories and the  screen adaptations have been more than competent. Her stubborn refusal to acknowledge Takami's ""Battle Royale"" as a source strains credulity, to put it mildly, and is both mean-spirited and incomprehensible, as it would  in no way diminish her own work. See both. Make up your own mind.",1390521600,,403,5.28125

Just signed up for Prime and this was our first movie.  The one disappointment with the transmission, vs. Netflix, was that when there was a slight hiccup in the download half way through, the movie restarted from the beginning instead of resuming.  I couldn't find a menu readily but fast forward got us close to where we had been.  I will have to check settings to see if there is a preset for resume vs. restart.",1390435200,,644,4.47008547008547

4941269,5,B0063FQREO,Saw the movie and then went back and read the book. The book filled in some missing information not in the movie and gave a better understanding of the full story. Just completed book 2 and have started book 3.,1390348800,,210,4.275

I was told to read the book, since the film medium fails to give you much more than scant information about why the the games are held and who are the haves and have nots.

The never-ending camera movement and incessant cutting are majorly in the way of what would have otherwise been an okay movie.

The acting of Harrelson was amazing for him. Story was depressing showing off the worst characteristics of those in power as being base. It was Rome revisited at its worst.

4941299,5,B0063FQREO,"Jennifer Lawrence is stunning in this winner-takes-all thriller. As someone who hasn't yet read the book, I would have liked a little more explanation about some of the  origin and nuances of the games and the lottery for the participants and their ""trainer"", Woody Harrelson.
Still a great action movie.",1390262400,,304,5.08
4941300,5,B0063FQREO,The movie moves at a nice pace.  It is entertaining and has clear identification of good vs evil.  The sequels are set up nicely and should also be fun.  I recommend it.,1390262400,,169,4.21875

4941302,3,B0063FQREO,I actually think that this movie deserves 3 1/2 stars.  The acting was good and it stayed true to the book.  I believe both the movie and the book were intended for a young adult demographic.,1390176000,,191,4.277777777777778
4941303,5,B0063FQREO,"I thought it was a good movie and pretty true to the book and gave some interesting ""side stories"" that were not in the book but did not detract from the theme of the book.  Looking forward to the next one -- Catching Fire.",1390176000,,223,4.068181818181818

Although I didn't I would enjoy the second movie that much, I was totally blown away at my interest in it.  I love Donald Sutherland and his character only enhanced the movie.

4941313,2,B0063FQREO,Elements of the plot were not clear to me.  It seemed to presuppose you already understood the background of the hanger games and glossed over the set-up for those of us who had not read the book.. But the main idea was clear.  You were going to watch  24 kids fight until only one was alive. It was engaging and imaginative but that kind of violence does not make me feel entertained..,1390176000,,386,4.333333333333333

4941316,3,B0063FQREO,Good story. Maintained my interest.  I did not read the novel to act as a comparison and do not expect I will.  If there is one criticism I could make it would be that the atmosphere the movie portraited of a dystopian world could have been darker and more sinister.,1390176000,,266,4.3
4941317,5,B0063FQREO,"I honestly thought I wouldn't like this movie. I never even expected to watch it. My daughter loves the books/movies and because of her I went ahead and started watching it, I am so glad I did.",1390176000,,193,4.243243243243243

4941325,4,B0063FQREO,"I thought the acting in this movie was excellent. I really like Jennifer Lawrence. The story plot was quite intriguing. The movie captivated my attention throughout to the end. If you liked the Twilight saga, you will enjoy this. I would not recommend it for young kids j(under 12) as I think the subject matter of kids being forced to kill each other to survive is too mature for young audiences.",1390089600,,397,4.605633802816901

4941332,2,B0063FQREO,"I found it a B movie that should never have been made.  Here is a story that almost says something important about violence and authoritarians but settles for delivering children killing children as a substitute for entertainment.  Unfortunately, it says more about the audience than anything else.  I like and enjoy a good B movie.  Not this one.",1390089600,,347,4.931034482758621
4941333,5,B0063FQREO,Was way more than I expected. Very good movie. I would recommend this movie. 5 STARS All AROUND. no small children should watch.,1390089600,,128,4.608695652173913
4941334,3,B0063FQREO,"Never had that feel that you were in a dystopian society, were you could feel the repression, or care about that part.  Could have emphasized more of building that and less on the games themselves.  Thought the F/X were a bit cheesy at times, and it lost me when they decided they can create creatures or fire to control the outcome of the ""games"".",1390089600,,348,4.421875
4941335,5,B0063FQREO,"I was hesitate to first watch this movie, but when I did I was hooked! I'm sad to admit that I went into this obsession with first watching the movie rather than reading the books first. If your planning on buying this movie I 100% recommend to hold on before buying it or at least buy it and wait! First read the books! I completely regret not giving the books a chance! Anyway, back to the movie, it's an amazing film Jennifer Lawrence is an amazing actress and captures Katniss perfectly, the same can be said about Josh Hutcherson and Peeta. The movie is dripping with suspense, and makes the viewer really think about how they would survive and deal with the Cruel Capitol. I would describe this movie as an Action and pushed Romance (you'll get it when you read and or watch it haha). Overall great movie highly highly recommend! But again read the books first! You'll enjoy the movie so much more!",1390003200,,904,4.484848484848484

4941340,5,B0063FQREO,Great storyline. Entertained through the whole movie. The graphic effects were done well and were very realistic.  Overall a must see.,1390003200,,134,5.380952380952381

4941342,4,B0063FQREO,Great coming of age movie. Raises questions about blindly following cultural tratditions. It will likely lead to a sequel. We'll done!,1390003200,,134,5.428571428571429
4941343,5,B0063FQREO,My husband selected this move and truthfully I initially watched it with skepticism (I greatly dislike violence and horror in movies). I must admit I was drawn into it and by the end thought it was really terrific! That was the second time he watched it and he liked it even better!,1390003200,,282,4.4423076923076925

4941347,3,B0063FQREO,"I found it to be kind of slow. So in comparison you would expect there to be a deeper story, but that is not the case either. I found several of the details that I might have found interesting to be unexplained. I might read the book series in order to fill in the gaps.",1390003200,,270,3.9272727272727272

4941362,3,B0063FQREO,"The Hunger Games Movie deviated from the book way too much.  I know you have to compress a book into a movie but at least get the important details right.  Right at the beginning, it hits you in the face, Katniss gets the mocking jay pin from a vendor in the market and gives it to Prim who returns i it to her sister to keep her safe in the games.  NO!  The mayor's daughter, Madge, gave the pin to Katniss and made her promise to wear it into the arena.  Very important.  Also the mayor read the history: it wasn't blasted from the Captol to a screen in the Seam.  The baker brought Katnis cookies and promised to look afterv Prim.  And how could ""Stay Alive"" have been let out.  It is what every reader mouthed when the first words of advise were uttered; and thereby missed what was really said on the screen for several seconds and took several more to regroup and get back into the movie.  ""Stay Alive would have become a catch phrase.  There were too many discrpencies to mention them all. So all I will say is, What's up with Katnisss' eyes",1389916800,,1048,4.242424242424242

Just an average action movie with a lot of predictable moments.",1389916800,,198,4.2368421052631575
4941365,4,B0063FQREO,"Having seen the big print and generous leading on the pages of the book, it was not my intention to see this movie. Nor was I predisposed to like it. But it was surprisingly captivating, mostly for the dramatically colorful sets and costuming, reminding me of that long ago bizarre movie ""Brazil.""  And although the story was sketchy, the acting was solid and the characters sympathetic. Enjoyable pic!",1389916800,2,402,4.911764705882353
4941366,5,B0063FQREO,Just as good the second time around. I wanted to watch this again before I see #2. Hope it is as great.,1389830400,2,103,3.727272727272727

4941368,5,B0063FQREO,A tremendous first in a wonderful trilogy. It stays so close to the book and takes fun if any liberties. I can't wait to see Catching Fire.,1389830400,,139,4.185185185185185

4941372,5,B0063FQREO,Great movie...the killings were very tastefully filmed. Not a lot of gore thank goodness when it came to killing people for sport. Looking forward to seeing second movie.,1389830400,5,170,5.107142857142857

4941374,3,B0063FQREO,"Filming reminded me of first Twilight film.  Storyline concept is new but film felt rushed in areas.  The idea of kids killing each other for spectator sport is slightly disturbing even when you know it's going to happen.  Some pg13 movies you might get away with four letting a child under that age to see, but I wouldn't allow my kids to watch before they are thirteen...that's for sure.",1389830400,,389,4.608695652173913

4941376,4,B0063FQREO,I gave this movie a 4 rating due to reading the books & I just felt they had changed a couple things & left a few things out. Although if you have no read the books then you should enjoy it,1389830400,,189,3.6341463414634148
4941377,5,B0063FQREO,The standard for dystopian tales. As a film it could not be as rich a story as the book. It still captures what is essential about the story with outstandingly writing and acting.,1389830400,,179,4.454545454545454
4941378,4,B0063FQREO,"So I got the deluxe edition because I am so obsessed right now whit the franchise.

I got the package all right, it was shipped on time, it even got here earlier than expected.

The digital copy has expired (I didn't read on the specifications if it was supposed to be) but no matter I get to see it on amazon prime just fine.

As for the box itself, it had little scratches on the bottom, that's the only reason I give this product 4 stars.",1389830400,,441,4.104651162790698

4941380,4,B0063FQREO,"I recently watched this movie. It was a good movie. I have read all of the books, as I generally try to read the book before seeing the movie.  I really liked the books and felt that as far as the first book and movie go the book was better, but the movie was still entertaining and well done. I generally feel the book is better than the movie, there are very few exceptions to that for me. Books always seem to be more detailed and filled with explanation that the movies seem to gloss over or skip, but I get that making a movie has different parameters and needs. I wouldn't sway anyone from seeing this movie, it is entertaining.  See it for yourself and see what you think.",1389830400,,679,4.2153846153846155
4941381,5,B0063FQREO,"Great movie that followed the book pretty closely, but it wasn't necessary to have read the book first.  Looking forward to the next film!",1389830400,,138,4.75
4941382,5,B0063FQREO,Great movie! Lot's of nail biting action. The characters were great along with the plot. I would watch this movie again.,1389830400,,120,4.761904761904762
4941383,3,B0063FQREO,"Heard a lot about the movie. Very good, a lot of action. So many people talking about how great it was...it was OK",1389830400,,114,4.0
4941384,5,B0063FQREO,"I must admit I was skeptical at first. Without reading the book first (my wife did) I assumed the story was one of these run of the mill fantasy adventures. Boy was I ever wrong. Fifteen minutes (it took me that long?) i commented to my wife, this is the Roman arena. The people at the bottom fighting to the death for the pleasure of the top 1 percent. Really brought it home for me. And  the actors were exceptional. Jennifer Lawrence was very good as she has been in other projects. She's the new game in town. Oh yes, one last comment, it's also like ESPN. It's all the ""Roman Arena"". A really metafore for our society.",1389830400,,623,4.279661016949152
4941385,5,B0063FQREO,Beautifully done. The story line itself is troubling but the acting was very good. The movie shows courage and compassion in a really messed up world,1389830400,,149,4.769230769230769
4941386,4,B0063FQREO,Overall a good movie. Nice pace. Acting is average - the main character is outstanding. Unique and interesting story. Makes me want to learn archery.,1389830400,,149,5.0
4941387,5,B0063FQREO,"yep, what title says. loved the movie, it followed the book almost perfect so I can easily enjoy both. found the same with its sequel and excited to see the series once its completed all together",1389830400,,195,4.444444444444445
4941388,2,B0063FQREO,Connection kept interrupting and would have exit the application and re-start. Wasn't very happy. Paid a lot of money for prime for it not to work properly.,1389830400,,156,4.814814814814815
4941389,5,B0063FQREO,"beautifully written , one of the most entertaining ways experience a government dictatorship. Its a must see. During the movie I as cheering for section 11 . heheheh. You have to see it to believe it",1389830400,,199,4.555555555555555
4941390,4,B0063FQREO,Streaming comes out very clear and very fast.  A great movie for everyone to see.  Can't wait for the other parts to come.,1389830400,,122,4.260869565217392

4941394,3,B0063FQREO,"Excellent production, but it is not the type of movies I could emotionally invest in.  Other then someone is willing to sacrifice her life to save her sister, there are few moral lessons to learn.",1389830400,,196,4.6
4941395,4,B0063FQREO,Great movie with an awesome story. Jennifer Lawrence really breaks out in this movie and it's going to be an awesome trilogy. I can't wait to read the books. Every character is awesome and the story is amazing,1389744000,,209,4.526315789473684
4941396,4,B0063FQREO,Well acted...disturbing to those who have no taste for visually absorbing today's youth~of seeing just how far one should or could reveal the extent of torture & distruction of ones own species. I don't believe that I am exaggerating the seriousness of just how damaging this film is..it is casted well~yet lingers the morbid reality of mis spent youth..a new generation of sociopaths,1389744000,,384,5.111111111111111
4941397,5,B0063FQREO,"perfect! Well worth any ones time to watch the stellar movie, REALLY!
I can hardly wait until the next movie is out.",1389744000,,116,4.318181818181818
4941398,4,B0063FQREO,"As a long time reader of fantasy and science fiction, I enjoyed this series and wondered how the movie would be. It was pretty close to the book but didn't show as much of the violence that it could have. Interesting convergence of futuristic things that survived the big war yet contrasting to the districts where they didn't was pretty well done.
Not a film for young children but I don't think that it ever claimed to be suitable for a young audience.",1389744000,,454,4.481927710843373
4941399,1,B0063FQREO,"This is one big rip off !!!. Tried for 2 hours too simply watch a movie, IMPOSSIBLE ! I paid 79.00 for this and you bill me 85.00 dollars. Give me my money back, and I will never your web site again. What a joke.",1389744000,,212,3.7333333333333334
4941400,5,B0063FQREO,"Why did I wait so long to watch this flick.  Action, plot, acting, and pace.  Watch this movie. It was that good.",1389744000,,113,4.090909090909091
4941401,5,B0063FQREO,"I enjoy a good movie and this was one of the best I've seen in awhile. Action, adventure, suspence even a little romance, but not too much. The movie is strongly suggestive of the excesses of Rome, in it's final days. The premise is that to stop wars they pull a male and female champion from each district (they have split the world/country into districts.) The champions are turned loose in the booby trapped forrest, to fight to the death.  Until one and only one emerges the ultimate champion for that year. Of course the powers that be are not content to allow natural selection to  decide which champion is truly champion. Like strange puppet-masters they feel it necessary to pull the strings and make the final outcome, one they control. The casting contains unknowns and well knowns. All of which did an excellent and believable job bringing this futuristic movie to the big screen.
I have to add that I bought an Amazon prime account at Christmas time (which literally paid for itself by New Years.) This account had a benefit that I didn't count on. I watched this movie, at no added cost and without joining a club, in the comfort of my living room. As I am not allowed in crowds and only leave the house for doctor appointments and trips to the hospital. I watch a lot of movies. Now I have an unlimited supply.",1389744000,,1324,4.535564853556485
4941402,5,B0063FQREO,The movie was very intriguing and held my attention throughout the whole movie.  Great picture and I highly recommend it to everyone.,1389744000,,133,5.045454545454546
4941403,5,B0063FQREO,IT WAS MUCH MORE THAN I THOUGHT HAD TO SEE FIRST ONE BEFORE I WATCH THE SECOND. WORTH IT.THANK YOU,1389744000,,98,3.95
4941404,5,B0063FQREO,"Such a good movie!  Spirit, determination, perserverance, courage, love at it's finest!  I've watched it 3 times and can't wait to see the sequel ""Catching Fire""!",1389744000,,162,5.1923076923076925
4941405,4,B0063FQREO,"Very gripping, keeps you interested throughout. Liked the fact that the movie didn't have much vulgar language. None would have been better!",1389744000,,140,5.409090909090909
4941406,4,B0063FQREO,I saw this in the theatre first and started watching it again on computer recently.  I loved the books and the movie was fairly true to the story.  Even though this book is for young readers I'd definitely not let children below 13 watch it.,1389744000,,241,4.333333333333333
4941407,3,B0063FQREO,"I did not read the books. Interesting premise for a story, nicely executed. Not my favorite kind of story (futuristic) but certainly well done.",1389744000,,143,5.0
4941408,5,B0063FQREO,"Movie was very well done, excellent acting, plot and special effects. The basic idea was a little disturbing but the film was believable in the context it outlined. Jennifer Lawrence is everything she's hyped to be and more.",1389744000,,224,4.921052631578948
4941409,5,B0063FQREO,"Great! Kept interest throughout...pretty close to the book. Look forward to the next movie..catching fire. Should be suspenseful, again .",1389744000,,137,5.9

4941411,5,B0063FQREO,What an exciting and inventive story!  Definitely one of those reads that I was sorry when it ended.  So glad there are sequels!,1389657600,,128,4.521739130434782
4941412,5,B0063FQREO,"The premise of this show is unsettling, but it is really captivating.  The movie is a must see.  I'm looking forward to the next one.",1389657600,,133,4.28
4941413,5,B0063FQREO,This movie was excellent. Jennifer Lawrence acting was great. I liked the special effects and costumes of the film. Can't wait for the sequel.,1389657600,,142,4.958333333333333

4941415,5,B0063FQREO,"Watched it an evening I didn't want to do anything and everybody was in bed. It was perfect. Nice plot, good actors, good set. I may actually watch it again with my wife who wanted to see it too ... but I didn't know.",1389657600,,217,3.9545454545454546
4941416,5,B0063FQREO,"...made ""fightclub"" seem lame. LOVED EVERY MINUTE OF IT. AND WOULD RECOMMEND IT TO MOVIE FANS EVERYWHERE. VERY GOOD MOVIE...YES!",1389657600,,128,5.45
4941417,4,B0063FQREO,"I tend to stay away from trilogies, except if the trilogy is based on Tolkien. I was extremely surprised and will watch the sequels. Good character development, flowed well. Set up solid, you find yourself becoming invested in the characters. Actually would probably watch again after some time has passed - one way I judge a movie. Would I be willing to watch again. Typically my answer is no. Once is enough but not in this case.",1389657600,,431,4.6103896103896105
4941418,4,B0063FQREO,A bit strange in the beginning but overall a good movie that will probably have a sequel. I'd watch again,1389657600,,105,4.3

4941423,4,B0063FQREO,"After a false start --could not get ""into it""--; I watched it on a rainy day and was taken in.  Aside from the typical Hollywood attempt at tearjerking, I found myself entertained and fully absorbed into the storyline.  Stanley Tucci was hard to watch in the character he played, considering I only recently saw him perfectly cast in The Big Night as an Italian trying to make it big in the US.",1389657600,,394,4.458333333333333
4941424,4,B0063FQREO,"Liked the screenplay a lot (very original), but thought they could have done a little more with it. Acting was solid.",1389657600,,117,4.619047619047619
4941425,3,B0063FQREO,"I enjoyed it overall, but the cinematography wasn't really particularly good.  The characters seemed to lack much depth, the emotional hooks seemed forced, overdone and just...meh.  The backstory was a little too underdeveloped too, maybe I should read the books, I'm not much of a movie guy.",1389657600,,292,5.191489361702128

4941427,5,B0063FQREO,"Well done, great acting, very enjoyable overall. Jennifer Lawrence did an excellent job and was very believable in this role.",1389657600,,125,5.3
4941428,4,B0063FQREO,already saw the second film in the series which I loved. This filled me in on the story. I am eager to see the third film,1389657600,,121,3.6923076923076925
4941429,4,B0063FQREO,Good critique of a society where many have very little and the rich have a wasteful live style. Children are sacrificed in a unique way since they hunt each other. The movie was entertaining but not for those who are upset by needless killing.,1389657600,,243,4.545454545454546
4941430,5,B0063FQREO,Very entertaining. We watched this movie at a famIly movie night. Thoroughly enjoyed it with young teenage kids. Worth a rerun,1389657600,,126,5.0476190476190474
4941431,4,B0063FQREO,"I really liked the Hunger Games. My 13-year old son had seen it a while ago and he said it was really good, so I thought I'd check it out. And I agree with him -- it's a really good movie.",1389657600,,188,3.6097560975609757
4941432,4,B0063FQREO,"It was solid entertainment. I didn't read the books, but enjoyed watching the movie on a weekday evening and it left me wanting to see the sequel. It would have been nice if it had a little more background into why the games existed.",1389657600,,233,4.318181818181818

4941439,3,B0063FQREO,The plot was a bit far fetched. Why children vs adults? The acting was fair and the action pace was good. So overall it was just an average film.,1389657600,,145,4.0344827586206895
4941440,4,B0063FQREO,My kids wanted to watch the movie.  I have to admit it was entertaining.  Overall a good movie night with the family.,1389657600,,117,4.2727272727272725
4941441,4,B0063FQREO,"However, the second one I thought was better! Great book! Acting and action is strong. Jennifer Lawrence's acting is fantastic.",1389657600,,127,5.4
4941442,3,B0063FQREO,Seemed to be too much like the Running Man.  The love story was rather weak. Arnold did it much better.,1389657600,,103,4.15

4941447,4,B0063FQREO,Was hesitant to see it due to premise of movie but neighbors convinced me to watch it.  Well done.  Looking forward to seeing Catching Fire now.,1389657600,,144,4.5
4941448,4,B0063FQREO,Solid cast. Good mix of action and drama. Sets solid foundation for remaining films in series with character building and story. Makes you want to read book to further understand character details that were limited by two hour movie.,1389657600,,233,5.0

4941465,4,B0063FQREO,"Obviously, any film adaptation of a novel is going to have some issues, and the Hunger Games is no exception. There were certain parts that were changed or left out that were important to the plot of the book. At the same time, there were some added scenes that worked really well.

4941470,3,B0063FQREO,"Somehow I guess I expected more.  Instead it was like a more modern version of ""The Running Man"", only instead of Schwarzenegger it was Jennifer Lawrence.  Decent movie, but I wouldn't bother to see it again.",1389484800,,208,4.75
4941471,5,B0063FQREO,"As a prime member I streamed this movie for free.  Excellent streaming responses,  great sound  and the movie was also good.  Honestly surprised to fine this movie as one of those that are free for prime members.",1389484800,,212,4.648648648648648
4941472,4,B0063FQREO,"The director left out many details. One being how she actually got the Mocking Bird Pin, how she received it from a small girl, who later turned out to be the daughter of the emperor, and there was a link between them and such.",1389484800,,227,4.181818181818182
4941473,5,B0063FQREO,"Often times movies from books do not translate well.  The Hunger Games is as close as a movie gets to the book.  This even gets into how the Hunger Games gets started.  However, I will warn you that the camera work is very busy and if you have motion issues while viewing films on larger TVs or movie screens this could be an issue (it was for a family member of ours).

SPOILER INFO:

Now, I wish they would have told more about the relationship between Kat and Gale in the movie.  Gale plays a very significant part in Kat's life before and after the games and in her future relationship with Peeta.  Although I've seen Catching Fire too, by not including Gale in some detail in this movie it can be confusing to someone that has not read the books of how important Gale's existence is to the entire series.

On the plus side the special effects are believable in this movie and accurately portray the descriptions in the book too.  I try to separate book from movie understanding some things cannot translate well to the screen, but in the Hunger games the film makers and actors really do a great job at bringing this to life.  The arena scenes are captivating and to me even enhanced the book.  For example, there is a scene in the movie where the gamemaker tells one of the staff to put in a tree and you get to physically see it being accomplished in order to bar Kat from reaching the edge of the arena.  There are similar effects throughout the film that do enhance the book.

I did not find the acting cheesy or forced either.  The selection of who plays what roles was really well done.  While Jennifer Lawrence does a great job, to me it is Woody Harrelson, as Haymitch, that really captures his character the best.  There is not one person in the movie I think, ""I bet so-and-so would have been a better fit"".  The acting was spot on by everyone, I could not think of anyone that I would change the person selected with my ""fantasy"" replacement.  Well done!

Other than explaining Gale's role in the story more, I cannot think of any other tidbit I would want included that was not in the film.  The rest that was let out was fine.  If there was only one thing that is so minor that may help anyone that will see Catching Fire, but does not affect the Hunger Games film, it would be to demonstrate the gluttony of the people in the Capital.

Now I wish I could praise Catching Fire as much as I am able to praise the Hunger Games, but I will save that review for when that movie is released.",1389484800,,2504,4.305555555555555

4941477,5,B0063FQREO,Read the book - loved it.  Had to see the film.  They did a good job following the book.  Sometimes film makers change the story but this time they followed it completely.,1389484800,,171,4.28125
4941478,5,B0063FQREO,The Hunger Games is a brilliant movie where you can find an excellent screenplay along with a pretty decent landscape and technology effects. The movie present a dual combination of poor community with an advance technology structure.

4941484,5,B0063FQREO,We were not impressed with this move.  It didn't make any sense to my husband or myself. We will not be purchasing the second movie and waste our money.,1389398400,,152,4.241379310344827

4941491,5,B0063FQREO,The movie held our attention from beginning to end.  Not necessarily happy with the concept but found it entertaining all the same.  Will definitely watch the sequel.,1389398400,,166,5.111111111111111
4941492,4,B0063FQREO,"This movie is a little far fetched, of course, and the characters are not well developed. But it was a pretty entertaining movie especially if you like dystopian fantasies.",1389398400,,172,4.9655172413793105
4941493,4,B0063FQREO,"With all the hype surrounding this movie, I suspected a dud and was not interested in seeing it at all.  But, it was movie night and my Amazon Prime Membership price was right (free, I think), so my girlfriend (now fianc') and I took the plunge. A surprisingly good movie. Well done. Good acting. Lawrence is not only stunningly beautiful in this film, but plays her role quite well. Most importantly, for a guy who was originally disinterested in seeing the flick, the story is a solid one... whether you accept it as pure fictional escapism, or as a foreshadowing (like ""1984"") of where society could actually be heading.",1389398400,,623,4.715596330275229

For younger viewers, this really ""hid"" the actual acts of violence well.  The death and fighting were still apparent, and essential to the story line, but the filming of the actual violence was done to minimize this...

If you've got Tweens who read the book, I think it was more violent to read, then the movie is to watch, so I wouldn't think it a concern.",1389398400,,459,4.493975903614458
4941496,5,B0063FQREO,I watched this on my iPad over a couple of nights. Had to put it down because it was suspenseful and didn't think I could sleep. Anxious to see next movie!,1389398400,,155,4.032258064516129
4941497,4,B0063FQREO,It was enjoyable given the fact that it was premised on the death of children. Well done. Good acting and casting,1389398400,,113,4.428571428571429

It's easy to see why these books are so popular. There are many corollaries between this story and our society. The 1% are well-represented here, making me loathe them. The underdog (the rest of us) was also well-represented here, making me cheer for them. The characters were well developed.

4941552,4,B0063FQREO,"Excellent. The story line is great, although somewhat unrealistic and unhuman. I sincerely doubt our society will ever become that callous.",1389225600,,139,5.666666666666667
4941553,4,B0063FQREO,"A very good interpretation of the book.  Katniss' relationship with her father and mother is not as well developed, nor the love triangle she is entering, but overall, a very exciting movie.",1389225600,,190,4.9375
4941554,4,B0063FQREO,Very close to the book.  I enjoyed the movie. I am looking forward to the next one. Worth buying or renting.,1389225600,,108,4.142857142857143
4941555,5,B0063FQREO,I hadn't read the book but heard about the movie. We really enjoyed the movie. We watched as a family.,1389225600,,102,4.15

4941561,5,B0063FQREO,"I never read the books and could not understand the hoopla about a movie showcasing a games how where contestants kill to win.  I was wrong, it was great.  Never a dull moment, great effects, good actors.  Now will be waiting for the next one to come out on video.",1389225600,,264,4.24

4941568,4,B0063FQREO,"Really good picture. Towards the end the ploy felt somewhat rushed, opposed to the book where the entire plot had ample time to develop. Great acting performance overallwith some great interpretations from the book. All in all worth the etch and enjoyable",1389139200,,255,5.095238095238095
4941569,5,B0063FQREO,"Much better than I had expected. Wasn't necessary to better enjoying the second in the series, but allowed us to appreciate the premise and the artistry of the two connected, but different movies.
Get it, I think this trilogy (or will it turn into a bloated ""Rocky"" series or worse yet... Jaws), will eventually be a cult classic.",1389139200,,330,4.706896551724138
4941570,4,B0063FQREO,"I enjoyed the storyline and the acting. I seem to remember another movie that was made with somewhat the same story many years back. Of course, I can't recall the name.

The second part is not to good as the first one.",1389139200,,132,4.28

4941574,3,B0063FQREO,I don't like this movie. It is out of the world. It Somewhat likes a Japanese movie several years ago!,1389139200,,102,4.15
4941575,4,B0063FQREO,"The only reason I wouldn't give this movie 5 stars is because I don't like the fact of children killing children, but it is a great movie. Well acted and great costumes & effects. Excited to see the second one.",1389139200,,210,4.275
4941576,4,B0063FQREO,"It's been a while since I read the book, but the movie seemed to stay fairly true to the book.
I was pleased that somehow the violence of all those children dying is not etched in my mind afterwards;
it was handled very briefly and with very little gore.
I will look forward to viewing the next movie in the series.",1389139200,,315,4.180327868852459

4941578,4,B0063FQREO,"We finally got around to watching this movie, believing that it may be more for a younger crowd. We found it to be very entertaining and enjoyable. It shows what can happen in the U S if the citizens sit back and let the government do everything for them. We can eventually lose our freedom.",1389139200,,291,4.3090909090909095
4941579,2,B0063FQREO,"I like most book to movie adaptations, this one not so much. The book has a lot of internal dialog that just doesn't come through in the movie.
In this movie it's basically just, run around, fight, run around, fight and repeat.",1389139200,,227,4.428571428571429

4941581,1,B0063FQREO,Very grainy  watched via the WII so that could have been the problem  but will try one more time on another movie,1389139200,,113,4.090909090909091
4941582,2,B0063FQREO,"If you have read 1984, Lord of the Flies, ever heard of what Germany did to those unfortunate people back in the late 1930's-45, and/or seen Escape from New York, then you can probably guess what happens in this movie. It seems to be these things just all rehashed and mixed together.
I gave it 2 stars because it does seem to draw you in enough to make you like the characters and the 2 hours goes by without you even noticing.",1389139200,,428,4.2317073170731705

4941584,4,B0063FQREO,I thought it was a good movie and solid opening to a series. I don't think the movie lived up to the hype though.,1389139200,,113,3.75
4941585,1,B0063FQREO,"This was a horrible movie. The production was poor, the acting amateurish at best, and the story was better when it was called Running Man.",1389139200,,139,4.6
4941586,4,B0063FQREO,Gripping and disturbing at the same time.  We would recommend for an audience that can deal with several violent scenes.,1389139200,,120,5.0
4941587,4,B0063FQREO,"I didn't jump on the proverbial bandwagon when the Hunger Games movie first came out. That being said, it always sounded appealing yet I was apprehensive about it living up to the attention. It most certainly did, and I thoroughly enjoyed every aspect of the story. Jennifer Lawrence is absolutely amazing. Great movie!",1389139200,,319,5.037735849056604

4941590,4,B0063FQREO,"Not really my type of movie, but it was very entertaining. For me it was kind of difficult to follow at times. Great action, ok dialogue, good script/plot. Overall I'd give it an A-/B+.",1389139200,,185,4.470588235294118

4941593,4,B0063FQREO,"you need to rewatch Hunger Games first just to refresh your appetite for Jennifer Lawrence.
Hunger Games was not quite what I had anticipated, but it is certainly not a forgettable story. A very engaging, alternate perspective on class warfare.",1389139200,,244,5.125
4941594,4,B0063FQREO,A good rendition of the book--Jennifer Lawrence did a masterful job playing Katniss--I hear sequel is just as good as this one--,1389139200,,128,4.863636363636363
4941595,5,B0063FQREO,"I avoided this movie when it first came out because I thought it was a ""kids"" movie. Jenifer Lawrence hits it out of the park again!  Well acted movie!  Can't wait to see the next one!",1389139200,,184,4.083333333333333

4941609,3,B0063FQREO,The whole premise and writing of the movie was poor. It is a below average movie in all phases. Jennifer Lawrence is good given the limited material she has to work with.,1389139200,,170,4.34375
4941610,5,B0063FQREO,"I didn't know what to expect, certainly wasn't prepared for the romantic element.  Lots of action and a government-media mix as absurd as our own.  Fantasy, interesting characters, science fiction, action, romance, and despicable elements of government and media...what's not to like?  And it sets itself up for a sequel.  Perhaps a TV series some day?  The possibilities would only be limited by the quality of the writers creating the shows.  The savage brutality reflects the undercurrent pervading modern ""civilized"" life.",1389139200,,526,5.432098765432099

show.",1389052800,,216,4.375
4941613,5,B0063FQREO,Woody Harrelson did a super job!  Actor as Kat was also excellent! Action filled adventure with typical excessive government control taking place in the future.,1389052800,,160,5.4
4941614,3,B0063FQREO,video was in excellent condition when it arrived. Was still sealed and in new shape. Kids love it on christmas day to watch.,1389052800,,124,4.434782608695652
4941615,4,B0063FQREO,I think I liked this movie even more after having seen The silver lining play book.  I'll watch the next in the series too.,1389052800,,123,4.125
4941616,2,B0063FQREO,Jennifer Lawrence is a horrible actress! I don't get moviegoer's fascination with her. The action scenes in the second half of Hunger Games made the viewing tolerable but I was unimpressed with the overall screen adaptation from the original novel by Suzanne Collins.,1389052800,,267,5.232558139534884
4941617,5,B0063FQREO,"If you expect the book, word by word, you will be disappointed. If you want to experience the book and share Katniss' game - you will love it! Well done, completely memorable!",1389052800,,175,4.5

4941619,3,B0063FQREO,"The film is very good.  Not as good as the second movie, Catching Fire (different directors).  Jennifer Lawrence is amazing of course, but Donald Sutherland and Woody Harrelson seem a little 'vague' in their performances.  They are both much more solid in the second film.

A couple of things to bring to attention: this film does detour from the novel a bit more than Catching Fire, though it stays it's course for the most part.  Second: the transfer is horrible.  The picture quality is decent enough, but there are at least a dozen points where the film blacks out for a split second up to two seconds.  This is not my player (running a newer PS3 and I have not had any issues with other films).  I think the holiday special was for a cheaper pressing.  They case is terrible, lightweight, thin recycled plastic (got no problem with recycled, but give me a better case).  No booklets of course, not many extras.  Budget price means budget pressing I guess.  Third: the cameramen needed to stay off the caffeine or get the wobble smoothing cameras.  I understand this was an intentional choice, but it makes me nauseous watching the camera float and bump around A LOT.  Probably a directorial choice, and probably one more reason he was replaced for the second film.

If not for the glitches I would have given this 4 stars.  Detracting a star for the uneven acting, average direction, and the terrible camera work.  Just want to say beware the inexpensive one disc Blu-Ray version!",1389052800,,1485,4.6937984496124034
4941620,5,B0063FQREO,"Haven't read the books, but the movie is quite interesting. One can draw similarities of the eerie future depicted in the movie to present time and our obsession with celeberty. The cinematography was amazing, and the plot holds one's interest throughout the movie.",1389052800,,265,5.186046511627907

4941622,3,B0063FQREO,"I assume this was written for teens or young adults who will probably love it. For me (an old fart), it was just OK.

4941625,5,B0063FQREO,"The movie is based on an excellent series of book and the movie to true to the book for the most part.  The story does involve children being forced to play in the Hunger Games, where they will most likely die.  However, there is little blood and gore and is safe I would personally for anyone 13 and over but that is my personal opinion only.  The actors are great in the roles and Donald Sutherland is fantastic as President Snow.  Jennifer Lawrence is a knockout and gives a knockout performance in this movie. The movie arrived on time, in great condition and the seller was a rock star too!  Would recommend Video and Seller!  Please post so that seller can get the recognition of this very favorable review.  thank you,",1389052800,,725,4.488549618320611

4941642,4,B0063FQREO,"We were surprised that we liked this movie as much as we did. We watched it for cultural literacy only, as the subject matter was unappealing, The movie was well done and kept our attention.  Acting was good.",1389052800,,208,4.473684210526316
4941643,5,B0063FQREO,Follows the book pretty closely.  I recommend reading the books before watching the movie so you get the full story line.,1389052800,,121,4.761904761904762

4941645,3,B0063FQREO,"This is another one of those movies that draws on peoples fear of the future based on the past.  It's based on a world has changed into a cast society with the rich entertaining the poor through a Romanesque type of gladiator game.  The theme is hope?  Hope that one will survive.  Oh well, it is what it is.  Enjoy.",1389052800,,316,4.2
4941646,2,B0063FQREO,"There was no story.  This was just drama centered around a plot that could fit into a single tweet.

Jennifer Lawrence acted well, though... reprising her role from ""Winter's Bone"".",1389052800,,181,5.0

Not going to order another.  Amazon should check their stock of this movie.  Don't think the issue is my player - everything else I own plays just fine.  On the plus side, no problems getting credit for the two copies of the movie - just the headache of having to pack it and take it to the UPS drop-off twice.",1389052800,2,488,4.285714285714286

4941652,5,B0063FQREO,"Credible. Plausible, but no real evidence for such a season, YET! Could this happen? My answer is YES! Throughout the film I was reminded of a book from long before in my past that has a similar impact- Lord of the Flies. This film is captivating in a way most others from Hollywood are not, and will leave you thinking about it for weeks after, and wanting for more..",1389052800,3,368,4.3478260869565215

4941654,5,B0063FQREO,"I am a little old for these types of movies, but I think that the Hunger Games is the exception to that rule for me.  While the story line is a little ""beyond me"", the production, the acting, the casting are just exceptional......a very enjoyable movie even if I had to have my grand kids explain the story line to me over and over!!",1389052800,,333,4.203125
4941655,5,B0063FQREO,Moving and close enough to the book. Character development could be better with Gale and even Peeta. Overall really great.,1389052800,,122,5.15
4941656,3,B0063FQREO,"plot was well conceived but the story line was average. As the movie progressed, it creates suspense but at the end it was not a very conclusive ending. The ending was very superficial. It could be an one time watch movie.",1389052800,,222,4.439024390243903
4941657,2,B0063FQREO,The story of this movie seems to be educational for young people but its content is too much violent and not appropriate for them.,1389052800,,130,4.458333333333333
4941658,2,B0063FQREO,"I have to guess that I missed something.

Despite all the hype over this, I was just underwhelmed.

A very small story told even smaller.",1388966400,,137,4.44
4941659,5,B0063FQREO,"Its like a coming of age movie. It certainly draws the emotions out of you. It was funny, yet made you sad or mad at times. I loved it.",1388966400,,135,3.689655172413793

4941664,5,B0063FQREO,I read the book and the movie was true to the story.  It was excellent.  The actors were truly inspiring.,1388966400,,105,4.2
4941665,5,B0063FQREO,"Loved this.  I usually can predict how a movie will end, but this one completely surprised me.  This is a movie you don't want to miss!",1388966400,,135,4.153846153846154
4941666,4,B0063FQREO,Very good movie. Plot moved along somewhat slow. Like the mix of action with heavy story line. Little twist at the end but still nothing original.,1388966400,,146,4.653846153846154
4941667,4,B0063FQREO,"I liked the movie but it continued to download about every 5 or 6 minutes and was very chopped up.  My friend who is more knowledgeable than I said it might be because so many were watching at the same time.
But the movie was great.",1388966400,,232,4.043478260869565
4941668,4,B0063FQREO,"Good movie, well worth a watch. I think the second movie was actually better. I just need to understand why a society would put up with that sort of thing for even one year, let alone 75.",1388966400,,187,4.081081081081081
4941669,5,B0063FQREO,Plenty of action in this movie.  Thought provoking and challenging.  Would not recommend this to viewers of a young age and/or mind set due to the violence and gore.,1388966400,,165,4.655172413793103

4941672,2,B0063FQREO,"It was just another spin on the Lottery. The black dot, what ever. It was so predictable and saved me time and money. I won't have to waist my time or money on the sequels. Thank you.",1388966400,,183,3.972972972972973

4941674,4,B0063FQREO,"Pretty entertaining, but no real surprises.  Good scenery but the outcome was pretty predictable.  Enjoyed it, overall, but not the best movie.",1388966400,,143,5.454545454545454
4941675,4,B0063FQREO,Good story and fine acting by Jennifer Lawrence.  I recommend reading the book before seeing the movie.  The story line is much broader and interesting than what could be covered in the movie.  It makes the movie more enjoyable.,1388966400,,228,4.794871794871795
4941676,4,B0063FQREO,"A gripping story, but what kind of despotic government gets its entertainment by exploiting its citizens this way? Its obviously a very wealthy country and yet many of its citizens live in squalid poverty. That makes me angry, but its impossible not to root for a girl who displays such boldness and courage with reckless abandon while maintaining her own independent personality.",1388966400,,380,5.145161290322581
4941677,3,B0063FQREO,"The premise is amazing and production design matches but the story line is a little thin. I think the shock of seeing children kill one another and the impact of the big screen images caused most to overlook this. Intriguing, interesting but for an adult not enough substance to become emotionally invested.",1388966400,,307,4.923076923076923
4941678,4,B0063FQREO,"Jennifer Lawrence was great. I saw the 2nd movie first, so I had to see the 1st; both were stupendous!",1388966400,,102,4.15
4941679,3,B0063FQREO,This movie never really went anywhere.  It had a poor script and poor acting.  I won't recommend it to anyone very highly.,1388966400,,122,4.5
4941680,5,B0063FQREO,Outstanding movie with a nice balance of an action film with a love story woven in.  Want to see the sequel!,1388966400,,108,4.142857142857143

4941682,3,B0063FQREO,"Makes me want to ask the question: ""Is this the best we can dream up regarding the future?"" Ms. Lawrence does an adequate job in her role as a young female survivor, but the whole story line is too ""unbelievable"" for me. Must be my advanced age coming through.",1388966400,,260,4.326530612244898

4941688,4,B0063FQREO,"I avoided watching this movie because I don't do well with horror, fantasy, blood, guts and gore but decided that I enjoy the work of Jennifer Lawrence enough to give it a try. Now I can't wait to see the sequel.",1388966400,,212,4.195121951219512

4941690,2,B0063FQREO,I am likely not the target audience for this Running Man with angst ridden teenagers movie...better acted than Twilight though.,1388966400,,127,5.4
4941691,4,B0063FQREO,"I had read the book and felt this was a fairly good adaptation of the book.  Obviously the movie could not go into as much detail especially as regards her conflicted emotions re:  Peetr and Gale, so if you had not read the book that part would not be as clear.  Also the salute to District 11 would not be clear to someone who had not read the book.  And the creation of the dogs was just chalked up to computer wizardry rather than showing them being the embodiments of the dead Tributes.  If you had not read the book, it may have been a better movie as you would not miss what you didn't know about. Overall, better than average but not great.",1388880000,,647,4.185483870967742

4941698,3,B0063FQREO,"Well, the film made me more of a Jennifer Lawrence fan but I was able to tell that so much was missing from the film that must have been in the book.  I enjoyed the beginning very much but as a whole it seemed a little contrived - meaning the ending was pre-set and it was obvious that the middle was written to get us to the desired ending.  But it was entertaining.",1388880000,,367,4.013698630136986

Katniss's journey in the Games is very devasting and life changing, as well as she goes on sharing her bond with her other partnered tribute Peeta. This family movie is a tradition for all to enjoy on the edge of your seat! The triolgy is wonderful! Collins makes her treasured books to the big screen. Once you've finished one book, waits for you to desprately read the next novel. Seeing how I read them all, I am a true fan.

4941729,2,B0063FQREO,Loved the Movie and how I was able to watch it on my laptop.....but the video kept pausing every 3-4 minutes for streaming!!!! So frustrating!!!!,1388880000,,145,4.84
4941730,5,B0063FQREO,"This is such a great movie. I must have watched this now at least six times, and it never gets old. I am dying to see the brand new sequel to this movie, and I hope it will be just as good as the first and original movie, The Hunger Games. But you know how it is, the original is always the best - unless the sequels are really great, the never stand up to the original movie!! This movie is phenomenal!! You have to watch this movie!! And I will watch it again and again!! I would definitely put it in with one of my all time favorites, and I don't have too many of these, and I watch LOTS of movies!!",1388880000,,602,3.902439024390244
4941731,5,B0063FQREO,"Just because it's awesome
!!  It makes you think as well. What would you do in a situation like hers? Would you volunteer or would you turn your head in shame? How strong are you really?",1388880000,,186,4.166666666666667
4941732,4,B0063FQREO,i got to say it was a good movie. it was slow in some parts but overall a good movie,1388793600,,84,3.25

4941735,4,B0063FQREO,"It was one of those types of movies where you are connected with a character and want to see that character succeed. It was not one of those movies with a believable storyline, but then again it was not meant to be. Might watch another Hunger Games follow-on if it became available",1388793600,,281,4.423076923076923
4941736,5,B0063FQREO,"I really enjoyed this movie. I did read the books and they added value to the movie. The novels are very detailed and the movie had to cut some the details out for time purposes. The scenery was great, the back story thorough, awesome movie.",1388793600,,241,4.377777777777778
4941737,4,B0063FQREO,Great show overall but could have used a better ending. It's just not lets you know what was coming that's the very end of the show,1388793600,,131,4.076923076923077
4941738,5,B0063FQREO,I have read the books and I have also loved the movie I cant wait to see the second movie. The first one was done really well. I didn't notice many differences between the two.,1388793600,,176,4.057142857142857
4941739,3,B0063FQREO,Thought provoking and entertaining but not very realistic.  Could a democratic society come to this someday?  It is difficult to watch young people being wasted in this manner.,1388793600,,176,5.25
4941740,4,B0063FQREO,I was very entertained by this movie as it was so close to the book.  Some characters were cheated of screen time but all it all a very good time watching.,1388793600,,155,4.0
4941741,5,B0063FQREO,I liked it a lot.  I thought it followed the book well.  I had wanted to see it a long time ago.  I am looking forward to watching Catching Fire.,1388793600,,145,3.7666666666666666
4941742,5,B0063FQREO,I read the books before watching it. I thought the movie was well done and enjoyed it. Going for the second one,1388793600,,111,4.090909090909091
4941743,4,B0063FQREO,"Well done with very good special effects.
Haven't read the book yet, but suspect it is very close to the written material.
Will review later after reading the book.
Hope the new sequel is as good.",1388793600,,196,4.472222222222222
4941744,3,B0063FQREO,"i found i have seen it. i did not go on watching it. In my view, it was so so. that is why i gave 3 stars.",1388793600,,106,2.962962962962963
4941745,5,B0063FQREO,Great! Very similar to the book. Worth seeing and the sequel is a great movie as well. Be sure to see!,1388793600,,102,3.9047619047619047
4941746,4,B0063FQREO,Great movie of survival and pulling together. Emotional and thrilling but shows leadership and teamwork. It shows all skills are useful no matter if it's strengths of survival.,1388793600,,176,5.321428571428571
4941747,4,B0063FQREO,"I enjoyed the whole movies, start to finish.  The follow thru, the way the games were handled.  I really enjoyed this movies, and looking fore ward to the next one.",1388793600,,164,4.433333333333334
4941748,4,B0063FQREO,"I kept putting off seeing this movie because I knew that it was from a Young Adult book and thought it would hold little interest for somewhat older adult. But I was wrong! I enjoyed it a lot. Intriguing premise - lots of action - good acting.  I knew that the 2nd edition was already in the theaters so I wanted to finally catch up before I went to that one. There had been a lot of hype and differing reviews from the critics but I decided to find out for myself and with the opportunity to see it via Amazon Prime, I jumped in. Never having read the books, I was at a bit of a disadvantage but it didn't keep me from enjoying the film and I'm now planning to see both #2 and #3 in the series. I probably would have given it 5 stars if I had read the book - there were a few places where it dragged a little for me and I was wishing for a little more explanation of the games up front. I would definitely recommend this to any age.",1388793600,,933,3.9365079365079363
4941749,4,B0063FQREO,"I didn't like the disturbing concept of the Hunger game, where kids are killing kids in order to survive, but I thought it was intriguing and was sucked in to watch until the end.",1388793600,,179,4.294117647058823
4941750,3,B0063FQREO,"Entertaining movie worth watching, not the best but worth the time, have not read the book yet, have heard that the second movie ""Catching Fire"" is better.",1388793600,,155,4.777777777777778
4941751,5,B0063FQREO,Thoroughly enjoyed this movie.  Was my second time watching...made my husband and sister watch with e.  Can't wait to go see Catching Fire.,1388793600,,139,5.0
4941752,5,B0063FQREO,I was watching on Netflix and it kept pausing and buffering. Then I switched it to Amazon prime and the quality was perfect. Amazon rocks!,1388793600,,138,4.56
4941753,4,B0063FQREO,Jennifer was good and good to look at. Story line very strange.  Not a fan of the plot but was entertaining,1388793600,,107,4.095238095238095
4941754,5,B0063FQREO,Original standard by which all future Hunger Games will be measured.  A must see movie featuring three to four future stars,1388793600,,123,4.857142857142857
4941755,4,B0063FQREO,"It was very exciting and fast movie.  It was not bloody as most movies, and good for family with school-age children.
I personally liked the book better.
Amazon prime movie sucked.  It kept stopping every 5 minutes.  It never happened for Netflix. I cancelled the Prime.",1388793600,,270,4.826086956521739
4941756,5,B0063FQREO,"My son and I read all the books as they came out,  Now we're enjoying the movies which are well-acted and faithful to the books.",1388793600,,128,4.12
4941757,5,B0063FQREO,"We really enjoyed watching this movie right before we went to see the 2nd movie out in theaters. Yes, the story is harsh, but it is well written and the actors did a great job.",1388793600,,176,4.057142857142857
4941758,4,B0063FQREO,"I watched this movie only because it was free with my prime subscription, and I was bored. And it was surprisingly good !! Jennifer Lawrence has quite a depth of talent for a young actor, and she really helped move the movie forward. Combine that with an interesting plot, and a great supporting cast and you get a very good movie!",1388793600,,331,4.442622950819672
4941759,4,B0063FQREO,"As a fan of the books, I was a little disappointed in the movie visually, but the cast was excellent and the action exciting. Jennifer Lawrence is perfect, vulnerable with a steel core.",1388793600,,185,4.636363636363637
4941760,5,B0063FQREO,A very good rendering of the book.  The movie does not spoil the book and having read the book I still enjoyed seeing the movie.,1388793600,,128,4.12
4941761,5,B0063FQREO,"I was really impressed with this movie. It was written well, my dad said the book was a lot better, but isn't that always the case. The movie is visually engaging with a great plot. It is a futuristic movie that feels like it is set in the past. For me it highlights the way we can lose ourselves with government control. Where the lines of right and wrong get so blurred we can no longer distinguish between the two. Wonder what I'm talking about? Watch the movie... :-) God Bless.",1388793600,,482,4.3076923076923075
4941762,1,B0063FQREO,"Boring, I hope the sequel is better. The whole premise for this movie makes no sense. How does sacrificing people equate to remembrance of a past war.",1388793600,,150,4.592592592592593
4941763,1,B0063FQREO,"This is a horrible movie, mostly because of its absurd subject matter and disquieting message.
I hated that my kids had to watch it and I think this is certainly a milestone in the vulgarization of America's culture and society.",1388793600,3,228,4.725
4941764,5,B0063FQREO,This movie is the perfect blend of dialogue and action.  I love Jennifer Lawrence. She is terrific in this movie!,1388793600,,113,4.65
4941765,5,B0063FQREO,"Wanted to see if it lived up to the ratings, and it absolutely does! Wonderful movie! Don't miss this one!",1388793600,,106,4.35
4941766,3,B0063FQREO,She makes the movie worthwhile even though I'm not crazy about futuristic fantasy movies....but she is good!  I would watch it again.,1388793600,,133,5.045454545454546
4941767,3,B0063FQREO,Good movie that held my interest. Not what I expected. I heard all the kids and women liked it as a book but nothing from men. Enjoyable.,1388793600,,137,4.111111111111111
4941768,5,B0063FQREO,"After reading the book, I was anxious to see this movie.  It definitely did not disappoint and has my main requirement for a great film; I would see it again.",1388793600,,158,4.266666666666667
4941769,4,B0063FQREO,"I WILL GET STRAIGHT TO THE POINT, SHORT & TO THE POINT GOOD JOB BY LAWERENCE, WOODY ECT ENTERTAINING MOVIE",1388793600,,106,4.35
4941770,4,B0063FQREO,"Good movie, generally not the genre that I watch. Will read the books. Planning on seeing sequel when it is released on video",1388793600,,125,4.478260869565218

4941772,5,B0063FQREO,"This is a good movie to watch especially for free with Amazon Prime.
It was interesting throughout and kept you glued to the TV.
I understood the relationship developed with the partner but hated that it happened.",1388793600,,213,4.783783783783784
4941773,5,B0063FQREO,Excellent storyline. Surprisingly suspenseful! Cannot wait to watch the rest of the movies. J-Law is amazing as Katniss! 5 stars!,1388793600,,129,5.5
4941774,5,B0063FQREO,I really enjoyed the book series... with this first book in the series being my favorite.  The movie captured the book very well.  Is this a glimpse of our future?  Certainly there is a lot of food for thought in both the books and the movie.  The contrast between the capital and District 12 certainly presented a vivid contrast and should be food for thought.  Are we heading in that direction?,1388793600,,396,4.52112676056338
4941775,5,B0063FQREO,"I didn't read the book, so I didn't have any expectations. I thought the story line was great and the cast was well chosen. Love, love, love Jennifer Lawrence!",1388793600,,159,4.517241379310345
4941776,5,B0063FQREO,"The trilogy is a story like no other and I very much enjoyed the books.  I saw this movie before I read the books but after seeing this movie, I had to read the books.  I just knew the books would be good since this movie was so awesome.  Pleasantly surprised with this movie...it was just that good.  The acting from the young people was fantastic, and the seasoned actors were an added bonus when watching this wonderful start to a very emotional trilogy.",1388707200,,457,4.404761904761905
4941777,5,B0063FQREO,"First time I rented it I watched it 3 times in a day! LOVED this flick. Funny, exciting, beautifully filmed. It has it all. Enjoy.",1388707200,,130,4.24

4941779,1,B0063FQREO,Watched only a few minutes. Did not enjoy even a few minutes of it. My wife and I do not recommend it.,1388707200,,102,3.6818181818181817
4941780,4,B0063FQREO,I bought this one so I could revisit it before the 2nd movie came out this year.  I shared it with my friend who never saw it.  It was good and I'm glad I added it to my DVD collection.,1388707200,,185,3.6
4941781,5,B0063FQREO,I didn't know what to expect and was pleasantly surprised.  The story was well written and the actors were believable. It kept my interest all the way through.  I definitely would recommend it.,1388707200,,193,4.818181818181818
4941782,5,B0063FQREO,"The movie is really well done, and stays fairly true to the book. The acting is strong and there is good chemistry between the characters. The sets, animation and clothing design is outstanding. This is well worth the watch.",1388707200,,224,4.769230769230769
4941783,5,B0063FQREO,Sorry I waited so long to watch  it.  Jennifer Lawrence is a fantastic actress.  Will not wait for the next one....,1388707200,,115,4.380952380952381
4941784,5,B0063FQREO,Hunger gamessss was great this has to be the number one movie so far I will be purchasing the second movie.,1388707200,,107,4.142857142857143
4941785,5,B0063FQREO,"The movie was well thought out, though at times the scenes were a bit fake. The actors did a great job portraying the rich and the poor and the everyday dangers they face in this futurist movie.",1388707200,,194,4.27027027027027
4941786,4,B0063FQREO,"The movie made me very hungry for more Hunger Games movies.  Killing children is very disturbing, but this movie pulled it off in a very entertaining way!",1388707200,,154,4.703703703703703
4941787,5,B0063FQREO,"Great, even if you read the book you will enjoy this movie.  Recommend it. Jennifer Lawrence is excellent in this movie.",1388707200,,120,4.714285714285714
4941788,4,B0063FQREO,"It easy to say ""oh this isn't as good as the book"", its like that with almost any movie.  Sure there were some things missing that annoyed me or some other things I wish they changed.  But overall I think the movie was quite good and I expect the sequel movies to be even better once they take in all the feedback from this movie. (so far I heard the new movie Catching Fire was better)

Jennifer Lawerence was great and hope to see more of Woody Harrelson in the sequels.",1388707200,,472,4.164835164835165

4941790,4,B0063FQREO,Very good. Excellent acting and direction. Story moves along at a good pace and holds your attention the whole time. It even has one of those 'what happens next?' endings. There could be a sequel somewhere down the road ...,1388707200,,223,4.6
4941791,5,B0063FQREO,"I really liked this movie, as did my daughter.  Very well produced and all the actors/actresses fit into the roles well.  Goes well with the books.  Can't wait to see how the other ones compare.",1388707200,,194,4.485714285714286
4941792,5,B0063FQREO,"I wanted to see the original ""The Hunder Games"" before watching the sequel.  Jennifer Lawrence did an excellent job in the original.  I now can't wait to see the sequel.",1388707200,,169,4.6
4941793,5,B0063FQREO,"The plot is awful. Society where each district gives up two ""tributes"" to be slaughtered. And the upper class make a big production out of it! What is this analogous of in today's society. Is it a warning about things to come like ""1984"" and ""Animal Farm"" were?",1388707200,,261,4.458333333333333
4941794,5,B0063FQREO,"The first time I watched this movie, it was without having read the books and I thoroughly enjoyed it.  If you haven't read the books this is a great series, I would easily recommend starting with the movie and then going for more detail in the book, it doesn't disappoint!

Having now read the books, I can see how some people were a bit disappointed with what didn't show up in the movie vs the book, but that's fairly typical of movies (doby!), and this is still a great flick.

Background on the movie:  Many great movies set there stages to be like real world events, (or myths) and that's the same here.  Without going into detail from the author's interview, I believe that it's historical staging is part of what makes this series so hooking, believable, and fun.",1388707200,,771,4.517985611510792
4941795,4,B0063FQREO,I think the streaming feature for the Amazon Prime Customers is probably the reason I will keep the account in Prime status.  I do like it a lot!,1388707200,,145,4.178571428571429
4941796,3,B0063FQREO,Catching Fire was also awesome.  I am enjoying the series a great deal.  I can not wait for the last movie in the series to come out,1388707200,,132,3.8518518518518516
4941797,5,B0063FQREO,Enjoyed the live interpretation of the book. Characters well developed and story line was very touching. Loved the artistry and scenes used.,1388707200,,140,5.409090909090909

4941800,5,B0063FQREO,"The acting was very believable throughout the movie and the effects outstanding.  What I found disturbing is the premise.  I know human nature being what it is, we have a tendency toward the macabre for entertainment (in real life).  I trust that we as civilized humans will never resort to something like The Hunger Games for real life entertainment.",1388707200,,351,4.915254237288136
4941801,4,B0063FQREO,"I have to say that I approached this movie with some hesitation fearing that it was going to be some ""Twilighty Fluff"", but immediately you realize that it is not, does not glorify violence, even tough it is quite graphically violent, very entertaining, lots of action, agree with it or not it has a strong message, i would respect the pg-13 rating",1388707200,,348,4.629032258064516

4941803,3,B0063FQREO,it seems cruel and far fetched.  I didn't care for the program.  It's just too bazaar.  main character good with bow and arrow.,1388707200,,127,4.434782608695652
4941804,4,B0063FQREO,"I must be one of the few people who has not seen the original Hunger Games.  I heard many people say how good it was, but is just didn't interest me.  Finally, with my Amazon Prime, I figured I might as well get my money's worth, so decided to view it.  I must say I was pleasantly surprised.  Although I am tiring of the bleak futuristic outlook portrayed endlessy in cinema, I really liked the gritty, up close and personal style Gary Ross used in this film.  Jennifer Lawrence inhabits her characters so effortlessy, its unnerving sometimes.  The only thing I got tired of, were the ridiculous dress habits of the Capitol residents.  Other than that, all the actors were great and the story moved along at a good pace.",1388707200,,721,4.5
4941805,3,B0063FQREO,"Being part of a series (which I've never read), the movie didn't offer a satisfying ending. It was clearly a transition to the sequel that follows. Character development of the two victors from District 12 a little weak. As long as you're not looking for anything deep or insightful about the human condition, it's a satisfying way to pass a couple hours.",1388707200,,355,4.741935483870968

4941872,4,B0063FQREO,"I enjoyed the movie very much but I gave it 4 stars instead of 5, because having read the trilogy (enjoyed it tremendously), a few things bugged me.  I loved the visuals, the acting, and the honest adaptation of Suzanne Collins's novel. What the movie does well, in addition to these things, is in the scenes outside the hunger games arena where the game makers are making decisions on what should be done next, and what the mentor Haymitch (Woody Harrelson) was doing while the fighting was going on in the arena. The book is written purely from Katniss's perspective. The film makers do a good job of filling in the gaps. However, it could have been even better.  I realize that a movie as a medium has its limitations. Still, some parts could have been developed better.

Katniss (Jennifer Lawrence) and Peeta (Josh Hutcherson) are strangers thrown together by destiny, although  Katniss has one very special memory of what happened 5 years earlier. That memory always stays with her. Although Peeta says he had a crush on Katniss since chlldhood, the relationship between them really develops in the cave when Peeta is seriously injured and Katniss nurses him back to health. The movie rushed through that part. They could have spent more time to show the seriousness of Peeta's injury, and Katniss's conflicting feelings as the days pass.

The Hunger games trilogy is dark and the first movie comes up short in showing the horror of the games. The most horrifying thing is children killing other children to survive, and their families having to watch it on TV, as a required viewing. The horror does not come through adequately. There is one scene where the movie succeeds in showing the horror - when Rue dies, it leads to riots in her home district, and they are suppressed by the Capitol. The movie needed more scenes like this, to show the reactions of the people in other districts.  Every death that took place was unnecessary and tragic; that needed to be shown.

Toward the end, the movie shows Katniss and Peeta a little too happy, when in reality both of them have regrets about killing (either directly or indirectly) other human beings, even though it was a choice between kill or get killed.  Peeta is seriously injured/almost dies toward the end of the 'games' in the book, but in the movie he does not even have a scratch after the last fight. The last part seems diluted and rushed.

One important part was left out at the very end. Peeta discovers that Katniss was simply following a strategy in acting the 'love' part with Peeta, (although her feelings are much more complex than this). Peeta is deeply hurt by the knowledge that she did not really love him, and she was just acting. Katniss says that not all of it was acting.  In the movie it is just a 30- second scene at the end where she says she wants to forget and he says he does not want to. It was a rushed scene, and rather ineffective.

Woody Harrelson is perfect as Haymitch, who drinks all the time, but is sober enough to mentor Katniss and Peeta while they are in the arena. Stanley Tucci as the interviewer and Elizabeth Banks as Effie are excellent. Jennifer Lawrence proves to us once again what a fabulous actress she is, and Josh Hutcherson seems perfect as the kind Peeta. Other characters are also played very well by the respective actors, who have less screen time.

In spite of the short comings this is a very good movie. This is not just a 'fight' movie. It has a deep meaning and a message about overcoming tyranny and not giving in to suppression.  It is consistent with the history of mankind, where tyranny & dictatorship have led to rebellion.",1388620800,,3650,4.631578947368421

4941896,3,B0063FQREO,"Somehow, almost the entire movie was predictable, very convenient plot to glorify the hero or in this case the heroine, though all competitors are from similar background, most are ready to kill one another making it easy for the lead characters to stay away from all the gore of killing kids competing alongside, seems like their moves were very predictable as similar movies ( like Eliminator, Death Race, the Condemed & the Japanese hit movie Battle royale ( the girl heroine, the love, the reaping concept as a punishment for uprising are all found in the same movie and even preceeds the novel by almost a decade ) so for a movie buff like me, this was just a mash up of these movies and hence it was mostly predictable and occasionally boring too.

4941929,4,B0063FQREO,"Jennifer Lawrence was captivating. Her performance was 5 star worthy. The movie held my attention, which is not often the case. All the characters were well-played.

4941937,5,B0063FQREO,"I should say that the first time I saw the film it did not strike home. I think one has to see a film like this more than once. First off, it is a film centered on  the primacy of ""person-hood"" - more so it embraces what it means to be fully human. The Justice element is strong in the film, as is the theme of hope against all odds. The film from a macroscopic perspective, explores the injustice of economic disparity and capitalism as primitive accumulation or disaster capitalism which can catapult people into a cult of hedonistic and invincible individualism that ultimately becomes pathological and distorted, to the extent that future populations bred on this fare, become mindless and amoral, self-indulgent hedonists who would find gratification in child murder. The aggressive and mindless self-indulgent egocentricity that is the ultimate fruit of capitalism with its cold jagged concrete structures built outside of the natural greenery, is contrasted with the softness of communal life where 'charity' is imbued with a strong sense of justice and is self-effacing and not self indulgent. It is the very element of personal immolation that becomes the cornerstone of the ultimate defiance of political authority, which for all of its power, is emasculated by those who are deemed ""weak"".",1388448000,,1300,5.074766355140187

4941944,4,B0063FQREO,"Jennifer Lawrence is great in everything. If she's on the screen I pretty much like it. Hokey but well done. Woody Harrellson and Lenny Kravitz were good, too. Obviously begging a sequel at the end. Finally gave in and watched on my MacBook Air since it never came on any pay channels and the sequel's already playing at the Chinese. Wasn't half bad in bed on the laptop! Not Oscar material but a good, exciting movie.",1388448000,,418,4.5131578947368425
4941945,3,B0063FQREO,"I understand that with any adaptations from books to movies, you lose a lot of the background & character work.  It's difficult to really interpret the author's written words on screen. I think there were a lot of wasted opportunities here to layer more of the background underneath the scenes.  Too much & it drags the pace down.  Too little & the characters become more shallow, less layered.  You want to care about the majority of these characters & I really was drawn in by them in the book.  The movie left me wanting. While the action of the movie is important, it's not the most important part of it.  I feel as if the whole premise of the books was lost in trying to ramp it up with action & with the action not even occurring where I really wanted it to be.

I wanted to like this movie more & had I not read the book first, I probably would have.  However, reading the book first provides so much back story that you can actually follow what's going on & understand the 'why's & 'how's that I think are, for the most part, lost in the movie.",1388361600,30,1052,4.251256281407035

4941954,2,B0063FQREO,"SPOILER ALERT.

How could an otherwise talented director take the most nail-biting, adrenaline-pumping, edge-of-your-seat story and turn it into one of the dullest, anti-climactic movies ever?  The following are just a few of the wasted opportunities that made this one of the worst adaptations ever.

Katnisss private session with the gamemakers.  Dull.  This was an excellent opportunity for some excitement.  In the book, she shoulder rolls forward, lands on one knee and shoots out a light that explodes in a firework of sparks before she shoots the apple out of the pigs mouth.  This could have been a rockin scene with rockin music. Instead, they removed all the action, and lingered far too long on Katnisss face as she stares at the gamemakers who are ignoring her.  Ironically, the following scene where they discuss what she did was actually more engaging and entertaining.

The mockingjay pin.  Wasted opportunity.  Here Prim, take this piece of tin I found at the flea market.  It has mystical powers that will keep you safe.  Yet, five minutes after Prim puts it on, she gets picked at the reaping!  Hows that for a bad omen? Is it too much to ask that the filmmakers put a little thought into the token that not only represents District 12 and Katniss, but the very movie itself?  How about giving its origin some significance and not ladle it with bad mojo?

The Reaping.  Dull and another wasted opp.  The Reaping scene is just dull, and its not clear that the peoples refusal to applaud is a huge form of rebellion.  If only they had shown us a couple of glimpses of other districts reapings, shown how the people are forced to applaud, perhaps at gunpoint, thus making the rebellious silence of District 12 more palpable.  If only they had shown Cato and Clove brazenly volunteering.  Maybe show a flicker of doubt cross Cloves face as their district applauds whole-heartedly or shown Cato searching for his mothers face in the crowd before the doors close.  Catos speech at the end would have been much more moving.  I would have FELT something!

Speaking of Catos death, it was so anti-climactic, I think Katniss actually yawned when she killed him.  I know I did.

The worst moment is at the end when they announce they are both winners.  This is what we have been leading up to!  Its over!  They won!  I want to FEEL something!  I want to feel relief, pride, excitement and conflicting feelings of hatred towards the Capitol.  I want to have a cathartic experience.  But instead I feel nothing, NOTHING.  There is no sweeping music, no cheering crowd from the Capitol, nothing.  Justok, ok, you both win.  Thencrickets.  Its over.  It is so disappointing!  So anti-climactic.

Gary Ross and others are not Hollywood novices.  They know how to make an audience feel something.  So how come I felt nothing?  Why, Gary Ross?  Why?  I know they didn't have the biggest Hollywood budget, but Ive seen homemade youtube videos that made me feel more than this one.  Huge letdown.",1388361600,2,2994,4.771037181996086

4941961,4,B0063FQREO,"When Hunger Games first came out I kind of lumped it with the Harry Potter series and other movies of that genre and postponed any real effort to see it.  With the release of the second movie in the series I thought, ""Maybe there IS something there.""  Especially with all of the media coverage of the leading lady so when it became available on Amazon Instant Video I did finally view the movie.  The action and scenery were excellent and the premise for the plot was good but I felt the original cause of the global catastrophe and the nation's break up into districts needed to be better explained.  Maybe that will happen in the second installment.  Looking forward to the ratings but will try to not spoil it by judging too early.",1388361600,,734,4.488721804511278

I know you can't stick to the book as the movie would have been 12 hours long but they did a terrible job with the characters in this film. There were some good moments in the film but how about Katniss boyfriend? Can anyone tell me his name?
He was a central part in the book and he probably didn't say 20 words throughout the first film. I probably won't watch the second as it will ruin the picture in my head from reading the book.",1388361600,,561,4.203703703703703

Good movie.",1388361600,,308,4.065573770491803
4941967,5,B0063FQREO,It's always great to watch a movie with no major changes from the book.  I don't think the storyline with the mayor and his daughter was important to the plot of the first movie although it left some scenes in the second movie a little empty for those who didn't read the books.  We will have to suspend disbelief that Katniss is a starving girl but I really admire Jennifer Lawrence for standing up to producers and not losing a ton of weight for the role for fear of negative influence on young female fans.  This is a great movie and interpretation of the books and the violence toned down enough to be appropriate for younger audiences.,1388361600,,640,4.452991452991453

4941970,5,B0063FQREO,"I very much enjoyed the movie.  As an archer and archery instructor, it pleases me that young adults are portrayed in the sport.  This encourages others (especially females) and sends the message that everyone can enjoy learning to shoot.

4941971,5,B0063FQREO,I didn't think I was going to like this movie because the idea of a bunch of teenagers killing each other didn't appeal to me. But I liked how the main female character protected her sister and sacrificed herself and then managed to survive !,1388361600,,242,4.4
4941972,5,B0063FQREO,Liked the book and this movie was almost exact following of the hunger games book.  Hard to get a good development of the characters in a two plus hour movie but this movie did that fairly well.  You won't be disappointed.,1388361600,,222,4.390243902439025

4941974,5,B0063FQREO,"We enjoyed every moment, kept our attention and we look forward to watching the sequel. I highly recommend this movie.",1388361600,,118,4.95
4941975,5,B0063FQREO,I loved this movie when it came out.  My son is 12 and he has read the books.  The story and plot are set up here and becomes much more expansive in the next film.  That being said you get the stylized gladiatorial battle and the pomp and circumstance surrounding that here.  Would probably only be an average movie but there is something about Jennifer Lawrence...she lives up to the hype in everything she stars in.  If for some reason you haven't seen this yet you are missing out.,1388361600,,484,4.393258426966292
4941976,5,B0063FQREO,Good movie and original story line. Good streaming quality. Some family who watched it didn't think they were going to like it but did.,1388361600,,135,4.666666666666667
4941977,5,B0063FQREO,"AHHH. I cannot wait to see what happens in the next movie!!
I absolutely loved the entire movie. So good.",1388361600,,105,4.3
4941978,5,B0063FQREO,Read all the books and this movie delivers!  Love the cast and the pacing is great. Very good if you like apocalyptic action movies.,1388361600,,132,4.5
4941979,4,B0063FQREO,did not think I would like it but it turned out to be a very well done movie and kept you interested to the end,1388361600,,111,3.48
4941980,5,B0063FQREO,"This is a great movie with lots of action and drama.  It sticks close to the book, so of you enjoyed the book, your sure to enjoy the movie.",1388361600,,140,3.8275862068965516
4941981,5,B0063FQREO,"This was my second time watching this movie.  The action and special effects will keep your attention throughout the show.  I was pleased on how closely they were actually able to follow the story in the book (read it before watching it).  The cast of Jennifer Lawrence, Woody Harrelson, Donald Sutherland, and many more great actors makes it well worth your time.  I'm sure I'll be watching this many more times in the future...It will be my new Star Wars.",1388361600,,457,4.675
4941982,5,B0063FQREO,Excellent movie... Didn't expect it to be as good so nice surprise....good action movie and decent acting..I recommend watching it,1388361600,,130,5.55
4941983,5,B0063FQREO,Top quality audio and video.  Good movie if you like that kind of movie.  No issues with quality though. Recommended,1388361600,,116,4.75
4941984,4,B0063FQREO,I enjoyed the movie.. it followe the book pretty well.. however.. not as violent as the book..  Good acting and I loved Jennifer Lawrence.,1388361600,,138,4.75
4941985,4,B0063FQREO,"This movie was very true to the book even though you can't be a hundred percent with an adaptation.  Beautifully filmed, many of the cast were what I pictured in my mind. Looking forward to the second one now.",1388361600,,209,4.358974358974359
4941986,5,B0063FQREO,Very good story and has a good pace to it.  Would recommend to families with older kids since a lot of violence does take place.,1388361600,,128,4.12
4941987,5,B0063FQREO,The movie was great! It was easy to use through my smart tv on amazon prime and it was free!,1388361600,,92,3.65

4941989,3,B0063FQREO,A little hard to get the plot if you didn't read the book.  Jennifer Lawrence is excellent.  I can't wait to see the second one.,1388361600,,128,4.08
4941990,5,B0063FQREO,Touching rendition of the book. Beautiful graphics. Violence is present but not overdone. Definity sets you up to see the others in the series,1388361600,,142,4.958333333333333
4941991,4,B0063FQREO,"It was a good movie, a nice way to spend a vacation afternoon.  Not what I expected., but still a good movie to watch I would recommend it.",1388361600,,139,3.9642857142857144
4941992,5,B0063FQREO,This is a great movie series and a great addition to anyone's collection. I am glad that I was able to add it to mine.,1388361600,,118,3.76
4941993,3,B0063FQREO,It was a good movie.  not quite what I expected but it made you think about how lives could change and be influenced by what basic needs you were fighting for.,1388275200,,159,4.129032258064516
4941994,5,B0063FQREO,"This movie will appeal to everyone, from teenagers to adults.  It's a thrilling sci-fi adventure set in another world and place but is relatable to our own reality with its politicial themes of class warfare.  Jennifer Lawrence is amazing.",1388275200,,239,5.102564102564102
4941995,5,B0063FQREO,"This movie's just perfect, probably there's a lot of things they just not included in the movie as Madge or the red-headed Avox, but come on! Let's go with a few facts:
1) It's a 2-hr movie all resumed from a book (which means they CANNOT be perfect with every single detail)
2) If you read the books, you don't need to be 'insulted' for the drama of the movie, instead as a significant summary of everything.",1388275200,,409,4.324675324675325
4941996,5,B0063FQREO,A great gift perfect for that teenager who wants everything. I scored on this one this year for christmas thank goodness,1388275200,,120,4.761904761904762
4941997,3,B0063FQREO,"I did watch it, it's ok,
for me it's nothing to write home about but still worth viewing. Try it",1388275200,,96,3.85
4941998,4,B0063FQREO,"Don't know why they named it this, should have been ""Survival Games"". But that aside, it was exciting & makes me want to see sequels. Can't believe my hairdresser lets her 6 & 8 year old girls watch this for a ""good female role model"" though. Seems a bit rough for white bread little suburban kids.",1388275200,,298,4.339285714285714
4941999,5,B0063FQREO,My daughter saw it in the theater and loved it. She has watched it several times. She said it's fantastic!,1388275200,,106,4.35
4942017,5,B0063FQREO,Excellent movie!  Enjoyed it more than I thought I would.  Can't wait to see the next one. I hope it becomes available through prime soon.,1388275200,,138,4.48
4942018,5,B0063FQREO,the hunger games series is exiting and fun i love also the movie catching fire and i cannot wait to see mocking jay i am in the middle of reading mocking jay now.,1388275200,,162,3.9393939393939394
4942019,5,B0063FQREO,"If you haven't seen this movie by now, where have you been?! I'm not much into futuristic storytelling but this movie was by far one of the best I've ever seen for its graphics, and creative plot..and I can't leave out the great acting job and amazing costumes and make up! I've yet to read the books, which, per usual, are better than the movie (or so I've heard). I've also seen the sequel, which does not even come close to the epic cinematography in the prequel. A def must see!",1388275200,,482,4.3076923076923075
4942020,5,B0063FQREO,Gripping and fascinating  movie. Good portrayal of the characters and a must see for all ages. I may read the book now.,1388275200,,119,4.409090909090909
4942021,5,B0063FQREO,This movie lives up to the hype. It has aboriginal story line and fine performances by all actors. I'm planning  on seeing number two tomorrow.,1388275200,,143,4.72
4942022,3,B0063FQREO,Good acting and direction. The story is interesting and quick paced but has a predictable ending. It is definitely worth a watch though.,1388275200,,136,4.956521739130435
4942023,5,B0063FQREO,Good action packed movie without too much blood and guts. Enough action to keep me interested throughout entire length of film.,1388275200,,127,5.095238095238095
4942024,4,B0063FQREO,Good date night movie with the wife. Pretty accurate to book story line.  I look forward to seeing the next movie.,1388275200,,114,4.428571428571429
4942025,5,B0063FQREO,"But I didn't. I was immediately drawn in by the cinematography. Katniss' character was played exceptionally well by Jennifer Lawrence. I quickly understood what life was like in District 12. Then I was terrified during the reaping process. The contrast between District 12 and the Capitol made me sick. And the actual battle scenes were tension filled and heartbreaking. This was an excellent film. I recently watched Catching Fire at the theater (a review for later on), but I also plan to read all three books.",1388275200,,512,4.965116279069767

4942029,4,B0063FQREO,I have not read the books but was interested in watching this movie. I enjoyed the movie and it makes me want to read the books as I know they will be much fuller and richer in details.,1388275200,,185,3.8947368421052633
4942030,5,B0063FQREO,THE BOOK IS MUCH BETTER BUT I DID ENJOY THE MOVIE I'M SURE THAT YOU WILL AS WELL TRY IT,1388275200,,87,3.4
4942031,4,B0063FQREO,"A entertaining , fast action movie, but I would not suggest it kids under 13 due to the violent nature.  The 2nd movie in the series was much less violent than this first movie.  Unfortunately, the HD download of this movie did not appear to be in HD.",1388275200,,251,4.208333333333333
4942032,5,B0063FQREO,It started out rather cheesy but then quickly caught your interest. I can't wait to see the next movie in the series,1388275200,,116,4.318181818181818
4942033,5,B0063FQREO,Jennifer Lawrence is a great actress. The movie was interesting with a lot of suspense. it gets a little bloody at times but that's what you gettin realistic battle scenes,1388275200,,171,4.733333333333333
4942034,5,B0063FQREO,Jennifer Lawrence gives a brilliant performance.  Movie really keeps glued to the screen.  A must see.  The book was awesome too.,1388275200,,129,5.0476190476190474
4942035,4,B0063FQREO,"Took a little while to get going but when it started moved right along. Bought this movie so when I watch the other one I'll
understand what's going on.",1388275200,,152,4.275862068965517
4942036,5,B0063FQREO,"Loved the movie, but it took over four hours to watch. I finally called amazon and they advised me it was the vizio TV causing the problem. We did not try the fix because we were at the end of the movie. I will try it on the next one.",1388275200,,234,3.7

4942039,4,B0063FQREO,Really enjoyed the story and thought it followed the book. Acting was good and I really liked the costumes. Great !,1388275200,,115,4.523809523809524
4942040,4,B0063FQREO,This movie shows what a strong womyn can do. And how important it is to be self sufficient. Don't like the animal killing however. Also shows how important it is to get along with people even if you don't really like them.,1388275200,,222,4.309523809523809
4942041,5,B0063FQREO,"Great fun to watch and kept me on the edge of my seat because you really don't know what's going to happen from one moment to the next.  A quote from one of the reviews I read said this about the movie.  ""The Hunger Games builds on stories deep in our collective databanks, from the Greek myth of the Minotaur to the fall of Rome, and Survivor, the seemingly indestructible reality TV franchise.  Like the 2000 Japanese movie Battle Royale, to which it bears some resemblance, The Hunger Games works because it hits that sweet spot where classical myth meets contemporary anxiety to become a pop mind-blower.",1388275200,,608,4.663551401869159
4942042,4,B0063FQREO,It starts out slow but ends with a bang!! Can't wait to see the new movie!! Catching fire!! Loved it!!,1388275200,,102,4.15
4942043,4,B0063FQREO,It was not what I expected it to be and I really enjoyed it. Looking forward to then next one coming to Netflix. Hopefully sooner rather than later.,1388188800,,148,4.321428571428571
4942044,4,B0063FQREO,kept to book plot lines. Great casting. Sets up sequels well. Love the Capital scenery.  Next movie should be great.,1388188800,,116,4.8
4942045,5,B0063FQREO,"Lots of action, good story and great acting.  We are looking forward to seeing the other movies in this series.",1388188800,,111,4.55
4942046,5,B0063FQREO,Now I know what the buzz is about. Well worth it. There definitely need to be more selections like this in the amazon video/movie option.,1388188800,,137,4.52
4942047,5,B0063FQREO,I choose this rating because the movie was amazing. It being in had made the movie even better than it already was.,1388188800,,115,4.2727272727272725
4942048,4,B0063FQREO,I suspect it could raise many questions for those who didn't read the book. Look forward to the next two.,1388188800,,105,4.3

4942050,5,B0063FQREO,"I didn't see Hunger Games when it played earlier but my family wanted to see the sequel so I needed to catch up.  I was more than pleasantly surprised at how much I liked this movie and best of all I only had to wait one day to see ""Catching Fire""!",1388188800,,248,3.8627450980392157
4942051,5,B0063FQREO,"I purchased the books for my wife, and intended to read them myself, but never did.
Both she and I thoroughly enjoyed it through multiple viewings from the ""read the books"" perspective and the ""new viewer"".",1388188800,,206,4.75
4942052,5,B0063FQREO,"I say surprisingly good because I never saw it in the theaters. I didn't think it would appeal to me. Happily, it was available on Amazon Instant Downloads, so I thought I would see what I missed. I loved it! In fact, I enjoyed the music soundtrack very much with many of my favorite artists. Right after watching, I bought the audio CD (on Amazon of course) and instantly was able to download the mp3 tracks even though the CD has not yet arrived. In my opinion, the music has a lot to do with the success of the movie. It's one of the best movie soundtracks around. I'm happy I finally saw it (and heard it)!",1388188800,,610,4.222222222222222

4942054,5,B0063FQREO,"This movie was very well directed. I saw the first 2 movies of the trilogy before I decided to read the books. Of course, the books are better read than watched, but they followed it pretty well. If you watch beyond the script, you'll realize that there are holes in the plot and further explanation is required to understand. That's where reading the book will come in handy.",1388188800,,376,4.544117647058823
4942055,5,B0063FQREO,"I've been wanting to watch this movie for awhile but never got around to it until now.  It did not disappoint.  The story was well written, the actors and actresses were all believable and made you root for them or against them.  Katniss is the essence of strength, resourcefulness, courage and compassion.  The ambivalence of the population at the Capitol shows how far removed they are from the districts, that they are a source of entertainment and not even considered human.  It was definitely a movie that keeps you riveted to your seat waiting to see what happens next and rooting for the heroine all the way.",1388188800,,615,4.710280373831775
4942056,5,B0063FQREO,"Although the director did not follow the book as closely as expected, the movie was an excellent depiction of the novel and the character development was spot on.",1388188800,,162,4.821428571428571
4942057,4,B0063FQREO,This movie was thrilling and I was totally engrossed during the entire movie.  I can't wait for the next one!,1388188800,,109,4.45
4942058,5,B0063FQREO,This was something I don't watch but I was glad I did. It was good as it told the story about two sister love.  It's hard to put into words about this show because you will like it or you won't. So yes I would recommend this movie.,1388188800,,231,3.8125
4942059,4,B0063FQREO,Great movie. I can hardly wait to see the next one in the series. The acting and the set was very well done. I loved it.,1388188800,,120,3.6538461538461537
4942060,5,B0063FQREO,"I didn't think children forced to defend themselves or kill others would be a good movie, but it is so well done I found myself loving the movie.",1388188800,,145,4.214285714285714
4942061,4,B0063FQREO,Great movie......kept you interested throughout the movie.  You quickly find yourself pulling for Kat to win the hunger games.  I certainly recommend the movie!,1388188800,,160,5.625
4942062,5,B0063FQREO,Great quality. Absolutely fantastic movie.  I'm working on getting the books for my oldest daughter but if the movie good the book must be great.,1388188800,,145,4.8
4942063,5,B0063FQREO,Movie shows how some people can display incredible courage and honor even when placed in a barbaric and threatening situation.,1388188800,,126,5.35

4942065,5,B0063FQREO,"I think this was a well done telling of the story. Trying to show the emotions and thoughts that are so easily described in a book visually is a very difficult transition for most literary to theatrical releases. This version and the following, ""Catching Fire"", are some of the best I have seen. I very seldom watch movies again soon, but I have watched this one several times with no lack of interest.

A real winner!",1388188800,,418,4.5
4942066,5,B0063FQREO,"Having read the Hunger Games series, I was a little weary about seeing the movie. I didn't think they could do the books justice. I was pleasantly surprised. The movie was true to the book. The only thing is you don't get as much of the back story in the movie. If they tried to do that, it would be five hours long. As it is, they give you the perfect amount of the back stories to let you know who, what and why things are happening. It's wonderful seeing the characters being brought to life.  A must see no matter if you have or haven't read the books!!",1388188800,,557,4.110091743119266

4942069,5,B0063FQREO,"Katniss Everdeen. The name itself is cool, but the character is just as cool, strong and a good shot with a bow and arrow! The movie is suspenseful, and fun to watch especially with your Tweens and teens!",1388188800,,204,4.394736842105263
4942070,4,B0063FQREO,It kept my interest. A bit predictable.  The premise was much like a short story I read years ago in high school.,1388188800,,113,4.136363636363637
4942071,5,B0063FQREO,"Amazing action, you really got into the head of Katniss and her life, where she came from
and the quick thinking that her hunting skills gave her.  Highly recommend!!",1388188800,,166,4.724137931034483
4942072,2,B0063FQREO,"I know this movie and now a series is the hot thing, but it depicts the wrong lesson, violence with children. I think it sends a bad message about children and violence. Just look at what goes on today!!!",1388188800,,204,4.256410256410256
4942073,4,B0063FQREO,"After much fanfare, I finally watched (should have read first the book) this movie right after The Hunger Games 2 came out.  It was pretty predictable and in some ways for a much younger targeted audience.  If anything, I will look to read the series before seeing the 2nd and 3rd movies.",1388188800,,288,4.519230769230769
4942074,5,B0063FQREO,"Good watch, easy to follow, casting and location well done, not overly violent, and obviously the movie told a moral story of good over evil.",1388188800,,141,4.68

For that reason, I ended up waiting until the DVD release before I gave this movie the attention it deserved.  I wish I had not been so biased, because its really quite well done! I was extremely impressed with the action, the CGI and the quality of the acting.  This is not another teen-angst series-- this is a thought provoking, intelligent series that deserves a strong big-screen portrayal.  I feel that the cast and crew have accomplished this and then some.  Very excellent!",1388102400,,644,4.774774774774775

Also, having read the book (I know I shouldn't compare), the on-goings of the Capital city could be explored a bit more.  I thought the development of the relationship between Katniss and Gale and between Katniss and Peeta was way too shallow.

There's one scene where her stylist has any dialog and the influence he has on her in the story is a major one.

Sorry, I thought this one missed the mark.",1388102400,,464,4.554216867469879

It was an enjoyable movie with an interesting premise, but so much went unexplained and the film had surprisingly little emotional impact or honest moments of tension or drama.

4942119,3,B0063FQREO,"For decades, a certain cinematographic elite, has been trying to pass Heroines with masculine, combative capabilities on to the public; in real life I have never met , or heard of the existence of such super girl; I guess that's why Lara Croft could not survive into a cult movie series. Angelina Jolie could not keep pace with the rigorous training required to be Lara.
However there are Heroines with more plausible performances that achieve the ""distinguished courage and abilities, admired for their brave deeds and noble qualities"" which are required to convince an un-buying audience. On this note ""Vertical Limit"" comes to mind, I have converted it into one of my classics. Hold your breath!
Director Martin Campbell and associates spent a good deal of time presenting to the audience the experience, training and background that the two Heroines: Robin Tunney and Izabella Scorupco posses to face their fate on K-2, the assassin mountain, where only 50% of those who go up come down, they both come down, leaving sepulchered above better and tougher male mountain climbers.
I would give Vertical Limit 5 stars if somebody asked me for a rating, its fast, thrilling action I can't compare to any other movie.
H. Games will live it's 15 minutes of hype, but I don't think it'll move up into the undying films category such as Gladiator, The Changeling (the one with George C. Scott, not the one with Angelina Jolie), The Dammed and many other films which time does not allow me to mention.
Jennifer Lawrence has a bright future as an actress providing she gets the right roles and direction; right roles and direction make an actress excellent as much as her talent.",1388102400,,1672,4.870175438596491

I thought the books were okay with an interesting story line and creative fantasies. This screenplay did a good job of maintaining most of what was interesting in the book and telling the storyline adequately. my wife watched it with me and she found it very entertaining.

Only the survivors of these games are rewarded with the ability spend their remaining lives with the ""haves"". The ending provided the usual lead in for the sequel.

4942193,4,B0063FQREO,"If you've read the book, it's a nice visual interpretation. It sets faces to the characters in  your head, but  due to the medium and its restrictions, the plot doesn't give things their proper pacing, and the characters don't really quite push their limits as far as emotions or action.

Also the omissions in the film, for me, really detract from the impact of the telling of the story. Certain details that were in the book that added more depth to the events and items in the story were missing, and it really dulls the potential of some of the scenes.",1387843200,,556,4.485148514851486

4942202,2,B0063FQREO,The contrast between the authorities and the games themselves were quite stark.  The tv personalities were really slimy and cheesy but the games were very real.  All in all not a bad movie but I don't think I'd see it again.,1387756800,,224,4.439024390243903

4942210,5,B0063FQREO,"The movies (for obvious reasons) omit some of my favorite details about the books, however you don't lose any of the meat of the story. That goes for Catching Fire as well. There are some things as a reader of the series that I would have loved to have seen in the films, but all in all I am absolutely happy with the films. Unlike the Twilight Saga, the Hunger Games trilogy is perfectly cast with top notch actors and people that physically and emotionally evoke the spirit of the characters.",1387756800,,494,4.43956043956044
4942211,4,B0063FQREO,"The film ""The Hunger Games"" achieved a much deeper emotional realism than the book it was based on.  These stories could have been so much more than they were.  In his film version of ""The Hunger Games"", director Gary Ross seemed to grasp the potential, and do his utmost to fulfill what he could of it.

Ross took material that never rises beyond a teen-girl fantasy vehicle (with the standard, ""oh no, two boys like me, whatever shall I do,"" formula at it's core) and made it human and resonant.  I went to see the movie out of curiosity, not expecting much, and was more than surprised by my response to it.  The film grabbed me and made me empathize even while part of my mind kept calling ""no way"" on the silliness of the premise and the situations it engenders. Confession: I cried when Rue's dad turned and fought his way out of the crowd.  And, I don't cry in movies! Luckily, others in the theater were sniffling loudly enough to cover my surreptitious eye-dabbing.

With deft but subtle adjustments to character motivation, by dint of understated complexity in the performances, and by allowing the characters to drive the story, rather than the reverse, Ross successfully mined his shallow source material for substance.  He actually made me forget that the books weren't as good as the film he made from them.

After watching ""The Hunger Games"", I eagerly picked up the book to re-read it, and before the end of chapter one I remembered; the book is an elaborate backdrop, and excuse to dote on the waffling of a somewhat annoyingly adolescent girl over two boys who are, of course, slobberingly devoted to her, despite her inability to either commit or put them out of their misery.  I oversimplify a little here, but not that much.  Having already read them, I no longer had the element of suspense to hook me, and I found I just couldn't keep reading.

Ross's film is not perfect, by any means, mostly due to it's wacky and inescapable premise, but the film grants the characters, especially Katniss, enough complexity and believability to allow viewers to willingly (even consciously) suspend disbelief.  Unlike the books, I've enjoyed re-visiting the story in it's film version several times.",1387756800,,2209,4.766404199475065
4942212,5,B0063FQREO,Wanted to see the second and had not seen the first.  Wasn't sure of what to expect.  It far exceeded my expectations.  Awesome!  I was spellbound throughout the entire movie.  Well worth the cost.  Will watch again.  Can't wait to see the sequel.,1387756800,,247,4.604651162790698

4942218,3,B0063FQREO,"This is  too much like the silly drama reality shows that have dominated the TV lineups for the last 13  years.  Are there no good writer's in Hollywood?  The story was very much like ""Survivor"", or the show about the two naked people on the island having to forage and fend off danger.  These absurd stories are supposed to be high non-fiction drama, but we all know that they are highly scripted to ensure conflict and the cast and story line is closely directed by the studio.
  So Danger Games felt like a ""behind the scenes silly story about a badly scripted survivor copy cat reality show"".  Not a very original idea and no where near the level of a ""thoughtful"" and intellectual  drama like ""Lord of the Flies"".",1387756800,,718,4.503875968992248

4942238,3,B0063FQREO,"Society, the man, big business, convention, government (take your pick - the allegory in this movie applies) is evil and is slowly killing us by sapping our freedom, right to life, ability to be creative, right to non-conformity, uniqueness (take your pick - the allegory in this movie applies) and justifies our breaking free of ""the system"" by not playing by the rules.

Hey, I've got nothing against the concept, being a child of the 60's myself.  I just don't see this as original.  It is a good theme with a somewhat tired storyline.  It's been done before and better.  Still, Jennifer Lawrence is very interesting as the heroine that seems to somehow magically commute from a young teenage girl to a full grown woman and back again repeatedly from scene to scene.  I don't think that was by accident.

But please, Donald Sutherland as the evil president.  You don't hate him because he's evil.  You hate him because he's boring.",1387670400,,934,4.751552795031056

4942242,5,B0063FQREO,I am not a movie critic or a spoiler...It was similar to a few books and an old movie.  It did make me recall Brave New World and Lord of the Flies.  Logan's Run...,1387670400,,164,3.7941176470588234
4942243,5,B0063FQREO,This film met my expectations based upon reviews and feedback.  I fell n love with the characters and their challenging mission.  The acting was superb! I found myself waiting and anticipating the next feat. I cannot wait to see the 2013 new release.,1387670400,,250,4.790697674418604
4942244,5,B0063FQREO,Loved this movie!  Served the book justice!  You really feel for these characters and want them all to win! A must see!,1387670400,,119,4.363636363636363
4942245,1,B0063FQREO,Could not get past the general nature of the beast: people fighting to the death.  Is that what our culture is reverting to?  Give me a break!,1387670400,2,142,4.222222222222222
4942246,4,B0063FQREO,Very well done! The movie follows the book closely and Jennifer Lawrence is stunning. It is worth watching more than once!,1387670400,,122,4.857142857142857
4942247,5,B0063FQREO,I like this movie because it gave you hope that nothing is impossble in life. You can succeed and win. If you are patient and help others.,1387670400,,138,4.148148148148148

4942249,4,B0063FQREO,"I had no idea what this movie was about. My grown son played it for me (he had already seen it). I wasn't really interested as I had a lot of work to do. I watched and tried to do my work, but after only a brief few minutes, my mind was captured and I had to stop my work and concentrate on the movie.

I thought it was very good, and I am hard to please with movies and stories overall. I would recommend it.",1387584000,,409,3.755813953488372
4942250,5,B0063FQREO,"I give it 5 stars. I stand by that, despite the fact that Katniss and her well-fed cheeks and hips did not seem hungry for a second. That said, Ms. Lawrence is a brilliant actress and I expect her to have a terrific career. And while I admire her outspoken defense of her body (which is perfectly normal and healthy), she was in this movie cast as a food-starved heroine. And she simply was never credible as starving. But her feistiness more than made up for that lack of verisimilitude. And in the end, it just didn't matter. Great movie.",1387584000,,540,4.41

4942253,5,B0063FQREO,"Very silly premise - hunger games saves the world from wars (that's why I put off seeing it.)  Everything else about this movie was great!  The scenery, acting, dialog, the actors and lots of twists in the story line.  Loved it!",1387584000,,228,4.512195121951219
4942254,5,B0063FQREO,I just love this movie. Jennifer Lawrence is sensational. The whole concept is something new and very cool. Rising up against tyranny.,1387584000,,134,5.136363636363637
4942255,5,B0063FQREO,"I love this adaptation!! Especially Jennifer lawrences's acting. The screenplay stays true to the book, while the special effect and costume design add pizzazz to the movie. I could watch this a hundred times!

4942256,5,B0063FQREO,"Although I like the book better, I did enjoy this movie. There were some things I wish they had gone into more detail about to explain stuff a bit better but over all I was happy. The fact that my husband sat and watched the whole movie and really enjoyed it was a big plus. He and I have two different views on movies and for him to like this said a lot.",1387584000,,355,3.8767123287671232
4942257,4,B0063FQREO,Very different concept...I enjoyed the plot as well as the characters.  Of course I love the science fiction genre anyway!,1387584000,,122,5.1
4942258,3,B0063FQREO,Okay.  Not an epic tale.  Something you would expect as a mini- series on HBO or similar.  Set up for the sequels to follow.,1387584000,,124,4.083333333333333

4942264,4,B0063FQREO,"I saw this in the theaters as well as through Amazon stream...it is a great movie and is even better for the viewer if the books have been read.  With the books, the movies make sense in the manner in which they are shown.  Very good movie and I recommend it to all.",1387497600,,266,4.0
4942265,5,B0063FQREO,Jennifer Lawrence is the rising star of Cinema. She is the future of franchise adventure heroines but is making her mark in indies as well.,1387497600,,139,4.6
4942266,4,B0063FQREO,"I usually get bored and walkout half way through. This is an action, adventure, romance fantasy.  It has a little bit of everything The movie maintains your attention through out.  It is about a heroic young women and man who are placed in a situation where only one is allowed to survive Of course each is willing to die for the other and will not give in to the forces saying only one can live.  Through there resourcefulness and stubbornness they both survive and go on to the happy ever after.  I usually don't like this type of movie but found myself totally involved and pleased with the happy ending.  The acting was excellent..",1387497600,,635,4.535087719298246
4942267,1,B0063FQREO,The story line is horribly conceived. It is not written very well at all. The main character is very unhappy and not very comforting soul.,1387497600,,138,4.56
4942268,5,B0063FQREO,"Loved Jennifer Lawrence performance. She is the thread that held this movie together.  If I hadn't seen this movie, I would've passed up on seeing the second movie ""Catching Fire"" in theaters. Never read the books, but the movie was great.",1387497600,,239,4.829268292682927
4942269,4,B0063FQREO,"This is a good food-for-thought movie. I realize that it would defeat the message of the movie had there been NO violence at all. Still, at times it was a bit uneasy to watch kids dole out and be recipients of violence. I didn't think I would enjoy it as much as I did; most movies are overrated and I expected this one to be as well. It was different without having vampires, witches and mummies. That last sentence cracks me up. OK, I'm done for now. Have a great time if you decide to watch.",1387497600,,494,4.15625

4942274,4,B0063FQREO,"Good movie.  Felt a little scattered and not sure how someone who hadn't read the book would following.  Didn't agree with some of the changes from the story of the book.  It is a lot of story to condense into a movie so some parts had to be left out, but some of the changes didn't make sense.

4942279,3,B0063FQREO,"First, thumbs up for the actors and cinematography. The initial start of the story was great and hooked me... but, once I found out (spoiler) - that the whole 'game' was a set-up, I was like ""what the hell was the point?""  I'm told the next one was better, I truly hope that means the story actually is worth something. - perhaps I should have read the books. I do love to read but never got around to investing the time for a series. Potter wore me out.",1387497600,,454,4.159090909090909
4942280,5,B0063FQREO,The movie ties directly to the book which is very original. The acting is very well done. Definitely worth seeing a few times as you pick up on something new each time.,1387497600,,168,4.28125

4942282,1,B0063FQREO,Nothing uplifting in any way here.  I don't understand how this can be THE movie that everyone wants to see and can't get enough of.,1387497600,3,132,4.28
4942283,5,B0063FQREO,Loved the movie. It was surprising and captivating. I watched it for a second time and I would watch it again.,1387497600,,110,4.285714285714286

4942285,2,B0063FQREO,"Same old rehash of movies that have already been made, such as, ""Running Man,"" ""Gattica,"" ""The Fifth Element,"" ""Lord of the Flies,"" and of course, the far superior movie ""The Hunger Games"" directly copies, ""Battle Royale."" Even Stanley Tucci couldn't save this poorly executed, poorly written, and thoroughly unoriginal bomb.

4942287,3,B0063FQREO,I never understood the point of the movie. I guess it must have to do with the survivalist culture that has overtaken our society. It was just not logical to think the way people in the society did. Perhaps it was written for European folk who might be used to living under communism. I had trouble relating to it.,1387497600,,314,4.338983050847458
4942288,2,B0063FQREO,Movie. It was so dreary I was tempted to go to bed before it ended. Stanley Gucci had a delicious role.,1387411200,,103,3.9523809523809526
4942289,4,B0063FQREO,"Obviously, the movie has been out long enough for people to have an idea of what it's about.  What I wanted to touch on was that if you haven't read the book before seeing the movie, you're doing yourself a disservice.  The movie enhances the book.  Does anyone remember Dune the Movie?  If you had read the book on that one, the movie was an enhancement; if you hadn't, the movie was confusing to the point of distraction.  Fortunately, Hunger Games can be enjoyed without having read the book - I know, I did it.  But I have a far greater appreciation for it after having read the book and truly understanding some of the deeper nuances, and mostly those were with the history of the story.  Truly, read the book, you won't be disappointed if you liked this story.",1387411200,,766,4.428571428571429

Not being a fan of the Twilight series, I was afraid it would be more of the teen hearthrob genre which I don't care for but this really has an interesting story line.  If you know nothing of the series it seems to do a good job of providing some character twists and has you looking forward to the next installment.",1387411200,,475,4.141304347826087

JL is perfect as Katniss, and captured her tone beautifully. It was a challenge to address Katniss's self-speak, her inner struggles, but I think it was portrayed as well as could be done without resorting to a voice-over of her journaling.

They are not good. People have gotten incredibly lazy with their minds, and willing to pay their money to be 'entertained,' while wiling to let other people tell them what to believe. IT IS SAD. Use your own imagination. The visualizations of the train in this movie were great. We need more trains, solar and wind power, less cars, coal, and that great stupidity of all: Nuclear power, used to turn steam turbines.

4942318,4,B0063FQREO,A really good movie.  It would have been even better without the four curse words which were totally unnecessary and didn't contribute to the film.,1387324800,,147,4.88
4942319,5,B0063FQREO,"While not as good as the book, has there ever been a movie as good as the book, the Hunger Games was a great movie full of action.",1387324800,,130,3.6785714285714284

4942327,3,B0063FQREO,"Great movie, but the quality for the price I paid was disappointing. If you pause the movie and restart it, the audio is a few seconds behind the video. A little annoying to watch. I expected better from Amazon.",1387324800,,211,4.435897435897436

4942339,3,B0063FQREO,"After or if you accept the plot, it is reasonably done although I didn't think the characters and their interaction were highly developed.  Perhaps the sequel will further develop the characters.  The states purpose in the plot has as yet not been fully developed either although there were implications that it will be.  Entertaining, some potential but clearly not topnotch.",1387238400,,376,5.233333333333333

4942347,2,B0063FQREO,"I thought it was very slow paced and rather boring. It never explained how there came to be such a division of cultures. I saw the 2nd movie in the theater and almost walked out because it was even more uninteresting. I never read the books, but they may be more interesting. I don't know. Only saw them because my dauthter raved about it.",1387238400,,339,4.3125

4942350,3,B0063FQREO,"The movie was well done, and tried to curtail the amount of violence shown involving the kids, but I just wasn't comfortable with the premise.  Hurting kids is just too close to the surface in our society, even when done as complete fiction.

That being said, Jennifer Lawrence gives a fairly amazing performance.",1387238400,,313,4.886792452830188

4942353,5,B0063FQREO,This is just what I expected when I ordered the product. No complaints and it is great to get a good product on time,1387238400,,116,3.875
4942354,3,B0063FQREO,I did not enjoy the theme. Don't think will read or watch the others.  We have enough crazies out there without adding to their box of ideas or  hallucinations .,1387238400,,161,4.333333333333333

I felt the acting was superb and kept me engaged the entire time. I do feel the second movie in the series ""Hunger Games: Catching Fire"" is better than this one so I only gave this movie 4 stars. I did not read the books yet so I only comment on the movie from a non book reader perspective.",1387238400,,414,4.0

4942366,3,B0063FQREO,"I watched the Hunger Games not knowing anything about it. In fact, just from the title, for some reason, I thought it was about Vampires and only watched it to see what the hype was all about. As a futuristic behavioral movie, I found myself drawn in. Of course, at the end, I wanted to see more of where it was going to go.",1387238400,,324,4.078125

4942372,5,B0063FQREO,"Great movie, full of action and suspense. I did think  the book was much better, as books often are. It's much more in detail and you feel more connected to the characters. Overall, worth watching.",1387238400,,197,4.628571428571429

4942376,5,B0063FQREO,"This movie (the first of three) is about an Orwellian world.  Big government has all the answers.  All the people in the different districts are treated the same....almost enough food and almost no freedoms.  Except for the people in the capital.  They are over the top rich and pampered.  As ""1984"" said everyone is equal.  It is just that some are more equal than others.  This trilogy makes you think about today's world and where it is going.",1387238400,,446,4.641025641025641

4942379,3,B0063FQREO,"I had not read the book and the film does little to develop the character backgrounds and the situation they are in or the state of civilization.  Once my wife filled in some details I was able to catch up.  I suppose things would have become clear about half way through without coaching, but that's leaving too much for viewers to piece together before they can really enjoy the film.",1387152000,,386,4.5

4942386,4,B0063FQREO,"I had low expectations for this movie.  I am pleased to say that it is a good movie.  Some things seem a bit drawn out, but overall it adds to the suspense of the movie.  I would recommend this to anyone wanting a good suspenseful movie.",1387152000,,237,4.108695652173913
4942387,1,B0063FQREO,"Could be one of the worst films I have seen. The action is seemingly motivated only by the spurious needs of the script and franchise, with gaps of logic that even the Scifi genre cannot justify. Probably not worth the dollar it would cost for a pirate copy on a Nairobi street corner.",1387152000,3,285,4.39622641509434

4942395,3,B0063FQREO,I thought the movie was ok but nothing to write home about.  The plot was hard to follow and I could not figure out exactly what the president (Donald Sutherland) thoughts about the games were.,1387152000,,193,4.514285714285714

4942399,5,B0063FQREO,"The film delivered, from the very moving scene when Katniss volunteers in place of Primrose, to the scene I cried during, when Rue was killed. It was action packed, accurate to the book's detail (including the insane looks of people who live in the capital). It even had a lot of subliminal detail that stood in for things that came out in the book, but didn't work into the dialog of the movie, such as the food in the capital, and the scene where a family in the capital bought their child a fake sword so he could pretend like he was in the hunger games, even though people in the capital never had to put their children's names in the lottery. These details don't get explained in the movie the way they do in the book, but it is nice they are there to remind you. The trip to the capital is a prelude for the adventure to come, but reminds readers of the grand spectacle of seeing the Capital for the first time. The training scenes are very well done,  even though in movie form there is no way to explain all the stations and skills, they worked in most of them, and where the contestants spent most of their time. Katniss' character, her family, and Cinna were the most well done. They even managed, to squeak in back story about Katniss' dad, who died from coal mining. My only criticism is they made Peeta way more likable right away, than I felt he was in the book, because in the book Katniss is the narrator, and it's her perspective we get (her thoughts about not being as into him, and not really getting what he was doing to protect her)-but in the movie, you can see it more from an outsider perspective, and how truly clever and loving Peeta is.",1387152000,,1663,4.313099041533547
4942400,5,B0063FQREO,"Well cast, acted and directed. An imaginative, extravagant take on this video game-like story. With many surprising touches, the director kept the action and story moving swiftly forward.",1387152000,,187,5.714285714285714

4942402,4,B0063FQREO,A very good rendition of the book despite the time constraints for development of all characters.  The acting is superb and the film enjoyable,1387065600,,142,4.916666666666667
4942403,5,B0063FQREO,I really enjoyed the Hunger Games trilogy.  The first movie did not disappoint.  It was almost as good as the book.  The action was good and I was on the edge of my seat for Katniss during many of the fight scenes.  I can't wait to see Catching Fire.  Very good movie and excellent trilogy.,1387065600,,290,4.2
4942404,5,B0063FQREO,This is one of those movies that holds your interest from beginning to end!  Great story and put together well.  Definitely makes you look forward for the next one to come out!,1387065600,,176,4.46875
4942405,5,B0063FQREO,Loved it!!!  Saw it for the first time right before seeing Catching Fire and it helped me understand the story better.,1387065600,,118,4.619047619047619

4942410,5,B0063FQREO,I watched this movie awhile back and have been waiting for the price to drop. My son went to see Catching Fire and really liked it but had not seen the first one. So I bought it and now I have to wait on the second movie to hit DVD. This movie shipped on time and in good condition.,1387065600,,282,3.7966101694915255
4942411,4,B0063FQREO,"Eerie type of movie, but the acting was very good.  Settings for cities and costumes were bizarre.  I did enjoy the movie as a whole.  This society did give me the creeps though!!",1387065600,,179,4.363636363636363

4942414,2,B0063FQREO,"I know I may get more feedback about this feedback, but this movie could have been shortened to about 20 mins. We wonder why kids are killing kids in real life; it would have been a better story if Lawrence's character had stayed true to herself and killed no one while letting the others kill off themselves.  Harrelson was the best character of the movie. It was a shame that Sutherland wasn't allowed to use his skills as an actor. I'm still confused as to what Hemsworth was in the movie for other than to ""bring all the girls to the yard (ticket sales).""",1387065600,,559,4.375

4942417,3,B0063FQREO,Good not great would have felt stupid if I had paid to see it at theater. Could have cut 30-30 minutes out....but then the compensation per minute would be really stupid.,1387065600,,170,4.516129032258065
4942418,5,B0063FQREO,Excellent direction and an unprecedented performance by Jennifer Lawrence. The sound levels were a bit mixed but I can live with that.,1387065600,,134,5.136363636363637
4942419,4,B0063FQREO,The movie follows the book almost to the end.  What I didn't enjoy is the moving camera action in the beginning.,1387065600,,112,4.333333333333333
4942420,4,B0063FQREO,Interesting premise offering intense character portrayals by the various actors involved in the film.  Captures and holds your attention up until and through the last moments.,1387065600,,175,5.730769230769231
4942421,5,B0063FQREO,Enjoyed the intimate nature of the movie it felt like was in some of the senses. Kept me engaged during the entire movie,1387065600,,120,4.260869565217392

4942426,3,B0063FQREO,"I managed to avoid being sucked into ""The Hunger Games"" for the last two years, then one dreary Friday night we decided to watch it (we'd seen everything else, it seemed).  It started off well, and I had an idea of what the basic plot would be.  Jennifer Lawrence, although ridiculously young, seems to be an interesting actress.  But more than halfway through, just when you would think I would be on pins and needles wondering who would survive, I fell asleep!

Not a good sign.  I knew that the basic theme - man vs. man - had been explored in many fascinating books, starting with that most chilling of short stories, Shirley Jackson's ""The Lottery"", to George Orwell's ""1984"" and beyond.  What makes ""The Hunger Games"" relevant for these times is that the death-match is carried out on reality television.  Much has been written about and studied in popular culture courses about reality T.V. and the sickness of our society in watching people's real lives, banal or horrifying or just plain silly, carried out in front of millions of mindless viewers.  So, clearly, in ""The Hunger Games"", the real villain is not the conquering capitol, but reality television itself, as the prism through which viewers watch human beings hunt and kill one another.  Clever concept, and I applaud Suzanne Collins for her creativity, but the movie falls short of making this most important of points.  I will read the book and see if it does a better job.  That is usually the case.",1387065600,,1470,4.748031496062992
4942427,3,B0063FQREO,Follows the book very well but the characters in the book seem more real than what the movie depicts.  Overall it is a good movie geared more for the younger audience.,1387065600,,167,4.387096774193548
4942428,5,B0063FQREO,"Good acting,well-written,and you don't have to completely suspend belief in reality to go along with it.

good movie that is entertaining",1387065600,,137,5.523809523809524
4942429,4,B0063FQREO,"I thought it was good! The story line/plot was a bit disturbing, but it was well directed and acted. There were many twist and turns. Mind you I have never read the books, so my opinion might vary than one who has.",1387065600,,214,4.119047619047619
4942430,5,B0063FQREO,This was a great movie. I would watch it again. I can't wait to watch the sequel to this movie .,1387065600,,96,3.619047619047619
4942431,5,B0063FQREO,Entertaining movie. Even better because I watched it thru Prime. I don't know what took me so long to watch Hunger Games. I recommend it. The two hours went by quickly. Watch it.,1387065600,,178,4.424242424242424
4942432,5,B0063FQREO,"Never had a desire to watch this movie for many reasons:
In my personal experience in the past movies that get mentioned so much as this movie has don't deserve it
Can't stand reality shows and actually don't watch TV in part because that's all they show on TV nowadays from what I've seen
Never read the books and most movies that are made from books pale in comparison to the book version
How can teens killing teens be enjoyable for anyone to watch especially when it's done for entertainment?
Sounds and looks like a corny love story from images I've seen and title is terrible choice
2 hr movies. Have hard enough time with 90 minutes for most
etc
Anyways, after finally watching it since I couldn't avoid it since Amazon keep plastering it in my face was way better then I expected.
At first it starts out pretty boring and was about to tune out but when Woody Harelson shows up it totally changes.
You end up with 3 people that seem to hate each others guts at first and by the end of the movie they become lifelong friends.
Everything that happens in between was well thought out planned and executed.
Not as much gory kids killing kids as expected and when it happens it very well done and serves a purpose unlike most of the times it's done in other movies.
Not as much reality, tv show, american idol stuff as I expected so that was great
Donald Sutherland only speaks a couple of lines in the movie but he sure makes them count!
Echoes what I have personally concluded long ago about life which is:
""Only thing greater than Fear is not love but Hope"" or something like that
Unexpected ending though it does seem to give impression there will be 2nd part?
Didn't think nor expected to watch this the whole 2.5 hrs so it must've been outstanding since I don't watch that many movies per year and when I do I have no patience for anything that doesn't entertain or make me feel like I've wasted 1 to 2 hours of my life!",1386979200,,1928,4.358333333333333
4942433,3,B0063FQREO,Description says it all ... the start of the games was very disturbing but once all that was remaining was the main characters it was not that bad of a story.  The acting itself was great and I liked the fact they allowed two survivors.,1386979200,,236,4.2444444444444445
4942434,4,B0063FQREO,"Thematically true to the novel, but a few changes takes away from the strength of the novel. Jennifer Lawrence was awesome.",1386979200,,123,4.904761904761905

4942436,5,B0063FQREO,"Jennifer Lawrence masters this performance, reeling you in.

4942442,4,B0063FQREO,"I have not read the books, but once I watched the movie, it was pretty good.  I am watching it on Amazon Prime rather than watching it in theaters back when it came out because, in my mind, The Hunger Games is still just a ""reboot"" of the ""Battle Royale"" idea done by the Japanese back in 2000.  Still a good movie, although I am glad I didn't pay to watch it in theaters.",1386979200,,372,4.013513513513513
4942443,5,B0063FQREO,"Great movie. Through amazon instant video I was able to stream it with zero interruptions. Even after pausing, it would restart and not miss a beat.

4942444,5,B0063FQREO,I ready the book and finished it right before I saw it. Nefore I went to Hunger Games II saw this again. It was great but so was the second hunger games.,1386979200,,153,3.8125
4942445,3,B0063FQREO,"I watched this movie because I had read the books; it's difficult to judge as the book is better than the film 9/10 times.  Nevertheless, I found it entertaining and the cast was good!",1386979200,,184,4.411764705882353

4942455,5,B0063FQREO,The plot line is truly a scary concept; to think government could have that type of power.  I really liked following Katniss and Peetah and their strategies for survival.,1386979200,,170,4.862068965517241

4942458,5,B0063FQREO,"My view point: Very, very well done production value and entertaining enough to watch over again.

4942459,3,B0063FQREO,"I love both the Hunger Games Film and Books - this review is for this Collectors Edition Boxes set, not the film/story itself. With my affection for the film in mind I was eager to get this Collectors Edition Box Set but I found the extras to be underwhelming - the limited edition collectible is no more than a paper weight. And my greatest disappointment that would have come with any purchase of the move was the directors choice not to include any extra content or deleted scenes.",1386892800,,484,4.511363636363637
4942460,4,B0063FQREO,"While no 2-4 hour film can begin to cover the entire book, this film did a good job of showing viewers a reasonable digest of the story that captures the overall spirit of the book.  I was pleasantly surprised by the rather steampunkish look of the Capitol and its denizens and pleased that the grimness of the districts did not overshadow the humanity of the inhabitants.",1386892800,,372,4.636363636363637
4942461,4,B0063FQREO,I liked the movie but there were several sections where I had to replay it several times to understand what had been said.  If not for that I would have given it 5 stars.  I liked the new characters and especially the little girl Rue.  She was loveable and although she perished in one of the scenes it was one that made the movie real to me.  I bought the DVD because I did not catch this when it was in theaters and I did not want to go see the second one in the series without looking at this one first.  It was worth the money and I will add the DVD to my collection of keepers rather than selling it on my yard sale this summer.,1386892800,,633,3.9140625

4942472,5,B0063FQREO,"I originally skipped this movie because I mistakenly thought that it was a ""kid's movie"".  I could not have been more wrong.

4942477,5,B0063FQREO,"While the books are no great prose, the story is fantastic -- original and compelling. And my No. 1 criteria for a movie based on a book is that the movie not ruin the images I liked from the book.  The potential to bomb here was huge -- but this movie was quite true to the book, probably from the influence of the author but nonetheless a success.  Also, it was well-made, the acting was good, there was plenty of action, and nothing gratuitous.  I do not disapprove sex and violence in movies (in fact I rather like both in movies) -- but I downgrade where sex or violence is an obvious attempt to obscure a bad plot or is the plot.  (ok the exception is when the movie is about sex)  Anyway, here, the danger of adding gratuitous sex was high, and must have been tempting; and the plot was inherently violent.  But, the violence (including the gore) was tempered and the love scenes were true to the story and appropriate for the context.",1386892800,,942,4.354285714285714

I loved the action, the emotions, the philosophical insights, the development of the characters, tension rising, unexpected turns and twists, breathtaking scenery, dystopian touch etc. I suppose culmination is still under way, which is intriguing.
However, the most appealing part was the very human side of the heroine, her sensitivity, love, compassion and desire to fight against injustice.

4942511,3,B0063FQREO,"I'm not the type that likes to give in to any hype surrounding a book. Twilight and Fifty Shades of Grey are prime examples of not living up to the hype. So it took me awhile to read The Hunger Games. I absolutely loved it! I finished it in two days and that's saying something.  The minute I finished it, I eagerly watched the movie.

**possible spoilers**

Since book to movie adaptations are notorious for being bad, The Hunger Games was a solid effort. Jennifer Lawrence played her role impeccably.  I can't think of any actress who could play Katniss as well as Lawrence.  The setting of District 12 and the arena was exactly how I pictured it in my mind while I was reading the book. There were several minor changes that irked me. I want the movie to stay true to the book and the way the author painted the story in all areas. The mockingjay pin wasn't given to Katniss by a woman at the Hob.  It was given to her by the Mayor's daughter.

The changes weren't the reason why I gave it a three star rating. Like another reviewer said, the movie lacked the emotional impact that was so prominent in the book . In the book, you're privy to Katniss's thoughts and running commentary.  You understand her conflictions, fear,  and dilemmas.  For example,  when Foxface died, Katniss was a bit saddened by her death.  In the movie,  Katniss didn't evoke that emotion.  Another example is the level of betrayal Katniss felt when Peeta joined the Careers in the hunt for her. The scene where Katniss was searching for water didn't quite capture Katniss's ordeal in the book.  Overall,  the movie wasn't as heart-wrenching/emotionally-charged as the book.

Perhaps this is my own subjective opinion,  but I felt that the storytelling was a bit disjointed.  If I hadn't read the book,  I probably wouldn't have clearly understood  why the characters did what they did.

Overall, I think this is a good movie as far as book-to-movie adaptations go. I liked it enough to wanna watch Catching Fire.  That said,  the movie didn't do the book justice.

4942569,5,B0063FQREO,Excellent movie.  For all ages with a bit of violence but very good to watch with family. I enjoyed every part of it.,1386547200,,117,4.086956521739131
4942570,5,B0063FQREO,They did a great job sticking with the book and I am truly impressed with the casting.  Jennifer does an outstanding Katniss and I cannot wait to see how the next book/movie goes.,1386547200,,179,4.424242424242424

4942574,4,B0063FQREO,"I really like this movie.  I'd give it a five except that I read the book and no movie ever lives up to a book I've read ... or, at least, not yet. It's not about kids killing kids. It's not a love triangle. It is about how war and violence affect the lives of those who are exposed to it ... especially kids. The movie does a great job of *not* glorifying violence.",1386547200,,366,3.945945945945946

4942576,2,B0063FQREO,Did not like the whole premise of the movie.  Rich using poor for their entertainment......political message in a most grandiose way!  That's Hollywood!  Gave it 2 stars for the young actors!,1386547200,,191,5.096774193548387
4942577,5,B0063FQREO,"No movie can ever really capture the full essence of the book it is based on .... however, I have to rate this one five stars mainly based on the casting of Jennifer Lawrence ,,,, she is perfect for the Katniss role",1386547200,,215,4.142857142857143

4942580,5,B0063FQREO,"Very well done movie.  Follows the book very closely, and where it departs is actually an improvement.  Unlike many books made into movies where the directors completely change it.  Jennifer Lawrence is well case for lead role.",1386547200,,227,5.081081081081081

4942582,4,B0063FQREO,"An entertaining story, based on an interesting, if pessemistic, premise.  I enjoyed the supporting cast of big name stars, and the special effects.  I will probably watch the sequel.

I did have an annoying problem with the technology.  There were frequent interruptions of the show by messages that the system was was searching for signal.  I suspect my WiFi router was misbehaving, but iuntil I get to the bottom of the problem, I doubt I'll be using Amazon Prime for viewing anything I really want to see.",1386547200,,508,4.793103448275862

4942584,5,B0063FQREO,"Outstanding movie. The follow up, Girl on Fire explains a lot stuff.  Must see both to appreciate the whole.  The second one definitely stops in the middle leaving room for a trilogy to find out what happens.  Good stuff.",1386547200,,221,4.615384615384615
4942585,5,B0063FQREO,Great movie! Stayed true to the book and was well acted. It was exciting to see the way my imagination would be played out on the screen. Just as good as I expected it to be. Exciting and suspenseful. Jennifer Lawrence was great. I though Peta would be bigger though because he is supposed to be so strong in the book....oh well didn't take anything away from the movie. Woody Harrelson rocked Hamish,1386547200,,400,4.493150684931507
4942586,1,B0063FQREO,Violence against kids is just unimaginable.  It makes audience of the movie worse than the people portrayed as enjoying this violence against children on screen.  Surprising that these kind of movies are allowed to be screened.,1386547200,,227,5.277777777777778

4942589,1,B0063FQREO,This DVD had some type of strange format. It wouldn't work in our DVD players. It changed something om our home player and I can't watch DVD's on this unit anymore.,1386547200,,164,4.32258064516129
4942590,4,B0063FQREO,This movie was very true to the book albeit sanitized.  I enjoyed it but I think it gave short shrift to the actual struggle of the games to maintain the teen crowd.,1386547200,,165,4.15625
4942591,5,B0063FQREO,Well done.  Stuck pretty close to the book. Effective use of flashback thoughts to fill in back story not fully shown in the film.,1386547200,,130,4.416666666666667

4942593,4,B0063FQREO,The movie was colorful and exciting. I enjoyed the plot and setting. Some portions were slow but overall the movie was entertaining.,1386547200,,132,5.045454545454546
4942594,4,B0063FQREO,"Good movie. I didn't like how Haymitch was portrayed as a drinker but not a drunk. I didn't care for the production value of the movie with over use of Shakey-cam to cover it up. But other than that, it was real good. I also would have liked a bit more of a emotional connection to Rue but that could really just be me. Jennifer Lawrence did fantastic with her role.",1386547200,,366,4.169014084507042
4942595,5,B0063FQREO,Great movie for the entire family. The movie was cast well and followed the storyline from the book without losing too much detail.,1386547200,,131,4.739130434782608
4942596,2,B0063FQREO,"No backstory, bad story setup, random plot events(all of a sudden she randomly decides she's interested in that guy?), Cliche characters, disappointing ending. It had potential and was different enough to Battle Royale to make it interesting, but execution was bad and overall wasn't a very good movie for me.",1386547200,,309,5.2
4942597,4,B0063FQREO,Very good movie. I loved Jennifer Lawrence. Way better then I thought it would be..Loved the way they set up the ending for the second movie.,1386547200,,141,4.461538461538462

4942600,4,B0063FQREO,"Gripping action packed thriller of a futuristic game in which only one survivor is allowed.  The tributes (forced to participate contestants) must contend with each other, the weather and days in a technologically controlled battlefield in which the goal is to try and survive while killing all others.  The contestants are watched by the viewers in this life and death reality game show, where wagers are made and analysts predict the outcome.  The film is well worth seeing!",1386460800,,476,5.076923076923077

4942602,4,B0063FQREO,"I was very surprised at how well adapted the movies was.  Casting was excellent, they stuck to the storyline without adding anything crazy like they often do when adapting books these days.  The special effects were wonderful as well, everything looked as I imagined it would.  The little criticism I've heard have all been ridiculous or unfounded.",1386460800,,348,5.0701754385964914

4942604,2,B0063FQREO,"Hackneyed and silly, there is nothing remotely believable about this story or its execution.  The entire premise, of a society that allows its government to send 17-year-old boys trained in killing and wilderness survival to murder 12-year-old girls, is flatly absurd.  Even the most oppressive and barbaric societies in the history of the world have had no ritual comparably fatuous.  As for the execution, it is trite from start to finish.  There is a ""chosen one,"" a girl who grew up bow hunting and can basically outshoot Olympic gold medalists with a style of bow and arrows she's never even used before.  There is an inane teenage love triangle (shades of Twilight).  There is the placid comic-book evil of a tyrant who trims roses (instead of stroking a cat) while plotting to crush the hopes and dreams of a forlorn and mostly passive populace (shades of the Star Wars Emperor or the less imaginative James Bond villains).  There is trite dialogue with no spark of wit or insight.  Redeeming qualities?: Meh.  Some of the sets were nice.",1386460800,8,1045,4.858757062146893

4942606,4,B0063FQREO,"Hunger Games--Adult--Excellent

Fresh story line; not a rehashed plot. Acting is good; if you haven't read the books, the film is full of suspense. If you have read the books, it is interesting to see how important scenes are depicted. The bad guy appears really evil in a psychotic/give you goose bumps way--you can almost smell the scent of decaying roses..",1386460800,,359,4.885245901639344

4942615,4,B0063FQREO,I had heard from friends that this was a good movie. Twenty-four kids set out to kill each other didn't seem like a good movie but the unexpected friendships that develop make the movie worthwhile.,1386460800,,197,4.6571428571428575
4942616,3,B0063FQREO,"This movie reminds me of life in North Korea, where all the privileged live in the big city, Pyongyang and bring in the slaves from the countryside for sport.

4942622,3,B0063FQREO,I read the books first and think that the movies could of gone a whole different direction than what they did. They left me feeling like something was missing. Not at all as descriptive as the books and there could of been so much more made with this movie. Especially with today's technology! An ok movie but wouldn't watch again.,1386374400,,331,4.533333333333333
4942623,5,B0063FQREO,"Immediately engaging with thought provoking effect that lingers.  The character who created the most interest throughout was Peeta - in the book and the movie, but the story and characters are well-developed. The idea of a central government that uses its people badly is an old historical reality that always needs a new expression and a new audience.  The stark contrast of people who waste to the point of disgust beside the poor districts where people are starving is an excellent tool for raising awareness in young people when they become aware of local and world politics. The costuming was a bit of comic relief and was also effective is showing the difference in quality and talent versus the fast-paced wanna be world.  Overall, this is a great blend of intrigue and social commentary.",1386374400,,795,4.917910447761194
4942624,5,B0063FQREO,Loved the story and the movie.  Had both on my Kindle Fire and couldn't quit on either until I had gotten to the end.  I had started reading the book before leaving on a weekend trip by car.  I found myself stopping at truck stops and restaurants along the way just to read a few more chapters.  Great!!,1386374400,,303,4.172413793103448
4942625,1,B0063FQREO,"Hunger games. The first time I heard about the hunger games someone told me to read the book that it was good. I asked what it was about.  She replied its about children killing children to death over food in a futuristic world.  Now why in the world would I want to read something like that? I am a teacher that's been teaching children for nearly 20 yrs. I have intentionally not read the books and watched the movies because of the subject matter. So since it was free to watch on tv, tonight I decided to watch it. I thought I might understand afterwards. I will never understand the appeal of the hunger games.  Children forced into killing other children. Children cheering on other children to kill one another. The masses taking pride and enjoying watching their children kill one another. I tried to find a deeper meaning but I just can't get passed the children killing children part. My husband says I don't like it because I am not competitive. I would much rather let my children watch the Harry Potter series where at least good is fighting over evil. Anyway I just don't get it.",1386374400,2,1093,4.51010101010101

4942628,5,B0063FQREO,"I always resist giving any bock, song or movie a 2 or 5 stars rating because the deciders predicatively write back suggesting I missed the structure, plot or stars in the movie. But I will take a chance and unequivocally give this video 5 full stars. Perhaps it is because  I never read the book (since I lean towards religious or political book topics).
  The movie is full action with lots of violence, murder and mayhem, due mainly to the governmental behavior. This is great for the drama but the love inference and romance should not be forgotten. The characters and their demeanor wins over the negativity they are faced with.  Rent it if you must but this movie is a keeper BUY IT and the low price shown especially if you invest in AMAZON PRIME. (sorry for the commercial, but I use Prime for almost all of my Christmas shopping, movie watching and purchases).",1386374400,,868,4.580645161290323
4942629,4,B0063FQREO,"This is a good movie,not great but still well worth a watch. It's so long,and tedious at times,but it's still pretty interesting. Jennifer Lawrence's Katniss character is the highlight of this obviously. I did also like the roles portrayed by Woody Harrelson and Lenny Kravitz. The one negative was Peeta - My gosh he is such an annoying dork! Anyway even if you've never read the books,which I never have,the movie will keep you interested. It's strange at times,even dark and violent,though that's not surprising considering the concept. Still a good story of what one is willing to sacrifice for the ones they love and how hard they're willing to fight to overcome the odds. Though this movie's favorite quote after all is ""May the odds ever be in your favor.""",1386374400,,763,4.8320610687022905

Katniss was portrayed as confused, lost, and uninspired. In the book she was the narrator, and you could see the depth of her character(as well as Peeta's). In the movie they were so shallow and a mere shell of who they were in the book. All in all, the movie wasn't very good.",1386374400,,449,4.056179775280899

4942647,4,B0063FQREO,"Pretty good even though it did have a book to compare against. Still isn't as clear or in depth as the book, but most movies based on books are not.  As a movie by itself great!",1386288000,,177,3.9166666666666665
4942648,5,B0063FQREO,"Now I know why everyone was talking about it. I horrific scenario for a story, but certainly exciting. If you've not seen it, watch it!",1386288000,,135,4.44
4942649,5,B0063FQREO,I enjoyed the book and the movie and I wanted a review before I saw the second movie. Really enjoyed watching it on my computer!,1386288000,,128,4.16
4942650,5,B0063FQREO,Great movie. This was actually something I won and I was very happy with the quality and the ease of the download.,1386288000,,114,4.2272727272727275
4942651,5,B0063FQREO,"Solid adaptation of the book.  Jennifer Lawrence is great. They did a good job minimizing the violence, and concentrating on the characters.",1386288000,,140,5.363636363636363
4942652,3,B0063FQREO,"This movie is good and enjoyable to watch (good pace and no objectionable plot flaws), but not great (4 stars) and not a classic for me (5 stars. The comments by others rating this a 3 star seem accurate and give more information.  I had read the books so the story did not seem confusing.",1386288000,,289,4.254545454545455
4942653,3,B0063FQREO,The movie did not have a LOT of the details the book had. I absolutely loved the book and was pretty disappointed that the movie didn't Go into detail on some very specific important details for the story line. I bought the movie so my husband could share my excitement in The book and found that I had to explaina lot to him so he understood what was really going on. It was hard to enjoy it.,1386288000,,393,4.116883116883117
4942654,5,B0063FQREO,it is one of the best movies I saw. I am looking forward to see the continuation of that in the hunger games catching fire.hope others to enjoy it that way.,1386288000,,156,4.064516129032258
4942655,5,B0063FQREO,Better than even the hype -- worth owning! Went to see the new movie Catching Fire right away at the theatre.,1386288000,,109,4.238095238095238
4942656,5,B0063FQREO,"This may be a movie and story for ""young adults"", but it is an INCREDIBLE movie, IMHO, about the human spirit and the truth about our world. It is, has been, and ever shall be a struggle by the have-nots against the haves.

This is a story of REVOLUTION!",1386288000,,254,4.183673469387755
4942657,5,B0063FQREO,"It Closely followed the book, and did a good job of capturing the book scenes.  I liked the black and white feel of the scenes in district 12",1386288000,,141,4.035714285714286
4942658,5,B0063FQREO,Very well told story and pretty close to the book.  Jennifer Lawrence is spectacular! can't wait for the next one!,1386288000,,114,4.7

4942660,5,B0063FQREO,So while I admit that before I had seen this I thought it would follow most of the other books turned into movies and suck. I was wrong and it stayed to the book pretty close. As close as a PG-13 can be of the book I suppose.,1386201600,,225,3.7083333333333335
4942661,4,B0063FQREO,"Great movie!  Action-packed, keeps you guessing, and good acting by Jennifer Lawrence.  I can't wait to see the second one.",1386201600,,123,5.1
4942662,5,B0063FQREO,"Loved it , Cannot wait to see the next on in the series. Love that I can watch it on my kindle fire HD",1386201600,,102,3.2916666666666665
4942663,5,B0063FQREO,Great Family movie if your kiddos are at least 12 years old and older. Went right along with the book. I appreciate the lack of bad language in this movie as well. Good action/suspense and leaves you wanting to see the next movie.,1386201600,,230,4.372093023255814
4942664,4,B0063FQREO,"Love this movie, of course like all adaptations the movie is never as good as the book, but love the casting choices and the movie was very good overall.",1386201600,,153,4.310344827586207
4942665,5,B0063FQREO,It was great to watch this again before going to the movie to see the new one.  This will become a classic.,1386201600,,107,3.8636363636363638
4942666,5,B0063FQREO,"Loved the book, movie was very close - Jennifer Lawernce was perfect as Kat I can't wait to see the next movies",1386201600,,111,4.090909090909091
4942667,1,B0063FQREO,"Besides shallow acting... this is entertainment--a movie of kids killing kids?
about as much sense as a Kanye West vid",1386201600,2,118,4.95
4942668,3,B0063FQREO,"The story was strange, yet a little interesting. I did not read the book, but I am not sure it would have made a difference. This story was not quite my cup of tea. Too much like Holocaust wannabe somewhat.. It was just okay for me.",1386201600,,232,4.065217391304348
4942669,4,B0063FQREO,"Entertaining but not great movie.  Jennifer Lawrence looks great, but there are a lot of things that stretch the story line to absurdity.  Why do they team up, when the strong are brutally violent and the object is to kill everyone and be the lone survivor??",1386201600,,258,4.586956521739131
4942670,5,B0063FQREO,"Jennifer Lawrence is an amazing young actress.  Whatever her role, her face
speaks volumes.  She carries this film beautifully, but other actors give strong
performances as well.  The cinematography is amazing.  Highly recommend.",1386201600,,229,5.848484848484849
4942671,4,B0063FQREO,"While somewhat slow at times, it kept my attention throughout.  The tasteful treatment of the blood issues was greatly appreciated.",1386201600,,131,5.55
4942672,5,B0063FQREO,"""The Hunger Games"" is an excellent movie!!  The main plot/ storyline of the movie is one that is a bit heavy, and (I believe) could produce some deep, psychological questions from any viewers who are underage - and not familiar with the original, Roman ""hunger"" games.  As long as you're aware before you view it, that this is an ADULT THEMED movie - I felt that for what it was (for the story that it is to tell), the movie is extraordinarily well-acted and compelling!!  It is a long movie, but progresses quickly enough that you're not really aware of the time passing - throughout. Jennifer Lawrence - as well as the two lead actors - have been EXCELLENTLY cast, and cause viewers to feel like you're right there with them as the adventure unfolds!  I loved this movie, and would highly recommend it to any Action/ Adventure fans!!",1386201600,,835,4.583892617449664
4942673,5,B0063FQREO,"This movie made me buy the whole series of books.  The casting is superb.  Jennifer Lawrence is an excellent Katniss.  This was well filmed also.  Even though the subject matter may be questionable for kids, the filming took great care of getting the point across without making this graphic and gory.",1386201600,,301,4.8431372549019605
4942674,4,B0063FQREO,Well done adaption of the novel. It's only missing the last star because I felt some of the bits left out would have helped to explain a lot more of what's going on in the end.,1386201600,,176,3.9166666666666665
4942675,5,B0063FQREO,I do not think there are many people who do not know something about The Hunger Games. The books are fantastic and the DVD is very entertaining. This is the first of three movies as well as three books and it is very imaginitive and well thought out. The acting is top notch and one can't help but love and root for Katniss Everdine our heroine. You will mostly be on the edge of your seat seing the different sides of Katniss as she is forced to deal with one deadly obstacle after another while she strives to stay alive in The Hunger Games arena. If you havn't yet seen this movie it's worth the price and time if you seen it in the theatres then you will want it for your collection.,1386201600,,687,4.172932330827067
4942676,5,B0063FQREO,It was nice getting to look back at some details of movie that I happened to miss before. Looking forward to the next movie.,1386201600,,124,4.208333333333333
4942677,5,B0063FQREO,"really interesting movie!
Jennifer is so cool!
i really like her.
but for the story it looks not done yet, i hope second movie will release soon.",1386201600,,145,4.407407407407407
4942678,5,B0063FQREO,"Goes to show that they can make a hit movie while staying true to the book.  Story set in the future when America no longer exsists, what is left is a placed called Panem. The Capital runs Panem surrounded by 13 districts full of slaves. 74 years ago the districts rebelled againist the Capital and lost with district 13 destroyed. As punishment, the Capital made the Hunger Games. The districts had to send 1 male and 1 female between the ages of 12 and 17 to fight to the death on tv. The lone surviver wins a lifetime of money and food.  Now it's time for the 74th Hunger Games and we meet 16 year old Katniss Everdeen living in district 12. When her 12 year old sister, Prim's name is picked, Katniss volunteers to take her place and regards it as a death sentence. But Katniss has been close to death before so survival for her is in her nature.",1386201600,,850,4.273291925465839
4942679,3,B0063FQREO,"This is an interesting movie.  I felt it was well acted and worth watching.  However, if you are at all adverse to graphic violence - and I *know* this movie is well below the violence threshold of many other movies - you may want to skip it.  While the violence is not gratuitous, it is graphic, IMNSHO.

All that said, if the sequel gets the same attention this movie got, I'll probably watch it.  The story line is intriguing.",1386201600,,429,4.379746835443038
4942680,4,B0063FQREO,I don't usually like the movie if I've read the book first but I have to say this wasn't a bad movie.  It did follow the storyline of the books.  More than most movies have.,1386201600,,173,3.914285714285714
4942681,5,B0063FQREO,The actor choices for the characters were perfect. The Photography was great.  This movie follows book storyline pretty closely.  Loved it,1386201600,,138,5.523809523809524
4942682,5,B0063FQREO,Very close to the book. An exciting and finely crafted movie. It keeps your attention from the opening scene to the last.,1386201600,,121,4.545454545454546

4942684,5,B0063FQREO,"This is one of the most original plots I've come across in years, but the true strength of the book lies in the characters. I am in awe of Jennifer Lawrence's talents. An excellent read that will keep you up all night.",1386201600,,218,4.214285714285714
4942685,5,B0063FQREO,I watched the movie last year but I love watching it again and again.  This is a really good movie.,1386201600,,99,3.95
4942686,3,B0063FQREO,Read the books. As usual they are much better but still brutal.  the movie had to streamline the story line  long movie.,1386201600,,120,4.409090909090909
4942687,4,B0063FQREO,I liked it but my daughter loves it.  I bought the movie for her.  She's going to be so surprised!,1386201600,,98,3.85
4942688,5,B0063FQREO,"This book flows on from the first. Excellent reading and I fully recommend this book.  After reading the book, the Movie is easier to follow and makes it more enjoyable.",1386201600,,169,4.633333333333334
4942689,2,B0063FQREO,"Dull, slow and boring, bad acting and story. I don't understand the popularity of this movie.  Harrelson is awful and Lawrence is plain. Wwatch something else.",1386201600,,159,5.115384615384615

4942691,5,B0063FQREO,"Except one small thing, a believable story which make movies like this enjoyable.  I've been wanting to see it, but FIOS won't rent it and they want more than the DVD costs to buy it.  Watched using Amazon Prime on my laptop.",1386201600,,225,4.333333333333333
4942692,5,B0063FQREO,Enjoyed watching this a second time too!  It was very entertaining watching this movie even a year later.  Very suspenseful!!,1386201600,,125,5.2
4942693,4,B0063FQREO,"I was surprised at how this movie held my interest.  I read the books years ago, but thought I would not like the screen version...well, I was wrong.  I'm not sure how easy it would be to follow if you had not read the book, but the popularity of the franchise leads me to believe that it's possible.",1386201600,,300,4.155172413793103
4942694,5,B0063FQREO,"Not as good as the books, but for a movie it's really good. Jennifer Lawrence is great as Catnis. looking forward to the next one.",1386201600,,130,4.24
4942695,4,B0063FQREO,"Movie was pretty good, not sure how the book is- probably better. They should explain things in the movie a little better, instead of leaving you in the dark on why all the hunger games stuff exists...",1386115200,,201,4.45945945945946

4942697,5,B0063FQREO,"I love this movie! It's a great movie. I, myself, am not into movies like this genre, but my friend had me watch hers and I HAD to buy this movie. It's an astounding tale.",1386115200,,171,3.914285714285714
4942698,2,B0063FQREO,"What a bunch of hooey. Deep meaning? HELLO!!! Changing rules in the middle of the game, creating creatures at will, what a waste of time.",1386115200,,137,4.52
4942699,4,B0063FQREO,"Very good movie, the acting and effects were excellent, but I found the subject matter to be somewhat disturbing.  My kids (11 & 12) seemed to be ok with it and enjoyed it.",1386115200,,172,4.212121212121212

4942702,3,B0063FQREO,"Ok, not bad. I expected better. The beginning was a little bit confused. I guess I need to read the book first.",1386028800,,111,4.090909090909091
4942703,4,B0063FQREO,"The book is better! The movie leaves so much out because (let's face it) it is not easy to make a film where more than half of what is going on is her thoughts and feelings-which I think are stronger rendered in print. The whole story is told in first person. So all the other characters in the story are told from her perspective-something that does not come out well in the movie.  As a result, it left a lot of confusion to any movie goer that did not read the books.  Still the movie is good.  I just suggest anyone who has not read the series do so before watching the movies.",1386028800,,581,4.123893805309734
4942704,4,B0063FQREO,"Before I watched the Hunger Games I thought it was just a rip off of Running Man, but it is a stand alone story, despite the similar themes. This story illustrates that, even in a horrible world, all types can be found and that even in the worst of situations, some people choose to retain their humanity.",1386028800,,305,4.368421052631579
4942705,4,B0063FQREO,"This is a good movie.  It's even better if you have read the book prior to seeing the movie, which I highly recommend, so you can understand what's going on exactly.",1386028800,,165,4.32258064516129
4942706,5,B0063FQREO,Upon watching this movie I was a little bit skeptic because it was a young adult adaption.  I assumed it would be poorly scripted and made like the Twilight films and others in that vein.  I was terribly mistaken.  Jennifer Lawrence gives the performance of a life time.  This is a very well made movie which kept me interested the whole time.  This is a great addition to the collection.,1386028800,,388,4.485714285714286
4942707,3,B0063FQREO,"It wasn't a bad movie but it was all the same. I could look the other way with some of the cheap sets and acting but the story was way too long and bland. When you finally get to the fighting (I had no idea that kids would be killing kids, so that took me by surprised) your cringing at the fact that you know a little 12 year kid is going to end up dead and it just kills the whole movie for me. I really don't want to see kids killing kids and quite frankly, I'm not always wanting to see killing in all movies either. To say that the movie is criticizing our own culture does show, there is meaning in there but then others have done that years ago and when is it taken too far and overblown?",1386028800,,695,3.9014084507042255
4942708,4,B0063FQREO,"I had first thoughts that this would be a film for the younger set, but I found it most entertaining. Jennifer Lawrence is a very talented actress, and the story line was very enthralling.",1386028800,,188,4.5588235294117645
4942709,3,B0063FQREO,"Super Acting, but even for a ""futuristic"" idea, it leaves one unsatisfied. Is this really what the public wants?  Guess so as number 2 is already raking it in.",1386028800,,159,4.482758620689655

4942715,5,B0063FQREO,"Love this series!  The premise of the fantasy is thought provoking; it's Ggeat for all ages, and the movie is pretty close to the book!",1386028800,,135,4.4
4942716,4,B0063FQREO,"Good character development and true to the book, except for one scene that was from book two, but it ""fit"" just fine.  I also like that Katniss and Peta were not presented as all macho, like Lara Croft or most males in other movies.  They seemed flawed and I liked that - more realistic.",1386028800,,287,4.296296296296297
4942717,5,B0063FQREO,"Ok, I get this email from Amazon before it even shipped to me, lucky I have seen the movie before, otherwise, how can I rate something I haven't even received yet?
The movie, its a great movie.  For those who don't know, its a story about young children who are forced by their president to be reaped into an arena to fight for the death.  A young girls name was drawn and her sister volenteers to take her space.  She then goes into the games, falls in ""love"" with the other tribute boy from her district and to make a statement, they decide they were going to die together at the same time, so no one wins the hunger games, what happens next makes the next movie.",1386028800,,665,4.2204724409448815

4942719,5,B0063FQREO,Awesome book and awesome movie.  The series of three books were very exciting to read.  The series reminds me to Harry Potter series.,1386028800,,133,4.739130434782608
4942720,2,B0063FQREO,Kids should not be watching this let alone reading this book. This was marketed all wrong. PARENTS SHOULD READ THE BOOK FIRST!,1386028800,,126,4.7727272727272725

4942724,5,B0063FQREO,I thought the movie did a great job of following the plot of the novel.  I really liked the black and white parts that depicted the dreariness of Katnis's home place.  Also her dress as she turned and it resembled the flames.  Signed E.R.,1386028800,,238,4.363636363636363

4942727,5,B0063FQREO,"Great movie- not as good as the book, but still good! I would not recommend watching this if you haven't read it. Much of the book is actually the inner thought process of Katniss, so you miss out on that in the movie.",1385942400,,218,4.093023255813954

4942732,5,B0063FQREO,"Action packed with a believable story line. Nice to watch a movie thats not polluted with vulger, offensive language, but still intence scenes that capture the imagination and pull at the heart while stimulating the brain! Good job. hope the sequal lives up to this standard.",1385942400,,275,5.0

4942735,5,B0063FQREO,Excellent movie that does a very good job of staying pretty true to the book.  Visually stunning and a powerful storyline this movie will keep you on the edge of your seat.  This isn't a lighthearted movie or blow 'em up action flick... this is a movie that will make you think.  Despite some darker themes I really love it and can't wait for the rest of the series.,1385942400,,366,4.27536231884058

4942743,4,B0063FQREO,"Good sci-fi ... J Lawrence does great work as Catniss... Also, the film offers some insights into where ever-expanding, Big Government can lead... killing off selected youth for entertainment purposes in order to control the masses. As long as you're on the inside of the controller [i.e. the benevolent government] ... you're promised great TV and entertainment. As long as it's not happening to you, just sit back and enjoy it! ... after all, your Government loves you! :-]",1385942400,,475,5.025316455696203

4942746,5,B0063FQREO,"I was introduced to this series by my 14 year old grandson. Had he not explained the story line to me, I probably would not have ever watched it.
It is a story of life and survival in a futuristic  world.
Certain youths are choosen to fight to the death iin a style that is reminescent of the Roman gladiators. The contest is brutal and it's done for the  entertainment of the governing powers and  upper classes. The winner of the games superficially unites the ""haves"" and the ""have nots"" by means of a natioinal hero
It also reminds the.""have nots"" that they have no control over their lives.
 What is different is that the playing field is cyber controlled  and can be manupulated at the whim of the governing powers. They can also change the rules of the game, at will.
 Itt has everything  we want in a  good story....: characters you love to love,  those you love to hate  and those  you can not decide  on.
Suspence, excitement, romance, courage, rebellioin.. It is a believeable story, for the most part, and I am hooked.",1385942400,,1030,4.478494623655914

4942754,5,B0063FQREO,"I love this book, and the movie did it justice. They chose a fantastic actress, and the script stuck to the plot from the book, something I'm happy to see is becoming more the norm. I recommend this to anyone, male or female. My husband agreed to go see this movie based solely on the poster with the flaming mockingjay pin. He ended up loving it and read all three of the books afterwards.",1385942400,,390,4.283783783783784

4942761,5,B0063FQREO,"Loved it and I don't normally like show that have violence.  It is only a small, but exciting part of the movie.  Saw HG II yesterday and it was AWESOME!!!  Can't wait for #3!",1385942400,,175,4.088235294117647
4942762,5,B0063FQREO,"Great movie over all. Love the plot...character developement. The main character sells it and makes it believable, the special  effects were pretty good, and the action was enjoyable and I'm pretty critical about movies and especially this new phenomenon of female ""tough guys"". Katniss is beleiveable and likeable and you root for her almost from the start.",1385942400,,358,5.280701754385965
4942763,5,B0063FQREO,Loved it.  True to book.  Read the trilogy.  It's a must read.  Catnus is the up expecting heroine in the story,1385942400,,111,4.142857142857143

4942769,5,B0063FQREO,"Watching this for the second time was even better! I wanted to rewatch this before I went to see ""Catching on Fire"" - good choice. Caught me back up and made me excited to see Katniss kick butt again!",1385942400,,200,4.153846153846154
4942770,4,B0063FQREO,"I loved the book, but some of the cinematography was a little hokey. I was not a fan of Peta's casting, though by the second movie he's much better, so it makes sense now.",1385942400,,171,4.0588235294117645
4942771,3,B0063FQREO,I did not know anything about this movie. The other night we were passing by a movie theater and I saw huge number of fans for the sequel of the movie so later I watched it. It was entertaining and good. I liked it.,1385942400,,215,3.909090909090909

WAS ALMOST AS GOOD AS BEING IN THE MOVIE ON LARGE SCREEN!!",1385856000,,131,4.739130434782608
4942775,1,B0063FQREO,"I don't know what the rave about this movie is all about.  I watched this movie because Hunger Games 2 was coming out and I wanted to know part 1.

The story is predictable if you've seen a lot of movies (including foreign movies).

The story is analogous to Rome and its gladiators fighting to the death as entertainment for the citizens and the contestants are on stage (or in this case, kind of like the Truman Show movie) where there are cameras watching every move that the contestants make and the people behind the tv show can interact with the contestants through computers.

However, kids killing kids is just tasteless. Hollywood is encouraging real-life massacres like COLUMBINE school, SANDY HOOK Elementary School, University of Texas.  I hope Hollywood feels responsible when school massacres happen because it is perpetuating it.  At least the romans used adults whereas Hollywood used kids.  The parents of these kid actors are pimps prostituting their kids to Hollywood for a buck.

CONCLUSION: Not recommended, I was bored and I was disgusted that so many people participated in this movie about kids killing kids.",1385856000,,1132,4.98404255319149
4942776,3,B0063FQREO,"Here me  out before you get huffy on me...........first i didn't pay any attention to this movie until 2 just came out recently so i said i'll watch this one, my GF was telling me oh it's a great movie and blablabla(hyping it up) so im like ok let's watch it sugarcoat. so I'm looking at the cover which has the chick with the arrow(like part 2) and it sets you up to believe this movie is all about hunting/games. NO!!! hell the first hour and 15 mins is all about chatting and whats to come. I'm like hurry up and get to the hunger games activities. to make a long story short what happen was they spent a lot of time talking and about 20 mins of actually action. and it was PG action at that. this is a let down if you're thinking you going to see a lot of epic battles and ""cool"" kills.",1385856000,,790,4.031847133757962
4942777,5,B0063FQREO,"I didn't want to see this movie; figured it was for 'kids.' Imagine my surprise when I decided to watch on Amazon! I can now see what all the hype is about. The story was different, and I was dazzled by the creativity of the costumes, make up, and the sets. I will be seeing The second installment in the theater!",1385856000,,313,4.147540983606557

4942781,5,B0063FQREO,"Awesome movie, I read the book first and I think the movie followed along well. I'm glad they tried to censer as much of the violence as possible to provide for a younger audience. Jennifer Lawrence is such a good actress, she makes the movie!",1385856000,,243,4.4222222222222225

4942783,4,B0063FQREO,"This movie was better then I thought it would be.  I have never felt good about the idea of people being in an arena that kills another to acquire an end.  This is not a healthy thing I believe.  The actors and actresses were very good, and I appreciate that.  I got this movie because a person I respect believed it was a good movie.  It was, but sad non the less.  It leaves little to hope or love.  They won, but to win others must be lost.  That really makes it a no win in the eyes of a person that believes in good.  A population that perpetuates such a scheme is lost.  It makes me so sad!",1385856000,,596,3.9327731092436973

4942788,4,B0063FQREO,"Great book, good movie. I found it pretty entertaining, its hard to make movie exactly like the books but I think they did a pretty good job. You don't have to be a fan of the books to enjoy this movie.",1385856000,,202,3.951219512195122
4942789,3,B0063FQREO,"Good imagination and premise, but would've liked to have more insight into the inner thoughts of the heroine as she battled for survival. Some actions seemed out of character to me.",1385856000,,181,4.870967741935484
4942790,5,B0063FQREO,"It's really not about kids killing kids.  It's about government out of control, how far reality t.v. could go, and how those with money & power are the puppeteers of the world that pull all the strings.  Sound familiar at all?",1385856000,,226,4.487804878048781
4942791,3,B0063FQREO,"It is a fun post-apocalyptic story where the good guy (girl) wins and the silly looking bad guy loses. The acting is good, but not great. The tortured acceptance of the heroine's position isn't accompanied by a rage that validates her actions. Her reluctance to kill is laughable. In a real situation, killing anyone who was responsible for her family's/villages situation would have been cathartic for the character and the audience.

Looking forward to the sequel.",1385856000,,466,5.131578947368421

4942798,3,B0063FQREO,"Appeal is to the 12 to 21 set.  I did not see anything really extraordinary.  The portrayal of the elite was very cheesy, silly to the point of being ridiculous.  Miss Lawrence did a good job of acting.",1385856000,2,202,4.2631578947368425
4942799,5,B0063FQREO,"Not having read the novels, I happened upon this movie because 'everyone else' was watching it at the house for a reunion.  I'll be honest, the story's compelling and I was pleasantly surprised with the pace of the movie, the action sequences, the character building.  If you have to be spoiled, if you saw the movie The Running Man...along those lines but definitely less cheesy and a more serious movie by far.  Highly recommended to add to your watchlist.",1385769600,,458,4.772151898734177

Hard to describe it as ""entertaining"" because that implies some sort of fun and jolly experience to me!  However, ""spellbinding"" is more like it, and would recommend it to those who want to stay up with what the young people are seeing!

The books make the introduction to the movie much clearer.  Otherwise, the beginning of the movie feels rushed and just jumps right into the plot without you really having any idea what's going on.  Otherwise, the movie was quite good and the acting was top notch.  For me, watching a second time really make it a good watch.  Enjoy!",1385769600,,471,4.482352941176471

Although I don't think, as some do, that Katniss Everdeen is a kick-butt heroine, Jennifer Lawrence is an actress worthy to follow.  The best actors don't have to say a word to get a point across sometimes, and at her relatively young age, I think Lawrence is close to mastering that technique.",1385683200,,436,4.4375

4942835,5,B0063FQREO,"The Hunger Games, based on a series of books by Suzanne Collins is a gripping story that is made even better by Jennifer Lawrence's performance. Set in a dystopian future, the United States that we know suffered through a civil war and is now broken up into a number of districts, all working tirelessly and in abject poverty to support the capital city and their opulent lifestyle. To ensure the districts remember their loss in the war, two children are randomly picked from each district and are transported to the Capitol. The children are trained and put on display as instant celebrities for the consumption of the coddled public of the Capital City. Once ready, they compete in the annual Hunger Games, a fight to the death with each other, with the sole survivor named champion.

The Hunger Games is a very entertaining movie made all the better by the performances of the cast, most especially Jennifer Lawrence. She gives a dynamic, compelling performance that should not be missed!",1385683200,,992,4.8698224852071
4942836,3,B0063FQREO,"OK, it is a somewhat entertaining movie. Kind of sad the way the story assumes that brutal murdering of other people just comes so naturally to these kids. Maybe the book brought out the sheer horror of the situation. The movie sure doesn't.
It seemed as though I went from watching American Idol to Survivor. Once upon a time authors did not have to steal their ideas from television in order to achieve a plot that seemed relevant. The whole fascist theme could come out of any totalitarian regime, past or present.
If it serves to wake anyone up to the rapid demise of our freedoms and total disrespect for our inalienable rights as human beings perhaps it is worth the price of a ticket or rental.",1385683200,5,701,4.52755905511811

Plus, she's HOT. That being said, the movies' story line was a different slant on other movies from the deep dark film history past that had futuristic games to stay alive as its story line.
Nice seeing Donald Sutherland working again besides doing voice overs on orange juice commercials.

And WOODY!!!!! Who doesn't love Woody? Apparently, not his real life father, but thats another story. Woody makes the part of the Lovable Lush nice to watch.

4942867,5,B0063FQREO,"A week before this movie was released on dvd, I decided to read the book before buying the movie. I still to this day can not recall ever reading a book as fast as I read The Hunger Games. To describe the book (well I would have to review the book itself). I had my doubts about the movie at the time, but after watching it, I was completely hooked.

This story introduces us to Katniss Everdeen(Jennifer Lawrence) and her sister Prim, mom (whose name is not ever revealed). Early on it is made clear that Katniss is really the backbone of the family. And right away it is also clear that life: everyone and everything around her is depressing. To be honest, the town looks and feels like a communist society.
With The Reaping coming up, that is-tributes from each district selected at random to participate in the grueling Hunger Games-which is-an olympic like showdown designed so that 24 contestants fight, kill (yes kill) to come out on top. Unfortunately for older tributes, your name is entered multiple times, which obviously makes you more likely to be chosen. While at The Reaping along with Prim and Katniss's friend Gale (Liam Hemsworth), Prim is unexpectedly chosen which makes Katniss volunteer herself in her sister's place. And thus, we are given a movie.

There is so much to admire about the movie The Hunger Games. The acting, from Woody Harrelson's sometimes hilarious but serious toned performance as Haymitch to Amanda Stenberg's adorable performance as Rue, is really on point in the movie. The movie does a good job of digging into your emotions as well. There are going to be times in the movie where you will want a certain character to survive and live, of course you will have some characters that you want to die immediately. I hear this complaint all the time about ""well this should have been in the movie"" or ""why was this part in the book but not in the movie?"" I hear it a lot with my friends and colleagues. Movies like Harry Potter or The Chronicles of Narnia, etc. come to mind as great examples of working around the lengthy pages and being adapted to two hour or more movies. This one really stayed with the book in my opinion. Obviously, there were some things left out, but as for the movie itself, it does stay on par with the book.

To close, you can and will expect drama, action, suspense, and many more things with this movie. I definitely can say that the books by Suzanne Collins (I am currently reading Mockingjay) are also definitely worth it. The Hunger Games is not just about the will to survive, it is about Katniss's courage and will to win. Again, The Hunger Games by Suzanne Collins is a fantastic read, and this movie directed by Gary Ross is an exciting watch. I hope I have not set my expectations to high for The Hunger Games: Catching Fire, which I will be seeing this weekend, but I am even more excited to write my review for it since I have been hearing such great things about it. If you have not yet seen this movie, GO WATCH IT. My rating for this movie:

9/10

Its big budget and hipster fan base aren't enough to save this boring piece of work that should have stayed at the library.

In the end I will say this movie was easily a 0%- Its long, boring, and leaves you with a bad taste in your mouth.

Okay, Spoiler Time!

Now most people thought this film was some all new and completely original thing, but it is far from it my friends.

This movie (and it's book series) RIPS-OFF the Japanese Battle Royale to a ridiculous degree.
Everything in this movie was ripped off from Battle Royale; The Future, The Tone, The Set-up, The Rules, The Entire Movie...

The Hunger Games SUCKS, and it's author is a no talented hack.

So, is my score different? Nope, i'm sticking with the 0%. I'm telling you, the author REALLY rolled the dice on this, and it's a totally unoriginal bomb.",1385424000,3,871,4.372670807453416

4942901,2,B0063FQREO,"Just to make it clear, I have not read The Hunger Games and I don't intend to. I have my reasons. I have my reasons which I spend a considerable amount of time explaining, as the question of why I'm not going to read The Hunger Games is now the most frequent question I'm asked by people that know me in person. Also, let's just say, the movie only affirmed those reasons, so I'm even less likely to read the book now than I was before I saw it. But I'm sort of jumping ahead...

So here's the spoiler warning, because I'm not going to be very careful about what I say since I expect that most of you that actually care have already seen the movie anyway (and nothing I say is going to change your opinion, but, still, maybe I can make a person or two stop and think). If you haven't already seen it, you probably don't care enough for it to matter.

We're supposed to believe that Katniss and the other members of District 12 are poor. But not just poor, dirt poor. As in they don't have enough to eat. They don't have good clothes to wear. That's what the film would like us to believe from the presentation. But it doesn't back it up. Everyone is too healthy, and they have nice, clean clothes (and, evidently, plenty of them). Not just Katniss. Everyone. Especially Katniss, though, with her round cheeks. No one here is deprived. They're also clean. All of them. Pristine clean. Even Peeta in the midst of throwing out scraps to the pigs in the mud during the rain is wearing pristine white clothes. Poor people don't live like this. My sense of reality is already at odds with the movie, and it's barely started.

The next major disconnect is ""the reaping."" It's a stupid name for what's going on as the whole thing is ""random."" That's not what reaping is at all. But my big issue here is the way that everyone just stands by while it's going on. Even the parents. It's totally unbelievable. Throughout history, we have seen parents go to all sorts of lengths to protect their children. Even up to death. So I can't buy into the fact that the parents just stand by and allow their children to be taken. Without protest. Of any kind. I don't care what kind of social conditioning you try to say is going on, there is nothing that can override the biological need of a parent to protect his/her child. At least, in the short story ""The Lottery"", the people don't know why the lottery is happening. It's origins have been lost, and they don't know what kind of badness will transpire if they fail to follow through every year. Superstition lends believability to the events. But they do know in Hunger Games, so that whole set up came off as contrived to me. And, of course, it is contrived, because that's what authors do, but it shouldn't feel contrived. That did. Even if Katniss' mother wasn't going to wail or protest, someone should have. Peeta's parents didn't. And there was no mention of it from any other district, either, so it just rang false.

Since we're on the subject, were we also supposed to believe that that was the entire District 12 there in that courtyard? That was it? There's few enough of them to fit all the names in that one little fish bowl? A couple of hundred kids in the whole District? Give me a break. And if that was it, if that's what we're supposed to buy into, then I can't buy into districts that are that small supporting a city the size of the capitol. Especially at the level of technology they have. It's also way beyond plausibility that they support all of that off of coal mining. Seriously? That's what we're expected to believe?

All of that to say that I was already busy shaking my head at the ridiculousness of the entire thing within 30 minutes. I don't know what the book is like, but the movie created a foundation built on sand. I think it was made out of sand, too. I mean, the whole set up is just so that they can make the point that it's all for the entertainment of the city folk. I get the point. I even appreciate the point. But you have to make it believable.

Other things I couldn't buy:

The flaming clothes of Katniss and Peeta: Not that I couldn't believe the possibility of it, but I couldn't accept that Cinna was the only one to think of something extravagant. Again, give me a break. Not a single one of the other publicity people were creative enough to think of something cool to bring attention to their people?

Peeta: Shy boy from a backwater district suddenly becomes all cool and suave for television? No way... That coupled with his speech to Katniss about how he didn't want them to change him just about made me gag.

The game itself. And this will be my last point, but it's a big one.

The idea is that the 24 tributes will fight to the death for riches and glory, but only four of them, the representatives from Districts 1 and 2, are invested in that. The rest of them, mostly, just really want to live. Collins, in effect, put the characters into a situation where they have no motivation to make anything happen. After that first rush for supplies, it becomes enough that the tributes just figure out a way to live. Even Cato, in the end, just stakes his territory and sits around and waits. There is no motivation for anyone to do anything, and that's just bad writing. In order to move the story along, at this point, Collins (because she was involved in writing the script for the movie, too) has to introduce an external force to push the characters into what she wants to happen. Again, this whole sequence of events came off as very contrived. Because it was.

The dogs were stupid. I mean, that whole bit with them coming out of the ground was just dumb. And, then, Katniss and Peeta running to where they knew Cato was? Also dumb. Katniss had already shown great skill at climbing trees, so the fact that they ran off through the forest to get to the clearing was just beyond reasonable. Except that that is where Collins wanted them to be.

Also, the whole ""there can be two winners"" ""oh, no, we lied"" bit. Also dumb. And the wasps. Convenient. Especially since they managed to not sting anyone in the at least 12 hours the sitting right next to them.

And, since I haven't read the books, and I don't really know what's going on with it, I won't say a thing about the ""love"" story. Maybe my initial thoughts about it will be proven incorrect, so I'll reserve judgment.

Not to be completely negative, though, Woody Harrelson was great as Haymitch. I've seen a lot of criticism about that character from people that read the books, but I thought Harrelson was great. Actually, I think Harrelson is a generally underrated actor.

The only person better? Stanley Tucci. He was amazing. Tucci is another actor that rarely gets the credit he deserves.

I'd like to say I was impressed with Elizabeth Banks, but I think her makeup did most of her acting for her.

And I'd really like to say that I was impressed with Lawrence, but, really, I don't think she stood out at all in the role. There was nothing that she did to make the role hers. Nothing that made it distinct. Nothing that would keep a dozen other actors from stepping in and doing the job just as well. Or, maybe, better",1385337600,2,7179,4.414210128495843

The movie was about glorifying violent action and the entertainment of showing children killing is in poor taste even for Hollywood.
If I knew what the movie was about, I wouldn't have watched it.  All I knew was that I heard about it and it was part of Amazon Prime!
I certainly would never read a book based on this idea.",1384905600,6,697,4.421875

4942952,5,B0063FQREO,Its awesome!  Can't wait for the sequel!  There's so much going on in the film and the acting is terrific.  I really enjoyed it.,1384905600,,128,4.25
4942953,5,B0063FQREO,"I saw (to me) a new (and very good) actress, the script was completely different from anything else out nowadays, the premise of the story and ending left me wanting more. Their world was not so far removed from ours and believable, the blending of past and future technologies piqued one's interest. Not having read the books, the movie stood on its own. I rented this movie when it became available, and just watched it again on Amazon. This time, I was much more impressed by the depth and scope of the story, and Jennifer's ability to carry it on her shoulders.",1384905600,,565,4.549019607843137
4942954,3,B0063FQREO,The book was much more interesting. Much more in-depth and many more hours of enjoyment. The visuals given by the book in your imagination are way beyond what film can express.,1384905600,,176,4.709677419354839

4942958,5,B0063FQREO,"Engaging  film rendition of the popular book.  Some of the back story was lost in translation to screen, and reading the book before viewing the movie is time well spent if you want a good understanding of what is happening to these young people and their communities. The main characters and story are well-developed and certainly evolve as the film rolls. The book and the film both have an interesting take on the normalization of violence and the cost of complacency when faced with tyranny.",1384819200,,495,4.811764705882353
4942959,1,B0063FQREO,Absolutely horrible DVD quality. I buy a lot of DVD through Anazon. I bought this one - watched once - worked well -  a couple months later I tried to watch again and DVD did not work - center of disc discolored and cannot be read by any DVD Player. All my discs are properly stored - this one was obviously sub par disc or defective. I am just too disgusted to even return - plus time lapse of months. Just not worth my time. Will NEVER use this fulfillment house again. Just bad business.,1384819200,,490,4.157894736842105
4942960,4,B0063FQREO,"Of course the book was better and I agree that Jennifer Lawrence isn't really the actress that I would picture for an emaciated hunger stricken character, but she did a good job and it was fun as a fan of the book to see how they brought to life the fantasy world that the book describes.

4942963,4,B0063FQREO,"I loved the book, but the movie underwhelmed me in some ways. Certain moments that I thought were really powerful got edited out. Maybe they will show up in the second movie, but I doubt it. I also thought the costuming for the Capital folk was not as well done as it could have been. The acting was solid though, and I cannot WAIT to see the second one with the great additions they've made - Phillip Seymour Hoffman specifically.",1384819200,,431,4.4
4942964,4,B0063FQREO,"Pretty good adaptation of the book. In some ways it's almost better because of the way the book goes on with the, ""I say"", ""He says"" dialogue and in the movie you are spared that.",1384819200,,179,4.142857142857143

4942967,4,B0063FQREO,Good movie.  Definitley worth watching.  I highly recommend reading the book first.  It would fill in some of the pieces.,1384819200,,121,4.95

4942969,4,B0063FQREO,"Good movie. Love the books. I hate the PG13 of the movie though. It's shaky in the fight scenes which I hate. However, it's a good movie. I'm ready for the next one.",1384819200,,165,4.03030303030303

4942971,5,B0063FQREO,Ok.  The movie is just plain good.  But this was my first time watching a movie via Amazon's streaming service.  Easy.  Slick.  It worked better than I was expecting.  I'm so glad I finally signed up for Prime.,1384819200,,210,4.394736842105263

4942973,4,B0063FQREO,"If you liked the book, you will like the film. The book is better, in my opinion.
The movie follows the book fairly closely, but lacks the character detail of the book, which is unavoidable, I suppose. The only problem with reading the book first, then watching the movie, is that if you enjoy the movie, you cannot be sure how good the movie is as a standalone experience. But, in my opinion, reading the book first is always best.",1384819200,,432,4.4125

4942978,3,B0063FQREO,Without reading the series you may miss many of the nuances. The movie moved a little slow at times. I was surprised that the movie was as good as it was however.,1384732800,,162,4.09375
4942979,3,B0063FQREO,"I just don't ever find myself reading these novel-based movies (before or even after they come out). I came across The Hunger Games one day while browsing through my Prime account, and well the previews looked appealing so I thought Id give it a chance. The Greek based novel and plot of the movie seemed like excellent concepts, however, like many novel to movie stories much was lost in translation. From what I gather, if you haven't read the book then it makes sense why the film doesnt clearly develop Lawrences character and relationship to others in her district. Having said that, the movie is clear in establishing that there are 12 districts (each being known for one thing- Lawrences district is coal). Every year, each district sacrifices one male and female member between the ages of 12 and 18 to fight to the death until theres only one standing. Lawrence plays a quiet and skilled bowman with a bit of a rebellious streak; the movie follows her until the very end where the writers clearly leave a cliff hanger for the next sequel.
Pros:
The fashion and make-up is eye catching and captivating
The challenges presented are much like survivor
If you like multi angle shot action movies then you will enjoy this
There are some creative changes throughout the movie that give little twists in the plot

Cons:
The beginning does a crappy job of piecing together whats going on
Theres too little information explaining Lawrences relationship with others in her district
Character development isn't done very well (not sure if this was intentional or not)
As other reviewers have stated some of the characters actions just don't make sense

Bottom line, do not get your hopes up or have high expectations going into this movie! The acting is mediocre, the only thing that saved it for me was Lenny Kravitz and the creative direction theyve taken with costume, make-up and dcor. I hope the reviews from this movie heavily influenced the team on the sequel Catching FireAgain, no high hopes here.",1384732800,2,2004,4.8226744186046515

4942988,5,B0063FQREO,"Overall, the movie was pretty good. You got to see what the characters looked like in real life. I really liked the movie also because the moviemakers added some parts here and there. For example, ther is no rebellion in district 11 in the book, yet the movie shows district 11 rebeling after Rue dies.

I initially read the book because I couldn't understand how something with such a grim plot line could be so popular with kids.  I ended up reading and enjoying the entire series.  Although the Hunger Games movie does stay true to the book, it seems like certain things were added only because they appeared in the book and didn't really have a place in the film adaptation.

4943043,4,B0063FQREO,"The movie is excellent, but I will always prefer the book. A few key details were left out. I'm not sure how I feel about the intense close ups during fight scenes.

4943047,5,B0063FQREO,"I didn't think I would care for this flick, just based on all the hype.  I was wrong.  This is an excellent flick worth every penny.  I was absorbed into the story early, and the film kept me engaged if not riveted for much of the duration of the film.  One observation I will make is that the plot is vaguely reminiscent of the Arnold Schwarzenegger flick The Running Man.  However, while the Arnold flick (done relatively cheesily in comparison) was a parody with a multitude of tongue-in-cheek moments, the Hunger Games is quite serious, and offers a fascinating narrative.",1384300800,,576,4.72
4943048,5,B0063FQREO,"I had heard good things about the Hunger Games from my parents and had never gotten around to watching it.

4943056,5,B0063FQREO,It dealt with the themes in a sound and captivation way.....it was true to the story as portrayed in the medium of the book....the acting was very strong....it offered some surprises from the novel without being upsetting and that added to the story....,1384300800,,253,4.906976744186046
4943057,4,B0063FQREO,"This is definitely an above average movie with a future that I certainly would not want to live in. I will not rehash the plot as that is everywhere at this time. The acting was very good by pretty much everyone, particularly Woody Harrelson. The sets, from the ""Games"" field to the majestic and quite high-tech studio, were very well done with, IMO, well-edited cinematography. I have not read the book but am quite sure that much had to be left out due to time constraints. That said, what I believe to be the major points were made - especially that hope can, indeed, triumph, even in what appears to be the worst of circumstances. I would not really recommend this for kids under 13 or so, due to the content and nature of the ""Games."" To me, author Collins was able to successfully remake and retell, in a not-too-distant futuristic setting, the old Greek tale regarding war and tributes being sent annually to a capitol to meet their fate, while keeping the masses in line. However, then as in Hunger Games now, there are ways around even the most oppressive of leaders/governments - with a bit of cunning and intelligence, coupled with honor and determination ... and hope.",1384300800,,1180,4.650717703349282

4943060,5,B0063FQREO,"This is an action-packed movie.  It has some tender moments but the brutality between children (even teens) takes some emotion toll.  As long as my teens understand it is just fiction and we did discuss it, it is pretty good movie as action flicks go.",1384214400,,251,4.555555555555555

4943072,5,B0063FQREO,LOVE THIS Movie!!!!!  I read all three books and I have to say even though books being turned into movies is not always the greatest.

4943074,4,B0063FQREO,"I have not read the book, but I could tell that, like most book-to-film productions, this film was truncated to fit modern attention spans.  Having said that, now I intend to read the books.  Woody Harrelson was great, as usual; Donald Sutherland looks like Chief Hanlon but acts like President Kimball, for all the Fallout nerds out there, and the other actors did very well, what with the screenplay obviously cutting quite a bit out of Ms. Collins' original vision.  Still very enjoyable; I just put this on because I couldn't decide on anything else to watch while I ate dinner.  It was gripping enough for me to continue watching to the end.  I have a feeling that the book had a much deeper emotional impact, particularly re: Rue, her relationship to the people in district 11, the boy Katniss left behind, etc.  I would recommend this to anyone who is looking for something that goes a bit deeper than the mere sturm and drang of many movies these days.  I really think books like this should get a series on TV, just so that there is time for a clearer interpretation of the original story to be shown.  But, I have a day job, so the most I can commit to towards that end is a commentary on Amazon.com.  C'est la vie.",1383955200,,1225,4.457399103139013

I am disappointed that my once great peace-loving country, which entered wars after being attacked or honoring treaties with allies who had been attacked, is now starting wars under the guise of stopping communism or stopping terrorism, the results of which have been disastrous to our economy and to the deaths, injuries, and destruction they create without any significant gains.",1383782400,,508,5.059523809523809

Unfortunately, they had not. Well the movie isn't quite as flushed out as the book (what movie is?), it does stay fairly true to the original story and I thought the lead actress in a reasonably good job of making a character who was less than ideal into a reasonably likeable heroine.if you have some time to kill and can watch this for free this movie will fill the gap but I wouldn't spend any money for it.",1383782400,,692,4.095588235294118

4943115,4,B0063FQREO,Good Characters. Nice story. Left me wishing it was a little longer to flush out more of the possible story lines. Makes me think about reading the books.,1383523200,,154,4.535714285714286
4943116,5,B0063FQREO,This was a very exciting story with an excellent cast - not always the case today! All members of a family could enjoy this movie.,1383523200,,130,4.24
4943117,3,B0063FQREO,Good story although a bit predictable. Jennifer Lawrence played her role believably; a good action and romantic film at the same time.,1383523200,,134,5.136363636363637

4943122,4,B0063FQREO,Not as good as the book but still worth watching. Jennifer Lawrence is a convincing Katniss and Woody Harrelson is awesome.,1383523200,,123,4.904761904761905

4943130,4,B0063FQREO,Liked the movie. It reminds me of to much government involvement and how the people can make change happen. Take note.,1383523200,,118,4.666666666666667
4943131,5,B0063FQREO,"Love it, can't wait for #2! It is a little violent, and not quite the same as the book, but the entertainment value is great.",1383523200,,125,4.04
4943132,5,B0063FQREO,Great movie..havent been able to find it through my cable carrier. .was super excited to see it on prime. .thanks,1383523200,,113,4.7

4943134,5,B0063FQREO,"The book is always better than the movie and you simply can't compare the 2.  But this is by far the best book-turned-movie I've ever seen.  Putting the book aside, this was a moving, gripping, entertaining movie.  My husband, daughter and I loved it.",1383436800,,251,4.659090909090909

4943136,4,B0063FQREO,Great show. A little basic. More for a younger audience. A fairly simple story line. Good for young girls to watch,1383436800,,114,4.476190476190476
4943137,5,B0063FQREO,Loved this movie.  Finally got to see it and am in the process now of reading the book.  New sequel to movie coming out soon and will watch that when it comes out.  Loved the story line - very unique.,1383436800,,200,3.95
4943138,4,B0063FQREO,"If I hadn't read the books, I probably would have really enjoyed this movie. There were so many things left out or changed that it was disappointing. I found that I kept saying through the whole movie, ""That's not how that happened"", or ""That's wrong"".
When you read the books, you get the whole back story, why Katniss has the attitude she does or the relationship between her and Peeta. She's very naive and this movie doesn't give that impression. It's not just about Katniss learning to trust people, it's a trust and love that is being built between her and Peeta.
How do/did they plan to factor in that Peeta lost his leg? They didn't have anything alluding to that part of the book.
I was disappointed but it's still a good story.",1383436800,,737,4.507462686567164
4943139,4,B0063FQREO,"This film epitomizes today's life and death situations that ordinary people face. The choices we make all have life altering implications and ever so more, the true lesson here shows that violence breads more violence. Ultimately life is precious but as humans we can be so inhumane.",1383436800,,283,5.042553191489362
4943140,5,B0063FQREO,"An excellent movie with a horrid concept, to kill young adults while broadcasting the ""Games"" then sound a cannon when one is taken.",1383350400,,132,4.782608695652174
4943141,5,B0063FQREO,a perfect follow-up to the novel in my classroom. We can't wait to see the second movie next in late November!,1383350400,,110,4.285714285714286
4943142,4,B0063FQREO,"Great movie I really enjoyed it. The story plot was good, but some parts were a little far fetched. Overall loved it!",1383350400,,117,4.363636363636363
4943143,3,B0063FQREO,"interesting story.  so so directing.  felt like I was watching that reality show patterened after the movie.
Loved the costumes. blah, blah, blah",1383350400,,145,5.260869565217392
4943144,4,B0063FQREO,Jennifer Lawrence is wonderful in this movie -  she really stands out.  Stanley Tucci is also great.  The drama of the movie is very intense.,1383350400,,141,4.56
4943145,4,B0063FQREO,"Very good movie showing a stark contrast between good and evil, compassion and brutality. Excellent acting by Jennifer Lawrence and her co-stars.",1383350400,,145,5.636363636363637

4943147,5,B0063FQREO,I've watched it 4 times.  Exciting.  I have read the trilogy twice. The movie is quite close to the story line.,1383350400,,111,4.238095238095238
4943148,5,B0063FQREO,"The movie sync's perfectly with the book to bring this story about love to life. Jennifer Lawrence IS Katniss Everdeen, Gary Ross's vision creates a visual world that is both hypnotic and horrifying. I have watched this movie more times than I care to admit to yet I keep continue to be fascinated by it. As a fan of both science fiction and dystopian future genre's, for me, this movie ranks with the all time greats. Even thought the move is over 2 hours long the pacing keeps it moving so that there is never a dull moment or feels as if it is dragging. While some have expressed disappointment with the use of shaky cam I feel it was perfect for this movie. I can only hope the remaining 3 movies in the franchise are equal to the groundwork this film has laid.",1383350400,,765,4.319444444444445
4943149,5,B0063FQREO,I bought this as a Christmas present for someone. I really liked that I was able to watch it online free through Amazon while still keeping my gift wrapped for someone else. It was a gift that I got to use too!,1383350400,,210,4.023809523809524
4943150,4,B0063FQREO,A chilling story of futuristic oppression and young people's response to the new moral order. It often mirrors the excesses of ancient Rome. Action packed. Looking forward to watching the sequel.,1383264000,,195,5.32258064516129
4943151,4,B0063FQREO,"I am generally snooty about the quality of movies that earn two hours of my life. Every once in a while it is OK to have a fun romp just for the hell of it.

While the characters were painted with a broad brush, the plot twists strained my ability to suspend disbelieve, it was like the joy you get from the rare fattening desert you can't resist.

I thought Jennifer Lawrence was the perfect reluctant heroine.

So if you are one of the few people who has not seen this blockbuster. Go ahead. You can always cut back on the guilty pleasures next week.",1383264000,,552,4.238095238095238

4943158,5,B0063FQREO,"The movie was a previously viewed copy.  It had no flaws, and it played perfectly. When I saw trailers on TV my thought was that it was an implausable scenario.  After I was given the book trilogy as a gift, I finished the set in three days.  The movie follows the first book as well as a movie can, and I am looking forward to the sequels.",1383264000,,340,4.044776119402985
4943159,5,B0063FQREO,"Interesting story line! I appreciate that it is not a remake of an old movie or show. Acting was well done and the scenery was interesting. Plus, what movie with Donald Sutherland is a bad movie?",1383264000,,195,4.444444444444445
4943160,3,B0063FQREO,"I bought and read the book because my 12 year old daughter was told this is a good book for her grade. I watched the movie to confirm the book. The movie is OK entertainment for an adult, but in no way do I think this is appropriate for a twelve year old.",1383264000,,255,3.830188679245283
4943161,5,B0063FQREO,"This movie is amazing; I've never read the books, but the film made a fan out of me! It's interesting, gut-wrenching, and beautifully epic. Great performances, great visuals, and great directing!",1383264000,,195,5.32258064516129
4943162,5,B0063FQREO,I love this entire story!  It moves right along and keeps you interested! This dvd was an awesome buy and makes a great addition to anyone's movie library.,1383177600,,155,4.535714285714286

4943165,4,B0063FQREO,"I just finished watching The Hunger Games about a half an hour ago, so it is still fresh in my mind. It truly was, in my view anyway, a truly amazing film filled with beauty, tragedy, adventure, and hope all combined to create a masterpiece. And despite clearly being influenced by, among others, today's trashy reality tv, the film itself is not trashy or lowbrow at all, which in today's entertainment world, is a breath of fresh air. It stars Jennifer Lawrence as Katniss Everdeen and Josh Hutcherson as Peeta Mellark, both from District 12 in the post-apocalyptic dystopian society of Panem, located in futuristic North America. Every year in Panem, there is a slaughterfest in the form of a televised event called The Hunger Games which takes the form of two ""tributes"" from all 12 districts, which unlike the Capitol of Panem, are very poor and exploited. These tributes must then face off against each other against other tributes in a battle to the death during the annual Hunger Games, where there can be only one victor remaining alive out of the original 24. Katniss is a tough girl, having to live her entire life amongst squalor and poverty and because of this, she volunteers as tribute in place of her younger sister Primrose, who as it is made clear in the beginning scenes, is far less strong than her older sister. The first half of the film focuses on the tributes preparing for the hunger games and showing off their talents to the judges in hopes of winning their favor. And it is essentially this aspect of the film that prevents it from getting 5 stars from me, it takes too long to focus on the actual combat scenes, and was quite boring, but luckily, once the actual combat begins, the film really takes off and because very exciting and thrilling, as well as brutal and sad. I'll be the first to admit that some of the death scenes, for a PG-13 film, were quite disturbing and sad, especially considering that these are children getting killed, children who have grown up in poverty and never gotten the opportunity to see how wonderful and joyful life can be. And yet despite this, they still manage to have compassion and love for one another, especially the lovely, adorable girl Rue, who saves Katniss's life at one point. Of course, there are other kids who are much more bloodthirsty and violent, showing the other, darker side of humanity prevalent in us all. And it's not at all surprising that they're like this, considering the dystopian society that's all they've ever known. All in all, The Hunger Games is an amazing film that was spawned from what I understand to be a truly addicting novel written by Susan Collins. I'll definitely look forward to more films in this series.",1383177600,,2715,4.69392033542977
4943166,3,B0063FQREO,"I read parts of the 1st book on a flight years agao and sort of felt the same way, though I have to say the film was better than the movie, because it was less thinking and tlaking and focussed (relatively more) on the action.  Still there wasn't a ton of that, it really only started about half-way thru the film.  I probably won't watch the other films in this series unless I'm bored.",1383177600,,387,4.216216216216216
4943167,5,B0063FQREO,"Followed the book closely. Strongly encourage reading the book as it lets some insight into some parts of the movie that one may not catch onto. A little more visual brutality would have been nice, but as it is PG-13, it is understandable with what they had to work with. Loved the movie.",1383177600,,288,4.452830188679245
4943168,3,B0063FQREO,"This movie had quite an impact on our (American) cinema culture when it arrived. It is sort of generic and leans toward style over substance, just like our culture does. It is derivative, but most things are to some degree. There is little in the way of dialog, which really only hurts the movie in terms of attachment to the characters. Which is to say that there is little to none. The only thing that makes you root for the main character at all is that she volunteered to go in her sister's stead. Otherwise, there is little that  make one want her to live anymore than anyone else. So far as the others, are concerned, it is hard to begin to develop an opinion when there was no development of the characters. With that said, I will probably watch the sequel because, why not?",1383177600,,781,4.386206896551724

4943171,5,B0063FQREO,"This is a good movie whether you read the book or not.  I liked that they didn't glorify the violence.  Obviously, the book provides more background and character depth but the movie stands on its own and provides enough story to understand what's going on.  I look forward to reading and watching the second in the series.",1383177600,,323,4.631578947368421

4943174,5,B0063FQREO,This movie is fantastic.  Very true to the book..more so than book adaptations usually are in my opinion.  The intensity of the end fight scene is maybe lost a little on film...and hard to translate believably to film but all and all it works.  I love how this story makes you think about what you are capable of if you have no other choice and the questions of mortality it brings to the surface.  A very mind opening and humbling experience.  Intelligently done as a novel and the movie does a good job reflecting that.,1383091200,,521,4.442105263157894

I first saw it in theaters after just finishing the book for the second time--I thought it was great, but I was anticipating everything that was coming up. When I watched this version, it had been more than a year since I'd read the books, and I was still amazed at 1) how good it was, and 2) how well you could catch on if you didn't really know what the book was about (ie if you hadn't read it).",1383091200,,551,4.149532710280374

4943192,4,B0063FQREO,"Good high-level reflection of the book. Somewhat superficial and sloppy. Mostly action, little reflection. Woudl like to see actors talk more. Only several dialogs were selected for the movie. Many themes not covered at all (like living poor in District 12). On theother hand, it would need to be probably 3 hours just to cover all basics..",1382918400,,340,4.982456140350878

4943195,4,B0063FQREO,"It's a good movie. I think they caught a lot of the key details from the book in order to do a good enough job, but like most books-turned-movies, it misses a lot of what really draws you into the Hunger Games story. I think the thing that really made the books so enjoyable was all of Katniss' inner-monologue. They cut out all of that in the movie to save time. We don't get to really feel her desperation and struggle as much in the films and that took a lot out of it for me personally. Unfortunately, I imagine the 2nd and 3rd will be similar.

I have to give it a good rating though because evaluating it seperate from the book, it really is a good movie.

If you've never read the books and have no intention of doing so, I recommend it for sure. It's a solid movie with good action, susprense, and drama.

If you've read the book and want to see how the movie compares? Meeeeehhhh....might want to steer clear. That's a personal decision though. :)",1382918400,,956,4.2707182320441985

4943197,2,B0063FQREO,"The Hunger Games is a movie about the authoritarian rule of a corrupt government that sponsors an annual reality-TV death-match between innocent kids. Sounds horrific right? Repulsive? Inhuman? You'd think so. Yet the only horror here is that the film plays out like a shallow, run-of-the-mill Hollywood blockbuster complete with an obligatory love plot and green screens galore.

Seriously, talk about wasted potential. The source material is definitely there. The themes take nods from classics like George Orwell's 1984, William Golding's Lord of the Flies, and Kurt Vonnegut's Harrison Bergeron, laying the groundwork for a film that could've been a deep, disturbing philosophical examination of human nature and the dangers of government. I'm honestly upset that I didn't read the novel before seeing the film. In the hands of a capable and talented director, I truly feel that this story could've made for a fantastically effective, provocative film.

This is what ultimately makes the end result so frustrating to watch. It's basically like gearing up to lift an 800 lb dumbbell only to have your arms swing effortlessly upward as you realize the weights are made of Styrofoam. What should've been an excruciatingly weighty, stimulating affair ended up being about as heavy as a dollop of whipped cream, and just as sweet. And that is true hypocrisy of the film as well: we're supposed to be condemning of government and the characters that put on the Hunger Games, and yet the film itself falls into the same category of glamorizing and diluting what should be portrayed as an atrocity. The action is stylized, the grit and violence is subdued, the CG-sheen is blinding, and the love plot is ham-fisted. The true meat of this story, the implications of such a horrific form of entertainment and the underlying themes of how it could've come to be, are almost swept completely under the rug.

And don't get me wrong here. I'm not just condemning this movie because it wasn't what I thought it should've been. I love stylized action and I there's nothing wrong with an entertaining blockbuster. But the problem is this movie fails on that level as well. The action sequences are uninspired and just plain boring, which is probably a consequence of the fact that the movie never worked to make me emotionally invested. How can I possibly care about these kids fighting for their lives when 90% of them don't have more than four lines in the film and are portrayed as one-dimensional villains? To me, the majority of these characters were as expendable as they were to the citizens of the Capitol. They ended up feeling more like willing, eager participants than desperate, victimized innocents.

The bottom line here is a movie that could've been a deep, provocative, distrurbing look at human nature ending up being a shallow Hollywood affair that barely scratched the surface of the underlying themes of its source material. The movie simply felt as manufactured as the Hunger Games themselves, directly catering to the audience rather than challenging it. If you like your government-sponsored child death-matches sugarcoated and served with a large bag of buttery popcorn, by all means. If you're looking for a film willing to dig a little deeper, search elsewhere.",1382918400,,3274,5.057407407407408

4943206,3,B0063FQREO,"Like most movies today, if you haven't read the book beforehand you'll easily find yourself lost and wondering ""why?"" certain things happen, and why so many loose ends seem to be hanging out there.  The movie is entertaining in its own right, but for the best experience:  Read the BOOK",1382832000,,286,4.7
4943207,4,B0063FQREO,"I was going to write out a longer review, but I'll instead just list some things that could have been improved:

1. No chemistry between the two main district 12 team 'star crossed lovers.'  I realize that was part of a lie they made up to get sponsors, but what about the boyfriend left back at home?  I kept wanting to focus on Catness, but couldn't, because of the whole 'teammate' thing getting in the way of the plot.

2. Fully half the combatants perished in the first few minutes of the event - I was hoping to see each and every one picked off over a period of time.  Major let down for me, as I was relishing a much deeper tactical situation for all participants.  AND, we didn't get to see how they died (there was some tussling and knives, but it was over in a few seconds).

3. Took too long to get to the point.  The film was half over before the hunger games began.

4. No 'replays' shown from the point of view inside the city - the blue haired guy could have shown things from different angles for effect - ""now watch how district 8 takes out the last of district 6!""  - would have added a dark and eerie air to the film. I.E., the one time I *did* want to see the city point of view of the fight, we got nothing.

5. Despite Catness's accuracy with her bow, for her to to only shoot one person with it was a huge letdown.  She had at least three other opportunities to take out enemies with it, and she passed on them all.  Why? (and I realize she would never hurt Rue or her teammate- 3 other opportunities besides this)

6. For the judges to change the rules of the game at a moments notice, TWICE, damaged the plot and made the film less believable IMHO.

Despite all the above, the film was very well acted, the plot overall was very good, and the story original.  Certainly worth watching.",1382832000,,1811,4.190751445086705

In the story the world of the movie has people organized into districts and they select two from each district every year to compete with each other and fight to the death. It makes you think about if our society could be structured that way and makes you ask what you would do if you were selected for the games.

The book was written in such a way as to make it very ""movie friendly"" so the real question of success regards the acting.

4943237,4,B0063FQREO,"In anticipation for Catching Fire coming out next month me and my girls watched The Hunger Games. I have not read the books but I can say that this movie was an interesting action movie. I'm not a fan of violent films but my girls have read the books so I decided to watch the movie with them. I like the moral dilemma that Katniss faces in the story, she protects her sister, she refuses to kill the boy from her community and learns to survive. As young as Jennifer Lawrence is here I believe that she is going to have a great career ahead of her. This movie is not for younger children but my teenaged daughters loved it. If you want an entertaining movie that will immerse you into this well developed world I highly recommend this movie.

Good movie that kept me gripping my seat with anticipation. To be quite frank critics are like whiners they never seem to want to give credit to originality and the Hunger Games brought an original idea to create a dialogue that most WROL and apocalyptic preppers are constantly thinking about.

I'm looking forward to the sequel movie- the special effects in this first one were pretty good- it strayed a bit from the book but nevertheless I highly recommend it and the acting -excellent. There are some graphic scenes, though not comparable to ie, zombie genre- so no youngster viewers. AND it had a PLOT~",1382400000,,642,4.4033613445378155

Movies depicting children like this is so sickening i almost threw up watching this. Yes, I did see the beginning of one of the predating Japanese movies like this one until i felt sick, wanted to cry a little, and turned if off once I caught on to the plot.

If it was a documentary about child soldiers in Africa then I can see how one can sit down and watch children killing each other, but for sheer entertainment?

I don't understand how people watch this like it's okay. If anyone actually likes this movie, I strongly suggest they re-evaluate themselves.

Sincerely,
a concerned human being",1382227200,3,611,4.62962962962963

4943273,2,B0063FQREO,I found the film gruesome and depressing. I do not find it entertaining to watch a story where people kill other people for sport. This film reflects the culture of death in which we live in. I would not recommend this film.,1382227200,,224,4.357142857142857
4943274,3,B0063FQREO,It was OK.  I'm glad I was able to view it on Prime rather than go see it in the theater or buy the movie.  I think this movie is probably enjoyed more by a younger audience.,1382227200,,174,3.675675675675676
4943275,4,B0063FQREO,Very good. Glad it was a Prime movie. I know this has encouraged others to read the book to get more details of their challenges.,1382140800,,129,4.2
4943276,4,B0063FQREO,This provides some of the visuals for the books especially going forward. But books still provide more overall. Actors were well played. Looking forward to the next movie.,1382140800,,171,5.142857142857143

4943281,4,B0063FQREO,"I worked at a middle school at time I ordered this movie and had no time at the time I ordered this to read the book. After watching it, I did read the series. This movie came with no delays in great shape.",1382054400,,206,3.813953488372093

They got it right, and then some. Jennifer Lawrence is simply spectacular. She can say more with a facial expression than most actors can with 1,000 words. Woody Harrelson is surprisingly good as Haymitch, Katniss' mentor, and the rest of the cast is also very strong. While the movie sticks very close to the storyline of the book, it also makes a few improvements, such as taking us behind the scenes of the ""arena"" to show us the Gamemaker pulling strings, or letting us listen in on the conversations between the Seneca Crane and President Snow. Many memorable scenes, most of them involving Jennifer Lawrence. I'm looking forward to the next movie now.",1382054400,,869,4.918367346938775

4943287,3,B0063FQREO,"For me, all a movie needs to be is entertaining. The 'Hunger Games' was entertaining but not great. From the moment Katniss' sister was chosen you knew who was going to volunteer. You could also know that Peeta would be chosen, that he and Katniss would win, they would threaten to eat the poison berries, the rules of the game would be changed, etc., etc. Good role for Woody Harrelson, not so much for Donald Sutherland. Let me reiterate. I liked this movie and was entertained by it. However, it was more 'same ole -same ole' then 'broke new ground'.",1382054400,,553,4.54

I was not looking for everything from the book and could just enjoy the director's and actor's version of the story on screen. Not too much time was wasted on explaining everything. That is best left up to a book, or up to the viewer's imagination. It is an action, futuristic story done by very good actors in an interesting setting. It has just enough possibility to keep the audience grounded and enough fantasy to fire up your imagination. See it. and read the very popular book.",1381881600,,602,4.4324324324324325

The thought of young people hunting and killing each other was repulsive to me.  However, this movie demonstrated what could happen if a group of demented, power-hungry people gained the power to control everyone else's lives.  Absolute power corrupts absolutely.  This movie was all about sacrifice, love, hate and the fact that desperate people will do desperate things to stay alive.  I was very impressed by Jennifer Lawrence and her incredible portrayal of a young lady who held her family together and made the ultimate sacrifice to keep her sister alive.  I loved the ending when she and Josh refused to play by the rules and instead chose to play by their own rules.  They both lived or they both died.  I can't wait for the next installment.

Alas, this is the height of the entire tension of the film, and it comes far too soon. The third act fell short in terms of dramatic tension. Too bad the producers concentrated on creating a PG-13 product for their core demographic rather than an actual work of art which was worth watching.",1381449600,,420,4.613333333333333

4943340,4,B0063FQREO,I was skeptical about watching this as I did not know what it was about. After watching it...it interesting to me how there are districts and that each one has to sacrifice one of their own every year as a reminder that the districts are not in charge. I am going to have to read the book series.,1381276800,,296,4.120689655172414

4943346,3,B0063FQREO,Why on earth does a children's fight to the death story get such a world renowned following.  My friends all LOVE this movie.  I thought it was very well made and the acting and production quality was great.  Just a real cockamamie idea....,1381190400,,240,4.534883720930233
4943347,3,B0063FQREO,Too long for what it was. The buildup to the Hunger Games was too much and could have been trimmed back. Just expected more after hearing how great the book was.,1381190400,,161,4.225806451612903

4943351,3,B0063FQREO,"No it was not, and it never is, but I will say that they did an excellent job of keeping the movie as accurate as they could to the book.
I think that Peeta was miscast. He's not very handsome.  I like Donald Sutherland as the president, Cinna played by Lenny Kravitz is a good role for him, and Jennifer Lawrence does a pretty good job as Katniss.  The special effects work here, as it's tough to mix them with a post apocalyptic world.  It's hard to fit so much detail in so little time.  It was a good first attempt, so let's hope that Catching Fire does a much better job and doesn't have as much cheese.",1381104000,,608,4.127118644067797

4943354,2,B0063FQREO,Movie was stupid and the concept was disturbing to say the least. Poor kids killing other poor kids for the enjoyment of the rich. A socialist propaganda gone completely awry!,1381104000,,175,4.866666666666666

4943361,2,B0063FQREO,"After reading the book I was so excited to watch the movie. I was in for a disappointment.

Now, I know it is hard to translate a book into a two hour movie and retain all the same depth and detail. However, like previous reviewers have stated, this movie was cleaned up to be able to market to a wider PG-13 audience, which I'm sure brought in a lot of revenue but left me wanting more.",1381017600,,387,4.092105263157895

4943365,3,B0063FQREO,"When I first purchased this DVD, the disc did not work (so Amazon gladly replaced it, free of charge).  The movie itself is a decent film.  Although I have to say, you really have to read the books in order to fully understand what is happening in the film.  The film caters more to the fan base than to creating a fan base through the film.  The beginning of the film has very shaky camera movements, and although I do not mind this style of filming, it was almost too shaky and 'real'.  It was kind of distracting.  The relationships between the characters in the film were either rushed or non-existant (the books offer much more insight into the feelings and relationships between all of the characters).  Despite all that, it was a fun film to watch and a nice visual for fans of the books.",1381017600,,795,4.404109589041096

4943368,5,B0063FQREO,This is one of those books that makes you both love and hate the main character and then want to be like her. It melds science fiction with the wild wild west with political turmoil; frustrates and peaks the imagination. It is definitely a good read and will make you think about our own world and how the rich and the poor are so disparate.,1380931200,,341,4.2615384615384615
4943369,3,B0063FQREO,The movie covered all the essential parts of the book but lacked the book intensity.  I enjoyed the movie but it was not as good as the book.,1380931200,7,141,4.035714285714286

I am a huge fan of Jennifer Lawrence and think we are only seeing the tip of the iceberg when it comes to her work.  Love the cast.  Everyone fit in their part.

4943400,4,B0063FQREO,"I never have read the books, and heard a lot about the story.  But, I never knew the whole story surrounding the book.  All I thought about the movie or book was that each area has a pairing set out in area to fight to the death and whoever makes it the end get great wealth.  I did not know about the premise of what happens when you are chosen.  There are a lot of symbols that can come this movie that could view in our society.  At the end of the movie, society chose that love made it possible not wealth or education or survival of the fittest.  Love or respect of one another, I'm not sure what to really call it.  It wasn't about families battling each other, it was about little nations fighting each other.  They were educated in different ways that provided themselves survival in the Hunger games.  The sacrifice that the main character makes in this movie is uplifting and makes an interesting movie.

The quality of the movie was really good.  I didn't notice at first, the movie was in wide screen, so it had the black bars on the top and bottom.  Here what really bother me the most was that the player itself played the movie in widescreen and it had black bars on top and bottom.  I think the player did not let the movie filled the space well enough.  The reason I did not notice at first is because I am about a foot and half away from computer screen and the characters looked like OK to me.  I never noticed this on my PS3 when I was viewing.",1380672000,,1464,4.197132616487456

Nevertheless, it was a good movie and they seemed to spare no expense on the production.  The thought of humans hunting other humans was not appealing to me, but this was well done...given the subject matter.  They kept most of the grotesque stuff off the screen and leave it to your imagination what happened during the killings.
I will likely watch the sequel that comes to the theaters on November 22nd, but will wait until it comes out on Blu-ray before watching it.  I hate to spend money on a movie twice, so will wait and add this one in my collection.",1380499200,,718,4.288888888888889

4943416,5,B0063FQREO,"Lionsgate and Color Force present, The Hunger Games. Rated ""PG-13"". Widescreen
Running Time: 2 hours, 21 mins.

During the Reaping, one boy and one girl between the ages of 12 to 18 are chosen from their District. They must be delivered as a Tribute to the custody of The Capitol. Then they must go into the forest and Fight to the Death until only one child remains. This event is called The Hunger Games.
  This is not the Greek Summer Olympics of B.C. nor a boy scout Indian survival trip, but just as horrible as The Holocaust.
  A small 12-year old girl, Primrose Everdeen (Willow Shields) was chosen. She is very scared and upset. Her older sister, Katniss (Jennifer Lawrence), who is 16, gave her a mockingjay pin earlier for her protection. Katniss will not allow her sister to be the chosen one and she yells out that she will volunteer in place of her smaller sister. The mayor allows it.
  The boy chosen is Peeta Mellark (Josh Hucherson) who Katniss has met before.
Katniss is allowed to quickly say goodbye to her mother (Paula Malcomson) and  Primrose. Her sister gives her back the mockingjay pin now for her protection. Katniss also says goodbye to Gale (Liam Hemsworth), an older teenage boy whom she likes. He tells her to use her bow. She can hunt.
  The journey begins on a high speed rail train traveling at 200 mph to the Capitol.

4943418,4,B0063FQREO,"So, this story may have been done already (Battle Royale, anyone?) but it's different enough that I don't dislike it as much as I thought I would. It's hard to find a Hollywood movie without one appealing factor, though....probably because of all the money thrown every which way. Well...what else? It's a DVD. It works in a DVD player.",1380240000,,336,4.711864406779661

4943420,4,B0063FQREO,I was first told about Hunger games by my daughter and decided to watch the movie and really enjoyed it. Always been a science fiction fan. Since I have read all three books (available on Amazon Prime). Looking forward to the sequel.,1380240000,,233,4.571428571428571
4943421,5,B0063FQREO,"I'm a huge Hunger Games fan. Have been way before this movie came out, so when I heard they were making a movie of this, I actually got really scared. I know countless book to movie adaptations have miserably failed, and when I went to the midnight release for this, I had very low expectations. I walked out very happy overall, surprised at how good a job they did. Of course, there were some minor flaws in the movie (shaky cam, the ending coming to a abrupt halt), but overall it was an amazing job and an amazing film. The acting was amazing, Jennifer Lawrence, Stanley Tucci, Donald Sutherland, and Woody Harrelson all were A+++ performances. The rest of the cast was good too (oh! and Elizabeth Banks as Effie was perfect!). I could go on and on about The Hunger Games, but it would be like....a ten page paper hahahaha. Overall, I give this movie on a scale of 1-10 an 8.5 (yeah yeah, I know I gave it 5 stars, but since I can't give it 4.5/5 stars, I bumped it up :)

I can't wait for October 1st, as Catching Fire tickets come out!!! If your planning on going to see Catching Fire in theaters (hunger games sequel for those that don't know), I'd buy your tickets in advance!

4943434,2,B0063FQREO,"Why did the 100 + ""producers"" green-light the many ""directors"" to hire and assign scores of stylists or wardrobe folks to the weird, uninvited, unwelcomed, distracting enterprise of jazzing things up in terms of weird hair do's?

Sci Fi doesn't need:
Ahead of their time hair-do's,
Brit accents,
Alternative lifestyle tolerance sub plots,
Racism morality play underpinnings or overtones,
Does it?

Not hating. It just feels like an interruption to the story, a literary crutch, an artificially grafted patch --
like they do when they hire stand-up comedians to ""punch up"" occasional bland runs within the script with lame comic relief.

4943439,5,B0063FQREO,"After reading the book, I was eager to see the movie.  I wasn't disappointed.  The film follows the story quite well.  The special effects were wonderful, especially the ""Girl on Fire"" clothing.  The acting was terrific even with a largely unknown (at the time) cast.
And Jennifer Lawrence did go on to win an Academy Award.
This is basically a story about violence, but I felt it was handled very well.  I never even had to shut my eyes.  All in all, it was a good story well portrayed on film.",1380067200,,495,4.384615384615385
4943440,3,B0063FQREO,"I watched this after reading the books. I enjoyed the story the books told, but felt that the writing left much to be desired. It isn't just the genre - I have read intelligently written YA lit - but this is not that. So this is a movie based on a poorly written story with a rather annoying voice, but about an interesting idea/concept and one that bears looking into in both book and movie form.

I felt the movie was particularly lacking in its portrayal of the Capitol's citizens. It felt like the people who made the movie were almost afraid to portray them seriously as they were in the book because it might've been too much like Hollywood (on LSD...)? I'm not sure. But there was rich material to work with [in the book], and it was a missed opportunity.",1379980800,5,762,4.366197183098592

4943442,4,B0063FQREO,"Well produced and very good cinematography on board makes this film very good. The story has a good lead but a very prodictable ending. Part two will be a must see adventure, if for no other reason, the stars make the film.",1379980800,,223,4.333333333333333

4943445,3,B0063FQREO,Jennifer Lawrence does a great job in this movie and really gets into character.  She has a ton of emotion.  The story line of the movie is good but I think they left out really key elements of the book. But what did I expect? The movie is already plenty long enough so they had to make cuts.,1379980800,,292,4.017241379310345
4943446,5,B0063FQREO,This movie does justice to the book and the acting is great.  It's a good movie to revisit before the second Hunger Game is released in Novemaber.,1379894400,,146,4.407407407407407
4943447,4,B0063FQREO,"The Hunger Games is the start of another franchise of movies based a series of teen books.  However, I did not think the movie was that bad, but actually quite good.  I do not think it is as good as the Lord of the Rings films, Narnia films, or the Harry Potter films, but still fairly enjoyable.  Compared to the string of teen fantasy movies that have come out recently like Percy Jackson or Twilight this movie is god.

The story is pretty simple.  It takes place in the distant future.  There was once a big civil war which has left North America in ruins.  Instead of countries there now exists twelve districts.  Each year the capital of Panem forces either a boy or a girl from each district to compete in the Hunger Games where they all battle to the death.  From District 12 a girl named Katniss (Jennifer Lawrence) is chosen to compete along with her friend/love interest Gale (Liam Hemsworth).

People accuse this film of ripping of another film called Battle Royale.  Firstly I have not seen Battle Royale so I cannot say which film is better.  Secondly, I'm sure that Battle Royale was not the first of its kind either.  Everything is inspired by something.  There have been movies and TV shows that have come out after this that have a similar premise of people put somewhere and are forced to fight to the death.  For all anime fans out there, there is an anime that came out last year (the same year that the Hunger Games came out) called Btooom that has pretty much the same premise yet I do not see many people complaining that that show ripped-off Battle Royale.

Plus the film is still well structured, well, acted, and can be entertaining.  The characters are pretty solid.  I do like Katniss and it is easy to sympathize with her given the situation.  The stuff that she goes through is pretty scary and intense.  I can say that I would be dead in the first ten minutes if I was put in the Hunger Games.

The movie has some great effects, decent actions scenes, and an interesting world.  I cannot comment on the 3D because I only saw the film in 2D.  There is one complaint I have and that is the middle portion.  I found much of the middle of the film to be kind of boring.  The middle mostly focuses of the political aspect of this world and preparing Katniss for the games.

Overall, the Hunger Games was a pleasant surprise.  I did not expect much upon going to see it.  I basically saw it because my mother made me see it.  I have to admit it was much better than I thought it was going to be.  It was nothing incredible but it was still good.",1379894400,,2571,4.351578947368421

4943449,4,B0063FQREO,"Not the best book to film adaptation, but definitely not bad. The acting is fantastic, but the story is less than adequate. If you read the books first, you probably won't like it as much. But bear in mind that the books couldn't have been made into a PG-13 movie.",1379808000,,264,4.3

4943452,3,B0063FQREO,"I honestly don't get what all the hype is over this film. I'm talking about the film, not the books. Though I have not read any of them, I'm sure they are great. The general story line of the movie itself is interesting. Given the proper cast and directing vision it would be an original premise to bring to the audience, considering the recent push of horrible sequels and terrible remakes from Hollywood. Unfortunately, this movie lacks neither any depth, proper character development nor a director with a clear vision. It's a second tier film, with sub-par acting all around that is bolstered simply from its source material, the books themselves. I don't want to come across as a hater, but it's a shame considering many teenagers and young adults have clearly enjoyed the books, to have a studio serve up this Sunday afternoon snoozer as its live action adaptation of that material.",1379808000,,888,4.810457516339869

Yes there was some violence but in the context of what the movie was about, it didn't bother me too much.

Despite the oppressive conditions (or because of them), the young characters have become strong, brave, creative, and inspiring! They are beginning to rebel, getting fed up with their authoritarian state. They worked together and made progress. The movie was engaging and entertaining and leaves the viewer with hope for a positive future democratically created by a united people.

4943482,1,B0063FQREO,It's at best a movie for children. In general nothing makes sense. Waste of time. I really don't recommend it.,1379548800,5,110,4.55

4943485,4,B0063FQREO,"An engaging story of a future world supported by a great cast, especially Jennifer Lawrence, who plays the lead character, Catniss. Based on series of  popular young adult books, the movie provides great imagery in support of a well-written story.",1379548800,,247,5.175
4943486,4,B0063FQREO,"This was a fantastic movie but, as always, not as good as the book in my opinion.  Now it was no Harry Potter 4 fiasco when it comes to trueness in relation to the book- not much was skipped over at all but some of the characters acted a bit differently than they were portrayed in the novel.  I would recommend watching this without thinking about the book if you have read it.  Not to say that this movie is only for people who have read the books because it is even better to those who have not!  Jennifer Lawrence is a fantastic Actress, Oscar Winner, and all-around great woman who did a superb job in this film.  I enjoyed this movie even more the second time and third, so on and so forth.  It is one of those movies that is quite interesting to watch what is happening in the background because the costumes and settings are so thrilling!  The directing/camera work was done well and I would recommend this to anyone and everyone that likes a bit gory, slightly romcom, serious tale of a heroine showing drive to save her family.",1379462400,,1037,4.341968911917099

4943489,5,B0063FQREO,"When it comes to movie plots, this storyline is anything but a recycled story.

4943494,5,B0063FQREO,The Hunger Games movie is very similar to the book and done really well. I've seen it before and decided to watch it on Prime again :) even if you haven't read the book I would watch the movie.,1379462400,,193,3.9743589743589745

Don't be put off by the first 15 minutes or so.  I first thought the movie was too weird but then I really got into it.  No sex and little or no profanity.  Some violence but not overly graphic.  This movie is a sleeper--an unexpected gem of good entertainment.",1379030400,,414,4.575342465753424

But the identity, motivations, and complexity of the characters was utterly zero. I found myself rooting for the protagonist just because I knew that's who she was, but I couldn't care less about her two love interests, or her little sister, or anyone else, really.

I find myself wishing I had spared myself the two hours it took to see the movie, and just read the book (which other reviews state provides much more character development).",1378944000,,565,4.824742268041237

4943564,3,B0063FQREO,Entertaining..Some great scenes.  Some of it was a little theatrical and that is not a compliment.  Definitely not worth a trip to the theater.,1378771200,,143,4.916666666666667
4943565,5,B0063FQREO,"I was really impressed to see the Hunger Games movie! I had read all three books first, and I was suprised to see how well the first movie follows the first book! The movie was done so well, it was so interesting the whole time and even though it's over 2 hours it is so exciting that it goes by so fast. And I think the casting for all the characters are spot on also! Especially Katniss, Gale, Peeta, Rue, President Snow, just everyone!

I highly recommend this movie. And please read the book also, reading it first definitely helps and helps you appreciate and understand the movie well.",1378684800,,591,4.422018348623853

4943568,5,B0063FQREO,I did not go see this in the theater because I really just was not interested.  For some reason I decided to watch it on my Ipad & I was hooked.  Have watched it twice now & will probably do so again.  Great movie!,1378684800,,214,3.8181818181818183
4943569,5,B0063FQREO,VERY close to the book. They did a great job making it close to the book as possible. It's a great story and great action!,1378684800,,122,3.92

4943573,3,B0063FQREO,"Jennifer Lawrence was amazing as Katniss Everdeen, but the movie as a whole is a very weak sister to the incredible imagination and imagery the author brought to the novels.",1378598400,5,173,4.8
4943574,5,B0063FQREO,"Very good read!!!  It is a page turner for sure!  After reading this book, couldn't wait for the second one to come out so I could continue the sage of Katniss and Peeta.",1378598400,,170,4.121212121212121
4943575,1,B0063FQREO,"There was very little character development and NO on screen chemistry at all! I was very disappointed with the acting.
Then there's the problem with the cinematography!  Most of the motion/action scenes consist of extremely quick, choppy angle changes and very shaky filming.  I was getting a little nauseous and it didn't have anything to do with the children fighting.

And don't even get me started on the CGI!  I had this great image of the chariot scene and the burning costumes when I read the story, but the movie scene gave them two little candle-capes. So sad...
That being said, they did do a pretty good job creating the Capital.

The book is fantastic!  And aside from the usual details and side plots that are usually left out when a book is converted to film, the movie was still missing a lot!  Since half the book is a narration of Katniss' thoughts, her decision making, her fear, her confusion, even her love struggles were basically omitted in the movie.",1378598400,21,974,4.694117647058824

4943578,4,B0063FQREO,"Of course this movie is intriguing, just like the book. The only downfall is that the story line has children killing each other which is a bit grotesque.",1378512000,,154,4.535714285714286
4943579,5,B0063FQREO,Good movie with lots of twist and turns.  The story line. action and adventure were very good.  I would watch it again,1378512000,,118,4.318181818181818
4943580,4,B0063FQREO,"I have read many books turned movies, for example ""The Da Vinci Code"" and ""The Hunger Games"".  I chose these two to state the difference in keeping with the storyline of the book.  After reading The Hunger Gamer, I could not wait for movie... I wanted to see how it would turn out.  In my head, I had 5 key parts that were essential to the movie, and then subparts of that. I was not able to see it in the movies, so I had to wait for it to released on Blu-ray, so once released I watched it.  I think the director skimmed through the book, because it follows the book to point, but the KEY feature were mostly lies.  The biggest issue I had, was the PIN (the Mockingjay).  In the book, she did not find that PIN at the market.  It was given to her, prior to the start of games, When Madge came to bid Katniss farewell she offered it to her as a symbol of District 12 and made her promise to wear it in the arena.  That a crucial moment that was completely left out and misrepresented.  At least, The Da Vinci Code kept the story and script as one.  There was not much that they Changed.  But I was very Disappointed with the Hunger Games.  They really let down the readers of the book with this movie.  Hopefully, they do not make the same mistake with Catching Fire. Besides the fact it did not match the movie perfect, it was a great movie, if you did not read the book.",1378512000,,1373,4.097378277153558
4943581,5,B0063FQREO,I cant in my 52 years remember a story like this. It was a refreshing departure from the formulaic plots that are so prevalent these days. It was a dark story and one that made you think about how human nature remains the same over time and many changes. If you want to ponder some deeper philosophical musings on human nature then this is a flick for you.,1378512000,,356,4.25
4943582,3,B0063FQREO,The Hunger Games is pretty much a remake of The Running Man (1987) which starred Arnold Schwarzenegger. It would've been better if the rich cast did not wear those horrible 1700's costumes. I give it a three because it did keep me watching it somewhat. I only fast forwarded to the good parts.,1378512000,,293,4.547169811320755
4943583,4,B0063FQREO,"The movie was very well done. I read the book first and I noticed, like most movie from books, it was missing a lot of detailed things that was placed in the book. But as a whole I enjoyed the movie a lot. I seen it in theater and I ended up buying it on DVD/digital copy.",1378512000,,272,3.789473684210526

4943585,3,B0063FQREO,"I had never heard of this story before watching the movie; however, my wife has read the books and enjoyed them.  I was pleasantly surprised and actually enjoyed it. It's not a movie I would watch multiple times but I'm pretty picky about that.",1378512000,,244,4.545454545454546
4943586,5,B0063FQREO,"I usually think that movies made from books rather than screenplays are not as well done, but this was a very good adaptation of the book.  I would recommend it.",1378512000,,161,4.366666666666666
4943587,4,B0063FQREO,"This movie followed the book pretty good, it provided lots of excitement and lessons of what government can degenerate into with absolute control of its people.",1378512000,,160,5.1923076923076925

4943590,3,B0063FQREO,But not great either. Felt like Running Man with teenagers. I can see why 12 year olds love this movie.,1378512000,,103,4.2
4943591,3,B0063FQREO,Old storyline that's been used in many movies.  Not a very sensible movie when heroine who is supposed to be a whiz in the woods climbs a tree when being chased up a tree and thus provides herself no other escape route..lame. You can only suspend reality so much to make the pieces of the movie logical. Too easy to figure out what happens.,1378512000,,340,4.3125
4943592,4,B0063FQREO,Did not think I would like this type of movie so didn't go see it in the theater but since I could see it for free I tried it. Was surprised as it was a pretty good movie.,1378512000,,171,3.526315789473684
4943593,4,B0063FQREO,"While I liked the movie the story line seemed rather strange. A group of 24 teenagers are are drafted by the central government to put on a show - they must fight to the death. I guess they are paying back the state for the wrongs their ancestors are supposed to have committed. They all go along calmly without any protest except one young girl whose older sister volunteers to take her place. The story revolves around her and the other young man from her district. The government makes a huge pageant of the yearly event putting on parades and banquets. There are qualifying events to build popularity for the combatants in the hope of getting sponsors to send needed supplies from time to time. The fighting is supposed to continue until all but one is left alive and declared the winner. Alliances are formed, though temporary as there can be only one winner.

I have yet to rate a film in the SciFi/Fantasy genre above a 2/5. And this movie gets a 2/5. So if u like Sci-Fi and Star Trek type of movies/shows....then you will definitely LOVE this movie!....even if you don't like Sci-Fi / Fantasy type of movies....you won't be totally wasting your money by renting this movie.

4943646,4,B0063FQREO,"I've actually seen this before but I streamed it again to test my monitor. Great resolution.
I liked the film because they took the time to develop the background story as opposed to a cursory development and then a jump into too many action sequences.

i give this a 5 star rating because 1. i will buy this film  2. i will read the books 3. the action was great, the story was awesome and the actors in the film had me believing they were real.

4943658,4,B0063FQREO,"The movie gets off to somewhat of a rough start without any real character or plot development. It does recover towards the end. The story is unique but I'm sure the book was much better. There's just not enough time in this movie to tell the whole story.

4943661,4,B0063FQREO,"Very slow start but building characters / backgrounds is important for the remainder of the film. Once the 'hunting' starts, then there is enough action / drama to keep your attention.

4943663,4,B0063FQREO,"Although not as cinematic or moving as ""The Road"", the post-apocalypitic genre mixed with boy meets girl love story provides excellent entertainment value.

4943665,5,B0063FQREO,I loved Rue in this film so much it is painful to see her get hurt like she is. It makes me wonder if it is right to bring kids of that age into a book full of so much violence and poverty. But i see the struggle that the kids face in this movie as well as the book as very real. it reminds me that many people are without homes and food and in times past the government was asked to provide all of that to us. We must all remember not to take what we have for granted as the people in these districts 1 through 12 do not seem to do the people in the capital are selfish and out of touch with the real world. A true symbol of the division between the vary rich and the poor classes. is it fair that one must kill others that are so young to become wealthy like the rich in this book I wonder at the morals of the adults portrayed in this film i loved it over all a true master piece it is no wonder it got an academy award.,1377820800,,923,3.7384615384615385
4943666,3,B0063FQREO,"The premise is absurd. It ignores the truth about human psychology. Violence over indignation could not be quelled by a game.

4943668,5,B0063FQREO,Fantastic!  Can hardly wait until November when Catching Fire comes out!!!!  I enjoyed this almost as much as the Twilight saga.,1377820800,,128,5.0476190476190474
4943669,4,B0063FQREO,"I thought the book was underwritten, with a lot of missed opportunities for interesting plot points.  (What the heck was in that field, for instance?  That could have been something really cool but was never followed up.)  The movie left out those unfinished threads and was really well done.  The story was much more interesting visually, though the ending ""twist"" that wasn't really much of a twist still left a little to be desired.  However, I enjoyed it way more than I though I would.  Glad I didn't pay the big bucks to see it in the theater, but it's fine for rental.",1377820800,,575,4.533980582524272

The result is an ongoing and growing assault on individual liberty, state sovereignty, and the social compact. Levin argues that if we cherish our American heritage, it is time to embrace a constitutional revival.

The delegates to the 1787 Constitutional Convention in Philadelphia and the delegates to each state's ratification convention foresaw a time whendespite their best efforts to forestall itthe Federal government might breach the Constitution's limits and become oppressive.

I guess it's difficult to take a movie adaptation of a book and not make it look or sound scripted, but it was almost cheesy in this movie. Lawrence's emotions are a little forced in this movie and I think she does better in others. The effects and the environment was well-made and in some scenes I could believe that this world existed. Overall, not a bad movie, but it was too scripted for my tastes.",1377734400,,443,4.414634146341464

4943695,4,B0063FQREO,"This is a very dark play that pits victors against vanquished in the aftermath of an uprising against the central authority by the residents in the hinterlands. It could be about the consequences of a failed rebellion against autocratic federalism in any civil war, but there is added the continued retribution by the victors that creates a modern version of a Roman gladiatorial games set in a high-tech arena of death that selects by a lottery the contestants from the descendants of the rebellious provincial inhabitants. From abject poverty and slavery at the hand of a formerly equal political and social class, a male and female teenager is selected from each former rebel district to battle to the death for the entertainment of the political elite as a punishment and lesson against further resistance. That the young hero and heroine both survive, in a contest where the rule for over seventy years has been that only one contestant emerges from the arena alive, is offset by the senseless death of so many others. The events simply cry out for a sequel to topple the political regime and eliminate the carnage before the next annual games.",1377734400,,1149,4.897435897435898
4943696,1,B0063FQREO,"The Hunger Games movie would have been a great adaptation of the novel by Suzanne Collins if not for the excessive use of the hand-held ""shaky-cam"" technique. Why don't we call shaky cam for what it is? Vomit cam.

Maybe I'm just an old fogey and prefer the stable-cam cinematic style of True Blood. Is it too much to ask that I can see what's happening on screen and not just a blurry swoosh of color?

I'm not alone in these criticisms:

  The amount of dramatic shaky-cam in this movie is excessive. Multiple times I had to look away from the screen. The final fight, in particular, was almost impossible to follow. Shaky-cam + quick cuts + fast-paced fight scene + darkness = very hard to see.
  -- Panels on Pages

  The Hunger Shaky-Cam Games -- I have just returned from watching a film about an epic romantic triangle between a director, his editing suite, and the shaky-cam that he couldn't resist.
  -- Robyn Paterson

That last reviewer went on to make a comparison worth reading: ""It's a good technique in moderation, and like any spice can really bring out the flavour of the film it's used in. But, just like ginger or pepper, if you use too much of it, the receiver won't be able to taste anything except the spice in question.""

Exactly. While I don't object to the use of shaky cam per se -- I mean, it was an effective technique, like, once, in The Blair Witch Project -- it's just one tool in a director's tool belt and should not be used at the exclusion of all else.

Remember 300? Lots of gorgeous comic-booky scenes of Spartans flying through the air with their swords. But every single spear throw and sword swing was turned into a slow-motion shot. Every. Single. One. (Or at least, that's what it felt like.)

They're silly affectations by artistes. Gary Ross, director of The Hunger Games, admits as much in an interview:

Q:  Let's talk about the look of this movie. You employed a lot of shaky handheld, and there aren't a lot of wide shots. How did you come up with that approach?

A:  Well, I mean, I tried to do what the book did.

Oh, come on.

Q:  Because the book is told in the first person?

A:  Yeah, it's a very urgent first-person narrative. I tried to put you in Katniss's shoes the way [author] Suzanne Collins put you in Katniss's shoes. I wanted to take you through the world using this kind of serpentine tunnel vision that Katniss has. I want to destabilize you the way Suzanne has and I want you to experience the world through Katniss's eyes, and that requires a very subjective cinematic style, to be kind of urgently in her point of view, so that's why I shot it that way.

Let's see. That was effective, like, twice in the whole movie. Say, when Katniss rises up through the tunnel into the arena and is blinded by sunlight, and later when she is poisoned by genetically-engineered wasps. Those were the only two times when a point-of-view cam was arguably effective. The rest of the times, it was used to cover up possibly poor fight choreography (at least that's what I have to assume since I couldn't even see the damn fights through the smearing gloss of vomit cam) and a hundred other things. Maybe I should've taken a cue from my wife and just closed my eyes and listened.

What a tragedy that is, because The Hunger Games was otherwise a brilliantly executed movie. The writing was good (due, no doubt, to Suzanne Collins herself being one of the screenplay writers), the costuming was gorgeous, the acting was great, the makeup was great, the special effects were great. But it was ruined by a director who wanted to leave his tripod at home. What a shame.

To make an analogy, this goes back to a basic production value I have in my own prose writing. The reader should not be aware of the fact he is reading. Readers want to be transported away into their imaginations. To escape, just for a moment, the physical reality of their lives, to forget about the press of bodies around them on the subway, the screaming baby in the next room. So I strive to make my prose invisible. This means active sentence structure, an absence of flowery language, and simple to nonexistent dialogue tags. The cardinal sin is to step in front of the movie camera, so to speak, and wave at the reader, just to remind them that I am the artiste who created the thing they're trying to enjoy. And when movie directors are so enamored by their own power that they shake the hell out of the camera or slow down every fisticuff to 1/3000 speed, they're slamming their viewers back into harsh reality.

Movie watchers pay too much for their tickets to have to be subjected to that. Give them their escape, Mein director! Treat them with respect, and they'll do the same for you.",1377734400,9,4714,4.48711943793911

4943712,2,B0063FQREO,"It felt like they produced it as a TV series, then later decided to release it as a movie instead.  The story premise had potential, but was very poorly executed, resulting in a brain-dead viewing experience, with little character development/connection and lackluster acting from Lawrence and others. (Lenny's acting was the best in the movie)",1377561600,,344,5.254545454545455

4943721,3,B0063FQREO,The movie was okay and I did not read any of the books. Named actors helped give the movie credibility and Jennifer Lawrence was a breath of fresh air. The plot I took from the movie is how society/government controls our everyday lives and I thought the author tried to bring this out in a fanciful tale.,1377475200,,305,4.368421052631579

4943723,4,B0063FQREO,"The Hunger Games is not for everyone.  It is difficult to be entertained watching children forced to kill other children unless you are the kind of person who can let go of reality and just enjoy a movie ... NOT a documentary.  Once you are past that concept, this can be a very entertaining movie because it is full of surprises.  The concept is so unusual.  This country is separated into 12 Districts which are being ""punished"" every so often by choosing 2 children from each district, sending them into a restricted area and having them fight and kill each other until only one is alive.  (Now that I put it THAT way, it sounds much worse than it is.)  The acting is amazing to watch, the directing keeps it razor-sharp and the different culture keeps you guessing as to how anything will be handled!  This was the first movie out of three, and it is so good that I can't wait to see the others.",1377475200,,899,4.379518072289157

4943742,1,B0063FQREO,"This movie had more logistical and technical issues with the premise & storyline than an m.night shyamalan horror flick!
how anyone can rate this pathetic movie above 1 star is beyond me!
the writer, director & producers simply stuff a totally unrealistic, unorganized and half thought story down the viewers throat.
At no point during the movie is the viewer left with the notion ""well, this makes sense."" - even if you projected the story's reality with common sense logic, you are left scratching your head.
This movie will entice simple minded viewers who get caught up in cinematography, bright colors and grand delusions of living in a post apocalyptic society- however, any intelligent person who demands a logic-train relevant to the story's premise will quickly become anxious and annoyed.

so- they can heal sword cuts & 3rd degree burns overnight with special magical healing cream, they have levitating space craft and can instantly morph dozens of living breathing evil bulldogs from the dirt by clapping their hands on a table... but some evil dictator demands to take a male & female child from some family and make them fight to the death; pitting tiny little 11 yo girls against 18 yo trained killers in the same fight, just so no one forgets the way they evolved into their current ""districts"" and peaceful life? really?

only one out of 24 will survive the fight- each man & woman for their own... and they form alliances? what? why? there were so many perfect opportunities for each of them to kill the other- (5 of them falling asleep next to each other for example) and no one takes the shot? This is one of the stupidest movies I've ever watched- there's so many pathetic inconsistencies and holes in the story- it's insulting to the intelligent viewer!  people consider this babblewash movie 5 stars? it's absolutely comedic!",1377216000,5,1849,4.882165605095541

Its pretty well acted, too; and special effects are a bit fun in that weird ""Fifth-Element version of the future"" type way, coupled with (non-zombie) post-apocalyptic disparity that are both well portrayed.

If you're older and an experienced movie-watcher, it's more likely to be a slow couple of hours watching teenage actors try to learn their profession.  The adult roles other than Donald Sutherland's are cartoon caricatures - and Sutherland just earned a quick buck acting like the older Sutherland you come across so often now in his later years.  My recommendation:  rent something else in the futurist genre.",1377129600,,520,5.011627906976744

Jennifer Lawrence was amazing and completely believeable as the heroine. She is tough, yet pretty.  Stanley Tucci was superb in his role as well.

I think the plot line is fascinating, although sad. The plot could fortell what the future citizens of the USA may encounter at some point due to an overly  large and out of control government who has to subdue its peoples in order to have control over them.
The starkness of the wealth and lavish lifestyle  of the people of the ""Capital"" verses  the ""regular"" people who live in poverty,  in run down homes and basically starve, having few comforts, is quite eye opening.

I recommend the movie, it is both oddly entertaining and yet scary as to what the future could hold.",1377043200,,918,4.475903614457831

For the most part, everything in the movie is about what I'd pictured in the books: the main actors, the cities, the outrageous makeup... Come to think of it, I'm racking my brain trying to remember what didn't match.

It's interesting because the books were released under the 'young adult' category. However, if you look beyond the obvious boy-girl story, the dystopian, hardship tilt is perfectly fitted to adult interests.",1377043200,,669,4.758620689655173

Unfortunately, the youngster, Liam Hemsworth, chosen as her partner is a horrible actor.  He is inexpressive and completely unconvinced as someone who is in danger of dying at any minute. The movie is far too long for no good reason. There are too many instances on which to watch it becomes chore. It could have been a much better movie with a duration of 90 minutes instead of  143 minutes.",1376956800,,526,4.706521739130435

As for quality, I have slow internet at my house so whether watching from my computer or kindle there were delays. Had it not been for my internet, the quality would have been outstanding watching through amazon prime.",1376956800,,413,4.294871794871795

The movie gives you a visual of the book.  If you have not read the book, you should, the movie cannot portray all that happened in the book, because there was a lot of thoughts that were running thru katniss and this wasn't able to be portrayed.

4943795,3,B0063FQREO,"after all the good vibes about this movie being midieval, l found this movie unsettling regarding our present and future. what are the possibilities of mankind  concluding to this type of society in the future? in the present, we live in a society where we see our standard of living being compromise by the fortune of GDP that widens the gap between the rich, the middleclass and the poor....greed breed fat cats, power, narcissism and ultimately slavery....who said history does not repeat!!!",1376870400,,494,5.024390243902439
4943796,5,B0063FQREO,"Few narratives are tougher to stomach than this one: children being forced to kill other children. And yet, this premise is absolutely believable, given the violent wars being waged in Africa and the Middle East, and the nuclear arms race that continues to gather steam.  This is an entirely possible apocalypse, and one we must acknowledge if we hope to avoid it.

This movie presents its subject beautifully; hauntingly so. Katniss is a heroine you simply have to meet.",1376870400,,471,4.949367088607595

The movie itself, except for the basic idea of children fighting to the death, is a very clean movie. No bad language, no gore, no real bloody fight scenes. It has some very touching moments of romance and love to family. I recommend this movie to all audiences, just do not let the concept of kids in an arena fighting to the death bother you.",1376784000,,482,4.426966292134831

I agree with some of the other reviewers who mentioned that the action, blood and desperation were whitewashed a little too much. It was hard to believe that this really took everything the tributes had--every time they ran or did anything, it was as though they had brand new energy and some soap. But other than that, a moving and very engaging movie. Can't wait to see the next one--and I will probably go read the book!",1376697600,,570,4.653465346534653

I decided to take a chance on Hunger Games (plus it was free $$$) and I was really surprised! I had very low expectations when I sat down to watch and as the movie continued I found myself very caught up in the storyline. It is sort of quirky but a fun ride nonetheless. I now see why Jennifer Lawrence is in such demand. Great supporting cast as well. There was no over-the-top bloodshed nor any nudity/sex scenes. Easy to watch flick!,1376697600,,582,4.15929203539823
4943827,5,B0063FQREO,"Hands down one of my favorite movies. Such a great story for many reasons. First of all, the suspense is so heavy all the way through, and Jennifer Lawrence does an awesome job portraying that. Secondly, it is such a great satire about society.

This movie is about Katniss Everdeen who volunteers as tribute for her little sister, Prim during the reaping of the 74th annual Hunger Games. In Panem, tributes are chosen from children between the ages of 12 and 18. During the reaping, one girl's and one boy's name is drawn from each of the 12 districts to go into the arena to battle to the death. 24 tributes enter the arena and a lone tribute emerges as the victor. This movie tells Katniss' story of survival during the games.

4943851,3,B0063FQREO,Perhaps the book would have been helpful but the scenes and the acting came up short. What was a disappointment was that everyone was obviously trying so hard but then that should not be so. Jennifer Lawrence and Woody Harrelson were very good but the rest was like a Tim Burton clone attempt.,1376524800,,293,4.547169811320755

Although I never read the books, I found myself rooting for characters, hating others, and crying over deaths.  According to friends who've both read the books and seen the movies, the crew did an excellent job at capturing the essence of the original stories in slightly less than two and a half hours.  I love it, I'll watch it again, probably buy it, you should watch it too!  It's a real check to see if you're human and have emotions.",1376438400,,574,4.533980582524272

4943856,3,B0063FQREO,"Technically, the movie was well done: good cinematography; plenty of special effects, polished actors, with a story based on a futuristic theme.  However, I don't enjoy movies that depend heavily on special effects. The futuristic plot depicts an advanced society  with high level technology that still behaves like the ancient Roman society where blood and gore is seen as entertainment. But then, that also seems to be true of our current culture; if it were not so, movies like this would not be made. I guess violence and sex always sells.  Not that there are any explicit sexual scenes; only a shallow attempt at romance which makes it suitable for younger audiences.  There is no objection to exposing children to violence as any Saturday morning TV cartoon viewing will reveal.

As far as entertaining, yes, it kept my attention.  I am sure we will see Jennifer Lawrence again and most likely, A Hunger Games sequel.  Worth watching but it does not leave you feeling that there was a message here other than the future will be much like the past.  I was hoping that the human spirit and consciousness would evolve at the same rate as its technology.  Apparently, the makers of this film chose to predict that humans will retain their depraved nature even when they are high-tech.",1376438400,,1286,4.835616438356165

Jennifer Lawrence is great in her role as Katniss, who learns that  ""playing the game"", isn't just about shooting straight, but navigating the emotional and political paths as well.
It is a dark film, with no specific memorable catch lines uttered by the heroine.

Pretty faces a few special effects and Hollywood calls it a movie.  I have no idea why this is getting high ratings.  Maybe its a bunch of pre-teens that got in without a guardian.

4943932,2,B0063FQREO,"Before I being my review, I want it to be said I did not buy this movie from Amazon but from a store and also saw it in theaters.  With that being said I looked forward to seeing this movie after having read the book and was sorely, sorely disappointed.  There are so many things this movie missed or could have done better.  First, the editing was not well executed.  It looked choppy and felt forced.  Second, the chemistry between Lawerence and Hutchinson was non-existent and forced.  If you've read the book you know why the lack of chemistry is a problem.  Thirdly, the mockingjay pin really bugs me.  The way they did it takes away from the story and doesn't add to it.  There is so much more back story to the pin with Madge than without and the fact they completely left it out bothers me.  Finally, and I can't really blame this on the director but you never get to know what was really going on in Katniss' head.  The movie makes her look like a perfect hero when in reality her morality is questionable.  If you've read the book you know what I am talking about.  Also, you understand from her inner battles and personality why she ends up with who she ends up with at the end of the series.  All in all the movie was a bust and failed to hit on what were key points.  Hopefully with a new director in tow things will be better.  Despite my qualms with this movie I will see the next one with the hope that it will be better and do the movie justice.",1375920000,,1462,4.205035971223022
4943933,3,B0063FQREO,"I liked this movie.  I loved the book.  While the movie parallels the book, and doesn't leave anything out, the book is told from Katniss' point of view, whereas the movie is told from an onlookers perspective.  This takes away from the movie, somewhat, as in the movie you don't know what is going on, the inner torment that Katniss is dealing with, regarding Peeta, killing in the Games, Prim, Gale, and her father...

4943950,5,B0063FQREO,I'm a guy... and I loved this movie. I say that because I thought this was going to be a Twilight-like movie that has the girls all crazy about vampires but boy was I wrong! This was a fun movie! I know a lot of people compare it to an Asian film with a similar plot (the name escapes me at the moment) but let me tell you that I have seen both and although they are similar... They are very different movies in terms of style and themes. So don't let that stop you from watching this film!,1375660800,,490,3.95959595959596

This is a book that is extremely difficult to put down, once you start reading it. We had to see the film version and we did!  We just had to purchase the DVD - it was a must!  We are now anxiously awaiting the second book to come to life on the big screen in November of this year.  After we see it, we will undoubtedly purchase the DVD.

4943960,4,B0063FQREO,Wasn't a fan of the trilogy but its quite good and I'm interested in seeing the next one. I thought it would be bloody or sad because of the children dying theme but it was edited well and you don't get that feeling from it. Jennifer Lawrence really is an exceptional actress. The movie would've been lame if she wasn't so good at bringing you into the story.,1375660800,,359,4.294117647058823

excitement and by the end of the Hunger Games you are in a mix of emotions.  I was
torn between wanting Peeta & Catnis to stay together yet sad because if they did then Gale
would be hurt because he loves Catnis.

Even though I read Catching Fire and MockingJay and know how the series ends I really can't
wait for the movies to come out.  Jennifer Lawrence is so good in her character this will surely
become a movie classic",1375660800,,514,4.224489795918367

4943974,5,B0063FQREO,"Although the young actors are not polished, I love this series and read the books. What you are witnessing when you watch the Hunger Games, is what the USA could end up being like if we are not vigilant. I think the eccentric costumes and emphasis on make-up, hair, excessive luxury and fashion make a revealing statement about what we deem important even now and how do we get those things. Don't we even now still buy our clothing made in sweat shops overseas? Notice the poverty of the districts and then the overwhelming glamour of the ""Capital"" and the gluttony of its inhabitants. Notice also the extent of the cruelty of this ""game"" which is obviously a sick spin on the Olympics combined with a deliberate political agenda to keep the inhabitants of the outlying districts in fear and submission by forcing them to sacrifice their children annually in this cruel form of revenge for the past uprising. With our nation in 2013 constantly being controlled by the media (and big biz/government that controls them) to fan the flames of racial hatred and gun control as a tool to attempt to provoke its citizens to rise up starting a second civil war so that our government which has long been planning to turn our own military on us would then have an excuse to do so and strip us of all our freedoms to satisfy the agenda of the elite to unite the entire world under one government. That is why the UN is screaming for US citizens to be unarmed. That is why China too is openly demanding we be disarmed. This is why we suddenly see shootings with shady ""prior"" CIA Dr.s involved in the backgrounds and ""treatment"" of the shooters who are young people on medications for depression that the drug manufacturers KNOW cause young people to become suicidal and murderous yet their medications and previous treatments are never shown on the news because everyone with a young male in public school who is being drugged just to get through the female biased public schools would pull their kid off it immediately. This is why there are supposedly ""mock"" emergency drills at each and every disaster location starting with 9/11. We are being herded toward the elite agenda for total world domination. Apparently they aren't rich and powerful enough. Pay close attention to this movie and what is going on right now in our world. Read the books and watch the movies. Research the lies our government tells us all the time. Released government documents despite the editing are beginning to tell the real stories. Look at the information leaked by our military personnel. The elite will do anything to get what they want and if you look at who finances every war you will know exactly who the heads are. Our government and politicians are taking orders from them. We do not run our country. If we aren't careful...we could easily end up like these characters living in outlying micromanaged and military controlled slave towns.",1375574400,,2921,4.729411764705882

4943979,4,B0063FQREO,hopelessly sentimental.  I didn't read the book (and am not likely to) so I don't know how true to the author's vision this movie was.  It was obviously designed with the sequels in mind.,1375574400,,187,4.470588235294118

4943983,4,B0063FQREO,"I wanted to see this film after seeing the trailer on telly. That's not usually reason enough, but it seemed to have crept into my subconscious... The film is well acted, well directed, and based on a popular and well conceived novel, so far as I can make out. There are two things that elevate the film from this to four star status.

The first is the production design. The dystopian future is realised as a cross between Nazi Germany and renaissance France. The social divisions are drawn in a way that makes the central theme - the hunger games themselves - both more believable and more frightening.

This brings us on to the second thing. The whole idea of the games, the inevitability, the ruthlessness, the horror, comes through in a way that creates a pervading sense of dread. It's not a horror film per se, but the idea of being part of a society both so venal and so callous, is somehow more horrifying than masked slashers or killer aliens etc.

A clever, absorbing film that lingers in the memory.",1375574400,,1011,4.543956043956044
4943984,3,B0063FQREO,"I thought this was a decent, but predictable movie. Never read the books, but just was expecting a little more for the time I spent watching, but I guess I've watched worse, so what can you do?",1375488000,,193,4.243243243243243
4943985,5,B0063FQREO,"I bought Hunger Games 2-Disc Blu-ray +Ultra Violet Digital copy with 16x9 wide wide screen 2.40:1 format for $12! I thought, that it was a very nice deal, considering that HG is less than an year old movie! Jennifer Lawrence and Hutcherson's  performances are commendable. J Law clearly stole the show with her gritty persona as Katnis Everdeen. Even though the movie looks like a mega reality show involving blood bath, the movie went by the book mostly and did justice.

The special features disc is loaded with many special features, which include the making of HG, interviews with Gary Ross and Elvis Mitchell are entertaining.

Given the ambiguity surrounding the Ultra Violet way of cloud storage of movies, with all the negative feedback online, I chose to pick the Digital copy. Redeeming the code was a piece of cake. I have not yet downloaded my copy on to my laptop though, due to space constraints. Overall, I am very happy with the deal and I strongly feel, that it was my money's worth. Yes, I would certainly recommend it to my friends!",1375488000,,1051,4.73224043715847

4943987,3,B0063FQREO,The movie is worth watching and was well done; however it doesn't compare to the book.  I guess the problem with movies is that it is hard to capture all the detail you get in a book.  Read the book because there is so much left out in the movie.  If you didn't read the book first you would probably not really understand half of what was going on in the movie.  By the way I didn't realize this at first but this is a trilogy - a total of 3 books.,1375488000,,449,3.847826086956522
4943988,4,B0063FQREO,"I was shocked to find myself glued to the movie almost upon the moment that it started. It never looked as interesting to me as all the hype about it insinuated it was. I was wrong. The books are now on my to read list, which I'm sure are better than the movie (but books almost always are, right?) I found the characters interesting, and the story line was more gripping than I expected it to be. I would have liked more history about this post uprising dictatorship they appear to be living in, but you can only put so much in a movie.

I'd love to live in a society where they have medicines which can apparently heal extreme wounds overnight but they entertain themselves in such a barbaric fashion.  That didn't bother me though.

I was glad I waited so long after reading The Hunger Games because all the details of the novel were not fresh in my mind and as a result, I found myself enjoying the movie instead of picking it apart.

4944015,4,B0063FQREO,"First off, I am not into a lot of tween/teen movies based on books. I never read or saw Twilight, and only saw the first 2 Harry Potter movies.  My 11yr old daughter read the hunger games books and I was the only one in the family willing to go see this with her.  It was a good movie.  If you know anything about the story, it is certainly a weird one, but it translated into a movie well enough.  Some of the themes are a little mature for kids, (teens hunting and killing kids as entertainment), but it was not a graphic movie at all.  The violence was kept off screen for the most part.  As for the DVD, it was high quality, worked and had a fair amount of features.  I look forward to seeing the sequal to the movie with my daughter.

I also thought that most of the plot twists were forced and contrived (e.g., the fireballs;  the sudden creation of the terror-dogs; etc.).  In addition, there was little to no chemistry between the female and male leads -- they just were not a good fit.  I don't know how many ways a movie can be messed up, but HG has got to be a classic of how not to make a movie in any film-making school.

Some of my favorite small ideas and scenes from the book did not make the movie (but that is often the case; there's just not time).

After realizing that I had already paid for a year of Amazon Prime, I decided to put to use the feature of free instant movies on Amazon's list of available movies. At first I was hesitant about watching the hunger games because I had created a prejudice against it thinking it was too similar to twilight or Harry potter which are two movie series that I deeply despise. However, I decided to give the hunger games a chance, and it far exceeded my expectations. It starts off slowly but it leaves you wanting more and this is why I continued watching.

Lumber, power, luxury, masonry, cattle, fishing, etc. And the Capitol (not part of the districts) takes 2 kids from each district.

4944118,3,B0063FQREO,"If you don't mind seeing children getting hacked up, stung to death by wasps or just plain mutilating each other than this movie is for you.  Why did I give it 3 stars (It's okay)?

The film is predictable as I wrote in the subject line.  However, at least it's not another vampire movie.  The story line is consistent  and nothing was left that didn't make sense.  Of course the sequel is supposed to be out at the end of this year or the beginning of next. Though it has clearly ended with a setup for the next movie in the series it could still have been a stand-alone movie and the ending makes sense without having to see the next one.

It was worth seeing once.  If for nothing else, to see if the characters were believable.  A few of the adult characters were a little strange but their characters were supposed to be that way. The child and teenage actors were by far the best and seemed most real.  The writing is mediocre but the young actors still managed to bring some life (...and death) to the parts.

The movie is clearly intended to appeal to an audience under 20 years old; like the vampire movies.  And it succeeds in doing that.  I've never read the books that this was adapted from so I can't give a comparison.  Actually, I wasn't even tempted to read them.  Unlike the Harry Potter series where I read each of the books before seeing the movie.  And while they didn't follow the books exactly, they story line was close enough to the books that even without reading the books they would have connected to each other and made sense.  Let's hope the next Hunger Games movie can do the same; to pick up logically where this first one left off.

I don't care what contrived ""deep meaning"" there is to this story, it is still a story where children kill other children for the entertainment of the movie-going audience. Disgusting! Is there any wonder we have children killing children in schools across America. Dean Kamen, founder of the US high school robotics competitions, once addressed the national championship games at Disneyworld. He said to this effect: ""There are more than six thousand high school students and their engineer mentors here today participating in these engineering games. There is NOT ONE, NOT A SINGLE member of the press covering this event. They are all at Columbine High School."" [For those of you too young to know the connection, two students murdered 12 other classmates and a teacher.]Then he said something I will never forget: ""YOU GET WHAT YOU CELEBRATE."" You get what you celebrate. I use this now so often to help understand otherwise inexplicable behavior.

4944153,2,B0063FQREO,"The Hunger Games (Gary Ross, 2012)

Terence Malick's desecration of James Jones' greatest novel, The Thin Red Line, sits at #4 on my list of the one hundred worst movies of all time. While the catalog of faults there are to be found with the film is approximately the length of the average encyclopedia, there's one glaring problem with the thing that always stands out in my head: it ends halfway through the book. Well, almost. That truncated speech George Clooney shows up to give five minutes before the end of the movie? That is the exact halfway point of the novel. They compressed the entire second half of a six-hundred-plus page novel into five minutes of screen time. Now, given that, what do you expect I'm going to say about The Hunger Games? I grant you, the compression wasn't that drastic, but you're talking about a movie that runs over two hours (and, it should be noted--this may be considered a spoiler alert, but I don't give a damn--the last eight minutes of the movie are credits. Eight minutes of end credits.), and Katniss and Peeta don't find that cave until there's less than forty minutes of movie left (and eight minutes of that are end credits)? Doubleyou-tee-eff, Gary Ross and Suzanne Collins?

For this paragraph, you can simply cut and paste everything I wrote in my review of the novel re: how similar it is to Battle Royale, though the movie highlighted a key point in the difference between the two I hadn't really considered before: one of the reasons Takami Koshoun's book is so successful at what it does is the razor-sharp satire. The film adaptation of it, while not nearly as successful as the book, takes the satire and jacks it up a few notches, to the point where portions of the movie are flat-out comedy. (That first scene in the abandoned classroom? That's an exercise in tension in the book. In the movie, it's comedy gold--it's the movie's best scene.) Collins' novel certainly has satirical qualities, but she traded most of the satire to go the dystopian-fiction route. This is neither a surprise, in today's YA literary culture, nor necessarily a bad thing; I thought it worked well in the novel. In this adaptation, by comparison, all of the satire has been leached out. This thing is serious as a heart attack. Even Haymitch is clean and well-coiffed throughout, which is kinda ridiculous if you're the town drunk. And the dead-flat seriousness serves to highlight the superiority of BR. This is SENSITIVE DYSTOPIAN FICTION DAMMIT, PAY ATTENTION. Oh, for the love of pete. Give it a rest. If you don't know people are watching this movie for the sheer joy of watching teenagers beat on one another, you've kind of missed the entire point.

I'm blaming that one solely on Collins, because Ross, once he got behind the camera and started directing this silly thing, obviously did not forget that, and as a result the movie's main strengths are its action sequences. This is not necessarily a surprise (Seabiscuit, anyone?). That first scene at the Cornucopia... but I'm getting ahead of myself.

NOTE: the plot summary may be construed to contain spoilers based on how the novel unfolds, but they were things mentioned up front in the movie (I am assuming the script was written based on ""everyone who's going to go see this already read the book, so...""); if you have done neither, you may want to do one or the other before reading and/or skip the next paragraph.

Plot: Panem is a post-apocalyptic America that, since an uprising almost seventy-five years ago, has been separated into twelve districts. The higher the number, the poorer the district. Katniss Everdeen (Winter's Bone's Jennifer Lawrence) lives with the remains of her family in District 12 (in modern-day America, this is the rural Appalachians), whose main function in Panem is the mining of coal. Katniss' father was a coal miner; he died in an industrial accident years before the opening of the film, which sent her mother (Tombstone's Paula Malcomson) spiralling into a depression from which she has never emerged, leaving Katniss and her younger sister Primrose (Beyond the Blackboard's Willow Shields, whom I believe has the distinction of being the first actor I have ever named in a review to have been born in the 2000s) to care for her. Katniss makes her living as a hunter beyond the bounds of the District. It's forbidden, and if she and her hunting partner Gale (Knowing's Liam Hemsworth) ever get caught they'll be in dutch, but no one who actually lives there cares; Katniss is well-known for being willing to barter her excess meat, and in fact the town's mayor is one of her best customers. All of which is minor details, really, as Panem, every year, holds the Hunger Games, a countrywide battle royale to which each district sends one male and one female according to a lottery with a complex system of entries. To make a long story short (the movie sure did), Primrose is chosen, and Katniss volunteers in her place. Peeta Mellark (Bridge to Terabithia's Josh Hutcherson) (and I don't have a copy of the book close to hand, but I swear that last name was spelled ""Malark"" in the book) is her male counterpart, and the two of them are whisked off to District One, the capital city. (In the book, it is obvious this is in the Rocky Mountains; I always assumed it was Denver, for some reason.) They're being coached, somewhat, by Haymitch (Now You See Me's Woody Harrelson), the last person from District 12 to win the Hunger Games, and now the town roustabout. He doesn't often come up with good advice, but the two of them learn quickly that when he does, it's very wise to heed. For soon, they and twenty-two other teenagers are going to be sent into a coliseum, and only one can emerge alive.

...and thus, back to the action sequences. The entire second half of the movie, really, is one long action sequence with a few lulls, but there are a few pieces that really stick out. The opening sequence at the Cornucopia I mentioned up top may actually be the best scene in the movie, though Ross, unsurprisingly, glosses and soft-focuses a good deal of the violence therein; The Hunger Games was mandated as PG-13 rather than the hard-R of Battle Royale (or, more amusingly, 2010's Tomorrow, When the War Began--which is also based on a teen dystopian-fiction novel). There's a riot, which IMDB's trivia section notes was shot by ""second unit director Steven Soderbergh"", and when's the last time you heard that phrase?, that punctuates things nicely as well. Granted, you will get more out of these scenes if you've read the book, especially the climax. I'm tempted to offer the hypothesis that if you haven't read the book, in fact, the climax will seem a bit on the senseless side--they removed a lot of the context from the second half of the novel that gives the climax the punch it has in print.

As for the acting, well, I just gave you the tip of the iceberg, though what a tip it is; Jennifer Lawrence can seemingly do anything. (I mean, she made The House at the End of the Street almost bearable.) And she holds her own against a case that also includes Donald Sutherland, Elizabeth Banks, Wes Bentley, Alexander Ludwig, Stanley Tucci, and Jacqueline Emerson, among others. (You don't know that last name yet. You will.) To be succinct, which I haven't done too well in this review so far, everyone does the best with what they were given, really. The problem is, what they were given is so much less than it could have been. **",1374364800,,7480,4.7140672782874615

4944171,5,B0063FQREO,"Despite maybe a few changes from the book here and there, the movie is a faithful adaptation and I am sure will entertain any moviegoer.

4944199,4,B0063FQREO,It reminded me of a short story I read called the lottery. Slightly more depth and back story here. I think the concept of children brutally killing one another maybe a little mature for some audiences. Overall very entertaining.,1373846400,,229,4.897435897435898
4944200,5,B0063FQREO,"This movie is almost as good as the book.  The book was absolutely excellent and I did not expect the movie to be able to capture the essence of the book as well as it did.  I would have liked the story of the pin to be inline with the book, and more attention to the relationship between between Katniss and Cinna.  This is a well written, well acted, well directed movie.",1373846400,,373,4.152777777777778
4944201,4,B0063FQREO,this is an excellent movie weither you have read the books or not you will be entertained and constantly guessing and rooting them on.  very worth your time to watch this one and youll be ready for the second movie and or book!,1373760000,,227,4.27906976744186

4944205,4,B0063FQREO,"Overall, I thought it was a really great film.  I loved the acting and thought the casting was perfect.  I was not sure about Josh Hutcherson as Peeta but ending up thinking he made a great Peeta.  I am still Team Gale---is it just me or did they downplay they Gale scenes?---but am slightly more open to the idea of Peeta and Katniss together now that I've seen the movie.

As with any book to movie adaptation, I missed the parts that were cut from the book.  The bit about the Mockingjay pin bothered me, I wanted to see more of Katniss's life before the Reaping, and I wanted to see the victory tour after the Games.  I also wanted to see Katniss break Peeta's heart at the end of the movie, like she does in the book.  Oh, burn, Peeta, burn!  I have a feeling these movies are going to be very pro-Peeta.  And I'll just have to learn to live with that.

I loved the special effects as well as the costume design.  Those two elements really made the movie for me.  I also loved getting to see the Games through the Gamemaker's perspective.  I enjoyed seeing them manipulating the environment, and thought it added another layer of depth to the movie.

Overall, I enjoyed The Hunger Games.  I can't say that it will be a movie that I buy and watch over and over again, like, say, Twilight or any of my Jane Austen films, but it was very well done and I will definitely keep watching the series.",1373760000,,1397,4.278625954198473

4944207,4,B0063FQREO,"I was really surprised by this movie.  Having not read the books, I was not sure what to expect.  Loved Jennifer Lawrence in this and now understand the buzz around this movie and her performance.  Good experience.",1373760000,,214,4.72972972972973

4944209,1,B0063FQREO,Typical love triangle with the heroine in the middle. The story has merits but the execution of portraying that story fell short. If your over 15 I don't recommend. So many better options out there for your time.,1373760000,6,212,4.605263157894737

4944212,5,B0063FQREO,"This will keep you on the edge of your seat. More than that, Hunger Games is a great commentary on how we have become a reality tv obsessed nation. It definitely gives you pause to think.",1373760000,,187,4.222222222222222

4944214,2,B0063FQREO,This story (taken from a book) promotes children killing other children.  Kids emulate things they see. Why are we promoting murder among teenagers as a game?,1373673600,,158,5.076923076923077
4944215,4,B0063FQREO,"Although the movie is not as in depth as the book, it does have all the elements to make a good movie.

An interesting movie to watch, I would recommend it.",1373673600,,282,3.7966101694915255

4944217,4,B0063FQREO,"read the books before i saw the movie in theaters. back then, i was more critical of the adaption. watching the movie tonight when the books were less ""fresh"" in my mind lets me be less sensitive to the finer points of this book that could not be done in a single movie. another review suggested that the adaptations could have been done on tv--like, maybe as a mini series on cable. well-yeah-but that would have to have had to have been done as a mini series (closed world-it is a trilogy)rather than as detailed, ongoing series with much unfolding and still being written as with game of thrones or walking dead. within the confines of this medium, the adaptation is very good. the essential spirit of the first book was put forth faithfully with ""flirts"" for readers and amply for non readers. my wife did not read the books and thought the movie was great. since the themes and plots become more complicated in the subsequent books, i am more concerned about the adaptations of the other 2 books yet look forward to them.",1373587200,,1026,4.551351351351351

4944221,5,B0063FQREO,"Gladiatorial games of the future with team sponsors. A very nice twist to the punishment for the riots of the past. I really don't care for the iron fist suppression of the  12 areas then the lottery to select 2 pre teen, teen or young adults to fight for their area where only one of the 24 can walk out alive. The movie has you begin to hate of the government for what it does then gets your heart beating faster when area 12 survivors mess with the protocol of the Hunger Games agenda and the head Hunger guy is served a lunch of berries he really didn't want. Can't wait for version #2 to come along",1373587200,,603,4.153846153846154

4944223,5,B0063FQREO,I really liked this movie; it was well done.  I question the ending.  I don't think that part followed the book,1373587200,,111,4.238095238095238

4944225,3,B0063FQREO,"The post-apocalyptic storyline is great, but the juxtaposition of the natural environment with the high-tech digital reality of the games was just too jarring. The scenes with the dog-like creatures in the end just made you think that the controllers of the games could have made any outcome work, so it took away from the cunning and resiliency of the contestants. Not sure how this was handled in the book, but it just didn't translate that well to the screen.  The movie was a great tale of resistance against powerful and completely degenerate leadership, so it was worth it, and the natural setting in the western North Carolina mountains was beautifully filmed.  I just found the Sci-Fi elements distracting from the movie's message. Jennifer Lawrence is very impressive here, but she plays pretty much the same character to better effect in ""Winter's Bone.""",1373587200,,864,5.034965034965035
4944226,4,B0063FQREO,"The movie is rarely better than the book in my opinion, and this remained true for this movie. Don't get me wrong - the movie is still a thriller and has a great plot, but it will never compare to the book.
Beware of the violent plot line if you are sensitive to that type of thing.
Keeps you on the edge of your seat and pulls your emotions in all different directions simultaneously.
Great for those who like action/adventure - is a bit syfy as well.",1373500800,,452,4.206896551724138

4944230,5,B0063FQREO,"I love many of the visuals depicted in this film. The horn at the cornicopia was my favorite. I do wish the movie would have introduced Madge, the Mayor's daughter though",1373500800,,170,4.516129032258065
4944231,1,B0063FQREO,"while i enjoy the movie, for some reason part of the movie was omitted, i know because i had seen the movie previously, i should have  returned it, but  it wasn't worth the time and trouble, so yes i was disappointed, will buy another copy from some else",1373500800,,254,4.270833333333333
4944232,3,B0063FQREO,"In many ways the theme behind the hunger games is more relevant than the actual (2 1/2 hr) movie which does drag on.
A few  twists as it goes along but again it feels like it's just setting the viewer up for a sequel.
The scenery is beautiful but not spectacular.",1373500800,,263,4.1568627450980395

4944234,4,B0063FQREO,"The movie does a good job of picking out some of the more important aspects of the book, but if read the book and then watch the movie it feels extremely rushed. You also would have no idea how close to death Katniss was in the arena from dehydration. Also, the ending is much better in the book. I enjoyed the movie, but it would have done the book a lot more justice had they broken it into two movies.",1373500800,,404,4.0625
4944235,5,B0063FQREO,"I don't usually like this type of movie. I like movies that are more realistic of our time. However, the execution of this movie was very good.

4944250,4,B0063FQREO,"I read the entire series... this TRIED to stick to it pretty much and it was a good rendition.  In my opinion the books are always better than the movies, but then in books you can ""see"" the characters' thoughts .",1373414400,,213,4.195121951219512
4944251,3,B0063FQREO,"I saw this movie knowing full well that it doesn't live up to the book. In my opinion, a lot of vague things happen that reference what happens in the book. This includes characters. If you didn't read the book, this movie will leave you scratching your head. Gale only shows up like 5 times for less than 10 seconds each in the entire movie, and he ultimately seemed unimportant to the plot. Flashbacks are vague, for example;

<spoiler>
In the book, Peeta sees Katniss in the rain and throws her some bread. Very straight forward, she appreciates it, no question. In the movie, a 10 second flashback shows Katniss, and Peeta staring at her. Then something that looks like a shoe or a lump of coal lands in the mud(it's supposed to be the bread)... If you didn't read the book, you probably wouldn't even register what is going on and just assume that a lump of coal landed in the mud, ""what does that have to do with anything?"", you might ask yourself.
</spoiler>

Despite the movie being almost 3 hours long, events are rushed and scenes aren't even long enough to register what is happening. I didn't care about the characters at all, not NEARLY as much as I cared about them in the book. However, the movie attempts to get me to care anyway, and even expects it, only to produce cringey results. Cinna, Heimich, Gale, Primrose, even President Snow. Just a handful of characters from the book that evoke strong emotion, all fall flat in the movie. They simply aren't allowed much character development. Interestingly, even President Snow is given more screentime(and lines) than Gale. Effie Trinket, the lady that does the reaping, is given proper time in the book. You even begin to see things from her perspective and even start having empathy for her. In the movie, what little time and lines she has just develops her as a high-class prissy jerk, completely unrelatable.

So, all-in-all, this movie just isn't that great. It's more of a companion to the book instead standing on its own. If you've read the book, this is an OK watch. If not, don't waste your time. Read the book first/instead.

Personally, I could see this doing well as a TV series similar to Game of Thrones.",1373328000,,2185,4.623711340206185

4944259,2,B0063FQREO,"This is the third book to film combo i watach and I don't like it. It wasn't terrible, but it lacked emotion. Narration would have made this film better. We don't know what Catniss (Jennifer Lawrence) is thinking, feeling, planning etc. Narration is a must, or should be when transferring a book into a film, because 70% of the book is all what the main charactor is thinking, by removing what she thinks from the film you are leaving out a major part of the story. On top of leaving out first person narration, most of the dialogue has been changed, some left out even parts of the story was changed.

Example Rue, in the book you felt a connection between her and Katniss. Rue taught her some things about plants and berries. That was left out. The developing romance between katniss and Peeta, the kisses, the trying to convince the viewers that love was blossoming....left out. You get a very sedated love story. The final battle was even changed...well parts of it.

This is why authors don't sell the story for $10 They film makers ruin the book so much that only a hefty price tag will let the author feel good about their book being destoryed.",1373328000,5,1151,4.528846153846154

The plot, for me, required a lot of suspension of credibility. That's usually OK (I'm a Resident Evil fan), but I often thought its internal logic was dispensed with too often for questionable dramatic effect. The only real problem I have with The Hunger Games is the cinematography. It relies too much on jerky or constant camera movement.

I should note, as well, that in this case, the plot lines and relationships in both were rather juvenile. But this was a teen fantasy fiction, so I cannot criticize on this point. I think the problem I had was that this movie missed many of the elements that helped even an adult reader suspend belief regarding the rather preposterous premise of an annual pubescent death-match. Katniss's character development was relegated to a brief saunter in the woods and a couple of grainy flashbacks. The backstory of this dystopia were summarized with a few lines of text in the beginning of the film with some follow-up via the game commentators.

The books, I felt, were very violent and graphic. The themes were very disturbing, as well; but the overall experience was page-turning. This film relied almost entirely on the suspense of the game, itself. Instead of enjoying the role of omniscient viewer of their world, I was limited to feeling like a common spectator of the Hunger Games.",1373328000,,1139,4.927083333333333

The worst of it all is that the min character isn't even a real winner, every time she is about to die someone is always there to save her, you got to love convenience. And for the action, it's like to a roller coaster on a weekend. You'll have to wait in line, be on the roller coaster for a few minutes, and have to wait in line again.

And after a bit of great action-packed sequences, (and some more shallow smooching idiots, we reach the grand climax, which is well done. And then....BAM! It's over.
My major issue with this movie is the shallowness. Now, I admit to being somewhat of a romance hater, but this was just poorly done. I can sit through some romance scenes, but these were awkward, broken, and more boring that twilight.

From the incredible direction and very applicable special effects to very touching and believable writing. The loss of the beautiful, little girl and the resolution of the winning couple (to die together, rather than comply), were both heartbreaking, breath-taking moments in this futuristic drama.

Strangely the music scoring was incredibly marginal and the closing songs should have tormented some other movie. I don't see any record-breaking sales in the Hunger Games soundtracks release. I actually watched the entire end credits and turned the background songs down...and then mute.

Hunger Games deserved a Henry Mancini-quality score and at least one commercial hit.

A final thought for the thinking, coherent minority...

Like other futuristic scenario movies, Hunger Games is delusion-ally optimistic projection of our future...considering the reality of ""the convergence of crises"" just ahead, coming right to us.",1372896000,,982,5.744827586206896

4944323,3,B0063FQREO,"Paced like an old Yugo, and directed with the restraint of a Liberace show, the movie corrupts what may be very good source material in many ways, focusing too much on the melodramatic internal struggles of the children and not nearly long enough on the real war of survivorship that is the movie's core.
Luckily for the movie, it has Jennifer Lawrence; an unstoppable force of nature we have not seen since Tom Cruise.  Infusing life, humor, and earnest vulnerability in every scene.  Her explosive performance holds together a movie that doesn't deserve it; and makes it a must see for anyone who realizes Lawrence now sits just behind Pitt, Cruise, and Clooney as our fourth most watchable actor.",1372896000,,699,4.8655462184873945
4944324,3,B0063FQREO,"The conflation of the ancient Roman life-style and the all-pervasive media culture of the present is original, since it offers the commentary that today's obsession with the real (no matter how vacuous the representation of that ""real"" might be) and the media's pandering of ""reality shows"" correspond to the gladiator battles of the past, where one's struggle for survival was another's entertainment. The film's uneven distribution of wealth and resources between the urban city and the rural country also points towards this inherent problem of class struggle as much as it does to a politics of race (somehow touched upon by Cato letting the protagonist go, instead of killing her).
But what about the internal contradictions of the city and the rural? Do all the wealthy live in urban settings, while the people in the country are uniformly poor, broken, and left to their own resources? Is it that simple and compartmentalized? If this is the case, how can the system ensure the ""loyalty"" of the peripheral districts to its hegemonic rule, especially in the age of effective communication technologies, where the subjects are able to witness the blessings enjoyed by the urban population and starve in their decrepit homes?
The film loses whatever originality it introduces as the plot makes its way into the forest background, where ""the survival of the fittest"" theme is played out. The main problem is that the protagonist does not experience any authentic conflict - her choices to ""take care of"" some and ""take down"" others are already inscribed in the opening sacrificial act she performs in saving her sister in the early part of the film. So, isn't there any learning, wisdom, or growing-up involved all through these radically different experiences and displacements? Why does she only contemplate the possibility of forming an alliance with her ""fellow villager,"" rather than exploring other, potentially more dynamic and politically emancipatory ones?
As a result of these problems, the protagonist, unfortunately, remains a flat character. One moment that contradicts with this is the scene where she is interviewed by the host in front of a massive number of audience. While she arrives naive and ignorant of the urban population's tastes, mannerisms, and demands, she immediately picks up the pattern in which the audience responds to her answers and begins to manipulate them to her advantage. This is probably the strongest scene in the development of character and reflects some interesting potential for her to understand, dissect, and use the loopholes of the system to her advantage. But, instead of extrapolating these potentially emancipatory departure points, the latter part of the film wallows in a series of sappy, soap-opera kind of romantic and sacrificial cliches and loses whatever originality it promises in the beginning.",1372896000,,2859,5.258205689277899

At least where female teens and tweens are concerned. And smart teen males will want to be knowledgeable about the films girls like to see if they're eager to make friends with girls. Dragging dates to Fast & Furious XXXV will not do the trick unless you're dating Danica Patrick...

Hunger Games is good discussion fodder because it's very, very popular; it's part of a trilogy of books and a coming tetralogy of films; and it has enough good points to build on (along with bad points to deal with).

How you approach it depends on the teen, of course. There are people who respond to any attempt at discussion with idiocies like ""Why do you have to analyze everything? Why can't you just enjoy it?"" People who say this may not be stupid (though that is a distinct possibility). They may be intellectually insecure or lazy, and trying to conceal this in an application of ""offense is the best defense."" If the kid is young enough you can make a post-discussion a precondition for letting them see ""Hunger Games."" If they're older...well, you may just have a dud on your hands. Sorry about that.

I do know people who consider any discussion of works of art a waste of time because they think the purpose of most art is frivolous--killing time, frothy entertainment. This can be worked with, though it's still hard. But let's get back to ""Hunger Games"" in particular.

Since I'm talking about talking about this film, now I'm going to include spoilers freely. Don't go on until you've seen it unless you don't care. Forewarned...

There are two equally valid ways to talk about a movie like ""Hunger Games:"" as a film, and as philosophy--that is, as a reflection on life.

As a film, ""Hunger Games"" is an example of how you can tackle turning a book into a film--and in particular how you can make a film that coheres as a movie while at the same time leading to more films in the series (every TV series faces this challenge).

Practically speaking, a film can't be any longer than ""Hunger Games"" is. So what does your teen think of the choices the film makes in what to include from the book and what to leave out? If your teen thinks something left out should have been left in--such as, say, Rue's developing relationship with Catniss during the training period--what should be left out in order to make room for that?

Then, considering what is the same in book and movie, what about the fact that Catniss winds up not having to kill anyone we like, or anyone defenseless whether we like them or not? She does have to make a tough decision when it comes to, in effect, being ordered to kill Peeta. But that's it. This is an example of a plot designed to look tough that actually is not so tough. What if she'd had to choose between killing Rue or Peeta? It could have easily worked out that way.

Ask your teen what she would have done at each crucial decision point in Catniss's story. You can also see whether she caught the fact that Catniss doesn't love Peeta? She likes him, she's grateful to him for his acts of kindness earlier in their lives. But gratitude ain't love.

Also, it seems like Catniss hadn't been teaching Primrose how to hunt. Why not? Would your teen have made that choice? If your teen had been in Primrose's position, would she have asked Catniss to teach her? [I'm only talking about the movie here.]

Taking a step back, is this future society plausible? For example, if the Capitol City denizens are so decadent, who are the highly disciplined military/police forces? They aren't lounging around decadently. The Roman Empire wound up hiring ""barbarians"" for their military--who wound up taking over eventually. A college-bound teen might want to explore this to see what are the parallels between real empires like the Roman one and the world of Hunger Games.

And what about the scientists, engineers and technicians needed to maintain a very, very advanced technological infrastructure? That all takes discipline and hard work, not dilettantish decadence. Where are these people?

And, like, what are those killer dogs made of? CGI can't bite people. That's tech way beyond anything we can imagine.

A lot of teens, fed on a rich diet of CGI-stuffed scifi/action movies, may not realize what's science and what's fiction. Your teen should realize that those lethal out-of-thin-air dogs represented tech waaay beyond most other stuff in the film. That doesn't make it invalid to use; but you should realize the difference, and so should your teen.

Which brings us to using Hunger Games to help your teen learn about the art of movies. You can talk about casting, screenwriting, cinematography, lighting, sound, music, editing, CGI, direction, mise en scene--even to technical details like scene transitions (cuts, wipes, fade out/fade in). And you can talk about the Fourth Wall (that divides the audience from the ""stage""). About POV (Point of View). Does Hunger Games ever break the Fourth Wall, intentionally or otherwise (it's intentional when the actor turns to the audience and addresses them directly; it's unintentional when the shadow of a boom mike drifts into view). What's Hunger Games' POV? Are we seeing everything through Catniss's eyes? (we aren't--but where and when are we not, and is that a good idea here?).

What about the last fight on top of the Cornocopia, when the Evil Boy makes a little existential speech about knowing he's dying, regretting the fact that his whole life has been about training to be a killer, but thinking he might as well kill once more? Why did the screenwriter include that little speech? Why? Did it complicate things for Catniss, who has trouble killing anyway? Does it tell us more about this society? Does it make the Evil Boy a little sympathetic, and is that a good thing?

Look at the credits at the end with your teen. See if she knows what the different jobs are. Look up the ones you don't recognize on Wikipedia or suchlike. Who's a Best Boy? A Key Grip? A Second Unit director? See what locations were used.

Some say casting is 80% of a movie. What would the film have been like if they'd used someone besides Jennifer Lawrence as Catniss? I heard Chloe Grace Moretz wanted the part. Would she have been too young? She's one of the most athletic young female stars in Hollywood, though of course Lawrence is no slouch. But she's also, like, half a foot shorter. Would that have made a difference?

It's not like Hunger Games is a towering masterpiece of a movie. It isn't terrible either, though. And assuming it's one of your teen's favorite movies, you can use it as a gateway to thinking about society, real world morality, the future, and filmmaking.",1372550400,,6791,4.7204391891891895

4944383,3,B0063FQREO,"This is a routine sci-fi movie made to catch a teen's expendable income. The breath of fresh
air is the lead actor, Jennifer Lawrence, who was solid in her role as a beleaguered and
selfless young woman knowing the odds are against her.

You can tell from her work in this film why she is continuing to stand out as an actress. She
will do better as she matures. She was the glue holding the film together.

I would have given it 2 1/2 stars if able. By the way the film ends it appears they could opt
for a trilogy but if I were her agent she would not opt-in. Continue to watch for Jennifer
Lawrence because in this movie she shows her chops with room to grow.

acting in far more appropriately mature films that are getting good reviews.",1372464000,,838,4.2974683544303796

The director took some liberties that take the heart out of the plot.  The meaning of the gift of bread from district 4 is essential to understanding how and why the revolution spreads and he skipped it entirely.  the movie just seems like Hunger games lite.

The first time I saw it in the theater I found it to be quite disturbing... I had a hard time getting past the blood and gore.  The second time around, at home with a rental, I was more intrigued with the characters and the eclectic mix of lore.  It's scary to think that our world could advance so much as to wisk along on a 200 mph high speed train with children that are taken from human prison camps that mimic life before Christ into a city full of very colorful, hungry citizens that enjoy creating a playing field for these children to fight each other to the death.  It seemed so silly at times. Talk show host style coverage of the ""games"" that were orchestrated by a roomful of technicians amped up the excitement by using virtual images that came to life.  It was over-the-top and ridiculous in some ways but still managed to keep a strong human element.

To compare it to the book would be like comparing a picture of the Roman collusium to being there. I am comparing this book to other movies I have watched, and this one is so unique.

I thought the trilogy of the Hunger Games books were a brilliant conjecture of a similar bizarre resurrection of this kind of entertainment in our future if we continue to allow money to dominate our political system, creating the inequality which is destroying our democratic process.  It is not a terrible stretch from the Survivor-type reality games of today's television to a future government-controlled set of games to keep the populace in their place.  This time the prize is not a million dollars, but merely the right to continue to live.

The movie is a watered-down version of the first book which was necessary to get a PG-13 rating and appeal to the teenage audience for whom the books were intended.  Watch the movie(s) but read all three books first.",1372204800,,870,4.891156462585034

The books were written for teenagers and I found all three of them to be lacking in the writing. I believe this came through in the film. The premise is one set in the future where the inhabitants of the country Panem must give up a small group of teens to compete in a fight to the death. The whole ordeal is televised to the nation as a game. The winner is allowed to live and treated as a hero. The whole reason for this game is a sacrifice to the country for a passed uprising against the central government. I don't understand why they call it the ""hunger games"" because the game has nothing to do with finding food or being hungry. Having said that, for free it was entertaining and passed the time. If you haven't read the books you may be a little confused during some flashbacks sequences wondering what the film is trying to show/tell you. Overall it's worth watching if you enjoy movies about futuristic societies and the way they subjugate their people. In future books/movies there is an uprising against the central government against the games and the central government.

4944439,5,B0063FQREO,"Let's start off by saying that I really enjoyed this movie and it was really a great movie. Just found a little bit boring the second disc with the special features that were just a sequence of interviews with the producers, cast and director boasting about their work as if it were something exceptional. Well, in my opinion they just did what they were expected to do as professionals; like in any other profession.

With that said, while I was watching the movie, I started wondering if Suzanne Collins ever read Japanese manga from late 1950/early 1960. Why? Because the story she is telling is so similar to a manga I read while I was learning to read in early 1960. Yes, I learned to read, reading manga. The difference being that the two warriors actually died at the end; but not because they fought to death. In that manga, the two warriors are on different sides and they were required to wear masks and were never referred to by names, but by numbers only. And at the end, when only two warriors were still alive and at their final battle, one warrior manages to cut out his opponent's mask, thus revealing that the other warrior was a female. More than that, that the girl was someone he loved deeply (yes, a star-crossed lover) and the revelation makes him hesitate to deliver the final blow.

She, then, takes the opportunity given by his hesitation and attacks. Just to find out that he was just warding her attack off and purposefully avoiding hurting her. This enrages her for she thinks he feels superior because she is a female. And then, she manages to rip his mask off and the truth is revealed....

They were a long lost love of each other. But bound by honor, one must kill the other. She offers her life but he refuses to kill her and asks her to kill him instead. Honor demands. The final solution: they kill each other in a seppuku style.

Of course, this kind of ending is not suitable for the American taste and therefore, Katniss and Peeta would never be allowed to eat the deadly poisonous berry...

The storyline is actually not original. There was an episode in the Sliders TV Series where the premise was exactly the same: A game of death with only one victor allowed; and other movies with similar storyline.

Anyways, like they say: there are no creation in entertainment, only imitation: art imitating Life and one producer imitating the other, etc. etc.",1371945600,,2390,4.585480093676815

I should have known better--you cannot always convert a masterpiece.  The movie was awesome, and the only reason I have any qualms may be perhaps because I read the book first.

It is really disturbing to know that people watch a movie about kids butchering each other for entertainment and worse yet allow there young impressionable children to watch it. It was very hard to finish this movie, the only thing that kept me going were the little moments when the characters in the movie showed love and compassion for each other, but it was all overshadowed by a theme which I think highlights what is so very wicked about our entertainment industry, including the people that enjoy these films. Maybe in the sequel they will include some scenes were underage children are having sex, why not it's all in good and fun right? After all it's just a movie. Here's some entertainment I'd like to share, ""Your eye is the lamp of your body. When your eyes are healthy, your whole body also is full of light.

4944466,3,B0063FQREO,"Hold your horses, i know no, nay almost none, live up to the book, or  print, version. Yet I still had issues with the way the movie was delivered, the capitalites costumes, should have been much more flamboyant, the could have spent more time on training, and other various aspects. I understand that this is consideried a ""Long Movie"" by todays standers but what happened to the days of the two and a half hour (2.5hr) movies were of standred length, Sadly it seems that our attention span is down the drain. I like the film feel, though unshure is that was an effect added in post production or if it was actually  (though unlikely) filmed on film, the shoulder cam feel(boncing and bobing) gave you that wonderfull presctive as if you are right there, it drew you in and help you to connect to the characters. On characters they were not nearly as dynamic in the book. Though over all it is a pleasing flim to watch, though i do not plan on adding it to my dvd collection anytime soon.

These are simply my opinions, i encourage you to form your own. They movie is worth a watch but i would not by it.

Oh - and by the way it's PG-13 so 13 year old kids can be entertained by kids killing each other. But it's popularity was overwhelming so I figured I should still see what all the fuss was about. While the action, acting and sets were pretty good the movie confirmed my suspicions about what my heart already knew. This isn't what movies are about. Kids and teens dying is a no-no in film and who the hell needs or wants to see it? On a good and bad note I will say that the violence was not glamorized. There was no overly graphic scenes. Most violence happened so quickly you couldn't really see what happened even though you just knew what did. I guess that's how they got the PG-13 rating which annoys me more than the plot of the movie. It's a cheap way to get a young crowd.

The movie touches on the influence of media, the impact of social classes, the toxic nature of unforgiveness and retribution, and the struggle of operating in a system that significantly devalues individuals.

Shame on Hollywood for producing such an evil film.

People: Stop subscribing to these garbage promotions of evil from Hollywood so that the financial pressures will convince the stupid producers to promote something good.  This country has lost its sense of good and bad.

I'm not one of those individuals that always cries, ""The book was better!"" It's just that, in this instance, I think the book was a 10 out of 10, but the movie was only an 8. For instance, the movie could have easily been another 15-20 minutes longer and included more of a build in the Katniss-Rue and Katniss-Peeta interactions. Katniss's connection to those individuals could have been deeper, as they were in the book, and it would have made the difficult moments in the book far more emotional.

With a smaller version of the U.S. segmented into twelve districts, each responsible for a primary staple of existence, the ruling party enforces a lottery which randomly selects a 12-18 boy and girl from each district to compete in a televised fight to the death. When her young sister's name is drawn, Katniss Everdeen (Lawrence) volunteers in her place. Teaming with Peeta Mellark (Josh Hutcherson), Katniss' hunting skills with bow and arrow--along with their budding relationship--capture the imagination of the viewing public, who wind up rooting for these two ""lovers"" from district twelve. Lessons of  honor, courage, loyalty, dedication, skill, and hardships-overcome leave us with impressions which last far longer than the periodic violence.

4944518,4,B0063FQREO,"The Hunger Games was destined to be a blockbuster, from the moment the film began production. The novel, on which the film is based, was the kind of phenomenon of the level of Harry Potter and Twilight that would bring in a built in audience. But with the kind of fan devotion that the novel has, the movie also was tasked with meeting the high expectations of those who enjoyed the book.

I'll admit, I was a bit hesitant to explore the whole Hunger Games craze. While I usually enjoy thrillers and adult literature, the novel had enough buzz to warrant my attention. I devoured the book in a day, and was convinced that there was definitely something to the story that I wouldn't mind seeing on film.

The movie itself does an efficient, if not inspired, job of translating the novel to the screen. Jennifer Lawrence is the undeniable star as the strong willed Katniss. In the film, Katniss takes the place of her younger sister in the annual Hunger Games, a fight to the death between male and female tributes from each of the 12 districts of the dystopian world. Because of the limitations of the medium, we aren't given as much character development as the novel provided, but the actors do a fine job at trying to make each character fit into the world.

In the novel, there was a subtle hint of political restlessness that gets mostly hidden by the big spectacle of the film. To be fair, there are a few moments where the filmmakers excel at providing deeper emotional insight, particularly during the death of one of the tributes. Unfortunately, the constraints of the film force the plot to move so quickly that most of these subtle moments get blown over.

Overall, this a a perfectly fine adaptation of an above average novel. There were no egregious departures from the source material, so fans of the novels should be satisfied. Like the book, the ending is conclusive while still setting the foundation for the continuation of the story. If you haven't read the books or seen the movies, they are definitely worth the few hours they will take for you to experience them. Having experienced the novels and this first movie, I can understand the hype that surrounds the series, and look forward to seeing the adaptation of the second novel, Catching Fire, later this year.",1371427200,,2284,4.674129353233831

4944520,5,B0063FQREO,It wasn't what I thought it would be...it was better.  I enjoyed it and want to watch it again to see what I missed the first time.,1371427200,,131,3.8518518518518516

4944524,5,B0063FQREO,"We were greatly impressed at the ability of the producer/director to put this book into a movie. They did a great job of showing what happens when government gets too powerful.
Highly recommend this movie.",1371427200,,205,4.885714285714286
4944525,5,B0063FQREO,"I recently finished reading the Hunger Games series. Matching the movie to what I read was fun and exciting. By reading the book first, it really helped piece the movie together for me. I'm doubtful I would have enjoyed the movie as much had I not read the book, but that's probably because I'm not really into this type of genre generally. The acting was great, and although the plot is rather gruesome, the movie depicted it quite tastefully. I'm looking forward to the next release!",1371427200,,485,4.651162790697675
4944526,4,B0063FQREO,The movie is great but it is not as good as the book.  It is missing a lot if the details found in the book.,1371427200,,108,3.32

4944531,5,B0063FQREO,"I love this movie. It keeps you interested from the very start to the very end.

4944534,3,B0063FQREO,This is another classic case of the book being better than the movie. If you have read the book you will likely find the movie to be disappointing. A great deal of the plot of the book is missing from the movie.,1371427200,,211,4.0476190476190474
4944535,1,B0063FQREO,"Finally forced myself to watch this, because it was supposedly such a big deal.

The sick irony of this movie is that it allows its viewers to feel smug in judging how horrible a civilization must become to make children become gladiators-- while those same viewers do not realize that by watching this movie they are participating in, and enjoying, the very same thing.  Oh yes, just because it's ""fictional,"" it's ""OK.""  I did not get any enjoyment out of watching this movie.

Again, ironically, people do not realize how sick our culture has become for this to have gained so much popularity.",1371340800,5,596,4.757281553398058

If they had added some more in-depth exploration into the lives and personalities of the major players in the story beforehand I think it would have added interest and could, in my opinion, have warranted the 5th star.",1371340800,,255,4.666666666666667

Untill last moment I was hoping the main character will strive to stop this brutal tradition ! But what a disappointment, she just rejoices her victory after all other 13 kids are dead !!",1371340800,6,275,4.63265306122449

4944544,3,B0063FQREO,A science fiction that doesn't take itself too seriously or have a million warriors running all over place. It is a believable movie concept; something that a dictator led country would institute for the amusement of the folks.,1371340800,,227,5.0

4944546,2,B0063FQREO,Is this some cruel way of releasing teen angst? If we call this 'just a movie' I think we are kidding ourselves. We are affected by what we see and hear otherwise we wouldn't go to the movies (or rent one or own them). We watch movies because we want to be affected by them. But this is one movie I didn't finish and will not encourage others to watch. I see no benefit.,1371340800,,370,4.013513513513513

4944551,4,B0063FQREO,"The film brilliantly captured the spirit of the book, respecting both viewers who had read it and those who coming to the story fresh. The costumes and sets portrayed the scenes with creativity and captivation. The action and courage was conveyed without too much gratuitous violence. The characters had depth and personality for an action film. It was the best science fiction action film I have seen since Avatar.",1371340800,,415,5.028985507246377
4944552,4,B0063FQREO,having read the series of books the movie lacks a lot of the detail that truly should not have been left out but then the movie would have had to be 4 hours long.,1371340800,,162,3.7941176470588234
4944553,3,B0063FQREO,The movie was pretty good but if you read the books before hand you'll see many gaps in the story.,1371340800,,98,3.95
4944554,3,B0063FQREO,"Ideally, this would have been a R-rated movie, but we can't have that in a franchise movie aimed at teens.  This project strikes me as something conceived as a franchise before the first word of the book was written.  Jennifer Lawrence is amazing.  Everything and everyone else is competent, if not special.",1371340800,,307,4.865384615384615

4944557,4,B0063FQREO,"I am not really a fan of science fiction, so I almost decided not to watch this movie. I was pleasantly surprised, when they movie was better than I had expected.  I didn't like the violence, but the story was done quite well, and I think that  we will be seeing much more of Jennifer Lawrence as an actress.",1371254400,,308,4.203389830508475

4944559,5,B0063FQREO,"I watched it when it came out but thought it was ok.  Seeing that it was available on Prime, I decided to watch it again and found a wholly more enjoyable movie the second time around.  Having not read the book, I was not sure what to expect and the first time and was slightly taken aback by the story.  Not so the next time I watched, having now understood the characters and their predicaments, this has made me very excited to see the next installment in the series on the big screen in November.",1371168000,,500,4.242105263157895

4944561,5,B0063FQREO,"Great movie, was never interested in it when it first came out then I rented it because my best friend to me it was a great movie. Never read the books, but cant wait for the next 2 to come out.",1371168000,,194,3.7560975609756095

4944563,4,B0063FQREO,Enjoyed this movie very much.  I was not expecting to like it at all but was very pleasantly surprised.  I expected a lot of blood and gore and it was so nice to watch a action movie that left all that to one's imagination.  I don't need to see blood spurting everywhere to know someone has been killed; it was very refreshing to see the violence handled in this way.,1371168000,,367,4.214285714285714
4944564,4,B0063FQREO,I am waiting to see if they continue to make movies of the other two.  I liked all the books.,1371168000,,93,3.65

4944571,4,B0063FQREO,"I am so glad that I read the books before seeing this movie.  There are details and ideas that are explained well in the book. If you haven't read the book, you may not understand some of the scenes in the movie.",1371168000,,212,4.0476190476190474
4944572,3,B0063FQREO,Couldn't compare to the book. Slow to start. Poorly explained. Characters match well enough. Katniss appears well-fed and Gayle looks about 35. If you love the series it's worth seeing. Showed it to my 7th graders. Not very violent but they do drop 'damn' and 'hell' more than once.,1371168000,,282,4.775510204081633

4944574,4,B0063FQREO,"I've always enjoyed stories of ""dystopia"" - A Brave New World, Fahrenheit 451, etc - because they make me think.  I don't know if the Hunger Games will be as predictive of our own times, but the film was an enjoyable immersion into a well-played story that leaves me wondering what will happen next.  Well worth the time spent watching.",1371081600,,336,4.583333333333333

4944578,3,B0063FQREO,"This movie was entertaining and I was able to watch the whole movie. Not a movie that I would say I would like to see it again.

4944584,4,B0063FQREO,"Overall The Hunger Games was a decent piece of sci-fi.  Although it is filled with the expected teenage drama, their are surprisingly decent plot twist that add to the movie.

4944600,4,B0063FQREO,"The movie does not result to sexual innuendos or sexuality or foul language, drugs, violence etc to be the entertainment - it relies on the story. Appropriate for most ages, and a great family movie!

I read all three books, one right after the other as I could not put them down. I am in my mid 20's and am not a Twilight fan or anything of the sort. This is the only series I have ever read the books for and typically do not enjoy reading. That being said - I am a HUGE fan of this series.
While this movie was very much based to the teenage world, it is rightfully so but is also very appropriate for a much more mature audience. I'll try very hard to not to give any spoilers in this review, but to thoroughly review my opinions of the movie.
First of all, I watched this on opening night and was thrilled with the movie and from that moment could not wait for the next. I also bought the movie during Black Friday sales as I couldn't pass it up, even though I try very hard not to mix Christmas and personal shopping - I'm glad I did :)
I will say that leaving the theatre I was slightly disappointed. There are several areas where the movie and the book were not on par, and to me these were very important parts. The manner in which the mockingjay pin is received (to me, this was  HUGE disappointment since it is so far off of the novel and that was a key part in my opinion in the book), next was the manner in which Peeta learned of the angle Haymitch had Katniss took since in the book he finds out well after the fact and that is the underlying issue that book 2 deals with. I'm very curious about how this will be portrayed in the next movie. The third issue that I had with the movie is the creatures at the end of the Hunger Games since they were vividly described in the book, especially the 'eyes' and the manner in which Cato and them run into each other.

Once I was able to get over the differences (and VERY surprised at how many said how closely the movie and book followed) I was able to enjoy the movie even more. The premise of the story of course is the capital acting as a totalitarian, and forces a male and female from each district within the ages of 12 and 18 to fight to the death, leaving a single victor. This is the single reason many people I know had zero interest in reading the book or watching the movie. However, the manner in which this is done and the view that is taken makes it well worth the time. The killings are done in a very tasteful manner - it is appropriate for children of nearly all ages (granted children under 10 probably won't enjoy this movie, but preteens and beyond are easily able to follow and enjoy). As I said in the beginning, the movie does not result to sexual innuendos or sexuality or foul language, drugs, violence etc to be the entertainment - it relies on the story. This is an area I greatly feel that Hollywood should get back to, those items do not enhance a story and for many they often ruin what could otherwise be a great family movie. Some complain that the movie does not focus on the games as much and does not accurately portray the violence, but I believe that the violence is rightfully suggested and does not need blood and gore to get the point across when children 12-18 are dying in a battle - it's brutal - I GET IT! THANK YOU for not making me uncomfortable watching that! It's not about the deaths, it's about the story, the victor, and believing in something worth believing in.",1370908800,,3474,4.213213213213213
4944601,3,B0063FQREO,"Action was okay but there was barely enough details to string together to make sense of this movie.  I suppose it might of been better if i had read the book and already knew the story.  I assume by the ending that there are plans for a 2nd movie, I doubt I will watch it if it gets made.",1370908800,,288,3.864406779661017
4944602,4,B0063FQREO,"I'm tempted to rate three stars on this because it wasn't a very original story. It's derivative of so many stories I've read or heard or watched before, such as the movie Battle Royale, the book and films of Lord of the Flies, the well-known short story The Lottery (written by Shirley Jackson), the film Logan's Run, and many others.

I'm giving it four stars because, though unoriginal, it's still an enjoyable movie. I liked it, in other words (though I didn't love it). Jennifer Lawrence is certainly capable of inhabiting this role, and it doesn't hurt that she is attractive. The special effects weren't over-the-top or annoying. The fashion was annoying, in my opinion, but I'm sure it's not easy for an author and production team to predict what trends would exist in an unlikely future. Woody Harrelson was, as usual, fun to watch. Other supporting cast members performed their roles well enough.

I might watch the sequel, but I don't think I'll be going out of my way to see it. I'll probably wait until it hits Amazon Prime or Netflix or whatever service I'm able to afford.",1370908800,,1087,4.71578947368421

4944611,4,B0063FQREO,"Let me start by saying, I've never read the books(s). I watched the movie with fresh eyes not knowing what to expect except that kids were going to die.

The quality of the film production was amazing. The story had some ""flaws"" that I just couldn't wrap my head around. I could elaborate but I would be revealing some spoilers to those who would still like to watch the movie. Just be prepared for actions taken in the film not only by the kids trying to be the sole winner, but also the people running the games to boost ratings.

In all, I'm glad I watched it as now I can tell others I finally did. I'm in no rush to see the sequel if it ever comes out. Did it? I'm also glad it was ""free"" to watch with my Amazon Prime subscription.",1370908800,,737,4.111111111111111

4944617,4,B0063FQREO,"The movie was good overall but the filming was poor. In the beginning the camera is constantly jiggling, moving up and down. I eventually got motion sickness. The books were far better than the movie. I hope the second movie is a bigger budget film so that they can improve on a few things. The acting was quite good. I was surprised at how much gore and blood they showed (though yes, it is a tough, violent message overall). I would have rated the film R if I had a say in it. I wouldn't recommend taking kids to it, but that's just me.",1370822400,,538,4.1826923076923075

It's a great movie that gets you hyped up for the sequels, some things i didn't like were just minor complaints like how they censor the deaths, or how Peeta didn't do that much. People expecting an action-packed movie will also be disappointed. Bottom line is the hunger games is a cool movie that definitely is a much watch as long as you appreciate for what it is.

4944626,4,B0063FQREO,Watched it because of its wide popularity.  Clearly made for young people and written from their point of view.  Outrageous character role for Stanley Tucci and he really gets into it.,1370736000,,184,4.903225806451613
4944627,5,B0063FQREO,"I really enjoyed this.  I didn't see it when it was all the rage.  I thought the story touched on some pretty major social problems that are pertinent in todays society (not just in the past or the future).  And like many of those people in the movie that didn't seem to ""get it"", I'm sure there are many in today's society that don't get it, that don't see that this is a caricature of today's society and various social attitudes.  Anyway it was a well thought out story.  I didn't read the book, so I can't say I know how the two compare, but I am now interested in reading the book.  The acting was well done and I felt that the cinematography was also good.",1370736000,,662,4.173228346456693

4944643,1,B0063FQREO,Not good. Plot was not properly thought out in some places.  I also can see why people compared it to another movie made in Japan. It did not seem as if it was written by someone living in this century.,1370649600,2,202,4.05

4944647,2,B0063FQREO,"For those of you born later than 1975, this movie may seem original, dark and moody, but to me it, it was just a blend of ""1984"" (oppressive government crushes the individual spirit), ""Rollerball"" (corporate world where only blood sports will keep society from rebellion), ""Logan's Run"" (youth culture is worshipped, but there's a terrible price to pay) and ""Soylent Green"" (world out of resources resorts to desperate measures). Not a single original thought in the whole movie. Throw in the virtual reality elements of the ""Matrix"" trilogy and some comic bits straight from ""The Fifth Element"" and you've got ""The Hunger Games."" I found it dull. Jennifer Lawrence is pretty, but that doesn't make the movie worth watching. I'm glad I didn't pay money to see this tired bag of science fiction cliches!",1370649600,,802,4.992537313432836

The movie led one to believe that society now acts with the hunger games mentality because it works for them. Over all the years the hunger games has existed no ounce of humanity has crept in to make the games barbaric and now all of a sudden here it is. So bottom line I thought it entertaining but hard to believe.,1370649600,,478,4.322222222222222

She is one of the VERY few of the ""elite' in Hollywood who I wouldn't mind inviting over my house for dinner.

My wife enjoyed it because of the above and the fact that the main character was a strong female.

I think the technology of the hunger games world as mostly a straight-forward extrapolation of what is already feasible, but their society was not at all believable, so I never really identified with the characters or their plight.  The excessive weirdness of some of the support characters just reinforced my feelings of remoteness from the movie.

The only thing that would have made it better would be to really commit to the premise and give it a hard R rating and just show little kids violently murdering each other. Then at least you could say it followed through on such a disturbing premise it was trying to convey. As it stands it's just dumb to me.,1370390400,,432,4.154761904761905
4944676,4,B0063FQREO,I just finished reading the Hunger Games today. I love the Jennifer Lawrence and Josh Hutcherson took their roles from the pages to the screen. Josh made Peeta very interesting character. As a supporting role Woody Harrelson was great. Jennifer's character grows as the movie moves. The movie has great action scenes. Even when you know who is going to die it takes you in. Must see movie.,1370390400,,389,4.735294117647059
4944677,5,B0063FQREO,This film was a good adaptation of the novel...and the pace was also great. I enjoyed the film very much and as one of Jennifer's first films it was entertaining. I recommend it highly...but know its strictly PG-17 material dealt with openly and honestly.,1370390400,,255,4.818181818181818

4944679,5,B0063FQREO,Read the book first and then watch the movie.  It is very close to the book but still worth watching even if it leaves out a few things.,1370390400,,136,3.857142857142857
4944680,5,B0063FQREO,Even better if you have Amazon Prime. They let you watch it without buying it. I don't see much need in owning movies these days but the price was reasonable and before this was available on Prime.,1370390400,,197,4.351351351351352
4944681,5,B0063FQREO,A little to much blood and guts for my taste (very little) but the storyline is compelling. Definitely an adult movie. Children should not be watching this.,1370390400,,156,4.814814814814815

The movie did absolutely nothing for me.  A big nada.  However, I must make two admissions, number one, I'm pushing 60 and number two, I do not like ""fantasy"" movies.  If one wants to see western Carolina scenery (along with a decent movie) then watch The Last of the Mohicans.  I guess some woman writer wrote a trilogy on this Hunger Games nonsense and made a mint.  Only in America.  If there is anything left in your cranium you might want to read a little Thomas Wolfe (the one from Asheville) or Charles Frazier (lives in Asheville).  Don't wast 2.5 hrs on this movie.

4944716,4,B0063FQREO,"I watched the movie before reading the book. I understand how the script for the movie had to be revised, and it wasn't bad at all. Despite narrating differences, I think the movie conveyed the ""main"" story well---cruel dictatorship in Panem and oppression in 12 districts. Violence during the Game was soften too, considering how it happened in the book.

However, the movie left out a lot of backgrounds and relationships. I started the book because there were things in the movie that I needed to fill the blank. For example, Katniss' father wasn't mentioned earlier in the movie; he just popped up when Katniss recalled his death. I found out from the book that he gave her skills to survive---hunting, trading, finding edible plants, etc. Moreover, her relationship with her father and his death shaped Katniss characteristics.

To me, this story (and the whole series)is a complete version of Battle Royale. If you could see the point of the story, I think it's a good movie to watch. If you think it's purely violent, steer clear from it. Either way, I won't let young kids watch this movie.",1370217600,,1098,4.804232804232805

Movie has a flow and engages the viewer yet has the usual cast of only utilizing beautiful people do enthralling, interesting, and dangerous tasks.  Production wise it was a bit glossy compared to the book, but a movie audience full of kids do not care about production only the entertainment factor. During the movie She loses her tree rope in an earlier explosion scene then has it again. She had a spool of wire that she could have tied to an arrow to aim at, then reel the items to her, instead she resorted to the plethora of dumped apples into the minefield. She never questions Peeta for why he was leading the patrol of kids to find and kill her. Where does she keep getting all the arrows?",1370217600,,776,4.315068493150685

I give 5 stars for the effort, the acting and the decisions that were made in creating this film (except for Peeta -- he is so different from my mental image of him!). What gets lost in the movie version is the characterizations of the combatants and the beauty team in the capitol, the relationships Katniss has with her father and mother, and the background information about the districts.

Set in future time, The Hunger Games takes us to outrageous exploitation of the poor by the rich and powerful, and demonstrates that the weak and poor themselves may have the power to end their exploitation, simply by refusing to continue playing the game. On another dimension The Hunger Games also suggested to me the nature of war: the children of the poor sent off to kill and be killed for the benefit of the powerful.

4944742,3,B0063FQREO,"SPOILER ALERT:

The storyline in the movie had a few changes I didn't agree with, such as the origin of the Mockingjay pin, some variations of the characteristics of the three main characters (physical) and president Snow, and the addition of scenes from other districts which, during the time of the hunger games, Katniss knew nothing about. But overall, they did a much better job sticking to the story and the ideals behind the books than WB did with Rowling's last three Harry Potter films.

There is one thing, however, that was changed, in order to appeal more to love sick teenagers, and that was the amount of violence portrayed in the movie. Fight scenes were very abbreviated, and little or not brutality was shown during the movies themselves. Much was left to the imagination after brief encounters between tributes. I personally am not one to crave violence in television or movies, but this was such an intricate part of the books and was used to show just how far society has gone (is going) over the edge of what should be considered right and wrong, that to ignore it the way the writers, producers, and directors did is a complete injustice to author and the series.

Putting that aside, the acting was fair, with Woody Harrelson portraying Haymitch perfectly. Overall, it is a decent movie, definitely worth watching, but don't expect the same emotional turmoil that you had when you read the novels, because those feelings just won't be there.",1370044800,,1463,4.820717131474104

Many people I respect raved about it and I've heard people use parts of it as illustrations for real life political happenings.

4944840,5,B0063FQREO,"I can't even begin to say what a great surprise The Hunger Games was. Having recently finished the novel, I had concerns over how the film would adapt the first-person narrative, filled with introspection by the protagonist Katniss Everdeen and flashbacks to earlier in her life. What's great about the movie: they didn't try to do that.

Instead, we have a remarkably directed, almost dreamlike flow through the story. The film travels briskly from scene to scene, organically blending in backstory that is easy to miss if you aren't paying attention. Rather than filling in the exposition through explanation, as the novel does, we are given the dystopic scenario and the formation of the Hunger Games through news broadcasts of the current year's Games. None of this feels forced or even too heavily reinforced.

The Hunger Games is the rare film for children / young adults that trusts that the audience is an intelligent and mature one. It counts on the audience to pay attention, as names and details fly by in quick succession. There is very little sweet or sugarcoated about this world, and the movie doesn't bother to dwell on that. The color palette is filled with bleak greys and blacks, with some very intense sequences of violence (which honestly made me wonder how on earth this movie scraped past an R rating and instead earned a PG-13).

In addition to its disturbing content, this film is also noteworthy for its strong performances. Jennifer Lawrence (as always!) is fantastic as the lead character, and pairs well with her semi-love interest Josh Hutcherson, who also gives a well-restrained and believable performance.

Following in the tradition of Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire, The Hunger Games is so effective because it feels as authentic as it possibly could. Given the fantastical elements that are embedded in the story, everything else, from the characters' dialogue, the scenery, and even the wobbly first-person camera work, ring true.

The Hunger Games is an excellent start to what I hope will be a solid film series. It is such an unusual concept for a major studio to pursue, and I welcome its confidence to present a film experience that is disturbing, harsh, and most importantly, believable.",1369440000,7,2235,4.981233243967829
4944841,4,B0063FQREO,well done presentation of a good book.  Cannot wait for book two.  Actress who plays Katness is not quiet as athletic appearing as the character in the book.,1369440000,,157,4.571428571428571
4944842,4,B0063FQREO,"While the quality of the video devilered is satisfactory, the movie itself does not live up to the book completely. Nevertheless, if you liked the Hunger Games, you will enjoy this movie.",1369440000,,187,4.875

4944844,4,B0063FQREO,I didn't read the book but my niece loved both the book and the movie so I watched the movie. It was better than I expected and I would will probably watch it again. I would recommend this movie.,1369440000,,195,4.0256410256410255
4944845,1,B0063FQREO,"very disappointed in the film, I found it to be one dimensional as well as being terribly written-- the camera took far too many close-ups and was never pointed where I wanted it to be, very disappointed.
My advice: stick with the book!",1369440000,4,236,4.511627906976744

poorly directed i would say
the acting wasn't all that either, the bad guys were especially poor
good ending",1369440000,,134,4.869565217391305
4944847,4,B0063FQREO,"Enjoyed the story a lot, but the narration is lacking. I felt this story could have used a third person narration & have been better off. Also, the fragments are a little overdone and takes away the impact they should be making. I'd recommend it to anyone not picky about structure.",1369440000,,282,4.549019607843137
4944848,4,B0063FQREO,"The film didn't have the visual pageantry of the book (e.g., the book's flame costumes were better than the film's). On the other hand the science fiction elements were better expressed (e.g., the invisible flyers felt like an uncomfortable, unconsidered plot element).",1369440000,,269,5.428571428571429

4944850,1,B0063FQREO,"The acting was great, in the cinematography was wonderful. But the premise and plot storyline and outcome of the movie was not something that I would want to watch.",1369440000,4,164,4.689655172413793
4944851,5,B0063FQREO,"Sad story. Although it's depicted as a fictional story it is the reality of what our lives are like now, people going into war killing people strangers. THe film itself is done really well. The cinematography, edit, and the impact they make with the contrasting costumes",1369440000,,270,4.891304347826087
4944852,5,B0063FQREO,i was pleasantly surprised by this movie. i did not expect it to be so good.loved the unique storyline. looking forward to the next one.,1369440000,,136,4.48

4944856,2,B0063FQREO,i did not like the concept of the movie... few sequence and actions in the movie are quite unrealistic.. lot of violence scenes.,1369440000,,128,4.608695652173913
4944857,3,B0063FQREO,The movie was ok. I enjoyed the books much more. Sometimes when you read the book you picture things differently than in the movie.,1369440000,,131,4.5
4944858,4,B0063FQREO,"Read the book and recently saw the movie.  The movie mirrors the book pretty well.  The futuristic hairdos and costumes were a little overdone but overall, theme was good.",1369440000,,171,4.862068965517241
4944859,5,B0063FQREO,It was cleverly filmed and of course the story is compelling. I will very likely take the time to watch it again.,1369440000,,113,4.181818181818182
4944860,4,B0063FQREO,Because I liked the movie a lot. There isn't anything I did like about the movie. I would definitely recommend this movie,1369440000,,121,4.545454545454546
4944861,3,B0063FQREO,"Not horrible, but not stellar. My husband liked it more than me. I wouldn't watch it a second time or any sequels that come out.  For all the hype, it was underwhelming.",1369440000,,169,4.28125
4944862,5,B0063FQREO,"Almost as good as the book.  Have watched it twice now.  I lent the book more emotions as I read it, and it did not elaborate on the extreme poverty and need of Katniss life, just a bit so you got a hint.  Very good movie.",1369440000,,222,3.782608695652174
4944863,4,B0063FQREO,"The movie keeps you engaged. It is an action movie, but the main character is not Rambo and shows her soul and character. Thoughtful portrait of the show business.",1369440000,,163,4.655172413793103
4944864,4,B0063FQREO,not a new theme but very well done with action and love surprises and thought provoking scenes.a good surprise ending.,1369440000,,118,4.95
4944865,5,B0063FQREO,"After listening to the trilogy of the Hunger Games, I decided to get this movie. I hadn't watched it when it came out because there were too many negative comments on the shaking of the camera in the action scenes....when movies do this, I get a severe headache....well, I didn't find the camera movement anymore than any other movie. I loved this movie!",1369353600,,354,4.634920634920635
4944866,5,B0063FQREO,"My son talked me into going with him to it. It was actually required reading. After watching it, we already had the Kindle editions so I read those too. I was very pleased.",1369353600,,172,4.242424242424242
4944867,5,B0063FQREO,I watched it twice my kids loved it. I like movies that show you the follies that could be our world in the future.,1369353600,,115,3.8333333333333335
4944868,3,B0063FQREO,"Good movie that stayed close to the book plot. I'm looking forward to the sequels.  Had to watch in SD because I don't have an ""approved"" HD device.",1369353600,,148,4.285714285714286

4944872,5,B0063FQREO,This movie kept us interested to what would happen next. Movie is a little long. Wish I had read the book first.,1369267200,,112,4.136363636363637
4944873,5,B0063FQREO,this was exciting from start to finish! The whole family  was totally engrossed with it! We will watch it again!,1369267200,,112,4.6
4944874,2,B0063FQREO,"I don't like this film at all. I hate to think that this is such a hit with kids. Are we so cold and distant from this concept that we don't see the murder going on in this movie? These are children killing children. YIKES! I'm sorry, but I don't get the enjoyment of this movie at all!",1369267200,,286,3.9482758620689653
4944875,4,B0063FQREO,"The movie, for the most part has stuck to the novel.  There were a couple of things that I think were missed but that  always happens with movie renditions of books.  It's good entertainment and if you already read the books it will give you a motion view of what you read in the book. I don't know about you but book to movie conversions seem to be rushed in the story telling and lack detail. The movie is good ,but I recommend you view it with an open mind if you already read the novel.",1369267200,,490,4.083333333333333
4944876,4,B0063FQREO,Although i did not read the book I did enjoy the move as an action junkie.  It was too easy to predict what was going to happen.,1369267200,,128,3.740740740740741
4944877,5,B0063FQREO,Grabs the viewer quickly and has a fast moving story. Well done but the plot is scary to think about.,1369267200,,101,4.1
4944878,5,B0063FQREO,"Unexpected charactes and effects. The movie closely followed the book, but offered enough twists to keep me interested. I recommend this movie.",1369267200,,143,5.545454545454546
4944879,5,B0063FQREO,Very good movie!  It showed how that the strength of one girl in the face of extraordinary obstacles because of the love she had for her sister whom she was protecting from having to go to the hunger games.  It showed her forgiveness toward a boy who was also chosen from her poor town (sector) after he teamed up with the rich group who had been chosen.  This movie brings many different emotions.,1369267200,2,398,4.424657534246576
4944880,4,B0063FQREO,This was better than I expected.  A lot of great scenes.  I like a movie where I don't always know what will happen next.  This movie kept you on your toes for sure.  Would watch it again and recommend it to others!,1369267200,,215,4.0476190476190474

4944888,3,B0063FQREO,"It should be interesting for people who like Twilight.
It's clear, that make movie after book is really hard. Just not enough screen time.
Actors are good, but the whole 'game' thing... well, Romans perfected bloody sport to death. This futuristic one is not that 'entertaining'....",1369180800,,282,5.1521739130434785
4944889,3,B0063FQREO,The characters were not developed; the personalities were not really as per the description in the book. This movie did not engage the viewer as the book. It might be a good action movie for those who did not read the book but if you were excited about watching what you read you will be disappointed by it. It doesn't move me to want to see the sequels.,1369180800,,354,4.220588235294118

4944892,3,B0063FQREO,"I didn't feel like I wasted my time by watching this movie but it also wasn't one of those amazing movie experiences that sticks with you.

I put this movie in the same category as movies like The Island, Gattica, or even Children of Men (dystopian or alternative futures) and I think this is just below par in that league.

However, I can appreciate people who have read the book and thus are partial to the movie.",1369180800,,415,4.376623376623376
4944893,4,B0063FQREO,"I was expecting something different when I started watching this movie.  The first 20 minutes took me somewhere that I didn't expect to go.  It eventually settled in to more of what I had envisioned.  Very beautiful visually, particularly the contrast between home, the city, and the arena.  Jennifer Lawrence, Woody Harrelson, and Wes Bentley were phenomenal.

I wish that Closed Captioning would become available for Sony products.  I have a condition that makes it very hard to decipher conversation.",1369180800,,503,5.225
4944894,4,B0063FQREO,"Action packed and gruesome, similar to the novel.  Such a tragic tale. Missing some of the desperation felt while reading the book.",1369180800,,131,4.954545454545454
4944895,3,B0063FQREO,"The Hunger Games is OK, more for the teenage set than for an adult.

It is a bit predictable, namely the attractive idealistic youth beset upon by the cruel oppression of a fascist/communist state.

The movie is a bit over the top, with a mix of socialist reality and Hollywood glamour and TV talk show.
However, the story does get one thinking about life, society, government, and the cinematography is good, with much time spent in the forest--as the selected 24 murder each other one by one--and what could be bad about the forest?

Overall, it's okay for an evening's entertainment.",1369180800,,586,4.782178217821782

4944897,3,B0063FQREO,"To me this was a formula B grade movie.  The story line was typical; the costumes cheesy and the ending oh so predictable.  The whole thing seemed like something that you would see on network TV on Sunday afternoon.  My friends tell me that I am not the target audience and that the film was made for kids.  However, kids have a more sophisticated media palate than adults so serving them up this pablum and calling it art seems a disservice to the nations youth.  If you ask me (an you did) I think some marketing genius saw how popular the Harry Potter series was and is trying to repeat the success with the Hunger Games series.

Watch it if you want, but borrow a copy.  Don't waste your money.",1369180800,,698,4.323076923076923

4944901,5,B0063FQREO,"This film is full of excitement and adventure.the protagonist, Catness Everdeen, makes for a brave, love able, rebellious character. She and her friends take on the dismall conditions of Americas future with courage and a new, brighter future! It was well acted and beautiful direction.  This is not a film for small children but should be viewed by EVERYONE!!!!!!!",1369008000,,365,5.186440677966102

4944903,5,B0063FQREO,"The movie did not disappoint me.  True, I did not expect much, but even so I was pleasantly surprised.  It was hard to suspend disbelief, because the main premise, that a future government forced children to participate in annual games to the death, is pretty much unbelievable.  But once I got past that, the movie seemed to work.  The acting was great, the dialogue sounded right, and the response to the various dangers seemed consistent.  Positive values were compassion, courage, and resourcefulness.  Unfortunately there is no hint of a Supreme Being, no faith, no spiritual aspect at all.  But it serves to warn us of the sheer evil that a totally secular regime is capable of (not that we need it, after the repeated horrors of the 20th century).  It was sad to see the heroine crying like a person who has no hope -- apparently she has no faith, and no hope.  But we see that kind of despair around us every day, among those who have not yet come to faith in Christ.",1369008000,,975,4.525714285714286
4944904,4,B0063FQREO,Really enjoyed this adaptation of the book. Jennifer Lawrence and the other actors truly make you care about Katniss and Peeta as they try and win the Hunger Games.  It is an entertaining and enjoyable story of good triumphing over evil.,1369008000,,237,4.780487804878049

4944908,4,B0063FQREO,"My favorite about this movie was watching the scenes and costumes worn in this movie.  I find it very creative.  I've never read the book so I have nothing to compare it by.  But, it's a decent PG-13 show and I think the acting was good.",1368921600,,237,4.108695652173913
4944909,5,B0063FQREO,Selecting this video as my choice to watch was sorta like going on a blind date. I didn't imagine this video would provide me with such delightful entertainment. Jennifer Lawrence is a beautiful talented actress that I would like to see more often.,1368921600,,248,4.790697674418604
4944910,5,B0063FQREO,Watched 2nd time on our Prime membership as it was free and enjoyed it as much as the first time.  That is amazing for us,1368921600,,121,3.84
4944911,5,B0063FQREO,"This book has the dubious premise that in a post-apocalypse North America, various districts are required to annually send two young people (a boy and a girl) to fight to the death in a sort of high-tech coliseum.  The movie does celebrate such positive values as courage and compassion, and the hedonism that finds such a spectacle entertaining is shown as corruption.
Unfortunately, there is no concept of God shown, and no uplifting spiritual values are shown.  There is no hint that any of the participants believe in any sort of afterlife.  The heroine is showing as weeping inconsolably after the death of a young girl.  She cries as one that has no hope, because she apparently has no concept of a Higher Power.
But the film shows what a Godless society is capable of, and thus gives us an important warning to us.  This is what we as a nation can become if we reject faith in God and His Son, Jesus Christ.",1368921600,,914,4.548780487804878
4944912,3,B0063FQREO,It took me a long time to even want to watch this. Very sad bleak story line. But as far as the acting and scenery goes it was very good. Thankfully it was not as graphic as I feared it might be. I do plan on seeing the upcoming sequel.,1368921600,,236,3.74
4944913,5,B0063FQREO,"I found the movie to be amazing. I hadn't read the books prior to seeing the movie, however it did inspire me to purchase the book trilogy.

4944914,3,B0063FQREO,I never really got over the premise.  Who cares about a society like that?  This story could have been several times as compelling had the districts randomly selected criminals.,1368921600,,177,5.068965517241379
4944915,3,B0063FQREO,"It was a decent movie, but not great in my opinion.  There simply was not enough of a set up as to why things were the way they were. Not enough character development, not enough background on the whole premise of the movie.",1368921600,,224,4.209302325581396

4944918,4,B0063FQREO,"It clearly is the adaptation of a lo get book and of a book for teens. The story is disjoint and it is hard to follow the setup of the dystopian world. The plot is simplistic(you don't quite see how the alliances form), the actors ok.
Not an Oscar movie, but a good evening of entertainment. One more thing: some scenes are overly violent. This is not a children movie.",1368921600,,369,4.285714285714286

The story is a bit dark and there are a few scenes that are brutal, but overall it's a thrilling movie. The end is a bit weak and there are a couple of other scenes that are weak as well, but I'd still recommend it.",1368921600,,343,4.0588235294117645

4944923,2,B0063FQREO,The movie was a big let down compared to all the hype. She wasn't a scared child or a brave warrior. It was lame.,1368921600,,113,3.75
4944924,5,B0063FQREO,"It's rare that I enjoy a book based film as a good retelling of the book itself.  The Lord of the Rings movies, as an example, were all fine fantasy movies on their own but I thought they did a poor overall job retelling the books.  Yes you get the idea...bad guy makes bad ring, little guy goes on a quest to destroy the bad ring.  But 'getting the idea' doesn't make the movie a good retelling any more than my description was.

The Hunger Games, on the other hand, was a marvelous retelling of the book.  Yes you will still find differences (Katness finding the Mockingjay pin at a marketplace rather than getting it as a gift from the mayors daughter - who was cut entirely from the story). But most every important aspect seemed in place and well told.

If this surprises anyone, it shouldn't.  This is the kind of magic that can be accomplished when the movie producers work closely with the books author.  Hope they do as well with Catching Fire.",1368921600,,953,4.405714285714286

First, there's a ""rub your nose in it"" not at all subliminal ""haves vs. have nots"" statement and virtually everything else is fairly predictable. However, for all of the predictable action scenes there still seems to be no satisfactory conclusion to the story.
Perhaps this is a consequence of there being no substantial ""story"" to begin with. Rather, this seems like an idea that had layers of entertaining action added on with no more thought given to a plot line. Maybe there's more to come.",1368835200,,531,4.782608695652174

4944940,3,B0063FQREO,Very wooden acting. Poor casting. Limited backstory on every character.  Seemed like the producers were more interested in selling tickets to the follow-on movies than this one.  Definitely couldn't stand on its own merits.  Special effects were not very good.,1368748800,,260,5.45
4944941,1,B0063FQREO,"I was interested to see this movie, brought to me by the lovely partnering of Amazon and Roku, but what a disappointment!  I couldn't tell if it was deliberately comedic, or just such an overwrought, silly story line that it was aimed at a much younger age group (tweens?).  The plot revolves around ""tributes"" (children aged 12-18) who are brought to the Utopian/Dystopian capital of a nation, to fight to the death, for the entertainment of the watching masses (think Survivor, but much less forgiving).  Now, aside from the utterly absurd idea that anyone would EVER do this, or would WATCH it, this plot has gigantic holes that you could drive a Hummer through.

The main character does things like make a fire and feed a smaller girl (one of her competitors to be ""the one"" to live), despite knowing full well that other contestants have been tracked and killed by lighting fires.  When another contestant is killed, the heroine takes the time to lay her out, collect FLOWERS and decorate her poor corpse with them, despite the fact that she's still being hunted by a pack of competitors.  (Uh...really?).  She's supposed to be in what any professional pilot would call a ""mission-critical"" environment--every action has potential consequences, but she behaves like she IS on Survivor, and some host will be along any second to fix the situation.

There's some very callous and questionable actions--is she genuinely interested in her ""co-star"" from her District, or simply using him for the benefit of the all-present cameras?--and as I said, not even in a jaded world can I conceive of anyone thinking a television show where child contestants beat each other's brains out is a viable prospect.  The movie just stops--doesn't ""end,"" and it's abundantly clear that there's other movies to come, to finish the (lame) storyline, which, OF COURSE, will have some monumental revolution started because of some action by this GIRL, who quite honestly, pretty much didn't deserve to survive.

I found it impossible to suspend disbelief; not even the mighty Stanley Tucci, whom I adore, could save this piece of dreck.  Woody Harrelson is actually the best actor in the piece (saying a lot), and delivered on his role, although it didn't seem to be much of a stretch.  Donald Sutherland seems to be phoning it in, playing the ubiquitous ""evil leader.""  The stormtroopers are dressed like, well, stormtroopers. Everything is so cliched, so predictable, so hackneyed...won't be looking for either the sequel movies, nor will I be reading the books.

4944944,4,B0063FQREO,"This was filmed near where I live and the scenery is awesome.  I enjoyed the story and characters but they were not developed enough to get me really intrigued.  I think the movie had some potentially touching and emotional moments, but these were somewhat undermined by a dependence on special effects and not enough focus on the individuals.  I really wish they had put more emphasis and closure on the romance between the main character and her man back home.

4944945,5,B0063FQREO,The movie was great.  Story followed the book line nicely.  But seeing the gore and reading about it are different.  I prefer to read but the move was very good.

The movie itself proved to be more interesting than I expected and also longer. It was the typical good triumphs over evil scenario with a predictable finale but was entertaining none the less. While some of the technology used seems far fetched science fiction, I suspect some of it already exists and more will in the future. As I was watching it I had some flashbacks to the move Truman whose life was also a reality show. I also thought of ""big brother"" who is always watching us and in the case of this movie plot manipulating our experiences.

All in all, this movie is worth seeing but be prepared for a longer than typical experience.",1368748800,,837,4.358974358974359

4944950,5,B0063FQREO,This is a good action movie with a few twists and turns added for entertainment. The actress was really good. I would like to see more if they make another movie about this story line.,1368662400,,184,4.285714285714286
4944951,1,B0063FQREO,"Where to begin..

I waited for the hype to settle before watching this film. I knew the majority of movie goers loved it like it was a Shakespearean classic, and I didn't want to ruin my experience by believing it was a cinematic masterpiece, nor did I want to be overly disappointed by the opinions of the few critics out there (and there are so few). I did the right thing- I listened to neither. So, with a clean slate, I started my 2 hour and some odd minute journey with a clear head. Coffee in hand, I sat through oh, 4 minutes, before I realized it wasn't going to get any better.

The empty connections between sisters and friends, the blatant and in your face ""we're so starved and poor"" setting, and the script that spells out the conditions of this other world without allowing the viewer to feel that impact themselves, was already a bad start. Yet, I held out hope for other aspects of this film. Excellent graphics-so sharp you could tell they weren't real. Costumes so absurd that you noticed the absence of substance even in the evil, rich people- I couldn't even hate them, there was so little to hate them for. I simply couldn't buy into this version of elitism. The vicious fights to the death that panned away, with the least amount of bloodshed for such graphic means of death. The romance between two people whom I was sure had met only days before (they really grew up together?), looking at each other more as the neighbor down the street rather than the love of one another's life. I wanted them to eat the berries. And most importantly, the outrage from the districts for being used as entertainment- scratch that, no one seemed pissed about that at all- even though they all felt that way (the script told me that, not the actual people in these horrific conditions).

The icing on this poorly thrown together film, was at the very end. What does one do when they win a tournament so vicious that life could never be the same? They go home. The end.

I honestly felt nothing from this film- nothing. I couldn't cheer for these kids, not a one. Not even the little girl (though she actually did a good job in her role- well done), because of the lack of a heart felt bond between her and Katniss. The scenario of these tournaments and their origins from the rebellion didn't even feel authentic. Who would invent this game as a means of control?? Not even in fiction would a story like this actually make sense. Maybe in book it did, but not in film. Not like this.

I do realize that this was a family, blockbuster film, made purely for money, but come on! Couldn't they have tried to make it a little bit real? Maybe cause a sensation of something other than despair for having to sit through it. I wanted to feel outrage for their horrible circumstances, I wanted to feel the injustice that would be real in this society, but it seemed intentionally filmed and written to avoid any realism at all. Such a good story line wasted on the motto ""asses in the seats"".

If you're looking for a popcorn action film that you'll forget within 6 months, this is definitely something you'll enjoy. I'm not saying there's anything wrong with that. Dumb films can be fun! But, if you wanted a good story told well, this is not the place wherein it exists. At the very least, don't expect much.

Oh, the woods where this all took place was pretty. Liked the cinematography. Other than that..time to forget this ever happened.",1368662400,40,3440,4.485623003194888
4944952,4,B0063FQREO,"I give it 4 stars, because the action was well done and the story moved along quickly and didn't seem to drag. The story seemed to follow the book fairly well.",1368662400,,159,4.161290322580645

4944961,4,B0063FQREO,"I didn't read any of the books, yet.  I wanted to keep an open mind.  I can't say that the premise is an original concept.  I've seen a few B movies that feature reality TV while people kill each other.  I don't remember the names of all the movies, but one is called a A Cabin in the Woods.  Also, this reminded me a little of Hostel.  I appreciate that this movie gets you to think.  What is going on in our world currently that mimics this?  Wars, disposable disenfranchised people, etc..

What makes this a good movie?  SPOILER ALERT:
This movie portrays going against what is expected, in a good way.  Katniss crosses many lines.
People skills and life skills examples - it's who you know (you have to make friends with sponsors).
Feminine empowerment - Katniss got an 11/12, either the highest score, or one of the highest scores.
Dignity - Katniss didn't actually kill people.  She let nature take it's course.  She cut down the wasp hive.  At the end she killed someone being ravaged by dogs to put him out of his misery.
Survival skills (camouflage technique).
Love and camaraderie.  Doing the right thing.  Katniss protected Rue and Rue protected Katniss.

This movie touches you on a heart level - that's what makes it good, decent, and wholesome.",1368662400,,1258,4.594594594594595

It was a bit dark because it is about children killing each other but the leadup to the actual games does not make it seem as morbid.  I liked most of the actors.

I'll probably watch the sequel based on the first movie.",1368576000,,424,4.121951219512195

The movie was ""okay"", but really disappointed in how much they missed.  Peeta's charcter I thought was one of the weakest, perhaps poor acting.... Jennifer Lawrence was fabulous.  The movie/story just was so lacking. :(  Since I read the books, of course I will watch all the movies.  I just hope that they get the 2nd and 3rd one right.",1368576000,,464,4.411764705882353

Good now that we have that out of the way I will tell you what I think keep in mind this is my opinion and as such you can take or leave it. Okay I hate it..... Well I can't just say that can I. I have take my time, oh I'm sorry more of my time to make sure that no one else suffers the two hours of bad acting, terrible CGI, poor character development, and not to mention an illogical story line/setting.

This is not a spoiler so our story takes place in the future, sounds fun right wrong it like something out of Ray Bradbury's Fahrenheit 451 only with a death sports theme, no references to books in relation to the death of the love of knowledge and knowledge seeking like in Fahrenheit 451 (I love that book just making analogy to the totalitarian state in that book and in this movie),  and a lack of me giving a crap about the conflict between the protagonist and the government (and as we all know they are the type of futuristic government that is corrupt, infringing on freedom of anything, and full of no good reason to be evil other than because the story line needs a poorly written mustache twirling villain(they are dying commodity aren't they, mustache twirling villains that is) inserted into that generic fill in the blank here spot trope).

CGI is brief, lazy, badly done, and looked computer animated. When the CGI looks computer animated there is a problem (except of course if your movie is TRON but in that case I'd be more worried about stagnating and having a bad story).

Moving on a broad view of the story and not it's enactments by the antagonists. Well maybe a little more, but more on positive note. Does anyone know the origins of the the word decimation, well if you do I'm telling you anyway. Decimation comes from the system of punishment for deserters of the roman army where for every ten men that deserted one would be killed as punishment and an example to the remaining soldiers that were allowed to live. Why do bring this up, well because the whole death game concept actually isn't bad just poorly written and executed.

to finish up character development I felt nothing, no emotion, after, the whole good bye scene, the rest nothing the little girl that saves the protagonist life nothing, the love scene looked forced even from the stand point that it probably was forced in the original book context. So that's about it I would go into more detail but well I guess the movies just is not worth it, I suppose it is not bad, but it's not that good either and for a 2 hour movie to be just okay uh well it really wasn't worth my time, maybe the books better I don't know.

one last book reference I would like to see a modern day female protagonist like Patricia C. Wrede's princess Cimorene, strong, charming, intelligent, and sure of herself without trying so hard to fit the strong female protagonist role in other words a natural female protagonist. For the first time and not the last hopefully this is the draconian of a critic wishing you happy movie viewings.",1368403200,,3234,4.425210084033614

Hunger Games is a well, above the standard B-grade movie, without the accuracy and expansion of a Steven Spielberg production, yet colorful and partly unpredictable enough to hold interest. Although slightly beyond reality, the theme does suggest a distant possibility and leaves a residue of though relating to todays survival. Perhaps targeted toward an age group, but relative to all. Even if you are a low life peon, from a dirtbag community, but the heart of a champion beats within you, you are a survivor. And with a little luck, from being a good guy, you will prevail.

4945079,4,B0063FQREO,"when the hunger games played theaters in march it posted the biggest opening in history for a movie released outside of summer. while there is no direct correlation between box office success and quality, the numbers are worth reporting, especially the hunger games is a blockbuster that is actually good. truth told 2012 has been an excellent year for blockbuster movies. the avengers and the dark knight rises also boast a nice mix of quality spectacle and audience approval, but it was the hunger games that got the ball rolling. as impressive as the box office totals are, they probably weren't a surprise to fans of suzanne collins' hunger games novels. the books are breakout hits in multiple countries, meaning the movie reached theaters with a built in audience. the hunger games is the first entry in collins' three story set, which takes place in panem, a post apocalyptic version of north america. the country comprises a wealthy capital city and 12 poverty stricken districts. as penance for past rebellion, each district is forced to sacrifce one boy and one girl to and annual gladiator like contest known as the hunger games. the contest is televised much like today's reality tv programs, but the stakes are much higher than survivor or the bachelor. in this game show, the contestants fight to the death.
 the heroine of the film is katniss everdeen (jennifer lawerence) a smart athletic 16 year old who volunteers for the games as a replacement for her meek younger sister, who was chosen by lottery. as the movie progresses, director gary ross (seabiscuit and pleasentville) walks viewers through katniss' journey, step by step. first, the contestants are treated like celebrities as they're trotted onto talk shows for all of panem to see. then, they get a brief introduction to combat and survival skills before being thrown into a massive outdoor arena where they must fight each other and number of artificially constructed dangers.

two sequels are planned in this series and this one is worth picking up and watching. if you have not seen it get this movie. if you have read the books get the movie. this movie is worth getting",1368144000,,2152,4.90934065934066
4945080,2,B0063FQREO,"Too much violence.
The hi tech sci-fi world versus still slavery of districts are two contrast combinations
Just a replica of old roman time movies with gladiator etl being redone with science fiction

Fundamentally the Idea of killing for survival in PG13 does not sound appropraite...
If it is something like fighting and killing aliens or other fictional characters to protect humans some what goes ok, but idea of humans killing humans makes it uncomfortable to watch

Only drawback is what I consider a lack of righteous indignation and anger at the oppressive government that celebrates this yearly slaughter.  The ending was an obvious setup to a sequel.

Why did these districts rebel?  Why are they numbered 1-12?  Real lack of history in the movie.  It's probably explained in the book, but it's not very well explained in the movie.  Characters, as individuals, are unrealistic in their reactions to the situations they're forced into; a lot gaps in the plot, world, and characters.  Also for an all powerful Orwellian government, it's not very impressive.  Dudes with weird safety glasses and batons are not scary wheras FLIR is very scary.  HL2 did it better than this and that's a flippin video game.  I watched this movie hoping to be impressed like I was with Harry Potter, but I was not.  There is no richness or originality to the story.  There is no tragedy when the the subject matter flippin begs for it.

As usual, most of the details were left out, so you don't get to know the characters very well. However, they did do a good job of conveying the basic storyline and they did keep the movie moving along.

One good thing was that they took a lot of the gore out of the movie and it didn't detract too much from the storyline. Seeing children killing children wouldn't make for good theater.

I simply cannot believe that this is what passes for teen inspiration and role models today. Oh, wait a minute: yes, I can believe that our bloodthirsty culture industry will peddle this kind of crap to passive consumers. The messages contained in this film are horrifying: who on earth came up with the idea that kids killing kids creates winners and heroes? Sounds like a great idea for terrorists...

In my mind, there is absolutely nothing redeeming about this franchise, and I think the book author and everyone involved in this project are monstrous in that they greedily inflict these messages on teenagers: winning at any cost is good; killing bad teenagers is good; resistance is futile but noble in some pathetic way (as long as you still smile and wave for the camera); and ultimately, give the authorities what they want.

4945134,5,B0063FQREO,"This is a fabulous book for at risk kids and anyone else for that matter.  It is easily team taught language/government and creates all kinds of opportunities for talking about risk taking, relationships, government, women's roles, writing techniques, dystopian worlds, and the role of family.  There are very few books where young people can see how opportunity can come from what seems to be a tragedy.  For example, the death of Katniss's father makes her have to take on an adult role at an early age creating someone who could become a winner in the Hunger Games.  The movie and its discrepancies only add to the opportunities for discussion.  Adult themes but what young person at risk is not living a life of adult themes and hungering (pun intended) for hope?",1367712000,,767,4.824427480916031
4945135,5,B0063FQREO,I was glad the movie cut back on the violence that was in the book.  Definitely worth watching.  I watched it on my Kindle at the airport.,1367712000,,138,4.074074074074074
4945136,5,B0063FQREO,I love this movie. I can't wait for the second movie comes out so I can see it.  Would suggest anyone who likes action with a story line to watch this.,1367712000,,151,3.870967741935484
4945137,4,B0063FQREO,"I have to tell you that I did expect a little more from this movie since it was so hyped up. So, maybe you should add another star for my jaded point of view. With that being said, I think this movie was very well done in terms of plot, special effects and acting. I watched it to the end and didn't regret ""spending my hard earned hours and minutes"" doing so. The future is portrayed in a way that is not beyond belief and not so far fetched that you want to laugh. Instead, the future is extrapolated from our worst nightmares of war, ""have and have-nots"" and the oppression of the little people. It is kind of like a hi-tech serfdom. I think you'll like the setting. The characters are well defined and acted out well enough that you forget they are so young. There are enough twists and turns to keep you interested. With that being said....this movie deserves a solid 4 stars....maybe 5.",1367712000,,892,4.347305389221557
4945138,1,B0063FQREO,"Blue Ray stopped playing in the middle of the movie. Couldn't get back to the scene and watch it, Blue Ray always skipped. Returned item.",1367712000,,137,4.52
4945139,4,B0063FQREO,Could have used a little more length to be truer to the book.  Would have made a great mini series.,1367712000,,99,3.95
4945140,3,B0063FQREO,"A little under powered in the acting department, and of course the inevitable deployment of persons of color to reinforce the nobility of the heroine does get annoying. Or perhaps it's embarrassing. In any case it's a trope which outlived its usefulness years ago.",1367712000,,264,5.0227272727272725
4945141,4,B0063FQREO,"Interesting and enjoyable flick.  Kind of Romeo and Juliet and Gladiators and future shock all rolled into one.
The costuming was great as were special effects, We thought it was good  enjoy!",1367712000,,191,4.9375
4945142,5,B0063FQREO,"This is a great movie for anyone. My husband has not read the books and said the movie was great. I have read the books and I think the movie is geared toward the reader. If you want the most out of it, read first!",1367712000,,214,3.7777777777777777
4945143,4,B0063FQREO,Can't wait for the next installment!  This movie was thrilling and moving at the same time.  Didn't read the books but will follow the movie franchise.,1367712000,,151,4.769230769230769
4945144,5,B0063FQREO,Great movie! Really fun to watch with friends - especially after reading the book. I am looking forward to the next,1367712000,,115,4.523809523809524
4945145,3,B0063FQREO,Very good but not as good as book.  Lots of parts missing that were in the book.  Jennifer Lawrence is fabulous!,1367712000,,112,4.285714285714286
4945146,5,B0063FQREO,"Very suspenseful. The lead character, Katniss, impressed me enough to name my new Siamese cat after her, Catness. The alternate spelling seemed appropriate.",1367712000,,156,5.826086956521739
4945147,2,B0063FQREO,What a horrifyingly bad investment of over 2 hours.  Is there nothing they could do to speed that first 90 minutes up?,1367712000,,118,4.363636363636363
4945148,5,B0063FQREO,We enjoyed this movie. There was action and a story behind it. Good all the way through. Glad we rented it!,1367712000,,107,4.142857142857143

A good young adult/ teen movie.

4945150,3,B0063FQREO,"but I didn't like the sets and costumes and the directing.  It was just ridiculous.  I like fantasy and sci-fi and mystery, so it's not that I have to have reality.  It wasn't for me.",1367712000,,183,4.171428571428572

4945155,5,B0063FQREO,"Good movie, well developed plot, fast paced. Main characters are mostly fleshed out, but several are left to the imagination. Overall, I liked the movie.",1367625600,,153,5.16
4945156,3,B0063FQREO,"Don't get me wrong; the movie was entertaining enough. From the hype of it all, I guess I might've expected a bit more of... something. The characters were developed fairly well and the imagery was great... but the predictability factor was a bit too high throughout.",1367625600,,267,4.826086956521739
4945157,5,B0063FQREO,Love movies with a strong fearless female lead.  The cinematography was awesome. The storyline was easy to follow and the characters had depth.,1367625600,,143,5.217391304347826
4945158,4,B0063FQREO,"Not as good as the book, but a worthy effort. Casting was as close to perfection for nearly everyone, I thought, especially Lawrence. Harrelson was a surprise as Hamish, but a great surprise- he really did the role justice. However, I felt the two main boys were less than stellar, and that they overplayed the whole wounded puppy dog thing for Peeta. Gale was just so-so, but his role was not as prominent in the movie as in the book. Despite other inconsistencies with the original story that I am sure they had to do for brevity's sake, they got the main ideas of the book across well, and the action was exciting. Overall, very entertaining.",1367625600,,645,4.568965517241379
4945159,5,B0063FQREO,Good variety of characters and I liked the fact that the older actors didn't steel the scenes. The ending leaves you hanging and hoping for a sequel.,1367625600,,149,4.555555555555555

4945164,5,B0063FQREO,Loved this movie so much I had to watch it again.  Non stop action.  A little violent for kids under 14 but I loved it.,1367625600,,119,3.72
4945165,4,B0063FQREO,I always like the book better.  The casting was spot on.  Jennifer Lawrence is just awesome as Katniss.  Kudos to her.,1367625600,,118,4.523809523809524
4945166,5,B0063FQREO,I was very impressed by the easy access through the wii. The quality was great and the selection is very nice! Plus it was free since I've got prime!,1367625600,,149,4.172413793103448
4945167,3,B0063FQREO,The actors were good at their roles but the premise of children killing children so their districts could win just didn't sit well with us,1367625600,,138,4.56
4945168,3,B0063FQREO,I am actually looking forward to next installment of this saga...I still can't get myself to read these tween books..,1367625600,,117,4.9

This movie is a great eye opener as to how our lives could actually turn out [in the future] but this is just one person's idea.  This is a great movie, great actors, great ideas for survival, how the other half lives, how to behave, friendships, and strength.... Recommend this movie ""Yes"" and cannot wait for the next movie.

4945172,5,B0063FQREO,Loved it.  Have read the book a few times and love the series.  This movie was as good as it gets when translating from prose to film.,1367625600,,134,3.925925925925926

4945175,4,B0063FQREO,It was better then I expected.  Very entertaining.  I would watch it over and over cause you might miss a few important things.,1367539200,,127,4.478260869565218
4945176,3,B0063FQREO,"I returned the movie purchased for my Granddaughter since she had already opened another one of the same she also received as a gift.  I had rented it, found it okay, but did not want to keep it for myself.",1367539200,,206,4.15
4945177,4,B0063FQREO,"hunger games began slow and wierd like science fiction, but soon the main characters developed to the point of caring about them somewhat.  seemed an allegory of recent wars, begun by old rich guys, but fought by young people in search of false heroism.  saddest part was the vicarious voyeristic involvement by the audience through media exploitation.",1367539200,,352,5.157894736842105
4945178,5,B0063FQREO,Great adaptation but it doesn't follow the book 100%. Characters are well written and acted and the effects only enhance the story.,1367539200,,131,5.0

4945180,5,B0063FQREO,i got to watch this for no charge with my prime account and loved it.  I can not wait for the sequel.  My prime account has payed for itself many times over with all the unlimited streaming and 2 day shipping.,1367539200,,209,4.073170731707317

4945183,4,B0063FQREO,"Movies are never as good as the books, so I wasn't too disappointed, but I do wish the movie people had stayed closer to the written story.  Katniss's relationship with Gale isn't really explored enough to explain it to someone who hasn't read the book and Peta comes across as rather wimpy and boring.  The Capital people weren't ""fleshed out"" enough and you didn't really get how controlling the Capital is.  It was still ok to watch.",1367539200,,436,4.636363636363637
4945184,5,B0063FQREO,Awesome plot and a lot of action!  Interesting how the writers could incorporate a love story in such an environment.,1367539200,,117,4.85

4945187,5,B0063FQREO,riveting story and very interesting.  I find that books are way better than watching the movie....more details of thoughts and feelings,1367539200,,135,5.428571428571429
4945188,4,B0063FQREO,"It was just ok. A lot was left out, things I felt would easily put in a movie and some events were changed which I didn't like. But still an ok movie.",1367539200,,150,3.71875
4945189,3,B0063FQREO,I probably should have passed this one by; I usually like adventure movies but not ones where children kill children... My fault should have known better...,1367539200,,156,5.038461538461538
4945190,5,B0063FQREO,We watched this movie in the theatre and again watching in the tv was great. The clarity of the movie was very great. I would recommend everyone to watch this movie.,1367539200,,165,4.354838709677419

4945192,3,B0063FQREO,"well at least I wasn,t with watching this dvd,a bit slow and took a bit to get into the story. Quite a reasonable dvd to watch with family,but personally I didn,t think it stood up to the hype that I had heard about it...",1367539200,,221,4.045454545454546

4945195,5,B0063FQREO,I wonder if they are making the sequel as we speak?  Hope so!!  Can't wait to see the next book!,1367452800,,96,3.75
4945196,5,B0063FQREO,A story line that holds your interest from beginning to end. Characters that draw you in and leave you wanting more.,1367452800,,116,4.571428571428571
4945197,4,B0063FQREO,So I didn't read the books (yet) but watched the movie when I was sick in bed. I guess having not read the books I really had a hard time getting over the whole concepts of the kids killing kids as part of the game. I think recent news worthy events have created that mentality that is still so fresh in our minds. I will see the next movie in the series (and hope to finally read the books). I do love Jennifer Lawrence....she really is a class act and so true to herself.,1367452800,,473,4.042553191489362
4945198,2,B0063FQREO,I have to admit that I'm not a fan of sci-fi.  I found this movie overlong and predictable and cannot understand why it won any awards.,1367452800,,135,4.1923076923076925
4945199,4,B0063FQREO,"I choose a 4 because it was a good movie, especially one coming from a book, but it wasn't the best. I give the actors really good credit for their work and to the people behind the stage.",1367452800,,188,3.973684210526316
4945200,4,B0063FQREO,"I didn't expect to like it. i had picked-up the book my daughter had sitting around from a college course, and didn't get very far. it was too dry and depressing.  I really liked the movie though and I think I attribute this to jenifer lawrene's performance.  she was just very compelling to watch. i'm glad i decided to watch it and not just skip-it based on my experience with the book.",1367452800,,388,4.375
4945201,2,B0063FQREO,"If the film of this story is anything like the book, I'm glad that I have never bothered. The wimpy/emo romance between Peeta and Katniss is revolting, and I am so thankful that I watched this for free on Amazon Prime. If I had paid a cent to see this movie, I would have given it a 1-star review; it was 2 hours poorly spent.",1367452800,,326,4.030769230769231
4945202,4,B0063FQREO,"I kept seeing young adults reading the book so I was curious to find out what was so riveting.  The movie is about the misuses of power and the courage and intelligence required to empower yourself in impossible situations.  It is about accepting and receiving help from unlikely places, friendship, love and loyalty.  Good life lessons for people of all ages. Oscar winner Jennifer Lawrence is magnificent and Woody Harrelson shines.",1367452800,,434,5.084507042253521
4945203,3,B0063FQREO,"watchable, but i don't get all the hoopla. too long and no big payoff in the end. just kinda mediocre",1367452800,,101,4.1
4945204,5,B0063FQREO,"They did a great job with this movie. Usually when you watch a movie after reading the book, there is some disappointment in the depiction of characters or even change in the plot. This was spot on and I can't wait to see Catching Fire!",1367452800,,236,4.266666666666667
4945205,3,B0063FQREO,I guess it would have been too difficult to make the movie really follow the story as it was written...,1367452800,,103,4.2
4945206,5,B0063FQREO,"I admittedly did not read the books that these movies are based from. But I can say that the movie was great. A surreal take, and refreshing spin. There are many political undertones, I couldn't help but think of the French Revolution when I watched this. The similarities within this trilogy are there. Looking forward to seeing Catching Fire this fall.",1367452800,,354,4.819672131147541

4945210,3,B0063FQREO,The books were well written and certainly will capture your attention.  I read  all three but constantly in the back of my mind had concern with the concept of kids killing each other.  The brutally bothered me.  I did not and would not see the movie.,1367452800,,251,4.391304347826087
4945211,5,B0063FQREO,"Good, great, horrifying.  Jennifer Lawrence did an amazing job portraying Katniss.  Everyone's character was credible, the emotions flowing from them was perfect.  It doesn't make you tear up but it does keep you at the edge of your seat.  I was amused for the duration of the entire movie.  I loved the slow brewing romance between Katniss and Peeta.  I look forward to sequel.",1367452800,,378,4.828125

4945213,4,B0063FQREO,I watched this movie because of all the hype it received and it lived up to it. Worth the 2.5 hours.,1367452800,,100,3.8095238095238093

4945215,4,B0063FQREO,"Enough of everything to keep me interested, action, pathos, unrequited love and bad guys. It's a little long but once your into to the plot you can forgive that. Otherwise an enjoyable movie through and through, recommended.",1367452800,,224,5.081081081081081
4945216,3,B0063FQREO,Maybe a younger group would like this better. I didn't dislike the movie just not my type. Not sure I would watch another sequel.,1367452800,,129,4.416666666666667
4945217,1,B0063FQREO,Extremely boring couldn't make it past the first 20 minutes. Even used fastforward about 20 minutes and it felt like the same scene.,1367452800,,132,4.782608695652174
4945218,5,B0063FQREO,Super excited and entertainment. Great cast and very well put together. Can't wait for the next one to come out.,1367452800,,112,4.65

I had never seen this movie but heard so much about it for a couple years, so I was curious. really glad I watched it, it was really good. I was a little disappointed in the end, I was expecting a little different emotion... it left me guessing and I hate that. I like to know ""WHAT HAPPENED""....",1367452800,,348,4.057971014492754

4945226,5,B0063FQREO,"We don't generally like sci fi/futuristic movies, but this one was just a really good story, and well acted.  We recommend giving it a try even if, like us, you don't usually like off beat, fantastical stories.",1367366400,,210,4.675675675675675

4945229,3,B0063FQREO,It didn't live up to expectations.  It wasn't very creative but a retake of an old story.  Hunger Games would make a decent TVseries but it wasn't up to movie standards.,1367366400,,169,4.419354838709677

When the first book, Hunger Games, was released in 2008, ever searching for good secondary, pre-adult literature, we found in it a strong, believable young woman to whom our daughters, which at the time were 12 and 15, could relate. The movie has it's weak points, diverges from the story line at times, some of the characters in the movie do not match the book characters, esp. Haymitch - played by Harrelson? just bad!, while Jennifer Lawrence was spot on for the title roll of Katniss Everdeen, but overall keeps the main theme intact. Men and women of all ages will be entertained and find the story engaging.",1367366400,,691,4.626016260162602

4945236,5,B0063FQREO,A cross between the Truman Show and Running Man with 200% more action and emotional pull-ins. Wonderful young actors. I'll be watching for them in other things.,1367366400,,160,4.962962962962963

4945238,5,B0063FQREO,"The first time I saw this movie (when it was released) I was really focused on the book and what was NOT in it.  This time, with a bit of perspective, I watched it more as a standalone movie.  Jennifer Lawrence really does an excellent job of being a terrified teenage girl.  I really enjoyed watching it again and recommend it even for those who have not read the books.",1367366400,,371,4.271428571428571

4945244,3,B0063FQREO,"The movie poorly explained things or didn't explain what they were at all. Granted, it was good entertainment, but kids killing each other removes an aspect of whatever humanity they had at the very start.",1367366400,,205,4.885714285714286

4945246,3,B0063FQREO,"The movie was good. It was fascinating to see how close my imagination when reading the book coincided with the director's imaginings! The movie however does not reflect the internal struggle and conflict that Catniss felt about the games, and the two men in her life which was a significant part of the book.",1367366400,,309,4.7407407407407405
4945247,3,B0063FQREO,Basically a poor-written soap opera set in a post-apocalyptic era where children killing children is good sport. I am always puzzled why future humankind is presented by Hollywood as nothing but barbarians with mag-lift trains and flying cars.,1367366400,,243,5.421052631578948

4945249,4,B0063FQREO,"I enjoyed this movie but thought that a lot was left up to the viewer to fill in from reading the book. Scene transitions were a little rough. Otherwise, a pretty entertaining and thought provoking show.",1367366400,,203,4.666666666666667
4945250,5,B0063FQREO,"This is a wonderfully photographed film with a compelling story and compelling characters in extraordinary circumstances.
Satisfying both science fiction and fantasy genres, The Hunger Games offers much more than entertainment for parents and those eager to see films with real meaning that demonstrate the consequences of action, The Hunger games poses tough questions while presenting difficult moral dilemmas sure to spark family conversation. This one is going into my DVD collection. Be advised that while not truly gory, this film suggests murderous violence (powerful because it is more suggested than shown), and contains some pretty sad moments, albeit offset by triumph. Be brave, there's nothing going on here worse than the content of a Grimm's Fairy Tale, but hold on to those between the ages of eight and eleven, and the generally tender-hearted. A must see, beautifully acted, inventive, and fascinating to watch.",1367366400,,929,5.458333333333333

4945252,4,B0063FQREO,Of course this has been out forever and my husband and I are both in our 50's so we didn't see the need in battling crowds and young ones to see these movies.  We did like this movie.  There was great action!  Held us all the way!,1367366400,,230,3.851063829787234
4945253,3,B0063FQREO,"I'm sure many people who have read the book agree it was so much better than the movie. The movie itself was not suspenseful, didn't really keep me that captivated, & actually felt awkward to watch... However, it did a ""good enough"" job, I suppose, for 3 stars. It wasn't awful, but I'm definitely glad I didn't pay to watch it in theaters!",1367366400,,340,4.412698412698413

Can't wait for Catching Fire!!",1367366400,,317,4.3

I was pleasantly surprised!  The move was pretty good and the actors portrayed their characters perfectly.  The movie was made even better by viewing from Amazon on my iPad as the streaming was flawless and uninterrupted, unlike some other streaming services that I've used.",1367366400,,436,4.931506849315069
4945263,4,B0063FQREO,"I really liked this movie until the last. Twenty seconds. I hated the ending. I understand why there are so many loose ends due to the sequels that follow, but I think it could have been tied up a little better. I just started reading the book last night to see if the book leaves you hanging as well. I would recommend this movie.",1367366400,,331,4.1875
4945264,2,B0063FQREO,"if you've read the book, prepare to be disappointed with the film.  Depth of relationships between characters and their world is hardly explored in favor of almost exclusively focusing on the action.",1367366400,,199,5.21875

4945267,3,B0063FQREO,"Trilogies rarely deliver more answers than questions in an episode. The formula is set: first episode sets up the characters and conflict, part two develops character interactions and ends when conflict climaxes, finally, the third brings the end of the climax/conflict and resolves the series. Entertaining? Yes. Groundbreaking? Well, it depends who you ask. There are similarities to films such as The Running Man (1987), Battle Royale (2000), to name a few, and it revamps cliche roles one such is of black actors as saccharin mystics a la [""The Legend of] Bagger Vance.""",1367280000,,574,5.182795698924731

That way one isn't always finding what is not congruent with the book. The Hunger Games movie was good. Maybe I am just too logical about things. Maybe I just like more detailed explanations of a background. Okay so everyone revolted against ""The Capital"". Then they were all punished by participating in ""The Hunger Games"". How does the rest of the world fit in this? How can the elite and sophisticated just sit back on their technology and despotism and not only allow such barbarism to happen but glorify it. I can see the author's point she is trying to get across. In the United States, we do live in a very top-down society in which ""The Capital"" or the top 1% has most of the wealth and power. Maybe ""The Capital"" is supposed to be capitalism. If one can look past a lack of historical background and the exaggeration of modern society, it is a good movie. I agree with the message. I don't understand why 1% must keep it all to themselves while there are children starving on the streets.",1367280000,,1109,4.4411764705882355

4945279,2,B0063FQREO,Idea of fighting to the death for an unrealistic motive for games did not appeal to me. It turned the idea of a 'game' into an antiquated morality similar to gladiators in the lion's den arena during Roman times.,1367193600,,212,4.461538461538462

The characters are appealling and the plot compelling enough that the movie builds an empathetic relationship between you and the main characters.  Even if you're not a big fan of this genre, give it a try some day when you have nothing else to watch.  I don't think you'll be disappointed.

Oh yes.  There is graphic violence but the director mercifully doesn't dwell on it or overdo the gore.",1367107200,,513,4.719101123595506

4945304,4,B0063FQREO,"While I enjoyed it more than the book it is still a fairly gruesome tale.  Children on Children violence is certainly a horrible thing (obviously the point of the book/movie).  It is a good tale of perververence and compassion.  They did actually tone it down from the book and added a few things that the book only alludes to.  For example, the riot in district 11 and the unfortunate end of the gamekeeper.  They also did not try and give the monster dogs the eyes of the fallen contestants (something I was grateful for).

4945324,5,B0063FQREO,"I enjoyed the movie so much I have now read all the books and am looking forward to the future installments of the movie.  In the first one they have probably stayed about as faithful to the book as  is possible, not exact but fairly close.",1367107200,,240,4.195652173913044

4945326,1,B0063FQREO,I would not recommend this book especially to young adult readers. Hunger is a world crisis and it is not topic that should be not viewed as a form of entertainment. The world is so desensitized fiction is no longer fiction the lines are muted and blared So in parts of our world community Hunger is a constant daily struggle even in our own USA i am not talking about some impoverished country in a foreign place your neighbor may be Hungry and you don't know and if you did would you care? Or think its just a game they are playing,1367107200,,533,4.235294117647059

4945329,3,B0063FQREO,"Even though the ""Hunger game"" book series was written for teens
at least the first book was outstanding.  The movie took the heart
out of the book and gave us another shallow action adventure.
In defense of the movie makers it would have been very difficult to
make a movie that kept the heart of the book.",1367107200,,306,4.368421052631579
4945330,5,B0063FQREO,This movie pulled me in from the beginning. I watched it because my Grandaughter said I should. I thought this would be just some movie for kids and teenagers. I was so wrong. This is a great and fun watch for all ages.,1367107200,,219,4.116279069767442

4945333,2,B0063FQREO,With the special effects and great acting this movie was still a let down.  Unless you read the 3 books (which I didn't but my children did) you wonder why the story goes the way it does.  It gets a little ho-hum at times and looks like they had to fill in sections with parade-ish things but I wished I hadn't wasted time on this one. The ending...borrrrrr...ing.,1367107200,,364,4.338235294117647
4945334,4,B0063FQREO,"I really enjoyed the film, although there were parts cut out of the book that were pretty necessary to the plot. Nonetheless, Jennifer Lawrence was amazing as was the scene stealing actress who portrayed Rue. Definitely worth your time to watch.",1367020800,,245,5.0
4945335,4,B0063FQREO,"I haven't read the book, but the movie was well worth the 2:15 length.  I'm sure the book was better, as usual, but all-in-all a well produced movie.  Highly recommend for Ages 13+.",1367020800,,181,4.454545454545454

(""In Time"",  ""Equilibium"", ""The Island"") that all deal with a similar subject - the dehumanizing of mankind - or more appropriately the attempted dehumanizing of humans really as an ""under the carpet"" way of supposedly solving the limited resource issue our planet is facing and will be even more so in the not too distant future. Only, as these films portray, limited resources is not at the heart of the problem but greed, coveteousness and lack of care for our fellow mankind...because ""there is more than enough to go around"" and ""no one should have to die for anyone to be immortal"". I suppose we still haven't learned from past history that this is always how man solves their problems - subjugate and then eradicate what encroaches upon you.",1367020800,,867,4.818791946308725

Thanks for making it available ...",1367020800,,241,4.5
4945341,4,B0063FQREO,"THE HUNGER GAMES is one of those films that can interpreted a million different ways. . . or can just be just watched for pure entertainment. Excellent cinematography, costume design, and soundtrack along with a very unique storyline help to create a really memorable screen experience. The acting-in-general is contrived and overly perfecto, and there are definitely a few holes and cop-outs in the plot. Yet, THE HUNGER GAMES is so one-of-a-kind that its flaws, some of which might be ruinous in a lesser film, are quite forgiveable.

All the same, there are ways that THE HUNGER GAMES might have been better; e.g., it would have been nice to see more virtually created creature phenomena such as  the were-pitbulls (or whatever they are)toward the end. Another thing: Considering the brutality of the premise, what actually happens during the ""game"" is fairly tame. Having said that, I'm not sure how it would have worked better--It certainly would NOT have been enhanced by creating a horrific ""It's either me or you"" gore-fest. It often descends into sentimental, politically correct, teeny-bopperish romance, but just when things start to get too maudlin, new things come up.

I am sure that this film does not do complete justice to the book trilogy, which I have not read but am now very eager to read. The mere fact that the movie made me (and I'm sure many others) want to read the books speaks for itself.",1367020800,,1416,4.891666666666667
4945342,3,B0063FQREO,"I never read the book, so I'm unbiased in that aspect.  Now I watch a lot of films and I have a wide range of genres in which I appreciate, and in this fantasy, sci-fi, adventure, drama many things are lacking to making this a good flick.  It's been over a week now, between watching the movie and me writing this ""review,"" so I may have forgotten some things.

The Hunger Games does a poor job at setup.  I'll assume the book does better to explain just what the heck is going on.  Sure the film doesn't leave you completely in the dark, but it lacks any detail required leave you feeling unquestioning about this unfamiliar primitive yet futuristic world.  It seems as though the world has reverted back, in the way of human compassion and idealism, to ancient Rome.  Fast forward to the games.  Again, maybe the book does a better job, or maybe not, but there isn't really much setup and connecting to the non main characters who take part in the games to allow the viewer to connect with them.  When one of these folks dies, you're left uncaring.  There is really only one true villain in the games whom the audience can hope for his demise, despite the fact that 17 other people are trying to kill our heroine.  What's with the government?  What's with the super smart, super fast, and super silent girl who kills no one, is so smart yet gets poisoned by eating berries that even Katniss knew to be poisonous.  We know all players were being tracked by the government, so why didn't they mess with this stealthy girl who wasn't killing anyone but could follow the other players, silently stalking them without being detected?  Why was Katniss the only one receiving help in the way of mystery pods which seemingly came out of nowhere?  Why does this government use kids to play these games instead of adults?  How have the people not revolted against the government taking their children to fit to the death?  There are just too many questions left unanswered.

To sum it up, This film lacks connection with characters and many explanations to many different subjects.  However this wouldn't stop me from watching the sequel, but I'm not going to be standing in line to watch it in theaters either. I can easily wait for it to come out on home video.  This also doesn't mean I regret watching this film, but it is simply average.",1367020800,,2334,4.538277511961723

The movie is set in a futuristic era where young contestants are selected from each district to fight to the death until there is a single survivor.  Or is there another way?  Katniss is a strong female role model for young ladies coming into their own. I highly recommend this movie for the teenage crowd and above despite the graphic violence.

4945356,1,B0063FQREO,I don't get this movie at all. It sucks on every level. Bad camera work doesn't make a good movie.,1366934400,,98,3.95
4945357,4,B0063FQREO,"I watched the movie before reading the book. I understand how the script for the movie had to be revised, and it wasn't bad at all. Despite narrating differences, I think the movie conveyed the ""main"" story well---cruel dictatorship in Panem and oppression in 12 districts. Violence during the Game was soften too, considering how it happened in the book.

However, the movie left out a lot of backgrounds and relationships. I started the book because there were things in the movie that I needed to fill the blank. For example, Katniss' father wasn't mentioned earlier in the movie; he just popped up when Katniss recalled his death. I found out from the book that he gave her skills to survive---hunting, trading, finding edible plants, etc. Moreover, her relationship with her father and his death shaped Katniss characteristics.

To me, this story (and the whole series)is a complete version of Battle Royale. If you could see the point of the story, I think it's a good movie to watch. If you think it's purely violent, steer clear from it. Either way, I won't let young kids watch this movie.",1366934400,,1098,4.804232804232805

It is a very interesting perspective of what a world could be like, or is the author comparing it to something that already exists in our worlds we just don't want to see it.  It would make a great discussion series.  As always the movie misses even though the movie was very good.  I am reading the second book and I can't wait to read it daily, it has really captured my attention.

In true 1984 fashion the elite have their way most of the time and even when they don't the starving peasants have no chance of changing a world that uses them as slaves for the elite. No happy endings either.,1366761600,,383,4.647058823529412

4945409,3,B0063FQREO,"I understand the director wanted to make the city feel like another world, but the costumes and decor of everything seemed cheesy.

4945416,3,B0063FQREO,I guess if you are a young adult that was into these books this is the movie for you.  I knew the premise but I have to admit it's depressing to watch these kids killing each other off.  Not for me. The performances were fine though.,1366761600,,233,4.043478260869565

4945418,1,B0063FQREO,Absolute crap in downloading on TV. The system used by Amazon for streaming is as much fun watching as watching grass grow. Better work on your streaming Amazon.,1366761600,,161,4.785714285714286
4945419,2,B0063FQREO,This movie has the heart and soul of the Tin Man. It is all action and no character development. It is all sexiness and no passion. It is just bad. Even the action scenes aren't that exciting. It can only get better with the second movie... I hope.,1366761600,2,248,4.1875

4945424,4,B0063FQREO,"I recently just breezed through the Hunger Games book.  It hooks you in and keeps you reading until the end.  After reading the book I of course wanted to watch the movie to compare it to the book.  While I wasn't disappointed, there is only so much you can include in a movie.  A lot of details were left out and still other minor things were changed to be more suitable for the movie...which is okay.  That being said it was still a well directed and filmed movie.  My recommendation would be to absolutely read the book though.",1366761600,,530,4.357142857142857

4945437,4,B0063FQREO,"While I didn't think this one ranked up with the Avatars of the world, it was a very well made, enjoyable movie.  Jennifer Lawrence was very believable in this role, and while the premise is a bit far fetched (sending 12 year old children to their death for entertainment), if you can look past this, the movie was overall a solid one all around.  I don't want to give anything away so I won't go into any more detail, but I am looking forward to the next one in the series.",1366761600,,474,4.197802197802198

The premisses are laughable, and why oh why don't they restrict the ages of the contestants - throwing 12 year old's together into a fight to the death with 18 year old's is an astoundingly stupid proposition. Maybe the books explain this and the other ridiculous propositions about life in the future, but the movie falls well short.",1366761600,,501,4.704545454545454
4945445,5,B0063FQREO,"The Hunger Games movie is based on the novel of the same title by Suzanne Collins. The screenplay follows the book quite faithfully for the most part. Jennifer Lawrence does a sterling job as Katniss Everdeen, Peeta Mellark is well portrayed by Josh Hutcherson and Aussie actor Liam Hemsworth does a great rendition of Gale Hawthorne. A few screen veterans add to the overall enjoyment: Donald Sutherland is very convincing as President Snow; Woody Harrelson plays an excellent Haymitch; Effie Trinket is superbly acted by Elizabeth Banks and a surprisingly good Lenny Kravitz plays Cinna. Even the minor characters are convincing. The sets, setting and location make for an outstanding screen experience and the wardrobe and make-up are a marvel, especially the citizens of the Capitol. Special effects and computer graphics make for a stunning result. Brilliant direction by Gary Ross: an excellent experience all round. The second disc in this DVD set has interviews with producers, director, cast & crew, as well as behind the scenes clips.",1366675200,,1044,5.220238095238095

4945448,2,B0063FQREO,"I should stay straight away that I have not read the book and I suspect that the film-makers have made the assumption that people who watch the movie will know the story. As a result the setting up of the Hunger Games is perfunctory, with no real justification for the annual sacrifice of 23 teenagers and no indication as to what is achieved, other than a TV show. The movie comes across as a combination of 'The Truman Show', with the Games taking place in an artificially controlled environment, and 'The Running Man', with people being killed for entertainment purposes.

Having failed to set up the movie, the problems are then compounded by making so many of the scenes longer and less productive than is necessary. Other reviews have suggested that the story is all about relationships, but the movie isn't. There's far too much emphasis on the features of the actors and not enough storytelling. Ms. Lawrence might look appealing, but that simply isn't enough to carry a movie. Since the film clocks in at almost 2 1/2 hours, far more should have happened than actually does.

I saw the movie on the big screen and again on DVD, where it was already among the bargain buys. I thought I might find more in it the second time, but if anything I found less. It's a slow, confusing and ultimately not very good movie.",1366675200,13,1321,4.617021276595745

4945452,4,B0063FQREO,"Jennifer Lawrence could read the phone book and I would be fascinated. However, the plot of the Hunger Games is rather weak. Predicting the future has always been a stumbling block for most science fiction writers. We've seen plenty of versions regarding how terrible the future will be... going all the way back to Huxley and Wells. This one divides the country (I presume it is America) into the very wealthy and the very poor, with one poor person given the chance to survive a publically broadcast games that pit children against one another until only one is left standing. This is about as likely as never happening. The premise is so weak as to make the rest of the movie a joke. Supporting performances are also weak. The film relies almost entirely on special effects and the performances of Lawrence and veteran Donald Sutherland. While I love science fiction, I found the end did not justify the means. The plot is weak throughout and solution is open ended, hence Hunger Games, two - will Jennifer end up with her true boyfriend; will she have to volunteer for the games again (she'd have to survive because I believe there is a book three!!!!). Unfortunately, it did well at the box office and Hollywood loves a winner so there will be more coming... but I will not be watching.",1366675200,,1291,4.666666666666667

Sure! lets put some lamo bland abercrombie actors along with some overused hollywood mainstays who could say their lines well enough but evoked every other stupid movie they've been in -heck! might as well have had John Goodman in there. Come to think of it, he might have been a small improvement to Woody Harrelson?? This movie could've been epic -I mean, we're talking about a deathmatch amongst kids! But this was more Glee than Gladiator. The production and the acting was on the level of a bad two-part mini series on network TV. And there's little evidence from watching this completely dry, stilted, and shallow interpretation that anyone with a major hand in creating this film was actually moved by the story.. Of course, the sequels will continue to pad plenty of pockets given the low standards of most movie-goers who have lauded this shallow project.

4945496,4,B0063FQREO,"I read all the books and have been looking forward to seeing this first movie. It couldn't possibly have everything in it from the books but it did lack a back story line. I felt there were two levels to this movie. The what we saw level (the movie itself) was more or less all the highlights of the book and the what we didn't see level (everything left out of the movie) was all the story line. I never thought Katniss was a likable character, she wasn't very nice and was pretty bit*&^y in all the books. The movie didn't portray that at all. I wasn't sure who all the characters were from District 1, guess the director didn't think it necessary to give them names. And Haymitch - in the first book he is a self-absorbed alcoholic with no time for anyone but himself.  In the movie he's not that at all, he's nicer, very helpful and a good guy. I liked the self-absorbed drunk much better.

I am in hopes that the second movie will be more like the book. Now having said that, if you haven't read the books then you'll enjoy the movie for what it is.

I though this was going to be about this girls abilities to survive on what she had learned on her survival skills but it showed very little of that.  It mostly showed what they would get and dressing them up and getting them ready for the hunger games.  I guess I am not into seeing children kill children.  This just isn't my thing especially since there is too much of it going on in the world in reality today.  If they have a sequel, I doubt I will watch it.

I don't see the big hoopla, though.

I was raised on ""The Most Dangerous Game"" and also have seen this theme over and over.  It's pretty much just a teen love story wrapped up in a sci-fi thriller.

Were we supposed to think of The Wizard of Oz with the costumes?  I thought more of A Clockwork Orange.

I know this sounds like a bad review, but I'm only pointing out the parts I was not impressed with.

The reason I give it three stars is Jennifer Lawrence.  The kid has made her debut in this film and she's going places.

If you really want to see her in her glory, watch Silver Lining Playbook.

4945572,2,B0063FQREO,"Don't get me wrong on the rating for the movie, because i loved the book. But this isn't a rating on the book, its a rating on the crappy film that features crappy fire, over exaggerated hairdos, cute little doggies that try to eat the main characters, low adrenalin rush, a creepy fat dude who hates underdogs, a creepy skinny dude with a shave that makes his face look like a freaking race car, a hardly malnourished girl who lives among an extremely starving population of untouchables, and a hardly malnourished boy who's secretly in love with the hardly malnourished girl.

It may sound like it, but I'm not attacking the actors. The acting was actually good, the fault lays with the movie producers, the director, the stylists, and the artists. They are the ones who failed. I thought that the setting year was like 3000 or something, after WW3, not 1985. I understand that funding for movies are limited and that added to that the economy is weak, but this movie sucks even given those boundaries and limits. When Katniss is swirling around in her dress you expect a burst of epic forest fire to engulf her as described in the book, instead you get a pitiful flame that would have a hard time even browning the plastic dress. Common, would it have been that hard to pay an extra what? five bucks to make that particular flame a little better so that Katniss can actually qualify as ""the girl on fire"" throught the rest of the story? Not to mention, Peeta and Katniss are like the only healthy people who live in District 12. Everybody else looked like they came straight out of central Africa (save for their pale skin)which is what they should look like. It would have made sense to fatten them up later in the movie after they've been living the good life for a while, but not at the beginning of the film. I think that in the whole movie my favorite character was Katiss' mother because she was the only one who seemed to be well adapted from the book.

I know that the next Hunger Games film is coming out soon.... and they better do the second book justice. But in a retro-like story universe like that I highly doubt it.",1366243200,2,2133,4.480719794344473

4945575,1,B0063FQREO,"Somehow a teen fiction tale about the loss of humanity via a brutal, pointless media experience manages to miss its own message and become a trilogy franchise opportunity. To be fair, the premise has great potential but the writing and direction was lousy.

Over long by a good hours, and if it was a Star Wars movie it was more episode 1 than episode 4.  For comparison I then watched The Langoliers, based on a Stephen King story, and even with the dodgy computer graphics at the end it managed more pace, excitement, and tighter writing.

I will admit that I have not read the book(s), but I fail to see how watching young people hunting down and killing each other gets such high marks. The whole thing is just sick to me. With all of the real-life violence going on today, including school shootings, etc., I fail to see how this kind of thing is entertaining in the least.

With a continual stream of blood-soaked movies and TV programs produced today, it little wonder that I watch very little TV, and find few movies that are worth my time, with the exception of films such as Lincoln, The King's Speech, etc. As far as I am concerned, The Hunger Games was a waste of my time and money. And now I see that a sequel is coming out.

But perhaps it carries on the legacy, seemingly for each generation, of that eye-opening topical movie that manages to get watched AND get a message across:  from 'Soylent Green' thru 'Logan's Run' and 'Rollerball', to 'Blade Runner'  and 'I, Robot', sometimes the messenger is less what matters than the fact that the message itself is, at least, getting out there.
  Action, death, archery, teen-age romance?  All checked off on the Hollywood list.  Truth to the book?  Can't say, didn't read, but I have heard that the Dream Factory treatment is in evidence here as well.

Read all three books, as did my husband, in an effort to facilitate conversations with an adolescent. Great effort to recreate the story when transferred to film media. It was by far her favorite Christmas present and she has watched in in both formats to the point of ""wearing it out.""  She can watch it using the blu ray player, and when on her own, she uses her computer and the digital copy - great idea!!!!!  Though she (like most young people) can see it many times over, the rest of us don't need to, so the digital copy spares us the ""multi-view"" nightmare.  Would not purchase blu ray items if it was not a special film as they are expensive, but to please a young person to such a great degree, made it worth every penny.",1366156800,,823,4.324675324675325

4945645,3,B0063FQREO,"The leading actors performaces were tolerable, at best.  Supportive casting was nearly painful in it's excessive sentimentality crammed into mini-blurbs of screen time.
I am not a fan of novel-to-movie adaptations in general and The Hunger Games is no exception.  If you need background noise on while working a project or other entertainment, this film is adequate for that 'filler' in the room.
The story or attempted plot is very weak - to presume, 70+ years after a rebellion by the 'disctricts' and the resulting aftermath or working peace (aka ""The Hunger Games""), that only ~10% of the districts required participants actually train for the 'games' is a huge black hole in the story and completely unrealistic.  If such a culture ever existed, no self respecting community or family/parents would allow their child(ren) to live such complacent lives and go into such a 'lottery' unprepared.  The premise of the story is based on 'eligable participants' who are between the age of 12 and 18 and are pitted against each other to the death in what is viewed as a game show by those living in the Capitol.
Stupid, unintelligent and debasing fluff.",1366156800,,1150,4.973958333333333

PG-13 was the first indicator that this was going to be a lame movie. The training session was way too long and dragged out. Jen Lawrence can't act worth a s***. The writing was aweful and the so called special f/x looked to be done by the same group that worked on Twig light. Just a horrendous complilation of over hyped s***. The demon creatures at the end were stolen from the movie, The Gate. They just made them bigger, added more frightening teeth and got them to bark like dogs. The Tracker Jacks scene was also retarded. It was truly remarkable how they all disappeared once Jenny fell from the tree. Then there was the end battle between blonde and blonder...really, Gary Ross thoght that was a sufficient ending to the movie? Well, he was correct. Movie sucked, so why shouldn't the ending? 2 hours and 23 minutes of laughable garbage. Wish I could give it zero stars.

If you have read the book you may find much of the character development and parts of the story missing.  It is nice to see a movie shown in one part (The Hobbit in three parts would be better without having to wait two more years for the end), but this movie would have done more justice to the story if it was longer or shown in two parts.

Definitely worth a watch if you are alright with a story based on games involving death of teenagers as part of governmental control.

4945670,4,B0063FQREO,"It took me long enough, but I finally caved and saw `The Hunger Games'.  I'd read the book late last year and have since then intended on seeing the film but had just never gotten around to it.  I'll say pretty much what I had said in my review of the book; if you have a problem with the nature of the material then don't watch the film.  I mean, it's not like the themes here or the general plot itself isn't wholly explained on the outset.  You aren't going to be surprised by the violence since it is widely known and publicly criticized.  If you watch the movie or read the book then you have no grounds to complain about the violence.

You've been warned.

That said, I totally get the criticisms or the media and our society in actually targeting our youth with this `entertainment'.  Kids killing kids isn't something I think children should be entertaining themselves with.

I watched it though, so I can't say much.

For me, the film doesn't quite hold up against the book, which delves deeper into the political aspects of the films themes.  It actually speaks to a more socially conscious narrative than one would assume.  Sadly, the film attempts to condense and provide the audience with a more streamlined `action film' and because of this it changes up key segments and creates a less arresting experience.  The technical aspects of the film are also a letdown since they distract from the action.  The fire in particular is embarrassingly bad.  Still, Lawrence is exceptionally good here.  She cycles Katniss's emotional range with expertise.  The cheeky gaudiness of it all is engaging, but some of the rougher edges of the film really distract.  The jeering of the kids is so fake feeling, and the underdeveloped plotting of the `villains' is just too much of a head-sore.  The book was much better than I imagined and the film was more underwhelming than I imagined.

It's good, but that's about where it lies.",1365984000,,1930,4.653846153846154

4945674,4,B0063FQREO,its entertaining enough.  i enjoyed jennifer lawrence.  the male lead role seems miscasted.  i would picked a different actor for the male lead.  he seemed less believeable.  i felt little affection for his character -perhaps intended by writer.  nonetheless an entertaining movie worth watching.  probably won't unearth any deep philosophical or spiritual insights.  just relax and enjoy.,1365984000,,389,5.701754385964913

Yes, there is plenty of action in the books, but you don't know why in the movies why all of this is so important what the ties are between these people or what motivates them. Important events are left out, I just found this movie drab, the shaky cam filming at the beginning annoying and I just wanted it to be over. (I saw at the theater with my daughter, she didn't like the movie either)Sorry The Hunger Games fans, I didn't like it, that is not to insult you, because I thoroughly enjoyed the books.",1365984000,16,607,4.428571428571429

And for a lover of pictures like the Dirty Harry series and John Wayne war films that's saying a lot. The pace simply drug on and on. The only worse flick in this regard was Lord of The Rings Part 1. If you want to see a masterpiece go rent or buy Les Miserables. Hunger Games? No, absolutely not.",1365897600,,398,4.115384615384615

This one is very different, visually beautiful, interesting costumes and a very sad premise to the story of humankind, I wish I would have read the book first, but I think I will still do that anyway.  Unique and enjoyable.",1365897600,,284,4.66

4945689,4,B0063FQREO,"Although it would be quite unbelievable there was a good story line.  I felt a kinship with the actors characters.  The starlet was quite attractive in a realistic way.  I would recommend this to anyone who likes to watch science fiction.  It is a refreshing break from rocket ships, faster than light travel, and high powered death rays.  The scenery was well done and I felt like I was part of the scene.",1365897600,,406,4.506849315068493
4945690,5,B0063FQREO,"I felt this movie was well written and it makes me want to see what happens next. I enjoyed how the story flowed in and out of action and it wasn't all about the battle and the characters were developed well enough for me to care and want to see what is going to happen in the next movie.

Not knowing anything of the series I am excited to see what happens in the next one. I believe the next movie is Catching Fire, if it follows the books anyway ,and I can't wait.

 I had never read the books so I can not compare, but people I know who did said it was still enjoyable to see. I would recommend this movie for early to mid-teens and adults, not that it's overly gory or bad but the story I think is more geared toward that age. Not going to go into plot or anything I think it's worth seeing so I won't give any spoilers. I have yet to meet anyone who said they were disappointed in it or thought it was bad. I would pay to see it again which is rare I'm kinda cheap when it comes to movies and music. If you are on the fence and cheap like me, it's free on amazon prime instant now (Apr. 14,2013) so get the free trial and watch it. I hope this was helpful. I don't write reviews often but felt this movie was good enough that I would give it my endorsement for what it's worth. I know I would have not watched it if someone didn't recommend it to me.",1365897600,,1356,3.9416058394160585

4945692,5,B0063FQREO,This movie kept me at the edge of my seat the entire time.  It was filled with humor and tragedy.  I cannot wait for the 2nd book movie to come out.,1365897600,,148,3.7419354838709675
4945693,3,B0063FQREO,"First let me say that I'm going to be one of those guys that compares the book to the movie. I understand that you can't have every aspect of the book in a movie or you would end up with a series (Game of Thrones), instead of a movie. But there is just so much missing from this movie. Most importantly, the emotional ties between characters is sorely missing. The thing that makes this story so good is that you have this hardened hero forced into a situation where every move not only effects her, but the world in which she lives. This makes the thoughts and feelings of that character as much, if not more important than the actions she takes. Unfortunately, this is mostly missing in this adaptation.

PROS:
- A lead character that you want to root for. Jennifer Lawrence does a great job in this movie. She was a good pick for this role.
- Great visuals. Specifically in showing the differences between the Capital and the other districts. Although only District 12 is shown for longer period of time, you really see the contrast between the city and people of the Capital and the districts.

CONS:
- I know this somewhat unfair, but there is just too much of the story missing from this movie. I think they do a good job of getting most of the action in, but this story, as with most stories, is driven off who the characters are more than what they do. More importantly, since this is the start of a series of movies, the emotional ties between characters now is going to be very important later.",1365897600,,1504,4.406474820143885
4945694,4,B0063FQREO,"I had no intention to watch The Hunger Games, but when I saw it available on Amazon Prime, I decided to give it a try.  I was suprized that I actually enjoyed the movie.

4945695,4,B0063FQREO,I had not been interested in this for some time but I was bored so I figured why not. The movie was pretty good. The end not so much though. Seemed like they ran out of storyline and said boom you are all dead the end,1365897600,,217,3.739130434782609

4945697,3,B0063FQREO,Not much explication about how the dystopia came to be. It's more of a 'young woman becomes an unintentional princess.' Less of a 'superficial society breeds inequities that lead to revolution.' I guess I was expecting more depth to the story. Not much character development.,1365897600,,275,5.133333333333334
4945698,3,B0063FQREO,"It's better than twilight. Good for drinking games.  Just take a shot anytime someone says ""katness"".

4945699,4,B0063FQREO,"I enjoyed this movie and was surprised to find it on Amazon Prime for no cost.  Jennifer Lawrence is great and deserves all the accolades she has received. I was in suspense and enthralled until near the end when it got a little unreal when the overseers of the games introduced the computer generated dogs which somehow became real, and when the game participants started running in gangs.

The plot line itself is not new and has been a staple in scifi films, like Schwartzeneggers ""Running Man"", various Jean Claude VanDamme movies, and others.

4945702,4,B0063FQREO,There are some books where you enjoy the extended detail and the drawn-out pace. This was such a book for me and the movie was just too clean and tidy a version (out of necessity). A screenplay is a version of a book and in isolation it's a good movie but I hurt for the details I had enjoyed in the book while watching.

Trying to portray the desperation of the people and their circumstances in a number of flashbacks seems to me to only work if only you have read the book (mabe 90% of the viewers?) but would likely make the story hard to follow for those who haven't.

 The only part of this movie that seemed to bug me was the fact that the so called capital rich people ? would let the people in the 12 districts almost starve to death and live in 3rd world type conditions . So the folks living in the ' capital ' won the war , I would think they would want the people who lost to be more productive and better themselves so as to better the life of the people in the capital .

I was more than surprised finding myself swept up in the story and the cinematography.

4945756,3,B0063FQREO,"Another dystopia/sports film, teenage-style.  Similar to Rollerball and The Running Man, crossed with the Shirley Jackson story ""The Lottery,"" it offers nothing new.  It's full of images of the heroine's pure face nobly coping with an unfair world and ultimately prevailing over its dark and overwhelming forces.  More simply, teenager good, world bad--hardly anything new.  Woody Harrelson was the best thing in it.  Donald Sutherland is horrible as the overarching villain.  It was okay.  I watched it to the end, but it didn't inspire me to pick up the book.",1365811200,,561,5.166666666666667

4945759,3,B0063FQREO,"The Hunger Games is best understood as a metaphor for the problems of adolescence.  It certainly isn't meant to be taken literally, as very little of the plot or character's actions make sense, even in-universe.

The movie tries hard to have the styling of the Fifth Element meets the Running Man meets Truman show, but it takes itself too seriously and little original is added.  The actors do a good job, with the lead girl performing well in numerous scenes that have little dialogue for her to work with.

The movie is two disjoint halves shoved together.  The first half, creative in style but single-dimensional in character development and plot, covers the selection and training for the games.  Everyone shows up with expert ninja skills, without even a montage to make it believable that teenagers are deadly with a variety of weapons.  Important motivating factors like why the games are even held are glossed over or given poor explanation.  The games supposedly keep the districts in line as if the omnipresent white clad troops aren't enough.  Much of the detail here is irrelevant as the characters introduced in the first half spend most of the second gaping at TV screens.

The second half of the movie watches the ""tributes"" fighting in the woods of North Carolina (or a computer simulation, or a giant studio, or something where they can throw well-aimed fireballs from thin air, change from day to night, and conjure packs of giant were-pitbulls wherever convenient).  The kids had almost no character development or background up to this point and only enough is given to make it clear what type of cliched good-guy or bad-guy they are.  It doesn't really matter anyway as they all die in a variety of ways that allow the two relevant characters to avoid appearing murderous (a difficult feat in a to-the-death arena battle).

The love story, if it is one, is the weakest point of the movie.  The insecure, cowardly beta-male starts off by announcing that he loves the heroine at hackneyed moments, though I suspect that was insincere and intended to play the system of sponsors for support.  Despite multiple discussions of the importance of this, it is never clear what this means or if the magic medicine deliveries are from them or the show's director.  Later, Mr. Whiney caves to peer pressure to hunt down his girlfriend with the pack of evil bad-guys.  Despite this, all is soon forgiven and they share some dull moments together, staring at each other chastely, while the music picks up to let us know they are indeed having a moment.  I haven't read the book and so it is not obvious whether their romance is an act for the tv cameras (and thus their lack of chemistry is intended) or this is all supposed to be sincere.

The movie was both too long and lacked motivation and character development.  In adapting this to the screen, perhaps they should have edited down the numerous sequences that added nothing to the overall plot and instead focused on the basics.  These problems do not bode well for the next three films in the series.",1365724800,,3067,4.781783681214422

4945768,1,B0063FQREO,"I waited to see this on TV and I'm glad I did.  While the book was not for the squimish, at least there was a fuzzy story line.  The movie jumps into the action with only a brief introduction.  In some misleading action, the camera delicately averts its eye at the possibility of a young deer being killed by a bow-hunting Katniss--no such luck when she is (and the other ""tributes"") are aiming at each other.

I thought that the movie captured the spirit of the book. Characters were true to the book although they could have gotten either very cheesy, or the movie could have turned into an action only movie.

Superb movie for the Kindle Fire HD. Quality was excellent!

One side comment. Actually watched the movie in three segments. Don't know how I would have felt watching 2-1/2 hours in a theater, although I'm sure the big screen experience would have been enjoyable.",1365638400,,593,4.794117647058823

4945797,1,B0063FQREO,"Headache while watching the movie? Yes. After some scenes, I soon decided to skip the scenes where the camera seems to be held by someone with parkinson's disease. That was about 40% of the movie. The earlier scenes were bearable but then I noticed that the camera movements slowly started to cause discomfort.

I was told this was being done by some experimental director? I don't know if it's true, but if it is then this guy needs to learn to do experimental films on non-big production movies.

Main complaint is the style of the movie...don't remember much on the content.",1365638400,3,577,4.702970297029703

I didn't read the book because I leave fictional stories for movies, and I really liked it.  I usually do not like strong female leads because I feel they are either annoying or overly bossy.  I actually think most movies with strong female leads just try and go overboard with the role.  This one seemed perfect.  She seemed logical (for the most part) and very believable.  The story itself is very interesting as I like post-apocalyptic type settings.  The special effects are pretty good and not too over done.  The fire suit they wear looks good and not cheesy.

The acting from the main two characters was flat and emotionless.  Also for everyone to be hungry you always see everyone eating and while the people in these mysterious districts are supposed to be dirt poor they somehow can all afford to have the latest video technology in their homes.

4945830,1,B0063FQREO,"I love the movie, however, was extremely disappointed when the Blu Ray disc kept stopping...or lost audio, or when the video started to pixellate. Very very disappointed!",1365465600,,170,5.333333333333333
4945831,1,B0063FQREO,Trying Amazon Prime videos for the first time. The captions were out of sync with the audio track and ruined the whole experience for me big time.,1365465600,,146,4.444444444444445
4945832,4,B0063FQREO,"Another year in Hollywood and we have another dozen or so films about a future less bright and less livable than the present.  In the case of ""The Hunger Games"", the film is a tight adaptation of a bestselling novel of the same name, and the first in a trilogy.  The movie takes place in America, one where the national government has quelled an uprising by those outside the capital, and now has dictatorial control over the entire continent.  The country is now divided into 12 known districts, along with the capital.  The title of the film refers to an annual event held in this futuristic American capital whereby two representatives from each district, so 24 in total, fight to the death in a forest outside the capital.  The movie follows the trials of our heroine as she volunteers for the Hunger Games, trains for them, and then wins.

The film itself clocks in at almost 2.5 hours, but it passes quickly as action and dialogue blend seamlessly from slow scenes to fast scenes.  The acting was great, considering that the cast consisted primarily of small name actors and actresses, with an occasional star past their prime thrown in to provide key roles.  The latter includes Stanley Tucci and Woody Harrelson.  The main roles however go to relative newcomers, with Jennifer Lawrence being the standout.  Her unique face complements her beautiful and strong physique very well.  Once we get past the acting however, the rest of the movie is quite average.  The soundtrack was forgettable, which was regrettable given that the multiple settings of the movie offered the movie's makers fertile ground to cook up a wonderful score, whether it be of original creations or rehashed tracks.  I imagine Holst's Jupiter would have been great background music for the chariot scene, while Copeland's Appalachian Spring would have been perfect for the scenes in heroine's home village.  The cinematography was average, with no ""wow"" scenes that were chock plenty in other 2012 releases such as the ""The Hobbit"", ""John Carter"", or even ""Brave"".  The special effects were also low key, about on par with that found in a TV miniseries or HBO special.

Probably my biggest complaint about the film was the world it took place in.  The movie takes place in a dystopian future where democracy has given way to dictatorship.  The foundation of this dictatorship is guilt and penance.  The outside districts, as penance for their rebellion, offer up tribute to the capital in the form of their children, 24 of which must suffer in the annual Hunger Games.  This entire premise is so hokey and synthetic.  Human history has countless examples of dictatorships to model a film's context after, but they all share something in common, and that is fear.  Specifically, every dictatorship that ever existed was grounded on either the fear of a subversive minority or fear of a looming external enemy.  Maybe the best example is the Roman Empire, which manufactured fear of both.  Roman rulers stayed in power by selling themselves as defenders of the realm against Rome's feared enemies; first Carthage, then Jews, then Christians, then the Germanic tribes, and finally each other as the empire split apart.  And all along the way there was the fear of slave revolts that really enabled Rome's rulers to maintain a police state throughout the empire.  The gladiatorial combats sponsored by Rome, which was a key inspiration for ""The Hunger Games"", was where Rome's captured enemies were disposed of.  Guilt and penance were of little use in keeping Roman emperors in power.  Yet nowhere in this film do we see the national government, the capitol, use fear of the Other as a way to keep its hold on power.  So overall, a film that stands out for its casting and acting; which is a rarity in Hollywood these days.

As for this package; well the film on the disc matches the theatrical release; no extended edition here.  The trailers are nothing special.  So for the patient fan, I would recommend waiting until all 3 films are available together in one package.",1365465600,,4048,4.87280701754386
4945833,4,B0063FQREO,"This movie is a very interesting concept of what the future might hold. For who ?.........Who knows..... Jennifer Laurance plays the lead role extremely well, of a young self-taught survivor with the presence of mind to know that she doesn't know it all.  Refreshing. The storyline was interesting with a few unexpected twists. The violence was there but with a minamal amount of blood and gore. The special effects were good also. I don't normally watch this kind of movie but it caught and held my attention, and from the way it ended, I'm looking for, and forward to a possible sequel.",1365465600,,588,4.764705882352941
4945834,2,B0063FQREO,"I was talked into reading the books and then seeing the movie.  I just don't get it.  I don't understand why this is considered so wonderful.  The author is not very good at building suspense and creating characters that the reader (in this case the audience) can relate to on any level.

I realize it's told in a different time in the supposed future, but the characters are not really likeable, nor well developed.  Maybe if we spent more time really getting to know their motivations better and find a way to relate to their situation it would be compelling, but it's just not.  The movie follows the book very closely, which actually might be why I found it so boring and the characters uninteresting.  I think that if they'd gone with using the book as a spring board for something slightly more creative, then the movie could have benn a lot better.

Instead, they followed the book as if it were the script and this is why it fails.  The book was a mere shell--so a movie based on the book follows suit.  There were some really interesting ideas, but in both genres they just never feel fully developed.  It's too bad.  The premise was interesting.

I realize I'm in the minority, but that's just my opinion.",1365465600,,1215,4.518348623853211

4945836,1,B0063FQREO,"This movie is horrible. I'd recommend Leonard Part 6 or Howard the Duck over this, and those are truly dreadful films.

4945838,3,B0063FQREO,"I saw this in the theaters. When I saw that they Amazon were allowing Prime members to watch it for free, I allowed my cousin's kids to watch it. Even they thought the movie was overhyped. I understand the books were best sellers, but a ""Lottery""-like movie and basically a PG-fied Battle Royale, viewers watched this like it was 2012's greatest unique movie. Seeing it again for the second time here on Amazon just reaffirmed to me that this movie just wasn't great.",1365465600,,467,4.63855421686747

4945850,5,B0063FQREO,Many book adaptations include a great deal of poetic license by the movie director. This movie is near a literal translation and what is not exactly the same is either an improvement or superfluous. The sense of lethal control exerted by the Capitol is clear as is the papmpered life of its citizens and the barren lives of those of District 12. If you enjoyed the book you will find the movie a visual treat.,1365465600,,409,4.466666666666667

It was interesting to see someone else's interpretation of the characters, and I thought it captured the book as well as a movie could.  I should admit that I find the books interesting but also uncomfortable, and I had the same reaction to the movie.  Jennifer Lawrence was very compelling, even in her flatter moments.",1365465600,,409,4.732394366197183
4945859,5,B0063FQREO,"I purchased this movie initially because my grandson went to see it and I wanted to know what he was exposed to as he is 12 years old.  I was truly expecting not liking it, but I surprised myself as I ended up loving it.  The idea where kids are killing kids is deplorable in order to win your life and go back home a hero is pretty haunting, but this movie brought out the humanity as well.  To see the different types of personalities which depict how some of the kids really enjoyed the killing of humans, and also displayed the hearts of kids who really cared for one another and only defended themselves and protected others was so important.  The Hunger Games was enjoyable because of one young lady had a good heart, which showed immediately when she took the place of her younger sister; she stood in her sister's stead.  Love was also in The Hunger Games; let's not dismiss that!  This one young lady made the difference, and changed many people by just being herself.  The writer, with the producer and director, and the rest of the filming staff really did well in my opinion.  They were very sensitive and caring how this movie was made.  I encourage you to see this with an open mind, and grasp the message of this movie.",1365465600,,1234,4.400881057268722

4945861,3,B0063FQREO,"I read the book and didn't think the movie would be as compelling. While the movie missed a lot of the shadings of each person's personality, it hit the main points of the story to make it a good adventure but lacking in character development. Jennifer Lawrence was very good but could not save the shallow script. The book will probably become a classic but not this movie.",1365465600,,374,4.514705882352941
4945862,5,B0063FQREO,"I refused to watch this movie for a long time. Even though others raved about it, I didn't think much of a 'futuristic sacrificial killing'  plot line.

The cast and performance to me were spot on, especially Jennifer Lawrence, only adding to this film believability. Not sure why this bad ass tom boy act works so well for her just as it did in 'Winter's Bone' but I have to say, she is seriously attractive in this role.

Looking forward to the next in the saga. Hope it's as good!",1365465600,,535,4.393939393939394

The movie is fun but especially after reading the books it is thought provoking as well. At first while interesting it seems far fetched, but after thinking about it a bit more it may not be as far fetched as we would think.

Look at the reality TV shows. If there really was a hunger games most people would tune in to watch.

Think a government won't suppress and lock down it's people look around the world. Syria is an active example but there are many.

The character development was good and to my relief the violence wasn't too graffic which I thoroughly appreciated.  It was definitelly an entertaining movie with a unique plot that has captured my attention. I'm now tempted to read the books for all the details a movie just can't capture in a two hour timespan. I'm looking forward to the second movie.  The reason for four rather than five stars is that most, not all, plot developments are  cliche keeping it a rosy movie for the masses but detracting from having any real impact on the movie watcher.",1365465600,,664,4.6581196581196584

These words will haunt you after you realize the significance of them. Poor Katniss Aberdeen is a native of district 12, an area where coal mining is the primary way of life. She lost her father in a mine collapse roughly 4 years ago and is struggling to support her 12 year old sister and mother. She takes to the woods to hunt for food. These hunting skills work in her favor when she volunteers to take the place of her sister for the 74th Hunger games.

What are the hunger games, you ask? Two ""tributes"" from each of the 12 districts, 1 male and 1 female, are picked at random to participate in a ritual of anything goes war. All 24 are released in an environment and expected to fight until only one remains. Basically, being selected means your death certificate has been signed.

""Catnip"", her nickname, and her district 12 partner Peeta do exceptionally well and survive the first few nights of the Hunger Games. Not wanting to spoil anything, they outlast nearly half of their competition that died within the first few minutes of being released. Talk about a bloodbath!

Why did I give it 4 stars instead of 5? I've read some of the book and thought the movie glossed over some important things.

1. In the beginning when Catnip climbs through the fence, she does it without any hesitation whatsoever. The book makes a big deal about her listening to the hum of it and how careful she is to make sure the power is turned off. There was no indication of this at all in the movie.

2. I wasn't a fan of how the movie broke down the memory of Catnip and Peter. There wasn't really a reason to do it that way, and I think the scene actually should have been longer.

3. The mockingjays seem to have a rich history about them in the book including the role they played in the rebellion,  but they play an extremely small part in the movie. A few more lines of dialogue in the hunger games woods with Rue could have helped the movie a lot.",1365379200,2,1984,4.3432432432432435

4945912,2,B0063FQREO,"After reading many reviews for this movie, I had rather high expectations. Reviews such as the first one here on Amazon calling it a ""Masterpiece"". Perhaps this reviewer saw a different movie than I did. I know one thing. This movie is no masterpiece.

This is a movie that I would consider a ""B"" movie. Not much of a budget, poor writing, costumes are a joke (think Rocky Horror costumes). It is the story that gives me the biggest problem. It is totally unbelievable. Yes, I know what type of movie it is, but still, for even this type of movie, the believability issue did not come close to hitting the mark. The acting is pretty bad. The lead actress is good, she holds the entire movie together. However, after the first ten minutes, you will see exactly what I mean. The movie never gets any better nor does the flow change. It is like a movie shot in ZombieVision.

Basically, this movie is about kids killing other kids in an annual event. The contestants are chosen according to where they live. The young girl, the lead actress, goes along with it and of course, is the winner. Plot is totally predictable.

I think this movie is one of those movies that people give a good review because others have. I have rented a lot of movies this year, watched a lot of free ones with Prime and on Netflix. Honestly, this movie rates as one of the poorest this year.

Masterpiece? Even for free, I would not recommend this movie unless you are really bored and have nothing else whatsoever to do.

4945914,4,B0063FQREO,I thought they did a good job taking out the parts of the book that would have made the movie too long but didn't contribute much to the story either.  I guess they also had to make the dogs as dogs and not with the other tribute's faces or it would have been too scary.  But they did a nice job with the arena and most of the other aspects.

4945918,4,B0063FQREO,"The movie is excellent.  Fairly true to the book.  Outstanding blue-ray picture quality and sound.

The only thing I'm not thrilled about has nothing to do with the movie itself, but rather Hollywood's insistence on squeezing a few extra dollars out of consumers by jacking up the price and including a DVD I don't want or need, and an ultraviolet copy I don't want or need.  I'd pay $20 for just the blue-ray disc that I do want, but if this wasn't a gift for someone who really, really wanted this movie in blue-ray (and the fact that i couldn't find just the blue-ray disc), I would never pay $30 for three copies of the same movie, in two formats I won't ever use.

4945933,5,B0063FQREO,This movie is action packed. Its hard to watch in the way you don't want to see any kids die but you root for your favorite.

I felt there was not enough of an emotional crescendo to the film and the second half felt a little lackluster and the premise and plto points could have been better developed in some parts.

4945935,3,B0063FQREO,"I feel like this was a book that was fairly widely read and so the movie should've attempted to stick to the story as much as possible. To that end, a few things were missing from the movie that bothered me. First, the entire AVOX subplot is missing. This added to how evil we see the capital as being, and it was noticeably missing. Second, they don't even bother to show all the contestants at the beginning of the hunger games. There are only 20 people standing there and there should be 24. Finally, the different origin of the mocking jay pin was a bit annoying.",1365206400,,567,4.3584905660377355

My only issue, and this is true of all movies containing ""teens"" as main characters, is that they portray them as being much too adult-like.  I can still remember being a teen, and there is no way I ever had the courage, pride or integrity of any of these kids.  I can also say I have never met even a 20-something that would approach a situation this way.  But, that IS what makes it fantasy and I would never sit through a movie with real teens in it as that would be like babysitting.

So, great movie!  Don't hesitate to watch.",1365206400,,770,4.120805369127517
4945937,1,B0063FQREO,"Most book to movie translations fail because the filmmakers miss the powerful thematic points that made the book so successful.  This is one of those movies.  The ideas presented in this film basically break down into a simple coming of age/rebel against the system tale yet this movie manages to exert none of the really big themes relevant to the powerful themes of the book.  The heroes end up in exactly the same place the movie started.  Not a single character grew from their experiences, no one rebelled against the system in any meaningful way, and all ended well.  This was a real disappointment.

Cinematically it was hard to watch.  They went for 'hand-held' style inspired, I'm sure, by 'The Blair Witch'.  As a fan of the 'hand-held' look, this was just a bit too much for me to handle- even 'Saving Private Ryan' managed a nice blend of slow and steady with frenetic 'hand-held'.  There are several shots in which people are sitting still or not moving while the camera flails about.

All that said, I was definitely impressed by the actors themselves.  They delivered lines that otherwise would have fallen flat or gone the route of dramatic cheese with a touch of grace.",1365206400,14,1186,4.736585365853658

I mean that perhaps I give more credit to the plot (of the movie) because I know what they are trying to do (from the book).

Story and plot was obviously written by a juvenile with fertile imagination and yet misguided understanding of science as well as the humanities.
On the one hand, there appears to be a lot of advanced science and technology among the rich in the future and yet the ruling class is not smart enough to feed the poor.  On the other hand, the wicked rich who have lost their hearts and minds can still effect some sporadic kindness and mercy so that our chosen heroine can have a chance to survive along with her admiring competitor.

Regardless the buffering took no longer than thirty seconds before starting back exactly where it left off.",1365120000,,338,4.65
4945962,5,B0063FQREO,"When assessing movies for quality, holywooders often fall way short of the top of the scale -- some however shine beyond the scale -- One movie that was way beyond the scale was The Mission staring Robert Dinero. It is not often when a movie that I expected to be limited turns out to be fantastic. One example of this was John Carpenter.

Now, after being sure that I would not like a movie where teans are both the heros and the villans (after all, haven't we had enough of those with the likes of Buffy the Vampire Slayer or Power-rangers?), I watched this one with a major lack of expectations.

This is one movie that is WAY over the Top of the Quality Movie Scale -- the story pulls you in fairly quickly, then it keeps you focused. Yes, you pick favorites and hope they get to be successful in their mission. But the story is inbedded in such politicalism and socialism that given everything that seems to be going on today feel to be a part of this story.

The acting was supperb from all the cast, the editing did not leave anyone wondering if there would or should be a directors cut -- and the story spell was magical.

I must say, I did not expect Amazon to provide this in their Prime Selections so that I could see it with out additional outlay of funds, but I am truely glad they did. I will probably mark this movie as one to add to my private movie collection once my finances start to improve again, until then, I will watch this one via Amazon Prime a couple more times.

Fantastic for sure.
----
Update -- since my original viewing of this movie, I have read the book. I must be honest, I was avoiding both because of the idea of Teen on Teen violence this glamourizes -- I do understand the critics denouncement on that note. The movie was a brilliant composition, but the story does focus and glamorizes the violence which it seems we are seeing more and more of in our real life society -- Without reading the book, much of the understanding of this movie is lost -- this is actually NOT a story that glamorizes the violence, but is a cultural commentary of a society that is in fact degrading in a path leading to Tyranny -- the people are being placed into a state of growing fear to encourage us to surrender freedoms and protections that we used to stand up for. There is reason to believe there will be some kind of civil clash that could lead to the political climate as seen in this story -- So while this is a fiction - fantasy story, it is also a possibility and thus, the story does not glamorize the violence but shows a society where the violence is being used to suppress the people's freedoms.

I still recommend the movie, but remember, by not reading the book, you are missing out on a bunch of understanding behind the story -- and the significance of various events and symbolic components. Watch the movie, then read the book, then re-watch the movie -- there will be a significant change in how you perceive the movie as a result.

And if you have a Kindle and the Amazon Prime service, you can ""borrow"" the book without further cost -- it really is a value unto itself.",1365033600,,3113,4.338487972508591

4945964,1,B0063FQREO,"I know I am jaded, but this movie is awful by anyone's standards.  The rave reviews cause me to question people's motives and agenda, or limited attention span.  The largest missing piece here is any semblance whatsoever of a plot.  I spent the entire movie trying to figure out why teenagers were running around in the woods killing each other as entertainment for both the freaks with bad hair in the movie as well as the actual audience.  Something about being ""tributes"" and saving society at-large.  Whatever.

This is not Tolkien, nor Fleming, nor even J. K. Rowling.  And it certainly isn't Heinlein, Serling, Sagan or Bradbury.  This is a boring, boring movie.  My advice is to skip it.",1365033600,2,694,4.764705882352941

4945968,4,B0063FQREO,"Like many others, I am sort of wondering how or why this is considered ""young adult fiction"" other than the fact that the primary protagonists are teenagers.  This was a great read (and movie watched) for *this* adult, although I will admit that I found some of the violence a little gratuitous if not outright over the top.  I'm not entirely sure I would want my younger teenagers reading this based simply on the amount of violence.

The political intrigue, the clever blending of current political and social trends into the plot and story itself, all very well done.  Simply a great read, whether ""young adult"" or just plain adults.  But I would draw the line, say, around age 14 or so in terms of exposure to that ""young"" audience.  This could easily have just been classified ""fiction.""  Most interesting dystopian story I have read or watched since some of the masters of the game, Orwell and Rand, and that is considerably high praise.",1365033600,,943,4.713414634146342
4945969,1,B0063FQREO,"Gee, where do I start?

I understand the story came from a popular book (which I did not read) and many reviewers here were disappointed in that the film lacked key plot lines and story points from the novel, so I'll limit my comments strictly to the movie as shown.

First and foremost, the premise was poorly defined and seemed far from being believable. The hunting scenes reflected very one-dimensional writing lacking in tension (once again, maybe the book was much better). The whole thing was predictable, plodding and simplistic.  What's up with this so-called ""forest""? It sure looked like an artificial world under a dome, did anyone catch that?  You know, kinda like the Truman Show.  And what were these monster-dog things and that instant fire storm? This stuff was apparently generated on-demand from this master control room (also another Truman Show rip-off). The scene with the evil dog-wolf things indicated these creatures were somehow generated on-demand like something from Star Trek's Voyager's Holo-deck (poor CGI, by the way). Were they supposed to be ""natural"" animals released into the environment from holding pens?

The second problem was the ending: what happened, did they run out of money and just stop filming in the middle of the final scene?  Geez, you had all this big build-up and for what?  We saw scenes of District 11 rioting, what became of that (I suspect the book probably had much more detail)?  There was a hint of some sort of social uprising but no follow through.  Supposedly, they've been doing ""Hunger Games"" for 74 years yet no one decided to show any resistance until NOW?!!

If this were intended as some low-budget sci-fi B-movie, I'd give it a charitable 3-star rating, but Hollywood and the elitist arts & entertainment media cabal all went ga-ga over this -- they hyped it up as the-must-see-film of the year.  Glad I didn't pay nine bucks to see this at a theater.

I can't understand why ANYONE would give this thing a 5-star rating; in fact, I challenge any 5-star reviewer to explain the premise behind this film!",1364947200,5,2073,4.871794871794871

4945971,3,B0063FQREO,"WARNING --Psuedo Spolier.

It is a modern day re-telling of The Lottery, the 1948 short fiction from Shirley Jackson. It was largely predictable and without serious twists and turns. The better path would have been to give the characters more development and more reason to kill one another than because the rules demanded it. I watched it in two sessions and was multi-tasking whilst doing so. I could not have made it through otherwise. It was rather tiresome. Jennifer Lawrence is not a sympathetic actress, at least in this movie. The character, whose name I believe was Catness, or Cat-in-the-ass...was unattractive not believable. How did she develop all the skills and knowledge?

4945974,2,B0063FQREO,"There are some good parts to The Hunger Games movie, for instance, the casting is superb, and the acting is quite good. Ross manages to tell the story more or less, packing quite a bit in the film's 144 minutes. Unfortunately, that's where the good stuff ends.

If you've read the book, you know that The Hunger Games includes a huge amount of detail, and trying to scale that level of story down into a single movie is a daunting task. If I were directing, I would have likely lobbied heavily for two movies: one that gave you the backstory on Panem and Katniss and took you into the capitol as it prepared for the Games, and a second movie beginning in the arena so that there's ample time to give you a sense of closure once the Games come to an end (in addition to showing how the Games develop the characters' relationships). (The story, after all, is more about the before and after of the characters.)

The plot moves much too quickly, leaving the viewer with a sense of incompleteness and a feeling that they're probably missing some things (they are). That's not the biggest flaw in this movie, though I think it's probably one of the main contributing factors. This feeling may also be exacerbated if you just finished reading the books, which I did about 3 weeks ago. Perhaps a second viewing after some time would be more enjoyable.

The biggest issue with The Hunger Games movie is the lack of emotional connection. You don't get to really know the characters. You aren't given much insight into what they feel. There's not enough dialog and human interaction throughout the screenplay to help you make such a connection to the them--especially concerning Katniss.

Part of what makes the books so enrapturing is that you get to experience everything that Katniss does. You know what she's feeling, even though sometimes you don't like it. That's a hard thing to do in a movie where everything switches from first person to third person, and you either have to ""experience"" a character's emotions by their expressions and actions, or they have to tell you (by telling another character) what they're feeling.

*** SPOILERS AHEAD ***

I think the prime example of this movie's flaws lies around the subplot of Rue. In the book, this is a believable interaction--Katniss teams up with the younger girl, helping her along, developing a connection with her, and finally making a plan to seriously cripple the Careers' ability to survive--a plan that goes smoothly until Rue hits a snare and is killed while Katniss watches. It's devastating.

Contrast that with the movie, which compresses this scene in such a way that Katniss meets Rue, teams up, makes a plan, and Rue dies all within about 5 minutes. Yet, in the aftermath, Katniss is devastated. It's a bit hard to sympathize with her though, because we don't really understand how close the two had become.

Likewise, we know in the first book that Katniss has more or less fallen in love with Peeta by the end, even though she refuses to admit it to herself and spends the next two books in the trilogy trying to resolve the internal conflict. But again--the movie utterly fails to clearly demonstrate this critical plot line, and the ending is just a total wreck.

Character development around Cinna, Haymitch, and Effie is also quite weak, yet Cinna and Haymitch play critical roles throughout the final two books. There's a lot of catching up to do in this area if the rest of the movie franchise is going to work.

In conclusion, The Hunger Games movie was a promising idea, that with a different director, might have succeeded. (I still don't understand how Suzanne Collins found all of this acceptable--though, after reading Mockingjay, maybe I should.) I'm encouraged to know that Catching Fire has a different director, and I can only hope that he is able to course correct where Ross and company failed.

My final thought after seeing this movie was only that I hope the series gets a reboot and a remake in my lifetime. A book as good as The Hunger Games deserves an equally good film, and 2012's attempt simply does not do the story justice.

Here's hoping for next time...",1364947200,29,4149,4.7154696132596685

4946016,2,B0063FQREO,"I'm going to keep it simple. The film does not work because of the main character Katniss Everdeen, or more specificially how the producers and director chose to portray her.

The book was from the first person perspective of Katniss, she was the narrator, the reader read what she was thinking, we got to know Katniss, we grew to like her and her hilariously cynical personality.

Now there's a lot of things you can complain about a adaptation. Certainly some things have to be cut for time, some things to get a PG-13 and not a R rating. Those are justifiable things.

I feel like Katniss narration is not one of those justifiable changes. This is a fundamental part of the book that should've been incorporated into the book better. Maybe a more narration from Jennifer Lawrence as Katniss, it was crucial that we heard Katniss's inner voice. This is why the reader sympathized with and rooted for her in the book. In the movie she just seems like a cold, distant girl. The movie is simply the book with the soul ripped away.

They spare no-expense when making the costumes, designing the set, casting but they leave out one of the fundamental elements of the book: Katniss' narration.

Imagine if they made a Catcher in the Rye movie and they didn't have any narration from Holden Caulfield. You're not watching a movie with this thoughful, cynical, funny but ultimatley good hearted kid. You're just seeing this imbalanced kid, walking all around NYC, randomly chatting with nuns, hiring hookers, and dancing with middle aged ladies for no concievable reason.

It's the same with this movie. At best you can see it as a multimedia add-on to the book. You read the book, then you watch this as an added treat. I have no idea why anyone would like this movie otherwise. By itself it's a jumbled mess with all the charm of the book missing.

I feel it's a shame that for a lot of people who haven't read the book but watched the movie they will be completley confused as to why the book commands such a devout following.",1364083200,,2023,4.602777777777778

4946021,3,B0063FQREO,"I ordered this movie and waited in anticipation the way a child waits for Christmas! I have read all three books and the first book is what really got me hooked. There are quite a few things that it changes that the 2nd and 3rd books hinge on.. (i.e. The Mockingjay pin and how Katniss got it and Prim waking up screaming..? It adds to the drama yes... But it takes away from the story line.) It seems almost like when they made the movie, no one bothered to read at least the 2nd book (Catching Fire) to see what is carried through from the first book. Also, the way the author painted Peeta to be vs how he looked in the movie was kind of a let down... I watched part of the movie before writing this review, I am going to still remain on the side of it's a loose adaptation and only stays true to some parts... If the movie somehow redeems itself, I will update my review... Basically, if you have read the entire trilogy, you will be disappointed... If you haven't... Well you won't know the difference will you? The half of the movie I have watched, all I kept thinking was ""This is not right"" or ""That's not how it was in the book""... As for the pricing of the movie, that is AWESOME! I got it for about 13.00, any other retailer still has it for $20+.",1363910400,,1258,4.159836065573771

4946030,3,B0063FQREO,The order itself came in a timely manner.  I particularly don't like the movie so I could only give it three stars.  I bought it for my wife who probably give it at least 4 stars.,1363737600,,179,3.9444444444444446

4946032,5,B0063FQREO,"I thought the movie closely followed the book with very little deviations. Perhaps the most glaring: the person who gave the Mockingjay pin to Katniss and Katniss's prep team, who have very minor roles here. I won't summarize the movie since there are some really good ones here but would like to address the actors who portrayed the characters. Jennifer Lawrence is perfect as Katniss, as is Liam Hemsworth as Gale. At first, I wasn't sure Woody Harrelson fit the part of Haymitch but he won me over. As did Josh Hutcherson, who seemed too small for Peeta, but he does a great job in this role. There couldn't have been a better person to play Cinna than Lennie Kravitz as well as Donald Sutherland as President Snow - he's the very person I envisioned while reading the book. Excellent acting, a suspenseful, fast-moving plot, and great special effects.

I've watched the movie several times and enjoy it each time. I'm looking forward to the next two in this trilogy.",1363737600,,970,4.705882352941177

The casting, directing, cineamatography, the shot angles, the acting were exceptional.  I recommend it highly.  If you haven't read the books, I suggest you do.  The writing flows, the characters develop, the plot carries the books to the end.  I couldn't put them down.  They just flowed.",1363651200,,393,4.6911764705882355

But what really angers me, is that you can clearly see where someone had written ""Scratched Discard"" on a piece of paper over the DVD cover and it was engraved on the case. So the fact that it seems they knowingly sent me a defective product is pretty upsetting.

I can still use the Ultra-Violet Digital Copy, which is why I didn't return the product. It would have cost me money to return the product, so I just kept it and will use the Digital Copy.",1363305600,,606,4.509090909090909

Hope she dosen't get caught up in all the Hollywood hype, and go off the deep end.  If she stays focused, and real, a lot of new adventures awaits her.  She would be great in ""SnowWhite and the Huntsmun"" if there's going to be a sequel.  If there is to be another Twilight""  with Bellas daughter, she would be good.

4946074,5,B0063FQREO,"This movie, although directed at young adults, is infact, a message to us all.  The concept that it can't happen here, the hunger games is reminiscent of a time long gone.  When power is nested in the few and privileged, and the eternal struggle of youth, against this oppression!  One can feel the anger, that youth are in that eternal struggle against that which adult.  The performance of the movie actors is impressive, although, what movie ever equals the power of the printed word, but this does come very close, Ms. Lawrence performance shows that she really does or has read the novel.  Even in a situation of the imminent horror, or the games which one mistake and she loses not only her life, but the life of another,  her utter confusion during the combat of the games, her indecision about the two men in her life, her fear, her anger. and mix that with her utter hatred for all those that impose themselves, is life just taken by the producers to a level that a teenager imagines their life to be!",1363046400,,1010,4.521978021978022

I'm glad books get people reading, but if the book was the same, no wonder we lag behind the industrialized world in literacy.  Also, and this bugged me alot, wasn't this just a re-write of Battle Royale (which was much better plotted, paced and acted) and Running Man.  Stanley Tucci, say it isn't so.

4946090,5,B0063FQREO,"I watched the movie before I read the book. After ""The Hunger Games"" was released everyone was talking about it! So, of course, I had to see what the buzz was about. This movie was fantastic. It kept you in your seat the entire time and was really entertaining. The only thing I didn't care for (and it's just me!) was that people were taking their children to see this. I mean like 7-11 year olds! I also worked with a woman who's daughter was 11 and she said ""well, she saw the movie and liked it, so I just bought her the books because she wanted to read it"". What!? No! This movie is too violent for young children and at times made me wince. But what do you do? These are the same folks who read Harry Potter to their 4 year old. Anyway! Great movie. No, it doesn't give a lot of detail and I really noticed that after I read the book. I think they could have spared just a few moments and introduced some characters and given their backstory. And for goodness sakes, couldn't they have at least done the scene where Katniss got the mockinjay pin correctly? Very disappointed that the director really skimmed over that and made something else up entirely. Of course, Jennifer Lawrence does an excellent job. She's a great actress and I can't wait to see how the other two installments turn out.",1362787200,,1299,4.349794238683128

4946092,5,B0063FQREO,"I really do love this movie. It's not as good as the book, but movies rarely are. They left out a lot and changed quite a bit, but really, in order to get the story into just 2 1/2 hours they did a great job. Acting was great and so was setting and make-up. This movie is great for anyone who loves adventure, strength, some politics, and just a little romance and angst. It's pretty original. And I was very happy with the fact that the hero is a female but they didn't play that fact up. It's not a feminist tale by any means. So I love this movie and the books it's based on. I'd recommend reading the books first though! They're great and add more to the story when you watch the movie.",1362787200,,690,4.080882352941177
4946093,4,B0063FQREO,"The movie loses something by moving from first person to third person, and fails to do the book justice in a lot of ways, and still manages to be an ok movie in it's own right.",1362700800,,176,3.9166666666666665
4946094,5,B0063FQREO,"I found that the movie was great! I was an avid reader of Hunger Games (even before it was all public and being made into a movie) so I was a little worried the first time I watched it. A while into it, though, I found it was actually fairly true to the book! The characters were spot on. I think Jennifer Lawrence is an amazing actress, especially in regards to emotions and facial expressions (especially when she's in the tube, going up to the arena - the terror is SO REAL). There were a few very very minor changes, which I think added to the story instead of being a problem. I do wish there were some more special features. I'm not sure if there are more on the blu-ray copy or not. It seems that DVDs that used to be full of fun stuff are now JUST the movie, while the blu-rays are all fun. Makes sense to the company, but it's a bit annoying to us since we don't have blu-ray yet.",1362700800,,889,4.085714285714285

We all know what happens so often when really good books are made into medeocre movies.  But let me be quick to say that is NOT the case with this brilliant interpretation of Suzanne Collins' best seller.  The casting could not be better and even knowing the story right through to the outcome, I was still surprised and in suspense the entire running time.  This is a truly remarkable film which exhibits extreme talent from the very beginning to the final edit.

It was a look at the State run amok in the not too distant future, with leaders and a ruling-class population lacking in empathy and focused on entertainment and the finer things in life (sound familiar?).  The story goes to the heart of the fundamental desire for survival, love, and liberty with the portrayal of a young, evolving, female rebel (Katniss Everdeen) who is challenging the State in the only way she knows how.

The movie did an amazing job of setting up the basis for next 3 movies. Jennifer Lawrence's acting was superb. Casting Josh Hutcherson as Peeta...ehh I was not a big fan. His acting was okay...not amazing. The majority of the cast was unknown, and I wish they had done the same when it came to casting Peeta. All in all it was a great film. Lots of action and suspense.

From my wife's perspective a very entertaining movie with a good back story til the end. She didn't seem to think or feel a sequence made sense. having read the books, the movie left out some key parts and references missed key interactions of being outside the wire hunting why it makes sense during the Games.

an entertaining movie, not as good as the book, but few are. we are looking forward to another neighborhood movie night when the sequel(s) come out.

4946152,5,B0063FQREO,"INTENSE. DISTURBING. THOUGHT-PROVOKING. Some of the words that I associate with this movie. Watching it is a truly powerful experience!

Something really did draw me into this movie--whether it was the acting, the directing, the story line  whatever--I really, really empathized with the main characters and felt, at some level, what they were going through. That's movie as art!

Jennifer Lawrence and Josh Hutcherson (I recognized him from ""Bridge to Terabithia"") were superb, and Woody Harrelson put in a memorable performance--running the gamut from quirky, calloused drunk to deeply caring mentor.

I'm seriously considering adding ""The Hunger Games"" to my DVD collection, but I would definitely put it on the same shelf with my copies of ""The Killing Fields,"" ""Hotel Rwanda"" and ""Schindler's List""--movies that celebrate the greatness of the human spirit when confronted with horrific evil.

One lasting impression I will take from ""The Hunger Games"" is a heightened gratitude for the individual freedom we still have in this country--freedom from the despotism and tyranny portrayed in The Hunger Games' futuristic dystopia. Freedom is a precious gift--one to be treasured--and one that is relatively uncommon over the sad course of human history. Another lasting impression I will take from this movie is how it portrayed the disturbing propensity some societies have for viewing human misery and violence as a ""spectator sport.""  It seems to me our culture is drifting dangerously close to that now in some of the violent video games that are flooding the market (and attracting big dollars), car races with their prospects of fiery crashes, and even football (a sport I have dearly loved as a spectator through the years) with its increasing incidence of serious, debilitating injuries. May heaven help us all if we as a society openly sanction and celebrate the misery of others as a valid form of entertainment!

All told, The Hunger Games is a movie worth your while and your utmost reflection.",1361577600,,2007,5.233644859813084

4946154,5,B0063FQREO,"The Hunger Games was everything I expected, but not more than that. I am a huge fan of the series, having read all the books months ago, but I've avoided the movie until all the hype died down, so that I could give an honest opinion, and here it is. The film was terrific, one of the best adaptation of a book I've read. Jennifer Lawrence was absolutely perfect as Katniss and if she doesn't get a ton of awards for the role, there is no justice in Hollywood. That's the good news, however the movie was far from perfect. Friends who went with me and had never read the books, found it to be slow, and didn't understand certain things. At times, I could see their point. Several major things were rushed or just left out of the film. This led to some confusion, and then there's Peeta. I love Josh Hutcherson and thought he was terrific, but the portrayal of Peeta wasn't accurate. He was nowhere near as likeable as he is in the books and he comes off looking like kind of a pussy. The end of the games was also problematic, as they changed a key point that I thought was pivotal going into Catching Fire. It will be interesting to see what they do to fix that before the next film. Overall I loved the movie and thought it was awesome, but if you didn't read the books, you might be a little confused by parts of it and see it as slow. Parts of the film that dragged on were explained through thoughts in Katniss's head during the book. Without knowing what was going on at those points, I could see how some audience members may have been bored with it. The movie and especially the books live up to all the hype and are well worth your time, The Hunger Games is something you are not going to want to miss.",1361491200,,1710,4.216463414634147

I have to say I was very pleased in the way the producers depicted this fantasy arena especially how the ""show"" was being captured. This took some getting used to when I was reading the book.

Now for the movie. I've read lots of reviews that say the movie was close to the book. Wow, not sure what book they are comparing it too as the movie did not follow many of the stories described in the book. The movie does not develop the ""relationship"" with Gale.  The death of Rue, followed by the district 12 three finger salute (which would never have been aired by the Capitol) and the revolt/uprising in the movie do not follow the book. The movie makes it look like District 11 revolts,  but it's actually District 8 that revolts. There are too many inconsistencies for an ok book that makes the movie not enjoyable. I would recommend not reading the book as this might not bias you opinion of the movie. Glad I watched this as a rental.",1361232000,,908,4.463855421686747

4946189,5,B0063FQREO,"'The Hunger Games' is the first book of a trillogy. Followed by 'Catching Fire,'  and 'Mocking Jay.' This strikes me as a violent novel whose demographic is teenage girls. It has a  ///SPOILER love triangle between the main character and two guys SPOILER/// sort of the Twilight romance kind of thing.

I read this like my last year in college and actually thoroughly enjoyed it. It is an easy read no lofty vocabulary. It has dysfunction and resolution, and a unique perspective that combines what a dystopia and post-apocalyptic world might be like.

Guy or girl( you ) it's a fun read.",1360713600,4,588,4.735294117647059

If you want to see more realistic, non boring proper version of what this series was copied from both the novels and movie check out Battle Royale 1/2.  Far greater films, way more fast paced and doesn't tale 45 mins to get started.  Hunger games is like a watered down, twillight infused, boring version of Battle Royale.  Nothing worth watching more than once, and compared to the book unless you read the book you won't undertsand have the weird crap going on all over the place here and there are parts of this film that will have you facepalming it's that dumb.  Battle Royale is far superior and more worth your time.  Not impressed with Hunger Games won't bother seeing the next one.",1360540800,6,763,4.453237410071942

All the action and suspense from the books comes alive in this movie, and the movie is 10 times better in Blu-ray and with a surround sound system. Even though many parts of the movie are violent, there's not too many bloody and gory parts UP CLOSE. Don't get me wrong, the Hunger Games is not for the faint of heart. There is a lot of blood.

4946211,5,B0063FQREO,"This was a bit of a shock to watch initially (with kids killing kids and all); but if you can deal with that, the underlying plot theme is very engaging. Some might argue that it takes on a Rich vs. Poor vibe, but I prefer to think it tackles the very real issues of class warfare, government manipulation, and societal contentment.  In any case, you will like this film.",1360281600,,371,4.3768115942028984
4946212,5,B0063FQREO,"One cannot deny the attraction of the Hunger Games movie and the great casting and screenplay based upon the popular book series.  What makes this DVD set unique is the very detailed 'making of' segments on the extra disk.  It is about as long as the movie itself if you watch it all!  It covers every angle of making this fascinating movie, from location scouting, to set design, costumes, special effects, martial arts and weapons training for the cast, the director's vision, how some elements were added for clarity that were not in the book, and how the movie is (to my mind) actually a better vision of Susan Collin's world than might have resulted at others' hands.  The amount of thought and work that goes into making a movie is clearly evident, and the supplemental videos will take you through the entire production, and beyond to the opening and fan events after, plus interviews with most of the main cast.  Highly recommended.",1360281600,,940,4.742331288343558

4946233,5,B0063FQREO,A neat premise that I was fearing they were going to wimp out on since the theme is considered controversial now a days.  In our society of child worship the thought that in a dystopian future under aged people might have to fight for their lives is so foreign that few might understand the underlying ideas behind the story.  It is good to see an young adult book treating young adult minds like they are capable of understanding something deeper than talking sponges and interracial explorers.,1360022400,,495,4.744186046511628

4946250,5,B0063FQREO,"I heard about the series as the movie was about come out and saw it in a theater opening weekend. It instantly made me a huge fan of the series I rewatched it twice on home video, but did not watch any of the special features. I noticed a lot more the 2nd viewing and a bit more the 3rd time.

Amazing. Among other things, it was great at being an action movie with a plot. Collins did an excellent job of putting deep themes in a youth-friendly context. Excellent setting and storyline. Riveting pacing. Most scenes were fast paced, telling a lot of story in minimal time. A few key scenes felt slower, which seemed like an appropriate use of contrast to highlight their importance to the story - the prime examples were the reaping, Katniss' private session and Rue's death. The characterization/acting was great - idealized, yet still imperfect and identifiable.

I was happy with the movie and want more at the same time; it is a good thing when the worst you can say is that you want more. The movie seemed to be a very effective adaptation overall. Mostly, the movie changes seemed not bad just different, although Peeta seemed much more impressive in the book. Some third person scenes were a great way to do exposition in a movie format, as opposed to the book's strict first person - the prime examples were Crane's appearances and the District 11 riot. I was certainly able to follow the movie without the book. I've now read each of the books twice. I was able to follow the 2nd book based on the 1st movie without having read the 1st book yet.

One of my few criticisms is how some of the violence was masked with shaky camera work. I at least wish that the censoring had been less obtrusive. That might be about getting a PG-13, aiming at teenage girls in general, or simply a moviemaking screwup. Shaky camera work did fit the hallucination plot point. I didn't care for the score; I thought it was overbearing in the emotional scenes.

There were a few apparent plot holes
how did District 12 get away with lax Peacekeepers?
why didn't they continue shooting at Katniss? (Was Peeta that persuasive? Is Clove limited at throwing knives upwards?)
why didn't Cato finish off Peeta? (okay, maybe Cato was also reeling form the tracker jacker attack)
why did Clove delay in killing Katniss and thus lose her chance?

Katniss' volunteering reminded me of Mulan.

I was struck by how some, especially Peeta, kept their humanity.
I liked the alternating views, although I felt there could have been more from outside the arena at times.

I liked Caesar and Effie. The interview scene emphasized Caesar's showmanship. Many of the non-12 interviews weren't shown at all or shown in short clips, an exampel of the fast pacing). Glimmer was so bubbly, the tribute parade was the main topic in Katniss' interview, and that Katniss was stunned for a bit before she hulks out. The president and gamemaker in particular were a subtle yet undeniable evil. How come their physical apperance that was relatively unmodified (by Capitol standards)?

I figured there might be dramatic tension when the two from the same district face each other, and there was.

District 12 clearly resembled Depression-era Appalachia. The garish colors and advanced technology of the Capitol seemed like intentional exaggerated contrast.

When Katniss said she never wanted kids, it reminded me of ""you're thrown the worst fear that can ever be hurled, fear to bring children into the world"" from Bob Dylan's ""Masters Of War"".

To me, Haymitch came off as a sad drunk; it was obvious his experiences had driven him to drink.

I wonder if the other tribute parade outfits were *caricatured* representations of each district. Also, that scene was the most obvious Roman/gladiator connection. For instance, I noticed some Roman salutes - right arm pointed upward, bent at the elbow, palm facing left (the Fascist version is locked elbow, palm facing down).

I wondered why more districts didn't train volunteers (though Katniss had experience from all that bowhunting).

I'm not sure what was real, what was done for the cameras and what became real because the characters acted that way. I'd say this is another one of Collins' artistic points. The Katniss/Peeta relationship (with her having to play along) is a prime example of that.

Concern about Jen's weight seemed like usual Hollywood image BS, not to mention that the males weren't a target. Katniss and Gale are hunters anyway, and Peeta is from the relatively good part of town. Jen usually acted Katniss' age, but it occasionally showed that she's a few years older, particularly in the scenes with Rue. With fiction in general, many youth characters seem older, but many adult characters are idealized too.

I figured something was up with the pile of stuff, but I first thought the dirt piles were makeshift burials for the tributes who died early. Rue's small size must have helped navigate the minefield before Katniss took her shots to set it off. It was a striking moment when the failed guard quickly got his neck snapped.

Rue's scenes with Katniss were the most genuinely emotional part of the movie, including Katniss' funeral ritual and the District 11 riots after Rue's death.
Is the characters' race a point or a coincidence? District 11 _is_ poor, Southern, agricultural and black. I noticed Cinna's non-flamboyance more than his race. I can imagine readers overlooking a small section of the book, especially if it's _convenient_ for them to do so.

Prop-wise, I was impressed by the camo jobs and the sleek weaponry. (I wonder why the arrows didn't have four-bladed broadheads)

The Katniss/Rue hand gesture reminded me of the Boy Scout sign (that uses the three middle finders of the _right_ hand, with different arm/elbow positioning)

At the time, I thought ""What happened to District 13? Redistricting?"" and ""What became of the rioting in District 11?"". This was explained later in the series.
First person narration limits exposition, which can be both good and bad. Collins created a new setting and only shows us a little bit of it.
I wish there was another scene during or after the credits.

My favorite scene? Peeta's interview.",1359936000,,6190,4.84280303030303

4946254,3,B0063FQREO,"I chose an okay rating for this movie because I read the book.  Perhaps, had I not read the book and seen the movie I would have liked it better?  The thing about the book was the frightening urgency of some of the situations the tributes found themselves in,  and the compelling empathy it evoked in me for the characters.  The movie didn't scratch the surface to develop that connection at all. I did, however,  like the eye into the gamemaker's studio and the interference his panel of technicians  could inflict upon the tributes in the arena... well done.  The portrayal of the capitol district people was splendid with their extravagant  and bodacious costumery(is that really a word?) and pageantry.  In the end, these two things are what elevated my rating to okay.

They had some great special effects.  They changed aspects of the book that I had issues with, but I guess that will happen anytime you put a book onto the big screen.

I can truthfully say that I had trouble in the first three chapters understanding the terminology, and the strangeness of the settings.  However, once I made it past chapter 3, I was spellbound.  I had trouble putting the book aside to do household chores, and it was often haunting to me at night when I would sleep.  All in a all, I'd say that it is probably one of the best books I have read in many years, and as far as the subject matter goes, I can now visualize our world and the US being in such a state of destruction.

4946262,1,B0063FQREO,"While watching this movie, the first thought that came to mind was, ""Do we even value the human life?""

The movie is about an extreme entertainment called Hunger Games for the rich people at the ""Capitol"". The Hunger Games is about each individual survival by brutally killing 23 other opponents.

I found no value on this killing game other than just to satisfy people's ego or desires. In many way our society has became the Hunger Games itself without us realizing that we too participate in it. People in our society become very selfish and willing to do anything good and bad to others as ling as that would help us to win, moving up on the rank.

It is never OK to kill people and this movie certainly do not live this value.

Good lessons that is important in life such as selfless attitude from Katniss by volunteering herself in exchange of her sister, teamwork between Katniss and Peeta were minimally shown in the movie. Good values and lessons of life were definetely not the center story of this movie.

I would not recommend this film to anyone, especially to young people. There are many better choice of film out there that can inspire your life, lifted up your spirit, and giving life lessons that can be used in real life.",1359849600,2,1240,4.5675675675675675

I just thought that the whole movie was awful. One of the thing that I found strange was durning movie there were long period of silence, which seem strange to me.

4946274,1,B0063FQREO,"This movie was praised as one of the next great movie trilogies for a time to come. So I was curious and expected it to be pretty good. But I must have missed something- there must be something there that I simply could not see. I just could not swallow the premise; it just wasn't believable at all. Frankly it was absurd. But I tried to ignore that and figured that it would be a cool movie anyway, because after all there's tons of movies with absurd plots, but they usually make up for it. But it was really boring! I could not believe how uninteresting it was. I know a lot of people were shocked with the supposed violence, but honestly I didn't noticed any at all- it may have helped if it actually WERE a little violent, but alas. Well maybe compared to a Tinker Bell movie, it can be considered a little violent. It was just one of those movies you cannot stand the sight of after a while. And it would NOT end- it just kept droning on and on. And all the while I kept telling myself, ""It will be okay, something interesting, some morsel of excitement will be given any moment now, maybe there will even be some kind of climax.""

4946301,1,B0063FQREO,"Where's the story? Why do these people want to watch 12 year olds kill each other? Why is society split between psychopaths with crazy hairdos living in the year 3000, and seemingly normal people living in the 19th century? Is that Will Smith's son or is that a girl? Oh, I guess it doesn't matter now because he/she is already dead. Are the CGI computer dogs computer generated by the computer forest or are they supposed to be real dogs made by the computer forest? And if the CGI computer dogs are CGI then is the CGI city a real city or a computer manifested city? Is this like the Matrix? The computer dogs must be CGI within CGI because the deer at the beginning was real. At least it wasn't as bad as the equally overrated Battle Royale.

4946318,2,B0063FQREO,"Jennifer Lawrence, though quite good in other movies, such as the X-Men series, is lame in this completely unconvincing adaptation of the popular kids book, ""The Hunger Games."" The book itself was, while geared to teenagers (or tweens), was entertaining enough to keep readers' attention and plausible, though a bit heavy handed with the allegory.

This movie version drops all the subtleties and just proceeds with the action, and that action is stilted and unbelievable. Woody Harrelson does a credible job, though his character has changed from the book version, and other characters are barely developed. Everyone knows the story from the beginning and knows Catniss will prevail, so there's little drama, and her cohort is horribly miscast. Even the usually capable Lawrence doesn't quite seem how to play the role she has been cast in, and the result is a mishmash of action and internal angst that is poorly portrayed.

The script is terrible, the story has been stripped of human interest, and the allegory is unbelievable. Despite all the hype, this is not a worthwhile movie.",1359072000,6,1085,5.089887640449438

4946322,3,B0063FQREO,"I rented this on Amazon Video on Demand. Watched young Katniss get picked and travel to the great city, I was watching this with my wife who had really wanted to see the movie. A few minutes into the competition part of the story we stopped the video and my wife left the room. She couldn't get into the kids killing other kids angle or stand to watch it for very long while the initial heavy losses happened. I think its pretty important to know that upfront if you don't know what the movie is about, its like a survivor style reality show with teenagers killing each other in a battle only one of them can win.

I finished the movie by myself having seen hundreds of variations on fhe most dangerous game cliche and the Arnold Running Man movie back in the 80s, people killing each other on reality TV wasn't enough to make me quit the movie. There is a not very well hidden class warfare story going on: its in the setting, its in the theme, and sets the stage for this girl's coming of age story.

Towards the end of the movie, the level of technology required to make the games work became so obviously like magic that the idea the rulers needed people to grow their food or do anything for them was pretty ridiculous. But its not a scifi story, so don't look too hard at the technology. I don't know if that particular angle was even in the book.",1358985600,,1353,4.28125

Lots of ups and downs, and lots of great acting, but the tone is off for the first half. What I really wanted to see was a revolution. You root for Katniss, but you don't root for the movie. I didn't like the dramatic device borrowed from the ""Truman Show,"" where the Games people are controlling almost everything. The dramatic question is not will she make it, but will they let her make it. And that makes it less dramatic. All in all, an interesting movie but not a satisfying story. (""The Truman Show"" is a much better movie.) The whole Hunger Games thing almost feels like a con game, where the audience is being conned. In any work of art, I look for truth, insight into human nature, a comment on the human condition, and a knowledge of people and the world. None of that is happening here.

I thought the movie was quite good...I do wish they had added about 45min to it keeping it right under 3hrs so they could better develop things, but it still was a good flick for those who didn't read the book or really knew much about the movie....

The acting was top notch by all characters. The scenery was quite nice. The plot very interesting.

I very much enjoyed the flick & would give it 5 stars but im giving it 4 for a simple reason. Although the ending was just fine...to me, it left me feeling a bit hollow...I won't spoil it for anyone, but I just felt that when the movie ended, 'I wanted more'...& will leave it at that so as to not give anything away. I was expecting a different ending & could think of quite a few scenarios for the ending I would have enjoyed much more without leaving me with the slight 'I want more' feeling, but I digress & will simply say the ending was fine as it was & the movie itself was quite good.

Obviously there was a ton of hype surrounding this movie, so I couldn't wait to see it. I haven't read the book so my impressions relate solely to the book, and I found it wanting. There seems to be a lot of going on, but the timing was weird. The first half hour was at District 12, yet not a lot of revealed about the people there, the main character, the politics, how they got in the situation they were in, or anything that really mattered except how Catniss and Peeta ended up in the games. In contrast, many things that were pretty important are glossed over in a minute or two. Many things are eluded to, but not explained fully. I suppose the book fleshes them out, but it left me scratching my head and wondering why I should care.

The settings did a good job of contrasting the wealth and party atmosphere of the capital vs. the poor and miserable existence in the provinces, but it doesn't really say WHY it is this way. There is obviously some sort of cultural conflict and enforced submission, but WHY? How exactly? The few lines addressed to that doesn't help.

I thought the comic book feel of the fashion was an odd choice. It was like a blend between the 1980s, King Louis XIV France, Batman, and ancient Rome. I was confused. The poverty was real enough so why go off in a fantasy direction with the wealth?

As for the story, I guess there wasn't enough of it to make it great for me. I felt like I was given a skeleton. It was a fair skeleton, but not enough to make me want to watch more. It might have been more interesting if it had been more of a reflection of reality. The lottery scene in district 12 shows a wide range of people, but the ones who were selected all had some special talent. Where were the fat kids, the sickly kids, the ones with glasses?

I'm not asking for someone to explain it to me. I don't really care. I am just letting you know that if you haven't read the book, you may be as bewildered as I was. I didn't hate it. I just didn't have enough meat to give me a good flavor or desire for it.",1358640000,,2074,4.2272727272727275

4946362,5,B0063FQREO,I loved this movie and loved the books even more. You should read the books and then see the movie or the other way around. Either way they are keepers,1358467200,,151,4.066666666666666
4946363,5,B0063FQREO,"The books were great. The movie was great. Can't wait for the next movie.
It was great to see who played which characters from the book.",1358467200,,136,4.269230769230769
4946364,2,B0063FQREO,I was disappointed with this movie.  After all of the hype about it I found it to be a letdown and not very well done.,1358467200,,118,3.72
4946365,5,B0063FQREO,The Hunger Games is a great movie and an even better book. I am waiting anxiously for the next instalment of the trilogy.,1358380800,,121,4.304347826086956

4946368,5,B0063FQREO,It was what I bought. The blu-ray quality is much better than an original DVD. Worth the little bit of extra money.,1358380800,,115,4.2727272727272725
4946369,5,B0063FQREO,"Original story you'll love it. It's a perfect movie for todays society as the story rather stereotypes the rich from the poor.
Excellent story & original!",1358380800,,154,4.961538461538462
4946370,5,B0063FQREO,"I am a massive fan of The Hunger Games Trilogy and I have read all three books. I was very excited for the film to be released and went to the midnight premiere, not knowing what to expect. I had heard that the actors and actresses who had been chosen to play the main roles were excellent, so I had some faith. The movie was absolutely incredible. The special effects, the music, the talent of the actors and actresses; everything came together so beautifully.
 The score of the movie was absolutely breathtaking and added to the overwhelming emotion of the different scenes of the movie. Needless to say, I cried more than once upon my first time watching the film. It also added incredible suspense to the action-packed arena scenes in the movie. The musical aspect is one of my favorite features of this film.
 One negative aspect found in the movie is the fact that some of the details found in the book were not included.  For example: Katniss' conversations with the avoxes, Peeta losing his leg, Katniss receiving the Mockingjay Pin from Madge, and a few more. Although these details are not dire, they do continue on into the second and third books, which may be confusing to some.
 Sometimes film adaptations of books can be confusing to those who have not read the book. I think that the concept of the book was explained enough in the very beginning of the movie in The Hunger Games to where others could understand the movie.
 The Hunger Games is a phenomenal movie and is definitely worth your time. I ended up seeing it multiple times in theaters and now own it on DVD.",1358294400,,1584,4.563380281690141
4946371,5,B0063FQREO,I bought this CD for my family to enjoy this Christmas.  It also came with a digital copy. It is a great movie that follows the book pretty close.  Thumbs up for the movie and the transaction,1358294400,,191,4.135135135135135
4946372,5,B0063FQREO,"I like that the package came as fast of it could. I choose 3-5 day shipping and it came in 3 days, it took the minimum amount of time.  The CD came in good conduction there are no starches and it works great",1358294400,,207,3.813953488372093
4946373,3,B0063FQREO,I did rate it 4 star then I changed it to 3.  The reason being is that it is so dark.  I had to change my tv settings to make the color vivid.  Otherwise I like the book and enjoyed the movie even though the movie did all match up with the book.  But what do you expect most movies are like that.,1358294400,,296,3.6507936507936507
4946374,3,B0063FQREO,"I liked this movie better when it was called Battle Royal. From the plot, to the twists and turns, this movie is identical in every way to the film Battle Royal. It's an interesting concept, but it has been done over and over.",1358294400,,226,4.27906976744186

4946377,3,B0063FQREO,"After obsessively reading the book one weekend I NEEDED to see the movie. I don't know why I was surprised when the movie fell short, as is often the case with book to screen interpretations. The streaming was a little rocky, pixeling out during fast action sequences. BUT, it was available for instant play and at 10 dollars cheaper than buying it via itune/appleTV, so I appreciate the instant gratification none the less, let alone a more appealing $$.",1358294400,,455,4.772151898734177

4946379,3,B0063FQREO,"I think if I hadn't read the books first I never would have after watching this disjointed and none too interesting rendition of what really is a good and one of a kind story.  It wasn't just the missing details that movies made from books usually run into, it is just plain not good.  Sorry guys, try harder next time.  The Hunger Games and Katniss deserves it.",1358294400,2,362,4.373134328358209
4946380,3,B0063FQREO,It is not that I didn't like the quality of the Movie but how can this be for young adults.  This movie is about children going out and killing children.  And in the wake of all the school shootings that has happen over the last couple of years I'm not so sure why this is so popular.  I wouldn't let my children see this movie.  I was quite sad to see!,1358208000,,353,3.9295774647887325
4946381,5,B0063FQREO,"By now everyone knows how popular this film has been. I would add that it is one of the modern films of its kind that I found very well done and with main characters who all gave strong performances. A very enjoyable, exciting movie, which I have watched more than 3-4 times!",1358208000,,275,4.3076923076923075
4946382,5,B0063FQREO,"Went to the theater to see it, decided that this would be a movie I would watch many times in the coming months, so I knew I would want to buy it. Then I upgraded my PC and added a Blu-Ray player to it, so then I knew which movie I wanted to see again in Blu-Ray and I was not disappointed.",1358208000,,290,3.693548387096774

4946386,3,B0063FQREO,The book was fantastic.  The movie was more action than plot.  But still a good movie.  Read the books-- they were fantastic.,1358208000,,125,4.590909090909091

4946393,5,B0063FQREO,"I thought this movie followed the book, for the most part.  Evenso, we're never going to get the detail in a movie as one does from a book.  The sequence of events were in line with the story, and it was great to see how all the characters were dressed out and portrayed, vice having to use one's imagination when reading the book.

Overall...great movie, and looking forward to the next one.",1358208000,,392,4.416666666666667

It arrived earlier than expected, in good packaging and in perfect condition.",1358208000,,177,4.67741935483871

4946396,5,B0063FQREO,"A movie cannot stay true to the book.  It would take too many hours to cover all the details found in the book, and nobody can sit and watch a movie that long!  The screenplay was as true to the book as it could be.  Well developed characters, well acted.  LOVED Hamish!",1358121600,,270,4.134615384615385

4946399,5,B0063FQREO,"Before seeing it theaters, I hadn't read the books or had any real expectations of greatness; I was pleasantly surprised by I saw. Now I've read the trilogy, and just re-watched the movie. The movie does a great job of following the first book, and I was overall happy with the few changes that were made. I would recommend this film for those who have read the book, as well as for those who haven't. Obviously, there is violence, so I wouldn't recommend showing this to young children. The story is great, the movie is well-done, and I'm really excited for the next to movies to come out!",1358121600,,590,4.472222222222222

4946402,5,B0063FQREO,"You really 'feel for' the characters as they go through their trials.

4946405,1,B0063FQREO,"The premise for this movie is disgusting, especially in light of recent tragedies in this country.  Why must good writers and good actors choose the ugliest and most violent themes for ""entertainment"" ?  Even though we all know evil exists in the world, must we focus the eyes of our precious youth on such ideas? I bought this for someone else, and I will not be giving it to her.  I will probably put it in the trash where it belongs...",1358121600,9,438,4.382716049382716
4946406,5,B0063FQREO,"I love this movie! Jennifer Lawrence was/is the perfect Katniss and this is so great for those who are fans of the books. I recommend this to people who are fans of YA fiction, action movies and dystopian fiction.",1358121600,,213,4.487179487179487
4946407,5,B0063FQREO,"I may be a tad biased because I read the books before viewing the film, but nonetheless the film did not disappoint.  Jennifer Lawrence is a rising star.",1358035200,,153,4.464285714285714
4946408,2,B0063FQREO,To me this film was a shameless rip off of Stephen King's The Long Walk which was written decades ago.  I am not a fan of the movie at all.,1358035200,2,139,3.6333333333333333

4946412,5,B0063FQREO,"I didn't read the Hunger Games books so I wasn't sure what to expect when I walked into the theater. There was a lot of hype surrounding this movie and I'm not usually one to play into that, but this one did pique my curiosity. I'm so glad that I took a chance on it. This is easily the best movie of 2012.",1358035200,,306,3.873015873015873
4946413,1,B0063FQREO,"Ok, I get it, people don't really care about good film making ultimately. And there is something that people responded to in this film, but I don't know what it could be.

I read all the books, and really enjoyed them. The books should translate to a film fairly well. They are practically written as a screenplay. But even saying that, I did not watch this film expecting a match to the book, or even a perfect matching of the characters. I was ready to just see a good film, regardless of how true to the book they were.

This is not even worthy of being called a film. It is some kind of cheap presentation. Something you'd see at a tourist attraction in a crappy little theater where someone shook the seats and sprayed mist in the air under the premise you were watching a ""Senseorama"" demonstration.

Horrible screenwriting, horrible acting, horrible casting, non-existant cinematography, editing that feels like the result of some kind of computer algorithm that just mixes up shots randomly to music and dialogue, and seriously low budget visual FX. At least those crappy Transformer films get the FX right.

There is no film making craft visible in this picture, it needs to be categorized as something else. It's not even on par with cheap and cheesy TV movie of the week style story telling. This is barely on par with most video game cut scenes.

If you have any respect or admiration for cinema craft, do not waste your time sitting through this abomination.",1358035200,14,1471,4.664092664092664

4946415,5,B0063FQREO,I love this movie for its social and political references and i feel that it is a good influence on the younger generation and their responsibility to maintain a respectful and courteous humanity. Having said that this was an instant digital download and I love  the fast service and high quality of digital movies that amazon offers.,1358035200,,334,4.859649122807017

4946421,4,B0063FQREO,We enjoyed the movie but weren't as impressed with it as to what we expected after all the media hype that preceeded the movie. It was a good movie though.,1357948800,,155,4.2

4946423,3,B0063FQREO,"I am not sure how I feel about this movie.  I like it and don't all at the same time.  If you have read the books and have an active imagination, I think you may be left wanting more from this movie- like me.  It was a good movie but they left out parts that I think may be important and the actual hunger games seemed to go by too fast.  It was almost like they weren't in the arena for very long at all...making it seem less intense than the book.  Also, I feel like they were too easy on Haymitch.  His character in the movie was much more muted than in the book (He seemed to be too functional of a drunk at the beginning....not falling over, no throwing up...)  Like I said, not a bad movie but definitely left me wanting a little more from the movie.",1357948800,2,756,4.0

4946434,4,B0063FQREO,"At first I had no desire to see this movie because the concept of kids killing kids bothered me.  I watched the movie, then all the behind the scenes extras and perhaps I desensitized myself to the concept.  I came away being able to see the movie as a very well done movie, liked the characters and especially the attraction between the main characters.  The director, Gary Ross, was a perfectionist in all he did and the results of that is a movie that most people should be able to appreciate and understand for what it is.  It is not condoning kids killing kids but rather quite the opposite.",1357776000,,596,4.440366972477064

4946444,2,B0063FQREO,I rented this because the movie created such a hype but I thought it was just a very average and predictable story. Not really worth the money. Jennifer Lawrence is good though..,1357689600,2,178,4.59375
4946445,1,B0063FQREO,I thought it was disturbing that people could find entertainment in something like this.  The story was sad.  In a world where we have violent school shootings and we find those things so terrible it is amazing to me that people could sit down and find enjoyment from children in the same age range brutally killing each other.  I also had a hard time with the enjoyment the people had while they watched the killings and how worked up they got over it.  Maybe I missed the point of the whole movie?  Maybe I was just distracted by the brutality and far fetched costumes.,1357689600,10,571,4.451923076923077

I was upset to see that not only did this movie NOT come in a combo pack, but the only way to own a digital copy was through Ultra Violet. After a while I decided I should just buy it and bear with Ultra violet since I already had been forced once to do Ultra Violet. So I bought it, and opened it up to register my Ultra Violet copy and found a happy surprise!

The code given for the digital copy said it would also work for iTunes. So I followed the instructions for an iTunes copy, and now I have it the way I prefer to have it! And I can watch it anywhere I want on my iPod WITHOUT the need for wifi.

Love the movie, I think it is a perfect movie adaption, and I am excited to see Catching Fire. The Director was smart in asking Susan Collins to help him. I love the Capitol, and each actor portrays their character so well.",1357689600,2,957,3.9025641025641025

4946460,3,B0063FQREO,"I wanted to really like this, I truly.. truly did, but I found myself underwhelmed for the most part. The movie was definitely heavy on the action, but really light on the story and the story is exactly what grabs you when you read the books. They definitely left too much out in terms of the relationship between the main characters. There's none of the connection that they share which really defines who they are as the story progresses. Every actor did an amazing job and I love that they picked Jennifer Lawrence for this role. She is stunning and hilarious in real life and I so want to see her do well. Josh Hutcherson was also an excellent choice and Liam Hemsworth fit the role of.. crap.. I can't remember his name. Anyway, literally every actor in this movie is superbly talented.

The cinematography was excellent, the soundtrack was perfect, and the action sequences had a way of making you lean forward in your chair while holding your breath. I just wish there was more, you know? I wanted to see more of a character development and to really see the book come alive on screen. That just didn't happen here. On the plus side, the movie goes so quick you could easily sit through the first two back to back and not notice time zipping by.",1357603200,,1252,4.491228070175438

Although the purose of the hunger games is brutal and evil, the violence is carefully presented; it is not unnecessarily gorey and is an integral part of the story line. The endng is well done and leaves one ""hungry"" to watch a sequel.  The herorine is inspiring.  I would definatey rate this 5 stars, but would rate it ""R"" and recommend it for adults and more mature teens only, due to the violent content.",1357603200,,507,4.478260869565218

4946467,4,B0063FQREO,"Simply put, The Hunger Games is a huge success - and not just at the box office. From the dark, dreary, dystopia of District 12 to the brilliantly shining, colorful, excited nature of the Capitol, The Hunger Games is a winner. Directed by Gary Ross, the film blends the two worlds seamlessly.

The film, which is based on the first book of The Hunger Games trilogy by Suzanne Collins, is set in a country called Panem. Using a clever propaganda film, the film indicates why every year, the citizens of the twelve districts offer up as tribute one boy and one girl to fight to the death in the Hunger Games.

It's a dark world, which is run by the Capitol. Through controlled fear, organized restrictions of resources, and the Games, the Capitol maintains its rule without disruption. Governed by President Snow (Donald Sutherland), Panem is very separated. Each district is isolated, alone, and unaware of the conditions in the other districts.

The hero, Katniss Everdeen (Jennifer Lawrence), lives in District 12. District 12 is straight out of Great Depression-era Middle America. Dark, dirty, and poor, District 12 is home to the mining ore operation for Panem. Katniss finds her solace in this world in the woods outside of the fences, where she hunts with Gale (Liam Hemsworth). We're never sure about the true nature of the Katniss and Gale's relationship, although their feelings for each other are visually suggested that they're probably stronger than simple friendship.

At the Reaping (the tribute selection event), which is overseen and emceed by Effie Trinket (Elizabeth Banks), Katiniss volunteers to save her sister Prim, who is originally picked. Acting as a volunteer is a first for the District - something the citizens of Panem don't overlook. Katniss' male counterpart and tribute is Peeta Mellark (Josh Hutcherson). It quickly becomes clear that everything that surrounds the Games is played up for the audience.

As Katniss and Peeta are shipped off to the Capitol, a former Games winner and mentor for the District 12 tributes, Haymitch Abernathy (Woody Harrelson), makes his first appearance. Haymitch initially comes off as a drunk, sarcastic, and relatively worthless mentor. As Katniss and Peeta prepare for the Games, Haymitch slowly warms to them and begins to offer nuggets of wisdom. Harrelson is a fun casting choice. He's the visual representation of blending District 12 grit with the Capitol style, and he offers an entertaining performance steeped with humor. As Team 12 works to appease the audience, Cinna (Lenny Kravitz), team stylist, rebelliously makes them visual protests to the Capitol. During the pre-interview sequence with the wonderful Games commentator Caesar (Stanley Tucci), Peeta drops the bombshell that he's been in love with Katniss since he was a child. Katniss and Peeta are now the star-crossed couple.

All of the plot building expertly amps the tension that leads to the moment when the heroes enter the Arena. It's here that the film hits its stride. Ross crafts a film in which children are violently slaughtered - which instills regret and discomfort in the audience. Witnessing the death of children is jarring and creates a very self-aware feeling in the audience. Just by sitting in the theater, we're just as much of the Panem audience and the experience of the Games.

Some critics have complained of the shaky cinematography (result of not using a Stedicam), but Ross strives to show the viewer the chaotic and jarring nature of the Games. Visually, The Hunger Games is stunning. There are certainly effects-heavy shots, but they never seem out of place or fake. The set pieces for and design of the Capitol are amazing. In contrasting the dirt and grime of District 12, the filmmakers make apparent the pure decadence.

Jennifer Lawrence plays Katniss with great resolve and restraint. Many of the moments during the Games are reflected in her eyes. The Games' stress, sadness, anger, and fear are all honestly apparent to the audience (real and cinematic). Hutcherson isn't as strong as Peeta but does win the audience over towards the end of the film. This isn't his fault because his role is greatly reduced from what it is in the novel. However, this is Katniss' story. She's the hero, but she's a reluctant and unwilling hero, who rises to the occasion when necessary. Smart, cunning, and aware of her situation, Katniss never takes risks that aren't needed.

The film is the same way. The book is darker and more violent but also slower. Ross smartly balances these slower scenes during the Games with moments that let Katniss think and react to the artificial world around her.

Overall, The Hunger Games is a fantastic film. While the first book doesn't as openly end with threads for an obvious sequel, the film very much does. With a date already set for the second film - Catching Fire in 2013 - these Games are just getting started.

Jennifer Lawrence was stunning as Katniss, managing to keep the audience's attention even when it was just her on screen. There's just something about her that's so...perfect. She held the entire movie on her shoulders and made it all the better for it. Josh Hutcherson was a very good Peeta. His internal debate on the morals of killing definetly shown through and resonated with me. The whole cast was amazing, but several shown through. Woody Harrelson was a great Haymitch, Willow Shields and Amandla Stenberg gave their respective roles of Prim and Rue a great deal of venerability. Isabelle Fuhrman was a viscous Clove and Stanley Tucci was the ultimate scene-stealer as the Game's announcer, Caesar Flickerman. The special effects were...lacking. Some of them, like the Capitol, were breathtaking. But others, like the flaming dresses, were simply too fake looking. I loved the way that the world-building happened. We saw three very different places, the Capitol, the arena, and District 12, and got a good feel for all of them. But my albsolute favorite part was that it kept the themes and essence of the book intact, and expanded on them. As we watch the violence, we aren't listening to epic music, or witty one-liners, or watching the main characters smiling after kills(well, except for some villains). No, we see screams and blood and knives and terror and fear. We, as an audience, realize that we are no better than the Capitol citizens eagerly awaiting bloodshed. And we wonder...what would we do if we were a tribute? The Hunger Games poses many questions and morals that are continued to be explored in the three sequels that will hit theaters in the next three years.

The worst thing about the Hunger Games was everything between the title and the closing credits. These are random ramblings that went through my head as I watched this epic movie.  This is a commentary meant to be read along whilst watching this god awful tragedy.

Hey this must be the American version of that cool Japanese flick about the kids forced to kill each other by their government in a death match.  Oh, the author of this book never heard of that book or the movie that was made based on the book or the sequel to the movie.  That's believable, anyway moving on.

The costume designers and makeup artists should be forced to play in a Hunger Games style death match.

I was beginning to think Donald Sutherland would take any role offered to him for a paycheck, now I know Donald Sutherland will take any role offered to him for a paycheck.

Could we watch the boy throwing bread to the pigs flashback one more time please!

Nothing tastier than tree bark arm cake!

I wonder who's going to win the Hunger Games?

Can I pay extra for the 24 hour internet feed?

""I'm not allowed to bet, but if I could I would bet that this movie sucks.""

The Hunger Games have started and the kids are killing each other just like in that Japanese movie that this is clearly not a ripoff of.

Iron Maiden's ""Run to the Hills"" is playing in my head.

The media's right, kids watching kids killing little kids has no impact on their psyche whatsoever.  How could it?

Not fair, fire!

RRRUUUNNN!!!!  You're being chased by bad acting!

How did Dolph Lundgren's kid get in this movie?

I still don't know why this is called the Hunger Games.  I must have missed a major plot point.

Could you explain again about the bees and their deadly venom?  That was worst than product placement.

That's convenient, the one kid who dies has a bow.  It just so happens that I'm really good with a bow.

My boyfriend saved me, yeah!!!

I was a coal miner's daughter.

Could we have more flashbacks, the movie's not long enough already.

Are people always that loud when they sneak through the woods or is it just my surround sound system?

Why do I think every too cute black kid is the spawn of Will Smith?

Don't go near the luggage!  It's a trap!!!

Hey, I have an idea.  Let's leave the weakest, dumbest kid to guard all our crap.

I'm sure glad he killed Will Smith's kid so I don't have to.

Could we cry a little less and kill a little more?  This movie is already running way too long.

Now we have to pick flowers?  Come on!!! Kill something already!

Peace out to all my homies in District 12 beeeotch!

Send in the stormtroopers!!!  With HOSES!!!

Mel Brooks please make The Hunger Lames.

There can be only one!, or two if you're from the same district.

Look it's that scene where Rambo looks like mud, but he's a rock.  Cake decorating is cool and it's not just for girls!

This just turned into a Campbell's soup commercial.

Not the pig bread again.

We don't have time for dialogue Peter, we have a movie that needs to end...badly.

Girl Fight!

Enter angry black man ...... and Action!

I'll put on your goo if you put on my goo.

It's The Truman Show for the tween set.

Multiplying arrows are cool!  I can hear Limahl singing ""The Neverending Quiver...ahhhhahhhahhhahhahahahhh.""

And just add a little Minority Report and presto!  We have CGI animal thingy's chasing them!

I must break you!  And by you I mean Peter's neck.

Did I already ask Mel Brooks to please make The Hunger Lames?

No wonder our kids are stupid.

It's death by berries for you gay bearded man!

Just think about it Donald Sutherland, what if you died today?  Would you really want this to be your last movie?  Your legacy?

Gary Ross should be publicly flogged.

4946506,4,B0063FQREO,"Anytime you try to adapt a book into a movie, there is bound to be disappointment.  I miss some of the subtle nuances and differing explanations from the book, but this movie captures the heart of it very well.  Jennifer Lawrence is an excellent Katniss Everdeen and her acting blew me away.  You could feel her fear, pride, and see her thinking as Katniss.  The girl who plays Rue is charming and breaks your heart. Elizabeth Banks is unreconizable and brilliant, and Woody Harrelson as Haymitch is simply fantastic.

That said, one complaint about the movie is many of the actions scenes were filmed in that current, annoying Hollywood phase of shaky cam that directors seem to think makes it more realistic but basically just makes me woozy and unable to see the action.  When I watch action movies I want to witness the action not get seasick.  I think that this may have been done to show Katniss' disorientation as well as to provide some cushion to scenes of children killing children, but I found it disappointing and stupid, as I do in every movie that uses it.  I go to  movie to see the movie, not to be impressed that the director is so clever he can prevent me seeing the movie with crappy camera-work that is deemed ""artistic"".  Luckily, most of the movie does not employ this ridiculous effect, but it used it enough that instead of being a 5 star adaptation, it is merely 4 stars.

Other good points are how well they brought the characters to life and the scenes to life.  Especially vivid is the distinction between the squalor and depression of District 12 and the vivid opulence of the capital.  I love how they depicted the costuming, and most of the movie - the parts that were not shaky came - happened to be visually stunning.  I also enjoyed the use of the commentators of the games to explain various aspects of games - this exposition was entertaining and fun.  In the novel, so much is explained through Katniss' point of view, but the use of the commentators to explain about the environment and mutated species was a brilliant move.

The only other aspect that was unenjoyable was the conversations between President Snow and Seneca Crane.  These scenes added nothing to the movie, did not appear in the book, and were quite annoying in general.  Even my husband, who hadn't read the novels, questioned why these scenes were in the movie at all and felt that they detracted from it.  All we could come up with was that Donald Sutherland probably wouldn't bother doing a cameo in this movie even though his role in the later movies would be expanded, but that is merely speculation.  These scenes also took away from the movie overall - in the time they spent on these scenes they could have kept in more scenes from the book that actually happened.

Negative aspects aside, this is a movie I will watch over and over again and that I am happy to own.",1357344000,2,2880,4.56420233463035

review

 The Hunger Games by Suzanne Collins

This was an awesome book!!! Could not put it down! In fact I read it in one day. ""The Hunger Games"" is set in the future. Where as each an every year the Capitol holds a lottery system for all children once they hit twelve - eighteen to be entered into a death match. A boy and a girl are chosen from each of the twelve districts to compete. The only person standing is hailed the winner.

Katmiss never thought that her younger sister would have been chosen. She did the only thing to save her life by volunteering herself instead. Katmiss figures she had more of a chance in outsmarting the rest of her competitors than her sister would have.

Katmiss becomes close with her teammate Peete and gains an ally from
Rue a girl from district 11. Together they work together as a team and learned from one another to survive the games.

I can't wait to read the other two books in ""The Hunger Games"" series. Also looking forward to watching the movie based on the book.",1357344000,,1060,4.417525773195877

4946509,2,B0063FQREO,"I watched this on a free preview of EPIX, Im glad i didn't buy it, But then again i never wouldve bought it to begin with. I really only watched it because i liked Jennifer Lawrence in Winter's Bone and X-Men: First Class the film contains Horrible special effects(watch when Jennifer and Josh are lead on the platform with the audience cheering about 30 minutes in), RIDICULOUS hairstyles, i mean really, Did Stanley Tucci have to have blue hair? And what about Elizabeth Banks? Stupid. When the ""tributes"" are trying to attack Jennifer while shes in the tree, why weren't they worried about killing each other instead of her? Several other dumb moments like that. Woody Harrellson  and Donald Sutherland are in this but they basically have bit roles and don't really add anything. All in all this was 2 and a half hours of my life i wished i couldve spent better. Pretty boring, not worthy of the hype at all.",1357344000,3,911,4.6234567901234565

4946512,3,B0063FQREO,"Let me first start off by saying that the streaming service was excellent and would give it 5 stars. The rating and the rest of the review concern the movie itself.

The Hunger Games is about a girl, Katniss, in an impoverished 19th century style community. Then when her sister is chosen to take part in the Hunger Games, Katniss volunteers to take her place. She is taken to the Capital City which is a futuristic city where the Hunger Games take place. The rest of the movie is about her survival in the games.

I have to admit that I was at first skeptical about this movie, but the sudden twist by changing the scenery from an impoverished luddite community to a futuristic and eccentric society sold me on it. Overall the movie wasn't anything truly special to me, but it was still a movie I enjoyed watching. I don't have any intention of watching it again, but if you haven't seen this yet and nothing better to do, then I recommend at least trying this movie.",1357257600,,968,4.432584269662922

Being a male I didn't identify with Katness, but being the father of two beautiful daughters, I felt a great deal of protectiveness and desire to give support to her and all the characters,  The theme is this is what we and our children/grandchildren have to look forward to if we don't resist the current slide down the sippery slope of liberalism.",1357257600,,651,4.794642857142857

4946535,5,B0063FQREO,"So over the weekend I went and saw The Hunger Games. I personally thought it was a good film adaptation because a book that turns into a film always has its flaws.  Now, I'm not going to write about what the film is about because it is originally a book and that's Emily's job. What I will be talking about is how the film was as an adaptation and as its own film.

First of all I really loved the book and if you haven't read it by now, you seriously need to go to a book store and buy it! The film had all the major characters that the book introduces so that's a thumbs up. Katniss (Jennifer Lawrence) was just as I imagined her to be. Peeta ( Josh Hutcherson) was superb! What I really loved about the film is that there were scenes of Seneca Crane (the gamemaker) and President Snow that were not in the book but I thought that the scenes were very helpful to make the audience understand because the book barley talks about Seneca Crane and President Snow really isn't in it.  Overall, I really loved the film as a book adaptation.

Now, as its own movie? I felt that even if someone went to the movie theater to watch it without  even knowing what the book was about they would fall in love and get hooked on The Hunger Games. The film does an excellent job to explain just exactly what The Hunger Games is all about and the acting was pretty awesome. The only thing that I was not a big fan of was how the camera got really shaky during intense moments. This just gave me a headache and made everything feel awkward because I was trying to figure out just what was happening whenever the camera got shaky.  I don't want to give anything away for those of you who have not seen it but the scene that really bothered me was when the games first began. Everything had gotten so shaky that I did not even know what was going on until the end of the scene. That was the only problem that I had wit the film but overall I really enjoyed it and I'm sure that you will too!",1357171200,,1973,4.138381201044386
4946536,4,B0063FQREO,It was a very good movie to see we saw it in the theater at least two times and cant wate to see it at home,1357171200,,107,3.1538461538461537
4946537,5,B0063FQREO,"The Hunger Games was a compelling book, and this film is a very good representation of that.

The primary changes I observed were a switch from first to third person perspective and a compression of the Games.  The viewpoint switch deprived the audience of Katniss's inner thoughts, but had the substantial advantage of allowing direct observation to the Game Masters which Katniss wouldn't be able to observe, as well as to other scenes both in the capital and elsewhere on which the book couldn't report.  Especially for film, which is inherently more visual, this was a strong change.

On the compression side, these changes were all well chosen, and had the book followed a chronology closer to the film, I think little would have been lost.

In contrast I am reminded here of Running Man by Stephen King/Richard Bachmann.  There, the ""event"" was an extended, real-world chase.  When Arnold Schwarzenegger starred in the film, the game was brought into a compact arena and substantially compressed.  For the film, that worked much better, although it was a very different thing then what King had written.  In this case the film adheres closely to the book's events except that events are somewhat simplified and the time span tightened.

The characters as described in the book are well represented in the film.  The acting was in general excellent.

But perhaps the best thing about the film was how the glitzy production of the Games was brought to life.  This goes to multiple levels, from the brilliant interpretation of television host Ceasar Flickerman to the views of the game-masters at their control panel.  The naked horror of adolescents being sent to violent death is glossed over as entertainment.  The appalling odds of the Games where only one survivor is allowed represented as a fair competition.  This is reinforced by a conversation between the Game Master and the President: ""hope is more powerful than fear"" in controlling an oppressed people.  Strong stuff, and an example of a something enabled by the perspective change to third person.

The slick production of the Games could easily have taken over to the point where the audience is sucked into buying this as an acceptable entertainment, but this wasn't done.  Underlying the slickness is always the harsh reality that this is a tool of oppression, of forcing an imprisoned people to have their children butcher each other.  People are capable of supporting enormous cruelty, and that is as true of contemporary movie audiences as it is of citizens of the Panem capital.  Yet the audience of the film isn't allowed to go there.

As with almost all films made from books I enjoy, I thought it was a bit rushed and could have been longer.  But I was very pleased the action preceding the Games wasn't cheated: the book is in three parts, the first of the three before the Games and, sure enough, this was around 1/3 of the film's duration.  I had feared the film would have bypassed this portion to get straight to the action.  For example, Lord of the Rings focused heavily on the fighting, disproportionate to the books.  Here the film focused on the more important aspect.  Indeed, given the brutal theme of the fight-to-the-death games, the book substantially limited the explicit violence, and the film honored that choice.

So if you liked the book, the film is a must-see.  If you liked the movie, you owe it to yourself to read the book.

I gave the book 4-stars, as I thought aspects of the story seemed strained, but I think this film did an excellent job of working with the book, using good judgement in where to make changes, yet remaining remarkably loyal to the original work. I wouldn't necessarily rank this, on its own, as one of the all-time film greats, but as a representation of an important but imperfect literary work, it is remarkable.",1357171200,,3841,4.837672281776417
4946538,5,B0063FQREO,I read all three books and was very happy with the 1st movie.  they did a good job following the book.  the book was much more graphic/violent so they toned that down on the screen (I suppose to keep it pg-13).  Can't wait for the 2nd movie to come out.,1357171200,,253,4.02

4946543,5,B0063FQREO,"Anyone who views ""The Hunger Games"" as a teen movie comparable to Twilght deserves some sort of reality check. IMO, ""The Hunger Games"" is anything BUT a teen movie, and it's funny how that is the target market. There is little love story like in Twilight, and the movie contains so much symbolism and deep-thinking that kids and teens cannot fully understand and see.

The districts, living in what we would call a ""third world country"" being controlled by a capitalistic, ""first world country"" is something we see today to a lesser extent. The control of mass media and technology is also a main focus of the film. Sociology of how society is brainwashed by the government into thinking killing kids is the ""norm"" is not a big deal, hence why most of the tributes are ""ready to fight"" during their interviews. Also successfully pokes fun at the ridiculousness of reality TV. There is just so much more, but when you look at the film as more of a teen flick, this film is truly a masterpiece. Great acting by the lead role of Katniss, nice pacing, and even successfully follows the book IMO. Definitely a must-see.
Oh, and definitely not a girl's movie like Twilight.",1357084800,,1167,4.665048543689321

4946555,1,B0063FQREO,"""The Hunger Games"" could be the most pathetic, ridiculous, laughable cinematic effort I've ever seen.
In fact, if the reek from this crap could be put into a canister, I believe it would qualify as a Weapon of Mass Destruction.
As a rule, I'm a sucker for futuristic, post-apocalyptic films.  And therefore am predisposed to forgive many a flaw in them.
But, I'm sorry.  Can't do that with ""The Hunger Games.""
I guess I should admit that I never read the book.  So, perhaps the thing about the film that most irritated me was filmed as originally written.  In any case, though, the makers of this film lost me at once when they opted to portray the elites, the ruling class, as cartoonish human manifestations of bad taste.  All of them looked Bozo-The-Clownish as seen on an acid trip.  And their preferred decor was just as bad.  All of which had the effect of making me want to avert my eyes from the screen.  Or laugh.  Derisively.  But take them seriously as the future's upper crust?  Even in a movie?  Couldn't do it; not for a second.
And the action scenes... never have I seen such filmed more ineffectively.  And annoyingly.  All were filmed in such tight close-up that all one could make out was a dizziness-inducing blur of body parts in motion.
And I found the plot to be as disappointing as all of the above, as well.
So... to those who actually liked this film, I have to ask:  Why?
I'd also like to say to Stanley Tucci, Woody Harrelson,  Jennifer Lawrence and Donald Sutherland:  You should be ashamed of yourselves for appearing in such a turkey.  I guess, though, the paychecks were nice.  Because there couldn't possibly be another reason for being in a hooter like ""The Hunger Games.""",1357084800,2,1705,4.586092715231788

Overlong, pretentious, and emotionally void, 'The Hunger Games' is set in a far-off future in the nation of Pandem, which is divided into twelve districts. Every year, a pair of young people - one male, one female - are chosen by lottery, one pair per district, to participate in the Hunger Games, where they are all dumped onto a private reserve and forced to fight each other to the death - the winner determined only by the last person left alive, while everything is recorded and shown around the nation for all to see. Katniss Everdeen (a fairly wooden Jennifer Lawrence) volunteers to go this year, in the place of her much-younger sister, and her male counterpart Peeta (Josh Hutcherson) - seemingly more brawn than brains - joins her in the forced games of death ... which, ultimately in this film, aren't all that exciting or even involving (with a few exceptions) when you don't really give a hang about the main characters. Kat and Peeta, for me, had ZERO chemistry together on-screen, and the entire film in fact comes across with an air of sterility and coldness that keeps you from getting emotionally attached to anyone or anything. And its nothing like 'Battle Royale' unless you remade it, TOTALLY Americanized it, and THEN molded the entire thing for the atypical 'Twilight' fan.

4946568,5,B0063FQREO,"""And may the odds be ever in your favor.""

With such a big following and a lot of hype, The Hunger Games film was one of the most highly anticipated in 2012. The film lives up to the hype. It is clear that those responsible for producing and making the film come to life wanted to keep the spirit of the book intact, and they accomplish this. With The Hunger Games author Suzanne Collins as one of the screen play writers and director Gary Ross as producer, they are able to keep the novel's vision of a disturbing and backwards society. The film works so well because it demonstrates what an Orwellian, futuristic, dystopian world would look like amid these mindless traditions like the Hunger Games, run by corrupted higher ups. It's a society and world where one must always look over their shoulder; no one is safe. The Games, projected onto society by the means of media and overblown television coverage, create a norm of desensitization to violence. Much like the book was a commentary and criticism of overblown reality television and sensationalism of media, the film follows a similar route, showing the brutality of war, a fight to the death with children as its main celebrities.

The film was also terrific from the standpoint of character casting. Jennifer Lawrence really steals the show, and is a perfect fit for Katniss Everdeen. She captures Katniss' personality so well. She is stuck between concern for family and friends close to her in District 12 and being forced to survive the Games. She's presented as a sympathetic character who is emotionally drained from the reality of war, but tries to stay mentally strong. I also thought that Josh Hutcherson did an exceptional job as Peeta.

The subtleties and other nuances are also presented effectively in the film. The build up and circus-like atmosphere leading up to the Games are handled perfectly. The mockingjay is introduced as a symbol that will comes into prominence later. There is a perfect blend of foreboding and surrealism both before and during the Games. Clearly, attention to detail was a high priority.

Over all, this is a fine adaptation to The Hunger Games, and hopefully Catching Fire will be as good. The quality of the DVD is also superb. Extras in the two discs include a ""Making The Hunger Games"" documentary as well as conversation with director Gary Ross.

Definitely recommended for anyone who loves the book, or is a fan of dystopian-based films.",1356912000,,2446,4.842105263157895
4946569,5,B0063FQREO,"The movie is obviously worth the investment, as better reviewers than I have proclaimed.

4946570,4,B0063FQREO,"After reading all three of the books the film was less than stellar.  It was entertaining but the script could have been beefed up and the characters developed better.  I wanted to see a better difference between ""Capital Have It Alls"" and ""Dearth in the District"" lifestyle.  Also, the most important element to me was the political, progressive ramifications the book has and that was not developed at all to my satisfaction.  The gladiator gore was definitely there (not too gory, the director spared us, thank you) but the reason why they had spiraled down into this type of deplorable entertainment was not as obvious as I would have liked it.

4946577,5,B0063FQREO,"While the craze to develop movies from popular books continues, it's not all a ridiculous conglomeration of messed up storylines.  Some screen-writers and directors actually care about whether or not their movies reflect the integrity of the titles they're stealing.  ""The Hunger Games"" is no exception. Director Gary Ross, who was also one of the writers for the screenplay adaptation, brought author Suzanne Collins in as one of the script writers to ensure that the movie retained the essence of the popular series.  This has to be one of the best moves ever made.  Yes, there are some minor diversions and differences, but overall, the movie is the storyline almost exactly.  With brilliant casting choices - using talent rather than big names in most cases - the Hunger Games movie tells the heart-wrenching story of Katniss Everdeen and Peeta Mellark two of the twenty-four children who are forced to play a role in the most evil invention since the holocaust: Panem's hunger games.  A sadistic pageant, the hunger games forces children to fight to the death to remind the country that it should never rise up in rebellion again.  Jennifer Lawrence, Josh Hutcherson, Stanley Tucci, Woody Harrelson, and Liam Hemsworth are just a few of the fantastic cast that make this movie well-worth watching.  If you haven't read the book, go do so now.  Then go watch the movie.  It really is a great adaptation.  This movie is proof that filmmakers are finally beginning to take books seriously, understanding that they are popular for a reason, and deserve to be turned into quality movies.",1356912000,,1587,4.973484848484849

The story is based on the premise that each year two children are selected by lot from each of twelve districts, and then they fight to the death for the entertainment of the ruling class.

4946601,4,B0063FQREO,"I understand that there was a civil war and that the rebellious districts lost. I understand that to the victor go the spoils. I don't understand how the hunger games do anything whatsoever to benefit the victor. Tribute in the form of forced labor or forfeited wealth I can understand. Tribute in the form of kids killing each other doesn't seem like smart resource management. Subjugating and oppressing the rebels is one thing. Pissing them off by making their kids kill each other seems like a certain recipe for further rebellion. Intimidate the districts by giving them a spark of hope because ""hope is stronger than fear""? Does that make even the slightest bit of sense?

Even assuming the districts put up with this nonsense, what's with the lottery? Why wouldn't there always be a volunteer? Has the world changed so much that districts don't have goth kids who want to die or jocks who want to prove their manhood? If victory is the ticket out of a life of assured misery, I'd expected dozens of kids to volunteer for the games.

With such a preposterous premise, why am I giving The Hunger Games four stars? Because, premise aside, it's a riveting movie. In the end, I was willing to forgive the premise because there's so much here to like.

I loved the editing. The quick jumps from scene to scene give the film energy, even early in the movie when nothing much is happening. The camera's brief focus on held hands and grim faces tell the viewer more about the people of District 12 than an hour of dialog would manage, and in a more meaningful way. During action scenes, close-ups are used effectively to heighten tension. It's just a pleasure to watch, and get lost in, the action.

I loved the performances. Jennifer Lawrence sold me. Woody Harrelson sold me. Josh Hutcherson convinced me that he's not just a pretty face.

I loved Stanley Tucci's hair.

I even liked the writing. It's subtle when it needs to be. It isn't cheesy. I love the way the movie conveys emotions without using words.

The whole rule change shtick is a little ridiculous -- our favorite characters didn't see the second change coming? They're smarter than that. The game managers' ability to create beasts out of -- what? -- is senseless. Again, I'm willing to forgive the silliness because I enjoyed the movie so much.

So it's pretty obvious that ""the Hunger Games"" is not exactly original.  But that doesn't mean it's plagiarism and it certainly doesn't mean it's not a good story.  Let's face it, human beings have been coming up with stories for thousands of years...I suspect there are very few truly original ones left to be discovered.

And sometimes, a derivative work can be ""creation"" because it synthesizes old things in a new and satisfying way.  That's what ""the Hunger Games"" does.  It's just a good story with:

-Jennifer Lawrence doing well as Katniss, the melancholy but brave heroine
-a good turn by Stanley Tucci as the smarmy ""talk show host"" in the story
-some excellent action sequences and special effects
-a very interesting rendition of ""the Capitol"" and its garishly attired and styled inhabitants
-Woody Harrelson playing an interesting winner of the games who helps Katniss (proving that while Harrelson is a lunatic, he can act)
-a poignant and believable conclusion

The story does have some holes in the plot...

<spoilers>

1.  I find myself wondering whether the professional tributes would form the alliances that they did in the story.  Given the fact that there can only be one winner, I think in real life people would be afraid to turn their backs on each other.

2.  The story sort of came to an abrupt end ""forced"" more or less by the introduction of the CGI dogs.  I just didn't think they belonged in the story or looked too convincing.

(Having read the books, I know now that mutant critters were a principal weapon of the Capitol but I think they need to improve these creations for the future movies).

3.  I had a sort of similar reaction to the landmines.  Given that the tributes weren't allowed to have firearms, it was kind of odd that they had anti-personnel mines, and I thought the idea that Katniss would be able to detonate them by shooting open a bag of fruit was a bit contrived.

4.  The way the Hunger Games ran did not make much sense as an event a lot of people would take interest in.

-It would seem like that having kids as young as 12 competing against those 18 years old would be kind of stupid.  If you had a smaller age range, the tributes would be more evenly matched and that would make better ""entertainment.""

-I couldn't see people tuning into watching more than a ""highlights"" reel of the Hunger Games, given the fact that a huge amount of what took place in the forest would hardly be cinematic.  I think watching it would be akin to watching all of the OJ Simpson murder trial in terms of being excruciatingly boring.

5.  The scene early in the games where Katniss got ""treed"" by the career trackers (and Peeta) showed the career trackers with the bow and arrows came awfully close to hitting her twice, and then they just gave up?  Why wouldn't they have kept on shooting at her (in the book, that problem was taken care of with making the careers hopeless with the bow).

6.  Josh Hutcherson does a good job playing Peeta, but I think they should not have him shown in the future movies with his hair combed back because he looked so different (at least to me) that I was confused at first if this was a different character.

<spoilers end>

But all of these plot holes don't sink ""the Hunger Games.""  It's a good solid piece of entertainment that has more heart and soul than most action flicks, and I figure when the next installment rolls out next November, I'll go see it.",1356739200,,6403,6.032115171650055

They seemed to be targeting a younger audience than I thought would be appropriate. I feel that they amazing with the movie. Althought it is a very serious subject, they downgraded the violence some for the movie. The movie gives a message of hope. In a place where the governement controls everything and tears everything away from so many people, this young girl, Katniss, refuses to give in. She brings hope to bad circumstances and goes on to change things for everyone. It is a reflection of so much past and present in this world. Great movie.

4946639,4,B0063FQREO,"The movie by itself, without the book being thought of, is great, but watching the movie after reading the book makes the movie less great. Most of what is happening in the book is Katniss's thoughts, which is difficult to portray without having her mumble to herself (and that would have ruined the movie). I felt like the Rue and Katniss relationship was underdeveloped in the movie, so when Katniss started crying after Rue died, I thought that it would be difficult for people who hadn't read the book to understand why Katniss was so upset. Also, when they would cut to the parts where Caesar and Claudius were explaining what was going on (i.e. the tracker jackers), I knew that this was the movie maker's way of explaining to the people who hadn't read the book, not really the people of the capitol, which took away from the movie. The movie also felt a bit rushed, especially at the end.
Still, I think that they did the best they could, and they really did do a good job with the movie. It's not a five-star movie (because of the faults explained above), but it is a strong four-star. I really think that the effects and visuals helped the movie a lot because, visually, the movie was amazing; I LOVE how they portrayed the capitol and really showed the bizarreness of it.",1356652800,5,1282,4.530172413793103

4946647,3,B0063FQREO,"Having read the trilogy (at the urging of a coworker) I knew this wasn't ""great literature"" going in. However, I thought the movie did a pretty good job interpreting the story line. The premise is pretty disturbing (spoiler alert): Teens and pre-teens forced to kill one another in order for their families to survive, while the citizens of the ""Capital"" enjoy an extravagant life style. While analogies are made by the book's author about children surviving war and brutality, I feel it was never made clear in either the books or the movie. It's a tough subject matter, especially the slaughter of the innocents at the beginning of the games themselves, and then with Rue, the young girl that reminds Katniss of her sister Primrose. I'm not sure I would take a pre-teen to see this movie. Overall acting quality was good: I thought young actress Jennifer Lawrence's portrayal of Katniss never sank into maudlin or simple sympathy-seeking. She and the other teens (possibly early 20-somethings) did a bang-up job. I can't quite say the same for some of the other stereotypical casting choices: how many times are we going to see Donald Sutherland as the moustache-twirling villain or Woody Harrelson as a stoned-out (alcohol besotted in this case) loser? Really? Overall, even knowing the story line, I still found myself moved during the film... so I guess it was a success... although a slightly hollow one. Can't quite put my finger on what the books and the movie are missing. Is it a teen story or is it hard-boiled science fiction/fantasy? Neither in my opinion.",1356652800,,1569,4.902255639097745

There are definite parallels to the United States, the power of the Government, and the ridiculous entertainment mindset of most Americans. The violence isn't really gratuitous, and fits with the overall theme of the book. However, the subject matter contained in the book, but especially in the movie, is WAY too mature for most kids (even though that's who it's being marketed to). The violence and killing itself tends to become ""glorified"" in the movie setting, making the violence more palatable to younger viewers. But, even though the book and movie are about kids, it should not be considered appropriate for kids under the age of 16, since the emotional maturity to process the concept of ""putting yourself in the hero's shoes"" is very much problematic for the concrete thinking of kids younger than high school.",1356566400,,955,4.937888198757764

4946668,4,B0063FQREO,"May be a bit intense for young kids because of violence, but overall a good action/suspense story.  Wish I had read the book as well.",1356566400,,133,4.32
4946669,5,B0063FQREO,Great movie.  Copy clear on my iPad.  Fast and easy with the instant download.  Great deal free with the purchase of it on blu ray,1356566400,,130,4.12
4946670,5,B0063FQREO,Love the movie only wished the copy I ordered from Amazon had been viewable. Had to return it :-( 5 stars are for the movie,1356566400,,123,3.96
4946671,5,B0063FQREO,The movie followed the book pretty closely which I always like. I'm looking forward to the next one comes out!,1356566400,,110,4.55
4946672,3,B0063FQREO,"Not as good as the book.  I expected a lot more from this movie, but I probably shouldn't have because the book itself wasn't all that great. I still find it a lot easier to stomach than Twilight, which is probably what everyone says...",1356566400,,236,4.363636363636363
4946673,5,B0063FQREO,I ordered this movie in HD and we watched it on my daughters new smart TV and it was like sitting in the movie theater.  The picture and sound were superb.  Great movie to watch with your young adult child.  Very entertaining.,1356566400,,226,4.333333333333333

4946675,5,B0063FQREO,A very rare instance where a movie takes a book I loved and doesn't ruin it. After watching the movie I watched the entire special features disc (also very well made and worth watching if you are a fan of cinema and how these massive projects come together and are made) and realized that the director and producers all loved the story too. But most importantly the author was involved in every step of the process including co-writing the script. I think as the years go by and we look at this trilogy in retrospect it will come to be regarded as an insightful masterpiece and not just a young adult epic.,1356566400,,606,4.419642857142857
4946676,5,B0063FQREO,This was a Christmas present to my wife. This is one of our favorite movies. We loved the books and we can't wait for the next two movies to come out. I love the fact this comes with a digital copy. This will for sure be on my tablet.,1356566400,,234,3.795918367346939
4946677,4,B0063FQREO,Enjoyed reading the book.  Wanted to keep up with what the younger set is reading.  Like to be able to discuss books with the grandkids.,1356566400,,136,4.4
4946678,4,B0063FQREO,Interesting and unique characters.  Action keeps you on the edge of your seat. Plot was not predictable and so it kept you guessing as to what was coming next.,1356566400,,159,4.482758620689655

4946681,4,B0063FQREO,"Having read the book series, I was interested to see how the movie would play out. I have to say it was pretty close and the movie characters were lose to how the book describes them. Great movie for young teenagers.",1356566400,,216,4.2926829268292686
4946682,5,B0063FQREO,"I've read all three books in the series, and this movie makes me look forward to the next one. The movie clarifies a part of the first book my son and daughter and I found confusing. Of course, no adaptation of even a relatively simple novel can contain all the elements or sub-plots of the book. But this movie prevents you from asking ""Why did they leave out...?""",1356566400,,365,4.382352941176471

4946685,5,B0063FQREO,I saw the movie in theaters and got blown away by the story. A strong female character who fights to preserve her humanity in an inhuman contest of survival.  Seeing it again reaffirmed everything I loved about the movie. Big ups to the Jennifer Lawrence for portraying a strong female lead who is not to show her vulnerability when it counts. The other casts members helped to add gravitas and depth to movie and kept me engaged from beginning to end. I look forward to the sequel.,1356566400,,482,4.540229885057471

4946687,5,B0063FQREO,I absolutely love this movie! It is now one of my favorites and it has a great story line. I am now going to read the books to find out what happens because I don't want to wait for another movie to come out.,1356480000,,208,3.75
4946688,4,B0063FQREO,"I'll admit, I only read half of the book.  But, it seemed fairly accurate to the book, although the story seemed somewhat rushed especially at the beginning.  The movie also retained much of the simplistic nature of the book.  The acting was decent, and the scenario was pretty gorgeous.  Personally, I think the ending leaves a little to be desired, but overall its an entertaining use of time.",1356480000,,395,4.764705882352941

The movie is about 95% jerky camera pans on faux-desperate faces, caked with makeup.  Completely typical of contemporary American trash movies.  There is no great moral story to be found here.  Oh wait, a story of hope?  That's not worth the excruciating take after take of ""Lost"" style footage.",1356480000,,390,4.7611940298507465

4946692,4,B0063FQREO,Bought it for my daughter who requested it for Christmas. It was priced well and arrived quickly. She was thrilled. I love the movie too and feel it is a good criticism on the violence in our society and how we it's 'entertainment factor'. Definitely a lot to talk about with this movie.,1356480000,,287,4.433962264150943

4946700,3,B0063FQREO,"Like most movies, this doesn't hold a candle to the book. As a stand alone movie I think it's a pretty good action flick. Die hard fans of the book (like me!) will be disappointed by some of the changes & omissions in the story line. I don't think they did a very job of explaining some important elements of the history & society or even the politics of the world the movie's based in. I found myself needing to expand on & explain a lot of things to my husband (who hasn't read the books) and he enjoyed the movie more after understanding the backstory & the world a little better. The cinematography does a fantastic job of conveying the characters emotions & disorientation, but I think the movie fails to grab you emotionally. I didn't feel anything for the characters like I did whilst reading the books.",1356480000,,810,4.442953020134228
4946701,4,B0063FQREO,"pretty faithful to the book; just a few incontinuities.  obviously they are planning a second movie because the end was just... the end of the film, not the end of the story.  i'd say read the book first; it will help make the film make more sense.  The Hunger Games series, while I have criticisms, is one of the many good examples of young-adult literature out there these days.",1356480000,,380,4.478260869565218

4946707,4,B0063FQREO,I saw the movie in the theaters about 5 times and loved it.  although the story line is rather bloody I think the director was good at drawing the line so it wasn't too bad.  the only problem was that I couldn't down load it to my PC so I had to watch it on line.,1356480000,,263,3.6785714285714284
4946708,5,B0063FQREO,"I had watched this movie in theaters and loved it. Honestly I had never read the books before until recently and noticed that they didn't change it much. Jennifer Lawrence, Josh Hutcherson they deliver. They both give good performances.",1356480000,,236,5.076923076923077

4946711,1,B0063FQREO,"If I could give this movie fewer than one star, I would.  As if we haven't seen enough films showing adults killing each other, now we have to be subjected to teenagers killing each other.  This is pornography.  This is obscene.  From the first moment at the beginning of the game to the last, we see body after body of children murdered by other children...and, several times, we see children murdering other children.  No one is saved from this, even our hero who kills without thinking twice.  There is no merit to this film.  Parents, if you let your children see this film you should have them taken away from you.  Sure it is simulated killing by actors, but simulated sex by actors is considered porn, too, and you wouldn't want your children to see that, either.  No excuses.  No one should be proud of this movie.",1356480000,6,822,4.530612244897959

4946718,5,B0063FQREO,I saw this movie when it was first released.  At that point I had just read the entire trilogy and was disappointed by the changes made and the lack of depth.

4946726,4,B0063FQREO,"I think in order to understand and appreciate the movie, people should read the book first, just a suggestion.

I liked the movie, followed the book well. It felt a little rushed at times but I understand it's hard to fit a novel into a 2 hour movie.

In the book, it is told from Katniss's perspective. So maybe a little more dialogue from her mind would have been good to really become attached to her.

Overall, it was a good movie.",1356307200,4,435,4.280487804878049
4946727,2,B0063FQREO,"I'm not sure what the big fuss was about this movie.  It is a reasonable story, basically a remake of the 1975 film Rollerball but with a pretty teenager girl instead of the James Caan adult character.  It is refreshing to see an actress like Jennifer Lawrence get to a leading roll, shows that you don't have to sell raw sexuality to get to the screen.  I understand the series of books upon which this movie was based was excellent and it is always hard to transfer books to the screen, but what does get transferred seems to me to be a series of events without any real new or refreshing underlying theme.  The presentation of the hypocracy and moral decay of a potential future all-powerful state is a theme that has been pretty well worked over the years and would really need something new added to make it interesting.  The story also ends on a hanging note, intended solely I suspect to form the connection to the inevitable sequels that will come.  Do yourself a favor and read the books, skip this celluloid translation of the story.",1356307200,,1043,4.5212765957446805

4946730,4,B0063FQREO,"I don't know if anyone else has pointed this out since I have no intention of reading over a thousand reviews, but this story seems to be an exploration of the concept in game theory taken to a very disturbing level. That is probably the point however. If you want to drive a point like this  home you don't do it with fuzzy little bunnies & nerf balls. I found the film provoking & sad but I also recognized that the story is purposefully pushing a lot of buttons which will hopefully get the viewer to think & not just react to the button pushing.  Although many other movies have done the games to the death theme, this seems to be a bit different in that we're talking children here. Why? Probably because if these were adults, we'd just think of the decent into gladiatorial games. With children, it's just not so easy to create a framework to make this struggle into an acceptable  form. I hope this makes sense & I'll try to come back when it'snot so late.",1356220800,,963,4.338888888888889
4946731,3,B0063FQREO,"What can I say about a movie that glorifies ritual child sacrifice? It's horrible. As far as cinematography goes, it was okay. So, with the modern cinematographers' technique of the shakie-and-whirling-camera, The Hunger Games falls dramatically short of qualifiying as a movie worth wasting two hours of your life on. Drivvle and poppy-cock! SPOILER ALERT: They change the rules of the game at the end then change them back then change them back again when the kids were going to both commit suicide. I'll let you watch this piece of cinematographic programming to figure out which two characters live",1356220800,,602,5.090909090909091

4946734,3,B0063FQREO,"Pros: Entertaining and satisfies the urge for a exciting, action packed adventure.
Cons: Not sure if Blu-ray format is necessary for a film where all action sequences are blurred.

Another ""the most dangerous game"" type movie, this one targeted at a teen audience.  It reminds me of a TV show called Endurance.  Hunger games is action-filled and has many entertaining action scenes.  Jennifer Lawrence does an amazing job of portraying a strong, athletic, and emotional hero.  Josh Hutcherson also is excellent in portraying a complex character who is witty and fully aware of his surroundings.  There are several forks in the plot which do not connect, or do not connect well together, but one enjoys this movie for its action.

One gripe that I have with the film, is with the cinematography.

It is unfortunate that more and more action films in the last few years have adopted a new style when filming action sequences.  It involves shaking the camera profusely, causing disorientation, and all frames in an action sequence are blurred due to motion blur introduced by camera shake.

Shaking the camera, not to be confused with panning, is something that students are taught to avoid when they go to school.  Holding the camera steady as one pans, or moves about, is fundamental to filming.  Devices such as steadycam are readily available to help reduce camera shake.

A splash of camera shake here and there can be a fun and interesting style of filming to multiply the sense of a chase, for instance, but I am not of the opinion that this style is necessary on all action sequences in the entire movie.  It seems that in this movie, camera shake is added to all shots except for ones which require CG.",1356220800,,1708,4.784982935153583

4946736,2,B0063FQREO,"After my wife and I both read the book, we decided to give the movie a try. The books were great, and ""the movie never lives up to the book"" is an understatement in this case.

4946738,4,B0063FQREO,"I found this dystopian film somewhat derivative, but Jennifer Lawrence's acting was terrific. The story reminded me a lot of ""The Lottery,"" but with a lot more action.

Also commendable were a looming Woody Harrelson, a creepy Stanley Tucci, a barely recognizable Liz Banks, and the skin-crawling Tracker Jackers.

I haven't seen any of the ""Twilight"" series, but I'm betting THG is a smart alternative to that portrayal of millennial angst.",1356220800,,441,5.197183098591549
4946739,1,B0063FQREO,"This was a stupid movie.  There are smart movies and stupid movies, and this one was stupid.  Jennifer Lawrence's acting was good, but the story and script were not very interesting.  I felt like there was alot of mind control in this movie.",1356220800,,241,4.558139534883721
4946740,1,B0063FQREO,Found the whole premise of the movie really disturbing. Children being sacrificed for the amusement of the elite was not something that made any sense to me. I don't see how this qualifies as a great movie.,1356220800,4,206,4.594594594594595
4946741,3,B0063FQREO,Seems cheaply made. The soundtrack sucks. The books aren't written extremely well but are more interesting. I still think its worth watching.,1356220800,,141,5.454545454545454
4946742,5,B0063FQREO,"The Hunger Games is a greatly moving and tear shedding movie. It's basically highlighting that love and compassion can make you stick your neck out for someone ( in this case, Prim). I think that the changes in the movie, such as how the Cornucopia was a golden horn, but in the movie it was irregularly shaped and slate gray ,made a bit better to me (because I like when the movie is a little different than the book, to me it makes it more suspenseful), but left me wondering exactly whether it really was better or not. Perhaps those small changes are made to make it easier for the actors. The movie was GREAT and made me hope that humankind will never be as cruel, dictating and corrupted as in the Hunger Games.",1356134400,,717,4.358208955223881

4946744,5,B0063FQREO,"I bought the Bluray thinking (incorrectly) that the second disc was going to be regular DVD. Since it wasn't, I was in the market for a regular DVD copy to watch on my other players and my kids to watch in the car. This version didn't just come with the DVD and digital copy, but also came with an Amazon Instant Video copy as well. So, now we can watch it literally anywhere, on any of our devices. I bought it for 14.99 and even if it ends up getting cheaper as time goes on, I think that was a great deal - especially since it includes the Amazon Instant Video copy.",1356134400,,569,4.089285714285714
4946745,3,B0063FQREO,"I read the book before watching the movie.  I thought if followed the book pretty closely, but I wasn't thrilled with the book either.  I though it was very predictable.

4946747,2,B0063FQREO,"I read the Hunger Games in a day and it took me about three days to read Catching Fire. I'm planning to read Mockingjay to finish the trilogy. I didn't plan to see the movie, but decided to take a look. I thought the visual look of the film was well done. The casting was also well done. The only problem with the film was that the story was flat and seemed to just string together choice scenes from the book. Not much time was spent on character development. So it was hard for me to root for the characters. Maybe it is an editing problem because some scenes are too long or some scenes jump ahead that it seems something was missing in between. If people that saw the Hunger Games haven't read the book yet, I'd definitely recommend that they read the book to fill in the blanks.",1356134400,,783,4.226666666666667

4946752,5,B0063FQREO,"The Hunger games made me think of what is happening today in our nation as our so called Government demands more from The People such as give-backs and high taxes while they- the rich- take and Lord it over us.  The movie made me think that this could be our future if we don't stand up and demand back our Republic-Government of the people, by the people, for the people.",1356134400,,372,4.314285714285714

4946754,4,B0063FQREO,"This felt like Twilight to me. When I saw the Twilight movie, it was okay, but it made me want to read the book.
Hunger games was about the same. Well done, but lacking the depth that a book might deliver.

It may just be me, but it felt like the camera was bouncy. At the beginning of the movie the way everything moved felt fast and unnatural and made me a little dizzy. I tried adjusting settings on my tv, but I didn't notice a difference and I eventually adjusted to it.",1356134400,,475,4.10752688172043

4946757,3,B0063FQREO,"It was close to the book and was interesting. My husband, who didn't read the story, liked it. It did end totally different from what I was expecting and the action was goosed up for the film. Not exactly the story line, but close enough. Will probably watch the rest of the series.",1356048000,,282,4.339622641509434

4946759,5,B0063FQREO,"I was extremely impressed by the book to movie translation. The movie makers actually added in scenes that gave greater meaning to the story. A few changes bugged me, but overall, very impressive. Great cast who played their respective roles wonderfully! Can't wait for Catching Fire!",1356048000,,284,5.195652173913044
4946760,4,B0063FQREO,"I found this movie to be unpleasant all the way through. And so I must admit the story's effectiveness. Aside from ridiculous character names like Peeta and Katniss, I was mostly convinced of the nightmare world portrayed here. I don't take away any message of hope, courage, dignity, and humanity that the number one review suggests is evident in this film. No, there's not a frame of this movie that isn't either the darkest of jokes or utterly hopeless and sad. Nothing good can come of the story's premise. It makes me wonder why there's supposedly courage and dignity when adults play war games, because there certainly isn't any of that when children are forced to. Part of me is disgusted by the ideas portrayed here, and then I'm reminded that this extreme version of our world holds a deep, dark truth that truly scares me.",1356048000,,832,4.705479452054795
4946761,3,B0063FQREO,"Was intrigued by The Hunger Games descriptions, so I first read all three books. They were excellent, well written and they grabbed me and kept me turning pages. I really looked forward to the film, but it was so insipid and disappointing compared to the books. The opportunity for great visuals in this day of CGI, especially with costuming and sets, was totally wasted. Time constraints seem to have forced too many cuts to the story line, which looses important details.

As is generally true when translating books to images overall, the film did not have half the impact on me as the books. The underlying messages however, are still relevant and powerful, making it well worth watching.",1356048000,,692,4.864406779661017
4946762,5,B0063FQREO,I was very impressed by the acting and the director's outstanding choices for how to bring this book to life. It was outstanding and the added features: interviews and background were also very well done.,1356048000,2,204,4.857142857142857

It amazes me how people think this film is such a unique and cool movie when all the producers did is take a Japanese classic film and clean up the blood so they could release it to a mainstream audience.  It is really annoying that nowhere in the film do they give credit for Battle Royale and for stealing the concept entirely.  Sure they added some nice wrapper material and even got Walter White to help out but if you want to do yourself a big favor, buy the original Japanese film and you will enjoy it a lot more, I promise.",1355875200,2,614,4.222222222222222

In this case, they really did seem to try to retain as many of the details and facets from the book as possible.  The movie maintained the feel and purpose of the book.

The movie was entertaining, but somewhat slow at the beginning.  It was a little predictable in places (which I cannot adequately describe without spoiling the plot).  And, I guess I am going to have to read the books to figure out the meaning of the last scene in the movie.  I am not big on violence in Movies, and there was more than I normally like.

The movie managed to capture the essense of the book--the ""feel"" so to speak. Jen Lawrence was perfect as Katniss--totally nailed it. Woody Harrelson absolutely great as the mangy, cynical, secretly wise Haymitch. I wasn't too crazy about the kid who played Peeta--very bland and he's supposed to be better looking. They also changed around a few things that I thought would be fine left the same way as the book.

I guess noone reads any longer.  you can find this similar theme of an oppressive future in dozens of stories.  I recall one that was nearly exactly the same only it was countries that sent ""contestants"" to the battlefield instead of districts and there were 50 of them instead of 24.  This is virtually a carbon copy retelling of that story. However, it was a good cast and a decent re-thinking of the theme.  I was however, displeased that so much of the backstory was left untold.  For instance, 12 districts instead of fifty states?  The districts appear to be fairly small, hardly encompassing even a fraction of the mass of the United States and then we only see one city.",1355788800,,829,4.554054054054054

4946849,3,B0063FQREO,"The Hunger Games became enchantingly different than most widely read popular books. Suzanne Collins broke away from the populists Twilight books by Stephanie Meyer's series of four vampire-themed fantasy romance novels, with an enigmatic post apocalyptic land named Panemli that is divided into 12 districts surrounding the Capitol. The principal characters in the story line are teens attempting to come to terms with growing into adulthood, as in most western societies by most accounts. The initial focus district is number 12, which is depicted in similarity to southern Appalachia and its coal mines. Unlike Collins romanticizing the characters in the Twilight books, Collins takes a more pragmatic approach, creating a somewhat harsh reality of what it is like growing up in abject poverty in the coalfields of West Virginia and Kentucky. The characters are believable and emotionally grounded for the most part. The central character is a 16 year old female named Katniss Everdeen who is described as a huntress as in Greek mythology, the woman named Diana. The core teen male characters are Peeta Melllark a baker's son who develops an attraction to Katniss early in the story and Gale Hawthorne Katniss' male hunting companion and best friend. The movie version of Hunger games spends little time in character development as is more highly developed in the book. Thematically Judeo-Christian themes of sacrifice and righteousness are at the movie's heart as in the in the book.

There is a surprising absence of cinematic special effects, employed in the film version. I found that aspect of the movie disappointing and more B-movie graded. Little creativity was used in the costuming such as those worn by the tributes during the majority of the film that consisted of nylon/Gore-Tex type windbreakers and odd buckle laden leather booths. My first thought was how impractical the leather boots were given the wet rain forest type environment the filmmakers chose as a backdrop in the movie. The forest scenes reminded me of the forests in the coastal areas of the northwest around Seattle and Vancouver B.C. In reality filmed in western North Carolina.

 The use of chariots in the film is corny as is the super high speed train that transports the characters from District 12 to the Capitol for the outset of the ""Hunger Games"" a pseudo gladiator styled arena type combat held outdoors using primitive weapons such as swords and spears, the most sophisticated weapon is the bow and arrows used by Katniss. Again, for modern cinema goers the special effects were sadly disappointing.

In general, the movie mimicked the book reasonably closely in content. The imagery conjured in my own imagination from the pages was a far grander than the film. The acting was reasonable but nothing of the caliber Jennifer Lawrence (Katniss Everdeen), Josh Hutchinson (Peeta Meelark) is capable of, I rate the acting above average, but nowhere near Oscar level. The role of Haymitch Abernathy, drunk and former District 12 Games winner was played ably by well-known character actor Woody Harelson. The President of Panemli was played well by seasoned screen actor Donald Sutherland. A surprise skillfully acted part as makeup artist and dresser was played by musician-actor Lenny Kratvitz. The Games host-announcer Caesar Flickerman was well acted by veteran actor Stanley Tucci.

The Hunger Games attracted some A list actors along with upward moving Lawrence but some of the punch was diluted by the tight schedule, budget, and lacking special effects. A cadre of little known and a lot of unknowns rounded out the somewhat large cast. The stand outs in my view were Kravitz, Harrelson, and Lawrence.

One of the major surprises was the music. Contributors were from several genres, The Civil Wars (Folk), Arcade Fire (alt. Rock) and Taylor Swift (pop-country) The Decemberists,  The Secret Sisters, Miranda Lambert featuring The Pistol Annies,  Neko Case, Kid Cudi. Academy Award winner Glen Hansard, The Low Anthem, Punch Brothers, Birdy, Maroon 5, Jayme Dee, and Carolina Chocolate Drops. The soundtrack was released on March 20, 2012. The soundtrack track list was revealed on iTunes on February 13, 2012, and on the 14th ""One Engine"" was released as the second single. Jennifer Lawrence singing ""Rue's Lullaby"" was not included on the soundtrack. The album debuted at No. 1 on the Billboard Top 200 chart, having sold 175,000 copies in its first week. It was the first since Michael Jackson's This Is It to debut at #1. It is one of just 16 soundtracks to grace the top slot in the history of the Top 200.

Critics compared ""Hunger Games"" to a plethora and similar of varying films. Globally, the film has fared well and been somewhat widely accepted. From a financial perspective ""Hunger Games"" was exceptionally lucrative with a global total of $686,533,290.  During the film's opening weekend, controversial statements about various members of the cast arose, sparking open dialog about issues of racism, sexism and unrealistic body image. There was a racial issue among some social network users concerning racism themes regarding African-American actors and characters in both in the book and film. These comments are based on individual interpretations posted and written about in a public forum.",1355529600,,5305,5.172494172494172
4946850,2,B0063FQREO,"Imagine taking reality TV, Star Wars, Gladiator, and The Lottery, throwing them into a bag, shaking it and then spilling out the contents. Voila! Instant Hunger Games. The beautiful part about this mashup is that since there are so many themes, so many cliches, so many tropes you really don't have to bother with a good script, or character development, or logic. The only thing you really need is a nice score and someone behind the camera.

But, what about all those pesky logic problems? Everyone in the downtrodden districts hates the Hunger Games, and yet they are proud of the winners. (It was awfully hard to cheer the two finalists on. I really wanted them to die and make a point.) And, if the districts are so downtrodden, so hungry, how can they afford to have bakeries? Frosted cakes? And, if the rulers are so advanced, why don't they just buy off the downtrodden, exploited people they rule? Wouldn't it be easier to simply give them food and nice houses and a bath along with their TVs? Nobody would rebel against that. (We certainly haven't.)

But, I am getting ahead of myself. Stories like these don't need to make sense. They just need enough hijacked symbolism to make them appear profound.",1355529600,2,1211,4.7075471698113205

It was a pretty well-done adaptation, although the completely unnecessary shakey-cam in the opening minutes was frustrating and agonizing, and some of the backstory establishing Peeta's longstanding admiration of Katniss--in particular the time he wordlessly saved her family from starvation--wasn't as clear or powerful as I thought it should have been.  Some of the social satire comes out loud & clear, but some of it doesn't.  All in all, not a great film--but a decent one worth seeing if you've read the book, or just are interested in the premise.

Parents, do keep the rating in mind.  This is a story about children being forced, but a totalitarian government, to murder each other for a decadent populace's amusement--it gets fairly brutal at times.",1355443200,,837,4.9928057553956835

4946879,5,B0063FQREO,"Unfortunately I read the book before I seen the movie, so it was somewhat disappointing. But it does not reflect on the part of the acting of Miss Lawrence or the other wonderful actors and actress's. This was a very good movie, just compared to the book it leaves a lot to be disired as far as detail. I give it a five star because of the great acting and performance by those in the movie.",1355270400,,391,4.157894736842105

4946882,4,B0063FQREO,"after all the hype and hoopla over this series and movie, i was pleasantly surprised to find the story easy to follow and enjoyable. the heroine was likeable, and often just enough  unpredictable, to make the plot beleivable and  interesting. even  though she was flat and deadpan through most of the movie, Katniss has a few surprisingly human twists and saves the story from being completely predictable and boring",1355184000,,416,5.0
4946883,5,B0063FQREO,"The movie is pretty faithful to the book series, and thought I would disagree with some of the casting choices, all of the actors do a great job at portrayal of the characters and the story, definitely worth picking up a copy for a serious Hunger Games fan.

4946884,5,B0063FQREO,"I thought this was a surprisingly good adaptation of the book when you consider the audience it was intended for.  There were some obvious adjustments to make this more friendly to young teens but I didn't feel that it really took away from the story in a meaningful way.  You miss some of the more nuanced issues between Gale, Peeta, and Katniss but I think that realistically that's true of most movie adaptations of books.  I would definitely recommend reading the books because I thought they were amazing, but the movie version is pretty good as well.",1355184000,,556,4.711340206185567

4946886,4,B0063FQREO,"If you enjoyed Suzanne Collin's novels then you will most likely enjoy the film version, as well. Much like the novels, to someone well read and/or someone who is a film buff, this is a fresh-take and entertaining film, but truly not all that original in concept; the same argument can be said of the novels. To a new generation without an extensive knowledge of books and films, it probably seems original and fresh, though; and let's face it themes get redone countless times in various generations, so this is not unique to Suzanne Collin's novels or the 'Hunger Games' film. While I enjoyed the novels and this first film in the series, in all honesty, I've seen this theme countless times, as I mentioned in both novels and films prior to this series, and done much better quite frankly. But for what it is, it is a fresh take on an age-old theme, it is entertaining, well made, and for the most part, well-acted by the actors.",1355184000,,932,4.553571428571429

They did an ok job but, I would say they missed the boat on identifying with the characters and Peeta was cast wrong.  Not sure if Katniss was cast correctly either.  Prim was not as small and innocent as she came across in the book.  I do like the casting of Haymitch, Katniss' mother, Effie, President Snow, and Rue.

4946902,4,B0063FQREO,"I was surprised and amazed by the excellence of the Hunger Games books (trilogy), it being rare to find a near-classic in a hyped/popular Young Adult novel. The film version of the first of these books, The Hunger Games, is however not so wonderful. Good, but missing so very much that makes the books valuable. In the books, we learn young Katniss's doubts and questions of her actions; we struggle with her not only against the City and the Games, but also to find, amid the unreal world of Audience and Games, the truth or irreality of her love for Peeta, the depths or limitations of her love for Gale.
  This film version of the first book, however, loses much of this essential struggle within Katniss. To some extent this simply reflects a standard problem in book to film conversion. One other loss, however, may be more immediate to the viewer: clarity as to what is taking place in the narrative. In the book, when Katniss sees spots of blood from the wounded Peeta, we already know where and how he has been wounded, and it makes sense Katniss be looking in that vicinity; in the film, suddenly she just comes upon the blood spots. In the book, we know that her father was killed in a mine blast and his photo sits on the family's mantel; in the film, we can guess perhaps who's in the photo seen in flashback, but there is no hint--not a clue--what the flashbacked blast is about, or how this relates to the ongoing plot.
  All this said, the film works. It is exciting, the acting generally excellent, the photography stunning, the sets atmospheric and superb. Adults and young people will enjoy it. Only, it's not quite up to the book.",1355097600,,1649,4.542087542087542

4946905,4,B0063FQREO,"Films of humans-hunting-humans for sport crop up often enough to constitute an entire genre. (Why such flicks are popular is a subject best addressed somewhere other than in an Amazon pocket review.) To name just a few: the granddaddy is the much parodied The Most Dangerous Game (1932) in which shipwrecked Joel McCrea and Fay Wray (King Kongs squeeze in 33) are set loose in the jungle to be hunted by the sporting Count Zaroff; in the The 10th Victim (1965) contestants willingly compete in the Hunt for prizes, sponsorship deals, fame, and fortune; in Death Race 2000 drivers in outlandish sports cars score points by killing pedestrians.

In The Hunger Games, the contestants from 12 districts go out into the wild and vie with each other until only one survives. The sport is followed by everyone in the land. The denizens of the 12 districts, by rooting for their own local contestants, in a peculiar way become invested and implicated in the games and in the society. It is an enjoyable film of its type, though the central character Katniss is a bit too conveniently spared the necessity of killing any sympathetic characters in the games. Those who haven't read the novels will have to wait to see if she can stay so morally pristine in the upcoming sequel.",1355097600,,1267,4.759090909090909

4946908,4,B0063FQREO,"This film was adapted from Suzanne Collins novel, The Hunger Games, which seem to be tugging towards the same spotlight as the Harry Potter series and Twilight series.  This film is steered towards the Young Adult crowd.
 The movie was directed by Gary Ross who is well known for directing movies like ""Seabiscuit"" and ""Pleasantville."" Jennifer Lawrence plays the main heroine, Katniss Everdeen, who is independent and acts as the head of the family after her father passed away. Jennifer Lawrence was nominated for an Academy Award for her previous movie ""Winter's Bones."" Josh Hutcherson portrays Peeta Mellark, a Baker's son (ironic much- Pita Bread). Liam Hemsworth plays Gale Hawthrone, a good friend of Katniss. Other big names include Woody Harrelson, Elizabeth Banks, Stanley Tucci, and Donald Sunderland, and Lenny Kravitz.

 What makes ""The Hunger Games"" unique from any other fictional story out there?
 Unlike ""Harry Potter"" and ""Twilight"", ""The Hunger Games is set in a future utopia of the United States, where an anarchy rule has taken place. In other words, the rich get richer and the poor get poorer. There are 12 districts in the nation of Panem. Out of the 12 districts, one boy and one girl are chosen at random between the ages of 12-18 to participate in the Hunger Games from each district. In total there are 24 tributes. These 24 tributes must battle it out till death to bring victory for their respective district. They battle it out in an arena. Only one may come out alive. Katniss, Peeta, and Gale all belong to District 12. When Katniss' 12 year old sister is chosen to participate, Katniss' sisterly instinct takes over and she ""volunteer as tribute"" for District 12. Peeta is then chosen as the boy to complete the tributes for District 12. Katniss and Peeta are portrayed as ""distant lovers"" to gain appeal from the masses watching in Panem. The action-packed film, ""The Hunger Games,"" will have you sitting at the edge of your seat.
 The tone of the movie is extremely vulnerable because at any point a character's flaws may be revealed and therefore ruin their chance of succeeding. Each tribute must overcome each of the hurdles that the game makers throw at them even if it does cost them their lives.
 This stunning and unique film is a must see because the bonds of friendship, love, and sacrifice get tested. I give the movie 4 out of 5 stars for the amazing depth in drama and action.",1355097600,12,2426,4.8173076923076925

4946930,4,B0063FQREO,"The books are much better of course. They really are modern classics and should be read. however this does a good job of taking a huge idea and condensing it. the killings are not graphic and very old school mostly but that's ok because this is a pg movie. However I do think a bloodier version is needed, because killing people is a bloody disgusting affair actually. I did enjoy this movie alot though , the acting was spot on and similiar to the books vision. So that's a good thing here. The lead actress really carries this movie well too, she's got a bright future ahead of her if she doesn't blow it with drugs like so many before her have. the blu ray looks fantastic, it's not a four k picture but then only a few movies are shot that way anyways and there is no format for that anyway.  This was a smash hit at the box office though and worth your viewing. read the books though , they are better, just like the lord of the rings are better books than movies too. The blu ray has a seperate disc of special features and that's good too. I was glad to get the cheaper version without a digital copy or dvd. Please stop putting those in my blu ray package! It drives up the price. The story is about a society that like Rome uses violent games to help subdue the population and control them. It's more in depth in the books , but this version gets the point accross. It's a good movie that is aimed at younger viewers in spite of the themes here. It's in my collection to stay on blu ray for sure.",1354924800,,1505,4.171821305841925

Plus, you cannot get this woman to sit still for ANY movie. One morning I was watching it, she came in... she wouldn't even get up to get her morning coffee!

The story is simple it takes place in the us after a big war. The capital is in the rocky mountians and our hero is in the smokey mountians. They have a contest each year. As part of the peace treaty each district must send one male and female child to compete in a fight to the death. The winning district gets more food and though the capital has food to spare the districts are starving to death literally. Everyone is forced to watch and if no child offers to go a name is chosen by lottery. Our hero's sister is chosen and she, our hero, volunteers. We then see her dealing with people she hates, knowing that she needs them to live though the games. We see her eyes open to understand others and learn not to hate all the capital's people. Yet she still holds her hate for the game the leaders and all they stand for. Does she fight yes does she win well I'll tell you this much. If you get the wrong dvd you may never know.

4946952,2,B0063FQREO,"A futuristic, orderly, but sick society.

THX-1138, Rollerball, and about 50 episodes of the Twilight Zone did it better. Far better. Part of it was the cast. I didn't like any of them except maybe the girl, and just when I realized this, Woody Harrelson walks in. But I pressed on, for about 5 more minutes. I probably would have liked Donald Sutherland, but I turned it off before he had said much of anything.

I think if Sandra Bullock and Keanu Reeves had a child, that child could not grow up to be as bad at acting as the lady in pink.

Not the best review, but I've watched a lot of movies lately and this is the only one I turned off.

Update: I decided to watch the rest the next day while cleaning up my computers' file system. It was less unbearable because my expectations were so low and I was only half watching.

4946954,4,B0063FQREO,"For some reason I'd gotten it into my head that I wanted to read this book, and so I did. And then there was the movie - which of course I had to see because ... well who doesn't read a book and then see it was made into a movie and want to see the result?

Now, there are a ton of reviews out there already. So I don't know as mine will matter - especially because I'm going for a 4* and not some extreme or the other.

I thought the movie kept pretty close to the book BUT for the person I was watching with I had to explain a lot which makes this one of those ""REALLY NEED TO READ THE BOOK FIRST"" types of movies.

The person I watched it with thought it was a good movie, but was a bit confused by things,  and I really did have to fill in a LOT of the details that were left out in the movie version. A prime example, and not meant to be a spoiler, but when Katniss and Gale are talking about how many times their names are submitted, there is nothing to tell the person who hasn't read the book why that is important or what it entails. (How many times a name is entered IS very important.)

CAST:
Excellent. The cast for the movie was absolutely spot on. The only one that had me off a bit was Cinna, but I had gotten a bit of a different impression in reading the books. President Snow maybe just a tad as well, I wasn't expecting someone as ... how do I say this but I think at the Capitol they might have gotten someone who at least *cough* looked younger than Donald Sutherland. He played it well, but ... I think it was mis-cast. When going back to the book, he should have been much younger looking, although ""enhanced"" maybe ... it was all a bit off.",1354752000,,1664,3.970059880239521
4946955,5,B0063FQREO,"I am not usually into ""super girl"" type movies. However this one is quite different.

4946966,3,B0063FQREO,"This review will contain some plot elements.

As with most movie adaptations, the book was a better story and this was no exception. Some plot elements that I thought were relevant, were missing or completely changed from the book. Granted, having to tell an entirely first person story from a spectating perspective has to be difficult but the plot didn't have to be sacrificed to get there. The hovercraft in the beginning had no relevance since it was a flashback to when she recognized one of the servants after arriving at the Capitol. The mockingjay wasn't picked up in the Hob. Haymitch was introduced into the story earlier in the book than in the movie. The Capitol was more of a spectacle than it was. Even parts of the games were different, especially the finale. Thresh was thought to have died by Cato, not the muttations. No heat wave driving them together. No face to face with Cato as he ran from the muttations. And no realization that the Capitol had somehow genetically engineered them from the dead tributes.

I believe that the ultimate goal was to tell Katniss' story throughout the book and develop the discontent for the Capitol. This building up seemed to be lacking in the movie. Perhaps it will get better when Catching Fire sees it's theatrical release. Here's hoping it stays a little truer to the book this time around.",1354665600,,1349,4.736170212765957

But this movie's representation of populous control, propaganda and general despotism is far far far too close to the current day reality to enjoy.  I guess I am not surprised that none of the other reviewers that I read seem to appreciate this, however, like this movie, I find it extremely disturbing... in the same way I am extremely disturbed that the majority are so easily manipulated into thinking that our government consists of a ""two party system"" and that we only have two choices to choose from.",1354579200,,566,4.64

While I was not thrilled about some of the adaptations the movie made from the books, I think the film is true to the spirit of the books. Plus, knowing that Suzanne Collins had a hand in the screenplay makes me feel, if the changes were ok with her, they're ok with me. A fantastic film, and a great purchase. The 2-disk DVD comes with some great extras, and I am so thankful for the digital copy that came along with it so I can play the movie from my Kindle or phone when I'm away too.",1354579200,,551,3.9285714285714284

4946979,5,B0063FQREO,"This movie takes place on another planet, but has an overall story line of our current Earth and how some countries treat their people. There are many scenes that preach messages that they try to hide in the overall story. The movie is great because it has a fantasy quality that is like watching a Dungeons and Dragons game play out in real life, on a different, but similar planet.
Oh, did I say it takes place on a planet? They seem to leave it up to the viewer to decide if the movie is on a planet, if there is magic, or as any Star Trek fan would immediately recognize as a holodeck.

The world of the capital, with it's extreme hair and clothing fashions was a special treat to view.  The hunger games themselves were captivating in their reality.

I bought this set for a young friend who is ecstatic about the extra material.  Stay tuned, I will give you an update when she views it.",1354579200,,430,4.68
4946985,1,B0063FQREO,"I really wish I could get a refund and my time back- that's how much I detested this film. The book was sooooo much better. Why? Because it was better paced and characters actually had development. I liked Jennifer Lawrence as Kat, but only in the looks department, which is funny because I did not like Josh Hutcherson for Peeta looks-wise but he actually pulled off the essence of his character. The actress who played Rue was perfect. In fact, a lot of the actors were what you would expect them to look like in the book. However, the script's dialogue was awful, the cinematography unimpressive, and the film's plot overall lacking. The director did not give these actors a lot to work with and it showed. I did like how they attempted to show what was going on with the Gamemakers behind the scenes, but it got drowned out by the other things going on. I liked how they portrayed the Capitol residents. Their costumes were fantastic, but the others were lackluster and cheap-looking. The truth is if I didn't read this book I would have been at a loss as to what was going on and why I should care. The movie didn't make me care about the characters or any of the tributes while the book made me cry and laugh and reel in horror at the Capitol. I really wanted to turn the movie off after ten minutes, but I sat through the whole thing because I wanted to get my money's worth. I still don't feel like I got my money's worth. In the future I will stick to the books instead unless the author singlehandedly directs and produces the film.",1354492800,5,1542,4.395104895104895

4947012,5,B0063FQREO,"""The Hunger Games"", the award winning young adult novel by American television writer and novelist Suzanne Collins.

Inspired by watching a competition on reality TV and the invasion of Iraq, the Greek myth of Theseus and Roman gladiator games, ""The Hunger Games"" received rave reviews in 2008 by film critics but also criticized for its similarity to Koushun Takami's 1999 novel ""Battle Royale"" and Stephen King's ""The Running Man"" and ""The Long Walk"".

But despite its criticism, ""The Hunger Games"" did receive a number of awards and honors in 2008and would go on to receive a film adaptation courtesy of Lions Gate Entertainment and produced by Nina Jacobson's production Company Color Force. The film adaptation was done by Suzanne Collins with help from screenwriter Billy Ray (""Color of Night"", ""State of Play"", ""Flightplan"") and also featured a collaboration with filmmaker Gary Ross (""Big"", ""Pleasantville"", ""Seabiscuit""). Ross would direct the film and would work with cinematographer Tom Stern (""Gran Torino"", ""Million Dollar Baby"", ""Mystic River"") and feature music composed by James Newton Howard (""The Sixth Sense"", ""The Fugitive"", ""Unbreakable"").

""The Hunger Games"" would star actress Jennifer Lawrence (""X-Men: First Class"", ""Winter's Bone"", ""Like Crazy""), Josh Hutcherson (""Bridge to Terabithia"", ""The Kids Are All Right"", ""American Splendor""), Woody Harrelson (""No Country for Old Men"", ""Zombieland"", ""Natural Born Killers"", ""Cheers""), Donald Sutherland (""The Italian Job"", ""Pride & Prejudice"", ""Ordinary People""), Liam Hemsworth (""Last Song"", ""Knowing"", ""Triangle""), Elizabeth Banks (""Zack and Miri Make a Porno"", ""The 40-Year-Old Virgin"", ""The Next Three Days""), Stanley Tucci (""The Devil Wears Prada"", ""The Terminal"", ""The Lovely Bones""), Wes Bentley (""American Beauty"", ""The Four Feathers"") and rock star Lenny Kravitz (""Austin Powers: The Spy Who Shagged Me"", ""Previous"", ""Bad Boys II"").

The film which was budgeted at $78 million would become an enormous success in the box office, earning over $684 million surpassing ""Eclipse"" for the record of first-day advanced ticket sales and became the largest opening weekend for a film not released during the summer or holiday.  The film would receive favorable reviews from film critics, although similar to the novel, would be compared to its similarities with the Japanese film ""Battle Royale"".

And now, ""The Hunger Games"" has been released on Blu-ray and DVD.  The 2-disc Blu-ray comes with a digital copy, while the 2-disc DVD also comes with a digital copy and the film will also be available On Demand.

VIDEO:

""The Hunger Games"" is presented in 1080p High Definition (2:40:1 Widescreen Presentation).  Its important to note that the ""The Hunger Games"" was shot on film and not digitally.  Shot in North Carolina, there was artificial coloring used in order to make Katniss' area seem lush.  But its when the characters leave their district, we see how beautiful this film looks.  From the closeups of the characters, the detail in their costume design and even the use of visual effects throughout the film, the picture quality looked absolutely fantastic.

During my viewing, especially in scenes with a lot of red, I saw no banding, I saw no artifacts nor did I see any problematic issues with this film.  ""The Hunger Games"" is crisp, vibrant and looks absolutely amazing on Blu-ray!

AUDIO & SUBTITLES:

""The Hunger Games"" is presented in English 7.1 DTS-HD Master Audio, English 2.0 Dolby Digital Audio Optimized for Late-Night Listening, Spanish 5.1 Dolby Digital Audio,  I have to say that the 7.1 lossless soundtrack is absolutely immersive.  I was amazed of how sound was utilized, may it be for the sound of a spacecraft flying above, canons being shot, the crowd screaming all around you.  This is an immersive soundtrack in which the surround channels are effectively used, especially LFE.  There is no doubt that audiophiles will enjoy this lossless soundtrack.  It's fantastic!

Subtitles are presented in English, English SDH or Spanish Subtitles.

JUDGMENT CALL:

OK, I admit it.  I was wrong.

I was wrong to not to have interest in this film because of a few saying it was a ""Battle Royale"" knock off.

I was wrong not to have watched this film because my wife loved it so much, she wanted to see it again (and this never happens).  She loved it so much, she read all the books and was enthusiastic enough to recommend a movie to me (which rarely happens).

But when a movie does so well, receives its praise and also its controversial criticism, I figured that I needed to see what all the hype was all about.  See it for myself and decide.

And after watching ""The Hunger Games"", I can tell you right now that I absolutely...loved it!

Granted, I'm a sucker for underdog type films.  Humanity being oppressed and someone to stand up and fight back.  We see it so much with male action heroes but here we are with a film with a strong female character.  But most importantly, director Gary Ross was able to transform Suzanne Collins novel to the big screen.

From the visual effects and production design, I immediately took notice to see how the children were dressed when they headed out to the lottery.  I took notice of the makeup of Effie Trinket, so different from others with her outlandish costume design but yet separating her from the people of the district.  From seeing how those selected to battle being part of the opening ceremonies to the viciousness of the battles that took place.  The storyline is so effective and you automatically pull for the underdog.

And yes, there are similarities to ""Battle Royale"" and even ""The Running Man"", but that's not to say that ""The Hunger Games"" was inspired by these films, as Suzanne Collins was not.  The fact is that we live in a society where reality TV has now become prime time television.  People love to see the underdogs win.  People love to see television taking things up a notch in order to surprise viewers and not succumb to last year and previous year's banal circumstances.

""The Hunger Games"" is sleek in style but pays off in character portrayal.  First, let's talk about the visual style.

Director Gary Ross was able to take Suzanne Collins but build upon its story through visual effects.  Letting people know that the Capitol is responsible for this faux arena.  They are able to manipulate the games through technology, to effectively communicate with their viewers who are pulling for their district, but also seeing how those in competition must win over sponsors.  The way things were paced and executed was wonderfully done and the costume design, makeup, set design made this sci-fi film believable and effective.

But of course, you like any film or video game that can have a flashy presentation, it's characters are important.

And that is where ""The Hunger Games"" wins over the viewer through its characters that are children fighting to survive.  Automatically, you get a good feeling of who is going to die.  When you see young kids, with no exceptional skills and are forced to fight but are in fear of being killed against older, much experienced teens, it's heartbreaking.

All of these characters are vulnerable, but yet they fight for not themselves but their district, ensuring that their district can be fed for a year.  We see how the Capitol, especially through its President tries to manipulate the system, we see how the people of the districts are powerless and we see how these characters must put on a brave face and essentially market themselves to viewers in order to win over sponsors.

Where ""The Running Man"" was more about action and ""Battle Royale"" was more interesting of seeing how many violent ways teens can be killed, ""The Hunger Games"" does feature violence but it's not the primary focus.

It was important to have an actress that is not a perfect hero, a character that is vulnerable and this is where actress Jennifer Lawrence shined as Katniss Everdeen.  Yes, she has experience as tracker and a hunter but she is also a young woman who doesn't want to die.  Who wants to live for her family and be back for her sister.  And the way that Lawrence plays Katniss, is so convincing, so pure and just wonderful.  Yes, I am aware of the criticism of how the poor districts have people who must be thin and starving and that should reflect in the casting of its character.  But I've looked at it as her skills of a hunter allowed her and her family to eat.  Not everyone is a skilled hunter, she is.

We have her fellow district mate, Peeta Mellark, who has no major fighting skills, aside from working in a bakery and throwing flour and also knowing how to paint himself in order to disguise himself, so he would not be caught.  But then you have this romantic angle, with Peeta who has had a long crush on Katniss.  And part of you is pulling for him to also survive.  Actor Josh Hutcherson who plays Peeta has come a long way as a child star and now a teen actor and to see how this actor has grown so much since starring in ""Little Manhattan"" and ""Bridge to Terabithia"".

Woody Harrelson was also great in playing the District 12 mentor, Haymitch Abernathy.  Thinking that his kids don't have a chance but then seeing Katniss' resilience and believing in her.  It was an interesting role to see Harrelson play but it turned out pretty good.

And there are many more characters that are notable, talent who did a good job playing their characters.  Elizabeth Banks, Stanley Tucci, Donald Sutherland, Wes Bentley, Amandla Stenberg to name a few.

As for the Blu-ray release, picture quality and the lossless audio was fantastic.  I don't think videophiles or audiophiles have anything to complain about this film.  As for special features, you get a lengthy making of featurette but also plenty of other shorter special features included.  The Blu-ray release comes with two Blu-rays, one for the film and the other for the special features but also a digital copy via Ultraviolet is included.

Overall, ""The Hunger Games"" was a film that I didn't want to see because of its comparisons to ""Battle Royale"" but I realized that I was wrong to even think that way.  Not only is the film fantastic but while there are similarities to ""Battle Royale"" and ""The Running Man"", this film is much more effective in how the characters are portrayed.

Jennifer Lawrence is absolutely amazing and well-cast for her role as Katniss and I will never understand why one would complain about young Black talents such as Amandla Stenberg playing  Rue or Dayo Okenyi playing Thresh.  It's unimaginable that people complained about it and refuse to see the movie because of it.  Unimaginable but also another lesson that even though society has changed a lot in the last 50 years, ignorance still exists.  While the character of Thresh had a small part in this film, the character of Rue and Amandla Stenberg played this character magnificently and felt the character of Rue and her interaction with Katniss was one of the most important, unforgettable scenes of the film.

Overall, ""The Hunger Games"" was a film that was pulse-pounding, exciting and all-out entertaining!  Not only was it an effective sci-fi film but it's been a long while since I watched a new sci-fi film that made me excited for the upcoming sequels and yes, even making me want to read the books.  I enjoyed the film that much!

And while I have no doubt that the Blu-ray and DVD release of ""The Hunger Games"" will be an amazing success for Lions Gate Entertainment, I'm also confident in highly recommending this Blu-ray release.  It's a must buy!",1354320000,,13011,4.983766233766234
4947013,3,B0063FQREO,"I bit long winded of a film. It also didn't include many surprises. I have not read the books to use as a point of comparison. Overall, a decent flick, if a bit boring.",1354320000,,168,3.9705882352941178
4947014,5,B0063FQREO,"That's what I think about Hunger Games. The same way we read Bradbury and other sci-fi social dreamers, this series seems so far fetched.  But the idea of taking our very best, our families, and turning them into entertainment? It's the Survivor series gone mainstream.",1354320000,,269,4.977777777777778

4947018,2,B0063FQREO,"Perhaps I'm too old for hackneyed ""Most Dangerous Game"" knockoffs like this, although I found the performances of the leads entertaining. Everyone's a bloodthirsty sociopath in the near future except the Everdeens & Peeta, apparently. The anti-violence message is delivered with leaden earnestness while showing us gobs of good old ultra-violence, as is so common these days. But mostly the 'you are there' shaking camera style ruined it for me. Did Cloverdale make money? Ugh! Who finds this entertaining? Who doesn't get dizzy trying to watch a lurching image for longer than a few seconds? It's one thing on America's Funniest Videos, quite another when you've paid dearly to be entertained and get nauseated for your trouble. I'll skip the sequel.",1354233600,,751,5.214876033057851

4947022,5,B0063FQREO,I loved the novels and the dystopian future it warned of. Putting it to film in such a raw way was awesome. Perfect for sleepovers or girl's night or whatever. It has a great feel and a great message.,1354147200,,200,4.153846153846154

4947026,2,B0063FQREO,"The epic struggle between ""The Capitol"" and ""The Districts"" is matched only by the struggle to see what is happening in the story because the camera is incessantly zoomed in too close, jiggled, pointed off-center, etc., until it is simply TEDIOUS to watch.

4947032,5,B0063FQREO,"If you liked the books, you'll enjoy the movie.  It stayed as close to the book as it reasonably could within the time frame.  It was very well done and I recommend it.",1354147200,,168,4.0606060606060606
4947033,2,B0063FQREO,"I never read the books but I heard about the movie and was eager to see it based on what I heard.
Maybe you're weren't meant to feel when you watched this movie, maybe you needed to be a teenager who read the books or maybe there just wasn't enough 'anything' to get a handle on. I never believed her relationship with her co-runner, it was never really properly developed or believable. Yes, I know they were running for their lives but even with; personal view here nope didn't believe they cared for each other.
Best part about the movie, her relationship with the younger girl, the two of them against the rest, that was believable,made me care; I would have rather watched an entire movie just with them.  I understand all the other dribble was quasi necessary to the plot but for me it was jut fill.
 I generally don't watch action movies so I'm sort of oblivious to most of it other than the occasional, ""oh that was cool!"" scene but even with I believe we watch to care or even share what we view. Maybe I'm just too old!
  That Japanese movie someone mentioned; ""Battle Royal"",  that was good, that was SHOCKING, SUPRISING, and believe it or not, you gave a damn...you wanted the bad guys to get it and you felt bad when other characters got knocked out. This movie, (""Hunger Games"") made its money and it'll continue to make it with or without my personal feelings about it.
  I'd check out ""Battle Royal"" if you enjoy movies but if you're a person that mainly watched Hunger Games for the eye candy or cause you read the books... I  leave it up to you.
 I personally can't wait to see ,  ""The Odd Life of Timothy Green""  and  ""Paranormon""  so go figure!  Good Day.",1354147200,,1675,4.396103896103896
4947034,2,B0063FQREO,"It was ok, i know most people raved about her, but idk I wanted more from it. The book was better. Maybe it's Hyatt the kind of story better told in words than pictures. I felt they lacked in portraying done of the more emotional moments. I also didn't like that they cut done kinda important details. If the choose to do all 3 books, they will have to back pedal or invent to stay true to story, unless they plan to do more cutting.",1354147200,,433,4.105882352941176

4947060,5,B0063FQREO,"The book series was by far one of the best reads I have come across, and when I came across the movie I already had my mind made up.  Compressing the three books into this single film sure had its downsides however.  Much of the detail that brought emotion from the books was omitted in the movie, but the important facts and heartwretching moments were all preserved.  This movie would make a perfect candidate for any movie collection, any family, and would be perfect as a gift.",1353974400,,481,4.505747126436781

It seems fairly hit or miss, but as someone that read the books, I really enjoyed the movie. I thought it captured the key moments of the story. My fiance watched the movie with him, and having never read the books, still thought the movie was entertaining and easy to follow. He's looking forward to the next movie coming out.",1353974400,,449,4.555555555555555

4947070,5,B0063FQREO,While the movie doesn't follow the book completely it retains enough of the book to be a great story. Thank you,1353974400,,111,4.333333333333333
4947071,5,B0063FQREO,Fast shipping and great product! I would recommend this movie to audiences between ages 10 and 18. I got it as a present for my 14 year old sister and she loves it.,1353974400,,164,4.0

4947073,5,B0063FQREO,It was an excellent movie.  It closely followed the book and left the violence to your imagination.  I highly recommend seeing the movie after reading the book.,1353974400,,160,4.888888888888889
4947074,5,B0063FQREO,"If you're a fan of the books, you might not like the movie.  But if you can get over knowing all the back story, the movie is enjoyable by itself.  I've heard some people, who have not read the books, say that they enjoyed the movie, but there were gaping holes in the character development.  That's what you get when you try to adapt a book which was narrated in the first person to a feature-length film.

All things being equal, the movie has an interesting story-line, interesting characters, enough action to keep you interested, and a premium performance from Jennifer Lawrence that might just knock your socks off. The producers did an excellent job of depicting the poverty and desperation in the Districts, and a great job of depicting the Capitol as a grandiose, pretentious, albeit out-of-touch, power tripping place.

I was disappointed in their choices for Peeta and Gale.  And equally disappointed that they portrayed Gale as slightly more than a platonic friend to Katniss.  Their friendship was as close as one can get without being romantically involved, but the movie made it seem that Katniss was aware of having stronger feelings for him - which she wasn't.  I was also disappointed that the ambiguity and distrust she had for Peeta in the books wasn't conveyed in the film at all.  She just seemed to go along with whatever he was doing, while in the books she was a far stronger (independent) person with confused and distrustful feelings toward him.

I chalk it all up to the writers making the best choices they could, while chopping it down to 2 hours of screen time.

What I absolutely did NOT like about the movie, in fact I disliked it immensely, was that they completely wrote out the part of Mayor Undesee and his family.  His daughter's relationship with Katniss resonated with me later in the story.  His sister-in-law's relationship with Katniss' mother had quite a lot to do with Katniss' mother disposition in life.  The way the mayor showed compassion to the people of his district had a lot to do with the tributes reactions to what they experienced when they toured the other districts.  I think those relationships could have easily been fit into the film, without seeming arbitrary or uninteresting.

I waited quite a long while after I'd read the final book (for the 3rd time) before I watched this film - mainly to add a little buffer between the ""actual"" story, and the Hollywood version.  I'm so glad I did!

I like the movie for what it is.  I love the books for how they made me feel.",1353974400,,2530,4.683257918552036

I had just finished reading the book for a second time before the DVD came out, and I thought they set up the atmosphere of the book quite well.  I also thought the casting was well done and overall they stayed true to the movie.  Of course some parts were left out, but nothing that really changes the story.  Great movie, can't wait for the next one!",1353888000,,398,4.12987012987013
4947079,1,B0063FQREO,"Im not a religious person or spiritual person by any means and am rarely offended but this movie is disturbing.

4947081,5,B0063FQREO,"I rented the movie unaware of the story line. I thought the story was captivating and the film was casted and produced well. If a movie drags it can lose me, but Hunger Games kept me engaged the whole time. Loved it..I give it 4.5 stars...can't wait for the next movie.",1353888000,,269,4.294117647058823

4947084,5,B0063FQREO,Was a very interesting movie the wife and I enjoyed it and we're old folks the story line reminders me of another story I just can't put my finger on it right now.,1353888000,,163,3.9696969696969697
4947085,5,B0063FQREO,"My husband has one complaint - the relationships or background of the situation that the world was in is not explained well enough. Not everyone reads books and will watch the movie first, so the relationships and background should have been more in-depth. Otherwise, we both loved the movie and look forward to the next one.",1353888000,,325,4.821428571428571

4947087,5,B0063FQREO,"Of course you are not going to get the story granularity,  nor the deep character development, that you get from the written word, but its all there.  The characters in the movie were not as flamboyant and excessive as my imagination painted them in the book, but it was a fun adventure.  There is some implicated violence, mostly just off-camera, but the blood does get spurty occasionally so keep a pillow handy to cover your eyes if you are squeemish.  Cant wait for the sequel.",1353888000,2,481,4.623529411764705

4947092,2,B0063FQREO,"Once again, commerce beats cinematic art. A potentially great movie is buried in this watered-down adaptation of Suzanne Collins' futuristic bestseller. Despite a memorable cast and imaginative production design, the filmmakers lack the hard edge and tight pacing to deliver the goods. Director Gary Ross' reliance on shaky camera work (combined with his choppy editing technique) evades the novel's harsh violence and dramatic tension for a safe PG-13 rating. Rather than going for the sociological jugular, ""The Hunger Games"" pulls its punches. Hopefully, the sequel will benefit from stronger direction and less filmmaking by committee.",1353888000,3,639,5.7368421052631575
4947093,5,B0063FQREO,I love books being made into movies. Because I like to see my imagenation come to life. I was so glad when this book was going to be made into a movie. This book is a great literary series so I was extremely pleased to see that those who brought this book to life for us made it as closely related to the book as possible. Its great.,1353801600,,333,3.911764705882353
4947094,5,B0063FQREO,I watched this movie in the theater and then watched it on streaming as well. The streaming works well. I have never read the book. The movie stands on its on. It tells a very interesting and somewhat scary story. You really need to watch this with an open mind as some folks will find it very challenging material. Special effects are excellent. The story is violent so be warned there is a lot of explicit violence.,1353801600,,417,4.428571428571429
4947095,5,B0063FQREO,"The movie is excellent! It touches on so many ideals and wrong thinking by our society.  Sadly it portrays what some think our society is coming to.  I love Catness because she's smart, innovative and a smart A$$.  I identify with her wanting to protect and defend verses attacking, but there comes a time when it's enough and its time to fight back.  The movie is very Rambo and Point of no Return meets Blue Lagoon in that she's stuck, she can hunt and she's cunning.  It really is a must watch but don't leave the room because there's so much dialogue in it that's ""Telling"" the story and you can't miss a second of it.  I hope you enjoy like we all did",1353801600,,656,4.25
4947096,2,B0063FQREO,Movie was very disappointing after reading the book.  No character development at all - you didn't feel anything for the characters.  Should have skipped the control room scenes (which were NOT in the book) and concentrated on what WAS in the book.,1353801600,,248,4.880952380952381
4947097,4,B0063FQREO,"I'm not a movie critic, so I'll save that for the experts.  I enjoyed the movie and thought it was very well acted and stitched together.  I felt the character development was well done.

Online - as an Amazon Prime customer with 2 Kindle accounts, I find it a bit annoying that I can't watch an HD movie on my HD-compatible netbook.  Let's go Amazon - don't force me to buy a Fire.  I don't need a tablet.  Let me watch HD movies on my netbook!",1353801600,,445,4.116279069767442
4947098,3,B0063FQREO,"The movie, in and of itself, strikes an interesting look at humanity in general.  However, when a tall teenager grabs a younger teen and spins his head around killing him, this movie definitely merits an R-rating.  It's not shown off screen either.  Taking a 13 year old child to this movie is completely irresponsible.  The MPAA should be ashamed of itself.  It's absolutely amazing what they can get away with now in PG-13 movies.",1353801600,,432,4.783783783783784

Although I feel that the end fell flat, and the name ""hunger games"" doesn't seem to really be the best choice for the ""game"" they were playing.

I thought Jennifer Lawrence was great, but the actor playing Peeta seemed too small to have the strength credited to him.

4947121,5,B0063FQREO,Loved the book and the movie. Great overall though there were things about the book that obviously didn't translate as well in the movie either because of casting or time.

4947154,2,B0063FQREO,"Twilight doesn't have as broad of an audience as the Hunger Games, primarily due to the fact that Twilight is much more based on a love story with a bunch of hot guys, so the audience isn't nearly as broad as the Hunger Games, for obvious reasons. The Hunger Games is based more on action and violence. If you enjoy watching 12-18 year old children slaughtering each other, than The Hunger Games is for you, but I strongly advise you read the book first, otherwise you will only get a superficial understanding of the depth of the characters, as well as the entire point of the reason for The Hunger games & why some names are entered to be picked forcibly to compete in the hunger games, more than others. They address this issue in the movie, but offer no explanation for the reasons why. I read the book and watched the movie to be open-minded to giving it a chance. It is an entertaining movie, despite the wide gap of the ages of the CHILDREN being forced to kill each other, which is obviously ridiculous to expect a 12 year old, whose name has just been entered 1 time in the lottery to be randomly drawn during the reaping, a 13 year olds name is entered twice, a 14 year olds name is entered 3 times, and so on, to win the hunger game. So therefore, there are far more older children's names entered in the lottery to be picked out to be put in the hunger games. There are also other reasons the children's names are entered into the lottery more frequently, which is mentioned in the movie, but without any explanation why.  It has a touch of a love triangle to it, unlike The Twilight Saga which is primarily based on a love triangle, which comes together perfectly in the end, it's not a simple love/love triangle story. It actually isn't much of a love triangle, because the main character, Bella, clearly knows who she wants to be with throughout the entire saga. The third main character is her best friend, whom happens to be in love with her, but she's not in love with him. Anyway, The Hunger Games clearly is doing what Twilight did in terms of the concept of a love triangle, the last book being broken up into 2 movies, and to simply just capitalize on releasing the film right around the time The Twilight Saga is coming to it's conclusion, so fans are ready to fall in love with another love story, like Twilight, under nearly impossible circumstances for the lovers to be together, which makes for a far more interesting love story. So copying The Twilight Saga to make billions of dollars, putting children in a unrealistic age group; in a life or death situation, and doing a poor job of understanding the movie without having read the book, The Hunger Games is a little ridiculousa & lacks depth necessary to know what is going on in the movie, & is a total cop off of The Twilight Saga. The Hunger Games is worth watching, but don't expect it to be all it's been hyped up to be.",1353542400,,2906,4.411545623836127
4947155,1,B0063FQREO,"and it was called ""Battle Royale"".

I just want to say I stand firm on my opinion and review of this movie despite the barrage of spiteful and extremely petty down votes from over obsessive fans of this series looking to smite anyone who has something other than praise to give this adolescent film.

  I completely loved Battle Royale as it was an amazing and unbelievably good movie. It's hard to watch this and not see the similarities and also knowing that Battle Royale came out 10 years before this movie or book was even thought of. I didn't exactly buy into the hype of this movie because of so and actually took my time before deciding to sit down and watch it for the first time. This movie I think was just a bunch of hype the same as Black Swan and all those others than pop up out of no where and all of a sudden seem to capture the attention of the box office. Maybe it's one of those pictures where the book is different and much better but as a movie this one feels overly long and quite boring in a lot of parts. If you've seen Battle Royale or have not, you should definitely watch it. It goes into detail about the things this movie skimps over and explores the characters on a much deeper level. Watching The hunger games I felt I was watching almost like a B-movie rip off of Battle Royale, or how can I put it... it's a lot more toned down and that's which kills the shock value of the story. I think this is one of those movies you only enjoy if you've read the book and get to see it come alive. As for me it just didn't cut it especially since I've seen this done before only better with a much better plot. I'm sure there's die hard fanatics for ""The hunger games"" but if you've never seen ""Battle Royale"" than you really are just praising a false idol.

What makes this movie even more painstaking to watch is that it is long and not very engaging. I found myself pausing the video and running off to do other tasks, and then coming back to it. The movie just seemed to go on and on and on dragging out scenes forever and then having the nerve to give you one of those open endings. This movie is over 2 hours long and the story hardly has any real dialogue to it. You'll find yourself more mesmerized by trying to figure out the ridiculous fashions of this futuristic world. To me that was the more interesting part to watch especially the awkwardly shaped beard of one of the head figure characters. What also struck me was the character Rue and the uproar about the casting for that character. I couldn't believe how nasty people were over the casting of a cute little girl to play her character that basically only had a couple of lines to say. I mean I think if you blinked you'd miss her role in this movie. It really goes to show just how petty certain people can be over absolutely nothing (probably some of these people randomly down voting reviews). Especially in the case of a movie where the race of characters was never described. The biggest surprise was seeing Lenny Kravitz in the film. I didn't even know he was in to acting but his character was random enough so whatever.

The one thing I think that really hurt this movie the most was the lack of explanation in the film. The state of the society is never really explained. Why there are 12 districts and all of them are basically low class working districts and the city is lush and rich is never explained. What the ""hunger"" part about the entire game/story is about. They only hint at a scene where the main character is starving in flash backs or surprised to get a piece of bread from a friend saying ""is this real"" but that's all you get. No explanation at all as to why these districts are basically laborers that provide necessities for the well to do but live in poverty themselves. Just from the hints and I mean very few hints in the movie the children fighting all come from these repressed low class labor societies where they are picked at random to fight in these games and chosen to be the victor (btw that plot is never explained you have to piece it together yourself throughout the entire movie). It looked like the participating districts were rewarded with food or something if I saw correctly in the riots (also unexplained) but whatever. This is just a bad movie for lots of reasons but mostly for not explaining things that should be explained like the background for the story at least. There is just a simple clip shown in the movie about a war and the games sort of being like the Olympics to show that courage and strength still exists (yeah, still very pointless).

Here's where Battle Royale does everything so much better. The plot of a group of students being forcefully captured by the government and thrown into a Military war/social project called ""The Program"". The kids are handed weapons and supplies at random and told only one of them can survive and they have to kill all of their classmates if they want to make it home alive. The kids don't really understand what is going on (not even the bombs/tracking devices) around their neck. They at first are hesitant to participate in the game but when others start killing each other it suddenly becomes a game of instinct and survival. Some of the kids form social pacts to survive, some like to survive alone, and some just enjoy killing whomever they can find, and some just refuse to participate and try to find another way out. Battle Royale does the story better because its almost like a study of human survival. You get a chance to learn about the background on the characters and their relationship to the other characters which is what makes seeing one of them die or get killed more personal. You don't get to explore any other characters in The Hunger Games but the two main characters ""Bow girl"" and ""Guy who is useless"". There's also Rue who character depth includes ""These are Mocking Jays we use them to signal time in my district"" and that's about as much as you get. For a 2.5hr movie I find The Hunger Games to be extremely vague in a lot of areas it shouldn't be.

So basically overall... if you want to see a GOOD movie about Young adults being forced to kill other young adults watch Battle Royale.",1353542400,2,6204,4.402789886660854
4947156,2,B0063FQREO,"I finally rented The Hunger Games. There's two hours of my life I will never get back. Horrible cinematography (would have liked at least ONE steadycam shot), the viewer was not given a chance to feel much of the emotion (which means no emotional inventment at all), and, finally, unlike the book, I didn't really want Katniss and Prim to win.

I will not watch the rest of them. Oh, and by the way, Mr. Director of Photography, give your people room to BREATHE. Closeups and dirty-overs were so restrictive (and there were too many of them), that the whole thing could have been filmed at the park across from my High School (which is one block square). I give it 2 stars out of 5. The second star is to fatten the one-star, because not a single character looked hungry to begin with.",1353542400,,785,4.451388888888889

4947163,3,B0063FQREO,"I have read all 3 books and they are awesome. This is a story that sticks with you long after you've finished the book.  I was extremely excited to see the movie. I will say its just ok. However, I liked it well enough to watch the other 2 sequels that are coming. I would say that the movie delivers maybe 85-90% of the book's plot line, and the pacing of the movie is similar to the pacing in the book. I also think the Director did a phenomenal job in translating the people and the scenery to life - it is very much like what i pictured in my head as I read the book.  So I give the Director a thumbs up on that. But I think this a story that requires additional ""backstory"" to fully appreciate the horrors these people lived thru, both in and outside of the arena. I kept wishing for a little bit of narration from Katniss at key moments, particularly around the death of her father, and how she emerged from that experience a fierce survivor.  Also, Rue was a central and very symbolic character in the book, and her storyline felt rushed in the movie. I was moved by their last scene together, but am not sure I would have been very moved, or understood the significance of the moment, if I hadn't read the book first.  I found myself explaining a lot to my husband, who watched the movie with me but didn't read the books. I think he was lost in parts, and I could understand why.",1353456000,2,1388,4.187265917602996

4947181,3,B0063FQREO,"The concept of a televised arena games where kids killing kids in gladiator fashion certainly piques interest - the power of the concept to which the fanbase to the trilogy of novels the first book the film is based on can attest to - for an audience wanting something more visceral to sink their teeth in, unlike the otherwise bland offerings of another, popular book series with vampires for the young adult demographic.  With this regard, it comes across as a bit of a shame when The Hunger Games takes what could easily have been a more intentionally controversial premise and takes a more tame and conservative execution of these themes.

And perhaps having this film's teeth dulled could have been more forgiven had those not familiar with the events of the book be given enough of a reason to care about combatants in this 'battle royal'. Often, the film is eagerly trying to get us to feel for our reluctant little gladiators forced into combat in an authoritative society that greets their eventual demise like the punchline of a long and sick joke. Yet, there's only so much gravitas to be had about any of these fighter's death when we are only treated to several seconds of screen time among each, outside the characters the film wants us to root for. It doesn't help much when the rules surrounding the contest are constantly in flux, and thus the tensions and stakes for our heroes is dulled and no doubt thrown in to insure those with shorter attention spans are kept at the edge of their seats.

The Bottom Line:
Fans of the books will no doubt find this film to appeal to the elements that drew them to the franchise in the first place. Otherwise, this film leaves much desired, even if it still manages to provide the moderate enjoyment one can appreciate from a rental.",1353283200,,1788,4.634069400630914

I was astounded how much better this film was than I expected.  I also had no idea the books dealt with such a deep and important subject matter.  You do not need to know who Malthus even was or what horrors have been wrought in the world in his name to get the point of this movie.  You will get enough taste of it without needing any background.  You will probably want to know more afterwards, though.

I am still reducing the rating by a star because the pacing of the ending is off for some reason.  The climax just doesn't quite feel climactic to me.

However, there are some parts where the camera is extremely unsteady (like running with a handheld camera) and might give the viewer a headache or make them nauseous. Also, the story is a little bit off. Like, you never learn Foxface's name. This movie is about two hours long, and since this has another disc with AWESOME special features and it has UV (ultra-violet, it's for viewing movies on the go), this is a great deal for everybody!

I think the movie helps the warmth of the books fundamental characters but dosen't do justice to the gritty quality of life Katniss and friends were forced to endure. The lesser characters of the book aren't as prominent in the movie. IMHO the three books in this series do a much better job coloring stories (with characters) in that way. The movie does a good job at reloading your anxiety over governmental controls when applied to society as a whole. I watched this on Amazon Instant Video on a PC.,1352505600,,601,4.280701754385965

Even if I could get an app to place on my IPAD, IPHONE or Computer - it defeats the purpose.  You must have great internet access.  Well - my IPAD is wifi only - so when I am using it in an area without wifi, no possible way to watch that ""digital"" copy (there is someway to download - but if you read the fine print on their website, it is not exactly what they say it will be), I refuse to use up my data plan to stream a video I purchased for my phone, and when I visit my parents - because they live in a more rural area, they have to use a verizon data stick that does not stream well (which means that streaming videos pause and stop, as well as using up the data plan to the limit).  Stupid, stupid move.  As much as I loved this movie, I refuse to buy any video that has the Ultra Violet (which by the way for everyone who has ITunes - it does not work with it).  I am seeing this new Ultra Violet a lot now, and not at all happy with it.  Any production company that uses this instead of of a regular download or does not give a regular way to download that can play through Itunes will lose my business.

4947241,4,B0063FQREO,"The Hunger Games(released Mar/12)stars Jennifer Lawrence as Katniss Everdeen,Josh Hutcherson as Peeta Mellark,Liam Hemsworth as Gale Hawthorne,Woody Harrelson as Haymitch Abernathy,the mentor,Stanley Tucci as Caesar Flickerman,the show host,Donald Sutherland as President Coriolanus Snow and many others. It is a solid cast in an overly long movie that the film makers successfully pull you into at the beginning,but bog down in unnecessary detail during the actual games.
The story finds the country divided into districts,12 of them to be exact. After a bloody uprising over 75 years before,society has rebuilt a dystopian world for itself. Each district annually must bring forth two volunteers who compete in a life or death scenario;in an age group of 12-18 years. This is in payment/tribute for past sins while ensuring obedience for the future. The games are held in the capitol city and the farther away people travel to the games,the more impoverished their district is. Our protagonist is Katniss who comes from district 12. She lives a hand to mouth existence and when the call comes for people to register for the games,the scene is something out of a concentration camp.
This year Katniss's younger sister is picked but Katniss volunteers to take her place;a gutsy move. Katniss and another local lad are whisked into the capitol city aboard an opulently styled train,filled with food and other delights,none have ever seen before. This is two weeks before the actual games. During that time the two are assigned a mentor,appear on local TV and the more favour they garner,the more sponsors they can pick up. The sponsors can actually help them during the games. It is a whirlwind two weeks,much of it media geared,but at the end the games DO inevitably begin.
24 teens are thrust together in a forested area,with a cache of weapons and supplies within reach,but when the alarm sounds to begin Katniss rushes away from the cache to higher ground;advice she follows from her mentor. The cache soon becomes a killing ground and only half the number remain. Katniss is pursued relentlessly by a group,one of which is her friend from her district. When she is chased up a tree her pursuers wait her out. She spots a nest of tracker-jackers,genetically engineered wasps. She drops it on them and while one out of the group perishes,she is also stung. She comes down but is delirious. Her friend from her district tells her to run but she only goes so far before she collapses. A young girl from a different district helps her. They become fast friends and work together,until the girls untimely demise. Katniss eventually finds her friend from her district in a bad way and nurses him back to health. However the two have become close and the media plays it up as two star crossed lovers and even change the rules to allow two victors from the same district instead of one.
The games continue until finally the two friends and one of the favoured males from the first district come together on top of a weapons cache. Not only do they struggle against each other but there are four big and vicious cat-like creatures below waiting to feed. The district one male goes over and the two remain. Suddenly the rules are changed once more to allow only one victor. They agree to eat poison berries together,but before they do so,the rules are changed back. They have to have someone as a victor,and their deaths would have denied that;they must not let the public down.
The film ends as Katniss and her fellow district 12 friend,return home once more to a rousing reception.
The film,in the beginning,takes its time to show you the world you are about to enter and once it grabs you it keeps you;for a time. The absolute decadence of the capitol city compared to the desolate countryside and deprivation there is stark,to say the least. When the actual games begin,that is where this film bogs down. Too much detail and an overly long scenario takes place there. Judicious editing should have been the word of the day here. We also expect our heroine to be more assertive and powerful during the games,than she is. We soon come to realize that she is just as ordinary as anyone else,strong personality aside. And of course this is going against formula and that is perfectly alright,and I get that. However more than once she is saved from certain death by the most formulaic of circumstances;for example,she is about to be killed by another district female and she is in turn killed by the partner of the little girl she befriended who comes out of nowhere,as an altruistic gesture of thanks,or we have the actual killing of the little girl,as a sword flies through the air and should have hit Katniss,but hits the girl instead(bait and switch).That,of course,is bound to give our heroine the extra strength she needs to carry on;as formulaic as it comes. Despite these criticisms,the cast is strong and the plot,despite its obvious weak points,is still an interesting one overall.
Technically speaking the film is in its w/s a/r of 2:40:1 and is clear and crisp. There are no extras on the one disc DVD which I am reviewing here.
All in all an intriguing look at a future complete with death games,worked into its dystopian dynamic. The film moves along fine until too much attention to detail bogs the film down in what should be its most exciting moments. Unfortunate. 3 1/2-4 stars. It could/should have been better.",1352160000,,5423,4.87012987012987

4947251,3,B0063FQREO,"Heard the hype, like everyone else in the states, but wasn't too interested in it.  Haven't read the book, but finally caved a week or two ago... there's gotta be something to the talk, right?  Well, it turns out to be one of the most surprising movies.  Not because of superb acting, awesome visual effects, or extraordinary cameos (although I didn't expect Natural Born Killers dude to be in it).  It was surprising because of the unassuming, ""natural,"" nonchalant way with which the kids in the movies killed each other.  I understand that it is part and parcel of the world that the movie depicts, but I didn't expect it to be just so in a movie that seemed to be squarely marketed at young children.  If I were a parent, I would not want my child seeing this movie, unless they were 15+.

That aside, the movie isn't great, but the movie doesn't totally suck.",1352160000,,864,4.5
4947252,2,B0063FQREO,"If you read the series, you will likely hate the movie. If you didn't read the series, you probably won't get the movie.

I don't mind films taking liberties with plot points and such as long as they remain true to the essential thematic core of the novel they are adapted from. Blade Runner for example, deviates quite significantly from Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep and yet remains one of the greatest SF films of all time because it remains true to the novel's bleak view of our planet and its thematic question -- Who is more human, the humans or the androids? The elimination of Deckard's wife, the almost complete disappearance of Mercerism change the story significantly, but do not alter it conceptually.

This movie fails miserably in portraying the true pathos of The Hunger Games. So many key thematic elements are dropped or left unexplained to the non-reader that there is no way you can get to the story's true meaning without having read the series. And if you have read the series, then you will be mystified by the way they gloss over the true meaning of the Mockingjay, the impetus behind the scenes in the cave, and much more. Replacing District 11's tribute to Katniss (the care package) with a simple salute and a riot (which belongs in the second book) takes away one of the most important thematic events in the tale and twists it into something completely different.

The key here is supposed to be how Katniss's simple acts of heroism and respect for her fellow human beings bring about a complete change in the people viewing them -- how they change from fans of a sporting event to admirers of her nobility. How they begin to view their own actions in light of hers. It never happens. The film reduces it all to a struggle for power

Don't even get me started on the casting of Woody Harrelson, or the incredibly lame manner in which they handled Cinna's costumes...

Very disappointing.",1352160000,,1921,4.654867256637168

The way the actors portray their desperation, anger, fear, and love is vivid and well done.  However, this is assuming you read the book, because otherwise you will miss out on some of the best parts of the film that are not explained entirely.  That having been said, these are only a few scenes out of the entire movie, and are not critical to understand the plot of the entire movie.

4947263,2,B0063FQREO,"Let me start off by saying that I haven't read the original books by Suzanne Collins. I would also rather not repeat the synopsis in detail here because so many reviewers have done that, with more than 2,500 reviews posted at the time of writing this. Already a huge commercial hit (more than 400 million dollars in US alone), ""The Hunger Games"" has garnered mostly positive reviews from critics. But is the film really worth that?

If you looking for something entertaining, this is not the one you should choose. I almost forgot to say that this is a film by Lionsgate, a company responsible for the ""Saw"" franchise. You don't see much blood in ""The Hunger Games,"" but still watching kids killing each other is hardly entertainment, even though in the film's story it is done for the enjoyment of the rich. (Anyway, the shaky and fast-cut camera of ""The Hunger Games"" would not allow you to ""enjoy"" watching the deadly ""game."")

The heroine Katniss Everdeen is effectively played by Jennifer Lawrence. Katniss volunteers to join the game instead of her younger sister. Strangely, while the rich citizens seem to be enjoying the game so much, some even becoming the financial supporters of their favorite participants, I couldn't understand why these people are so excited about the game itself. Now I'm not talking about moral dilemma or something like that. I'm talking about how dull and even pointless the game sequence is.

For our heroine Katniss is being given an advantageous position with regard to the game. Her ""mentor"" Haymitch Abernathy (Woody Harrelson), at first drunk, turns out a decent teacher giving her some good advice. Her costume designer Cinna (Lenny Kravitz) is a nice person, who can help her get the ""sponsors."" Even some of the game's contestants help her survive, while they should be killing her. If luck is the key to survival, the director has surely made the point.

You may call the film a social satire. Any dystopian story could be one, if only developed into a more biting commentary on society or humanity, which ""The Hunger Games,"" tame and shallow, is simply not. Even if you have not seen ""The Truman Show,"" ""Battle Royale"" or ""The Running Man"" - films made by the people who know what they are doing - you will notice something is not quite right with the story. In short, ""The Hunger Games"" doesn't convince as survival drama, social satire or love story.",1351987200,,2399,4.801452784503632
4947264,5,B0063FQREO,"Of course, the books are irreplaceable. But this movie was about as close as I could have hoped in conveying the feeling of the first book. I am much looking forward to seeing how well they do with the other two.",1351987200,,212,4.195121951219512

It is an enjoyable movie with a subtle social commentary I think most young viewers might not even pick up on.  The story of a young woman forced by her government to participate in a fight to the death with 23 other teenagers at a publicly televised arena for all of the nation to see.  It has drama and action, an unlikely love story in the midst of the chaos and death. Who will prevail...who will get the girl?

4947301,5,B0063FQREO,"The first two books of Suzanne Collins' trilogy - Hunger Games and Catching Fire - were some of my favorite reading in a long while.  Mockingjay - the third book in the trilogy - I had issues with.  But to get back to HUNGER GAMES, the movie - great adaptation of the novel, one of the best adaptations I've seen.

Was every detail there?  No.  Not possible in a movie that runs 142 minutes.  But the details that were there were true to the book.

Panem (the parts we see) and the Capitol are portrayed very well.  I felt like I was really seeing the poverty-stricken districts, such as District #12, where the main characters (Katniss and Peeta) come from.  And the contrast between the districts and the luxurious Capitol is striking, just as in the book.

Casting was spot on.  Jennifer Lawrence as Katniss Everdeen is perfect in the role.  Josh Hutcherson as Peeta Mellark is great, although I thought he was a bit more macho in the movie than the novel version.  Liam Hemsworth as Gale Hawthorne does a good job, although we don't see him much in this part one movie. I didn't think I was going to like Woody Harrelson as Haymitch Abernathy but he surprised me and I thought he did a spectacular job.

Tyranny, oppression, the haves and the have-nots - all are seen in this movie of a dystopian future. Do yourself a favor and watch it.

NOTE:  This is a movie about a death match between 24 young participants.  So, yes, there is violence in this movie.  Be forewarned and reconsider allowing younger children to see it.",1351555200,,1527,4.490909090909091

4947303,5,B0063FQREO,"I really enjoy the HD quality of my Kindle Fire. As the streaming quality is not quite stabilized yet, I like to download / buy my favorite films when it's worth it. Hunger Games is definitely one of those films that I'd like to view over and over. I'm amazed at the relevance and quality of the selection that the Kindle Fire offers. The films are new and ecclectic, differ from the Netflix offerings and I appreciate their innovation of also opting films still in cinemas available for home viewing.

Hunger Games is a film that is full of heart, defiance against Big Brother, and full of surprising turns. It is one of the most innovative film adaptations from a book that treads that line of major motion picture with eye catching CGI, but also keeps good characters and actors challenged.

Also, I am addicted to the X-Ray layer while watching. I appreciate the seamless way of referencing the work directly without having to open another browser or stop my film. It's a great way to use a tablet, the touch screen, as well as allow control over when it comes on when I want it.

The cost of renting a film is a bit costly, when in comparison with a subscription... so I'm taking advantage of my Prime membership that comes with the Kindle Fire. Maybe Amazon can bring the cost down once more folks buy these!",1351555200,,1314,4.512605042016807

4947318,3,B0063FQREO,"Considering the fact that I watch a lot of crime movies and I am completely obsessed with Law and Order Svu I was suprised and how much the violence in this movie bothered me. Yes I understand that in the ratings it does that it is violent and that it contains disturbing images however I never thought in a million years I would be witnessing a scene in which a bunch of young teens would be taking their knives out and slashing eachother to death just to survive in this game. I guess its my own fault for watching the movie and not reading the book first however I believe that it should be rated R. That image will forever be in my mind. I wanted to literally run out of the theatre and never go back because I found that scene so stomach turning and awful. I understand that the point of the movie is to show what a horrible game these poor kids are forced to play are but still did we really need a scene that graphic. Now let me clarify again that I am not one who gets queezy over violence easily, I have scene Scream, Halloween and many other horrifically violent movies but somehow this one disturbed me. I really give it up for the people who made this movie possible because such a scene like that left an impact on me and probably other people and really made us see the horrible society these people are in. I really do believe that this is a great movie just too violent for me though. I may consider seeing the second one when it comes out because I hear its less violent. So even though I didn't like the violence I am giving this movie a rating of three stars because they really did a good job at creating an impact on the audience.",1351382400,,1651,4.19496855345912

Diehard readers might get bummed about missing a couple specific scenes and some changes at the end however the impact and quality of the movie is very similar to the book. Minor details might change but the feel of the story remains the same. Also includes some interesting extras in the special features, my favorite is Jennifer Lawrence missing the explosion- so funny, her pout afterwards is priceless.

The film is well paced, telling the story of a cynical, dystopian world where the deaths of youth are used yearly for entertainment.

Streaming it though (via Amazon) is another issue.  I can't say who the problem lies with and/or who to blame but streaming HD content via my High speed (broadband through my Cable company internet provider) connection was not all that good.  The movie hung up numerous times through the movie and that is quite a bother.  Again, I don't know if it is my cable companies fault (Comcast cable - paying for 20 Mbps download speed) or if it is due to issues at Amazon.

Cons: The special effects have room for improvement",1350777600,,127,5.35
4947349,5,B0063FQREO,"ok, so i was really exited to see this film... i read harry potter once. my biggest dissapointment was roo... i mean cmon. the actor was about 12 and a half years too young. i was also very disappointed in the severe lack of sexual content. i mean the matrix had a full on sideways sex scene that this movie could have really used. but hey im not mormon so idk.

i never actually read the books but i really feel that the movie should have been more like the cover. some movies arnt like that, and its very sad to me.

as far as the actual plot... roo really needed some more screen time, as well as other charecters needing a lot more development. there really needed to be more time spent on plot development. i really wanted to know more about this world... i mean i don't even know wjat planet this was supposed to be. im guessing neptune because its blue.

I digress, my only other complaint was that the movie was very slow... i mean talk talk talk. i really wanted to see some killing. this movie was suppsed to be about the hunger games but they only seemed to be hungry in district 12. and we spent like HALF the movie there, and the other half was spent in ballrooms and bullet trains. it needed to be more like the expendables... it just dragged on

to sum it up... no development, no plot, very little (if any) sexual content, and little to no action. i give it a 9/10

i like books...",1350777600,,1397,4.217228464419476

I found the character build to be very shallow and I just couldn't relate or empathize with characters.  So, a week later I decided to read the book and ah ha:-) , this is where you get to know them.  I enjoyed the book so much, that I bought and read the other two as well, because I just couldn't wait to find out what happened in the end.  I went back and watched the movie again, understanding and relating to the characters and their situation and it was so much better.  I eagerly wait for the next movie to come out.  4 stars because people who haven't read the book, won't enjoy the movie as much.

this movie has raised the interest in archery in the USA, and probably
around the world.
Both the movie and the book have a great story behind it, and although
it is a trilogy, it does not give you that feeling at the end.
The brutality of the book is covered as best as possible in the film
(I guess to make it PG13).
Still, it is a good movie to watch, and since it is going to be the

I loved seeing the movie in the theater but found that some of the shaky scenes were hard to watch (the camera movement was very wobbly). Watching it on our large screen at home, that issue was gone.

The extras on the bonus disc are a little lacking. Lots of mundane chat and not a ton of substance.

The ultra violet version is worthless to me on satellite internet since I can't download large files. Maybe some day.

A recommended purchase if you didn't see the movie when it came out and if you did see it, still recommended if you enjoyed it. It is not all about children killing children.

I was a little surprised how long it took to get to the game portion of the film, but it was time well spend. After the games began, the tension ratcheted up several notches.

The only thing I didn't care for were the conveniently-placed voice-overs that changed the rules of the game at just the right/wrong time. I would have thought the director could have done better, but then again, the director is Gary Ross, who's one of the best, so I'm assuming he did the best he could.

4947393,4,B0063FQREO,"So I normally don't enjoy movies based on books that I've read, but this movie is definitely an exception.  I've read the entire Hunger Games series, more than once (Yes, I'm a total dork) and loved them, so I had to at least check out the movie.

If I hadn't read the books, I'm actually not sure I would have enjoyed the movie as well as I did.  There was a lot of internal dialogue in the book that was left up to the imagination in the movie, which is par for the course when translating a book to film.  Also, having read the books, I was already emotionally invested in the characters.  The movie didn't really make me more invested, but seemed to rely on the assumption that I already was.  That's actually why I only gave the movie 4 stars instead of 5...because it seemed like the filmmakers were working on the assumption that viewers had read the books.

That said, even if you haven't read the books, this movie is still worth watching.  The acting was pretty good, the cast was awesome (seriously, Lenny Kravitz as Cinna?! Love!)and it's a moving story.  Definitely worth checking out.  Oh, and read the books.  Seriously :)",1350000000,,1137,4.470873786407767

4947397,4,B0063FQREO,One of the most enjoyable films that I've seen in quite awhile. Kept my attention. I didn't fall asleep with this one. I didn't read the books so I had no idea how the movie would end. I'd call it bittersweet.,1349913600,,209,4.121951219512195

4947399,2,B0063FQREO,"For some reason, I have noticed that Amazon streaming (I have a Roku) is slower and sometimes just stops.  Netflix does not have this problem.  And neither does Hulu.

Otherwise, the movie selection is pretty good (thought I have found movies and TV shows that cost me on Amazon for free on Hulu and/or Netflix) but there are newer ones sometimes that I can pay a small amount and watch on Amazon, which is nice.

I also have recently gotten onto Vudu and Epix and at times their movie selection is bigger.  But, I must say, the Price membership is still worth it because of all of the other benefits that one gets (free shipping and so on).

I forgot to mention the movie.  I loved the books, and, as usual, the movies are usually not as good.  There were a few things left out, but how can one make a movie exactly like the book; almost impossible, books will always have more details so when I read a book and then see the movie, I am prepared for that.  That said, I really did enjoy the acting.

Though, I must say, I was disappointed that Josh Hutcheson was Peeta - I felt Chris Hemsworth was a better choice and that the roles should have been switched. But whatever, they were all very good actors and I couldn't have asked for more.

MUCH better than the Twilight series movies; I will be seeing the rest of The Hunger Games movies when they come out, but the Twilight series lacked good actors and totally ruined the books.  The Hunger Games did very well. I really enjoyed the Twilight books and despised the movies (they should have, in my opinion, picked people who could act).  But I am just speaking for the first movie in that series, never did see the others. IMO.

As for The Hunger Games, Jennifer Lawrence was awesome, as was Donald Sutherland, Elizabeth Banks, Woody Harrelson, etc.  Great cast choice (people who have actual acting abilites) makes for a way better movie! But, this is all just in my opinion.",1349913600,,1930,4.443181818181818

Well, I was pleasantly suprised.  I was only able to watch the first half, then had to eat dinner.  I found that I wanted to go back and watch the rest of the movie right after dinner.

After having read the actual book, it felt like I was watching the Cliff Notes video version.  Empty, quick, clipped...without much of the flesh of the novel that brought you to care what happened in the story any more than a few pretty faces and familiar actors can.

That happens, especially this last decade or two (corny or not, at least 80's movies put a lot of effort into character and plot development).  It wasn't a bad movie, but it wasn't amazing either.

The whole underlying of the film is teens killing eachother to survive in the annual hunger games, which keeps all the districts in check.  I hope that it isn't a spoiler because that is the main point of the story :) Jennifer Lawrence does an absolute amazing job of taking the main lead Katniss and bringing out her strong points.  Katniss has had to be strong to support her family, and that is represented really well.  Then you add a great supporting cast that adds depth to the movie.  But a lot of the time, the relationships that are formed seemed rushed because with a movie like this, you don't have much time to build relationships.  However, acting aside, the story is good, teens enjoy it, adults enjoy it and even elderly people like it.  But if you havne't seen the movie and want to get more out of he experience, read the book!  And if you would rather just watch the movie, just remember, its good for what it is, and its only part 1 of what will now have 3 more movies following it, and it only gets better from here!",1349740800,,1206,4.258771929824562

That way they wouldn't have had to leave most of the plot, and great acting, on the cutting room floor. Two movies, each at least two hours long, would have helped the actors to put the plot together.

My kids really liked this movie, they had read the book before hand and only complained slightly about the differences.

The essence of each character was excellently captured by the actors and particularly loved how Peeta's role was acted. The movie portrayed the absolute dreadfulness and disbelief of children fighting each other for the whims of some and to the dismay of many. Music and sound was very appropriate and loved the music for the Tributes entrance in their chariots. Costumes, locations and Panem were fantastic.  While the detail of a book is difficult to reproduce, in the movie, there was an adequate balance of enough detail to stay to the writer's intent and keep the story moving along. For me, it was a joy to see such a vivid enactment of the book. All of the various parts worked brilliantly together for a truly enjoyable movie.

4947449,3,B0063FQREO,"The movie is a slowed down version of the book and lacks the emotional impact of the novel. The movie plot pretty much follows the book. However, one most realize that the movie is primarily targeted for a young audience and, for this audience; the movie will be a big success. Jennifer Lawrence is strong and convincing in the central role and young women will love her (in fact, a lot of young male viewers will also love her!). My main complaint is the lack of character development for the contestants in the games. The game contestants are given no personality and when they are killed, who cares? It is like inanimate objects being killed. Another aspect of the movie is the shaky camera work. In order to obtain a PG rating, a shaky-cam approach is used for the violent action scenes. This renders the most violent scenes without emotional impact and certainly leaves the movie viewer feeling detached from the action.
If you are young, you will love this movie. For adults who have read and loved the book, the movie is worth seeing. But do not expect the same emotional impact. For adults who have not read to book (if there are any!), don't waste your time on the movie.",1349568000,,1180,4.570754716981132

So after dinner and the kids going to bed (this movie is not for the 7 year old crowd!) my husband and I sat down and watched it. We really enjoyed the movie - though there were a few moments in the streaming version that we were not able to understand what was being said. Watching through our tv bypasses our receiver and has only basic stereo speakers. We are not sure if that was the reason or if it was a streaming hiccup. There was also one moment where the picture pixelated a bit, but only one. Watching the Bluray once it arrived provided the richness of audio that I love and I was able to understand everything said. I also heard things that I didn't even hear before (like twigs breaking, the roar of a fire, etc.). We really enjoyed the movie. For streaming I would recommend that you are able to have 5.1 audio at least and a really strong/consistent internet connection. For Bluray, you still need at least 5.1 audio.

4947456,5,B0063FQREO,"I've reviewed the insanely popular book The Hunger Games in both written and video form. The video review still continues to be one of the most viewed on YouTube and is one of my most viewed videos. That just says something about how a story can have so much of an impact. The film version of the first book of the series was sure to be a success with an already astounding fan base, so I was quite eager to check it out. Luckily, I was able to get press access to an early screening of this one (yay me!), which made it all the more exciting.

The film is directed by Gary Ross, which was a surprising choice for me. He's most known for films like Seabiscuit and Pleasantville, so I was unsure how he'd handle such an over-the-top production that the material called for. He ended up being a fine choice however, as the book's fantastical futuristic and post-apocalyptic world was translated perfectly onto the screen. The writing is also done by Ross, with the book's author Suzanne Collins and Billy Ray contributing to the screenplay. The follows very closely to the book, which was certainly a wise choice in order to not upset the already huge group of book fans that were guaranteed to purchase a ticket.

The Hunger Games follows 12 districts which formerly made up North America, now known as Panem. Panem is run by a totalitarian government known as the Capitol. Each year the Capitol reminds the citizens of their control by holding the Hunger Games, a fight-to-the-death survival competition featuring a boy and girl chosen at random from each district. The concept may sound similar, as the idea has been done in many other books and movies, however The Hunger Games still does manage to be unique enough to hold its own. There have been constant comparisons to other certain titles, however I find such comparisons pointless as the characters and world Collins created are original and interesting.

The story centers on 16 year old Katniss Everdeen (Jennifer Lawrence) of the rustic and impoverished District 12. During the Reaping, or selection ceremony for the tributes that will represent the district in the games, Katniss' younger sister Prim (Willow Shields) gets chosen. Without a second thought, Katniss throws herself forward and volunteers to take Prim's place. The boy chosen is Peeta Mellark (Josh Hutcherson), and shortly after the two head towards the Capitol for their training where they are introduced to a world unlike anything they have seen in their village.

The Capitol was where most of my worries about the film adaptation existed. The futuristic world called for technology that doesn't exist and wild clothing and hairdos (and skindos), which I wasn't sure if they'd be able to match my imagination's interpretation. However I was pleasantly surprised at the film's ability to capture the book's descriptions nearly perfectly. Not that I deny the ability of the talented individuals that have churned out some breathtaking effects and designs over the past several years, but it's tough I think for a film to match what most people picture when reading the book. In this case, I think they nailed it.

Once the games actually kick off, the excitement doesn't let up. For fans of survival adventure movies such as myself, the film is a treat. There's an excellent display of survival techniques and tactical scenarios. While the film does don a PG-13 rating, there is also a surprising amount of violence involved. The story, after all, does involve kids killing kids, but the film is impressively able to pull of some of the more gruesome scenes without exploiting the gore and carnage. The action scenes are adrenaline-filled, which is good but could also give some viewers motion sickness. The camera work is fast, moving right along at the pace of the action. I liked the style at times, but the shaky cam also did hinder the detail of some of the combat scenes.

The pacing of the film also works both in favor of and against the movie. At over 2 hours long, it feels much shorter. Because of this, however, many scenes that in the book were very emotional and significant seemed very much rushed past in the film, placing more attention to the action. I understand there's a lot of ground to cover with the story, and in order to keep it to one part they had to do a bit of cramming, but a few pivotal scenes were either ignored or barely touched on which was a disappointment.

Being highly impressed with Lawrence in Winter's Bone, I knew she would tackle the role of Katniss with ease and she certainly did. I'm not usually too impressed with Josh Hutcherson, but I felt he did well as Peeta. The rest of the cast was just perfect, from Woody Harrelson as the drunken mentor Haymitch, to the always impressive Stanley Tucci as Caesar Flickerman. The colorful characters were represented well, and I felt like the actors really brought each one to life.

The film overall is a great example of a book adaptation done well. There may have been a few things I would have liked to have seen, but it captures a huge amount of detail in a relatively short time that seems to go by without notice. With the Games' impressive arena, full of manipulated nature and engineered animals, combined with a perfect cast and action that never lets up once it gets started, I can imagine without having read the book there really wouldn't be a lot to be unimpressed with. While the books may be popular with the female teen audience, due to its empowering heroine, this is a matured teen survival adventure flick that adults of both sexes can enjoy.

4947484,3,B0063FQREO,"Oscar better start polishing a statuette for Jennifer Lawrence...not necessarily for THE HUNGER GAMES but her time will come.  It is Ms. Lawrence's sharply etched and impassioned performance as Katness that provides the heart and soul of this film.
Set in a futuristic society known as Panem, the plot revolves around a basically inane contest that endorses and applauds the slaughter of young people by other young people.  Of course, several political ""messages"" are thrown in, with a requisite love story to appeal to the TWILIGHT/HARRY POTTER fanatics.
The movie's supporting cast boasts Donald Sutherland, Stanley Tucci, Wes Bentley, Lenny Kravitz and Elizabeth Banks (what's with Tucci  and Bentley's ridiculous hair styles?).  Josh Hutcherson exudes the requisite third wheel presence but Liam Hemsworth is basically wasted as Lawrence's initial love interest.  Taylor Swift's song over the closing credits is abysmal.

I didn't expect much from the movie, didn't read the book, assumed the story was oriented towards kids, and watched it only because the family wanted to.  Well, what a surprise!

Through superb acting and perfect blending of all the elements of movies, we're told a rather chilling story which portrays how inhumane and capricious totalitarian power can be, thus strongly reminiscent of Orwell's '1984'.  The ending isn't quite as bleak as '1984' because, through tenacity and cleverness of two of the lead characters, a bit of sand is at least thrown in the eyes of the powers that be, showing that their power isn't absolutely absolute.  But it's close enough to being absolute, and exercised in a way that I found very disturbing at both subtle and obvious levels.

Overall, one of the best conceived and crafted movies I've ever seen.  I highly recommend it, though I would say it best suits adults rather than kids, and thinking/sensitive adults at that.",1349136000,,1120,4.802083333333333
4947497,5,B0063FQREO,"First of all, Jennifer Lawrence (Winter's Bone) was the perfect choice to put Katniss Everdeen on the screen.  Josh Hutcherson (The Bridge to Tarabithia), was also an excellent choice as Peeta Mellark.  The film does what a good adaptation to a novel does: re-interpret it as needed to the much different medium.  The book (I have read all three) is first-person narrative, so we always know what is going on in Katniss' head.  Obviously that cannot be transferred to the screen other than by the actor's expressions and words.  And that is done immaculately by Ms. Lawrence.  Lawrence's background has been in the indies, the form she prefers she says, but showed her acting chops in a big Hollywood movie as well.  My suggestion to those who have read the book(s): watch it as a movie, not looking out for things left out or added in.  Suzanne Collins gave the screenwriter and director, Gary Ross (Pleasantville, Big, as screenwriter) wide latitude in creating the vision.  Ross obviously succeeded.  Watching it now on DVD made me love it even more than when I saw it at the cinema.  For all of those who are hesitant to see a movie of, basically, children killing children, please know that it is not shot gruesomely (with one exception), emphasizing this type of violence.  The fight scenes at the cornucopia are handled in a way that it almost seems like a blurr, for instance.  Also, it is clear that this is not to glorify violence as in an action thriller, but to show the calumnity and viciousness of the Capitol and its President, played chillingly by the great Donald Sutherland (Kiefer's dad for you under 30).

4947501,5,B0063FQREO,"I would not interpret this film as a morality tale or a love story. The film is a metaphor of how superficial means of appeasement (""Hunger Games"") might be applied to a society which had been divided and had broken down. It's impressive how well they filmed a bleak mining town of the future -- where the heroine Katniss lived. It reminded me some Soviet ""dystopian fictions"" of the 1920s and 1930s. The dystopian ""future"" where society held together by ""bread and circuses"" is reminiscent of Rome in decline -- yes -- but also of the Soviet Union on the 1930s where society ""hanged together"" by the Statin's ""Show trials"". But wait, is it possible in America? The possibility of civil breakdown is probably more real than we care to think. We do not need nuclear warfare to cause a breakdown. You take a large city like New York - its water supply comes from hundreds of miles away and any interruption of that, or food, or power, or cell phone, or computer networks for a period of time will cause probably breakdown of order. Our society is so fragile, so dependent on the interworking of things to provide us with the goods and services that you don't need nuclear warfare to fragment us anymore than the Romans needed it to cause their eventual downfall.

I haven't read the books, but my wife indicated that there are a number of character changes, and that some rather important items from the first book are left out.  We also wonder how they will be able to stretch out the last two books into three movies.

The movie is about a girl named Katniss (duh), her sister was picked for the annual Hunger Games; a fight to the death. Katniss, isn't going to have it so she volunteers to take her place, then the movie starts. I did not enjoy the movie as much as the book, but it was enjoyable.",1348876800,,462,4.202247191011236

That is until you leave the drama and the action and arrive at the romance... which is incredibly awkward the whole way through. But I believe that was the intention. All in all, the bonus features do take this purchase even further with things that supplement the film as well as take you behind the scenes. The best part of this particular Hunger Games is it rewards you for ordering it online because you can watch it as soon as you'd like. No waste of gas, no waiting for it in the mail, no overpriced rental. Its right there, lickety split.

I am a mom, after all. I did eventually go see the movie with my teenager and I was very pleasantly surprised. The movie did have its tense moments but there was nothing gratuitous about it. I felt that everything depicted was very appropriate for the PG-13 rating that the movie received. That said, when the movie came out on blu ray, I was happy to purchase it. The package included a digital copy of the movie, which I always love to have.",1348876800,,617,4.282051282051282

Give it a try with an open mind, I think the director and the writers have done a terrific job here.

Having said that, The Blu-ray format it's just great, it has a very good quality! I live in Mexico and I had to return the ""Mexican Blu-ray disc"" because it was in 16:9 aspect ratio, not in it's original format... that's a shame, is like selling fake HD. So I had to buy the US version of the disc to get the original format and quality, and it also comes with a digital download which is great for iTunes or Vudu users.",1348876800,,766,4.006535947712418

4947524,4,B0063FQREO,"While the movie couldn't match the scope of the book, and what movie ever does, this adaptation wasn't as bad as some reviewers offer. One of the things that throws some viewers is that this is a third person omniscient take on a novel told in the first person singular.
I appreciated the actors--Peeta, Rue and the district rep were perfect, I enjoyed Lenny Kravitz as Cinna, and although Woody Harrelson looked too healthy to be Hamish his acting was spot on. Katniss; the actress who played her was picture perfect, but after reading through all the books twice and watching this over twice, I realize the character of Katniss is not sympathetic, she is self-centered and selfish in the extreme, and is so focused on being a martyr, that she never realizes that a) she's being played for a fool, and b) she was being protected, and c) she is an extremely poor judge of character and intent of those around her.
It's her story though, and the movie manages to get the most salient points across.",1348876800,,997,4.606741573033708
4947525,5,B0063FQREO,"I am one of those who was introduced to the ""Hunger Games Trilogy"" by the movie. I had not read or even heard of the books until I watched the movie. I had heard such a wide range of opinions about the movie that I was very curious to watch it myself and see what all the discussion was about.

I rented the movie and watched it for the first time and had somewhat mixed reactions to it; the problem was it wouldn't let go of my mind and I kept thinking about it and decided to watch it again. After the second viewing I was hooked and decided to buy the three books and find out what was going to happen to Katniss and the others.

My curiosity having gotten the better of me I started with book 2, ""Catching Fire"" and then followed that up with book 3, ""Mockingjay"" and lastly went back and read book 1, ""The Hunger Games."" Having seen the movie first gave me mental pictures of the characters and eliminated the need to create the characters in my mind's eye from the pages of the books.

This may have worked to my advantage as after reading ""The Hunger Games"" I was favorably impressed with the movies handling of the story. I ordered this Blu-ray edition and have now watched it several times and found it an effective telling of the story of book 1.

The major thrust of the books and the movie is bravery and determination in the face of a totalitarian dictatorship that uses the Hunger Games as a control device. This future government of Panem, an area now known as North America, uses military force to terrorize and intimidate the majority of the people who are viewed as essentially slaves to the privileged class who enjoy the favor of the dictator and live in ""The Capitol.""

After reading ""The Hunger Games"" I was very impressed with the casting for the movie; the actors selected seemed perfect for their roles with subtle nuances of character being brought out in the acting. I'm really glad I saw the movie first.

While there are some sadly brutal scenes in the movie those things being represented are all things that have happened in societies both in the past and in the present. The movie does not pull its punches when describing man's inhumanity to man; things we see on the news today and then naively think ""that can never happen here.""

It is a warning against allowing any central authority to gain and use power arbitrarily. The old saying ""power corrupts, and absolute power corrupts absolutely"" is still alive and well in the United States in the 21st century. This is a cautionary tale for us and our times and we would be well advised to heed its message!",1348876800,,2590,4.451476793248945

4947528,3,B0063FQREO,"I both read the book and watched the movie. I wasn't really impressed by either to be honest. Katniss seems selfish and whiny to me. I know everyone seemed to have hunger games fever, but I'm just not sold. Overall I thought it was ok.",1348876800,,235,4.2444444444444445

4947540,2,B0063FQREO,"Having not read any of the books, I watched this film with an open mind, when I heard Jennifer Lawrence was in it. She is one of our greatest new actors. I was sadly disappointed. Hardly any back story to set up the reason for the games. No character development for the 24 contestants. Peetas' hair style changes 8 times in the first half hour. So much for continuity. And the hand held camera movements during the battles, were done intentionally, to keep the bloodless battles PG13. An obvious ploy to garner the kid market. 'Battle Royale', a violent Japanese flick that came out about 10 years ago, had the same premise, so the idea is certainly not new. Whatever reasons for the hunger games, is just not translated in the film. Hence, we don't feel very much for the characters. Although Jennifer Lawrence gives it her all in a good performance, most of the other characters are quite laughable. Peeta is portrayed as a whiny wuss. It is difficult to transcribe any novel into a film, but it would have been interesting, to have seen this movie directed, lets say, by the late Tony Scott. I am sure we would have had quite a different vision. I would pass on this film. Although, I am now interested in reading the novel. For sheer entertainment, and to watch a great artist at work, please witness Jennifer Lawrence's performance in WINTERS BONE.",1348790400,,1354,4.622406639004149

Though it followed the plot of the story well, the direction leaves a little to be desired. I found it annoying that the director focused on symbols, like clasped hands, when I, as the viewer, was more interested in the action.  It often felt as though the movie kept stopping to make a point that was obvious.

In my opinion, Jennifer Lawrence was perfect as Katniss Everdeen. Perfect. I also found the costumes and makeup to be excellent and in keeping with the mood and flavor of the story and very instrumental in demonstrating the disparity between the Capitol and the districts. I'll look forward to the next film hoping that I can view it through the eyes of a different director.",1348531200,,797,4.520833333333333

4947582,5,B0063FQREO,"This story is by far the best story line I have read in a long time.  I have this book in audible version as well as in hard cover, kindle edition and now motion picture. On the audible version of the final book, Suzanne Collins has a short interview in which she states the premiss of her book. Collins mentions that she had gotten the idea from the story of Theseus. It has been a long time since the last mythology class I had taken so I had to polish up my memories of the story. There is very much the same qualities that The Hunger Games possesses that goes along with that old tale. Children were sacrificed by being made to wander in the Minotaur's labyrinth to be killed, this was the entertainment to those who gathered the children, just like the Capitol in The Hunger Games. It really bothers me when people won't give this story a chance because they automatically think that this is a sick twisted story of children killing children. Yes, that is part of the story, but the children are pretty much forced to kill each other until a young girl who has the courage to stand up to the creators of the games and help society turn things around for the better. There is so much in this story and the one thing I feel we should all take from it is that a rebellion or change can't happen by just one person but with many people. Just like there are things in the news that we watch and/or read about, if we don't act together we can't make a difference in the world we live in. I recommend this movie and the book(s) from which it was adapted. Watch and read with open eye and don't judge a book by its cover. If you don't open yourself up to something new you are only hurting yourself. Don't be afraid to try something new.",1348444800,,1734,4.238670694864048

This is always a precarious place to be, fraught with the danger of disappointment. I really fully enjoyed the movie and thought that necessary distillations of various scenes for the sake of time were well handled. The futility the population outside the city feels is nicely captured by the lighting and muted color used; and then the change of texture and sensation upon arrival in the Capitol is a glaring juxtaposition. The excesses of wealth and hardness alluding to those of ancient Rome can't be missed. Overall this movie sets up the sequels very solidly, and I look forward to seeing them.",1348444800,,730,4.943089430894309

Hunger Games did a good job of being true to the story while reducing the potential gore - I really liked that.  I also think the cast did a great job of bringing their characters to life.

The extras are educational and give a lot of insight about what the producers and director process was, but where was the fun?  Where was the commentary with the actors, the blooper real, the challenges?  This might seem like I'm focusing on fluff.

Nonetheless I forced myself to ""get into it"" and enjoyed the book adequately enough.  But because of the restrictions forced by a movie of about two hours, hardly any book can be presented on screen in its entirety.  And, in the case of Hunger Games, that restriction is fatal.  Too much like using a cartoon strip to depict War and Peace.  So if you stay away from the book, maybe the movie is passable (for example, I loved Avatar).

The character Peeta was also just a weak shadow of the character in the book. I know you can't have everything that you want, but the least that you could have done is have them to portray the characters as strongly as they could have. They were fighting for their lives. These people on the screen were acting and you could tell they were acting. Something that really ticked me off was the fact that they hid her token from her district until the end of the movie. They didn't even make it a token from her district. It was actually the most important ""image"" from the book and they made it a hidden agenda. It was the image that made Rue know that she could trust Katniss. It was the image that became the spark of the revolution.

Update:  I did purchase the movie and found not only the hated ultraviolet download, but also the ability to download the movie into iTunes.  This is greatly appreciated.

Although the movie was still not as good as the book, it did touch on all the main points and gave one a convoluted idea of what it's all about.

(Please note that I'm NOT saying actors should crash diet to look like they're starving, it's just that I especially pictured them a little more wiry and roughened in physique.) I didn't see Jennifer Lawrence as our Katniss at all.

I blocked all these preconceptions and looked at the movie on its own, and it IS a good movie -- I enjoyed it! The acting is great and all the major plot points are there. Josh Hutcherson as Peeta turned out an especially good performance. The movie has a more artistic edge than the book and draws you in quickly.

This movie appeals to me because
1. it convincingly portrays the plight of the poor [always touches a chord with me, coming from poor upbringings myself],
2. it illustrates the obliviousness of the ""out of touch"" privileged who feel that the poor should be PROUD to have their lives treated like the playtoys of the 1%, and
3. it covers believable [though I admit I'm not certain if AUTHENTIC] survival skills that level the playing field, as it were, in class warfare--Katniss wins because she has a greater desperation to survive than those from the upper districts who treat life-or-death as just another silly game and don't know what it's like to truly have to fight for one's life.

This movie repulses me because
1. it glazes over the seriousness of the consequences of having a government in power that SANCTIONS MAKING ITS CITIZENS KILL EACH OTHER [though by the time the movie is established, the country has been crushed under an iron fist to such a point of general complacency that it's unfathomable that any of the repressed could have ever allowed it to persist for SEVENTY-FOUR YEARS],
2. the overall setting seemed rather understated for the future-based society they presented--I was underwhelmed both by the Capitol and every special effect used with exception of the Games control room, but mostly
3. it uses ALL THE SHAKY CAM.

Don't get me wrong--the atrocity that is shaky cam is used to good effect, for instance, at the Cornucopia to suggest BUT NOT SHOW the gore of the initial Tribute deaths. However, I became quickly aggravated not five minutes into the movie when Prim wakes from a nightmare and SHAKY CAM EVERYWHERE. Where is your tripod, Camera Dude?? What is it about these still moments inside houses and other buildings that merits the jitter that gives me a headache in prolonged sequences? It's little touches like these that make what's supposed to be a blockbuster movie instead look cheaply-made, as though by a film student. Ten minutes in I was genuinely wondering if I was watching the same movie that did so well on its opening weekend, because I just wasn't feeling it.

Overall, this is what I think doesn't work [***SPOILERS***]:
- The story doesn't begin until the Hunger Games start--there is so much haphazard effort put into world-building that Collins forgets to actually tell a story, something only somewhat alleviated in the movie with the propaganda film and the initial pre-game interview. Yes, there are things that are presumably important for exposition, but they are so drawn out as to read like a teenager's summer camp journal. Yes, the Reaping was a key emotional point, but--on the whole--the entire story could have been written more efficiently and covered more ground than it has. For instance, there could have been a dry introductory sequence with a third-person narrator describing the world, how the Districts' rebellions were crushed and the Hunger Games instituted. The propaganda film was a nice idea, but I don't think it worked as well as it could have, since I still only sort of understand what happened even after seeing it twice AND reading the book. The best effect was Katniss's fever dream showing how her father died in the mines--it didn't have to be narrated so much as shown in a few scenes, which I think could have improved much of the expository sequences.
- Katniss is good at surviving... but that's it. She's not really likeable except in that she has the sense not to glamourize death and wants to protect the innocent. In the book [which I read after the fact for comparison], she strings along Peeta as a survival mechanism--because it will increase her chances of winning and, possibly, avoiding having to kill him--and she has no real plans beyond ""don't die."" At least in the movie, because we aren't subjected to her every meandering thought, I got the impression she might actually like Peeta back, and it was only when they returned to District 12 and she exchanged an awkward glance with Gale that I realized she had this unspoken love triangle going on and was being a butt about it. Oh, well, though! She likes Peeta now... wait, the book says she doesn't really? Nevermind, stopped caring about you, Katniss.
- Features? What features? I watched the DVD [it's not worth Blu-Ray] hoping to see some interesting deleted scenes and/or outtakes, but I was disappointed to see there were none of either. Okay, no deleted scenes means a more efficient movie process, but no outtakes, even?? The featurettes included interviews with the actors [eh], a few ""making of"" sequences [also eh], a sequence showing off how they used special effects to create the... mining village? Really?? I guess I don't get how difficult it is to make or go on location to a for-real mining village, but it struck me just how... INVISIBLE the movie effects were, other than the Games control room and the Muttations [which were comically awful]. Okay, sure, the Capitol looks like it took some work to create, but somehow I felt so uninspired by the Capitol as a whole, as though this was a place that really existed and all they did was go there and film it. And ""on fire""? Underwhelming. Sorry.
- WHERE IS THE MORAL. I kept hoping there would be at least SOME kind of conclusion, some evidence that Katniss was changed by the Games beyond ""Yay, I won... for NOW."" Nope, the movie is one big Chapter 1 of 3. I even skipped to the end of&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Mockingjay-Book-3/dp/0439023513/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Mockingjay (Book 3)</a>&nbsp;to see if the ending was worth reading the other two books--Katniss has two kids that Peeta has to TALK HER INTO HAVING, and they don't even have NAMES. What. It's comes across as not an ending so much as, ""Well, I'm out of ideas. I'll stop here."" The obvious social commentary is lost under the ""bread and circuses"" of the spectacle--which may be the point, that we so-called civilized people are so out of touch with our humanity that ""kids killing each other"" doesn't bat an eye so much as gets our blood pumping to see more. What should be one of the most horrifying things imaginable is a mere amusement at the box office. Yes, you might say, ""Well, it's just FICTION,"" but can you really say there aren't still people in this world who want to see that for real? I mean, where do you think murderers come from?

I've tried to like this series, honest. The movie's performance is a slap in the face to the sexist Hollywood producers who think ""strong female characters"" don't sell well because they think ""strong female characters"" consist of scantily-clad women performing ludicrous acts of violence to a terrible farce of a script. It's also a slap in the face to the racists who can't read ""dark hair and dark skin"" as being black [or even ""not white""]--""It ruined the movie for me!"" GOOD, I say. Really, though, there was so much promise squandered by shoddy execution, and as much as I've fished for the gems in the movie, I can't ignore the sludge I had to go through to get there.

tl;dr: The movie's a little better than the book, but not by much.",1348358400,,7353,4.935379644588045

But, the story is contrived and predictable right up to the end (an obvious setup for the inevitable sequel).  The characters are unrealistic and idealized. The motivations, the relationships, the whole social ethos is badly out of sync.  I think it's for young people looking for clear cut heroes that challenge the evil status quo. It's good action/adventure/romance but please don't consider it as serious drama.",1348272000,,528,5.349397590361446

4947662,1,B0063FQREO,"This is a guy's opinion, first of all. I never read the books but 5 minutes into the movie it screams pro-feminine propaganda all the way. To the point that it seems all men are either able to do something but drunk all the time, or they can't do a thing and must be tended to like a pet. That is not an exaggeration, it's that obvious and that bad.

Now for the story. Whoa, bad. Unfeasible is too light a word to describe it. No way in the future of America will people willingly let the government randomly take children just so 24 enter and 1 leaves. American people have been and always will be armed, even after the government is gone. This kind of behavior just does not work in our society. Granted this is a post-revolution future, but a revolution requires people with independence and the will to fight. In this version of the future they are sheep to the government. That is not what Americans will be, if there is a revolution all those sheep will not be around anymore. I cannot explain how little sense this story makes.

To make things worse there is too much teen drama. Just way too much. When the action does happen the director simply zooms in at an odd angle and you can't see what is really happening. Whoever directed this movie needs to quit or actually go to classes on how to be a real director. Almost all the shots were done wrong. Really the only positive was the pretty face playing Katriss, but a pretty face alone does not mean a good movie. This is on the level of Twilight, teen girl fantasy.

4947663,1,B0063FQREO,"I would imagine that a screenplay version of book would either be MOST enjoyable to those who have read the book or to new comers. With this movie, I'm not sure who it is supposed to appeal to. The movie is so rushed in trying to cover the events of the book that there is absolutely no time to develop the characters or build any context to the plot. If you've read the books, then you know that there was still a great deal that was left out of the movie. On the other hand, if you haven't read the books, the movie still doesn't properly develop the story because it  attempts to cover so much.

The film was very beautiful. It is a fun film in this sense. The special effects, graphics,  and actors do a great job  portraying the melodramatic events of the story. However, there is a constant state of tension. There is not a typical narrative structure that allows the story to build to an enjoyable climax. For example: The opening scene of the Hunger Games (the actual games within the movie) begins with the ring of all of the 24 contestants from the 12 districts. The camera is constantly shaking from the beginning. You don't even get a chance to take in the scene and understand that the 24 contestants are all lined up anxiously awaiting what they know is coming. Instead, the camera jitters around the scene as the events awkwardly begin.

I recommend Battle Royale if you want an enjoyable cinematic portrayal of a similar storyline.",1348185600,6,1447,4.486692015209125

But first they made me read the book. I ended up reading the whole trilogy. I find it really hard to put a book down and not know how the story ends. Anyway, the book, I felt, was a little too old for them with the violence in it but, It was so well written that the violence was secondary to the story that was being told. So, I took them to the movies to see ""The Hunger Games"" and enjoyed it immensely. The actors were superb (every one of them) and it was done very tastefully. Cant wait for the next to come out.

After reading the book and having much discussion about over the next several weeks (and waiting the movie to come out on a DVD), we sat down to watch. I was a little concerned about the reported violence, which of course is in the book (Ms. Collins does a very good job of handling this important element in the book) but you never know how Hollywood will treat the same subject. However I was relieved from the start of the film as the director's handling was well within the meaning and feeling of the book, as well as the treatment and handling of the central themes of the book from the very start. In fact some themes were appropriately exaggerated so if you didn't read the book you should be able to easily pick-up on them so more kudos to the director for a fine job. Of course no movie can pack in all that is in the book, but ""The Hunger Games"" really delivered!  Three thumbs up, way up from our family!!

4947686,5,B0063FQREO,I think this movie adaptation was very good.  There were very few things that I disliked about how they interpreted this.  Watching this movie got my sister interested in the books so if you are not sure about whether you want to read the books give this movie a try.,1348185600,,267,4.32
4947687,4,B0063FQREO,"This was a very engaging film and I enjoyed it immensely. I have since read the first 2 novels in the trilogy (The Hunger Games and Catching Fire) and I am enjoying them a great deal. Even though they are intended for a young adult audience, it is mature enough material for older adults (which most certainly includes me!) I have one recommendation regarding the film. If you have not read the books, watch the film first and enjoy it in its own right, then read the books. If you do the opposite, I think you may find the film disappointing. It stands on its own as a very good film but as is typically the case, the film pales when held up to its literary inspiration. Enjoy!",1348185600,,678,4.3046875
4947688,4,B0063FQREO,"costumes and cinematography  are great.  The deeper intellectual underpinnings were smoothed over  when they had the potential to go Brazil-deep in it's dystopian construct.  But very enjoyable and will see the next one, although I won't see it in the theatre, but rather in the HD comfort of my living room.",1348185600,,308,4.980392156862745

4947690,3,B0063FQREO,"This is suppose to be a new society type film, the haves and have not's. sort of a running man type movie. I fell asleep twice watching it.",1348185600,,139,4.0
4947691,4,B0063FQREO,The movie was awesome but the very end was kind of crappy. it didn't really make sense...its like a cliff hanger.,1348185600,,113,4.428571428571429
4947692,3,B0063FQREO,This movie was real close to the book. I am glad i read the book first. Movie skipped alot and was kind of lost. You must read book first.,1348185600,,138,3.793103448275862
4947693,5,B0063FQREO,"I'm a huge fan of the written series and thought this movie did an excellent job of committing the story to film.  A movie can never replicate every detail of a book but this film did a good job of staying true to the spirit of the story.  I loved seeing our hero as the girl who was on fire, excellent job on the costumes and special effects.  I was also pleased that although the story necessarily involved the deaths of the other tributes the deaths as filmed did not subject the viewer to excessive gore.",1348185600,,508,4.270833333333333
4947694,3,B0063FQREO,"While heavy on the action and CGI graphics, I found little that was compelling about the movie. Their was little - if any - real character development, and in the end I did not really care if the heroes won or lost, or lived or died. The dialogue was too contrived and there were far too many cliches.",1348185600,,301,4.206896551724138
4947695,3,B0063FQREO,"The Hunger Games is a Science Fiction fantasy film about how future conflicts between societies can be turned into a marketable production, with deadly consequences.  Actually the real time audience (our time) is drawn into the conflict by rooting for the heroine.  This film is bias with regard to race and shows partiality and has a sequence where the ""magic negro"" saves the day for the heroine.  Political correctness is becoming all too pervasive in our movies and takes away from the believability of the plot, of which this film is thin on.",1348185600,,547,4.860215053763441
4947696,4,B0063FQREO,"All in All a pretty decent movie. I think Jennifer Lawrence is a Good Actor, It had good action and it didn't have all of the over the top special effects, which I am beginning to get tired of watching.",1348185600,,202,4.075
4947697,4,B0063FQREO,"I enjoyed the entire movie, HUNGER GAMES, but the ending reminded me of the old movie, LOGAN'S RUN, with Michael York.  There are several other movies that have that same theme because the same type ending, however, the ""younger generation"" has (more then likely) never seen LOGAN'S RUN.  Perhaps you should offer that movie to the public.  Otherwise, it was quite exciting to watch.",1348185600,,383,4.953125
4947698,5,B0063FQREO,"My wife, my kids (11 and 13 years old) and I watched the movie at the theaters and we liked it a lot. The deal included the Blu-ray and the DVD. Very good purchase.",1348185600,,164,3.8529411764705883
4947699,5,B0063FQREO,Loved the books and the first movie!  Jennifer Lawrence is definitely an actress with true talent.  Some others her age in her field should take note.  Fast paced action ...definitely not a snoozer.  Can't wait for the next movies to come out!  Appropriate material for most teens and up....in my opinion.,1348185600,,305,4.901960784313726
4947700,4,B0063FQREO,"The movie was fairly close to the book, The quality of the movie using Amazon Prime was very good. I think pricing for rental could be a little less expensive and the time of rental extended - then I would rent a lot more movies.",1348185600,,229,4.111111111111111
4947701,4,B0063FQREO,"I enjoyed the movie.  The acting was good.  Was it as good as the book? No.  However, I recognize the big problem with making a movie out of this book (and the big problem I see for the maker's of Enders Game for that matter) is much of the action in the book is happening in the main character's head.  To get around that, the producers decided to write into the script what was going on in the control room but in doing so, they took a lot of the suspense out of the story - the very suspense that makes the book such a page turner.  I also understand that there wasn't a large budge to produce the movie.  So certain bits of information that become more pivotal to the story later, such as what ""mutts"" are and how they relate to the mockingjay and the jabberjays, were completely left out.  Even the final of the Games themselves, becomes just a random dog like creature instead of a mutt. So overall, I'd give the movie a B+ but the books an A+.",1348185600,,950,4.158469945355192
4947702,5,B0063FQREO,"The scenery, photography, costumes and storyline are all stellar. I wouldn't recommed to small children as there is violence against children by children, but, it is very entertaining.",1348185600,,184,5.607142857142857
4947703,5,B0063FQREO,It has been a long time since I got surprised at an ending. Great action and storyline and I was delighted to see hardly any cursing and no sex scenes. A little gory for kids but thoroughly enjoyed the chase. This one is worth a part 2.,1348185600,,236,4.042553191489362
4947704,5,B0063FQREO,"I had avoided this film due to the heavy media but we decided to see it online. What a surprise. It was reasonably well acted and directed; the subject matter was very much of interest, however.",1348185600,,194,4.416666666666667
4947705,5,B0063FQREO,"This is a fantastic book series. Great for the whole family from pre-teen to moms and dads! Very imaginative, the author takes you right into the story.",1348185600,,152,4.666666666666667
4947706,3,B0063FQREO,"Not a great movie.  It was just ok. I watched it and it passed the time, but I wouldn't necessarily recommend it to anyone.",1348185600,,123,4.125
4947707,5,B0063FQREO,"Was a very enjoyable movie, the storyline and the photography were awesome.  I have watched the movie a few times since purchasing it and enjoy it more each time.",1348185600,,162,4.586206896551724
4947708,1,B0063FQREO,Pointless cinema. Storyline was kind of original but that only due to the books. Some stories just aren't meant for the big screen.,1348185600,,131,4.739130434782608
4947709,2,B0063FQREO,Follows the story but leaves a lot to be desired in developing relationships between characters. Shaky camera is awful and she in no way looks like she's scraping by or had a hard life.,1348185600,,185,4.470588235294118
4947710,5,B0063FQREO,This movie was fantastic! Everyone says that books are better than their movie-remakes which is usually very true and while this movie did not hit on a few things I felt it was an extremely close representation of the book.  One of the best things is the actors in it- I have become a big fan of Jennifer Lawrence from this and other movies she has done.  This is mainly because her ability to play a serious role while being a huge goofball off camera makes me really respect her talent (want an example? Check out her interview on The Letterman Show). You'll really enjoy this even if you haven't read the book!,1348185600,,613,4.415929203539823

4947713,4,B0063FQREO,I had been waiting for this movies since I read the trilogy several months ago. I found it very entertaining and very true to the book (as much as a movie of this length would allow). My husband watched with me  (he didn't read the books) and enjoyed it also. We're both looking forward to the rest of the series!,1348185600,,313,4.216666666666667
4947714,5,B0063FQREO,"I saw this at the show after I read the book, great just like the book.  I read the other two books after I saw the this movie, and can't wait till the other parts come out.  The author did great in the writing of these books and the I'm sure when the other Hunger Games parts come out they will be great also.  Great for young (not too young) and young at heart.",1348185600,,363,3.8783783783783785

4947716,3,B0063FQREO,"Maybe it's just the over hype, but this movie made me lose my ""appetite"" for the hunger fans. Did I expect to mug after reading the books, probably.

4947717,1,B0063FQREO,"The acting was stiff and forced, so was the entire choreography and graphics of the nature and Panem, as well as the depiction of the Capitol people.  The fight scenes were blurry as was the point of view that made me dizzy just watching.  With the computerized world we live in, I felt like I was watching a movie filmed 10 (or more) years ago. Just watch Avatar, and you'll know how badly Hunger Games did on the graphics part and flow of the movie.  I have never been this disappointed in a movie adaptation before.  It felt like it was low budget.",1348185600,2,551,4.320388349514563
4947718,4,B0063FQREO,"I read the books and loved them.  I wondered how they were going to actually create a lot of the characters, action and scenery.  The movie blew me away and surpassed my expectations.  I definitely recommend it!",1348185600,,211,4.648648648648648
4947719,5,B0063FQREO,This movie is definitely a buyer. I haven't read the books but the movie had a great story line and the acting is good. I rented it on Amazon and watched it a couple of times. The picture quality was great and I didn't have any buffering issues.,1348185600,,245,4.125
4947720,5,B0063FQREO,THIS MOVIE IS GREAT. I ENJOY IT EVERY TIME I WATCH IT. IT SHOWS HOW SOME WOULD SACRIFICE A LOT FOR FAMILY AND FRIENDS AND WHAT THOSE SACRIFICES COULD BE. HOW FAR ARE YOU WILLING TO GO?,1348185600,,184,4.0
4947721,4,B0063FQREO,"Did find this to be suspenseful and beautifully filmed but not as exciting as all the pre-releases stated. Entertaining, but horrific concept.",1348185600,,142,5.5
4947722,4,B0063FQREO,"So, I'm pretty sure I can't say anything about this movie that no one else has said already, so I'm just going to review the special features, and overall layout of the Blu-Ray. This was the first Blu-Ray disc we have bought (buying it alongside our Blu-Ray player) and I have to say, it was worth it. You could tell the graphics were clearer, and it was overall a better experience than the DVD. Also, we bought it at Wal-Mart and received a Mockingjay necklace alongside it (always good to package a collector's item with your merchandise).

Now, onto the special features. I liked the behind the scenes feature, which included a little explanation on some things that were left out of the book to movie transition. There is also a propaganda short from The Capitol (shown in the movie itself) which is interesting to watch as a stand alone piece, rather than just a clip from the movie. Next, there is some promotional artwork that you can scroll through in a gallery (though pressing the next arrow does get tedious after a while), but if you like looking at the posters of various characters that you might not have seen before, this is for you.

Our Blu-Ray also came with a digital copy, which I hooked up to iTunes. This is a little more scattered with it's special features, but offers info on all of The Tributes, and it gives you clips of most of their scenes from the movie. It also has a small sample of info on each district, and the Capitol. Plus, if you use the digital code, you can play it on your iPod, which is good for people on the go.

The only drawbacks were two things. One is there is no movie commentary, which I was really looking forward too, but there is a sort of condensed version in the behind the scenes feature. Second, is there are no deleted scenes, which surprised me, as usually, most movies come with scenes that were cut from the film. Oh well, beggars can't be choosers I guess.

Overall, I loved the film (being a fan of the books before), and for what the Blu-Ray costs, with the high quality and bonus material) I'd definatly recommend it.",1348185600,,2084,4.4619422572178475
4947723,2,B0063FQREO,I wanted to see this movie but after doing so I asked myself why ? I found it boring. To me it just didn't live up to the hype. Glad I watched it on demand and didn't pay full ticket price at movies would have wanted a refund.,1348185600,,226,3.7291666666666665
4947724,5,B0063FQREO,"The movie told a great story and did a very good job of ""showing"" me the story I read in the book. I'll watch it again and can't wait for the next two in the series.",1348185600,,165,3.611111111111111
4947725,5,B0063FQREO,Amazon's presentation of the Hunger Games portrays a very real potential of what could transpire in our world in the future.  The discord and vehement rhetoric that currently exists may well portend a violent and dictatorial quest for power and control of the masses.,1348185600,,267,5.068181818181818
4947726,1,B0063FQREO,"Everything in the movie felt forced on you. There was no character development so you felt nothing when they started to die.

4947729,4,B0063FQREO,Good movie. It mostly followed the book. I will watch the sequel Catching Fire when it comes out. Hopefully it will be as good.,1348185600,,127,4.333333333333333
4947730,3,B0063FQREO,I guess you have to be into this and read the books to really appreciate it. It had a good story line but just didn't have the punch i was looking for after talking with people who read the book. I don't recommend this movie if you haven't read the book. I guess yo can say it was dull.,1348185600,,286,3.864406779661017

4947733,4,B0063FQREO,"Heard alot of hype about this film.....seemed to be a favorite of the younger generation.  I decided to check it out....and was glad I did!  Very interesting story.....kinda gave me flashbacks to ""Running Man"", sort of where society in the future falls back to a more barbaric form of entertainment.  Great acting and well-written characters.  My 13 yr old talked me into renting it....and I'm glad I did!",1348185600,,405,4.911764705882353
4947734,5,B0063FQREO,Real all the books and the movie was the best.  I feel the director and actors where all great in the presentation of the first book.  I am glad they didn't do all of them in one.  So I have more to look forward to.  If I was younger I would try one of them cross bows now.,1348099200,,273,3.6551724137931036

4947736,5,B0063FQREO,"Most of the time, a movie made based on a book is at best disappointing and at worst a complete disaster.  Happily, this is not the case with ""The Hunger Games"".  Casting was excellent and they did a great job adapting the book to the screen.  Any deviations from the book were minor.  If you've only watched the movie and not read the book, I highly recommend you do - since it is told from Katniss's perspective, you are privy to thoughts that are difficult to transfer to a movie.  At any rate, fans of the book will not be disappointed.  If you didn't read the book, it is still highly enjoyable and easy to follow.",1348099200,,619,4.293103448275862

It provided provocative insight concerning the transparency of governments, the telling of history by the winning side and the impact of those choices on the populace.

4947747,1,B0063FQREO,"Strictly off of my opinion, this movie was a overhyped reguritated Hollywood story about young love and violence.  It's setting was very strange, it started off in the District 12(that looked like it was an undeveloped third world country) and then came the spaceships.  After the selection, the kids get on a super technogolical bullet train with crystal chandeliers, tons of food, and....wait wait wait....WHAT!!!  It was remeniscent of a spin off of a sci-fi German Holocaust.  The first hour and fifteen minutes were painfully tetious, giving nothing but a boring dialogue of ""how to survive"".  An hour and 15 minutes in, thats when you start to see any sign of action...but by that time you will probably be asleep.  I read the first book, it was decently written, but they ruined the movie.  With some more book related changes this could have been corrected and made the movie decent, but still not worth buying. Do yourself a favor, instead of paying 20 bucks, rent it and see if you like it.  I know I was glad I did.",1348099200,13,1026,4.692737430167598

If you loved reading The Hunger Games, you will also like the movie, although you do not have to read the book to enjoy the movie on its own.

The movie changed some details for no apparent reason, e.g. Peeta gets a syringe -- not ointment -- for his leg in the book. I liked the movie better the second time but it's still disappointing to me. It seems much more bland than the book. The arena isn't nearly as terrifying as you might expect. Katniss is supposed to almost die of dehydration, but the movie makes it seem like she finds water instantly.

The movie feels like you have to comprise, but I would say it's still worth watching.",1348012800,,615,4.256410256410256
4947762,5,B0063FQREO,"I caught this last night and enjoyed it. Of course, not all the details can be available in the movie as they are in the book. Yet, the movie follows quite faithfully.
The abbreviated scenes are really in non-too important areas. What I found lacking was the canon fire and the Capitols scenes in the night sky did not match the deaths.

The casting was very good. I liked Lenny Kravitz (Cannis), Donald Sutherland (President Snow), and Woody Harrelson (Haymitch). Jennifer Lawrence shines brightly as Katniss Everdeen and Josh Hutcherson is a very good lovestruck Peeta.

I found the lack of light in the final fight scene with Cato disturbing. If one had not read the book, one wouldn't be too clear on what was going on between the three on top of the Cornucopia and the muttations on the ground. Additionally, Katniss has an ulterior motive regarding Peeta. That could have been made clearer. Actually, I believe the movie could have used a bit of extra time used on the ""Lightly touched on parts."" Difficult, I know. It's almost 2 1/2 hours as is.

The movie ends not too pleasantly for the Head Gamemaker. The ending concludes this first part of the Trilogy well, yet leaves a subtle opening for the sequel.",1348012800,,1213,4.685446009389671

Toska

Russian - Vladmir Nabokov describes it best: ""No single word in English renders all the shades of toska. At its deepest and most painful, it is a sensation of great spiritual anguish, often without any specific cause. At less morbid levels it is a dull ache of the soul, a longing with nothing to long for, a sick pining, a vague restlessness, mental throes, yearning. In particular cases it may be the desire for somebody of something specific, nostalgia, love-sickness. At the lowest level it grades into ennui, boredom.""",1347926400,,539,4.8478260869565215

It comes in a cardboard jacket slip case and a tri fold cardboard DVD case. Mine was very difficult to slide out, and even more difficult to slide in. The Tribute Diaries/stories I thought were going to be very different as if in character. I was hoping more so like all of the 24 tributes tell their stories on the interview with Stanley Tucci, but that wasn't it, just behind the scenes, actors telling what things were like behind the set (and with only the actors/actresses that play Kado, Foxface, Clove, Maverick, and Rue. Jennifer Lawrence and Josh Hutcherson are barely in the tribute Diaries/Storiers). No added extended footage, no deleted scenes. If the cube box edition has it, I'd get that one. This one I would not title this as Deluxe, and if you were looking for more story, don't buy this version. You will be let down.",1347840000,,993,4.584269662921348
4947788,3,B0063FQREO,"There was so much hype surrounding this film that I really wasn't sure what to expect. The film is a great satire of reality television and it takes the concept behind shows like Survivor to the most extreme conclusion.  I really enjoyed this aspect of it, but I didn't think it was critical enough of the horrifying spectacle of children killing each other for sport.

Apart from one character right at the beginning (I can't remember his name) who says that people should stop watching the Hunger Games, no one else in the entire film raises any kind of moral objection to the show or suggests any way of putting an end to the madness. I know viewers are meant to know the Hunger Games are barbaric and disgusting without it being spelled out, but I found it very hard to relate to characters like Woody Harrelson, who we are supposed to like, when they are so complicit with the murder of children. Katniss also never contemplates trying to escape, or does anything to stop the killings. Personally I'd prefer a heroine with more guts.

It also seems ironic, not to mention hypocritical, to make a film about the horror of mudering children for entertainment when the movie itself is based on the murder of children for entertainment. We see them sliced and diced, and apart from the few characters we get to know, their deaths are not seen as tragic or horrifying. To make it more palatable many of the other tribues are portrayed as evil sadists who totally enjoy murdering their competitors. They band together and laugh and joke as they kill people, seemingly oblivious to the fact that they will be next. This wasn't realistic at all.

I'm told the book is much better than the film, and I can see how some of the faults of the film come from adapting it from a novel. I really wanted more background history for this society which could be civilised in some ways and barbaric in others. Without this context it just doesn't ring true. I also found the characters pretty one-dimensional to be honest. Despite the fact that it's quite a long movie I never felt it delved very deeply into their psyches and I really didn't care that much for them.

It sounds like I hated this movie, but I didn't. I thought it was okay, even if it didn't live up to the hype. I'll watch the next one that comes out just to find out where it is going because the ending was quite ambiguous. 2.5 stars.",1347840000,3,2390,4.510392609699769

4947794,5,B0063FQREO,"The Hunger Games was NOT a movie I was interested in seeing, having somehow made the wrong assumption regarding what kind of movie I thought it was.  I thought it was one of the current, endless dark, violent, plot-weak/less ""shallow"" movies that rates way up there for teens.  Despite the number of people who rated it, and the near 5.0 star rating from so many, I was not going to watch it.

I changed my mind when my husband told me he believed ""Katniss Everdeen"" was, in real life, a professional archer (as is Geena Davis.)  And am I ever glad I did watch it!  I bought the movie, in fact, after seeing it for the first time 2 weeks ago or less, and since that first time, I have already watched it over 10 times.

It's hard to put a finger on ""specifically"" what made it such a pleasant surprise, but there's no doubt...physically, physiologically, mentally, emotionally...I was GRIPPED to the point I wouldn't even pause it for a 15 second bathroom break.

Using a list, here are the following elements that made me rate this a 5-star movie:
1.  An original storyline and plot
2.  Quality of the acting performances, by both leads, and supporting actress/tor
3.  Jennifer's exceptional loveliness: she is beautiful inside and out.  (read bio)
4.  Excellent Directing; steadily growing from the start, never losing focus
5.  Dynamite special effects without sensationalism.  Used sparingly, but INTENSE!
6.  The moral...very well defined without forcing the point:  purity of goodness overcomes the adversity of the corrupted in power, who cause suffering.
7.  Last, and yet the most influential - the power of being stunned by the unexpected, and original ""points/actions"", etc...that spring up here and there in the movie, causing the RARE (for me) ""rabidly gripped attention.""  The closest example I can offer is the ""husband-who-is-unapproachable-because-he's-on-the-edge-of-his-seat, body-leaning-far-forward, eyes-riveted-to-the-puck/football, head moving-without-control-as-eyes-follow-what-they're-glued-to"" kind of gripping attention, see?

When the movie came out I was so scared that they would take the book and seriously mess it up. So we didn't see it in the theaters.

I waited, and waited and saw some good reviews and bad. Finally we just gave in and watched it and I was so ....disappointed.

I always see a movie through to the end,no matter how bad it is....but I wanted to turn this off after 10 minutes.  What a disappointment.  The worst part about it is that the author of the series Suzanne Collins is also one of the 3 screenplay writers.

That should be a warning to you in the future - 3 screenplay writers = too many cooks in the kitchen, and they'll ruin everything....even if one of them was the author herself....she apparently doesn't understand what it is that made her books so fantastic....not the violence, not the games themselves, but the characters, and what they stand for, who they are on a deep level.  I would've had rather had 2 separate movies - 1 just to develop the characters and 1 for the games.  It saddens me that the writers, including the author couldn't see how essential the character development was for these movies.  They may have been intended for teenagers, but the movies are insulting to teenagers' intelligence, much less any adult watching. My dad never read the books and thought the movie was great.....doesn't know what he's missing.

I didn't care who lived or died or what happened in the movie....in the book, these things brought tears to my eyes.  And no mention of Kat's dad and how he taught her to hunt, and the song he sang to her?  Ugh, I won't be bothering with the other 2 movies, which are taking far too long to be made, anyway, and don't get me started with the casting.  I mean, Thor's little brother as Gayle, really?  Jennifer Lawrence is as good as she can be with what she was given to work with, as well as Stanley Tucci, both well cast roles.  Lenny Kravitz great choice, unfortunately, one of the most important relationships is between Kat and Cinna, and they didn't even begin to cover that.

Rating: 1.5 out of 5

'The Hunger Games' is an amalgamation of many films and TV shows we've seen before. For starters, the long-running reality show 'Survivor' comes to mind as a good part of the film is set in the forest where the characters must rely on survival skills to survive. The film's premise, in which children and teens between the ages of 12 and 18 must fight to the death as part of a televised spectacle, is reminiscent of 1998's 'The Truman Show', where Jim Carrey's entire life is put under the microscope of a reality show, broadcast to millions.

The setting of Hunger Games is a post-apocalyptic dystopian future similar to the 2010 British film, 'Never Let Me Go'. Both films posit a future where a society of mindless, brainwashed automatons are unable to rebel against a totalitarian system that calls for deathly self-sacrifice of the young. With all the characters adopting such a one note conformity, there's very little wiggle room for any kind of interesting drama in the film, which relies more on the cheap thrill of watching teenagers attempt to do themselves in vis-a-vis mortal combat.

The rulers of the post-apocalyptic country we're introduced to, 'Panem', are more like unpleasant fops from an 18th Century Louis VI French court than the ineffectual pacifists of the 1993 sci-fi satire, 'Demolition Man', starring Sandra Bullock. And our 'common folk' protagonists 'Katniss' and 'Peeta', from 'District 12', remind us of an Appalachian setting, similar to scenes from 'Winter's Bone', the same film in which the Hunger Games' star, Jennifer Lawrence, was nominated for a Best Actress Academy award.

The Hunger Games takes an interminably long time before we get to the meat of the story. The reason for this is that the film's scenarist, Suzanne Collins, seeks to extract as many tears as possible from her teenage audience, by dwelling on the victimization on the protagonist's younger sister, Primrose, and Katniss' sacrifice, when she volunteers to take her place as part of the Hunger Games. Can the cold-hearted leaders at the 'Capitol' be stand-ins for parents in general, as the 'kids' appear to be completely at the mercy of adults who hypocritically claim to be acting beneficently on their behalf.

The Hunger Games won't begin until we're treated to the next long-winded sequence where the principals are introduced to the public via the big media broadcast. The criticism of the media here seems to be all too obvious but Stanley Tucci is effective as the foppish master of ceremonies. Like many of the 'twists' throughout Hunger Games, Kantniss' dress catching on fire during her TV interview, hardly seems fantastic at all. If you want better 'magic', check out any Harry Potter flick instead!

Finally, we get to the meat and potatoes of the film--the fight to the death between the kids. One immediately thinks of a futuristic 'Lord of the Flies' here. Interestingly enough, director Gary Ross's herky-jerky style prevents us from really experiencing the full import of the violence. On one hand, that's commendable since the film's basic premise is wholly unappetizing. On the other hand, it prevents the film from being suspenseful, as the violence doesn't seem real, suggesting that these characters are also not real people.

Hunger Games finally morphs into a completely dopey and comical spectacle as the teenagers (aided by the surly establishment) attempt to do one another in. As the games begin, the kids begin hacking each other with machetes. The rest of it is completely derivative including a dull computer-generated fire, a wasp nest falling from a tree, booby-trap explosions, more computer-generated nonsense (a pack of gnarling hounds), poisonous berries and a fight to the death on top of a weird sculpture called 'Cornucopia'.

If this isn't ridiculous enough, at a certain point, the powers that be declare that there can now be two survivors, provided they're from the same district. This turns out to be a ruse and the new rule is rescinded which lead the protagonists to threaten mutual suicide. Although the bulk of the people are depicted as enjoying the spectacle of the mass killings at the beginning, the authorities now fear that a mutual suicide may cause unrest in the districts. Hence, the basic rules are changed, and now two are allowed to survive, instead of one.

As Jennifer Lawrence appears to have signed on for three more Hunger Games sequels, she'll probably be set financially for life. Whether her overall reputation will survive after acting in such drivel, remains to be seen.

The Hunger Games is really designed for young teenagers and older, less sophisticated teens who have little interest in reading anything resembling what any reasonably educated adult may refer to as 'literature'. It's a film that's mostly devoid of 'ideas' and appeals to devotees of soap operas, who always seem to end up entranced with one-dimensional villains and heroes or heroines, that inevitably end up on elevated pedestals!",1347753600,10,5053,5.061298076923077

4947828,4,B0063FQREO,"I've read all the books, and especially loved the first one while having mixed feelings about the other two.  So I approached the movie with trepidation, as let's face it, movies are almost always never as good as the book.  And that holds true for this one, although I can deifnitely see how it would appeal to those that took no interest in the book itself.

Katniss is a girl from the twelvth district of Panem, a country that has a shining Capitol city and twelve districts that are somewhat poorer and supply different necessities to the Capitol.  To keep her family alive, Katniss illegally hunts in the forest with her friend Gale to provide food and other things they need.  But this year, at the Reaping, in which a girl and boy from each district are picked to go to the Hunger Games ( a brutal contest that is a fight to the death, with only one left alive), her sister Primrose is picked to be a contestant.  In a selfless moment, Katniss offers herself up as a volunteer to save her sister.  As she and Peeta (the boy who was picked) head to the Capitol, she knows that she has a minimal chance of staying alive, but she has to do whatever is in her power to survive the games.

Characters:
Jennifer Lawrence: Katniss Everdeen
Josh Hutcherson: Peeta Mellark
Liam Hemsworth: Gale Hawthorne
Woody Harrelson: Haymitch Abernathy
Elizabeth Banks:  Effie Trinket
Lenny Kravitz:  Cinna
Stanley Tucci:  Caesar Flickerman
Donald Sutherland:  President Snow[...]

I think they did a great job at picked all the different actors and actresses for this moment.  Katniss is a little stoic as played by Jennifer Lawrence, but considering her character isn't very touchy feely anyway, it seems appropriate.  Peeta I found nice, certainly Hutcherson is easy on the eyes, but I just didn't get that shining personality from him like I do through the books.  Gale is also pretty to look at it, but again, the personality just doesn't shine through.  That being said there are several characters who do have a wonderful effect on screen.  Woody Harrelson as Haymitch I thought was perfectly done.  He really seemed just like the character from the books.  And Lenny Kravitz as Cinna, oh my, I have to say I didn't even realize it was him at first and I think I fell a little bit in love with him from his first few minutes on screen.  He was that appealing.  And when I discovered it was Kravitz later, I just couldn't believe it.

The plot for the most part follows the book, and for those who haven't read the book it still is easy to tell what's going on.  Although there are a few things that only people who've read the book would understand.  And that's fine, as it adds a certain element for them.  But there are a lot of areas it strays from the book, and like usual, that's disappointing.  Like with the dogs, there are certain things about them in the book that didn't carry through to hear, and I think it would have been simple enough to make them stay the same that way without needing to take too much time to develop it.  So small things like that.  It will be interesting to see if the sequels to the movie follow the other two books though.  I would hope that they would for the most part as Collins wrote a good series, and there's a lot of detail that is important.

The special effects were pretty good in this movie.  Especially those involving fire.  I did like that they tried to capture Collins vision with ""The Girl on Fire"" and incorporate it into the movie.  Other effects, like the dogs, weren't quite as well done but luckily they weren't in as much of the movie and the better special effects were more predominant.  I do need to point out that ultimately there is a lot of death in both the book and the novel, and it is captured to an extent on the screen itself.  So be prepared for violence, and blood, and tough subjects. The music was good, but nothing special and it actually wasn't until the ending credits that I really took the time to appreciate the music.  It was just filler during the movie itself.  But the songs played during the credits were nice.

Good movie, just wish it had had more elements that make it true to the book.  I will eagerly wait to see the next one.

4947829,1,B0063FQREO,"Besides its deliberately controversial theme of kids engaged in a violent reality show, the movie does not catch one's attention in any other way. It has freely drawn elements from the Roman gladiator arena, 18th century european aristocracy (only the make-up), WWII jewish ghettos etc., without contributing any original idea in return (not even on the sci-fi front). Can one use the movie as the basis of a discussion with kids of the horrors in humanity's own past?

4947830,3,B0063FQREO,"The film was rather long and kept you watching, so 5 stars would probably be appropriate. Many have complained it didn't follow the book, but who cares - it is only fiction.  Some have commented on the ""bread and circuses"" atmosphere of the film, but it was more like ""circuses"" without the bread unless you happened to be one of the selected gladiators.  On the other hand it was a nice look into the future of American turning into a modern day Rome with the military made of professionals and not citizens, a broken economy with the rich getting richer and the poor becoming poorer, and sharp class distinction with the elite ruling. This could be the US in 2020 after almost 8 years of Romney rule engaging in foreign wars at the drop of a hat, securing the nation's economy for the top 1%, and bowing to the influence of every right wing wacko that gets his ear.  Of course, Donald Sutherland seemed a bit more reasonable and decisive as a leader and was certainly a much better actor.

Before reading the books however, I discovered they were written to target per-adolencents.  I thought to myself that ""These won't be my 'cup of tea'.  After several months of their setting on the book shelf and having nothing else to read one night I started on the first volume.  After an hour of reading I became a stary eyed teenaged girl even though in reality I am a 72 year old male. I began a reading marathon in which I read the series during every free moment.  Then I read them all again.
  With that preface in mind you can not imagine elation of finding out that they were being made into a series of movies.  Then, to my chagrin, I remembered what the studios had done to some of my other favored Sci-Fi stories such as ""Time Machine"", War of the Worlds, ""Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep?"", (Blade Runner) et.al.  Before the release of the film I watched no promos, trailers, talk show interviews.  I wanted to go into the movie with the same frame of mind as I did with the books.  I know too, that there is no way to put the entire book into the film without making it a 6 hour movie so was very apprehensive as to what had to be left out and the treatment of what was included.
  Well,  IT WAS AWESOME! The cinematography, casting, acting, character development, everything was perfect.  That is quite a statement coming for someone know for picking out flaws in a film.  I would put it the same class as ""Titanic"" and ""Braveheart"".",1347753600,,1616,4.445578231292517

I especially liked the female lead in the story, Katniss Everdeen, beautifully portrayed by Jennifer Lawrence. She is brave, mature and wise for her young age. She is also smart, skilled, resourceful, loving, and compassionate. Quite a good role model for girls and young women of today.

This movie is now part of my DVD collection. I watch it again and again and highly recommend it. I hope that anyone who is a fan of the Hunger Games book will want to own the film.

4947840,3,B0063FQREO,"The Top 5 films at the box office (worldwide) this year are: The Avengers ($1.5 billion), The Dark Knight Rises ($1 billion), Ice Age: Continental Drift ($836 million), The Amazing Spider-Man ($744 million) and The Hunger Games ($645 million). In the US, The Hunger Games ranks third behind The Avengers and The Dark Knight Rises. It's clear that comic book heroes sell, and other key elements are action and conflict. The Hunger Games aims to give us a new fantasy hero to follow after the conclusion of the Harry Potter franchise.

Does it succeed?

The movie is an adaptation of the first part of a trilogy, written by Suzanne Collins, which was initially aimed at young adults. But, like the Harry Potter series, the trilogy appeals to readers of all ages. I can't comment on the quality of the books because I haven't read them, so I don't know how faithful the movie adaptation is. All I can judge is how well the story works on the big screen. The second movie in the series is set for a 2013 release, while the final part of the trilogy will be split into two movies. So, to answer my question, The Hunger Games is a resounding success as a financial venture and it's enormously popular.

Financial success is one thing, but is the movie worth your time? I guess that depends on what you find entertaining. Let me describe what you can expect.

***Spoilers ahead***

The story opens with a glimpse into the life of Katniss Everdeen (Lawrence). We learn that she lives in one of the poorest of twelve districts in Panem, and that food is scarce. She feeds her mother and sister by hunting for game in the woods and she's a gifted archer. The twelve districts hold a lottery each year to select a boy and girl to represent them. The 24 children will fight to the death and only a single victor will survive. When Katniss sees her young sister chosen, she volunteers to take her place. The chosen boy from District 12 is Peeta Mellark (Hutcherson).

That's all we are told about life in District 12. This is not a drama in which we learn about the struggle to live under such a regime, it's more of an action movie. The story moves on quickly and we are shown the sharp contrast between District 12 and the Capitol, where the population is wealthy and the games are seen as nothing more than a form of entertainment. Katniss and Peeta are interviewed on television by host Caesar Flickerman (Tucci). The Capitol is presented as weird and decadent, and most people look like extras from Amadeus. One character looks to be based on Rita Skeeter from Harry Potter. I had the impression that these people were weird for the sake of being weird and it didn't feel convincing.

The movie plays out like an American version of Battle Royale with elements from The Running Man added for good measure. Those in control of the game can intervene at will using computers. Sometimes they will send medicine, while at other times they will harm or kill some of the contestants. It's all a grotesque manipulation aimed at entertaining the population in the Capitol.

Director Gary Ross is a gifted storyteller, and he also has writing credits for Big, Pleasantville, and Seabiscuit. Unlike all three of those movies, I found that The Hunger Games lacked depth. It's obvious why I am supposed to root for Katniss as she risks her own life to save her sister, but there aren't enough background details to make me connect with her strongly. It felt more like a cynical plot device than anything that was remotely real.

So, for me, The Hunger Games became something of a comic book. There is an attempt at showing group dynamics. Who will work together? At what point will they try to kill each other? Who will take their chances alone? What skills will each of the characters have? How inventive will the deaths be? But the attempt is flawed because some of the most dangerous contestants are displayed as sneering idiots, and it detracts from the seriousness of the situation. This is supposed to be a battle for survival, not a comedy?

I'm trying to give a balanced review, but some of the battles are rather silly. That's not to say that the movie doesn't have a few good moments. One alliance in particular did resonate with me and I reacted emotionally to the death of one character.

My overall impression is one of sadness. Not because of the death of some of the characters, but at what we are becoming as a society. Do we really need to see children fight to the death in order to be entertained? As with modern comedies, we are relying more on shock value than good writing. Katniss Everdeen was portrayed well by a promising actress, but original ideas were few and far between. You know almost exactly what to expect from The Hunger Games before it begins, and most events are thoroughly predictable.

The next three movies will be a huge success, I am sure, but I'm not anxiously awaiting their release. I'm glad that I avoided The Hunger Games in theaters and waited to borrow the Blu-ray from a friend. Don't label me as a prude or someone who is against violence in movies. One of my favorites is Kill Bill, but, unlike the portrayal of Katniss Everdeen, I was shown enough background to care about what happened to The Bride.

This movie does have a huge audience as I outlined at the beginning. If you are the kind of moviegoer who enjoys action, good presentation, and special effects, The Hunger Games will entertain you. You'll need to switch your brain off for a couple of hours, but movies like this do have their place. I guess that's why they get made. I am left wondering about the book and how much was left out. Don't let this review stop you from buying the Blu-ray (which looks and sounds fantastic) or checking out the movie for yourself. I'm clearly in the minority on this one.

(9/29/13 Edit to add: After seeing this movie for the second time, I eventually ended up buying it. It seems that I was in the wrong mood the first time I saw it. Jennifer Lawrence is very good in the role and I am planning to see the sequels and maybe even read the books. I upgraded my rating to 3.75/5).",1347667200,67,6109,4.551912568306011
4947841,3,B0063FQREO,"I've never read any of the books...However, my daughter has, so I understood the basic premise. It isn't an awful film, yes, it deals with an awful truth about us as human beings & the societies we build. The subject matter may be uncomfortable for some to watch, an interesting, at times thought provoking film, to discuss with your pre-teen/teenager...But personally, I feel, not for elementary age children...It was competently acted & directed. It had action where it was needed & exposition where needed...But, it isn't a wholly original story. It's really just another one of many films that employ the art form to extrapolate on the ills of society..It's set in the future, it's dystopic, it's about people standing up for freedom & liberty against an elite number of men & women who use government to micromanage every aspect of their lives...The elite ruling class, & those whom they choose & deem their equals, reap the benefits of the good life while the other citizens are punished to fight for & eek out a meager living....As I said, it isn't an original premise...The hook, so to speak, is that children/young people, are the ones who are exploited to the detriment of their lives & the lives of their families...Sometimes disturbing, oft times silly, somewhat compelling, it will have you rooting for the heroes, but it doesn't really linger all that much afterwards...What it does accomplish is telling a pretty intense story with very little shock value scenes of gratuitous gore, sex/nudity, & profane,vulgar self expression/language...Which was quite refreshing & a rarity, considering this could have easily been the type of film that would have employed all of the aforementioned...But, as it is, it accomplishes not only telling the story, but, communicates the agonizing horrible reality of their existence without gratuity....Is it necessarily a reflection of the way people today would react to such a world??...I can't say, but it was a pleasant surprise...So, no, it wasn't great, but it was an ok film....Even good....",1347667200,,2046,5.11044776119403

4947844,4,B0063FQREO,"I read the three series books. 1st book best, 2nd book fair, 3rd book fair at best. The movie follows the 1st book fairly well. The movie reinforces the books comparison of the political leaders in Washington DC and the population of District One in ""Panem"". (Both are POLITICAL powers.) Those in Washington and those in District One produce nothing, and exist by taxing the citizens of the other Districts (States).  The book and the movie show the political extreme we are traveling towards.
  I read the book's description of the residents in District One, detailing their extreme bad taste, and being extroverted with ego-centric and narcissistic personality disorders.  In the movie, inside the large hall and seeing the District One people watching the ""Games"" I was reminded of the ""Hollywood Crowd"" watching one of their many Award Shows honoring themselves.

4947857,4,B0063FQREO,"The Hunger Games movie brilliantly captures the essence of the first book in the trilogy by Suzanne Collins. From the bleak and gray District 12, to the ridiculously fashionable and indulgent Capitol, the movie accurately depicts many characters and scenes from the novel. If you haven't read the book, the basic premise is that many years in the future, the country of Panem (basically North America) is divided into 12 districts and ruled by one president. Every year, a teenage boy and girl from each district are selected via a lottery system to participate in the Hunger Games. The resulting 24 tributes are trussed up and paraded around the Capitol before being thrust into an arena where only one will survive. Katniss, the strong and brave central character, must utilize her cunning and resourcefulness to win the games. However, with her fate determined by the gamekeepers, and her growing relationship with Peeta, the other district contestant, the odds of her survival are slim.

I am a firm believer in that books are generally better than film adaptations. And while that remains true in this case, I thought that the movie was able to portray the book pretty similarly to how I had imagined it. There were many relationships between Katniss and other characters- her mother, Rue, Peeta, Gale- that I wish would have been further explored, but I think the filmmakers did the best they could in the limited time available. My only complaint is that I did not enjoy the shaky-camera effect. It made it hard to focus on the scene and sometimes was kind of dizzying. I understand the images they were trying to create, but it was a little overdone, in my opinion.

Please note that while the movie is not overly gory or bloody, there are some scenes that might be too violent for viewers under 13. The subject matter itself is pretty gruesome and might frighten children. I do recommend the movie and the book for more mature audiences.",1347580800,,1946,4.823353293413174

4947865,4,B0063FQREO,"In a spoof of Saturday Night Live, Sophie Vergara played a reporter capturing the hunger games in a sketch. It was hilarious but I had to put it in there somewhere. The story is a compelling one about a grim futuristic society where the former United States has been demolished and broken into 12 districts and a capitol. Every year, a boy and girl from each district is brought to the Capitol for training and to be launched literally into the hunger games where kids kill other kids.

The premise might come across as bizarre but the film does a faithful job in capturing Suzanne Collins's novel. Jennifer Lawrence deserves her second Academy Award nomination for Best Actress in her performance as Catniss Everdeen, a teenager who takes her younger sister's place in the games. The younger cast members who play the 24 all do a fantastic job in believable life and death performances.

I bought this DVD 2 pack which includes several extra features like the background of the popularity regarding the trilogy, the making, the message from the Rose Garden, etc. which is worth having. Since the novel is taught in schools, the DVD will be helpful in the classroom as a teaching tool in bringing the story to life. It's a disturbing tale but is worth learning about war, famine, droughts, and society overall.

I have to say that I was a bit disturbed by the outfits, costumes, make-up and hair of the Capitol denizens who seem bizarre and detached from the yearly grisly event.

If I am disappointed, it's because we don't get to hear from the author, Suzanne Collins about her classic trilogy. Usually most authors are deceased but she is alive and well and would have loved to hear and see her in an interview about the book.",1347580800,,1729,4.677631578947368

4947892,3,B0063FQREO,"This isn't a bad film but I don't understand the extreme hype around it - it's The Running Man and Battle Royale mixed together with a bit of TV quality teenage romance thrown in. I enjoyed the movie (and it's been a bad, bad year for film) but it's not a great story by any means.

Credibility is the major problem in the film. Given the extreme set up of having teenagers fight each other to the death, the movie did little to justify why this ever happened. Supposedly, the candidates are fighting for food in their districts but this is far from clear - everyone looks pretty well fed for the most part. There's not enough back story to allow the audience to understand the desperation that presumably drives this futuristic society. Similarly, our hero, Katniss, volunteers as a substitute for her sister without ever establishing her sudden need to face almost certain death - why did she do it?

While the acting is solid, there's nothing compelling about any of the characters. The love story reads like bad teenage fiction where a life-or-death friendship literally blossoms out of nowhere. Considering the gravity of the situation they are in, the romance is like a tacked-on subplot that starts to take over the film. Predictably, the games of the reality show change to allow the star-crossed lovers to win together (if they can survive, which is pretty much a given).

As the games start, teenagers wonder into the woods and one after another meet their grisly endings. There isn't anything particularly clever about the way this happens and some of the sequences are pretty weak. Here's one example - Katniss escapes a murderous group by climbing a tree and one of her pursuers fires an arrow, once, to get her. Rather than shooting off more arrows, they bizarrely decide to sleep at the bottom of the tree. She drops a nest of LSD bees to kill everyone - she then gets stung and passes out for days perfectly safely despite being 100 feet from everyone who wants to kill her. And this is how most of the sequences evolve in a ""and then"" type of plotting that doesn't make much sense or create any tension.

Whereas Battle Royale shows the sudden transition of the players having to literally fight for their lives, Katniss sort of bumps along the ride with plenty of help from sympathetic players and flying jars of ointment. You never really feel she's in much danger so it's hard to get involved with the film. And the violence is toned down so much that it's easy to forget that almost everyone on the screen is going to die - they should have skipped the PG-13 rating, though maybe that's 95% of the intended audience.

From a production standpoint, with the exception of the great design of the futuristic metropolis, the set looks like it was stolen from practically any show on the SyFy channel. It's hard to see where the $78 million went. Stanley Tucci and Elizabeth Banks' wardrobe pushes the envelope a little too far and borders on the ridiculous, trumping even the The Fifth Element for distracting the audience and adding nothing to the story. I was waiting for Derek Zoolander to make a cameo.

So overall I was disappointed. I was sucked into the sheer hype around this film's release and found that it delivers a reasonable way to waste a couple of hours but hardly anything to justify two more sequels.",1347494400,,3335,4.663265306122449

Like Avatar Hunger Games goes deeper into how humans can be deprived of all humanity by decadence. One might enjoy the brilliance of the settings e.g. the capitol city, the costumes, and the special effects, however, without also allowing the movie to touch the viewer on a personal level, without making them think about the fight for survival and empathy the point would be missed.

4947904,5,B0063FQREO,"The Hunger Games follows Katniss Everdeen as she becomes the female tribute from District 12. Katniss is a strong person, who's taken care of her family by hunting. She takes this skill into the Games, where she's forced to kill or be killed.

The movie is filmed in an interestingly personal, up-close, and (sometimes) blurry way, especially at the beginning as we take in the bleak life of District 12. The special effects are quite sound, though nothing that hasn't been seen before. The score is fitting, but again, not outstanding. The costume designs and make-up were outrageous in the best way possible to fit the people of The Capitol.

Though a lot of the movie is very action-oriented, the connections Katniss makes during the tense atmosphere of the film are moving, even - or perhaps, most especially - when they lead to heartbreak and pain. You can definitely feel connected to this character, who's had to be strong all her life, but also cares very deeply. Too often we see a ""strong woman"" as cold and uncaring

The Hunger Games is also a very good book-to-movie adaptation. I was quite happy that they didn't skip the lead up to Games, which I find a very interesting introduction to the world. There were a few things that I missed, but the movie does a great job in capturing what it shows you. I think a fan of the books would be likely to enjoy this movie.",1347408000,,1377,4.5894308943089435

4947922,5,B0063FQREO,"*1)There is an area of land that was once called North America.  That area now consists of the CAPITOL ruling area, PANEM, with 12 outlying Districts.  The Districts are kept segregated, given numbers, not names, and can't talk to each other - no unity for ease of hard-line control. *2)To further control and prove subservience Each District is forced to provide One Girl, and One Boy, ages 12 - 18, to fight each other until death, with one to survive, in the televised Annual Hunger Games.  The persons are selected by lottery and are called TRIBUTES. The Games are ""Hunger"", as the winning Tribute's District will receive extra food rations for one year. *3)KATNISS is a 16 year old girl that lives in the 12th District - the poorest, which was previously known as Appalachia.  Her father was a coal miner and Game Hunter and taught her to Bow Hunt before he was killed in an explosion. She has been the provider for her widowed mother and young sister since the age of 12.  *4)At the District 12 Annual Festival for Tribute selection Lottery, Kitniss' 12 year old sister, PRIM, is drawn to represent them as the Female Tribute, and a 16 year old Male, Peta, is drawn.  KATNISS pulls PRIM aside and shouts ""I will go in her place"".  The Committee accepts KATNISS as their Female Tribute, and immediately throughout the Capitol and Districts KATNISS becomes a Heroine & Celebrity.  *5)Tributes from all Districts are transported by Train to Capitol for rules, weapons, & fitness training before the Games.  In transit KATNISS realizes she knows PETA.  He had given her family burnt bread when she was 12 - it kept them from starving.  She also remembers they will be adversaries and will have to kill each other.  She remembers her strengths - she is stringy lean, strong, and knows how to be a predator. She must survive for her family.  *6)This is just the start of this GREAT story, and it has many more exciting subtleties, characters, and events, and is Highly Recommend by BANDITO.",1347408000,,1990,4.716763005780347

4947925,4,B0063FQREO,"It might be a movie for teenagers, but by weaving themes of love,loyalty,generosity and heroism into the story the writers have made it entertainment for all ages.
Some of the ideas are borrowed from real history. Region 12 could be Appalachia in the early 1900's, it's for all the world like West Virginia. The children as tribute angle is very similar to the story of the Athenian children being sent in prehistoric times to Crete's Minotaur and the fighting harks back to Rome's Coliseum.
It's a good idea to read the book first as you will be then so much more aware of important background to the story, at which the movie only hints by flashbacks.
My 12 year old grand-daughter says that it's the best movie ever made, and I loved it too.
For me,Catness Everdeen is right up there with True Grit's Mattie Ross, and that's saying something.",1347321600,,845,4.64
4947926,2,B0063FQREO,"Reading a book upon which a movie is based is a two-edged sword. I read the excellent trilogy by Suzanne Collins, but had lowered my expectations based on lukewarm reviews of the movie.

So, I entered the movie thinking of the compromises I'd be willing to accept. What little I did end up enjoying was mainly because of a few performances by A-list actors, and none of them was fully developed. These teaser roles, which ultimately disappointed, include:  Effie Trinket, Haymitch, Caesar, Cinna, and others. Katniss' mother, the great Paula Malcomson from Deadwood fame, had about two brief scenes. The great Woody Harrelson as Haymitch never really got off the ground.

Key gripe: Jennifer Lawrence is fetching, but not that believable as this incredible archer, hunter and woodsman. Lawrence was not in physical shape for such a stellar role and if she can really handle a bow and arrow I'd be surprised. If you want to see someone handle a bow and arrow, watch Sly Stallone in the final chapter of the Rambo series. Lawrence has no body definition, she couldn't run worth a lick and her chubby baby face may be suited for the Pom Pon squad at a local high school, but she was no Linda Hamilton in the Terminator series, or Natalie Portman in Black Swan.

In this era of super believable action movies - Sylvester Stallone's physicality in the Rocky series, DeNiro playing Jake Lamotta, Will Smith's unbelievable boxing skill and conditioning in ""Ali"" biop, Matt Damon in the Bourne series, Mark Wahlberg in the football movie ""Invincible"" - the HG action was pedestrian at best.

The action scenes in general were VERY POORLY done, more like the ""action"" in the original Batman and Superman TV shows 40 years ago.

The stunts and action were very brief, I guess, to cover up how unrealistic they were. The costuming of all the tributes was lame, one almost undistinguishable from another - more like cheap Halloween costumes. After the spectacular costumes, makeup, stunts, sets and music in movies like Batman, Superman, Dick Tracy and others, Hunger Games was a huge disappointment, IMHO.

The only sets that were semi-impressive were in Panem's capital and that had a lot of CGI I'm sure.

But the early scenes in District 12, Katniss and Peeta's district, were totally unremarkable, looking more like Appalachian coal mining country in Coal Miner's Daughter. The arena, the focus of the entire series, had a cornucopia that looked as if it had been constructed in an afteroon out of cardboard painted metallic, and sitting in a field that looked like a summer camp softball diamond.

And music? I don't even remember the music, so ""Hoosiers"" it ain't.

Here's the thing; people really really wanted to like this movie. But, to be honest, I can only give it two stars, 2.5 at most.

NOTE: I also entered the movie anticipating something good because the director, Gary Ross, made my favorite movie of the decade, ""Seabiscuit"".",1347321600,,2933,4.881287726358149

I expected a lot more from this movie due to the reviews and even my 71 year old Mother-In-Law's opinion.  I kept watching it hoping something good would be around the corner, but that corner never came.  At an 1 hour and 2 mins into it I kept thinking, ""Ok, it could still be good...the music is ramping up...maybe there will actually be a battle or at least a slap fight""...Nothing....1 Hour and 47 mins into it (still grasping onto a semblance of hope) the music ramped up and I thought, ""Ok, here comes the battles I have been waiting for""...nothing.  Even if you could make it through the tedium, the story is just silly (modernized 16th century clothing??)...There are no explanations of how and why society is this way...Just apparently one city for the rich and the rest of the planet puts up with it???...If you have an exciting life and your doctor wants you to rest and have no stress, then this is the movie for you!!

I think my problem with the movie was that I had heard how good it was over and over that I was expecting more than I got out of the movie. Don't get me wrong it's worth watching but I can not in my opinion rate it with 5 stars and not even 4 stars. Maybe 3.5 stars maybe,1347235200,,315,3.716417910447761
4947961,4,B0063FQREO,"I've never read any of the Hunger Games books, so how this compares I wouldn't know. But as a stand alone film it was good. I heard people compare this to a different book/film called Battle Royale, which I have seen and read the book. There are some similarities, but I'm not going to mention them, you should just watch this film and read BR.

Anyway, this film was ok. A bit slow in the beginning, to help explain who Katnis is and her values. There's a good amount of drama tossed in, which would be obvious for the plot of the movie.

There are definite moments that you notice there just isn't enough time in a 1 hour and 40-some minute movie to explain every single detail, like ""Oh, how did he end up there?"" Or ""why was it so sad that she died?"" ...things like that.

Overall, it's a good movie for teenagers to watch, adults can get into it too. Not so much for smaller children. Only downside; this feels like it's going to be another Twilight or Harry Potter saga... Don't be surprised if they end up splitting the last book into 4 or five seperate movies ;-)",1347235200,,1071,4.292079207920792

4947966,4,B0063FQREO,"Whenever a book gets adapted to a movie, something is lost.  Whether that's character depth, minor plot elements, or perspective, it's simply not possible to fully translate what is essentially an inner, thought-driven medium into something we experience through more external senses.  In the case of The Hunger Games, the challenge is to translate a first-person-narrated book into more of a third-person experience.  How can the directors express Katniss' thoughts when she only speaks to other people?  How does she really feel about Gale?  About Peeta?  It's tricky, but the directors use understatement very well (witness the ""You call that a kiss?"" note) and express Katniss' emotions through other people's lines (the movie gives words to the Hunger Games commentators; the book does not).  Short shrift is given to Katniss' relationship with her mother, with Prim, with other people in her district, and even to some degree with Gale.  Peeta's parents are barely mentioned; Katniss' father never is.  Probably necessary casualties of a film adaptation, so read the book for a bit more character development.

I'll say that the movie was far less gory than I expected, having read the books.  That's a good thing, given the movie's target audience.  No serious blood, but the neck-breaking scene was still disturbing, and Clove is still her usual sadistic self.  The muttations are far less demonic than in the book, and Peeta's injury appears somewhat trivial here compared to the book's festering wound right by his crotch.  No tourniquets here, no post-Games heart attacks for Peeta, no false leg. Still, don't let your children see this without seeing it yourself--I've seen tons of R-rated films that are far less disturbing (though may use more swearing).  They (and you) will want to talk about it.

The Hunger Games tackles themes (children killing each other, authoritarian government) most of us would never think about on our own; for that alone, it's worth experiencing either as a book or as a movie.",1347235200,,2020,5.131498470948012

Once I focused on the science fiction aspect, I relaxed and got into the story.  Many of the characters seemed over-exaggerated, but that is how the story needs to be told.  The horror of it all permeates through the callousness of the characters in charge in the city.

The movie is well acted, has beautiful cinematography, and a good soundtrack.  I am anxious to see the rest of the trilogy.  It was not quite a 5 star movie for me, but still well worth watching and owning.",1347235200,,620,4.442477876106195

The acting was quite good and the special effects were stunning. However, I was very disturbed by the premise that teenagers, raised in, generally, good families would kill each other with so much enthusiasm and with no apparent remorse. This feeling stayed with me for days. I am rather older than the average person to whom the books are targeted but this was my emotional reaction to the film. If I had children still at home I think that I would not recommend that they read the book or see the movie. Perhaps this was supposed to allegoric, like ""Lord of the Flies"" but it still hit me in a way that ""Lord of the Flies"" did not.

4947993,3,B0063FQREO,"Of my friends, the ones that read the books were thrilled to see a faithful re-creation of a story book that they loved.  I myself did not read the books and I was seriously underwhelmed.

I will say that a magnanimous effort was made in creating this universe!  Costumes, architecture, ethics & psyche of the characters, zeitgeist, everything.  Think, The Golden Compass - that grand of a scale.  Having said that, most of the story was easily predictable and there were gaping holes in plot development that left me sitting there asking, ""but why?"" and all my questions remained unanswered until I could speak to someone that read the books.

Although I'm sure the rest of the world saw this before I did, I will be sensitive to spoilers.  Even the commercial explains the elevator-pitch: The Hunger Games are a televised ""The Running Man"" style event where a large group of teenagers are drop-shipped onto an ""island-sized"" Thunderdome to murder each other.  So, you have to be into seeing a group of 13-19 year old children murder each other - I was not.  Also, be prepared to see our hero, Katniss, to be either asleep in a tree or otherwise unconscious for approximately 4 days!  Yawn.  Once she joins the movie, all plot points are visible from a mile a way.

Jennifer Lawrence is a talented young lady, but Josh Hutcherson acts circles around her every step of the way.  There are some plot points that, as an actress, she simply could not express.  Suffice it to say that Katniss' internal thought process involved things to do:

1. to survive the players
2. to deceive the audience
3. to deceive Peeta
4. manipulate the producers
5. to remain true to herself

A brutal chunk of acting for anyone - but Lawrence never came close.  All of the character motivation that I found was driven by props and dialog, and that was massively insufficient to explain what was really going on.  Again, I had to ask friends who read the book.  Then I had to read the Wikipedia page!

Look for a surprising performance by Lenny Kravitz!  He is great at connecting the audience with the characters in the movie.  It is hard to explain, he is surrounded by VERY over-the-top personalities that I could not relate to - but I connected with him as someone that sees this universe the way I (the audience member) sees it.

Bottom line.  If you read the books, you have already seen it.  If you haven't, have your phone handy - you'll have questions.",1347235200,,2438,4.613953488372093

I am not sure exactly what I expected, but would have liked Katness to be more aggressive in the hunt. Also, I thought the scene where Katness and her partner kissed could have been omitted as I didn't think the character portrayed by her would have done that while all the time her real love was taking care of her family and waiting for her to come home.

  The extra content was interesting but nothing really special.  Lots of comments on how great all the actors were, what a great job the crew did, etc.  Only Donald Sutherland had anything controversial to say, and that was political--not related to the making of the movie.

Let me preface by saying I didn't read the books, strictly watched this for entertainment and b/c it has been advertised everywhere.

I enjoyed some parts, and tremendously enjoyed the concept...found it ""original"" - but felt the acting was lacking (especially most of the characters in the ""games""), character development was rushed, and the climax left more to be desired. Some things in the movie were explained well while others were not; like the ability to control the hunger games environment. This was one of the few movies that would have really benefited with a 3+ hr film. Maybe the next chapter will bring more detail and better actors....since most of them were killed off anyways! Don't bash, I do think Jennifer Lawrence did a fine job with her role. Do tell me that Josh Hutchersons character is gone soon though...",1347235200,,844,4.895104895104895

4948011,4,B0063FQREO,I thought they did a great job translating the book to film.  The casting was spot on.  The video and audio quality are reference.  My only complaint is that there should have been a few exta minutes devoted to Kat's struggle over what to do about the feigned romance - the film makes it seem more comfortable for her than was actually so.,1347235200,,339,4.349206349206349

4948032,4,B0063FQREO,"Normally movie adaptations from books leaves one wanting or needing more. While the first movie version of the famous book series does not tell us the whole story, it still gives us the characters we can identify with and sets the table for the sequels sure to follow. The world has survived a horrible war event, that was a conflict between classes with the lower class coming up short. The upper class will make sure the the districts remaining will always remember who won, inaugurating the annual ""Hunger Games"" where the losing districts send two children, ages 12 to 18, one male one female, to compete in a contest to the death, while the world watches. The Games are used to remind those who lost the war, never to use conflict as a solution to their problems, and the 12 districts lost their war to the Capitol and it's followers. The brutal Hunger Games tells a remarkable story, but the movie does not do the story real justice, keeping viewers safe from the tragedy of the the story most likely to keep its pg13 rating.

The only suggestion I might have would be to perhaps recommend a dialog or narration as part of the film as this could clue individuals a little better as to what is going on. It is sometimes a little confusing to follow (in the film) unless you have read the books.

From the beginning, you basically know who is going to win the hunger game, you just don't know how it will happen. Also, some of the action was controlled by the people who ""put on the games"" So, it really wasn't a fair fight. I think I would have liked to see a bit more intelligence when it came to the hunt and for those trying not to be detected. All in all, it was good but, I expected better with all the publicity it had received.

4948068,4,B0063FQREO,"This is my personal opinion and you may not agree with my review and that is okay. I saw this movie in the theater and enjoyed it enough that I right away came home and made sure I had the Blu-ray on pre-order.

I have to give a big thumbs up for the adaptation from the book to film. Yes there are parts of the book that are changed in the film but that has to be expected for any film from a book. After all it would be impossible to include everything in a film that is in a book. But I'd like to see someone try it sometime.

Now one part of the movie that did disappoint me was the ending with Peeta. I am not one to ruin the movie with spoilers if you have not seen it yet, so I won't comment on what is different, but I really think that they should have followed the book.

The second part of the film I was disappointed to see changed in the film was the meeting of Peeta and Katniss after they are in the Capitol. There is an integral part of that scene in the book, that should have been included in the film.

These two points tie into the next story and since they were changed in the film, I'm curious to see how they cover it in the second film.

Overall I am pleased with the movie. It was still understandable and easy to follow for those who have not read the series. And this I can attest to, as my spouse has not read the books, and he really liked to movie.",1347148800,,1378,3.924731182795699

I was glad when it finally came out on blu-ray so i could watch the whole thing. It was a great movie. Very interesting and creative plot and story.,1347148800,,316,3.661764705882353
4948071,4,B0063FQREO,"The main reason I read the HG trilogy is because I had seen ""Winter's Bone"" in theaters when it was first released, and I thought Jennifer Lawrence was an amazing actress. When I learned that she was going to play the lead in The Hunger Games, I knew I'd want to see the movie. Fortunately, I've enjoyed reading speculative fiction all of my life, so it was no stretch for me to read THG. I have a problem with the basic premise --  that a totalitarian government would be able to take its citizens' children away from them to fight in gladiatorial combat. I don't believe in real life that people would put up with it. There would surely have been a revolution long before 74 years of Hunger Games competition had passed. That said, I set aside my disbelief as best I could while reading the books and watching the movie. The books aren't literary fiction, but they were entertaining and interesting enough to keep me engaged, mostly to find out what happens to Katniss.

I thought the movie was faithful enough to the first book in the series, and the video and audio quality of this Blu-Ray disc is excellent, about what I'd expect. All of the performances were very good, and, as I expected, Jennifer Lawrence was outstanding. She's one of the greatest young actresses of our time, and I'm sure she'll have a highly successful career. I wasn't crazy about the jerky, handheld camera movements, but I got used to it, and I understand the director's rationale for using it. Actually he explained it well in the disc's extras. I enjoyed the behind-the-scenes documentary about the making of the movie, although I thought it felt at times as if they were trying to justify their creative choices to appease Hunger Games geeks. I know there were people who were frustrated at the various ways the movie didn't precisely follow the book, and who thought Jennifer Lawrence was a bad choice to play Katniss. I can't imagine another actress in the role of Katniss Everdeen.",1347148800,,1968,4.652298850574713

Unfortunately it turned out to be very predictable, and accept for the lead actress and a good performace by Woody Harelson the acting wasn't very inspired. The action scenes were not very exciting and I thought the competitors acted unrealistically, taking me out of the story. This is suppose to be the start of a trillogy or something but I didn't think the background that the story takes place in was good enough to support even one story. Overall its watchable and there are some interesting visuals, but not much else. Also the kid that plays the romantic lead is a terrible actor and I think that ruined the romance angle of the story for me.",1347148800,,705,4.515625

It is so timely and so good and well done. I read all three books and cant wait for the next two movies. The story could be anywhere, now even. Its about us, human beings and who still has a soul.

4948086,4,B0063FQREO,"""The Hunger Games"" is a surprisingly good adaptation of the best selling novel,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Hunger-Games-Book-1/dp/0439023521/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Hunger Games (Book 1)</a>. We missed it in the theaters, so was happy to find it on Amazon Instant Video.

No plot spoilers from me; the story follows Kitness (Jennifer Lawrence), a resident of District 12 and next ""tribute"" to compete in the The Hunger Games. The Hunger Games are a yearly event set up in retribution for an uprising of the 13 Districts against the Central Government, and requires each of the surviving Districts to send two representatives, between the ages of 12-16 to compete in a fight to the death as ""tributes"". The acting was very good, with Lawrence being the standout in the lead role, Woody Harrelson was excellently cast as the mentor, and Donald Sutherland as the president. The special effects ranged from fair to outstanding and it was good to note that they were not the focus of the movie.

This did have some moving and occasionally disturbing scenes (it is about kids killing kids), but it was generally handled tastefully and without a lot of gore. I had to pretend to not noticing my wife tearing up in a place or two.

Recommended!

We then proceeded to see the movie at the theater to determine how closely it would follow the book (not an easy task by any means due to its complexity).  Of course the book was much more detailed, providing the history and background of the events leading up to the present day etc., I have to say they did a rather good job with the movie.  I like how they pulled it together and allowed you to follow the story line event though you may not have read the book first.

There has been movies and story or even real historic events like Romans' gladiator.  I can suspend the reality/notion of older mature human fighting each other for glory.  There has been a few of those movies within that genre (mostly cheesy) like&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Gamer/dp/B0030SBZCQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Gamer</a>&nbsp;or&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Death-Race/dp/B001ILHY1I/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Death Race</a>.  But kids hunting kids, is disgusting to watch.

Otherwise the movie is well written, well acted and it kept me watching the whole time.  I won't give too much away from plot just what the genre is and some movie sif you seen maybe like it.  Got that big brother style feel of&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/1984/dp/B004XNFNT8/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">1984</a>&nbsp;or as in the great movie&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Equilibrium/dp/B004SKLD9A/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Equilibrium</a>.

The cast for this movie was stellar. Jennifer Lawrence epitomized Katniss Everdeen. Her performance was gritty, vulnerable, and strong. She was everything that made Katniss such a joy to read. It was just as good watching her come to life on screen.
Josh Hutcherson, while not necessarily what I pictured in my head while reading, became my favorite performance during the course of the movie. He turned what could have easily have been a cliched character into someone who displayed grace, strength, and a rare spirit that should have been crushed by his situation. He won me over and I couldn't picture anyone else as Peeta Mellark.

Lenny Kravitz and Woody Harrelson gave excellent performances as well.

4948127,5,B0063FQREO,"Originally published in 2008, Suzanne Collins' novel ""The Hunger Games"" became wildly popular as did its two sequels.  Luckily for movie goers, the film adaptation was not treated as a potboiler quickie and we are treated with a fantastical and well-made adventure rather than a loud, dumb and forgettable blockbuster. For those unfamiliar with the books, the story follows a place called Panem, which is a hellish empire in the future of what is now the U.S.A. where the patrician oligarchs in the wealthy city of Capitol live in fancy and lavish lifestyles and the masses in the twelve districts live in squalor. This dictatorship features an annual ritual of sacrifice in which twenty four tributes (teenagers volun-told by a lottery system) compete in a sadistic competition called The Hunger Games; a gladiator styled battle royale which is treated like the Olympics by the media and Capitol residents, despite its brutal nature. One year, a woman named Katniss Everdeen (Jennifer Lawrence) in the Appalachian and poorest district, District 12, finds herself shipped off to the Capitol to prepare for competition in the Hunger Games along with fellow denizen Peeta Mellark (Josh Hutcherson). They meet the eccentrically dressed escort Effie Trinket (Elizabeth Banks), drunken mentor Haymitch Abernathy (Woody Harrelson) and sympathetic stylist Cinna (Lenny Kravitz). This trio helps them and the other tributes prepare for the mandatory pageantry and talk shows they must participate in before the Hunger Games begin. Once the tributes arrive at the arena and the competition begins, a bloodbath takes place at the starting place and the survivors run off for cover. Can Katniss survive the Hunger Games?

This film is not a crisp and perfect adaption of the novel but I think it is faithful to the core and spirit of the story. Readers hoping to see the novel verbatim will be disappointed as the film cuts out a lot in the beginning including Haymitch's hangover at the Reaping and Katniss' relationships with other people in District 12 (her connections with her family and Gale are shown a bit). Katniss' and Peeta's drama to lure in sponsors is here, although some of it is abbreviated. To be frank, the film would be close to ten hours if everything were adapted, so this abridging is understandable. The great thing about this film is that it could be enjoyed by someone who has not read the novel; it is sharp and self-contained. The third-person rather than first-person POV allows viewers to see more of Panem and characters such as the antagonist, President Snow. Donald Sutherland is perfect as the Blofeld-like Snow and the extra scenes of him provide a few insights into the ideology and feelings of the Panem rulers as the competition continues. Characters like Cato, a buff and towering tribute from a district where youngsters are fed and bred to be fighters ala ancient Sparta, are given new and improved spins as he has some sympathetic moments.

People compare The Hunger Games to the novel and film Battle Royale and, while they have some similarities, they are both examples of a long standing sub-genre dating back decades such as ""The Most Dangerous Game"" and centuries including mythological examples like tributes sent to fight the Minotaur and historical examples of forced mercenaries and glorified bloodshed such as the days of bread and circuses (or  panem et circenses). Nothing against the novel, the film, Koushun Takami or the late-great filmmaker Kinji Fukasaku, but this is not a ripoff or plagiarism.

The film is well shot with great sets and costumes with the best examples being the contrasting fancy and colorful Capitol with decadence and showmanship in everyone and everything and the destitute districts who wear shabby clothes one might find a century ago in slums. The violence is brutal at times but it is often tastefully limited with reaction shots and off-screen terrors. The special effects for the fantastic science fiction of Panem such as the train ride in or the elaborate pageantry are magnificent but the muttations leave something to be desired. The acting makes the film as Jennifer Lawrence combines toughness and pure beauty in her role of a heroine stuck in a political game of theater, battle and death. Katniss is strong, pragmatic and stoic but there are subtle hints in Lawrence's performance that allow you to follow her experience despite the lack of narration or first-person viewpoint. Her character's country survivalist life harks back to her unforgettable performance in Winter's Bone. Harrelson's stumbling but frank Haymitch is a perfect incarnation of the novel's character, even if his screen time is cut short. Amandla Stenberg portrays Rue, the youngest and most adorable tribute, who bonds with Katniss and plays a special role in the competition. Stanley Tucci provides some humor as the over-the-top television presenter,  Ceaser Flickerman.

The Hunger Games touches upon a lot of political and social themes as well as tropes and story telling arches we have seen before.

For me, that is what sets a good movie apart from a bad one, a good movie will make the viewer feel emotions about the movie.  All the gut-wrenching feelings that occurs within the viewer while the Hunger Games is absolutely intentional. it is a very dark movie, not the greatest for kids, but worth it.  This is one of those movies with a high replay value, as in every time you watch it, it is still just as good as the first.  I also like the fact that it explains what the book doesn't, while it doesn't rely on the book either.  A must see, and a good purchase.",1347062400,,658,4.149606299212598

4948136,4,B0063FQREO,"Harry Potter is now complete so of course when it comes to new book series & film adaptions, I was curious where I would go. The Hunger Games was one of the first series I went towards, pretty much because of the Harry Potter like hype and books were getting. After reading the first book of course i was on line to see the film.

I have to say what impressed me the most about this film was the actors chosen to play these characters. It seems each actor was picked specifically because they could not only act the parts, but their features and their acting styles were prefect fits. Jennifer Lawrence was great as usual. Liam Hemsworth and Josh Hutcherson officially broken through and will definitely have work after this franchinse. Still, it was their supporting cast that impressed me the most, especially Lenny Kravitz and Stanley Tucci. The story was very well translated to film, though it is very different from the book it was still great how the story got expanded a little to make it watchable. The only thing I didn't like and it seems to be something almost everyone has issues with. The shakey cam was just a little over done, but I understand why it was filmed the way it was.

This was one of the best films I have seen this year and the book along side the film was definitely something I did not expect. A very dark story about survival in a very extreme future. I am hoping that the rest of the films are able to be up to par with this one...minus shakey cam of course.",1347062400,,1490,4.375451263537906

4948138,5,B0063FQREO,"I liked this movie.  I bought it after I read the novels.  I ordered the disc because it was SO much less expensive then in stores.  Plus, a nice bonus, it came with an electronic copy that showed up on my amazon account that is linked to my bluray player.  So, I could watch the movie before my disc even showed up.  Awesome.

4948140,5,B0063FQREO,"Movie was fantastically done, very close to the book. Love the people they picked for the different roles. Is worth the time to purchase and watch!",1347062400,,147,4.6923076923076925
4948141,4,B0063FQREO,"Post-apocalyptic North America is controlled by Panem, a dictatorial state which enforces control through discipline and fear. Every year, two 'tributes' from each of Panem's twelve districts are chosen at random to do battle to the death. The survivor of the carnage becomes rich and famous, and the people are reminded of the Capitol's power. Sixteen-year-old Katniss Everdeen volunteers to take her sister's place in the games, and must find a way to win despite her lack of experience and training.

The Hunger Games is an adaptation of Suzanne Collins's YA novel of the same name and closely follows the events of the novel. Like the book, the film pits Katniss Everdeen in a fight to the death against twenty-three other youngsters, including her fellow contestant from District 12, Peeta Mellark. The story is divided into two distinct sections, the first involving Katniss's selection and preparation for the games and the second depicting the contest itself. This shift in setting and tone halfway through the film helps sustain and the tension and drama through the movie's running time (which, at almost two and a half hours, is fairly long for a YA movie).

The script closely follows the plot of the novel, apart from a fairly elegant solution to the problem of the book being based on Katniss's heavily-internalised experiences. In the novel Katniss can only speculate on the motives of the people running the game, but in the film we cut away to what's going on the game control centre and with President Snow. This expands the scope of the film a little and helps set up the sequels rather better than the novel, which was not written with sequels in mind and didn't layer in a lot of foreshadowing for what would come after.

The movie follows the book in presenting the Hunger Games as a satire on modern reality TV shows, but through the visual medium is able to take this a lot further through film clips of people commentating on the game like it was the latest season of The X-Factor. Unfortunately, rather like the book, the film also does not take this satirical edge far enough, instead opting for raising questions and then not exploring them far enough. This problem also extends to the story's use of violence and morality. As in the novel, Katniss and Peeta are never put into a position of having to kill any of the other victims of the game, only the 'bad guys' who revel in it. The movie cops out on putting Katniss and Peeter in real moral quandaries, which is a shame. The film also has variable CGI, with depictions of the Capitol's cityscape looking decidedly sub-par in places.

Aside from that, the film works pretty well. The movie is quite long but there's a lot of plot to fit in. Director Gary Ross has a crip, fast-paced directing style that moves us through the novel's major story beats without sacrificing too much atmosphere. He often finds concise ways of giving us backstory and worldbuilding information without having to waste time on exposition, which keeps things moving along nicely.

Performances are pretty good. The movie hinges on Jennifer Lawrence's portrayal of Katniss and she nails the role perfectly, bringing the required mixture of anger, determination, bravery and guilelessness. Josh Hutcherson has to settle for merely being good in the role of Peeta, with more established performers like Stanley Tucci, Toby Jones, Elizabeth Banks, Woody Harrelson and, of course, Donald Sutherland fufilling their roles with aplomb. Sutherland brings an air of real menace to the role of President Snow that bodes well for the sequels. Lenny Kravitz also impresses in the role of Cinna, though this role has been cut down from the books somewhat.

With a good script, economic story-telling and solid performances, The Hunger Games (***) is overall an enjoyable movie. It loses some of the depth of the secondary characters and subplots over the novels, but on every other level is a very respectable adaptation. It is available now in the UK (DVD, Blu-Ray) and USA (DVD, Blu-Ray).",1347062400,,4035,4.900439238653002

If I might have some insight it might be that this is a movie about being able to hold onto your morality while defending yourself against enemies that cannot be redeemed.

That said, having seen the movie is NOT having read the book. In her novels Ms. Collins examines her heroine's motivations and relationships in a way impossible in visual media.

At first I was expecting just a single view version, but it is available whenever I want to watch online. The DVD could always be gifted. Glad Amazon thought of this great idea and hope to see it offered on other movies in the future!",1346976000,,579,4.601941747572815

4948189,4,B0063FQREO,"I made sure I read the book before I saw the move. I pre-ordered the blue-ray, and was eagerly anticipating an awesome movie. The movie was good but not great. The acting was up to par, but it would have been a far better movie if it had stuck to the story line of the book. I'm not implying that the movie needed to be more graphic or violent or depict the nudity or adult situations presented in the book. When you consider all of the press Harry Potter and the Half-blood Prince got when it came out in 2009, and that it was not appropriate for children and rated PG. This movie was appropriate at a PG-13, but I think toning it down from the book did the author a disservice. For as long as the movie is, I was disappointed on how much they left out. They should have followed the lead of something like Lord of the Rings and been more true to the series. Hopefully they will step it up for the second film.",1346976000,,911,4.123595505617978

I do recommend reading the books however, first, or at least read ""Hunger Games"" before you see the movie. It makes the movie even better, because you will then know all that happens that is not depicted in the movie. In the movie, there was only a couple things that I noticed that had been changed as far how the books were written, and that is to do with the Mockingjay Pin presentation. I will not say more, as I do not want to issue a spoiler. It was only different, not enough to change the story. And Catnip had gray eyes in the book. No big deal. There were a few things I would have liked to see done differently, and would have liked to see more of certain characters, but all in all, I still give it five stars. Prim and Rue are so, so beautiful, and I really had hoped to see much more depiction of them, especially Rue, since she...well...again, I don't want to spoil it for others who have not seen/read the story.
And if any of you have become Suzanne Collins fans, you owe it to yourselves to read ""The Underlander Chronicles."" Five books, starting with ""Gregor The Overlander."" I will say no more.

Several of my much younger friends, 12-25 years old, had suggested it after knowing I had read and seen all of the TWILIGHT series.  The HUNGER GAMES is in no way anything like the TWILIGHT series.  Twilight is all about fiction and not a premonition of what the world could be in years to come.  The idea of killing people for national entertainment is beyond disturbing, and even more disturbing is that this type of material is watched and enjoyed by people.  The violence is not so much what is on the screen but rather the implied violence.  Donald Sutherland does an outstanding job representing inhumanity. I was offended by the material and very sorry that I spent the money for it.",1346976000,7,776,4.507142857142857

The writing was well done, laying out the story and maintaining the overlapping plots nicely.

While the primary group is living in the year 3000 technology. But yet when a riot breaks out they use water cannons instead of future tech stun guns or weapons? Did I miss something? Also why did none of the warriors I'll call them just follow the parachutes bringing items from sponsors? They make a loud noise so everyone can find them? Also sponsors of what?

4948215,5,B0063FQREO,"With author Suzanne Collins assisting in the screenwriting process, it's no surprise that the essence of the book is kept well intact. While avid fans of the book might argue for the inclusion of certain details or against the modification of some characters, the movie captures both the message and the mood of the book. The bleak rendering of District 12 is particularly effective, as is the excess of the Capitol. The vast majority of the casting is successful, particularly with Jennifer Lawrence as Katniss. (The stunning depth and range of her performance far outweigh any qualms critics may have regarding her less-than-emaciated physique.) Donald Sutherland portrays President Snow as calm, calculated, and thoroughly venemous, and Woody Harrelson imbues Haymitch with both cynicism and vulnerability. Elizabeth Banks' Effie is appropriately clueless, and Willow Shields creates a fragile Prim that is easily believable as the beloved younger sibling for whom Katniss would give her life.

The frantic point-of-view camera shots let the viewer experience the whole ordeal as Katniss does, first-hand and chaotic. The explicit depiction of her injuries, along with those of Peeta and the other tributes assures that the brutality of the games is never minimized. To the same end, the killings themselves are given proper weight by being graphic without being gruesome. The transition from Rue's death to the rioting in District 13 is poignant and compelling; it is only later in the book that this is implied as a catalyst, but to see it in ""real time"" allows the viewer to feel the outrage as it escalates and also to anticipate the impending rebellion. Another useful modification is the creation of the control room for the games; in the book, we are only provided with Katniss's speculations as to the game-makers' methods, but the cold and clinical setting shown in the movie emphasizes the disturbing disconnect between the manufactured arena and the very real horrors ocurring within it.

Finally, the final scene where President Snow pivots away from the control room screen showing the triumphant homecoming of the victors and marches up the stairs reminds the viewer that the dangers are far from over for Katniss and Peeta, and indeed, for the entire nation of Panem.

The DVD bonus features are well worth watching, particularly the segment where Donald Sutherland explains how he sees President Snow and his essential role in the film. It's also interesting to see how many of the stunts are done by the main actors themselves.",1346976000,,2547,5.162227602905569

We are faced with such destruction of the fabric of our freedoms, and this movie is a good snapshot of what it is to live under the conditions of tyrrany. It is a Godless and hopless society, and the only religion is a basic ""worship"" of the leadership, whose word is law, from whom life and death decisions are dropped like a used kleenex. The elitists have their usual opulence and surplus, and wave it in the face of those who produced it but cannot enjoy for themselves. The only hope portrayed there is revolution - to get out of the fenced, guarded territories and take back the land FOR THE PEOPLE. I can't help but make comparisons and draw parallels to our own world. I have watched this movie several times, and I am still struck by the same issues when I see it. The mindless masses following the leaders, the aloofness with which the tributes are disregarded - as they face certain death for ""public"" amusement...it is all part of the divide that exists when the 'high' are TOO HIGH and the low are hardly more than slaves, whose very existence can be snuffed at the whim of a higher level entity. A job is not what YOU might want to do, but what the STATE tells you IT NEEDS. Every person's economy is directly linked to those around them, and having enough food to live on is illegal since that would mean somehow getting something MORE than what the STATE allowed. I can't just say ""this is only a movie"", because it is all not fairy tales and imaginary monsters. Once you get it, you can never forget it, and everything you see going on around you is not the same anymore.

4948246,5,B0063FQREO,"Sure the movie is not exactly like the book, which I loved, but there are elements to the movie that imagine things that could have happened but we didn't get to learn about in the book because it was from one point of view. This is what I like most about books that become movies. I have found that I really enjoy seeing the things that weren't in the books and look for those things in the movies. It is also cool to see how others interpret the characters and scenes. Sure, I still have my own visions of how it all played out and how the characters looked, but I still love the movie and the movie maker's take on the book.",1346976000,,627,4.105691056910569
4948247,4,B0063FQREO,"I think they did a very good job making the book into a movie. You always loose some when you do so because some things don't translate easily.

They did a good job of casting in my opinion. I would ignore any comments of ""That was a bad choice for that role"" or ""That Char wasn't supposed to be (Black/Asian/Latino)""

I have a friend who's first reaction was ""They are supposed to be starving!"" They did ignore the issue. They could have played it up better without spending to much time on it.

Best Casting in the whole movie (IMHO) was Woody Harrelson as Haymitch. (Donald Southerland was second) But turn the man loose in the role. So many things that make Haymitch and Woody could have done well.",1346976000,,702,4.426356589147287

4948257,3,B0063FQREO,"After reading the hunger games series I was extremely excited to watch the film. But I must say, it was a decent attempt, but as usual the book is far better than the movie. I don't know if the production company thought showing children involved in the violence of the book would be upsetting to the Viewers or if they were shooting for a younger target audience like Harry potter, but the film lacks the edge of your seat feel that you get from the book. The moments of hopelessness, the pain, the transformation from human to beast of survival is not apparent in the movie. Like I said, a good attempt. Just lacking on some key elements in my opinion.",1346976000,,654,4.413223140495868

Secondly, they have taken/modifed alot of things out of the book. Why is the girl that got taken and mutilated completely missing? How is Katnis infinitly hydrated in the film? When it's evident and realistic that she was craving for water everyday. Katnis and Rue weren't convincing me at all in the movie..They got like, what? 1 minute screen time max? When Rue died in the book my heart nearly sank, but when she dies in this movie it's not convincing or emotional because it seemed like they only just met each other. I don't remember them even talking about each others personal life or the birds. Overall this was a letdown.",1346976000,,853,4.509677419354839
4948259,4,B0063FQREO,"While it was a good move. nonreaders of the series may not find it very compeling.
 As always the book was so much better.
As this is ofen the case. The relationships were not understood. The interactions between caracters was poorly portrayed.
Hence it just comes off as a cruel movie with odd people being wounded and as they won 1 battle they just are not human enough to create as much empathy needed to keep engaged.

4948262,5,B0063FQREO,"There has been a lot of buzz circulating around The Hunger Games, all for good reason! I once had a friend who did not wish to watch the movie because he had a hard time imagining that a movie about killing children being a spectacle wouldn't be a spectacle in itself, glamorizing the activity. I asked him to watch it and he did, after he agreed completely with me, it is an amazing movie that does an excellent job of conveying vulnerability and the goodness of people, no matter how cruel the world. Such a powerful story and with such depth, even without reading the book!

The Bluray/DVD contains plenty of extras on how the film was made and gives fascinating insight on how different things were done for specific reasons to keep ""the feel"" right.

4948273,5,B0063FQREO,"First off, I haven't read the books, so all I knew about ""The Hunger Games"" was from movie reviews. Therefore the movie was quite different from what I was expecting. I expected far more action and violence, more of ""teen film"", and was not prepared for the ""Romeo & Juliet"" love story. After the first viewing I would have rated the movie a 3 simply because it wasn't what I expected. However, some movies just grab a hold of you and insinuate themselves into your thoughts. I had the same experience with ""Dune"". So I watched the movie again the next night. This time I was enthralled. I can't comment on how well the movie captures the book, but once I understood what was going on it all fell together. Great acting, great directing, actually a rather interesting story and marvelous computer graphics. As with ""Dune"", having a basic understanding of where the movie was headed made all the difference. Obviously a sequel will be coming and I look forward to it with great anticipation. I may even buy the book. I might add, just so you know where I'm coming from that I'm 62 years old. Happy Hunger Games!",1346976000,,1110,4.555

4948280,4,B0063FQREO,"It's the Hunger Games, what's not to love. If you read the books I'm sure you'll enjoy the movie. That said, the reason for the four star is because of the digital copies. I love the fact that we now have a digital copy in our amazon account. This is great cause we don't have to get up to find the blue-ray disc when wanting to watch it. We can just power on the PS3 or Kindle fire.

What bummed me out was the Ultraviolet (uvvu.com) digital copy. We have an Ultraviolet account, in fact we usually look for movies that have the ultraviolet copy.  Our luck has been that we've been able to register the movies via the UVVU.com website & then stream them on our devices using flixster. Well this one requires for you to set up with iTunes or setup a VUDU account in order to add it to your Ultraviolet account. Believe it or not, our media hungry household doesn't use any of those avenues. The last thing I wanted to do was open/create another media account & to have to remember another password.

Too many changes from book to script changes the out come for the reader turned movie goer. The movie was hard to follow for someone who has never read the books. For those of us who read the books, it was such a deviation that it did not make any sense. For example, the books spent some time explaining the significance of the Mocking Jay pendant that Katniss wore, a parting gift from a ""friend"" in District 12. The movie shows Katniss ""buying"" the pin at the Hob. Later in the books we find out that the Pin was from one of Katniss's mothers' friends...who died in the arena...and brings even more meaning to the pin itself as a symbol of the struggle against the Capitol. Another  example of Hollywood making their own ""interpretation"" of the book is the song that Rue and Katniss share with the Mocking Jays in the Arena...it is very significant in the books and the writers of the script blow it off, not to mention the lack luster way the foley guys kind of blow it off in the sound department...Truly a sad adaptation of a really good book.

Much of it being Katniss' thoughts which play a big role in her character. A lot of missing important scenes, especially the fact that Peetah is near death at the end of the hunger games in the book but in the movie he is normal. He loses a leg in the book...that is something very important that comes to play in the next 2 books yet the movie writers left it out completely from the movie. Still, it was a good movie and I cannot wait for ""Catching Fire"" to come out.",1346889600,,631,3.9375

4948312,5,B0063FQREO,"Dark and fascinating story about how the unfettered power of government can quickly spiral out of control. As disturbing as the images of children killing children are the underlying theme of a government that can use  ""bread and circuses"" to control the masses is even more chilling. The characters are portrayed well by the actors in the film and it is an entertaining film.",1346889600,,376,4.875

4948344,5,B0063FQREO,"This story was translated well from the book by the same name!  The characters are well-cast and convincing, making for an excellent potential ending of victims-turned-heroes at the hands of the twisted totalitarian state or an equally plausible (and understandable) end resolution of surrendering to the overwhelming nature of the games without any personal guilt!  Without spoiling the plot, the two face the challenge posed by the Nazi-like state of being reduced to mere complicit drones, forced to play an immoral game of kill or be killed or to somehow seek an alternate route to preserve their humanity.  It does not disappoint and cries out for a continued peek into their ongoing destinies!  Highly recommended!",1346889600,,720,5.234782608695652

4948348,5,B0063FQREO,"Loved the movie. I didn't read the book and was afraid that it was going to be one of those bloody epics like the titan movies but was pleasantly surprised.

Woody Harrelson surprised me with an outstanding performance. As expected, Jennifer Lawrence showed that she is an extremely talented actress. She was outstanding as Ree in ""Winter's Bone"" and certainly equaled her performance as Katnis Everdeen. Expecting to see another Oscar Nomination here.

After reading some of the poor reviews I decided to read the book and see what they are all complaining about. I agree that the book is much more detailed than the movie. It spends a lot of time explaining the past and goes into more detail during the games itself. I also agree that reading the book first will make the movie more understandable; however to cover all that detail in the movie would make it about 6 or more hours long. The movie follows the book with very few exceptions. The biggest one being how Katniss gets the mockingjay pin but it doesn't affect the story line at all. I totally disagree that the acting was poor. The characters are portrayed as weird in the movie because they are a perfect match to the characters in the book.
Even though i would recommend that you read the book first, whether you do or not doesn't change my 5 star rating. I bought the 3 book trilogy at Amazon at a very reasonable price and am in the process of reading volume 2 ""Catching fire""",1346889600,,1460,4.590038314176245
4948349,5,B0063FQREO,The movie is amazing and can't wait for the sequels!  I can't believe the acting coming out of such young kids!,1346889600,,111,4.285714285714286

4948351,3,B0063FQREO,didn't care for all the killing of children but the story was ok....bizarre....should have stuck more with the books.  most of the actors did good job,1346889600,,150,4.769230769230769
4948352,4,B0063FQREO,"After reading the Hunger Games book, I was so excited for the movie.  It was excellent, but not quite up to par with the book.  There were several changes, but I also understand some of them were in order to keep the movie as first person viewpoint as possible and provide us with insight from Katniss' head that we should not have otherwise understood.  The actual events in the Games were pretty true to the book.  However, I thought the relationship between Katniss and Peeta was totally underplayed and have heard comments from people who haven't read the book about the confusion over how Katniss feels about Peeta.  Overall, a good movie and I'm glad to own it!",1346889600,,667,4.61864406779661
4948353,5,B0063FQREO,"This movie, that I saw first in the movie theater is a great movie. New ideas in the drama, a lot of adventures and new ideas in the handling of the actors and actresses. There is always a lot of intrigue and difficult tasks, but the problem solving comes quiet natural, despite that the movie handles quiet some science fiction.
I am happy that there will be some more Hunger Games 2 and most probably more sequences. It a great story.",1346889600,,436,4.395061728395062

I love that Amazon gave me the digital copy free with my order(only reason that it is a 3 and not a 2)...but there are no deleted scenes, I'm sorry but that's a real deal breaker. This DVD should be a 2, it's a 3 for Amazon, but it's really a 2. It needs something extra, something that makes it worthwhile. 2 minutes of extra footage would have made this a 5...I only bought it because I'm addicted to the series.",1346889600,,451,4.078651685393258
4948355,2,B0063FQREO,"The hype for this movie worked.  I was excited to finally see the big movie.  Well I learned that they spend most of the movie on advertising.  With big actors in the movie with good writing, but movies showed all these lead to a boring and a surprising under eventful movie.

4948356,2,B0063FQREO,"I've read all three books and was looking forward to the movie I purchased.  I'm aware it's hard to make a movie from such an outstanding book such as the Hunger Games series.  With that being said, I was VERY disappointed in the movie.  It was a VERY poor example of what might have been done with that book.  It covered such a few actual chapters of the Hunger Games story line and much of the information was incorrect (e.g.  Madge gave Katniss the mockingjay pin NOT Prim).  The actors were poorly chosen from the mental description from the book (e.g. Woody Harrelson as Haymich.  PLEASE!!!  How insulting).  I'll not watch nor purchase any other of the series books movies if they are made.  The books were AWESOME!!!  I compare the accuracy to the movie made of Clan of the Cave Bear.  It was ALSO a poor example of a GREAT book by Jean Auel!!!!  I've not talked to even one person who really liked the movie compared to the book and they are also not willing to purchase another butchered movie!!!!",1346889600,,1006,4.461538461538462

I thank you for bringing it on screen! It showed me just how lucky I am..we all are.. to live in the world we do live in, even with all the ""stuff"" that is going on, good and bad.

4948363,5,B0063FQREO,"This was long awIted at my house!  I took my kids age 11 and 12 to the midnight premiere when this was released at the theater and was worried if it was age appropriate (the younger one had read it in school!).  While the overall premise is a bit disturbing, the movie is extremely well done and thought provoking.  It was a great launching pad for discussion after the film  (you can search the Internet for lots of talking points).  Yep, there's violence, but it's generally shot with a moving camera, so those scenes are fast and not so focused.  My oldest in particular was counting the days until the blu-ray release.

How about age appropriate for a middle aged man and woman who usually fall asleep half way through the movie?  We both stayed awake TWICE!  This story is not just another regurgitated twist to a story already told.

4948389,4,B0063FQREO,"I actually give this film 4.5-stars. While book to motion picture films are rarely as good or comparable to the original story in the book, I actually felt this film did the book justice. It's a longer motion picture (close to two and a half hours in length), but the pace of the story keeps you riveted to your seat in a way that one doesn't really notice the time passing. Also the cinematography, make-up, and special effects combine to make this film a stunning visual adaptation of the story. And it doesn't hurt that the film's execs made wise choices for the actors who portray the characters. Donald Sutherland always seems in top form, as does Stanley Tucci and Woody Harrelson, just to name a few. This DVD covers the first book in the trilogy and I'm already looking forward to the film adaptations for the next two books.

The movie The Hunger Games was an exception.  The first thing that impressed me was the casting.  It was extraordinary.  It was almost as thought the parts were written for the actors who were chosen.  The actress in the lead role is an exceptionally talented young lady who I have seen on only one other movie: ""Winter Bone"".  She is so talanted that I will watch for movies with her in them in the future.  If you liked the book you will like the movie.

The book is not real complex and you would think that it would be a simple thing to make the film and not change things.  This movie, like many, not only leaves out alot of things, it changes plot lines for no apparent reason.  For those who have not read the book the movie will be very entertaining. If you have read the book be advised that the movie leaves out most of the sub-plots and changes others. Unfortunately, this has become all to common with movies based on novels.

Movie should have had about 10-15 minutes put back in that were probably left on the cutting room floor. Additional scenes or longer scene transitions would have made the story line smoother. Parents, do not let pre-teens or youger see this. Movie should have had an ""R"" rating due to the violence. This is a ""Lord of the Flies"" type movie without the class or insights.

It seemed the movie was fast forwarded.  I realize that a movie is 1-2 hours and only so much can come from a book that takes all day to read.  But a few more scenes about Katnis' true love, a little more about her sister, a little more about the fights in the arena, a little more of what led up to the Captitol taking over the Hunger Games would have been good.

4948430,3,B0063FQREO,"The long-awaited (by some, not me) screen adaptation of the first novel in the 'Hunger Games' trilogy was a pleasant way to spend a couple of hours. Plot and character development sometimes played second fiddle to the heavy-handed anti-establishment theme that undoubtedly made it so appealing to its intended audience. Other than the two tribute characters from district 12 and their drunken mentor, the other characters were puppets populating a wooden vista against which the drama played out. I wasn't expecting a lot, so the visual affects were a very pleasant surprise. Tarantino doesn't have to worry about being replaced in the action-adventure genre by Gary Ross, but his action sequences were 'OK'. I know this is a tepid review, but there wasn't much to get excited about. If you have a couple of hours to spare, by all means stream it, but I wouldn't watch it again so I wouldn't purchase the DVD.",1346889600,,909,4.909090909090909

SO, because I went in with that expectation, I LOVED the movie! The only complaint I have heard from people who have read the books is that there was not enough violence in the film.

4948442,3,B0063FQREO,"I watched the movie & I liked it because it was something different.  It was somewhat of a Sci-Fi type of movie. I think it appeals more to a less mature audience. Teenagers will love it, especially if they are fans of Josh Hutcherson & Jennifer Lawrence. The movie was well done & it had it's ups & downs. I'm sure if you watch it you will enjoy it.  I don't think it's Oscar worthy but all in all it was a pretty good, different kind of movie.  It was something like the Avatar movie but not nearly as good.  I gave it 3 stars but I'm sure kids between the ages of 10 - 15 will probably give it 5 stars.",1346889600,,605,3.9344262295081966
