8367966,5,B002EP8FGU,"We saw this movie at the National Gallery of Art several years ago. I am Belgian and I wanted my daughters to experience the St. Nick traditions I grew up with. My daughters were six when they saw it and they loved it. Back then it was not available on DVD. I'm delighted that it is now. It is a lovely depiction of the St. Nicholas/Sinterklaas tradition in The Netherlands and Belgium. This story follows the movie ""Winky's Horse"" which we own and also love. There is nothing objectionable in either of these movies. Appropriate for children who still believe and those who don't. A perfect DVD to start the holiday season and introduce the children to a different culture. I am about to purchase this DVD, so I don't know whether it is an issue here, but my only minor gripe is that the DVD ""Winky's Horse"" sold by Amazon did not contain the original soundtrack in Dutch. Even the traditional Sinterklaas songs are translated into English, which really doesn't sound right. At the NGA we saw the movie in Dutch with English subtitles. I wish that version were available on Amazon.",1291248000,4,1082,4.61139896373057
