5923945,5,B00EJXX2DQ,"This is a great DVD for any Doc McStuffins fan.  It is 2 whole hours of Doc McStuffins and her plush pals fun.  If your child has never seen the show, it is adorable!  The show features a little girl who has an awesome playhouse in her backyard that she calls ""The Clinic.""  In there she fixes up toys and interacts with all her own plush friends.  Her mom is a doctor and it is cute to see her follow in her mom's footsteps.  Even though these are episodes are ones my kids have seen on the Disney channel, my kids love that they can watch them anytime, anywhere.  There are 10 episodes that are sure to make any kids smile.  I honestly don't mind watching it with my kids, I think all the toys are so cute and fun to see interacting with each other!

5923946,5,B00EJXX2DQ,"My kids fell in love with Doc McStuffins from the time the first episode aired and they have been obsessed ever since. I was so excited to receive Time for Your Checkup and have it on DVD for all the times we go camping on on long car rides where they don't have access to regular TV.

Doc McStuffins is a loving, shining example of what a friend and Doctor should be. She is the only one that can ""hear"" her animals talk and see them move. They only come alive for her so she has the unique ability to help them cure their ailments.

My kids favorite part of this show is the funny names she comes up with for illnesses like ""Stuffedfulliosis."" I gave my daughter the Doc McStuffin's Doctor kit for Christmas and the cell phone and big book of boo-boos for Valentines Day. She loves to play Doctor with me and have me lay down on the couch. She gets out her big book of boo-boo's and diagnoses me with her version of illnesses like ""owie-itis."" I love that this show has spawned additional creativity to an age-old children's game like playing Doctor.

This DVD has five fun episodes that my kids can watch over and over again and it never gets old. They always think it's amazing when something they watch on TV comes out on DVD so they are pretty excited.

Doc McStuffins: Time for Your Checkup is the perfect addition to your DVD library for the Doc loving child in your house.",1366675200,11,1381,4.32046332046332
5923947,5,B00EJXX2DQ,"The moment that this DVD came into my house it was unwrapped and watched by my youngest who is a BIG Doc McStuffins fan. She loved each of the episodes, but she said her favorite was Gulpy, Gulpy Gators! I have to say that as a father, I am always looking for shows that promote good values that are consistent with my own and this series definitely fits the bill. I love the underlying messages within this series, with the most pronounced regarding helping others (but there are so many more). If you are a fan of this series, I highly encourage you to check out this great new DVD, as you too will be watching the episodes over and over again as I already am too!

I remember coming home from work one day and my mom telling me about how much Joley was in love with Doc McStuffins.  I had no idea what she was talking about, but it wasn't long before I learned all about the coolest doctor to toys around.  We recently were sent the new DVD, Time For Your Checkup to review and it has literally been on in the van for weeks.  I know every episode, every song.  I haven't really enjoyed a DVD or character as much as I have Doc McStuffins in a very long time, if ever.  I love this show!

I really can't tell you how much we love this DVD.  These episodes teach lessons about love, friendship, and compassion.  They also give your child little lessons (like being careful when playing) and are so much fun to watch.  The songs are catchy.  Truly, my girls and I sing the songs every day now.  When I had to take them to the doctor last week, we talked about the instruments on the way and how doc has them.  Then, when Jemma got upset, I sang one of Doc's songs to her.

I encourage you to grab this DVD for your summer travels or just because. **I received a copy of this DVD for review**",1369785600,,2171,4.494897959183674

5924036,5,B00EJXX2DQ,"This is from Disney Jr.  Doc McMuffins is popular with young children.  It also teaches kindness to animals when Doc McMuffins takes such good doctor care for her toy animals and dolls. May help a child when he or she visits the doctor or dentist.  Recommend this DVD.  It is Disney quality, excellent.",1368921600,2,302,4.6415094339622645
5924037,4,B00EJXX2DQ,"The word ""interactive"" is tossed around in the entertainment world constantly, as established media faces off with online and other new markets, but Doc McStuffins delivers in a very special way.

McStuffins doesn't have the ""pause and wait for answer"" feature of such shows as Dora the Explorer, Blue's Clues and even Disney's Mickey Mouse Clubhouse. The interaction happens when -- hopefully at some time during the day -- the TV is turned off and kids begin to play on their own. Doc McStuffins is such an approachable concept, young girls and boys can let their imaginations take off, just as they see on this show.

The premise is that Doc solves problems, fixes toys and cures plush, as her toys come to life in her imagination. This is the kind of thing that is healthy and addresses the concerns about watching too much TV. Basic health and wellness issues are also woven into the stories.

8606185,1,B00EJXX2DQ,At the time I bought this it did not state it could not be played on US DVD players.  I waited thinking I could eventually play it if I got another player.  That didn't happen so I contacted the seller and they are denying my refund or replacement.  Don't buy from this seller and only buy from Amazon LLC as those DVD's you can play with no issue.  Upon contacting Disney I was told these are second DVD's!  On the barcode look for the little scissors and Proof Of Purchase and that is a Disney DVD and is a legitimate movie.  Wish I could give this a no star as this item is trash.,1507680000,,583,4.0701754385964914

8606189,5,B00EJXX2DQ,"The Doc McStuffins movies are great for young children.  They are entertaining as well as educational. They teach children about taking care of pets, and the importance of Vet visits. I think it has helped my grand daughter to view her pets in a different light, and to realize that pets are also family members. I recommend these movies for all children or grand children.",1456012800,,373,4.7384615384615385
