8341580,5,B001TIQURY,"Good value for money, as the Brits say, because this is actually a two disc set.  These are erotic send-ups of the James Bond movie series; these display a great deal more flesh, though.  That said, they differ markedly from American ""porno"" enough that they are worth a view, if the sight of naked human bodies doesn't disgust you.  Of course, you'll get more out of them if you're fluent in Danish.",1407369600,,400,4.527777777777778

8341582,4,B001TIQURY,"Who knew that Danes are so funny? Not me...until now.

This is a hard-core double feature with two films from a kind of James Bond-Benny Hill cross about the goings-on by secret agents from around the globe. At its center is bumbling Danish spy Jensen, Agent 69.

In original Danish (with several other languages, including English, sprinkled in due to the globetrotting plots), with a frenetic pace, you, like me, probably will understand fully only about a third of these movies. And that's with the subtitles turned on. But if you're also like me, you won't even care and will enjoy the heck  out of them anyway.

What's to like? Even though I'm not a fan of slap-stick comedy, this series does it so well that it's way less Chris Farley or Jim Carrey and way closer to British humor: silly but not overstated and never annoying. I've never seen American comedy pull this off effectively because our creators are too stupid to do slap-stick that doesn't involve millions of toilet jokes. Probably because our audiences are too stupid to appreciate slap-stick that doesn't involve millions of toilet jokes.

And I haven't even mentioned yet the incredibly hot women that are running around naked and willing everywhere through these two movies. Wow!! I've seen German, French and Italian films of the same era and in no case do the women look like these: Gorgeous, all-natural, but glory be, CONTROLLED BODY HAIR! In other words smooth underarms and smooth under the uh...well, you know the area. An area that you will see not infrequently in these two films.

These ARE hard-core, so if that offends,  move along...although the scenes are pretty limited and in some of the scenes (though definitely not all) it's pretty clear that doubles are being used. But even these are played for laughs, and effectively at that. If our porn industry would get a clue and start producing stuff like this it would legitimize itself overnight.

The pacing of these (and I keep coming back  to this) is very Benny Hill-esque, pretty much exhausting the audience which does make them hard to follow at times even if the language barriers themselves don't do that enough as it is. But again, you won't care much. The quality is tremendous. ""In the Sign of the Sagittarius,"" though it's the first film presented,  was the last in this series and is slightly harder to understand than ""In the Sign of the Scorpio."" The casts of each film is virtually the same although a large portion of the actors and actresses change roles.

I really can't say enough great things about this. The only real negative to me is that there wasn't much of anything extra included, and I would have loved to have seen interviews with the cast  or producers, perhaps a commentary track. That's all that's keeping this from a five-star review in my book.",1392249600,3,2816,4.771604938271605
8341583,5,B001TIQURY,"This movie (Scorpio) has a strong plot, unlike most pornography, its basically a humorous farce and also unlike most pornography the humour works.  The girls are drop dead gorgeous, there is a small amount of graphic sex (a few minutes) which could really be deleted.  There is a fabulous choreographed nude dance and numerous other sight gags.  The dvd comes with english subtitles and had it been dubbed it might have made quite a success, or not, as Americans seem to have entirely different sensibilities to Europeans.  Having said that I probably have only watched it through twice as aspects of it are quite confronting, and as I said could just as easily be deleted leaving it as a piece of harmless fun.  This film is produced by professionals, contrast that with amateur movie making mainly concerned with labored, tedious and mechanical sex devoid of any human qualities which sums up the vast majority of pornography.  The other feature Sagittarius is not as good, nor are the others in the series.",1388707200,3,1009,4.871345029239766
