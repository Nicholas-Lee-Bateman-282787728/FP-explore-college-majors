1731080,5,B0000694XO,"This is the first Israeli movie that I saw and I wish that more would be released on a wide scale in the US. I am not even sure that this was available to audiences in the US, as I saw it in London, and when it returned to the US, many had not heard of it. The cast comprised superb actors, the script was phenomenal, and the cinematography was brilliant (an extra character of its own).

""Time of Favor"" explores the issue of moral responsibility. In this movie, it is depicted as a topic vital to natioanl security interests, as interred by the members of the military, but the issue is relevant to all who interact with society. An Israeli friend of mine once said that Isareal is a sate of many different nations and the people all are forced to become one state while serving in the army. This happens to a similar (but less dramatic degree when conscription is not required) extent in all armies.

The movie follows the creation of a regiment comprised soley of people from similar religious interpretations, which would theorectically mean that this regiment is representative of only one nation in Israel; those that join that particular regiment are those who attend services at a Rabbi's synagoue who often stresses the importance of pursuing manifest destiny as religious obligation. Matters take a tragic turn when a member of the regiment conceives of a plan to actively pursue the policy.

Too often Israel is perceived as a monolithic society. Cedar's film reveals the complexity that constitutes the country. There are deep divisions and suspicions between those who consider themselves devoutly religious and those who consider themselves secular. The two sides often look down at one another and there are difficutlties in them hearing each other in the formation if Israeli policy that is suppsoe to protect the state as a whole. Even within the seemingly coherent religious communities, there are different interpretations of which way to proceed, which is not always realized unless memebrs take matters into their own hand.

When the authorities question the people they believe responsible, the Rabbi is investigated. He believes he is innocent, arguing that he never should have been taken literally. Which raises the important question of who is morally responsibile when causualites are inflicted in the name of relgiion or politics? How much credit is to be assumed by the individual who pursues these beliefs with little or no explicit guidance? How much blame should be ascribed to societal institutions which teach rhetoric about the importance of empire and obligations people should assume for insuring security of a way of life?

This film provides fodder for a timely discussion considering the current trials of Americans who are being investigated for torturing Iraqi. The accused claim that they were following orders; the higher ups say no such specific orders were given. So many Americans endorse policies in Israel which they believe will hasten the second coming, according to their religous leaders and with little regard for the impact that the policies will have on the welfare of Israeli citizens; preaching about the need to rebuild the Temple - even though doing so would entail destroying a relgious landmark for Muslims and exacerbating conflict in the region.

On a less original level, the film also examines the coneseqences on friendship that a love triangle imposes, when two best firends fall in love with the same woman, one of whom her traditional father (the Rabbi) wants her to marry, but unfortunately for her, the Rabbi's favorite is not the one that she loves. It is questionable as to how much of the plan was constructed purely to pursue a perceived religious obligation, as opposed to contributing to the down fall of man who became the object of affection of a woman that the plan's architect wanted to marry. The motivation of what contributes people to commit desperate acts that can be defniend as ""terrorist plots,"" is another revelvant theme in modern times. How much are actions motivated by belief in relgion? How much is the pursuit of such actions motivated by a sense of hopelessness in the future or revenge?

This is a movie that should be bought because it is the type that can be watched again and again, and each viewing brings greater depth and raises new questions - the hallmark of a truly great film",1107216000,24,4385,4.93360433604336
1731081,4,B0000694XO,"Director/writer Joseph Cedar has crafted a fast paced, riveting thriller around the current themes of ethnic and religious tension in Israel; throw in a love triangle, and you have a nifty, highly entertaining film.

The cast is attractive and the acting excellent, among them Tinkerbell, who plays the love interest, and Idan Alterman (a television comic in Israel) as the rabbi's favorite student Pini, and Abraham Celektar and Amnon Volf as the soldiers Itamar and Mookie, but the two who are most memorable are Aki Avni, who is fabulous as the main hero Menachem (and is a major hunk as well), and Assi Dayan as Rabbi Meltzer.

Dayan gained fame in 1968, when John Huston chose the handsome actor to co-star in ""A Walk with Love and Death"" (he was known as Assaf Dayan then) and also for his heritage, as his father was the famous general with an eye-patch, Moshe Dayan. Dayan is a multi-talented man, and is brilliant here, as he teaches his students that ""whoever does not know that sometimes a dead lion is more alive than the living dog will stay a dog"".

The plot of this film concerning the Temple Mount has been around for ages of course, and was one of the central teachings of Meir Kahane (who was gunned down on a NYC street by an Egyptian in 1990), and he had a surprising amount of support, and not just from ""the crazies"".

Because of its theme, this film will also appeal to people who have an interest in the ""end times"" and apocalyptic Bible prophesy, and it is refreshingly free of nudity and bedroom scenes.

The script for this award winning film is above average, the cinematography by Ofer Inov very effective, and the score by Jonathan Bar-Giora terrific; the final piece that plays with the credits is fantastic...those in the habit stopping before the credits run, should not miss this song.

This is a film that gets better with repeated viewings, and total time is 102 minutes.",1105056000,28,1907,4.660714285714286
1731082,4,B0000694XO,"The real star of 'Time of Favor' is cinematographer Ofer Inov.  About half the movie takes place at night & the actors appear bathed in an almost bluish tint, with glowing eyes.  It's a superb effect.
I can see why this movie swept the Israeli version of the Oscars for films released in 2000.  It's a well-told, gripping saga of a confrontation between the religious and secular forces that push for ascendancy in Israel.  Contrary to what we may think back here in the States, there's a healthy skepticism and mistrust in many parts of Israeli society of the ultra-religious, especially when mixed into national institutions like the Army.
Throw in West Bank settlement politics, a messianic rabbi, his flowering daughter, an unbalanced star Torah student, a studly company commander, the Mossad, a star-crossed love triangle...and you've got yourself a very compelling movie.
My only problem:  the ending is a little too melodramatic and over the top; but it's still a good ride.
'Time of Favor' is in Hebrew with English subtitles.  The subtitles are very legible and well-timed.  Certain untranslatable words and concepts are transliterated from Hebrew and presented in quotes.  All in all, the subtitled version of the film loses none of the emotion and subtlety of the original.",1058486400,79,1285,5.056872037914692
1731083,5,B0000694XO,"In a nutshell, this movie is a critisism on a struggle between the religious and secular Israelis, with two young people in love stuck in the middle.
The religious leader is portrayed as somewhat clueless, arrogant man, the extreme of religious self-righteuosness who loves to get his way with no regard for his own family. A love-struck, gullible student sees the teachings of his mentor as command to violence.
The secular military sees any religious manifestation as a possible threat. They can't understand why the orthodox soldiers are so eager to serve. They see no need to understand the faithfull and have no qualms about accusing an innocent man of a crime, simple because he comes from a religious background.
The two lovers in the storyline are trapped between the two worlds.
Bear in mind that THE PLOT USES THE EXTREME OF BOTH SIDES. It does a great job of showing the worst part of the struggle in Israel today. It favors no one. Instead it blames the fundamental ignorance of the extremists on both ends of the spectrum.
The acting, cinematography and the storyline are superb.  To truly appreciate this film one must stop to think and comprehend what the writers are trying to tell you.",1052611200,6,1202,4.806763285024155
1731084,4,B0000694XO,"Director Cedar has produced an exciting and frightening film which helps us see how natural hateful religious mania has become in Eretz-Yisrael. It is only through the agency of a person despised by traditional Yahaduth, a woman, that a horrible disaster is averted. Some reviewers have questioned the director's knowledge of Judaism. I cannot address that. But I am reminded, in this context, of the anecdote concerning Hillel's answer to the skeptic who asked him teach him the Torah while he, the skeptic, stood on one leg. Hillel is said to have replied, ""The essence of the Torah is this: what is hateful to you, do not do to your fellow man. All the rest is commentary. Go and learn it."" And this the Jewish daughter knew, when her learned father did not. Thanks to Cedar for bringing this valuable Jewish lesson before an audience which perhaps only sought a thrill and a confirmation of their prejudices.",1052179200,5,912,4.8152866242038215
1731085,3,B0000694XO,"This is a real exciting movie about some God fearing people who try to do God's work in the world. They can rebuild the Temple, but first they have to blow up the stuff that is there now and transfer the bad people. So they almost succeed!
People who like ""Left Behind"" will like this, most of it.
The only bad parts are the nice Rabbi's daughter, who is disobedient. She does all sorts of bad things. Some are really obscene! If it were not for her, we could have the Second Coming! It just goes to show you, how bad it is when people question their parents and even God's Word.",1051920000,3,579,4.178571428571429
1731086,4,B0000694XO,"Once in awhile when my roommate and I get a little free time we head down to the video rental store to watch a few movies and I rarely expect to find a movie about Israel or the Middle East that doesn't focus on terrorists and silly Hollywood plots about what they think the Middle East is like (Hollywood does a horrible job of depicting both Arabs and Jews). To my surprise, the last time we went I saw a slick movie case with Hebrew on it extolling the virtues of this Israeli-made film that won quite a few awards. On that whim, we rented ""Time of Favor"" and hoped for the best.
The film is the story of a small religious community from the Yesha (a Hebrew abbreviation of the combination of the words Judia and Samaria, the ancient biblical names of the area the popular press likes to call the West Bank) and their decision to form their own unit when compulsorily enlisting in the Israeli army. In Israel, everyone does national service in the army or for a governmental organization (including women, the handicapped, and a few other groups with a few exceptions). Most recruits serve in a unit local to the area the live in and stay together as a unit until old age finally renders no longer fit to serve as soldiers. ""Time for Favor"" puts forward a hypothetical situation (to my knowledge) of having an entire religious community serves together in one infantry unit. The unit's officer explains that the Druze and Bedouin have their own units in the army, why not the religious Jews?
The movie's plot revolves around a love triangle between the Rabbi's daughter, Michal, the captain of the community's army unit, Menachem, and the Rabbi's most promising student, Pinchas or Pini, also a soldier in the community's army unit. At the same time, there is a political plot by some of the fundamental members of the Yesha community to blow up the Dome of the Rock, the Islamic Temple built upon the ruins of the Jewish Temples from Biblical history. There is also an additional plot extolling the stresses of Michal and her father, Rabbi Meltzer. At one point she explains that she can't forgive her father for bringing her mother out to the Yesha, which had no toilets at the time, while she had cancer and wanted to live in the city, but the Rabbi wouldn't go. He said that if he left, the community would fall part. In addition, there is another plot direction in which Menachem struggles with his conscience as to what to do about Michal whom he loves, Pini, who is his friend and also loves Michal, and the eventual plot to destroy the Muslim Dome of the Rock.
Thankfully in the midst of the serious drama, there is some comic relief. The army unit has a secular Jewish member, Mookie, who can't understand how the religious soldiers can push themselves so hard. He finally breaks down and asks one of the religious Jews how they do it, who explains that they do it ""For Something,"" a Hebrew phrase that explains that they have a reason for living and it all leads back to God. Or to draw it out, they are soldiers so that they can live, they live so that they can study Torah (what Christians call the Old Testament), and they study Torah to serve God. It's an elaborate answer for a secular person who lives in a two-dimensional world. Part of Mookie's comedy comes from his base ways, always eating and drinking even under field conditions.
The acting, overall, was very good. Tinkerbell (Yes, that's her real actress name!) who plays Michal did a haunting job in the role, expressing angst in a way I expect from German or Russian art films. I'm not sure if she is supposed to be a sex symbol because throughout the film she has dark bags around her eyes and looks more sick and tired than healthy and sexily vibrant. I wonder if her appearance was one of the film's more subtle messages. Aki Avni, who plays Menachem, and Idan Alterman, who plays Pini, both played charismatic likable characters. I enjoyed their acting. Rabbi Meltzer, played by Assi Dayan (Is he Moshe Dayan's son?), was also very good and convincing in his role.
Some other reviewers have explained that the film is about suicide bombing, Hellish clerics from the Abrahamic religions, Israeli settlers, or other ideas that don't capture what the film is really about. The film is about the conscience of Israel and the hard choices that get made there every day. It's ethics at its' most poignant, choices with elements of both right and wrong, where no answer is best or obviously correct.
Using the term ""settlers"" is very misleading when used to refer to communities in the Yesha. Jews are no more settlers in Israel than Native Americans who live off of reservations in the USA are ""settlers."" The Jews have been in Israel since long before the Romans tried to rename the land Palestine, Islam existed as a religion, or even before the idea of nationalism arose in the Arab countries as expressed through men like Arafat.
Overall, I enjoyed the movie, but got the impression that the director, Joseph Cedar, is a secular Israeli Jew and that he really doesn't practice Judaism as a religion. His depiction of the religious Jews in the Yesha wasn't very favorable, which I felt was incorrect for a brave and dedicated people. It certainly appears the the director doesn't have much of a grasp of what Judaism is about. Sure there are nuts in the midst of any group of people, but I felt the film didn't do the Israeli communities in the Yesha justice.
I recommend ""Time of Favor,"" but not highly.

1731087,4,B0000694XO,"Despite occasional implausibilities in characterization and an ordinary if vivid cinematography (Hollywoodish), this film is definitely worth seeing. This is a thriller centering around a plot to blow up the Al Aqsa mosque, a plot instigated among three naive and good-natured IDF boys by an Ultra-Orthodox settler rabbi who claims he seeks to hasten the arrival of the Moshiakh. Who would have predicted, even so late as the end of World War II, that a mere cleric could precipitate a hell on earth by manipulating antiquated religious dogmas? And yet we know that this is one of the principal hazards of our time, and in fact can arise anywhere among the numerous fanatics who infest all three of the major Abrahamic religions.
Aside from the assured, evasive and malevolent rabbi, the best performance is rendered by Tinkerbell in her portrayal of his independant and ethical daughter. She achieves, among other things, a highly effective and dignified love scene, cinematically the height of the film.",1031788800,4,1005,5.134146341463414

1731124,4,B0000694XO,"This movie has a very unique and intriguing plot involving labyrinths of tunnels under Jerusalem, politics of Jewish settlements, complexities of Israeli society, yearning for the Third Temple in Jerusalem, two friends wanting the same girl and more.  It is in Hebrew with English subtitles.

It's a story of two friends, religious Jews from a settlement. The first one is Menachem who was sent to the army for training in order to become a commander over a newly conceived religious company.  There is a radical rabbi who stands behind the creation of the company made up of his students and followers.  The other friend is Pini who is the rabbi's top student at the yeshiva. As a prize for his best student the rabbi plan to give his oldest daughter Michal to Pini for wife.  The trouble is that Menachem and Michal have had an eye for each other for quite some time.

Well, things start when Menachem returns to form the company and train the first batch or religious soldiers.  Michal seeks opportunities to speak to Menachem and spend some time with him.  In the mean time she learn what her father has in mind for her and Pini.  Pini is all on cloud seven and when he gets with Menachem and Itamar, the three friends head for underground tunnels in Jerusalem like they used to.  They know the tunnels well and know where to go to a pool of water to bathe and how to get to the temple mound to take a peek at the Dome of the Rock.

Not to reveal to much of the plot and spoil the experience for you, let me just close with the fact that the rabbi's preaching to the soldiers in Menachem's company include talks of the Third Temple - the one that should be build in place of the Dome of the Rock. Oh and the folks from MOSSAD are having their own doubts about the rabbi and his idea of a religious company.  There are a few holes in the logic of the plot, but the story is so unique that it is easy to overlook.  It has a great plot, great story and is definitely worth watching.",1238198400,2,1983,4.327027027027027
1731125,4,B0000694XO,"Excellent movie. Very realistic depiction of a group of orthodox Israelis serving in the army as a separate unit (a lot of the fervently religious Israelis refuse to serve in the army, because they feel their mission on earth is to study Torah and perform all of its commandments-over 600 of them-daily, and therefore they would not be able to do so in the army). The movie shows all the tensions among the members of the unit regarding their attitude towards the Temple Mount in Jerusalem, with a love story in the background.

1731127,4,B0000694XO,"Since this flick came out 8 years ago, a lot has changed.
The West Bank settlers are marginalized as is the Israeli Left.
The issue then was holding onto ""captured/liberated"" territory depending on your definition or reducing/neutralizing an existential threat from the major Arab powers outside..seeing this movie yesterday, it is almost moot since in this post 911 scenario, Iraqi War,  Lebanon War, the real politic is now on containing nuclear threat from Iran not wishful idealist thinking in regard to rebuilding the Third Temple by blowing up the Islamic Dome Of The Rock by a bunch of religious seminary students who take their zeal from a Rabbi spewing forth not hatred of the ""other"" but idealism that blurs the distinction between the world of the senses and a  world beyond appearance.
It is in this context that the filmmaker is clever and insightful being able to portray Israel as either a haven for Jewish suffering whose goal is to be ""normal"" like anyone else concerned with pleasure and pain or the idealists whose vision of greater Israel as a divine birthright highlights the conflict and resolution between living in the world of experience or the world of the unknown. Israeli society is a fine example of this conflict and the filmmaker captures the tensions well between love of child or G-D, love of land or one's fellow tribesman,jealosy between friends in regard to love and basically seeing reality as reality despite the minds furnishing of it or seeing reality behind ideological blinkers that can distort or enhance again depending on perspective.
The acting is good all around, the action is fast paced catching real glimpses into Israel's religious Zionist Yeshiva world and settler mentality. The movie has nothing to do with Arab Jewish tension but is a careful snapshot of Israeli society years ago whose threat nowadays are the bombardment of it's citizens by the Gaza strip and the all too likelihood of a strike against Iran to maintain her security.",1214697600,5,1990,4.990963855421687
1731128,3,B0000694XO,"I think you have to be Israeli to fully understand this film, the implications of its message, and the motives of the filmmakers. From an outsider's point of view, it seems to take a secular perspective on what amounts to religion-inspired political extremism - in this case a scheme to destroy the al-Aqsa mosque built on the Temple Mount in Jerusalem, then occupying the site, apparently to make way for the building of the Third Temple, thereby ushering in the end of days. That anyone might regard this as an act of terrorism far beyond the scale of the attack on the World Trade Center seems (again to an outsider) outside the film's frame of reference. That not a single Palestinian character appears in the film, though it takes place in and around a West Bank settlement, says even more about the curious absence of a realistic context. As a portrayal of conflict between religious and secular Israelis, the film seems more like a parable or allegory than a story grounded in a plausible world.

An Israeli audience will surely more fully appreciate the characters, which (to me, again, as an outsider) do not come across with much depth. The father-daughter conflict, the love-triangle, the comic relief character all seem rather formulaic on the surface. I think you need to know Tinkerbell's other performances to appreciate this one; here her character seems morose and self-absorbed and not altogether plausible as the love interest of two men. The one compelling performance was that of Pini, played by Idan Alterman, who portrays a troubled man under the influence of an apocalyptic vision. This film is surely for audiences steeped in the political realities of Israel and the perils it faces from all corners of the political spectrum. Other viewers may be less readily absorbed by its concerns.",1206662400,10,1812,4.940983606557377

With all the arab killing of Jews you have to wonder why the subject was radical Jews.  I know it is a valid subject, it just seems a way to slam Israel politically.  Political agenda maybe??

1731131,4,B0000694XO,"This 2000 Israeli film is as fresh as today's headlines.  Set in a settlement in Israel it's about a radical rabbi and his ardent followers, two best friends who compete for the rabbi's daughter, and the ongoing conflicts of orthodoxy and secularism in Israel.

The film is as bleak as the landscape around the settlement.  And the rabbi's radicalism is the one thing that keeps the young men bound together.  One of them is in the army and creates a religious unit much to the concern of his superiors who distrust the radicalism, even though the soldiers perform well.  Another young man is the scholar and the rabbi wants him to marry his daughter.  Alas, though, she prefers the soldier.  Trouble follows.  She leaves the settlement and goes to the city where she finds an apartment with some other religious young women.

Her rejection of her religious suitor, however, pushes him to plan to commit a radical act and he involves the soldier as well as another innocent friend in the plan.  How this all plays out is scary, as we are all aware of the potential violence of terrorist attacks.  This film brings this all out as well as some complex psychological factors.

The problem was that the story moved a little two slowly for my taste.  Also, as it was a foreign film, I know that it lost a lot in translation.  It seemed as if some parts were missing and the narrative seemed to jump round awkwardly.  So, in spite of its message and the tension raised regarding what would happen next, I found myself looking at the clock and feeling bored.

But it's interesting to watch. It is one of a few opportunities to see some of the challenges Israel people face. Music is nice. The story feels real, as well as the emotions of the characters.

1731133,4,B0000694XO,"TIME OF FAVOR is one of those unique films that not only entertains with a fine story but also serves as a fine history lesson.  At least for those of us who have never understood all of the manifestations and etiologies of the continuing fighting in Israel and the West Bank and Palestine TIME OF FAVOR turns many of the explanations into a tightly woven, tense story that results in revealing at least some of the factions that perplex.

Briefly stated, the story is about a religious company of military men under the influence of a Rabbi who exalts the concepts of the 'last day' and the glory of participating in such a holy war to return the temples of Jerusalem to the Israelis.  Within this same settlement is a military company more secularly oriented and suspicious of the 'zealots'.  A plot to destroy the Dome of the Rock (a Muslim 'degradation' to the holy place of the Jews) is followed by the secular company in the manner of a pursuit of the religious company.

To ground all of this complex politico-religious detail the director and writer have introduced fully three-dimensional characters in a love triangle: the zealot Rabbi's daughter Michal is supposed to be attracted to her father's top scholar Pini whose best friend Menachem is in reality the man to whom Michal is attracted.  It is a time honored test of friendship, loyalty, and the incongruities of love that drive the story to the flashing finish.

The acting is excellent, the camera work exceedingly atmospheric, and the pacing of the film is brisk - at times so brisk that it is difficult to keep up with the complexities of the plot.  But in all the major contribution of TIME OF FAVOR is one of educational value.  Finally someone is giving the masses some insight into the myriad problems that conflict Israel.

7965312,4,B0000694XO,"The eternal triangle of the two men, the girl, and her rabbi father combines good acting with sensitive plot.  But then the romantic drama turns into, or attempts to turn into, a political thriller.  The movie become then a bit clich-ish with stock phrases like ""you have to trust me"" a shabac officer with an eternal cigarette in his mouth, and lame attempt to create suspense.  Still, the social milieu of the settlers and the knitted caps society is portrayed competently, sensitively, and carefully.",1445731200,,503,4.964285714285714
7965313,4,B0000694XO,"I did not give it a five star rating only because it is of the essence to know the current Israeli reality in depth - in order to fully appreciate the import of this, otherwise great film ! Even the title in Hebrew ""Ha Hesder"" is far from the English ""Time of favor"" and, as such is non translatable - but idiomatic .",1442275200,,317,4.0476190476190474
7965314,1,B0000694XO,"Just a comment on reading the ""editor's review"" provided by Amazon.  The review states plainly ""amidst the contemporary political powder-keg and timeless austere beauty of Israel's West Bank. ""  There is no such place as Israel's 'West Bank"".  This is an occupied territory of Palestine recognized as such by international law.  Israel has no more ""right"" to the West Bank than it has to the pre 67 Israel.  Palestine will be free of immigrant colonists. (Sounds like good film, however.)",1441238400,,488,5.05
7965315,5,B0000694XO,"Very interesting, contentiously political & brilliant Israeli thriller. It depicting the mistrust/prejudice by many Liberal, secular Israeli's, regarding the integration of religious Israeli Jews(representing a biblical Jewish viewpoint) into the Israel's army(I.D.F.)  which has traditionally been a liberal, leftwing bastion loyal to the secular leftwing socialist philosophy of Israel's modern founding fathers.
 A ""new religious Jewish company"" is formed for modern-Orthodox Jewish Seminary(Yeshivah) students with Menachim as its commander(captain).
He is a follower of a Rabbi (with a Biblical Israeli(Torah) views) and goals of integrating his students into the IDF , its elite officers & the leadership of Israel's society , while maintaining their religious and biblical viewpoint"". A senior Mossad officer labels him ""brilliant"",""crazy"" and ""dangerous"".
Menachim has to successfully straddle his loyalty to both his Rabbi and secular IDF commander and prove his loyalty to both,which proves to be a very difficult journey throughout the movie. Seen as outsiders within the IDF who are ""revolutionary"", ""too motivated"" etc are soon
Suspected of wanting to blow up a Mosque on the Temple Mount. Menachim is jailed, interrogated and beaten up and ridiculed while chained to a ceiling by his antagonist the leftwing secular Mossad senior officer. The movie has an exciting and unexpected ending.
Several exciting plots and excellent cinematography make this movie a contender for best Israeli movie of the decade.
Prophetic Relevancy:  Today 25% of IDF officers are religious modern Orthodox Jews(up ten-fold since 1992).
Can the same revolution be repeated for Ultra Orthodox Jews whom require even greater separate accommodations  to serve in the IDF .",1437436800,2,1760,5.757692307692308

7965317,4,B0000694XO,"I do not get what Menachem saw in Michal... she was not personable... not friendly... not especially pretty... like an Israeli Kristen Stewart. Kind of took away from the story, which is a shame because it was a very good one. Definitely something you can discuss after seeing it... why certain characters did what they did.",1433030400,,324,4.803571428571429
