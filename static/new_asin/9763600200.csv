1173080,5,9763600200,"I'd heard a lot of good things about this video and it did not disappoint.  Lalo's DVD is a refreshing alternative to a lot of the more traditional training videos available today.  I combine this workout with my kettlebell routines to get a more thorough workout, but it also works well on its on.  I like the fact that minimal equipment is required and I also like his breaks between the circuits.  He creates a peaceful atmosphere while working your entire body.  I look forward to his second video, which he indicated that he is working on.  I received an unexpected letter from his company as well as a business card; this was a nice touch and a genuine attempt reach out to the customer in a positive manner.",1243296000,,714,4.496124031007752
1173081,2,9763600200,"I first read about this video in Shape magazine and it got a wonderful review.  I decided to check it out here and with all the great ratings, I thought this would be a good workout.  I was disappointed in it.  I consider myself to be intermediate to advanced, and I suppose my heart rate did get raised and I did break a sweat, but I just didn't feel like I got a good workout.  His cueing isn't very good either.  I am a big fan of Jari Love and need to add some variety to my rotation but I don't think I'll be reaching for this video often.  I will probably try it again but not in the very near future.  If I could return it, I would.  I'll stick to Jari Love and Jillian.",1242086400,5,677,3.926470588235294
1173082,4,9763600200,"I just finished Lalofit and my legs are shot!  Great workout, led by a very attractive Mr. Lalo Fuentes.

The workout is 54 minutes with good chaptering.  I really appreciated Lalo's exceptional form and I felt the freeze technique was the key to making my legs work so hard.

The music is really good...Lalo does Not work out to the beat of the music (something that used to bother me, but I got used to after doing Jillian Michaels's workouts).

My main issues are:
* Lalo really burns out the shoulders/core/legs and to a certain extent, chest, but no weighted bicep/tricep/back work At All.  I ended up adding in some biceps and triceps work during a couple of the lunge sequences, and did some pullovers during the 2nd set of pushups to even out the workout.  I'm really hoping that Lalo has some reasoning behind doing this, hopefully his next workout will focus heavily on biceps, triceps, and back.
* During the cooldown stretch, Lalo doesn't tell you when you're changing to a different stretch, so if you aren't watching the screen, Lalo will be doing a different stretch than yourself.  I found myself about 2 stretches behind on 3 different occasions...I felt that was a little sloppy, considering Lalo is doing all of this on voice over.  I don't think it would have killed him to mention that he was going to move on to another stretch.

Overall, a very nice workout that really flew by...easy to bring the workout to the 34 minute mark and stop when you're pressed for time (after 34 minutes, it's mostly pushups and ab work with a couple of sets of burpees).",1241913600,12,1574,4.60931899641577
1173083,5,9763600200,"This is actually a very good workout, I'm very happy that I bought it. I'm an advanced exerciser, and I use this DVD when I want to do a higher reps/ lower weights workout. My butt was actually sore for a few days after the DVD. There is also a rather tough abs/core segment at the end. I'm looking forward to the day when I do this workout again. Way to go Lalofit, keep them coming!",1238112000,4,384,4.065789473684211
1173084,5,9763600200,"This video will give you a challenging total body workout. Lots of lunges(but NO forward lunges, which are harder on the knee) squats, burpees, plank-push-ups, traditional push-ups and some very challenging balancing work. The cardio intervals are jumping jacks, high knee runs, speed skaters, and burpees to name a few, He also uses some kickboxing moves like side kicks, upper cuts, with weights, and some cross-over punches, with weights. Lalo also does some very nice classical AB's exercises.  Most all of these moves are done with his signature ""freeze"" technique all moves are so deliberate and control, that you could go really heavy on the weights. Lalo finishes off with a very nice stretching routine. The music is really really good, and there is a music only feature which is a nice option to have. Be forewarned Lalo cueing is very minimum to none, so you'll have to watch him and count your reps yourself, this video is also a ""voice-over"" and is NOT chaptered. That being said I sweated a lot and I really enjoyed this challenging total body workout; my heart rate was up there. I'm sure you'll see results if you do this workout 2-3 x per week and you're careful with your diet",1236297600,5,1194,4.768115942028985
1173085,5,9763600200,"Lalofit is an AMAZING dvd...it helped kick me into shape and made working out fun!!!!  It has been very hard for me to remain motivated when it comes to working out, but Lalo made it enjoyable and attainable with his dvd.  I look forward to waking up in the morning and working out now!!!!  Thanks Lalo!!!",1231718400,,305,4.410714285714286
7901754,5,9763600200,"Amazing challenging exercise, which is worth the money.
I love that there are two workout levels for beginners, & advanced.
Each DVD has two options of workout: first option is for 1 hour and second option is for half an hour. 30 minutes is the perfect workout for me. I needed something that I could do in the middle of the day, like during my lunch break. It's a great way to stay active and get a great workout.
In the second video"" V2"" The workout intensifies; however it let's you take a break for a few seconds between each set, so it makes it easier to keep going.
I'm so unbelievably happy with this purchase. Challenging but not impossible.",1521504000,,649,4.416666666666667
7901755,5,9763600200,"One of the best at home dvd workouts you can do!  This workout is challenging without being high impact like most of the workouts you see advertise by other fitness companies.  It works the entire body with very little weight and you will feel it the next day.  The only part of the body I think was overlooked was the biceps.  Overall, Lalo hands down has the toughest ab section I have ever did.  The results I received were a slimming and toning of the body much like a swimmer or gymnast.  If you want to get in shape and prefer to look lean and athletic versus big and bulky then buy this program as well as Volume 2.  Lalo if you read this, we need a Volume 3!",1459900800,2,666,4.116279069767442
7901756,5,9763600200,"I've been using this DVD for at least two years with fantastic results.  When I first started I was in OK shape - I had difficulty completing all the reps, used light weights.  Now I'm extremely fit, up to heavier weights and have sculpted my arms, shoulders, glutes & abs - he really works the whole body & the core.  I don't get bored with the workout - he mixes it up enough to keep me coming back every week.  Oh, & get ready to squat your a*s off or well, on - intense! Just ordered his other DVD & I'm looking forward to another challenge.",1358640000,2,545,4.113207547169812
7901757,4,9763600200,"This is a good, total body workout.  I subtracted one star for lack of cuing.  Great for overall conditioning.  To the previous reviewers who think this is a beginners workout, perhaps you have forgotten what it is truly like to be a beginner.  That would be someone who hasn't worked out in months, years, or possibly never.  I am intermediate/advanced and I am worn out by the end of this dvd.",1275091200,,395,4.507042253521127
7901758,5,9763600200,This is a great exercise video.  If you want to work your butt and shoulders this is for you. It is a great all over workout.  Be ready to sweat and maybe even a little sore the next day.  Buy it!,1251331200,,196,3.731707317073171
7901759,5,9763600200,"This workout is my type of workout.  No fancy set just some good old hard work. I won't describe the exercises because some of the other reviewers already have.
I finished this workout and my legs felt alive.  Have put this one in my weekly line-up of workouts.  Tomorrow I will probably be very sore but it will be a good sore.
Looking forward to seeing some more DVD's from LALO.",1251244800,3,381,4.338028169014085
7901760,5,9763600200,"This is a long 55 minute workout.  I find it awesome but some of the leg movements take time to get used to.  You will be sweating within 10 minutes of starting this video.  Don't feel bad if you start out with a real light dumbells, as this is a tough video.  I found out a second video is going to start filming in August and I am very excited.  I am definately going to purchase it.  Good luck using the video.",1247788800,4,413,3.975609756097561
7901761,4,9763600200,"I bought this video along with several others from Jillian Michaels to Jackie Warner and several pilates videos. I find myself going back to this one and to the Crunch: Belly, Butt and Thighs video. Crunch is a daily exercise for me and I do LaloFit once on the weekends. After Lalo's work out I am generally in pain for a few days -- it is that good. I also plug in to my iPod and don't even hear his voice-over comments (which aren't bad at all). Lalo's form is perfect and he doesn't have irritating, smiling people in the background. There are a lot of lunges in this video and my legs feel the difference and I can see the difference.",1246147200,2,639,4.245901639344262
7901762,5,9763600200,"It took me a little time to get this DVD but, boy am I glad I did. I received it in the mail today and did it today. I was so impressed with this workout, I felt like I climbed Mt. Everest. I throughly enjoyed it because it was no nonsense, no dancey moves and no constant chatter. He made the perfect DVD for me. Oh course I have to thank Jillian( for her DVDs) getting me shape for this one. Keep them coming!!!",1245283200,,413,3.9285714285714284
7901763,5,9763600200,"This is the best video I have purchased to date.  I am intermediate/advanced and I cannot finish this workout!  I have noticed a change in my body only after two weeks (my boyfriend did too!)  I highly highly recommend.  I never write reviews but this video is so good and effective you need to try it.  Its not for beginners at all so those of you more advance exercisers that want a challenge, this video will do it.",1244505600,,418,4.3076923076923075
