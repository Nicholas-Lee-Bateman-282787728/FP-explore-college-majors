It begins with a comic western movie based on a magazine story. Should the stories be up to date? They made the author rich. A letter invites the author to visit her Mystery Ranch to see the real West. This will give that ranch an economic boost. What if that writer doesnt like this Mystery Ranch? That write and his secretary detrain to a noisy greeting. The secretary puts his wrong foot in the stirrup! The writer sees an apparent hanging. Next Morris the writer halts the horses. Robert Morris sees two men shooting at each other. Can it be stopped? Its a free country. They put a burr under Morris saddle as a trick. [A long shot for a stunt double.] I cant imagine how that happened. Theres a report on stolen steers, they ride after them.

Did they put it over on him? Morris catches the two rustlers and gives on a spanking! Robert and Percy see a hold up; another gag? Two men have car trouble and start walking. Robert overhears a conversation. Those two men ask for help with their car. Robert and Percy plan a trick of their own, but a man overhears them and reverses the gold and iron. Percy stages a hold up and leaves. But another man suggests a joke. The Sheriff arrives and arrests those two men, then Robert as the gold is gone! After they leave the two robbers overpower their guard and escape. Percy tells Robert about the joke, so he goes after them. The Sheriffs posse rides up after Robert knocked those two men down. Mary asks Robert if she will be in the story. Only if the hero gets the heroine.

It is rare to see a movie that parodies the Western movies of that era, but the comedy makes it worth viewing. Its still entertaining today.",1506211200,,1690,4.375796178343949

8038313,4,B000641ZPE,"Poverty Row Pictures presents ""MYSTERY RANCH"" (12 April 1934) (53 mins/B&W) (Fully Restored/Dolby Digitally Remastered) -- Tom Tyler was an American actor in silent and sound motion pictures --- He was born Vincent Markowski, into a Polish-American family --- Tyler had a long career in film, stretching from the 1920s to the 1950s, and appeared in many films, most of them westerns such as John Ford's ""Stagecoach"" and ""She Wore a Yellow Ribbon"" --- He occasionally took ""civilian"" roles in feature films (he's the boxing referee in Abbott and Costello's ""Buck Privates""), but the biggest part of Tyler's screen career was spent making low-budget B-movie westerns for modest salaries --- Most of his budget westerns were made by Reliable Pictures for producers Bernard B. Ray and Harry S. Webb.

Larger studios cast the athletic Tyler in rugged roles --- In 1940, he was the Mummy ""Kharis"" in ""The Mummy's Hand"" --- In the first film adaptation of a comic-strip superhero, Tyler had the title role in the 1941 film serial ""The Adventures of Captain Marvel"", and starred as one of The Three Mesquiteers in Republic's series of western features.

In 1943, he starred in ""The Phantom"", based on Lee Falk's famous comic strip --- Tyler personified the role, looking especially striking in the character's familiar costume, and much of the serial's great success was due to Tyler himself. It was Tom Tyler's last major screen role --- One of my favorite serials is ""The Phantom of the West"" (1930), was billed as the ""all talking serial"" which is still available through Amazon or VCI Entertainment, great action plus harding riding and fighting scenes with Tom Tyler in the middle and riding in and out of danger.

There is little doubt that Tyler was a shy man most of his life, but he was also a man of inner confidence, willing to take on huge risks within his own abilities over and over again --- Tyler had a tremendous work ethic and enjoyed working hard for what he believed in --- from the weight room to learning his craft in acting --- Tom was a major ""B-Western"" cowboy star and while simultaneously working as a western hero, he was also a weight-lifting champion --- Tyler was once considered the strongest man in America, he won the national AAU weight-lifting championship in 1928 (he lifted 760 lbs.) and made the 1928 U.S. Olympic team.

Tyler was beset by rheumatoid arthritis in the later part of his career, and was limited to occasional supporting roles. Nearly destitute, he returned to live with his sister in the Detroit area, dying there of heart failure at the age of 50 in 1954 -- (From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia)
