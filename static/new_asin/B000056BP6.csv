8607960,1,B000056BP6,Warning: Invest your money elsewhere! I can sit back and appreciate amateur videos but this one is unbearable to watch. Babes Going Crazy is just someone holding a video camera without a zoom lense and violentely shaking it every few seconds on the beach. The cameraman is completely incompetant and misses a lot of potential footage...due to his own insecurities. Babes Going Crazy actually hurts the reputation of Mardi Gras and Spring Break by offering little variety. Who wants to see the same unattractive girls for 10 straight minutes? Most of the footage is either of women still in their swimsuits or guys who get in the way with their beer guts. The people who put this video together are completely and utterly clueless. This is the type of footage I would expect from my friend's bubble gum chewing younger sister.,1001462400,24,825,4.858156028368795
