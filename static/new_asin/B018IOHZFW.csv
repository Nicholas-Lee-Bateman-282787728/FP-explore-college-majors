8742458,5,B018IOHZFW,"Great family film.  It's sweet and innocent.  We love it.  We watch it over and over again.  If you are into heavy, emotionally laden films, don't buy this one.  This one is light and a great escape to a simpler time.",1458777600,2,217,4.195121951219512
8742459,4,B018IOHZFW,"An unusual role for Lupino here in a rare romantic comedy.  As the daughter of a executive short on sales people during the war, she sets out to prove a woman can do the man's job.  Along the way she gets tangled with a serviceman and mistaken as his new wife.  Lots of simple wartime humor but mostly a nice chance to see Lupino in lighter fare.",1448841600,4,346,4.134328358208955
