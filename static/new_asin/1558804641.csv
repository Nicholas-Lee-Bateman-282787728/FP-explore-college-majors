Tommy Chong takes over the directorial reins on the comedy duo's second feature . . . and has no idea what he's doing. Slackly paced, ""Cheech and Chong's Next Movie"" (1980) soon runs out of material and collapses into aimless self-indulgence. Chong's direction is so lax that he breaks character on several occasions. Some laughs, but the team's cinematic offerings would grow progressively worse.",1456531200,,500,5.341772151898734

180304,4,1558804641,"This review is an excerpt from my book Killer Bs: The 237 Best Movies On Video Youve (Probably) Never Seen, which is available as an ebook on Amazon. If you enjoy this review, there are 236 more like it in the book (plus a whole lot more). Check it out!
CHEECH AND CHONGS NEXT MOVIE: When people speak of Cheech and Chongs film career, the single highlight mentioned is usually their first feature, Up In Smoke. From there it was all downhill. Except for this, their second feature, in whichby genius or by accidentthey managed to get everything right. (Probably by accident, as their every later effort sucked.)
The result is a rambling odyssey through L.A., and a politically incorrect caricature of its ethnic stereotypes. The flick has its share of gross jokes and bad taste (thats a given), but its also got some great lines (I been late for work five times this week, says Cheech, and its only Tuesday), and great gags (like Tommys stoned version of a magic trick in the nightclub), and great scenes (Cheechs song, Mexican Americans, is a gem: punchlines set to music) and lots of idiot anarchy. (When the UFO blasts a blue light into their car, Red puts his hand in it. Hey, don't put your hand in there, man! Tommy warns, immediately after which he inserts his own hand.) The surprise is that its so funny. The better surprise is that its still so funny.",1421798400,,1362,4.586065573770492

180384,3,1558804641,"I liked basically the first half of CHEECH AND CHONG'S NEXT MOVIE. Even though there was not much of a plot going on, C & C's skits were very funny. That skit in the welfare office had me in tears, and just looking at C & C's home with its funny signs and bizarre items was also fun. Also, Cheech's ""Mexican American"" song, followed by Chong's song with absurd lyrics was amusing too. I would have been pleased with this movie if it had all been funny skits like these, even if no plot had developed. But the second half of NEXT MOVIE just drags really badly and is not funny any more. I mean, that long section with Cheech driving the car of that rich couple and telling lame jokes - what the %$!!@# was that?! I also found appalling the three instances of suggested or actual animal abuse in the second half of the film. However, for the funny first half, and for Cheech & Chong's irreverent humor, this movie is popular with many of their fans nonetheless.

Even though BORN IN EAST L.A. is probably supposed to be the ""filler"" on here, I actually like it a good deal better than the first film. In it, Cheech (without Chong) mistakenly gets deported to Mexico because he doesn't have his I.D. on him, so he spends most of the movie trying all sorts of ways to get back across the border. Although there's no great purpose or plot to the whole thing, there are numerous funny moments. A great running gag is this painting of Jesus in Cheech's home in L.A. that people interpret all sorts of ways. In one hilarious scene, a guy thinks Jesus is talking to him, but actually a phone is behind the painting and Cheech is calling to leave a message on the answering machine for someone to please rescue him in Mexico. While BORN IN EAST L.A. is not a comedy classic, the story holds my interest all the way through, especially because of the funny bits in it and Cheech's sympathetic performance. Incidentally, this movie arose from Cheech's hit song ""Born in East L.A."" that was a spoof of Bruce Springsteen's ""Born in the U.S.A.""

Both movies are in widescreen and both have decent picture and sound quality. Each movie is on a separate DVD (so 2 DVDs here), but with only the trailers of each film for bonuses. But heck, at the great price, it's worth getting even if you just like ONE of these films.",1343088000,3,2302,4.401408450704225

Yeah, but if u have yet to see this, and like the Cheech and Chong movie premise, this as well as Up in Smoke, and Still Smoking are the top 3 FOR ME!  But if you have first started watching these flicks and have quit partying on the substances depicted in the films oh so long ago (been there,done that,repeat these steps a few more times) then its just another silly movie filled with immature content based on irresponsible drug usage depending on what state of mind you are in like if you have kids out and about on a weekend night that are becoming of the age where they may partake in such activity if introduced to it, THEN its not so funny any more.  Its more like advertisement for the campaign, 'drug experamenting will not make you drop dead, its funny and cool to partake in the activity'.  That frightens me while I think this can be my daughters watching this instead of me, having the same impression on them as things like this did for me and made the fear of trying things not so strong.",1329004800,,1270,4.333333333333333

Man, I've never heard anything so funny in all my life! I laughed and laughed until I was crying. Alas, that was my one and only experience with Cheech and Chong, but it left a lasting impression. Just recently, my wife and I were going through the bargain DVD display at a major discount store and we found ""Cheech and Chong's Next Movie."" Thinking back on my C & C experience, I picked it up just to see what a C & C movie was like.

It's a funny movie! No doubt! And it's rather well put together. The movie is a marvelous collection of sight gags, The comedy is highly exaggerated and somewhat badly dated. Nevertheless, It's funny and brings back a lot of amusing memories of easy-going times. Both my wife and I enjoyed it, although the movie is so old she wasn't even born yet at the time the movie was made. It's funny whether you imbibe or not, but a lot of the humor is directed to those who do. What a strange time!

Cheech has a double role as first cousin, Red, who speaks unaccented English.  This is an inside joke:  Cheech, real name Richard, had to be taught his trademark Chicano accent.  Prior to hitting it big on the concert circuit, he spoke very much like Red.

I only wish I had bumped into hippies like Tommy Chong, a simple, uncomplicated, singular-minded pothead.  You can trust this guy, whose main ambitions were jamming, friendship, and seeking the ultimate high.

Born in east L.A. is a classic, it is about a mexican-american who wrongfully gets deported to Tijuana, Mexico during an immigration raid. While being in Tijuana, Mexico our featured character Rudy Guadalupe Robles(CHEECH MARIN) learns a lot about his mexican heritage. Rudy struggles in Tijuana because he does not speak spanish. He later meets a caucasian club owner named Jimmy (Daniel Stern) and Jimmy gives Rudy a job that pays slave wages. Rudy needs that job in order to be able to cross the border back into America.

""Cheech and Chongs next movie"" is about two pot heads that are on a mission: to retrieve a special suitcase. Cheech has a cousin named Red who is coming into L.A. and has a suitcase full of marijuana. Cheech sends his dumb friend Chong to meet his cousin Red. While in L.A. Red decides to stay at a hotel but is unable to pay the bill. The receptionist Paul Reubens (a.k.a. PEE WEE HERMAN) decides to keep Reds suitcase until the bill is paid.

I'm thinking to myself, was this intentional?  Is Thomas Chong really an auteur, or was he just really stoned out of his mind when he directed this?  The film itself is actually really funny, and it's the best of the Chong directed films.  The scene at the beginning of the film (Cheech and Chong syphening gasoline) is hilarious (remember, this was made in 1980 with the gas crisis still on everyone's mind).  The scene where Cheech and Chong improvise a song about ""beaners"" (showing that Cheech and Chong were doing racial humour way before the overrated Carlos Mencia) is great, too.  All of Chong's films have that laid back, at times completely lackadasical feel to them, so my pretentious side is wondering whether Thomas Chong is a real auteur, or is he just a lazy stoner who managed, somehow, to string together a few films.

1. Cheech and Chongs Next Movie

2. Cheech and Chong's Up in Smoke

3. Cheech and Chongs Nice Dreams

Last Place by far 4. Cheech and Chong's The Corrician Brothers",1115337600,2,401,4.28

Cheech & Chong are out stealing gasoline

for their stolen car...getting kicked off welfare

and still doing all kinds of crazy drugs!

For all you hardcore fans- this is probably

one of the best films Cheech & Chong ever made.

Very funny, and filled with insanity!

Definitely a cult-comedy classic.

The story goes nowhere...

The humor is tasteless...

Cheech & Chong are morons...

But then again, why else would

you watch it?

Only recommended for true fans of Cheech & Chong",1109808000,2,530,4.820224719101123
180409,4,1558804641,"Not the masterwork that the boys initial effort, ""Up In Smoke"", was but it'll do.  Basically this film is a series of loosely tied together lowbrow comic vignettes, some involving dope, some not, centered around some colorful L.A. locales.  Cheech does double duty here by playing both himself and his Texas cousin,Red.  Film is also notable for an early appearance by Paul Reubens as Pee Wee Herman, albeit foul-mouthed.  Michael Winslow a.k.a the sound-effects guy from the ""Police Academy"" movies has a hilarious bit at the welfare office.  Edie McLurg is also hilarious as an oblivious middle-aged WASP that Chong and Red meet along the way.  The laugh quotient here is pretty high but it's unfortunate that Universal did not include any extras here(not even a trailer).",1109721600,2,774,5.05511811023622
180410,4,1558804641,"It's a shame that a film like this will be mostly dismissed by a society that will see this as nothing more than a ""stoner"" film.  While admittedly the humor often contains drug references, there are several scenes that I think anybody could enjoy and have a good laugh at.

While I agree with many reviewers here as to what are some of the funnier scenes, the two that really do it for me is the one in the Welfare Office. This is just physical comedy at its very best. While Chong waits for Cheech to ""visit"" with his lady friend, he is seated next to an old man, and a very odd character played by Michael Winslow (and it is very  apparent what a brilliant comic he is, and it's too bad his talents went to waste in countless Police Academy sequels). I cannot even begin to describe this scene, but those who have seen the movie know what I am talking about. Those who haven't need to do themselves a favor and watch the movie, if only for this scene alone. Even the look on Chong's face is authentic--he's not acting here--he is equally confused and entertained by what's happening around him.

Shortly after this scene comes another great one, where Cheech performs his song, a warm and loving (and hilarious) tribute to Mexican Americans. It has been days since I watched this and I still have that song in my head.

I would highly (no pun intended) recommend this film to anybody that needs a great laugh and is not easily offended by drug and sex jokes.",1109289600,26,1461,4.396296296296296
180411,5,1558804641,"I may be wrong here....But I remember in the original release of this film, in the part where Cheech is ironing his clothes and waiting for Donna to pick him up, he was singing Ritchie Valens Song, ""Donna"", he sings ""Oh Donna, Oh Donna..."", then he gets frustrated and says, ""come on b***h!!"" Then in the part where the rich girl, (played by Cheech's then wife, ""Rikki Marin"") is driving the gang back to her house from the guitar store, Hall & Oates was singing ""Rich Girl"" on the car radio. That said and done, this is still one of my favorite C&C movies. Well worth the price.",1103587200,4,579,4.37037037037037
180412,4,1558804641,"Nostalgia for my childhood recently caused me to buy and watch the Cheech and Chong movies (with the exception of The Coriscan Brothers).  Aside from realizing I shouldn't have been watching those movies in my pre-teen days, I realized how well done they are.  Most amazing to me was that they  held up one after the other, feeling not repetitive, though each of them is rather episodic. Most impressive was Chong's direction; he makes a number of interesting choices that elevate him beyond the status of writer/star who has enough power to direct; clearly, he took this role quite seriously.  The movies, of course, are not serious.  I rarely laugh out loud in movies these days, but I did at least a half dozen times in each of these.  The characters are not only given funny situations in which to work and funny lines to deliver, but each of them is presented with a kind of earnestness that makes them likeable, and the films all he more watchable.",1093219200,22,954,4.648809523809524

The guitar shop, the bath house, Chicken Charlie, ""Ain't that a peach"", ""I think they're Iranians!"", and ""I'm gonna turn this glass into a ..."" are funny enough to leave anyone in stitches.

There were of course very funny situations as usual with C&C, such as when they drive into the hispanic family's yard and Chong says ""hey pendejos!!"". I think it was a mistake to have Cheech Marin play his own cousin, they should have had a separate character and had them both interact with it more, and the ""holy sheep sh*t"" was run into the ground. To top it all off, a spaceship in a marijuana farm was a little over the edge, even for Cheech and Chong.",1066521600,3,576,4.293577981651376

180418,4,1558804641,"I'm going to be honest; if you are not a fan of Cheech & Chong, you are not going to like this movie.  On the other hand, if you're either a fan or just plain curious about C & C, then check this movie out.  It's a great example of them at their best.
I was a big fan of Cheech & Chong long before they made their first movie, ""Up in Smoke"", which was an instant classic.  This was, as the title says their ""Next Movie"" and shortly after this they released a few more before they finally split up in the early 80s when Cheech took a movie offer (Born in East L.A.)without Tommy Chong.
Of all the Cheech & Chong movies, their first two were the best, so if you're looking for their best work, look no further.
My only complaint and reason for not giving it 5 stars is that they don't offer it on DVD.  All of their other movies are out on DVD, so I can't figure out why this one is not on DVD.  I'm hoping that when they release their NEW reunion movie, they have the wisdom to issue the entire library.",1051488000,,1002,3.99
180419,3,1558804641,"Cheech & Chong are back in this their second starring role movie. This time they are in a bigger-budget movie and Thomas Chong is the Director of this film. That's Cassandra Peterson, the red-headed lady with the sunglasses on top who has to say ""Help me, Wamba!"". We all later knew her as ""Elvira, Mistress Of The Dark"" here on Los Angeles television. Look closely behind the houses and you can tell that some scenes were filmed on the backlot of the studio. The story--Cheech gets frantic when he wakes up one morning and finds the van has been stolen, only to find out they got fired so the boss took it back. Back to the Public Social Services they go. But it's okay, Cheech's girlfriend works there. Let the fun begin. Phil Hartman and Rita Wilson (Tom Hanks' future wife) can be spotted in this film.

Introducted is the C&C series are Donna (Evelyn Guerrero) and Pee Wee Herman (Paul Ruebens). The funniest part is when they're at the hotel and Pee Wee Herman got arrested even though he was the VICTIM!
And when they eluded the cops in a Ferrari and they get abducted by aliens.
If you're a C&C fan or a fan of marijuana laced comedies, you'll love Next Movie (it's the very first C&C movie I'd ever watched) and avoid Still Smokin' and the awful Corsician Brothers, you'll be happy you did cause everybody knows that Up in Smoke and this one are the classics.",1044057600,5,778,4.335616438356165
