I specially like the first season more than the second,because wonder Girl is in the first one and Paradise island,to make it short The episodes in the 1st season are based on the 40's era and more realistic than the 2nd one but it is fun watching it..... Stars!!!!!!",1295654400,,283,4.568627450980392

8043756,5,B0006Z2KZC,"I admit it.  Even as a kid, I always like Wonder Woman the best.  And for the silliest reason.  I love her ability to change from Diana Prince to Wonder Woman by spinning.  I always thought that was so cool.  Naturally, this was one of the few shows I was going to buy if it ever came out on DVD.

So my list of shows I'm allowed to buy has grown, but this show remains a great one to have on DVD.  This set is for the first two of the three seasons.  As of today, that's all that's been released.

Season one finds Wonder Woman (Lynda Carter) leaving Paradise Island to help America fight the Nazis in World War II.  The set includes all 13 of the WWII episodes, including the extended pilot.  I'll admit to never having been a super fan of this season.  To this day, it seems cheesy to me.  I think one problem is that they give Wonder Woman too many ""love will solve everything"" lines.

Season two finds our heroine on a new network and in a new decade.  Wonder Woman is called to the world of men once again to fight the evils of the ""modern"" 70's.  Teaming up with the son of the original Steve Trevor (still played by Lyle Waggoner), she joins the Inter Agency Defense Command and finds plenty of danger to keep her busy.  I much prefer the modern episodes because they allow Diana and Wonder Woman to develop a personality.  I find her a fun character to watch.  And she takes on the bad guys head on, more concerned with catching them then transforming them.

These DVD sets are great for fans.  Both sets are two sided discs to keep the price down.  With three episodes per side, you get a sharp picture and clear sound.  Presented like they were on TV 30 years ago, there's nothing here that will blow you away, but there doesn't have to be.  Season 1 has a commentary on the pilot and then a ""how the series came to be"" documentary.  Season 2 has a documentary as well.

So the series is slightly (ok, greatly) dated.  It's still fun for the nostalgia crowd.  And Lynda Carter will always be Wonder Woman to me.  I'm thrilled to have these, and can't wait to get my hands on season 3.  Long live Wonder Woman!",1109894400,4,2120,4.2275
