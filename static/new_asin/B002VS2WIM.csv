Another quality product full of useful information by Kelly and his Crucible staff!",1434240000,,189,5.129032258064516
8382477,5,B002VS2WIM,"This DVD is one of few that really get into the meat and potatoes of what the viewer wants to see. Mr. McCann gives a brief kind of expectations and the why to the production of the DVD. He is direct to the point and real life approach to the explanation and demonstration. I will be purchasing more of his DVDs to incorporate the mental and reality approach to my practice. I already practice with reality base mind, but it's good to look, analyse and embrace the philosophy of some one like Mr. McCann. I highly recommend this DVD.",1397433600,,533,4.393939393939394
8382478,5,B002VS2WIM,"Just what works and nothing else.  I've trained in various martial arts for over 40 years and this by far is the most concise/efficient skill set I've seen.  With all my years of training, I can truly see the value and effectiveness of the gross motor skill movements.  Learning these skills is indispensable for anyone in a high risk occupation or environment.  Great stuff from Mr. McCann as always!",1363046400,,401,4.768115942028985
8382479,5,B002VS2WIM,"As usual, Kelly McCann really delivers on this dvd.  People with no clue of what to do on the ground would benefit greatly with this dvd.  It is load with info regarding common MMA techniques (stopping the thai thigh kick, triangle choke, etc.) and what McCann does would be truly effective.

Even for those who think that they have a solid ground game (I spent 8 years doing BJJ), there is a lot here for them to consider before using jujitsu techniques.  Imagine that you were just tackled to the ground with the bad guy in a superior position.  Instead of worrying about putting the guy in your guard and then working a kimura, armbar or choke - heck, just smash his skull in repeatedly with your elbow and rip on his eyes!

I was initally worried that I was throwing my money away because there is a groundfighting section on McCann's Combatives DVD set (Jim Grover).  He did repeat some of that information on this, but there was a lot that was new.  Once again, McCann comes across as someone speaking with direct honesty, providing first rate advice on how to protect yourself and doing so with techniques that will work in STRESSFUL SITUATIONS.  Thank you Mr. McCann for creating an entertaining and informative product and eliminating any B.S.",1344643200,,1252,4.654545454545454
8382480,5,B002VS2WIM,"Very much in line with his other instructional videos, this one strives to teach maximum effect with a minimum of techniques.  McCann is an expert on combat under extreme duress and it shows. What I also like about McCann's style is his emphasis on understanding the law, the importance of awareness to avoid trouble in the first place, and how to train so that you and your partner don't maim one another. There is no senseless glorification of violence. It is professional grade instruction for the law abiding citizen.  I recommend it highly.",1334534400,2,545,4.849462365591398
8382481,5,B002VS2WIM,"""Ground Kembativz: Street Solutions to Common MMA Set-Ups"" with Kelly McCann is volume six of the ""Kelly McCann's Crucible High-Risk Environment Training"" series.  In this DVD, produced by Paladin Press, McCann addresses how to deal with some of the more common situations you may face if you must fight an opponent with MMA (Mixed Martial Arts) skills, regardless if they train in MMA, or just happen to be a brawler who has picked a few things up along the way.

If you want straight forward, no frills, solid instruction on self-defense combatives, you won't go wrong learning from Kelly McCann.  He's a straight shooter, who calls it like he sees it, and who focuses on combatives for those who must use the skills when it really counts.  He does not teach ""martial arts"" or competition skills, he teaches based on the Crucible's motto, ""Nothing we do is competition legal, because your life's no game.""  This DVD is McCann's answer, or his street solutions, to some of the more popular MMA set-ups or attacks.

The program is filmed in what appears to be the Crucible's garage.  There is a car with ""Crucible"" on the door behind McCann.  It is also a bit dark, but not where you cannot see the instruction clearly.  But it was not filmed in Paladin's studio.  The filming is done very well, with clear picture and sound, and there are other scenes and information added into the program to make points and add variety.  There is also a good menu system so you can find the sections you want to review and practice easily.  So the production values are very good.

But what makes this DVD really valuable is the instruction.  McCann opens with an introduction that has him leaning against the car and looking through some notes as he describes why he made this DVD and the differences between MMA and the street.  After the intro, McCann goes into the set-ups or situations he addresses in the program.  These include:  The Clinch, Takedowns, Muay Thai Leg Kick, The Triangle Choke, The Rear Naked Choke, The Armbar, Standing Armbars, and The Mount Position.  He then just closes with a couple short words at the end of the mount position section.

Most of the DVD has McCann teaching responses and things to do against the attacks listed above, but in a couple of section he teaches offensive tools such as his variation of the Muay Thai leg kick and a quick standing arm bar.  Some of the defenses involve drawing a knife and cutting your way out, but McCann does stress that these responses are only for the most serious situations.

This program is an excellent companion to McCann's other combatives DVDs, such as ""Jim Grover's Combatives"" series, ""Situational Self-Offense,""  and his other Crucible programs.  It covers additional techniques and strategies to address some of the attacks one might face on the street.  I highly recommend this DVD and all of McCann's programs.

8382482,5,B002VS2WIM,"As with his books, Kelly McCann's DVD titled Ground  Kem-'Ba-Tivz, Street Solutions to Common MMA Setups is first rate.  Kelly's techniques are both practical, easily absorbed, and would constitute fine additions to anyone's empty hand arsenal.  For those martial artists who have a serious interest in street-viable combatives, this DVD is a must have.",1302739200,,353,5.5
8382483,5,B002VS2WIM,"Anyone who has seen Kelly McCann's books and DVDs knows that he does not waste time with endless talking and showing techniques over and over again.  In this DVD McCann gets to the meat of his combatives approach to countering common mixed martial art moves almost immediately.  The thing I have always loved about McCann's DVDs is how practical and effective his techniques and tactics are when it comes to street combat.  This DVD begins with Kelly explaining the difference between a MMA fighter and an untrained street fighter.  He also mentions the factors that make street combat so dangerous.  He moves to techniques to counter various clinch attacks.  The next section covers takedown counters on the street and how to practice using proper safety equipment. He briefly covers common counters to Muay Thai leg kicks and shows his combatives version of the hook kick.

The next section covers how to counter the triangle choke on the ground and the rear naked choke on the ground.  Countering the ground arm bar and the mount position are covered in the final section of this DVD.

The beauty of all the above counters is that they are simple and highly effective. They stress attacking the most vulnerable areas of a person's body, that being the eyes, throat, and groin  He also covers the use of the folding knife, both closed and open to counter these MMA techniques.  He emphasizes that one should not use the knife to cut someone unless your life is in danger.  In conclusion, this is a DVD for anyone who is interested in real life combat solutions. Rating:

 5 Stars. Joseph J. Truncale (Author:  Pro-Systems Combatives Vol. 1, 2).",1267142400,10,1646,4.807829181494662
