Every student needs to see this before taking their Constitutional exam and Scouts might earn a Merit Badge! All of us benefit from staying connected with the TRUTH about the Constitution and the brilliant deliberations that make it so extraordinary.",1487721600,7,376,5.080645161290323
7382942,5,B0144QXDKE,"Superb in every way!!  No presidential election is going to solve the problems in Washington D.C.  The progressive movement, the sworn enemy of the Constitution, is entrenched in both political parties.  To fix the problems in our country, the citizens must organize from the grassroots.  To do that effectively, we must educate ourselves on the Founder's principles.  Rick Green and David Barton do an incredible job of teaching the Constitution in the Founder's own words.  Americans must restore Constitutional principles!  This is a fantastic place to start.",1463616000,14,562,5.390804597701149
7382943,5,B0144QXDKE,This is an excellent study on the Constitution and our founding fathers.  It is easy to understand.  I can't stress enough  how important it is to know OUR History!  I highly recommend this series.,1462838400,13,197,4.705882352941177

8729636,5,B0144QXDKE,Fantastic! So much of this our public education system does not teach.,1532476800,,70,4.916666666666667
8729637,5,B0144QXDKE,"'Every member of the State ought diligently to read and to study the constitution of his country and teach the rising generation to be free.  By knowing their rights, they will sooner perceive when they are violated and be the better prepared to defend and assert them.'  John Jay, author, Federalist papers.

In this 11-week video series, you have an opportunity to read and study the Constitution in a fun and engaging way.  Half of the class was actually filmed in Independence Hall in Philadelphia where the Declaration of Independence and the Constitution were debated over, created and signed.  Stories of the founding fathers come to life in a compelling and educational way.

The other half was filmed in the private library of David Barton who owns over 100 thousand original documents that date from 1812 and prior.  He has actual original writings, letters, books, broadsides, pamphlets and booklets from that period.  When Barton makes a claim, he documents it heavily.  His books often contain pages of footnotes that are in a very small font - (size 7 or 8?)  It is common for foot/end notes to be as many as 70-90 pages for any of his books.

Are you unsure about the comments from those who call him a quack?  Do the research for yourself.  Check out his resources.  They are verifiable.

Both Barton and Rick Green lead this series.  They tell story after story that bring to life those men and women who suffered tremendous hardships and made great sacrifices to win our freedom from tyranny.",1524441600,,1510,4.794573643410852

8729639,1,B0144QXDKE,I was interested in watching this until I saw it was from David Barton.  Barton has been notorious for historical inaccuracies so I just couldn't watch this.,1521676800,,157,4.814814814814815
8729640,5,B0144QXDKE,"I study a lot of historians from both sides of political isle. I personally think that is the best way to discern the truth.

Because I take this approach, I can't help but laugh whenever I see negative reviews for David Barton or Rick Green's content (Mainly because these reviews are empty of any actual coherent arguments or evidence). Having personally been to the Wallbuilder's library, I can attest to the accuracy of what is included in this series. David Barton's organization has the largest private collection of founding father documents pre-dating 1812. He literally has the letters and journals of the guys who wrote the Constitution.

Everything that he says in this series is pulled directly from those letters. David isn't some college professor telling you his own opinion and then calling you an ignorant fool for not simply believing and agreeing with him. David literally is just passing on exactly what the founders said.

I would recommend that everyone watch this series and read David's books, then read other books from opposing historians. The coherence of arguments and pool of accurate references is astoundingly different. If you believe that you have to be a professor or elite within the higher education system to be capable of communicating history, then sure you probably won't like David. If you believe that the truth of the founding fathers and the foundation of our nation resides within what those people actually said though, then David is your man. Thank you David and Rick for all y'all do.",1511913600,14,1532,5.0
8729641,1,B0144QXDKE,"I bought this second hand. I couldn't even get through the first dvd. Its not a good historical source for anyone who is serious about history. David Barton is not a historian. That is important to remember before you watch this dvd. He doesnt back any of his claims up with verifiable proof.  This is a red flag for someone like me.

Dont waste your money.",1511740800,2,357,4.393939393939394

8729643,3,B0144QXDKE,"I want to love this DVD set, and I'm very interested in the subject, but I bought this to watch with my middle schoolers as part of their US Constitution homeschool studies, but WOW  Mr. Barton talks way, way too fast. I mean, I can't even comprehend as fast as he talks, so my kids are really frustrated. But the main lessons are better because Rick Green doesn't talk AS fast (still too fast, though, for optimal learning). In my opinion, there is also a lot of ""fat"" that could be cut for the dvd, and could use more images to mix it up from the lectures. Overall, so far, I wish it was more systematic in the presentation of information,  more visually interesting, and slow the teaching... especially Mr. Barton...  WAY down.",1499472000,10,730,4.473684210526316
