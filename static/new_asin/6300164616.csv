210112,2,6300164616,"Diane Lane stars at Katya, a window dresser for a big city department.  However, her displays are borderline erotica, and she unintentionally attracts the attention of Jack, a married man who has developed an obsession with Katya as he believes her displays are speaking to him, telling him of her wanton desires for him.  Inevitably, Katya tells Jack's wife about him, cracking his madness wide open into homicidal rage.
Next to some of the erotic scenery in this video flick, Diane Lane is (as always) the only thing watchable.  Everything else is formula ... watered down.",1024617600,12,575,4.96875

210147,3,6300164616,"This movie definitely has a Grade B feel to it. Diane Lane is only ""star"" actor in here and she wasn't that big a name in '87 anyway. In fact, she was just starting out in the business.

 The story is sleazy one about a window dresser (Lane) who exhibits almost-pornographic displays with her window mannequins. These semi-erotic dressings attract a stalker to Lane and that's where the suspense come in....good suspense.

Lane is great to ogle and is not modest in showing herself to us. Actually, this film seems to be only a vehicle or an excuse for the pretty actress to show off her breasts. Otherwise, it's standard ""B"" fare, because the story  isn't much.  I'm not surprised it never made it to DVD.  Lane has gone on to more modest roles.",1236124800,2,746,4.529850746268656
210148,4,6300164616,"I found this film disturbing, but extremely watchable. I've always admired Diane Lane and it's great that her career is back on track. LADY BEWARE is a bit ahead of its time, just before the crime of stalking became, sadly, an all too common offense. What I really enjoyed about the movie is how Lane's character Katya turns the tables on her sicko stalker Jack (the very creepy Michael Woods) in the climax, letting him know how it feels to be trapped. And there are some funny moments with her department store coworker Lionel (who is obviously gay) and Froggie, the teeth happy Doberman. Katya's life and home becomes a prison of fear because her privacy and life has been so invaded by this psycho. Her boyfriend Mac (Cotter Smith) disappears from the scene as her life spins more and more out of control (what happened to him?). One of the attitudes prevalent in cases such as these is, ""Did she invite this person into her life? Did she ask for it?"" Because of Katya's window-dressing, provocative and unique, it seems that many of the viewers at the time and the other characters may have thought so, there was absolutely nothing that she did to make her a victim. It seems that the victims of this crime are the ones that are punished, and Katya is no exception. She has to bar her windows, change her telephone number, stay inside all the time for fear of something happening to her, give up family and friends, and most of all, her sense of security. This is the sad and harsh reality of what stalking victims face. But the turning of the tables is what makes this movie. I recommend this to people who want a different view of stalking and feminism. I love the feminist slant!!! Worthwhile viewing, but don't watch it at night or alone, and be glad there are now anti-stalking laws, because at the time the film was shot, there wasn't. Don't pass up ""LADY BEWARE""!!!!!",1141171200,9,1879,4.562130177514793
210149,5,6300164616,"Lady Beware is an interesting and imperfect film, and yet I gave it 5 stars for two reasons: the tour-de-force performance by Diane Lane and the resolution, which is refreshingly non-violent and yet still exciting. Beautifully filmed on location in Pittsburgh, this film starts off well, lags a bit about 3/4 of the way through, but then picks up again for a great finale. I love the way Michael Woods, who plays the stalker, gets uglier both physically and emotionally as the film goes on, and I also enjoy the symbolism that the female director throws into the mix. But the reason to watch this film is Diane Lane, whose rage and breakdown and ultimate victory is achingly real. She truly carries this movie.",1103673600,12,710,4.733870967741935

7803267,5,6300164616,"I LOVED this movie many years ago when I saw it. I bought it, and then had it stolen from me. So, I'd love to have it again. I thought it was sexy and stylish and suspenseful. It was steamy, and mildly erotic, but nothing gritty or raw. I liked the character that Diane Lane played, and to me, the story captured my interest. I think it is a really beautifully filmed movie, very visually stimulating with a heroine that I cared about. She was smart and tough, and to me a refreshing glimpse of a woman who is not afraid of sensuality.",1423526400,,535,4.203883495145631

7803269,5,6300164616,"Finally a stalker movie without violence. This movie was directed by a woman with classy sexual over tones and not corny one's. Also I am glad the stalker was a doctor and not some low life fast food cook like in most movies. Again, you must appreciate that the stalker was just a pervert and not really dangerous. Just some schmuck that has nothing better to do with his spare time. As I said before this movie has very smooth and classy direction and gives you room to use a little imagination for yourself in stead of just laying it all out on the line for you. It also let's you know that some people just can't handle new idea's but can only accept old and boring one's. ( Never under estimate what dark secret's lurk deep with in men's mind's )",1407456000,2,750,4.288732394366197

Lady Beware (1987) ***1/2 / 4
D: Karen Arthur
C: Diane Lane, Michael Woods, Cotter Smith, Tyra Ferrell, Peter Nevargic, Edward Penn
P: A window dresser becomes the object of obsession for a married man who slowly makes her life a living hell.

It's interesting that in the same year that we got Fatal Attraction, we got Lady Beware, a sort of Fatal Attraction in reverse. Unlike Fatal Attraction, Lady Beware doesn't resort to cheap histrionics or obvious melodrama to get its point across. These are real people who are facing real dilemmas in their lives. It's a shame that the film's marketing would leave you to believe otherwise.

Jack Price (Woods) is the kind of guy that seems to have it all. He has a loving family. He has found a serious career path, but something isn't quite right. Something's missing. Enter Katya (Lane), a window dresser for a department store with a taste for the avant garde. Her window designs awaken something primal within Price.

At first the relationship between these two characters is a series of phone calls, but as Price becomes more fixated on Katya, his insidious nature is revealed. Whereas in Fatal Attraction, Glenn Close resorted to kidnapping kids and boiling bunny rabbits, we witness Price's evaluation as he becomes more and more dangerous. He's not just some caricatureish villain waiting in the wings with a butcher knife. Nor is Diane Lane's character some helpless victim who finds her power and strength as a result of springing out a gun and taking charge.

What happens over the course of the film is necessitated as a result of the inner changes that these characters have to come to terms with. When Lane's character has reached the point of no return, instead of turning to violence, she decides she wants to know what makes her stalker tick and turns the tables on him by giving him a taste of his own medicine.

It's refreshing to see a thriller that is both intelligent and perceptive, a thriller that is psychologically sound and dramatically fascinating, a thriller that doesn't cop out to sensationalism. Fatal Attraction may have got all the attention, but at least the people behind Lady Beware didn't compromise their vision and have made a flop that they can be proud of. [R] 108 mins.",1388534400,2,2366,4.844059405940594
7803271,3,6300164616,Don't remember movie being shot in so many shadows or it might be the VCR I used.  Viewing was adequate in a very dark room.  I'll try different settings to see if I can improve the brightness.  I'll update my review then.,1376956800,,222,4.238095238095238
7803272,5,6300164616,Big Diane Lane fan.  Surprised it's not on dvd.  Had it on VHS that I had taped from HBO years ago.  Started to fade.  Was glad to get another VHS at least.  Taped to a dvd and I put the VHS away for safe keeping,1368057600,,212,3.6222222222222222
