4592806,5,B0056WEX3W,"An afro-Cuban ""A Star is Born"", Chico y Rita is a beautiful love story whose mid-century jazz and hand drawn animation make this both an aural and visual delight.",1348272000,,162,4.620689655172414
4592807,5,B0056WEX3W,"This is one of those films that ""got away"" when it was on theater release here in the USA last year.  It was nominated for an Oscar as best animated movie and absolutely should have got the prize, but did not, and it got poor distribution, meaning it was virtually invisible even in a market such as Washington DC.

BUT IT IS A FABULOUS, DEEPLY MOVING MOVIE.

Anyone who loves jazz, or is prepared to let jazz love them, should get this DVD, as the film is a celebration of an amazing time in Cuban and American music, is remarkably wise about the racial and cultural politics of the time, tells a fantastically romantic and erotic love story, and has an ending (spoiler alert) that will have any sentient being in tears.  As you can tell, I absolutely loved this movie, and hope its release on DVD and Blu-Ray will give it the huge success that it deserves over here. Get it when it comes out--you will not be disappointed.  Viva Bebo! Viva Trueba!",1347408000,2,949,4.431034482758621

4592809,4,B0056WEX3W,"Excellent story illustrated by ""caricature-like"" animation of pre- and post communist Cuba, almost politically neutral, but nostalgic enough to bring back some great cuban music from the first half of the century. Other great north American composers and artists are portrayed in this journey back through time to happier times for the island and its talents. The British import Blu-ray has English subtitles that are non-removable, but not disturbing. The quality of the video is excellent, but the 5.1 DTS master soundtrack is absolutely exquisite. A very unique piece of filmmaking. I strongly recommend at least a viewing.",1333929600,6,626,5.3979591836734695
4592810,5,B0056WEX3W,"I love good animation, I love great music, and I love a good movie.

Three for three on ""Chico and Rita"". Two Afro-Cuban musicians who meet in classic ""cute"" movie fashion and then have an on-again, off-again, love affair in various locales (Havana, NYC, Las Vegas, etc.), and always, there is wonderful music (mostly jazz and Latin jazz) in the forefront or the background.

Let me pull on your coat about something here - the guy who plays the original piano pieces for this film is 93 years old. He's also playing the piano and conducting the Havana ballroom orchestra present in parts of the soundtrack, albeit when he was much, much younger as those recordings were made in the 40's and 50's. His name is Bebo Valdes, and he is as old-school as it gets at 93, but, man, that cat can still play.

I've ordered this film in advance as I know I will want to watch it at least a few times, and therefore I have no hesitation in recommending that you watch it at least once. Even if you don't particularly like jazz or animation, it stands on it's own as a great little movie.

Just a heads-up though - there are some adult moments and some animated nudity in the film, so bear that in mind if you're considering watching it and you've got children around the place.",1330214400,54,1266,4.420600858369099
4592811,5,B0056WEX3W,"Chico & Rita is a beautifully animated film, with an excellent storyline.  It creates an ambiance the viewer wants to be part of, and expressive characters we can almost touch.  It is a love story that follows a young pianist and a young singer starting from the late 1940s Havana. The film takes us many places geographically and emotionally.  The situations and dialogs are very real and sharp.  The film is happy and tragic, just like life itself.  One needs to be a certain age to understand the motivations and emotions within, therefore I would recommend it for viewers 18 years of age or older.",1327968000,18,601,4.685714285714286
4592812,4,B0056WEX3W,"Chico and Rita is the third Latin movie throughout the last two decades(after Buena Vista Social Club and Estudio 54), inspired on Latin music, but unlike the previous ones it's much more ambitious about its proposal.

Fernando Trueba made an amazing journey through some unforgettable moments and first-rate figures of jazz to tell us a love story that looks like a tragic bolero sprayed with this bitter ending cadence ruptruras, troubles and nostalgia.

Both are from humble origin, but each of them bursts on stage and shine like a star for its own account. And despite the conflicts come and go the love never does.

A memorable tribute to Chano Pozo, Gillespie, Parker, Casablanca, Boggie, Tito Puente, Miguel Valdez and Tito Rodriguez, among other ones. Interesting artistic proposal and refreshing gaze to the Latin Universe.",1315094400,39,833,5.155555555555556
4592813,4,B0056WEX3W,"`Chico and Rita' is a wonderful animation mainly set in Havana, Cuba, but also taking in New York, Paris and Las Vegas.  It follows a piano player (Chico) and a singer (Rita) who have an impassioned and stormy relationship.  You see how they meet and fall in love, how they perform together and how their paths divide and cross again throughout their lives.

The animation is very stylised and at the same time beautiful.  It has some great effects where it seems almost 3D (for example when they ride a motorbike down the street) and whilst it may seem simple I would contend that this is deceptive.

As this is based around music you would be right in thinking this is a key aspect to the film and I adored the laid back Cuban jazz on offer.  I am slightly biased as I am a fan of this type of music anyway, but it is especially good here.

The plot is good enough to keep you interested and although my wife found it rather slow in places, I personally enjoyed the story it weaved.

Overall this is a very stylish and entertaining film.  You will love it if you have been to Cuba and you can quite happily spend the film `spotting' places you have been to, but the story and music really elevates this above other run-of-the-mill animated films out there.  Well worth checking out at some point.

4592835,4,B0056WEX3W,"CHICO & RITA is a notable achievement - an animated love-story that makes some trenchant points about the ways in which human beings were constrained during the Forties and Fifties.

In the tradition of the Spanish bolero, the main plot is a picaresque tale focusing on how Chico (voiced by Eman Xor Oa) and Rita (Limara Meneses) encounter one another at a nightclub, fall in love, and then keep falling out of love until they are finally separated in New York.  Rita becomes a big Broadway and Hollywood star, while Chico remains a piano-player working most nights in clubs, until he accepts an offer to join Dizzy Gillespie's band on tour.  As time passes, so the fortunes of both protagonists fluctuate, but the film ends happily when both are  coming up to retirement age.

What sets Tono Errando and Javier Mariscal's film apart is the way in which they depict the political and social realities facing Cubans in the immediate post-war period.  During the Batista era, Havana was swarming with Americans, who not only spent lots of money but treated the locals like dirt on account of their skin color.  Chico experiences one moment of sickening racism from a tourist who objects to his 'harassing' Rita.  When the two of them decamp to New York, the situation doesn't change much; like most people of color, they live segregated lives and have to perform for mostly white audiences, speaking English rather than their native Spanish.  Chico's agent Ramon (voiced by Mario Guerra) appears to have forged a successful career as an agent, but even he is subject to the whims of his often capricious white counterparts.

Even when Chico returns to Cuba, he is still not free of discrimination.  As the Batista regime collapses, and Fidel Castro takes over, he finds that he is no longer wanted; jazz music is symbolic of the so-called 'decadent' west, and hence no longer acceptable to the new government.  He ends up having to eke out a pitiful existence as a shoeshine boy.

As a technical achievement, CHICO & RITA cannot be bettered.  The directors make much of the contrast between the bright lights of the big cities - Havana, New York - and the seedy boardinghouses where Chico and Rita live.  They spend their lives trying to entertain rich upper middle-class clients, but they themselves live hand-to-mouth existences, enlivened only by the occasional pick-up.  The jazz music that forms a soundtrack to the film is a definite plus; together with the visuals, it reminds us of how the genre originated as a response to poverty and deprivation in the early part of the twentieth century.",1410652800,,2597,4.854875283446712

4592860,5,B0056WEX3W,"Italian filmmaker Federico Fellini once attended a cocktail party where a movie critic, wishing to impress the legendary director, walked up to him and said, 'Mr. Fellini, I have seen all of your movies.'

Fellini appraised him with a cold eye and said, 'How many times?'

I can tell you that after buying a DVD of 'Chico and Rita' three months ago, that I have viewed it at least 10 times. I have watched this remarkable film alone, with my grandchildren, with my daughter and with friends. Each time it gets better. the music, the story line, the art work and especially the ending.  This is a superb film that stands alone.

I like the DVD so much that I bought 'Calle 54,' a DVD about Latin jazz featuring the top Latin jazz greats of the past 50 years. Calle 54 was good, but it cannot touch 'Chico and Rita' for emotional impact and pure enjoyment. A film about music and musicians is fine but it is only about music. 'Chico and Rita' has some wonderful music from start to finish, but it is also a story about people that you can relate to and care about.

They fall in love but their tempestuous natures conspire to keep them apart. There is a maudlin and pretty unrealistic ending to the movie which is what prompted me to downgrade it from five to four stars. But for most of its length, this was a spellbinding movie.

The music is terrific -- bebop and jazz ballads abound. The animation is voicing of the characters are also terrific. The director had live actors play each scene and then had his animators draw it so the way the bodies move is very realistic. The depiction of Havana and its clubs and streets is wonderful. The New York Latin jazz scene of the 1950s also comes to life vividly.

In short, I recommend this movie to music lover and lovers of love. The ending is not a serious detraction.",1369180800,2,879,4.556962025316456

4592867,5,B0056WEX3W,"I absolutely loved this movie!! the story line was both romantic,sorrowful, exciting and an entrancing take into lost love in the most triumphant of ways. The animation style is like nothing that I have seen before being fluid,and colorful. The MUSIC!!!! I could watch this movie for the music alone. I would recommend this movie as a must have for any lover of animation, music and once in a lifetime films.",1364083200,,408,4.76056338028169

4592869,5,B0056WEX3W,"I'm usually not a fan of animated movies but when I saw the film festival award for animation I decided to buy it. The film did not disappoint, the music and animation was great and I love that it's in Spanish.",1363910400,,210,4.146341463414634
4592870,5,B0056WEX3W,"I love this movie!! I am a jazz lover anyway, but this love story along with all the beautiful music is just classic.  I ordered it from Nexflix, then immediately purchased it for my collection from Amazon.  I love this movie.  It beautiful, sad, hopeful, inspiring and loving all at the same time.",1363305600,,298,4.584905660377358
4592871,5,B0056WEX3W,"I rarely watch animations and almost never review movies. This one is so exceptional that I feel compelled to gush a little so forgive me in advance.

First, this movie weaves in factual events with a great storyline. For example, the circumstances leading to Chano Pozzo's actual death are portrayed, as is the overall allure to many Cuban musicians of what musicians like Dizzy Gillespie, Charlie Parker and their New York peers were creating. In real life Dizzy did as much as any major jazz musician in NY to include the Afro-Cuban rhythms into bebop and beyond.

The music itself is a character in this movie. What a feast! It inspired me to start listening to pure Cuban music by some of the pioneers cited in the movie. Consequently, I have fallen in love with musicians to whom I would have never paid attention like Machito (a good starting point is&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Ritmo-Caliente/dp/B00006OYM4/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Ritmo Caliente</a>), Cachao (start with&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Master-Session-1/dp/B0012GMYJ6/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Master Session 1</a>) and a plethora of others who pioneered this music.

Of course the animation - simply beautiful - and the storyline that is gritty, musical and touching are reasons enough to watch this movie. Like the music, both Havana and New York City are also characters in this movie. The scenes are period-correct and the colors are also consistent with the era. It's uncanny how well the essences of both cities are captured and personified.

Do be aware that some scenes are explicit, making this an adult movie in every sense of the word. It's also a love story. And a musical.

If you love music, and especially Afro-Cuban influenced jazz that came out of the late 1940s/early 1950s, you will love this movie. Heck, if you are a sucker for a great love story you'll also love it.",1362700800,11,1957,5.488372093023256
4592872,5,B0056WEX3W,Loved it...I watch it all the time. I love the animation and the story. The music is fantastic and had me dancing while I was watching it. Takes you to another place in time.,1361664000,,174,4.147058823529412
4592873,5,B0056WEX3W,"This movie is great, even if you don't understand Spanish well. The music is gorgeous, and the characters and settings are so well drawn, you feel like you are right there! Also, from what I understand, the story is very close to the truth.",1360022400,,240,4.4772727272727275
4592874,3,B0056WEX3W,"I wanted to like this movie so much.  And for some parts I did - the graphics, the music, and Cuban history.  However the central story of the love of Chico and Rita is so poorly written, with sparse character motivation, predictable plot points, even an ending that seems more tacked on that evolved.that I cannot give it any higher stars.  The makers of the movie had such a wonderful opportunity to increase awareness of Cuba and its amazing culture and music. But the mistake was using these  two flimsy characters to advance that cause.",1359849600,2,541,4.663157894736842

4592877,5,B0056WEX3W,"I'd waited almost a year for the dvd that was playable in the U.S. Region to become available but when Amazon notified me I immediately ordered 5 copies for myself and friends because I knew this was going to be a very special film and it was. The plot revolves around a love story between 2 young cubans told against the backdrop of the history of both pre Castro to present day Cuba and the evolution of latin jazz; covering a lot of ground convincingly, excitingly and surprisingly historically accurate. I think the fact that it is an animated film only adds to the story telling and in a sense was probably the most evocative and creative way to tell such a story and in the process bring a piece of history into the current day for audiences that would walk away from a more traditional documentary approach because make no mistake although its a fictional love story it is also very much a documentary. I'm an old man who lived through much of these events and think that beside being enjoyable this film is a great educational tool to teach about an era that recedes further and further back in history.",1357689600,,1111,4.5049504950495045
4592878,5,B0056WEX3W,"This was given as a Christmas gift. I had already rented and watched the DVD. I watched it again with the friend to whom I gave as a gift.

It's a must see!",1356998400,,309,5.0
4592881,5,B0056WEX3W,"OMG.  Just finished viewing this movie--so powerful.  I could not take my eyes away from the screen.
The story is very bittersweet; it tugs at your heartstrings.  The animation is brilliant.  It
just feels like you are there.  Not a fan of jazz but have to say the music is awesome.
This barely played in the theaters--I am so glad I did not forget about it.
Tip--I always make a list of movies I think I might like to see, so then
when they disappear from the theaters I will remember them.",1356825600,,491,4.293478260869565
4592882,3,B0056WEX3W,"The movie has a lot going for it, music, romance, but its a movie that doesn't feel period correct. There are a lot of assumptions on the part of the film makers in interpreting how Cuba was in the late 40's. The movie also shows Cubans to be mostly of dark skin but there were/are just as many of light to fair skin that were not represented as part of the general populous. I won't spoil the movie but the ""romance"" between the two characters could have been rewritten. I would recommend renting and see for yourself.",1356652800,,519,4.360824742268041

4592886,5,B0056WEX3W,"This is an exquisitely animated film that exemplifies the full nature of cinematic artistic free speech. This is not Disney, so eliminate the stereotype that all animation is supposed to be for the kiddies. This is a film for big boys and big girls; also known as ""adults who are emotionally mature"". The film celebrates Latin-Jazz and is unapologetic in its approach in grown-up storytelling. The movie is Oscar-nominated and enlightens viewers to an engaging narrative about Afro-Cuban Jazz by painting a picture told through an animated story about two lovers named Chico and Rita. These characters go through the efforts of achievement and misfortune illustrated by means of superb animation and splendid voice-acting. The film also boasts an incredible soundtrack of Cuban Jazz. The icing on the cake is the cameos from some of the great Jazz Bebop legends such as Thelonious Monk, Charlie Parker and Dizzy Gillespie.

The art is rendered in vibrant and luscious colors. The backgrounds are authentic and effervescent. Havana and New York really resemble their real-life counterparts of the old setting that this story takes place. The designs of the characters are simple yet give the impression of liveliness which enables them to immaculately intertwine with each background. Also, as previously mentioned, the soundtrack of the movie is a superb treat for the ears with the icing on the cake being cameos from some of the Bebop Jazz greats. It is the combination of these elements that make for an authentic organic viewing experience.

Highly recommended for those who enjoy organic Latin-Jazz, good-looking animation, and grown-up storytelling!",1351296000,2,1655,5.2889733840304185

A beautiful adult love story with characters who are very real. They have a lot of personality, are well  rounded and sentimental with rough edges. The movie touches on a couple of adult themes at the time.

I think the look they went for is great, the animation is both fun and sensual. The movie above anything else was a homage to legendary Cuban musicians and the struggle they went through to be recognized for their talent as well as their culture.

It's a Jazz musical with a lot of heart.",1349049600,3,766,4.335664335664336
