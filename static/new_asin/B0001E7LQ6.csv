8011629,5,B0001E7LQ6,"What a fun, funny film! A fantastic flick for the family to watch together. These kids are going to be stars, and John Laroquette is hilarious.",1351036800,3,143,4.538461538461538
8011630,1,B0001E7LQ6,"This movie is on the level of a badly written sit-com. There is not one original idea in it. Every gag is telegraphed from a mile away. Every character is a cartoon cut-out and there is nothing even approaching a real performance. It's pretty clear that the actors involved knew they were turning out schlock and were only in it for a paycheck. I have liked John Larroquette in many other things, but even he doesn't seem at all invested in this. I sat through about 30-40 minutes of this nonsense before I decided it wasn't worth any more of my time. If you are looking in your local video store for a good comedy and you happen across this wretched excuse for a movie, do yourself a favor and rent whatever's next to it. It's bound to be better.",1207612800,,747,4.3428571428571425
8011631,5,B0001E7LQ6,"It's ""Home Alone"" crossed with ""Spy Kids"" but at a restaurant. I had marvelous time watching this fast-paced comedy with my grandchildren. More funny twists than a pretzel.",1125273600,6,172,5.178571428571429
8011632,3,B0001E7LQ6,"Tonight's selection was Recipe for Disaster. John Larroqutte and Leslie Ann Warren play parents who open up a new resturant in hopes of making it big, along with their 3 kids. Low and behold, just next door, there is an established resturant, and the owners are not in the least excited to see compeition.  Let the hyjix happen, in this somewhat fun kids movie. Throughout the film the parents go through oodles of problems, including the resturant license being lost, and having to race through town in order to get a new one, and the resturant open in time. Meanwhile, the kids are back at the resturant, trying to make a go of the grand opening, while the nosey resturantures next door are trying their best to have the place closed!

A fun family film, and something you are not ashamed to show the kids.  I find this film to appeal to age groups 9-12, or there abouts. The script is not that complicated, acting is ok, for something of this calibur, therefore, for something to just sit down and have a good time with, I would recommend this movie!",1121385600,8,1053,4.531578947368421
8011633,1,B0001E7LQ6,"This brain-less, un-funny ""comedy"" is one of the worst movies I have ever seen. Absolutely atrocious. Idiotic acting, annoying characters, dumb screenplay and the most stupid plot ever conceived in film history, this is one film that will most certainly be shown on Mystery Science Theater 3000, if the show is ever resurrected. For now, avoid this pile of crap at all costs.",1093219200,3,375,4.968253968253968
