2666513,4,B000J2BBIE,"The Ellen DeGenerous show has long been marked as one of the best and most favorite talk show amongst people worldwide. DVD-licious encapsulates some of the best and favorite and fun moments on the show, giving those who fell in love with this show later in its seasons (like me!) to watch what made this show so successful and what made Ellen so well-loved.

DVD-licious is fun, exciting and since it's all captured in a nutshell, you only get to watch the good episodes and the ones that keep you laughing and going for hours.

2666514,2,B000J2BBIE,"I'm kind of  to old to Dance like Ellen DeGeneres... I leave this for young people that dance like Ellen DeGeneres...She is funny but how I wish she could teach Elderlies, how to dance like her.  If I ever Dance like Ellen I will probably brake my delicate bones and I know she not going to have time to take care of an elderly person like me.",1387497600,,343,4.104477611940299

2666527,5,B000J2BBIE,"If you like Ellen Degeneres and her kind of humour, you have to get this dvd. It's really funny and gave me a quite a few laughs. The only downside I can think of is that it's too short. After three seasons they should have so much more to show, but I still love it.",1183852800,2,266,3.8545454545454545
2666528,5,B000J2BBIE,"This is an extremely funny 2 disc set. If you love ellen, you'll be quoting this movie for a while.  Loved this movie.  The best moments of her talk show.",1180310400,,154,4.1

2666530,5,B000J2BBIE,"Ellen is definately one of a kind.  I love the show - I try and catch it all the time and this was so much fun reliving some of the more hillarious parts of a terrific show.  I don't know how they picked out these segments because there must be thousands and thousands of pieces to choose from, but I think they did a good job.  I particularly love the segment where she's out on the road with three student drivers and their instructor.  I laughed until I cried watching that again.  You see Steve Martin doing all kinds of card tricks and juggling and Jim Carrey's famous bike ride through the set.  I also really love the little girl who sings the State song.  She's adorable.

The second disc is purley monologues without the dancing, but still it's fantastic.  It's a great dvd set that you can watch a couple of times over without getting bored.  Ellens personality is infectious and you'll have a ball re-watching your favourite parts of the first three seasons.  I know I did.",1169337600,22,984,4.441340782122905
2666531,5,B000J2BBIE,"This dvd just shows many of Ellen's best moments from her first few seasons.

Being from the UK I was unable to see these seasons as they only just began to show Ellen here. So I enjoyed every moment of Ellenness.",1168646400,9,213,4.195121951219512
2666532,5,B000J2BBIE,"Ellen DeGeneres is the funniest person in the world and these scenes from her show are great!  I appreciate the fact that she can be funny without being vulgar.  She is not only funny, but also she is so real.  She may be entertaining us, but she seems to be having as much fun as we are laughing with her.  Ellen's talk show is a great way for all of us that never saw her in standup to appreciate this classic comic!!",1168560000,16,419,4.073170731707317
2666533,4,B000J2BBIE,"Great grouping of clips, missed the opportunity to showcase Ellen's dance moves in a montage, but maybe next time.  Laughter is still the best medicine!",1168300800,6,152,5.08

8148773,5,B000J2BBIE,"If you need something to watch which will make you chuckle and laugh out loud, these takes from her show will do it.  I like her quirkiness and ability to bring out the humor in every situation.",1402790400,,194,4.243243243243243
8148774,5,B000J2BBIE,"What can't you say about Ellen?  If you missed any of the first years of The Ellen DeGeneres show, then you need to own this dvd. It is filled with laughter, and touching moments from beginning to end.  As a christian, it was so awesome to see her come into her own, after the salacious insults from Jerry Falwell and others like him. I promise, you will love this, and watch it again, and again.",1401321600,,396,4.266666666666667
8148775,5,B000J2BBIE,"This DVD contains parts of episodes from early seasons of the show (including the very first episode with Jennifer Aniston as a guest) which is really nostalgic and funny. I enjoyed watching it a lot. My only complaint is that I wish it was longer, you know, like how anytime you start watching Ellen, you just cannot stop. I wish there were vol. 2, 3, 4,... of this.

To TEDS staff, if you're reading, please make DVDs like this for every season of the show!",1395360000,,459,4.4
