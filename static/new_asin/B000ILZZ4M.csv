8146231,4,B000ILZZ4M,"I purchased this DVD because I have been trying to do more workouts using resistance bands or tubing.  Firm Fat Burning Cardio Sculpt (also called Cardio TONING) uses the latter, called a ""resistance cord"" in this workout.  (I believe that this DVD was originally packaged with the cord, but I did not purchase it that way.)  The routine is led by Firm instructor Tina Smalley in a rather bland studio with papered over windows.  There are four background exercisers, one of whom, Allie, modifies some of the exercises.

Tina begins with a fairly typical Firm warm-up that combines aerobic activity with dynamic stretching (note: the band is not used here).  Moves include marches, step-touch, arm circles, hamstring curls, squats, squats with knees and abductions, and rear dips.  The warm-up is somewhat lengthy at 6.5 minutes, but it is relatively fast-paced, so it does start to raise the heart rate.

Picking up the cord and stepping on it with both feet, Tina starts work that would be best described as aerobic toning.  She performs a series which includes squats, biceps curls, back rows, side lunge with one-arm upright row, one-arm chest press, and hamstring work, then repeats the entire series on the second side, finishing with triceps kickbacks.  Next, Tina ups the cardio factor a bit by standing on the band and stepping side-to-side while performing abductions to the side and to the rear.  Holding the band in the hands, she repeats the leg movements while doing arm work such as lat pull downs and chest expanders, adding in lunges as well and then running through the entire sequence a second time.

Now Tina says that it's time to switch to abs work, but first she continues with some additional standing moves.  She starts with the band under one foot for squats with abductions and one-arm overhead press; this is followed by a side lunge with one-arm triceps extension.  With the band under the feet, she performs a standing oblique crunch, and then with the band in the hands overhead, she brings elbow to knee.  Coming down to the mat, Tina begins seated with the band under the feet for rows and half rollbacks, adding a twist.  Next, she performs work on all fours, including straight leg lifts, hamstring curls, and bent leg lifts (band around one foot).

The final 4.5 minutes of this routine are devoted to stretching.  Tina uses the band, starting with a reclined leg stretch.  After doing a prone quad stretch and cat/cow on all fours (no band), she comes to seated and performs several additional stretches with the band to finish.  The workout concludes at 30.5 minutes.

Overall, I liked this workout.  I thought that Tina used the band effectively and led the routine well.  i was a bit disappointed that there was not more of a cardio focus--with so much time spent with the warm-up and the matwork, the main part of the workout was quite short.  Still, I would recommend this routine, which would work especially well as a travel workout.",1381708800,,2977,4.826429980276134
