8540826,4,B009F12QZ2,"I purchased this DVD because my mother loves The King. I don't speak spanish but I love the music; it's the music of my childhood. My mother was very appreciative.  She told me that the songs are ""new"" not the old standards that I thought would be on it.  However it's a wonderful video!  Although the quality is not bad but the format is a little ""strange"".",1363392000,,358,4.313432835820896
8540827,4,B009F12QZ2,"I have to mention at first, that I collect all music CD's or DVD's with the great Mexican Singer Vicente Fernandez.

This is a good DVD. I was curious about learning more about Vicente Fernandez's oldest son.
I have to mention, that by far Vicente Fernandez has definitely the better voice, he is simply
the best.

I would recommend to buy this DVD, pictures of the Mexican landscape are very nice too.

Great transaction!",1359676800,,422,4.675675675675675
