8630071,5,B00H4ZEJFQ,"This is a 60 minute video with English SDH subtitles.
It tells the story of Germany bringing the war to civilians far behind the battle lines in WWI. For the 1st time London was attacked from the air. In the 2  years that these attacks occurred hundreds died both in London and in some of the surrounding areas.

The way these zeppelins were built by Count Ferdinand von Zeppelin is shown, including films of today and computer reenactments from WWI.

The talking heads- those that narrate and illustrate some methods, are done well - almost a conversational style and then examining the types of bombs dropped and how the British finally came upon the method to shoot down these behemoths.
It's a fascinating film for those who like history, and aviation, and military weapons.",1408147200,20,778,4.791044776119403
