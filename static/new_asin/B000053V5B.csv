1390056,3,B000053V5B,"This movie is pretty much wall-to-wall sex, surrounding a massage therapist who gets more nookie than really should be allowed by law or convention. He's banging four different chicks and beds all of them at different times before the movie hits the 20-minute mark.

Sounds great, doesn't it? Only in this version (Rated R, based on seller description), you won't see as much as you probably will want to see. Several of the sex scenes are edited strangely--they go into a weird slow motion--which makes me believe that there is indeed an unrated cut out there somewhere, if only it can be found. That version might well earn five stars.

Mia Zottoli-Ava Lake (among other stage names) makes an early, pre-op appearance here, where she is playing--will wonders never cease?--a fairly chaste young woman of 19. I didn't say that this movie was very believable.

One thing that bugs me about this film is an obvious attempt to try to hijack the popularity of the movie ""Animal Instinct,"" even down to the cover art. Because nothing about this movie makes you think ""Animal Attraction: Carnal Desires.""",1249171200,47,1099,4.897849462365591

1390059,2,B000053V5B,"As a media fan this movie is, shall we say, titillating with a cute concept, but very disappointing. It is very slow and has minimal music.",980208000,2,139,4.384615384615385
1390060,4,B000053V5B,a very intersting movie but it was cut to short and it needs more sceen action,979862400,2,78,3.9375
7930060,3,B000053V5B,Didn't care for this one that much. I thought it was going to be similar to 50 Shades of Grey. And it wasn't that good at all.,1454544000,,126,3.7037037037037037

7930065,2,B000053V5B,"I bought this film feeling hopeful that it'd be exactly what I was looking for, wrong. This film was definitely a let down, especially because I generally have great taste in movies. The film was nothing like it advertised. It was way too soft-core and it doesn't show you anything except breasts and a coy smile.",1358035200,2,313,4.607142857142857

7930067,5,B000053V5B,"Fantastic cast. Another view to animal attraction. Well I loved it with another group of twenty at our soiree party get together. Great imagination, not the best film production, but certainly can live with that. Great Main actor and complimenting cast. The ladies were showing off their best. So they should. The movie is fantastic. Wish I could meet the actors. Great , job well done. There is a realistic side to this movie, and I loved the soft touch to it. Variety is the spice of life when comp[ared with other movies. The script, has meaning very entertaining. I would recommend it hands down. Very artistic and we found it NON offensive.",1335571200,5,645,4.716814159292035
7930068,2,B000053V5B,"The movie was brand new when it came to the house.  I have no issues with that.  Couldn't get into the movie.  20 minutes into it, I stopped it and then threw it away.",1327795200,,167,3.8529411764705883
7930069,2,B000053V5B,I did not find this to be entertaining.  Horrible acting.  To me it was a waste of time.  Would not suggest this movie,1319760000,4,118,4.043478260869565
