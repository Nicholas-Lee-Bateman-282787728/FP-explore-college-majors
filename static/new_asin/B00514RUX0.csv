Just be aware this is the original Japanese audio with English subtitles. For a purest this is a good thing since the English dub versions were not very well done.

It is imported, it's the Malaysian licensed edition, which is a lot better quality than the Hong Kong imports.

The only one that might be better is the Japan import, unfortunately the Japan import sells for around $500 and even the American release with English dub typically would sell for $300+

The Malaysian import is a great value compared to what you would pay for this compared to those. The Hong Kong import version sells for around the same as this but is lower quality.

The case isn't great, but all the discs were protected. They were stored in individual soft sleeves, which with the number of discs in the set and how compact the box is, I guess that's probably the safest way. Had they been on individual spindles in such a tight space they would probably all get damaged if one came loose. I've definitely seen worse packed imports.",1307059200,,1078,4.564766839378239
