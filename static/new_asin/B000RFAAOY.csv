8200329,4,B000RFAAOY,"Watched this DVD one time through this morning and it is an excellent documentary of steam's final revenue excursion over Cajon pass in 1955 sponsored as a special by the Railway Club of Southern California.  There are shots of the train meeting the Super Chief, the Grand Canyon Limited, and the El Capitan as it travels from Los Angeles Union Station to Barstow and return.  The train stops in Barstow so the passengers can get lunch at the Harvey House while the eastbound train is ""wyed"" (turned around to point west for return to LA on a y shaped track).  There is video from the stops at the stations at Pasadena, San Bernardino, Oro Grande, and Barstow but very little, if any of Victorville - though some spectacular run by footage of the crossing of the Lower Narrows bridge.  Some of this video focuses on the lengths the photographers went to for video from atop the flat-topped oil tender and even the locomotive cab roof.  There are great shots from inside the cab with emphasis on the engineers and the cleaning of the firebox.  As the locomotive comes off Cajon's summit, it is able to approach 100mph speeds on desert straight running.  There is also some photography at the end of the video showing 3759 as she exists today at Locomotive Park in Kingman, Arizona.  The sun begins to set as 3759 approaches the summit for the descent down the San Gabriel mountains for the return to LA.  There is some great scenery in this video with footage around Sullivan's Curve and some spectacular shots of snow on the San Gabriel mountains in 1955 before smog became a visibility issue.  This is one of my favorite Pentrex videos and a must have for fans of Santa Fe steam and Cajon Pass.  Some suggestions to Pentrex for future editing or releases of this video:
a.  Give a short history and perhaps Baldwin builder's photos of this locomotive at the beginning as well as some video footage or still pictures of 3759 in regular service; b. On the observation car of this train there is mounted a locomotive bell that has some prominence in the footage - can the significance of this bell be explained? c. There is a short sequence of the locomotive pulling out of the Oro Grande station in a fast forward condition and this should be slowed down to regular speed.

I used to be a big fan of Santa Fe 2900 and 3776 series Northerns with the larger tenders, but, after viewing this video, I have acquired a new found aesthetic appreciation for the 3751 class and even have the new O Scale 3759 Santa Fe Northern, with a more proportional tender, on order from Lionel.",1322870400,,2573,4.579520697167756
