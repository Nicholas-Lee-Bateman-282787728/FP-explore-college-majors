7975797,3,B00007G1UQ,"PRAY FOR DEATH is a fairly typical small collection of primarily older Euro-fright films. These middling movies still hold some shocks here and there, however. A nice set for horror film completists.

SYNOPSES:

""Night Of The Death Cult"" - This fourth installment of the ""Blind Dead"" series has the Knights Templar haunting a fishing village.

""Satanic Rites Of Dracula"" - The last entry in the Lee/Cushing Dracula series has modern-day Scotland Yard investigating a case of vampirism.

""Sisters Of Death"" - A rather depressing class reunion of sorts is central to this film.

""The Werewolf And The Vampire Woman"" - Lesbian vampires- what more could a boy ask for?

Pray for death (which was a superb ninja movie)

Amazon should correct this wrong listing",1106784000,,211,4.833333333333333
7975800,2,B00007G1UQ,"When you buy one of those DVD sets which include several films for a cheap price, you often get what you pay for; PRAY FOR DEATH is an outstanding case in point. THE UGLY: One reason why I got this one is NIGHT OF THE DEATH CULT, which is the fourth of the Blind Dead series, and I'm sorry to report that the picture quality is atrocious. It clearly came from a substandard videotape source, and is full of the sort of hideous artifacts that plagued budget VHS tapes. Let's hope for a better copy of this title someday soon. THE BAD: The prerelease info indicated that the notorious MARK OF THE DEVIL PART 2 was part of this package, but if you ordered it for that reason, you're going to be bumming, as DEATH CULT is the only announced title which is actually included...come on, guys! THE GOOD: As to the movies which ended up being included, THE WEREWOLF VS THE VAMPIRE WOMAN is a campy Paul Naschy vehicle which is entertaining in its goofy fashion. SISTERS OF DEATH features an odd performance by 1950s Sci-Fi hero Arthur Franz as he menaces, among others, the ill-fated Playboy model Claudia Jennings...this one offers better acting than usually seen in such low-budget fare. And, lastly, we have the ubiquitous SATANIC RITES OF DRACULA in a pretty decent letterbox print. I guess that Hammer (or whoever owns rights) must really not care about this title, judging from the number of cheap DVDs on which it can be found. All three of this group are watchable, if not exactly DVD demo material. VERDICT: All in all, it's OK for the price, but I'll be more wary in the future.",1043020800,,1580,4.527972027972028
