8234458,4,B000YYNQDA,"Poor quality on the recording. At times it's difficult to clearly hear instructor. Must watch and observe the movements of individual and try to follow along. Instruction in slow tempo, followed by regular speed.
Very basic instruction dance steps but best instruction I have bought so far. You can actually see what parts of the body move and how to move it
with instructor's coaching. Despite the quality of this DVD, if your goal is to learn Tahitian dancing, this is a good instructional to start with. Although
short, you will get the basic understanding of the dance steps.
Tahitian Dance Basics 2, builds on what is learned here. Together you will gain a gentle confidence in this style of polynesian dance. Practice is the key!",1434412800,,735,4.841269841269841
8234459,4,B000YYNQDA,Nice photography - like the front and back views.  Clear instructions.  Good practice.  Not many steps or motions included.  Should have combined Vol. 1 & Vol 2.  Great for beginners.,1428192000,,183,4.966666666666667
8234460,3,B000YYNQDA,"The dvd consists of approximately 20 minutes of drills and explanation of some basic tahitian moves.  I own many tahitian and hula dance dvds, and in my opinion, this dvd is not worth the money.  If the instructor would have added even 10 or20 minutes of a performance, that would have redeemed the video.",1426809600,,305,4.62962962962963
8234461,5,B000YYNQDA,"I wanted this dvd for over a year, but it was no longer available.  I received the DVD in a timely matter.  It was exactly what I wanted.  I was very pleased with the service and the product.",1331510400,,191,3.973684210526316
8234462,3,B000YYNQDA,"I would not put this dvd in a category with beginner unless you have experience with this or similar dances/ and or pick up dance moves fast. The actual working parts of the dvd including practice and instruction is roughly around 18minutes. I watched it on my computer to get the actual time. The actual dvd totals somewhere around 20minutes. The beginning screen shows moving pictures and says Tahitian dance for beginners with Kehaue. You click on the Kehaue and it takes you to the actual instruction. There is no other menu to skip parts which makes sense. Since the dvd in itself is basically a drill dvd.

  The segment begins with a clip of Kehaue dancing, then goes into a brief explanation on what the dvd is about. The author does state that this dvd is for those who are taking classes or have never taken any before.
She breaks down how to properly stand, into hip bumps, double hip bumps and the umi. She should have added the figure 8 that would have been a nice practice addition. Despite the lack of depth of instruction Kehaue is a good instructor. She shows what things should and should not look like. There is not warm -up and no-cool down. There was no footwork, and no breakdown of arm patterns.

  It is more or less a drills dvd,so the shelf life is going to be a decent amount of time. There is no segment on music which left me dissapointed, if you are going to have a dvd that is super short you could at least throw in a bit about the history of dance even if it was a written section that appeared on the screen.and maybe a tad about the music, even if it was just one or two basic rhythms. Things that would truly get a beginner started in a dance form. Overall the dvd has good lighting and focused camera angles. The set alternated back and forth between mirrors and no mirrors. Kehaue's back is facing the viewer much of the time. But for the movement she presents it makes it much easier to see how the execution should look. Something that annoyed me was, the screens kept changing although you would be in the middle of a drill,the drill itself  never stopped but Kehaue would be in another room doing the same thing.

  With all of that said for some reason I like this dvd. I like that the timing is short and that is does not cover 50 billion things. Although like I said adding something about the music or history would have been nice. I prefer to master a couple of things and then move on. I also like the fact that the moves are drilled nearly the entire time BUT if you are going to make a dvd less than 30minutes and price it $19.95 plus shipping and handling-and the Production quality is nice as far as being able to see everything clearly but this is definately not a high end production dvd- and the instructional dvd content was okay but should have been more indepth the price is a bit much. The pricing I used is the actual pricing from the website [...]since amazon does not usually have it in stock.

  Is the dvd worth it-if you take classes but are not super advanced, this would be a nice dvd to have although you may want a longer drilling section. If you bellydance or do similar dance that involve hipwork you might catch on to this fast. If you have any of Kili's  hula dvd's and can work with them then this dvd might be for you. Still I think it is overpriced. If you can get it for cheaper say $8-$13, then this will be worth it.",1326326400,2,3395,4.3092621664050235
8234463,5,B000YYNQDA,"i bought this cause my company is having a corporate luau in march. i want to dance and show off a little...lol. great product. It's an indie production but it's good. It covers the basics and is not hard to follow. i bought tahitian dance fitness (theres a lot of them for sale) but it didn't help me learn anything. that was a workout DVD. this is not a workout DVD but more like instruction kind of like at a dance studio, but at home because your watching it. so just know that this one teaches you the dance techniques, the other ones are more for workout. I like how she instructs and dances! I would have liked it to be a little longer in time though.",1325721600,,658,4.188976377952756
8234464,3,B000YYNQDA,"Quite a good DVD for beginners to Tahitian dance.  Easy to follow and nice presentation, but a bit over-priced, as the entire DVD is only about 1/2 hour long.  Found ""Introduction to Polyneasian Dance with Tumata"" more informative and better value at 70 minutes.  This would be a good DVD for beginners if the price was a little lower, because you will need to order part two to learn more than two basic steps.  If you want to learn ALL of the basic steps for Otea and Aparima, go with Tumata's DVD.",1214438400,2,500,4.4021739130434785
8234465,5,B000YYNQDA,This is a great learning tool for beginning dancers. Kehau demonstrates repeatedly so you can practice along with her. It shows you exactly what you should look like while dancing. It doesn't go too fast and It doesn't loose me in a bunch of fancy choreography. Polynesian styles aren't easy to learn and i have been unhappy with other titles that mislead you into thinking that they're INSTRUCTIONAL when their not. She mentions a part two and I look forward to learning more technique. I will take her advice and master her series before seeking out a group to dance with.,1202342400,8,574,4.693069306930693
8234466,5,B000YYNQDA,Kehau does an excellent job of taking you through the three basic foundations of learning the tamure. There is multiple 'practice' segments to reinforce what she is teaching. Highly recommended for the self learner.,1200441600,8,215,5.352941176470588
8234467,5,B000YYNQDA,"It's a cute little DVD. Simple and to the point. The focus is on learning the dance itself instead of it being a workout or choreography. Most of these dance instruction videos are made to workout, but she takes you through the basics of the dance. Its definitely a ""how to move"" your hips DVD. The only thing is that it's short (wish it was longer) but she has great hips! I hope that part 2 is longer. She demonstrates most of the movement from a back view and then there's a segment where there's a mirror image to help you see both angles at the same time.",1195776000,13,560,4.194444444444445
