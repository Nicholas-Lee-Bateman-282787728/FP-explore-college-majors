8529717,5,B008QP3NJ6,Delightful Movie based on a true story.,1441756800,,39,4.714285714285714
8529718,2,B008QP3NJ6,"I purchased this for a Christmas gift.  It won't play in our new Blu Ray player, yet others I purchased at the same time do.  There is nothing in this listing or on the case cover that says anything about this disc not being compatible with USA Blu Ray players.  Or, maybe there just isn't anything recorded on the disc I received.",1419638400,,331,4.306451612903226
8529719,4,B008QP3NJ6,"Good movie, nice scenery. Love Jeremy Renner. Tucson shots very pretty. Interesting story. Fun it was nice to see the final product.",1396051200,,132,5.045454545454546
8529720,3,B008QP3NJ6,"ingenious was meh... For the price though, and since purchasing was the only option, it was fair enough. Not a bad movie, but not a great one either, fortunately, the cost to purchase was the cost of a normal rental.",1393545600,,216,4.425
8529721,5,B008QP3NJ6,"Lots of been-there-done-that doing something stupid again and again.  But the idea that maybe you can get out of this mess is appealing.  How these reckless dudes effortlessly get super hot GF's is a bit thin, although maybe not.  Bottom line: it works and is worth the money.",1390348800,,276,4.708333333333333
8529722,5,B008QP3NJ6,Mr. Renner  delivers  an  outstanding  performance  as Sam.  His loyalty  to  his  friend  surpasses  his unconventional methods to  generate monetary support!,1385596800,,159,6.0476190476190474
8529723,5,B008QP3NJ6,"Decided to take a gamble on this one, worth it just to see jeremy renner in a comic role. Would definitely watch again.",1383696000,,119,4.217391304347826
8529724,5,B008QP3NJ6,"Based on a true story, it was good to see Jeremy Renner in a lighter role.  He actually does have pretty good advise on women as Sam.  Also, it was zoned ""0"", so I took a chance and ordered for US even though the site suggested it wouldn't play here.  Played fine!",1370822400,2,264,4.038461538461538
