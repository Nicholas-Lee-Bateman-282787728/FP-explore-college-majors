He picks up a bundle of dynamite. ""Matt the Mute"" offers help to Sally. ""We'll make her talk."" Randy finds the money and the note from ""Matt the Mute"". ""Come and get me!"" The Sheriff and his men pursue him. He leads them to the outlaw's gang hidden headquarters. The Sheriff's men shoot at the gang of crooks. The leader takes off on a horse. Sally is rescued by the Sheriff's men. There is a long chase to catch the gang's leader, Marvin Black. Randy shows his credentials and the rescued money.
