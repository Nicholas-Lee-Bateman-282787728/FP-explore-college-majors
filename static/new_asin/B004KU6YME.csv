8433428,5,B004KU6YME,"I picked this up at a Goodwill store in Virginia Beach. It's a very cute and charming documentary following different stories of dogs and their owners, demonstrating dog behavior and how they grow with their humans. The comedic narrative stringing these real stories together is fun to watch, and it all comes across well edited and serves as both entertainment and an informative, kind documentary. My daughter loves watching the dogs.",1453680000,,436,5.154929577464789
8433429,2,B004KU6YME,"I think this was supposed to be a comedic documentary about ""unusual"" canine hotels, but what I observed was more love of self than love of dogs.  It seemed to me it was about two narcissistic men fighting for air time with dogs dressed up in silly costumes occasionally mentioned.  Maybe it got better after the first half hour but that was as far as I got.",1447113600,,358,4.3283582089552235

8433432,4,B004KU6YME,"This video give two aspects of a dog's life.  One of being a pet and doing fun things and the other being used for rescue and guiding the blind.

A bit silly in that the two men that decide to make a movie about dogs work in a dog hotel and have to wear costumes making them look like dogs.",1394236800,,290,3.816666666666667
