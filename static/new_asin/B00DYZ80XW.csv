5879731,1,B00DYZ80XW,I love the video and the workout (for one of the DVD's) - but the second one of the DVD's arrived broken and I was not able to return it to this seller because i did not get to that video for over a month.,1424217600,,205,3.577777777777778
5879732,1,B00DYZ80XW,"One of the sessions is done in complete silence which makes it extremely difficult to practice to. Obviously one would not take a yoga class where the teacher didn't say a word but only breathed loudly. Not worth the money, and I usually love Seane Corn.",1413849600,9,254,4.543478260869565
5879733,5,B00DYZ80XW,"This is an excellent set for beginners.  When I first started yoga, this is where I began.  It's so helpful to have a teacher who is as precise as Seane is in her description of the poses.  Many yoga teachers who teach beginning yoga are not very descriptive and precise in regards to alignment which can lead to injury/repetitive use injury.  These videos helped me to build a strong foundation plus I like Seane's teaching style.  If you're a beginner these are definitely among the top videos to use to start your yoga journey!",1410220800,7,530,4.595744680851064
5879734,1,B00DYZ80XW,"First of all, the description of this item is wrong.  There are only 3 workouts in this entire set. It is the Uniting (70 minutes), Short form (40 minutes) and Breathe Flow (70 minutes).  These workouts are only appropriate for beginners.  For those of us that do yoga on a consistent basis, this is way too easy.  She tends to modify pretty much every position and tells you not to do the full Vinyasa even though that's what really gives you a good workout.  The flow is extremely slow and she breaks down poses that do not need to be broken down.  There are much better yoga workouts that take less time, are more effective and more fun.  Check out MTV yoga and Crunch Body Sculpt Yoga.  Those are my favorites and skip this one.",1401321600,5,732,4.37037037037037
5879735,5,B00DYZ80XW,Seane Corn is amazing. Love her or hate her she's doing what she believes & making a difference. If only there were a billion Seane's,1400284800,,133,4.36
5879736,5,B00DYZ80XW,"I love Sean Corn. If you want a nice vinyasa flow practice, this is for you!
She gives excellent instructions.",1391385600,2,110,4.55
8599313,5,B00DYZ80XW,"Seane Corn is AMAZING!! I was told that yoga helps with Trama Bonding issues, and I can honestly tell you I was using a different yoga video before, and I have been using Seane's for 4 weeks and know I can actually see a significant difference. I think it because she is very clear and concise out the poses so it helps me be more confident. So hope this helps someone out there as much as me! Seane Corn is amazing!",1499731200,,416,4.148148148148148
8599314,5,B00DYZ80XW,"So happy with this set. Great Vinyasa flow routines, and Seanes instruction is perfect. Helpful guidance without being institutional. Feels like you are getting personal attention.",1492473600,2,180,5.961538461538462
8599315,5,B00DYZ80XW,Great video. Challenging but not too difficult.,1478304000,,47,5.857142857142857
8599316,5,B00DYZ80XW,Very good I love the 30 min work out,1458086400,,36,3.111111111111111
8599317,4,B00DYZ80XW,This is a great series for a beginner or someone who is mid-level.,1457308800,,66,4.153846153846154
8599318,5,B00DYZ80XW,Seane Corn is so gifted and it truly shows on these DVDs.  Whether you're a beginner or an intermediate you will learn new things each time you practice with these DVDs. A must have for your yoga library.,1444780800,,204,4.368421052631579
8599319,5,B00DYZ80XW,Wonderful.,1437264000,,10,10.0
8599320,5,B00DYZ80XW,"I feel that many of the reviewers misunderstand the purpose of this set.

It is a SET with 2 sessions on 2 DVDs. Session 1 (disc 1) is instructional in nature and not only goes through the various poses of Vinyasa, but Seane also does a wonderful job of pointing out how to correctly do each pose and what to watch out for. Once you have adequately mastered this session, you ""graduate"" to Session 2 (disc 2).

Session 2 has a 40 minute flow sequence where Seane AGAIN describes each pose and instructs the viewer on correct alignment, etc. Once this has been ""mastered"" as well, only then should you move on to the 70 minute flow sequence that is only guided by her breathing and soft music. By this time, you should be familiar enough with Seane's Vinyasa flow sequence that you no longer need verbal cues. If you do, go back to the 40 minute flow.

The production value is great, without any distracting beach in the background or motivational group session. Seane wears a plain black outfit that easily shows proper alignment on her body. Plus the camera angles show her during the various poses both from the front and the sides.

This is by far the best yoga dvd set I've watched, and it is an excellent choice if you want to learn and are serious about your yoga practice. It is not gimmicky, and no celebrity trainer will be yelling at you throughout the videos.

I consider myself at an intermediate level, but it is great for beginners, too.

I'm very glad I bought this set (although not on Amazon) and feel strongly enough about it to have posted this review.",1436832000,10,1571,4.475524475524476
8599321,3,B00DYZ80XW,"Let me preface by saying that I usually love Seane Corn, and that the 70 minute practice on the Session 1 DVD is probably worth the price of this collection.  That said, disc two really only has one usable practice, which is a nice 40 minute flow.  The second practice, the 70 minute Breath Flow, is lovely to watch, but not something you can follow along to, as there is no verbal cuing.  I tend to use my yoga DVD's more like audio instruction, and very rarely look at the screen unless the verbal cuing is confusing.  But she literally does not say a single word during the entire 70 minute session, making it impossible to enjoy the practice because you have to watch it the entire time to see what is coming next.  It feels more like a performance that you are meant to sit and watch than an instructional practice you participate in.
The two other practices are good, and worth the $14.99, but I was surprised and disappointed by the third, which is why I'm only giving it 3 stars.",1430524800,7,987,4.371584699453552
8599322,5,B00DYZ80XW,Sean Corn is one of my favorite yoga teachers.  She has such a beautiful spiritual view of life.,1427932800,,96,4.333333333333333
