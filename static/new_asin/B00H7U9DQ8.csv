8630655,5,B00H7U9DQ8,"If you climb or aspire to climb this is one of the best indoor workouts. The approach of on the bike video combined with on-screen gearing and cadence help immensely to beat the boredom factor by bringing realism to indoor training. If the road goes up, so does your effort. If it descends, you recover. Of course, in this video there's not much recovery! If a rider can complete this video, they've done something worth celebrating. You'll know that you have the fitness to tackle big climbs.",1417046400,2,493,4.67816091954023

I wanted to wait until I worked out a couple of times, to the Cycling Videos Online  Mt. Evans  Workout video, before posting my thoughts on it.  Now that I have virtually cycled up Mt. Evans twice, I have to say by using the heads up display information on the TV screen as my guide; it was so realistic that I was thinking I was riding up that massive mountain again.  I rode up Mt. Evans in person (not virtually) in the summer of 2013 and this workout was just as I remember it, unrelenting and satisfying at the same time.  This video is just so realistic and the HD quality is amazing.  The video even has breaks built in and I remember taking plenty of them.  During and at the end of the climb my legs felt just as worn out and exhausted as doing it in person.  One advantage of the video though, is that if you just can not go any farther up the mountain, you can stop and be at home already, them go a little farther the next time you train to the video.

I would highly recommend this Cycling Videos Online video and any of the many others they have to offer.  I own many of their videos, so I can cycle in various locations around the country all winter or if I just need to get in a quality workout at home.  Thanks Paul for another high bar setting workout video.  What is next?

Paul, after being hooked on this Mt. Evans video I hope that, a strong wind is always in your face and the road only goes up, really up!

The instructional narrative is great and has a lot of very helpful information to improve cycling skills.  The portion with the guest female pro cyclist will be especially interesting to women with good tips covering all areas of the sport.  Be prepared to work hard - especially on the second disc, which will keep you pretty much in the red zone for two hours.  Great workout with tons of information that you can take out on the road when you can cycle outside again.",1391472000,4,955,7.136752136752137
