8305840,1,B001GLLMYU,"designs were ok but not great, I actually started to fall asleep after the 3rd episode cause the designers were very dull and seemed not very interested. Maybe it would have been better if they were more hands on and had some music like in other design shows such as color splash, devine design, income property, or design star, very disappointing.",1411516800,,348,4.721311475409836

8305842,4,B001GLLMYU,"Lots of good tips/tricks, even though the decor is a bit out of date now. Dealing with small living spaces is a timeless task and this is useful stuff.",1392940800,2,151,4.241379310344827
8305843,4,B001GLLMYU,I LIKE IT I BOUGHT IT FOR IDEAS BECAUSE I LIVE IN A SMALL SPACE AND I LIKE SPACE SAVING IDEAS,1374278400,,93,3.4761904761904763
8305844,5,B001GLLMYU,"When this show was airing on HGTV, it was my absolute favorite! Every episode featured several homes or apartments (each decorated by different designers) where various small space problems were solved. From using multipurpose furniture for tiny spaces to carving out separate dining, sleeping and living room areas in one-room apartments, this show always left my head spinning with great ideas. Of course, this isn't a current show on HGTV. (A look at host, Susan Crenshaw's clothes on the first episode gives you an idea. ;)) But the lessons on how to make the best use of limited space are still (with VERY few exceptions) current. And many of the rooms are traditional and mid-century modern designs--classics that transcend time. Now, if you're dedicated to keeping up with all the latest trends in home decorating, then this might not be your dvd. But if you're looking for great ideas on how to live in your small space and don't mind traditional/retro style, then this could be the show for you.",1310256000,7,1004,4.911764705882353
8305845,2,B001GLLMYU,I was hoping this would had been similar to what you see on HGTV but it wasn't. It's very old and it wasn't quite as hands on. There was more talking about why they used a specific design that was already done instead of showing you the process and talking about it. It just wasn't my style and I didn't make it through 1 episode. It was boring and nothing about the hosts held my attention.,1307318400,4,391,4.157894736842105
