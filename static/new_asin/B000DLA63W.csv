8307564,1,B000DLA63W,"This DVD is not very good at all, there are very few moves shown. Nothing is mentioned about the basic grip on the sword so beginners can see how to hold it properly. None of the stances or sword cutting moves are properly explained. The advanced technique shown involves rolling over on the floor still holding the sword which to me is asking for an accident to happen. A large portion of the dvd is showing basic techniques useing a jo staff which look good, and I must say was properly shown and explained slowly. This part of the dvd was very good, but I did not learn much from this dvd with regards to swordsmanship at all. would not recommend it for swordsmanship. But for basic Jo techniques it was good.",1161475200,,712,4.401515151515151
