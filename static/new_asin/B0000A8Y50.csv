8592874,5,B0000A8Y50,"This DVD content ranges from junior to professional levels in
harnessing the power of mental ray.
With this fast-paced video I was able to use the mental ray renderer more efficiently in Maya.
The crew at Mesmer's unique teaching style when disscussing mental
ray concepts are easily applied to the mental ray renderer using
other 3d packages like Softimage's XSI. All in all, a definite
must-have for taming mental ray in Maya.",1057881600,2,428,4.958333333333333
8592875,4,B0000A8Y50,"Oh boy. This DVD pushes the envelope for instructional videos. There must be 3 hours of click-by-click tutorial in there, and these guys really know their stuff! The material is *dense*.  Believe me, you won't be watching this all in one sitting! My computer doesn't have a DVD player, but I was able to contact Mesmer support through the email address on the insert and they gave me a URL to conveniently download the scene files etc. I highly recommend this since it is my opinion that the best way to use this DVD is to follow along, pausing and replaying sections so you don't fall behind and get lost.",1057104000,4,606,4.509090909090909
