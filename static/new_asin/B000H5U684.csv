2627791,5,B000H5U684,"This film reminds me of the old days about 10 years ago. You can feel the hard time of Panna Rittikrai, Tony Jaa, and their crews back then when they create a film by very low budget. Anyway, this style of film is rather typical for Thai movies in the old days. But you could see that Tony's talent is excellent right from the start!",1158537600,3,333,4.138461538461539
2627792,1,B000H5U684,"I LOVED Ong Bak and was more than exiceted to see that there was another film with Tony Jaa!!! Because he is an insane martial artist. His fighting sequences in Ong Bak are some of the best I have seen. Truely an amazing man.

BUT onto THIS film....

-Do NOT believe the back of this movie cover! Tony Jaa doesn't lead a group of people to defend a village... it's an misleading and verges on false advertising. He is a side character in a group NOT a main character. The pictures on this cover are mostly from Ong Bak and not this film.
-This is NOT a Kung Fu film it's a VERY weak ""Horror"" film, I say horror in quotes because I don't think it can even qualify as that. It basically looks like a bad kung fu film with a really cheesy ""horror"" plot... since I can't explain too much otherwise it will be concidered a ""spoiler""... just take my word that it is bad.
-The dubbing in english is HORRIBLE... which is to be expected with older, low-budget films BUT the Thai is almost as bad!
-Subtitles are wrong and have some errors
-""Sound effects"" sound like they were made in a house with a 5 dollar microphone
-Action sequences are mediocre at best. Tony Jaa has a couple cool moves but other than that nothing.
-Acting is sad... really sad.
-The filming has blue and red tints to it. It is also, at points, over and under exposed.
-Tony Jaa fights in the film for about 5-7 mintues at MAX.
-Tony Jaa is gone from the film at about 35 mintues into it.
-Watch for the tin foil wrapped nunchucks. They were very entertaining.

Summary:
Basically the $10.00 that this film cost should be paid to the viewer, not to the production. If you want to see a Tony Jaa film just re-watch Ong Bak or wait for Tom Yum Goong (The Protector). Don't waste the 84 minutes of your life watching this. It is the worst martial arts film I have ever seen.",1158537600,,1835,4.267241379310345
2627809,4,B000H5U684,"This movie gets a bad wrap because of the Lack of Tony Jaa. He's in it for like 30 seconds and he's all over the cover of the DVD. Then again if you didn't notice everything from the DVD cover with Tony is from other movies. That being said, Spirited Killer is a really good movie. If you like kung fu movies you will most likely enjoy this. It has a 70s/80s style kung fu movie to it but with a totally original story to it.
Plus the features on the DVD are great, shows a lot of clips from other Thai action movies that look totally fun an awesome.",1197763200,,550,4.009090909090909
2627810,2,B000H5U684,I thought the movie was gonna be way better than it was. A little disappointing and the fighting and action wasn't that great either. I wouldn't recommend it.,1197676800,2,158,4.678571428571429
2627811,1,B000H5U684,"Anyone who's looking for a Tony Jaa action flick will terribly disappointed by this movie. It's totally misleading the way it's advertised featuring Tony. Tony has a very MINOR role in this film. As for it being a schlocky ""B"" film, it's ok. Some of the action was decent at best however that's as good as it gets. The story was boring and the acting was even worse. Production value was barely there. I wouldn't recommend this film at all unless you're absolutely bored with time to waste.",1197244800,,490,4.579545454545454
2627812,1,B000H5U684,"I have read reviews on this movie and I realized Tony Jaa might not have a big part in this movie, but i at least thought it would be a good one! The film quality is horrific, the colors are often different from cut to cut. I thought that at least it would be a good action film with the crew of Ong-Bak, but no...definitely not. The voice overs almost made me laugh in disgust...and the acting oh my god the acting was terrible. When Tony Jaa did his 10 minutes of action i was pleased. He did well but he wasn't tied into the movie that well. If your looking for a nice action movie with some great moves, this ain't it. Really don't waste your time and money. Listen to everyone...just listen.",1193356800,,696,4.201492537313433
2627813,1,B000H5U684,"This is not a real movie.  This is what happens when you give a bunch of high school kids a film camera, send them out into the woods, and tell them to make a movie.  This is the most amateurish piece of crap I have ever seen released on a DVD.  My God do I wish I had read the user reviews on this movie before buying it.  Anyone who gives this more than 1 star must have been watching a different movie.

Okay, we have no acting.  Not bad acting, but no acting.  The characters could have just been making up the dialogue as they went along and it would have made zero difference.  There are no sets, just them running around in the woods beating each other up.  And here is the big one, there are NO EXCITING FIGHT SCENES.  I mean the people in the movie just kind of swing their arms and kick randomely.  There is no fight choreography and there are no stunts.  Me and my brothers could have made this movie.  The plot?  Who cares?  It doesn't make any sense anyway.

Even the film quality is bad!  About a dozen times throughout the movie, the color would change.  It was as if they had two cameras that recorded with two different kinds of film.  I mean it's just god-awful.

And it's a two disc special edition!  What in the world could they possibly have needed two discs for?  If you value your sanity, stay away from this steaming pile of crap.",1192320000,2,1354,4.186770428015564
2627814,3,B000H5U684,"I have a feeling that this became available after the success of Tony Jaa's other movies, it's an early work and some other guy is actually the star. It reminds me of other early asian martial arts movies.",1191456000,,205,4.421052631578948
2627815,1,B000H5U684,"If you're Tony's fan, DON'T BUY THIS CHEATING DVD. I'm from Thailand and I'm so disappointed in this stupid DVD. I bought it from WalMart 'cause I thought that it was a new Tony's movie. It turns out a real old movie that shot by Tony's producer long long time ago with a stupid location and cheap actor and actress.",1190505600,3,316,4.283333333333333
2627816,3,B000H5U684,"I love all genre of martial arts, after seeing Tony in the Protector 1 and 2, saw this, but it is a remake of way earlier career. Thought it was slow, and not up to todays remake standards.",1181260800,,189,4.0
2627817,3,B000H5U684,"Actually Tony Jaa is in this movie... But he is not one of the main actors.  He has a cameo appearance.  He appears with a group of ppl who are looking for a villiage relic.  He has on a black jump suit with zebra like designs in the shoulder area of his jacket.  His fight scenes with his mentor are pretty solid.  A lot of viewers see this movie as a disaster, but I have decided to give 3 stars for the effort since they did not use any cheesy wires or cgi which makes the film look more authentic to a real fight.  The problem with most viewers, is the assumption of fights being beautiful and precise... but that is what happens to ppl's mind when they are use to glam down hollywood action... lol!  Despite the deception of saling Tony Jaa as the main character, this is a pretty descent movie considering when it was made and it being a low budget film...",1178755200,,862,4.1878787878787875
2627818,3,B000H5U684,"This movie, though good in the classic Kung Fu movie set, is no Ong Bak. It features the amazing athelete that is Jaa's mentor , but very little Jaa. This wouldnt be a huge deal but the cover art prominently featuring Jaa is mighty misleading. Neither of the shots ever happens in the movie. If you are a Kung Fu fan and a Jaa freak this is for you, otherwise go watch Ong Bak or Tom Yum Goong.",1176163200,,394,4.064102564102564
2627819,2,B000H5U684,"This movie was pretty terrible.  I never did see Tony Jaa, and he was the reason I bought it.  I noticed later that the picture on the back of the DVD case was taken straight from The DVD case of ""Ong Bak"".  The camera quality was terrible, as was the editing and overall acting.  There were times when the camera shot would turn a shade of blue, then red, then regular.  I can say, however, that my friends and I shared a good laugh over how terrible this movie is.",1169942400,2,466,4.133333333333334

2627821,4,B000H5U684,Tony Jaa is in about only 10 minutes of the film but it is 10 minutes worth watching; he was amazing even at 17/18.  The story line is interesting and I enjoyed watching the entire film.  Jaa picked a great mentor and with this film you can tell why.  The picture quality is not always the best but you can get past it.  Remember this film was made about 12 to 13 years ago and the Thai film industry was just beginning to figure things out. After watching Ong-Bak and Tom Yum Goong you can see just how far they have come and how they are beginning to rival Hong Kong.  I don't think Tony Jaa needs Hollywood.  Looking forward to more of Panna and Jaa's early work being released to the U.S.,1168473600,5,692,4.165413533834586

2627825,1,B000H5U684,"Worse than Postman stikes back. Horrible movie. I purchased it becuase Im a huge fan of Tony Jaa. Though he is on the cover his part is small, and pointless. He has nothing to do with the story, shows up to fight the main character only to be killed by him. His part is less than 5 min. The rest of the movie is garbage. if you're looking for stunts, or anything like UNG BAK, this is not it. Not even the fight scenes are worth watching.",1167436800,5,438,4.045977011494253

It tended to drag, and the fight scenes weren't even good enough to say that Tony Jaa was a part of them. Overall, I'd say skip this movie and watch ong-Bak 2 to truly enjoy Jaa's skills.",1292371200,,321,4.193548387096774
8136673,1,B000H5U684,"Just like everyone else, I expected Tony Jaa to be the highlight of this film. He is not! He has a short cameo performing awesome stunts, but it only lasts about 4-5 minutes. These companies know how to make a quick buck on an actor that may be in a prestigous class now, but back then they were working to make a name for themselves. Don't buy it not only because Jaa is barely in it, but because it absolutely stinks up the room! Horrible to the third power folks!!!",1249430400,,468,4.211111111111111

This movie fails in every possible way.  Poor story, lousy acting, lousy filmography...oh and I couldn't find Tony Jaa anywhere in this movie.  The fight scenes were flat and had no style...they looked like bar brawls than martial arts.

This is a Panna Rikkikrai movie, he's one of the main characters.  Don't be fooled by the cover, you won't find Tony or his style here.  I wouldn't even rent this, it's that bad.",1237852800,,593,4.327272727272727

This movie is bad. Not like ""this is bad for a professional movie"" or ""this is bad for an indie"" or ""this is bad for a fan film on YouTube"" or ""this is bad for cable access television"" or ""this is bad for a Mystery Science Theater movie"". This movie is closer to ""this is bad for a high school English project"". It would never have been released had Tony Jaa not later become famous. But i bet he doesn't tell any of his friends that he was ever in this (despite what other reviews say, Tony Jaa was in the movie and was a major character; you just wouldn't recognize him)

i was appalled the first time i saw it but to be mean i made my friends sit through a few minutes of it and eventually it grew on me. This film is awful but once you accept that, it's actually kind of funny how bad it is",1217289600,,976,4.078125
