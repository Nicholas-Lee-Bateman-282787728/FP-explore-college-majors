5134555,4,B0085Z3AMM,"A great film that's bloody, over the top, full of punchy dialogue, unexpected twists/turns, and a great model for low budget filmmaking.  Why?  Ignore having stars like Gina Gershon (in usual top form), Kelli Giddish (L&O: SVU star), Val Kilmer and Ray Liotta, they made this in a single setting and its immediate surroundings.  The low budget indie sci-fi classic ""Primer"" is another example where you can learn from those who've successfully made a film set in a limited number of physical locations to keep costs down.

In this case a house trailer in the middle of nowhere and a few cars are all it takes to tell the tale of a women (Gershon) and her best friend (Giddish) trying to figure out whether husband Val Kilmer indeed committed a bank robbery (netting $100,000), if so where he hid the money and avoiding the threat of the local sheriff awaiting a search warrant outside (Liotta).

If you have allergies/asthma or just quit smoking you might want to rethink watching this as the two ladies smoke nearly non-stop the entire film.  Sort of a 40s/50s vibe though it's not set in that time period.  And if you're squeamish note there's a lot of blood in this one as the insanity increases as the women start to tear the small trailer apart searching for money.  Give it a try and just enjoy the nutty, bloody fun and games.",1355011200,4,1333,4.61864406779661
5134556,4,B0085Z3AMM,"A little gross but in a comical way.  Not for kids!  Really unexpectedly enjoyed this fast-paced and unusual movie.  Ray Liotta is the reason I purchased it.  As usual, he is sexy and in this movie plays a ""cool laid-back cat"".  I just wish Liotta had a bigger part in the movie because I can't get enough of him! Ha!",1351728000,,317,4.216666666666667
5134557,5,B0085Z3AMM,"This movie had a little of everything.  Comedy, suspense, thriller, and even a little romance. Very entertaining. Kellie Giddish was great in her movie debut.  I would recommend watching the movie.",1347926400,2,197,5.32258064516129
5134558,1,B0085Z3AMM,"It Was very lame. Maybe if you and some Girls from work got together and had a little to much to drink this movie may get 2 stars. It is a chickflick,not a good chick flick but thats what best describes it.",1346889600,,206,3.9285714285714284
5134559,3,B0085Z3AMM,"This film works like a play.
Really no scenes as much as all the dialogue taking place in a trailer.

It felt like a character study exercise for actors more than an actual film.
With the main characters doing a great job with their acting and continuous dialogue.

The opening sequence was a full rip-off of the opening credits for the TV show DEXTER.

Bottom line -- impressive acting talents and character portrayals , but not really an enjoyable or interesting movie.

P.S.
What happened to Val Kilmer ?
Years ago he was poised to be the next big thing, then he suddenly kind of just faded away.

I think I will go look that up now that I am curious.",1346457600,3,654,4.371900826446281
5134560,5,B0085Z3AMM,"Excellent movie; it's funny and entertaining-  Val Kilmer and Ray Liotta are good in the film and are a couple of names to draw people in (though Kilmer is in it very little- even though the plot revolves around him figuratively and literally).  But the stars of the movie are definitely Kelli Giddish and Gina Gershon, the actresses played well off each other and they reminded me of ""I Love Lucy"" episodes with their back and forth bickering and scheming about the mess they are in.

I would recommend this movie for purchase; it's a movie that even though you know what's going to happen after watching it once, it's still entertaining to watch.",1346284800,7,648,4.666666666666667
5134561,5,B0085Z3AMM,"Gina Gershon(Lorna) and Kelli Giddish(Tiny) have great chemistry as their characters' predicament goes from bad to bloody. The whole movie takes place in a trailer out in the middle of NoWhere, Texas . The plot contains some surprises and some not-so-surprising twists and turns.  The dialogue is funny as the girls try to deal with their seemingly hopeless situation.  It's a fun movie to watch but not for the squeamish.",1346112000,,422,5.014285714285714
5134562,4,B0085Z3AMM,"I enjoyed the opening credits with bright use of the color red and showing the painted hands of a women preparing dinner. Gina Gershon stars as Lorna in this dark comedy that takes place in Texas in 1981. Dale (Val Kilmer) her husband of 17 years, is laid out on the floor as Gina's girlfriend Tiny (Kelli Giddish looking like a young Jane Curtin) walks in.

As things go on Val Kilmer, who is now tied up in a chair and has confessed to a bank robbery, is accidentally killed. The women suppose the money is hidden somewhere in the trailer. They decide to look for the loot and dispose of the body using household appliances. As the story goes on, the plot takes a number of twists, so much so that the final twist becomes easy to figure out.

This is a Coen style comedy, but falls short of the masters. I enjoyed this quirky film in spite of some of the predictability. Several laugh out loud moments as Gina creates a memorable character.

PARENTAL GUIDE: No F-bombs, sex, or nudity.",1345248000,5,987,4.412087912087912
5134563,2,B0085Z3AMM,"Val Kilmer's most memorable films of the past few years have been ""Kiss Kiss Bang Bang"" and ""The Bad Lieutenant: Port of Call - New Orleans"" and those two titles pretty much fell under just about everyone's radar. Everything in between has been direct to video or is having trouble finding distribution. This man was Iceman, Jim Morrison, Doc Holliday, and even Batman. He was in ""Heat;"" one of the greatest crime films of our time. Now he's just in a race with Ray Liotta to see who can get the oldest and the fattest the fastest. It's like the tagline to ""Alien Vs Predator;"" whoever wins...we lose.

Lorna (Gina Gerson) and Tiny (Kelli Giddish) are the main attraction in ""Breathless;"" Lorna being the brains of the operation despite never graduating high school and Tiny mostly just being a pretty face. They live in Clark County, a small town in Texas. Lorna's husband, Dale (Val Kilmer), recently robbed a bank and stole $100,000 but planned on skipping town without mentioning the robbery to anyone; not even his loving wife. So finding the money is step one. Step two is avoiding Sheriff Cooley (Ray Liotta) long enough to make a clean getaway. Unfortunately for Lorna and Tiny, neither one of them is very good at much of anything other than smoking and gossiping up a storm.

The majority of the movie takes place in the mobile home that belongs to Lorna and Dale, so the constraints of a low budget are apparent right from the start. It really isn't so bad though as ""Breathless"" just makes do with what it can. Gina Gershon recently co-starred in ""Killer Joe,"" which is so fantastic, isn't afraid to push boundaries, and is so insanely memorable. The downside is that viewing ""Breathless"" after ""Killer Joe"" feels like a step backwards. It seems so watered down in comparison, the writing doesn't pull you in like it did in ""Killer Joe,"" and the characters are really flat and one-dimensional. They are obviously two very different movies with few similarities, but you can't help but make a few observations.

""Breathless"" seems to be built around bickering. Gossip and talking about everything to the point of beating a dead horse feels like the movie's prime objective. Things spin more and more out of control as Tiny loses her cool and Lorna yells at her to be quiet so she can think of a way out of the mess they find themselves in. Their outlandish arguments that get out of hand were probably meant to be amusing in some capacity, but will mostly receive no reaction as you've probably witnessed worse and more humorous altercations in public at your local grocery store.

You can also see the ending coming a mile away. Setups go on way too long and characters actions are noticeably too final and precise for you to not see the outcome long before it's revealed. $100,000 really doesn't seem like much for a movie like this either, especially with today's economy. It'd be enough to get you settled in some place new, it might get you a house and a new car, but then you'd essentially be broke right after you got there and then what? These characters would be stuck in the same boat because they certainly don't seem like the type who'd be careful with their money.

""Breathless"" is watchable, but isn't memorable or overly entertaining. It gives you false hope somewhere in the middle and seems to hint at jumping into horror territory (like the fake trailer Eli Roth did for ""Grindhouse"" called ""Thanksgiving,""), but it goes in a more predictable direction. That's essentially the main problem with ""Breathless;"" it's too predictable. Characters don't have much depth to them, the screenplay is uninspired, and nothing ever really feels like a big pay off. Despite its fair share of blood, ""Breathless"" mostly plays it very safe and is very dull and lifeless because of it.

Special features include Audio Commentary with Writer/Director Jesse Baget and Producer Christine Holder and a fifteen minute Making of Breathless featurette.

""Breathless"" will be available as a single-disc DVD and a Two-Disc Blu-ray/DVD Combo Pack starting this Tuesday, August 14th. It is rated R for some bloody violence and is presented in widescreen with a 2.35:1 aspect ratio. The Blu-ray has Dolby TrueHD 5.1 sound and the DVD has Dolby Digital 5.1 sound. It also has English (for the hearing impaired) and Spanish subtitles. It is approximately 91 minutes in length.",1344902400,2,4375,4.817576564580559
5134564,3,B0085Z3AMM,"""We are in Texas there are no accidents. There's alive and there's dead."" Lorna (Gershon) is very upset with her husband Dale (Kilmer) after years of prison for robbing convenience stores he is free. She finds out that he has robbed a bank and she is upset because he isn't sharing with her. She calls her friend ""Tiny"" (Giddish) over to help her though her problem but things go from bad to worse. I have to say that for the most part this was a pretty entertaining movie and it made me laugh a few times but it is not anything really good. The humor is the ""redneck"" type of humor like the kind in ""Raising Arizona"" but it's not quite as funny. I've said for a while now that Val Kilmer has really gone downhill for some reason. While this is his best (and by that I mean only watchable) movie in a while his acting is terrible. Ray Liotta has been going down that road too but his acting is actually decent in this movie. This is nothing amazing but it is pretty funny in a very dark & I shouldn't be laughing at this kind of way. Overall, not a bad way to spend an hour and a half. I give it a B-.",1344729600,3,1101,4.078341013824885
8525788,5,B0085Z3AMM,"First off, do not expect an intellectual movie, you would be disappointed. If you are in it for a good time, laughs and quirky situations, and shenanigans, you will enjoy this hilarious, somewhat black comedy. My husband and I both had a relaxing good time with the twisted story of all too-human, albeit over-the-top funny entanglement of intrigues, fibs and human shortcomings in all departments.
I think I'll bring it out again for Halloween this year, as it is 100 times better than the chainsaw massacre movies, and just as gory, lol!

Sit back, relax and enjoy and laugh as if there was no tomorrow!",1527638400,,605,4.761904761904762
