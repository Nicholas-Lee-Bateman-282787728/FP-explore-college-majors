214398,5,6300181065,"I just love THE MIGHTY DUCKS flicks! I think they are some of the best flicks in the sports genre. This is the first in the saga. Emilio Estevez plays a hotshot, wise-cracking lawyer named Gordon Bombay. Bombay hates hockey and kids, even though he used to play hockey as a kid (that's one of the reasons why he hates both hockey and kids). When Bombay gets busted by the cops for drunk-driving, he has to be suspended from his career and do community service - particularly by coaching the ""District 5"" PeWee hockey team in Minnisota, where he lives.
Bombay first thinks the job of coaching the kids will be easy...since he thinks he knows all about hockey. But when he first meets the kids, he realizes that it's going to be a lot harder than he thought - the kids are wise-cracking, rough, street kids like him who are absolutely HORRIBLE at hockey! The kids all hate him; he hates them, too. And they can't win any games. But then, he learns how to be a good coach and the kids begin to like him. Of course, you'll probably guess who will win the big play off championships - their rivals happen to be the team that Bombay played on as a kid and their coach was Bombay's old coach.
Even though the plot is pretty predictable, it's still an awesome movie. And the plot is, in some way, different and unique than many others like it. The movie has a lot of hilarious parts in it. This is the kind of flick you can watch over and over again and never get bored of it. It's a great movie and another winner for Disney! Go buy it - the price is great!",989798400,6,1550,4.257627118644068
214399,4,6300181065,"I first saw this film when i was younger in the summer at an activity centre, and from that day i bugged my parents until they bought it for me.  I have owned it on video for several years and i constantly watched it, so when it came out on dvd i jumped at the oppurtunity to purchase it.  The story is about a lawer who is put in charge of a hockey team as his community service assigment.  Gordon hates kids and he hates hockey.  When Gordon was a child he used to play hockey so he is going to be a good coach if he could just get over the fact that he doesnt want to be there.  This film is a laugh a minute with childish humour that still makes me laugh now",985737600,,662,3.838235294117647
214400,2,6300181065,"Leave it to Disney to captilize on the name of one of their kid's flicks. Well, it was good for what it was. I wouldn't watch it again though, it wasn't as memorable as ""The Sandlot"" or ""Goonies"" but it'll do.",984182400,,209,4.121951219512195
214401,4,6300181065,"A very enjoyable and coming-of-age hockey story about persistance, drive and a will to win. It does involve a bunch of losers who turn into a bunch of winners, but it is done the right way: with entertaining flashbacks of past successes and failures, complemented by hard work and kids having fun where hockey is the topic of conversation, 24 hours a day. In my opinion, it is the roughest and most talent demanding sport in today's society, but also the least publicized and most enjoyable. A group of kids can do something right if they really want to and are willing to give it 110. Not only is this fun to watch, it sends a positive message out to all. Not to mention, a cameo from Mike Modano. A few years after this flick, an NHL expansion team joined the NHL the ""Mighty Ducks of Anaheim"". Coincidence, NO!",979689600,2,813,4.4630872483221475

214403,5,6300181065,"Emilio Estevez scores the winning goal as Gordon Bombay, a smug, smarmy  lawyer who is arrested for drunken driving and is ordered to do community  service as the coach of PeeWee hockey team ""District 5,"" a ragtag  group of kids with doubtful playing abilities.  He expects it to be hell,  but instead he faces his own demons and learns about the importance of  teamwork and what REALLY makes a winner.  Typical cliched Disney fare, with  Bombay redeeming himself in the end and we know even before watching it for  the first time which team wins the grand finale, but nonetheless a harmless  and inoffensive movie which children and parents will undoubtedly enjoy.",965865600,6,665,4.857142857142857

214405,5,6300181065,"This movie has every ingredient it takes to make it a winner.  Good story, fun characters, and a good plot.  Its clean like most Disney movies, but don't let that fool you, it's a movie both kids and adults will enjoy.  It  revolves around the theme that teamwork as the power or overcome all.  It  also teaches us that winning isn't everything.  Plus, it's a lighthearted  comedy with fun hockey sequences.
The DVD however is lacking.  Bad  pixelated video quality, and no features to speak of make the DVD sub-par.  However, overall this movie is a very good value and it is recommended.",958608000,7,589,4.621359223300971
214406,5,6300181065,Mighty ducks is a heart warming tale of a insecure yet smart lawyer (emilio estevez) who is ordered to coach an ice hockey team as community service for drink driving. The tale follows the trials and tribulations of  the of the team and the coach dealing with issues such as single parents  and self belief. It is a pleasant journey of self discovery which is both  light and uplifting. This film is ideal for the family or indeed for anyone  with no offensive scenes. Must see to appreciate.,951436800,7,492,4.556818181818182

rest of the cast is very good too. Highly enjoyable movie that has some really good laughs as well.

215078,5,6300181065,"1992 marked the year of an era. Attorney Gordon Bombay, portrayed by Emilio Estevez, is arrested for driving under the influence and sentenced to community service. He must then coach a Pee-Wee hockey team only called by the district they represent, District 5. Through an awesome story of character development and comedy throughout, Bombay soon discovers that there's so much more to life than just winning. From iconic creations of characters many generations continue to be tremendous fans of to a film that holds its own as not only a 90's gem, but a cult classic.....Disney transformed a bunch of losers into a team that soared right into inspiring the name of an NHL Pro Hockey team.......they're called ""THE MIGHTY DUCKS.""",1420675200,,730,5.041322314049586

No, I loved this movie because it was a guaranteed feel-good movie.  The plucky rag-tag team of miscreants playing ice hockey coached by a man forced to do it as pennance.  For anyone that's ever watched a Disney sports movie, what follows is no surprise.  There's the requisite musical montage.  There's the team losing, and then eventually coming together to win.  There's the setback just before the end.  And then there's their ultimate triumph.

I mean, really, what's not to love.  It's a simple enjoyable story, one that everyone can respond to.  Everyone sees themselves as the underdog in their own story, and everyone wants to eventually emerge victorious.  Maybe there are no big surprises in the movie but I'm cool with allowing Shamaylan to provide me shock and awe climaxes.  Disney movies are the cinematic version of a mug of hot cocoa on a snowy day - comfort food for the eyes and the mind.

This is certainly possible as Emilio Estevez leads a cast of promising young actors as they go from a last-place team of mis-fits with outdated (to say the least) equipment to contenders in the state championships.  Quick sidenote:  Is it just me or is that girl Conny actually trying to flirt with Gordan Bombay when she first skates over and introduces herself?  God, I hope not.  M. C. Gainey plays an underused character and proves this during the scene where the kids invade the car that he is driving (on the ice, but I digress) and he suggests killing one of them and later very physically demands the return of his candy or cookie (I can't remember which but watch the scene and find out...and find out how funny it is.)  There is certainly plenty of action as we are treated to multiple hockey games which are nicely crafted so that the shortned time they spend on the screen in comparison to the real game doesn't bother us.

We were watching our nephew and the Mighty Ducks came on, being a fan of it when we were kids, we watched it together.  He loved the movie and so on his birthday we got him this DVD.

Big mistake.  I have NEVER seen a DVD of such terrible quality.  On widescreen HDTV the aspect ratio is all off so that there is big black lines on not just the sides of the screen but also the top and bottom... the movie takes up barely half of the TV screen!  If that was the only issue we could have dealt with it, but the quality of the picture itself is just so horrible it's distracting.  It's discolored, it's grainy, it looks like it's being projected out terribly old poor quality film projector.

My nephew is only 6, so obviously he doesn't care much about video fidelity but it was so bad it even bothered him and he was asking what was wrong with the movie.  We transferred the DVD to a Standard definition tube tv and the poor quality was not as noticeable, but still really bad.

The quality was so terrible I was sure I had accidentally ordered a bootleg or something... but no, it's the authentic Disney DVD.  I can't believe the quality.

It's been called ""The Bad News Bears on skates,"" but The Mighty Ducks is a little too saccharine for the comparison. If you can get past that (and all the shameless tie-ins to the NHL franchise Disney once owned) there's some good hockey action and positive messages about sportsmanship, teamwork, believing in yourself and coming to grips with past mistakes.

When he gets court mandated community service to coach a pee-wee hockey team, (which seem to look more like a group of misfits then any sort of team) his hatred of children becomes a love, which leads him back to his greater love of the game itself.

215202,5,6300181065,"'The Mighty Ducks' released in '92 is probably the only film that can boast that its theatrical success launched a sports franchise. Fact or fiction, as a movie it found a large enough audience to convince Disney Studios to follow-up with two more installments of Mighty Duck Mania.

Plot: Self-absorbed young lawyer, Gordon Bombay (Emilio Estevez) is sentenced to community service for a traffic violation. His assignment is to fill in as the interim hockey coach for a local group of underachieving kids. Coach Bombay, a former hocky star in the same league years earlier, has inherited the worst team in the league. Can he harness their rebellious attitudes and turn them into contenders? Maybe even make them good enough to challenge the perennial champions and his old coach?

Formulamatic but lots of fun anyway. Estevez is surrounded by a strong cast with: Lane Smith as Coach Reilly, Heidi Kling as Casey Conway, Joshua Jackson as Charlie Conway and Marguette Moreau as Connie.",1152230400,,985,5.03680981595092
215203,4,6300181065,"Okay, so we all know the story about how the Ducks come from behind to win and how Coach Bombay gets revenge on his old coach for many years of bad memories.

Fair enough.

As corny and as thin as the plot can be at times, it's still a great story with good morals.  It's definitely no Hoosiers or Rudy by a longshot, but it's Disney at it's best.  It's a classic Disney sports movie as well as a great family film.

Now, the DVD.  Let's just say that I sure didn't buy this movie for the special features.  There's a menu screen with a chapter search and that's about it.

Ohh, one more thing.  Whenever they re-released the film for DVD, I guess they must have inserted Queen's ""We Are The Champions"" and ""We Will Rock You"" into portions of the film and at the end credits.  One thing in particular that kinda bugged me is that fact that the original score by David Newman is replaced by Queen's ""We Are The Champions"" right at the part where Charlie scores the winning penalty shot.  It's not that Queen's song wouldn't be fitting here.  I just felt that the original score added a lot of emotion within the film.  Not a huge deal.  I just didn't remember that the last time I saw the movie on VHS.

Ahh well.  I guess for $8 I really can't complain.",1122508800,,1253,4.223628691983122

215225,1,6300181065,"Buena Vista (the company that releases Disney films on DVD) chose to not release anamorphic DVDs when they first came to DVD, so none of these films are anamorphically enhanced. This means, if you have a widescreen television, you will have black bars on all four sides of the picture. Also, these discs are absolutely barebones, only featuring a Dolby 2.0 soundtrack and a 1.85:1 widescreen presentation. Where are the extras?!

There was four seconds left in OT and the with a faceoff deep in the North Stars end. The Whalers won the faceoff and scored with 1.1 seconds left.

215228,5,6300181065,"I somewhat doubt there will be a 4th Mighty Ducks movie. Think about it, there hasn't been a mighty ducks out since 1996. This was the first of three Mighty Ducks  movies to come out. Gordon Bombay was a pee-wee hockey player up until he qutis when he misses a pentiity shot. And about 20 to 25 years later he is a lawyer (who claims he never loses) but he doresn't count a case when he scored with a reporter. His rival is Frank Hundy (Steven Brill) and he decides in a case to pretend to have a meeting with his client when he just wants to keep them waiting. But then Gordon Bombay (Emilio Estevez) is arrested for drinking and dvring. Where in a case where he denfes fimself that the judge finds out that Gordon has trouble with the law. And his boss (Josef Soommer) decides to keep him on play roll but suspend his divers lience and orders Gordon to 500 hours of commuity servce coaching pee-wee hockey. He hates hockey and he doesn't like kids. His first game is against he old pee-wee team (the Hawks) coached by his old Hawks coach Jack Reilly (Lane Smith). If you like this how about you watch the 2nd Mighty Ducks movie.",1038873600,2,1130,4.305164319248826
215229,5,6300181065,"When he was young, Gordon Bombay (Emilio Estevez) used to play hockey but when he blows a really big game, he quits. Now thirty, he's a lawyer who doesn't know anything about fair play or teamwork. When he gets arrested for drunken driving, he has to perform community service. And not just any community service, he has to coach hockey to kids! His team consists of Charlie Conway (Joshua Jackson), Greg Goldberg (Shaun Weiss), Dave Averman (Matt Doherty), Peter (J.D. Daniels), Gee Germaine (Garette Ratliff Henson), Jesse Hall (Brandon Quintin Adams), Connie Moreau (Marguerite Moreau), Dave Karp (Aaron Schwartz), and Terry Hall (Jussie Smollett). And they are an AWFUL team! Bombay hates the kids and doesn't try hard to coach them, and so of course the kids don't respect or like him at all. Will they ever be able to work as a team with Coach Bombay acting like the good coach he should be? And will they have enough time to make it to the finals against unbeatable team, Hawks? Also starring is Hans (Joss Ackland), Mr. Ducksworth (Josef Sommer), Fulton Reed (Elden Henson), Tammy (Jane Plank), and Tommy (Danny Tamberelli), Coach Reilly (Lane Smith), and Adam Banks (Vincent Larusso).
Great movie entertainment! I just love the whole Mighty Ducks trilogy! They teach great values about trust, teamwork, fair play, and as Coach Bombay used to say, 'all that other junk'. It's also very, VERY hilarious! Some parts you can just die laughing, for example when the kids get in trouble from the principal and are put under detention. The hockey games are pretty suspenseful and fun, too!
But there is a reason for the PG rating for this movie. Mostly it's because of language which at times is pretty bad. Also the kids in the movie are pretty naughty at times. I think the movie is best aimed for kids maybe 10 and up, great for adults, too.
Then of course there are the other two ""Mighty Ducks"" films. ""D2: The Mighty Ducks"" have Bombay again coaching the Ducks, this time there are going up against the world as Team USA! Some of the hockey players aren't in this movie, but they get some new teammates. In my opinion (though it's a very hard choice), this movie is the best of all three. ""D3: The Mighty Ducks"" has the Ducks getting a scholarship for Eden Hall academy. Their main adversary are the Warriors, the varsity team of Eden Hall. If you liked the first ""Mighty Ducks"", I highly recommend the next two sequels! I sincerely hope that Disney will have the whole trilogy on DVD soon!",1014595200,19,2497,4.703196347031963

It's utterly brillant. I love the matches,the jokes even the hardwork. Even though I've watched it so many times I still jump up and down when the Ducks win! My fave player has 2 b Adam Banks. He is the cutest ever. I really want 2 meet the actor who played him(Vincent A. Laursso) and everyone who played in the video. I've got the mighty ducks 2 and i love that even more. I think that maybe that there should b more pictures of the actors on the web. I think other people will agree with me. QUACK!QUACK!QUACK!QUACK!GO DUCKS!",1009756800,,695,4.155555555555556
215231,5,6300181065,"I'm a little old for kiddie movies, yet this movie was sooooo cool.  I played different sports when I was younger, but this movie made me wish I played hockey!  It's a great kids film; no sex, no real violence (it's hockey...), hardly any swearing, BUT very funny.  I haven't been delighted like this since... Since...  The Bad News Bears!
The plot is pretty basic.  An ex-hockey player turned hot-shot lawyer is forced to coach a losing hockey team made up of misfits.  AFter some personality changes in the coach, he finds that hockey is still his thing and that he wishes to bring them to victory.
It's full of fun moments and you get to see a young Joshua Jackson before his Dawson Creek days or his appearance in Urban Legends!  And I hate to admit this, but Emilio Estevez does a decent job.  I think most of us are used to seeing Estevez as Billy the Kid in Young Guns and it's hard to imagine him in any other role.  Especially a parental role!
This movie is a stepping stone for the next two that appear (But not on DVD?!?!).  The next one is even more exciting (MIghty Ducks2-D2) with new players and a very cool storyline.  By the 3rd movie, it's hard to believe they are high school and not college and you also get to see them grow up a bit.
The Mighty Ducks trilogy is a great set of films and not quite as mindless as the rest of the Disney fare available.",996019200,2,1371,4.275193798449612
