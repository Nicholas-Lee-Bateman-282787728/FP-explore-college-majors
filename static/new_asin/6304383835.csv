852696,3,6304383835,"A Fun Light-Hearted Movie about a Woman in a Man's World.  That one sentence sums up the Associate, with Whoppi Goldberg playing a woman trying to break the glass ceiling in the world of high-finance.

Whoppi does a good job playing Laurel Ayers, a woman who has been passed over too many times.  When she sets out on her own, she can't get clients until she creates a partnership with a fictional male, Mr. Cutty.  While she experiences success, it is bittersweet because her fictional male partner is seen as the brains of the organization.  In the end, she goes to drastic measures to make the world see that she is the one who deserves the credit for her ideas.

This movie is a lot of fun to watch.  It's true, you can watch it many times over, especially if you love the world of finance and enjoyed movies like ""Trading Places.""

The movie also has a real message, which is the prejudice that prevents women from sometimes getting the credit they deserve.  It's been 10 years since this movie was made.  One would hope that the business world had changed since then, and it has in some ways.  But, some of the painful neglect she suffers in the movie still rings true.

While this is a good fun movie, it is not a masterpiece of film.  It's a fun movie to watch if you don't want to think too much and if you like cliche's about the ""old-boys club.""  Some of the plot gets just a little too silly towards the end, as her elaborate ruse unravels.  I think they could have given the audience a little more to chew on with a more believable portrayal.

Still, it's worth a watch.  Buy it, watch it, enjoy it!",1108166400,19,1612,4.355704697986577
852697,5,6304383835,"I first saw this movie when I rented it.  The following day, I had to get up early for something and I wasn't going to watch a movie, but I decided to anyway.  It is interesting to note that I have no idea how I found the movie, but when I started watching it, I couldn't stop.  Most people have a favorite movie that they could watch over and over and this happens to be mine.  The main topic of the movie can be described as business oriented and I like movies like that, so this helps.  Overall, an excellent movie and I recommend purchasing because I like to watch it over and over.",1104451200,4,586,4.105263157894737
852698,5,6304383835,"Whoopi Goldberg stars in THE ASSOCIATE, a humorous movie about the stock market and a woman finding her way. She plays Laurel Ayers, a stock broker who is promised a promotion. When her co worker takes her promotion right from under her, she is determined to make it on her own. She quits and starts her own company. To her dismay she finds out that it's not easy making it in the world as a woman, doors are constantly slammed in her face because of her gender, so she sets out to take the world over by storm, by creating a fictional person, Robert Cutty. Yes she creates a man and even dresses up as one. Cutty takes the world by storm, but Laurel has to keep up with her charade. Eventually she realizes that Cutty has been nothing but trouble for her, no one cares about what SHE has been doing, and a man is still getting all the credit for her ideas. So she sets out to kill a fictional man that doesn't exist! She realizes she is no better than she was, because Cutty is getting credit for all her work and ideas. ...Overall a really humorous and well acted film, worth seeing many times.",1045267200,11,1096,4.274038461538462

when Whoopi finally got a break-through and was given an account to prove her worth as a business woman! Women are still looked down in 2002 in many fields! The White Male is still given every thing over the Black woman and the white woman! Opray was the frist African American woman given close to a billion in revenue, we're cousins by the way Opray and I! No, really!!
viewing the movie helped me to make many successful deals without feeling like a helpless female!
Anyway Whoopi plays a guy as well as she does a girl! Five stars for you Whoopi!",1029369600,5,678,4.346456692913386

These are the kind of movies you've seen so many times that you can start watching at any point and want to stay to the end. For me, this is one of them, I've probably seen it a dozen times at least. It's just silly, unrealistic fun with some really great actors --- Whoopi, Eli Wallach, Dianne Wiest, Bebe Neuwirth, Lanie Kazan.

853231,5,6304383835,"Whoopi Goldberg & Dianne Wiest are powerful and funny in this film that explores gender roles, sexism and to a lesser degree racism.

Whoopi is a talented, top employee at an investment firm, with a young male co-worker that she trained. When she is passed over and the young male is given ""her"" promotion, she quits to start her own firm.

Things don't go so well and she takes on a drastic makeover to break into the male dominated world of high finance.

I like that this movie includes a LOT of classic stereotypes....sensitivity to weeping women, stip club deal closings, general denegrating verbal utterings about pms, disparaging secretarial/personal assistant labor.... it demonstrates how ingrained these things are in the actions and language of our culture and challenges the ""why "".

Don't worry, the movie doesn't take itself too seriously, there are lots of laughs to be had.

I love Whoopi for her commanding presence, grace and strength. I LOVE Dianne's character because it shows that a woman can be nurturing, bubbly, sweet and ALSO brilliant, effective and successful.",1451260800,7,1087,5.050279329608938

853900,1,6304383835,"The Associate (1996) Whoopi Goldberg, at the time the hardest working woman in show business, pops up in what must have been her 19th movie that year. Unfortunately, it is a criminally overlong comedy that beats its one joke to death early on and has nowhere else to go. Whoopi plays an up-and-coming business financier who keeps running into a brick wall because she is a woman. Undaunted, she sets up her own business, but finds the same trouble. So, in desperation, she invents a non-existent male partner, and soon business is booming. Eventually, Whoopi has to disguise herself as this guy, an old white man, in what was supposed to be the film's big conceit. But this sequence only lasts a few minutes, and that turns out to be good, because Whoopi looks like she's wearing a particularly cheap Halloween mask for a disguise. After the rather convincing getup Robin Williams wore in Mrs. Doubtfire, this thing just looks silly. So, after the biggest set piece in the film fizzles, it somehow manages to drag out for another forty minutes (!), ending up with an astonishing two hour running time. Any goodwill I still had towards this film drained away long before the last credit rolled up the screen. Skip it. Also with Dianne Wiest (The Birdcage) and Eli Wallach (The Magnificent Seven).",1234656000,,1295,4.785714285714286

In order to be given credit due, it is still necessary to do everything the men do a little better and in high heels!  So creating a male colleague who ends up taking all the credit seemed like a perfectly normal thing.  All the chain reactions were just added fun.",1232928000,,442,4.353658536585366
853902,3,6304383835,"The Associates is a Whoopi Goldberg vehicle about a Black woman on Wall Street. Though she is smart and hard working, no one takes her seriously, so she invents a White male associate, Robert S. Cutty. Though no one ever sees him, he gets the reputation of being a financial genius. The more he hides, the more people want to see him, until finally, Whoopi, with the help of a drag queen, does reverse drag as a White male.

The Associates is mildly entertaining, though the rapid rise of Robert S. Cutty is not really plausible. He makes one deal and the next thing you know he is on the cover of Fortune. Still, it is just an excuse for Whoopi to turn the tables and make a statement about racial prejudice and sexism. Oh, yeah, it is a comedy, not a Wall Street Journal primer on finance. The financial stuff is not very realistic, and I guess it isn't trying to be Wall Street(the Oliver Stone film), but Trading Places with Eddie Murphy was a lot more successful in showing how the world of high finance operates, and also in exploring racial prejudice with comedy. The Associates doesn't really aspire to be realistic, as it is only a flimsy premise for the whacky antics of Goldberg & Co.

Bebe Neuwirth plays a smart broker who tries to use her gender to her advantage. There is a totally gratuitous scene with her modeling lingerie, which I enjoyed--but felt that it was not integral to the plot; in fact it was more like a non sequitar. Perhaps it was meant to set up a joke later on, and should be judged solely on whether or not you laughed. I did chuckle a bit here and there, and was amused.

One other quibble, the whole movie was building towards a climax where Whoopi impersonates Robert S. Cutty, her imaginary White male Associate, and I think they cheated. He is not credited, but I think they just used an actual White male with Whoopi's voice dubbed in. That was kind of a let down. I remember in Little Big Man Dustin Hoffman was made to look very old with make up. As the story begins, Jack Crabb, who is about 100 years old, tells his tale of being raised by Indians and fighting at Little Big Horn. Then the story flashes back and you see it is Jack Crabb, the same person, only much younger. It was a make up tour de force, and most impressive. They may have had something similar in mind with The Associate, but then reality and budget constraints set in. I am not 100% sure it wasn't her under that latex and make up, but I am highly dubious. If someone knows otherwise, please speak up, and leave a comment.

853904,5,6304383835,"This movie is extremely well done, and raised some political controversy at the time, with Whoopi being a black woman donning ""whiteface"" makeup.

While many would see this movie superficially as an illustration of the ""glass ceiling"" for women in America, I think it is a far richer film with deeper characterizations and poignance.

Whoopi plays a smart, enterprising woman (Laurel Ayers) in an investment/banking firm.  However, all of her ideas are usurped by the man (Frank), who epitomizes the sleazy old boy's network, and who takes credit for all of her ideas and hard work.  When she is passed up for a promotion, that is the last straw, and she quits the firm to start her own.  The clerical assistant (Sally Dugan), wonderfully played by Dianne Wiest, sees the potential in this young woman and encourages her.
When Laurel is unable to get anywhere as she attempts to start her own firm, the excuse always being, "" I love the proposal, but my 'associate' would not go for it.""  She is about ready to throw in the towel, when Sally steps in and gets her an appointment with the hot financier in town....

Laurel realizes that being a black female is not getting her where she needs to go, so she becomes.....  an elderly white male.....  her  newfound success soon gets her on people's radar screens, read 'Frank', and like so many success stories, if you won't be co-opted by them? They will seek to destroy you! On the verge of throwing in the towel, seeing the rat she once worked with taking credit for her work, she finds her mojo, with spectacular and hilarious results.  The ultra-exclusive, white male only, club will never be the same.  Sometimes the good gals DO indeed finish first!

This movie while being totally hilarious, also touches on themes of believing in yourself.  Racism.  Sexism. And how we treat others, as Laurel has to confront her own hypocrisy as how she treats her diamond in hiding secretary.

I never get tired of watching this movie, and am always 100% sure that guests to my home 1)  have never seen this movie, and 2)  thoroughly enjoy it when I show it to them.",1175040000,2,2107,4.663956639566396

853906,5,6304383835,"Whoopi is great as Laurel Ayers, a talented stockbroker/investment officer who gets passed over for a promotion, and her male assistant gets the job instead. Like a lot of women in high-powered firms, Laurel tries to break through the glass ceiling but runs into roadblocks from the Old Boys' Network. She sets about starting her own investment firm, but nobody will do business with her until she invents a male partner by the name of Robert S. Cutty. Hilarity ensues as Laurel has to make excuses to clients why the mysterious Mr. Cutty never attends meetings, never meets clients, never talks to the press.

Dianne Wiest is a great sidekick as Laurel's assistant, a bright woman in her own right who has been kept down in dead-end positions. Timothy Daly is great as the sleazy, no-talent Frank who manages to take credit for Laurel's ideas and steal her promotion right out from under her. As the story progresses, you really end up hating this guy, which shows how good Daly's portrayal was. He never stoops to an extreme caricature of the Bad Guy, and it's quite satisfying he gets his comeuppance in the end.

Very funny film, although I thought the scene where they try to kill off Cutty in his car was a bit silly. All in all, this is a great movie to watch over and over again, and one that still rings true even today for women trying to attain high-powered positions in what is traditionally male domain.",1156118400,2,1416,4.637450199203188

Whoopi Goldberg plays a successful stock-broker, who hires a secretary and develops this zany character named Mr. Cutty by donning a win, special makeup and a latex mask, in order, to land an account with an elderly gentleman, who only does business with other male stockbrokers, hence, ""Laurel's"" reasons for creating the Mr. Cutty character because ""Laurel"" decides that she's just as smart as any man, so she creates ""Mr. Robert Cutty.""

It's an easy-to-follow comedy, which also yields some inspiration to women and men, too, who are needing a little boost of confidence in their abilities to succeed in a difficult, challenging world.

I highly recommend this film to anyone over 18 due to some adult themes.",1138924800,2,966,4.914110429447852
853909,5,6304383835,"This remake of the French film ups the social ante.  The original film was about a mousy male who is overlooked.  This is about the glass ceiling.

Whoopi works for an investment firm.  She gets the job done through hard work.  Her associate (Tim ""Wings"" Daly) gets the job done through the ""old boy's network.""  When he gets Whoopi's promotion, Whoopi quits.  She finds in the investment world, that a woman is only as good as the man behind her.

Therefore, Whoopi creates a man to stand behind.  This works until one of her client's refused to close a deal until he meets the mysterious Mr. Cutty.  So with the help of her drag queen tenant, Whoopi becomes the white Mr. Cutty.  And of course, this spins even more out of control.  This film goes from social satire to complete farce.

Whoopi gives a tour de force performance and Dianne Wiest plays the quintessential secretary.  Even Bebe Neuwirth has a great role as a publicist who will do anything to get

the top client.

This film works on many levels.  Most people will enjoy this film for one reason or another.

7869009,5,6304383835,"Whoppie Goldberg stars as a Wall Street genius who has to work ten times harder than her male counterparts to even be considered an equal.  After leaving her job for a prominent Wall Street firm, she starts her own firm only to discover that it's almost impossible for a woman to compete in a male-dominated ""club"".
I won't spoil the rest of the plot, but the movie contains her hysterical antics as well as the struggles of ""everywoman"" to be able to find a place in society that doesn't always consider her an equal.
It's a must see!",1516838400,,535,4.459183673469388
