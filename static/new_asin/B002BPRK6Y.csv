8361774,5,B002BPRK6Y,"If anybody is reading this and saw the price on this dvd then you'll know that the only person that can afford this DVD is justin bieber,Im sorry but $431 dollars is way to much for any dvd on this planet I don't even know why they would put this on Amazon, its a good show but its not worth that much I mean dang with that kind of money I can get me a wii and bike who's ever selling this dvd must be thinking that we got big pay checks like the people that walk on the red carpet.",1304985600,,482,3.782178217821782
8361775,5,B002BPRK6Y,"I'd like to point out that I haven't actually bought this box set yet, but plan to as soon as possible. I do have the adventure 01 and 02 sets. I'm pretty sure this is not an official release and I'm not sure why they cost so much, but it is well worth it. The quality is pretty decent, and the box art is nice, and Digimon (the first three series) is one of the most fantastic shows ever to grace the small screen. The only qualm I have is that the original Japanese and subtitles is not present (however the english version is great anyhow). That and the absence of any of the movies on any set.
Like another reviewer said, the Pokemon games are great, but Digimon had by far the better TV show. Pokemon may have had longevity, but Digimon was a piece of art, with a real story that was working toward an end (actually several stories considering only the first two series existed in the same continuity) instead of a show about veiled dog-fighting.
It's hard to decide which show is better. When you first put in Tamers, you almost want to hate it for having all new characters and changing the way everything works and etc. But then you just can't help but think this is probably the best series yet and think that it just has so much heart. It's a bit more real too. Idunno. It's hard to describe.
As soon as I can I'll be buying this set.",1273363200,2,1344,4.233463035019455
8361776,5,B002BPRK6Y,"Digimon Season 3 was an interesting and deeply metaphysical season. Pushing the orignal conceptual boundaries of what Digimon was defined as with the first 2 seasons, Season 3 puts a ""real world"" twist on things. In this season, Digimon is a cartoon show, card game, and toy line for kids, with the acutal first 2 seasons of Digimon being a tv show in the storyline of the 3rd season. Its a slow start and an odd way to tell things, but the storyline is actually pretty good, although a bit heady for children. All that said, its a good season and well worth the buy.",1258848000,4,567,4.40952380952381
8361777,3,B002BPRK6Y,"This series is great, and even though it is the dub, it has the scenes completely unedited, so it's like an uncut dub, bu be cautious, I own a lot of bootleg anime and none have the cheap DVD quality of these(and these look profesionally packaged)at first you fall in love with them but after a certain time with the DVD's they will stop playing and no DVD player will play them, the laptop and everything just say the it's an unsupported format type and will never play, so for how high the price these DVD's suck, maybe it was just my copy, but im just giving the warnign in case others have had this happen to them too and help others who are considering buying them...",1258416000,12,672,4.299212598425197
8361778,3,B002BPRK6Y,"Just so you know, the rating above does not reflect my opinion of the show itself (which I would rate higher), but of this long-overdue DVD boxset that finally brought ""Digimon Tamers"" into my household.

For starters, I should point out that yes, this probably is a bootleg on account of there being absolutely no credit given to Buena Vista Entertainment or Disney in general. With that said, it's a pretty fine bootleg: the covers of the case are a bit uneven (of course, that may be just my copy), but the box itself is sturdy and discs inside certainly look professionally printed. Each of the five DVDs contains about ten episodes, amassing the complete 51 installments. The audio is 2.0 stereo and the aspect ratio is fullscreen; personally, I think it looks and sounds pretty good, but tech nuts will probably feel ripped off.

Sadly, this set only includes the Americanized version of the show...meaning you're only getting the goofy English dub and the expected censoring (which isn't as noticeable as it was in, say, ""Dragon Ball"", but it's disappointing nonetheless). There are also no subtitles, so there's really no way around the overly kiddy vocal performances that'll eventually get on the nerves of everybody over nine years old.

In all, this set is worth owning for fans that are either too smart or too scared to download the original cuts illegally, but it's not the full Digimon experience. However, since it's not likely that Disney is going to release the series by themselves, in its entirety (and almost certainly not in its original format), this is definitely the best bet for fans willing to shell out a chunk of money.",1257206400,7,1649,4.840425531914893
8361779,1,B002BPRK6Y,"Unfortunately, this (and other Digimon releases from Alliance Entertainment) is a bootleg.  What you're buying here are DVDs burned by some guys that downloaded them off the Internet.  The license to Digimon is currently owned by Disney...which is why it airs on ABC Family (owned by Disney) often.  Disney does not license out their titles to be distributed on DVD by other companies.

Save your money and do not buy this.",1256515200,4,423,4.915492957746479
8361780,5,B002BPRK6Y,"Since the other review gave a pretty good rundown on the show, I'll just add a little more to it. In my opinion, Season 3 is quite the best season due to the more serious nature of the premise. Even though this season takes place in a different timeline (basically the first two seasons are viewed as a television programs), the story, dialogue and action sequences are top notch. As I mentioned in my other Digimon reviews...save yourself the trouble and headache and just buy it for a reasonable price at Toonjunkie or somewhere else.

8361781,5,B002BPRK6Y,"Digimon Tamers is the third season, which is another complex storyline with brilliant characters and lots of humour. The previous two seasons are seen as a TV show in Tamers.

The chosen children, Tamers are facing the D-Reaper, a misguided program that got mutated and is now going to destroy two worlds.

The main characters are Rika, Henry and Takato. However, other characters such as Jeri, Ryo, Kazu, Kenta and Suzie are also quite important. It takes place mostly in the real world, much like season two.
