8415481,5,B0043XD08Y,"James Levine is one of the great conductors of operas.  He is by far the most faithful conductor to the intention of the composer. Considering many famous conductors fail to understand music score and misinterpret them, James Levine's achievement is outstanding.

If the rest of the collection mirrors these two productions, I'm in for a real treat. I have been a follower of MET productions since the 1960s (mostly the MET radio broadcasts) and at one time would load up on blank audio cassettes to record the live broadcasts.  I eventually collected more than 100 performances on tape.

8415484,5,B0043XD08Y,"Yes, the review which put it: ""get ready to go to Opera Heaven"" is close to the truth, with a minor reservation being that you find enough of your favorite operas among the listings here, OR, that you are open to the maxim that it's hard to find a failure from the Met.

It certainly wouldn't hurt to be exposed to any opera here with which you may not yet be familiar.

Absolutely stunning, especially if you're a fan of Elektra, is Hildegard Behrens, as the poor heroine, driven almost insane by her desire for revenge.  Behrens looks both as haunted as an Elektra can be, AND also forceful enough, charged with determination to insure that her vengeance is carried off.  Her dance near the end with her words, ""Don't I hear the music?--Why it's coming from me!"" is the most ecstatic and convincing Elektra you will ever experience.  Add to this Deborah Voight's Chrysotemis, who passionately proclaims that she wants to live, before she dies--and you have one of the most remarkable experiences in dramatic opera history.

Puccini's Il Tritico provides an opportunity to see the great Renata Scotto give us all a singing lesson.  Cornell MacNeil again proves that he should be given far more recognition and appreciation.

The Rosenkavalier in this collection is classic, providing us with an elegant and beautiful Kiri te Kanawa as the Marschallin, and the bubbly young Judith Blegen as a convincing Sophie.  Tatiana Troyanos is our trouser role Octavian, convincing in her gait as well as impeccable singing.  Derek Hammond Stroud portrays one of the best-ever Lord Faninals, varying between bumbling and putting on the airs of the nouveau-riche.  What could add more to this than the perfect Baron Ochs:  Kurt Moll.  The sound of his mellow bass would be the highlight of this performance, if the others were not equally perfect.  This will stand forever as perhaps the greatest Der Rosenkavalier.

I'm afraid if I continue with all these superlatives for each performance--which basically have been addressed by other reviews--you'll either be bored, or disbelieve that it could possibly be this good.  But it is, and James Levine deserves this monument to his supreme talent at helping Met productions be all that they can be.  He's truly put the mark of distinction on the term, ""Live from the Met.""  I will cherish this set and revel in sharing it with friends!",1311292800,4,2371,4.885

8415486,5,B0043XD08Y,I saw the original broadcasts of many of these operas and I have been in a state of euphoria watching them.  People talk about Peter Gelb and the Met's dedication to theatricalizing opera...have they seen these DVDs??????? They are amazingly theatrical and yet vocally and musically uncompromising.  Renata Scotto is supreme artist.  Teresa Stratas is a revelation.  Please watch Jon Vickers bring humanity to a comic character.  Tatyana Troyanos is amazing.  It makes Anna Netrebko and the rest of them look foolish.  I hate to be disrespectful to the younger generation of singers but it is not the same.  The release of these DVDs is a fantastic opportunity for true opera lovers to see some of the greatest performances ever given.,1292198400,22,735,5.016528925619835
8415487,4,B0043XD08Y,"The earliest performance hails from 1978, Smetana's ""The Bartered Bride,"" with Teresa Stratas, Nicolai Gedda, Jon Vickers, and Martti Talvela, in John Dexter's production.  This is possibly the greatest performance under review.  The staging is marvelous, the choreography (by Pavel mot) is stunning, and the sets (by Josef Svoboda) and costumes (Jan Skalicky) a delight.  Dexter's production is one of his finest, and is a marvel of invention and beauty.  (Especially noteworthy is the blending of actors and dancers.)  The English translation, by the English poet and playwright Tony Harrison, is so far above the ordinary that it makes many other translators' work (say, Ruth and Thomas Martin) risible.

 The cast could hardly be bettered.  Stratas (who had recorded this opera, in German translation, in 1975, opposite Ren Kollo and Janet Perry as Esmeralda) is here at her zenith, beautiful and touching as an actress.  She was a mistress of intimacy, ideal for the medium of film.  Small-scaled and intense, she is the Eleonora Duse to Maria Callas's Sarah Bernhardt.  Gedda was past the age of fifty by 1978, yet gives an excellent portrayal of an impetuous, but sly, youth.  He is also in splendid voice.  Before the prima, Vickers had warned us that we would weep for his character, and indeed we do so.  The greatest Tristan, Otello, ne, Grimes, and Parsifal, is here a stuttering simpleton, who even dons a bear-suit!  Talvela, with his impenetrable Finnish accent, is a towering, amusing villain.

 In the well-cast secondary roles, we have another distinguished Canadian Heldentenor, Alan Crofoot, as the Circus Manager.  He was ideal in this, his Met debut.  Tragically, he was the victim of a suicide the following year.

 In his posthumous ""autobiography,"" Dexter revealed that Levine was originally considering another production of the ""played-out"" ""Die Fledermaus,"" but that the British director suggested the Smetana instead.  This set is, incidentally, a good example of the inexplicitness of the Metropolitan's omission of the names of stage directors on the front covers of most of their DVDs.

 Another historic Levine/Dexter collaboration was of the Brecht/Weill ""Aufstieg und Fall der Stadt Mahagonny"" (sung in translation, as ""Rise and Fall of the City of Mahagonny""), in 1979, with Stratas, Astrid Varnay, Richard Cassilly, Ragnar Ulfung, and Cornell MacNeil.

 This is an uneven, but fascinating, work, and it received the full focus of the Met in what may be remembered as one of its finest eras, when the company was crawling out from under the repressive period of the lengthy tenure of the philistine Sir Rudolf Bing.

 Here we have Dexter's nearly-bare stage, with designs by his friend, Jocelyn Herbert, and peopled by curious, decadent characters.  (This writer saw a revival of this production in the theatre, in 1984.)  In the liner-notes of this recording, Maestro Levine recalls his work with Dexter:  ""Our collaboration was wonderfully creative, and several really successful productions came out of it.  He was brilliant and yet extremely difficult to work with.  But the results were usually worth it, and in my opinion his vision and his philosophy were very good for the Met.  At his best he was a great director, and surely his best productions are still classics of their kind.""  It was after Dexter's gradual, bitter withdrawal from the Met that the company descended into the gargantuan, gaudy productions of Franco Zeffirelli and his ilk.

 The casting here, again, is ideal.  Stratas is seen in one of her finest roles, the prostitute Jenny Smith.  (Her costuming in Acts II and III is very revealing, however.)  Varnay, a great Wagnerian of the previous generation, is a domineering Widow Begbick, wild of voice and committed to the Brechtian aesthetic.  Cassilly, with his enormous voice, makes the lumberjack Jim Mahoney a tragic poet.  Audiences were accustomed to seeing MacNeil playing the tragic heroes and antiheros of Verdi, yet he masters this role, even to a convincing boxing match with the great Paul Plishka.  Another stand-out in the cast is the tenor Arturo Sergi, as Jacob Schmidt.

 The 1980 performance of Dexter's 1979 production of Verdi's ""Don Carlos"" (in Italian translation), is headed by Vasile Moldoveanu, Renata Scotto, Tatiana Troyanos, Sherrill Milnes, Plishka, and Jerome Hines.

 Dexter's production is severe and intense, culminating in an overwhelming auto-da-fe, the burning of unrepentant heretics.  (This writer saw the 1984 revival in the theatre.)  Scotto and Troyanos are particularly fine in rendering his ethos, a kind of concentrated stillness.  The costumes are brilliant.

 Moldoveanu is better than one might have recalled.  Without the glamour of other exponents of Don Carlos, such as Vickers, Plcido Domingo, or Roberto Alagna, he sings the role more musically than many other tenors of the past who are nearly worshipped.  Scotto was certainly one of the greatest of singing-actresses, and shows herself, once again, to be a complete actress.  Her transition from the happy French princess of the beginning of the opera to the tragic Queen of Spain is extraordinary.  Her voice, if not of an objective ""beauty,"" is completely expressive.  Troyanos is seen here in one of her finest portrayals, as the flamboyant Princesse of Eboli, and Milnes is also seen in one of his most sympathetic roles.

  For this writer, Plishka's greatest role was that of King Philippe II.  He certainly did not resemble the great Catholic monarch of history, but he mastered the role, one of the most complex for basses.  Even if one is not a usual admirer of Hines, it must be admitted that his Grand Inquisiteur was a triumph.  Despite a worn voice, he thunders to great effect as this mysterious character who, in reality, dominates this grand opera.  In the secondary roles, Betsy Norden, John Cheek, and Timothy Jenkins make particularly felicitous impressions.  The 1983 revival of this production, with Domingo, Mirella Freni, Grace Bumbry, Louis Quilico, Nicolai Ghiaurov, and Ferruccio Furlanetto, had been previously issued on DVD.

  We had to wait thirty years for the 1980 telecast of Berg's ""Lulu"" to be made available to the public, and it proves worthy of the greatest anticipation. It had only been in 1979 that the completed three-act version of the twelve-tone masterpiece was premiered, in Paris, with Stratas in Patrice Chreau's production, conducted by the great Pierre Boulez.  Dexter had seen that production, but went his own way at the Met. This is indeed one of his best productions, naturalistic but intimately tied to the music.  The level of detail and insight into this difficult work is astonishing.  The quality of the performance (both musical and visual) seems like they had been rehearsing the work for years rather than weeks.  (This writer saw the 1988 revival in the theatre.)

  At the time of the telecast, one registered disappointment, since Stratas was to have been the anti-heroine. Today, we can better evaluate Julia Migenes's performance, and it is of stellar quality. Without the demonic, serpentine quality of the great Anja Silja, or the death-haunted version of Stratas, she is perhaps the most sensuous of all, both in voice and approach.

  And what an opera: It traces the degradation of a mesmerizing sociopath, along with everyone in her circle, through to her death at the hands of ""Jack the Ripper,"" no less. The music is very complex, to overwhelming effect.  We can see that Levine clearly loves the score, and almost the entire cast could hardly be improved: Evelyn Lear (still a great beauty at the age of fifty-four, as the Countess Geschwitz), Kenneth Riegel, Frank Little, Franz Mazura, Lenus Carlson, Andrew Foldi, Hilda Harris, Nico Castel, Ara Berberian, Norden, Batyah Godfrey, Nedda Casei, and John Darrenkamp. It is amazing to have artists of this caliber in even the secondary roles.  As William R. Braun wrote, in 2011, ""It is likely that this 'Lulu' will stand for all time as the high-water mark of Met telecasts.""  ""Lulu,"" and especially this production of it, is a towering achievement, a terrible outcry of humanity.

 Puccini's ""Il trittico"" had its world premiere at the Met in 1918, and this 1981 revival was the first time the three heroines of the triptych were taken by one soprano at that theatre.  And a tour-de-force it certainly was for that prima donna.  In the dour ""Il tabarro,"" we have MacNeil, Scotto, and Moldoveanu as the ill-fated love-triangle.  MacNeil is a glowering presence, absolutely commanding in voice and appearance.  Scotto is incomparably vivid as the unhappy Giorgetta, searing and pathetic in her panegyric to city-life.  Moldoveanu is here much better than in ""Don Carlos"":  The histrionic demands are far less in this work, and his voice has no difficulty in surmounting this vocally-demanding role.

 Bianca Berini is splendidly Italianate as La Frugola, as both singer and actress, and is paired well with the veteran Italo Tajo.  This is one of Charles Anthony's finest performances on video, as the dissipant, Il Tinca.  Fabrizio Melano's staging is ordinary, but canny.

 ""Suor Angelica"" has a legendary performance in the title role by Mme Scotto.  From the start, she is marked by sorrow and seeming resignation.  When a guest arrives at the Parlor, she is almost beside herself.  When she finally questions her aunt, the Princess, about the son she was forced to abandon seven years earlier, her release of pent-up emotions is almost unbearable to watch.  Her despair at the news of her son's death leads her to a false exaltation, and the immense regret at the taking of her own life.  All this is conveyed in singing and acting on the very highest level of accomplishment.

 Norden is very fine as the cheerful Sister Genovieffa, and Jocelyne Taillon is very good as the Princess, but Scotto would have required a fiercer adversary as her cold aunt, like the great Dunja Vejzovic, in the 1983 performance on DVD, from the Teatro alla Scala.

 Melano's staging in the first part of the opera is jittery and frivolous, not rightly representing a monastery where, perforce, composure reigns.  The Marian Miracle at the end, however, is handled in an arresting manner.  Instead of actually showing the arrival of the Queen of Heaven, with Angelica's child in attendance, Melano has only Angelica seeing the Vision, which is in accordance with the theology concerning such manifestations.  One wonders how effective it was in the theatre, but here, with Scotto as the tragic nun, it reaches the heights of sublimity.  We see her pantomiming seeing the Virgin, and receiving her child in her own arms, at last.  Then, repentant and forgiven, we see the life force slip from her.  In truth, this is an unforgettable performance.

 ""Gianni Schicchi"" is not a performance worthy of the other panels of this triptych, unfortunately.  Comic opera is often the venue for the worst acting imaginable.  The production of ""The Bartered Bride,"" discussed above, is proof this need not always apply.  But here, we have to endure ""funny walks"" and gross exaggerations, especially in the secondary roles.  It is sad that Melano encouraged/tolerated/allowed such antics.  Gabriel Bacquier, Scotto, Taillon, Tajo, and Philip Creech lead the ensemble cast.  Bacquier is very fine, but is obviously giving us ""M.Bacquier's Schicchi,"" divorced from the rest of the production.  Scotto is charming, and gives us the movements of an elegant, young woman.  Creech gives a sympathetic account of himself as the romantic Rinuccio.  Norden also remains above the clowning as Nella, a role quite the opposite of her usual ""sweet"" characters.

 A word about the English subtitles on these DVDs.  It has seldom been remarked upon, but these are not adequate.  Libretto questions are asked, answers not given, and vice-versa.  While one cannot expect--or desire--full translations, what we are given from the Met are usually simplifications; interpretations of what is really being sung.  It is both condescending and tiresome.  This is a particular problem in ""Suor Angelica,"" where everything has been simplified, and sometimes deliberately giving false impressions of what is sung.  The Latin texts for the angels who herald the advent of the Blessed Virgin Mary were carefully chosen by Puccini, with Jesuitical aid.  They are partially from the prayer, ""O gloriosa virginum,"" which our translator renders as being the text of the ""Ave Maria.""  This is but one example of the arrogance and laziness involved.  In ""Gianni Schicchi,"" friars are mistaken for monks, etc.

 ""Der Rosenkavalier"" was televised in 1982, with Levine leading Troyanos, Dame Kiri Te Kanawa, Kurt Moll, Judith Blegen, Derek Hammond-Stroud, and Luciano Pavarotti.  Nathanial Merrill's staging is stale and inferior, with many of the secondary roles turned into caricatures and the principals often left to their own devices, even to frequent and obvious glances in the direction of the conductor.

 Troyanos would have been a top-flight Octavian in a more sophisticated production, one that would have encouraged her to portray a youth (as Blegen does so successfully) and would not have made her ""Mariandel"" so exaggerated.  Indeed, even the fatuous Baron Ochs would not have been taken in by such an embarrassed and uncomfortable parody.  Dame Kiri surely was to grow into the role of the Marschallin:  In Act I, she seems almost somnambulant, so under-energized and unfocussed is the soprano.  By Act III, nevertheless, she is transformed into a beautiful and sagacious heroine.  Needless to say, hers was one of the loveliest voices of our era.

 Moll is blessedly free of the usual exaggerations that often plague the role of the Baron, and is a total success.  Blegen's Sophie, however, is the treasure of this performance, with a very expressive and pretty face, who wins all hearts by her touching portrayal.  She is the principal least affected by the provincialism of the staging.

 Pavarotti enters mugging, and then blankly stares at his score for his cameo as the Italian Singer, then mugs again his way off the stage.  He is most expressive during his curtain call.  The many small roles are best served by Castel (who retains his dignity), Joseph Frank, Anthony Laciura (in his Met debut), Charles Anthony, and Richard Vernon as an excellent Police Commissary.

 ""Le nozze di Figaro"" dates from 1985, and was staged by Jean-Pierre Ponnelle, one of the greatest directors of his generation.  This is, however, one of his ""safe"" productions, and one is reminded of Rolf Liebermann's declaration that some of Ponnelle's work became commercialized.  Carol Vaness (the Contessa) and Kathleen Battle (Susanna) both reproduce his intricate staging, but are rather blank.  The former has much more voice than the feather-light soprano of the latter, but is devoid of any indication of aristocratic demeanor.  Frederica von Stade, however, truly captures the spirit of the awkward adolescent, Cherubino, and has a perfect legato.

 Sir Thomas Allen personifies the arrogant Count Almaviva to perfection, the cause of repression in all in his circle.  He, too, is an ideal Mozart singer.  Ruggero Raimondi delivers a terrific Figaro.  Happy is the theatre than can lay claim to both Sir Thomas and Raimondi in one production!

 Also in the ensemble are Artur Korn, as a very fine Don Bartolo, and Taillon a good Marcellina.  But Susanne Marsee was, six years later, to give us a marvelously vivid Marcellina when the opera was televised from the neighboring New York City Opera. Michel Snchal, in every precise gesture--both vocal and physical--gives us an amusing Don Basilio, and Laciura is a busy-bee Don Curzio.  Dawn Upshaw is a charming Barbarina, one ready to progress to Susanna, which she indeed was to record five years later, under Levine.

 Maestro Levine's tempi sometimes verge on the lugubrious, making us long for the original-instrument approach to Mozart.

 ""The Ghosts of Versailles,"" with music by John Corigliano and libretto by William M. Hoffman, was given its world premiere by the Met, and this is the 1982 telecast of that very production.  It featured a large cast, headed by Stratas, Hkan Hagegrd, Gino Quilico, Marilyn Horne, Graham Clark, and Rene Fleming, and was a magnificent achievement.

 Hoffman's text is brilliant, and while Corigliano's score is a pastiche, it is an impressive one.  He imitates styles from that of Mozart (to boring effect) to the twentieth-century avant-garde (to thrilling effect).  It's also rather lengthy:  It surprises one that composers and playwrights continue to score such expansive evenings while their audiences' attention-spans grow ever briefer.  Previously, Colin Graham's productions at the Met included a very prosaic ""La traviata"" (1981), so this astonishing staging may come as a surprise.  It is endlessly inventive, and takes full advantage of the company's theatrical possibilities.

 Stratas is extraordinary as the misunderstood Marie Antoinette, giving her all in a controlled, gripping performance.  She is the cynosure of the production.  Hagegrd sings the role of Beaumarchais gloriously, and Quilico is the ideal Figaro, oozing with charm and athletic magnetism.  Horne gives, as might be expected from her, a bravura performance as the exotic Samira.  Clark is truly malevolent as the horrible Bgearss (and gives us a morsel of the evil that was the French Revolution), and gives a complete characterization.  Fleming, as the Countess Almaviva, is heard here before she turned every score into ""jazz,"" and makes us regret what might have been possible in her career.

 Several of the other roles are particularly well-cast, especially Tracy Dahl, and Ara Berberian who is heard (not seen) as the Pasha, and Dean Badolato who is seen (not heard) as his Page.  Finally, the handsome tenor, Neil Rosenshein, is wonderful as Lon, the illegitimate son of the Countess and Cherubino!

  ""Elektra,"" here filmed at a 1994 performance, is certainly one of the greatest operas in history, but we have ""'Hamlet' without the Prince.""  Hildegard Behrens was one of those singers who, by throwing themselves into their roles without discipline, without dignity, called themselves singing-actors, thereby lessening that noble title.  Far from acting the role in a acceptable manner in this performance, whenever she sings her shoulders are hunched, her head pulled downward into her chest, her eyes almost always cast downwards (except for glances at the conductor), her fists clenched.  One might suspect she ended up having to do all this so as to emit what voice she had, a shop-worn, colorless soprano.  Her dancing is so risible it looks improvised.  When one considers the fact that Dame Gwyneth Jones sang the role at the Met later the same season, it is bitterly disappointing the telecast did not take place with her in the title role.  Dame Gwyneth does not have a beautiful voice, but her production of it (such as it is) allows her to be a great, expressive actress.  In a weird manner, Behrens is only open and expressive--even transcendent--in her curtain calls, rather in the style of Pavarotti.

  Deborah Voigt is excellent as Elektra's ""normal"" sister, Chrysothemis, and is near ideal in the part.  Brigitte Fassbaender, at the end of her career, triumphs as their awful mother, Klytmnestra.  She is frightening and absolutely commanding as the fallen Queen.  James King's Heldentenor is still in fine shape as Aegisth, and Sir Donald McIntyre is a stirring Orest.  (He had sung the same role in the Met's previously televised performance of this opera in 1980, opposite Birgit Nilsson.)  Herbert Perry, as the Guardian of Orest, makes his mark in an intriguing cameo.

  Otto Schenk was brought in as producer, replacing the old production by Herbert Graf.  He was an obvious and utterly uninspired choice, and this staging could have been done by anyone working in the American provinces.

  With ""Wozzeck,"" we come to certainly one of the history's most powerful operas.  Falk Struckmann, Katrina Dalayman, Wolfgang Neumann, Clark, and Michael Devlin lead the cast of this 2001 performance, in the staging of Mark Lamos.  (This writer saw this production in the theatre, in 1997.)

  Lamos' production is spare and simple, a legitimate way to deal with this work, considering the ferocity and complexity of the music.  The appropriately expressionistic lighting (by James F. Ingalls) is very especially effective.  Levine is here at his absolute finest, showing his power and mastery in a difficult score.

  Struckmann is excellent in the Everyman of the title, with an attractive, dark sound.  Dalayman has (rather unusual for the Expressionistic operas) a healthy-sounding voice, and captures the impoverished, ordinary, sympathetic woman who is Marie.

  Neumann is marvelous as the Drum Major.  With a controversial voice, to be certain, he delivers an unstinting and memorable portrait of this unpleasant character.  Clark actually sings the role of the Captain, a role in which tenors are usually content to simply scream.  Devlin is chillingly masterful as the Doctor.  A credit to his long-ago mentor, the great Norman Treigle (who contemplated, but never undertook, the title role of this opera), his plasticity of gesture is a lesson in great operatic acting.

  Elsewhere in this fine cast, John Horton Murray is a remarkable Andres, and Laciura had one of his finest roles as the deranged Fool.

  It must be regretted that earlier casts in the Metropolitan's performance history of ""Wozzeck"" were not filmed.  Silja's Marie (1980) was epochal, and Christian Boesch's Wozzeck (1985) was heartbreaking.  This writer has heard this opera many times, and they were the most memorable portrayals of these parts in his experience.

  The performance of ""Ariadne auf Naxos"" (from 2003) in Elijah Moshinsky's staging, is magnificent, with Voigt, Natalie Dessay, Susanne Mentzer, Richard Margison, and Nathan Gunn heading the fine cast.  Voigt displays a delightful sense of comic timing as the Prima Donna, whose unfinished coiffure is amusingly askew, and then sails through the name part with ease.  It is good to hear Dessay in good voice, without the shallow, unsupported sound which sometimes afflicts her singing.  Moreover, her extremely naturalistic acting-style is better suited to this opera, rather than the works of the bel canto era that populate her repertoire.

  Mentzer is a total success as the idealistic Composer, portraying the young man's rapidly-changing emotions in a delightful manner.  Margison sails through the difficult part of Bacchus as if it were child's play, his Heldentenor in complete command.  Gunn is fine, as well.

  In the smaller roles, Wolfgang Brendel (as the Music-Master), Waldemar Kmentt (as the Major-Domo), and Tony Stevenson (as the Dancing-Master) are veritable delights.

  Unsurprisingly, Moshinsky's production is beautiful, blending the elements inherent in the work in a masterful fashion.  A 1988 performance from the Met of this opera had previously been published on DVD:  There we have the utterly-magisterial Jessye Norman as Ariadne, with the adorable Stephen Dickson as Harlekin, in his last performance at the Metropolitan.

 The final box in this set is of Met concerts conducted by Levine, starring Troyanos and Domingo (1982), Leontyne Price and Horne (1982), and Domingo and Milnes (1983).

  Previously-issued, particularly outstanding Metropolitan performances on DVD include Dexter's production of ""Rigoletto,"" with MacNeil, Domingo, and Justino Daz (1977); Vickers, Scotto, and MacNeil in ""Otello"" (1978); Scotto and Domingo in ""Manon Lescaut"" (1980); Stratas and Scotto in ""La bohme"" (1982); Scotto, Domingo, MacNeil, and Natalia Rom in Piero Faggioni's production of ""Francesca da Rimini"" (1984); Tito Capobianco's staging of ""Simon Boccanegra,"" with Milnes and Plishka (1984); Elizabeth Futral in ""The First Emperor"" (2007); and Angela Gheorghiu, Alagna, Lisette Oropesa, and Samuel Ramey, in Nicolas Jol's ""La rondine"" (2008).

 Yet to be issued--but much anticipated--are Dexter's productions of ""Don Pasquale,"" with Beverly Sills (in her Met farewell), Bacquier, Alfredo Kraus, and Hagegrd (in his Met debut), conducted by Nicola Rescigno (1979); and ""Dialogues des Carmlites,"" with Maria Ewing and Jessye Norman, conducted by Manuel Rosenthal (1987).",1291680000,44,24477,5.224678663239074
8415488,5,B0043XD08Y,"The Met's first modern TV broadcast was in 1977, and in 1985 the theater made its home-video debut with four titles on VHS and laser disc. More followed. In the DVD age (1997-), Deutsche Grammophon released many previously unavailable broadcasts and eventually absorbed the catalog of Pioneer, the now-defunct label on which the laser discs and some early Met DVDs had appeared. In 2009, the Met began releasing select titles independently.

The most surprising thing about this box celebrating Maestro Levine's 40-year Met tenure -- when one has taken in all 12 items -- is that after a quarter century of various labels picking the low-hanging fruit (the big Verdis, Wagners, and Puccinis, and any broadcast starring Pavarotti or Domingo), there were still so many riches unclaimed. Perhaps it is best not to ask, as one is inclined to ask many times, ""How did *this* not get released before now?"" Simply be thankful these performances can be discovered by a new generation (the HD generation) and rediscovered by previous ones. There is only one dud in the bunch, and even that one is far from the weakest Met broadcast on DVD. A few titles, when released individually, will be strong contenders for the best available performance of that opera from any venue.

One has to accept Smetana's THE BARTERED BRIDE (*****), from 1978, on its own terms as a very old-fashioned performance, the kind the Met might have given 25 or 50 years earlier. International stars cope with a valiant but variable English translation (in the worst moment, comedic villain Kecal, boasting of his intelligence, sings about his ""bags of brains,"" an image worthy of a Wes Craven film). But noted Wagnerian baddie Martti Talvela is genuinely funny just by playing it straight; Teresa Stratas is at her most spirited and lovely as Marenka, sympathetically partnered by Nicolai Gedda's Jenik; and Jon Vickers finds unexpected pathos in the stammering, childlike Vasek.

I question whether Kurt Weill, brilliant 20th-century songwriter that he was, ever could sustain his musical inspiration over the course of a long, ambitious opera. But John Dexter's big, bold and vivid RISE AND FALL OF THE CITY OF MAHAGONNY (1979, ****), with Brecht's text translated into English, should be seen at least once -- make up your own mind. Stratas and Richard Cassilly head the excellent ensemble, and the show is stolen by the commanding Begbick of Astrid Varnay, late in the great soprano's second career in character parts.

The low point is a 1980 broadcast of Verdi's DON CARLO (***), long passed over for video release in favor of a 1983 broadcast of the same Dexter production with a different cast. The choice turns out to have been wise. The '83 is far from perfect, but the only clear advantage for '80 is Renata Scotto's detailed and specific physical acting of Queen Elisabetta (Mirella Freni, her '83 counterpart, is more generalized dramatically but in far smoother voice). Tatiana Troyanos seems taxed by Eboli, in the wrong style and the wrong opera; by the raw, frazzled ""O don fatale,"" she's getting by on will. The male cast is poor (Philip and Carlos depressingly utilitarian); the orchestral response is less good than it would be later.

All that Dexter's adroit, lucid production of Berg's LULU (1980, ****) lacks is a stronger Lulu at the center. Julia Migenes is physically plausible but the character emerges as vacant in the wrong ways. Perhaps a valid point is being made about a blank slate being an ideal object of obsession, but we still have to spend three hours in Lulu's company, and we must understand something of her allure. Still, Franz Mazura's disturbing Schn/Jack the Ripper and the beautiful Evelyn Lear's sad, dignified Geschwitz are not easily shaken off.

The assumption of the three principal female roles in Puccini's IL TRITTICO (1981, *****) was among the greatest triumphs of Scotto's occasionally turbulent run as the Met's unofficial ""house diva,"" and this has long been one of the most conspicuous holes in the operatic video catalog. It is worthy of its legend. Scotto's best collaborators are Cornell MacNeil's scary Michele (TABARRO) and Gabriel Bacquier's easy, fluent protagonist in GIANNI SCHICCHI. Weak tenor partners in the outer operas, and a mezzo who does not get much out of the Principessa in SUOR ANGELICA, take little shine off of Scotto's accomplishment. She is in her best-controlled late voice.

Troyanos is encountered again in the happier circumstances of a signature role, Octavian in Strauss's DER ROSENKAVALIER (1982, *****). This is an ideal video souvenir of the 1969 Merrill/O'Hearn production, the Met's oldest active production of anything, long beloved by the New York public and still being given as of the 2009-10 season. As Troyanos's love interests, Kiri Te Kanawa and Judith Blegen have the experience, the charisma, and the understanding of their parts to match her; Kurt Moll is, as usual, the most musical of Barons; Luciano Pavarotti shows up for a star cameo in the expected place.

""In Concert At The Met"" (****) presents highlights from three 1982-83 concerts, with Levine and orchestra accompanying teams of Troyanos/Plcido Domingo, Leontyne Price/Marilyn Horne, and Domingo/Sherrill Milnes in a wide range of repertoire. The singing is of a high order, often stirring; misfires are few. But be aware that the ""optional English subtitles"" promised by the packaging are not there. This may matter little in standard fare such as OTELLO, CAVALLERIA RUSTICANA, and MADAMA BUTTERFLY, but it is a potential impediment in selections from Handel, Meyerbeer, and Ambroise Thomas. Of course, these concerts were of the pre-Met-Titles age, so we are no worse off than the house audiences were, and they seem not to mind. Horne charmingly ""synopsizes"" for them the HUGUENOTS aria she is about to sing.

Jean-Pierre Ponnelle's approach to Mozart's LE NOZZE DI FIGARO (1985, ****) suggests some sort of autumnal reconsideration -- shadowy, oddly muted, occasionally beautiful, frequently mannered. Pauses are stretched out; familiar comedic business is underplayed; the house lights come up when an angry Figaro advises men to take a close look at their wives, as if the men in the Met audience are literally being given an opportunity to do so. It seems a harbinger of things to come from lesser directors, but the cast succeeds in putting it over, and it is an impressively starry group: Kathleen Battle (seeming to me more adult and less self-regarding than usual), Carol Vaness, Frederica von Stade (the big audience favorite), Thomas Allen, Ruggero Raimondi.

Only the 1992 performance of John Corigliano's THE GHOSTS OF VERSAILLES (*****) was previously available on VHS and LD. It was an unusually successful Met venture into new music, and it is easy to see why -- although it mingles various musical idioms, it is always easy on the ear; it follows familiar characters from history and from Beaumarchais's plays (and the Mozart and Rossini operas from same), and it was cheeky and self-aware enough (in the manner of musicals of that time) to usher in the Age of Irony. But it also poses worthy questions about artists and their creations, about responsibility, redemption and acceptance. The production is as audacious and beautiful as the opera. Fittingly, stars of a passing era collaborate with stars of a dawning one: Stratas (a career-crowning turn as Marie Antoinette), Rene Fleming, Marilyn Horne, Graham Clark (unforgettable in the Iagoesque ""Aria of the Worm""), Gino Quilico, Hakan Hagegard.

With regard to the 1994 Strauss ELEKTRA (****), I must quote Levine directly on leading lady Hildegard Behrens: ""When we taped this performance, she was in a kind of extraordinary, transcendental form. She had acquired a physique du role where she actually looks hollow and emaciated and worn out onstage [...] She captures the whole range of emotions [...] Everything is as though it were actually happening in front of your eyes. She looks so ravaged and yet so beautiful [...] [It is] incredibly moving."" All true. All that keeps this tour de force from being the greatest performance of the title role I have ever seen: that familiar hoarseness that tended to creep into a Behrens performance halfway through, as she fought and forced her way through dramatic/heroic-soprano roles. Here, it shows up in the Orest scene and never leaves. A young Deborah Voigt is in gleaming voice as Chrysothemis; one understands what the excitement was about. Brigitte Fassbaender's Klytmnestra, sadly, is even more caricature than it had been for Abbado/Kupfer (Vienna `89). The great mezzo seems to believe that if you can no longer sing as *well* as before, you should compensate by singing *louder* -- she roars and screams everything, and overacts as if the back row is in New Jersey. I have difficulty imagining an ELEKTRA in which this *would* fit, but opposite Behrens, and within Otto Schenk's cool-hued, serious production, it violates the tone. Time has stiffened and dried out Donald McIntyre's Orest; James King, another Vienna holdover, remains an above-average Aegisth.

Berg's WOZZECK was recorded for broadcast in the early autumn of 2001 (****), not long after 9/11. Perhaps it is the power of suggestion, but something *feels* different. The audience seems keyed up, almost defiant in its reaction to Levine's *entrance*, before anything has even happened musically. Mark Lamos's production unfolds along classical lines of imagery and staging without being obvious, and Katarina Dalayman is a Marie of depth and womanly strength. As Levine notes in the booklet interview, Falk Struckmann (who closely resembles Nicolas Cage) is more of the ""brute"" Wozzeck than the poetic madman, but it is a strong portrayal within its mold.

Finally, Elijah Moshinsky's Strauss ARIADNE AUF NAXOS (2003, ****) segues from a bustling, hyperkinetic backstage to gorgeous stasis -- uncommonly beautiful to behold -- in the ""inner opera."" Susanne Mentzer limns the Composer's neurosis and self-absorption with great intensity, and Natalie Dessay finds a perfect vehicle in Zerbinetta. Habits that can irritate in other music (especially latterly) get an appropriate outlet here; it is a reminder that Dessay's charm can be considerable, her technique dazzling. The ovation for the big coloratura showpiece threatens never to end, and the chemistry with Nathan Gunn's winning, athletic Harlekin is potent. Have Zerbinetta and Harlekin ever steamed up the stage before? Only the ""serious"" portion of the seria disappoints here. Voigt is decidedly pre-gastric-bypass and barely mobile, but does not soar as she had in the '94 ELEKTRA; Richard Margison is a so-so Bacchus.

Levine's booklet interviews for every opera are a pleasure to read. The breadth of the repertoire covered here (and in the Met's CD set of different operas) is a testament to one of his proudest accomplishments: making difficult and less familiar music of all eras part of the Met's core repertoire, challenging both the orchestra and the audience to grow. As for his work in bringing up the quality of the playing, simply compare the two Bergs, the 1980 LULU and the 2001 WOZZECK -- it is remarkable progress. Besides serving as a tribute to the maestro, the box also is a handy summing-up of both the TV-broadcast era and the Joseph Volpe era, and of nearly three decades of great singing.

There are reasonable criticisms: The English subtitles range from middling-good to adequate to, in one case, poor (FIGARO, which serves Lorenzo da Ponte badly -- it starts out trying to pound his verses into bad forced rhymes in English, then just abandons that after a while, and leaves too much untranslated for non-Italian-speakers' comfort). The outer packaging could have been more attractive, better-designed, and more durable, for this occasion and price.

But then there is Renata Scotto finding something true and honest in the potentially cloying final moments of SUOR ANGELICA. And Leontyne Price in ""Pace, pace, mio Dio,"" alternately hiding the ravages of time and letting the years tell, just in the ways you want her to. And Hildegard Behrens's Elektra, between the storms, holding Deborah Voigt's Chrysothemis the way one holds a child, gently crooning to her; and later being an Elektra who doesn't just jog in place a little and run a few feet, but throws her whole *body* into that dance, spastically jigging and maniacally pinwheeling. And there is Teresa Stratas, nearly upstaging the beautiful singing of Fleming and Judith Christin (in ""As summer brings a wistful breeze"" from GHOSTS) just by *listening*, letting her eyes and her face tell us as much about life and love and loss as the sum total of words William Hoffman's libretto gives her over three hours. The price tag is steep, but I advise taking the plunge rather than waiting for these DVDs to dribble out on some arbitrary schedule. This is a treasury.",1291680000,97,12942,5.114947965941344
