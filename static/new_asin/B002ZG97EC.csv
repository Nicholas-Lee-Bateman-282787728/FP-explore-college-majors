4018436,5,B002ZG97EC,"I saw this with my friends, and the movie was actually a lot better than I expected. It's very funny, and has a great heart-warming storyline. The minions were hilarious and adorable. Steve Carell stars as Gru. Gru is a supervillian who tries to compete with Vector. Vector stole the Great Pyramid of Giza in Egypt, so Gru tries to beat him. He comes up with a plan to steal the moon. After he attempts to steal a shrink ray from Vector, he adopts Margo, Edith, and Agnes so he can use them to give boxes of robot cookies to Vector. After he succeeds, he tries to get rid of the kids, but he slowly begins to think like a dad and loves them. He soon must decide what is more important; being a supervillian, or being a superdad. I highly recommend DESPICABLE ME!!!",1278979200,,764,4.3125
4018437,5,B002ZG97EC,"I had seen the various teaser trailers for ""Despicable Me"" and it looked okay, but it was not until I saw the trailer that suddenly introduced three little girls into the mix that I was actually interested in going to catch this in the theater instead of waiting for the DVD.  The little yellow minions were certainly cute enough, but it was the whole idea of how the character of Gru, a nefarious villain who is plotting to steal the money, ends up having to take care of those three little girls that got me interested.  After all, these are computer animated little girls, which means they have those great big eyes.  Well, in turns out, that Gru has hatched up his evil plan to steal the moon because the villain down the street, Vector, has been stealing Gru's thunder (well, actually, Vector stole a pretty big landmark).  The three little girls, who live in a local for-profit orphanage, have been going door to door selling cookies.  Gru turned them away, but Vector loves cookies, which gives Gru an idea that involves the girls and cookie-robots for this wacky new moon race.

One of the things I found impressive about this movie is that Gru's voice never really sounded like Steve Carell, and the same can be said for Julie Andrews as his mom or Kristen Wiig as Miss Hattie.  An animated film where the voices do not conjure up the actual actors and actresses is rather refreshing.  But the voices are really secondary to the main strength of the movie, which is that it is pretty much non-stop comic cuteness.  I loved the fact that each of the minions has his own name, even if I could not remember the names or really tell any of the minions apart, and it was nice to see that the two-eyed and one-eyed minions all got along with each other in complete and utter minion harmony.  This is one of those madcap movies that throws little jokes and gags in at pretty much any opportunity.  Meanwhile, the closer Gru gets to his goal of stealing the moon, the more it becomes obvious to us that the bad guy is having his heart stolen.  I had my expectations of how it would play out, and all of my guesses turned out to be wrong, and most of what directors Chris Renaud (the Oscar nominated short ""<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/No-Time-For-Nuts/dp/B000NU2TJW/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">No Time For Nuts</a>"") and Pierre Coffin (the U.K animated short ""Gary's Fall"") came up with was better.  I laughed and I cried, which is pretty much as good as it gets at the movies.

This was my first movie in digital 3D and to my surprise I survived the experience without having my head blow up like it does when I see totally hand-held camera movies like ""<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Cloverfield/dp/B0014Z4OQG/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Cloverfield</a>.""  The only downside was going out in the bright sunlight after wearing ""dark"" glasses for a couple of hours.  On the one hand I have nothing specific to which I can compare my digital 3D experience, but it was nice to actual enjoy thinking that objects were about to hit my nose as opposed to seeing a 3D move in 2D like ""<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/My-Bloody-Valentine-3D/dp/B001OQCVH4/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">My Bloody Valentine 3D</a>"" and being annoyed anytime a patently obvious 3D gimmick pops up on screen.  I guess I find the visual tricks a lot more fun in an animated film than in a horror flick.  I might be willing to try a non-animated digital 3D movie next, although those all seem to be CGI dominated films, but I guess that is to be expected.  Apparently they can turn anything into digital 3D, but I am not sure if I am ready for the technology to be applied to ""Gone with Wind,"" ""Casablanca,"" and ""Citizen Kane,"" although it cannot possibly be as bad as colorization.  Anyhow, I liked the 3D experience way more than I had anticipated and for the rest of you that went gaga over ""Avatar"" or ""Toy Story 3"" in 3D, all I can say is that my sense of wonder this time around probably made me bump the rating up higher than I might have if I had seen the movie in 2D, but it was definitely a key part of my wonderful experience today.",1278720000,35,4227,4.82825484764543
4018438,5,B002ZG97EC,So much fun...I laughed so hard!  It's very touching as well...a movie for all to see!!,1278720000,4,87,4.4375
4018439,4,B002ZG97EC,"While not quite as wondrous or challenging as a Disney/Pixar film, ""Despicable Me"" is still a lot of fun, able to make audiences laugh without having to sacrifice story or character development. It's also one of the few animated films to not entertain the idea of heroes - it merely distinguishes between evil villains and not-so-evil villains, the latter apparently capable of good deeds despite their propensity for hatching diabolical schemes. Such a person is Gru (voiced by Steve Carell), who looks like a pointy-nosed Fester Addams and speaks in a pseudo-Russian accent so delightfully phony, it only adds to his charm. His goal has always been to become the world's greatest super villain, but as the film progresses, we realize that, underneath it all, he's actually a pretty nice guy.

He certainly has the means to be a criminal mastermind; within his vast secret lair beneath his looming black house, he and the goggled Dr. Nefario (voiced by Russell Brand) have overseen the creation of ray guns that can freeze people and blow things up, vehicles that can drive on surface streets but look serious enough to drill through the Earth's crust, flying machines equipped with every missile known to man, and tiny robots disguised as chocolate chip cookies. The problem is, Gru's notoriety has been overshadowed by rival super villain Vector (voiced by Jason Siegel), who looks like Bill Gates in an orange jumpsuit and lives in an obscenely secured white fortress (surveillance cameras, hundreds of missiles, trick doors, shark-infested moats - the whole nine yards). Hoping to regain his status, Gru plots his greatest heist yet: Stealing the moon.

Of course, it will have to be shrunk to a manageable size, which is why Gru needs Vector's extra special shrink ray. Here enters three orphaned girls - Margo (voiced by Miranda Cosgrove), Edith (voiced by Dana Gaier), and Agnes (voiced by Elsie Fisher) - who get by selling boxes of cookies door to door; Gru adopts them, knowing that they can safely infiltrate Vector's fortress. What begins as a simple plan turns complicated when the girls start behaving like the children they are. They run around. They make noise. They touch things they're not supposed to touch. They always want to be read a story before going to bed. Aside from those things, they actually expect to be raised, a responsibility Gru has avoided after growing up with a sourpuss mother (voiced by Julie Andrews). Does he have it within himself to be a dad and a super villain?

Many animated films have scenes stolen by the antics of their supporting characters. ""Despicable Me"" is no exception; here, we have Gru's minions, a multitude of yellow ball-shaped one- or two-eyed creatures of unknown origin that speak fast, high-pitched gibberish and are a bit accident prone. You look at one and just can't help but want to punt it across a football field. It would probably be able to take it, judging by the hilarious physical abuse they all endure throughout the film. They're goofy, broad, and given the best sight gags, so naturally, they thoroughly upstage all the other characters every time they appear in a scene. They're even given their own epilogue segments during the end credits, which have little to do with the actual story but deftly take advantage of the film's 3-D effects.

Ah yes, the 3-D, seemingly inescapable these days. It's a process I admittedly have mixed feelings about. Sometimes is works beautifully (Disney's ""A Christmas Carol,"" ""Avatar,"" ""Alice in Wonderland""). Sometimes, it's either an unnecessary gimmick (""Clash of the Titans,"" ""My Bloody Valentine 3-D"") or a total disaster (""The Last Airbender""). I'm glad to say that it works for ""Despicable Me,"" especially during a scene at a boardwalk amusement park when Gru and the girls ride a roller coaster. There's also the moment when Gru makes an emergency landing in the middle of the street; the point of his shuttlecraft juts out from the screen, which momentarily made me think it would poke out my eye. Still, if you have the choice, go for traditional 2-D. Aside from paying less at the box office, you won't have to bother with the glasses, which can often times be a distraction.

Regardless of the dimension involved, ""Despicable Me"" is a delightful film - funny, sweet, and a triumph of animation and visual effects. Kids will enjoy it for its bright colors and physical humor, and this will almost certainly include Dr. Nefario's demonstration of a gun that emits a foul-smelling gas: ""It was supposed to be a DART gun!"" Gru exclaims in frustration. Adults will like it for its subtler touches, like a sign that reads ""The Bank of Evil (formerly Lehman Brothers)."" Everyone is sure to enjoy its good-natured spirit, especially when it's coupled with scenes of Gru's minions. Mark my words: They will be remembered long after memories of the plot have faded.",1278633600,185,4883,4.942752740560293
4018440,4,B002ZG97EC,"I'll be honest- while the commercial spots were pretty cute at first, I grew just as tired of them as most of the other people out there when they played for the millionth time. Even so, I was pretty curious- could this film live up to expectations? And what of the 3-D aspects & the child friendly aspects? More importantly... will the parents wish for a freeze ray to aim at themselves?

Steve Carell plays Gru, a supervillain who is determined to make it big. Unfortunately he's hampered by two things: one is the new supervillian Vector who foils Gru at every turn & the other is that in order to undertake his latest venture, Gru must get a loan... which he's almost immediately denied for. Gru attempts to steal a shrink ray to prove to the bank that he's no slouch, but just as it is in his grasp it is stolen by the geeky Vector. Finding no way into Vector's not so secret hideout, Gru decides to sneak his way in via three adorable little girls that he adopts with the intention of discarding once his plan is finished. What he doesn't plan on is actually falling for them.

I screened this to see if my niece would enjoy it (ok, I admit it- I was curious) & I was happy to find that the movie is actually pretty cute. The animation is nicely done & I liked Gru's interactions with the kids. Agnes has to be one of my favorite animation kids since watching Boo in Monsters Inc. Who wouldn't giggle at a little girl who mistakes cheese puffs for caterpillars & manages to dye a ferocious dog pink? The story moves along nicely & there's even a little bit of adult humor in there. (If you watch closely there's a little dig at Lehman Brothers early on in the film.) The 3-D is also nicely done- it manages to put in enough cool gimmicks to look impressive, but without overly sacrificing credibility. (Any sight gimmicks are done as part of the plot.) It isn't quite up to par with how Avatar's 3-D was, but let's face it- those are some hard shoes to fill 3-D wise.

However where the movie falls short is via the voice talent. Everyone does a decent job, but I can't help but feel like Carell was overdoing it a little with his fake Russian accent & I would have liked to have seen more Kristen Wiig. OK, not exactly a voice talent issue but she was woefully underused in this film. Plus I'm a bit miffed that you basically see most of the best parts of the movie via the commercials & video clips on the web. (Although it might be a good thing- I can watch the ""IT'S SO FLUFFY!!!"" scene again without shelling out the bucks to the theater.)

The bottom line is that this film is pretty easygoing when it comes to kids & you can rest assured that there's really no objectionable content in this movie. Parents can also breathe a sigh of relief that they'll be just as entertained. If you can, I recommend paying for the 3-D; it's worth seeing it, especially for the end credits where you get to see minion hijinks.

This might not be the best kid's film to hit the theaters this summer (nothing can really compete against Toy Story 3), but it is worth seeing.",1278633600,2,3068,4.328695652173913

4018765,4,B002ZG97EC,"Gru taps into something that is common to a lot of adults: selfishness. Yes he is a mad scientist/ evil villain, but it is precisely because hes selfish that hes relatable. Of course because this is a family movie hes buffoonish and his evil is reined in so as not to really scare or threaten the little ones. But Gru taps into something else that is not always common to adults: that children can warm a cold heart; that their willingness to love (attach) and be loved can draw those very same qualities out in others. Would that would be the case with all people, but it is not, and there are many evil Grus in this world that would do far worse than our redeemed adult does in this kids movie that adults are also sure to enjoy. Both kids and adults are going to enjoy the almost British characterizations of the villainous adults, but somehow the three little girls feel very American. The little yellow pill people, the minions, are sure to delight especially the wee little set. Their silly antics, gibberish-sounding speech, and seeming indestructibility make them lovable weirdos. For many this story of adoption will be heartwarming and adoption plays a key role in the film but true to Grus selfish nature he doesnt make a good case for adoption, its the three orphan girls who make the case as they look Gru straight in the eyes and spit or slobber their attitudes at him depending on their ages. If Gru can make room in his heart for them then so can you.",1509494400,,1467,4.49812734082397

And again a well loved series has been ruined by the necessity of milking it for all the money that can be got from it.
Without ideas, self referential, supplants plot with 'action', empty of substance from beginning to end.
Don't waste your money. Don't ruin your fond appreciation for the first two parts.

4020960,4,B002ZG97EC,This movie is very touching as it shows a different side to parenting by having Gru take care of three girls which pushes the challenge that single men cannot take care of girls because of the gender difference. In Despicable Me we see that Gru goes through a development stage throughout the movie as he is caught between work and family and constantly having one another effect each other. Grr is forced to deal with the difficulties in being a parent and trying to work at the same time. Ultimately he is faced with a decision to choose work over the children and of course he chooses the children and comes back to save them and promise to never let them go again.,1481155200,,668,4.439024390243903

4022395,5,B002ZG97EC,"I can't believe I loved this movie.  I anticipated hating it.  I thought that people that were super into Despicable Me were weird.  I thought that the mumbling minions were dumb.  I thought their association with Burger King was strange at best.  But when my 4-year-old twins wanted desperately to watch it, I finally succumbed.  And I lol'ed.  It was actually good.  Kudos, Steve Carell.  Turns out you're not the worst after all.  And Jason Segel was pretty funny as well.  Not ""This is the End"" funny, but funny nonetheless.

Here's Ebert's review.  I can't give you anything more in-depth than that.

""Despicable Me begins with the truth that villains are often more fascinating than heroes and creates a villain named Gru, who freeze-dries the people ahead of him in line at Starbucks and pops children's balloons. Although he's inspired by many a James Bond bad guy, two things set him apart: (1) His vast mad scientist lair is located not in the desert or on the moon, but in the basement of his suburban home, and (2) He dreams not of world control so much as merely dominating the cable news ratings as the Greatest Villain of All Time.

Gru is voiced by Steve Carell, who gives him an accent halfway between a Russian mafioso and a crazed Nazi. His life is made more difficult because his mother (Julie Andrews) sometimes gets on his case. Memories stir of Rupert Pupkin in his basement, yanked from his fantasies by his mother's voice. Gru's most useful weapon is the Insta-Freeze Gun, but now, with the help of his genius staff inventor Dr. Nefario (Russell Brand), he can employ a Shrink Ray.
Just as global-scale villainy is looking promising, Gru is upstaged by his archrival Vector (Jason Segel), who steals the Great Pyramid. Since that pyramid was previously pounded to pieces by the Transformers, the Egyptians should establish a CGI-free zone around it.
Gru is cheered ever onward by his faithful minions, who are, in fact, called the Minions, and look like yellow exercise balls with one or two eyes apiece. The principal responsibility of the Minions is to cheer for Gru, who addresses them as if he's running for office. He hatches a plan to use the Shrink Ray and steal no less than the moon itself, and explains it to the Minions with a plan that reminded me of nothing so much as the guy in the joke who plans to get the gorilla down out of the tree using only a broomstick, a pair of handcuffs and a savage Dalmatian dog.
To make a villain into the hero of an animated comedy is daring, but the filmmakers bring in three cute kids to restore good feelings. They are Margo (Miranda Cosgrove), Edith (Dana Gaier) and Agnes (Elsie Fisher). Gru finds them at his friendly neighborhood orphanage, run by the suspicious Miss Hattie (Kristen Wiig). His plan is to keep them at his home until his moon scheme is ready to hatch, and then use them to infiltrate Vector's home by subterfuge  pretending to sell cookies, say. It follows as the night does the day that the orphans will work their little girl magic on Gru and gradually force the revelation that the big lug has a heart, after all.
Despicable Me lacks a franchise to ride into town on, but it may establish one. I'm not sure how Gru can think up anything more sensational than stealing the moon, but I'm sure Dr. Nefario is working on that as we speak. The film is funny, energetic, teeth-gnashingly venomous and animated with an eye to exploiting the 3-D process with such sure-fire techniques as a visit to an amusement park.
The sad thing, I am forced to report, is that the 3-D process produces a picture more dim than it should be. Despicable Me is technically competent and nowhere near the visual disaster that is The Last Airbender, but take my word for it: Try to find it in 2-D. Or, if you see it in 3-D, check out the trailers online to see how bright and cheery it would look in 2-D. How can people deceive themselves that 3-D is worth paying extra for?",1472342400,,3946,4.575886524822695

4028099,5,B002ZG97EC,"Great movie for the kids, but the 3D wasn't that good.  We bought this for our new TV which has 3D (and came with glasses).  But watching the film in 3D actually hurt my eyes because the background was out of focus in order to project the 3D image.  My eyes wanted to see the main action even if not in the front, where there was focus.  So we ended up preferring the 2D DVD (which came with this).",1458172800,,398,4.0

Now as a mom my goal is to have entertaining yet clean and fun movies for my kid. I try to avoid  violence which is nearly impossible. Now there is a little freeze ray action but not nearly as much what to expect with other super hero movies.

Now I love Despicable Me, my family loves Despicable me, you will love it too!",1457913600,2,564,4.109090909090909

4030061,4,B002ZG97EC,"In a world where minions have reached great popularity, this film - presuming you're reading this because you haven't seen it yet - is pretty light on the yellow fellows. In fact, their moderate appearance in this original film, combined with their cuteness, is probably what led to the eventual minion craze. It leaves you wanting more of everyone.
And the little buggers are adorable! But there is much more to love about this film - the thorough humor, the Bond-esque riffs, and ultimately, the at-risk relationship between Gru and the girls make it much more than a lark. This film has more depth than it seems - not unlike ""The Office"" TV Series from which it borrows its famous schnoz. Well played, all.",1453680000,7,709,4.725806451612903

It takes a lot to make me laugh nearly to tears, but there were a couple of wonderful scenes in this piece that almost took me even farther, if you know what I mean?!

I enjoyed this so much that I purchased a ""Kyle"" doll for my cat's cat tree.  When my dog saw it, he decided it was the best toy ever, so I ended up purchasing a second, just for him!

Normally, I like gritty, real-life dramas, such as Breaking Bad, but this was an oasis of fun in a world all-too-full of darkness!",1452384000,5,613,3.9836065573770494

 It really is a funny movie that even I enjoyed watching.

 We saw it at the library once and since then my kids have been begging me for a copy for it for our home.

 I was thrilled to find this and got it as a stocking stuff for for them.

 There are some very funny parts in this movie that always make me chuckle.

And then there's the Minions. Cute little critters that seem to live in the moment and who are always there for their friends. Since this movie came out, Minion-Fever has taken the country by storm and I can see why... they just plain make you laugh and see little pieces of yourself in them at times.

This is a favorite of my whole household - from my 4 yr old granddaughter to her 87 yr old Great Grandfather. Fun for the whole family!",1449446400,,711,4.338345864661654

I did allow my kids to watch it but even though they thought it was funny. They were not comfortable with the crudeness and extreme hate/violence at the end. They prefer the first two movies to this one. They love the minions but the plot, crude jokes, and the villains actions and demeanor was what caused them to lean away. A bit much for a kids movie.",1443312000,,487,4.48314606741573

4034706,5,B002ZG97EC,"Released in 2010, Despicable Me is an animated film about a strange eccentric, Gru, who wants to be the greatest villain on earth. His newest heist is to steal the moon, which is hampered by his annoying rival, Vector. To accomplish his goal, Gru adopts three girls from a local orphanage who have an unexpected impact on his nefarious goals and motives.

This is a great cartoon movie for the same reasons The Grinch Who Stole Christmas is so great: Its consistently amusing  and sometimes laugh-out-loud funny  and its also a tale of redemption. The story reveals why Gru turned out the way he did; all he needed was a little affirmation and someone to open his heart. On top of this, the Minions are great.

The movie runs 95 minutes.

Personally, it's a least favorite, because everyone in this story, with the execption of Agnes, is horrible to every other character. It stopped being funny after a while. Half way into it, I began to think the movie was meant for preparing children for how horrible people are to each other. The are funny moments, and heartwarming moments that you can see clming from a mile away, but overall, it's a pretty dismal sense of humor, and one I wouldn't recommend for kids.

As an adult (64 years plus) I enjoyed the story line.  So if you are an adult go ahead and watch the movie and enjoy.

In a few days I will watch Despicable Me 2 in 3D and hopefully I will just as pleased.  I have already placed my pre-order for the Minions 3D movie with Amazon.

One recommendation I have is to continue to watch the movie through the credits.",1438041600,2,570,4.18348623853211

4037723,5,B002ZG97EC,"More than a kid's movie!  The plot it somewhat predictable (hey, it IS a kid's movie) but it's well done, with a lot of humor for adults. I have never loved a ""villain"" so much, particularly after the coffee house scene. And the Minions. If nothing else, returning that word to popular usage makes it worthy of at least three stars. Now referring to someone as a minion takes on an entirely different meaning! The Minionese was a little distracting, as you can ALMOST decipher (or think you can) words here and there, which might be why some people are saying the Minions have potty mouths (i.e. the McDonalds uproar).  I don't think they were cussing, but they might well have been naughty here and there. This movie will strike a lot of chords with young and old.

We break up the serious reflections of life's experience, or the action packed thrillers, with movies that will be simply entertaining.  We found ""Despicable Me"" to be completely enjoyable at multiple levels.  As the reason behind the black heart of the evil villain is revealed he becomes a sympathetic character and as the movie progresses the main character warms to humanity and is redeemed.  The antics of the villain's helpers, the minions, are both hilarious and emotional.  As innocent evil-doers, the minions are perhaps even more fun than the arch-villain himself.  This movie is fun and touching to watch from our experienced perspective. This movie is a great find.  (... as is the sequel, ""Despicable Me II,"" which we have also watched.)  Streaming from Amazon was a cinch, by the way - very easy.",1436659200,2,905,4.947019867549669

4037933,4,B002ZG97EC,"Utterly adorable and with good morals.  It drops a star for the scene where the little girl holds her breath to get her own way, but that's because I think it will give some children of an impressionable age the wrong ideas.  The minions are so charming it's hard not to wish they were in every animated film.  Carrell does a great job voicing the villainous Gru, who isn't nearly as bad as he'd like to be.  The animation is so slick and seamless that one now takes for granted how much work goes into scenes of spraying water and disco lights.  The ode to Saturday Night Fever was one of the most entertaining scenes and the minions, not unlike The Muppets are capable of doing comical things the kids will laugh at, but also slipping in humor the adults will like - all without going over the line for a family audience.  Brilliant stuff!",1436572800,5,841,4.393548387096774
