5185273,4,B008VL07NU,Good family viewing and very appropriate for celebrating Christmas. I liked this presentation because it is an appropriate viewing I can enjoy with my grandchildren.,1356566400,2,165,5.64

5185275,5,B008VL07NU,"The account of the birth of Jesus is told in its integrity, since the Annunciation to the Scape to Egypt, in language that is expected to reached from the youngest to the oldest, form those who are learning to those who are already well educated.
Morgan Freeman added a very special touch of sweetness and resolution to the account of the birth of Jesus, with his vibrating intonation.
I recommend to those parents and educators who are looking for a video to present to their children the account of the birth of Jesus, with doctrinal righteousness in Christian and Catholic faith.
Peace and blessings.",1388966400,,603,4.8076923076923075
5185276,5,B008VL07NU,There is still nothing like Rabbit Ears. Treat your children to nourishing storytelling and enriching music and art. Quietly touches the soul in a way most media misses. Streep reads the poetry with heart -- very worthwhile work!,1388880000,,229,5.052631578947368
5185277,1,B008VL07NU,We shut if off cause it was so boring. I love Morgan freedman. But this movie was putting us to sleep...,1388361600,,104,4.0
5185278,4,B008VL07NU,You will enjoy this.  A retelling of the Christ story by Morgan Freeman with the peaceful music of a heavanly choir.,1388102400,5,116,4.523809523809524
5185279,5,B008VL07NU,"And... if you're going to have the best story ever told, hear it from Morgan Freeman.  I could listen to Morgan Freeman rattle off random ingredients.  His voice is so soothing.  Anyway, this story is great.  My SS class enjoyed watching it and hearing it.",1387152000,,256,4.622222222222222
5185280,5,B008VL07NU,"This 27 minute short film tells the story of the birth of Jesus read by Morgan Freeman while showing stained glass art to aid the story. The story is told well and listening to Morgan Freeman's voice is very relaxing as you watch the colorful, and slightly animated stained glass artwork. I watched it twice within 3 days.",1386979200,,322,4.568965517241379
5185281,5,B008VL07NU,"I like Morgan Freeman, and he did a great job of telling the story.  I've listened to it a couple of times already.",1386547200,,115,4.0
5185282,3,B008VL07NU,I don't think it is the product or me.  I think we just weren't meant for each other.  I bought this because I am a huge fan of both Jesus and Morgan Freeman and figured the combination would be interesting.,1362182400,2,207,4.15
5185283,3,B008VL07NU,Wanted a video to watch with the family at Christmas. Adults enjoyed it. Kids did not seem to enjoy 30 minutes of pictures of stained glass windows though.,1361923200,,155,4.571428571428571
8530979,5,B008VL07NU,"the stop motion animation via stained glass images is absolutely glorious, buy it for that reason alone if nothing else as there is nothing else in that genre out there. Think of Nick Park animation has a revelation!",1509580800,,216,4.7105263157894735
8530980,5,B008VL07NU,Great dvd!,1482192000,,10,4.5

8530983,3,B008VL07NU,"It was okay, and while it had the basic story line, I was a little disappointed in it.  The quotes from the Bible when the angel Gabriel announced to Mary that she would be the mother of the Son of God were paraphrased enough that I felt it left a little to be desired.  It's safe for family viewing, but I prefer the versions that warm my soul and really help me remember the true meaning of Christmas.",1434412800,,403,4.153846153846154

8530985,4,B008VL07NU,"It kept my two children interested for the duration of the video, that's saying something since there wasn't any animation involved. The art  work is basic but good. The narration by Morgan Freeman is outstanding.",1420070400,,213,5.085714285714285
8530986,5,B008VL07NU,"This is an excellent version of the Nativity Story for families. The art work is inspired and the music is beautiful.
Add this to your Christmas video collection!",1419984000,,162,4.821428571428571
8530987,4,B008VL07NU,Great retling of the Christmas story,1419465600,,36,5.166666666666667
8530988,5,B008VL07NU,"Almost entirely Bible quotes, respectful but emotional reading by Mr. Freeman, images are all the same stained glass style as the image.  Very little movement, other than panning out or changing images.

My five year old is entranced, and my three year old has only gotten distracted twice so far; even the toddler is kind of watching.  I think we're going to be streaming this every weekend until Christmas. (Yay, Prime!)",1417910400,2,422,4.915492957746479
