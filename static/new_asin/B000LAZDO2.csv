8160601,3,B000LAZDO2,"I got one tip out of the entire DVD. It is NOT an encyclopedia by all means and perhaps should rename the book. I was looking for more of a list of different flowers etc., not how to plant them.",1374105600,,194,3.875

8160604,5,B000LAZDO2,"This DVD was purchased for a 14 year old ""budding"" horticulturist.  He is delighted in the amount of information it contains and the topics it covers.
Not only does it describe a multitude of plants, it also explains the care that should be given to ensure a healthy garden.  He was very pleased that it covered the topic of pruning, which is an important issue. This is definitely a reference tool that will be used over and over again.",1269043200,8,437,4.518987341772152
