1671642,2,B00005V4XK,Van Damme is not the best actor we have and he needs a good cast to make a movie this has no other stars and the story is boring not his best not even good enough to call his movie to me just skip it,1019433600,,199,3.4444444444444446
1671643,2,B00005V4XK,"Van Damme is growing older while his movie budget continues to shrink.  The fake CGI fire scenes are hysterical, as are the dark action sequences where nothing is visible except a few punches and the sound of several groans.
I'm surprised at the decline, and always remain hopeful Van Damme can make a comeback and convince a studio to finance a theatrical release.  Until that time, the direct to video ... stream remains steady and constant....",1019260800,2,446,4.855263157894737
1671644,2,B00005V4XK,"I could not wait for this DVD to arrive. After how good Van Damme's pairing with director Sheldon Lettich went on WRONG BET (Lionheart) and DOUBLE IMPACT, I had high hopes for THE ORDER. But after only a short time of watching my heart sunk and I realised it was going to be like most his other recent films. Van Damme's charm as a person just didn't come through and they  didn't exploit his skills as a fighter either.
I just assumed after Sheldon Lettich's last efforts that the fights would be at least as well shot, well choreographed and well slow-mo'd as DOULBE IMPACT and WRONG BET. But no. What is it about late 90's and early 2000 action films!!! They just don't seem to be able to make a well structured, well paced, good old simple action film anymore(not including the obvious good few that have slipped in).
I like to look at it this way. If you compare the final fight scene in DOUBLE IMPACT (between Van Damme and Bolo Yeung) with the final fight in THE ORDER, DOUBLE IMPACT's fight has them taking off their tops and comparing muscles (basicly), then they start with a few hits and jabs and such, with heaps of slow-mo, then they slowly amp up to Van Damme's comeback with 4 heli-copter kicks, all in ultra slow-mo, and the fight just makes you feel real cool and pumped up, and excited for his character, and because it's all been shot so clearly, you can really follow the fight and see whats happening. But in THE ORDER, the fight comes in fits and starts with no real structure, and no real use of Van Damme's skills, and very few defining moments, where you go ""man that was cool!"", it's sort of understated and unsatisfying. Which I find so surprising, considering SHELDON LETTICH is so capable at action. Maybe it's the editors fault aswell. Cause it doesn't have any of the triple cuts (showing the same move lots of times from different angles) like WRONG BET (Lionheart) had.
As far as the plot goes, I think that's really irrelevant in a Van Damme film, really the plot is just a vehicle to get from one action set piece to another and in that sense it's fine. But it isn't very funny and he doesn't really have any one-liners either.
To summarise, I just wish VAN DAMME would get back to basics and do a solid action film. We know he can fight and he's proved his ""versatile"" acting skills in REPLICANT, now he just needs a good plot vehicle, a good director (John Woo again would be cool) and a good editor, then maybe he could produce what myself and many other Van Damme fans are waiting for. A good old 80's style, well paced, ""make you wanna do jummp kicks after watching it"" ACTION film!",1017705600,6,2622,4.428571428571429

1671662,4,B00005V4XK,"I actually purchased this after beginning to watch an incredibly edited ad-laden version of it on one of those free movie channels via internet. Note, I began watching it FREE, then decided to actually buy it instead. It's that darn good!

Never have I been so impressed with Van Damme's acting! He's always depended on his martial artistry skills from the very beginning of his career - and this? Surprise!

The man can act. No kidding, he can actually act!

Yeah, yeah yeah, it's a stretch for the storyline and all, plus the bad guy is that particularly craggy-featured cat who everyone recognizes but no one knows what the heck is his name. But he is, after all, that proverbial bad guy who is enormous and nuts just by the way he appears! In real life, he's probably a teddy bear who makes his wife breakfast in bed every morning, but I'm talking about the cast briefly here...more later. What IS his name anyway?

Too bad there wasn't an ounce of media exposure to this flick over a decade ago when it was released - gee, I would've gone to the theater to see it...even though I don't do movie theaters anymore!

Now to the cast! And what a cast! Sofia Milos, Ben Cross, and hey now folks...Charleton Heston? I mean, Charleton Heston!! Sure, he was in a short part of the film, but hey, he was even intrigued enough to appear in this surprisingly good movie! Charleton Heston!! I mentioned he appeared in this movie already. I digress.

So, once again, I disagree with the masses. I say this movie is well worth renting at the very, very least. However, I love to have evidence when I deem things worthwhile...and Van Damme gave a heckuva performance, folks. Minor and extraordinarily well-executed action sequences by JCVD, appropriately placed no less, along with some bits of humor that allows additional insight into JCVD the man! Wow! Color me shocked! Maybe he isn't actually so full of himself he'll pop someday?? One can only hope; the comic sequences were absolutely at his cost. I like him better now. I only appreciated his skills before...now? I like him. A little.

So, for the sake of posterity and the wonderful surprise when opening this particular gift box of a video a la Jean-Claude's heretofore unknown (at least to me) acting ability? I say 10 bucks is worth owning it. Well worth it. I do!

JCVD...well done!

Be well, all.",1347321600,,2351,4.645783132530121
1671663,4,B00005V4XK,".Van-Damme actually shows his acting skills, not just his kick boxing side. Who knew he could act. Maybe his appearance in the second Expendables will bring him back to the big screen instead of shot to video like he's been doing. but about this movie, his father his kidnapped, friends are killed or taken, and he's being thrown out of Israel because he's an antiquities thief. He's aided by a woman from the police force, of course, and eventually find out what a cult with connections everywhere is up to, and that's to start a holy war, as if one doesn't exist already. All in all, it's a good way to spend the evening. I recommend it if you just want fun and not a message",1340150400,,677,4.380952380952381
1671664,4,B00005V4XK,"You know, it irks me when Jean-Claude Van Damme goes on nowadays about how dissatisfied he's been with his career. Can't he see how fun his direct-to-video stuff like ""The Order"" was? Maybe Van Damme's just eager for something straight and serious at this point in his life, but I really appreciate the creativity the low-budget realm afforded his movies. Coupled with his luck in snagging directors who make the most of limited resources, he's had more to celebrate for this stage of his career than Seagal or Lundgren, and while ""The Order"" is not a flawless movie, it has the energy and originality to make for a worthwhile 90-minute time-waster, definitely.

The story: Rudy Cafmeyer (Van Damme) is a professional thief whose father (Vernon Dobtcheff,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Undisputed-III-Redemption/dp/B003FXXNH6/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Undisputed III: Redemption</a>) goes missing while studying an ancient Templar sect in Jerusalem. In pursuit, Rudy will need to engage a religious fanatic determined to initiate an act of international terrorism (Brian Thompson,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Cobra/dp/6304779607/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Cobra</a>).

Director Sheldon Lettich had done good work with Van Damme throughout his mainstream career, and their chemistry carries over to this feature. Generally, ""The Order"" looks way more professional than a lot of other DTV flicks from the same period. It also packs more action than the norm: six hand-to-hand fights, three car chases, and one surprisingly good on-foot chase. It's clearly a stunt double riding the motorcycle and performing some of the gymnastics, but otherwise, Van Damme seems to be supplying his own moves. His fistfights are all pretty good, but I wish his showdown with fellow action guy Brian Thompson was a bit more satisfying: though it's one of the rare instances wherein Van Damme wields a sword, the fight's not quite as long or climatic as the film warranted.

Speaking of swords, the movie's notable for featuring a few things you can't see in any of Jean-Claude's other features. Religious-themed pictures in general were a first for Van Damme - lagging behind&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Schwarzenegger/dp/6305767866/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Schwarzenegger</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Lundgren/dp/B00008L3S7/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Lundgren</a>&nbsp;- but it's disappointing that he goes all the way to Jerusalem without really addressing the real-life events of the area. The movie opens with a dramatic narrative and a historical flashback (here's your chance to see Van Damme playing a Crusader) and closes with a Jackie Chan-esque blooper reel, neither of which are quite as entertaining as they ought to be but still pretty novel. At one point, Van Damme's character goes incognito as a Haredi Jew, complete with beard. Most significantly, however, is the casting of Charlton Heston (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Ben-Hur/dp/B0009UZG1O/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Ben-Hur</a>). With the possible exception of Forest Whittaker in&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Bloodsport/dp/B00006RCOC/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Bloodsport</a>, Heston is the single most acclaimed actor to appear in a Van Damme film, with the added gravity of this being his last live-action feature to see wide release before his death. (SPOILER) His scenes are isolated to the first half of the film and his character's death is disappointing, but it's still oddly satisfying to see him and Van Damme interact with ease. There's a bit of Heston's characteristic fire in his delivery, but the only action he gets in on is smacking a thug with his cane.

Brian Thompson's character could have definitely used more screentime, but at least he made room for Sofia Milos (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/CSI-Miami/dp/B000H7JCEG/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">CSI: Miami</a>) to pursue Jean-Claude for the majority of the movie, which ended up persevering beyond its faults and being pretty darn fun. Cinema snobs needn't bother, but Van Damme fans should welcome this to the man's filmography. Get it, action fans.",1323648000,2,4402,6.44331641285956
1671665,3,B00005V4XK,"Released in time for Christmas in 2001,this Jean Claude van Damme movie,co-written by JCVD,has high production values,a nice plot and some solid supporting acting from its co stars to make this film an above average romp for the Muscles from Brussels.
The story revolves around one Rudy Cafmeyer,a full time and successful thief who is trying to steal a Faberge egg worth millions. He gets away but barely. He next visits his father who is a museum curator dealing in antiquities. When he leaves his father begs him to call that evening. Rudy goes to some contacts to pawn his precious egg off but it gets broken in a scuffle and he lands in jail. Out on bail he gets a frantic call from his father from Israel,who begs him for help.
Rudy flies to Israel and is greeted by a an old friend of his fathers Prof. Finlay(Charlton Heston).His father has been kidnapped for an ancient map he had in his possession containing the whereabouts of a secret passage underneath the ancient city of Jerusalem .The kidnappers are of an ancient religious order that now want to create anarchy and a holy war by blowing up the third most holiest of all Muslim temples of worship. Rudy has not only this sect to contend with but the police whose head Ben Nerr(Ben Cross)doesn;t believe his story and wants him out of the country. Rudy leads them all on a merry chase through the back streets of the old city but ends up getting shot. A police woman befriends Rudy,helps him recover and with another friend infiltrates the sect itself.
During a clandestine meeting of the Order Rudy decides to investigate the old catacombs beneath the city. He finds his father but they are both caught and forced to lead the way to the secret area where a load of explosives will be detonated and the so called war will begin. Of course Rudy has other plans and ultimately,after many tense moments,he is able to foil the plot. Back home with his father at the museum Rudy asks what a certain old document is and is told to leave it alone,as it is valuable. This is how things started out the first time around but this time Rudy sneaks out the door with the document in his hand,as we hear his father shouting after him.
This movie has few slow spots and moves along at a good clip. There are plenty of action scenes mixed with both serious and humorous moments to keep ones interest throughout. Of course Van Damme is in good form and his outstanding moment,doing what he does best,is a high spread kick shot getting two on either side simultaneously. The film was shot on actual location in the city of Jerusalem(and the surrounding countryside)in both the Muslim and Christian side. Director Sheldon Lettich uses a deft touch in his directing duties,not too light a hand nor too heavy.
Technically speaking this DVD is issued in both widescreen and full screen. The w/s version is clear and crisp and the sound is quite good;no complaints.
All in all an above average Van Damme entry with a compelling storyline that keeps you watching from beginning to end. Recommended.",1317340800,,3041,4.633333333333334
1671666,3,B00005V4XK,"The Jean Claude Van Damme Review Matrix (JCVD-RM)

1. Who is he? He's Charles Le Vaillant, a medieval knight who, in his later years where he resembles Moses, creates a Middle Eastern religious order comprised of Christians, Jews, and Muslims; and eventually, he becomes Rudy Cafmeyer, an amateur Indiana Jones, a smuggler whose father is an archaeologist.
2. Which family member/friend must be avenged? After that intro, I'm not quite sure.
3. Does he take his shirt off? With only a few seconds to spare
4. Does he have sex with a C-List actress? Nope, but there is tension
5. Is there a tournament? No tournament
6. Is training needed for this tournament?  Just a viewing of the Indiana Jones series (excluding the travesty with Shia LaBeouf) and a King Arthur movie oughta do it.
7. Does he do the splits in training or in the tournament? There are several kicks of the upside-down T variety.
8. Does he punch someone in the balls?  A short jab ends one man's family tree.
9. Does he do a series of flying or 360 kicks? The man's still got it!  He even unleashes a new flying split kick that dispatches to enemies
10. Is his enemy unbeatable? Dan Brown would be a better person to ask, because I'm sure the Illuminati is involved in this somehow
11. Does he overcome an injury or other hindrance? Just the script and the music
12. Does he win? I think so.

Instead of ""The Order,"" this movie should have been titled ""The Ordeal,"" because that's what it is.  With JCVD as co-writer, cohesion is thrown completely out the window.  Religion and Ramadan, a prophecy from&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Cobra-s/dp/6304779607/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Cobra's</a>&nbsp;Night Slasher and a cameo from Sean Connery, a treasure hunt and JCVD as a Hasidic Jew, secret caves and stolen artifacts - this movie is all over the treasure map, and I'm not sure anyone gets richer as a result.  Exacerbating the problem is one of the worst musical scores I have ever heard.  Only a tone deaf moron with no concept of cinematic timing could have contrived this complete distraction.  Add in some very bad gun-fights and poorly framed car chases, and the world is on JCVD's shoulders and his fight sequences; they're good, but even Atlas shrugs.

The religious overtones are tolerable at best, and nauseatingly moronic at worst.  There was an attempt to build some ""Da Vinci Code""-esque background, but it the mystery unravels before it begins.  The rest of the religion and meshing of cultures is understandably inserted, but nearly inconsequential to the plotline, and serve no other purpose than allow everyone a view of significant landmarks.

This goes down as one of the five least enjoyable JCVD flicks, but it's still the only one in which Van Damme has a Excalibur style sword-fight, sees Temple Mount and the Western Wall, kisses Sofia Milos, and engages in chase scenes so campy that I started humming Yakety Sax.",1251331200,,2954,4.9534412955465585
1671667,3,B00005V4XK,"Sheldon Lettich directed.  He's also worked with Van Damme on films like ""Double Impact"" & ""Hard Cops.""  The script loosely makes sense, although tying the egg opening to the later events in Israel boils down to a fence in Tel Aviv.  Jean Claude plays Rudy Cafmeyer who is a smuggler and thief.  While he may be a criminal, he's still Jean Claude Van Damme and the star of this movie; so we like him.  The fight sequences play well with Van Damme as a better-looking Jason Statham.  Vernon Dobtchoff plays Rudy's father Oscar who goes to Israel, gets kidnapped and therefore must be rescued.  He does a good job of looking old & grizzly and moans a lot.  As the action shifts to Israel, Van Damme is met by Professor Walter Finley, played by Charlton Heston.  Heston has a presence that briefly enhances the film.  Based on the actor's personal life, it is ironic that he gets shot.  Ben Cross whose first film was the Oscar-winning ""Chariots of Fire"" plays the corrupt police chief Ben Ner.  Cross brings intensity to a thinly written role.  Brian Thompson who won Razzie nominations as worst actor for a Stallone flick looks intimidating as the religious cult leader Cyrus Jacob who on behalf of God wants to start World War III.  Sofia Milos played for two seasons on TV's ""CSI Miami"" & gives what is really a good performance as Lt. Dalia Barr.  Her Mediterranean good looks and ability to play action as well as emotion make her stand out.  The ending credits play a keystone cops soundtrack as we see some outtakes from the action sequences.

I think maybe some of it would make a 10-13 year old laugh, and while the movie is rated R there is no bad language and nothing more than people getting punched in the face.  So don't be afraid to let your youngster see this.

The action is o.k. and the plot is weak.  While if you're looking to collect every Jean-Claude Van Damme film out there this review probably won't stop you from buying this.

If you want Van Dammes best acting DON'T start here; go watch In Hell, Wake of Death, Lionheart, or maybe Timecop for that.  For his action/martial arts skills this isn't a bad place to go.  It has quite a few good action scenes in it. Van Damme is always cool as hell and has some good lines.  The ending is also pretty good as well. With the ending you get Van Dammes best kick(jumps and glides) out of all his movies he has ever done, even at his older age. The movie as a whole isn't nowhere near as bad as a lot of people think.

In short, the acting and the dialogues are extremely weak (Van Damme and Charlton Heston really disappoint with their performances!), while the plot and the setting, are actually very good, therefore, the potential for a great movie was definitely there if only the actors and writers could... act and write!
As for the rating, if you're going to have it rated R at least give it the sex and/or the violence.  If not, give it the proper rating i.e. PG-13.

The acting is not great, Vanne Damma plays the same ol' charactor he usualy does. Nothing different or uniueqe about his charactor; neat, knows how to fight, is real assure of himself, and can not be beaton one on one.

No one seems to convince me they are Muslim or Isrealian, there American & Engish accent slip through too often over a very bad attempt at trying to sound like there supposed to be.

The Belgian actor has always relied on his physical presence and kickboxing action to fill theatres or rent movies.  In THE ORDER, he tries a more comic approach, in his attempts to locate his missing archaeologist father and a rare religious document.  Brian Thompson has an uninspired role as Cyrus, the leader of a distaff cult of the Order, hence the title of this movie.  There are some fun kickboxing scenes; the car chases are bland compared to those orchestrated by John Woo; and Sofia Milos is attractive as the lady cop who joins van Damme in his quest.  I agree that Charlton Heston should have played the father; he's wasted in a cameo role.  Pino Donaggio (Carrie, Dressed to Kill) does a nice score for the movie.

Rudy Cafmeyer (Jean-Claude Van Damme) is an international artifacts smuggler whose father is a well known museum curator. When Rudy's father (Vernon Dobtcheff) goes missing mysteriously in Israel, Rudy embarks on a quest to find him.  The end result is a confrontation with a lovely Israeli police officer named Dalia (Sofia Milos), the loss of a couple friends and being wrapped up in a religious conspiracy involving a strange middle eastern cult and a cultist (Brian Thompson) with nefarious plans.

About the Movie:
If you're looking for a well written, well thought out, well acted action flick, this isn't really it.  But really, are we surprised? It has Van Damme in it.

In fact, The Order is something of a rip-off of the Indiana Jones movies.  You have the archeologist father who goes missing, a son looking for him, a weird religious cult, and a lost religious treasure . . .  Nothing new here, well, except for maybe the martial arts element.

But it's not all bad, making up for a silly, clich&eacute;d and completely unoriginal plot by having a few very enjoyable moments.  Van Damme is an entertaining martial artist and while his fight scenes aren't as flamboyant or entertaining as, say, Jackie Chan's, he holds his own quite well.  Van Damme even gets to engage in a sword fight in this movie, which is probably the first time I've seen him do that.  I bet you can't guess who wins it.

The best scene in this movie, partly because the musical score adds so much to it, is the one where Van Damme is masquerading as a Hasidic Jew, with a beard, hat and curly hair, then has to run from the police through the middle of crowded Jerusalem.  There's something very goofy about the whole sequence that makes it quite comic and a lot of fun to watch.

Charleton Heston has a cameo in this movie as well, both as the narrator of the opening teaser and in a role later on. Unfortunately, it has him dying rather senselessly in the first 3rd of the movie, wasting the talents of a great and notable actor. It would have been wonderful if Charleton could have played the role of Van Damme's father instead of Vernon Dobtcheff (who's put on accent was atrocious).  Heston's such a solid actor, it was disappointing that he didn't have a more significant role.

The acting in this movie isn't great. Even Heston's role is a bit on the stagey side.  And of course, Van Damme will never win any awards for HIS acting.  But this isn't a movie you watch for the acting, and a lot can be forgiven since the attractive Sofia Milos plays the female lead and incidentally is probably the strongest actor in the film.

One strong point of this movie is the musical score (arranged by Pino Donaggio). It isn't on the level of top notch movie, but it's possibly better than many action movies have, blending humor and a real feel for its subject matter into what is at times, a masterful addition to the action sequences.

Overall, this is a brainless, sit down and have fun type of movie. There's certainly quite a few martial arts action movies of this type out there that beat this one hands down, but The Order has its high points and could be a lot worse.

About the DVD:
The Order comes in a plastic hard case on a double sided DVD with both fullscreen and widescreen versions in Dolby Digital 5.1 sound. It has not been translated into any other languages besides its original English, though it does contain English and French subtitles.  Both the video and audio transfer appear to be very good. Even on a high resolution screen, the video had only a little grain and few artifacts.

As far as special features, this movie has none except for three theatrical trailers, two being for other movies.  It also has scene selections, though I don't count that as a special feature.  Overall, this is a very basic, no frills DVD release.

Bottom Line: A unoriginal but somewhat entertaining film on a budget DVD release. 3 Stars.",1073865600,15,3939,4.600858369098712
1671677,2,B00005V4XK,"By now, looking for a well-written coherent plot in a Jean-Claude Van Damme film is a bit like seeking the Holy Grail.  The Order, insures that the quest will continue.
This time, Van Damme is Rudy Cafmeyer, jewel thief and smuggler.  When his father, an archeologist, disappears in Jerusalem, with an ancient scroll, Rudy is off to the Holy Land to discover his fate.  Before too long, Rudy has left a trail of destruction that has the police firmly agitated.  Police Lt. Dalia Barr (Sofia Milos from TV's CSI Miami) is assigned to watch over Rudy, and before long, they are teamed in the quest to discover the secret plans of a mysterious religious sect known as ""The Order"".
The screenplay co-written by Van Damme, has massive credibility issues and many logical flaws.  Rudy more than once, exhibits a remarkable ability to heal at a superhuman rate.  How many undiscovered underground treasure chambers are there left in the world, especially one that is so conveniently well lighted?  Credibility of course, is not the major reason to see a Van Damme film, and the action scenes in this one are not bad.  His trademark kickboxing is frequently on display, and for the finale, Jean-Claude does battle with a broadsword.  Overall, this average Van Damme film, is a slightly below average action adventure.
Charlton Heston contributes a crusty cameo, and some voice over work as well.  Cyrus, the renegade leader of the Order, is your stereotypical religious zealot, and is played by the numbers by Brian Thompson.  Ben Cross appears to be close to scraping bottom here, as a corrupt cop.
The Order starts out with some promise, but soon begins to unravel.  Van Damme, will probably never be taken seriously as an actor.  Often his most humorous lines occur when uttering a profanity.  Jean-Claude still has some physical skills, and is capable of better work, however unless he gets finds quality material, his fans will be continuing the quest.",1072569600,3,1949,4.902439024390244

1671679,3,B00005V4XK,"The Order sees Jean Claude Van Damme venturing into Israel in search of his father ,an academic who holds the key to a priceless treasure and who thereby comes into conflict with an extreme Christian  sect whose design is to unleash a major religious conflict with other faiths in pursuit of their ideals. He is well qualified for the task being a dab hand at martial arts and has skills derived from his ""profession"" as a burglar specialising in stealing museum treasures.
He is soon involved in car chases ,gunfights and fights including one lengthy sequence where he repels police and irate locals in the marketplace while dressed as an Hassidic jew. It all build to an explosive climax deep underground where the bad guys are intent on blowing uo the Temple in Jerusalem.
Striking location photography and lively action setpieces are  distinct plus points which offsets some fairly routine acting .
Potential viewers lured by the presence of Charlton Heston should be advised he makes only a cameo appearance and is killed early in proceedings

1671690,3,B00005V4XK,"THE ORDER sees the reteaming of action star Jean-Claude Van Damme and director Sheldon Lettich (LIONHEART, DOUBLE IMPACT).
Van Damme plays Rudy Calmeyer, the son of an archeologist who has in his possession a rare scroll that belongs to an obsessive religious sect (No, its not the SPCS) who have a creative name like The Children Of God or something along those lines. Naturally the ""COG"" want the scroll back so they kidnap Calmeyer's dad and take him to their compound in Israel. But of course they hadn't counted on messing with Jean-Claude, who sets off on a mission to rescue his father  administering various butt-kickings along the way.  Calmeyer is also fortunate enough to have the assistance of a sexy Israeli cop, Dalla (Sofia Milos). But as with all looney cults there are ulterior motives involved: like creating a devastating bomb.
Thankfully I can't say the same about the movie, which features plenty of action, stunts and martial arts sequences which make THE ORDER easily the best Van Damme since MAXIMUM RISK. It's just sad that his movies get released direct to video now, as Jean Claude is in good form here and the story which he co-wrote is actually pretty good (esp.when compared to THE QUEST). Charlton Heston's role, in which he gets second billing is in actual fact really nothing more than an extended cameo. There's also some rather clumsy humor, a good example would be early in the movie where Van Damme steals a priceless egg from a museum but is caught by security guards. On hearing their warning shots the guy who is guiding him via radio asks ""Was that a gunshot?"" to which Van Damme replies ""No, I farted"". Somehow I don't think someone like say, Steven Seagal would be able to play scenes like this and get the intended laughs. Jean- Claude's back on top of his game with this one. Lets hope he can show action fans (and Hollywood) what he's really capable of.",1051574400,3,1899,4.716867469879518
1671691,3,B00005V4XK,"Director Sheldon Lettich and Jean-Claude Van Damme are reunited in ""The Order,"" a silly action movie that, despite a nice budget, went direct-to-video because, let's face it, Van Damme just can't get a box-office grab like he could with ""Timecop"" and ""Universal Soldier."" But the film looks nicely polished and it's pretty short, with action scenes kept to a maximum, just the way I like it. The plot is ridiculous, but most of JCVD's films are. This one has him travelling to Israel, I think, and doing battle with a cult that wants to destroy him and his father. Not a complete failure for Van Damme.",1045267200,,602,4.688679245283019
1671692,4,B00005V4XK,"IN this movie Jean-Claude seems to have taken a different approach,which is a good thing and he needed to do it really. Instead of the usual moody same moves different haircut and cheesey dialog ,he has attempted to play a slightly comic character,who is a bit of a rogue and a bit of joker. Ok so he is no comedy genius,but the change works. He also meets up with a sexy feisty female cop who proves to be engaging and i thought looked slighly like madonna(a good thing).The plot revolves around his father's involvement with ancient artifacts and a mysterious cult etc but the locations look good and the action and fight sequences are nice and fast moving and energetic. Also,brilliantly there seems to be no sign of slow-motion repeating spinning kicks to the head that Jean-claude's previous movies seemed to make a cliche. So he needed to do something different. Legionnare didn't work,i would say this does. But bear in mind this reviewer is an on/off Van Damme fan.",1030579200,4,973,4.729411764705882

1671695,5,B00005V4XK,"Van Damme stars as a thief and a wayward son of an archeologist who gets kidnapped while in Israel. It is up to Van Damme to save his father and prevent ""world war 3"" That's the story in a nutshell. It's too complicated for me to go into in great detail. But trust me you'll enjoy it. I resisted renting this film for a long time, but once I sat down to watch it, I found that I  loved it. Great plot, great story and great acting. It also showed me a great view of Israel. There's also a lot of great humour in this. One thing I like about Van Damme (he partly wrote the script) is that he always makes sure his characters are more fleshed out less one dimensional.
It really is too bad that Jean-Claude's career took such a turn for the worse. How someone like him is stuck doing video now. And other less talented  ""stars"" are still on the big screen is beyond me. I guess some people have all the luck.",1024185600,4,906,4.084269662921348
1671696,2,B00005V4XK,"In the opening scene of this film, in which Van Damme's character steals some precious (so they say) ""egg,"" his partner asks:
""Was that a gunshot?"" to which our hero quips:
""No, I farted.""  ... (speechless)
Now you can sense the awkward silence of those who are watching this dreadful dialogue (the script is co-written Dan Damme himself).  If you like this kind of thing, or Van Damme disguised in traditional Jewish clothes (with a beard), you may want to give this film one more star.
The truth is ""The Order"" is not as bad as it looks, considering its too obvious low-budget origin.  The story is [like]Indiana Jones, with the hero's father missing mysteriously, and his action-packed search for the relics of a certain religious group, of which leader attempts to realize the prophcy of their ancient words, and so on and on.  And you also get a deadly booby traps set for careless treasure hunters in a cave.
Overall, an OK action with Van Damme as always giving his high-kicking, and at least, it doesn't try to be anything but what it intends to.  Another good thing about it is Charlton Heston, whose hammy performance, curiously but naturally, fits in the whole system of this Grade-B movie,... And some may find the location of Israel (where main part of the film was shot) very exotic.
Though it lacks any originality and energy his former hits such as ""Timecop"" have, Van Damme's new film ends up as a so-so action film, even though some say it's just another B movie, which is, I am afraid, very true.  What he needs is more energetic direction for hyper-action flicks Hong Kong filmmakers are famous for.",1023321600,,1619,4.683098591549296

After stopping ""The Order"" and throwing the explosives down a huge hole, Van Damme saved the world. The movie also contains Yanni-type music, spiritual!
