4847897,4,B005NKIPWC,"THE DOUBLE is an entertaining, at times far-fetched, espionage thriller in which retired CIA operative Richard Gere joins forces with rookie FBI agent Topher Grace to catch ""Cassius,"" a Cold War-era Soviet assassin who has resurfaced and is now killing more people, including a U.S. Senator.

That's all I'm going to tell you about the plot of THE DOUBLE, because if I reveal more, I will be a Spoiler.  There are a couple of surprising plot twists in this film, one of which even surprised me.  That's not an easy thing to do.

On the other hand, that final twist is where the believability factor comes into play, but I won't say more.

The cast, which includes Stephen Moyer, and Martin Sheen, is very good and director  Michael Brandt, who wrote the screenplay with Derek Haas, keeps the film, apparently shot in Washington, D.C., moving along at a nice pace.

Extras on the DVD from Image Entertainment include producer's interviews, plus audio commentary by Brandt and Haas.

4847898,4,B005NKIPWC,"Richard Gere, a retired CIA agent is called back from retirement to find a Soviet assassin believed to have been dead. A senator was murdered with the killer using the same MO as code name ""Cassius"" a former Russian agent assassin who was never caught. Gere is paired with Topher Grace, a young desk jockey from the FBI. Topher studied Cassius and wrote his thesis on him. He believes Cassius is alive and retired in the US and is the recent killer. Gere claims it is a copy cat killer and does not want to work with Topher.

There is an early plot twist, something we get enough hints to clue us in. Even though Topher lacks field experience he is fairly savvy. As they seek out Cassius, bodies start to accumulate. Martin Sheen plays the head of the CIA. While an early mystery is solved for us, there are others that exist. There are action scenes, killings, and drama. I felt the acting brought the film down. Gere was wrong for that role. I really would have liked a hipper Travolta. I did enjoy the soundtrack, which was a mild Russian pagan metal with a good drum beat.  Makes for a decent spy drama rental. 3 1/2 stars. Gere fans can take it to 4 stars as he looks like he has stayed in pretty good shape for a man his age.

No f-bombs, sex, or nudity. Mild swearing.",1326499200,141,1275,4.304166666666666

Type casted as a Russian prostitute with ties to a Russian, killer she should have turned this project down.  Shame on her agent and mangement team for even suggesting this project.  She is so much better than this aweful movie.  Surprised she was given top billing.  I can only assume that she was given it due to the 2011 release date.  She was already popular as the he character Beckett on Castle and it must have brought in some fans to watch as it did me!  Rent for the plot which is surprisingly interesting but not if you think her top billing makes her a creditable actress in this film.",1438300800,,747,4.330935251798561

Other than that it's terrible.  The premise is good, the execution is awful.  Richard Gere and Martin Sheen are sleepwalking.  Majority of the dialogue is atrocious.  Horrendous plot devices.  A null hypothesis from statistics makes him scratch out a word on a wordpad and suddenly he knows things he didn't know before.  During a key sequence the two main characters sit and talk to each other while the bad guy runs and hides.  OSHA violations on ladder in a bookstore.  And the hospital with only one working light in the parking garage.  And on and on.  Watch if you a sick in bed like me, otherwise avoid.",1405987200,,783,4.475177304964539

4848144,5,B005NKIPWC,"I usually don't do reviews on many things and those that I do offer reviews on tend to be fantasy novels.  So, although this will be a departure from the norm for me, I'll forge ahead.  Because I really, really liked this movie.  Part of the attraction was that I enjoy the espionage genre and, since having seen an older Richard Gere in the sweetly poignant movie ""Hachi: A Dog's Tale,"" I see him as a mature actor with great depth who is a pleasure to watch.

Now, the movie is not a deep, universal-truth-of-life-will-be-revealed type of movie.  It is an old-fashioned suspense movie with, as I say, twists that I'll not reveal.  Suffice to say that the audience knows the identity of an assassin that is active throughout the movie.  Now, Richard Gere is a retired CIA field operative that had tracked a group of seven assassins from the U.S.S.R. and, one by one, ended them.  But now, many years later, it appears that one of the assassins actually survived because periodic assassins have occurred, all with a hallmark manner of death, specific to the assassin presumed ended those many years ago.

Yes, there is some action and yes, the movie does make you think.  No, its not an Academy Award level movie - but it is a very enjoyable movie with, what I felt to be, a good, believable plot with a handy surprise at the end...  I enjoyed it and think others will, as well.  Particularly if you find the East-West spy conflict historically interesting, or if you lived through it from the Berlin Wall going up to the News Years Eve celebration in Berlin as it began to come down, 1 January 1990 and watched as the Soviet regime collapsed.",1403740800,5,1643,4.551020408163265

4848156,4,B005NKIPWC,"When I read the review, I was like this I got to see!  He does pull it off and the movie was worth watching!  The plot moves along and the payoff is worth it!  It shows that good actors are better (Liam Neeson, Harrison Ford, Daniel Craig) and blow buffed action (actors?) off the screen!",1403049600,,288,4.2
4848157,4,B005NKIPWC,"An interesting spin on a spy movie.  Keeps you guessing, with a somewhat predictable twist. Entertaining, good, but not great.",1403049600,,126,5.3
4848158,5,B005NKIPWC,"I had never heard of this movie, or at least didn't remember it.  I'm so glad I found it.  Great suspense throughout and I didn't connect the title correctly until near the end.  If you like mystery and action, don't miss this one.",1402963200,,231,4.325581395348837

4848161,5,B005NKIPWC,Hard to look away! I had a sense of what might happen from the beginning but that only made me watch more intently! Loved it.,1402704000,,125,4.04
4848162,4,B005NKIPWC,"There was a good balance of suspense and surprise. I guessed Gere's secret about half way through the film, but the FBI agent's secret was unexpected",1402704000,,149,4.769230769230769

4848164,4,B005NKIPWC,Though I have seen this movie 2x before I am still taken a back by the end. The other actor whose name escapes me I think is odd in his role but the movie is still good.,1402444800,,169,3.5945945945945947
4848165,4,B005NKIPWC,"Without giving the ending away, it was surprising although it did leave some unanswered questions that never got close to being explained. Not the best movie I've seen, but it was definitely interesting and the acting was okay and didn't distract from the movie.",1402444800,,262,4.9772727272727275

4848167,4,B005NKIPWC,Richard Gere is excellent.  Much different ending than I thought.  We enjoyed watching The Double and recommend it.  Not good for kids.,1402358400,,135,5.045454545454546

4848179,4,B005NKIPWC,"Not since Officer and a Gentleman have I enjoyed watching Gere act in a film as much as this one!  HIs performance is sterling and reminds me of how intricate the Soviet espionage system really is and how asleep the average Amerikan really is!  I believe I have met and even worked with foreign agents in the U.S.!  Many have worked inside the Pentagon, NSA, CIA, FBI and other official arms of the U.S. without being detected.",1401580800,,427,4.51948051948052

4848193,4,B005NKIPWC,"Not bad.  Has two twists.  One not that far into movie, with another twist at end.  So A for being original in having 2 twists in one movie.  It holds your attention, and is entertaining, which is what a movie is meant to be for.",1400630400,,229,4.022222222222222
4848194,3,B005NKIPWC,"This movie was exhilarating, and had a good cast of actors. I enjoyed the twists and turns of the plot.",1400544000,,103,4.2
4848195,3,B005NKIPWC,It was alright. Nothing to rave about. And it was dark as in color dark even when it was daylight you couldn't make out much of the background,1400544000,,142,4.107142857142857
4848196,4,B005NKIPWC,Richard Gere is a good start to any movie. With a new cold war brewing a popular genre will be even more so.,1400457600,,108,3.739130434782609
4848197,4,B005NKIPWC,"Highly recommend - good action, suspense, and best of all does not follow the typical formula of this kind of genre. I was pleasantly surprised.",1400284800,,144,4.8
4848198,4,B005NKIPWC,"Once you figure out where this is going, which isn't too hard, it stops being very interesting. Richard Gere is a solid actor, but he never rises above his smirkiness.",1400284800,,167,4.6
4848199,4,B005NKIPWC,Not typically a big fan of Richard Gere. I did enjoy this movie however. Is his acting getting better with age.,1400198400,,111,4.333333333333333
4848200,4,B005NKIPWC,A really good 'whodunit'. Keeps you guessing most of the time. Gere is very good in this film. First you like him then you hate him. This would make a good TV series to go up against 'The Black List',1400112000,,199,4.0
4848201,5,B005NKIPWC,"For a change a movie actually wasn't what was expected or followed the ""norm"".  Liked all the twists and turns.",1399939200,,111,4.55
4848202,4,B005NKIPWC,A good movie that we would watch again. Keeps your attention and gets more interesting towards the very end of the movie.,1399939200,,121,4.545454545454546
4848203,4,B005NKIPWC,Loved Richard Gere.  Movie kept you guessing and conclusion was not a giveaway.  This movie is good for adults and at only 1hr 39 min it is a quick view.,1399939200,,153,4.066666666666666
4848204,5,B005NKIPWC,The suspense was the best par. I would never have expected it to end as it did. The theme was a little hard to make sense out of at first but the urge to see what happened  next kept me glued to my sit. Great movie,1399939200,,214,3.652173913043478
4848205,3,B005NKIPWC,It was enjoyable to watch (since it was free) not a lot really happening in the movie but a couple of nice twists to plot.,1399852800,,122,3.92

4848207,4,B005NKIPWC,"Full of suspense, excitement,well written and fantastic acting. It's not that old Amazon is great about that, will watch it again.",1399852800,,130,5.238095238095238
4848208,2,B005NKIPWC,A rather dark and depressing plot doesn't deter Richard Gere from doing his usual excellent job of acting. Not an exciting thriller but an OK flick to pass the time.,1399852800,,165,4.533333333333333
4848209,2,B005NKIPWC,Hokie and not believable.. the whole time you know you are watching something made for TV.. this is not how the intelligence field works.,1399766400,,137,4.75
4848210,4,B005NKIPWC,I did not figure out what was happening before my eyes until late in the file.  I love not knowing until the end what is going to happen.,1399766400,,137,3.892857142857143
4848211,5,B005NKIPWC,WAS ON THE EDGE OF MY COUCH THE WHOLE MOVIE.  i LOVE THE ACTORS AND SPY MOVIES. WOULD WATCH IT AGAIN. WASN'T OVERLY COMPLICATED!,1399593600,,128,4.333333333333333
4848212,4,B005NKIPWC,"My first Prime Movie.  Enjoyed the pace and flow of the movie.  Kept my interest throughout and had an ending that surprised me.  If you enjoy realistic video affects this is for you.  Sit back, relax and enjoy an entertaining action movie.",1399593600,,240,4.642857142857143
4848213,2,B005NKIPWC,"Gere is as wooden as he was 34 years ago in American Gigolo. The plot is thin and hardly suspenseful. For a similar story line but waaaaay more compelling, watch NO WAY OUT with Kevin Costner. Now that is suspense!",1399593600,,214,4.375
4848214,3,B005NKIPWC,Good story and the end was well done. The two principal actors did a credible job. The movie was enjoyable to watch.,1399507200,,116,4.318181818181818

4848216,3,B005NKIPWC,"A typical spy flick flashing back to the pre-Berlin Wall days in Europe with Richard Gere poorly cast as an ex-CIA field analyst and Martin Sheen (who does not get nearly enough screen time) as his old boss and friend.  If you have 90 mins to spare fron your life, then I guess you can consider watching this.",1399420800,,309,4.327586206896552
4848217,4,B005NKIPWC,"Had a surprise ending, which was good. Had trouble understanding why the main character was in the position he was in with who he was.  Seemed a little far fetch but like Gere and Grace so that was the attraction to this movie.",1399420800,,227,4.27906976744186

4848220,4,B005NKIPWC,"Plot takes a while to develop and there are a few surprises throughout the movie.

There are so many movies like this which makes the cliche so common. As if we're anticipating something to happen. This movie is no different. But a few twists and the ending is typical. Not sure we as movie goers will ever see anything that hasn't been seen or done before.",1399334400,,357,4.409090909090909
4848221,4,B005NKIPWC,Very good movie with a twist. Would recommend as a rental don't know what else to say. Thank You hope it helped,1399334400,,111,4.090909090909091
4848222,3,B005NKIPWC,Respectable spy vs spy movie. Kind of a predictable story with a small twist at the end. Music doesn't really seem to fit.,1399248000,,122,4.3478260869565215
4848223,4,B005NKIPWC,Richard Here plays a good role in this movie. The plot keeps you wondering and trying to figure out the killer.,1399248000,,111,4.333333333333333
4848224,5,B005NKIPWC,Richard gere is wonderful and the ending will shock you!  Watch this movie when you are ready for some surprises.,1399248000,2,113,4.65
4848225,5,B005NKIPWC,An unusually twisted plot with a surprise of two in the way to the conclusion of the movie. I have watched it several times and will do so again.,1399161600,2,145,4.0344827586206895
4848226,2,B005NKIPWC,"Weak story... a real downer for Richard Gere, who has done far better in other movies.
We stopped watching after the first hour.",1399075200,,128,4.608695652173913
4848227,2,B005NKIPWC,"Good acting; however, too much killing, along with little substance, a lot of which had been entwined, or otherwise laced with Russo-phobia.",1399075200,,140,5.409090909090909
4848228,3,B005NKIPWC,"Not bad for a rainy afternoon.  Surprise twist in the story line and with the ending.  Watched because of Stana being listed as part of the cast, she had a very small insignificant part as a Russian prostitute, seems she is type cast as an immoral undesirable individual in her movies, poor girl she is a much better actress than the characters she plays in her movies.  She evidently doesn't seem to mind as she accepts each one.  Maybe that is the kind of role she wants to play or character she wants to be where it is not a stretch to act different from real life.  Anyway I think her talent is far better than any of her characters to date, but she makes no difference to this movie at all, her character could have been ignored all together or replaced by a drunk, or drug addict.  The role was that insignificant.",1398988800,,820,4.326797385620915
4848229,5,B005NKIPWC,"I gave this movie five stars for originality, great acting and an interesting plot.  Worth the time it takes to watch it.",1398902400,2,121,4.5
4848230,4,B005NKIPWC,Great show if you like spy shows.  you will never guess the end of the show until the very end,1398902400,,94,3.7
4848231,4,B005NKIPWC,"Mr. Gere is a rare talent; a strong personality bordering on the egotistical, combined extremely nuanced performances.  When his ego doesn't go over the top, expect a fine performance.  Here we have a very fine performance of a CIA operative, who is a ""mole"" of the old NKVD (""Cassius"") and another ""mole"" or ""sleeper"" from the more modern Russian counter-intelligence bureau.  It would be difficult to explain more about this picture without ruining the plot for those who haven't seen it.  There is considerable drama in the personal evolution of the two main characters.  Although at the end, it seemed fairly certain of what fate awaited Cassius, the resolution of his counterpart's moral dilemma wasn't quite so easy to foresee.  There are plenty of tense moments in the movie, which has enough twists and turns to satisfy any lover of modern spy vs. spy movies.  It's a good ride.  You won't be disappointed.",1398902400,,914,4.928104575163399
4848232,3,B005NKIPWC,"Not the best thriller drama ever but, worth watching if you are a Richard Gere fan. He has done better work.",1398902400,,108,4.190476190476191
4848233,5,B005NKIPWC,Good movie has good action.was pretty interesting. I'm sure in real life that has happen from a detective. I would watch it again.,1398816000,2,130,4.695652173913044
4848234,2,B005NKIPWC,"I love the espionage/thriller genre but this movie was just a dud. I don't know if it was the script or the directing but the actors seem to sleepwalk through their roles and that's what you'll do also, sleep.",1398816000,,209,4.384615384615385

4848236,5,B005NKIPWC,All in all it is a very enjoyable movie. Never expected all the twists and outcome but must admit that it made it even better.,1398816000,2,126,4.08

4848238,4,B005NKIPWC,We love movies which keep moving and this one does. Richard Gere always does a good job at making acting seem real,1398729600,,114,4.2272727272727275
4848239,4,B005NKIPWC,Enjoyed the edge of your seat and seeing Richard Gere in a different role.  I recommend renting this movie today.,1398643200,,113,4.65
4848240,4,B005NKIPWC,This picture's plot is full of surprising revelations and discoveries.  It is good entertainment but the ending is disappointing and quite unbelievable.  It is a good action movie for a quiet night at home.,1398556800,,206,5.029411764705882
4848241,5,B005NKIPWC,"Initially I chose to watch this movie due to the actors indicated.  I had not idea what it was about.  I was very impressed with the acting, the plot and the ending.  I can recommend it to anyone who likes suspense, action, drama and espionage.  If you do not have Amazon Prime, then look for it elsewhere as it provides almost 2 hours of entertainment with many twists.  Great movie.",1398470400,,384,4.428571428571429
4848242,4,B005NKIPWC,This movie is good.  It is a bit predictable in places but still holds your interest.  It works for when you are in the mood for a movie and can't really find anything else.,1398470400,,173,4.0588235294117645
4848243,3,B005NKIPWC,This movie was fine. There was nothing memorable. For a free Amazon Prime movie it was worth my time. I would have felt pretty bummed if I had paid for it. A couple of the things didn't make sense to me. Also in the flashbacks of 20 years before everyone looked to be the same age.,1398384000,,281,4.035714285714286
4848244,3,B005NKIPWC,"Starts out very slow, but moves faster towards the end of the movie with a powerful twist.  Did not see that coming and that is what gave this movie the 3 star rating.",1398384000,,167,4.0606060606060606
4848245,4,B005NKIPWC,"This film started out as a 5 star, then with double twist plots, it ended up a 4. Richard Gere stars as a retired CIA agent lured back to work to help find a serial Russian killer, Cassius. The head of the CIA played by Martin Sheen seems to know it all and urges Gere to work with a young FBI agent played by Topher Grace. First of all, this is a fantasy, no where will a CIA agent lower himself to work with the FBI.

Early in in the film, a plot twist occurs and we are privy to info others have no knowledge. This us a rough and tumble film, that had such potential. Richard Gere is one of those consummate actors that can joke any film together, and he does it here. Topher Grace is over acted and overwhelmed in this film. The issei is finding the Russian Cassius and bringing him to justice, but along the way many other Russians are found, and we okay games. Lots of lovely scenes of DC, and lots of ugly scenes of DC and the rivers left untreated. Old factories and trailers are the in mode.

This is a film for a rainy day, it could have been a sunny day, but there you have it.

4848263,2,B005NKIPWC,"Formulaic ""Action"". The title is a giveaway and there is a boring twist too far in the end. Gere is too boring for action, Topher is too  non-action. Also - the ""action"" was a bit of running and some driving.

4848268,3,B005NKIPWC,"The movie is super slow to get started.  It's so boring.  The last third gets ""entertaining"" if you can avoid thinking too much about the plot.  In the first 15 minutes there's a scene where a middle-aged man sits alone watching young boys play little league baseball.  When one of the Moms asks which one is his child, he replies none of the them, he just likes to watch them play.  The Mom responds that's sweet.  The rest of the movie is equally absurd.",1397433600,,456,4.369047619047619

Ben's identity is completely concealed until the very end, and Cassius's motives are pretty obscure until late on in the movie.  I grew up during the Cold War, but the idea of a ten year old child being groomed to be a double agent and an assassin cool enough to get a job at the American Embasey in Paris and work shoulder to shoulder with the Director of the FBI is unbelievable, even back then.",1396137600,,467,4.177777777777778

It is a plot twist formula and does not even do that very well. And lets see, car chase - no not even that is very good.

They take an interesting storyline and further trick you into watching by casting top billed actors Richard Gere and Martin Sheen, then proceed to subject you to a movie so terrible it would make Michael Bay blush.

What makes a good thriller is believability. In The Double, no attempt is made to make the minor details make any sense, pivotal points are off cue, and even the music is out of place. With a really good storyline, all of this MIGHT be able to be forgiven except for one egregious transgression: someone had the sick sense of humor (I hope it was an attempt at humor) to cast Topher Grace in this film. The only thing worse than Topher Grace is his name. Topher. Are you kidding me? This guy couldn't act his way out of a paper bag and he makes the movie almost unwatchable. What a dbag.

I can only recommend this film as a form of torture, perhaps as a method of interrogation or to punish your worst enemy. Do yourself a favor and hold your head under water before watching this film.",1394928000,,1155,4.392523364485982

You can find a better movie to watch.",1394582400,,166,4.21875
4848343,4,B005NKIPWC,This was just a great movie. A few twists - one you wont' see coming and one you might. Well acted. Gere is like Cruise... you might have a strong opinion of him but on screen both of them are fantastic at their craft. No Oscars but you will be entertained and much like the Usual Suspects say... I did not see that one coming.,1394409600,,327,4.046153846153846

4848366,5,B005NKIPWC,"This is one of those movies that keep you on the edge of your seat,with each turn of events. Richard Gere is at his finest as he takes on this duck & dodge in plain site role. His partner is just as agile as he is hot on the trail of his game & has to make a decision
as what to do when he has him in his sights. Should he complete his mission as ordered & expose himself & everything or cover up the real truths?

I watched this movie twice. The second time after a few week of the first. I found I had missed so much the first time & was better the second watch. If you like spy movies then you will love this one.",1393891200,,616,3.7384615384615385

4848368,4,B005NKIPWC,Richard Gere is becoming one of the greatest senior actors with the roles he has been playing in the past several movies.  In this  suspense tale the viewer is led in one direction and suddenly it dawns on them who the real mastermind is but only when it is too late to redeem themselves.  A good mix of Robbins and Clancy style stories.  Enjoy....,1393891200,,348,4.390625
4848369,2,B005NKIPWC,"This movie tries too hard but never quite makes the mark.
It tries with too many twists that never really hook the watcher.  One thing it doesn't do is have character development.

4848385,2,B005NKIPWC,"This is not the worst movie in the world. But if you care about believable plots or acting then this is not the film for you.
Is everybody in this film a double agent with a fake past? The FBI does thorough background checks on janitors and clerks at government facilities... Keep that in mind while watching this. But don't worry, there will be plenty of other plot holes for you to scoff at.

4848387,2,B005NKIPWC,"Relatively well done movie with a plot line that starts out feasible.

Production quality was a little low...but my son enjoyed it and I got to spend a couple of hour with him.  Flashback scenes were comical as Richard Gere appears to be the same age in 1988 as in 2012.,1393372800,,347,4.134328358208955

4848402,3,B005NKIPWC,"This movie had a rather fascinating twist to the plot involving double double agents but somewhat unrealistic. Makes you wonder if there are any non Russian spies working for the CIA and FBI for it is stranger how these two guys were vetted for their jobs. Also the idea that know terrorists and spies are here in the US is less likely for us to believe these days. How they get in unnoticed is not all that likely anymore. Possible, yes, but not likely. We have to worry more about home grown terrorists such as those involved in the Boston marathon bombings than people sneaking in. So though the movie had great plot twists, it seems a bit far fetched to me. Gere is good by the way as is Martin Sheen.",1393286400,,705,4.348484848484849

4848411,3,B005NKIPWC,"A spy thriller in a line of spy thrillers that manages to captivate and entertain its audience, if not thrill. Following a formula to the letter, The Double is predictable to the last plot point, and the pretty packaging of this movie is tied up with a bow, not in the least surprising though it attempts one surprise after another. Youll quickly understand the intent of the plot, and the identity of the characters, but Gere and Grace are strong enough actors that they can turn predictable characters into interesting performances.

Russian spies in the U.S., but for how long? According to FBI Agent Ben Geary, they have been for as long as you can imagine. He is hot on the trail of long-ghosted assassin Cassius, a man never identified and never caught when the Russians were the worst threat the CIA could imagine, back in the 80's and 90's. According to CIA Agent Paul Shepherdson, though, those days are over. Begin sparring between agencies to get to the bottom of a mystery, or perhaps begin relooking at what everyone thinks they know. You won't have to watch long to understand the true story behind the story, but you'll want to watch to see just how it all plays out.",1393027200,,1182,4.628571428571429

Great interesting plot. Good twist.",1392854400,,127,4.818181818181818
4848422,2,B005NKIPWC,"None of the actors played their roles in a believable manner, which went along with the badly written script of a pretty good basic storyline.  It wasn't a complete waste of time to watch, but definitely one of those movies that makes you grimace and wince at several components and situations and be grateful when it ends.",1392854400,,323,4.666666666666667

4848429,3,B005NKIPWC,"An OK spy/action thriller that is typical of the genre: If you think too hard about the plot line there are more holes than your average slice of Swiss cheese. At least the body count is held within the teens and it is (mostly) the bad guys who pay the ultimate price, but it is only a ""must see,"" if you are a die-hard Richard Gere fan.",1392768000,,337,4.044776119402985

4848440,3,B005NKIPWC,Not bad. I had never heard of this until we saw it on Prime. Some of the plot twists are a bit predictable but others are a little surprising. Overall it was an entertaining movie.,1392681600,,180,4.171428571428572
4848441,5,B005NKIPWC,"I had not heard of this movie until I saw it on amazon prime.

4848443,5,B005NKIPWC,We enjoyed the touch of espionage and sadness. The plot was pretty obvious but was still interesting to see what would happen to Richard Gere in the end.  The twist with the Malcolm in the middle kid was really well played.,1392595200,,223,4.439024390243903

Gere's then paired with a new FBI investigator who eventually figures out that Gere is Cassius, and lately has been killing Russian agents that were involved in killing his family years ago. Gere, on the other hand, seemingly deliberately gives his FBI guy hints to undo himself. Major surprises at the end.",1392508800,,496,4.916666666666667

4848482,3,B005NKIPWC,"I enjoy a good thriller, one that keeps you on the edge of your seat. The Double, unfortunately, didn't meet that expectation. Gere was overacting in his role and lacked the authenticity of a secret agent. Easily ID'd as the good guy/bad guy, and I couldn't really appreciate his portrayed character. When the cats are finally let out of the bag, it's sort of anticlimactic. The movie plot is thin, the characters overplayed, and the believability level is low. However, having said all that, if you just want to watch a movie and not be expecting anything spectacular, which was the case for me, knock yourself out and down load it on Prime. I personally wouldn't spend money to rent or purchase it. Just as an aside, I started watching Arbitrage which also stars Gere. After about 30 to 45 minutes, I shut it down. Just too, too much to bear.",1391990400,,844,4.596026490066225

Basically it never tells you WHY certain people are being sought after and killed.  It doesn't develop the characters properly and is just sloppy at times.  The acting isn't Awesome and Richard Gere is kind of statue like at times.  I don't understand the hype of this movie.

4848513,3,B005NKIPWC,Double agents are the inevitable cost of espionage. A bit unplausible that the young person obsessed with Cassius turns out to be another double agent.,1391299200,,151,5.08
4848514,4,B005NKIPWC,"I'm not going to write a long review about this movie-if that's what you want, there are plenty of self-styled reviewers on here already. Just going to say that I thought this was a pretty good movie--lots of action and a decent plot, and that's what I'm looking for when I want to be entertained!  Enjoy this one--I did!",1391212800,,321,4.440677966101695
4848515,3,B005NKIPWC,It's OK.  Not good enough to walk 20 miles to see.  Has a fair amount of drama.  Not for children.,1391212800,,98,3.8
4848516,4,B005NKIPWC,"Ran across this one based on other movies I watched.  It was good.  Kinda like Salt, but different.
You did have to pay attention and piece it together a bit.  But it was subtle enough with some twists.
They could have gone a little more into the back story, training, how he started, etc.  But it was a
good movie and kept my interest.  Was glad I watched it.",1391126400,,360,4.159420289855072
4848517,3,B005NKIPWC,"Richard Gere is a very good actor, but was not at his best in this film.  The plot was not complicated nor the suspense spell-binding.  It seemed like this was a no frills low budget film.",1391126400,,188,4.194444444444445
4848518,5,B005NKIPWC,"I liked this movie. It was supenseful and good enough if you like this kind of movie. Richard Gere is always fun to watch - especially if you're female.
There was nothing hokey or too impossible to believe  about it.
I would recommend it for people who miss the cold war. LOL.",1391126400,,276,4.3076923076923075

4848520,2,B005NKIPWC,"I knew going in it wasn't going to be good...held out hope that Richard Gere could make up for the lack of acting chops of Topher Grace.  Alas, no go.  Both of them were awful.  Plot was predictable and boring.  don't waste your time.",1391126400,,234,4.25

4848523,5,B005NKIPWC,the suspense. Watched it straight through with no breaks. Lots of action. Violence may be a little intense for the weak at heart,1391040000,,128,4.608695652173913
4848524,4,B005NKIPWC,"Exciting, interesting, and compelling drams. I was on the edge of my seat for the entire movie. Just when I thought I had it all figured out, the plot took an unexpected twist and I realized I was all wrong.",1391040000,,207,4.2

4848527,3,B005NKIPWC,"The twist of this story was given away way to early in the movie.
I would have preferred that I would have had to figure it out.

4848534,4,B005NKIPWC,"It's always  a pleasure to spend time with Richard Gere.  The roles he chooses are often filled with twists as was this one.  To summarize the plot would give away some of its surprises.  Suffice it to say, the title is very apt.  So, if you are looking to escape the everyday world for a couple of hours,  watch The Double.  And if you are a Prime member, it's free!",1390953600,,367,4.1571428571428575

4848537,4,B005NKIPWC,"Decent action/mystery/drama film with more than one twist.  I recommend it for those who remember the cold war and are still a little paranoid about the ""new order"" in the former Soviet Union.",1390953600,,192,4.818181818181818
4848538,4,B005NKIPWC,"Lots of suspense, twists and turns with two of my favorite actors, Richard Gere and Martin Sheen. Not a five stare movie, but worth watching.",1390953600,,141,4.68
4848539,4,B005NKIPWC,it elaborates on the actions of spies at every corner of USA. Worth watching for an action and i loved it,1390953600,,105,4.0476190476190474

4848541,4,B005NKIPWC,"I enjoyed watching this.  Frankly, though, I got confused.  Since the important part of the plot, Cassius' identity, was revealed half way through the movie, I assumed there would be a twist to it.  Perhaps Gere was lying and he was not Cassius.  He was.  Sorry.",1390867200,,262,4.608695652173913

4848544,4,B005NKIPWC,"I expected this to be the same ol' plot of a seasoned agent forced to work with a rookie. While the story starts on the same premise, the story quickly changes and continues to quickly shift. Great movie.",1390867200,,204,4.394736842105263

4848550,5,B005NKIPWC,"The movie is great, but the preview quite literally shows you the entire movie including the twist and the ending. It completely ruins the movie.",1390435200,,145,4.84
4848551,4,B005NKIPWC,Pretty good story.  As with most of this genre some suspension of common sense is necessary.  Not many will figure it all out until near the end  -  you'll just think you did.,1390435200,,175,4.212121212121212
4848552,4,B005NKIPWC,This film is action packed. Though it takes a predicatable switch its still fun to watch in all unfold the way it does.,1390435200,,119,4.217391304347826
4848553,4,B005NKIPWC,The action and suspense of this flick were pretty good.  The ending could have used a little help though.  The fact that you have to type so many words into a movie review for amazon really sucks!!!,1390435200,,198,4.324324324324325

4848555,4,B005NKIPWC,you may see some of the twists coming in this spy thriller but there will still be some coming that you don't see. It was enjoyable as Richard Gere movies usually are,1390348800,,166,4.21875
4848556,4,B005NKIPWC,"Richard Gere as a good and bad guy is always good. Good surprise ending, ..did not see that coming. Reminds me of his role in internal Affairs.",1390348800,,143,4.333333333333333

4848559,3,B005NKIPWC,"The movie is good from the standpoint of the various plot twists but it starts getting a little forced towards the end. It's almost as if they wrote themselves into a corner and then decided to throw in a plot device to tidy up the loose ends. The action was good, though, and the acting was passable.",1390348800,,301,4.298245614035087

4848562,2,B005NKIPWC,"This is so poorly written and even Richard Gere is camp in this.  It's so bad I had to watch to the end just to see WHY they bothered to make this movie. I thought...there must be some great twist since you find out pretty early who the killer is.  BUT, the twist is so stupid it was laughable.",1390262400,,294,3.9661016949152543
4848563,1,B005NKIPWC,"Every time there was speech, we had to increase volume,
Every time there was background sound it was so loud we had to decrease volume.
It was the most irritating movie we have ever watched.

The movie itself was just ok.

4848565,3,B005NKIPWC,"If you like escapist action films, this one is fun. Your GF or wife will probably enjoy looking at Gere.
The basic premise of Gere hunting a soviet assassin is believable enough ... there are just some twists and turns that seem a bit implausible. But, again, for a bubble gum spy film, it's ok ... much like the 007 films aren't terribly realistic but are fun to watch, anyway.",1390262400,,378,4.414285714285715

4848571,4,B005NKIPWC,"What can I say without spoiling the story for others that have not seen it.  It was suspenseful.  I wondered what would happen next.  I was pleased with the performances of Richard Gere and Topher Grace.  Should we be a bit more paranoid about those around us?  I enjoyed the movie, the pace, but the story did not feel new.  Bad guys do whatever they can not to get caught and that was true in this story as well.  It was still fun to see.",1390176000,,440,4.105882352941176

4848573,4,B005NKIPWC,This was a very good movie with excellent acting and a very good story line which was well written. The movie kept you enthralled throughout and was somewhat intense.,1390089600,,166,4.758620689655173
4848574,4,B005NKIPWC,This movie was exciting and unlike most thrillers.  It was UNPREDICATBLE!!!!  Topher Grace's performance in this movie is STELLAR and Award-winning!!!!,1390089600,,151,6.142857142857143
4848575,1,B005NKIPWC,I thought this movie would have a little bit more action to it but it did not have any at all Richard Gere gave a good performance but he couldn't carry the movie,1390089600,,162,3.9393939393939394

4848583,4,B005NKIPWC,"Richard Gere tends to under-act. Perhaps, he has a phobia that he might be over-acting. The only other movie of his that I enjoy is Pretty Woman. He has a lot to learn from Clint Eastwood (despite the empty chair syndrome) when it comes to realistic cool mild acting styles. Gere is not a very versatile actor - he has only one style of acting, which is annoying in most of his movies.

Incidentally, his one-trick-pony mild acting style fits well into this movie and its story.",1389916800,,478,4.494252873563219
4848584,4,B005NKIPWC,"There are so many plot twists, that I won't give anything away.  Gere gives a masterful performance, complete with impressive martial-arts quick-kill techniques. Some of the things that happened may be considered a stretch by some, but  In view of recent revelations about the NSA, the viciousness with which America then pursued the Cold War makes the movie believable.  There's a ""double"" plot twist at the end, which I did not see coming.  If you're a fan of this genre, don';t miss it.",1389830400,,489,4.855421686746988

I chose to watch the movie based on the sheer number of folks who rated this movie on Amazon; it's safe to say, though, that's the last time I'll make the same mistake.  The actual ""solving"" of the mystery was so poorly scripted, and so unbelievably stupid, that I nearly stopped watching.  At that point, the movie was nearly over so I figured I'd see how it all played out.

4848605,5,B005NKIPWC,"Clever, well-acted, great editing and cinemagraphic tones.  I saw this when it first came out, was thrilled to see it offered on Prime to get to watch it again.  Seeing Stana Katic in this film was a sweet surprise and so vastly different than her leading role as Becket on the tv show Castle.",1389571200,,293,4.407407407407407
4848606,5,B005NKIPWC,"This movie had me seeing double, lol!  I love a movie that makes me think one thing and lead me so easily in that direction and then pull a whammy on me.

4848608,2,B005NKIPWC,Bad script. Lifeless acting. Film doesn't build up any empathy for the characters. Issues are resolved in a flash with no consequences.,1389484800,,135,5.181818181818182

4848611,2,B005NKIPWC,movie was predictable and mostly about slashing throats with a wire. How can you slash 6 people's throats and get absolutely no blood on the wire??,1389484800,,147,4.6923076923076925

4848617,4,B005NKIPWC,"Very good spy thriller with Richard Gere leading a good cast that includes the always great supporting acting of Martin Sheen.

4848620,3,B005NKIPWC,"The acting is OK-Richard Gere is a good actor in an era of mediocrity, the story is a little bit of several other movies, but there are enough twists and turns to keep the audience interested. I watched to the end, which I won't do if a movie is terrible...",1389398400,,257,4.16
4848621,3,B005NKIPWC,"If only the middle of the movie would have been as good as the beginning and the end, but it wasn't.

4848624,3,B005NKIPWC,"I always enjoy watching Richard Gere in movies.  This is the typical political thriller.  I was caught a little off guard by some twists and turns, but that is the fun.  It is a good way to spend part of an afternoon or evening.",1389312000,,228,4.136363636363637

4848629,4,B005NKIPWC,"Good movie, Richard Gere was great but Topher Grace was horrible. I've seen him in other movies and shows and thought he was good, but this was just weird overacting.",1389225600,,166,4.566666666666666
4848630,3,B005NKIPWC,The ending was unexpected but all the stuff in between made it a little hard to follow.  Worth watching if there's absolutely nothing else available.,1389225600,,149,4.96

4848637,4,B005NKIPWC,got really intriguing when double spy meets another unsuspecting double spy.  The story line weaves back and forth creating lots of suspense.,1389139200,,141,5.409090909090909

4848641,2,B005NKIPWC,The casting for this movie was awful. Richard Gere is not an action movie star. He is a chick flick movie star. The other guy was terrible. He should stick to the sit-coms where he belongs.,1389139200,,189,4.277777777777778
4848642,3,B005NKIPWC,"This felt like another ex-cold war spy thriller that didn't really thrill.  It left me scratching my head.  The characters seem very generic and so did the plot.  I felt like Gere already played this role when he did the ""The Jackal.""  Nothing new to see here.",1389139200,,260,4.468085106382978

4848644,3,B005NKIPWC,"It was so predictable.  Here is not one of Gere's best performances. If you are purely looking for chick flick, this will do.",1389139200,,125,4.434782608695652
4848645,3,B005NKIPWC,"Very Entertaining, but nothing special. Keeps you interested and has a quality petformance from Gere and some lesser known actors.",1389139200,,130,5.55
4848646,3,B005NKIPWC,This movie had a very interesting twist. It kept my curiosity peaked and showed good performances by Gere and the cast.,1389139200,,119,4.714285714285714
4848647,3,B005NKIPWC,"Good movie for bad weather.  Nice suspense.  For streaming it was good.  For free streaming it was great.  My wife liked it better,",1389139200,,131,4.565217391304348
4848648,5,B005NKIPWC,Engaging and fast-paced.  Richard Geere was fabulous. Lots of plot twists to keep you guessing.  This is a great ride.,1389052800,,118,4.85

4848652,2,B005NKIPWC,"While the actors are decent, the movie is predictable and gives too much away at the very beginning, even before the movie divulges what the viewer has already determined (also early in the movie). So then one is forced to sit through the remainder of the movie thinking ""where is this possibly going"" and the answer is, regrettably, ""no where"".",1389052800,,345,4.766666666666667
4848653,4,B005NKIPWC,"Acting was good, the story was interesting and kept our attention.  We have actually watched it more than once. I really prefer Gere's feel good movies, but he does well in this.",1389052800,,178,4.5625

4848658,4,B005NKIPWC,Well done and compelling although not the best acting I've seen from Gere.  Please don't require me to complete a certain number of words for this review.,1388966400,,154,4.703703703703703
4848659,5,B005NKIPWC,Could not deduce the ending no matter how we tried.  Loved the way it kept pointing to certain people and then it wound up being someone entirely different.,1388966400,,156,4.571428571428571
4848660,4,B005NKIPWC,"Although the plot line is predictable (but I won't give it away here) ""The Double"" is a good 2 hour escape.  The acting by Topher Grace and Richard Gere is uninspired but good and it is a well shot film.  If there is nothing better available you probably won't be disappointed.",1388966400,,277,4.411764705882353
4848661,3,B005NKIPWC,This movie never really went anywhere.  It had a poor script and poor acting.  I won't recommend it to anyone very highly.,1388966400,,122,4.5
4848662,5,B005NKIPWC,"Gere is a fantastic actor.  He comes off as an egotistical, self-centered man and ends as the good guy, after all is said and done. Enjoyed the suspense and story line.",1388966400,,168,4.419354838709677
4848663,2,B005NKIPWC,"An aging Richard Gere in a pretty straight forward mystery movie.  If truth be known, two words ""both Russian"" would spoil this movie.",1388966400,,134,4.826086956521739
4848664,5,B005NKIPWC,The plot twists were what kept my attention the entire movie.  Great acting by both Richard Gere and Topher Grace.,1388966400,,114,4.7

4848667,5,B005NKIPWC,"I really enjoyed this film even though the preview gave away the plot. The acting was very believable and the twists and turns were not necessarily a surprise and good enough to be believable. Overall, a good film to watch! Enjoy!",1388880000,,230,4.634146341463414
4848668,4,B005NKIPWC,"This movie held our interest, and had some twists and turns.  Eric from ""that 70's show"" was surprisingly good in a serious role.",1388880000,,129,4.608695652173913

4848670,3,B005NKIPWC,"This movie isn't epic, but it was a nice watch overall. It had a nice dose of action and suspense without going overboard on the blood.

They kind of overdid it with the plot twists right at the end though; the twists were so far out there as to be completely unbelievable. I had to take off a star just for that. No worries though, the music during the credits kind of made me forget the ending. :p",1388793600,,399,4.115384615384615

4848675,4,B005NKIPWC,Takes a good plot and maqkes an interesting twist to shed light on a larger conspiracy.  Could it happen here?,1388793600,,110,4.5
4848676,3,B005NKIPWC,"A fairly good movie, some slow parts and fragmented. Seems like there should have been more suspense and/ or action.  Plot not developed enough.  But it is worth watching when nothing else or reruns are on TV.",1388793600,,209,4.621621621621622

4848697,4,B005NKIPWC,It was suprisingly good!  I wasn't expecting much from a completely unknown movie with Topher as the main character...but it was really not bad at all.,1388448000,,151,4.8076923076923075
4848698,3,B005NKIPWC,Has a few twists and turns that keep you engaged and guessing. Well played drama with a good story versus a movie built on just a bunch of special effects.,1388361600,,155,4.2
4848699,5,B005NKIPWC,Terrific action beginning to end. Actors kept my attention & the plot was filled with surprise. Don't wait see this one.,1388361600,,120,4.761904761904762

4848701,1,B005NKIPWC,This movie is the result of good actors subjected to bad writing.  I couldn't even finish watching this uninteresting film filled with bad dialogue.,1388361600,2,148,5.166666666666667
4848702,4,B005NKIPWC,"I usually don't like Gere. He's rather stale and faceless. Perhaps it's because of his adoption of Buddhism. He often acts as though he doesn't really want to be doing this. Yet, this film succeeds in wanting you to ""turn the pages"" with its mysterious unfolding of events, which finally come together in the last few minutes of the film--""deus-ex-machina"" style.",1388275200,,363,4.967213114754099
4848703,4,B005NKIPWC,"I really enjoyed this movie!  It was like a sleeper or something that would sneak up on you! Whilch made it more enjoyable. Usually I can figure a movie out pretty quick, but this one it took a little longer and then you were not sure. You found out at the same time the character in the movie did.
I would recommand!",1388275200,,317,4.112903225806452

4848706,3,B005NKIPWC,Well acted with a few plot twists - some obvious some not. Gere is always good in his roles.  A good  but not great flick.,1388275200,,122,3.84

4848711,4,B005NKIPWC,i liked the story and almost gave it 5 stars except I reserve 5 stars for my absolute favorites. They did a good job of hiding who was who,1388188800,,138,3.793103448275862

4848713,4,B005NKIPWC,I see other reviewers saying that it was too obvious.  Not everything was obvious to me and I really like a few twists in the story.  I usually don't watch Richard Gere's movies because they are boring.  But I really liked this one.,1388188800,,232,4.348837209302325
4848714,2,B005NKIPWC,Too obvious. Richard Gere is no action star.  There was no suspense. It was boring. I gave up after 10 minutes.,1388188800,,111,4.285714285714286

4848718,2,B005NKIPWC,"This movie was close to terrible.  Lucky Richard Gere saved it.  It was horribly directed and the accents and acting were subpar.  Couldn't help but think that the director said ""Action, Cut, Print that!"" and did not do any retakes.  Everything seemed so cut and dry in every scene with no fluidity throughout the movie.",1388102400,,320,4.763636363636364

4848726,4,B005NKIPWC,I really like this one.  I sorta had it figured out but the ending was a big surprise.  Good flick.,1387843200,,99,3.9
4848727,4,B005NKIPWC,"Considering I watched this movie for free with Amazon Prime membership...I enjoyed it. Richard Gere plays a retired agent brought ""back"" into the game. Since I was never ""sure"" how the plot was going to turn out it kept my interest to the end. And frankly, Richard Gere is ever so easy on the eyes.",1387756800,,298,4.4363636363636365
4848728,4,B005NKIPWC,I was drawn in by Gere and Topher Grace and they were good. Unexpected plot twists and good acting. I enjoyed it.,1387756800,,113,4.181818181818182

4848730,4,B005NKIPWC,"Suspenseful drama with convincing acting, and convoluted plot.  Enjoyed the acting of the troubled Richard Gere, but not so much Topher Grace --he seemed miscast.  A bit of dubious morality and redemption twists to the writing, but ultimately some semblance of redemption through love and death.",1387756800,,295,5.391304347826087
4848731,5,B005NKIPWC,This Movie was surprising good with an unexpected twist! Richard Gere always delivers a good performance. He's is a great actor!,1387670400,,128,5.142857142857143

4848733,3,B005NKIPWC,"Roles were well acted by both protagonists, interesting plot with a most satisfactory conclusion. What could have been hum-drun was actually not, although story line was certainly not new. Lacked something I can't put my finger on. May have been the poor quality of the streaming on my iPad. Perhaps a big screen would be a better venue,",1387497600,,337,4.827586206896552
4848734,4,B005NKIPWC,This was an entertaining movie that held you in suspense for the entire movie. The acting by both lead actors suffers at times but the movie maintains momentum throughout. The twist on the twist at the end is worth It. I like it!,1387411200,,229,4.348837209302325
4848735,1,B005NKIPWC,"we could not finish and flipped to live TV due to the, predictable slow plot unworthy of the cast with stilted dialogue",1387324800,,119,4.454545454545454
4848736,1,B005NKIPWC,The picture was very grainy and it continued to pause and reload. I initially thought the problem was my internet connection. But I viewed the Postman immediately following this one and it was fine.,1387324800,,198,4.852941176470588
4848737,4,B005NKIPWC,"Very entertaining, but then I like spy movies. Can't believe I never saw this until now. Topher Grace and Richard Gere made an unlikely pair, and I did figure it out before the end but really liked the movie just the same.",1387324800,,222,4.309523809523809

4848740,4,B005NKIPWC,Suspenseful!  Didn't figure it out until late in the movie.  Great ending :). Plus I love anything with Richard Gere.,1387238400,,117,4.8
4848741,5,B005NKIPWC,Great Suspense and interesting plot. very entertaining movie. worth the watch. Not used to seeing Richard Gere look so mature.,1386979200,,126,5.35
4848742,2,B005NKIPWC,"The plot of this ridiculous. The clue as to HOW ridiculous was that they gave away what should have been the surprise ending about 1/4 of the way through the film. After that I couldn't imagine how they could build to any kind of a climax. Well, the answer is that the surprise twist at the end is so unbelievable, so strains credibility, so reaches out on a limb in a desperate attempt to ... oh forget it. Waste of time to even review this film.",1386979200,,447,4.209302325581396
4848743,3,B005NKIPWC,"weak story line, but put together well.  Generic comes to mind,  bad ending im my opinion.  Stereotypical bad guy Russians against the U.S.",1386979200,,139,4.956521739130435

4848745,4,B005NKIPWC,It was a nail biter right from the beginning till the end. It was a very twisted ending which I never saw comming.  Good movie,1386892800,,126,4.04
4848746,3,B005NKIPWC,"I thought the premise was great, however, the execution (no pun intended) was weak.  The final revealing made too many jumps and left many things unexplained.  I give it a confident 3 stars!",1386806400,,190,4.7272727272727275
4848747,1,B005NKIPWC,"I can suspend my disbelief only so far.. Interesting premise, well-acted by Gere, but a clunker with the inevitable cliches in the world of espionage, and the bruising and impossible car chase at the end.",1386806400,,204,4.857142857142857
4848748,4,B005NKIPWC,"Very surprised, this movie kept our attention and had a great story.  Nice surprise because I have never even heard of the movie ""THE DOUBLE"".  Thank you Amazon",1386720000,,160,4.678571428571429
4848749,4,B005NKIPWC,Decent plot line and it moved along quickly.  Some of the martial art stuff bordered on stupid but when doesn't it.  Decent action and fairly well acted.,1386547200,,153,4.62962962962963

4848756,5,B005NKIPWC,"Richard Gere is right in his element in this film!  It's surprising to see him play such a hardened character!  I kept thinking that at any moment his gentleness and gentle smile were going to break through, but he stayed tough all the way through!  Topher Grace was also amazing.  He's very talented and did a great job.  I liked the surprises in the film and the backgrounds of Eastern Europe.  I really like films like this: perfect amount of suspense without all the blood and gore.  I'll see it again when I get a chance.  But then, I'm a math major and like simple, straight-forward good acting and story line!",1385942400,,616,4.486486486486487

and it makes for a nice story.",1385683200,,159,3.388888888888889
4848759,1,B005NKIPWC,A shallow story that lacks quality in both story telling an the screen play.  Assumes that the viewer jumps in merely accepts the spy intrigue with no build-up.  Falls short in effort.,1385596800,,184,4.71875
4848760,2,B005NKIPWC,"Ho hum story that has plausibility gaps here and there. Mildly entertaining and OK if free on Amazon Prime.

The show is very realistic to a T, and I am certain that everyone from the writer all the way to the actors are clueless of this fact.

Drones do some of the work today, but as reported in the news boots-on-the-ground will always be needed to 'touch' the bad guys.

Very good educational show for those who missed the Cold War or fail to understand that it will never end.

Think double agent not like two persons who look the same if u actually want to understand the show.

The show is definitely a 4 compared to all other shows, but a 5 compared to spy shows.",1381017600,,724,4.255474452554744

tip: DO NOT WATCH THE TRAILER!!! Resist the temptation to do so. I watched the trailer before hand and it gives away too much of the plot.

Richard Gere is first rate in the part of the retired CIA agent brought back to find the killer of a United States Senator. The killing has the distinctive markings of the work of a Soviet hitman thought to have been dead for twenty years. Gere's character had killed the hitman. Teamed up with Gere is a young FBI agent who had never been in the field before but had made a study of the hitman's career. He  is the model idealistic university trained person who joined the service to serve the public interest. With the team formed, the remainder of the film is devoted to the search for the killer and the changing relationship between the older CIA agent and the younger FBI agent, emphasizing the attraction of the older man with no family to the family (wife and children) of the younger. Martin Sheen is solid as the old veteran head of the CIA with others giving solid supporting
performances. There is action but it is not a film dominated by it. The emphasis is on the personal and professional commitments and loyalties among the participants. Should be a satisfying film to devotees and the general viewer, if they can bear with the attitudes manifest and the one bad slip from classic cynicism characteristic of the genre.",1377302400,3,1369,4.587755102040816

From the beginning the very music is as weak and predictible as the direction of the story line, with Gere a brooding, seemingly highly respected former agent who we quickly discover is really hiding in ""plain sight"". Even if you lay aside the fact that he is obviously the bad guy and even the janitors at the CIA could have known it, you are still left with the highly scripted acting in all the scenes  where the ""top brass"" meet to discuss this killer. Once we get out in the field you spend much of the movie in uncomfortable embarrasment for the younger agent who misses the glaringly obvious fact that he is working with the man he pursues. Constantly the script employs nun to subtle hints which our young agent dutifully ponders and just when you think the light will come on shakes his head as if the Harvard Masters Program didn't prepare him for these difficult propositions. WOW.

It starts out with the viewer hoping against reason that there will be some trully interesting twist but then much like a loud mouth friend who gives  the ending away the actors themselves ruin  the movie in doing their best this-is -what-secret-agents-look-like-when-they-pretend-to-be-actors impersonation. Maybe the real plot is the just that- actors pretending to be agents pretending to be actors. Now that's a reverse phsycology plot twist that you never saw coming. But you did have to pay $5 to rent.

4848908,3,B005NKIPWC,"Spy vs. Spy thriller about Russian spies and assassins infiltrating the US.  If there were not enough crime elements to worry about for the average American (street gangs, Mexican drug cartels, inner-city crime wave, serial murderers, the Mafia, deranged mass killers), now we have to worry about Russian Assassins!

The assassin in particular is a ghostly guy formerly working for the KGB, code-named Cassius.  Cassius put together a team of Russian assassins and controlled them from afar, back in the day (the Cold War).  Then he dissapeared for 20 years.  Richard Gere plays retired CIA operative Paul Shepherdson, who looked for Cassius and tried to kill his team of assassins in the '80s, and is now called out of retirement.  Topher Grace plays Ben Geary, a young nerdy FBI agaent with a wife and young family, who teams up with Gere to solve a Cassius-like murder of a US Senator.  Has the fiend Cassius resurfaced in the US? You see, Cassius has a nearly invincible knack to kill people with his ""wire around the neck"" technique:  very gruesome.  So when the Senator gets knocked off in similar manner, the CIA gives Topher and Gere the task of tracking Cassius down.  Then the dynamic duo get to bang heads with one Russian thug after another.

The plot proceeds in a reasonable manner, until there are lots of twists, a sudden escalation of violence, and you don't know who is the good guy and who is the bad guy (hence the title).  There's a big twist at the movie's end (I won't tell it to you).

Does this film, plot, premise and actors work for me?  Meh .... The premise of tons of scary Russian assassins infiltrating the US seems to me to be pushing credulity.  The premise of Cassius' invincibility and his method of killing also leaves me skeptical. But OK, even if I accept the premise, then I have some difficulty with fully accepting the turns & twists of the plot, especially Gere's character.  It's not that it's a bad plot, it just doesn't totally ring true for me.  Finally, I like Gere as an actor usually, but I just don't quite feel he measures up in action & dynamism for the role he's playing.  A credible job, yes, but another ""Meh"" feeling for the actors.  Which leads to a workmanlike ""3"" rating for this movie, worth the $2 to rent but that's about it.

A scene with a trailer park supposed by the Potomac?  A very poorly staged news interview with two alleged Senators that was obviously actors?  The J.

4848925,3,B005NKIPWC,"There was a time when a movie with Richard Gere meant mega-box office success. It seems that Hollywood has taken to releasing his pictures much along the lines they do with aging actresses, delivering them straight to DVD rather than the big screen. That's a shame since Gere has rarely turned in a bad performance and the movies bypassing the big screen are often better than movies that make it there. THE DOUBLE is a good example.

Gere portrays Paul Shepherdson, an ex-C.I.A. called out of retirement by his old boss, Tom Highland (Martin Sheen). It seems that years ago Paul was the lead agent in charge of tracking down a top Soviet assassin, a man known only as Cassius. When a U.S. Senator is killed using the same techniques as Cassius, it is believed that he has returned. Paul insists that he killed him years ago but no body was found.

When Paul attends a joint meeting of the C.I.A. and the F.B.I., he asks why anyone would believe this is the work of Cassius. The man who brought this to the F.B.I.'s attention is their agent Ben Geary (Topher Grace). Geary has studied every piece of evidence concerning Cassius going to far as to write his thesis in college about the case. It is his belief that the recent murder shows signs that Cassius has returned.

Paul and Geary are assigned to work together to find the evidence to prove or disprove that Cassius has returned and if he has to find him before he kills again. The pair follow up on clues and contacts in the hopes of finding anyone that can lead them to Cassius or at least information that would do so. And here's where a plot twist arrives early. I wouldn't actually call this a spoiler since it was revealed in the trailer, but the identity of Cassius is shown early on when he kills an ex-comrade that was in his group of assassins that Paul and Geary interview. Paul is Cassius.

So now the whole mystery takes a different angle. Instead of two agents trying to find a killer the pair has one trying to find him and the other trying to remain hidden. And if Cassius wasn't the murderer of the Senator than who was? It is these questions that make this thriller more interesting than one would have expected.

Shootouts, interviews and betrayals are found around every corner. Paul gets to meet Geary's family and warns his wife that the man her husband is trying to find is deadly and that it could put their family in danger. But Geary doggedly pursues each lead in the hopes of finding his man.

So I said there was a spoiler right? Well perhaps not quite so. As I said, that was revealed in the trailer for the movie. There remains a twist in the story as it ends that will catch you completely off guard, not something easily done these days. And that's what makes this thriller one worth watching, along with the great performances.

As I stated early on, there are so many films these days that make it to the theater and you wonder just who the folks behind it knew to get it released. At the same time a decent thriller like this one goes unnoticed. But that's the beauty of DVD. Movies that could have gone unnoticed have a chance to be seen and this is one of those movies that deserve it.",1332806400,,3177,4.429794520547945

The reliance upon stale devices wouldn 't have been so humorous except there was no connection between them and the actual storyline. Just a jumbled mess of ideas and bad acting. I found no redeeming value in this one and I'm sorry I watched it all the way through hoping to find one. Topher needs a better vehicle and Martin Sheen must've needed a paycheck.

For the most part it's well acted and the pacing is what you would expect with car chases and fights dotted around every 15 minutes or so. Richard Gere is good as always even if the ""spy coming out of retirement"" routine is a little tired.

I wonder if The Double was written 20-30 years ago - the style is more reminiscent of the spy genre from that era than the Jack Bauer heroes of today. There's no sex, swearing, running around on cell phones, demanding to be connected with the President, kidnapping the daughter, and so forth. Overall it feels very small scale given that a Senator has just been murdered and there's just a couple of guys in the government working it out (who both report to the of the whole thing). There are some fairly ludicrous plot holes along the way which you just have to ignore to keep the disbelief suspended.

Still, it's a pretty enjoyable way to pass a couple of hours and doesn't deserve the horrible reviews it received. Although the last act gets a little old in the tooth, it reminds me of the golden years of this genre.

The upside is that Gere fans will get much time to have a close look at the man's soulfully arrogant face in his role as a retired CIA agent who has to cooperate with an FBI rookie because the bosses tell him to.
The downside is that the plot is so darn stupid and implausible, but I can't really tell you much about it if I don't want to give it away and get scolded. The old CIA guy and the young FBI guy have to look for a Russian mole cum assassin who was supposed to be dead since long. Somebody plays both sides.

4848937,2,B005NKIPWC,"First, don't watch the film's trailer. I am afraid it reveals too much about the film's storyline. But I don't know if the story of ""The Double"" is really good from the beginning. Perhaps you may enjoy yourself watching it if you have nothing else to do, but I think when you finish watching this, you may find yourself scratching your head.

Richard Gere is Paul Shepherdson, a retired agent. When a US senator is assassinated, Paul is called back into service by CIA director himself (Martin Sheen), who believes that a mysterious Soviet agent codenamed ""Cassius"" is back. Paul is ordered to track down the mysterious agent with a rookie FBI agent Geary (Topher Grace), who claims that he studied everything about Cassius. Even his master's thesis at Harvard was about him.

Thrillers that start out like this usually require suspension of disbelief, but the story of ""The Double,"" which I admit has potential for a gripping spy thriller, needs better treatment. I'm not talking about who or where ""Cassius"" is; I'm talking about the incredible motives of characters (including the mysterious killer) involved in this convoluted story that goes on and on. Also, the film fails to give us details of the investigation of the two agents. What we get is instead the genre's conventions.

""The Double"" is directed by Michael Brandt. Its screenplay is written by a writer team Derek Haas and Michael Brandt, both of whom are also co-writers of ""3:10 to Yuma"" (with Halsted Welles) and ""Wanted"" (with Chris Morgan). Sadly ""The Double"" has neither a character-driven drama of the former nor visuals of the latter.

4848952,3,B005NKIPWC,"I rarely expect much from a direct-to-video release but ""The Double"" surprised me. While it's not a great movie ""Double"" is a fairly clever spy thriller.

Richard Gere plays Paul Shepherdson a CIA agent called out of retirement when the assassin code named Cassius that he killed appears to be killing political targets again taking out a U.S. Senator. Paired with Ben Geary a young FBI agent and analyst (Topher Grace)to track down Cassius and find out what exactly is going on and what his mission is. As Sheperdson and Geary dig a little deeper they become convinced that, perhaps, Cassius has branched out to become a serial killer.

I've read many of the other reviews for this film and most of them complain about how preposterous the plot is and ho unrealistic the film is. Folks--it's a movie. It's no better or worse than a film like ""Salt"" (actually quite a good spy thriller with some interesting twists)and while it clearly didn't have quite the budget of that film the writer (with Derek Haas)-director Mark Brandt (""Wanted"", ""3:10 To Yuma"")does a fine job of staging the action and makes good use of a strong cast that includes Grace, Gere, Martin Sheen, Odette Annable and a solid string of supporting actors.

The Blu-ray comes with a couple of featurettes, commentary track from the director and the theatrical trailer.

Is it sometimes silly? Sure but then almost ALL spy thrillers can be pretty silly and preposterious at times which is WHY you have to suspend your disbelief. Once you get into ""The Double"" you'll enjoy both the performances and some of the clever twists although it's easy to see why the film went straight to video it also doesn't mean that the film is a complete disaster.

4848955,3,B005NKIPWC,"THE DOUBLE is a fairly entertaining thriller of the espionage genre that has an interesting idea.  Good story: flimsy writing. It is difficult to figure out for a while if this is a good cop/bad cop set up or if this is a throwback to Cold War times. Written by Derek Haas and director Michael Brandt it is less a complex maze of twists and turns that the viewer feels it should be than a mixed salad of CIA, FBI, leftover characters from the Cold War trying to figure out where the film is going.

The film opens with a view of a senator being murdered by a particular manner of cutting the throat that used to be the trademark of some Russian assassins, one in particular named Cassius.  But apparently retired CIA operative Paul Shepherdson (Richard Gere) killed that entire groups of assassins and it takes the intervention of a maverick Harvard grad turned FBI agent Ben Geary (Topher Grace) who did his thesis on Cassius to suggest that Cassius lives and is in Washington DC to kill CIA and FBI agents.  Fate pairs Shepherdson and Geary and the hunt begins with many men having their throats cut a la Cassius method until the evidence begins to fall together as to the truth behind it all. Telling more would destroy what little plot the film holds together.

Gere and Grace are both fine if not memorable and they get some assistance form actors such as Martin Sheen, Steven Boyer, Tamer Hassan, and Odette Annable (a refreshing find!). The dialogue is pretty much drowned out by the noisy musical score and the ambient noise of the action.  Not a bad movie, just not a memorable one.  It could use a bit of tidying up on the editing and the scoring and it might make sense.  Grady Harp, February 12",1328572800,3,1706,4.498381877022654

Topher Grace is great as the up and coming FBI kid who knows all about the man they are looking for.

A key plot twist is surprisingly revealed early on, indicating an even bigger twist is inevitable.
Director Michael Brandt keeps things moving briskly and the final twist, while a little far-fetched, brings a satisfactory conclusion.
Gere has aged well and gives a solid performance.  Grace, most noted as a comic actor, brings a youthful sincerity to his role.  Supporting roles are filled by Martin Sheen as the crusty CIA director; Stephen Moyer (TRUE BLOOD) as an imprisoned assassin who survived Gere's attack; Stana Katic (CASTLE) virtually wasted as a Russian hooker and Odette Yousman as Grace's librarian wife.

Is this an espionage thriller...tinged with remnants of hunts for cold-war Soviet moles and assassins? Well, Yes and No.

THE DOUBLE is an attempt by producer and co-writer Michael Brandt to update the spy thriller without trench coats and too many secret meetings. He throws in a great cast led by Gere: Topper Grace as the young FBI agent, Castle's Stana Katic as a Russian prostitute (don't blink - you will miss her performance) and Stephen Moyer of vampire fame as a scarred thug (and Cassius follower) who swallows batteries to get out of prison. He also throws in some propaganda about fake border police killing Mexicans.

His career has had ups and downs, and I don't know how he will be judged in cinema's history. But he has a charisma that is difficult to ignore, and you wish he could reach greater heights. This is what I felt when I watched ""The Double,"" an electrifying and intriguing film that will keep you glued to your seat until the very end.

The film opens with the assassination of US Senator Dennis Darden (Ed Kelly), who we briefly see earlier on TV arguing with another senator about Russia's resurgence. We then meet Paul Shepherdson (Richard Gere), a retired CIA agent who is an expert on an extremely dangerous Russian spy by the codename of Cassius, who is suspected to be the senator's assassin. Shepherdson is informed by Tom Highland (Martin Sheen) that he will be partnered with Ben Geary (Topher Grace), who happens to be an FBI expert on Cassius, too. Shepherdson objects this decision, because Geary's experience on Cassius is only on paper, and he doesn't have the instinct to read or understand the soviet assassin. After a while, as you probably guessed, they get to work together. But that is when the story takes a quick turn, and we very early get to know who the real Cassius is, which entirely changes the dynamic of the film, making us guess until the film's final frame.

I have always enjoyed great, non-formulaic, intelligent spy movies, and ""The Double"" is one of them. It truly gives you food for thought in regards to the people around us. The DVD has an audio commentary by writer-director Michael Brandt and writer-producer Derek Haas, and more. (USA, 2011, color, 98 min plus additional material).
