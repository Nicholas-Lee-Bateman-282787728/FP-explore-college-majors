When I saw another box of these I bought it up immediately thinking the whole thing would be different... I ended up returning it. Carol's great but this is an unnecessary release if you bought the 1st collection.

For those who bought the 22 disc Mega-set, you may want to consider this as Time-Life has added new shows to the bonus 7th disc that are not on that Mega-set, and not on the 6-disc set.
Note, Time Life has promised one more 6-disc set in the future called ""One More Time"" which will include Costco's disc 7, and discs 9, 15, 16, 17 & 18 from the 22 disc mega-set.
The only thing you will be missing are the 4 discs that are just bonus material, which include more cast & guest interviews, sketches from shows not included on discs 1-18, and two episodes of The Garry Moore Show.
Some of the bonus sketches from discs 19, 20 & 22 are on disc 7 of this set.

Double click to see what these cost today. I bought the 7-DVD set when it was $3 more than the 6-DVD set.

I'll admit, right here, right now, I do NOT buy these for the songs/singers; I buy them for the SKITS!
Comedy. Ah yes! Tim was a god in the 'sixties and 'seventies.

Now that Carol is headed toward 80; Vicki is MY age(63); Tim has outlived Harvey; and, many other that were on
the show are gone to their heavenly rewards, I can still laugh my head off at Tim ""THE DENTIST"" and the many
other gags he did on the show.

Get this one and the seven disc set, or just spring for the MEGA SET!

The disc contained three episodes.  First one had guest star Dick Van Dyke, but Harvey Korman was absent.  Second one had guest stars Bernadette Peters and Roddy McDowell, but no Tim Conway. Third episode had Sammy Davis Jr. as the guest star.  The shows were just okay.  There was one Mama's family sketch.  Thee was no Mrs. Wiggins and Tim Conway's old man character was also missing.  What I missed most was having a scene where Tim Conway made Harvey Korman laugh.",1457308800,,643,4.530434782608696
5424655,3,B00AGMT7MY,"Greeting Reviewer,
When I was younger, I enjoyed watching and experiencing the humor on The Carol Burnett Show.  So when the DVD version came out I purchased three of the season sets.  I must have viewed the program with more innocent eyes back then. When I started viewing the recorded DVD season series, I did not realize how much ""Adult"" content (PG-13) was seen on TV back then.  I am not a prude, but I feel a level of responsibility to filter what my young children view and absorb. So I gave a rating for Adult content of 4-star rating (PG-13) for adults, but for the family I give it a rating of 3-stars as it definitely is not (PG) for children.",1453420800,4,654,4.344262295081967

But the whole hour of each program wasn't funny, and while I suppose a DVD collection of whole episodes may be a must-have for a serious collector, it was a mistake for me. I bought it for my father as a humerous diversion to enjoy while he recovers from lung surgery. Shortly after he came home from the hospital the other day I opened it up and tried a couple of different discs, skipping around, looking for the good parts. My father didn't like having to do that - he doesn't have the patience or enough interest. He was happy when I gave up and let him go back to sports. My fault - I s/h chosen a best-of set rather than full episodes; instead I'm stuck with a barely touched collection he'll never watch.",1368057600,18,892,4.412121212121212
