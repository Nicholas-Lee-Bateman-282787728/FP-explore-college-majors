2453264,4,B000C65YRQ,"I was just looking at all the movies I had on VHS (and BETA, so help me) and this is one. I forgot how weird this one was and how I liked it.

Also look for ""Motel Hell."" A classic of the cheap and tacky horror genre: ""Meat's meat, and man's gotta eat!!""",1278633600,2,254,3.792452830188679
2453265,5,B000C65YRQ,"I like the concept of this movie fear as its different in all aspects and thats why I brought it. It's something different a psychic uses her inner senses to help police in an investigation but her life becomes entangled in the other killers mind and she is now involved, and is going to be his next victim. Unless she can find him out first, suspense is dynamite waiting for what's coming next and not knowing chilling and riveting so I rated this an A grade movie. Enjoy!",1275177600,,473,4.386363636363637
2453266,3,B000C65YRQ,"I watched Fear years ago and tried to find it within the UK, but film only released in America. Arrived within good time, but unfortunately Fear does not play from the start you have to scene selection Second scene and then rewind back, but not a problem. Really enjoyed Fear, just easy watching
Read the reviews on Parents - everyone saying how great it was and that Fear was okay. For me personally really disappointed with Parents. Not great storyline and really did not go anywhere. I got bored half way through as nothing really happened and was glad when it ended.

Dont mind though as now have my Film Fear and it was worth paying for it..",1265500800,,646,4.47457627118644
2453267,5,B000C65YRQ,"My original review is shown below . . .

First, I love Parents (5 starts) and own the original 1.33:1 Pioneer DVD release.  When I read the reviews (here at Amazon) that the Lions Gate re-release was actually in widescreen, I bought it.  The bad news is that Lions Gate simply chopped off the top and bottom of the 1.33:1 picture to make it fill a 16:9 screen.  So, you're actually getting less than the 1.33:1 version.  The Lions Gate people should be flogged!!!

It turns out that the Lions Gate release is actually what was shown in theaters.  So, I was wrong; my apologies to the people at Lions Gate.  I'm leaving this up so that other folks don't make the same mistake I did.  My thanks to Paul Rudoff for the info.",1265155200,,721,4.32089552238806
2453268,5,B000C65YRQ,"My stars are for ""Parents,"" as ""Fear"" is poorly written, poorly acted, and a complete waste of time.  ""Parents,"" on the other hand, is an overlooked gem of a movie.  It's quirky, kooky, and unpredictable.  The movie appears to be mainly from the child's point of view, and he's a weird, spooked sort of kid, so we wonder if the slightly creepy vibe we are getting about his parents are just his own feelings (as most kids feel their parents are weird) or if they really are different from the rest of the ""normal"" world.  The movie features some interesting cinematography and plays on the legendary status of the 50's as a time of wholesomeness and order.  I have been waiting for YEARS for this movie to come available on DVD and was so excited to see it finally made it! Even better, ""Parents"" was as good as I remembered.

The only downside to this DVD is the sound isn't too good, and the lead child tends to mumble...and there are no subtitles to help out.

The unexpected bonus to this DVD is that it is WIDESCREEN, not full-screen as stated on the box and descriptions.  And it is anamorphic to boot.",1257120000,,1108,4.4504950495049505
2453269,4,B000C65YRQ,"FEAR has a TV movie feel but it's actually somewhat above your average b-movie and Sheedy does a pretty good job with the material.  The antagonist and the storyline could have used a little more pep, but then it probably would have been even more like every other psycho-thriller.  It has some unique, if unlikely, aspects that pull me out of the movie a little.  Not that I totally discredit psychics, but the writer of this takes it to a new level that really could use something to give it a little more believability.  Still, this film has some tension at times.  Not worth the price of the set for it alone, however.  Now, same can't be said for PARENTS.  Truly, I bought this set for it alone and I was not disappointed.  I rented PARENTS when it first hit the video store and was blown away.  It made me seek out more black comedies.  It's really first rate and I was happy to find out it did hold up over the years.  The cast is great, the production design and storyline is terrific.  And as everyone has already stated, this film is in widesreen and looks mighty sweet.  NO COMPLAINTS.  I can't give this set 5 stars because I think FEAR is not worthy.  BUt if you can find this cheaper than the stated price, maybe $10 or so, then you're taking about a 5 star purchase.",1237075200,2,1281,4.323529411764706
2453270,5,B000C65YRQ,"More of the same to chime in with the other reviews: I was really happy to see ""Parents"" in this release after seeing the original DVD had been discontinued, and then happier yet when I saw that others had reported that it's widescreen.  Don't get nervous when you see the ""full screen, 1.33"" spec mistake, it's definitely widescreen enhanced and fills an HD set quite nicely.

""Fear"" is worth watching and good to have as a bonus, but ""Parents"" is a must-see / must-have movie.  The surreal 1950's suburbia, the meals, the suspense, the great ending  ---it's simply wonderful, and will leave you feeling good inside!",1228089600,,617,4.7924528301886795
2453271,5,B000C65YRQ,"I bought this double feature for PARENTS, but thoroughly enjoyed FEAR as well. I love Ally Sheedy (Man's Best Friend) enough to watch her in just about anything! Her role as Cayce Bridges, well-known psychic and author, was a real treat. She has made a career out of using her mental powers to assist police departments in tracking down assailents and (hopefully) rescuing victims. The idea of a psychic helping the police catch criminals is nothing new, but having a serial killer use his own psychic abilities to torment Cayce is definitely different! The interaction between Cayce and the ""Shadow Man"" is tense and frightening, especially when he decides to go after Cayce for real, instead of just playing twisted games with her. No one is safe! PARENTS is a tremendously wicked, jet-black comedy set in 1950s suburbia. Randy Quaid (Independence Day) and Mary Beth Hurt are the Laemles. They move to a new town w/ their 10yo son, Michael. Dad works at TOXICO, where he works on chemical defoliating agents. Mom is a perfectly prim housewife, always working in the kitchen on new and exciting meat recipes. Michael has a hard time at home, due to his suspicions about dear mom and dad. What does dad REALLY do all day at work? What KIND of meat is mom preparing? Michael also has trouble at his new school, where he draws macabre pictures and says some very disturbing things to his teacher, Miss Baxter. This causes the chain-smoking, school social-worker (played wonderfully by Sandy Dennis) to get involved. The darkness and dread  in PARENTS are perfectly in synch with the bleakest black humor I've seen since Dr. Strangelove! Bizarre, unsettling, and dreadfully funny, this movie is worth multiple viewings. I highly recommend this double bill...  P.S.- Yep, both movies are in widescreen, even though the box says full screen! No complaints here...",1209772800,14,1858,4.951923076923077
2453272,5,B000C65YRQ,"Just to chime in with the previous review--both movies are indeed widescreen, not full-screen. Even better, it's anamorphic widescreen (nice looking too.) Even the box states ""Full-Screen Version, thankfully the specs are wrong.  Much higher quality transfer than the original release of Parents a few years back.",1153267200,18,313,5.659574468085107

2453301,5,B000C65YRQ,"I'm not basing this review on the content--I like ""Fear"" very well--many others don't and won't.  After all, it is a horror film--one actually which may prove scary or disturbing for some. (It's not the popular ""campy"" type of horror film--nor, is it ""...so bad it's funny!"") I consider ""Fear"" a fine thriller, too. Ally Sheedy and Lauren Hutton in films always prove memorable, too.

Putting aside personal tastes, this is the copy to obtain for pro-quality transfer to DVD,. I own a previous copy on DVD (mastered poorly by another company--one likely proving ""fly by night""). I proved keenly disappointed with that video transfer--problematic VHS is far better. (Poor kinescope-quality (filming of TV screens), even?!) I proved puzzled by its poor quality--deceived and ""tricked,"" even: DVD traditionally proves something which can't be returned--given it's not unplayable.

This instead is the pro quality transfer we expect from DVD for Hollywood's films. It's from Lionsgate, a company actually talented at creating DVDs, BluRays, and films. Unfortunately, the rights were originally sold to a company which couldn't deliver: Lionsgate rectifies that!

Kudos for reissuing this, Lionsgate! Many of us desire more reissues like this--some other fine works from the '80s, '90s, and '00s were hamstrung by poor promotion, poor distribution, Indie-nature, etc., too. After all, the digital storage and archiving necessary to keep such works around isn't that big a deal!: Increasingly, that will prove the case. I can't fathom why Hollywood disagrees: I think that they hate customers!",1410566400,3,1587,5.412955465587045

2453331,5,B000C65YRQ,"Fear is watchable, but forgettable. For film history buffs, it's one of the last film scores written by Henry Mancini. Parents, on the other hand, is a film that can give kids nightmares, so be forewarned. I first rented it on VHS many years ago, and the upgrade to digital widescreen (even tho the package says full screen, it IS widescreen) makes it worth getting the DVD. Randy Quaid is truly sinister. A smoking deal for the money.",1379635200,4,435,4.589743589743589
2453332,5,B000C65YRQ,"""Fear"" is such an awesome, creepy film.  I love Ally Sheedy in this film.  I seen the film on television in 1996, and was totally creeped out by the psychic elements.  For years I thought this film was called ""Fear Me"", but I couldn't find it anywhere.  I decided to get on IMDB & look at Ally Sheedy's filmography & found that it was just called ""FEAR"".  I ordered the film right away & love it even more now than I did back in 1996.  It's great to see Michael O'Keefe (Roseanne), & Lauren Hutton in the film, as well.

As for ""PARENTS""....extremely boring.  I've tried 3 times to get through the film, and I just can't.  Not much on Randy Quaid being in a horror film.  It isn't a good fit...AT ALL!!!

Five Stars for ""FEAR"" & Zero Stars for ""PARENTS"".
