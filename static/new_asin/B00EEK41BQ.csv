8604792,4,B00EEK41BQ,"How does Enzo D'Alo's 'Pinocchio' stand up to the Disney classic?  Comparisons can be invidious, yet must be made.  To begin with, D'Alo abandons Disney's central European aesthetic, setting the story, as it properly should be, in Italy. Geppeto is no longer a Bavarian toymaker, but a humble carpenter, while Pinocchio, hardly the passive foil as portrayed in Disney, is an incorrigible rascal. For better or worse, this version adheres more closely to Collodi's original narrative, reconstructing such sundry episodes as the money tree, and Pinocchio's susequent trial and imprisonment, both of which Disney did well enough without.  On the whole, one does miss Disney's cozy warmth and Sunday school sentiment, the magical ambience of Geppeto's toyshop, such great character turns as Stromboli and Jiminy Cricket, and the sheer drama of the climactic sequence with Monstro the Whale - which D'Alo passes over rather lightly.
And yet, D'Alo cannot be easily dismissed; if in the end, it's all a bit hectic, still there's an energy, a peculiarly italianate 'brio' to this Pinocchio, from the  marvelously fluid animation to the brilliant visual design, with colors run amok a la Bozzetto or Luzzati/Giannini. One must also mention the singularly infectious score by the late Lucio Dalla, to whom D'Alo pays touching tribute; stick around for the end credits.",1390089600,,1359,5.277777777777778
