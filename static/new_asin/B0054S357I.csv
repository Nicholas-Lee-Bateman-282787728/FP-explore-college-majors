Fred McMurray and Claudette Colbert is great. They reprised their roles after The Egg and I and should have made more films like these. Great Entertainment and fun for the family. Arrived from Amazon a little late due the weather but Amazon stood behind tracking the movie and assured me it was coming.",1398643200,8,418,4.662162162162162

4570724,5,B0054S357I,"Claudette and Fred make, once again, a fun couple in this great family movie. If you loved them in The Egg and I, you will like this one.",1369958400,9,137,3.9285714285714284
4570725,5,B0054S357I,"I saw this movie years ago when I was quite young and fell in love with it.  It's funny, charming...just a good old flick.  Back in the days when people had high moral standards, which by today's point of view may seem antiquated and out of date I would suggest that antiques are often viewed of high value.  And so, that's my view.",1364515200,19,332,4.238095238095238
4570726,5,B0054S357I,"I was unexpectedly surprised while viewing ""Family Honeymoon"" when I realized that it is a film that I remembered from my childhood, which I had enjoyed well, but had virtually disappeared from TV telecasting. It is a joy for me to have found this missing gem and am pleased that I, on  a whim, decided to buy it. The pairing of Claudette Colbert, a wonderfully versatile actress who could successfully tackle drama and comedy, and Fred MacMurray, was always a winning combination. This film is funny and sentimental. The children will steal your hearts and the love story is like no other. The DVD has been beautifully remastered. It views as though it were a new film, clear and sharp. The audio quality is as clear and sharp as well. I recommend this film for family viewing....the content has nothing that will make parents uncomfortable while watching with their children, as some more recent ""comedies"" tend to do when foul material has been inserted into the story line. So watch as one couple make the tough decision of what to do with the children when their honeymoon plans suddenly go awry!",1350518400,26,1101,4.7643979057591626
8456973,5,B0054S357I,"The critics were mixed (just like the critics of ""Maid of Salem""), but this was actually a wonderful comedy and we enjoyed the many scenes filmed at the Grand Canyon which was unusual way back in the early 1940's when most movies were done at the Hollywood studios. So skip reading the bad reviews and enjoy a lovely comedy which I thought is even nicer than ""The Egg and I"".
One of the 7 films that Claudette Ciolbert and Fred MacMurray made together.",1524787200,,452,4.457831325301205
