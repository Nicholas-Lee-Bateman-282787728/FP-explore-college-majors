713802,1,6303651879,Blu-ray has been out for 12 years now so why is this film still only available in standard definition DVD? How hard can it be to put out a good version? I really like the movie which is all the more reason it is so frustrating we have been stuck with this low quality version for so long. I watched the VHS a long time ago and it just seems that in 2016 we should have a format that vastly surpasses it.,1477267200,2,403,3.926829268292683
713803,5,6303651879,"My favorite movie of all time. No movie has ever touched me the way this film did. I stumbled on it accidentally and it has left a lasting impression on me for years.

713804,1,6303651879,"To echo some of the other reviews, this is a real gem of a film and while not a great commercial success, it's very disappointing that the DVD release is so bad, technically speaking.  The film was released to cinemas with a full DTS 6 channel soundtrack and yet the DVD contains only a 2-channel MONO soundtrack (WHY... for the love of all things digital... just WHY?).  It's really too bad, because the film has a fabulous Dave Grusin soundtrack and a great opening song by Marc Cohn (which incidentally does not exist in any format outside of this film - it's conspicuously absent from the Soundtrack CD as well). Indeed, the picture is full-frame (1.33:1) when the original theatrical version was a 1.85:1 aspect ratio, but what's even worse is the picture quality is quite terrible, even for DVD.  Washed out inconsistent color, blocky, blurry picture, and it looks like there was little attempt to even clean dirt off of the print that the transfer was made from.  Yikes!

If this is the only way you can see it, then go for it because the film itself is really quite the little gem (keep those tissues handy though, I'm warning you!).  That being said it really deserves a much better treatment.  I can only hope that Universal will take another look at it and release it on Blu-ray someday!",1468022400,6,1298,4.6173913043478265

714310,5,6303651879,"I remember renting the VHS video of this when I was about 11 years old. I  didn't even hear about this movie until I have seen a preview of it when I used to watch ""Major Payne"" on VHS and that why it made me want to go out and rent this movie. I cried like a baby at the very end. I had bought 2 copies of the DVD. One for my home library, and the other to give to the school my mom used to teach at. I am having 2 DVD-R copies of this movie made just in case it gets lent out and never returned. $2.95 for a movie this old on Amazon.com is not bad at all. The song ""My Great Escape"" by Marc Cohn is so beautiful that I wish that there was a soundtrack to this movie.  A story about friendship, wisdom, and learning about how to let go of someone you love. I highly recommend it to people who haven't seen this movie yet. But be careful because there might be some scenes and a few foul words in this movie that might not be appropriate for young children. Joseph Mazzello and Brad Renfro are 2 brilliant actors. R.I.P. (Rest in Piece) Mr. Renfro. You Will Be Missed. Peter Smith If you enjoyed this movie, I would also recommend, ""The Mighty"", and ""Simon Birch"".",1382140800,,1164,4.012931034482759
714311,5,6303651879,"Powerful, engaging, funny, heartfelt, and most importantly true.  This movie is what real friendship, courage, and adversity are all about. It's about climbing a mountain and falling down it, hitting every rock on the way, only inches before you would've reached its peak. Yet, this movie is about standing tall on the mountain and never coming off.  There is no better Aids movie and the acting is great. There are moments that make you feel uncomfortable and question "" why would they do that"", but the characters and story thrawt any uncomfortableness. You can find yourself talking hours about life and what it means afterwards, and it's a movie that will live with you the rest of your life!",1381276800,,696,4.840336134453781

714313,5,6303651879,"Reading about this film, one would anticipate a simple family-oriented Afternoon Special about a child with AIDS. But the quality of the acting in every single role (guided by a sure-handed director) elevates this small gem of a film into a moving reflection on the power of love to literally transform us. It also reminds us of the loss we suffered in the tragically early death of Brad Renfro. Just as in THE CLIENT and APT PUPIL, he demonstrates yet again that he had all the potential of another James Dean or Montgomery Cliff.",1379894400,,531,4.659574468085107

714316,5,6303651879,This is an hard to find movie in the stores. For only 7 dollars hard to pass up. The movie revolves around two friends one who is HIV positive through an blood transfusion.

714318,5,6303651879,"This poignant film has a good storyline, and I used it to help teach high school students about AIDS and the heartbreak of losing someone to the disease.",1370390400,,153,4.5
714319,4,6303651879,"This film while dated was truly a timelss story about the very deepest commitment of friendship that could teach us all something truly important we may have lost the sense of along the way. The character Brad Renfo plays, Erik represents the very essence of a truly decent human being. But hes just like every other kid in the begining. Facing the same fears and misgivings that existed in the 80s and early 90s about AIDS. Back then people knew so little about it and how it could be contracted. Erik is just as misinformed as anyone, thinking at the onset that if this young boy who lives next door has the disease then he must be a homosexual, and that he him self could be in danger of contracting the disease even in a causal conversation through a fence between him self and the stricken and shunned boy next door. None the less they become very close friends and Erik learns to become a strong protector of his stricken friend at all costs. Their bond is deep and loving, and the two of them set out on an adventure across 1600 miles of forests, rivers and roads in the hopes of finding a cure for AIDS. This is a believable and touching story that will move you and open your heart. Its a wonderful experience to see what the bond of a loving friendship can do. I had only a minor gripe about this film and that is that at times the music is a bit overly dramatic and sometimes a bit too hokey and AWW SHUCKS in its mood. Other than that this film is one everyone should see because it is a very moving experience.",1367884800,,1523,4.291666666666667
714380,5,6303651879,"This is an incredible movie. Amazon is the only place I could find it. It's about two young boys who befriend each other. One of the boys (joseph mazzelo) has a blood Bourne blood disease that he inherited from a blood transfusion. The story carries on with these two brave boys trying to find ""the cure"".",1367452800,,305,4.464285714285714
714381,4,6303651879,"The Cure is a very unique and touching drama from Children of The Corn director, Peter Horton. The film takes plays early on in the AIDS crisis, before there were effective drugs, in a time when it was thought that only homosexuals and drug addicts had it. Dexter (Joe Mazzello) is picked on to the point where he can't go to school and the only one who will talk to him is Erik. (Brad Renfro) While the film wants you to see Erik as pure and open minded, the truth is he's a loner who I don't think really understood the origins of the disease and why the other kids picked on Dexter. Both Mazzello and Renfro give outstanding performance for what must of been a hard film to work on, especially at such a young age. Horton defiantly made the right choice in selecting two young actors, who had been in major films prior to The Cure. An inexperienced cast probably wouldn't have gotten as involved in the role as these two did. Overall, the story is strong, the acting is top notch, and it's definitely a tearjerker, that's well worth the price of admission.",1361577600,3,1059,4.408163265306122

They decide, together, to find a cure for AIDS.  One trial involves candy, and lots of it.  Another involves tasting every combination of wild plant they can find.

Even Brad Renfro does a good job too - although I got annoyed with his language.  One thing I noticed is that the picture on the cover of the DVD is not in the movie anywhere that I have seen which leads me to believe that the movie was edited from the original version.

714483,1,6303651879,"So I have been searching for this movie for years. I remembered it as being a special story about two children one having HIV and the other showing him love despite what others may think of the boy. I remember crying and thinking about how special of a friendship they had. So I requested blockbuster to order it for me and forgot to go pick it up. I finally thought duh Amazon. Where my experience with the seller was amazing the movie was short of being amazing. We only had the movie in 20 minutes and the mother of one of the little boy with HIV comes in the house and calls him a little SOB! I know she is ""playing"" around with him but come on. Then the language from the kids was HORRIBLE. I have an 11 year old daughter that I wanted to have watch this movie for the morals that I thought she would learn from it. However after the first 5 minutes I was on edge and she was closing her ears. After about 10 minutes I thought well maybe its worth pushing through but after about 20 minutes it was just way too much. Between the behaviour of the kids, stealing, launguage, fighting and throwing a rock at a bully as the bully was LEAVING it was nothing like I thought it was.

714485,5,6303651879,"The Cure is a deeply moving account of a tough, unhappy teenage boy living in a pretty dysfunctional home, relating to a younger neighbor who has contracted AIDS from a blood transfusion. As a counselor and teacher of children for many years, the film for me depicts something I've witnessed often, but is not part of our general image of teenage boys--the capacity to demonstrate sensitivity and compassion.  The terrible need of the little kid next door inspired this quality in the older boy, a need he responded to courageously in spite of the harassment of boys who seem more characteristic of the general view of young boys. Essentially, this is an inspiring story about love, sacrificial love, and I think even young viewers would be moved by it.  JOHN KETTLEWELL",1255478400,6,770,4.870229007633588

714487,5,6303651879,Older movie but when I saw something on TV the other day I was reminded of the story and how great it was. I ordered a copy from Amazon right away as it being old it might not be available down the years. I received the DVD in perfect shape and no order problems just like always. What a great story. I watched it the first for several years and I still was moved by it. Both the child actors grew into well respected adult actors and continue to make films. Do I want to spoil the story for you? I will tell you that it involves how close two boys from different lives can become such good friends and the older one protecting his younger friend. A very moving story.,1250726400,3,668,4.106870229007634

1. The ""good guy"", Erik throws a big rock at the back of the head of a bully after the bully apologized, that blow could have been deadly.

2. Erik steals $300 from the guys that gave them a ride.

3. Dexter later cut his own hand, threatening to give them HIV to keep the stolen money.

This movie could have been so much better, kids deserve better role models than that. It is however a great story about friendship no doubt.",1247529600,,494,4.114583333333333
714489,4,6303651879,"""The Cure"" is one of the most moving films I have seen in several years. Joseph Mazzello and the late Brad Renfro deliver excellent performances as their respective characters Dexter (Mazzello) and Erik (Renfro).  Also worthwhile is Annabella Sciorra's performance as Linda (Dexter's mom).  I found the movie online by accident, and was instantly taken with the story.

A movie like this one could not be made today because of the technological advances society has undergone since 1995.  It would be nearly impossible for two teenagers to run away from home and sail down the Mississippi without being found via GPS, cell phone, or similar divices.  However, when the movie is viewed from a mid-1990s perspective, those issues are not bothersome.  Mazzello's heartwarming scene about the questions of life and death as well as the sadness Renfro portrays after Dexter's death are worth the price of the film.

I am thoroughly convinced after watching this film that Joe Mazzello and Brad Renfro are two of the most accomplished actors of the 1990s.  They bring the story to life, causing the viewer to believe in Erik and Dexter's quest to find the cure for AIDS and save the latter's life.

Unfortunately, the DVD does not live up to the exceptional acting.  As other reviewers have noted, the transfer is FULL SCREEN (1:33:1) and in MONO.  I urge the reader to seek out the LaserDisc version, which was released in WIDESCREEN and has DIGITAL STEREO sound.  This film is far more enjoyable in widescreen, as the 1:85:1 aspect ratio allows the characters breathing room.  The digital stereo sound naturally brings out elements of dialogue and music that are missed in mono.

Even with the poor DVD transfer, I highly recommended ""The Cure"" for anyone who believes in the power of friendship and hope.

714490,5,6303651879,"I really enjoyed watching this film, ""The Cure."" The acting was very good, especially Brad Renfro (""The Client"" ""Tom and Huck"") as Erik and Joseph Mazzello (""Jurassic Park"" ""Simon Birch"") as Dexter. However, all the major actors and actresses played their parts well.

The film was not cheezy. There were a few scenes I think were overdone, (ex: riding a shopping card down a very steep hill) and one or two that were non sequitur, but I won't complain too much. Compared with many U.S. films created since 1990, this film actually makes some sense.

The theme of the film was remarkably well-conveyed, the friendship developed between Dexter and Erik heartwarminging, and use of symbols (esp. Erik's shoe) fairly creative.

I don't want to give away any scenes in the major plot. However, I think this film is certainly one that children and adults alike can both enjoy (although the language of a few scenes might worry some conservative parents).

More importantly, the film does not preach yet conveys a few major ideas that some people (especially teenagers) back in 1995 might not have been certain about.

1. AIDS is not transferable through the air (i.e. it is not like smallpox or even the common cold but rather much more like tetnus - except with no cure or preventative shot).

2. Anyone can contract AIDS, including children through blood transfusions with contaminated blood.

3. People with AIDS, like anyone else, still are people and still have feelings, including the desire to have friends.",1237334400,5,1509,4.940711462450593

1990s and 21st century motion-picture phenomenon.  His presence

in this movie is so REALISTIC and life-life that you forget that

he is acting.  He was pivotal in carrying this movie.  How so?

May I add that Joe's axiom for acting is simply:  ""Just make it look Real!"" He achieved this to a stellar degree in ""The Cure,"" and also in the later fare: ""Simon Birch"".  Incredible acting, and I know good acting, for I was in a film in the early 1990s and also wrote the musical

score for it.  No, I am not going to name-drop.

The Cure juxtaposes 2 boys of different social/geographical/educational genres together and in this movie a friendship is unexpectedly

forged and may I add that it is a friendship of rare mutual-concern, honest caring, and warm affection. No matter how many times I watch it, tears always come to my eyes in the final 20 minutes of this film.

714661,5,6303651879,"For unknown reasons this beautiful masterpiece didn't get well-deserved recognition and has been vastly under-appreciated by many American movie critics. So it's easy to understand that I've met lots of troubles trying to find this movie. Finally I watched it and it was so beautiful, sincere and poignant that for the first time in my life I watched one movie five times in one week after getting the tape. The story is focused on the friendship between two young boys Erik and Dexter, eleven and twelve years old, who are very different from each other but they are becoming the best (and only) friends. The beauty and sincerity of their friendship have been shown in the Cure so sincere and naturally as it has never been before. There are so many beautiful, heartfelt and poignant scenes (particularly on the river), which strike the heart and can't leave any human indifferent to them. The movie also is full of incredibly powerful and emotional symbolism, (particularly strong with Erik's shoe) which also greatly increases visual impression from such beautiful work. The story, written by Robert Kuhn, is well written and on the contrary to overwhelming majority of modern Hollywood's products practically every scene, every phrase and every sentence in the movie is meaningful and bring something important about characters and relations between them. Peter Horton, who as I know had no major experience in movie directing before, showed his great abilities and talents in this sphere. The cinematography is also superb with perfectly selected locations for the movie, but the most important is perfect acting, which with all above mentioned makes The Cure one of the best movies ever. Both Brad Renfro as Erik and Joseph Mazello as Dexter created wonderful atmosphere of sincere friendship and magnificent chemistry between two main characters. Only one this movie (I haven't seen most of their other works) is enough to name them as one of the best actors of their generation. Annabelle Sciorra also give a terrific performance as Dexter's mother. It's terribly sad that such talented actors didn't get wide recognition, while numerous overrated stars enjoy enormous publicity and huge salaries. Finally it would be unfair not to mention amazing soundtrack written by David Grusin, and terrific Mark Cohn's song (one of the best songs that I've ever heard in the movies) My Great Escape. So all that I can say about The Cure is one simple word - great. At any point of view this movie is a beautiful, heartfelt and inspiring work of all people involved in making of this masterpiece. I have to credit all those people who put their hearts and souls into the movie and Universal Pictures, which among numerous formulaic commercial projects has found a way to make such a beautiful movie. But such movie so rarely come to movie theaters that very often studios themselves don't realize what gem they have made that they're unable to provide respective marketing campaign. The only one minor drawback about The Cure too me is its too short length (only 97 minutes).

I don't want to write more about the movie because it's simply impossible to put its beauty and sincerity into words, so if you have any opportunity for watching The Cure, rent it or buy it and you wouldn't be disappointed.

This movie portrays youthful innocence and fun but more importantly the values of friendship, loyalty, compassion, and love.  And we all can learn about the importance of relationships in life, especially in the face of adversity.  The two boys were totally convincing in their parts and never seemed to be acting.

If it isn't bad enough that this film is actually ABOUT one of the most heart-wrenching scenarios that films can present: children sick and dying, then couple it with neglectful parenting and deeply emotional male bonding and what you've got is one helluva a strong weeper.

Joseph Mazzello (Jurassic Park) has AIDS. He got it from a blood transfusion. His mother (Isabelle Sciorra) is devoted and loving of him. She also manages to extend her heart to her son's new found friend - Brad Renfro. Renfro's character has taken this outcast boy under his wing. Mazzello's character has become a pariah because most of the townspeople are ignorant of the realities of AIDS.

From the onset, you know that Mazzello and Renfro are going to be big friends. But they become friends in the ol' Tom and Huck sense of the word - they're real devoted friends - the kind of friends you only have when you're a kid. It's a no holds barred, non-sexual type of male bonding going on here.

I won't tell you any more about this film, but this...a girlfriend of mine watched this movie with me. She used an entire Kleenex box as we watched it.

714849,5,6303651879,"I was lucky enough to have first seen this movie at a special screening in San Diego in April of 1995. The theater was filled with only high school students (from around the country who were attending a journalism convention) and there was not one dry eye by the end of the credits. Even the 'jocks' were *gasp* sobbing! The next day I was able to talk with director Peter Horton which helped me come to appreciate this wonderful story even more. I've recommended this movie to family and friends and not a single person I know who has seen it has regretted it.
The cast does a superb job. All aspects of the story are believable...from the antics of eleven-year-old boys to the touching warmth of Dexter's relationship with his mom. We all know a Dexter or an Erik. We don't have to know someone living with AIDS or HIV or someone who has been bullied. It is the spirit of the two boys that Joseph and Brad are able to capture, and the incredible friendship they forge, that rings true and touches the hearts of those who have been affected by this film.
The sountrack is also amazing. Dave Grusin worked his magic with the score. Marc Cohn's 'Great Escape' is a perfect fit. My only beef is that Marc never recorded a full version of the song and it doesn't show up on the cd, even if only in its unfinished form.
Unfortunately, this film never got a wide theater release. The topic of a young child with AIDS seemed to be too 'controversial' at the time. It saw limited release on VHS and has never been released on DVD. That more people have not been able to see this film is a great injustice for which I am frustrated and greatly saddened. I feel strongly that Universal Studios has failed miserably to promote the jewel they have in this movie.
This is one of my favorite movies. If I had to pick my top ten, this one would be included. It is the simplicity with which this story is told; the warmth with which the subject is handled; and in the end, it is the bond between two friends who are told by society that they shouldn't be, that makes this film one of the best.
To anyone who worked on this film who may see this: Thank you.",1089504000,28,2141,4.315136476426799

714852,5,6303651879,"(contains spoilers)
'The Cure', from 1995, was Joseph Mazzello's next major non TV role after 'The River Wild'.  Brad Renfro also features in this his second major role, the first one of which was 'The Client'.
These days of course both actors are now in their 20s so this is the young Joe Mazzello and young Brad Renfro we're discussing :)  The Cure is one of Joseph Mazzello's finest roles along with his performance in Jurassic Park but of course everybody does a superb job with this film.
There are no fancy visual effects or major stunts in this film, just a simple straight story of two boys, Dexter, who has AIDS, and Erik.  They befriend each other through the garden fence and ""hang out"" a lot.  Erik takes advantage of Dexter initially but the pair bond well on screen (even though Joseph and Brad didn't get along together off-screen).  They eventually decide to travel to New Orleans after reading a tabloid article about a doctor who claims to have found a cure for AIDS.  They meet colourful characters on the way but never reach New Orleans, instead Dexter's health takes a turn for the worse forcing Erik to take him back home.  Sadly, Dexter dies from his illness but it opens up some really heartfelt scenes towards the movie's end which make the previous 90mins or so very heartwarming.
A very well recommended film that is not just worthy of rental; it's worthy of a place in your video collection.  Joe & Brad both carry the film very well, Joseph Mazzello was, and still is, a very natural actor even at this young age.  If you never rent/import anything else ever, do it for this movie, an all-time underrated classic movie.  I've only had it three weeks and I've watched it four times already :)  Rating:  5 out of 5.",1086652800,,1742,4.565916398713826

I only watched half the movie and didn't write the paper. This year, since I have to retake P.E., I've chosen to stand up, not only because I now have a friend living with AIDS, but because it's important.

714936,5,6303651879,"Joseph Mazzello is 11-year-old Dexter. Dexter received the HIV virus when he was very young from a blood transfusion. He now has AIDS. And his only friend is his single mother, Linda, played by Annabella Sciorra.
Brad Renfro is Erik. Erik is a kid that is sort of a loner at school. All the other kids at the school call him bad names relating to homosexuals. They also walk on the other side of the hall when he's walking by because Dexter moved in behind his house. He has a drunk for a mother and his father lives in New Orleans with his 23-year-old girlfriend.
When summer vacation starts Dexter and Erik start up a friendship and they soon become best friends. They do fun things together and Dexter starts living his childhood as it should be lived. In their playing around they come up with unique ways for how to cure Dexter, but of course none of them work. One day they were at the supermarket and find a tabloid that says the cure for AIDS was found by a backwoods doctor in New Orleans. They tell Dexter's mom about this but she doesn't believe it.
Erik's mom Gail finds out that they two kids are playing with each other. She is misinformed about AIDS so she tells Erik that he is not to play with Dexter and that she is sending him to summer camp. So Erik got to thinking that he and Dexter could go and find the cure in New Orleans so he could be aloud to play with Dexter. They run away from their home of Stillwater, Minnesota and sail down the St. Croix and Mississippi rivers to find the cure.
This is a wonderful tale of true friendship. Erik and Dexter have a friendship more powerful than most people will ever experience in their lifetime. ""The Cure"" touches you deep inside and just makes you want to do something for the real children who are suffering like Dexter.
Joseph Mazzello is great in this movie. This actor is one in a million. Never once in this movie do you think of him as a child actor, you think of him as a real person. I have to say the same for Brad Renfro. Mazzello is the greatest actor of all time and Renfro is up there also.
I recommend that everyone see this movie at least once. It will appeal to everybody. It is a movie for the family despite it's PG-13 rating; that's just for some bad words. I would give this movie 100 stars if I could, but I can only give it five, and it sure earns them.",1020297600,41,2344,4.2460850111856825

However, I found the movie fairly predictable, including  the evolving relationship between the two boys.  Ho hum.  It's definitely  not ""one of the greatest movies ever made"" as some of the other  reviews would have it, nor is it even close.
In spite of elements of plot  mediocrity, though, the movie does somehow manage to illuminate the  undefinable beauty of a child's life, and the undiluted tragedy of a  child's death, in a very authentic and moving manner.
I will confess that  I never tire of ""happily-ever-after"" endings, and I was rather  expecting one for this movie.  But I don't think anyone will walk away  smiling.  The conclusion is a stark dose of reality, and quite sad.",944006400,2,918,4.825806451612904

By the time we were finished watching, everyone not  only understood how serious the disease is, but they had gained compassion  for the plight of the AIDS victim and his family.  Even the most limited  student was able to understand and appreciate the symbols used in the  movie.  I followed the viewing with a writing assignment and was amazed at  the way the movie inspired the students to record and share their thoughts.
