8445918,2,B004X1Z15G,"This movie was like so  many others.  Nothing unusual in it's story line.  Acting was average, which for a seemingly home made movie, is actually saying a lot.  Also there are no subtitles like almost every cheaply made movie.  Not too sure why not as it is practically free to add them and only takes a few hours.",1370044800,,314,4.344827586206897
