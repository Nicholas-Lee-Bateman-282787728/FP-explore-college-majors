8095294,3,B000C20VZK,"After paying $20 plus shipping, I found that this version is ONLY available in a British English audio.  Probably the best dubbing I've seen for a Chinese film - but still takes too much away from the movie in not providing the original soundtrack.  The movie itself is not bad - but is probably more interesting (cleverly worded & expressed) in the original soundtrack.  3 stars (average) for this version.  (I would have preferred to pay the $40 for the ""special edition"" that includes original soundtrack - though that price is too high, considering a top-quality DVD in China costs $2 to $3!",1211846400,,595,4.747572815533981
