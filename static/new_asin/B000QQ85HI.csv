2839185,4,B000QQ85HI,"Let's cut to the chase and get the negatives out of the way first . . . . .

1. This collection doesn't include any of the Warner Brothers detective series of the late 1950s/early1960s.

2. The audio/visual quality of the episodes is variable.

This is a rather astounding collection of television detective shows from the 1950s and 1960s, with episodes that have apparently slipped into the public domain.  Anyone familiar with DVD releases of public domain material knows that very little of the Warner Brothers catalog is in the public domain (the reason their detective shows are not represented here), and companies releasing public domain material almost never have access to the original film elements (negatives or master prints) and usually have to rely on whatever 16 millimeter prints that are available (or video masters thereof) as the source.  So while the audio/visual presentation is not up to the standards typically found on releases from the major studios, most of the episodes in this collection are highly watchable.

There are some very popular and well known shows on this set including the original 1950s version of ""Dragnet,"" ""Burke's Law,"" and ""Mannix,"" but where this set really shines is the inclusion of episodes from a number of obscure and hard-to-find series, several of which are making their commercial DVD debuts on this set.  I was even surprised to see a few shows represented from the old DuMont Network which ceased operation in the mid-1950s; much of that network's programming is lost to the ages, so finding even a few episodes is like finding buried treasure.  You'll get a chance to see Charles Bronson star in a weekly series, ""Man with a Camera,"" as well as TV's first policewoman series, ""Decoy"" (with Beverly Garland), that was broadcast nearly two decades before the Angie Dickinson series.  I was delighted to see a couple of episodes of ""Checkmate"" (starring Sebastian Cabot, Anthony George and Doug McClure) from the early 1960s, with future Spielberg collaborator Johnny (John) Williams contributing a great opening/closing theme, and guest stars like Peter Lorre and James Whitmore.  It's always fun to look for guest stars in these older shows and you'll see people like Lee Marvin in an episode of ""Dragnet,"" Euro film star Peter Van Eyck in ""Code Three,"" and even talk show host Larry King makes a brief appearance in ""Miami Undercover.""

A few of the shows like ""The Adventures of Fu Manchu"" and ""Alfred Hitchcock Presents"" are a bit out of place on this collection, but the vast majority of the shows are in keeping with the TV detectives theme.  Probably the only obvious omission of a series in this set that has a few public domain episodes is ""Peter Gunn;"" it was one of the most influential series of the genre and really should have been included here.  Some of the shows are represented by a single episode, while ""Dragnet"" has 25 episodes included in the set, and Jack Webb's ""Sergeant Joe Friday"" is appropriately featured on the front cover of the box.  Incidentally, when ""Dragnet"" was initially broadcast, it alternated every other week with ""Gang Busters"" which also has some episodes included.

Those who like vintage television crime series will appreciate this release, but the style and tone of the shows included are so broad that anyone interested in programming from television's first two decades is sure to find something to like in this collection.  It's not perfect, but there's simply nothing else currently on the market that offers as many episodes and the broad variety of shows represented in a single collection as does ""Best of TV Detectives"" except, perhaps, Mill Creek's companion&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Ultimate-TV-Westerns-150-Episodes/dp/B000EOR0BY/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Ultimate TV Westerns - 150 Episodes</a>&nbsp;collection.

My rating is closer to **** &  due to the variable visual quality of the episodes.  Those who typically purchase official, studio sanctioned releases may be put off by the lesser visual quality, but those familiar with public domain material will know exactly what to expect.",1183852800,156,4156,5.231927710843373
2839186,5,B000QQ85HI,"Another great value from Mill Creek. 150 episodes of some of the greatest detective shows of all time. Dragnet, Gang Busters, Racket Squad, Hitchcock, Dick Tracy, the list goes on and on. I remember many of these shows from the 50's and 60's, and they're still as entertaining as ever.

2839187,5,B000QQ85HI,"This is a great, fun collection of old TV shows from the 50's and early 60's that have fallen into the public domain. That means no copyrights-anyone can sell them. I have almost everything this company - Mill Creek Entertainment has put out. They cobble together collections of movies and TV shows- mostly bootlegged from old VHS tapes and sometimes they put a copyrighted logo on the lower right hand of the screen so people will not rip off their bootlegs and sell them too! But it is a good cheap way to get lots of great stuff that no one else is going to bother to put out in a better quality because it can just be copied and sold by anyone. This is a lot of material that is obscure to well known that may have been rerun in the 70's and maybe not, I know I saw some of them when I was a kid. The quality varies from poor to almost perfect but always wonderful to see for a bunch of old TV. If it looks a little cheesy it does not matter because it is all so enjoyable and also what you see is often all that is left of these old TV shows. A lot of what was on TV then was not saved at all so we are lucky we have it. Lots of them were shot live and the only way they had to save them then was to point a 16 MM film camera at a TV screen and film it in the studio when the shows went out live. This was called a Kinescope. Some ""look"" like old TV shows but others remind me of old black and white movies. Some even have a real ""noir"" quality that is priceless. You can see some stars before they got ""big"" in movies and some struggling unknowns that stayed that way as well as some veteran actors from the movies who made a living in TV when they began to fade. Can't wait for Vol. 2 of this, the wonderful thing about this stuff is it kind of saves it for people to enjoy when otherwise it is just gone and lost to the public. All these old shows have a character and a mood we do not see today. Lap this up as well as all the other stuff these guys put out. If these shows were to come out in some kind of ""official"" release it would be ridiculously  expensive for a small amount of shows put out in multiple high priced volumes like all the other overpriced TV DVD fair, so enjoy getting something good for almost nothing.

However, with this I was and have been entertained for hours watching old detective shows that for the most part I have never heard of.  Even the ones that I have, such as Dragnet, were still unique, especially in some of the subjects that they dealt with.  I was really surprised that child abduction and sexual abuse were some of the topics handled on this show all the way back in the early 50's and that they were handled in such a manner as to be almost a public service for the viewers back then.  They hold up surprisingly well.
Most of the episodes were in fair enough condition that they weren't unpleasant to watch.  Watch for such gems as Checkmate (the first episode on these discs has Peter Lorre as a guest star) and also the show that has Boris Karloff in it.<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Best-of-TV-Detectives-52-Episodes/dp/B000QQJOGE/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Best of TV Detectives - 52 Episodes</a>",1297036800,6,1115,5.104395604395604

2839238,5,B000QQ85HI,"First, I disagree that this is a haphazard collection. It isn't. By far, it is a smorgasborg of mystery/detective shows --many I never saw in reruns before. One nice surprise was DECOY with Beverly Garland. She's an intelligent undercover policewoman in New York. Great writting, excellent acting. Black/white, pre-dates Angie Dickinson's show. Maybe that's way it didn't have a long run. For this alone, this collection was tops. However, there is so much more. Dragnet from about 1952-on. Several shows have embedded cigarrette commercials. Some shows are corny oldies. But considering what is on television now--these are refreshing. ""I'm THE LAW"" was like that, corny but good. A couple of Mannix episodes. And others we have yet to see. But just from the first few disks, I had to share that this is an EXCELLENT BUY. This is the only resource for a Boris Karloff detective character who worked for Scotland Yard, Col. Marsh--I think. Terrific. I tried to locate more, was done in England, but have seen no success yet. It's detective Boris Karloff, shows a whimsical side of him, not frequently captured on film.
The DVDs are recorded on both sides, that to me is a minus. It tends to make the life of a DVD shorter if you don't take care. But the capture footage was enhanced, editted and carefully produced in digital. A few of the really old shows needed some sound enhancements. Mill Creek truly took the pains and efforts. Thank God for that. This is good product. Mom has been sitting down with a DVD a day. She's in her seventies and is really coming along fine, learning how to work the DVD player all by herself--the proper incentive in hand. For the money, the collection, and the high degree of digitizing these old shows---EXCELLENT. I hope to find more on Boris Karloff the Detective, and even more on DECOY with Beverly Garland. It is amazing after all these decades, how some human situations truly have not changed. Merry Christmas, all.",1229817600,9,1959,4.816023738872404

After reading some of the warnings about the video/audio quality I was holding my breath as I popped in the first disc . . but I found it to be exactly what you'd reasonably expect from vintage 1950s-1970s TV . . it was like stepping back in time and then some . . I'm not quite old enough to remember some of the 1950s stuff first run, but I remember watching a lot of this stuff in reruns and even first run with shows like Mannix.  The series ""Checkmate"" was a great ""find"" on this set -- I had never heard of it before, but my husband, who is a few years old than me, said, 'so I bet it doesn't have any Checkmate episodes does it...' -- I checked, and sure enough there are two.  And they're really good.  My favorites so far I think....so much so I am now considering purchasing the two DVDs that have the best of Season 1 and Season 2 of that series.

But back to the specifics about this collection.  What a DEAL ... to get this many golden old detective shows for less than $20.00 . . it's just a bargain no matter how you look at it.  Loving the series 'Decoy' too with Beverly Garland. . . who knew?!

Let me first point out that all of the stuff on this DVD is public domain and 80% of it could be pulled from YouTube. There are 3 episodes of Dragnet on here that are mislabled.. in fact they don't exist in any episode guide. ""The Big Ante"" (The Big Hands), ""The Big Score (The Big Gap), and ""The Big Send-off"" (The Big Bounce) are obviously made up names so as to make this look as though this collection had something new.

In any case, some of these shows are very obscure (try finding info on the internet!!) so just having them available in any form is fine by me.
Of the shows I've watched, what surprises me most is how fresh they seem (most are from the 50's remember) and you can definately see the birth of today's detective shows in these programmes.
If you're a fan of CSI, Law & Order etc why not give these a try - as long as you don't expect super slick action and flashy camera tricks these should still give plenty of entertainment and act as a history lesson in tv detective shows.

Although some of these episodes can be found in other low-priced sets, there are many series sampled here that have never been released on DVD before.  Here are the individual episodes you'll find on the disk:

The Adventures of Dr. Fu Manchu (1956)

Sir Dennis Nayland-Smith (Lester Matthews) attempts to prevent the evil Dr. Fu Manchu (Glen Gordon) from achieving world domination.  Episodes included in this package are:  ""Death Ships of Fu Manchu"" and ""Prisoner of Fu Manchu""

The Adventures of Ellery Queen (1950)

This ill-fated Dumont network series, featuring Richard Hart as the titular detective, is represented by a single episode: ""The Hanging Acrobat""

Alfred Hitchcock Presents (1955):

A curious choice for inclusion in this set, this series' premise had little to do with detective work.  The episodes included can be found in many other public domain offerings:  ""The Cheney Vase"" (starring Darren McGavin and Carolyn Jones) and ""The Sorcerer's Apprentice"" (starring Brandon de Wilde and Diana Dors).

Burke's Law (1963)

Gene Barry starred as Amos Burke, an independently wealthy Chief of Detectives for the Los Angeles police force.  The episode included in this set is ""Who Killed Jason Shaw.""

The Cases of Eddie Drake (1952)

Originally nine episodes of this series, which starred journeyman actor Dan Haggerty, were filmed for CBS, but were never aired.  Dumont purchased the group, filmed four additional episodes and released the series to the unsuspecting public in 1952. The episode presented here, ""Shoot the Works"" shows why CBS choose to cut their losses.

Checkmate (1960)

Doug McClure, Anthony George and Sebastian Cabot starred in this series about a high-priced San Francisco detective agency.  Episodes included in this package are ""Human Touch"" and ""Nice Guys Finish Last"".

Code 3 (1957)

The disc stops at several places and starts again after 20-30 seconds and goes i slowmotion for a minute or two. I have bought many DVD;s by Amazon. This time the box was damaged so I can not close it. It has never happened before. Amazon and other sellers most do more carefully packing especially when the items go abroad.
