3141052,5,B00158K1B4,"BEAUTIFUL TRANSFER! Nice war time musical. Carmen shows her comedy side in this film and of course her over the top outfits! I won't go into the story line. If you're a Miranda fan, you'll enjoy this FOX TECHNICOLOR MUSICAL. Michael O'SHEA looks a little too old and his uniform is a few sizes too small...to bad they didn't cast PERRY COMO in this leading role. Also O'SHEA is not the best singer either...most all other cast members do a great job...EXCEPT...PHIL SILVERS who is loud and ANNOYING!
Carmen has two colorful production numbers, the first, typical Miranda, the second and last is Carmen in a totally different appearance THAN WE HAVE SEEN IN THE PAST, a different 'short'costume than usual showing more leg...the lighting in this number is somewhat over the top...however, looks great in this pristine transfer. Only problem I had is in the EXTRA FEATURES: The ""STILL GALLERY"" feature in my copy doesn't allow my access to it...used two different DVD players and both had the same problem. The Film, Scenes, Trailer, and the SUPERB DOCUMENTARY are no problem. The documentary is in four parts...great interviews, vintage still photos and live performances, both candids and her FOX production numbers make this one of the best Documentaries out there...the Documentary is worth the price of this DVD ALONE! I give it 5 STARS...the 'still' problem may be in MY COPY ONLY...(don't let this deter you from puchasing this film). A MUST HAVE for the CARMEN MIRANDA FAN! THANK YOU FOX!!!",1215475200,8,1496,4.940476190476191

8257798,3,B00158K1B4,"The best feature of this screwy musical is the standout Technicolor.  The image is crisp and clear and of course all the musical costumes are colorful.  The plot is the usual silliness so prevalent in the old musicals.  Watch it for the song and dance numbers.  No one actor/actress seems to be the main star.  Each person gets a share of the limelight.  Carmen Miranda goes full throttle as Carmen Miranda.  Phil Silvers is the whole Sergeant Bilko character a full decade before he was Bilko on television.  I'm not familiar with Vivian Blaine at all but she did well -- good singer.  I remember Michael O'Shea only from his early 1950s TV sitcom, ""It's a Great Life"".  Sheila Ryan does a good job as the snarky ""other woman"" you love to hate.  Several years later she appeared in some of Gene Autry's last western movies and his television shows where she met and married sidekick Pat Buttram.  Perry Como has a small speaking role and sings two pleasant songs.

Overall, the plot derives from Mickey and Judy's musicals that begin with, ""Gee, gang, let's fix this place up and put on a show.""  This time it's ""Gee gang, let's fix up this rundown plantation and put on a show for the soldiers.""

There is an 83-minute documentary about Carmen Miranda which I have yet to watch, so cannot comment on it.",1445558400,,1305,4.564655172413793
8257799,4,B00158K1B4,"The plot is more than a little odd, three cousins who don't know each other learn that they have inherited a plantation in Georgia.  Instead of the vast riches they hope, they are met with property and inheritance taxes they can't pay and a huge dilapidated mess of a mansion they can't afford to fix.  Cue a passing Staff Sgt. Rocky Fulton (Michael O'Shea), who wants them to turn the place into housing for their military wives.  They fix the joint then decide to put on a show!  This gives Perry Como, Phil Silvers, Vivian Blaine, and Carmen Miranda an excuse to sing and dance on a makeshift dance floor with bad lighting that puts most of the dancers in the dark.  The running gag used throughout has an anomaly with Carmen Miranda's teeth that allows her to pick up radio waves; it comes in handy during a mock battle.  Except for a rushed ending, not bad for its type, they churned out musicals like this by the dozens.  And despite the claim that this is a Cole Porter musical, most of the forgettable songs used throughout were written by others, he only wrote the title tune.  The movie was loosely based on one of his musicals starring Ethel Merman.  I bought it because it featured Carmen Miranda (who once again got shoved out of the limelight by Vivian Blaine).",1441065600,,1275,4.508695652173913

Something For The Boys could have been better; but then again it could have been far worse. The musical numbers are actually very well done except for one incredibly dated and embarrassing exception with Phil Silvers doing a short number in partial blackface. Ouch! On the brighter side again, the plot moves along nicely and this is essentially a light-hearted musical that you can enjoy. The choreography impressed me in those song and dance numbers; and I liked the cinematography as well.

When the action starts we quickly meet three cousins who have inherited a dilapidated and termite infested old Southern plantation called Magnolia Manor. The three cousins are street salesman Harry Hart (Phil Silvers), factory worker Chiquita Hart (Carmen Miranda) and entertainer Blossom Hart (Vivian Blaine). The three of them drop everything to go to Kentucky where they meet the lawyer who takes them to the ""estate"" and tells them they're on their own. They have no money to fix the place up; and so things look pretty bleak.

However, almost at the same time, Sergeant Laddie Green (Perry Como) and Sergeant Rocky Fulton (Michael O'Shea) drive up in their jeep and inform the three cousins that they want to buy the house, fix it up and use it as a boarding house for the wives of the military personnel training nearby. Needless to say, the cousins are thrilled; and they accept the offer. Part of the deal involves the wives of the military men putting on a show to raise money so that the Harts and the military can have enough money to make the old place shine again. Naturally, the house gets the royal treatment and sooner than you can blink they transform it into a fine home with beautiful grounds.

But, of course, other complications arise. Rocky and Blossom fall for each other pretty quickly; and that can be tough when his fiance Melanie Walker (Sheila Ryan) shows up. Rocky no longer loves Melanie; she's just as pushy, rude and demanding as ever. Blossom is so upset she won't give Rocky a chance to explain. In addition, we get the unnecessary plot complication that because of the factory she worked in for so long, Chiquita has carborundum in her teeth that make her a human radio transmitter. (This has got to be the WACKIEST complication I've ever seen.)

The plot can go many different places from here and I don't want to spoil it for you. Will they be able to use Chiquita's teeth to their advantage as a radio signal transmitter? What about Melanie--will she be able to split up Blossom and Rocky for good? And what about the war maneuvers that the military personnel perform on the grounds of the plantation--to what extent do they interfere with life in the house? Will Harry be able to keep it all ""hush hush"" about the gambling action he has going on without the military knowing? Watch and find out! You'll also enjoy the documentary about Carmen Miranda entitled ""The Girl From Rio.""

Overall, Something For The Boys is a better than average musical with some great moments--but it also has some other moments I'd rather forget. Perry Como sings wonderfully but please don't ask him to act--he can't; and his ""performance"" in this picture proves it. However, the rest of what we get is mostly pretty good; and I do recommend this movie for fans of the actors in it. People who like light-hearted classic musicals will enjoy this film as well.",1243209600,3,3385,4.7482993197278915
8257804,4,B00158K1B4,"Something for the Boys,while aimed directly at our fighting boys during WW2,surprsingly still offers up some delightful kicks for audiences now; going on over 60 years later!
The story involves three totally different people but all cousins:Harry Hart(Phil Silvers),Blossom Hart(Vivian Blaine) and Chaquita Hart(Carmen Miranda).Phil is a sidewalk salesman,Vivian a singer and Carmen works in a factory. All get summoned to a lawyers office to collect an inheritance  but they have never met each other before. It is delightful listening to Carmen explain her Hart ""heritage"" to a curious Vivian. I won't spoil it but I will say that her father was a Fuller Brush salesman from Terre Haute,Indiana. They all get driven out to a run and broken down old southern mansion/plantation. None of them have any substantial funds between them in order to fix the place up,let alone live there. Enter their saviours,the U.S.Army. Seems one Sgt. Fulton and his men had been scouting the mansion as a place to billet the married servicemens' wives. All come to a quick agreement on terms and elbow grease is applied liberally by both the Harts and the army to get the place into shape. To earn funds for the Hart cousins as part of the deal,the wives agree to help perform shows for the troops. Blaine and O'Shea are starting to get real cozy when an ex society high-hat acquaintance of O'Shea's of the female persuasion by the name of Melanie(Sheila Ryan),drops by. She immediately splits up Blaine from O'Shea and tries to take things over. But Blaine and Miranda get even with the busy body by introducing Ryan to some cock-eyed kitchen gadgets which splatter her with egg yoke and half drown her. Ryan runs out and into the arms of an army lieutenant,crying and complaining. At the same time a group of single GIs are caught leaving after some heavy gambling action Silvers had provided for them. The lieutenant declares the home off limits. Next day the army drives through the area doing maneuvers. O'Shea(part of the blue army) drops by trying to get right with Blaine but the house is taken over by the red army and,unable to get out,he is captured. Silvers comes up with a novel way to get a signal to the blue army regarding O'Sheas' predicament. Miranda,from the beginning of the picture,has had the uncanny ability to receive radio signals,stemming it turns out,from carborundum in her teeth. This substance is in the grinders from the factory she worked in. Silvers rigs up a contraption(you have to see this to believe it),plugs Miranda into a low volt current and voila they are able to home in on the army transmitting frequency. They can send and receive and they get their SOS out to them. The entire group stalls the red army departure just long enough for them to be captured and all ends happily.
The plot weaves its' way along very well and there is very little let up or dead spots,which keeps the interest level up. Carmen Miranda AGAIN steals every scene she appears in and this little force of nature entrances again and again. She sings with Silvers and Blaine in a joint number and has two solos with ""Batuka Nero"" and ""The Samba"".Vivian Blaine was a good looker,had a very pleasant singing voice and was a solid player in the 20th Century stock of players.""Atlanta,Ga"" is a song most  definitely directed to all the GIs in the movie theatre. It's a sizzler with Blaine vocalizing while her back up dancers wow,dressed in polka dot bow ties and tight fitting body stockings. Silvers really shows a much better range in this movie(as compared to""Four Jills and a Jeep"") and his  talent is shown at its best. He has a wonderful number near the end of the film called ""Southland"" as he tries to stall the red army from leaving the house. It's played very over the top,spoofing southern songs and throwing in a bit of Al Jolson to boot! Funny stuff. Perry Como is cast as a Sgt. Green and this is an appropriate moniker as he makes his film debut here. He has two good and solid sentimental ballads to sing;""I Wish we Didnt have to say Goodnight"" and ""I'm Going Nowhere With You"".
Technically,as with most of the other musicals 20th Century have released as of late,this one has been transferred very well. The print is very clear and the colours are quite vivid. Included on this DVD are still galleries,posters,trailers, and a very special addition:A documentary on Carmen Miranda called ""The Girl From Rio"".It is an excellent overview of Carmen and her career and highly recommended watching for all Miranda fans.
In conclusion I urge all fans of musicals of the 30s and 40s to get this flick. It has a well paced plot,all the stars are on top of their collective games,the music is good and it has that wonderful documentary on Carmen. This DVD definitely has something for...everyone!",1233014400,3,4800,4.773766546329723
8257805,4,B00158K1B4,"""Something for the Boys"" is the second film released in 1944 in which Carmen Miranda was the star attraction instead of supporting one of the Fox blonde superstars, Betty Grable and Alice Faye. This was a Col Porter stage musical, no less, but Fox managed to turn into one of their somewhat vulgar technicolour confections with the associated good and bad points.

The good points include:

- Miranda herself, with a larger part than usual and very funny as a human radio transmitter
- spectacular technicolour and sound
- Sheila Ryan, very entertaining as a pretentious socialite
- Michael O'Shea as a relaxed leading man for the pleasant Vivian Blaine

The bad points include:

- Phil Silvers, trying too hard to be funny and overacting painfully
- Perry Como, who could sing while asleep. He has absolutely zero screen presence
- some of the worst taste costumes imaginable for Miranda, Blaine and the chorus girls

The print of the film is superb and the extras excellent including production and marketing stills and the original trailer. Best of all though, is that the DVD includes a 4 part documentary on Miranda herself. If at times, the historians repeat themselves and the editing inadvertantly highlights this, we still get a detailed understanding of Miranda's importance and the tragedy behind her eventual demise.  Miles Kreuger appears and, as usual, towers above all the other historians with his intelligent comments and clear diction. He is invaluable.

This is an excellent package because of the documentary and good value if purchased as part of the Carmen Miranda Collection.",1218499200,3,1598,5.053231939163498
