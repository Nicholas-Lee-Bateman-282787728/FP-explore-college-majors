Only wish they would tie up a few more mysteries rather than introducing one new engima after another. This is one of the most intelligent and compelling series to ever be put on television. It is a class of its own.",1212883200,,311,5.0

I put in the first disc and was hooked until the last disc of season 3...  now... must... have... more... LOST

Amazing show, great acting, seat of your pants suspense.  You will want to go to sleep when the current episode ends, you will want to so bad, then they end it with a cliff hanger and you KNOW that the next episode is just calling your name ""watch me, watch me... I know it's 3:45 in the morning, but you want to watch me""  You get more questions than answers, but that is the beauty of LOST.

I fought it for so so long, but then Amazon had Seasons 1-3 for $79.99 and I could not pass up the price.",1212364800,,707,3.943661971830986
3171780,5,B0017HZZP0,Incredible! Wondrous! Groundbreaking! These are just a few of the words that describe the series LOST. I've been watching seasons 1-3 on DVD for the first time since I originally viewed them on network TV and even though I remember most of the details the series still manages to blow me away. It's one part action thriller. One part science fiction. One part character(s) exposition. One part philosophy discussion. And finally one part well written drama. In short it's a TV classic years in the making.,1212019200,,505,4.883720930232558
3171781,5,B0017HZZP0,I love the show. The DVD's provide incite to the show and let you review parts missed while viewing.,1212019200,,100,4.315789473684211
3171782,5,B0017HZZP0,"<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Lost/dp/B0017HZZP0/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Lost</a>&nbsp;is a great show, although if you're here to buy this TV DVD collection I don't have to tell you that.  You're probably a hardcore fan already.  But for the few people that haven't gotten into Lost yet, I can  honestly say this is one of the few programs I can see somebody watching from beginning to end without any prior experience.  It just draws you in.

It took me a while to get into Lost.  By season II my interest was peaked. And by now, I'm just as hooked as everybody else.  Watching these on DVD is better than watching the episodes on TV or even online.  First of all, all the DVD episodes are presented in the same widescreen format that was only available when watching over HD before.  The regular airings on network television was not the full widescreen but instead a chopped down version that's not nearly as great to look at.

These DVDs also allow you to watch and re-watch these episodes whenever you please.  For those who are new to Lost that is a bigger deal than it may appear at first.  There's nothing better than being able to watch these shows back to back as well as re-watch the tricky parts and try to figure out all the sub-plots.  :)  The extras really help you get into it too, giving you great background and juicy info that will suck you in even further.  In fact the extras alone are worth the price of admission for any Lost junkie.

There's another benefit to these disks.  Unlike those who have to wait for the next season or show to air based upon the VERY STRANGE and DISJOINTED practice of them delaying new episodes and taking long breaks between seasons, you can pace yourself through these seasons.  Discover the story on your own time and avoid the annoying schedules set by network television or the next writer's strike.

To list all of the episode plot-lines isn't really something you need me to do here.  What I can tell you is at a high level what to expect from each of the seasons and what goodies are included.  Because this collection is really rich with special features, and that's really the value of getting this set.  Even if you've seen the episodes already, I can see alot of people still buying these disks for that alone.

<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Lost-The-Complete-First-Season/dp/B00005JNOG/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Lost - The Complete First Season</a>

As you might expect, the first season set includes the Pilot episode that has become almost TV legend at this point.  The very diverse set of characters is introduced little by little through their interactions but more so through the flashbacks.  We get to learn about the fateful events that brought them all together and how they cope with the stress of being ... well, Lost.  :)

Audio commentaries for the ""Pilot"" episode by the producers gives you a background into how the pilot got off the ground and filmed.  There are other audio commentaries that are episode specific for ""Walkabout,"" ""The Moth,"" and ""Hearts and Minds.""

Most of the special features are included on the seventh disk, which is devoted to them. ""The Genesis of Lost"" shows us how everything started and evolved. ""Welcome to Oahu: The Making of The Pilot"" is standard making-of fare.  ""Designing a Disaster"" is a kind of featurette about how they filmed the amazing crash site from the ""Pilot.""

""Before They Were Lost"" goes into the show's casting, which will really surprise a lot of people.  This show is amazingly cast, and when you see this you will be even more amazed at how they did it.  Audition footage is included too.  :)

""Lost: On Location"" is a group of behind-the-scenes extras that cover some filming sequences.  This is very useful for aspiring film-makers and just general movie junkies.

There are also some flashbacks from the season finale and over a dozen deleted scenes.

Also included are some less useful, though still attention keeping extras.  Among them are:
- ""The Art of Matthew Fox"" about photography he did during the ""Pilot."" Nice for people like me who like photography, but not for Lost purists.
- ""Lost@Comicon"" is footage from Comicon and the actors who were there promoting the show
- ""Onset with Jimmy Kimmel"" feels like a shameless network plug and shows some worthless and probably staged shenanigans
- ""Live from the Museum of Television and Radio"" is another bit of self-promotion that includes very little
- ""Backstage with Driveshaft"" takes a look at Charlie and his fictitious band
- ""Bloopers from the Set"" is a gag reel that really didn't even need to be here.  Some people are into that stuff though.

Season 2 is a very direct continuation of the ending of the first season.  It does start to give the show more of a ""24"" like feel though.  Mysteries are solved but more questions are raised than answered.  And while we get a lot of background on key characters like Kate and Jack, it takes us a VERY long time to get there.  There are a lot of riddles and red herrings thrown in to make you think and throw you off.  Still, every episode has a value when you see things develop over all the seasons of the show.

Audio commentaries are available for some episodes, including ""Man of Science, Man of Faith,"" ""What Kate Did,"" ""The 23rd Psalm,"" ""The Whole Truth"" and ""Dave.""

They seem to have added more episode commentaries to make up for less on the special features disk. Disc seven includes:
- ""Fire and Water: Anatomy of an Episode"" a ""making of an episode"" featurette
- ""Lost: On Location"" a contrast of episodes shot on location instead of a studio
- ""The World According to Sawyer"" which is a character  profile of Sawyer and his sarcastic comments
- ""The Lost Flashbacks"" with three never before seen flashbacks
- Over a dozen deleted scenes
- Another annoying ""Lost Bloopers"" extra
- A ""Channel 4 UK Promo"" which is a slow-motion music video type of comercial
- ""Lost Connections""- a featurette about character inter-connections
- ""Mysteries, Theories and Conspiracies"" helps fuel the fire on the many unanswered questions
- ""Secrets from the Hatch"" is all about the hatch and how it was thought up

<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Lost-The-Complete-Third-Season/dp/B000P6YNSE/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Lost - The Complete Third Season</a>

Like the second season, Lost's third season was originally split into two sections with one more popular than the other.  I still think all the episodes were important, though some do move faster than others.  And speaking of ""the others"" they really start to take center stage in this season.

""Lost Book Club"" goes through the parallels between plot elements and the unraveling storylines ""Lost: On Location"" and ""Lost in a Day"" are ""making-of"" features that go into filming and it's challenges.

There is a one-on-one with star Matthew Fox and a featurette on ""the others."" As usual we have the audio commentaries and deleted scenes.  We also again have the bloopers which we could have done without.

""Cast in Clay: The Toys of Todd McFarlane"" goes into making toys for the show.  ""The Next Level: Inside the Video Game"" shows the making of the LOST game by Ubisoft.

Conclusion

Each season stands on its own as a tremedous work of TV.  Some will complain about the tail end of season two or the beginning half to season 3, but the more you watch and learn the more it all comes together.  This is a great show and a great set that is definitely worth owning.  You also save some money on the set, which is nice too.

Enjoy!",1210550400,44,7827,4.998454404945904
3171783,5,B0017HZZP0,"I have seen every episode of this show (I actually started watching it after season 1 ended and had to rent the first season to catch up so that I could watch season 2 as it aired), and I LOVE IT!  It keeps you on your feet, and you always want to know what is going to happen next...making you come back for more.  Plus, the price is just right!  You can't beat the price for what you are getting!  If you are a LOST fan, or you want to get into the show, this is the best deal you will get on the DVD's.  Don't let this deal pass you by, because you won't find it anywhere else!",1209427200,12,580,3.8403361344537816

3171785,2,B0017HZZP0,"I purchased LOST seasons 1 -3 from TOPNOTCH.  All the discs, except one, had a glitch that had to be fastforwarded over.  In addition, all discs had two horizontal somewhat blurry lines - one at the top and one at the bottom that covered two-three inches of the screen.  I paid $80 for all three seasons so I guess you get what you pay for.",1231632000,,340,4.2
3171786,5,B0017HZZP0,"Every episode of this unique series is captivating; the theme is multi-faceted, and the character development is both spellbinding and intriguing. Watching the series on television can be frustrating because of commercials, and the waiting periods between seasons are agonizing. I bought the 3 seasons combo not only to satisfy my addiction, but to help solidify the key points and clues scattered throughout the series' episodes. It's been as enjoyable the second time through as was the first, even taking into account the foreknowledge of the ""surprises"" that inevitably pop up each week.

This is a must-have for the serious LOST fan. I resisted the urge to buy Season 4 due to the inflated cost for the one season's episodes compared to the first three.  However, after season five is ended on television, my addiction will probably force me to buy 4 and 5 as well, even at the increase in cost.",1231459200,,900,4.9144736842105265
3171787,5,B0017HZZP0,My grown children (38 & 40) have been watching this series from the beginning and want to keep it on DVD. They both insisted I watch it from the beginning because the story builds on previous episodes.  I purchased the series to give to my son and attached strings (that I be allowed to borrow it).  I have watched the first season and can't wait to get started on season two.  It is very fast moving and intricate so it requires concentration.  I am very pleased with the outcome.,1231286400,,481,4.370786516853933
3171788,5,B0017HZZP0,I received the DVD's today - well ahead of the expected arrival date and in excellent condition. I will enjoy these for months to come. Great job!!,1231200000,,147,4.481481481481482
3171789,5,B0017HZZP0,"I bought Lost-The Complete Seasons 1-3 back in May of 2008 as a ""Deal of the Day"".  I just looked on back orders to see what I paid for it... $99.99. Today, December 8, 2008 it is $58.99. Ha Ha...what a difference a day makes!! BUT..I'll tell you this, I am still glad I bought it for almost double the price...except for one little problem I had with my order.

I had never watched Lost on TV...but I had heard rave reviews from friends. I am an Amazon Addict who has to ""check out deals"" whenever I'm on line. So , I saw ,thought the price was great, and I thought I would treat myself and my family.

My daughter saw the box, opened it, and we sat down to watch the 1st episode.  After 6 episodes, with snacks and bathroom breaks, we finally pryed ourselves away from the TV, but we kept talking about everything we had watched. The next day was a repeat and I was upset my daughter had to go back to school on the following day.

This went on whenever we had time ,we had a ""Lost Marathon"". Until we opened the 3rd season. We were so excited to see what the next episode would reveal. The episode called ""Not in Portland"" started and suddenly the disc stopped. My DVD player made a noise. I kept trying to forward and it stayed on this one part where Juliet is sitting on a beach that you think is the Island, but is really Miami. I kept hitting buttons until it went forward just a little and stopped again. I took it out of the DVD player to see if it was scratched, washed it, and continued to Freak Out!! I tryed it again the next day...same darn thing.

I went to ""Help"" on my order on Amazon. There is a section that allows you to talk to a Customer Service Representative.  I told her what happened and because it was sold in a ""bundle"" I had to return ALL 3 seasons and another ""bundle"" was sent back to me.  I simply took the same box the new one was sent in, put the return sticker on, and brought it to the Post Office, at no cost to me.  We had to wait a few days but then we made popcorn, put on our jammies, and guess what? THAT ONE skipped, or froze, or whatever it was called, in the same EXACT place. I went to the phone and tried to explain to another Customer Rep who wanted me to do the exact same thing.

Now, I KNOW I am not the ONLY person in the USA this has happened to...the odds are against it. This time I was angry. I told the Rep that I wanted JUST the 3rd Season that was NOT in this bundle.  She agreed because she looked and said there were several others who had reported this problem.
They sent the 3rd Season and told me just to keep the one I had. I just tossed it and we waited for the new package to arrive. Thank God , it was OK and we watched the rest of  the season. But, it was awful knowing we had to wait until 12/9/2008 to see the last season!

I have been buying from Amazon since 2001 and have had almost no problems. I am disabled and this is the very best way for me to shop. I bet if I bought this at a place like Best Buy, they would say too damn bad.  You opened the seal..it's YOUR problem, but  I have never had any problem with anything I have bought that there is a problem with that their Customer Rep Dept doesn't handle in the nicest and fastest possible way.

To end this review where I am actually reviewing the product : This is a FANTASTIC Series!!  And you people, who are getting the Deal of a Lifetime, getting it at this price, Amazon is actually giving you a Christmas present!!  I have the 4th Season preordered but guess what we have been watching the last 2 weeks?  Yup...another Lost Marathon..I
LOVE this show and I LOVE Amazon for the deals and the ease of seeing , getting to read reviews before I buy, and for the respect and ease of returns.  You just can't lose buying this !! Have Fun!!",1228694400,,3770,4.075778078484438
3171790,5,B0017HZZP0,"The DVD's shipped quickly and were excellant quality.  Lost is a character driven series with constant twists and turns that keeps the viewer wondering what will happen next, while eagerly anticipating the next episode.  Just when you think you have it all figured out...you realize you knew nothing at all...lol.  The only complaint I have is that the 5-7 seasons DVD's will not be released for a long, long, long time.  That seems like an eternity when you're waiting to find out what happens next.  It's like reading an entire book except the last chapter or two.  I love the Lost series and recommend it.

I was so intrigued to see what it was supposed to be one of the best television series, What a disappointment!!, I watched the entire season 1 and still didn't understand why LOST was so admired, so I jumped season 2, and tried season 3 to see if something has happened, and I was so amazed to see that not a thing happened. LOST is so incredible boring, there's no action at all, no brain action, This is absolutely NOT a thinking person's notion of stimulating entertainment, If I were you, I would watch the first and last episode and I sware you won't miss a thing. They will be lost forever. I even thought that I should be hight (drugged) to get it, But i was tired of loosing my time here. Writers must be so astonished to see how people see this nonsense show, with no answers.. just question after question and I'm pretty sure they will come with ridiculous answers at the end. DON'T WASTE YOUR TIME with this garbage. Try Prison Break which is an absolute 10!!! with great acting, plot and superb suspense.

Then, my college roommate this year insisted that I sit down and watch the Pilot, which had been posted online.

Let's just say, I spent the next 3 weeks or so going through all three seasons.

The great thing about Lost is that not only is it's location beautiful, it's storyline exciting, and it's acting incredible, but the characters portrayed on the show are both complex and unexpectedly moving.

The rabbit hole only gets deeper, and yes, at times, it will try your patience, but if you stick with it through the first three seasons and make it into 4, you will be rewarded.  Everyone with an imagination and a passion for storytelling should experience Lost.  It really is the best show ever put on TV.

You will want to go to sleep when the current episode ends, you will want to so bad, then they end it with a cliff hanger and you KNOW that the next episode is just calling your name ""watch me, watch me... I know it's 3:45 in the morning, but you want to watch me""  You get more questions than answers, but that is the beauty of LOST.

I fought it for so so long, but then Amazon had Seasons 1-3 for $79.99 and I could not pass up the price.",1212364800,,707,3.943661971830986
3406277,5,B0017HZZP0,Incredible! Wondrous! Groundbreaking! These are just a few of the words that describe the series LOST. I've been watching seasons 1-3 on DVD for the first time since I originally viewed them on network TV and even though I remember most of the details the series still manages to blow me away. It's one part action thriller. One part science fiction. One part character(s) exposition. One part philosophy discussion. And finally one part well written drama. In short it's a TV classic years in the making.,1212019200,,505,4.883720930232558
3406278,5,B0017HZZP0,I love the show. The DVD's provide incite to the show and let you review parts missed while viewing.,1212019200,,100,4.315789473684211
3406279,5,B0017HZZP0,"<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Lost/dp/B0017HZZP0/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Lost</a>&nbsp;is a great show, although if you're here to buy this TV DVD collection I don't have to tell you that.  You're probably a hardcore fan already.  But for the few people that haven't gotten into Lost yet, I can  honestly say this is one of the few programs I can see somebody watching from beginning to end without any prior experience.  It just draws you in.

It took me a while to get into Lost.  By season II my interest was peaked. And by now, I'm just as hooked as everybody else.  Watching these on DVD is better than watching the episodes on TV or even online.  First of all, all the DVD episodes are presented in the same widescreen format that was only available when watching over HD before.  The regular airings on network television was not the full widescreen but instead a chopped down version that's not nearly as great to look at.

These DVDs also allow you to watch and re-watch these episodes whenever you please.  For those who are new to Lost that is a bigger deal than it may appear at first.  There's nothing better than being able to watch these shows back to back as well as re-watch the tricky parts and try to figure out all the sub-plots.  :)  The extras really help you get into it too, giving you great background and juicy info that will suck you in even further.  In fact the extras alone are worth the price of admission for any Lost junkie.

There's another benefit to these disks.  Unlike those who have to wait for the next season or show to air based upon the VERY STRANGE and DISJOINTED practice of them delaying new episodes and taking long breaks between seasons, you can pace yourself through these seasons.  Discover the story on your own time and avoid the annoying schedules set by network television or the next writer's strike.

To list all of the episode plot-lines isn't really something you need me to do here.  What I can tell you is at a high level what to expect from each of the seasons and what goodies are included.  Because this collection is really rich with special features, and that's really the value of getting this set.  Even if you've seen the episodes already, I can see alot of people still buying these disks for that alone.

<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Lost-The-Complete-First-Season/dp/B00005JNOG/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Lost - The Complete First Season</a>

As you might expect, the first season set includes the Pilot episode that has become almost TV legend at this point.  The very diverse set of characters is introduced little by little through their interactions but more so through the flashbacks.  We get to learn about the fateful events that brought them all together and how they cope with the stress of being ... well, Lost.  :)

Audio commentaries for the ""Pilot"" episode by the producers gives you a background into how the pilot got off the ground and filmed.  There are other audio commentaries that are episode specific for ""Walkabout,"" ""The Moth,"" and ""Hearts and Minds.""

Most of the special features are included on the seventh disk, which is devoted to them. ""The Genesis of Lost"" shows us how everything started and evolved. ""Welcome to Oahu: The Making of The Pilot"" is standard making-of fare.  ""Designing a Disaster"" is a kind of featurette about how they filmed the amazing crash site from the ""Pilot.""

""Before They Were Lost"" goes into the show's casting, which will really surprise a lot of people.  This show is amazingly cast, and when you see this you will be even more amazed at how they did it.  Audition footage is included too.  :)

""Lost: On Location"" is a group of behind-the-scenes extras that cover some filming sequences.  This is very useful for aspiring film-makers and just general movie junkies.

There are also some flashbacks from the season finale and over a dozen deleted scenes.

Also included are some less useful, though still attention keeping extras.  Among them are:
- ""The Art of Matthew Fox"" about photography he did during the ""Pilot."" Nice for people like me who like photography, but not for Lost purists.
- ""Lost@Comicon"" is footage from Comicon and the actors who were there promoting the show
- ""Onset with Jimmy Kimmel"" feels like a shameless network plug and shows some worthless and probably staged shenanigans
- ""Live from the Museum of Television and Radio"" is another bit of self-promotion that includes very little
- ""Backstage with Driveshaft"" takes a look at Charlie and his fictitious band
- ""Bloopers from the Set"" is a gag reel that really didn't even need to be here.  Some people are into that stuff though.

Season 2 is a very direct continuation of the ending of the first season.  It does start to give the show more of a ""24"" like feel though.  Mysteries are solved but more questions are raised than answered.  And while we get a lot of background on key characters like Kate and Jack, it takes us a VERY long time to get there.  There are a lot of riddles and red herrings thrown in to make you think and throw you off.  Still, every episode has a value when you see things develop over all the seasons of the show.

Audio commentaries are available for some episodes, including ""Man of Science, Man of Faith,"" ""What Kate Did,"" ""The 23rd Psalm,"" ""The Whole Truth"" and ""Dave.""

They seem to have added more episode commentaries to make up for less on the special features disk. Disc seven includes:
- ""Fire and Water: Anatomy of an Episode"" a ""making of an episode"" featurette
- ""Lost: On Location"" a contrast of episodes shot on location instead of a studio
- ""The World According to Sawyer"" which is a character  profile of Sawyer and his sarcastic comments
- ""The Lost Flashbacks"" with three never before seen flashbacks
- Over a dozen deleted scenes
- Another annoying ""Lost Bloopers"" extra
- A ""Channel 4 UK Promo"" which is a slow-motion music video type of comercial
- ""Lost Connections""- a featurette about character inter-connections
- ""Mysteries, Theories and Conspiracies"" helps fuel the fire on the many unanswered questions
- ""Secrets from the Hatch"" is all about the hatch and how it was thought up

<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Lost-The-Complete-Third-Season/dp/B000P6YNSE/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Lost - The Complete Third Season</a>

Like the second season, Lost's third season was originally split into two sections with one more popular than the other.  I still think all the episodes were important, though some do move faster than others.  And speaking of ""the others"" they really start to take center stage in this season.

""Lost Book Club"" goes through the parallels between plot elements and the unraveling storylines ""Lost: On Location"" and ""Lost in a Day"" are ""making-of"" features that go into filming and it's challenges.

There is a one-on-one with star Matthew Fox and a featurette on ""the others."" As usual we have the audio commentaries and deleted scenes.  We also again have the bloopers which we could have done without.

""Cast in Clay: The Toys of Todd McFarlane"" goes into making toys for the show.  ""The Next Level: Inside the Video Game"" shows the making of the LOST game by Ubisoft.

Conclusion

Each season stands on its own as a tremedous work of TV.  Some will complain about the tail end of season two or the beginning half to season 3, but the more you watch and learn the more it all comes together.  This is a great show and a great set that is definitely worth owning.  You also save some money on the set, which is nice too.

Enjoy!",1210550400,44,7827,4.998454404945904
3406280,5,B0017HZZP0,"I have seen every episode of this show (I actually started watching it after season 1 ended and had to rent the first season to catch up so that I could watch season 2 as it aired), and I LOVE IT!  It keeps you on your feet, and you always want to know what is going to happen next...making you come back for more.  Plus, the price is just right!  You can't beat the price for what you are getting!  If you are a LOST fan, or you want to get into the show, this is the best deal you will get on the DVD's.  Don't let this deal pass you by, because you won't find it anywhere else!",1209427200,12,580,3.8403361344537816

3406282,2,B0017HZZP0,"I purchased LOST seasons 1 -3 from TOPNOTCH.  All the discs, except one, had a glitch that had to be fastforwarded over.  In addition, all discs had two horizontal somewhat blurry lines - one at the top and one at the bottom that covered two-three inches of the screen.  I paid $80 for all three seasons so I guess you get what you pay for.",1231632000,,340,4.2
3406283,5,B0017HZZP0,"Every episode of this unique series is captivating; the theme is multi-faceted, and the character development is both spellbinding and intriguing. Watching the series on television can be frustrating because of commercials, and the waiting periods between seasons are agonizing. I bought the 3 seasons combo not only to satisfy my addiction, but to help solidify the key points and clues scattered throughout the series' episodes. It's been as enjoyable the second time through as was the first, even taking into account the foreknowledge of the ""surprises"" that inevitably pop up each week.

This is a must-have for the serious LOST fan. I resisted the urge to buy Season 4 due to the inflated cost for the one season's episodes compared to the first three.  However, after season five is ended on television, my addiction will probably force me to buy 4 and 5 as well, even at the increase in cost.",1231459200,,900,4.9144736842105265
3406284,5,B0017HZZP0,My grown children (38 & 40) have been watching this series from the beginning and want to keep it on DVD. They both insisted I watch it from the beginning because the story builds on previous episodes.  I purchased the series to give to my son and attached strings (that I be allowed to borrow it).  I have watched the first season and can't wait to get started on season two.  It is very fast moving and intricate so it requires concentration.  I am very pleased with the outcome.,1231286400,,481,4.370786516853933
3406285,5,B0017HZZP0,I received the DVD's today - well ahead of the expected arrival date and in excellent condition. I will enjoy these for months to come. Great job!!,1231200000,,147,4.481481481481482
3406286,5,B0017HZZP0,"I bought Lost-The Complete Seasons 1-3 back in May of 2008 as a ""Deal of the Day"".  I just looked on back orders to see what I paid for it... $99.99. Today, December 8, 2008 it is $58.99. Ha Ha...what a difference a day makes!! BUT..I'll tell you this, I am still glad I bought it for almost double the price...except for one little problem I had with my order.

I had never watched Lost on TV...but I had heard rave reviews from friends. I am an Amazon Addict who has to ""check out deals"" whenever I'm on line. So , I saw ,thought the price was great, and I thought I would treat myself and my family.

My daughter saw the box, opened it, and we sat down to watch the 1st episode.  After 6 episodes, with snacks and bathroom breaks, we finally pryed ourselves away from the TV, but we kept talking about everything we had watched. The next day was a repeat and I was upset my daughter had to go back to school on the following day.

This went on whenever we had time ,we had a ""Lost Marathon"". Until we opened the 3rd season. We were so excited to see what the next episode would reveal. The episode called ""Not in Portland"" started and suddenly the disc stopped. My DVD player made a noise. I kept trying to forward and it stayed on this one part where Juliet is sitting on a beach that you think is the Island, but is really Miami. I kept hitting buttons until it went forward just a little and stopped again. I took it out of the DVD player to see if it was scratched, washed it, and continued to Freak Out!! I tryed it again the next day...same darn thing.

I went to ""Help"" on my order on Amazon. There is a section that allows you to talk to a Customer Service Representative.  I told her what happened and because it was sold in a ""bundle"" I had to return ALL 3 seasons and another ""bundle"" was sent back to me.  I simply took the same box the new one was sent in, put the return sticker on, and brought it to the Post Office, at no cost to me.  We had to wait a few days but then we made popcorn, put on our jammies, and guess what? THAT ONE skipped, or froze, or whatever it was called, in the same EXACT place. I went to the phone and tried to explain to another Customer Rep who wanted me to do the exact same thing.

Now, I KNOW I am not the ONLY person in the USA this has happened to...the odds are against it. This time I was angry. I told the Rep that I wanted JUST the 3rd Season that was NOT in this bundle.  She agreed because she looked and said there were several others who had reported this problem.
They sent the 3rd Season and told me just to keep the one I had. I just tossed it and we waited for the new package to arrive. Thank God , it was OK and we watched the rest of  the season. But, it was awful knowing we had to wait until 12/9/2008 to see the last season!

I have been buying from Amazon since 2001 and have had almost no problems. I am disabled and this is the very best way for me to shop. I bet if I bought this at a place like Best Buy, they would say too damn bad.  You opened the seal..it's YOUR problem, but  I have never had any problem with anything I have bought that there is a problem with that their Customer Rep Dept doesn't handle in the nicest and fastest possible way.

To end this review where I am actually reviewing the product : This is a FANTASTIC Series!!  And you people, who are getting the Deal of a Lifetime, getting it at this price, Amazon is actually giving you a Christmas present!!  I have the 4th Season preordered but guess what we have been watching the last 2 weeks?  Yup...another Lost Marathon..I
LOVE this show and I LOVE Amazon for the deals and the ease of seeing , getting to read reviews before I buy, and for the respect and ease of returns.  You just can't lose buying this !! Have Fun!!",1228694400,,3770,4.075778078484438

Lost is a character driven series with constant twists and turns that keeps the viewer wondering what will happen next, while eagerly anticipating the next episode.  Just when you think you have it all figured out...you realize you knew nothing at all...lol.  The only complaint I have is that the 5-7 seasons DVD's will not be released for a long, long, long time.  That seems like an eternity when you're waiting to find out what happens next.  It's like reading an entire book except the last chapter or two.  I love the Lost series and recommend it.

LOST is so incredible boring, there's no action at all, no brain action, This is absolutely NOT a thinking person's notion of stimulating entertainment, If I were you, I would watch the first and last episode and I sware you won't miss a thing. They will be lost forever. I even thought that I should be hight (drugged) to get it, But i was tired of loosing my time here. Writers must be so astonished to see how people see this nonsense show, with no answers.. just question after question and I'm pretty sure they will come with ridiculous answers at the end. DON'T WASTE YOUR TIME with this garbage. Try Prison Break which is an absolute 10!!! with great acting, plot and superb suspense.

Then, my college roommate this year insisted that I sit down and watch the Pilot, which had been posted online.

Let's just say, I spent the next 3 weeks or so going through all three seasons.

The great thing about Lost is that not only is it's location beautiful, it's storyline exciting, and it's acting incredible, but the characters portrayed on the show are both complex and unexpectedly moving.

The rabbit hole only gets deeper, and yes, at times, it will try your patience, but if you stick with it through the first three seasons and make it into 4, you will be rewarded.  Everyone with an imagination and a passion for storytelling should experience Lost.  It really is the best show ever put on TV.

8265979,5,B0017HZZP0,"Lost is the best TV show to come out in years. I've thoroughly enjoyed each season, and so when Christmas came this year, I decided to buy several of these sets to give as presents. I gave a set to my parents and to my sister and her husband. All of them are now hooked, and are watching episodes every night and then calling me and begging for clues about what will happen next! I think it's pretty telling that both my mother (in her fifties) and my sister and husband (late 20s) LOVE this show. It is really a well made show and this three season set is a perfect way to get started watching.

Sort of a Gilligan's Island combined with the X-files, and with a story telling style rich in character development and subplots, LOST is a wonderfully well made show, and unlike anything else on TV. You will find yourself engrossed in all of the characters lives, and just when you think you have things figured out, something will happen that blows your mind.

Well worth owning, LOST will go down as probably the greatest TV show of the 2000-2010 era. These first three seasons are where it all started and are a must buy for LOST fans. They also make great gifts...",1233446400,,1166,4.368663594470046
