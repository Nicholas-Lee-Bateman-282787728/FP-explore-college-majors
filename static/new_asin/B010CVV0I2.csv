 One day, her clan is destroyed, and her master is murdered. Unfazed, she enacts her code and seeks revenge: not out of emotion, but out of duty. The path of revenge she walks is a lonesome and bloody one. With nobody to trust, our heroine only has herself and her weapons she can rely on. Tune in to find out the fate of our heroine's struggles to carry out her quest for revenge.

- Comments: This anime is based off the game. Anyways, there's a high amount of violence, blood and gore, so keep this in mind if you are a viewer that may not be into violent animes.

She's pretty detached. I don't think she's cold-hearted. She's just so used to killing that it becomes nothing to her. No matter how tough or new something is, with repetition and the right mind-set, it will eventually become as routine as breathing.

There isn't that much character development and you don't really get to know the backstory behind many of the characters. If you just want to see a simple anime, then go ahead and try this one out. Though I don't blame those that got bored with this one. The plot is lacking but again, it's simplistic and involves the main character's quest for revenge.

- Features: Japanese dub with English subs. Includes 13 episodes on 3 DVDs with a run-time of about 5 hours. Rated TV-MA for violence, blood and gore, and some fan-service.

8722096,2,B010CVV0I2,"Saw this via Crunchyroll and I was pretty disappointed because it has so much promise.  The character designs are awesome, the stories were really weak (except the fan woman's origins), and towards the end of show you can see the quality of the animation drop off drastically.  The show appeared to have a pretty big build up of the main character and villain but in the end left me feeling disappointed.  The only thing about the show I enjoyed constantly was the shows ending credits, the song and the dancing is great.  My suggesting is to rent it first and decide for yourself if you want to own it or not.",1450224000,,610,4.468468468468468

8722100,3,B010CVV0I2,"I watched this on Crunchyroll and so didn't purchase the DVDs or Blu-Rays. Any potential issues regarding the disc versions weren't encountered due to my channel choice. I only heard the Japanese dialogue with subtitles and the voices chosen work reasonably well. I have no idea how the English speaking cast will do but at least one character is going to be going to be bad and my bet is that it will be the bikini clad bounty hunter.
The plot is approximately as outlined in the description above.  It is a little more involved as the roles of the Param empire and Jin Varrel are explored. Probably the best character is that of the Inn owner who bears a grudge against Alka and who is able to act upon that grudge. This provides the route for some much needed character development and emotion in an otherwise linear story. I don't think this broke new ground and even though the girls are pretty there's not much fan service. The action scenes are good enough but limited in number. It gets three stars because I did watch all of it but after a week or so can barely remember it and have no desire to see it again. Like I said it's not bad but doesn't stand out from the crowd.",1445990400,7,1181,4.368181818181818
