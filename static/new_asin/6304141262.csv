806388,1,6304141262,"I love tornado movies, but this one such a disappointment. Come on, walking around in the ""eye"" of tornado? It's obvious the makers of this absurdly stupid movie knew nothing about tornados, or simply chose to ignore reality. The special effects are terrible. The CGI(?) tornadoes more resemble dark dust bunnies than tornadoes. The spinning stocking (or whatever it was) in the old ""Wizzard Of Oz"" looks better.",1123372800,2,412,5.073529411764706
806389,3,6304141262,"I remember watching this on TV when it debuted in '96.  Even though the tornado sequences (especially the final one) are unrealistic, this movie is not a total waste.  The cast is pretty solid, and I enjoyed the acting throughout.  (Kudos to Bruce Campbell, who does well as a storm chaser :) )  Special effects are OK, considering this was made for TV.  (Obviously with a lower budget than ""Twister"".  If you want to see REALISTIC-looking tornadoes, look there.)  I probably could've written the script better, which is the main weakness in this film.  All in all, not as good as ""Twister"", but a decent movie anyway.",1107648000,8,618,4.710280373831775
806390,2,6304141262,"Amazing how Noel Hesseck's direction could make a tornado seem so insignificant.  With little special effects of any note, this Twister wannabe suffers from flat, laconic performances, most notably Bruce Campbell and Ernie Hudson.  Even L.Q. Jones seems winded and lifeless.  An obvious made for TV soapie, that never shows the tornado at its worst.
Rent don't buy.",1076976000,4,365,5.258620689655173
806391,5,6304141262,"I haven't seen the movie, but Bruce Campbell's the sh*t, so it has to be interesting. Anyhow, I couldn't help but laugh for ten minutes on Azien's ""I love tornado movies"" line. I love tornado movies? I LOVE TORNADO MOVIES!? I have to put that on a shirt.
Ok, go ahead and check ""This review is not helpful""",1074124800,8,306,4.293103448275862
806392,3,6304141262,"Azien...where in the world did you see an F100?  That meso must have been at least twenty miles wide...hehe=)

806393,1,6304141262,"This ""Twister"" knock-off doesn't really offer much as everyone's favorite ghoul-killer plays it straight, chases storms, and seeks a little romance.  It is great to watch Campbell in something other than a supporting role, but this is a TV cheapie.  On the plus side is a strong supporting cast that includes Ernie Hudson (as Campbell's mentor).
The DVD image is full-screen and nothing to write home about.  There are no extras.
So, I guess this one is for people who love Ash, couldn't watch ""Twister"" because of some dislike for Helen Hunt, or just buy anything with a special effect.  Now when will ""Atomic Twister"" get released?",1026259200,17,633,4.88785046728972
806394,1,6304141262,"I rented this movie because I love tornado movies. This one was the most horrible one I have ever seen. There is about three tornados in the whole movie. All of which are just a little computer ink. At the end of the movie, they end up inside this F100 tornado. They take a look around and say ""We're inside it!"" They stand up and take a look around. Apparently there is no vacume inside the twister. So they can just stand up and walk around, and only worry about the side of the tornado which spins so fast it will carry them away. This movie is so stupid!! If only there wasn't so many reviews around me that said it was better than Twister. Buy Twister instead of this pathetic one. Oh, what's my saying of this movie? It stunk! It was stupid! A total waste of money! Want to see my review of Twister? Go there. Save your money with this one.",1014249600,3,846,4.164634146341464
806395,5,6304141262,"I seen Twister first in the threatres and then Tornado on TV. I must state that Twister had some romance(not enough), the characters seemed to me to be just reading a script to you. No feelings or emotion they seem flat and  lifeless, the special effects were great but there was some scenes where  the truck's windshield wasn't even BROKEN when the next scene it was. D'OH!  Tornado has alot more romance than Twister did, the people seemed more  realistic, and the threat of the Tornado was there and yet unpredictable to  know when they show up which they are. The special effects were really kool  and not too many scenes where there was anything wrong like a broken  windshield of the stormchaser's red pickup truck in Twister. There was only  about three to four tornados showing up in this movie and there was six or  more tornados showing up in Twister. Twister you knew when they were going  to show up even watching it the first time you knew when it was going to  show up. In Tornado you never knew it was coming and that is how a real one  acts. I recommend buying this movie first and then watching Twister second.  You won't be sorry.",951177600,10,1148,4.461538461538462

806778,3,6304141262,"Ok. Three stars. I did love the movie actually but its only part 1 with part 2 not being available. So it does not have ending. Acting is great, subtitles are lacking but personally, it did not bother me much since I can speak German well enough to fill in the gaps. As I said, great movie but need the second part.",1523404800,,315,4.096774193548387

806781,4,6304141262,"Why would Amzaon put only the first part of a 3 hour two part series for viewers to watch.  This is ridiculous.  This was actually a decent b movie and now amazon lets their viewers wondering where the 2nd part is.  When it was released for the English version it ran as ""F4 Vortex""",1523145600,,282,4.185185185185185

806785,1,6304141262,"I would have given this a higher rating had it been a whole movie.  But this is part one of a two part movie.  There is NO streaming part two!  (I searched for it). Pretty lame Amazon.

There is a DVD of the whole movie for purchase, it's called:  F4: Vortex by Matthias Koeberlin.  But I consider this a bait and switch situation, so I won't be buying it.",1523059200,,356,4.086956521739131

806967,2,6304141262,This is only the first half of what looked to be a very good movie.  It just stops with an extended trailer for the last half WHICH IS NOT THERE.  This should never have been promoted as a complete film on Prime Amazon with half of it missing.  Very disappointed.,1522972800,,263,4.22

807194,4,6304141262,This is a great movie although I am afraid of Tornado's.  I like all the information that they weave into the movie to teach you about the way to get ready and where to go for a tornado.  Like all the action.  There is romance in the movie between the two main characters.  Good movie for action and romance.  It is a pretty good movie.,1366416000,,336,4.107692307692307

I have not ever found a VHS or DVD worth some of the asking prices on this site, especially used. If and when the price is reasonable, I will buy the movies I want in my collection; until then I will watch something else. So if you have one to sell that is in good condition and you are holding it because you think it is an antique or something, Continue to hold it until it is no longer useful and obsolete because there are others who feel the same as I do or make the price reasonable!",1365984000,,620,3.9285714285714284

807197,5,6304141262,okay so this movie isn't like Twister but it is a good movie. Good plot and I was happy to find it online for less than $20! Never heard of the movie but started watching it on Netflix and then they removed it so I had to buy it!,1355616000,,229,3.693877551020408

807202,4,6304141262,"This tornado flick is head over heels better than the theatrical release Twister.  As a real weather weanie with a PhD in climatology, I can say without a doubt that the portrayal of meteorologists and storm chasers is a lot closer to the truth than the stereotypes presented in Twister.  The portrayal of the weather service, weather maps, and the tornado itself was also MUCH better than in Twister.  If you want a tornado adventure movie which is a lot more accurate than most of the junk out there, get this movie.

One can make the claim that the plot is rather predictable, weather boy meets powersuit girl, they fight, but then get to like each other, but so what, a lot of movies use a similar plot.  The characters are likable and its a fun ride.  Bruce Campbel gets to give a performance which is not over the top, and proves he can be a serious actor, given the right material.

This is my favorite tornado movie.  Its a nice little movie, the good guys persevere, and the weather stuff is good.",1134345600,26,1006,4.459016393442623
