8011264,4,B0001EJ48Y,"I am reviewing the DVD of Barenaked In America, but it's the same as the VHS (just in different formats). Anyways, I really enjoyed this. The live performances get a 5/5, some great songs and awesome footage. The interviews were great as well. Very interesting to see behind the scenes of the Stunt Tour. Highly recommended.",1263254400,2,324,4.803571428571429
8011265,5,B0001EJ48Y,"This video/DVD is absolutey brilliant! ive watched it about a million times now, and its not even slightly boring. It gives you a behind the scenes look at life as a barenaked lady,with lots of funny mishaps on the way. if you're a fan, i would definately buy it, as it also contains live versions of these songs:its all been done, who needs sleep, straw hat and old dirty hank, Alcohol, Call and answer, Some fantastic, One week, Break your heart, The old apartment, Brian Wilson and If i had a $1,000,000. A must have for all BNL fans!!
  It also contains Kevin Hearn playing with the band for the first time since fighting Leukemia, and tells you his story of how him and the band coped with the terrible news.",1075420800,12,713,4.435114503816794
