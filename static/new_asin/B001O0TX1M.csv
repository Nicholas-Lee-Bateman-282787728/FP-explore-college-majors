3725647,4,B001O0TX1M,"I almost gave this only 3 stars as these are not quite like the classics of the 1960's, but they are still more enjoyable than some of the later Peanuts Specials.

And lets face it, this is only a 50 minute DVD (not counting bonus material).  If any other company tried to sell us a DVD under an hour long for $19.99 we would be shouting GREED.  We should get at least 4 Peanuts specials per DVD, if not 6 like most TV shows on DVD.

SNOOPY'S REUNION has one main problem, the adults talk. The tradition of Peanuts in both the comic strip & the TV specials was that adult voices did not speak words.  But this TV special breaks with that tradition, and it shouldn't have.  It was not necessary to hear the words the farmer of the Daisy Hill Puppy farm said, the message would have gotten across with a muted horn.  There is also the sadness of Snoopy's family seperation in this TV special.  I'm more used to the happy-go-lucky Snoopy.

FLASHBEAGLE has long been available on both VHS & Laserdisc (just like Snoopy's Reunion), I wish Warner would focus on titles never released on Laserdisc.  Flashbeagle has not dated well, it requires a viewing of the movie Flashdance to understand some of the references.  The Disco theme also helps make this out of date.  That is why it has not been seen much on TV.  It is still a decent musical special, but it lacks the classic Peanuts feel.",1238371200,4,1383,4.397637795275591
3725648,5,B001O0TX1M,"Well, this one has been a long time coming. I found out that this special includes the long-awaited Flashbeagle. I've looked everywhere for that one. It's been hard to find, except perhaps for a download for iPod from iTunes, and it's always been pricey on VHS. But now, it's included with this dvd. For those of you who don't know what the special is about, it's kind of a take on the Flashdance movie of the 80's, when that style of music and dance was popular. Lots of music in this one!

Also, Snoopy's Reunion gives us a rare look at Snoopy's brothers and his sister, who weren't really seen too much in the comic strips. Out of all the siblings, Spike was the one mostly shown either writing to Snoopy or visiting him. So it's nice to see all of his relatives in one place. These two specials were not aired much during their time, perhaps once or twice. I saw them both once, and it's great that they've finally come back on dvd. I think everyone will enjoy these specials, and it could be a first time treat for some of you as well. A must for any Peanuts fan's dvd collection.",1237766400,44,1085,4.318627450980392

8328728,5,B001O0TX1M,"Snoopy's Reunion is cute (you get to meeting all of Snoopy's brothers and sisters) and a little sad, but the real reason I bought this (for the second time) is FLASHBEAGLE!
My parents were kind enough to stand there, holding the bunny-ears antenna on their super old TV in the 80s to record this special on our VCR.  Since then, my younger brother and I have watched it at least 100 times.

""It's Flashbeagle, Charlie Brown"" (named for Flashdance), came out in 1984 and has little to no plot.  This didn't detract it from being my favorite Peanuts Special ever.  There are a few little stories but most just lead up to the musical numbers in the film.  We'll see the gang at school, the gang at a party playing games and dancing, Snoopy getting ready (80s style) for a night out, Snoopy at a club, and Sally bringing Snoopy to show-and-tell.

Flashbeagle is the theme song and not performed by the Peanuts kids.  This is the song you hear three times: at the beginning of the special, when Snoopy (and Franklin) go to out to a club, and finally, at Sally's show-and-tell.  The three songs I loved as a kid were the ""Pigpen Hoedown"", Peppermint Patty's PE song ""I'm in Shape"", and Lucy's Simon-Says classic, ""Lucy Says"".  Other supporting songs exist in the background but those four are the ones you'll notice.

I bought this DVD a few years ago for myself, even though I'm my 30s.  It was just as fun at watch and MUCH clearer than my TV-taped VHS copy, and you get Snoopy's Reunion as well.  I watched it with my friend from 1st grade (when we were in first grade... I'm not hanging out with 6-year olds now) and we had a great time reminiscing about watching the same special during our sleepovers in grade school.  The reason I just bought a second copy is for her daughter's birthday this year (she'll be four).  Sure, I've brought over my own copy and we dance with her daughter to Pigpen's song but am I nice enough to give this precious child my copy?  NO!  But I will buy her a copy that she can watch with her younger brother like I did with mine.

For those interested in a little trivia, Stacy Ferguson (Fergie, from the Black Eyed Peas) does the voice of Sally.",1483488000,,2174,4.422110552763819
