8089080,5,B000BMSUIG,Great Italian Recipies!!!!!!!!!,1472169600,,31,9.666666666666666
8089081,1,B000BMSUIG,"This was put together with very old, blurred photos.  It is not a travel DVD, but a cooking DVD, but even the cooking is dated and unlike anything I have ever eaten in northern Italy.  If I had known what was on this DVD, I would never have purchased it.  There are much better travel DVDs available.",1347840000,,300,4.228070175438597
8089082,5,B000BMSUIG,This is a fun DVD to watch.  There is so much of Italy to see along with the food.  It really makes you wish you were in Italy and were eating all the food that is being cooked.,1315267200,,177,3.6315789473684212
8089083,1,B000BMSUIG,I like my cheese in my pasta not in a video about food.  This has to be one of the poorest edited and shot video about Italy and Italian food I've seen.  Some of the narration was absolutely nonsense.,1211846400,3,200,4.102564102564102
8089084,4,B000BMSUIG,"We find the ""Flavors"" DVDs in general are 60% commentary on locale/history and site seeing, 40% actual cooking. This one is no different.  The site seeing parts are interesting as is the cuisine.  As others may have mentioned the video quality of the cooking spots does seem amateur.",1203897600,5,283,4.875
8089085,3,B000BMSUIG,"The narrating for each area was OK, but could've been more in depth. The focus is definitely on food, but instead of giving the viewer an all-around feel for the local cuisine, this DVD concentrates only on a few recipes from local restaurants, which you cannot replicate, because most of the ingredients are hard to find in the US.
The quality is very low, blurry, and the composition is almost amateur-like. It looks a bit outdated, the music is the same old, lousy Italian stereo-typical mandolin that plays throughout the documentary.
OK, fine, the price is what it is so you can't expect a Ken Burns film shoot, but I just think this product doesn't do my country justice!! I would suggest to save your money and watch better shows on the Travel Channel or the Food Network.",1185321600,24,779,4.6521739130434785
8089086,5,B000BMSUIG,"Excellent demonstrations and recipes.

Most involve layers of vegtables and meat cooked together.

The narrator is so so, but does get the point across.

The landscapes are beautiful.",1170460800,6,183,5.464285714285714
8089087,4,B000BMSUIG,"The scenery was magnificent. I did not like the female narrator. She did not pronounce the Italian correctly and that annoyed me. Overall, I loved seeing different Northern Italian cities.",1168300800,17,188,5.3
8089088,5,B000BMSUIG,"this is the best dvd on the italian countryside. offers cooking,arts, villages, customs in six different regions. I would love to find the same in other country's. I got the dvd at dollar

tree for $1.00.
