8081675,5,B000B5XP88,"The review below by Byron Kolln is incorrect with its list of episodes.
The episodes listed in Mr. Kolln's review below
are the ones on the ""Mr. and Mrs. North,
Volume Six"" from Alpha Video. The Amazon picture shown above
is for the ""Mr. and Mrs. North, Volume Six"" from Critics' Choice. I have both
the Alpha volume six and the Critics' Choice volume six.
The Alpha is poor quality (as I have found most of their DVDs to be),
but this one, the Critics' Choice
is better quality. I am 100
percent sure the eipsodes I list here are correct,
since I have the DVD in hand right now and
have watched it.

1. ""Surprise"" (11-28-52)Pam and Jerry attend a surprise party
where a fading ham actor is murdered.

2. ""Where There's a Will"" (12-2-52) The Norths' find their
neighbor brutally beaten on the eve of his birthday.

3. ""Silent Butler"" (12-26-52) Pam and Jerry hire a butler
who brings murder and mayhem to the household.

4. ""Stranger Than Fiction (2-20-53) The Norths' relaxing
weekend with an author turns dramatic when they track a killer.",1312675200,6,1041,4.580645161290323

When it became apparent that Richard Denning wasn't going to be automatically re-cast opposite Lucille Ball in ""I Love Lucy"" (the show inspired by the radio serial ""My Favourite Husband"" in which he had starred with Ball), Denning took the role of Jerry North, a publisher who also dabbles in sleuthing with his lovely wife Pamela (Barbara Britton).

MR. & MRS. NORTH was based on a series of novellas written by Richard Lockridge; the characters were later featured in a long-running radio serial, which started out in 1946 and ended up airing concurrently with the TV series (which debuted in 1952). The TV series of MR. & MRS. NORTH, sponsored by Revlon Cosmetics, played on CBS from 1952-53, and was later picked up by NBC for additional episodes in 1954.

Episodes:

""Beauty Prize"" - On a whim, Pam decides to pay a visit to the Miss Venus beauty contest, when she discovers that one of the girls - a certain Kitty Pomeroy - looks exactly like her.  This fun episode sees talented Ms Britton playing a second character.

""Dead Man's Tale"" - A frightening call leads the Norths to a cigar store. There, they discover a gambling operation and a bookie who fakes his own death.

""Comic Strip Tease"" - Pam discovers that a street gang is intimidating local shopkeepers Mr. and Mrs. Helsir. Jerry comes to the rescue in a creative way.

""Reunion"" - Jerry's alma mater reunion weekend does not turn out as planned when the Norths are taken hostage by an old roommate who is involved in an anti-nuclear crusade.",1142467200,3,1641,4.7368421052631575
