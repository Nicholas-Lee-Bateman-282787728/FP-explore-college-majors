2916782,5,B000U67UGG,Great video for the beginner! Good for sailors that need a brush up on spinnaker handling and reefing. Well done.,1368576000,2,113,4.7
2916783,5,B000U67UGG,She covers a lot of information fast so you really have to pay attention. But she's a great teacher and we learned a ton from this video!,1368144000,,137,4.111111111111111
2916784,5,B000U67UGG,"Penny slowly and methodically lays out each piece of hardware on the deck.  Very concise definitions and instruction, followed by actual examples.  Very helpful to me.  I bought this two years ago and now I am racing my 1989 Pearson 31.  Sailing has become a major part of our family's lifestyle.",1349395200,2,296,4.745098039215686
2916785,5,B000U67UGG,"This DVD is very simple to follow.  It is done on a big yatch but the lessons are useful to dingy sailors also. Penny shows and teaches the basics in a ways like no other video I have seen.  Her ""around the clock sail seting"" and ""knot tying"" ideas make it easy to remember how to perform these activities.",1336435200,,306,4.169491525423729
2916786,2,B000U67UGG,"I purchased this video to use as a teaching aid for a beginning sailing class. The author is from New Zealand where the sailing lingo is quite different from here in the US. So much so that I felt it would completely confuse a beginning sailor rather than facilitate his understanding. The video was more of a commercial for her film's sponsors and a pitch to come to her sailing school than a teaching aid. The only bright spot was that the photography was well done. It would have been nice to know that all of the action takes place on a 45 foot boat, not the kind of vessel most beginners learn on.",1320278400,3,602,4.2894736842105265

2916795,5,B000U67UGG,Looking for a folksy introduction to sailing basics? This video provides a concise demonstration of the essentials. Most could likely skip the sections on how to hank on the main and Genoa. But that's a quibble. I've coastal sailed for many years and found the video instructional.  Recommended.,1437436800,,295,5.145833333333333

2916801,4,B000U67UGG,I like the way Penny's delivery was a bit too fast. Other than that the information was provided in an easy to understand way just needs to slow down for better retention.,1432944000,,171,4.375

2916807,4,B000U67UGG,"Penny has great discussions of solid sailing skills. This is a great first for those learning to sail. She instructs in fundamental rope handling, terms, and mechanics of sailing.",1420675200,,179,5.206896551724138
2916808,3,B000U67UGG,"Penny Whiting obviously appears to have an excellent knowledge of sail handling, however, besides talking too fast, I believe she relays this information a little too quickly for the beginner. Being both a school teacher, and having a fair amount of sailing experience, I played the video for my wife who has a very limited knowledge of the subject, and while the video was helpful, it was easy to become overwhelmed with the rapid fire information.  Perhaps if the video was broken up into shorter segments, had additional card displays, more views of the sails and rudder position, as well as had a quiz of sorts after each segment, then it would be worth five stars  As one reviewer pointed out, he/she had to watch it a number of times, which is understandable, but again if the information was presented in a manner that was easier to comprehend, viewing times could have been reduced, and the experience more enjoyable.  Probably worth three and a half stars as it stands.",1420329600,,978,4.775147928994083
2916809,5,B000U67UGG,"We had never sailed before.  We decided to buy a small sailboat and learn how to sail by going out and doing it.  We watched Learn how to sail with Penny Whiting and learned how to sail.  Within 2 weeks we were sailing perfectly!!  We practiced man overboard skills with the lesson she teaches you in the video and perfected them in our 23.5 sailboat.  We had the confidence to go out and rent a 36 foot sailboat and sail from Long Beach, CA to Catalina Island with no problems.  I would suggest video to anyone interested in learning how to sail.  Penny is Awesome!!",1417910400,,567,4.3428571428571425
2916810,5,B000U67UGG,I first saw Penny's video on YouTube and went to find it on DVD.  A dream of mine is sailing in retirement and with limited knowledge I'm reviewing all I can.  This video was very basic and informative and completely enjoyable.  Penny does a good job teaching to the layman and you can tell she really enjoys sailing and educating.  A good video.,1417219200,,346,4.444444444444445

2916816,3,B000U67UGG,I gave it a rating of okay because it covered some basics but in my opinion too quickly and not thorough enough for the amateur. You couldn't really see what the whole boat was doing.,1401667200,,183,4.257142857142857
2916817,5,B000U67UGG,"This video is great for the beginner or novice. Penny is easy to understand, explains things well and shows good examples. I've watched it twice and will probably refer back to it as I'm learning.",1399420800,,196,4.628571428571429

2916820,5,B000U67UGG,"Penny Whiting is an awesome teacher and effective at what she does. If you are new to sailing and are looking to see how sailboats are sailed by experienced hands, this video shows you. Penny is knowledgeable and explains things correctly and easily. Her accent can be a bit tough to understand and times, but it doesn't ruin the video. It would help if you knew some of the definitions of the various parts of the boat before watching. Penny's accent can make it difficult to understand new nautical terms. Don't let my review dissuade you. This is one of the best ""how to sail"" type video's I've seen on Amazon Prime.

2916823,5,B000U67UGG,I was so disappointed when they took it off YouTube--but found it to purchase.  Worth every penny (no pun intended).  It moves so quickly that it needs to be viewed over and over if you are new at sailing.,1382832000,,205,4.230769230769231

8212161,4,B000U67UGG,"""learn how to sail""... okay, I have never sailed before. I have been wanting to sail for quite awhile. I have watched many video's of people sailing (not instructional videos). I have read parts of several books on it. More importantly I have studied diagrams of the terminology of a sailboat and sailing maneuvers previous to watching this video. If you are like me and never sailed, but also never read anything at all on sailing, I honestly think the video might move a little bit to fast. There is so much terminology and concepts to know, and she quickly goes from one to another, expecting you to remember everything she has said as she builds upon it all. I am not saying it is a bad video, but it does move quick and in my opinion you would be much better off (well, you would get more out of the video) having read a little bit of something up on some basic terminology before watching this video. That being said, this video very well gave an actual view/idea of the different parts of a sail, a sailboat, how to sail, etc... I think after viewing it 2 more times I might be actually ready and confident enough to try my hand with a tiny dinghy sailboat.",1467331200,,1164,4.368663594470046
8212162,5,B000U67UGG,Watched it as I was finishing my text sailing course. Everything was the same. It was great to see everything in the textbook apply to real life sailing before actually getting on the water.,1463443200,,190,4.617647058823529
