4593435,5,B00575GYT4,"Bought this collection for Slither, but it's a great deal when it comes to four movies.  Can't wait to watch the other movies.  I like any horror movie that has some kind of creepy monster or creature.  I know some of these are fairly new, but they are getting better.",1437350400,4,268,4.32
4593436,5,B00575GYT4,"I remember when I had to pay $15-20 for each dvd we purchased. As a lover of horror movies, it was costly to build the horror library we had amassed over two decades. I cannot believe how cheap movies are now. I came out looking for Slither and found this four-pack for $5. What a steal. I haven't watched the other three movies yet, but Slither itself is worth more than the $5 price tag. Slither makes my Top 100 favorite horror movies list. It's creepy and campy-feeling to me, and I love the woman in the barn. Freaky.

You can't go wrong with this collection. Even if you only liked ONE of the four movies, you'd be getting it at a bargain, right?",1435017600,17,652,4.258064516129032
4593437,5,B00575GYT4,"Bought it for 'Slither'- a campy, funny dark comedy flick with a great cast including Nathan Fillion (Firefly/Castle TV series), Michael Rooker (Walking Dead/Guardians of the Galaxy) and others

Might even get around to viewing the other three :)",1432252800,3,246,5.3076923076923075

4593440,5,B00575GYT4,"The dvd collection is a great buy for the money. We really enjoyed the ""horror movie night"". It plays great and is just as described. Thanks!",1388620800,5,141,4.461538461538462
4593441,5,B00575GYT4,"I really bought this DVD for the movie Slither, but they were all quite good. Slither shines because of the cast and the humor. Special effects are good too!",1376352000,4,157,4.448275862068965
4593442,3,B00575GYT4,"This is not the best horror collection. The story lines are all over the place and the acting stinks. But for $1.57 used, it passes the time if you're stuck at home mending from surgery. My advice is try something else.",1359763200,2,219,4.365853658536586
4593443,4,B00575GYT4,"I found the four movies a combination of different styles of modern horror movie. Slither is a fun scary roller coaster of all sorts of monster mayhem. Altered, is terrifying unearthly encounter with the unknown from above. Cry wolf, will keep you guessing and hanging on to your seat as a horror/ thriller. Ant The Return is a surreal haunting thrller, mystery/ horror that takes you to the edges of the afterlife... Enjoy. The service and quality of Amazon.com products great as always

4593457,4,B00575GYT4,"There's four movies, each with their own quirky style. Be aware that none of the films have special features, commentary, or deleted scenes.

What you're buying is a screening for each of the films, no more, no less. I was disappointed when there were no extras, but if we're honest it's not a demanding price tag. Still worth the asking price in my opinion.",1454889600,3,358,4.59375
