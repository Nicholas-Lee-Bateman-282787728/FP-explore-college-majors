5894070,5,B00E8A0PNK,"I like this better than her usual dvd's.  It has different moves in addition to the regular walking moves.  It will really make you sweat!  Glad I ordered and will order the ""party tunes"" one next.",1380672000,3,197,4.416666666666667
5894071,5,B00E8A0PNK,"I've been waiting for this new Leslie Sansone workout and it's a keeper!  This is a new 3 mile workout set to fast paced dance music.  Leslie includes her four traditional walking steps, but really mixes it up with a nice variety of additional moves.  The pace is fast throughout and the workout includes lots of coordinating arm movements to keep your heart rate up.  You can either choose the whole workout or each mile individually on the DVD menu, but the entire workout flows together without any real break between miles so trying to do them separately might be difficult.  The total walk includes a warm up and cool down, which are each 4-5 minutes.  After the warm up there are several fast walk numbers with music alternating between songs with vocals and instrumentals.  The beat of the music remains quick to keep the pace fast and is fun to walk and even dance to.  At two points within the workout, Leslie leads HIIT intervals (High Intensity Interval Training).  The first set of 4 HIIT intervals each include 2 minutes of slower walking moves and then a ramped up 30 second boost.  The workout continues with another couple of fast walk numbers and then one additional HIIT segment with a longer boost. Following the cool down, Leslie leads a stretch that is similar to stretches on her other DVDs.  The whole workout lasts just over 45 minutes, with the main part of the 3 miles between the warm up and cool down coming in at about 35 minutes. This is a really fun workout with great music--I'm looking forward to Leslie's next DVD in this format which is supposed to come out late this year!",1380585600,268,1608,4.5874125874125875
5894072,3,B00E8A0PNK,"Not for me simply because I was looking for a less jumpy alternative to Zumba since I live on the second floor-and this WALKING video had a significant amount of jumping! The colors, some of the music, even a hint of the style in this dvd reminded me of a lesser Zumba. At the time, Zumba was either at the gym or you had to order dvds through tv or online. Now they sell the dvds at walmart and target next to Leslie dvds. If you want Zumba, get Zumba because this isn't it. I was hoping for no jumping so I'll keep looking,",1516147200,,525,4.0576923076923075

5894089,4,B00E8A0PNK,Program includes walking and some brief sections of aerobic activity.  A nice feature is that you can play it with just the music and no talking.  I became quickly tired of viewing it with the talking.  Seems to be increasing my weight loss along with diet.  Good video for those who want some basic exercise.,1501113600,,309,4.5636363636363635

5894102,5,B00E8A0PNK,I like Leslie's new HIIT  training. I find the workouts more challenging than her previous which is good. The music is not that great but it's better than some standard workout music .  I have two of her hiit training and I like them both,1494979200,,238,4.266666666666667

I know that I can do 1 mile in 15 minutes with her and that will get me off my lazy but and ""beginning"" with a 1 mile walk.  Then I think, that wasn't even hard I can do 2 miles - I'll do 2 miles per day this week.  I can stick with these videos and I have lost weight with them.  My children (adult children) find her humor and speech silly and even irritating but I don't care, they get me up and going and that's what I have been looking for.",1493337600,6,668,3.7841726618705036

5894108,3,B00E8A0PNK,"This was my second Leslie Sansone DVD.  The walking-types steps are interspersed with brief spurts of fast-paced jogging and jumping (High Intensity Interval Training).  I could keep up,  because the fast pace is less than a minute, but I found the fast moves a bit hard on my knees.  I tried doing the steps on a thick yoga mat, and that went better.  Leslie's ""gang"" turns her usual basic moves into more dance-like steps.  I'll probably use this one occasionally for variety.",1491868800,,478,4.7682926829268295

5894111,2,B00E8A0PNK,"Not so much on this DVD Leslie. I did it twice, and by the end of the second day I knew that I couldn't look at those goopy grinning girls for another workout. Seriously. The music was just so-so. I didn't like the hopping and jumping, it gave me shin splints. I thought this was supposed to be walking. I love the 5 Day Walk DVD and will keep doing it until I find another one I like. I'll probably resell this one because I won't ever use it again.",1488153600,,450,4.011111111111111

5894114,5,B00E8A0PNK,"This is one of my favorites from Leslie Sansone. I thought the music was much more energizing (and louder) than in most of her other videos I have. She has a big group of very high-energy walkers, too, who all looked like they were having a great time. Very motivating! All 3 miles were fast and energetic. The HIIT intervals were very short, like 30 seconds, I think. I liked the change from the longer ones. It's easy to substitute more demanding moves to make the 30 seconds feel much longer, which is nice if you want to get more done. I like the long ones, too, but the recovery phases in those seem so long and so slow sometimes. In this video it stays faster in between, so you can keep the pace higher if you want to. I found it to be a fun workout and a nice change.",1487635200,,775,4.139072847682119
5894115,4,B00E8A0PNK,"This workout is about 45 minutes long. It includes a warm up, 3 mile walk, and a cool down. In the middle of the 3 mile walk is a period of time when you do short bursts of high intensity exercise alternating with low impact recovery exercise. The DVD also includes an option to workout to music only. While I liked having Leslies instruction the first few times that I did this workout, I liked having the option to just hear the music once I didn't need the instruction.

With all of the Leslie Sansone workouts that I have done, there is always the option of making your movements low impact when she is doing high impact. This workout was no different. I liked that I could adjust the workout to suit how much I wanted to challenge myself.

I enjoyed the workout and the music. This DVD will be going into my permanent collection.",1487203200,,834,4.374193548387097

5894117,5,B00E8A0PNK,This workout is great. Especially for someone as out of shape as me. It kept my heart rate up the entire time and was easy to follow. My 11 year old son was also able to keep up with it. Definitely enjoyed her teaching.,1486166400,,219,4.0
5894118,3,B00E8A0PNK,This would have been good if it actually flowed.  It was like she was making it up as she went along and the music also didn't flow at all.  She's either hit or miss for me.,1485820800,,173,3.7777777777777777

5894129,5,B00E8A0PNK,"Love Leslie's Walk to the Hits dvd's. What is really great about them, besides being fun to walk to is that she allows you to only have the music on so you don't have to listen to instruction once you know the exercises. Make more Leslie!!",1477958400,,239,4.217391304347826

5894135,4,B00E8A0PNK,I own a number of Leslie Sansone Walking DVD's since I need to change the movements to keep from getting tire of the routine.

5894137,2,B00E8A0PNK,"I have ten or more of Leslie's workouts and have used them for over ten years.  Recently, I've concentrated on her faster workouts, with 12 minute miles, etc.  Walk to the HITS is wayyyyyy too slow.  I was actually pressing the FF button on my remote to make it go faster in order to actually feel I am getting a workout.  Keep in mind that I am 69 years old!  This workout was too slow and boring for a 69 year old!!!  And what hits, exactly?  I didn't recognize a single song.  Maybe to use real hits would involve paying out a lot of money, but then don't call these songs hits.  Even without any hits at all, the music could have been much better - some really good funk and Latin music would be great and make it faster.  I love many of Leslie's workouts but probably won't use this one again.",1474761600,2,798,4.1568627450980395

5894162,5,B00E8A0PNK,Love this video. It's great for beginners who want to push themselves but don't know where to start and don't want to overwhelm themselves. The faster intervals really help you get a better workout than the other walk at home videos. The music is nice and really upbeat and the songs are familiar. The video is so easy to follow because as long as you stay on beat you're getting a great workout. It's nice to have a workout that I can do no matter where I am. I downloaded the video so I don't have to waste my data when I use the video outside my home.,1461369600,,554,4.138888888888889

5894167,4,B00E8A0PNK,"I'm a senior and then some, but I do work out quite a lot so I'm in fairly good shape. On this DVD I timed my true sweating at about a mile and a half.  Some of the twist moves and bouncy moves I did to fast walking and high  arm movements instead. Well,  Leslie always says her programs are adaptable. The last mile I really sweated so  all-to-the good. Next time I play the DVD it will be on sound only to avoid the  over-the-top ""partying"" particularly at the end of the third mile which distracts me everytime. Her older programs are her finest in my opinion. I have 13 of her dvds as a matter of reference.",1459555200,2,611,4.100840336134453

There were people of every size, shape etc.  The music was diverse (Latina, calypso, rock, country);
 even the new dance moves/steps were diverse. There was some walking, some jogging, some bouncing, some
twisting, some mumbas---a little bit of everything which keeps you from getting bored.

 I have never had this much fun doing an exercise video in my life!
It felt more like I was at a fun party than doing an exercise routine.  However, when it was all over I was drenched
so I know that this was a true workout.

If you are wondering whether or not to spend a little money on this, I urge you to give it a try.
The first time I tried it, I thought I'd do a mile or two and then stop, but I couldn't!  I had to keep going because it was so fun and the music made me want to keep going. The songs are the kind that boost your mood and the next thing you know, you've done the whole 45-minute (or so) DVD!

They were smiling and I found myself smiling during the workout as well.  Other Leslie videos I find myself rolling my eyes to get through 30 minutes, but this one I *love* to do for 45 minutes because the walkers are so enthusiastic.

5894249,5,B00E8A0PNK,"Fun. Easy. Low Impact. Very reasonable as your only daily workout (so easy to do) OR to add with more intense workouts or weight training. I used to do more intense cardio (insanity, etc. etc...all of it) and honestly...that stuff ends up making you hungrier and more stressed out..well it did me anyway. So I'd eat and undo all that hard strenuous cardio I did...but this is low impact...RELAXES me AND burns extra calories/fat...so I don't go eat the kitchen later because it DEstressses me instead of making me crave more food. Make Sense? I believe this is PERFECT cardio for someone who is trying to get fitter and lose weight or someone who is actually trying to get fitter and gain muscle/better physique. Just cut calories, increase nutrition in diet, add this daily walk and do weight training 3x weekly. You'll get there. At first...this was much lower key than I was used to...but it grew on me as I became a little more educated about all that there is out there to choose from. This is just fine for your cardio...maybe just add in one or two super intense, but short workouts throughout week for a well rounded program. Enjoy.",1436659200,,1140,4.648514851485149

Music helps to take your mind off the fact you're exercising.
Recommend using her videos, regardless of what shape you're in.
They're easy to follow and low>no impact aerobics.  If high impact, jarring,
aerobics isn't for you, these are great!
You can easily adjust your activity if out of shape, get ""too aerobic"" and need
to slow your heart rate back down.
For complete home exercise recommend LS's series along with stretching,  some
other aerobic videos, free weight exercises and some resistence training.
Just mix them up alternating days for a complete cross training regime.",1434844800,,627,5.019230769230769

5894271,3,B00E8A0PNK,I use Leslie's workouts because of joint problems and was disappointed to find that the High Intensity sections involved high impact moves.  This was reflected in the more youthful cast - it wasn't really for me and I don't use it much.,1432425600,,236,4.619047619047619

5894273,4,B00E8A0PNK,I like Leslie's walk program. Walk to the Hits is a great way to stay fit.  My only complaint is that Leslie talks through the whole thing and it's kind of hard to hear what song is playing. In the beginning of the routine she says she is going to take the vocal down but she doesn't.  Just the opposite.  No need for all the chatter Leslie.,1432252800,2,341,4.059701492537314
5894274,5,B00E8A0PNK,"Lots of fun  - and you can up the intensity or lower it - depending on what you need. Time flies when there is music and dancing, so this video  makes 30 minutes of walk aerobics a synch. Her HIIT (High Intensity Interval Training) is pretty low key, so newbies or low-impact exercisers - no worries. For advanced - just pump up the intensity of your moves during those sections and it works well. Enjoy!",1431907200,,404,4.373333333333333

It's 3 miles and although I loved the HIIT (high intensity interval training) the first three times, it was just too much, too intense for me.

5894300,4,B00E8A0PNK,I rented this via streaming and I thought it was fun. This is only the second time I have done a Leslie Sansone dvd so I can not really compare it to her other ones.  Some posters have complained about the intensity either being to high or two low but I thought this could be easily modified by making moves bigger or smaller and adding little air to the moves.  (I think the guy who does the high knees and some of the more energetic girls are actually showing good ways to make this advanced.)  I think this would be good workout for some one getting back into exercise and or someone who wants an easy to follow program that has zero dread level to get them into regular exercising.  I think this also would be good dvd for someone who already walks and wants to try a walking dvd since it is little more fun than some of the other ones I have done,1428278400,,851,4.13939393939394

5894341,2,B00E8A0PNK,"I really like Leslie's ""The Big Burn"" DVD so I thought I would try another one with interval training. What a disappointment! The intervals are nothing more than 30 seconds of jogging in place/jumping up and down (large-chested ladies beware: you will need a very supportive sports bra for this portion!) followed by several minutes at a cool-down pace. I didn't feel like I was getting any workout at all until well into the 2nd mile. There was a large cast of dancers behind Leslie and it seemed like they limited her movements. Much of the first mile was just rocking forward and back which got extremely old, especially since she never had us switch legs. The choreography was choppy and Leslie spent more time talking than giving cues for what move was coming next. She even tripped up the backgroud people a few times. And for a DVD that bills itself as being songs from the radio there's actually very few songs on it. Most of it is Leslie's typical workout music. I will probably sell this one at Half Price Books and use the money towards a different DVD.",1423180800,4,1064,4.575916230366492

5894343,2,B00E8A0PNK,"This was our first ""just walk"" video but will also be our last. All those radio hits you'll be walking to?  There's 4 and those are just intermittent - the majority of the video is standard cardio video music. And as for Leslie? She starts out like your outdated neighbor and by the end is like your drunk aunt at a wedding reception.  It's not entirely unbearable of a workout once we put the tv on mute and used our own music.",1423008000,3,428,4.2073170731707314
5894344,3,B00E8A0PNK,"This one is kind of odd.  I bought it since it had a music only option. I like her workouts but not her chatter.  The only trouble is in the music only option there are these weird silences between the supposed HIIT interval and the regular pace...no music, nothing, and seems like people have a hard time getting back on beat.  Plus..this one has listings on the DVD where you can do any one of the 3 walks or all of them, but she kind of tricks you. I did the 2nd walk  music only...and I was thinking hmm this sure seems more than 10 minutes and next you know they were doing a cool down.  So the 2nd goes right into the 3rd without any sort of indication unless it's so quick I missed it looking away.
Also though I prefer a bit dancier than her usual style and this was...it just seemed less defined some how.  A bit vaguer, and she was a bit off at times.  So I'll use it again but not my favorite.
If Leslie or of her publishers are watching these, please please keep having the music only option.  It makes a world of difference on how fast I get bored (or made crazy by) a DVD.",1423008000,3,1086,4.065727699530516

5894358,3,B00E8A0PNK,"I love the workout, however I wish she talked a lot less.  Spends more time jabbering with and thanking those walking with her instead of cuing at times, which is why I haven't purchased additional workouts from her.  The music is good and the moves get you sweating but her laugh and constant talking gets annoying.  I find myself turning off the sound and just doing the exercises.  I have bad knees and lower back so I have to be careful on what exercises I do.  This fits the bill with its low impact, high intensity workout.  My back and knees are not sore for days after doing it.  She also does short bursts of higher-intensity intervals during the workout which has shown to burn more calories.

5894482,5,B00E8A0PNK,"I own almost every Leslie Sansone video.  Some are very difficult to get through, some are great.  For me I need GREAT music, a variety of music, etc.  I am trying to think of how best to explain this, but some of the music in other videos is like a beat on a loop, like the ""power walk"" song where it just keeps saying and playing the same thing over and over for 5 minutes or so until another song starts.

This video starts out with a great song.  But I do want to point out if you think you are going to get to listen to an entire song, wrong, she picks out pieces and does SOME looping, but it still sounds great and is not boring.

There workout starts with about 10 minutes of what I would consider slow, then transitions into the interval training, but the intervals aren't long and you can walk, not job.  There are 4 of those I believe, where you walk rather slowly for about 2 minutes and then step of the pace for 30 seconds.

After this it goes into more random music, but mostly good.  She does a couple of songs then sets up for another faster interval which I haven't timed but is longer, maybe a minute or so?

I do this workout frequently, I like it that much.  I typically do it at lunch.  It is 47 minutes long but I skip the stretching at the end so about 43 minutes or so.  You can really step up what you are doing and make it difficult, like high knees during the intervals or you can stick to a walk and keep it easy.  Since I don't want to get sweaty at lunch I keep it easy, but at home I step it up.

For those of you who are step counters, this is about 6,500 steps beginning to end.",1409788800,33,1612,3.99375

I also question the science in slowing down so many times during the DVD.  I never reached my target heart rate. Some of the people in the DVD looked like professional dancers because of the way they moved. They do seem to be having fun.

This one is different from her other ones because there's some dancing mixed into it which makes it more fun, and the music really keeps you going. The HITT training is awesome because you get to do interval training which calms your heart rate down and then bumps it back up again for more calorie burn. I've been doing that at the gym on the treadmill, but this is obviously more fun. This is great when I want to do cardio at home.

After doing this tape which is about 40 minutes, I jumped on the treadmill for 20 minutes to alternate one minute intervals of jogging and walking.  I just felt like I did not get a good workout from this program.  Now, Leslie's WALK SLIM SERIES from 2008 is where you get great intervals in her 4 FAST MILES.  I certainly do not feel like jumping on the treadmill after that dvd!  Also, in that dvd, she does 5 HIIT series, 2 minutes of jogging and 3 minutes fast walking.

This workout isn't cued very well either.  She starts doing different moves, but doesn't warn you that they're coming and by the time you catch on, she moves onto something else.  I didn't feel like I got a really good upper body workout either.  I have a bad back and usually my morning walks help loosen those tight morning muscles, but not on this one.

The walkers are all great, high energy and seem like they're having fun (which always helps keep me interested and motivated). This DVD has more of a dance ""feel"" to it - but if you know Leslie, it's still not a dance workout. The walkers just seem to ""dance around"" a bit more and have a lot of fun, which motivates you to have a little fun with it too and ""dance around"" a bit more with the core walk moves. The songs are a pretty ok selection of radio songs as well. And before you know it you'll be really working up a sweat. It's a great workout.",1405036800,,658,4.030534351145038

I tore my right ACL last September, put on 20lbs due to the inability to exercise, and needed something motivating that I could do at home.

The same song was played for all the HIIT segments along with the same spastic movements. seemed a lot of faked enthusiasm - I really prefer some of her other walks to this one. Also I like when she says 1 mile or 2 mile or 3 mile- this one you have to be looking at the screen or know where it falls in the dvd or you miss the meter showing and the 3rd mile ends during the stretching!

5894532,5,B00E8A0PNK,"I""ve been walking with Leslie for years and have many of her dvds, so when this one came out i had to buy it also ;) And i was not disappointed, this workout is awesome!

It is a 3 miles workout and you could choose to just do one mile but really it is so much fun that if you're like me you will not want to stop before it's all done and feel like you could have kept going LOL!

It is meant for more advanced walkers so if you are just starting to exercise you might want to choose a more suitable walk; Leslie has plenty of choice that will suit anybody's level. Still the walkers in this workout are more or less fit and of diverse ages. As always you can take it a notch down if need be.

The music is upbeat and makes you wanna dance, really easy to get into the ""party"" and Leslie is as bubbly as always and i just love the way she makes the miles pass so fast! You do have the option to work out with the music only but personally I prefer to hear her cues ;) If you've got the blues, put it on and i'm sure your mood would have changed by the time you've walked these 3 miles ;)

You have Leslie traditional moves and some new ones like twisting, straight jumping jacks... the moves are good for your entire body and all easy to follow!

Warm up is about 3 min.
1st mile about 12 min.
2nd mile about 14 min.
3rd mile about 11 min,
Cool down about 6 min.

I love the 4 sets of HIIT (High Intensity Interval Training) they really get you moving, do kick your heart beat. They are perfect to lose fat or keep lean! They really boost your metabolism, after you're done you feel great! Like another reviewer said they are not overwhelming, not exhausting, don't last too long, i found them easy to keep up with.

The songs you will hear are:

I like to move it
Let's get loud
Everybody talks
Get this party started

5894538,3,B00E8A0PNK,"I've used Leslie Sansone DVDs for over 15 years and credit them as a key factor in losing 65 lbs. I have over 20 of them and, good or not so great, they're always good for getting some movement in your day. Leslie is really the best, in my opinion, for offering a consistent, reliable experience that can be adjusted to suit your physical limitations on any given day.

One of her key strengths is an adherence to basic steps that can be exaggerated or otherwise adjusted to increase or decrease intensity, based on your needs.
One of the consistent drawbacks is the audio - transitions, silences, and uneven sound.

In this one, it kind of changes. The audio is finally decent and can be heard over her talking while not drowning her out.

The moves are more dance like, using hip actions and actually bouncing up and down that can't be intensified or exaggerated without possible twisting of back muscles but that probably wouldn't be an issue for younger folks. While incorporating the traditional moves, the twisting and jumping is new to her usual style.

The real issue, for me, was the ""high intensity"" barely got brought my heart rate to 101 while the entire rest of the routine kept it below 98. It was, for me, one massive warm up routine that I could only bulk up by replacing the bounce and step touch swing hips with jumping jacks.

So, by the last HIT set, I had popped in the 4 fast mile dvd on another monitor and found the warm up beat on that dvd was about the same as the HIT pace. I stopped this one 40 minutes in and did the 4 fast mile dvd in order to get the calorie burn I've become accustomed to with her workouts.

This seems, along with previous Kickboxing and Yoga workouts, like an attempt to appeal to popular routines current in gyms in some areas of the country. It is certainly a deviation from her usual style but it also should appeal to a younger audience who may not have the confidence to do intense hip-hop styled dance routines.

Not my thing so I'm glad I rented this one. I do hope Amazon will stream the Walk Slim 4 fast miles or the 5 Fat Burning Miles for those of us who'd like the traditional, long term calorie burn.",1401494400,3,2164,4.381546134663342

I was a little skeptical after reading through some of the more negative reviews, even from some of Leslie's long time fans, but I'm glad I went ahead and ordered this anyway. I too am a big, long time walk at home fan and own several of her other workouts and if I had to hear ""New Attitude"" one more time I was gonna barf. These may not be super hits, but the music is at least (finally) different than the same 3-4 songs that she recycles on her other workouts. Seriously- at least 4 of just the ones I own have New Attitude somewhere in there. I don't mind the new walkers or their overly peppy improv' going on in the background. I will totally own up to using her moves with fast paced zumba music and doing the same goofy stuff myself at home, so that doesn't bother me. And while I sometimes really need Leslie's constant, upbeat, encouraging chatter to get through a workout, I love that I have the option to turn it off sometimes so the workout doesn't start to feel old after awhile. If you're into super intense workouts like p90x and stuff, you may not find her challenging, but I've lost 30 lbs with just her walk at home videos, and she's just my speed!

Just an FYI- the ""hit songs"" repeat twice through the dvd,  but it's not really a big deal in my opinion. She also alternates between the ""hit song"" and non-lyical music that seems to have been made specifically for the dvd, but again, fine by me.

Honestly I find Leslie to be a little ""dorky"" but in a completely good way. She's peppy and has a funny laugh but I like her happy spirit and energy.

I've grown stronger and have essentially ""outgrown"" this as a main workout, but I still use it when I'm feeling particularly tired or as a warm up to a more intense dvd.

5894572,5,B00E8A0PNK,It's a great 45 min work out at home love it! I'd recommend it to those who want to start walking in doors,1397088000,,106,3.652173913043478

Jane",1396483200,,133,4.583333333333333
5894574,4,B00E8A0PNK,It was very fun and I didn't even know I did 2 miles as fast as I did.  The music was popular and energizing.,1396051200,,109,3.5416666666666665
5894575,3,B00E8A0PNK,"Generally speaking, I like this workout  but it does have a few problems.  The biggest plus of all is that Ms. Sansone does not talk as much as usual.  The length of the DVD is nice and there are a few new moves which I like, but there are a couple of old moves which I wish she would remove from her repertoire.  I absolutely hate the move that she calls the bounce which is basically just jumping up and down.  I am no longer eight years old and jumping is not fun-----it just feels like exercise.  The second move that I dislike is the twist that she loves to put in all her newer DVDs.  The twist is fine if you are exercising on a wood or tile floor, but if your are exercising on carpet, you could harm your knees.  Her HIIT segments are nice, but she does throw one in at the end of the DVD that is not consistent with the other four.  It almost seems that Leslie throws in the last HIIT episode as the spur of the moment because all of a sudden she starts to do the moves and the class seems a bit startled.
The DVD is formatted where you can do all the miles or select one of the three miles to do alone.  The problem with doing a single mile is that the HIIT segments start at the end of mile one and continues into mile two.  The HIIT segments should be all contained in mile two, as a result, the program would be easier to break up into smaller segments.
I do have one complaint that has nothing to do with the quality of the exercise program:  the exercise clothing selected for some of the women is not very flattering.  The shirts cling really, really bad on the women's stomachs and make them appear heavier than what they are.  There is one woman, who is really slim, and she appears as if she has a bit of gut.  Please select better apparel next time.
Generally speaking, this DVD is worth buying.",1396051200,2,1816,4.119318181818182
5894576,2,B00E8A0PNK,"I am a big Leslie Sansone fan. My husband and I walk to her DVDs on a regular basis. We have about ten of them. This is not one that we will be using. It just wasn't that great, but try her other stuff because it is an excellent, low impact way to get your exercise in and enjoy it at the same time.",1395964800,2,299,3.6875

5894578,4,B00E8A0PNK,This DVD incorparates some moves that were not in her 5 mile Walk at Home DVD which was the one that got me started.

Excellent and once again, thank you Leslie and all your great walking buddies in this DVD!",1395878400,,390,4.025974025974026
5894580,4,B00E8A0PNK,"This may be the most bright, cheerful, upbeat DVD Leslie has ever done.  It's a three mile walk with great music, people who look like they're having fun, and some of the better production values I've seen on her DVDs.  Songs are: I Like to Move It, Lets Get Loud, ""Get this Party Started"" and Everybody Talks.""  If you do all three miles, it's 48 minutes and the time really flies.  There are four (very) short intervals done at a faster pace - I felt they could have been much longer than the 30 seconds they are, but you can have the hardest workout ever, and if you don't do it because it's not any fun, then what's the point?",1395792000,3,630,4.225
5894581,5,B00E8A0PNK,"I'm a 64 year old female and have always been interested in health and maintaining a trim body.  However, I have found aging requires a few different approaches.  This is my favorite exercise routine and I've tried many.  I like this one for the songs and the beats.  I like Leslie Sansone as she seems more real to me than most exaggerations other fitness leaders claim...and she seems nice.  The outfits the group wears are not embarrassing to look at.  (I'm very bored with macho and narcissism)  The exercises are in keeping with the physical needs and limits of a wide range of ages.  To the geriatric crowd, you can injure your knees if you belt into her exercises too harshly but by maintaining slightly bent knees and reducing impact on the side to side routines, you'll be fine.  Plus, if you don't feel up to some of the moves, you can always just walk to the beat.  I have some of her other routines, but like this one the best.  It addresses cardiovascular, hit training, abdominal toning, and balance very well with moves that if not effortless at first will become such with time and without hating it.  You can also add some arm and leg weights to get a little strength benefit as well.",1395792000,8,1201,4.5092592592592595

It isn't THAT high intensity but it will put a sweat on, even for people who have gained a lot of fitness. She always accommodates beginners too, so this is good at any stage of fitness. The only thing I hoped for was hit songs from MY generation. I had never heard these hit songs before! But they have a good beat. Also, one different feature of this video is you can turn off Leslie's voice and choose to hear the music only. That's great after you've played the video a few times and know what's coming.",1395014400,,620,4.3076923076923075

At times I didn't know if I was participating in a walking video, a hip hop class or an 80s style Jane Fonda aerobics session.
I initially bought this because of the HIIT, but this was not intense and during the low impact periods I felt like I was wasting my time.  I noticed her backup exercises appeared as if they were trying too hard and exaggerating their movements and I wonder if it's because they felt it was too easy.",1393891200,10,503,4.294736842105263

The 3 miles go by very quickly. The other walkers in the video are a great addition and I find myself smiling throughout the video. Now that I've been doing this 3-4 times a week for a month or so, it has gotten a little easier, but I just push myself a little harder - which is another great part to the extra walkers - they each modify the move a little bit, I enjoyed seeing how other people do the moves as I've mostly only ever done Leslie's other videos where she's by herself. The pace is quick, but no so quick I can't do the moves. I do this on carpet in my living room and the super fast walks are hard for me.

My favorite aspect is how much FUN all the walkers seem to be having...it really motivates me, and puts me in a good mood, as I find myself working out and smiling at the same time. :)  This dvd has more of a ""Dancer"" vibe, which was a nice twist on all the traditional moves.  It almost reminded me of a Zumba class, without all the fancy foot work.  The first mile starts off a bit slow, but gradually builds up to a higher intensity..I'm definitely sweating by the end.  Fun music!  One of my new favorites from Leslie.",1392681600,,544,4.233009708737864

In the last few years, she's clearly going after the youth market. That's  fine - but couldn't she do some DVDs with the people we all grew to know (Linda, MaryAnn, Jo, etc.)? Also, I'm sure there's music that could appeal to both older exercisers and young ones, as well. I like a lot of the modern music, but not the things on this DVD just sound like noise. Leslie isn't a 23 year old, so why have her products become so lopsided? The exercises/pace are fine..but, really, no one over 30? She must make money from the DVDs - is she totally unwilling to pay any royalties for decent music???",1391472000,,757,4.4071428571428575

5894630,5,B00E8A0PNK,"I was unsure about this DVD becuase I have tried dancing workouts, especially Zumba and just could not keep up or was convinced my body was getting a good workout. But given that I'm a big Leslie fan, I went ahead and experienced it. Boy did it leave a smile on my face!

**TIME**
There is no timer at all, but given the fact that the music and positive faces keep you occupied, I highly doubt a timer is needed. But it's consisted of 3 miles, which each mile is typically 15 minutes each. The 1 mile complete message will pop up on the bottom left corner without her even saying anything. I think she only mentioned it once. So, the three miles are really connected as one. You just keep going.

**WORKOUT SETUP**
This DVD is really HIGH-intensity. My mother is 50 years old, 202 poundish and was able to keep up. But it wasn't her kind of thing just yet (she's lost 12-16 pounds with Leslie workouts). She just had a problem with not wearing a sports bra, which you WILL need for this workout. But she felt she wasn't entirely ready for a workout like this. There is a lot of jumping/bounce, twists, shifts. I am around 163 pounds and this workout was fine with me. It got me catching my breath but it wasn't an impossible workout.

The first part is kind of like a warm-up and then afterward, she gives you a small feel of what to expect. But after that is interval time. You'll do a steady and calm walk for 2 minutes and then for 20 seconds you go into high intensity. I can't help but get so pumped up and excited every time the high intensity part comes, becuase the people are so positive and loud. I think she does the intervals four times. Then after that, you kind of really get into the dancing, which pretty much are the same moves you've done with her before, there is just some modification.

**PEOPLE**
Someone mentioned that it looked like she hired professional dancers. It seems that way for SOME of them, but I don't think so. Sometimes you will see them doing their own thing, having just a little too much fun. Some will sing and maybe even be too dramatic about it. I remember sometimes being a little annoyed, but oh well. Laura from Five Really Big Miles DVD is there. I LOVED seeing her still in the game and I hope to see more of her in other DVDs. My most favorite person was Marvin (in all black with a hat). He seems like a sweet guy and I never fail to develop this warm feeling every time the camera is on him. Nick from Walk it Off in 30 days is there. He looks way different without his beard. Overall, everybody is in rainbows and unicorns. Way too happy, but VERY inspiring.

**MUSIC**
The music is actually very impressive. It's very moving and it makes you want to give your best. There was maybe one song that was 'bleh'. But I'd give it a 4.5/5.

**MY EXPERIENCE**
First try = Burned 292 calories
Second Try = Burned 285
Third try - Burned 272 calories
The trick is to exaggerate arm movement!

I did try this workout with wrist weights and while it's possible, your arms will get really tired, especially with all the jumping and twisting, but it really adds to the arms getting a more fair workout. I had 1.5 pounds each.

I usually combine this workout with her other DVD called Walk to the hits Party Songs and just do them both at the same time.

Very cool workout.",1390780800,3,3310,4.308681672025723

5894632,5,B00E8A0PNK,"Like this DVD--more modern music and younger walkers.  Myself, a senior, had no trouble keeping up.  Long time Leslie walker and enjoy her but did like the option to play the music only--some days you just don't need the talk.",1390608000,2,226,4.625

5894635,5,B00E8A0PNK,This is definitely one I recommend. I love the streaming option for workouts it saves having to look for the DVD or store them. In this work out she mixes her walking routine up a bit. It is a total of 3 miles.  I broke it down to 1 mile a day. The music keeps you pumped up and the group she has with her is awesome as well.,1390262400,2,325,3.710144927536232

5894638,5,B00E8A0PNK,"I  have been a jazzerciser for 27 years.  I love it more than any other form of exercise I have ever done.  So, that said, it is dance exercise that most motivates me.  I have probably about a half dozen of Leslie's videos, bought in the last few years for fillers at home.  It is upbeat, the music is fun and makes me want to move, which is probably the most important thing about it.  These guys on the video are fun!!!! They'tre into it .!  I pulls me in and pushes me to move!  Inspiring!  I realize that not all people are touched by the music as much as I , and it doesn't matter to them what the people on the videos do, as long as they're doing it right.  I realize that some people can mechanically go thru the mental discipline of pushing themselves thru any kind of exercise, whether its boring or not, or they just don't care as long as they get it done.  Not me. I am not knocking those people.  But I will continue to buy into  the more dancing and entertaining type of  exercise. And this is it.  By the way, I'm 58.  If I can't have fun exercising, I won't do it!",1390089600,,1079,4.042654028436019
5894639,4,B00E8A0PNK,"I basically love almost everything about this DVD workout. I love 3-mile walks, they're the perfect duration for me. There is only one thing that bothers me--the HIIT sessions are only 30 seconds long; it wasn't quite enough time to bring my heart rate up.  I was hoping the HIIT sessions on this DVD would be similar to 4 Mile Power Walk DVD, which contains 6 cycles of 2 minute ""power surges"".  I think the HIIT sessions should be a minimum of 1 minute at the very least.

Nonetheless, I still enjoyed this DVD a lot.  Awesome walkers, great energy, upbeat music, and it's only 45 minutes or so.  Even though the HIIT sessions were short, I still feel like it's a good workout",1390003200,,678,4.435483870967742

I appreciate the good music and the ""music-only"" feature, as it's the music that keeps me exercising in the moment as well as coming back for more the next morning.  My only complaint is that I purchased this, and then due to winter storms, had to wait an extra week to receive it.  By that time, the DVD was much cheaper.

I think the dancers in the DVD are a bit of a  distraction and I would rather see some of Leslie's other walkers from her previous DVDs. Some of the dancers in this DVD look like they were doing hip hop dancing rather than power walking. I do have to agree with one of the other reviews that I think that the two leaders should have been in the front not in the back where they were hardly even seen. But I do have to say that the DVD was very fun to work out with and I do hope that Leslie does make some more of these dvds with a longer amount of miles and more walkers that more people can relate to.. I would have given it 5 stars had it been a longer dvd.",1389052800,,834,3.8430232558139537

A big disappointment for me is that I didn't care for the music at all.  Some folks have really liked this one but for me it is not a good value.,1388620800,3,318,4.0

5894654,4,B00E8A0PNK,Leslie Sansone format DVD. Enjoyed the music and the steps were easy to follow - not a really HARD program to follow - the intensity is just about right for me. She has a couple of other workouts that can be challenging - the 5 miles ones with jogging.,1388361600,,252,4.163265306122449
5894655,2,B00E8A0PNK,"Let me start by saying that I am a very loyal Leslie Sansone fan. I have 18 DVDs and exercise with her 5-7 times a week. I love her attitude about focusing on health rather than on your weight and her bubbly, positive personality keeps me motivated. With that said, I must say I am very disappointed with this DVD. I had read many negative reviews about it but decided to purchase it anyway because there have been others with negative reviews that I ended up loving. This is not the case with Walk to the HITS. I felt this DVD was not motivating or as organized as they usually are. While there were some new moves (which I like) I felt they were just thrown in there without a lot of verbal directions or proper cueing. I like the music as it is upbeat but I could see how other reviewers do not like it as it does not really include what I would consider to be ""hit"" music. Also, the HIIT definitely did not get my heart rate up like I would expect from this method and after each HIIT she takes it down way too far to about a resting state. Needless to say, it did not really cause me to breathe heavy or sweat which is what I want from a workout. The last thing that threw me for a loop was the fact that you complete your 3rd ""mile"" at the end of the stretch. While I suppose the DVD does not really claim to be a 3 mile walk, you would not expect to finish a mile with a stretch. All in all I was disappointed with the DVD, but I still love Leslie and will still continue to work out with her, and will even still use this DVD. I will just have to use it on days I am looking for a lighter workout.",1388275200,5,1605,3.987577639751553

This one is designed to reach a younger crowd, which is fine, with more dancing and hopping around, and less emphasis on building to calorie burning or endurance levels.  Just my preference, if I spend 30-45 minutes on a workout, I want to feel it afterward.

I long for the type of music that was on one of Cher's old VHS tapes.  She had her own music as well as other well known artists.  It was a blast to exercise to.  I do like that this one gives you the option to use the music without Leslie talking.  I like her a lot but she just NEVER stops talking.  I would like to see her do one where she would just tone it down. It is bitter sweet, because I do like her enthusiasm as it is very motivating but really gets annoying when she talks thorough the entire walk.  Just my opinion of course.  Others may love that part of her workouts.",1386460800,,757,3.9019607843137254

Maybe it is just me and I don't know enough about music. The workout is ok......the one thing I did not like about it is that the miles are not broken up into separate workouts. I liked her other DVD's where you can set it to a 2 mile workout and you get a two mile workout from beginning to end. This one is not like that. If you set it to the three mile workout you are already two miles into the workout......so you really need to do it from the beginning all the way through to get the whole workout in. Not really her best one.....but she still gives you a workout. It is more intense than the ones I had been doing since it has the High Intensity Intervals....but I have had two knees replaced and the thing I liked about Leslie's workouts the best was there was no jogging or running or jumping in the ones I had done before. You DO all of those in this one....so it is much harder on your joints....so if you have knee problems.....you may not want to get this one.,1385510400,2,1121,4.194444444444445

5894688,5,B00E8A0PNK,It is a great tape to keep in shape and interested in weekly workouts.  Before I purchased the tape I read other reviews and one review stated that they thought the tape had people just doing their own thing I feel said people are of diffent ages and can the perform the movements faster or slower.  But I recommend this tape I am a senior who works out five days a week and I use this tape.,1385337600,,391,4.064935064935065
5894689,1,B00E8A0PNK,"I have about 6 of Leslie's walk tapes.  I recently purchase 6 different ones as I have used mine so often I am tired of listening to them.  I like Leslie's walks and I particularly like that she doesn't have an official routine - meaning you don't do this, then add the next step, then do these first two steps and add a third, etc.  This is called ""add on"" and I don' t like it because you wind of doing the first couple of steps  dozens of  times.
I know from experience that the covers of her tapes have been updated so are not a good indicator of how Old the DVD really is - and that is the case on the DVD ""Walk to the Hits, Radio Remixes.""  I tried to find a record date (not cover date, that is on the DVD) and couldn't so just took my chances because I had to get some new walks.
The recording is older, I can't tell how old, but older.  Now the music - don't buy this tape for it.  Except for maybe 2 songs the music is not exciting and another thing is that each song is only played for a short time before a new one comes on and lastly regarding the music there are Long pauses (at times) between songs.
Now this is the first of her DVDs that had the option to have Music Only.  I started the walk and she said something like I will get around to introducing all the walkers, and there were a lot.  I stopped the DVD and went back and turned on Music Only option.  Her continual, non-stop, chit-chat drives me crazy.  I'm not interested in who is in the DVD, or their stories, etc.  Perhaps its nice, but not for me.  Since the music was pushed on the DVD I did find the walk was a bit more ""funky"", very moderately dance-y (don't worry no really dancing).  The walk, 3 miles, was okay.  Not my favorite by far.

5894691,4,B00E8A0PNK,"Ok, this video has some things going for it, but it also has some drawbacks. Let's boost before we knock:

PLUS:
-The music is decent, and it's mostly from this century.
-The workout itself is fun.
-The walkers are mostly new (I only recognized two people from previous videos), but they're a decent bunch. They're not all 22 and perfect, which is nice, because the last few videos had all young, super- fit people.
-I really like 3-mile start-to-finish workouts, and this suits me just fine. No grabbing the remote to make my own workout (which is really not that big a deal) or mixing up the programs (which is also just fine). With this one, I just hit play and know I'll be getting in a good 45 minutes of movement,

MINUS:
-The set looks like a 1970's children's TV show about the love of music. Actually, it looks like the set of some of her other videos (the one with the stairway on the left side) with a completely abysmal peach and pink color scheme. Ad then some design genius stuck musical notes all over the wall. Really, the set is a mess.  The only positive thing is that they got rid of the conversation pit area on the right, which never mde any kind of sense. Why is there a conversation area in what is supposed to be a gym?
-As much as I like the music, it bugs me that they repeat the same songs throughout the workout. There's no reason each HIIT session had to use the same music- they could very easily have used different, fast-paced music during each session.
-The HIIT sessions really aren't that strenuous- I think that her old- fashioned boosts are more of a workout. That said, I was kind of annoyed when she did 3 or 4 HIIT intervals, then waited a good 12 minutes or so before including what is basically one of her boost sessions.

NEITHER HERE NOR THERE-
Several walkers looked as though they had dressed for Zumba class and ended up in Leslie Land by mistake.

All in all, the minuses (other than the butt-ugly set) are really minor. I'm sure this will become a
regular in my rotation of Leslie videos.

OK, I've now done this DVD several times.  The set is still God-forsakenly ugly, and some of the walkers are just trying too hard (this isn't really their fault, though- Leslie has always struck me as an overly-cheerful mom type, the one who thinks she's hip to what the kids are doing these days- for example, she got all excited because one of the walkers can moonwalk.  It's 2013, Leslie- the time for excitement for that was just about 30 years ago when MJ did it on Motown 25). And I HATE the cover versions of songs- this may not be her fault, but how is it that they can get the rights to songs that came out last year, like ""Everybody Talks"", yet have a fake KidsBop version of ""I'm Comin' Out""? Still, I can get through it once I get past her (well-meaning) corniness.  This is HIIT for the old and hobbled- from all the things I've read, proper HIIT training is supposed to leave you exhausted and requires more than just running in place, things like Burpees and other affronts to both God and man.  So on that front, I'm ok with the Leslie version- I want to exercize without killing my wee self.

Oh, and this one is lots better than the ""Party HIITs"" DVD.  Just did that one this morning.  Will write a separate review of THAT particular treasure.",1384905600,3,3300,4.381342062193126

5894710,3,B00E8A0PNK,"NOTE:  I received a free copy of this DVD to review for the web site Metapsychology Online Reviews; you can read a more detailed version of my review on that site.

Leslie Sansone's news release is a bit different.  First, it is a three mile walk set to modern radio hits.  Second, it supposedly features HIIT, or High Intensity Interval Training, a popular current fitness trend.  Unfortunately, Sansone's version of ""HIIT"" doesn't conform to the usual norms for this style (more on this below).

As always, Sansone instructs live in front of a large class.  On the Main Menu of the DVD, there is the choice to play the full Radio Remixes or to play Miles 1-3 individually; also, each of these selections has a ""Play with Music Only"" option.  I have provided additional details below.

WARM-UP (3 minutes)
The warm-up can be accessed by choosing the ""Play All"" option only.  As is typical for her warm-ups, Sansone introduces her four basic steps: the walk (march), side step, kicks, and knees.

MILE 1 (13 minutes)
The first mile starts appropriately with the tune ""Get This Party Started"" by Pink (the same song is repeated at the beginning of Mile 3).  Sansone begins at a fast pace, adding many variations on her usual walk steps, including grapevines, bounces, and shifts.  Oddly, however, prior to starting the ""HIIT,"" she actually spends about two minutes SLOWING DOWN the heart rate by walking at a more relaxed tempo.  The ""HIIT"" sequences themselves last about 20 seconds.  They are very repetitive, as they consist of the EXACT same moves (high jogs, bounces, and twists) set to the EXACT same song (""Everybody Talks"" by Neon Trees).

MILE 2 (14 minutes)
The second mile is very similar to the first.  As with Mile 1, there are about two ""HIIT"" intervals; preceding each interval, the walking moves are performed at a slower pace.  After completing the HIIT segments, however, Sansone again bumps up the speed.  This section includes the song ""I Like to Move It, Move It"" (Will. I.Am).

MILE 3 (13 minutes)
In some ways, the final mile was the most confusing.  Sansone says she is going to ""sneak in"" some additional HIIT, but rather than perform another 20-second interval, instead, she does a longer, more moderate intensity sequence.  For the second half of this mile, the music has a bit of a Latin flavor to it, and by the time the clock hits the 40-minute mark, Sansone states that the cool-down walk has begun.

STRETCH (3 minutes)
For this brief stretch (included only as part of the full walk), Sansone targets the back, shoulders, calves, and hamstrings.

As noted above, the ""HIIT"" that Sansone includes in this walk is definitely NOT true High Intensity Interval Training, which is generally defined as working at near maximum intensity for a short period--usually about 20 seconds, which Sansone does do here--followed by a brief recovery (a 2:1 rest-to-work ratio is probably the most common).  So, anyone purchasing this DVD because it advertises ""HIIT"" on the cover is likely to be extremely disappointed.

On the other hand, it is undeniable that the background exercisers are having a great deal of fun with this routine.  As the workout continues, Sansone more frequently walks among them, obviously enjoying herself.  For long-time fans of Sansone's DVDs, Radio Remixes could possibly be a very agreeable change of pace.  As a high intermediate exerciser, however, I rate it 3 1/2 stars at best.",1384041600,3,3427,4.880622837370242

I've been doing LS walking for a while now and got very bored with the walkers, music, and same old steps. I got this hoping for more motivation and for me, it delivers. I like the different ages, diverse bodies, and REALLY like the intervals. It has a small amount of jogging and jumping jacks, but those are easily modified and the dance steps are super simple. If you want to work up a good sweat, it's very doable by following the more animated walkers. If there's anything I wish was different, it would be my expectations of current music of which there is very little, but it's still way less archaic than any of her other CD's music.

5894729,3,B00E8A0PNK,"I am a big fan of Leslie Sansone, my ""Sister in Sweat"" but this DVD just didn't do it for me.  The theme of this workout is a walk to the hits with HIIT training, but I think Leslie missed the mark.  The first mile is pretty slow.  The second mile incorporates what Leslie considers HIIT training, but it really isn't traditional HIIT training, it's just jogging.  Between the ""HIITS"" Leslie wants you to bring your heart rate down, but I think the pace is way too slow to stay in a good fat burning zone.  One thing I noticed is that during the ""HIIT"" segments, she never says what to do, she just says ""GO! Go! GO!"". Some of the background exercisers do high knee runs, some do regular jogs, some are a little dancier.  I think the next time I do this workout I will do my own moves, like jumping jacks and skaters to get more of a burn.  She adds one last ""HIIT"" in the third mile, which was nice to keep the heart rate up.  Another complaint that I have is that the 3rd mile ends during the end of the stretch, so the workout isn't really a true 3 miles.  The reason why I give it 3 stars is because although I felt the beginning was slow and boring, the second half picked up the pace and was more like the Leslie that I know and love from her more recent offerings.  I might just start the workout at mile 2 next time.  One other complaint that I have is that the music completely stops at the end of each song and Leslie and her backgrounders seem to have trouble finding the beat.  This is really bothersome when you use the music only option because there are periods of dead silence.  Another thing to note is that not all of the music is hit songs, some of it is just instrumental typical workout video music (another disappointment).

Overall, I think this workout is OK for an off day (recovery from illness, don't feel like working out, etc.) or for a beginner exerciser (don't be afraid of the HIITS, Leslie says you can keep the jogging and bouncing low impact if you need to).  I was expecting more energy out of the cast and more fun from this workout.  Leslie's workouts usually put me in a happy place but this one left me in a bad mood with my disappointment.  I realize that I can do my own moves to increase the intensity, but that defeats the pupose of purchasing a DVD.  Before I purchased this DVD, I was highly anticipating her next Walk to the Hits DVD (Party Songs), due out in December, but I have decided to skip that one...",1381449600,26,2455,4.220556745182013

I hope she does more with the HIIT format and the current music.  I was getting tired of that canned music.",1381276800,2,409,4.534246575342466

If you have done walk at home for a while then get this one.  It is a 3 mile workout at the 12 minute mile pace.  It incorporates high intensity ""bursts"" to get your heart really pumping.

They were dressed kinda quirky and I had to REALLY try to focus on Leslie only and try not to watch the others who were pretty much DANCING thruout the entire workout. I am pretty new to Leslie and exercizing, but feel that I prefer her not as recent more traditional walking videos like Walk Slim. I am also 49 years old so that may be the reason!

5894735,5,B00E8A0PNK,"Ok, I have just about every tape Leslie has put out.  Some of her older ones I could give away because they are just too boring, sorry but a cast that is not motivating along with horrible music.  Her most recent tapes are her BEST!  I have read reviews about her abandoning her walk concept which I couldn't disagree with more.  Also, it was time for her to change it up with new music, walkers and moves.  In some of her older workouts I was very unmotivated seeing some fairly out of shape and not coordinated walk leaders.  I am so glad she has a younger, more fit group.  This tape was very easy for me, I weighted myself and boosted most of it but I just loved it and had about the most fun I have had with any of her tapes.  I also do Physique 57 and some kettle bell workouts. pilates etc. but sometimes you just want to have fun and this is the tape for that while getting your heartbeat up there for a good 45 minutes.  I urge people to try it, I don't think you be will disappointed!",1380931200,4,994,4.082474226804123
5894736,5,B00E8A0PNK,"I really liked this video, especially the HIIT intervals. However I expected more radio remixes, was a little disappointed that there wasn't more new music. The walkers outfits were a little out there too. :) Overall I liked the energy and fun the cast brought to the walk. Would definitely recommend, a good workout for any exercise level.

I have now done this DVD repeatedly and if you choose the Music only option totally makes all the difference there is a lot of good songs on here and it is super fun. The regular play option they must get rid of the lyrics.",1380931200,24,585,4.528301886792453
5894737,3,B00E8A0PNK,"I really looked forward to getting this as I am a fan of Leslie's workouts.  This workout was not as challenging as some of her others.  The HIT concept jas been used more effectively in other workouts, and I thought the pace of this was a bit repetitve and boring.

5894738,5,B00E8A0PNK,"I love this workout! I really enjoy Leslie's workouts and I'm very happy that she is offering different versions of her walking program in order to keep from getting bored and have some variety. I own many of her DVD's, and its nice to have options that fit my mood and energy level for the day. I'm 37, and already in menopause, so energy level is a extra challenge. I appreciate this video helping burn as many calories as a longer workout for days I don't want to workout for a hour or more doing a 5 mile walk. Thank you Leslie!!! I'm anxiously awaiting the second HIIT workout due out in December. I am a life long Leslie walker and this is one of my new favorites...",1380844800,4,672,4.2578125
5894739,4,B00E8A0PNK,"Nice way to return to exercise. 3 miles plus warm up and short stretches at end, finished in 47 mins, as promised.  Music is engaging, step variety works lower body, some arm work to elevate heart rate.  Wish she'd used low impact moves in the high intensity segments.

Leslie's enthusiastic and encouraging; wish her cueing was consistent, as she cues early and then late, which is frustrating when learning the workout, & this is similar to many of her workouts.

Love the music only option for days when I don't want the chatter.

Some performers improvise/personalize the moves with brazilian and hip hop inspirations... an unexpected twist, and okay for me.

I'm glad I bought it, as it is prepping me for more challenging material; and this will remain a reliable, effective staple in the inventory.",1380844800,60,805,4.882352941176471
5894740,5,B00E8A0PNK,"This just came to my house today and I was so eager to give it a try that I did it right away. I have several of Leslie's DVDs, and this one is pretty different from any of them. It's my new favorite!

Some things I loved:
-upbeat music was fun to move to
-large, diverse group of walkers of all ages (some of her recent videos have mostly been very young women, and I like seeing some women my age and some who aren't a ""perfect"" body shape)
-different moves to shake up the routine, but integrated in with her normal moves so that I never felt overwhelmed by trying to learn a ton of new steps
-they did the whole thing in one long walk, instead of a break/change of people between each mile. I like to see them all get sweaty; it makes me feel better when I'm working my butt off!
-the walkers in this DVD just seem to be having so much fun. I loved that. It really did give me more energy and enjoy the walk more.
-the HIIT section was not overwhelming or exhausting (four sets of two minutes moderate cardio and 30 seconds high impact fast jogging/twisting), but it definitely got my heart rate up
-length of 3 miles (45 minutes) is my favorite length to exercise
-I like the brisk pace throughout. Very energetic

Some things to consider:
-If you love Leslie's older walks, you might find this one kind of disconcerting, because it is VERY different
-It is a lot more ""dancy"" than most of her workouts that I've done, but again, I'm like the least graceful dancy person ever, and I felt like it was doable
-If you don't like newer music you might hate this, although it's not 100% radio hits; it's about 50/50 with remixed hits and then music that is more like her traditional stuff
-this does include high impact, though not a ton, and she shows you how to modify. Still, if you can't do high impact you might want to look for one of her older walks.

All in all-- I love this workout and I'm very pleased with my purchase!",1380758400,259,1930,4.253405994550409
5894741,2,B00E8A0PNK,"I rec'd this video yesterday I was very excited, because it was new.  I like the idea of walking to the hits.  First of all, it looks as if a group of professional hip hop dancers were hired to be the ""walkers"", it was very obvious in the manner that most of the walkers moved that they have dance backgrounds.  There are maybe 3 walkers in the video, who are actual walk leaders and they are in the back.  It was very distracting and sometimes down right annoying the way that some of the ""walkers"" moved there bodies.  Leslie is using a new concept called HIIT, where she includes bursts of jogging in place and shifting your weight for a higher calorie burn.  She does this in a few other videos , she has just given it a new name.

I am a little disappointed in the entire video, the ""walkers"" look as if they are trying too hard to have fun and Leslie looks bored at times.  I am not a fan of the use of dance moves, and frankly Leslie looks uncomfortable.",1380758400,30,961,4.184782608695652
5894742,3,B00E8A0PNK,"I LOVED Leslie's Ultimate 5 Day Walk Plan. Those 12 min miles can be killers! This one, not so much. It was 30 min before I started sweating, and I was using a 3 lb pair of walking weights! The Hiit training was ok. It was really just 30 seconds of jogging, then 2 min of bringing the heart rate down (maybe a little too much), then repeat that a few times. The 1 mile marker came in at 15 min, 2 miles at 29 min, and 3 miles came up after the stretch, which was a little weird to me. Leslie is her usual bubbly self. I love her. But this one just wasn't as good as the 5 Day Walk Plan. She even calls this an advanced walk at the end of the workout. There's lots of bouncy, high-impact moves, maybe that's why, but it was definitely not as hard as the other one. If you are just starting out, this would be a challenge, but if you're used to more intensity, this one might leave you a little disappointed.",1380672000,102,906,3.9835164835164836
