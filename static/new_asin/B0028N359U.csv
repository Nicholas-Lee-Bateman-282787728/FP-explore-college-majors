This was just as great as the first movie.
 An airplane 3 would make my day,I thrive on funny. Love it",1369353600,,179,4.114285714285714
8356417,5,B0028N359U,I picked up this two movie combo for a great price to add two comedy classics to my DVD collection. Arrived as promised.,1363564800,,120,4.260869565217392
8356418,4,B0028N359U,"two great flicks, good quality dvds, only complaint is ""airplane 2"" is edited, that should be noted in the ad. still great deal!",1356220800,,128,4.608695652173913
8356419,4,B0028N359U,"It wasn't until searching on Amazon did I realize that one DVD product containing both airplane spoof movies--Airplane! and Airplane II The Sequel--even existed.  Because I saw very little reviewed on this product, I expected disappointment when I took the plunge.

But Shirley I was impressed!  The quality of the picture in both films was something I'd rank high in the air.  There was zero herky jerky turbulence, and the jokes seemed just as fresh as when I saw them as a kid.

True, the ""Hi Jack"" scene is missing from this release as others had mentioned.  In fact, the only extra feature offered is Commentary and Trailer for the first movie.  But I still lift this one off the ground!",1344902400,2,692,4.669421487603306
8356420,1,B0028N359U,"I ordered this airplane 2 movie DVD and received it quickly and in new condition exactly as expected.  It had been a very long time since ny wife or myself had ssen these DVD movies.  We thought we had purchased a couple of funny family oriented movies that my children and others could watch and enjoy.  We forced ourselves to watch the first movie to its end.  The foul language and clandestine and sometimes blatant adult themes made it unacceptable for the intended use we had in mind.  Are we just prudes?  The answer to that is I don't think so. We are, however, concerned to what is played in my home.  I would not tolerate someone in my house behaving that way, and I refuse to let that garbage in my home on DVD.  It may be a good movie for some, but for me and my house will not tolerate this trash.",1343606400,,809,4.207792207792208
8356421,5,B0028N359U,"These are two of the funniest movies I've ever seen! Altho the sequel recycles a lot of the jokes from the original, it still manages to be funny in it's own rite, too. I would recommend it to anyone. It is funny to all age groups!",1313625600,,231,4.043478260869565
8356422,4,B0028N359U,"I couldn't find any info on this release other than the title and picture, so I took a chance and am happily surprised. This is an official Paramount release (i.e. not from a no-name, 3rd-party distributor, like one might fear) and contains the same discs that come in Paramount's original, 2000 releases of both movies. Just to emphasize, that means that ""Airplane!"" is NOT the newer ""'Don't Call Me Shirley' Edition,"" but that's to be expected. This was probably Paramount's idea for selling off their stock of the original release. For the price (having both movies for the price of one) and having both in a single case, I'm fine with the 2000 releases. Oh, also, they're both widescreen editions. Basically, if you want more info on features, special features, cuts and so on, simply look up the original, 2000 releases of both movies, since those discs are exactly what you're getting here, just in a single case with slightly different art.",1277078400,24,947,4.851851851851852
