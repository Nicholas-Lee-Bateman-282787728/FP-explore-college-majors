The combination of music, exceptional casting of voice actors and the animation made these so enjoyable we wanted to share them with grandchild. When they appeared in DVD we wanted to buy our favorites from the set.",1391126400,,291,4.959183673469388

5317387,4,B009D4GX4Q,narrated by another favorite actor as well as a favorite artist. I'm a fan of animation and I was curious about this film as well as The Legend of Sleepy Hollow. I was so used to Disney's take on classics that I either didn't know the classic or just couldn't remember them. This particular tale is one I heard or saw too many spins on to know the correct one so I decided to take a peek. It was very well done and the ending was a bit of a shock but it was a great story!!!,1367625600,,474,3.8969072164948453

5317391,5,B009D4GX4Q,"Kids love this lively tale of one of America's African-American pioneers. In a time when reading and math overshadow history, this story segues into a discussion of the opening of the American West. It's funny, entertaining, and a great way to introduce tall tales to kids.",1360454400,3,273,4.956521739130435
