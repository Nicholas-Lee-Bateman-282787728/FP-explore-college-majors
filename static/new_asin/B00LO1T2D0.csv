8667070,2,B00LO1T2D0,"Monkey Boy lives in the basement of his keeper. When she dies he is free to roam as he explores the countryside. There is a major subplot of an investigator with his autistic daughter Agata.

This is an avant-garde Italian horror-fairy tale dubbed in English. Monkey Boy has a constant bad camera angle, shaking, and terrible swagger music in order for us to feel his confusion and panic. I felt annoyed more than anything. In the film, everyone seems to have something different about them, mostly genetically speaking, as we examine the various degrees society ostracizes people, in what I gather ti be the deeper theme of the film.

In spite of ""I think I got it"" the film wasn't entertaining, watching night scenes, going back to the origins of Monkey Boy which I has figured out in the first 10 minutes of the film. I would have done it sooner, but the first 7 minutes is narration with cartoon drawings which we hear again later.

Guide: F-bomb. No sex or nudity. Nominated for a number of awards by people who love Italian horror films.",1440460800,2,1043,4.627027027027027
8667071,4,B00LO1T2D0,"The story is an odd mix of fantasy, drama, and horror with stoic characters that seem to be a little bit nonsensical. It has plenty of heart, even as dark a fairy tale as it is. Monkey Boy plays out in a surreal melodrama with characters that are only partially defined. These aspects of the story come off more intentional instead of in error. This is probably due to the fact that the two main characters are a mutant and an autistic girl. Either way the style of storytelling used for Monkey Boy works wonderfully, and creates a captivating adventure with actors that give believable characters.

The special effects are on the milder side and only used to enhance the harsh world this fairy tale world creates. The effects are practical and habitual tricks common in Italian horror. The overall outcome of the special effects and visual style that Monti uses is reminiscent of 80s spaghetti thrillers. More importantly they work. The cinematography is haunting, shades of poor lighting, tight frame shots and atmospheric surrealism. Monkey Boy gives good giallo vision. A style that is as contemporary as it is classic. Considering the story content and creature effects required of the film I was pleasantly surprised to see that things came together as well as they did. The sounds used aren't really anything major but the instrumental effects accentuate the already dark fairy tale theme nicely, giving an added emotional energy.

Overall Monkey Boy is a nice Italian fantasy, horror film. There is some odd moments that were a bit confusing but I think that they were more cultural difference than directing or writing flaws. The film will not appeal to all horror fans, and the parallel drama that mirrors fairytale with actual character prose (the monkey boy and Agata of the fairytale kingdom and that of the real world characters) has moments that are not as authentic as intended. However the total result of Monkey Boy is a well directed, oddly entertaining fantasy that delivers both in story and horror.",1431129600,,2020,4.9208211143695015
