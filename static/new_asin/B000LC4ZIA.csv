2706628,5,B000LC4ZIA,An excellent set of the classic Addams Family series! Can't wait for series three to complete the set!!,1177459200,2,103,4.777777777777778
2706629,5,B000LC4ZIA,"For me, the Addams Family works better than The Munsters because these are, basically, real people instead of monsters. Back in the 60's, I remember an article that said the Addamses weren't ""monsters,"" but rather ""non-conformists."" Okay, that works for me. This second DVD set finishes off Season One and begins Season Two.

The show had a great, classic cast with actors that amazingly resembled the actual characters in Charles Addams' original cartoons. It's sad to note that many members of the Addams Family program has passed away: Jackie Coogan (Uncle Fester), Ted Cassidy (Lurch), Blossom Rock (Grandmama) and, extra-sadly, Carolyn Jones (Morticia). Still with us are the great John Astin (Gomez), Ken Weatherwax (Pugsley), Felix Silla (Cousin Itt) and Lisa Loring (Wednesday).

And what a wonderful rapport these cast members had! If you pay attention to the sexual tension between Gomez and Morticia, it might make you wonder how they got away with it in the prudent mid-60's. Gomez's horniness is constant in every episode - and any red-blooded male watching this will be green with envy! Carolyn Jones has never looked sexier in ANY of her other roles than she did in ""The Addams Family."" That long, black flowing hair shrouded over her vampirish/goth dress, her sultry voice and her facial expressions make her sexier than ANY 60's TV vixens - more so than Samantha, Jeannie, Ginger, Mary Ann or Elly May!

There's a short featurette with more insight and trivia about the Addams Family that you'll get a kick out of; it's shorter than the first volume's featurette but you'll still learn interesting tidbits.

Watch closely for some bloopers! Among them is a close-up of Thing where you can barely see the top of Ted Cassidy's head under the table (Ted's hand was ""Thing"" for most of the series - when you saw Lurch and Thing in the same scene, it was obviously someone else!).

A character actor that made a few appearances on the show is Jimmy Cross; I've been wondering if it's the same Jimmy Cross who had a minor chart single with the morbid I WANT MY BABY BACK in 1965 - the song tells the tale of a guy whose girlfriend passes away; he goes to the graveyard, digs her up and crawls into the coffin with her - song fades out. The song is something that fits the Addams mold, so if anyone knows if it's the same Jimmy Cross, lemme know!

This is pure escapism that is hard not to like. Silly, yes. Unbelievable, sure. Predictable, sometimes. Irresistable - you betcha! Forget the 6:00 News and settle in with this DVD set. You'll be surprised at how good you feel after watching.",1176940800,7,2599,4.751662971175167
2706630,4,B000LC4ZIA,"I have reviewed a fair number of DVD sets that collect TV series, and have tried to focus on the original content while disregarding the larger aspects of the DVD package. After all, the majority of fans buy these packages for the original episodes, and DVD bonus items are usually inconsequential gravy. I even discussed this same matter in my review for Addams Family Volume 1. But alas, for Volume 2, I am compelled to break my own rules and dock the DVD package one star for reasons that have nothing to do with the greatness of the original episodes. MGM must be criticized for stretching the two original seasons into three DVD releases, regardless of their PR about making each set more affordable. What really creates the expense is the addition of modern bonus material, and here, that material is so thin and weak that it reveals, harshly, MGM's real motives for putting the Addams Family show on DVD. The key bonus item is a brief and poorly-produced documentary on a squishy subject - the influence of the show on pop culture - with most of the commentary coming from C-list cronies and hangers-on who crowd out the under-utilized John Astin. The other bonus items here are even less useful, including unfunny ""commentary"" on a few episodes by stand-ins for Thing and Cousin Itt, and a feature called ""Tombstone Trivia"" on a couple of episodes, which is merely pop-up tidbits that appear on the screen an average of once every several minutes.

So beware that your love of the classic Addams Family show is being manipulated by modern cheaply-created corporate filler. As for the show itself, hopefully it will still be easy for you to love the episodes that are presented here. Rest assured that these episodes still brutally satirize the typical middle-American sitcom family and subversively reveal much deeper family values. These episodes also feature many crucial character developments. Important advancements include ""Morticia Meets Royalty"" in which Thing falls in love, and ""Lurch the Teenage Idol"" in which our faithful butler accidentally becomes a rock star. The highlight of this package is surely the two-part ""Morticia's Romance,"" in which the sexy Carolyn Jones manages to be fetching in three different ways - as the present Morticia, the younger Morticia, and her sister Ophelia. That episode also features Margaret (Wicked Witch of the West) Hamilton as Morticia's mother. As noted above, I have broken my own rule about ignoring modern DVD packaging practices while assessing only the original content. But here, try not to let your love for the episodes be damaged by the weaknesses of the package. [~doomsdayer520~]",1176508800,41,2650,5.0227272727272725
2706631,5,B000LC4ZIA,What is not to like about the Addams Family?  Very much worth the money.,1176163200,2,72,4.142857142857143
2706632,5,B000LC4ZIA,Better than the munsters...has a different style of humor that appeals to me more.,1174089600,5,82,4.928571428571429
2706633,5,B000LC4ZIA,"The Addams Family TV show was based on a series of cartoons started back in the 1930's and authored by Charles Addams for the New Yorker. Whether or not Addams intended for there to be some kind of Depression-era message on the idle rich being scary in more ways than one I do not know, but it does seem like that is one of the messages trying to come through all the dark humor. What I do know is that a show this offbeat and creative would never get aired on network TV today, and even if it did, the minute it got successful the network suits would start tinkering with it and ruin it. If you need an example of this phenomena, I point you in the direction of Lost. Back in the mid 1960's, TV seasons were actually so long - basically running week in and week out for nine months - that you would often end up with over 30 episodes a season, thus the odd format of the Addams Family DVDs not breaking at individual seasons.

The Addams' are portrayed as a close knit and happy family - in fact they rarely have contact with outsiders other than the children attending school. They appear completely human, but they eat food that seems completely inedible by any normal human being and they each have their own peculiar qualities that seem beyond those of normal humans such as Uncle Fester's ability to generate electricity. If they do have visitors, they are usually other family members from some remote area who display these same characteristics. The show never explains the origin of the Addams' or their great wealth - that's just part of their intrigue. The standout episodes in this volume are ""Thing is Missing"", which appears to be a spoof of The Maltese Falcon; ""Lurch The Teenage Idol"" which pokes fun of the early Beatles and similar rock bands; ""Cousin Itt's Problem"" in which Itt is losing his hair; and ""Halloween - Addams Style"" which shows us how the Addams' celebrate this holiday and all the misunderstandings that come along when trick-or-treaters show up at their house.",1173571200,21,1995,4.557103064066852
2706634,5,B000LC4ZIA,"Picking up where Volume One left off, The Addams Family - Volume Two ends the show's first season with the remaining 12 Season One episodes, and starts the second season with the first 9 Season Two episodes.

It opens up with Thing Is Missing so they put an ad in the paper.  People end up sending all kinds of things but not their Thing.  And Lurch And The Harpsichord where he becomes a teen idol singing star.  And on from there.  After reviewing Volume One yesterday I did some research about this.

Love the absurdities,and all the great props in their mansion. The Munsters are a cartoon family compared to the Addams Family.

2706752,5,B000LC4ZIA,"The Addams Family was a black and white comedy series in the 1960's.  It starred John Astin and Carolyn Jones in the lead.
The show was a series of 'days in the life' of the eccentric Addams Family, with a rich patriarch(John Astin), a sultry mother(Carolyn Jones), a strange uncle(Uncle Fester, who could light a bulb in his mouth), Lurch(the giant butler), cousin ITT, Thing, the two over-indulged kids, and a series of visitors who play it 'straight' to highlight the strange 'doings' in the gothic home.
If you never saw it, you're in for a strange treat.  If you have seen it, here it is once again, as you remember. Suffice it to say, when on-going characters in a show include a 'hand in a box' as well as a Venus flytrap plant some six feet tall, you have the makings of some strange 'doings'...

2706830,4,B000LC4ZIA,"The Addams Family ran for two seasons on ABC, from 1964 through 1966.  Perhaps to generate greater sales, MGM Studios (now in bankruptcy) decided to break the two seasons (64 total episodes), into three ""volumes"".  Volume 2 contains the last 12 episodes of the first season, and the first 9 episodes in the second.  Splitting the two seasons into three volumes was not the best way to package the program, and fans should consider The Addams Family: The Complete Series, which costs less than the three individual volumes.

The cartoons of Charles Adams which appeared in The New Yorker, were used as the basis for The Addams Family television series.  Working with  Charles Addams, executive producer David Levy and the show's creative staff, gave names to the previously unnamed cartoon characters, put them together as a family, and came up with a concept for the program.  The idea was for the unconventional and macabre Addams clan to shock whenever possible, without going too far.

John Astin stars as wealthy Gomez Addams, a lawyer and dabbler in the stock market.  Carolyn Jones is his cultured wife Morticia, whose hobbies include raising carnivorous plants.  Jackie Coogan is Uncle Fester, a strange fellow who can power a light bulb by sticking it in his mouth.  Blossom Rock is Grandmama, a harmless witch.  Ted Cassidy is Lurch, the butler, who entertains the family by playing the harpsichord.  The Addams' children are played by Ken Weatherwax as the adventurous Pugsley, and Lisa Loring as the gloomy Wednesday.  Thing, the disembodied hand in a box, is an adaptation of a most unique Charles Addams' creation.  Only hairy Cousin Itt, was not created by Addams.

While the Addams' are a bit kooky and weird, except for Lurch, they really don't look that frightening, or do anything that is scary or evil.  While Lurch does look the part, he's too slow moving and easy going to be a threat.  Uncle Fester has a malicious streak, and sometimes totes a gun, but rarely actually gets violent. Producer Nat Perrin wrote for the Marx Brothers, and there's a lot of Groucho Marx in Gomez Addams' personality and mannerisms.  Some of the highlights in Volume 2 include:

Lurch And His Harpsicord:  Gomez and Morticia plan to donate their prized Krupnik harpsichord to a museum, breaking Lurch's heart, and causing him to quit his job.

Uncle Fester's Toupee:  There's a crisis when Fester's lady pen pal (Elizabeth Fraser) is coming for a visit, expecting Fester to have a full head of hair on his head.

Lurch, The Teenage Idol: Lurch is a guy loaded with hidden talents.  Who knew that he could sing, or at least hum?  It's a surprise to the family when Lurch's grunts and groans, bring adoring fans to the Addams' residence.

Morticia's Romance:  On the occasion of their 13th wedding anniversary, Wednesday and Pugsley discover how their parents met and married, in this very informative two parter, that features Carolyn Jones in a dual role as Ophelia, Morticia's older sister.  Back when Gomez was a bachelor, sisters Ophelia and Morticia Frump arrived with their mother at the Addams' mansion.  The plan was for Gomez to marry Ophelia, but Morticia has won his heart.  Uncle Fester arrives and helps the course of true love, as Gomez and Morticia are wed.

Morticia Meets Royalty:  Love blooms, when Gomez's aunt, Princess Millicent von Schlepp (Elvia Allman) arrives for a visit with her handmaiden Lady Fingers, a female version of Thing.  The Princess is demanding, and isn't amused by the comedic antics of ""Fester the jester"", but the family sacrifices to bring the lovers together.

Not all of the stories in Volume 2 are strong, but the writing is on the right track more often than not.  Fester and Cousin Itt are featured more prominently, and there is less reliance on the same gimmicks and gags employed at the beginning of the series.  The Addams Family remains a zany program that is getting funnier.",1302739200,,3930,4.882175226586103

But, almost more importantly, I would definitely not have bought it had I known that the show comes on double-sided disks.  I have never had good experiences with those, and I am deeply disappointed.",1285372800,4,553,4.188679245283019

2706863,4,B000LC4ZIA,"I wanted to finish watching this DVD set before writing this review. It is broken into two parts. First is the review of the set itself. Second concerns a ""glitch"" I found in the set which EVERYONE should be made aware of(don't know why anyone hasn't seen this themselves!?)and I have brought it to the attention of its' makers...but more of that later.
First of all the actual review.
Well I can only say this is more of the same as Vol#1.
It it a typical American family...ghoul style?,a parody/satire of the American family?....just plain family fun and frivolity?.....well,you would be right on ALL counts!!
The fun continues as the Addams's continue to amaze but mostly baffle their ""normal"" counterparts/neighbours. The humour is dry but it is rapid fire helped along by a stellar cast led by John Astin(Gomez) and Carolyn Jones(Morticia).Ted Cassidy(Lurch) and the inimitable Jackie Coogan(Uncle Fester)are also unforgettable.
The entire cast(as it should) plays it straight,right down the middle. THEY are normal...not us. But this is no typical family as one might think. What ""typical"" family has a butler? Only a richer one. So while there are ""typical"" family values seen here-at least in so far as the family unit are concerned-this is,to me,a send up of a rich family/old money. For Gomez especially talks alot of his family history and each ancestor though ""famous"" is really more infamous. A typical old rich family will have in its' family tree usually some famous individual who excelled brilliantly in their particular endeavour. The Addams' predecessors usually were famous but only for their notoriety and ultimate demise...by shooting,by hanging,etc,etc.
However anyway you look at it The Addams Family series was a short lived but brilliant piece of work with a stellar cast. It may have lasted a short two seasons but it has certainly retained its' charm and appeal to this day. A worthy purchase for anyone and/or family....Addams or otherwise!
Now to the second part of this review.
I have to say to start I have viewed a Canadian copy only of this set so I would ask that Amercian readers please check/review their copies to see if the same problem occurs in their sets.(If it does...see below).
There is a major glitch in this DVD set which occurs on side two of disc#1 in the episode ""My Son,the Chimp"".It occurs at approximately the 24 minute mark of the show(almost at the end).At this point in the ep Wednesday is escorting an invisible friend through the living room to show him out the front door. During their passage through the living room the invisible friend bumps the leg of Gomez in a chair. He reacts. From this point is where the glitch occurs. There is a close up reaction shot of Morticia,then a medium long shot of Wednesday saying goodbye to her friend at the door. During these two cut shots the picture shrinks slightly,then returns to normal afterward.
I do not know at this point whether it is a film issue or a transfer issue. However,I HAVE contacted Sony Pictures(who now own MGM) on this matter. Today(April 27/07) I talked to one ""Adam""(how's that for a coincidence?),a Sony Pictures telephone rep in Los Angeles. He was very pleasant as I explained the situation and I am told it will be passed on to the proper people to get looked at. I also gave him my home phone and he said someone would let me know sometime(hopefully sooner than later) what they have found. If and when that information passes into my hands I will certainly repost a review to all the readers here and let them know what is happening.
However,knowing the ""big guys"" like we all do they have a predilection for letting things like this go,hoping once it's reported we will forget about it. Well,let us NOT let SONY forget about THIS.Here is their toll free number in the U.S. and Canada...1-877-766-9496.
As I told Sony rep Adam,if it's a film problem there is really not much we can do but if it's something else it CAN be rectified and(in the VERY LEAST) another product ""run"" made so at least all that do contact Sony about this problem can at least expect to get new and ""clean"" replacement discs. After all we know they spend good money making DVDs but we the consumer spend BIG bucks to buy them and like any product it should be defect free.
Stay tuned and...don't touch that dial!!",1177632000,6,4319,4.767690253671562
