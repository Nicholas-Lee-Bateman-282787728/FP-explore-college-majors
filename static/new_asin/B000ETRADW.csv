8114176,5,B000ETRADW,I have several of these dvds. They are very informative and nice and short so you don't get too bored. They provide great information about some of the worlds greatest writers. I highly recommend them.,1445558400,,201,4.771428571428571
8114177,3,B000ETRADW,"I have two core novels that I use every year in my high school sophomore English class.  One is ""Adventures of Huckleberry Finn""; the other is ""Animal Farm."" With both of these authors, I feel it is necessary to have an understanding of the author and his times to fully appreciate these two novels. For Mark Twain, I use the excellent A&E Biography title. If A&E ever did George Orwell, it is not available. The only alternative I have found is this British-produced ""Famous Authors"" title.

It covers the essentials, but it is not up to the standards set by the A&E Biography series. There are plenty of still photos that are used, but very little period film footage--and none that features Orwell himself. And while Orwell worked for the BBC, no audio clips of the author are used either.

Another concern is the monotone delivery of the British voice-over narrator and the dirge-like music that plays in the background throughout. This may sound like a petty detail, but keep in mind that I'm trying to maintain the attention of a roomful of 15- and 16-year-olds!

As for the content itself, it provides the basics. You get a general overview of Orwell's life:  his childhood, his school years, his stint in the Burmese police force, his commitment to socialism, his career as an author and a look at his role as husband and father. There is limited discussion of his major works (""Animal Farm"" and ""1984""), but no mention of any of his major essays like ""Shooting an Elephant."" It would have been nice to have been more thorough here, but not critical. (After all, the A&E Twain video does not go into detailed discussion of HIS works, either.)

Overall, this is an adequate introduction to Orwell, and in the absence of an alternative this is your best option available.  RECOMMENDED",1330214400,3,1790,4.736334405144695
8114178,3,B000ETRADW,"Most documentaries are an hour long, but sometimes that's too long.  I like learning the basic skeleton of Orwell's life.  The thirty minutes here did it all for me.  The brevity would make it easier to show this during one high school class period.

I hate cheesy reenactments, which History Channel does often.  This has no such reenactments.  However, seeing one black-and-white photo after the other seemed slow too.  They show moving footage of modern times, but little of Orwell's times which had moving recordings.

Orwell worked as a police officer in Burma (now Myanmar).  I knew of British imperialism in India and Africa, but not Southeast Asia.  The work describes Orwell as incredibly solitary, but it sounds like he was a successful husband, father, and employee.  Even though married, he went to fight fascism in Spain.  This fact makes me rethink the details behind Nicole Kidman's ""The Others"" as being realistic.

The narrator says Orwell and his first wife couldn't have biological children.  I wonder who was fertile.  Much discussion is written and filmed about the infertility of Marilyn Monroe, Frida Kahlo, and Josephine Baker.  I would love to know how famous men deal with that issue.  It's implied that Orwell and his first wife died of cancer.  Perhaps his fans may learn an anti-smoking lesson from their struggle.

This work says little about ""1984"" and ""Animal Farm"" besides describing under what conditions a publisher was willing to produce them.  I think the work supposes you read both texts and want to know more only about the author.  So students think this can be their Cliffnotes should beware.",1171238400,3,1634,5.0
