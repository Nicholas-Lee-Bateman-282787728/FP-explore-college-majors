7346696,4,B012C884F0,"Kotarou Satomi wanted to live on his own once he started high school, and found Room 106, a one bedroom apartment for rent at an amazingly low 5000 yen (about $40) a month.

He then quickly finds out that several girls are also interested in this room, and attempt to get him out of there. However, he refuses to, as he doesn't have a lot of money being a poor high school student. After the landlady sees them all fighting and wrecking the room, she beats them all up, and orders them to find a peaceful way to resolve their dilemma.

I liked the twist in the otherwise typical harem show, with several girls interested in the main guy, as they all have supernatural or sci-fi connections, such as the ghost girl who lived in the room before Kotarou moved in, or the girl from an alien world who can create a portal into the room from her spaceship orbiting above Earth.

The relationships they have with each other is antagonistic at first, as they all have their reasons for wanting Room 106. However, as the show progresses, they start bonding with each other, and instead of fighting among themselves, they help each other out against external threats that also want Room 106 for themselves.

The show is broken up into three introductory episodes, and then each of the main girls gets two episodes that focuses heavily on them. There is another girl at Kotarou's school who is in the same club as him, and the show hints that there is much more to her than she's aware of. And she's also the one he seems most interested in, which of course doesn't go over well with the other girls. So if you've seen other harem shows, you can probably imagine what happens to him during those moments.

While it's not really groundbreaking in any way, it's still fun to watch this every now and then.",1446768000,10,1792,4.484662576687117

8725932,4,B012C884F0,"Unexpected. It has a boy that isn't useless. He's surrounded by women that aren't all in love with him. I kept waiting for it to collapse into that usual formula,  but it doggedly resists. In fact, while there's a beach episode, I can only think about a few fanservice moments during the entire series. It's more focused on friendship and the interaction of the wide range of female characters, including a futuristic space princess, a ghost, a magical girl, a shrine maiden from the bowels of the earth, etc. They're all bound together by the mysterious power of the guy's room, and various background developments hint at more connections. I like it. It's such a break from the norm, so a bit weird. Worth watching again just to relax into it. The only real issue I have with it is that the conflicts really lack bite. Still, it's nice to find a relaxing anime. The ending is rather abrupt, and I get the feeling that there's more. Hope so, because there's certainly plenty more to explore. Good animation and Japanese voice acting; no dub, though I wish there was an option to kill the subtitles.",1490054400,,1099,4.635897435897436
8725933,4,B012C884F0,"This is a twelve episode long show on two discs. There is no available English dubbing for this product. The features on the DVD are somewhat lacking as it goes straight to episodes listing for a main menu. The feature options give you a clean opening title to the series and no options regarding the subtitling, which became somewhat of a problem. I had somehow turned off the subtitling on my device and was unable to restore it. I had to switch to another DVD playing device in order to restore the subtitles. Hence it would be helpful if subtitle control feature was at least on the special features selection for the DVD.
This is a general summary of what you're in for without much of spoilers.
The apartment room 106 is a coveted location to a wide range of characters from a magical girl, to an alien girl, a subterranean girl, a ghost who is also a girl, and Kotaro Satomi aka a 'regular' guy who actually pays rent to the place. Each one wanting the cramped apartment room for their own agenda and after a full out battle that nearly destroys it the apartment manger forces them to find a nonviolent method of determining who the actual tenant should be. The room is divided up amongst each faction and in an agreement of competition to a series of games/activities the victor gains more influence over the room at the expense of the losers. This becomes more irrelevant as the series progresses with the characters simply spending time together in a comical way.
It's a goofy anime but an enjoyable one. A conflict arises between the oddball group and a secret organization that is after the apartment which is left unresolved and unexplored by the end. This conflict also ties in to a love interest Kotaro has for his afterschool club leader that is left with a number of unanswered questions. However, you can somewhat write both of these lingering issues off as the final episode is a decent closing to the anime which likely will not see any further additions to it. If the studio decides to make more they left themselves an open door for further expanding on the story. In the end all I can say is poor adorable magical girl. She got the short end of the stick the entire time.",1480896000,,2194,4.542929292929293
8725934,5,B012C884F0,"This show was so much fun, and wildly different characters, and a great story line that holds it all together. Unless you're into specific types of anime, I'd recommend this to anyone!",1458950400,,184,4.78125
8725935,4,B012C884F0,"I found this short series rather refreshing, and not a typical ""harem"" anime at all. For one thing, it contains no
nudity, and only a few panty shots (normally the meat and potatoes of harem shows), and only one of the girls
is what you'd term over-endowed. That's refreshing in and of itself. For another, it plays more like a romantic
comedy in many ways, without the girls fighting over the oblivious hero in every episode.

Such a collection of quirky characters as this has quite possibly never been seen before. Each is flawed in
some way, but these add to the charm. Watching them clash, then try to find ways of getting along, keeps
things lively, even though the series as a whole never really goes anywhere. Just introducing all these
oddballs, getting to know them a little, takes all the time they have.

Here's hoping for a second season.",1457395200,,851,4.629139072847682

8725939,4,B012C884F0,"I saw it on Youtube. I enjoyed the story and the artwork was not bad. The story was 1 guy and 6 girls. 4 of the girl want his room for different reason.
The story could be little better but good enough. It's bite off center as the anime goes.",1452902400,,242,3.86
