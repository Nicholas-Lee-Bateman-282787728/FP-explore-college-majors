8018302,5,B0001YF4OC,The DVD was great.  If you love the old DooWop then you need to check this out!  The singers may look older but the great thing is that they sound just like the 45's.,1419120000,2,166,3.8529411764705883

8018305,5,B0001YF4OC,"If you enjoyed being a teenager in the 50s and early 60s this is the kind of DVD you'll tap your feet and sing along to.  It takes you back to the good old days when doo wop harmonies captivated teens from car radios to hand held transistors!  Literally, a slice of Americana still lingering in the hearts and minds of baby boomers to this day.  PBS was never better!",1389225600,3,367,4.214285714285714
