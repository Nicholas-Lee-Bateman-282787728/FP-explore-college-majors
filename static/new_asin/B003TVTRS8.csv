8405471,1,B003TVTRS8,This doesn't even come close to being called a decent film; the plot sucks and the fights are very sloppy. Definitely NOT worth buying this in blu-ray either because you will not be able to tell the difference between the resolutions,1319760000,3,233,4.7073170731707314
8405472,4,B003TVTRS8,"Seller was prompt.  Material arrived when predicted.  Material was in excellent shape as advertised.  Material was as adveristed, good olde kung-fu movies.  I am not an expert, except in what I like.  I just enjoy kung-fu movies as a great mental break from humdrum.  I don't think the blu-ray is worth the extra cost.  Movie bogged down in middle.  However, this is fun movie.",1314489600,5,377,4.78125
