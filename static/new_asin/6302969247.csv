7833002,3,6302969247,"Jacques Tati is the ringleader and showman in one of his last films, PARADE.  The film does have the same format as Tati's past films, but rather appears to be an 85-minute French TV variety show of circus acts that Tati presents to an audience, such as symphony performers who do acrobatic feats as well as flamenco dancers, and many more.  The film may have ran a little too long.

The beginning and parts of the film appear ambiguous.  For example, there is a scene where a woman at the hat check keeps a closet full of helmets, and the continuous shots of a little boy in the audience.  Despite the dated look of the film and fragment of scenes, Tati does not disappoint his audience.  He provides his own small comedic and pantomime vignettes, such as fly fishing and his attempt to sing with an orchestra, which is show in intermissions between the other entertainers' performances.

PARADE will delight viewers who enjoy watching the craftsmanship of a legendary comedian.  Indeed, Tati provides timeless humor and comedy, but this may be recommended for the diehard and curious fan of Jacques Tati.",1152835200,5,1106,4.7539267015706805
