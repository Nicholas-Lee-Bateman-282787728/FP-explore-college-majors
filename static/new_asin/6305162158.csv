7885107,3,6305162158,"This video offers some of his best material so far! In particular a short version of ""Eric the Pilot"". [Buy a longer version on CD as well as ""Think Tank"" for his best spoken word work on CD to date] Having seen Rollins live 3 times I have 2 complaints with this video. a] His performance is restrained and watered down compared to the real thing. and b] Video, while showing his body language which is so much a part of his live shows, cannot capture his powerful stage presence. Still this video stands on its own as entertaining and worthwhile. If you had to buy one recording of his spoken word this would be it. But catch him live if you can!",984268800,5,647,4.2682926829268295
7885108,5,6305162158,"This tape is an excellent piece to compliment the ""Think Tank"" album.  Rollins addresses some of the same topics on the video that he mentioned on the CD, but there are some different takes and some new things  to be told.  What really makes this tape are the breaks in between spoken  bits -- I'm not gonna give it away, you'll just have to check it out.
The  best piece on the video is ""Eric The Pilot"", possibly the best  yet of Henry's many whacked-out travel stories.  This one is made better by  the fact that you can see his facial expressions, something the CDs can't  fully convey.
With all of this we get Henry's take on Racism, Homophobia  and other forms of human ignorance.  Many people could use a good session  of sitting down with this tape and learning that ignorance hurts everyone,  even oneself.",952905600,11,815,4.5
7885109,4,6305162158,"This is cool to listen too, Rollins is really cool, but his topic matter seems fairly tame, and a bit too restrained.  If you want to get a picture of who he is, try Talking from the Box first and then take a look at this  after.",947116800,3,229,3.851063829787234

This particular show is very ""PC"" oriented (20-30 minutes on the soapbox of anti-racisim/anti-gay topics). If you can't stand it when he gets on one of those rants, stay away from this one.
It also  has the short version of the ""Eric the Pilot"" story. If you  haven't heard this one, go to 21361.com and order the cd. The CD version of  the story is significantly better. I'd rate it as one of his best CD's.",942105600,7,421,4.30379746835443
