3435146,1,B0019ESNFU,"This edition has a mixing error. At the end of Mulan (the first one), when she says, ""Would you like to stay for dinner?"" And the grandma is supposed to say, ""Would you like to stay forever?"" The grandmother's line is completely missing, though the other characters still visually react to it. It is totally weird. The visual quality is great, but it really bothers me that this line is missing; the scene doesn't make sense. (If someone else has this DVD, let me know- maybe the glitch is only on my copy? Otherwise it's a great dvd package.)",1515888000,,543,4.494949494949495

3435275,4,B0019ESNFU,"I love this movie. Mulan, who is a bit of an un-ordinary girl, is the one in her family to go as a soldier to the war against the Huns, disguising as a man. The producers nailed the humor when she's trying to be ""manly,"" like when she tries to spit like a man or talks in a deep voice. This is the sort of girl I love--the one who takes action and saves herself. The songs are amazing, too, like Lea Salogna's ""Reflection"" or ""I'll Make a Man out of You"" sung by Donny Osmond. Just to let you know, though, Mulan 2 is a flop. Mulan goes from being a soldier in the first movie to helping three women find husbands in the second movie.",1487376000,,634,4.0

3435289,5,B0019ESNFU,"With a beautiful art style and the plot of a girl with the desperation and moxie to enter the army, this is a beautifully rendered movie that you'll want to visit time and again. It's hard to overpraise the detail in the artwork, the emotional (and logical) rollercoaster you are taken on, and the conflicts that happen not just between characters, but between character and culture. One of the high points of Disney's 90s Renaissance!

II doesn't exist.",1486598400,3,454,4.82051282051282

Everything seems to work fine but I've only ever used my xbox one so I can say if it would work in just a regular blue ray player. My only complaint is the complete garbage movie that is mulan 2 but unfortunately you can't find just mulan by itself.

Following your feelings will never lead you the wrong way! especially if it means convincing your parents, society, forest animals etc. that you MUST marry THIS boyfriend. Didn't finish the movie.

The one down side to this release is it is missing a lot of the special features from the 2004 release.  But other than that the quality is worth sacrifice in my opinion.  The music in the original Mulan is great and some of the best Disney has to offer.  This movie is great for kids, teens, and adults.

3435606,5,B0019ESNFU,"BEST MOVIES EVER!!!!!! I always loved Mulan, for her courage, love and honor. By fallowing your heart and standing up for what you believe in, especially in a time when women jobs ar e supposed to only be a wife as well as a mother.

Mulan has proven in the first movie that just because society says one thing doesn't nessicarily means we have to follow. She descises herself as a man and goes off to fight in the army, which was fobbiden in his time. She defeated Shan Yu, and saved he country. The end of the movie, to me seemed like I was hinting a sequel, but it could have been just me.

The sequel, is a month after Mulan returns home, in the beginning we see Mulan doing her chores when a group of young girls (they look to be 10-14 years old) who want to be like her. The first song is ""LESSON NUMBER ONE"", which is like ""I'll make a man out of you"" in a sense that, it teaches about how to be a worrier, but Lesson number one is more about combining how to be strong and forcefull, yet gentle a sweet. This one is more about love And relationships in the face of war.",1452556800,,1077,4.0754716981132075

I love that this movie allows a woman to step outside of her gender role and do a great thing for herself, her family, and society. It communicates to girls: ""Marriage doesn't have to be your primary goal in life. You can be strong 'like a man' if you want. You can do things you enjoy, just like boys do."" It is rare to find Disney movies like this, especially at the time of its release. I highly recommend this movie to parents of girls and boys! Boys should know girls are just as capable as they are. I was pleasantly surprised to find that this DVD came with Mulan 2 as well. I like that movie too, but nothing can compare to the first one!

3436016,5,B0019ESNFU,"adding to my disney movie collection this was a must have, cheaper to buy both even tho i was only interested in the original",1396224000,,125,4.25
3436017,5,B0019ESNFU,"Mulan: Disney's best movie since Aladdin and Eddie Murphy's Mushu is just as funny. Mulan manages to combine ancient tradition and 90's humour into a wonderful tale that will appeal to all age groups and surprisingly resolves a long standing gender issue. Highly recommended...too good to miss!

Mulan 2: Mulan 2 picks up a month after Mulan and Shang return. Mulan is widely known and loved as a hero, and is admired particularly by the local girls, who rightly see her as a role model. Mushu, meanwhile, is taking full advantage of his status as a hero, much to the disgust of Mulan's Ancestors, who must attend to his every whim. This is all about to change. The 'gang of three' are back to assist Mulan and Shang on a mission. They're all sent by the Emperor to escort his three daughters to marry princes of another kingdom, in order to form an alliance with that kingdom necessary to save China from an invasion. Things don't quite work out as they are supposed to; Mushu plays the heavy, attempting to break up Mulan and Shang to save his 'lifestyle'.

Overall, Mulan II is a fun ride, with a good story, great animation and a really nice score. The kids and adults will enjoy watching this movie.",1395446400,8,1204,4.569444444444445

3436019,5,B0019ESNFU,I think kids and adults alike will appreciate the story.  Never give up.  Keep trying.  Don't let old fashion ideas like if you are male or female that you can't achieve your goals.  I really liked the music in this DVD with Donny Osmond and Christine Aguilera.

3436052,4,B0019ESNFU,"Disney Studios 36th full length animated feature film Mulan is another one of the studios animated films that gets overlooked of over shadowed because it followed a string of super hits in the 90's.(OK the first was in 1989).

I actually think this is an excellent entry in the Disney cannon full of gorgeous animation and inspired songs that fit the the exotic local. I realize there are many that think Disney produces the same basic story substituting new locations and characters, but if that is the case then so does Hollywood live actions films and Disney seems to be doing this better than anybody, at least by percentage...really how many horrible theatrically released animated films has Disney had?....answer? NONE!

The New Blu Ray transfer is Gorgeous and I can't imagine it ever being improved upon. Really, it is flawless! Most of the bonus stuff was carried over, but we did lose all stills and galleries which is really a shame, I would have rather have had them, instead of the sequel.

This is the best release for the movie Mulan, the Blu Ray looks and sounds superb, but you may want to hang on to your DVD for the bonus material.",1393372800,,1150,4.683168316831683

3436059,4,B0019ESNFU,"As is typical of most sequels, Mulan II is not nearly as good of a movie as the original. That being said, it's one of the few sequels we have actually seen of the Disney princess line so it was nice that it was included in this set.

Mulan is one of the more under appreciated Disney princesses. She may not be as memorable as Cinderella, Ariel, Belle, or Rapunzel, but her story is one of bravery and courage. She dresses as a man to enlist in the army to save her father from having to go into battle. She isn't technically a princess by birth or marriage but she is officially a Disney princess due to her strength and bravery as a warrior.

Overall, I would rate Mulan a 4 because her story is interesting and should be appreciated. Unlike many Disney princess films though, this one does not have a great soundtrack or too many memorable songs and some of the more minor characters are a bit obnoxious. Overall, I would recommend it though.",1389225600,,946,4.369318181818182

3436085,5,B0019ESNFU,"We love Mulan and getting Mulan II and a blue ray disc were awesome bonuses! In Mulan I, I like how Mulan sacrifices her own needs to help save her father. She is very courageous to dress up as a male soldier and go off to war in place of her ill father. She ends up saving china in the process, and falls in love. Her spiritual guardian dragon Mushu is my daughter's favorite character. He is hilarious! The bad character Hans is pretty scary just to warn anyone whose child scares easily. In Mulan II, she again follows her heart and gets engaged, and is again on another important mission to keep peace in china, by escorting three princesses to marry princes of a neighboring rivalry kingdom to establish peace between the two kingdoms. It ends with everyone happy and in love with who they want to be with, but it is a hard journey to get there and a very interesting story. I would have liked a bigger wedding of Mulan and Shang at the end, but it is very sacrificial and sweet at the same time:) It teaches of unselfishness and love. I would consider the war aspects of this if your child gets scared easily. Otherwise my daughter loves the singing especially in the second movie and loves the dragon Mushu and lucky cricket.",1388275200,2,1232,4.407894736842105

3436104,5,B0019ESNFU,"Mulan is a rare movie, combining the best of old and new styles to create a masterpiece. Based on an ancient Chinese story, Mulan tells of a girl who rose to inspire her people against an invading foe, a story pre-dating that of Joan of Arc by many centuries. In Disney's telling, the character animation, the music, and Eddie Murphy's voicing of Mushu the Dragon are ""new"" style elements; while animation of buildings and landscapes are ""old"" style, and very beautiful. Most importantly, the story development is also in the old style, with finely crafted characters you care about. This results in a film which is emotionally affecting for adults as well as children, though on differing levels.

Mulan expertly mixes cartoon slapstick, clever dialogue, magnificent sights and sounds, and eye-misting emotion, creating a powerful experience the memory of which is likely to last for a very long time. The films from Disney Studios have been hit-and-miss since the passing of Walt Disney, and Mulan is one of the hits. Perhaps the strangest example of the bull's eye scored by this film is Eddie Murphy as Mushu, with an accent that is seemingly so out of place, and yet so perfect.

The Blu-ray edition heightens the effect of the thunderous soundtrack and the beautiful animation, offering a grand evening's entertainment for the entire family. Re-visit this classic from 1998 to see how good later Disney films could be.

I (or, rather, my mom) bought the sequel when it came out originally and it is just terrible. It completely makes Shang and Mulan, who were superbly badass in the original, look like absolute idiots. It's seriously awful and such a disappointment. The only reason this gets four stars from me is because the amazing, epic, original movie is the main focus and my love for Mulan will never fade.

The story is about and unconventional girl and has nice moral value because her unconventionality saves the day.  Mulan II is ok.  A bit more silly however still entertaining.  It's a continuation of Mulan and her journey of self discovery.  Not as cleverly written as the first but for a sequel it's not too bad.,1368921600,,437,4.76

Mulan is significant in that it was the first feature produced almost completely by Walt Disney Animation Florida, a top-flight studio that doubled as a Theme Park attraction. Guests could wander along picture windows and watch animators at work on real shorts and features. It was a wonderful thing to see while it lasted.

Mulan was also my daughter's first movie. Even though she was just a baby then, she has seen it many times since and it is one of her all-time favorites. This is a great dad and daughter movie, in any case.

The strength of Mulan is that its a story that makes a strong statement without beating it over your head. The sense and reason of equal treatment arises through character, situation and example. Within the context of a patriarchal society, the film is able to make its case without compromising its time or place. There is no question about what Mulan must do, yet she is not trying to ""prove"" anything,doing what she has to do for her fathers and her family's honor.

Mulan herself is one of the most engaging Disney heroines of all time. She only doubts herself once, but most of the time she just figures out what to do because it has to be done and it's right. Mulan emerges as the strongest and smartest of her fellow recruits. Rarely is such compassionate, unselfish motivation seen in film or TV.

Not one song stops the action. Mulan is not a musical, but it has extended musical sequences that are carefully planned. Donny Osmond and Lea Salonga sing their roles beautifully (this being Donny's first Disney project since he and his brothers appeared on the Disney TV show to promote The Haunted Mansion at Disneyland in 1969. (It was very groovy.)

Marni Nixon, famed Hollywood &iquest;,""ghost singer"" who dubbed Marilyn Monroe, Deborah Kerr, Natalie Wood and even Margaret O'Brien, sings for Grandmother Fa, whose voice is none other than our Lovely Lady June Foray.

  Disney Blu-ray & DVD (March 12, 2013)
  Directed by Darrell Rooney and Lynne Southerland
  The Voices of Ming Na Wen, B. D. Wong, Mark Moseley, George Takei, June Foray, Harvey Fierstein,
  Jerry Tondo, Gedde Watanabe, Lucy Liu, Sandra Oh
  Music Score by Joel McNeely

Making a sequel for Mulan seems, unlike those of other Disney features, a natural. You might not be able to duplicate the epic battle scenes, but you could make more of the characters and their relationships. Sadly, Mulan II falls far from what it might have been.

A better title could have been How I Met Your Mulan. Countless rom-com clichs abound. Sure, it's a contemporary take on an ancient legend, but do Mulan and Shang really have to do that ""men never ask directions"" routine? Sure to be dated phrases are spoken, like ""Why the face? and ""He's gross.""

Most of the songs cover the same ground as in the first film. One might especially take exception with the song that appears to be intended as the breakout, ""I Want to Be Like Other Girls."" Yes, the song is about sheltered young ladies wanting to break free, but in this day and age, does every parent want their daughter to follow the crowd as these lyrics also imply?

A lot of work goes into films like these, and I regret deeply to sound so negative. There is a lot of talent evident in Mulan II, particularly the dazzling color palette. It's just that there must have been some behind the scenes disagreement about what the film was supposed to be. This is largely a comedy with most of the characters reduced to types.

In this film, Mulan makes an anachronistic speech about being shocked at arranged marriages, even though in the original film, she was fully aware of the cultural norms of her time. She went to the matchmaker fully prepared to face this situation.

This film goes on to depict a pat Brady Brides pairing of the three recruit characters from the earlier film with three princesses, perhaps suggesting that marriage is the only way for a person to be happy, as long as you can choose your partner (and get to know them for a couple of hours). Even when the princesses had discovered their independence, they reverted to another social convention and so did Mulan. Trying to have it both ways, modern and traditional, the story just gets lost in itself.

It's nice, though, to hear June Foray again, though we get to see precious little of the Fa family in the sequel.

Where I am disappointed with this set:  1. Disney now has gone cheap on blu ray issues.  You get NO artwork on the discs, just plain Jane discs.  2.  Disappointing extras.  No ""making of"" for the original film.  I would have liked to have seen this.

So, to sum up.  Still a fan of the original film, sequel NOT necessary.  No good extras & cheap blu ray set.",1363737600,2,589,4.324074074074074
3436288,5,B0019ESNFU,"The original classic movie of Mulan is a great addition to any Disney fan's collection. I think they were smart to add the sequel to this package because it is cute but would never buy it on it's own. There are many special features and other fun stuff. My favorite is Jackie Chan singing ""I'll make a man out of you"".",1363651200,2,318,4.229508196721311
3436289,4,B0019ESNFU,"Disney continues their efforts to release every movie in high definition with a 3-Disc Special Edition of ""Mulan"" and ""Mulan II."" ""Mulan"" comes to us in a 15th Anniversary Edition which features Disney's Enhanced High Definition Picture and Sound. Interest in Mulan has been sparked once again by her appearance in the hit television show ""Once Upon a Time."" This two movie collection will fill in the origins of the character for those who don't already know it.

In the first movie, a young Chinese maiden named Mulan disguises herself to take the place of her physically weak father. He's been called on to serve in the Army and fight the invading Huns. Her ancestors order a disgraced dragon named Mushu to join Mulan and stop her from executing her plan. He soon discovers she isn't easily discouraged and decides to assist the determined girl in her endeavors.

Although she isn't considered royalty by birth or marriage, Mulan has been inducted into the ranks of Disney Princesses. She most certainly earned it through the movie's box office success. It won several awards and was nominated for others, including an Oscar for Original Music Score.

The animation for the film is beautiful and captivating. It's at one time bright and cheerful while at others dark and bleak. I also enjoy how it resembles classic Disney films while holding its own unique Chinese flavor.

""Mulan II"" has recently engaged General Li Shang and our heroine heading off on a secret mission to lead three princesses to Chang'an, China. That's not the only obstacle to their ""happily ever after"" they have to overcome. Mushu the Dragon is not pleased. If she marries Shang he will lose his guardian job. He must find a way to stop the wedding. Meanwhile, Mulan has her hands full helping the princesses escape their fate of marrying the Gang of Three who they don't love. A Mongolian attack and an unhappy Emperor further complicate things for Mulan and Shang.

Just like all of Disney's straight-to-video releases, ""Mulan II"" suffers from a lower budget and quicker production turn-around. For the most part, the animation captures the characters and their visual appearances rather well. However, the coloring is duller than the original and the animation isn't as smooth. It's obvious this was added to the release as a sort of bonus feature.

The audio and video transfer for the original ""Mulan"" is spectacular. The picture is clean and the colors make everything jump out at you off the screen. The 5.1 surround sound mix will submerge the home theater audience into the world of ancient China complete with galloping horses, audible dialogue, and a lush musical score.

Consumers will be happy with the special features contained in this 3-Disc collection. Bonus material for ""Mulan"" includes audio commentary by Producer Pam Coats and directors Tony Bancroft and Barry Cook. There are also 11 deleted scenes, Classic Backstage Disney featurettes, music videos, and other Classic Music & More material. Bonus content for ""Mulan II"" includes a featurette entitled ""Voices of 'Mulan',"" deleted scenes and a music video for ""I Wanna Be Like Other Girls"" by Atomic Kitten.

This two movie collection cast the spotlight back on a Disney Princess that gets overlooked by many. It not only serves as an entertaining animated movie for people to enjoy, but a lesson on the history and culture of China. It's an opportunity to get educated and have fun at the same time.",1363651200,3,3452,4.960207612456747
3436290,5,B0019ESNFU,One of my favorite Disney movies. I'm so excited to share it with my daughter. I haven't watched Mulan II but nice to have with the original.,1363478400,,141,4.2592592592592595

3436292,4,B0019ESNFU,"While Mulan looks better on Blu-ray, we are sacrificing some bonus material that was on the old DVD:

Sorry to say, the MANDARIN soundtrack has been dropped from both the Blu-ray and DVD of this release.  You will need to keep your 2004 2-Disc Special Edition DVD if you want to hear the Mandarin language.

Also gone from the 4002 Special Edition DVD are all galleries are lost in the leap from DVD to Blu-ray. There were ten Character Design galleries holding several hundred images, three Visual Development galleries amassing around 100 images, a 13-image Backgrounds & Layouts gallery, and a Publicity Art gallery holding 32 images. The interactive edutaining feature ""DisneyPedia: Mulan's World"", comprised of ten shorts on the film's elements and culture, is another notable casualty. Also gone: the no longer applicable introduction about being able to toggle angles for the production stages demonstration. Included on Mulan's first DVD (a non-anamorphic Limited Issue disc repackaged as a Gold Classic Collection edition) but subsequently dropped and still not resurfacing is its original theatrical trailer. That's a bummer both for fans of Randy Edelman's Dragonheart score and for those who appreciated the use of some rough animation and shots not used in the final film.

Of the four Disney films getting a new re-released on Blu-ray/DVD combo packs in March 2013, Mulan seems to be the only one that got a new DVD re-mastering, and thus lost the original bonus material. For those buying this for the Blu-ray, i would have preferred to keep the old DVD and watch those bonuses as I am not going to bother watching the movie on DVD.
So decide for yourself if it is worth buying again, only to keep your old 2004 DVD for the missing bonuses.",1363132800,76,1755,4.959183673469388

It is not to be hateful, but i collect all the Disney movies, and when they came out with cinderella you didn't see it come out with part 2 and 3. A combo pack in my opinion lowers the value of the collection. Where as if it were just the normal double diamond edition of Mulan i would be totally jazzed.",1360368000,11,407,3.8452380952380953
3436307,5,B0019ESNFU,"The first Mulan Movie is my favorite Disney movie of all time. Not only do my wife and kids love it, I actually enjoy watching it with them.  The story has a very positive message for kids that says they can do anything they put their minds to.  On top of that, Eddie Murphy is hilarious in the role of Mushu the Dragon and the bumbling warrior sidekicks are funny too.  The positive message and jokes that are funny for kids and adults make this a very watchable, and enjoyable movie... even if the kids want to watch it over and over again.  The second move is not bad also, so the double pack is a great deal.  One small word of caution, there are several fight scenes in these movies that may be upsetting for very little ones, but overall, the movies are great with happy endings.  The movies really hold up after all these years.  Highly Recommended.",1359936000,6,856,4.345911949685535

3436310,4,B0019ESNFU,"Based upon traditional Chinese folklore (try this take on it for a solid introduction by a noted reteller&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Fa-Mulan-The-Story-of-a-Woman-Warrior/dp/0786814217/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Fa Mulan: The Story of a Woman Warrior</a>), these two movies tell the story of Fa Mulan (Ming-Na Wen), a young girl living in China in the 3rd Century BC.  In the first of the two movies we learn that, as the only child of a considerable landowner, Fa Zhou (Soon-Tek Oh), who was lamed in war some years earlier, Mulan has, somewhat of necessity, grown up something of a tomboy, dressing in trousers, working in the fields, and riding her horse Khan astride; but she's found over the years that she enjoys this kind of life--the prospect of ""meeting our Matchmaker (Miriam Margolyes)"" terrifies her, and the process of getting ""primped and polished"" so that ""boys will gladly go to war for [her]"" seems rather stupid.  But in her culture, women are at best second-class citizens, and ""a girl can bring her family/Great honor...by striking a good match.""  Then the Huns break through the Great Wall, and the Emperor (Pat Morita) issues a conscription order across the length and breadth of his domain.  To spare her father having to go to war, Mulan cuts off her hair, dresses in her father's old armor, and, accompanied by Khan, a lucky cricket given her by her mother, and a disgraced family guardian (a miniature dragon called Mushu (Eddie Murphy)), joins a company of recruits commanded by Captain Shan-Yu (Miguel Ferrer), the eager-to-prove-himself son of General Li (James Shigeta).  If her disguise is discovered, she risks death, but her love for her father and her own awareness of her inward strengths make her positive that this is her only choice.  At first she finds posing as a boy difficult, but before too long she proves her courage, dedication, patriotism, and ability to think quickly and use her body skilfully, and even earns the comradeship of three of the misfit recruits, diminutive squint-eyed Yao (Harvey Fierstein), jokey Ling (Gedde Watanabe), and gentle giant Chien-Po (Jerry Tondo).  She saves Shan-Yu's life in the mountains, delays the Huns by causing an avalanche, is found out and disgraced, and then redeems herself when she discovers that the Huns have survived and infiltrated the Imperial City itself, and comes up with a plan to stop them.

In the second movie, Mulan, now recognized as the Hero of China, has agreed to marry Shan-Yu, but before the wedding can take place, the duo are summoned by the Emperor to carry out a mission for him.  The ruler of the neighboring realm of Qi Gong has agreed to help the Chinese against the still-threatening Huns if the Emperor will send three of his daughters to marry three Qi Gong princes, and as the road goes through bandit country, a stout escort is needed.  Calling up Mulan's three friends, Yao, Ling, and Chien-Po, to help out, Mulan and Shan-Yu set out to deliver the princesses, Mei (Lucy Liu), Ting Ting (Sandra Oh), and Su (Lauren Tom).  But there are complications.  Mushu has discovered that if Mulan marries Shan-Yu, his family's guardians will take over her protection and Mushu himself will be demoted, so he's resolved to set the two against each other.  And the three misfit soldiers, who had hoped that their heroism would win them wives, have discovered that finding willing girls isn't so easy--until they meet the princesses and a triple mutual attraction blooms.

Mulan is a character many girls will identify with, even in today's more liberated climate, and her struggle to balance her society's expectations with who she feels she really is carries relevant messages for adults too.  Though Murphy as Mushu is slightly over the top, the other voice talents are well done, and there's plenty of fast-paced high-octane action, peril, and people doing physical things gracefully and well.  (And, yes, the Huns, though they were the ancestors of today's Hungarians and ultimately went west, did in fact imperil China during this time period.)  Admittedly the second movie is vaguely disappointing (at least to me), but it has its good points, and on balance the set is well worth adding to your collection.",1260748800,34,4271,5.095988538681948
3436311,5,B0019ESNFU,"I enjoy watching Mulan 1 & 2. The majority of Disney films, the main female characters are princesses in distress. Like Snow White bites the apple and sleeps, then the prince saves her. The Little Mermaid, Sleepy Beauty . . . Unfortunate, Disney and other film companies should promote more females as the main protagonist (HERO) in nonfiction or fiction movies like Mulan, who saves China not only once but twice with help of her friends. Kids these days would feel inspired than limited to the stereotype role. Overall, Mulan is good family film to add in your collection of movies. A must.",1258070400,3,592,4.757281553398058
