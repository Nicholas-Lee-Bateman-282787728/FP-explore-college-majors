Maybe this experiment will ultimately not work, but it is well meaning.
Anything that may save tigers from becoming extinct is worth considering.",1403049600,,181,5.275862068965517
8479446,5,B005MKSQXQ,"The sight of this man lying next to a female tiger while she nursed her cub was so beautiful and full of trust and love, it was heart warming.  You must watch it to see this remarkable relationship.",1389225600,,198,4.2105263157894735
8479447,5,B005MKSQXQ,"Fantastic footage, absolutely mind blowing. Watching a man walk up to a tiger while it's eating a freshly killed carcass, and with the tiger bearing its teeth at the bloke was hair raising.",1380672000,,189,4.757575757575758
8479448,5,B005MKSQXQ,"My wife ordered this DVD for me since she knows how much I love tigers. I watched it last week with her and my niece. I was hoping for this documentary to follow the journey of Ron and Julie ( a documentary from Discovery&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Living-with-Tigers/dp/B000HMGQ36/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Living with Tigers</a>&nbsp;and it was! I've signed up to recive updates of that project ( breeding wild tigers in Africa ) and then this documentary came as great news!

The tiger man of Africa ( Jon) tried to breed tigers in Africa to preserve them since we continue to lose the battle of saving the tigers in Asia.  The documentary documents the lives of 4 wild tigers and their cubs, challnges they face, successes and failures and their relationship with Jon. If you are a fan of tigers, you would love this video. It consists of 3 episodes going over 125 mins total.",1329177600,5,929,5.228187919463087
