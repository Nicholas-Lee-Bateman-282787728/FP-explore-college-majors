8263894,3,B0016PTA4U,"IMO not the ""best of"" in terms of interesting mysteries.  I've seen far better Banacek episodes in that regard.  This might appeal to Banacek fans who like the shows characters and cliches more than the plots.",1501977600,,209,4.777777777777778

8263896,5,B0016PTA4U,"This DVD gives you the opportunity to get a taste of the great TV  series ""Banacek"".---  I say great that is if you like suave yet manly type characters solving mysteries---. George Peppard  plays Banacek an unorthodox, intelligent, risk taking independent insurance investigator.  The insurance companies call him in when they can't solve super high end  ( $ millions $ ) heists etc.-- Banacek earns 10% of these huge millions.  He's got a chauffer a limo and his personal car is a super stylish 1930s  ultra rare classic. ---With this DVD you basicly get half of season 1---One of the two discs that come with Banacek season 1.",1425168000,,629,4.768518518518518
8263897,5,B0016PTA4U,"DVD was delivered well within the estimated window.
I am a fan of George Peppard and I thought ""Banacek"" was a fantastic series.
The quality/clarity of the DVD's is excellent.",1376438400,2,175,4.866666666666666
8263898,4,B0016PTA4U,some scenes were omitted but it all worked out in the end.  wish the season dvd's were cheaper it would be nice.,1374451200,3,112,4.090909090909091

8263900,5,B0016PTA4U,I loved this DVD.  It was a trip down memory lane.  The only thing I regret about this is that I didn't spend a little more money and get the DVD with more episodes.  I loved it!,1273968000,7,178,3.7567567567567566
8263901,4,B0016PTA4U,"Each Banacek episode involves a crime puzzle (not a murder) that private investigator Thomas Banacek must solve, e.g., the disappearance of priceless art works in sealed crates, in a sealed truck between New York and Boston.  The writer of each story cheats just a little by not giving the viewer quie all the facts that Banacek has in figuring out the solution, but that is par in most mysteries.

I do have one misgiving about the hero.  He is quite the ladies man, understandably, and there is always a beautiful woman involved.  So far, so good.  But, in the ethos of the time when these TV films were made, Banacek is patronizing, even condescending toward women.  A slight smirk on his face indicates that he does not take pretty women or their opinions seriously--and he is always right in doing so--or so the writers would have us believe.  I found myself wincing just a bit sometimes.

Still, the tales are interesting, the acting generally good, and the atmosphere right.  I do recommend these, with the reservations noted.  Perfect, Banacek isn't, but the series is above average TV crime fare.",1234396800,12,1105,4.798941798941799
8263902,5,B0016PTA4U,"With the entire series on 2 affordable sets, this seems to be a ploy on the manufacturer's part to go el cheapo.  There were only 16 episodes plus the pilot in the entire series.  Picking 4 of the 17 as a ""Best of collection"" is dumb.  You are better off buying the Season sets, or better still, buying the complete set coming out after this disc does.",1214006400,27,352,4.223880597014926
