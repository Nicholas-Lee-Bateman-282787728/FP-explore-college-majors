652716,5,6303453961,"Emotional and realistic portralial of the American Civil War and how it effected both north, south and those caught in the middle. Unlike some war  movies which ignore the human cost this movie shows in detail the cost to  the main characters. Class of 61' is one of the best movies that I have  seen. The movie starts at West Point and shows us the last class before the  war starts. The friendships between those of southern back ground and the  northerns and how their friendships are torn apart by the war.",966816000,17,510,4.5
7847654,4,6303453961,"RELEASED TO TV IN 1993 and directed by Gregory Hoblit, The Class of 61 details what happens when three West Point graduates & their friends opt for opposite sides when the The Civil War breaks out and the impending Battle of Bull Run destroys any delusions of a quick, glorious victory for the Union.

Despite the limitations of a TV budget, this is a well-done Civil War drama that leads up to the Battle of Bull Run. While there aren't any sweeping shots of this initial battle (because the budget wouldnt allow for it), I liked the way the movie focuses on the individuals experience during battle with those in the immediate vicinity.

Dan Futterman stands out as the main protagonist, but there are some future stars as well, like Clive Owen and Josh Lucas, the latter playing Armstrong Custer. The movie scores well on the female front with the jaw-dropping Sue-Ann Leeds, as well as Sophie Ward and a young Laura Linney. Its also interesting seeing Robert Newman again.

Besides the closing battle sequence, a couple of scenes are dramatically exceptional: The compelling train sequence and, especially, the quiet fishing boat scene where the protagonist has an honest talk with his black friend, who also happens to be a family slave (Andre Braugher).

FYI: This was originally intended as the first of a 13-episode miniseries.

7847655,4,6303453961,"This wasn't originally intended to be a stand alone movie. It was the pilot for a proposed TV series (produced by Steven Spielberg) which wasn't picked up. It was setting up several plot threads that would have been further explored as the series went on. That would also account for the closing text which outlined what would have supposedly happened to all the characters introduced in this first episode.  If viewed in this context, it showed a great deal of promise.  Still worth a look if you are interested in the Civil War.  Also interesting as it featured several future stars: Clive Owen, Laura Linney, Josh Lucas, Andre Braugher.",1487030400,,639,4.844036697247707

7847657,4,6303453961,"The video was enjoyable because I like the civil war period.  It was disappointing in that ""the ante-bellum mansions of the South"" which are stated on the back cover, are shown via paintings and not actual houses.  In addition, the only battle shown was the first battle of Bull Run, which was then interrupted with sequences of a slave woman having a baby, and her husband escaping into Canada via the underground railroad.  A true depiction of the West Point class of 1861, it is not.  I did like Dan Futterman, though.",1469404800,,521,4.630434782608695
7847658,4,6303453961,"I wish I had seen this movie when it had originally come out.  I think then I might have given it a 5* review instead of today's 4*.  The loss of the star is only because it is dated.  Should I knock it down a notch?  I think so in this case.

Class of '61 is about a small group of West Point graduates from the Class of 1861.  Included in this group, at the very bottom of his class, LT George Armstrong Custer.  This class has students from all classes of America's society from the son of an Irish immigrant to the Bawstuhn Uppuh Cruhst.  The Warruh (gotta say that in a Southern accent) breaks out and the class splits to those loyal to the Union, Custer, et al, and those to the newly formed Confederacy, Shelby Peyton (Dan Futterman).

This story is honest.  I think that's the absolute best thing to say about it.  The subplot actually detracts from the movie.  The subplot being a ""not yet freed slave"" Lucius (Andre Braugher), Shelby's oldest friend who kills a slaver chasing him and wounds another.  Lucius doesn't know it but Shelby has lobbied for Lucius' papers.  Lucius' wife, Lavinia (Penny Johnson Jerald) is with child and has had one worrisome episode thus far before birth and has been put to bedrest for the next three weeks.  It is during this time that Lucius decides to take the Underground Railroad north to Canada.

Back to the main plot, the Warruh.  The cruelty and humanity is shown as well as the stupidity; that of the monied out for a picnic to watch the action.  Yes, ladies and gents, it is true.  People were charged to go on ""field trips,"" lunch provided, to watch various battles.  Have we no shame?

Class of '61 is a very dated movie now.  Taking that into consideration, this is a good movie.  As I said, it's honest.  It takes no sides and calls nobody ""right"".  As it is said, ""War Doesn't Determine Who's Right, Only Who's Left.""",1462752000,3,1873,4.422287390029325

7847662,5,6303453961,I was in this movie as an extra. I looked like Carroll Channing because they made me wear a wig. I got laughed at the whole time but the directors kept pulling me to the front for shots. It was shot in North Georgia and the day I was in the shoot it was cold and rainy and I was wearing a uniform that felt like it was made of steel wool. Have not seen it but I am sure it is fantastic since I am in it. I am going to buy it.,1251936000,2,425,3.5319148936170213
7847663,5,6303453961,"""Class of '61"" tells the story of the graduating West Point class of 1861 as the Civil War breaks out. It has fine performances and an exciting and almost 100% accurate recreation of the battle of First Manassas. A fine film! I hope it comes out on DVD soon!
