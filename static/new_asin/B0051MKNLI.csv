4523208,5,B0051MKNLI,"I purchased this DVD because Peter is in the highest echelon of drummers on the scene today. I absolutely love his drumming no matter the situation!

He absolutely kicks a band into high gear when in a concert situation. Witness Diana Krall's concert DVD at the Montreal Jazz Festival or the ""We Love Ella"" DVD from 2007. Also, his contributions to the Big Phat Band's ""XXL"" CD are fantastic!

In conclusion, Peter provides much valuable information always. He is a gracious guy and deserves attention and respect. You will learn much good stuff from this DVD. Remember......time keeping is everything!",1313193600,5,602,5.01
8452876,5,B0051MKNLI,"If you like to understand drumming this is it. No circus acts, no pounding your drum kit. However, the greatest artists are letting you watch what they do, and you think ""That is very simple, I can do that too"". Until you go and practice. But Peter is taking you by the hand and get you where you want to be; step by step. Just practice and go back a step if necessary. Peter Erskine, for me, is one of the greatest educators on percussion!!",1416268800,,441,4.2
8452877,5,B0051MKNLI,"A great work produced by this icon. You can learn a lot as Peter speaks to you in his friendly, Wilfred Brimely manner. Everything makes sense and is valuable. I have several of Peter's DVD's and I think this is the best one.
 This provides the rare combination of important learning material with performance material to reinforce it. Everything is enjoyable and produced with the highest of quality. I keep coming back to enjoy and learn.
 Any student, teacher, or fan of Jazz should have this in their house.",1410393600,,511,4.730337078651686
8452878,3,B0051MKNLI,"disappointed, boaring, lot of wasted fill, boy could I make a drum video, it wouldn't be filled with wasted time, it wouldn't take a 100 people to produce, it would be at least 3 hours, and wouldn't cost 100K to make, it would cover lessons that you would want to watch many times, and have some printed materiel with it(drum notation) I own about 100 drum videos, I fall asleep fast when trying to watch this one",1408406400,,413,4.376623376623376
8452879,5,B0051MKNLI,"This is exceptional value, from an entertainment perspective and from a student.  I learnt a lot from this very entertaining DVD.",1374624000,,129,5.142857142857143
8452880,4,B0051MKNLI,Peter does a great job with this vid. I learned more than just licks. I found alot of useful material and recommend this video.,1365638400,4,127,4.333333333333333
8452881,5,B0051MKNLI,"Peter Erskine does an excellent job presenting the material in 15 lessons, including jazz comping, soloing, odd times, brushwork, play and critique, the shuffle (even talks about how he played Birdland when he was in Weather Report).  There is also a several song performance which is killer with his band.  What I really enjoyed was the 3 lessons involving brushes, I just liked Peter's approach to the brushes and the way he presented the material.  His explanations are clear,  This will keep you busy for a long time, if you find some of the material too tough, I would recommend John Riley's ""Art of Bop Drumming"" to get you started in jazz drumming as that book really helped me, especially with comping.  Get shedding and start swingin!  If you follow Peter's advice you will become a better, more musical drummer, which is what's all about, supporting the other musicians in our lifelong journey.",1358985600,7,904,4.875816993464053
8452882,5,B0051MKNLI,They had it for a Great price . It was well packed. And the shipping was fast. Two thumbs up.,1358899200,,93,3.7
8452883,5,B0051MKNLI,Worth its weight in gold for drummers. Can't be beat for the price. (Pun intended). Can be viewed many times.,1355011200,4,109,4.5
8452884,5,B0051MKNLI,"Short of attending school and having Mr. Erskine as a teacher, this collection constitutes the best drum lessons I've had in all my decades of being a jazz drummer wannabe. Even a brief 3 minute viewing of any section is a musical epiphany. Less is more and the notes not played, Peter Erskine is one of the best and most sensitive drummers out there and the finest teacher of drums I've experienced; this collection a must have.

8452885,5,B0051MKNLI,"I honestly believe Peter Erskine is the best high profile drum educator. So articulate! So clean and uncomplicated in his playing and musicality.

Note carefully, this is not a chops show off video! Peter's information is jazz centric, and a young drummer could be bored at times by the content. But if you want to understand jazz drumming, or like me you want to be a better jazz drummer, but can't afford to dedicate a few years to a jazz degree. Then this DVD is a step in the right direction, and a bargain for the knowledge.

My favourite section in this DVD is Peter having his own students play with his seasoned band, then they dissect the freshman players. Now this could be seen as ""unfair"", but to me, I saw playing similar to my own, and why it is ordinary or weak. Constructive criticism is given as to how and what to improve. This gives me hope that I'm not alone in my ""ordinary-ness"", yet can improve with all the info on offer.

There are some great performances, excellent clear defined usable information and illustration and there's an authenticity to this production. I can't imagine 5 private lessons, would be much better.",1329091200,22,1146,4.607843137254902
