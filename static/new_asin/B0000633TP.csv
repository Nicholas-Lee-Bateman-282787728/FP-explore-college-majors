8590087,5,B0000633TP,"This film feels and looks like a seventies film.  Keys on the performances, although I wish some of the camera work and editing where better.  It still sucks you in to the journey of the lead characters in a big way.  Their journey to an island on a lake in scenic Oregon is both heartbreaking and leaves the viewer with that dreaded feeling of impending doom.  Definitely would call it somewhat of a chick flick but worth the watch just the same.",1036886400,,447,4.414634146341464
8590088,5,B0000633TP,I had never heard of this film before.  It really surprised me.  Very well made independent film.  I thought the performances were outstanding and the Oregon coastline gorgeous.  After renting so many bad independent films I'm amazed this one didn't have a larger release.,1030665600,,272,5.113636363636363
