786093,5,6304111088,"Have you ever read The Canterbury Tales?  Allusions to classical literature abound.  These references were a sort of shorthand or jargon of the time, a way of saying much by saying little.  To refer to Zephirus, for instance, is to mention the warm, sweet breezes of Spring and to conjure up that time of year, with all of its freshness and new life.
Episode 102 presents a culture in which this sort of idiom is carried to the extreme.  The words are getting through, but the meaning is not.  The struggle of the two captains, the alien and Picard, to bridge the gap is brilliant and fascinating.
This is my favorite Star Trek episode of all time, of all generations.
Magnificent.",1002499200,7,681,4.595041322314049
786094,5,6304111088,"As a language teacher, I found this episode of Star Trek to be very satisfying. Captain Picard is captured by the alien force, and put into a very frustrating situation -- no one can understand this civilization's language. They speak what appears to be English, but the meaning of their words has up to this moment been impossible to decode. When Captain Picard speaks to his alien counterpart, the latter, too, finds our hero's words undecipherable. Tension builds, conflict seems inevitable.
As the episode unfolds, the ship's computer reveals cultural information which -- slowly -- leads to the Captain's success at breaking the 'code'. In my humble opinion, the episode's final scene was _very_ satisfying. I would show it to any language student who wonders about what it was like to be in a class on the first day of school. And what it's like to begin to understand the 'code' of a new language.",990316800,6,904,4.838709677419355
786095,5,6304111088,"Simply put, ""Darmok"" is a brilliant episode that exemplifies everything that ST:TNG has to offer.  I show it to skeptics as proof that Star Trek can feature excellent acting, strong concepts, and moving scenes.  I have never decided on a favorite TNG episode, but Darmok is one of the several that are tied for first.  It also has a deep significance to me, because I firmly believe in the power of stories to communicate deep truths.  In ""Darmok,"" we are shown a culture which uses *only* stories to communicate, which is a fascinating exploration of the possibilities of narrative.  As for moving scenes and stellar (ha, ha) acting, I especially point out the scene in which Dathon tells Picard the story of Darmok and Jelad (sp?), and Picard tells Dathon the story of Gilgamesh and Enkidu.  But the whole episode, from the opening to the end credits, is well-acted and powerful.  And, of course, it must be noted that this episode reveals a very telling difference between Kirk and Picard.  When Kirk was beamed down to the planet with an alien captain who apparently wanted to fight him, Kirk took the sucker out.  Picard, in a virtually identical situation, refused to fight, figured out a way to communicate, and became the first to make meaningful contact with the Tamarians.  But I digress.  To recap, this is definitely one of the top five episodes, and I know many who'd firmly place it in slot #1.  It belongs in the home of any TNG fan, and anyone who is interested in good acting, good human drama, or the power of story.",984787200,16,1534,4.661710037174721
786096,5,6304111088,"As with all the best Star Trek episodes over the years (and I've seen just about all of them), ""Darmok"" combines fine acting, a top-notch story, great character interaction, and something to say.  In this case, the acting of Patrick Steward (as Picard, of course) and Paul Winfield (as the Tamarian Captain Dathon) is superb, as is their interaction.  The story is excellent too, as the two captains battle both a deadly enemy AND their inability to communicate.  Finally, ""Darmok"" has a lot to say, particularly about the difficulties and frustrations, but ultimately the great benefits, of attempting to communicate across cultural divides.
Here we have one species that communicates by using metaphors and images.  Thus, a great military disaster might be communicated in our culture as ""Pearl Harbor.""  Or, a farcical Presidential election might be stated as ""Bush and Gore in 2000.""  While comprehensible to someone who is familiar with American history, to someone from a different culture or world, this would make no sense whatsoever even if the individual words ""Pearl"" and ""Harbor"" were translated perfectly.
Thus, ""Mirab, with sails unfurled,"" has clear meaning to Dathon and his people, but not to Picard, even though the universal translator is working fine.  Ultimately, of course, Picard ""gets it,"" because Picard is GOD! :)  (Although even Picard ""gets it"" too late to save Dathon).  But how about the rest of us here on Earth who cannot understand other cultures, because the frame of reference is so alien?
Anyway, by the end of ""Darmok,"" maybe you too will be able to exclaim ""Sucat, his eyes uncovered!"" and actually know what it means!!  Great way to impress the neighbors -- or make them think you're really smart, but strange. :)  Enjoy!",974937600,11,1760,5.055363321799308
786097,5,6304111088,"One of the best acted of the ""Next Generation"" episodes, ""Darmok"" is truly the essence of Star Trek: a tale of breaking down barriers and effectively communicating the similarities and differences which make us all essential to the well-being of the universe.",970963200,4,259,5.190476190476191
786098,5,6304111088,"Next to ""Best of Both Worlds"" or ""Yesterday's Enterprise,"" ""Darmok"" is one of the most intelligent and vibrant episodes of the entire Next Generation catalog. Picard's attempts,  and eventual success, to communicate with the Tamarian captain, wonderfully  portrayed by Paul Winfield, is splendid. Obviously, most Star Trek stories,  whether they be the original series or TNG, offer socio-political  commentary on our own society, this episode is no different. It basically  teaches that communication with peoples or entities that are different than  us can be accomplished if one is willing to try. ""Darmok"" is  Patrick Stewart's finest hour in TNG.",964656000,9,651,5.515151515151516
786099,5,6304111088,"This is my favorite episode of ALL TIME bar none and that includes Original,NexGen,DS9,Voyager.
The performance of Paul Winfield is stirring and haunting and Patrick Stewart is exceptional as usual.
Look for a  Riveting finale.",924739200,,227,5.485714285714286
7862236,5,6304111088,"What I love most about this episode is the dawning realization of the other side of the story.  I always loved this episode, but initially, it seems like the Temarian first officer is unnecessarily harsh for no reason.  Callous and negligent. However, after watching several times and learning what each metaphor signified, it became possible to actually follow the conversation, arguments, and lines of reasoning between Dathon (The Temarian Captain) and his first officer. My entire perspective of the Temarian first officer changed after rewatching and understanding the argument between he and Dathon.  Then, suddenly, Riker's heroism and fierce determination at absolutely nothing more than saving the captain, starts to look a lot more like  stubbornness, and close-mindedness. Pay close attention to the subtle details in what Data says, in regards to exactly how the Temarians are handling the Enterprise in their captain's' absence, the shuttle craft, and in the end just when Picard is beamed back, when things nearly came to a head.  The entire scope of the power and capabilities of the Temarian ship slowly become clear.  Who really is the ""bad guy"" here? Between the Temarian ship and the Enterprise, who would have really ""won"", had Picard and Dathon not came to an understanding when they did?  The value of that communication, and which side stands to benefit the most from it, becomes so clear, with of the gradual dawning that the Temarians are NOT ones whom you want on the opposite side of a war.

Such a well done episode.  This one is my favorite of TNG.",1400803200,,1577,5.011494252873563
7862237,5,6304111088,"As usual, Next Generation was really thinking outside the box on this one. I bought this a present for my husband because years later, we still talk about it.",1371254400,,158,4.482758620689655
7862238,5,6304111088,"I can't count the number of times I've watched this particular episode of STNG and, I never tire of it.  'Darmok' shows what televison CAN be and should strive TO be.  To watch Picard and the alien captain trying to communicate translates to our present earth when we try to communicate with cultures foreign to our own.  It takes patience and, many times, one will never be understood by another culture.  This is a program that should be shown in schools and discussed.  I'm not going too far in saying this is my favorite episode of any Star Trek series.",1353715200,,557,4.53
7862239,5,6304111088,"Picard gets stranded on an alien world with an alien captain he can't communicate with. As Picard and the alien captain struggle to communicate with each other, they also find themselves being hunted by an invisible savage creature. If that wasn't bad enough, the Enterprise crew are unable to get to the captain, and they're on the verge of going to war with the alien captain's vessel. Even if Picard manages to survive the creature, can he learn to communicate with the aliens and get back to the ship before an interstellar war breaks out?

It's not only action-packed with some good acting, good effects, and a great story, but it also has heart. Apart from the action, there are some great character moments between Picard and the alien captain that makes this one truly a great episode. It's everything Star Trek should be, and everything Star Trek creator Gene Roddenberry wanted it to be. Highly recommended!",1325548800,,917,4.840764331210191
7862240,4,6304111088,"I love this episode.  Loved it when I watched the series 20 years ago, and really enjoyed it last night on the DVD.  It's moving and mysterious.

However, I gotta say that as a now-middle-aged woman, I find the logical plotholes troubling.

1)  How do the Tamarians learn of their legends if they only speak in metaphors?  In other words, how do small Tamarian children hear the enthralling story of Darmok if there is no ""real"" language beyond metaphor with which to tell it?  Somewhere, to create the important emotional resonance of ""Darmok and Jalad at Tanagra,"" a  parent has to sit the child down and say, ""Once upon a time, many years ago, there was a man named Darmok.  He was on a mission...""  The child has to understand what the ocean is, what Tanagra is, what danger is.  The ability to relate legends in a narrative format would seem to imply the ability to relate factual information in the same linear (first, second, third) format.  If Tamarians can relate their mythic history in story form, why can't they relate their own stories to Picard?

2)  People who only live at this level of metaphor surely would not have the language needed to create spaceships with which to explore the universe.  In order to build a craft, some Tamarian somewhere would have to say, ""Let's make this exactly 4.2 centimeters from side to side,"" so that cities and technology could be constructed.  Again, the ability to speak in precise language that allows the building of communicators and transporters seems to imply the ability to say, ""We're from Tamar, and we want peace with your people.""

People with this limited a range of expression would, I'm guessing, live primitive lives - at least as far as measured by technology.  They may have a rich, meaningful society, but it would not be a technically advanced one.  I'm thinking of intelligent animals like dolphins and gorillas, who doubtless have some basic understanding of their world, as well as some basic communication - but no intricacy of language to allow them to stretch their technology.",1267315200,,2054,4.784090909090909
7862241,5,6304111088,"The Gilgamesh saga is not well known in modern America. We often reference biblical and other ancient texts in cliche form without really knowing the original sources. The cliches take on their own meaning for us. These are modern metaphorical references; a kind of shorthand for meaning. When I watched this episode I felt my hair rise on my head. I thought, ""My God! Everyone in America will know this ancient, powerful story of love, loss and enduring friendship. What was lost has been reborn...in a science fiction story, of all things!"" I think that what I've always liked best about science fiction, is the freedom of the writers to go hog wild with their imaginations. But to utilize this particular text, so fresh and modern sounding, instead of say, the Arthurian legend, was intriguing. This choice shows the writer's erudition without pumping it up too much. It's totally believable that Picard would have this reference on tap.
I went back to the original Gilgamesh text, and reread it. I didn't have patience for it in college, but now I had a new perspective. I'm very grateful that I did. I loved this series, but this was my favorite episode. I was so pleased to see how many others felt the same.",1258675200,,1214,4.731132075471698
7862242,5,6304111088,"Plot:  The Enterprise encounters a Tamarian battlecruiser in an effort (from both sides) to communicate.  Suddenly, without warning, the Tamarian captain and Picard are transported to the planet for what appears to be a contest between captains to the death.  As the Enterprise crew desperately tries to find a way to beam Capt. Picard back (the Tamarian ship has placed a scattering field that blocks transporter beams), Picard and Dathon (the Tamarian captain) continue to try and communicate to each other.  When it becomes apparent that there's a deadly creature on the planet which Picard and Dathon must defeat or be killed, the Enterprise is forced to attack the Tamarian battlecruiser.  What's going to happen next?

Great episode for several reasons:  This episode was far more different compared to dealing with other species (Fighting the Borg, getting caught in the middle of a diplomatic crisis with some species, having to decide whether to obey the Prime Directive or save a under-technologicalized species, etc.) and it refreshing that both the sides were curious and non-aggresive in intent.  Also, the way they try and communicate is very well done.

7862243,5,6304111088,"In the fifth season, in a huge matter of coinecdence and luck. The two best shows of the fifth season came before and after two part conclusions and cliffhangers. That would be The Inner Light, which aired before Time's Arrow part one. And Darmok, which aired after Redemption part 2. It also should be noted that Patrick Stewart's best season five performances are in these two episodes. Darmok is a piece of brilliant television writing. Its a story of what if you can't rely on the universal translator? What if you had to rely on someones trust to lead you to your goal. Both of the captains don't understand each other. But when an enemy attacks them, Picard finally understand that the aliens language is based off metophors of famous events in the alien's culture. In another beautiful scene when Picard tells the alien the myth of Glighmesh. All around the show is brilliant. Both Patrick Stewart and the late Paul Winfield are amazing. This episode and the second to last episode The Inner Light are the seasons two best. And the series overall.",1106092800,2,1054,4.733695652173913
7862244,1,6304111088,"How anyone can enjoy this episode is beyond me. The Tamarians speak in riddles and even after seeing this countless times, I still cannot explain what the point is.

7862245,5,6304111088,"""Darmok"" captures what is the heart and soul of Star Trek: discovering new races and learning to coexist with them. In this episode, that is no easy feat for Picard, who is trapped on a planet with an alien captain who talks different from everyone else. The two cannot understand each other, but as a monster hunts them down, it becomes apparent that the two must learn how to communicate. This is a phenominal episode, downplaying the action and instead building on the characters of the alien captain and Picard. It's not just good Star Trek, it's great science-fiction. While the monster effects are very subpar (they always are for Star Trek), the being itself is of little importance to the story. What is important is how Picard and the other captain learn how to communicate. Truly a wonderful episode.",1043280000,,810,4.792857142857143
