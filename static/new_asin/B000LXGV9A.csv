2716161,4,B000LXGV9A,"The acting, the story, and the action are all over the top. Koyla is a great film directed by Rakesh Roshan a genius filmmaker.

Shahrukh Khan is excellent in his role and gives a dynamic performance. Madhuri Dixit is wonderful in most of all her films and gives a good performance. Deepshika an unknown actress, rather now very well known actress was damn sexy.

Rakesh has made Khudgarz, Kishan Kanhaiya, Karan Arjun, Krrish etc. Koyla is not better than any of those films mentioned but is a fabulous film.

Amrish Puri is excellent as the villain lots of venom in his role. The guy that plays Amrish's son does a good job as the disturbed mental bad guy. The movie has many nice songs and overall is an out and out entertainer.

This Movie is really an awesome movie on my list. I Considered This Movie ""The Best Shah Rukh Khan Movie"". I Like The Stunt Where Shah Rukh Khan Was Running With His Clothes.

One of Shah Rukh's best films!",1303084800,,939,4.4678362573099415
2716162,4,B000LXGV9A,"Koyla is one of my favourite Bollywood movies of all time. Any movie starring Shahrukh Kahn,Madhuri Dixit and Amrish Puri is bound to be highly entertaining.
 I don't wish to sound cliched but Koyla has everything you'd expect from a great movie (particularly a Bollywood romance/action movie)-a superb story (believe it or not),high adventure,comedy,over-the-top action,a great romance and some wonderful song and dance numbers (all of which I liked and that's an uncommon thing for me when I'm watching a Hindi film!)The songs are also subtitled so the meaning and relevance of each can be fully understood;and some of them are just beautiful.
 I could be being biased here,as Shahrukh is my favourite Bollywood actor but he does  play the wounded and loveable hero better than anybody else and always with such tremendous gusto.
 And then there's Madhuri,who is a damn fine actress and excudes a natural charm and beauty in any film she's in (might I add that she's one of my favourite actresses).I love the strong willed characters she's played in the past and her role as Gauri is no exception. Madhuri is also one of the few actresses who can REALLY dance and in Koyla she dances like the wind!
 And what can I say about Amrish? Just that the Indian film industry has lost a true legend. He has played the archetypal villain in a manner that will probably never be surpassed and he has a physical presence on screen that is both frightening and mesmerizing. In Koyla he plays the Raj with  skin-crawling relish. Those eyes! Yeesh.
 The support cast are great with Johnny Lever throwing in his usual slapstick comedy which can sometimes be irritating, while Deepshka's performance was a stand-out for me.
 Kudos must also be given to Rakesh Roshan who co-wrote and directed the film, keeping it engaging all the way through to the end.
 Koyla is a contemporary film with a traditional feel, mainly because it's set in the countryside and has the evil Raj and his cronies exacting some pretty medieval punishment upon the poor villagers.
 The downside to Koyla is perhaps the gratuitous violence (which some could argue is perfectly acceptable in an action film),the shabby special effects and the dodgy fight scenes where you can clearly see the actors aren't even coming into contact with each other. The editing's not so crash hot either.
 I also can't understand why the filmakers use (and continue to use) that terrible 'punching' sound effect which really sounds like they're beating a dead whale with a stick.
 Koyla only did moderately well at the box office when it premiered back in 1997, but for me it was an instant hit even when I watched it for the first time without the aid of subtitles. I will always love this film as it was thoroughly absorbing,suspenseful,heart wrenching and just an all round fantastic movie.",1231286400,20,2834,4.869022869022869

2716207,2,B000LXGV9A,"I really LOVED the movie when I finally watched it.  I enjoyed the story line but not the miss match of the voice over. Lips moving with a delayed voices and sounds.  DON'T order from ""Rahul & I - Indian Music House""
I'M TOTALLY BUMMED that when I went to return or replace I missed the return date.  This movie will definitely be on ""MY FAVORITE BOLLYWOOD MOVIE LIST"" to watch!  I only wish I got a better copy.

Personal Rating:
MOVIE:  5 STAR
DVD QUALITY: 1 STAR (only because 1st half was ok / no delayed voices)",1375315200,3,516,4.214285714285714
2716208,3,B000LXGV9A,"This is a good movie, but the quality of the DVD is pretty abysmal. I was expecting a higher quality picture. The subtitles are not very well done either, with many misspellings and some parts not subtitled at all. I hope to find more of Shah Rukh Khan's earlier movies put onto quality DVDs in the future.",1349136000,,306,4.385964912280702
2716209,5,B000LXGV9A,"Shah Rukh Khan is superb in this film. Madhuri Dixit is also wonderful. While a young boy, Shah Rukh  Khan's character, Shankar, loses his parents because of a rich, greedy, controlling man who dominates the village. (Shankar doesn't find this out for a long time.) This evil man then adopts Shankar, but treats him as a slave. Shankar innocently serves this wicked man with loyalty and devotion, not realizing what a wicked man his master is. One day, the wicked man sees a beautiful girl (Madhuri Dixit) and wants to marry her. Once Madhuri Dixit arrives at the evil man's house, Shankar begins to recognize that his master is not a good man. Shankar (Shah Rukh Khan) is a hero in this film. With great difficulty, and overcoming seemingly impossible setbacks, he is able to rescue the girl. He also is able to conquer the evil man and other evil men associated with him. I love this film!!!",1335312000,5,893,4.651898734177215
2716210,5,B000LXGV9A,i'm a big fan of shah rukh khan and i think this movie was awesome. it displayed survival skills aswell showed the power of true love.,1333411200,,134,4.1923076923076925
2716211,3,B000LXGV9A,"Acting was good but I felt like watching an Indian version of Rambo or the likes. So not what I expected. Actions (not to the level of Holywood, of course).",1317859200,,156,4.233333333333333
2716212,3,B000LXGV9A,"The DVD I was sent was not from Eros but from some ""Video and Sound"" distributor. I don't know if it is them or what, but the whole film has the edges chopped off to the point where sometimes half of an actors face is off screen or they are entirely off screen. During one of the songs, the sound also drops off.

I don't know if a copy from Eros would be better or not, but this Video and Sound version of the movie is not good quality.

The movie itself is actually quite good though, that is if you like over-the-top filmi revenge movies.  Madhuri is great in the film, that girl can dance! And I always love Shahrukh Khan. So if you are a Madhuri or Shahrukh fan you will probably like this. Though Shahrukh and some of the other actors have some seriously bad hair in the film. Mullets never looked good on anyone.

My only other gripe is that the special effects were pretty bad in one scene in particular with an axe. I'm sure they could have done that without the special effects so why mess up a good scene?

All in all a good film for the Shahrukh/Madhuri fans or fans of the 90s revenge flicks like Karan Arjun.",1307577600,7,1122,4.175925925925926

8164909,5,B000LXGV9A,"One of my favorite Bollywood films. Best musical sound track. Great dance sequences. Wounderful performance by Shahrukh and Madhuri. Great story.
The villain is so evil it makes it hard to enjoy at first, but it builds towards one of the best climaxes ever as the heros take the villain down.
One disclaimer: the way Bollywood films were made then allowed for rough cuts in the sound design. The soundtrack or sound fx are sometimes cut off making it feel like a lower quality film. But the cinematography, editing, acting ... are first class.",1476662400,,543,4.787234042553192
8164910,4,B000LXGV9A,"Okay, I admit to being a really hardcore Shah Rukh Khan fan. That's probably behind my rating of four stars, but that doesn't mean that this film doesn't deserve a good rating.  In this early SRK outing, he is a mute with whom the beautiful daughter of the mansion (the incomparable Madhuri Dixit) falls in love.  One thing leads to another and their love, of course, is thwarted so they run off together for a series of  very Bollywood adventures. Always known for his amazing ability to express himself with just his facial features, SRK shows this off in aces in Kolya, making it really worthwhile for anyone, but especially the fledgling SRK fan, to see.  Little tidbit--he has some interesting stunt work in this film (he does the majority of his own stunts) and the scene with the chandelier is particularly awesome, although it is one in which he was injured during filming.  This is vintage young King of  Bollywood stuff, well worth the view.",1470614400,3,951,4.698795180722891

8164915,4,B000LXGV9A,"This is one of Shahrukh Khan's early movies and you can really see the difference! I gave this movie 4 stars based upon the chemistry and entertaining scenes between SRK and Madhuri Dixit. The second half of the movie is much better than the first, so don't give up completely during the first part. The drama is overplayed and the intense cruelty is difficult to find entertaining, but it does improve and gives you something to cheer for. I usually have watched a movie before I buy it for my personal library, but I made a mistake here and didn't review the movie first. Oh well, there are parts that are so bad that you can laugh at it, so not all is lost . . .",1450483200,2,665,4.244094488188976
