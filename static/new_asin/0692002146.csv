7788184,5,0692002146,"One of the most amazing films on how ""black genocide"" is taking over the Afro-American population of America.  This film exposes the eugenics movement (cutting out people who are not deemed superior) is destroying our country......something almost never talked about.  Get it -- you will be glad for what you will learn.",1442880000,2,320,5.134615384615385
7788185,5,0692002146,"The irony of the current blindness of African Americans to the racism of abortion is clear in the fact that President Barak Obama was given a 100% rating by Planned Parenthood and gave a congratulatory speech there when the entire organization was founded upon ""the extermination of the negro population.""  Here are the facts:

1. Since 1973, there have been 17.3 million abortions of African Americans (CDC statistic).
2. African American women make up 14% of the population in the USA.
3. Nearly 80% of abortion clinics are in or near minority communities.
4. 30% of all abortions are of African Americans.",1434931200,2,608,4.950980392156863
7788186,5,0692002146,Wow!  Very insightful.  I learned about the other side of eugenics.  This movie explained how it began and how it continues today.,1427932800,2,130,4.818181818181818
7788187,5,0692002146,"Impeccably researched documentary: disturbing to learn the truth about the continued post-slavery oppression of African Americans in our country.  NOT surprising to learn that Planned Parenthoods founder Margaret Sanger was not only a eugenics proponent but was also vocal about the negroes being an inferior race; did NOT know that she also consulted with Hitler on the programs and policies to eliminate people of Jewish descent.  Today, there is documentation of Planned Parenthoods continued persecution of African Americans: over 3/4of Planned Parenthoods abortion facilities are in low income, minority neighborhoods.  There is ample evidence that callers can specify that their donations go to aborting black children at LiveAction.org",1379548800,14,742,5.851851851851852
