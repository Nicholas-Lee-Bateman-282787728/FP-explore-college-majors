8192939,5,B000PQMK7K,"This Australian/Polish-produced series provides great story-telling and each episode ends in an effective cliff-hanger.  Shown only on the Disney channel once in the mid 90s, we had been looking for this series online for a number of years.  Note that the series is not in North American format, but our inexpensive DVD player had no problem with these DVDs.",1353628800,,358,5.0508474576271185

8192942,5,B000PQMK7K,"Spellbinder is an Australian made sci-fi adventure series made in the mid 90's. Paul is a teenager who when helping a friend play a prank on a school-camp, finds himself transported to a parallel dimension where it seems like the days of Robin Hood, but the land is ruled by Spellbinders, a form of law and empire that rule the land and possess technology that they do not share with the peasants who believe the spellbinders are magicians.

Paul meets up with a beautiful young girl named Rianna, and the more Paul discovers about the place while trying to get back home, the more he opens their eye's to the Spellbinders not being magicians rather then using science.

This TV series spans about 26 half-hour episodes, traveling between villages, castles, and our own reality as the plot grows thicker over the season.

It was a great show, and I was impressed to hear it had even been enjoyed on American and British television and has a small cult like following.

However, one thing I will tell you is that currently the cheapest price on this site says you can purchase it for eighty bucks, BWUAH, look up an Australian DVD seller site and you will find you can import it yourself for less then half that price, and it is well worth purchasing the first season of.

Season 2 has pretty much nothing to do with season one, if you where a fan of Ashka (Heather Mitchell) then season 2 might grab your interest, but season one is all you really need.",1196467200,7,1453,4.530534351145038
