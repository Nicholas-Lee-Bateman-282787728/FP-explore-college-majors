2194390,5,B0006SSPBC,"I've seen this play twice and could not wait until it came out on DVD. Unlike other comedy routines that attempt to define the sexes through typical pop culture stereotypes, this play uses wit and humor to tell its story. Dubac is funny and poignant. The DVD is well worth its entertainment value with friends, a significant other, or just a quite evening by yourself. In short, a surprisingly welcome addition to anyone's DVD collection.",1110758400,3,438,4.8533333333333335

2194392,5,B0006SSPBC,"I have seen this show live, seen the second version live and own a copy of the initial version (the best).  I have purchased several copies of this for my friends because this rings so funny and true to relationships.  I can't even tell you how many times I have re-watched it.  Highly recommended !",1374364800,,299,4.4

2194394,5,B0006SSPBC,It is a laugh riot.  A lot of what he says about men my husband does.  I really had a good laugh.,1355443200,,97,3.3636363636363638

2194396,5,B0006SSPBC,"A must see & own DVD. I have watched it probably 6 times with different people.
Weather you are 15 or 70 I think you will have a great laugh.",1269561600,,141,3.7333333333333334
2194397,5,B0006SSPBC,"I have seen the play four times live, and watch the video a dozen times and I still can not stop laughing. This maybe the funniest 90 minutes you will ever spend.",1255305600,,162,4.09375
2194398,4,B0006SSPBC,"I saw him perform this in Utah a few years ago. It was absolutely hilarious (the guys were laughing as much as the girls).
I was happy to find the video on Amazon.com. I Love It!!",1246492800,,179,4.0

2194400,5,B0006SSPBC,"Robert Dubac is a genius when it comes to describing the ""male intellect"". A ""must see"" for anyone wanting a good laugh.",1225497600,,120,4.5
2194401,5,B0006SSPBC,"One of my all time favorite comedy DVD's. It's a great one man show that pokes fun at the genders, how they think, communicate and interact with the one another.",1223596800,,161,4.4
2194402,5,B0006SSPBC,"Inside The Male Intellect is a playful romp through the male psyche while it deals with the differences between male and female perceptions.  Bob Dubac displays a ""presence"" that I believe professors and educators could do well to emulate.  For instance, if he were my English teacher, this review would make more sense.

His generous use of stylized characters and props work well to get his view across to the audience.

A fine bit of entertainment with a touch of adult language and gestures.",1220313600,,495,4.857142857142857
2194403,5,B0006SSPBC,"This is one of the funniest comedy acts I have ever seen. There is some foul language, but mild compared to others. I bought a copy for everybody I know.",1210723200,,153,4.133333333333334

2194405,5,B0006SSPBC,I saw this show live in Poway and laughed so hard.  My friends and I wanted a video to see him again.  It's one of the funniest shows I have ever seen.  Looking forward to the second installment he is creating!,1203984000,,210,4.073170731707317
2194406,5,B0006SSPBC,"Very funny, I wish I would get it back from all the people I have lent it to, so I can watch it again!  I saw Robert's second show in Denver last month and so I was very happy that some of that material was in the first show as well.",1189641600,,233,3.5686274509803924
2194407,5,B0006SSPBC,"In an age when there is increasingly little to laugh about, ""Inside the Male Intellect"" is a shining star--5 of them, in fact.  I heartily recommend this DVD.  And be sure to catch Robert Dubac's shows LIVE, if you can.

2194408,5,B0006SSPBC,Bob Dubac has created an hysterically funny review of the male intellect and how males think.  His creativity here is unmatched.  This is a laugh-out-loud DVD.,1161734400,,159,5.076923076923077
2194409,5,B0006SSPBC,"I saw the show when in Los Angeles last year.  Laughed so much.  I was so excited, but a little hesitant when I found the DVD...could it possibly be as good as the live show???? Absolutely WAS!  I watched it last week with a friend that had never seen the show before...we laughed so much.  The DVD is outstanding.  I am giving to all my friends for Christmas!",1132531200,4,360,4.235294117647059
2194410,5,B0006SSPBC,"I was at this taping (Phoenix, AZ) and we were told that it would air on either Comedy Central or Showtime.  I kept checking to see when it would air so I can set my DVR to record it.  It never aired.  Last thing I heard was that there was a problem with contracts.  I gave up on it because I never thought it would see the light of day.  Boy was I shocked when I just checked Robert's website and saw it was for sale.  Rushed right out and got it.

Laughed just like it was the first time I saw it.  I saw it twice live (within 2 weeks of each other) and now on DVD.  This is such a great show.  The second time we brought family and they loved it (they are in their 50s), I'm 28.  This show has profanity, so it's not for everyone, but the lucky people who get to see it will laugh so hard their ribs will hurt.  The only bad thing I have to say (which is nothing) is that I wish he had more impromptus.  At the second show, there was a guy who went to the bathroom, and his coworker went two minutes later.  Robert decided to stop the show and start making fun of the two guys (who were part of a group of eight coworkers.)  That went on for like five to tem minutes.  Just hilarious!  I'm not blaming this DVD or Robert for not having a camera at all times.  One of the outtakes was from this show also.  The guy was laughing so hard.  He did this show two was, censored and uncensored.  Both are hilarious, and obviously this is the uncensored version.  Great job Robert!!!",1124064000,3,1478,3.98972602739726
2194411,5,B0006SSPBC,"I have seen Robert's play in person and it is HIGHLY entertaining.  Both men and women can enjoy this and laugh at themselves, as well as at each other, and you will.  He puts a very very personable spin on relationships and the differences between the two sexes.  You've heard the differences before, but not like this.  Robert SHOWS you what's in the male mind and why it works the way it does.  Anyone who has ever seen his play has wanted it on DVD and now we have our request.

If you don't laugh and find yourself nodding your head throughout the play, then you weren't paying attention at all.",1111449600,9,600,4.36036036036036
8042954,5,B0006SSPBC,"Absolutely Hilarious!  I have also seen Robert Dubac live in Sarasota, Florida.  Would recommend this to anyone that has a great sense of humor.  You get to see if your partner,  male or female can handle jokes about their gender.",1496966400,,230,4.675
8042955,5,B0006SSPBC,"I love this show. Robert's performance is second to none.  I think every couple should see this, it answers the most asked questions about relationships and you'll laugh when you hear the answers.",1477353600,,196,4.9393939393939394
8042956,5,B0006SSPBC,Robert DuBac is hilarious!  We watched this video with some friends while on vacation and everyone of us laughed until we cried - men and women alike.  Definitely recommend this video (not for children).,1471478400,,203,4.9411764705882355

8042960,5,B0006SSPBC,"It's not a sexist thing at all, doens't rag on either men or women, but it talkes about quirks that are present in the both of us. You'll laugh.",1400025600,,144,4.0
8042961,5,B0006SSPBC,Dubac weaves the popularly held stereotypes of men and women's behavior in a humorous narrative. He dissects them and then reconstructs them  at the end in a way that you don't expect. I saw Dubac live and this DVD captures his performance very well. I bought this DVD for my friends to see and they all LOVED IT.,1398902400,,313,4.396551724137931
