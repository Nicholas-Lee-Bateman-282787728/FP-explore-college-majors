7872595,5,630446813X,"This is a very nicely done documentary on humans, and how they relate to their dogs.  The stories run the gamut from touching, to funny, and everything in between.  I recently bought this DVD since our VHS copy gets so much play that I was afraid it will wear out soon.

We have a family member with special needs who is enthralled with dogs, so instead of watching ""Soccer Dog"" for the umpteenth time, it's refreshing to watch this documentary that never seems to get old.",1272067200,,473,4.476744186046512

We have watched it many times over and I have bought other copies to give to my dog-loving family and friends. Just wonderful!,1168819200,,284,4.480769230769231
7872597,5,630446813X,"This documetary takes a look at the various relationships that people have with dogs, from owners, to breeders, to business owners that cater to pets and their owners.  The stories are heartwarming and often times funny.  I had caught the last half of this on TV while on the road for business, and was so entertained that I decided to purchase it when I got back.  Various family members who visit request to watch this so often that I'm hoping to find it on DVD, because my VHS tape is near to wearing out.  A must-see for any animal lover or anyone that owns a pet.",1165190400,,568,4.330188679245283
