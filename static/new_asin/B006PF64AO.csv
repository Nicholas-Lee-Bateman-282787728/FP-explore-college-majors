5012479,5,B006PF64AO,"Even though this CD/DVD does not come out until February, it so worth the wait.  I own everything this group has ever done and have watched them since they first appeared in 2007.  These lads can't do anything that isn't absolutely wonderful.  I have seen three of their shows in person and it was the most amazing,most breath taking performance I have ever seen.  I am anxiously awaiting the release of Voyage.  The harmony, the talent and the obvious friendship and respect the entire crew show for one another is one thing that makes Celtic Thunder should a unique experience.",1325980800,16,579,4.75
5012480,5,B006PF64AO,"Even though this isn't due out until next month (FYI, it'll be a GREAT Valentine's Day this year!), I saw this show in October, was completely blown away and I've been anxiously awaiting it's release!  I've seen a show on every tour, have all the CDs & DVDs and have even met a few of the lads and I have to admit that in seeing this last show I was a little skeptical.  It was the first time I would be seeing them with the new line-up (Emmet in for Paul and Daniel in for Damian) and I just wasn't sure it would live up to the original sound...I could not have been more wrong!  It was utterly fantastic!  So much so, that I tried to get in to another show just to see them again and bring my Mom.  However, I/we realized that that was a bit obsessive and we couldn't justify the costs of tickets/hotels/flights so we've been waiting for it to come out on DVD where we'll get a front row seat as many times as we want!  They do so many great traditional Irish tunes and some surprising covers of country & Elton John songs.  If you're a fan or just love good music and lovely eye candy GET THIS DVD and enjoy!",1325462400,96,1111,4.092165898617512

This is an edition that still features George Donaldson and it's a treat to see this gentle man who passed way too soon. Each of the members is featured and two of my favorite songs on the CD are ""Galway Girl"" and ""Ride On."" Great music - beautifully staged and recorded.

5012524,5,B006PF64AO,"The best song ever sung by George is ""Scorn Not His Simplicity""  and is mentioned as being on the DVD but on the list of songs it does not show up-It is very unfair of PBS to take songs out of a show and then give you guys the bargain basement version-that beautiful song that is the CD and I wanted to give to several families I know with terminal young kids or even adults would have benefited them and also let people who do not realize how hard these kids and their caretakers have it. I have not been able to afford the DVD but it is on the CD.  Evidently unless you are rich and can afford 100-250 donations you should not get to enjoy the full show. Also wondering when you are going to be able to sell the current tour video they are doing now -A collection of older performances updated-saw it In Riverside, CA and loved it.  How much is the Voyage DVD esp if it has that wonderful song that George was so great at? Thank you.

However I was tickled pink to discover that the music CD by this same name does have one final song by him called Falling Slowly which shows the immense depth and feeling this artist has achieved!

5012572,5,B006PF64AO,"There are plenty of songs on you tube if you have never heard them before.  They are a group of men and each one has a beautiful voice and is great at what they do.

The first time I heard them sing was when they were on PBS and I was clicking through the channels on the tv - but I stopped as soon as I heard them sing.  I have been a devoted fan since that first song.  They have never disappointed me.  When you see them live or watch a DVD, you'll notice that the audience is from the young to the old and all points in-between.

I love the sound of their songs, I love the song selection, I love the production of each number ... they are just awesome.

If you have heard them before, you know you won't be disappointed with any of their CDs or DVDs.  If you have never heard them before, check them out and listen to a little clip or watch something on you tube - you won't be disappointed.  Then pick anything they have done and you will find yourself smiling or singing along ... or there may be a song or two that will bring a tear to your eye because it touched you.

This group never disappoints.",1397520000,,1107,4.013698630136986

This show is the first show where the individual performers are more interactive with the audience and you are allowed to see a less regimented performance. There are some recycled songs on the disc, as well as some new ones, but the fun is still there. The indiviual and ensemble performances are amazing, and the voices as usual are fabulous.

I only wish they'd avoid typical American songs like ""Over the rainbow"", even if the kid sings it perfectly. It has nothing to do with ""celtic"".",1364860800,,241,4.761904761904762

5012632,5,B006PF64AO,The lads truely enjoy themselves in this one. The music went from sweet to haunting to jolly and back again. I've never heard Danny Boy sung so well. The only fly in the ointment has to be that they still haven't worked out the mix on the instumental solos. The fiddle is so soft I had to assume that they didn't want anyone to hear it as the rest of the instuments were hearable for their solos. It definately  makes me want to acquire voyage 2 as it is a continuation of the voyage concert.,1361836800,,492,4.178947368421053
5012633,5,B006PF64AO,"I discovered Celtic Thunder on a reccomendation of ""All God's Creatures Have a Place in the Choir"".  Since that time I have purchased ALL of their DVD's, most of their CD;s, and when I was impatient, I downloaded from Youtube.  Like a teenaged groupee at the age of 72, I melt when I hear the voice of Ryan Kelly, the accent of George Donaldson, The ability of Keith Harkin, the harmony of the group together.  My favorite DVD is Heritage, but Voyage II is a very close second.  O.:K , I love them all.  I have recommended and loaned them to family and friends, encouraging them to purchase their own when they enjoy them as much as I do. I pre-ordered the Mythology DVD as soon as I heard it was available.  Disk #2 of this DVD was faulty when received, but I have been assured that a new disk is on it's way as I write this.  Were they worth the money?  YES!  YES! YES!",1361750400,2,871,4.198795180722891

5012648,4,B006PF64AO,"I first heard Celtic Thunder on a PBS Christmas special. All five have outstanding voices, each distinct. My own preference would be that they limit themselves to Irish music, enough exists for endless albums, but their producers opt to include several pop selections on each cd. Depending on my mood I either listen or skip ahead. They really excel at rollicking traditional Irish songs and the fact that different members of the group often sing individual stanzas gives their renditions a uniqueness that I personally greatly appreciate.",1356739200,,540,5.218390804597701

5012654,5,B006PF64AO,"This is one of Celtic Thunder's better DVD's.  It's a shame they didn't put the whole concert onto one DVD -- you need to purchase Voyage II to go with it to get the entire concert.  I saw them in this concert in person and it's all there.  Great songs, good fun.  Paul has been replaced by Emmet -- my wife prefers Paul's more operatic voice; I like Emmet's more pure Irish tenor voice.  Damian has been replaced by Daniel -- and both agree he's cute and has a good voice, but not nearly as good as Damian had when he was younger.  But the songs are good, the show is a lot of fun, and I believe you would thoroughly enjoy this concert over some of their past ones.",1355875200,,666,4.084615384615384

These are very soothing for the residents.  I actually wrote to Celtic Thunder to see if they could stop by the nursing home because I knew they were going to be in Illinois for their concert.  Unfortunately, they never responded.  The staff and residents enjoy watching all the dvds and listening to all the cds immensely.

5012668,1,B006PF64AO,It's a great video if you like lip-sinking. The stage was adorn with lame decorations like you would find at a school concert. Anything to distract you from the shallow voiced Irish man/boys. Obvious lip-sinking going on. The voices sound like they are coming from the radio in a car with no background music in it. With a small live orchestra and some children. The audience even seemed a little fake as they seemed too excited for such a lack of talent.,1348358400,,455,4.560975609756097

Anyone who has viewed ""Its Entertainment "" or  ""Heritage"" can see those were great as compared to this boring video. I really missed the Kilts
and there wasn't much from the drums or from the multitalented person that also played the bagpipes. Storm was also a disappointment to
me as the format just didn't seem like Celtic Thunder. I currantly have all of their DVDs and have purchased all of them from amazon.
I have no complaints on the quality of the DVDs. Perhaps the people that have found fault with the quality can blame it on their machine. My
DVD player was very expensive so I expected good quality. The first video put out by Celtic Thunder was also very good The producers of these shows need to know that Celtic Thunder is the sum of its parts. While the singers are great they are after all just part of what makes these DVDs so
successful. It takes all of the band and as I said before, the drums , the bagpipes, the picalo and the girls playing the violins. Yhe fun that they have making these shows and the hi-jinx. Without all of these things they are juat another group.",1335744000,,1218,4.389380530973451

Don't believe anyone who tells you they have the dvd of the pbs show. The only way to get that is to burn the show off of tv onto a dvd. It isn't released.

I bought Voyage because it's supposed to have the same type of music as in Heritage - and it does - for the most part.  I was leary of the two new people (Emmet and Daniel) but found them really enjoyable and - though I still miss Paul and Damian - think they are a great addition.

I am a little disappointed that there are several songs on this album that are on other albums: Ride On, Black is the Color, The Dutchman, Lagan Song.  Those are on albums that I have.  I don't know if there are more that are on other albums.  I really like those songs but would like to hear different songs. I know they don't put the whole show on the DVD so there must be other new songs that could be on the DVD instead of repeats.  It's fine to have them in the show as people like to hear their favorites, but on DVD's we want as many different songs as we can get.

All in all it's a good album.  I do like the new songs a lot.  I just wish they'd change the format and put different songs on each DVD and stop showing so much of the audience.  Who wants to see them!!??  I bought the album to see Celtic Thunder!!!  I can't afford to go to their live shows so this is the best I get.  Make it worthwhile!!!!",1332720000,,1271,3.972332015810277

5012714,4,B006PF64AO,"A few observations are in order regarding the new Celtic Thunder ""Voyage"" DVD and CD.

The DVD release that came out at the end of February 2012 is just Part 1.  Part 2 will come out in the fall of 2012 with the rest of the songs from the concert.  Why not just make it a 2-disc set?  Well, check out Sharon Browne's blog on the Celtic Thunder web site.  Sorry I can't put the link here.  I tried twice, and apparently Amazon blocks that sort of thing, so just Google ""Sharon Browne blog"", and it will show up at the top of the list of choices.  Then look for her blog comments titled ""VOYAGE - DVD's vs TV show - March 14, 2012"".  There she gives a full explanation of what's going on.  It has to do with copyright law.  She mentioned keeping DVDs at about an hour in length to avoid problems.  She also said that a standard USA CD is 12 songs as compared to 16 in Europe.  I guess they can have more than the standard 12 cuts, as evidenced by the fact that all of their CDs to date have more than 12 cuts.

Final observations:

(1)  As I was watching the PBS airing of Voyage, I heard The Irish Rover (part of a medley?), but it doesn't appear to be on the new Voyage CD that I just sampled on Amazon.  George also sang Red Rose Cafe on the Voyage PBS show, but that song is not on the Voyage CD.  However, it is on the Heritage CD (but not the Heritage DVD), which leads to my next comment.

(2)  It is a confusing and very annoying practice that songs missing from a particular Celtic Thunder DVD may appear on either a past or a future CD of a different title.  The same is true regarding songs missing from a CD appearing on another DVD.  The only way to get all the songs in both formats is to just buy all the CDs and all the DVDs.  It would be far better if the DVD and CD for a particular show would have the same track list.  No more hunting around trying to find what you're missing.

(3)  As for the repeated songs, at least they are not forgetting all their songs from previous releases just because they have a new show.  If every project was nothing but all-new songs, then you'd never hear any variety of their new and old together in the same show.  Of course, the trick with repeating songs is to choose the right ones and not to overdo it.  I'm sure they get a lot of comments from fans about this sort of thing.  If you think Voyage is too full of repeats, then check out the Take Me Home DVD.  Of 29 songs, 19 are from The Show, their first DVD, leaving only 10 new ones.  Maybe that was due to that copyright issue?  Only 10 new songs, hmmm.

4)  Except for ""The Show"" DVD, the ""Take Me Home"" DVD, and the two-part ""Voyage"" DVDs, all the other DVDs (It's Entertainment, Heritage, Christmas, Storm) have been close to that one-hour mark that Sharon Browne was speaking of in her blog.  This makes me wonder what we're missing from the actual concerts of these other DVDs.  I don't know myself since I have only seen the original ""The Show"" in concert.  I wonder if they sing some of their previous songs, or whether they are just plainly leaving out new songs from both the DVD and CD, though that would be a completely pointless action.  Why create new concert material and then refuse to release a lot of it on DVD and CD?  If anyone has insightful information, please share it with us.  Thanks.",1331424000,15,3319,4.165354330708661
5012715,5,B006PF64AO,"I've read previously-posted negative reviews and offer a clarifying viewpoint.  Someone took issue with use of the terms Celtic and Thunder, and said there were neither in Voyage.  Their now-global audience knows that in their 4+ years of existence, Celtic Thunder has become a musical phenomenon, a ""brand"" in its own right, transcending the title words in isolation and denoting the unique quality of its musical performances.  Five soloists from different genres not only demonstrate their own vocal specialties but come together in a harmonic convergence some have attributed to ""a wee bit of magic.""

As for Voyage, specifically, it has remained true to the original Celtic Thunder formula:  songs of Celtic history and culture, Irish pub songs, music by eminent Celtic composers and songwriters, samples of each genre represented by the soloists (from modern folk-rock to light classics to Billboard hits) and an occasional novelty song.  Every number, whether new or a repeated favorite requested by fans, is performed by Celtic musicians with impeccable musicianship.

Celtic Thunder Voyage has just debuted at #1 on the Worldwide Billboard chart, as has every CT release before it.  ""Celtic Thunder"" is not an adjective-noun phrase to be read literally, but an international symbol of excellence in musical entertainment.",1331424000,2,1330,5.422330097087379

Celtic Thunder definitely has gone down a few rungs. What a shame.  As another reviewer stated.  The fans were absolutely cheated with this DVD!",1331337600,6,649,4.289256198347108
5012720,4,B006PF64AO,"I really wish they'd let Ryan sing MoonDance on the DVD.  I didn't enjoy this DVD as much as the first two and the Christmas one, still good entertainment and worth purchasing!",1331337600,2,176,4.5
5012721,4,B006PF64AO,"First, I will say I've enjoyed all the Celtic Thunder DVD's.  I love these guys.  The shows are terrific.  Unfortunately, I had the chance to see the Voyage show on local PBS station and was a little disappointed that there were several songs and scenes that were left out of the DVD.  I know they can't show it all, but some of these songs were priceless.  All in all, I will still keep getting the DVD's even though they might not be the whole show.  Well worth watching.",1331164800,,473,4.318181818181818
5012722,5,B006PF64AO,"I believe this is the best work yet by Celtic Thunder. True, there are a couple of songs that have been done before. However, nobody seems to complain about the fact that Ireland's Call appears in every show. Young Daniel Furlong is a shining star. I'm very happy to see that Neil is given more chance to showcase his vocal talents. Emmet is doing a wonderful job of filling Paul Byrom's shoes, not an easy task for a lad who just turned 21 on the day this DVD was filmed. I hope this ensemble is around for a long time.",1331164800,,520,4.21
5012723,5,B006PF64AO,"I just got the DVD of Voyage and it is Celtic Thunder's best show yet!  They do a mix of Irish and American songs and a couple of comedy numbers.  Neil's much more confident in this show now that he is a full member of the group.  Emmett makes you forget there ever was a Paul.  His rendition of ""Isle of Hope Isle of Tears"" moved me to tears.  I think Emmett works better than Paul because he is an Irish tenor rather than a tenor/soprano as Paul is.  There were many songs that Paul just couldn't do bcause his voice wasn't right for them.  Daniel is so cute!  He is treated by the group as their little brother and they tease him on the stage.  Their first number is in Gaelic which makes you at first wonder where this show is going, but it is beautifully done.

My only complaint is that the band has changed again!  The only original band memebers are the drummer and the whistle player who was in ""Act 2.""  The pianist is new as are all of the string memebers.  This band to me doesn't seem to have the energy and enthusiasm that the band from ""Heritage"" had.

That is a small complaint, however.  Be sure and add this DVD to your Celtic Thunder library.  You'll be glad you did.",1331164800,,1186,4.18141592920354
5012724,4,B006PF64AO,"I enjoyed the DVD, but I really miss Damien McGinty.  I realize he is starring on Glee! these days, but I don't watch that show.  Was delighted to see Neil in more prominent singing roles.  Love his voice and he is such an
amazing musician! Always good to see Ryan, Keith and George...BUT Come back, Damien!",1330992000,2,307,4.446428571428571

5012726,4,B006PF64AO,"Overall a great video, and a HUGE improvement over the last video, ""Storm."" The DVD does fall short in including so many repeats of songs that appeared on prior videos, albeit slightly different arrangements. We own every single prior Celtic Thunder video, and as much as we love Keith and Ryan we would have preferred some of the newer performances instead, and certainly more than one solo performance by the multi-talented Neil.  We actually saw this concert in person a few months ago and there were so many other performances of different songs that could have been included.  Another major flaw is that the DVD should have included Ireland's Call at the end, as this is their trademark song and one that we want to see repeated.  It's fun to see how the performance of Ireland's Call has changed over the years with Damian growing up and members changing, and it's the one song you must have when watching Celtic Thunder!  Having said that, the DVD is still great to watch and one we'd highly recommend! Damian has always been our all time favorite so we weren't sure how CT would be after he and Paul left. It's really great to see Neil at the forefront, he has a beautiful voice and we've always wanted to see more of him based on his past performances and role as a backup singer and guitarist for the group. He's finally a main member, and well deserves the position.  We were very sad when the group members changed and I was prepared not to like Emmet's voice, but he has proven that he has an amazing, beautiful voice. His two solo performances are so moving. Keith did a wonderful job showcasing his original material and he's always so entertaining and a favorite. Ryan and George's performances just seem to get better and better.  Daniel, unfortunately, doesn't add much to the group and his voice is too high and doesn't blend well with the rest of the guys, although his performance in the ""Irish Rover"" medley is a lot of fun and the song is very catchy. ""Voyage"" is entertaining and a good affirmation that the group is still very strong and talented.  A wise turnaround from the previous ""Storm"" video (which we couldn't even bear to watch through once despite how much we love this group), we will be watching this one over and over! If it weren't for the repeated songs, I would've given this a solid 5 stars!",1330905600,,2333,4.580335731414868
5012727,3,B006PF64AO,"Spoiler alert....if you enjoy watching Celtic Thunder perform ""Ireland"" at the finale (as I do) you won't see it on this DVD. Someone in their questionable wisdom decided to run the credits during the performance so that you only hear the performance but don't see it. Has some very nice new material especially by Neil and Emmett. I have been to a Celtic Thunder concert and know there had to have been much more material from which to choose that didn't make the cut for this DVD. I sure wish they had included some of those instead...""Girls, girls, girls"" Really?? I like my ""Heritage"" DVD much better.",1330819200,3,605,4.663551401869159

One huge disappointment at the end of ""Voyage"":  Ireland's Call was played during the closing credits.  We didn't get to see The Lads singing their signature song in their kilts.

George Donaldson
Ryan Kelly
Neil Byrne
Keith Harkin

Two have left the group and are not in this concert.
Paul Byrum
Damian McGinty

One new singer has been added.
Emmett Cahill

And there is one special guest singer who is very young and extremely talented.
Daniel Furlong

~~~

The first song is in Latin, the second song is in Irish, and the fifth song is a jig.  All the rest is in English, with at least one performed in an older, but clearly understandable, form of English.  It's a very nice concert, but it's edited to last about 56 minutes, so it's a little short and it felt a little incomplete and truncated.  I would have loved to see and hear a few more songs, especially from Mr. Donaldson.

[Update: March 12, 2012]

[Other reviewers have compared the DVD to the PBS special.  I watched Boston's PBS special a couple of days ago, and the PBS concert does contain quite a few more songs than the DVD. Plus, the TV special was in high definition with excellent sound and much better picture quality in comparison to the DVD. Still, the DVD looks and sounds good and I enjoyed it.]",1330732800,43,1629,4.35

One of which this is the THIRD time it's been on dvd (Ride On)  I know people wanted to see some oldies in the concerts, but not on the dvd, we can just rewatch it!!  Where was ""Youve got a friend me""?  ""Moondance""?  ""7 Drunken Nights""!?!? Was very upset it was edited this way, you can bet that'll all be on *another* dvd we can purchase of course!

The guys are of course great, but the decisions on the producton team are what's a disappointment.",1330646400,15,556,4.149532710280374

Wonderful new songs as well as a couple older ones that was great to see back on the DVD. Ryan singing 'Ride On' never gets old.

For new or old fans, Voyage is a great buy and the only thing better than this would be to see them in person. My only regret is that it didn't show them singing 'Ireland'.",1330560000,2,482,3.9587628865979383

5012733,3,B006PF64AO,"An entertaining DVD, but somewhat disappointed with 3 performances that are on previous DVD's. I would have given 4 stars if there had been 3 new songs, not ""re-runs""!
Why not chose a different song than ""Over the Rainbow"" (it's been done, done, done) for the youngest singer, Daniel Furlong. Neil's performances shine in this DVD, George played less of a role, Keith sings the Dutchman again (but well) and a new upbeat song, Emmet has a fine young voice, Ryan sings two songs done before (""Black is the Color"" and ""Ride On"").
Was this production put together quickly?
What was it lacking?
Fresh material. More performances as a group.
3/6 Two more repeats - I don't have The Storm DVD, but have learned that ""Lagan Love"", was performed previously on Storm and ""Galway Girl"" on a previous CD. So, while I enjoy the group, it really seems a disservice to their fans by promoting new product that isn't, well...new product.",1330560000,25,922,4.732919254658385
5012734,3,B006PF64AO,"My DVD was preordered from the CT site in IE, and it arrived today.  I have all of the rest of their releases in my collection; most of those will get many more re-plays.  This one may not.  The members of the band have all been replaced, with the exception of the drummer and the one guitar player who doubles at singing some songs.  The members of the cast are slightly different, in that Damian has been replaced by a youngster who is about in the 7th grade or so, and his voice has yet to change from soprano.  The operatic voice of Paul has been replaced by a young man who is a tenor, but of no great merit.  Several of the songs on this DVD are retreads, sung by the same singers on earlier discs.  The DVD includes a special file of extra material, such as backstage and rehearsal stuff.  It includes outtakes of what we are to presume is this show, but these include songs that are not part of the collection on the DVD.  I'll continue to follow the progress of this group, but I was disappointed in this DVD.  BTW, I was also disappointed, and for the same reasons, in the latest release of the DVD entitled BELIEVE from Celtic Woman.",1330473600,4,1144,4.25462962962963

I have each of their CD's and DVD's so I can re-live the experience....Emmet Cahill is an incredible addition, Daniel Furlong was a delight to hear and see...so cute with Keith and the guys on stage, the kid holds his own, and Neil has stepped up as a vocalist.  All in all, they are an immensely talented group.  Most of us are following Paul and Damian as they have gone off on solo careers.  One last thing I love about this music, is that you can sing along with it.  Their ensemble works are just beautiful.",1330473600,2,693,4.409448818897638

5012737,5,B006PF64AO,"If you've heard them once, you can't help but become a fan for life!  We saw CT here in Houston in November, 2011 - my husband's first time - and I'd wondered whether the loss of two original members, Paul and Damian, would affect the sound of the group because both were strong vocally.  Within the first minute of their first ensemble offering, the truth was told...if anything, the mix is even better than before.  Truth be told, it's difficult to even compare each of them with their predecessor.  Daniel's so young and his voice is so pure, it's hard to recall when Damian was that age (he's now a cast member of Fox's hit show, ""Glee"" and has been nominated for an award as Outstanding Young Performer.  Paul Byrum is a classically-trained tenor and is now performing in his first solo tour (although Damian and other CT members have been known to pop in and join him occasionally.)  Emmett's pure Irish tenor is amazing and I'm looking forward to hearing the songs he did so well here in Houston.

Don't mistake this for a group of Irish Musicians doing typically Irish music because while you won't be disappointed, what they provide is so much more.  I've ordered both the DVD and CD because there are usually significant differences with both.  As an added treat, Damian McGinty cut a ""farewell"" number for all his fans in case he was chosen for Glee - I'm anxious to hear him.  Daniel is now a ""Guest Artist"" with CT, but I truly hope that he'll become a regular very soon.  Hope y'all will enjoy these as much as I know that I will.  Until then, it's like waiting for the mail to bring a lovely gift, one I've been waiting for for a long time!",1329177600,6,1655,4.443708609271523
5012738,5,B006PF64AO,"GO TO THE ""VOYAGE"" AUDIO CD LISTING WHERE THERE'S A 3-MINUTE-LONG PREVIEW OF THIS DVD !!!
Based on that preview, I have to say that this DVD is an outstanding piece of work !!!

We saw CT live here in Michigan in December, and they performed many of these pieces in conjunction with their Christmas Show. Even with their new lineup, they're still a great group, the gold standard of Celtic pop! In live performance, the loss of Damian McGinty's baritone voice was distinctly noticeable, essentially leaving George to cover the low range all by himself. Pure and simple, they need another baritone post haste. The audio production on this DVD stunningly balances the group's sound back into what I would call ""the classic CT sound"" of the past few years and effectively covers up the ""too many tenors"" issue.

Finally, it seems to me that CT is working with a considerably smaller group of background instrumentalists, which also thinned out the group's sound in live performance. Again, the superior audio production on the DVD makes the instrumental background sound solid.

Bottom line: I believe that this DVD sounds better than CT's live performance.",1327881600,6,1154,4.938144329896907

They always tape the DVDs in front of a live audience, and that audience is always blown away by the power and intensity of the experience.

I do have all the others, and when I think it doesn't get better - it does, year after year.  These men meld ever more closely as a harmonic group, and the solo performances reveal more and more of the talent and gift of each one.  Although 2 members of the original 5 have moved on in their professional lives, the men who now make up Celtic Thunder cannot be viewed as ""replacements.""  As in the original show, each one has unique style, standout ability, and if there ever was a case where the whole is much greater than the sum of the parts, this is it.
