4312037,5,B004AUP3F8,"""Joan Rivers: A Piece of Work"" is thoroughly enjoying.  She has always been outrageous and I knew what to expect.  I got what I wanted - a time to laugh and cry and sometimes do both at the same time.  Joan is not only a genius, but amazing in her drive and fantastic comedic timing.  She thinks on her feet and not only has the guts to say what people keep deep into their psyches, she brazenly lets us look and laugh and not be afraid to peek at life's unfairness.  Joan is a fascinating woman, who knows what she wants -she works constantly at 77, keeps herself on the go - I was tired watching her hectic schedule.  Joan does not feel alive unless she is working - and she will work anywhere at anytime.  Although she complained of not saving money for her old age, she makes plenty and spends it freely on herself and others. Her generosity to staff and thoughtful Thanksgiving dinner belie her unrelenting drive to support a lush lifestyle.  She is a workaholic and has kept her brain from ""rusting"" out, but may ""wear out""  by constant travel, gigs, writing material, and never stopping trying new venues.  Her plastic surgeries and botox injections are discussed as a matter of course and are part of the show business routine she accepts. At the beginning we see her without makeup, and as she is painted up and prepped it is amazing a 77 year old can look that good.  She is not afraid to bare her feelings (she give background on leaving Johnny Carson show and her husband's suicide), her foibles (Am I a Diva? All comediennes are angry?)  and keeps hacking away at ""sacred cows"" so we may laugh with her on life in blasphemous joy - it is nothing but cathartic.

Joan is exquisitely complex, smart (reads voraciously), honest, generous, kind and anything but ordinary.  What a joy it is to see her full throttle on the big screen.",1277942400,47,1842,4.459701492537313
4312038,5,B004AUP3F8,"This film will change the way you see Joan Rivers.  Very intimate, insider view into her life, showing her on and off stage personality and everything in between.  I respected her before - respect her even more now after having watched this film.  Definitely recommend.",1471392000,,269,4.933333333333334
4312039,4,B004AUP3F8,Thx,1469232000,,3,3.0
4312040,1,B004AUP3F8,I had tried to read her book I hate everyone starting with myself. It was so horrible I threw it in the trash after the first 20%. She died a couple months later and I  was very sad about that and decided to give her work another chance. It was once again vulgar and embarrassing to even be spending time trying to find something good to say about it. This went into the trash also after 20 minutes,1467936000,,398,4.102564102564102
4312041,5,B004AUP3F8,"I enjoyed seeing what her normal days were like and how driven she was. She was very sensitive about what people thought of her act. The older I got, the more I liked her.

4312068,5,B004AUP3F8,"This will, if nothing else, give you a deep appreciation of Joan Rivers - very hard-working, uncompromising in her art, funnier than hell, courageous and excruciatingly smart.

4312072,5,B004AUP3F8,"This documentary shines a light on a woman who was exactly what the title says: A Piece of Work. Joan Rivers was vulnerable (Who knew?)! She had stamina enough for a dozen men, ultra-strong work force, aside from a super-quick mind. A woman who made many of her dreams come true by shear force of her humor (that, at times, was tasteless). But what an interesting creature. The blu-ray or DVD could have come with more extra material, I have to say.",1430352000,,449,4.487804878048781

4312075,5,B004AUP3F8,"I saw this in the Theater, now I watched it again on Amazon. What an incredible woman - she knew the secret for transcending pain and sorrow - to LAUGH! - about anything and everything. This film captures her in her hilarity; it also captures her humanity and vulnerability splendidly. I adored her; I'll be up front - she spoke to the ugly duckling outsider in so many of us; and most of all, the need to be loved. If you like her at all, or are undecided, watch this; you'll find a kindness there you never expected, such as her bringing meals to people with AIDS. Watching this again this time has been a bittersweet experience; while the jokes are still good, knowing now that she is gone makes me terribly sad. She was the youngest 81 I have ever seen, she had at least 10 or 15 more years at the top, which is where she was when she passed. She was up to the minute current. RIP, Great One.",1427328000,,896,4.215116279069767

4312087,5,B004AUP3F8,"Hilarious! I downloaded this book right before I was wheeled in for hip replacement surgery -- literally. The last thing I remember was telling the CRNAs about it. The thing with River's books is that I have to read them in small doses -- otherwise I feel like I'm being hit over the head. It was ideal to stretch out during a three-day hospital stay. Contemporary, but not for the faint of heart.",1424908800,,397,4.4520547945205475

4312099,5,B004AUP3F8,"Joan Rivers is gone but will never be forgotten, and this documentary is an important part of her legacy.  It is both hilarious and poignant, a testament to a truly original and absolutely unforgettable woman who was one of the first female comedians in an arena that had always been dominated by men.  If this documentary does not tickle your funny-bone and touch your heart, then you should - in the words of the indomitable Miss Rivers - ""grow up!""

4312113,5,B004AUP3F8,"Yup, she really is!

This documentary, shot during her 75th year, includes lots of archival footage (Johnny Carson, Phyllis Diller, Kathy Griffin, Don Rickles, Donald Trump, etc.), plus lots of our eponymous comedienne kvetching about how poor she is, how desperate she is to work and how many people depend on her for steady employment.

Her New York City apartment is a stunner. She describes it as a place where Marie Antoinette would live ...if she had money... Lots of crystal chandeliers, Louis XV gilt furniture, art work, and glassware.

As you might expect, she gets a lot of mileage out of her age, her plastic surgery and her husband's suicide, while we get a peek at her relationship with her daughter Melissa and her grandson, in whom her sun rises and sets.

Suffice it to say, we see an extremely driven, hard-working woman who keeps killer hours, travels incessantly and is frantic to land her next job. No gig is beneath her, and in her opinion, she is never quite good enough.

Be prepared for raunchy comedy, lots of expletives and nothing bleeped out!",1417478400,,1071,4.767567567567568

Everything she had she worked for.  The Joan on stage was over the top funny and bawdy, underneath she was funny and kind.

I have been a fan of Joan Rivers from the time she was first on Johnny Carson's show and have watched her every chance I had. Like Judge Judy, Joan Rivers says what others do/can not. On top of that, Joan is so funny. This doc was made when she was 75; few people much younger than her would be able to keep up with her schedule. It is sad that we lost two of the my favorite  comics in such a short time--first Robin Williams and then Joan Rivers--both were my favorites and both gave me years of laughter. My life is a little darker without the Joan Rivers and Robin Williams.

4312213,4,B004AUP3F8,"I have mixed feelings about Joan Rivers.  She started out as kind of the fresh (and slightly) provocative girl in TV and then as she got older, her comedy grew more crass and mean-spirited.  This movie gives a sympathetic look at the comedienne and I thought it was taut, moving, unsentimental, and unvarnished.  It blew the cover off of Joan Rivers as brash comedienne and exposed a vulnerable and extraordinarily hard-working woman.  I couldn't take my eyes off the film.

4312221,5,B004AUP3F8,"This is particularly poignant because I watched it after she died so the sadness felt was huge.  However, beyond that this was a brilliant video because Joan takes you places so personal it's rare any celebrity or anyone at all for that matter would let you even peek in much less get the whole story.  I have come to realize that brilliance can certainly breed insecurity and Joan was both brilliant and insecure.  The highs were that much higher in this film because of the agonizing lows. And ultimately she made a dire prediction that she'd outlive all the great comedians however tragically this wasn't the case.  May she rest in peace..there were many tweets from a multitude of celebrities however Sarah Silverman said it best: MY HEART IS TORN IN HALF.  SHE WASN'T DONE.  And to me that sums it up.  This film is fascinating and goes by in a flash as it seemed her incredible life has also..she will be madly missed and I highly recommend this film.  There will always be haters; every icon has them.  However, Joan however harsh AND HILARIOUS she may have been in comedy behind the scenes she was a kind and generous person who meant so much to so many.",1410134400,,1162,4.548076923076923

4312228,5,B004AUP3F8,"On this day of Joan River's death, take an hour to watch her documentary. It is a record of  one year in her life . She shows us her true self, warts and all.

Much of what people say about  Joan is about the calibre of her jokes. She often said what we wanted to but didn't dare. I liked her. Her staff loved her. In this documentary we see her staff. The man and his wife who took care of her home, her many assistants, her financial people, her hair person, her make-up lady and on and on. Her manager is no longer with her. Truthfully he looked a little sleazy. However, what mattered the most to Joan was her daughter, Melissa and her grandson, Cooper. They will miss her immeasurably. She was beloved by many of her peers, and her work stands for itself. This documentary will be an eye opener for many who did not know her. She is a woman not to be taken lightly.

This year in her life is a wonderful sight. What struck me was her work schedule. She hated an empty page, to her it meant no one loved her. A full page if events made her happy. Flying from coast to coast, and all the little places in-between. She came from a loving home, but as we all know her husband committed suicide, and this was an issue for her and her daughter, Melissa. However, her success meant a lot to many. She put many of her staff's children through private school. Who does that?

A friend said that he can see Joan Rivers and Robin Williams wherever they are, laughing uproariously over each other's dirty jokes. A wonderful memory.

Saw Ms. Rivers in person in 2010 and the person who met with fans outside the stage door was very different from the powerhouse who commanded the stage for nearly two solid hours with her rauccous and irreverent humor. Outside of the theatre and outside of her onstage persona, Ms. Rivers was demure and polite as Audrey Hepburn might have been, accommodating every fans' request for photos and signatures for nearly an hour. I loved her before as the icon/diva; after that experience I appreciated her moreso for the person she is. Selfishly I hope she lives forever, or only as long as she wants to but she has to wait until after I do. Unique talent and person.",1408320000,3,729,4.53030303030303

Every bit she does has all been done by others.  She seems to think that using the F-word makes her seem younger when it just seems like a way to fill space and get a laugh reaction instead of actually saying something funny.  **SPOILER** During the course of the DVD she fires her manager giving the reason that she cannot get in touch with him.  Since this is filmed from her perspective that is the way it comes across in the film.  However, after searching on the Internet I read her manager's version (he sued her and received a settlement) and his reason had to do with a situation regarding Joan saving face on Donald Trump's Celebrity Apprentice show which sounded plausible.

4312246,5,B004AUP3F8,"Joan Rivers passed away on September 4th, 2014 and for every person who held her in the highest regard as myself, this came as an altogether shock. If we will all take the time to listen and laugh at all she added to our lives (in particular this honest Blu-ray of her life), I feel it would be a tribute to an unreplaceable woman, a star in her own right and a woman, mother and grandmother that gave our lives so much humor, joy, and laughter. ""A Piece of Work"" shows Ms. Rivers with all her personality, her helpful nature while visiting, and talking with people in New York City and the love and drive she had for life.  Joan Rivers was truly a pioneer for women in comedy and she will always be so missed.

""Can we talk?""... As Joan Rivers takes the stage in her own docudrama, you are immediately drawn into her private conversations.  She boldly starts confronting the issues presented in her life; the comedy and love of performance that defined her while she stared at the empty spaces on her calendar's booking schedule.  With an unshakable drive and a heavy focus on staying on top, Ms. Rivers gets right back into the game without batting an eye.

She is discussing her life here, letting us know how she got her big break.  That vehicle was 'The Tonight Show' Starring Johnny Carson.  She took the opportunity to blow away the audience with new and fresh comedy and a special intention towards women and issues that mainly went unsaid, until then.  She was brazen, honest, acerbic and so extremely funny that Carson promised her that she will ""Be a star"".  Her injected pieces of stand-up bits are unapologetically raw, irreverent and hysterical...I have viewed this so often and still find something even bolder than the previous time.

""All stand-ups are innately insecure"" adds her daughter, Melissa, to this discussion.  Joan got down to the real nitty-gritty here and completely targeted her own emotional vulnerability.  The issue is her husband's suicide, the crushing pain she was obviously still carrying, and her relationship with Melissa through all of this.  When asked if she is angry, she counters, ""If you're not angry about things then what are you talking about?"".

The ambitious workhorse that was Ms. Rivers would not tire.  The pacing of the documentary and her own life is consuming as she takes on a city after another city and a gig after another gig.  Joan asks for no apologies either, as another show is what drove her.

Altogether shocking, altogether real, altogether Joan's ""Piece of Work""...

A true trailblazer; she will never be replaced nor forgotten.",1365984000,6,2597,4.758928571428571

4312254,1,B004AUP3F8,"OMG. I used to LOVE Joan Rivers! That was, until she started making jokes about her husband's suicide. I dunno... maybe I'm just an old-fashioned fuddy-duddy kind of queen, but I don't find that to be in particularly good taste nor do I find it funny, regardless of the reasoning behind it. Go figure.

This documentary takes Joan to new lows--not because of the language (if foul language offends you, why are you even considering buying a Joan Rivers DVD???), but because it paints Rivers, who by now should be living extremely comfortably and fully contented, as a woman utterly desperate to continue making money so she can afford to keep her chachke-filled apartment in NYC. I mean, she looks for gigs the way a starving homeless person goes through the trash for a meal. She has an absolutely voracious need (not appetite--it is a psychological and financial NEED) to work, and she comes across as being insatiable and pathetic. I came to feel sorry for her (and, eventually, disgusted) when I actually thought I'd get some comic relief from this thing. (When she talks about her grandson, she shows her truly sensitive side. But that's only for about 5 minutes or so.)

I played this DVD once and then gave it away to Goodwill. I'm not sure it even rates 1 star (if you were expecting a comedy album). If you REALLY want to watch it, just wait. I'm pretty sure my copy will eventually end up in a thrift store near you...

That's not because it fawns over its titular star.  Rather, this is a warts-and-all production that concentrates not on the star but instead on the real person underneath.  As a result, we're privy to the tremendous work ethic that underpins Ms. Rivers decades-long stay in the public consciousness.  She simply outworks people.

Far from being someone to get on-stage and simply wing it, Rivers' shows are painstakingly compiled from a prodigious, indexed collection of jokes.  And, far from the idea of the comedian as the dark, lonely individual, Joan Rivers basically runs a small business.  I was struck by the image of her signing a stack of checks - this is her payroll.  Her indefatigable spirit keeps a small team of people gainfully and consistently employed.  She's quite transparent about the contributions from each of these individuals.  Though she's the leader of Team Rivers, it's a team effort nonetheless.  Eye-opening.

Though I'd seen 'Piece of Work' months ago, I was reminded yesterday to write this review when I read her 'By the Book' Q&A in the NY Times Book Review.  In this piece she quotes a staggering array of current and recent reads: Robert Caro's&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Passage-of-Power-The-Years-of-Lyndon-Johnson/dp/0679405070/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Passage of Power: The Years of Lyndon Johnson</a>; ""a four-volume history of English kings by Thomas B.

4312261,5,B004AUP3F8,"i liked this documentary a lot more than i thought i would.  although one would think that joan rivers with all of her plastic surgery is a woman denying the aging process, that is not true.  she was well aware she was 75 the year it was made.  she let the filmmakers be with her whenever they wanted to for a solid year.  it is evident that to this day she is a trooper who is going on and out on her own terms.  she considers show business a terrible business but all she ever wanted to be was on stage.  she lives for it and always has.

she even unflinchingly covers the time leading up to her husband's suicide. when one of her tv shows tanked, he couldn't handle it and killed himself. her daughter and grandson are also in the documentary and say whatever they like as well.  interestingly, her daughter says that although her mother did not want to compete with her when they were together on Trump's Celebrity Apprentice, she really doesn't think she can help herself.  she is always ON, always moving forward...literally, the show must go on.

this is also an excellent portrait of aging in the show business environment.  rivers manages it but few have her guts of steel to do it so unsparingly.

one fan makes thr mistake of heckling her at a stand up gig.  you really see what this woman is made of, she absolutely takes control and eviscerates him but in a way no one can complain about later. i guess if you do want to survive a show biz career long range, it would be better to be like rivers than unlike her.

4312262,5,B004AUP3F8,"i must admit that i have been a joan rivers fan from before i was in the womb. my favorite role that joan rivers ever played was a short appearance in the movie ""muppets take manhattan"" where she powdered and puffed herself and Kermit the Frog's love interest, Miss Piggy, behind a cosmetics counter (although neither one of them needed it). i was approximately six years old and smitten for life. considering that i am about her daughter's age, i felt like i was seeing my mom, or at least my super-star aunt, on the big screen. it was on that day that joan rivers clearly made an indelible memory in my mind. a memory that has surely lasted, and will continue to last, for a lifetime. i have closely followed her career ever since. who hasn't? aside from her past acting roles, i also admire her other current television endeavours such as ""Joan Knows Best"" (the second season will be on channel WE beginning January 24, 2012) or ""Fashion Police"" (channel E!). but, if i were to pick a favorite joan project, i have to say that i especially love to catch her jovial and recklessly funny self when she is on qvc selling her very high-quality fashion jewelry, apparel and accessories line. everything joan makes is a labour of love and work of art, and her products are of no exception. i urge you to, if nothing else, at least browse her qvc merchandise and watch her theatrical antics while she delivers what those in the business may refer to as sale ""pitches,"" but her regular qvc viewers see them as sincere and honest feedback on what is of the moment and current in retail. when joan speaks, on any topic, she speaks from the heart and the qvc viewers, including myself, know this. it is as though joan is talking directly to you and guiding you in a lesson of appropriate etiquette and class. what is amazing is that Joan Rivers does her qvc show appearances herself. if you are too poor to afford to see her live, or if you are a devotee of everything joan, i suggest viewing her qvc shows as they offer you a front-row seat into the mind of a self-made woman who also happens to be a world and well-bred socialite. i think that people tend to forget her upper-crust associations and classic taste because she is always doing ""something for a laugh."" That is where this documentary, ""Joan Rivers- A Piece of Work,"" separates itself from anything else that Joan Rivers has done in her career. as a die-hard Joan fan, i must admit that the perspective this film takes was initially slightly upsetting. i do not like to see a good-hearted, diligent, innovative, smart and applauded cultural icon suffering or being portrayed as living a hard, sometimes callous life. the film shares all of the hard-work, setbacks and disappoints that come with a challenging life in show business and beyond. i understand why the filmmakers did this and why Joan approved because once again Joan and her ""no-holds-barred"" attitude are always teaching. Joan teaches people how to laugh even at situations that would make the majority of people crumble. once again, it was painful to watch a beloved one facing life obstacles, but to talk about the pain and share it with others, especially someone like Joan who is at such a high level of fame and legendary notoriety, was difficult but in a way necessary. it is precisely Joan's candid openness and her humane desire to teach people and instruct them on how to laugh at both the good and the bad that life has to offer that makes her intriguing. Joan's desire to connect with people from all strata of life is a hard invitation to turn down. it is no accident that Joan is considered ""queen of the people."" and, it is obvious from her success that her audience would not have it any other way. from her legendary roast, where she was the one roasted (definitely not an easy role to assume), to her overly-generous philanthropic work, joan knows how to ""take it"" and how to ""give it back""- and to ""give it back"" the right way that satisfies everyone's funny bone in an acceptable way. nobody could have ever asked for such a wonderful, talented and popular queen. joan rivers absolutely leads by example. and, if we know what is good for us, we should all follow in her great footsteps. as those who watch joan's qvc shows know, it is tradition that an avant-garde joan robustly chants ""who brought this to you first?"" and all sing back a prideful cheer, ""you did joan!!!"" that is joan rivers- a pioneer, a survivor and most of all, a revered, beloved leader. joan rivers is a ""piece of work"" and no one would disagree, especially after watching this film.  go out and buy this dvd, it will be an investment that you'll never regret. go joan and never stop! we appreciate your continuing loyalty and faithfulness. the people love you dearly.",1325203200,,4780,4.590643274853801

4312264,2,B004AUP3F8,"Joan sums her philosophy and herself up nicely in the Thanksgiving speech here before her corralled guests, calling herself not only ""chosen"" but reminding the assembled that she has been riding in limousines since 1968, and that when she gets in she always thinks about how special she is to be so chosen.

Really not much more to add to that, is there? After 90 minutes with this creature, the incredibly shallow depths to which one ego can sink become ever more apparent. It's all about Joan and nothing but, except Joan's career, which exists only so that people can worship Joan as much as Joan does. Which is of course impossible. Despite her faux hubris at very occasional moments, she clearly truly thinks that she is chosen.

So Johnny Carson never talked to her again? Good choice. I've enjoyed some of her jokes over the years, yet also wondered at the point of being so deeply mean-spirited against folks who just don't deserve it. This film brings her absolute narcissism into harsh focus, and it ain't pretty. The endless plastic surgery is barely mentioned, but it's basically her fevered id frozen on her visage for all to see. And it changes weekly...

I watched the excellent documentary Bill Cunningham New York right after this, and what a complete contrast of New Yorkers: he never cared for money or fame or any recognition at all, whereas that's all Joan seems to crave. And he's ten years older and never whines about his age or appearance, while she does plenty of both. Whatever good thoughts I had of Joan Rivers disappeared forever while watching her sad sad selfish world on display here. She's as phony as they come, both outside and in, and as well made as this film is, it's just depressing.

Eventually, she became his ""permanent"" guest host until she accepted her own show on Fox.  Her career took a deep downward spiral as Johnny essentially blackballed her.  When her show was cancelled, her husband who was her producer, committed suicide.  She talks about all of this in this terrific documentary.  We follow her on her continual pursuit to work.  She's driven and determined.  It's actually pretty remarkable especially given her age at the time (75).  Every young show biz wannabe should watch this film.

4312271,3,B004AUP3F8,"This is an intermittently entertaining and often confusing documentary about veteran U.S. comedienne Joan Rivers, who was once very big and then fell afoul of Johnny Carson and the people at Fox and found herself discarded. I had the impression from the advance publicity that she was still working because she was on the verge of bankrupcty and needed to find money for food every day. Wrong. She lives in a ludicrously gilded over-the-top gilded palace in New York with a staff and driver and a limo as well as access to private aircraft whenever she needs them. So why does she work so hard? Why does she despair when she sees an empty appointment book? Perhaps it's her work ethic, which drives her to accept any job she can take, be it a slot on QVC's shopping channel or a small event buried deep in the American Midwest. We never learn how much these gigs pay and whether she'd really go bankrupt if she chose to skip that event in Kentucky or Ohio or wherever. Perhaps she's escaping her past, which involves a husband who committed suicide and a daughter who has issues with the way she was brought up. She talks frankly to the camera but the viewer can never really connect the dots to see what makes her tick. Does she want to outlive all her rivals? Perhaps. There are far too many mysteries unsolved at the end of this work.",1300147200,4,1337,4.483606557377049

I didn't know that.  This film showed her as go, go, go....the workaholic.  Sure, there were some non-business related moments, but show biz was always beckoning.  If there were other sides to her, then why weren't they shown?  Was it the performer the filmmakers were documenting or the complete person of Joan Rivers?  I think the former.

Of her peers, Don Rickles' was the only interview snippet.  What would have fleshed out her life more colorfully would have been to get a cross-section of fellow performers, whether actors or comedians...her staff and agent chimed in, which was a good start, then it fell flat.

The history of her time on the Tonight Show, background of her husband, growth in relationship with her daughter, her charity work and the ""interruption"" during one of her shows and her subsequent reflection on that experience, were the highlights.  I still wanted to know more about the major highs and lows of Joan's life....it just seemed like too quick of a glossover.  Her daughter inferring the insecurity of her mother was an obvious entry to deeper investigation.  Alas, it never surfaced, which is partly why the film didn't seem like a documentary, but a ""promo"".

4312273,4,B004AUP3F8,Good movie. I wasn't always a huge fan of Joan Rivers but now I am. A piece of work is a snapshot of a lifestyle few ever get to experience. It is nice to see Joan share it with us in a non-arrogant unabashed way. Thanks Joan.,1298592000,,226,3.8297872340425534

4312275,4,B004AUP3F8,"""A Piece of Work"" is a very apt subtitle for this film, since it sums up rather succinctly the driving force behind Joan Rivers' career--she is a woman constantly on the lookout for her next piece of work. Perpetually aware of just how difficult it is to hit a moving target, Rivers never seems to slow down. At the age of 75, she keep herself busier than many working actors/comedians 1/3 her age. Ricki Stern's film chronicles Rivers' career, from her beginnings on ""The Tonight Show"" through her stint as permanent guest host, her devastating decision to leave that show for her own talk show (a decision that created a rift between Rivers and Johnny Carson that never healed), her husband's suicide, and her struggle to recover from it both personally and professionally. Rivers' daughter Melissa is of course a big part of this film, and her presence creates perhaps an unintentional stark contrast to Rivers herself. Joan is the consummate hard-working, smart, talented, honest professional entertainer, while her daughter, who claims to have chosen a career in show business, actually possesses little or no talent and has forged a ""career"" in entertainment simply by virtue of her status as Joan's daughter. If Melissa Rivers were not Joan's daughter, I doubt she would be able to find any work at all in the entertainment industry. Be that as it may, ""Joan Rivers: A Piece of Work"" is a penetrating and entertaining documentary about the life and career of one of the funniest--if not THE funniest--women in the business.",1297555200,,1530,4.934108527131783
4312276,4,B004AUP3F8,"After a career span of more than -- um, oh at least 115 years, it's gratifying someone helped finance this documentary, which retraces the genius of Joan Rivers, beginning with the birth of her firstborn twins, Jack Paar and Steve Allen; the weaning of Johnny Carson's ""Tonight Show"" audiences off his standard late night schtick and her exploits raising consciousness among drunken dweebs in the upper Midwest. The scene from her north woods appearance was priceless; her taste for New York City hot dogs unimpeachable. (Better than, ""Hey, stop the limo on 10th and 53rd! We need pretzels, g-d-it!"") Rivers is one of a kind, even if she's hardly a 'glam dolly' without all her makeup; the wardrobe -- approaching that of Imelda Marcos or Elizabeth Taylor in range and scope -- can leave one breathless. (Even her coast-to-coast ""dresser"" is interviewed, along with her bling collection). Her humor is timeless, for the ages. The coup de vue, though, was the Q&A session near the end of the reel. Worth collecting for those who really love 20th Century stand-up -- or, send-up (whichever you prefer)! Did Colbert moonlight on this as co-director? Personally, three out of four in my nuclear family enjoyed this film. (So much for non-proliferation.)",1297468800,,1249,5.009615384615385
4312277,5,B004AUP3F8,"You don't have to be a fan to appreciate this excellent documentary.  From the minute it begins, you can't pull your eyes from it and the film does a good job of shining a light on the double standard in Hollywood - i.e. Letterman, Leno, etc. are funny comedians, but Joan Rivers who does and says the same things is a bitch.  You really get to know the woman behind the act here, plus it's not all laughs.  This documentary is totally raw and so well done.  I highly recommend it.",1297296000,2,481,4.252747252747253
4312278,5,B004AUP3F8,"I saw this documentary twice in theaters, and bought the DVD for my grandmother. I'd read a few reviews claiming the filmmakers were slightly harsh on Rivers, but what I found instead was a heartfelt look at a woman who has put her entire heart and soul into building a career out of comedy and truly believes in the power of laughter to heal. One of the most memorable moments comes when she is heckled by a man whose daughter is deaf. Rivers goes off on him onstage, then rails against those who'd use their seats in the crowd to protest the content of a comedy show in that way, but offstage, we see that she's rattled, that some of that stage persona was, in fact, bluster.

It's this nuance that shines through here; when Rivers is ""on,"" she is completely on, and so much of her life is focused on her career. Seeing her paging through her potentially blank calendar book, then determinedly doing everything she can to fill it up, it's clear that work is her lifeline, and has been, through traumatic events like her husband's suicide, and is what keeps her going through old age. She is not trying to be selfless, but she is extremely driven, and the filing cabinet full of all her jokes shows her work ethic has sustained her for her long and still-enduring career. The filmmakers aren't asking us to emulate Rivers, and, indeed, the appearance of her daughter Melissa Rivers shows that while they love and support each other, there is some tension in that relationship. Melissa works as a great foil here. This is an entertaining look at a legendary comedian who hasn't stopped going going going, and doesn't intend to.",1296950400,,1627,4.59106529209622

4312281,5,B004AUP3F8,"She really is revolutionary.  She is so self aware.  She describes a deep innate need to perform on stage and have people find her to be funny and relevant.  She also is honest about the need to make money because she had not invested wisely (her late husband had left her with debts) and because she needs to maintain her standard of living (lots of servants and assistants).  But mostly she wants to be seen and heard.  She is truthful about this inexplicable star quality - she needs to perform. She needs bookings.  She needs promoters.  She also reminds us of how long she has been around (since the 1960s) and how unusual she was then, and how she remains successful in an overwhelmingly male arena.

She does not expound on any of the above in a maudlin or self pitying way.  She does not let ageism or misogyny get to her, though she acknowledges their large role in our society.

She is impossible to dismiss and write off.  She is incredibly smart and conscious of everything around her.

The plastic surgeries, the television jewelry commercials - those are just side issues.

This documentary made me see her in a completely new appreciative light.",1296518400,,1160,4.627450980392157

However, I have always been intrigued by her as a person.  Yes there are the constant jokes of extensive plastic surgery, etc. but I've always wondered what kind of person she was, when she wasn't on stage cracking jokes or commenting on the various fashion woes of hollywood celebrites.  Finally some of those questions have been answered!  This documentary was not only intriguing it was so well done. I have a new found interest in Joan Rivers, solely due to this film.  My distaste has been replaced by a fondness, something I never believed would happen, believe you me.  Watching her with her family and her staff I was able to see Joan Rivers for what she truly is - A Person!  Not only would I recommend this to anyone and everyone, I thank Ms Rivers for having the guts to put herself out there everyday working in a business she admittedly believes is truly unkind and unpredictable.

You see Rivers,  who is a 50 year veteran of comedy, showcases that she is still  struggling  being a comedy genius. This is the real woman who hates seeing her appointment callendar blank.

Ricki Stern keeps the focus on Rivers..in good or bad. What amazes me is Rivers recants her career as well as the year in her life. It is the ups and downs in that year.

One of the highlights is a heckler who talks back to Rivers from the stage and how she puts him in his place.

This is an amazing piece of filmmaking. I just wish it could be up for an Oscar. The Academy said that this film could not be nominated for an Oscar..how depressing!

4312287,4,B004AUP3F8,"You don't have to be a huge fan of Joan Rivers to enjoy ""Joan Rivers: A Piece of Work"", but it helps if you at least think she's sometimes extremely funny (I do).  It also helps if you have a fascination with the lives and behind-the-scenes preparation of famous performers (again, I do).  In any event, I enjoyed this succinct, entertaining film, and if you're any kind of documentary or biography fan, you might, too.

The three things in the movie that resonated the most with me were: 1) Learning that Ms. Rivers, like many famous performers, still drags along the insecurity of her earliest, hand-to-mouth period, often to the point of still worrying where her next meal is coming from, 2) Seeing that fame is hard work, with Joan constantly trying to come up with new gags, jokes, and observations to fill up her act, and 3) the well-chosen clips of her stage performances, which deliver the right balance of funny and revealing.

Between the above, all the old black-and-white TV clips of Joan breaking the comedic glass ceiling, and the fascinating juxtaposition of a woman who freely admits she needs to be surrounded by luxury yet spends considerable time delivering bags of food to the needy, you'll likely be as absorbed in the proceedings as I was.  As the film's title testifies, Joan Rivers is indeed a piece of work, and one well worth visiting via this compelling little profile.",1294704000,2,1396,4.75206611570248

4312290,4,B004AUP3F8,"I'm not a huge fan of Joan's. She used to be funny when she couldn't use the F-bomb and the C words and many other terrible words that are even more terrible when they come out of the mouth of an old lady (I no longer watch anything with Betty White in it after she said the M-F word on ""Snl."") It's just not funny. It seems desperate. I find Phyllis Diller to be much funnier than Joan and to my knowledge, she never had to revert to filthy profanity.

However this was an interesting movie. After a while you get past the fact she has screwed with her face so much she now looks like the ventrilquist dummy Madam from Waylon and Madam. He was funnier too. But Joan's fight to rise in her field and stay there are quite interesting and a lesson to today's youth who think they can start at the top.

Particularly interesting was how Joan defused a very angry heckler with a deaf son after Joan made a joke about Helen Keller. I thought the fur was going to fly, but Joan handled it very well.

BTW Joan buys fur. I hope someone has clued her in on that!

The contradictions of her circumstances: surviving a husband's suicide, brutal professional/public let downs, daughter's failed marriage, multiple cosmetic surgeries resulting in a grotesque mask that looks like a Halloween costume of a glamorous-Tranny-porn-star.
The petite world class survivor with a will of steel, always dressed to KILL in the cliche' drag uniform of neon pink feather boas and dripping in crystals, beads, sequins and sparklers, is endlessly limousined around town with her personal assistant, who helps negotiate her next gig and offers a sympathetic/detached ear.
Her self deprecating comedy is crass and hideously confrontational, never clever, insightful or witty, and all designed to get a roar out of a faithful audience who can't take their eyes off their ""daring"" queen of mean spirited comedy. No topic, or gutter speak, is off limits to feed the hunger for ugly bad taste. What would ""Johnny' have to say...I shudder to think.
Miss River's preparation is impressive indeed with endless index cards with bits and pieces of juicy/poisonous one liners and such... meticulously filed away since her start in the 60's...a half century ago.
Her private life in an ornate, over the top, gold leafed Upper East Side New York Palace with a staff to cater to her every need is in bizarre contrast to her gigs off the grid in places like Wyoming and the Bronx.
The sweetest few seconds of this documentary is when she's riding around town with her angelic grandson, playing the devoted GRAND-ma.
The saddest is when she can't find her manager, Billy, who drops off the face of the earth, leaving her high and dry with memories of her personal history she can't share with anyone else.
The strangest is when she discloses her lifelong wish to be a serious dramatic actress....boy did she ever miss the exit ramp on that dream.",1294358400,11,1943,5.018575851393189

These people are either blessed or lucky, but there is another set of stars and there are called ""hard labor"" and that's where Joan Rivers comes in. The reason I say this is the documentary proves it. Joan Rivers: A Piece of Work tells the life of Joan Rivers through dark times and good times, but it's the fact that she see's beyond the good and the bad, and pushes herself no matter what. Her life will shock you at times, being 75 or older and still works, she has done plastic surgery throughout her life, and that's just some stories you will hear from her there is plenty more. She's a comedian who wanted to become an actress but due to her choices ending up being a lot more. Through the years I have seen her just about everywhere either judging best dress with her daughter, her own talk show, and many many many other appearances proves she's not going anywhere, I was surprise that she is a comedian since she has done so much I thought she does everything which she does. I can go on and on, but I'll get to the point. Joan Rivers life is not done yet she is a work in progress her mission here on earth is not done, she will be remember just not today because she is still here. To all the misunderstood people who have thought of her as a joke you have no idea until you see this film. It completely gave me a 360 on viewing her now.

4312296,5,B004AUP3F8,"""Joan Rivers: A Piece of Work"", subtitled ""A Year in the Life of a Semi-Legend"", follows the comic through her 75th year, remarkably still an eventful time for a woman who's been in show business for 50 years. To start the year, Joan's career seems to be in the toilet: Her appointment book is mostly blank, and ""last year was a very difficult year -I was playing...the Bronx at 4:30 in the afternoon."" But his year, she is rehearsing her autobiographical play ""Joan Rivers: A Work in Progress by a Life in Progress"" and taking it to the UK. She will be taping ""Celebrity Apprentice"" with her daughter Melissa, roasted on Comedy Central, paying tribute to George Carlin at the Kennedy Center, touring whenever she can, and filming this documentary by filmmakers Ricki Stern and Anne Sundberg.

Joan Rivers is a workaholic. Her agent Larry Thompson says she has ""a maniacal fanaticism to succeed."" At 75 years of age, she wants every hour of every day in her appointment book to be filled, she wants multiple shows per day, and she wants to resurrect her career for the umpteenth time. And she succeeds -with great effort. This woman has the energy of a teenager. I could hardly believe it. She has the single-minded drive of a person obsessed. And she's tough. She's also very, very funny. Still. We get to see some of her old jokes through archival footage, which show that she was always shocking for her time. She did abortion jokes in the 1960s. I have to hand it to her: She had guts, and the jokes were great.

For the most part, Joan speaks for herself in ""A Piece of Work"". Her play provides a nice opportunity to explore the earlier years of her career. She talks about The Ed Sullivan Show, how Johnny Carson changed her life, and her husband Edgar's suicide. But the focus is on Joan Rivers today, not in the past. She's works constantly to live in the style she likes. And she doesn't like to be called an icon; she's not dead yet. We see both her personal and professional lives for a year, and there's not much to separate them, as her work has always consumed her. I expected candor from Joan Rivers, but I didn't expect her to be this honest. I guess she knows that there's not much point in being less than honest, and that makes this one of the best films ever about the entertainment business-and certainly one of the funniest.",1293062400,6,2346,4.53066037735849

Although I firmly believe that the directors could have done a far better job in editing this film to show more insight into Ms. Rivers' amazing life, this film does do a good job of showing healthy glimpses inside the brilliance, vulnerability, softness and relentlessness of my all-time icon. The film goes far beyond the comedy that has made Ms. Rivers a household name for 40+ years and shows us the real person, with and without makeup and, frankly, I loved what I saw in every frame. This inspirational woman forged ahead when no one (and I mean NO one) believed in her, both at the beginning of her career and following her husband's suicide, to create a niche for herself and, as she mentions, turned herself into an industry. I recommend this film to anyone who believes, or wants to believe, in the power of human will and self-actualization, as Joan Rivers personifies both.

I saw her in the airport and in first class on my flight and she was witty, fun, posed for photos, and never once seemed put off by the attention.  Not at all a diva, she exemplifies an ethos that is now forgotten: hard work at a craft you love will pay off, and the fans are to be relished, cherished and treated as human beings.  Joan was this in real life, and her charm and sincere heart comes through in spades on this excellent documentary.  Her insecurities about her looks, her lack of true male love in her life (she and Edgar were more of a business relationship as portrayed in this film), her geographic distance from her only child Melissa, and her tireless work ethic are sparking gems in this well-paced movie.

Before leaving the airport, we had a lay-over, and Joan shopped alone in some of the stores in the terminal, dressed to the nines, hair perfectly coiffed and absolutely charming and gracious to everyone from the shop clerk to the janitor waxing the floors.  The DVD is inspirational for the way to treat others. Joan truly does practice this even off camera,

The documentary is filled with her humor and great jokes but, we also get to see a fascinating and raw portrayal of Joan Rivers. I was truly fascinating by this honest and real as she bares it all, her truths, her insecurities, her humor and her life. The filmmakers follow her around for a year going through the lows and highs with her, catching her when she is at her most vulnerable and she is nothing but welcoming. The documentary shows the hard working, brilliantly funny and crass she is. It is a well done documentary with excellent timing, like Rivers herself. I laughed and felt for her and then I rallied and laughed some more.

All Joan Rivers is to make you laugh, to work and, of course, to get paid. She wants to live her lifestyle and she will work for it. She will laugh at herself, at you and with you. As with Rivers, no taboo subject was left untouched by the filmmakers. Her husbands suicide, surgery, relationship with her daughter, work or lack thereof were all discussed, and then some.

This is a brilliantly filmed documentary with its subject, Rivers, at her usual raw and real self. Must see. If you weren't a fan of Rivers before, you will be after this. Or, at least, you'd like her a little bit more.",1292544000,2,1314,4.403292181069959

""Joan Rivers: A Piece or Work,"" is a documentary film about the life of the comedienne as she was followed for an entire year. The film delves into Joan's early days, her career triumphs and her personal lows, while covering her desperate attempt to stay on the top.

The film has many moments of Joan's raw and often vulgar comedy bits, but it was the shock factor that made her and many other comics big stars.

Behind the mask of make-up and the layers of plastic surgery, emerges a woman of immense love. She is the sole support of family members, pays employees extra to send their children to private school. There are tender moments such as with her grandson as they deliver meals to the needy on Thanksgiving Day for her charity called God's Love We Deliver.

This film does a great job of making it seem like you're a fly on the wall at some very private moments during the year they followed Joan Rivers. Most astonishing is Joan's longing to be noticed as an actress and not a comedienne. Her start in comedy was much by accident. She trained in college as an actress, and started in comedy clubs to pay the bills while she searched for acting jobs during the day. She uniquely stated ""I am an actress playing the life of a comedienne.""

Whether you are a fan of the comic or just want to see a slice of the highs and lows of any kind of show business career this is great film to see. This film has had a large release and thus it is very likely to get some notice during award season.

4312304,4,B004AUP3F8,"I've honestly never really been a fan of Joan Rivers. Although I love stand-up comedy, perhaps Joan's public persona as a plastic surgery cautionary tale, red carpet pest, and daytime talk show host had blinded me to her comedy accomplishments. I started to see her in a different light recently when I saw her roast on Comedy Central, which made me curious to check out this acclaimed documentary.

After seeing this film, it's hard not to like Joan. At 75, Joan Rivers has clearly gotten to the point in her life where she's no longer interested in apologizing for herself or trying to be anyone she's not. The film offers an honest portrait of a real woman who is made up of passions, flaws, idiosyncrasies, insecurities, relationships, emotions, and all of the other complicated, messy things of life. Joan comes across as ambitious, hardworking, frank, big-hearted, generous, passionate, and, of course, very funny. She also comes across as needy, vain, grasping, opportunistic, self-pitying, and self-absorbed. In a nutshell, she comes across as human.

Probably one of the most fascinating and insightful theories that the film perpetuated about Joan is that she is less a comedian than an actress playing the role of a comedian. Born without perhaps the beauty or sexual charisma to be a theatrical diva, Joan created her comedic persona in order to attain the attention, accolades, and ability to connect with an audience that she so clearly needed, and, at age 75, still needs.",1288310400,24,1487,5.016194331983805
4312305,5,B004AUP3F8,"I am very happy to be able to PRE order this wonderful movie. Joan Rivers has a full backstory behind her jokes and one liners and they are just as real and interesting as her jokes are. If there is one thing I would say bad about it was that it was to short, and I hope that the DVD includes some bonus Footage. I have seen Joan live in the past year and She was Just as funny as ever, however I think you might enjoy this even if your not a HUGE fan-it really gives an inside view of life of a ""STAR"" with the up's and down's that come with it. CAN WE WATCH!",1288137600,,560,3.7948717948717947
4312306,5,B004AUP3F8,"While I know many find her abrasive and even obnoxious, I've found Joan Rivers to be an enigma, sometimes too quick to make harsh comments -  but there is no doubt that she is one smart lady. Long before I watched her perform comedy, I remember how she always knew the answers when she appeared on game shows. She rarely gave a ""fake"" answer and could be relied on to know even the most obscure information. It isn't hard to believe that she reads voraciously. Or course, she isn't going to suit everyone's taste. Even so, detractors should give this film a chance. If nothing else, she reveals far more than viewers might expect, including a vulnerable side.. Her tough persona is just that and underneath it all she has endured personal pain, including a husband who committed suicide and an ensuing estrangement from her daughter (now reconciled). Those blows could have taken her down for years but she kept on going.

I couldn't help wondering if people would be so hard on her if she was a male comedian. I do think she gets unfairly criticized because she is a women who dares to take on any subject. If you've had the chance to see her in person, you know that she connects with individual members of her audience. She also ad libs admirably.

I learned plenty that I didn't know about Joan Rivers from this film, even with all the material that is already out there. She has appeared on a wide variety of television shows, from Celebrity Apprentice to Rachael Ray. Her work ethic is incredible and if she reveals any fear under that tough exterior, it is a fear of not having some place to perform. Work appears to be her salvation, along with her daughter and friends. This is a fascinating documentary about a woman who is far more multi-faceted than she might appear.",1285459200,,1779,4.570532915360501
4312307,5,B004AUP3F8,"About three years ago Joan Rivers was approached by two young film-makers to do a documentary on her life. The only thing Joan asked for was that the producers go all out for the film: she wanted to bare her soul and to show the public who Joan Rivers really was.

 We all know Joan Rivers: foul-mouthed, witty, funny, campy, plastic surgery extraordinaire, but few of us know the real Joan. Sometimes it's common for people to mistake celebrities for not being real people with real problems and this wonderful documentary throws the lid off that misconception. We see Joan as being a real person with problems, issues, nightmares, and insecurities.

 I have been following Joan's career since the early eighties when she became Johnny Carson's permanent guest-hostess and I have seen her battle her share of ups and downs. Where most celebrities would have called it a day by doing themselves in with drugs or alcohol if they went through what Joan encountered, Miss Rivers battled her domons and issues head on. During the film Joan discusses the suicide of her late husband and its obvious that although it's been 23 years since his untimely death, Joan still has not recovered. She also mentions her daughter Melissa with whom she now shares a warm and caring relationship, but not before they went many months not talking to each other as Melissa blamed her mother for her dad's death. Melissa is also interviewed.

 We witness the intense insecurities that has plagued Joan for years, everything from going broke again to not being able to work and make an income. As a viewer we observe how hard it is to see Joan being the greatest female stand-up comic and being loved by millions, only for her to feel completely alone and possessing that inkling that no one loves her and will not be there for her.

 Critics are raving over ""Joan Rivers: A Piece of Work"". This is due to the fact that Joan is not afraid to bare her soul and to show the public who and what she is. I have always loved and admired Joan Rivers: after seeing the film in a packed theatre, not once, but three times, I love and admire her even more.

 Joan Rivers has written two outstanding autobiographies called ""Enter Talking"" and ""Still Talking"". They are both out-of-print, but look around for them as they are extremely well-written and they give you an insight into this legendary performer.",1280102400,5,2375,4.701204819277108
4312308,5,B004AUP3F8,"""Joan Rivers: A piece Of Work"", the documentary about her seventy-fifth year could just as well have been called ""It's All About Me"" because it's about her bigger-than-life ego, her desperate need to keep on performing, feeding her ravenous ego. When her daughter Melissa was growing up with her husband Edgar the family business was show business, and husband and daughter were there to further Joan's career. Edgar was often the brunt of her jokes. This film has some hilarious scenes and jokes, but it's also intense.
No matter what successes workaholic Joan has, she always wants more, is greedy for public acclamation. She is petrified at 75 that she might have some blank spaces in her calendar. She is desperate to fill them in with book signings, appearances at dumps and dives as long as she can continue to make money to maintain her lavish life style.
In the film often she's being interviewed in limos, seen boarding small planes to make dates in out-of-the-way places, anywhere where people will pay to see her and give validation to her life.
The film told about how Johnny Carsom made her into a star. She was guest host when he was off. When she got her own show on Fox, he cut her dead, and never spoke to her again. When Edgar, her manager became a pest on her show, Fox insisted she fire him. She couldn't do it, the show cancelled, and Edgar committed suicide.
She blamed him for abandoning her as other people in her life have done. How did she and her daughter deal with his suicide? They made a movie about it. Her long-time manager Billy walked out. You wonder if she isn't impossible to work for. Even her own daughter feels that her mother puts herself first. Joan won on the Donald Trump celebrity show after her daughter had been fired and voted off the show. Her daughter realized that her mother couldn't afford to lose.
We see her huge Thanksgiving dinner for more than a score of people. That morning she brings meals to the needy with her grandson who seems to really love her.
She is not afraid to shock people with her humor. A favorite of gays, a gay goddess, she makes demeaning gay jokes. She has with her comedy tackled thorny topics like abortion. The way to handle serious situations like Nine-Eleven is with humor, she says.
One important scene is when she deals on stage with a heckler. She uses humor to defuse a difficult situation by reacting comically on her feet.
We see her impressive gaudy New York apartment with a couple of servants, a personal assistant and other employees.
She wrote a play, performed it in Edinburgh and London, but was afraid to bring it into Manhattan for fear the critics would pan it. It was a play all about her, naturally autobiographical.
The movie is repetitive and drags because it's so ego-centered. Joan seldom met an off-color joke she didn't like. But it's well worth seeing for a look at a life that few would envy.",1278892800,,2901,4.602316602316602
4312309,5,B004AUP3F8,"At times during ""Joan Rivers: A Piece of Work"" the viewer wonders whether a few of Joan Rivers' deadliest enemies somehow managed to sneak into her shows and her private life, for the express purpose of putting together a montage of her most unflattering moments. But no, Ricki Stern and Annie Sundberg, the makers of this relentlessly personal film about a comedian who has had more than her share of ups and downs, were given the apparently limitless access they had by Rivers herself.

The bulk of the film takes place during the last two years, during which Rivers works on an autobiographical play about her life starring herself, which flops in London; appears as a contestant on Donald Trump's ""Celebrity Apprentice"" with more success: she wins; and does a string of live appearances, most in out-of-the-way and sometimes schlocky venues. Interspersed with the present reality are flashbacks to the past, most notably her triumph as the permanent guest host of Johnny Carson's ""Tonight Show,"" followed by her greatest career mistake, an ill-fated move to launch her own talk show in direct competition with her former mentor's. Her daughter Melissa (as unflatteringly photographed as the star, incidentally), and longtime manager (whom Rivers fires during the course of the film), as well as some of her comic colleagues, weigh in with their own observations: one that particularly sticks in the mind is Melissa Rivers' comment that all great comics are ""damaged people.""

Damaged Rivers may be, but ultimately she disarms through her absolute refusal to make excuses or to rest on her laurels. In her late seventies she is still frenziedly searching for the next gig, the next comeback; one imagines her dying onstage, doing what she cannot stop doing. For what it's worth, this particular viewer, who has always found her hilarious, was also touched by this unvarnished film portrait.",1278633600,12,1893,5.103225806451613

It also showed Joan's private life, and showed her generous moments, which was not something I had known about before watching the video.
If you miss Joan too, I recommend this DVD.",1490140800,,379,4.428571428571429
8420995,5,B004AUP3F8,"I saw this movie when it first came out and was really surprised by how NOT funny it was. But it was not funny in a really good way. It featured the real Joan and who she was as a person. She's often just seen as a funny and brash comedienne, but she was 1,000 times bigger and better as a human being.

This documentary brings up a lot of interesting things. For one, she says that no man had ever told her she was beautiful, not even her husband. She had a good marriage but he never said she was beautiful.

She says that she was never anyone's first pick for anything in her life  always seconds. I find this inspirational because, despite never being ""chosen"" first, she accepted the offers and showed the world who she was. She didn't feel pretty, she didn't feel first, but she used what she had (a lot of smarts) and made lemonade out of the lemons. Big time. I always thought she was very attractive and had a lot of style.

There are parts of this film that made me want to cry. She says at one point in the film that any time a car showed up for her to take her somewhere, she always said thank you and felt gratitude for what she was given in life. That is a poignant moment in the film. Joan was an extremely generous person and cared for everyone who came into her life. She paid her staff excellent salaries, put all of their children through school (including college) and covered all of their healthcare. Even after her death, Melissa is still taking care of these people, per Joan's wishes. She was a great lady.

Melissa appears in the documentary but more briefly than expected. It is important to note that Joan raised a daughter who also embraces the same values and continues her mother's legacy. Between this documentary and the series, Joan and Melissa, I think you get a good picture of the kind of person Joan was, behind all of the jokes and gags.

Joan was a rare celebrity who actually remembered from whence she came. She didn't have to die when she did. What a travesty.

Definitely recommend.",1478131200,2,2025,4.355437665782493
