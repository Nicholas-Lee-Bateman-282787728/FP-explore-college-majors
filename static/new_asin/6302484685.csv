7826322,3,6302484685,"This video is very special to me because it's the first one I ever bought. It featured Spider-Man and his archenemy the Green Goblin. I saw elements of this episode on the Spider-Friends' ""Triumph Of The Green Goblin"", but it's way cooler when he's solo. The Goblin is one of my favorite Spider-Foes and his confrontations with Spidey are always a treat to watch. With his knowledge of Spidey's true identity as one of his weapons, that makes Goblin more dangerous. However, Spidey managed to put a stop to his vengeful plans against him and J. Jonah Jameson --- the other pain-in-the-butt. Peter's relationship with Betty Brant provided a sweet touch, but I wish I knew who was the lady who kissed him at the party, too. Hey, he can't be unsuccessful with women forever, can he? It seems to me that this Spidey series doesn't get much props like the others, but I really think it should. Therefore, for the true Spider-Fans, spin a web-line and catch this video.",1028332800,3,963,4.670588235294118
