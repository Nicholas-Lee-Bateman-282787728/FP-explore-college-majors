5892764,5,B00E688RA2,"Oh my goodness, just absolutely hilarious... If you are a person who loves gore and blood, then you need this. No question. However, some people just don't like the idea of furry cute animals taking the fatalities. But it's fake and very entertaining. I haven't watched the last disk just because I don't want it to end",1408060800,,319,4.614035087719298
5892765,5,B00E688RA2,I like everything about this dvd. It is awesome! I really love Happy Tree Friends. Best online internet cartoon ever.,1395878400,,117,4.9
5892766,4,B00E688RA2,"It's the most complete episodes with HD remaster in one box.
But it's just a small box with no booklet, just 4 DVD disc and the cover box.
No surprise nor additional item in that regular DVD box.",1384905600,7,195,4.157894736842105

8601907,5,B00E688RA2,Love this show and there are a lot of them on here. Well worth the money.,1500336000,,73,3.625
8601908,5,B00E688RA2,"Happy Tree Friends was the best adult cartoon in my opinion. The way its creators handled the cuddly, childish and beautiful animals to make the show able to be watched by a grown up and without introducing complicated themes such as politic, economics, religion and more, thus by making it much more simplistic: that, in my most humble and honest opinion, is true art. The colors are perfect, every character amazing and each of them getting its own starring role sometime in this huge collection of episodes.. Even the newest character Lammy, which I think is one of the best there are!! This is the only collection where you will get to meet her and completely fall in love with her and her schizophrenia induced cute imaginary friend Mr. Pickels, which I remember two have voted back in 2010 in order to add a new character to the cast between her and a grumpy male pig... Also, this collection is the nearest you'll get to have the complete series in just one DVD box, and that, for me at least, is pure gold. Additionally, no more episodes of this fantastic series were made after march 2014 and I understand this DVD came in late 2013, so if they never make more shorts, this will be always known as the definitive collection. Anyway, I hope they made more because this series is excellent (and if it happens and they make another contest to create a new character, I'll make sure one called Cuddle's Little Sister wins as I always wanted that character to have a cute and innocent but assassin little sister)!!! So if you get it, enjoy it the best you can... Well, that's all I wanted to say for now; that and that the DVD came in totally perfect conditions and that it is absolutely recommendable; see ya in the next review!!!!!",1474848000,,1737,4.552715654952077
8601909,5,B00E688RA2,"You have to have a twisted sense of humor to enjoy Happy Tree Friends.

If you don't know, Happy Tree Friends follow the adventures of extremely cute animal characters who get into deadly situations that escalate into gore, and then more gore, and even more than that. It gets so over the top sometimes you really can't help but laugh out loud and get grossed out.

There are four discs: two discs for thirteen half-hour episodes, and two discs for seventy-five short episodes.

It's the ""most watched animated online series ever"". If you haven't seen them by now, now you can watch in full HD! Recommended.",1473897600,,607,4.7075471698113205

#1-14 are from Volume 1
#15-33 are from Volume 2
#34-47 are from Volume 3
#49 is from Winter Break
#48, 50 & 51 are from the Overkill box set
#52-75 have not been on DVD before

The following episodes from previous DVD sets are not included:

""Whose Line is it Anyway?"" (from volume 1)
""Buddhist Monkey: Enter the Garden"" (from volume 2)
""Buddhist Monkey: Books of Fury"" (from volume 3)
""Dino-Sore Days"" (from volume 3)
""From A to Zoo"" (from the Overkill box set)
""Mole in the City"" (irregular episode) (from the Overkill box set)
""Ski Ya - Wouldn't Wanna be Ya"" (from Winter Break)
""Ski Patrol"" (irregular episode) (from Winter Break)

As stated in other reviews, along with the aforementioned missing episodes this set is completely featureless.  Just the shorts and TV episodes.  All commentaries, featurettes, kringles, smootchies, storyboards, ""Banjo Frenzy"" pilot, etc. are all gone.

It's also worth noting that all of the shorts on the original volumes 1-3, the Overkill box set, Winter Break, and TV volumes 1-4 were in a 1:33 format.  The HD remastering mentioned on this set isn't so much of an improvement on the picture quality (which was good on the old DVDs) it's really there because the previously released shorts and TV episodes have now been reformatted to a 1:78 frame through a combination of cropping and frame extensions  on the left and right.",1453248000,8,3434,4.570032573289902

8601914,5,B00E688RA2,I used to love watching these and than totally forgot about them. Im so excited that they actually sell the complete collection (or so I hope) on here. It came on time and looks new as described. I'm also glad that each disk has its own spot and they aren't just one on top of each other.,1440547200,,288,4.0701754385964914
