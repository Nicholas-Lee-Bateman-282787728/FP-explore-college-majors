It's absolutely beautiful!",1083369600,2,124,5.578947368421052
1949337,5,B0000VD11O,"I remember first seeing this on Tv when my children were 6 and 2 in the state of Washington.  We have since moved to Louisiana, and I haven't seen it on TV at all.  My children are now 11 and 7.  I went to Walmart and looked at the special DVD's on sale and by chance saw this DVD.  I purchased it yesterday, and since then the children have watched it at least 10 times.  Of course, I couldn't help watching the antics of this funny creature, and remember now how fun it was to watch.  I am now trying to find out where to buy more DVD's from Pingu.  One can do a search and find a couple of sites where info is available on products about Pingu.  Unfortunately, nothing much is available here in the USA, but if you want to, one can get Pingu Dvd's for a hefty price (due to s&h)from overseas in the UK.
For anybody who wants something refreshing for good entertainment for kids from 1 to 100, Pingu is the one to watch!!  You can't go wrong with this one!!

1949338,5,B0000VD11O,"It's highly unlikely that the Pygos Group intended this stop-frame claymation series to be an exercise in surrealism, but the world of Pingu is a fine introductory example of abstract logic.  Taking place in the Antarctic, the adventures of Pingu center around a young penguin who lives in a small village with his family.  Often accompanied by his best friend -- a somewhat sadistic seal named Robbie -- Pingu finds himself in a series of germane situations that are cosmopolitan enough to apply to any of us, which makes us feel all the better whenever he eventually triumphs.  One particularly notable detail of the series is that there is no literary component whatsoever; all of the characters speak in a sort of complex gibberish known as Penguinese, which relies on expressiveness and context more than phonetics.  This 30 minute ""best of"" is a delightfully entertaining addition to any video collection, and it's sheer absurdity will drive even the most stoic and sardonic of grown-ups into fits of uncontrollable laughter.",1075248000,5,1031,5.0828402366863905
1949339,5,B0000VD11O,"Being a penguin fanatic, my sister bought this DVD for me for Christmas. I wasn't for sure what to think of it originally, but came to really enjoy the DVD after watching it.
Pingu is a young penguin and he and everything in his world are created through claymation (the type of animation responsible for WALLACE AND GROMIT, GUMBY, CHICKEN RUN). The stories on the DVD involve Pingu and his friends and family as they go about the daily tasks of their lives.  Unlike most claymation shows, there is no literal dialogue:  the creatures all speak a type of mumbling that is called Pengeese.  There are six episodes on the DVD.
""Pingu Goes Fishing""--in this episode Pingu has his first encounter with a young seal named Robbie who becomes his best friend.
""Pingu Helps to Deliver the Mail""--in this episode Pingu helps his father deliver the mail in their small village.
""Pingu Plays Fish Tennis""--in this episode Pingu and Robbie are bored and end up playing a game of fish tennis.
""Pingu Gets a Bike""--in this episode Pingu's father runs over Pinga's (Pingu's little sister) bike. She cries and cries and cries until Pingu gives her his bike. Good lesson in sharing.
""Pingu at the Nursery""--Pingu takes Pinga to school at the nursery.
""Pingu and the Organ Grinder""--the poor Organ Grinder who lives on the outskirts of town is having a difficult time making a living.  No one pays attention to him or his music.  Pingu loves his music and decides to help the Organ Grinder.
Overall, I found this DVD to be highly entertaing.  The whole DVD is a little over 30 minutes and can be easily watched in one setting.  My favorite episode was ""Pingu and the Organ Grinder""; I found it to be touching and reminded me of how much I love my grandparents. This is a great DVD to watch with younger children and makes an excellent gift for any penguin or claymation fans.",1074643200,36,1857,4.6432926829268295
1949340,5,B0000VD11O,"All right, seeing as how amazon has failed to provide a decent explanation as to what Pingu is, it's 'splaining time for me. Pingu focuses on the adventures of Pingu himself, a lovable little claymation penguin who is the cutest thing you will ever see to come out of the world of clay. Aside for maybe Gumby. But Gumby wasn't cute. He was just...weird. But Pingu is cute. And cool. And he plays the accordion. I'm 14 and I love Pingu. Everyone should love Pingu. Buy this DVD and support the greatest show of all time. It has no dialogue, it has no human characters, but that doesn't stop it from being totally awesome. Pingu makes the coolest noises too.",1071532800,,656,4.475
1949341,5,B0000VD11O,Love it!  My daughter who is 20 months just loves Pingu!  She's dances and laughs at it.  It's very entertaining for her and the DVD has 10 minute stories.  Short and very cute!

She loves it and after only 10 minutes knows the name ""Pingu."" Family visited recently and I had Pingu on, and they all sat down to watch it and really enjoyed it too. So it seems all generations can enjoy this.",1289952000,,482,4.193548387096774

1949484,5,B0000VD11O,"Pingu? What in the world is a Pingu? Pingu is a claymation style animated series about a little penguin and his antics. You cannot help but to fall in love with this show.

My son loves Pingu so much, he has worn out the 2 different dvd's available to the US. We are purchasing another set of dvd's so that we can all continue with our Pingu Addiction.

Pingu not only has great story lines but you can actually have your child fill in his own words to flesh out the story. This teaches your children how to not only use their own imagination but to also express themselves through the art of storytelling.

My son is now 4 but we found these dvd's when he was approximately 18months old and he is an old pro at telling his story. Each time he watches the dvd's he adds more and more to the story and the dialogue.

There are great little life lessons in each and every episode, that you do not even consciously realize your children are picking up on. They will learn about compassion, family values, forgiveness, and even responsibility. There are so many more lessons also that will be taken away from these shows. Powerful stuff for a show that does not even have a true dialogue.

I recommend Pingu to anyone and enjoy!

1949485,5,B0000VD11O,I would recomend this video to children of all ages and even adults.  My kids ages 3 and 1 can't get enough of this funny penguin.  All stories have a positive and educational message. We are waiting for more releases...,1187827200,,220,4.475
1949486,5,B0000VD11O,Great and wholesome viewing fun for children. I wish they would broadcast it regularly here in the states.,1183852800,,106,4.944444444444445
1949487,5,B0000VD11O,"Fond memories of my older children enjoying quirky Pingu shorts lead me to search out some for my toddler who is super communicative.

Little did we imagine the emotional roller-coaster Pingu would be with the sensitive baby set! The very first episode in ""Meet Pingu"" involves Pingu accidentally hurting his mischievous new friend-to-be in a revengeful confrontation after discovering said seal stealing Pingu's fishing bait. When the injured flipper is displayed, tears flow; the seal has an owie, Pingu is remorseful, and another sound of wailing erupts. It is my 18 month old daughter! Only after they make up and become friendly, and after many soothing words and cuddles on our part, does she calm down.

That is, until Pingu's father delivers a letter to an elderly penguin that has sad news. When Pingu sees the old man crying, he also begins to cry. So begins another deluge from our baby.

And so it goes with the episode of Pinga and her father driving over her doll buggy (!) there was non-stop crying throughout the entire episode.

By the last episode we were drained.

That was it for me, and I decided that it was too much for her. Only annoying Ruby and Max or Classical Baby from now on. But my daughter would not forget Pingu. ""Pee-oo?"" she would query daily several times. She remembered!! Reluctantly I tried it again with similar results and vowed to keep it under wraps, but she calls for it when Ruby and Max come out. Eventually I caved in again.

After several viewings, our daughter knows what is coming. She is still upset by the same episodes, but is more toned down in her expression of upset. She  also talks about the incidents as they occur looking for our reassurance which we continue to give. Babies understand a lot more than we give them credit for and so we encourage her ""look! the seal's flipper is better! see! he's happy! they're friends"" etc. etc. ad nauseum.

In summary, we love Pingu and if this dvd had only come with an episode selection we could have safely shown the fish tennis match, Pinga at nursery, and...oh! wait! Pingu does cry when the fish gets stuck on his head!...and there is a tense scene when Pinga trips on the way to her desk...",1173830400,6,2195,4.639175257731959
1949488,5,B0000VD11O,"I am a huge fan of all things penguin and ordered this DVD during the 4for3 sale. I'd never heard of it or seen it, but when I watched it for the first time, I cracked up. The claymation's a bit rough, but it's hilarious and I can't wait to share it with my nieces!",1172448000,,265,3.8363636363636364
1949489,5,B0000VD11O,"DVD quality: DVD has 6 episodes of Pingu, each of 5 minutes. HIT entertainment could have added a few more episodes or supplementary material to this DVD. DVD has no menu. So, you've got to start at chapter 1 and play through/skip chapters to get a specific episode. However, these minor flaws are compensated by the thoroughly enjoyable storylines.

Content quality: Great for kids, esp. toddlers and pre-schoolers will love it. The penguins speak in their own, non-verbal language called Penguinese. Pingu conveys an array of emotions - he plays with his friends, takes care of his sister, cares for elderly people, helps his parents while having fun and playing harmless pranks. Sometimes he gets bit naughty too but at the end he realizes his mistakes and feels sorry.

Overall, a great treat for all ages.",1169078400,,810,4.948529411764706
1949520,5,B0000VD11O,"My son and I love this movie, and all the Pingu movies. The claymation is flawless and the comedy is laugh out loud riotous. Much like the three stooges, only it's a penguin. There's once scene where a sel keeps spitting water in his eye. Too funny. It's not violent, just cartoony, so if you don't like Tom and Jerry, you won't like this, but we love both!",1167955200,,357,4.264705882352941

I am delighted it has now come to the US and I can now buy a DVD instead of using my old  dual video recorder!  Pingu is delightful and is sometimes very naughty!

1949523,5,B0000VD11O,"Our 18 month old got a hand-me-down video from her older cousins.  It was Pingu ""Artic Antics"", a claymation video about penguins going about life as we do.  At first it seemed odd which made us keep watching.  The characters have their own odd language but each one has so much personality.  There are several short stories which are easy to follow.  They are funny situations with good values and life lessons.  They are very creative stories about Pingu, his baby sister Pinga and his penguin family and friends.  Our two year old wants to watch it everyday and we love it too.  Since there isn't much talking, it is easy for her to fall asleep watching it at night.  We now have bought 'Meet Pingu' and 'Chillin' with Pingu' which we love.  We would buy all the Pingu DVD's if they were available.",1143158400,,801,4.5

We first saw this on TV in Italy and, when I got home, I searched it out and bought both of the videos that Amazon had.  We've watched them over and over and we've given them to our nephews on both sides of the family, producing rave reviews.  There are more than 80 of these short clips out there but only a few on NTSC DVD; I'll buy more as soon as they're offered here.",1138406400,,536,4.287128712871287
1949527,5,B0000VD11O,"...Buy the Blockbuster version instead. We LOVE Pingu, but the packaging for this DVD, with its lack of menus & chapters, stinks. Hit Entertainment makes a special Pingu DVD just for Blockbuster, which is called _Introducing Pingu_ (not to be confused with this one, _Meet Pingu_), that you can rent and opt to buy for about $24. That may seem a bit pricey for one children's DVD, but it has all of the shorts from _Meet Pingu,_ PLUS the ones from _Chillin' With Pingu,_ AND it has a decent menu with an episode selection/chapters option. Totally worth a few extra dollars, as far as I'm concerned (it'd be about $18 to buy the two DVDs separately). And depending on how many copies your local Blockbuster has in stock, they'll probably be able to give you the original case, too. Ours did.

Meanwhile, shame on HIT for releasing such a poorly packaged DVD. And, most importantly, why don't we have more than 2 DVDs' worth of Pingu shorts available to us in this country? There are dozens of Pingu DVDs available in other countries... Why not in the US??",1130889600,19,1054,4.6063829787234045

No Menu
No Chapter selection.
It's impossible to choose between eposodes and if you go past the last one it stops the DVD and you have to put up with the stupid FBI/Interpol warnings.
Bottom line:  I'd wait until a better edition comes out or start off with ""Chillin' with Pingu"" (also sold on Amazon) which actually has a menu.
Note:  We rented a DVD at Blockbuster called ""Introducing Pengu"" which was a better deal than this one (more episodes and an actual menu) so hint hint Amazon - sell that version instead.
