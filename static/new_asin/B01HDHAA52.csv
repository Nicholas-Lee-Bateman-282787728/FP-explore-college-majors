7785921,2,B01HDHAA52,Bought as a package with 2 other Bill Zebub flicks. Neither was worth the money or the time taken to watch them. You would get a better return of your investment an more excitement watching North Korean Unicorn clips on You Tube.,1486944000,11,229,4.476190476190476
7785922,1,B01HDHAA52,"The DVD contain 2 feature films by the incredible Bill Zebub of Clifton, N.J. The first one is naked girls getting tied up and I guess raped and killed, similar to D**kshark. There was not much talking in the film, just FF nudity by the same girls from the other films, my guess strippers in real life. The second feature actually had a plot about a book report and contained a bunch of stupid politically incorrect stuff but hardly any nudity...so I have mixed emotions about that. I guess it is too much to ask to combine nudity with a plot, maybe next year's project.

Guide: F-word, sex that was maybe rape, but the girl's didn't look terrified, and plenty of nudes (Terra Incognita, Scarlett Storm, Lydia Lael + maybe a half dozen more uncredited)",1485216000,15,752,4.57037037037037

8765097,4,B01HDHAA52,"2 Feature DVD:

Scene 1: Trust Your Photographer
If it weren't for the single descriptive paragraph on the back of the DVD jewel case, you wouldn't have a clue of what's going on in this film other than chicks getting tied up and raped.

Scene 2: Dirtbags
I got about 20 minutes in and was lost so I'll have to re-watch and report back later
09/28/17 UPDATE - 'Dirtbags' IMO isn't worth the time to even watch!
.

All in all, it's Bill Zebub,,,what'd ya expect?",1505433600,10,461,4.337209302325581
