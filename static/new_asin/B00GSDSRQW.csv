6107545,5,B00GSDSRQW,We own a large collection of nature programs. Few follow the story lines of different birds from/to different continents with so much footage shot from a bird's point-of-view. It really makes this series unique and the angles are really interesting to see.,1399334400,2,256,5.119047619047619

6107549,5,B00GSDSRQW,"What a stunning video. Instead of the usual shots of birds taken from the ground, these photos are taken alongside the birds as if one were flying adjacent to them in the flock. Many of them are taken of migrations with shots of birds flying over well-known features such as the Grand Canyon or the Statue of Liberty.

Each of the three episodes deals with birds from a different continent. So in the case of South Africa, my home country, the one portion is of Cape Gannets diving through a school of dolphins to catch pilchards, an epipelagic fish. This section shows gannets at wing height, from above & beneath the water. All are stunning.

Experience birds as one has never experienced them before. This documentary has certainly set a new benchmark in wildlife photography. I would also recommend purchasing it in Blu-ray to appreciate the excellent quality of the cinematography.",1394841600,39,886,4.860927152317881
6107550,5,B00GSDSRQW,I saw this on KPBS. I absolutely loved it. This is the best bird series ever made. I could not believe how closed they got to the birds and the angles the producers achieved are magical. I LOVE IT! this is a MUST have.,1393545600,24,218,3.977272727272727
6107551,5,B00GSDSRQW,"This is a beautiful and educational movie. The migrating birds and what they have to go through every year and they sure know how to navigate. A niece works for the Fish and Wildlife, so I bought one for her/children to enjoy. this will be a great family gifts too, because it is very educational and the scenic is beautiful, even Monument Valley, AZ, Golden Gate Bridge, CA and etc. A long movie but worth it.",1497139200,,410,4.407894736842105
6107552,3,B00GSDSRQW,"can think of about 20 nature blu rays (which I own) that I would want to watch before seeing this again. Some nice camera shots from birds but really drags in places, just amazingly boring (even for a nature doc). They probably should have edited and paired this down to one disc. Now if you really want to see where BBC got the idea for this check out the french nature documentary called Winged Migration. That truly blows this out of the water and is something that is worthy of repeated viewings. The narrator in Earthflight is not that bad (thats a compliment) but he also is not the great David Attenborough. Sorry, I can really recommend owning this.",1490486400,,657,4.529411764705882

6107557,4,B00GSDSRQW,This was one of the more interesting movies we have seen. There was a lot of footage with birds wearing cameras so you have a birds eye view of flying which was a first for us. The narration was not clear.,1483315200,,205,4.024390243902439
6107558,5,B00GSDSRQW,"This is the most unique nature video that I have ever seen, and will leave anyone who pays attention in awe at the accomplishments of birds.  The section showing how the videos were made is one of the most charming things I have ever seen on film. Everyone should experience this video.",1483228800,2,286,4.5
6107559,4,B00GSDSRQW,"I love everything BBC Earth does, so I guess the bar is pretty high by now. Earthflight is still very good, but there are definitely a couple of things I'm not enjoying as much as usual. Some of the 'camera-strapped-to-bird-back' footage is quite bumpy, and I suppose in a sense it adds a touch of realism to things like landings, etc., but I still feel like I'm watching the beginning of Saving Private Ryan (no, not the cemetery scene; the D-day scene). Also the narration is...iffy. I guess that David Tennant has a large fan base by now, which probably accounts for the choice, but his voice and the subject matter just don't blend as well as Attenborough's always did. A few times I even had to back up a bit to catch something his accent had rendered less than clear.
In general, however, the photography is still up to BBC's usual high standard. This is definitely a keeper, but it won't be a favorite.",1482278400,,909,4.515151515151516
6107560,1,B00GSDSRQW,"While this has beautiful slow-motion close-ups of birds in flight, they are all too often followed by eagles or other predators killing and eating these same birds. This DVD should be rated. It is not suitable for children--too gruesome.",1479168000,,237,5.102564102564102

6107568,5,B00GSDSRQW,One of the most extraordinary nature (and travel) videos I have ever seen. The dedication and time spent nurturing all the various birds and filming the series was well worth the effort. It is also a great environmental video as it shows the effects of pollution on our planet and how its effecting all the animal migrations every year. Job well done!!,1459987200,,352,4.693548387096774

6107583,5,B00GSDSRQW,"This is the best birds documentary made so far.  Migration of birds, okay, but just think at the same time how the migrations of humans is at a peak in world evolution.  There has never been this many people displaced running from wars and starvation.  Meanwhile, let's agree that birds have reasons and they are not being shot at, except by a few gun-crazy humans.  How about shooting down drones over our property instead?  Where is this going to end?  No one knows.  Meanwhile, watch this perfect view of Nature in action.",1438300800,,525,4.641304347826087

6107587,5,B00GSDSRQW,"THE GIST: Six continents. Four years worth of filming. Literally, shot from the birds point-of-view. You see what the bird sees. You get to experience the choices he makes, the scenery and expansive, often dangerous, landscapes he navigates.

So I picked up this Blu-Ray series a week or so ago and I'm already finished. I was watching two episodes a night, completely sucked in. Originally, I thought I could restrain myself and watch one episode every other night, but it's just an impossibility with this highly edifying nature documentary.

If you haven't watched the trailer, head to Youtube after you finish this review and give it a watch. What you'll experience are tiny high resolution cameras mounted to the backs of agile birds as they trek great distances, incredibly numbing altitudes and navigate the bodies of dense and stunning wilderness with awesome nimbleness; like the forest scene where a hawk weaves at light-speed around massive tree's seeking its next meal.

There are five classical nature documentary episodes: North America, Africa, Europe, South America, and Asia & Australia and one behind-the-scenes episode: Flying High. All episodes narrated by the Scottish actor, Doctor Who's David Tennant, who fares an boyish Sean Connery cadence for nature narration.

All episodes will blow your mind. An immediate standout scene is found in the first episode, North America, where the crew follows Bald Eagles, one of the most social birds on the planet, as it soars over and through the Grand Canyon. The result is a dazzling view of one of the greatest places on earth, from the perspective of one of the most fabled birds on the planet.

Another great aspect of the series is how it fearlessly interlaces terrestrial animal biology with its bird facts. This is great because likely you're not a birder; or, rather, there's a good chance you're into birds as much as you're into other animals, so the series does its best to balance the focus. I'd say 70% birds, 30% terrestrial animals. And the scenes are gripping: you'll see, for instance, a baboon yank a Flamingo meal from the air, and watch a Manta Ray leap from the ocean and flap its enormous wings like a bird. Subtle markers that enshrine the interconnection between all flights of life.

The birds-eye-view scenes are dotted throughout each episode, but the series is not shot exclusively from the bird point of view, despite what the trailer implies. Rather, maybe 5% of each episode has birds-eye-view shots (Bald Eagles, Condors, Hawks, Cranes, Goslings, etc.) it would be headache-inducing if it was 100% birds-eye-view. The other scenes are filmed in the tradition of BBC's Planet Earth and Life, boasting vibrant panoramas, intrepid ecological study, glorious unending habitats and surprising terrestrial landmarks. There's some new ground trod by the series, where the crew spotlights incredible landmark travel destinations in high resolution aerial cinematography. You'll see renown Indian temples, Mayan/Incan relics like Mach-Pichu, European castles, even New York City filmed from the sky following some of the most inspirational migrations on Earth. I can say this as an avid nature movie buff, man-made architecture and landmarks are often distractions in nature movies and take away from the natural experience you seek (as a viewer, you want to know that vast wild habitats are still out there, to be or are under protection--without brow-beating the viewer with guilt over habitat destruction and natural degradation). This series respectfully acknowledges small pluses of man's influence on the planet, while retaining the dimensional reality of man's effects on the planet--but it never makes you feel guilty. There's no, say, scenes of a baby polar bear drowning because it can't find a glacier island rest. It says, rather emphatically within the subtext, ""Here is our planet, isn't it incredible that these species and these places exist? It would be totally cool if we could preserve and conserve them both.""

Some of the behavior captured in this series will blow you away. I am constantly engrossed by the wild familial relationships, and the bird families in this series do not disappoint. For instance, there's an incredible scene with a bunch of South American condors are feasting on a wild llama carcass, each condor family gets a segment of the carcass while several families feed at once, oldest males first, then females and finally the children, all feeding cooperatively. Then a wild fox spots the feeding birds and a chase ensues. The oldest males, the birds which ate first, are now at a disadvantage, heavy from their meal. It's fascinating, the level of detail which the tiny dramas unfold, the narration pointing out tidbit facts that aren't obvious to the viewer. Say, for instance, the hot air thermal island refuges that hoist birds over the ocean, little air sanctuaries that literally keep the birds alive, as they can't swim, for literally hundreds of miles. But not just that, they underscore the importance of man-made cities creating the same kinds of thermals, how our freeway network creates ""thermal highways"" for the birds to use navigating over vast topography. Seriously fascinating stuff.

I know this review is long and gives away a lot, but this is barely the pinky of an iceberg of fascinating biological and ecological tidbits found in this incredibly eye-popping and edifying series that is totally worth your time and is completely appropriate for all members of your family. This series is easily on par with, say, Planet Earth, Life, Madagascar and Frozen Planet.",1435622400,,5612,5.145833333333333
6107588,5,B00GSDSRQW,"This is a breathtaking documentary from the BBC that will fill you with awe.

6107589,5,B00GSDSRQW,I have never seen a documentary that has moved me so much.  Seeing the birds in flight and showing what they had to do to make it possible was amazing.  It is almost like a prayer.  The stories of the bird and the ones that prey on them and how they survive is a lesson to us all.  I have told everyone I know to watch it.  They are so beautiful and so close to God.  David Tennant is a fine narrator.,1434931200,2,401,3.8292682926829267

6107626,4,B00GSDSRQW,"Gotta say right off the bat: the production quality of Earthflight is a tier below that of Planet Earth, Life, Frozen Planet, and all those other Beeb docs you know and love (i.e. it's no Attenborough).

That said, the cinematography is truly groundbreaking at times. And at other times, it's downright psychedelic! SO MANY WINGS FLAPPING AT ONCE! WHO KNEW SO MANY BIRDS?! 0_o

I'm on the fence as to whether I'm okay with having paid to OWN this (a one-off rental would probably have satisfied), but I have to recommend you find a way to see it somehow.

1080p/120hz is A MUST, though. As overwhleming to the eyes as a crisp Earthflight image can be, I have to imagine the motion blur would be downright intolerable on anything spec'd lower.",1416009600,5,742,4.648854961832061

6107635,3,B00GSDSRQW,"....Not so much.  The commentator was acceptable.  Certainly no comparison to David Attenborough, who I sorely missed, but decent and he did not detract from the experience.  Unfortunately, I couldn't say the same for the loud and distracting background soundtracks and a overuse of a track of a multitude of songbirds in a spring woodland that was played ad nauseum during completely inappropriate parts of the series.  Once I became aware of how much it was annoying me, I could not stop paying attention to it.  But honestly, it was ridiculous.  Imagine hearing a loud background of birds singing even when cranes are flying (at 40mph) several thousand feet above the ground (sounds should have been nothing but wind and the calls of the cranes).  More overly loud birdsong during a closeup of an osprey ripping its prey apart (should have been sounds of feeding with dead silence, or else strident alarm calls due to the presence of a predator in the area, even one who feeds only on fish).  The poorly chosen soundtracks/sound effects had me scratching my head, wondering if the sound editor had been AWOL, since it's hard to imagine such an oversight in an otherwise amazing (and costly) production. I do know next time I watch this series, I'll be putting on some music (or maybe the soundtrack to ""Winged Migration"") and keep the sound on the DVD turned down.",1413763200,28,1367,4.811965811965812

My cat places herself center screen until she watches precisely one segment, then returns the next day for the following one. What was a habit became a traditition, then a ritual, now a sacrament. She must have her own immutable disks. Petunia comes to ""Eartflightt"" from an attachment to ""Wild Birds of New Guinea"" but shows a distinct preference for migratory photography, stunningly captured in this Blu-ray series.",1412985600,,538,4.988888888888889

6107640,5,B00GSDSRQW,"This is a 2 disc set, each disc containing 3 hours providing 6 one hour segments about birds and their habitats and migratory patterns throughout the world. The narration by David Tennant and the music are both just fine. However the video quality is something the likes of which I have never before seen on any screen, projected or otherwise. The definition of this video seen on a 51"" plasma screen from a distance of 7 or 8 feet is positively astounding. The first five programs are on birds of six continents: North America, Africa, Europe, South America, Asia and Australia. The sixth hour shows details of how these extraordinary images were produced. I have ""Winged Migration"" (2001) which is good, but this goes beyond anything I have seen. There are some shots taken from mini-cameras mounted on the backs of the birds giving you a real bird's eye view. Warmly recommended to anyone interested in birds.",1412121600,12,912,4.8152866242038215

I found out on this DVD that what was shown on Discovery Channel was re-titled to Winged Planet although I know now why they had to re-title it - what Discovery Channel did was put the whole 3 series into a two-hour feature presentation and showed only highlights of the series.

Their IS an earlier edition which you SHOULD be able to play IF you have a region-free player (basically a special order item) or a computer disc drive ( I'm told computer DVD players play all regions and both NTSC and PAL discs), but with this United States release, you can play it in any normal player.
My only complaint is the narrator seems passionless; he seems to be reading a script in which he has no interest---nothing like David Attenborough.

By that I mean a brief mention of the species is given at the beginning of a clip (a lengthy clip) but a few minutes into it that info is easily forgotten while viewing the content. I guess I'd prefer to have the species name either mentioned more often, or alternatively, to have it appear as text at the bottom of the screen every so often. It wouldn't need to be constantly there, maybe like a pop-up every two minutes or so. Same goes for the location information.

Spectacular and very well done. I found myself smiling, wowing or simply amazed at the sights in this Earth-flight series.  Besides gaining much more knowledge and respect to the birds, the last episode showing how the human-birds bonds facilitate the filming of the many close-up in-flight shots is simply amazing.

Thought I would see the world from up above. Instead, it was noisy when the birds were flying and it had little footage of the continents - not at all what I expected. What's worse was the capturing and eating of the birds from predators! Almost every scene had this! I did not want to see this at all. In fact, it seemed to be the focus of the film. One positive is that it had nice scenery and it was very relaxing; it actually put me to sleep! However, the cons definitely outweigh the pros on this one.",1522108800,,646,4.134920634920635
