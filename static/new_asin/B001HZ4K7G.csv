3645632,5,B001HZ4K7G,I absolutely loved this new dvd by Kristin!  I have all of her other dvd's and this one was definitely rated up there with those.  She explains all of the movements so well and challenges you with the cardio and pilates combined.  It also allows you to do segments or combine the entire workout together.  A+,1231718400,2,308,4.446428571428571
3645633,5,B001HZ4K7G,"This is a challenging workout yet Kristin inspires you to want to achieve a long lean body and a better level of fitness.
I loved the innovation of the cardio bursts combined with classic Pilates training.
Kristin makes it easy to follow and enjoyable definately a regular part of my week.",1231632000,2,289,4.686274509803922
3645634,5,B001HZ4K7G,"Cardio during pilates, I had never heard of it.  This DVD really got my heartrate up while incorporating the fluidity and core moves of pilates. I would recommend doing both session for a serious metabolism boost, but if you don't have the time you can get a great endurance workout in only 20 to 30 minutes. Kristin is amazing and explains things so well, I look forward to buying many more of her videos!!  Thanks Kristin, I can feel those muscles lengthening and becoming stronger already.",1231632000,2,492,4.709302325581396
3645635,5,B001HZ4K7G,"This DVD is great for those that want a GREAT workout and do not have a lot of time.  The 20 minute segments are great for my busy schedule.  Kristin is great, as always.  I have all of her DVDS and love the way she explains the moves.  Great background!",1231545600,2,254,4.02
3645636,5,B001HZ4K7G,"Bottom Line: ""Weight Loss Pilates"" is a great value.  The workouts are easy to understand, but challenging to do.  You can adjust the length to fit a busy schedule.  The instructor is positive and helpful without being chirpy.  The production values are great for a fitness video, and there are a couple of nice extras.  Five stars.

The Workout:  The workout is a mixture of Pilates and cardio.  Each segment alternates between cardio moves to get your blood going, and Pilates moves on a mat to increase flexibility and strengthen your core/abdominal muscles.  This workout kicked my butt (in a good way!).  I had no experience with Pilates before my wife got me to try this, but I do heavy cardio in my regular workout routine (mostly cycling--like most cyclists, I'm pretty inflexible).  The cardio segments were fairly easy for me, but the Pilates exercises really challenged me (this first time I did this, I kept thinking, ""when do we get back to cardio?"").  It was easy to understand how to do the Pilates moves, although I'm sure that it'll take me a long time to make it look as easy as it does on screen.  On each new move, I quickly went from ""Oh, I get it..."" to ""Ow! I have a muscle there? Argh!""  It's the best sort of fitness routine: easy to learn, but hard to master.  A real strength of the workout is how it's organized. There are four pieces: a warmup, two 20-minute ""fat-burning flows,"" and a cool down.  You can mix and match the pieces any way you want: play each piece individually, play both 20-minute workouts with warmup and cooldown (for a 50-minute workout), or play either 20-minute workout with warmup and cooldown (for a 30-minute workout).  I really like having these options, since you can tailor the workout to the amount of time you have to exercise or to the level of energy you have that day.  As my wife often reminds me, my schedule isn't an excuse not to work out (there's even a 5-minute mini-workout in the extra features).  Five stars.

The Instructor: According to the box, Kristin McGee, ""believes passionately in the profound effect Pilates can have on the mind and body.""  Well, it certainly comes through in the video.  She's positive and encouraging, without being too chirpy (my pet peeve with fitness instructors).  She's careful to offer little tips on form throughout her workouts, and I don't think she'll get annoying after 10 or 20 times doing the workout.  My only complaint is that she makes it look so easy!  Seeing how steady Kristin is in these exercises, I can't imagine how strong her core must be.  It gives you something to aim for!  Four stars.

The Extras:  The disc comes with a pair of bonus workouts, a set of ""moves on the go,"" and a cross-promotion from Cooking Light magazine.  The first bonus workout is a five-minute ""Ab Blast"" of concentrated Pilates ab-torture that's even easier to squeeze into spare moments of a busy day than the 20-minute segments.  The second bonus workout is actually a 5-minute preview of another title by the same company, ""Weight Loss Cardio Sculpt.""  The ""moves on the go"" are a set of pliometrics you can do while sitting at a desk or standing around doing chores.  Lastly, the Cooking Light cross-promotion is a 16-page booklet in the box with 7 recipes from the magazine and some basic tips on ""eating right.""  There's also one of those ""two free issues!  80% off!"" subscription cards.  The ""Ab Blast"" and ""moves on the go"" are the real value here for me.  Four stars.

The Production:  The workouts were nicely shot.  They cut back and forth between an outdoor garden setting and some kind of converted loft space that looks like it might be a hip downtown restaurant.  The sets are decorated with candles and plants, so it was pleasant to watch while I was lying on the mat with my stomach muscles on fire--a nice change from the grim-looking gym floors in some workout videos.  The menus were clear and easy to navigate with attractive fonts.  Production is hardly the most important part of a fitness vid (and most titles show it!), but this one really shines. Five stars.

Overall:  The workout is accessible, challenging, and flexible.  The instructor is good, the extras are okay, and the production is top-rate.  Five stars.",1231545600,131,4241,4.684281842818428
3645637,5,B001HZ4K7G,What a great workout!!!! I haven't done Pilates for awhile and now thanks to this DVD I'm back! I forgot what a great workout Pilates is for your ABS!! I will be adding this to my exercise regime at least 3x a week. The format works great for my busy schedule. 2--twenty minute workouts to choose from and I really like that the warm-up and cool down are separate from the workouts so if I'm pressed for time I can JUST do the workout and not have to fast forward the warm-up. And Kristin is an amazing instructor!,1231372800,,514,4.255102040816326
3645638,5,B001HZ4K7G,"This is a challenging but entertaining program that is really going to make your abs work while burning calories.  I sweat more than I thought I would, but in a very good way.  Kristen is engaging without being cloying.",1231372800,2,219,4.589743589743589

It's fine.  I didn't care much for the music on the video though.",1465171200,,262,4.326530612244898

3645646,5,B001HZ4K7G,"I really like this workout. Diffcult but possible, with different levels to aspire to. I'd say if you are somewhat active and alright with being in pain for a 1/2 hour, this workout is for you.",1443484800,,193,4.388888888888889

3645648,4,B001HZ4K7G,Great workout for an advanced person! Definitely not for a beginner! Even the most advanced person has room to grow with this workout!

3645655,5,B001HZ4K7G,"I really like this video, especially as a first time/beginner Pilates with a stronger core.  I cannot do all the moves for as long as she does, but it gives me something to work towards. I did it 3x in a week and on the 4th time, I noticed I was much better and could hold positions longer. She is very encouraging and calm (not too calm) and does a great job at instructing.  I have my two daughters try it with me as well (9-12 years old) and they love some of the moves though they can't do all.  It is nice paced with little breaks, and the cool down is great, so I suggest giving it a try based on reviews of other Pilates videos.",1426204800,,635,3.984251968503937

3645657,5,B001HZ4K7G,"This is an excellent video. This was my second purchase. I have one myself and purchased one for my Aunt. Some of the moves are difficult for example standing from a seated position, but Kristen McGee guides you through it,  she is darling! Some moves are seemingly easy but when you continue and the next day you feel the stretch and burn, so you know you're getting a good workout. I haven't done it consistently since having a baby but when I do, you feel elongated and strong.",1423785600,,480,4.454545454545454

3645662,3,B001HZ4K7G,Not low impact. I am prone to stress fractures in my foot and this is not at all the low impact work out I was hoping for! I really enjoyed Kristen's pilates for beginners DVD and bought this one to challenge myself a bit more. I wouldn't even call it pilates.. It's weird. I believe there was a good amount of jumping around if I remember correctly.. Maybe some squats.. Hard on the feet and knees .,1407196800,,400,4.207792207792208

Kristin doesnt waste time in between exercises for instruction which i love, and she is very encouraging. it is challenging without being too difficult. i am going to try more of her dvds as well, so i can switch things up.",1404432000,,457,4.146067415730337
3645665,1,B001HZ4K7G,"This was the worst exercise video. The insrtructer was abnoxious and the moves were clearly more yoga inspired and barely Pilates, except the 100s she finally got around to more the 10 min into the video. I love being active and am relatively fit, so I'm pretty easy to please when it comes to work out videos, but this was so bad/boring I did even finish it. Don't waste your time or money.",1403222400,3,391,4.36986301369863

3645667,4,B001HZ4K7G,"This video was my first experience ever with Pilates. I heard it was a bit tough for beginners, but I wanted to see for myself. Yes, this video IS tough but isn't that what a workout is supposed to be? It wasn't hard to the point where I couldn't keep up and didn't know what was going on. If you are a beginner you might have to take a few more breaks than normal, but this is a wonderful workout for your whole body. I was immediately sore in my triceps, thighs, butt, and especially the abs. I also really liked that she does some cardio as well - it makes for a more well-rounded workout.

My only complaint is that for a couple different exercises she doesn't do the same amount of reps for both legs which doesn't make sense to me. Other than that, this is a a great video I would recommend to anyone looking to get or stay in shape!",1398643200,,839,4.115853658536586
3645668,5,B001HZ4K7G,I love the addition of cardio to the Pilates work out. Keeps you moving and not on the floor for the entire workout. Great!,1396828800,,123,4.166666666666667
3645669,5,B001HZ4K7G,My wife and I use it at least twice a week and alternate it with Fusion Floor Workout.  I like the blend of pilates and calesthenics.  I really gets the heart rate up and it is fun to do.,1395532800,,187,3.769230769230769
3645670,4,B001HZ4K7G,"Agree that this is not a DVD for anyone beginning Pilates! I considered myself an intermediate level for Pilates; I own all of the 10 minute solution series Pilates DVDs and can make it through all of them, even though they still challenge me. Thought I needed more cardio in my life so I ordered this. The cardio is not difficult but the mat work is killer. Even though few of the Pilates moves were new to me, I can't get through that intensity and sequencing. Still giving it 4 stars because it's not her fault that I'm not ready! Will put it on the shelf and pull it out next year.",1394409600,,585,4.232142857142857

3645673,5,B001HZ4K7G,"I really enjoyed the two workouts and the warm-up and cool down on this DVD.  The exercises are short (if you select the shorter workouts combinations) which I like.

Good cues and instructions plus Kristen is personable.  I had done some Pilates (a couple of classes) and also worked with some other DVDs so I would place this not a basic basic beginner level but not so extreme that you cannot pick it up and work with it.

The results are worthwhile.",1393891200,,453,4.487804878048781

3645675,3,B001HZ4K7G,"I like the core work out but the cardio isn't very intense. I incorporate my own to get a better HIIT work out with it. Mountain climbers, plank skaters, jumping jacks etc. I maxed out on Jillian's yoga workouts (Meltdown and Inferno) and needed to challenge my muscles with something else. If you're in good shape you'll want to probably add your own more intense cardio but the core workout is great. Combining this one with one of Jillian's Inferno workouts would probably be a decent combination.",1392595200,,500,4.758620689655173

This DVD is for both strength & cardio but in my opinion, its a good strength training workout dvd. It's challenging but not like you can't keep up. You don't need to have a special equipment besides yoga mat...but really you don't even need yoga mat if your floor is comfortable enough to lay down. I'm not a big fan of using weights so I like that you use your own body weight for this workout. Also I really like Kristin. She is not too aggressive, not boring but she encourages you in good way... It's like you are having a good private pilates session with her.

3645691,2,B001HZ4K7G,"I have to say, I'm a little perplexed by all the rave reviews this DVD is getting. I don't have a problem with the moves in this workout, it's the direction AND the lack of modifications offered for beginners/people who aren't extremely practiced with pilates. There should be a disclaimer somewhere on the DVD stating that this is NOT for beginners--I'm not a beginner, but I found myself thinking, ""holy crap, if this was my first experience with pilates, I would turn this off in two minutes.""

I have a TON of workout DVDs that I love, and the very good instructors tell you what you're about to do/explain WHY you're doing it. Kristen just jumps from move to move, often without a rest between moves and often never giving you any sort of indication of when a rest will come. A lot of times she starts counting from 1 and doesn't tell you when she's going to stop...she simply keeps counting, and you have no idea how long you have to go until it's over.  Once she even went to 14!--why 14? Most instructors either start at the high number or say, ""we're going for 8...."" It may sound petty, but when workouts are very challenging, it's the difference between powering through the last few or saying ""when is this chick gonna stop?"" and then giving up.

Also, the second fat burn section is not that great, specifically in that she switches from intense cardio (jumping around, etc.) and IMMEDIATELY has you sit on the ground. I became very dizzy and then realized why.  You don't do that!

And just an FYI--the two ""20 minute segments"" are NOT 20 minutes. They're 24. Again, it might sound petty, but when you are struggling and looking at the clock thinking to yourself, ""why is she still going! this is supposed to be ending!"" it can be pretty annoying.  I just recently bought a lot of workout DVDs, and I would recommend Erin O' Bean's ""Strong Body, Ageless Body"" as a better workout. She explains things much better, prepares you for upcoming moves, and demonstrates several modifications for beginners.",1370217600,8,2014,4.627450980392157

I'm 35 years old, married, no kids, busy work-schedule and this DVD simply keeps me in shape. I like her attitude, which is not obnoxious as some trainers tend to be... I can relate to her and her instructions are always very clear.

Not to get bored from the same routine, I've also got her&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Kristin-McGee-S3-Strong-Sexy-Svelte/dp/B009IVI4IW/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Kristin McGee S3 - Strong, Sexy Svelte</a>&nbsp;DVD. As there are 2 different workouts (that can be combined if you have time, I usually don't) on this DVD and 3 different workouts on the her S3 DVD  (that can be combined if you have time, again I usually don't), I can do five days of different workouts without ever getting too repetitive. All you need is a mat for this DVD, while you'll also need light weights for her S3 DVD.

In addition, there are short warm-up, cool-down sessions that can be added before and after the main workout on the DVD. With those the actual workout comes to something around half an hour.

If you can motivate yourself to work out at home (which was a bit hard for me at first), this DVD should definitely have the top place in your pilates collection.

I've been a long-time member of Amazon and Kristen McGee is the only reason I actually set down to write a review. Maybe that may prove how much I enjoy her routines. I'll probably only buy her DVDs from now on for workout purposes. I'm definitely a devoted fan as her routines put me in best shape I've ever been in my life.",1368144000,7,1685,4.796551724137931

The routines are for an Advanced Pilates student and should NOT be attempted unless you have the muscle development and control that months of Pilates develop. If you're out of shape and overweight, DO NOT use this video or you will definitely injure yourself.

So I bought this video and it is tough yet not too much that I can't attempt most of it. I like that it has 2 different workouts (approx. 20 minutes each) including a warm-up and a cool down (both 5 minutes each). There are a few variations of the 2 workouts as well.

She is a stunning woman with an enviable body (a must have with any trainer, virtual or not) and is seemingly so nice and encouraging.  I wasn't bored and was definitely challenged, I have lost inches after just doing the workout a few times, and will continue to do it! I have already ordered another one of her DVD's and am thrilled to begin using it.  For beginners: this is hard, and the cardio will be a godsend in between those tough pilates poses, don't get discouraged, do what you can and you will reap the rewards.  The audio and background is also great- not distracting but very calming and beautiful, the angles are great so we can see the entire pose, eliminating confusion and she does an excellent job cueing.

I am sore but I feel great also I just started so I'm still having trouble getting my legs straight but I'm sure after a while I will be able to! What I love about it is that it's a challenge!! I did the warm up and the first workout and I kept having to stop and its something I can strive for!

What I disliked most about this video is that she never offers an easier option. I have several exercise videos and when things get more complex or difficult there's always an alternative instruction. It doesn't feel at all researched, instructors usually appreciate that their clients aren't all at the same level of fitness or ability.

I also feel that usually instructors switch between the areas going from legs, tums, arms etc, doing so makes the exercise more bearable. This video seemed to stay on the same area for ages.

She gives no directions just goes from move to move without even describing what she's doing, some of the moves are her own.  It is a very fast paced work out not at all what I expect from pilates.  Also this work out is ONLY for those who are working on their abs!  Most of the moves are just various advanced forms of sit-ups or crunches.  The 16 page booklet is more like a magazine exert with no info and just a few recipes.

First I started out with Kristin McGees Mtv Pilates dvd, which is a nice pace and good workout. After a month I wanted something more challenging, and I found this! I won't lie, I am NOT Ms. Iron Abs, so this workout burned every part of my body. And I mean EVERY part. The cardio blasts get your heart rate up, and really focuses on your leg strength. Then the pilates parts are just ridiculous (for someone just starting). Some of the moves she does look like something only a ninja could do. I've only attempted the workout flow 1. But you will get stronger, and it does get easier. Just be ready to be sore afterwards. I love it, and recommend it.

Update:
I've been doing this dvd for a month now 6 days a week, while wearing an ab wrap, and I've lost 11lbs. Be ready to sweat like crazy in Flow 2 of this dvd. Honestly I've never felt this kind of strength in my core ever. This is now apart of my everyday routine, and I can see the difference.

I recently ordered this as I was getting tired of my old workout dvds. WOW! I really enjoyed this dvd! Her version of ""cardio"" in the first segment is quite pathetic but boy, does it work your abs like none other! As said in other reviews, I dare you to do the whole session without stopping once.  After doing the first workout, I felt refreshed.  The next day, my abs HURT! I felt it was super effective! Although, I would say, the downside is that she doesn't really give you a break in between moves.  She has you do 8 of this, 8 of that, and 8 of something else, says ""Good job!"" and keeps going.  She kinda hypes it up so that you think you're about to get a break and then you don't =(
The next session was great! When I was doing it, she said that it really worked your lovehandles... whatever.  She was right, though! The next day, where my ""lovehandles"" are, I felt the burn! =) The cardio was much better in this segment!  Same thing though, she really works your butt/thighs and she didn't give us a break. Or, she thought we had buns of steel and expected us to push through it =)

Kristin McGee is so enthusiastic about what she does, which is great.  But she is also quite obviously a professional.  The exercises were to close together for me and just plain too hard.

I was completely new to pilates, 29 years old, not overweight, but not in shape when I purchased this video.  The instructor goes at a great pace for a beginner while maintaining a challenge once you become accustomed to the poses.  Her smile is a little creepy and she sometimes time warps into a different scene for no reason, but she is clear and encouraging. My only negative comment is that the warm up and cool down are not that helpful and I wish  there were more workouts.  There are really only two main workouts on this DVD (20 mins each). Still a good choice, especially if you want a tone-up with a good cardio blast.",1299456000,2,701,4.410852713178294

The instructor takes a certain area of your body and beats it to a pulp (in a gentle, connected-to-your-breath, pleasantly-smiling sort of way), then moves on to another area.  Rinse and repeat.  But, she's so nice and has such a positive energy about her that you don't end up hating her somehow.  This workout definitely makes me more determined to get stronger rather than annoyed that I can't keep up all the time.  I've never had a workout that was as heavy of an ab workout as this is, hands down, but she also hits your legs, glutes, arms, etc. and works in some decent cardio.  Pilates is NOT gentle yoga with a few leg lifts, as I've seen it done in other workouts.  I highly recommend this workout, but it is not for the faint of heart.  I still haven't made it all the way through - it's good to have something to aspire to.  I WILL finish this workout in one sitting. But, not today.....",1298073600,4,957,4.325842696629214

Due to the flow form instruction or prompts to get you from one exercise to the next are minimal at best.  There is also no tips on how to modify if you aren't a master pilates person.  It gets frustrating when you feel left out from a series and this can happen here if you can't keep up.  If you've done a lot of pilates, this is a great dvd.

Many pilates workouts simply do the pilates and no cardio. In this workout, you do bursts of cardio between the pilates. This is great for two reasons- you keep your heart rate elevated, and you get a break between some very challenging pilates routines!

This is a challenging workout, but not impossible. I recently got back into working out and have been using this video as well as others. I still cannot get through this whole video, and that is a great thing. I can get to about 25 minutes or so and then my abs give up on me. But, boy, do I feel it!

So, I looked her up and found this dvd. Another reason I decided to buy this dvd was because I read the workout would be challenging and I wanted to get into pilates. This past year, I was doing yoga. Anyways I like this dvd because it has the option of doing short routine and a long routine. Sometimes it can be hard to workout because I am a mom/wife/student and Kristin's workout are great for my schedule. Besides, I hope one day my body will look good as hers.

This is what makes pilates so challenging and this workout was seriously tough --- which I like.  The instructor was alright for me (i.e., not too annoying) but there were some points that just made me dislike this workout.

I thought the view switch between her in the studio and outside in the garden was distracting and added nothing.  At one point, the film cuts to her doing the move outside and, artistically, the focus is on the giant flower in the corner of the screen while she is mostly hidden behind the flower and you can barely see what she is doing.  Ridiculously unhelpful.

During some of the matwork, she was facing forward which I also found less than helpful --- having a side shot is easier for me.

Lastly, at one point, I believe she does a move with one leg --- then instead of repeating it with the other leg, you do a different move on the other leg.  I suppose at least we switched legs but I tend to think always doing the same move on both sides would give a more even result.

Just not a keeper for me.",1277942400,19,1152,4.366197183098592

If you cant stand ""skippy"" ""chirpy"" or breathy ""new agey"" instructors /saccharin sweet or boot camp style motivators then Ms McGee is right up your alley. In all her works I find her personality motivating and engaging. Though I must say she is deceptively angelic in all her intro's until she hits the mat, and then you quickly find out your in trouble as she turns into a workout tigeress. But bottom line for me is ""will this dvd ultimately motivate me to roll out my mat and get me going?"" Time and time again all of Kristin's dvd's have proven so, along with this one. Its a tuffy but just stick it out and do less reps in the beginning so you don't burn yourself out early on.

The cardio portions fit well into the mat/Pilates routine, although working on one's hands to do the vigorous cardio portion on segment two of the workout can cause quite a bit of wrist and shoulder tendinitis strain. Also, it seems that many of the movements are quite rushed, as Pilates was meant to be done in a more focused, concentrated, and refined manner. Sometimes it feels as if Kristin is rather rushing through some of the Pilates exercises without really breaking down the important elements of the movement (this is where an instructional book might be better, as it describes the finer points about a specific exercise for best execution and allows one to achieve the perfect form at one's own pace). Of course, this is meant to be a cardio workout, so it the pace must be maintained to keep the heart rate up, and so technique suffers slightly in the end. However, once I become much more adept at some of the intermediate to advanced Pilates moves on my own, I'm sure this workout will become more pleasant to run through without feeling like I'm being left behind. Kristin is energetic and strong, but just a tad bit too much on the anorexic side, which appears a somewhat concerning if one is trying to convey an image of good health and a reasonable body image of someone who works out regularly.

3645769,5,B001HZ4K7G,"My mainstay workouts are kickboxing and boot camp style workouts but since I've been doing the same Pilates vid for a while, I decided to pick this one up after seeing that it had something of a ballet element to it (cardio portion of Flow 1).  During the intial viewing, Kristin made it look so easy but believe me, this workout cardio/Pilates combo is no joke!  I dare say it's as hard, if not harder than my kickboxing workouts.  I'm always on the look out for a good inner thigh workout.  THIS IS IT!!  The tops of the inner thighs down to the inner portion of my lower legs were screaming at the end of the first workout (Flow 1).  That has never happened!  I guess I would describe it as that ""zipped up"" feeling that I hear people talk about.  But this one really is not all about the legs, it's a total body workout. Of course, being ambitious (ok, just plain stupid) I had to do Flow 2 the very next day. We're talking mountain climbers, punches, push-ups, planks, crunches, jumping jacks.  Oh, yeah and Pilates.  Whew!

With the warm-up and cool down, both workouts are just over 30 minutes and alternates cardio segments with a Pilates segment.  Flow 1 is more traditional matwork (the 100, teaser, seal) and Flow 2 (IMO, the harder of the two) consists on Pilates moves that are done from the table top position (on hands and knees).

Beginners beware:  You just might die!  I actually had to humble myself and downgrade. Yes, it was that serious. Since I truly loved Kristin's style, though, I bought her Pilates for Beginners. But don't think I just shelved Weight Loss Pilates.  Oh no!  It's definitely a keeper!

3645771,4,B001HZ4K7G,"This is another DVD from Acacia that offers two 20-minute workouts plus separate warm-up and cool-down segments. It is led by Kristen McGee, a Pilates and yoga instructor, and it offers Pilates matwork at a high intermediate to advanced level. However, Kristen spices things up a bit by adding cardio bursts throughout both Pilates workouts.

The Main Menu of the DVD read as follows:

Introduction
Workout Options
Bonus Features

Credits

If you select ""Workout Options,"" here are your choices:

Play All (53 Min)
Warm-Up (7 Min)
Fat-Burning Flow 1 (20 Min)
-->With Introduction: Yes/NO
Fat-Burning Flow 2 (20 Min)
-->With Introduction: Yes/NO
Cool-Down (6 Min)
Warm-Up + Fat-Burning Flow 1 + Cool-Down (33 Min)
Warm-Up + Fat-Burning Flow 2 + Cool-Down (33 Min)

I decided to try the entire routine my first time through. (Note: one editing flaw is that if you select the ""Play All"" option, the introductions are left in.) The Warm-Up (6.5m) is performed entirely on the mat. Kristen moves slowly, encouraging you to focus on your form as you breathe. Some of the exercises include the bug and floating bridge.

Following the Warm-Up comes the first workout, which begins with an approximately 4.5-minute cardio segment. Kristen performs arm circles, leg kicks to the front & side, plies, zip ups, little hops or plyos, and grande plies, repeating the entire sequence once. She then moves to the floor for traditional Pilates matwork moves such as the 100, roll-ups, and the series of five; however, she adds little twists to many of these exercises to increase the intensity. Kristen then repeats the cardio series, performing less repetitions this time through. Then it is back to the floor for more matwork, this time focusing more on moves that target the lower body such as bridge, 1-legged and full teaser, and the seal. The entire Fat-Burning Flow 1 was about 24 minutes long.

The second workout also starts with about 4.5 minutes of cardio moves, but this time, the sequence is a bit more high impact, as it includes Pilates jumping jacks, standing side crunches, punches side-to-side, plie jumps, and twisting lunges to either side, repeating once. The Pilates work is performed from an hands and knees position. Kristen performs some knee in-and-out moves as well as a kneeling push-up. She then moves into a series of exercises on one side of the body, such as moving the leg/arm in-and-out and a kneeling side kick series. Following this, she does another cardio segment, but this time, it is done in a plank position and includes jumping in and out, running man, open & close, and ski jumps. Kristen then repeats the one-legged movements on the other side before moving to a prone position, where she performs supermans, heel beats, hamstring curls, elbow plank. This workout, which comes in at 22.5 minutes, concludes with Pilates push-ups.

The Cool-Down is just under 6 minutes. Here Kristen combines dynamic and held stretches, concentrating in particular on the hips and the hamstrings; this was a nice conclusion to the workout. The Bonus features on this DVD include a 5-minute Ab Blast. In this segment, Kristen performs a rowing series from a reclined C-curve position, doing a sequence of three movements in the middle and then to either side. She also does and advanced corkscrew combined with the jackknife, and she finishes with the neckpull, adding an ""around-the-world"" twist. (Other Bonus features include the bonus segment from Weight Loss Cardio, a short ""Moves on the Go"" segment that focuses on posture, and Kristen's bio.)

As noted above, this is definitely a HIGH intermediate to ADVANCED Pilates workout. I consider myself to be solidly intermediate in Pilates, but there were times that I had to rest/take breaks during the Pilates exercises, as some of Kristen's variations on the moves were quite challenging. I'm still not quite sure how I feel about adding the ""cardio bursts"" to the Pilates workout. I didn't mind the cardio so much at the beginning of the workout, as it felt like a nice way to warm up for the matwork (better in fact than the actual Warm-Up, which felt kind of useless), but I didn't like it as much in the middle of the workout, when it seemed to interrupt the flow of the Pilates matwork. Still, this DVD is nicely done, and I would recommend it to someone who is looking for a challenging Pilates workout that is a bit different from the classical Pilates teachings.",1261008000,32,4449,4.929238985313751
3645772,4,B001HZ4K7G,"Positives first:  I very much like the flexible format (select combinations of workouts of ~30 minutes or full 1 hour, warm up and cool down that can be selected separately).  I also like the instructor -- as others have said, her enthusiasm comes through strong and clear, and she is encouraging and positive without going ""over the edge"" to annoying.  On the minus side:  the pilates elements are tough moves, that are challenging (good) but hard for a beginner.  I believe this would benefit greatly from a second on-screen participant who provided some alternatives to the moves that Kristin is using.  I frankly just can't keep my butt in the air as long as she can, or my neck and shoulders curled off the floor, without giving out.  I've attempted to invent some alternatives of my own while my strength/stamina is building, but it would be great if there were ""approved"" alternatives demonstrated.  I'll keep trying, and I hope I can manage the moves Kristin is doing in some future time!",1241136000,35,996,4.783625730994152

There is also a 5 min ab and 5 min cardio, which I haven't looked at yet.  I was sore after each of the 20 min w/o, but in a good way.

3645776,5,B001HZ4K7G,"Wow!  This is a phenomenal workout.  I have been doing pilates for years, and would consider myself advanced level.  This workout still challenged me.  It got my heart rate up, and worked my abs really well.  Actually, it worked my entire body really well.

Kristin is outrageously GORGEOUS, fit, strong, healthy, and totally knock-out beautiful.  She is obviously very fit and healthy, and it is inspiring to come back to her videos everyday, knowing that this is what pilates can achieve for a body.  Strong, lean, healthy, energized.  I like that I can do pilates and then have a fresh, healthy glow and be energized, and continue on with the rest of my day, which is very different from sweating it out on a cycle at the gym, leaving sweaty and exhausted.

The video itself is uplifting, calming, and energetic, but neither the images nor the music are in any way obnoxious or obtrusive.  In fact, it is in every way energizing yet also calming.  As well, the scenery is beautiful.  I love the surprise switch to the outdoors.  It's very dream-like, refreshing, spirited, mentally cleansing.

I love Kristin and each of her workout videos.  I have a whole stack of Kristin McGee DVD's and it is thrilling to be able to change it up.  I have done other pilates DVD's with other instructors (who shall remain nameless), but what I find especially wonderful about Kristin is her positive, refreshing, upbeat, hip, yet calm energy.  She doesn't sound nagging or parental or pushy or scolding.  Instead, she is warm, engaging, admirable, fresh, and friendly.  She is someone I want in my home everyday, someone I actually look forward to working out with.  If you're going to exercise several times a week, you might as well find a joyful route.

I can't say enough good things about this video or Kristin McGee in general.  Pilates has changed my life and my body dramatically for the better.  Just stick with it and you can achieve this for yourself, too.  Kristin is magnetic.  You will want to stick with it, not only to look as incredibly fit as she does, but to enjoy her warm and beautiful company while you get there.

Bottom line:  ORDER THIS VIDEO.  For less than the price of a few pilates classes, you can order an entire collection of Kristin McGee yoga and pilates DVD's, and ultimately transform your energy level and fitness for the better.",1234224000,7,2355,4.703431372549019

I loved this workout! It is fun, well paced, and challenging! I own all of Kristin's Pilates and Yoga dvd's and this one was as wonderful as all of her others. Her friendly smile and encouragement made this work out fun and it seemed to fly by! I recommend all of Kristin's dvd's for home practice.",1232236800,3,453,6.32258064516129
3645778,5,B001HZ4K7G,"I have a ton of workout dvds - and this is by far one of the best I own! Kristin is one of my favorite instructors. Her Power Yoga dvd is also fantastic. She's so positive and INCREDIBLY strong. Her energy is definitely contagious! This is a surprisingly tough workout. Kristin really gets your heartrate going and the pilates moves completely target your abs. Mine were so sore the next day - in a fantastic way! I love it!! The time factor is also awesome. I love having the flexibility to do one or both depending on how much time I have. I really hope Acacia produces more like this one. I think there are a lot of of us who enjoy pilates/yoga, but want to have cardio incorporated as well. NICE JOB KRISTIN!! :)",1231804800,20,716,4.311111111111111

8310167,4,B001HZ4K7G,"This workout DVD is not perfect, but I'm glad I have it in my repertoire and I would purchase again. Hopefully this can help you decide if it's a fit for you.
Pros:
- It will get you in great shape! I try to workout 4-5 days a week with a combination of HIIT training, running intervals, yoga, and this DVD. After week one of incorporating this 2-3 times I started to notice more definition in my abs. The other place this is killer for me is my inner thighs. I've always had strong legs, so this was a pleasant surprise to me. Even though this is a hard workout, I see results and that keeps me coming back.
-It doesn't require a big time commitment. Each workout including warm up is 30 minutes.
-  Kristen is a perfect combination of pleasant and motivating. I loved her in Bethenny's Skinnygirl yoga DVD, which is why I purchased this. I believe she's very knowledgeable, making her workouts very effective and a great bang for the buck.

Cons:
- I think it's misleading that it's advertised as 2 20 minute workouts. Even if you skip the warm up and cool down, the workouts are closer to 25 minutes. The five extra minutes sound petty, but trust me, they feel like an eternity when Kristen is trying to kill you ;)
- Speaking of feeling like an eternity, she's not consistent with how she counts the reps, and the number of reps vary for different moves with no warning. It helps to motivate yourself when you know you only have to push through for 3 more, but I felt discouraged in some sets when it felt like the finish like was moved back. Also, she talks during some reps, but doesn't include her talking in the countdown. So when counting down from 8, you might really do 10-12 reps. This is petty, I know. I did find it discouraging and annoying though.
- The change of scenery and some of the music were distracting and a little ""cheap"" to me. I don't notice it now that I'm used to it, but my first few times through the DVD I kept thinking ""who in their right mind picked this?!""

Overall I feel the results far outweighs my nit-picky complaints. It's not perfect but I would buy it again and I'd recommend it as long as you don't find the cons to be a big deal.",1522972800,,2175,4.2871046228710465

8310172,5,B001HZ4K7G,"I bought this DVD several years ago, and for some reason it just sat on the bottom of my stack of exercise DVD's.  I work out everyday -- yoga, pilates, strength -- always to DVD's that have become favorites.  I was becoming bored with some of the old favorites and decided to try this DVD. WOW! I LOVE it! Different from all my other pilates routines. She really shakes it up with added cardio, and we do some moves that I've not done before. I'm in pretty good shape, but she had my legs and abs shaking on a few moves.

I think when I first used it, I may not have been strong enough to keep up. This is not for beginners. I'm definitely strong enough now, and this is moving off the bottom of the stack right to the top.

Sorry I waited so long to discover what an excellent workout this is.",1469059200,5,795,4.109677419354838
8310173,5,B001HZ4K7G,"This video IS challenging but totally doable! I would consider myself intermediate with Pilates and therefore I did have to break the reps a couple times to take a few second break with a few of the moves, but then could get right back into it. It is a good mixture of cardio and Pilates. I wear a size 8 / 10 and my HRM monitor told me I burned 300 cals in an hour (not counting BMR, so in reality closer to 200 cals). She is not annoying like some other Pilates instructors and the video flows really well with the included warm up and cool down. If you are wondering whether you should buy it, do it! :)",1468454400,4,606,4.058333333333334

8310175,5,B001HZ4K7G,"Incredible.  I will be adding this to my ""rest days"" from my HIIT training. The lengthening exercises will help me improve my stretching.

I thought I was in good shape until I went through both segments (at different times) and found that I profusely sweated, but most importantly I felt great afterwards.

Excercise is an activity that rewards later not while doing it.",1466380800,,371,4.857142857142857
