7750941,3,B01FMFA3T0,Sound quality is very off on this bluray. It sounds like a wind tunnel almost when people are talking.  I love the movie itself though,1480982400,,134,4.36

8761103,4,B01FMFA3T0,"As a Pittsburgher, this movie is somewhat important, as it was filmed here and in nearby Kittanning, PA. Which is somewhat humorous, as Point Pleasant, WV isn't far at all. They could have just filmed it there. Theres a mothman statue, after all.

I usually don't enjoy big budget films, much less ones that take so many liberties with their source material, but this one always wins me over. Its worth a watch.",1535587200,,411,4.63013698630137
8761104,5,B01FMFA3T0,Another suspenseful thriller! It really keeps you guessing.,1522195200,,59,6.5
8761105,5,B01FMFA3T0,"I really liked this movie from many years ago, and I felt like I should have the blu-ray.  I just watched it again and it was much more spooky and scary than I remember it from before.  Maybe because now the picture quality is so good and the sound of course is perfect.  This movie could give adults nightmares!",1520553600,,312,4.254237288135593
8761106,5,B01FMFA3T0,Thanks,1508112000,,6,6.0
8761107,5,B01FMFA3T0,"There is something creepy about this movie from beginning to end. Maybe it is the unseen that is so riveting. Anyway, I have watched it 3 times and now I decided to buy the blu ray version. Great transfer. My only gripe is that some dialogues are pretty low, and some subtitles(in English) would come in mighty handy.",1502496000,,317,4.482758620689655
8761108,5,B01FMFA3T0,Just what I wanted.,1501632000,,19,4.0
8761109,5,B01FMFA3T0,Great film. Creepy as hell,1495497600,,26,4.4
8761110,4,B01FMFA3T0,"Such an amazing movie- for years my friends & I said this would benefit from the bluray treatment- & we weren't disappointed.
Love the story, the visuals, the framing, the focusing and the fades- & the top-notch score by Tomandandy is the perfect brooding backdrop.

But be prepared for a few random foreign subtitles to pop up.  4 times during the film, I believe.
It's fairly annoying, but doesn't make this unwatchable.  It may be an import, but until the original studio steps up & produces a better copy, this will do.",1487030400,2,523,4.663043478260869
8761111,5,B01FMFA3T0,"the picture is amazing. but I WISH it came with subtitles because the conversation is low. and as for the subtitles there ARE 2 one second glitches where subtitles DO appear... but they are not in English. LOL. 43 minute documentary on the mothman, music video, deleted scenes and trailer are included.",1485907200,4,302,4.826923076923077
8761112,5,B01FMFA3T0,"Mothman is a really great movie.  Well cast and very enjoyable.  FYI though, it is not sub-titled.  I kept my dvd copy for that.",1483660800,,128,4.25
