2005622,5,B0001J0VYA,"This 23rd installment of Zatoichi is highly recommended. As usual, we find Zatoicihi in another one of his wildly strange predictaments. And as usual, we find the amusingly funny, humorous and charming personality of Ichi in this film. There is more humor in this episode than most of his previous outings. Also, Zatoichi is taunted by a young orphan who believes that Ichi killed his mother. And this orphan constantly taunts Ichi. [namely by throwing rocks at him]

In this episode Zatoichi helps to deliver the baby of a dying mother.[He even tries to breastfeed the baby] All the while, Ichi attempts to locate the missing baby's father. And of course there is the never-ending confrontation with the ""bad-guys"" in this film. There is a festival going on in the town where Ichi goes to seek out the father of the baby. Zatoichi intercedes when the aunt of the baby is grabbed by a gang of thugs, who intend to place her into prostitution. But Ichi' cane-sword is too quick.

The humor in this episode is very evident throughout the film: especially when comedy routines are performed before an official in order to qualify for admission into the festival. [namely the monkey act] The film is very entertaining and one of the better ones in the series. Although I do like them all [I am a bit biased] For Zatoichi fans, you will not be disappointed, there is plently of Ichi's swordsmanship on display when he starts to clean up the town of ""bad guys."" And a very good ending in the film. Highly recommend. Enjoy!",1156896000,4,1516,4.695488721804511
2005623,5,B0001J0VYA,"I probably should not complain about the translation subtitles on this film. About 15 years ago I bought a bootleg of the film taped off the International Channel when the film was called ""Zatoichi's Duty"" and the DVD release shows that AnimEigo went the extra mile with their translation. Not only do they translate the theme song but all the credits, something not on the bootleg, and every now and then add an extra subtitle explaining a phrase or a Japanese custom. My problem was that the original bootleg copy translated the scene where the head Yakuza tries to buy out the local Constable as trying to buy his jitte from him. In Japanese culture the person who carries the jitte is the law, and if the Yakuza boss could get him to pass his jitte over to one of his henchmen then that henchman would be recognized as the local law officer. In the AnimEigo version all references to wanting to but the jitte are non existent. Instead you have a Yakuza boss trying to bribe the village Constable with no explanation what for. Perhaps AnimEigo felt that the jitte references would not be understood by western audiences.

Aside from that it is still a great Zatoichi film and ends with one of the bloodiest fights of the film series. And it also includes one of my favorite moments in all of the films.  **SPOILER** During the climatic sword fight, Zatoichi has been cutting down the Yakuza's three at a time, even getting those who had a wall between themselves and Ichi. Suddenly one of the Yakuza says ""Stand aside! I'll take care of him!"" [ on the AnimEigo version it is translated as ""Stand aside! I'll kill him!"" ] For a second it looks like this Yakuza will give Ichi some trouble, until he is cut down faster than the others were. The whole thing was pulled off with such swift timing that it is one of the funniest gags in the whole series.",1134086400,19,1852,4.508928571428571
2005624,4,B0001J0VYA,"The Zatoichi series, about a blind swordsman who travelled Japan and got into many adventures, were always a cut above the typical martian arts melodrama of the 60s/70s. More than most of their genre, they were character studies (with Katsu Shintaro bringing a likable quality to the title character) and, even more so, focused on plot. Action is actually kept to a minimum, particularly in this film, which will disappoint many viewers.
In ""Zatoichi at Large,"" (one of the last of the series), Zatoichi delivers the baby of a dying peasant and takes it to her relatives. However, he's soon accused of stealing the woman's money and the mob is out to get him.
The DVD from a company called AnimEgo present the film in absolutely stunning 2.35:1 widescreen. The colours are so ripe they almost burst off the screen, and image is very sharp. It's even watchable in the many very dark scenes. Sound is the original Japanese audio, with subtitles (they're multicoloured - nice touch). The liner notes are disappointing. They don't deal with production of the film so much as with 'fun facts' (the value of the currency discussed in the movie, the possibility of men breastfeading, etc.), along with a Katsu Shintaro biography. These are reprinted more or less in the production notes on the disc. Other extras include character biographies (which discusses their place in the film) and trailers for several Zatoichi movies and some entries of the ""Lone Wolf and Cub"" series.",1109203200,25,1470,4.931451612903226
2005625,3,B0001J0VYA,"Here are good things and bad things:

Good:

* Beautiful colors.

* Awesome song when Zatoichi is fighting 40 men.

* Zatoichi is surrounded by fire.

Bads:

* HORRIBLE fight choreoghraphy.

* NO action until the ending.

* Fast final fight.

* Zatoichi gets hit by a bunch of normal people.

Adios.",1101772800,,299,4.576923076923077

Cool music , A kid who throws rocks, funny monkey hiking antics ,some really dumb villians who don't know when to quit , a strange sounding guy with what appears to be silver teeth and more sword tricks from our friend Zatoichi.

8013171,5,B0001J0VYA,"As in nearly every entry of this series a wide spectrum of emotion is painted that leaves me awed. Shintaro is a master performer on many levels showing us crude fatous, bumbling hijinx, to viseral tenderness.

8013174,5,B0001J0VYA,"I love these unequivocal good vs evil Japanese sword play dramas.  Strong, interesting characters and stories that never fail to hold your interest.  Unlike so many hero action type movies, all of the Zatoichi films can be watched again and again without getting bored.  The entire 26 films plus the tv episodes Shintaro produced after the 26th film is a must have for any comprehensive DVD collection.",1403568000,,402,4.970149253731344
8013175,5,B0001J0VYA,"Rarer than a hen's tooth! Zaoichi finds... a policeman who is also decent human being.
Zatoichi's normal criticism of cops and gangsters as ""those who should who should feel shame, but instead walk with their heads held high under the sun!""  serves as Katsu's voice of warning from beyond the grave to our own society who now worship and revere those very bottom feeders.  The overlays of modern and traditional are well-blended in the unusual sound track and themes of the tumultuous 60's and early 70's. Zatoichi's advice to misguided little boys who throw rocks?  Profound!  Excelsior!",1389052800,,588,5.030927835051546

8013177,5,B0001J0VYA,"Blind masseur and master swordsman Zatoichi finds a robbed and fatally wounded pregnant woman.  Of course, he ends up delivering the baby and, sure enough, she dies - being fatally wounded. He takes the baby in search of its family, which as you know is the plot of a third of the movies by now, and finds the child's aunt.  The problem is she is about to be forced into prostitution for want of money.  Money the dead mother was bringing. Zatoichi, of course, does not have the money, but nobody believes him.  And the beat goes on.
Better than most of the films, not because of the plot, as much as the fast paced action and touch of humor that pops up here and there.  As you can see from some of the other reviews, this film, number 23(?) in the series has regained some of the energy and spark of the earlier films.",1312243200,2,820,4.264516129032258
