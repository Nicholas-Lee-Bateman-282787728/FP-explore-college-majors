It is an engrossing, gripping and an absolutely true representation of how Elia Kazan's great uncle escaped the brutal slavery of the Ottoman Empire's Muslim politico-religious oppression of it's ethnic non-Turk Armenian and Greek Christian subjects, ultimately bringing the family to America. The story is also a commonplace metaphor for the waves of immigrants coming to America during the early 20th Century. This movie will open wide eyes to the American Experience which for ideological reasons is purposely not taught in public primary, secondary school or higher education. That this public trust is studiously ignored or twisted by the public schools is a crime and should be prosecuted as an insidious form of soft subversion of our children's national heritage.

568470,5,6303113184,"Favorite Immigration Film of All Time
I got to speak to Elia Kazan about the making of this film.
I told him it was my favorite and he said ""mine too"" and told
me how he mortgaged his house to make this film.
Then he told me as an artist to never give in to discouragement.
He said something to the effect of : discouragement is a scourge to artists --
never give in to discouragement ---
and I've held this dear.

This film starts with ice-men, chipping ice from a mountain, and bringing the haul on a cart,
and ends with a shoeshine....
and every moment in between is glorious.

The nature of work / the sacrifice of immigrants / what it takes to survive / the boat to Ellis Island / living under oppression / restless drive / when to lie / how to adapt / how not to give in just to sit at the king's table....  it's all here

Bravo and thank you Elia Kazan

forever,

568550,5,6303113184,"If you were curious about the passion for justice that burns within films like 'On the Waterfront' and 'Gentlemen's Agreement', then you will find the answer in Elia Kazan's 'America, America', an epic story based on the experiences of his uncle, who escaped from Turkish-ruled Anatolia to make his way to the New World. The film is documentary-like in its superb location shooting, richly textured depictions of a remembered culture, and unflinching treatment of the political and ethnic conflicts from which the hero is fleeing. 'America' is an idea, not a place, in this film, which spends almost the entire time on the journey and only briefly attends to the arrival. Stories that are episodic and films that are epic in scope can fall into lulls of scenic or rhapsodic indulgence, in which the characters drop out of focus for a time. I think this is true of a film like Visconti's 'The Leopard'. Kazan's film never loses that focus, and yet we never tire of his characters. Part of the reason is the extraordinary intensity of Stathis Gialielis's portrayal of the hero, Stavros. Partly it's to do with the uniformly excellent cast playing the many characters he encounters on his journey. Partly it is Kazan's success in selling us on the dream itself. For anyone living in an 'immigrant country', today and for all time, this film explains what it means to want and seek a better life.

The transfer here is excellent. The extras (essentially a well-informed commentary) worthwhile. Made in 1963, it is in black and white.",1326672000,4,1529,4.880769230769231

568552,4,6303113184,"America, America (Warner Bros., 1963) was director Elia Kazan's sixteenth film.

With minorities facing increasing intolerance in 1890's Turkey, the Greek Topouzoglou family sends their oldest son, Stavros (Stathis Giallelis), from their village to Constantinople in the hope that he can establish the family in the safer environs of the city while Stavros secretly dreams of immigrating to the mythical America. Along the journey to the city, Stavros is robbed of his family's most valuable possessions by a comical rascal (Lou Antonio) and arrives at his cousin's rug store with only the clothes on his back. Stavros balks at his cousin's scheme to have him marry a wealthy merchant's unattractive daughter and begins working as a lowly hamal (porter) to buy passage to America. After months of back-breaking toil, he is robbed of his savings by a prostitute. Stavros associates with some anti-government rebels and is nearly killed in an ambush. He returns to his cousin and seems to agree to marry the daughter of merchant Aleko Sinnikoglou (Paul Mann). Stavros has feelings for the plain Thomna (Linda Marsh) and is tempted by the comforts of domesticity but won't be swayed from his goal. An older, wealthy, married American woman (Katherine Balfour), takes a shine to Stavros and arranges for his passage with the understanding he'll service her sexually while aboard ship. When her husband learns he's being cuckolded he tries to have the young Greek returned to Turkey, but Stavros takes the identity of a deathly sick Armenian friend (Gregory Rozakis) who jumps overboard so that Stavros may continue on. Stavros arrives at Ellis Island and shines shoes in New York City, working to bring his family to America.

Kazan based his novel, America, America (1962), and the film adaption on the journey of his uncle, Joe Kazan, who had a cameo in one of Kazan's early films; Boomerang. Although Kazan had tremendous input on several of his previous films' scripts, this was the first written entirely by himself. Filming was on location mainly in Greece. The breathtaking cinematography was done by the legendary Haskell Wexler. Giallelis's performance at times borders on the amateurish and his broken English is occasionally undecipherable, but his facial expressions are wonderfully dramatic. Kazan employed a large number of native non-actor extras who often sharply contrast with the Actor's Studio professionals. Linda Marsh breaks your heart as the rejected bride-to-be and deserved an Oscar nomination. Although she played a ""plain Jane"" in this film (those eyebrows!) Linda transformed into quite a beauty for her later work in television. Paul Mann is outstanding as the domineering but loveable future-father-in-law. The film won an Oscar for Best Art Direction and was nominated for Best Film, Best Director, and Best Screenplay.

America, America was Kazan's favorite film. It's extremely long at 168 minutes but I would have a hard time deciding what scenes to cut. This is a wonderful movie, an epic testament to the courage and determination of our immigrant ancestors who sought the promise of America, that barely misses as one of Kazan's masterpieces (Streetcar Named Desire, On the Waterfront, Baby Doll) mainly due to Giallelis's performance. Kazan thought Giallelis's genuinuity would overcome his shortcomings and he was almost right.

Kazan admirers were delighted that Warner Bros. finally released this film on DVD. Film historian, Foster Hirsch, provides an informative and infectiously enthusiastic commentary.",1322265600,3,3543,5.332737030411449
568553,5,6303113184,"This wonderful black & white film illustrates the conditions that led so many people in the turn of the 20th century to seek economic opportunity & a level social playing field in the U.S. The vast majority of immigrants came from Europe. Many were the poorest of the poor, the underdogs looking for a break. As shown in this film, they were people who, while not necessarily starving, never really had enough to eat. It was a strugle for existence day after day. Today these terrible circumstances are visited upon non-Europeans.

Writer-director-producer Elia Kazane was well acquainted with these problems & aspiratons. He fell out of favor with the 1950's Unamerican Activites Committee for his alleged involvement in left political organizations. His response to that was controversial, but no need to go into that. The point is, AMERICA, AMERICA is a deeply affective & subtle motion picture masterpiece.

It is a ""coming of age film"" as well. The sensitive young Greek protagonisdt experiences early betrayals that include robbery, b eatings & attempted murder committed against him. This causes him to harden & launches an almost maniacal obsession to immigrate to America. Eventually he marries a young woman (who's considered too ""plain"" to marry off) in order to get close to her father's money (for his passage, of course.) He overhears an intimater conversation between father & daughter that is charming in its simplicity & signs of mutual devotion between the pair. Our hero realizes that he is scheming against both & is sensitive enough to realizes that love is a thing of beauty & that his manipulations are cheapening it. Nonetheless his dream of going to America dominates his innate good nature.

The rest plays out with grace, excitment & a very satisfying sense of understanding the hero's motivation. He eventually makes good on a solemn pledge to bring his entire family over to The Land of Dreams.",1322265600,,1923,5.040880503144654

568587,4,6303113184,"Yes, the Amazon description of the DVD aspect ratio is incorrect. The DVD is in Widescreen at 16:9 length to height ration [matching the widescreen TV].

The picture quality of the DVD is very good. Compared with that recently shown on TV [Turner Classic Movie], the DVD looks sharp, and rich in contrast and shadow details.

Now the issue of aspect ratio. Like the earlier review by Lenze, I originally thought the DVD would have to cut the top and bottom of the original frame in order to make 'widescreen' because the film was not shot in native 'widescreen' format, as some of the production notes on this movie indicated.

BTW do you remember the time when TV showed Gone with the Wind in widescreen format it got badly criticized for showing 'less' picture than the original 1939 version? After that, later broadcast of that film turned back to the 'full screen' ratio.

So, when I viewed this DVD I paid close attention to the picture framing, and then compare shot by shot of this DVD version with the copy I made from TCM broadcast.

I confirm, Mr. Lenze you are right. Your guess is also probably true: meaning the film might have been shot at the 1.66 to 1 ratio. (no proof yet).

What I like to point out is that the visual contents in the discrepancy between the 1.33:1 (4x3), 1.66:1(3x5) and 16x9 are almost composed as the 'edge' of the picture. Meaning without them, the composition does not suffer.

What does that REALLY mean?
Let me try to explain:
I read some where that many directors and cinematographers were/are fully aware of co-existence of widescreen format and full-frame format, so when they shot the film they use this ""OPEN MATTE"" method [You may like to fine what that means on Wikipedia by type in ""Open Matte""] in their framing.

As as a result if the final print is not exactly the same aspect ration as the film stock, the picture will not loss important or critical content of the story, nor suffer the aesthetic intention.

So, some of the great directors perfected in their framing of the film so it would still look great in different kind of aspect ratios. Examples: John Huston's ""Moby Dick"", and his last film ""the Dead"".
Stanley Kubrick and Robert Altman also did the same.

So, this DVD is not made as 'Widescreening' of ""Gone with the Wind"" (which is like the equivalent to a 'pan and scan' in reverse order), nor as bad as Pan-Scanning "" Lawrence of Arabia"". It is an acceptable result of shoe-honing a film into widescreen version given the fact that Kazan knew the art of  composition well when he made the film.",1304121600,2,2561,4.594298245614035
568588,3,6303113184,"This isn't really a review of the DVD - I just wanted to point out something curious about the DVD's aspect ratio.  Contrary to Amazon's Product Details section, the film is presented in a 16:9 ratio.  This contrasts with the previous Greek version, which was presented in a 4:3 ratio.  The curious thing is that neither version provides the entire picture.  This version has picture on the sides that the Greek version doesn't, and the Greek version has picture on the top and bottom that this version doesn't.  It's possible that the movie was filmed with a 5:3 (1.66:1) ratio, and both DVD versions chop off some picture.  (Wikipedia echoes this, but provides no source for the information.)

568591,4,6303113184,"""America America"" is not one of director Elia Kazan's most famous films.  Far more popular with critics and audiences are the Kazan classics ""A Streetcar Named Desire,"" ""Gentleman's Agreement,"" and ""On the Waterfront.""  But ""America America"" is perhaps Kazan's most personal film.

Based on his own best-selling novel about his uncle's life, the film portrays the American immigrant experience.  Young Stavros (Stathis Giallelis) leaves his war-torn Turkish homeland to begin a new life.  Fortified with his family's small fortune and his father's blessing, Stavros encounters both allies and adversaries.  He eventually achieves his dream through perseverance and will, earning the nickname ""America America.""

There are no stars in this movie, which is part of the reason it has not attracted large audiences.  But there is a raw reality about the movie precisely because the actors are not familiar faces.  We believe them as the characters they're portraying.  ""America America"" received Oscar nominations for Best Picture, Director, and Screenplay, and won an Oscar for Art Direction.

Mr. Giallelis is excellent as the central character.  He conveys Stavros' determination and spirit while also showing the young man's innocence when removed from his parochial life.

At two hours and 48 minutes, the movie is overly long; Kazan lingers on scenes that could have been shortened or eliminated completely.  Real cinematic poetry is achieved when the ship Stavros shares with hundreds of other immigrants approaches Ellis Island and the Statue of Liberty comes into view.  Kazan shows reactions to that moment in close-ups as Manos Hadjidakis' score dramatically highlights the emotions of the newcomers to America.

The only bonus feature on this DVD release is commentary by film historian Foster Hirsch.",1297814400,5,1809,5.4765342960288805
568592,5,6303113184,"Despite his lengthy and celebrated career directing major Hollywood productions, Elia Kazan took a major risk with ""America America"".  Nearly three hours in length, it takes its time exploring the world of an oppressed population of Anatolian Greeks with such authenticity that it feels entirely like a foreign film.  There are no well-known stars in the cast of this intimate black and white epic.  Even the musical score is the creation of a Greek composer, performed almost entirely with the traditional instruments that characterize Greek folk music.  If you have seen archival photographs of early 20th Century immigrants, you will recognize how painstakingly Kazan and his brilliant cinematographer, Haskell Wexler labored to capture the look and feel of the period.  As he did once before with ""Viva Zapata"", Kazan assembled a group of actors whose physical appearances are so strikingly appropriate to the characters which they portray that it is almost unbelievable that these players are also fabulously gifted artists.  Again and again, they deliver those richly detailed and dramatically powerful performances that one expects to find in this director's films.  The young unknown, Stathis Giallelis, who plays the leading role was reportedly subjected to a harrowing ordeal as Kazan unrelentingly fought to elicit  consistently intense, committed acting from him throughout a lengthy, grueling shooting schedule.  The resulting film exudes that rare feeling that it has captured something so close to the look and feel of the people, their world and their time that one often finds it hard to believe that this is actually a dramatization, created many decades after the events depicted.  ""America America"" may not suit those who are accustomed to today's faster paced movie-fare.  If you can patiently give yourself over to the spell of this picture and let its richly detailed evocation of a world very different from ours today, the film will likely provide you with a unique and powerful viewing experience that you will never forget.  The sense that it conveys of the terrible price so many people had to pay to make it to the U. S. is something that has seldom been achieved, before or since its release.",1297123200,8,2222,5.19327731092437
568593,5,6303113184,"I first saw this film in Haskel Wexler's cinematography class at UCLA when I was a student there in the late 60's and would just like to comment that the film had the most intense, tonally rich palette of black and white I have ever seen (to this day) in a film. The only comparison would be to some Ansel Adams prints. In addition to a riveting story, do yourself a favor and see this on a first-class home theater system to experience the visual poetry of a great cinematic master.",1293926400,4,483,4.318681318681318
568594,5,6303113184,"Perhaps Elia Kazan's most moving work.  It traces they journey of a Greek boy from rural Anatolia, entrusted with all the riches the family has gathered, who is tasked to go to America in order to start a new life for his family.  It is set in the time of the persecution of the Greeks and the Armenians.  His moral dilemmas as to what compromises he has to make in order to reach his goal are thought provoking for any one who has come from immigrant stock.

The cast is totally authentic, the lead actor is a remarkable young man.  This fascinating, earthy  and emotional film is one of the best -- and until now very difficult to find anywhere.  I got one copy on E-Bay from Athens.

The only comparable film might be the Canadian film  Ararat which concerns the Armenian massacres.  But America America has such immediacy, and such gifted black and white  photography.  I first watched this film in the wardroom of a US destroyer and we were approaching  the Dardanelles in the dear of the night.  It was 1965.",1291161600,4,1014,4.469945355191257

Though I'd seen it once before on TV, I was just as blown away by it as if I were seeing it for the first time.  Unforgettable in every way.  Like others, I'm also frustrated by the lack of an American DVD release of it.  There are, however, several sellers in Greece who are offering an NTSC(I think) DVD of it.  I just received my copy yesterday.  Though it doesn't play in my own DVD player (I know very little about region codes), it does play very nicely on my PC.

The Turks, she said, killed the remaining Christian men and boys in my city. In my father-in-law's large city of Maras, some 99% of the Christians were killed or ""deported"", most to the dry Syrian desert by 1921, or the lucky few excaped at night south to Syria as did my father-in-law after his parents and all siblings but one were slaughtered (he was 15 then). The major murders of the Christians occurred beginning in April 1915 to 1916 and again in Jan. 1920 - some few thousand managed to excape to Syria.

It is rightfully called a masterpiece by many.

The characters are very believable and interesting. One can feel the absolute frustration in the main character. He is an individual with obvious flaws which make him ever so much human and not some 2 dimensional hero. Along his struggle-filled journey, he meets a kaleidoscope of other complex characters, all very well portrayed.

The soundtrack is very evocative yet very subtle and adds just the right flavor to the movie like oregano to spaghetti sauce.

The pace of the movie is at times slow, at times fast but the tempo is always appropriate for the scene.

568642,5,6303113184,"I myself like Stavros the hero of 'America america' set upon an adventure filled with hardship and pain and found salvation in America. You see this film is one of the most underated pieces of cinema ever to pass through a film reel, and finding a copy ( especially in England) is akin to a herculian task. It took me several months to find out it was never released over here under its origional title and was never released on video. So i set my sights across the pond and found it on amazon. This is my tale.
Thankfully stavros's tale is more entertaining than mine and Kazan is more skillful in his presentation of it than I of mine. Kazan tells the personnal tale of his uncles journey from turkey to america. kazan excells when working from his own experiences and this film is no exception. kazan really understands the leads plight and his emotional connection shines through and rubs off on the viewer, you cant help but be affected by his plight.
The film is espesially relevant now in the uk, as our newspapers are clogged with biased debates on britains liberal imergration laws, i wish there waas a national re-release of this picture so to educate people on the truth behind many refugees, it creates a true sympathy that would be as moving today as then.
Critically this film did well and many directors such as scorsese rate it as inspirational, but it isn't a well known film and that upsets me, so buy it and love it and make me happy

It is a universal story, an epic one, and a great motion picture too, perhaps one of the best, and it is the story of Elia Kazan's life.  But for the fact that Kazan was banished from the industry for ""naming names,"" for being a ""police informer,"" this picture no doubt would have won many Oscars, including best picture of the year.  But ""Tom Jones"" beat it out --a wonderful picture too, but not anywhere near Kazan's ""America America"" for insight, depth, and a real claim to an American hisory --the story of what America was all about to those ""wretched refuse of your teaming shore"" in 1900.

7838545,4,6303113184,"Elia Kazan tells the long, episodic story of how his Greek uncle, called Stavros (Stathis Giallelis), made the tortuous journey from the interior of troubled Turkey to Istanbul, and finally across the sea to Ellis Island and New York City.  Along the way, he meets a con-man called Abdul who steals almost everything Stavros has and drives him to violence.  In Istanbul, he is mentored by a revolutionary (John Marley, who played Woltz in ""The Godfather""), is nearly killed, and improves his lot by agreeing to marry a rich Greek carpet merchant's daughter.  But nothing will stay him from his mission to get himself to the New World.  The movie requires some patience to stick with the tale of Stavros' travels and shifting fortunes, but it is an epic look at the kind of personal and political tumult that drove so many people to risk everything and spend all their meager capital for a chance to make a new life in America.  Especially impressive are the views of 1898 Turkey, with dark mustached horse soldiers thundering through the villages and worrying the Greek and Armenian citizens, the taverns with the hookah smoking men in fezzes, the churches filled with frightened women in black dresses like crows, the buildings looking so severe with their ancient walls and furnished with dark wood furniture.  Haskell Wexler captures the towns and the rugged mountains and valleys of Turkey in ultra-sharp black and white widescreen compositions.
