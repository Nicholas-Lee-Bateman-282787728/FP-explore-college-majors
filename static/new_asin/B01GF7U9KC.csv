8762803,3,B01GF7U9KC,"I was hoping for a bit more depth, but this turned out to be mostly a hagiography by adoring friends.  Well made as this film making team always do (see I am Chris Farley).. but the glossy love fest left me with a ""People Magazine"" sort of feeling.  Too bad in my opinion because I think the subject deserved much much more.",1485302400,3,324,4.209677419354839
8762804,2,B01GF7U9KC,"Mostly shows people who knew him saying the same things over and over.  Photos and videos shown but not put into any context.  He was a hero of mine but this bored me to death.
I would love to see a documentary starting when he was born and maybe including things that he had to say about his own life.  This one is just a disappointment.",1482883200,2,338,4.090909090909091
8762805,5,B01GF7U9KC,Absolutely wonderful documentary!,1481587200,,33,10.333333333333334
8762806,4,B01GF7U9KC,I loved JFK Jr.  This didn't disappoint.  He truly seemed like the best of men.  I was disappointed that there were no captions.  I had a hard time trying to make out everything that was said.,1477440000,2,192,4.25
8762807,5,B01GF7U9KC,Very good documentary on the life of JFK Jr. I've been interested in the Kennedy family for many years. This film gives a detailed look on who John was beyond the headlines.,1476144000,6,173,4.4375
8762808,3,B01GF7U9KC,"This would have been much more appealing and credible had it not included three authors who have appointed themselves Kennedy family insiders.  In many minds, they are simply journalistic paparazzi.  Additionally, the fact that Michael Reagan considers himself in the same league as John F. Kennedy, Jr. makes this tragic story comedic.  He is far, far from it and somehow manages to bring himself into the story on that level at every opportunity.",1475971200,4,448,5.109589041095891
8762809,5,B01GF7U9KC,Why did he have to die?  So unfair! He had everything beauty & grace but not life.,1473638400,,82,3.823529411764706
8762810,5,B01GF7U9KC,"An overpowering look at the life of John, Jr.  Shows exactly why he was easily considered American Royalty and at the same time shows a man who, in spite of his wealth and good looks seemed humble and only wanted to do something to make this world a better place.  Sadly his life was cut short and we can only be left wondering what might have been, what he might have accomplished if he had had more time on this planet. We can ask so many questions.",1472860800,5,451,4.172413793103448
