540183,5,6303052606,"This little known classic was the most expensive Japanese film production of the early `80s, and one of the finest disaster movies ever made. Virus is massive in scale, with an epic, end-of-the-world plot that marries the best aspects of Michael Crichton's The Andromeda Strain with the desperate post-apocalyptic action of The Day After Tomorrow.",1147392000,14,347,5.327272727272727

540187,3,6303052606,"End of the world movies like VIRUS each have something to say about how humanity may face its demise.  Director Kinji Fukasaku presents an apocalypse that need not have happened and did happen only because of man's limitless capacity for suicidal genocide.  A lethal virus named MM88 has been secretly developed by the American military in response to projected danger from the USSR.  This virus was intended only as a warning to the Kremlin not to launch a first strike.  A vial of the virus is stolen and accidentally released into the open air.  The results are immediate and lethal.  First, tens of millions, then hundreds of millions sicken and die.  The only survivors are limited to Antarctica, where intense cold inhibits the virus' spread.  A search party is sent to Washington DC to hold off a delayed nuclear strike at Moscow that would in turn cause a delayed and automatic strike at many targets, including Antarctica.
VIRUS is an odd yet effective thriller that combines ON THE BEACH, 28 DAYS, THE ANDROMEDA STRAIN, and FAIL SAFE.  Considering that VIRUS was a Japanese production, it is startling to tick off the big name Hollywood stars: Glenn Ford, Robert Vaughn, Chuck Connors, and Olivia Hussey.  Scenes of world wide chaos, martial law, and civil unrest we have seen before, but in a weird way, the grainy film style complements, rather than detracts from, the sobering end of humanity.  There are no villains in this film, although there are several heroes.  In such a foreboding film as VIRUS, the focus is less on the characterization and more on the unsettling themes present.  Each theme is an offshoot of the Biblical Apocalypse.  The impact on the viewer is cumulative.  The slight note of optimism that concludes the film does nothing to eliminate the deadening weariness that punctuates nearly every frame.  VIRUS is the kind of film that brings to mind nearly every way that human beings can self-immolate.  It is one of the few science fiction films that dares to say this and ought to be taken seriously.",1066003200,13,2036,4.855072463768116
540188,4,6303052606,"I was thrilled to not only find this DVD listed here, but to find the uncut, 155 minute version.  But unfortunately, even though it is listed on the package, and on this site, as 155 minutes, it isn't -- this is the 103 minute international cut of the film.  Still, this is a great film, and includes the dialog with the corpses in the church that was cut from the television version.  I just wish someone would release the Japanese cut on DVD in the U.S.
The quality of this DVD isn't so great.  The picture is grainy and the sound isn't very good.  But it's not terrible, and again, I was happy just to get this film on DVD.

I really like this film, in spite of some of the implausable ideas like a single person being able to arm our nuclear arsenal. However, this particular  video being sold (which I bought and have just now viewed) is MASSACRED!  It looks & sounds like someone set up a camcorder in their living room  & taped the movie off their TV. The sound is TERRIBLE, the framing cuts  off any captions & subtitles, and, to add insult to injury, they CUT  OUT the last 10 minutes of the film showing the journey back to the  survivors in Antartica -- it ends with the world being destroyed by the  nuclear explosions!

I believe the title change is why the description is inaccurate.  No virus is spread by any missile.

It is a good ensemble apocalypse film, but the terrible pan scan transfer ruins the special effects and second unit filming.

540424,3,6303052606,"I liked it. It's an apocalyptic movie, showing the trouble that comes about from war.

This was a 1980 movie from Japan and reminded me of the 1970's movies that tried to teach us lessons about global humankind issues like: government run amuck, use of bacterial warfare, overpopulation, etc. Lessons like these were in movies from the 1970's like Roller Ball, Andromeda Strain, Logan's Run, Soylent Green. I'm just saying this movie reminded me of these 1970's movies that tried to teach lessons (this movie isn't similar to Roller Ball except for that it's trying to teach a lesson). It seems to be a movie meant to educate us that we are currently making mistakes which could endanger the human race.

The theme of this movie seemed to be that war is bad. The biological agent started the apocalypse, the cold war and nuclear arsenal almost sterilized the Earth of human kind. None of this would have happened without the cold war preparations. Even if we one had one of the two cold war preparations, survival would have been easier.

This movie was most like 1970's Andromeda Strain, which had military looking for a biological weapon in space, they found it, it was deadly, a nuclear self-destruct almost went off which would have made the new life form grow. Andromeda Strain moved along faster than Virus.

People have to struggle to survive.

There was a lot of stars in it, It had some exotic scenery. The acting was ok. I said the acting was just ""ok"" because I think some of the 1970s movies actors were a little off (just for my taste). It did run a bit slow for my taste.

The Japanese version goes on too long about dr. imugachi's wife, and a few scenes that are anti American and British that are pointless. Sonny Chiba is only in about less than a minute of this. The U.S. military invents MM88 the ultimate killer virus, is stolen twice, and exposed to the open air by a plane crash. Most of the world dies except an arctic American military base containing several hundred men and only 8 women. It is learned the virus is dormant in subzero temperatures. A Japanese base in the same area and a British sub have all joined with the Americans. While looking for a cure, A Japanese scientist figures out that a huge earthquake will soon hit Washington D.C. that will set off nukes that are pointed at Russia, which would retaliate and hit among other U.S. targets, the arctic base! An impossible mission is planned to enter the white house bunker and disarm before it is too late! Although a bummer, Virus inspires hope, is so exciting and interesting that you can't stop watching. George Kennedy, and many of the other well known cast do very well. Bo Svenson gave great support and figured prominantly in the action. Henry Silva is impressive as the crazed, war mongering general. Chuck Connors as the British sub captain, saves the day by bombing a Russian sub intent on beaching its infected crew at the base in his great introductory scene. As the central character, Masao Kusakari as the physicist, easily gets our sympathy and gives a very heartfelt performance. Kinji Fukasaku proves with this and many other movies that he is a brilliant film maker. The soundtrack beautifully complements every scene.

The first few Star Wars movies even had that cheesy ""waiting for a commercial"" feel to them.

540619,4,6303052606,"Life on Earth faces extinction in Virus (1980), a Japanese production, shot in English, that features a predominantly western cast.  Directed by Kinji Fukasaku (,), the science fiction adventure features many familiar names from the era, including Glen Ford, Robert Vaughn, Henry Silva, George Kennedy, Chuck Connors, Bo Svenson, Cecil Linder, and Olivia Hussey, as well as many Asian actors, including Masao Kusakiri, Ken Ogata, and Sonny Chiba.

Set in 1983, a deadly bio-weapon is accidentally released, and quickly spreads, killing most of the worlds population, including those in Japan and the United States.  The virus goes dormant in cold temperatures, and military and scientific personnel stationed at the bases of various nations in Antarctica have survived, and are gathered at Palmer Station, along with the crew of a Royal Navy submarine, who have fortunately managed to avoid contamination.

Although safe for the moment, the group is apparently facing obliteration from another source, as an earthquake that will destroy Washington D.C, is eminent.  The destruction of the US capitol will trigger an automated nuclear strike against the Soviet Union, which in turn will cause an automated retaliatory Soviet attack, that has Palmer Station targeted for destruction.  The chances for success are small, but the sub leaves Antarctica for Washington DC, in an attempt to prevent the launching of the missiles, while an icebreaker with a few select survivors leaves for Argentina.

Originally titled Day Of Retribution, the movie had a runtime of 156 minutes, and at the time was one of the more costly Japanese movie productions.  Heavily edited and released in America as Virus, the abridged version is just 109 minutes, but is still a pretty edgy thriller, where civilization is quickly reduced to small remnants.  Finishing at Tierra del Fuego in Argentina, Virus may include most of the key scenes, and is still an impactful film, however with so much missing, and with little character development, the flow seems a bit choppy at times, as Fukasaku clearly had much more to say.

Although there are some big names in the cast, many are among the victims who make an early exit.  In the second half, Connors, Svenson, Kennedy, Musakiri, Hussey, and Linder, carry the film.

With a rating of 3.5 stars, Virus is well worth a watch for Prime members, although the image quality is far from great.  Those interested in the film Fukusaku really intended to make, should probably seek out the full length release&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Day-of-Retribution/dp/B004F7O8XE/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Day of Retribution</a>.",1362787200,,2683,5.467312348668281

The only real survivors are in the Antarctic 800 men and 8 women. They discover that there will be an earthquake near Washington DC and that will set off the US's nuclear attack system and if that goes off then the Russian system will go off. The film is a decent study of what might happen if such a thing occurred and probably closer to the truth of what might actually happen than most American made disaster movies.

540623,5,6303052606,"A good news, everyone:  Amazon has now carries the newly published original Sakyo Komatsu's 'VIRUS,' has been translated into English on a hard cover book format.  Look for and find it in Amazon's literature section or in the recomemdations or the related matterial section at the bottom or above this review section.

Now, this is the point where my original revew begins:

Please DO NOT under rate the movie 'VIRUS' before you watch this DVD.  It's an almost completely new movie with much greater in geological, scientifical, and even political aspects of the decade of '80s.  For those of you have been deeply disappointed by the erlier, edited, shortened version of the film, now it's the time to fully appriciate the movie.

I really feel relieved when I watched this DVD, which had been professionally prepared from the original Japanese mortion picture released back in 1982 in such a superb quality, knowing this the the way in which everyone of us should have watched. The DVD presentation contains the entire 156 minutes of the original Japanese feature length of the same tittle based on the late famous Japanese Science Fiction writer Mr. Sakyo Komatsu of 'Sinking of Japan' in the late 1970s.

The aspect ratio of the DVD image is the right match of the original movie, as well as the entire original sound track of music scores of Italian composer of Teo Masero.  The scerenaries of the Antartica are brathtaking and absolutely beautiful.  I believe this is the first comarcially produced movie/drama shot on locationed there, with full cooperation of Chillian Navy submarine: Yes, that sub was a real one!  Sound quality was good, too.

Speaking of the music, I must point out the fact that the beautiful and very lyrical original theme song of the movie was written and sung by Janis Ian. Listening into her song alone might bring tears in your eyes. It's that emortional song and music.

I do recomend this DVD to everyone or anyone, especially to whom thought the 'VIRUS' was a less important SciFi movie made with a B- or C-level  or less-than-the average production.  I asure you that it would give you a whole new impression of the movie.  One last note: Please remember this fact that the original novel on which this movie was based, was written about some 40(yes, that's right, fourty) years ago:  It was when no one cared or even knew about a biological warfare or the pandemic using or caused by a simple virus. I think it was written even before 'The Andromeda Strain"" by Micheal Criton in the late '60s or the early '70s.  The entire story and all events were taken place inside of one geneus, a science fiction writer called Sakyo Komatsu.",1339891200,13,2669,4.777777777777778

540675,4,6303052606,"A double disaster film with both an American and a Japanese cast, Virus presents some pretty wild probabilities to viewers. First of all, a virus has been developed that gets loose and starts to destroy humanity on a grand scale. The only people who are remotely safe are a group of eight hundred men and eight women on Antarctica. Since the President of the United States warns them by radio communications not to accept anyone into their area who has been contaminated, the men and women are somewhat prepared. That does not mean they are ready to handle the crew of a Russian submarine that seeks refuge with them. The second disaster is nuclear, and part of the suspense lies in whether or not it will be ultimately averted -- and who, if any, will survive all this. ~ Eleanor Mannikka, All Movie Guide

Directed by Kinji Fukasaku and starring Masao Kusakari, George Kennedy, Robert Vaughn, Chuck Connors, Olivia Hussey, Edward James Olmos, Ken Ogata, Sonny Chiba and Glenn Ford. The film is notable for its fine cinematography and for being the most expensive Japanese film ever made at the time (1980).",1213488000,4,1121,4.808290155440415
540676,3,6303052606,"My only complaint about 'Virus' is that I got a copy that was shortened by a good 40-plus minutes and is not in widescreen ... and so at times it felt like I was watching a pan and scan movie that had been liberally edited.  However, the good news is that 'Virus', even suffering from these handicaps, is still good.  The movie (made in the great decade of movies like this -- the 80s) involves the theft and eventual accidental release of a virus so lethal, it wipes out everyone in the world ... except for a few explorers and military types in the arctic.  These survivors must band together and find ways to keep going.  The great twist is that, in the 80s, many nations didn't get along but still had exploration stations grouped near one another in the arctic ... Russians and South Americans and French and Americans must fight their dislike for each other and learn to, well, get along.  And that proves to be really fascinating, especially when a Russian commander orders the destruction of one of his own submarines because it might be infected -- and so the Americans gladly help out by torpedoing the sub to the bottom of the ocean (who said the Americans and Russians couldn't get along).  This movie is a whos who of disaster movie royalty -- George Kennedy (and let's be honest, if it has George Kennedy, you know you're gonna like it), Chuck Connors (being manlier than man), Henry Silva (the budget movie weirdo), Glenn Ford and Robert Vaughn and Olivia Hussey (sadly Olivia is kind of wasted in this one, but she's still beautiful ... just the kind of woman you want to gaze upon as a deadly virus wipes out the planet).  This is a Japanese movie and so the metaphysics and the actual action get mixed up into something that kind of resembles poetry some times.  The other times, the movie has you riveted as it moves along at a breakneck pace (part of that pacing may be the 40 minutes of editing).  Again, a widescreen version of this obviously epic movie would have been nice, as well as the entire movie ... but for the price and for the resulting movie, it is still a good deal.  And again, it's got George Kennedy ... the grand old man of disaster.  That's worth a look.",1210982400,2,2194,4.46

540680,4,6303052606,"Just to be clear, those 4 stars are for the FILM - not for this disc!

Directed in 1980 by the late Kinji Fukasaku (Battle Royale) this apocalyptic film basically exists in two versions: the 'international' version (108 mins) and the full-length Japanese version (155 mins).

I discovered this film languishing on one of those 50-film DVD compilations and found it to be a real diamond in the rough. Despite the appalling quality of the pan & scan print, the film shone.

Intrigued enough to want to find a good-quality DVD of this film, I came across this disc, which was the only standalone version out there. Reviews said that the picture quality wasn't great, and the print was still pan & scan, but at least this disc included a few minutes of additional material missing from the version I'd seen. It was cheap, so I went for it. And, sure enough, there was a little bit of extra material in this version - but the picture quality was just as bad. Blurry, cropped, and horrible. Some scenes are even anamorphically squashed ... the sun is not normally an egg-shaped oval - but here it is! :(

In 2002 Japan received a superb 2-disc DVD release of this film containing both versions. Sadly this was a limited edition. Don't bother looking for it - chances are you won't find it, and, besides, the full-length Japanese version wasn't of much use to us Western viewers as (unsurprisingly) most of the additional scenes are in Japanese with no English subtitles available.

To cut to the chase, leave this disc be. Instead, scroll up to the search bar at the top of this page and type in 'Sonny Chiba Action Pack' :) There you'll find the full-length 155 minute Japanese version of 'Virus' on Region 1 DVD in a sparkling widescreen print, with excellent picture and sound quality, and (removable) English subtitles for the occasional Japanese-language scenes.
