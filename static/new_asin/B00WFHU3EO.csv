8713226,5,B00WFHU3EO,"I bought Snow Girl and the Dark Crystal and somehow this was bootlegged on the disc instead of the movie (disc printing showed the Snow Girl label) ... imagine my surprise, instead of watching a nice asian flick i have a documentary about a cruise ... i played the first chapter to see if maybe it was a wierd menu (since i never heard of deep sea blues) and it was all talk, boy was i mad ... then i was listening to the music on the menu page and it sounded very good (i love blues guitar) and thought maybe i would give it a try later on ... well i watched another movie and got back to this a couple of days later and was wowed by the music being played ... some very very good blues guitarist ... yes, there was too much talking, escpecially in the middle of some songs, way too much video of old folks watching the band (who wants to see mid 60 year olds in two piece swimsuits dancing in a pool?), shameful plugs about the cruise and of course a couple of the tracks had no guitarist ... but when they played, it was music to my ears, and since most of the artist are not famous enough to have their own movies or even cd's available, it was a good chance to catch some rare footage of these artists ... so i will keep it, and get my snow girl some other time ...",1441584000,,1270,4.003937007874016
