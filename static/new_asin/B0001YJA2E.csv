2043265,5,B0001YJA2E,"I heard about USA the Movie through Democratic Underground while I was searching for media materials to use for my Non-Violent action curriculum. I wanted to utilize a broad spectrum of video and text resources to engage the students in my course. This film is a great example of a visceral and idiosyncratic way to present historical issues. I am using it along with some of the more clear-cut documentary style video pieces that are available to give the students a taste of the wide variety of ways that they can learn and get involved. Projects like this film inspire young people to express themselves in their own voice without feeling intimidated by standard styles. There's nothing more important than making kids feel that they too have something to say and that they have the freedom to say it.
This movie definitely takes you on a trip. It's almost psychedelic in its approach and demands focus and attention (something that's important to teach young people these days in the post MTV hyper-stimulated world). It ends with an unrelenting list of grim statistics about war, violence and domination and Gandhi's plea to ""live simply that others may simply live"". Whatever the reaction may be from each student regarding the film I'm sure it will start a heated and fruitful discussion.",1089158400,3,1295,4.917808219178082
2043266,5,B0001YJA2E,"This film made me really think about why we are at war. Even though with the hand over of power (supposedly) we are not technically at war anymore, people continue to be killed for some vague reason. I think that there are too many films that try to distract us rather than to teach us. This film with its complex images and clear message says ""Why do we kill each other?, why are we obsessed with war?""  I felt really emotional after watching it, especially hearing the audio from 9/11 which was very odd and different.",1089072000,,520,4.416666666666667
2043267,5,B0001YJA2E,"There's lots of movies and TV shows that mix real life and fiction these days but most of them are boring and don't have any creativity. They're all geared to some stupid, dumbed down ""average"" audience member. It gets seriously frustrating. This movie does something different, which is one of the main reasons I liked it so much. It used truth and fiction in a way that I haven't seen mixed together before. You're following the main character ""Jim"" (James Kirk--I still wonder if that was his real name or some kind of popular culture reference), as he travels through Post September 11 America but what he's always listening to on his radio is news that goes back and forth in a different order of time than the way things actually happened.
By the time he gets to Ground Zero, after visiting the Flight 93 crash site and the partly wrecked Pentagon, Jim's already going a little crazy from all the things he's seen and the contradictions he's heard. Then comes Bush's speech that led us into war , but it comes while Jim is seeing what is left of the Two Towers. So the film has true events and people and places but it plays with time. You end up watching this weird and surreal world we've ended up in since the Turn Of The Century but with a completely different rhythm than we lived it.
What I also thought was great was the way that music is used in the film. It is very low key but it touches something emotionally so that sometimes you're not even sure why you're feeling the way you are feeling.
Fahrenheit 9/11 will be the big blockbuster film that deals with all these things this year-- kind of  a Rock Superstar playing stadiums, but USA The Movie is more like a great acoustic band playing a club where you actually get to see the performers up close.  You're going to want to experience both.",1087516800,2,1811,4.451807228915663
2043268,5,B0001YJA2E,"Here's a short list of people I'm into: Amy Goodman, Howard Zinn, Martin Luther King, Jello Biafra and Sam Hamill. Here's a movie that has them all in it and more.  Their voices are major part of this film. Even Dubya and Joe McCarthy have their say but it's a free country, right? This is a totally original feeling movie.
 Honestly  being from San Francisco, I never thought I'd live to see the day when a film (okay an independent DVD) like this would exist.
It was also visually very different than any other video projects I've seen. It didn't have the usual documentary feel to it at all. In fact, it's not a documentary but it has a great deal of ""real""  elements in it. Still, it felt more ""filmic"" than not.
The story takes place in present day America with all the craziness that implies. There is a strong emphasis on the tragedy of September 11th as the main character goes through a transformation that takes him from a RV driving, easy living American to a devastated soul trapped in an Apocalyptic landscape. He acts as our eyes and ears, At first he is blind and deaf to the plight of others being killed, displaced and bombed in retribution for 9/11; then as he has a sort of awakening it drives him to insanity.  We should all be so lucky.
I haven't seen any film take on this time of war this way. It leaves you feeling terrified by what human beings are capable of doing and how we're capable of so much violence despite our hopes for Peace On Earth.",1084579200,,1470,4.3699633699633695
2043269,5,B0001YJA2E,"First, I am not a Bush supporter.  I watched the DVD yesterday and since then I had time to think about the upcoming election.  USA is a disturbing movie and equally fascinating.  I started to watch it and immediately I got sucked in the story, the main character, the people, the humor, the sorrow and especially the radio.  The sound is excellent (not what you're used to) it's well designed and naturally subtle.  I own a good system but I discovered that the movie plays better without any compression, as is.  I have to admit that I am not a political guru but the movie played each disaster in a way that won't allow you to forget and presented the facts with ease and simplicity.  Above all, I've changed my mind about Bush. (I don't think that is the intention of this film)  Here is why:  I've never heard Bush give speeches like this.  His words accompanied with Music bring out this man's essence and compassion.  He really went through hell since he got in office.  The movie plays his inauguration speech and it really shows how much he cares.  I truly believe him despite what the media or any other candidate tries to reflect on his behavior.  This movie is exciting and I will see it over and over.  Over all, I really recommend it!",1084320000,3,1248,4.460176991150442
2043270,5,B0001YJA2E,"Thank God that there are films out there that don't follow the same old Hollywood crap formula. I think the digital revolution and the DVD revolution is actually making it possible for more interesting work to get out there even if you have to dig harder to find it.
  I love it when a film takes its time to draw you in deeper and deeper into its inner emotional reaches.  It really was like taking a trip through the soul of America and that soul is disturbed and confused. What really blew my mind was the way they used Martin Luther King's speeches about Vietnam and references to his assassination in a way that hit me hard. I found myself choked up every time i heard his voice. I've heard him speak before, of course, but the way they used the speeches here made me feel like I understood his message in a way I'd never thought about.
What can you say about a movie that has heavy statistics about war, oppression and a plea for compassion at the end of it where a credits crawl would usually be? In fact, there's no credits at all in the film. You have to access them by selecting them in the features.  Somehow that made me think a lot.  All in all I can't say enough about this DVD. Brilliant.",1083283200,8,1203,4.258771929824562
2043271,5,B0001YJA2E,"I think this movie is well worth checking out.  It's not at all typical. In other words, if you're looking for something to chill out to or have some fun with, you should look elsewhere. This movie is very simple but very complicated all at the same time. It has a main character of sorts, a real person, not an actor, strangely enough named Jim Kirk.  He's kind of an Everyman, not someone who's personality stands out but who acts as a through- line for the action.  Jim is definitely a strange guy.  One minute he seems calm and indifferent, even Zen-like, then he's laughing with a buddy about the tragedy of Hiroshima and then he's hanging out with a group of old hippie peace activists and he's fitting right in. All of his travels are set against the backdrop of the aftermath of 9/11 through the war in Afghanistan (remember that?), and the invasion of Iraq. The film also has very interesting and moving sequences that give you a sound journey through American history.  The footage of Ground Zero is  amazing and eerie. A lot different than what I've seen before on the news. There's not a focus on a plot in USA THE MOVIE. It really is more of a collage that leads to a kind of epic ending.  All of this is accompanied by what the filmmaker calls ""voices in time"" : lots of audio appearances by well known people from history. I really haven't seen anything like it before but it's definitely the kind of DVD that is great to own because it's almost like a book. You can look at it many times and catch lots of things you might have missed the first, second or third times.  And my favorite thing is the DVD cover!",1082505600,,1625,4.3754152823920265
2043272,5,B0001YJA2E,"Great Film. It gave me a lot to think about. Reminded me of everything that led up to the war but it went beyond that too. I was especially struck by the ""newsreel"" style area with the retro music video that was like something out of Orwell's ""1984"".  Very worthwhile.",1137456000,5,268,4.36
2043273,5,B0001YJA2E,"First is the sound of radio static. The broadcast of the moon landing is heard and with it, fading in and out, is an old-fashioned rendition of the patriotic song ""Over There"".

A flickering image. A naked man lies half-buried in washed-out desert sand. He's being photographed or maybe tormented by someone who snaps his picture, tosses more sand on him, moves to get a better angle. The image is oddly stretched and faded. More like a sketch than a finished drawing.

Sounds of gunfire in the distance and then a hissing reading of the famous war poem ""Dulce et Decorum Est""  over a full moon that appears and disappears through clouds.

The sound of crickets. A little dot of light grows bigger and bigger as something moves closer hypnotically.  Bush's voice is startling as out of the darkness he declares, ""Today we've had a national tragedy. Two planes have crashed into the World Trade Center in an apparent terrorist attack on our country....'"" The speech continues as the light gets closer, closer and becomes headlights coming toward you only to pass you by. You are now part of the  ""fictional drive through reality"".

From there you'll travel long stretches of road with Jim Kirk (real name) who like so many of us seems mainly concerned with himself and his cup of coffee rather than what's happening in the world around him. Even a radio piece detailing the bombing of civilians in Afghanistan leaves him stone-faced and restless.

How does this man go from a tuned-out traveler in an RV to a dying, almost Biblical figure on a scorched Earth? That's the movie in USA The Movie. But he doesn't get there in any formulaic way. His story wends its way from the impressionistic, through documentary style encounters and ends with the surreal. Just like life.",1134691200,,1770,4.761437908496732
2043274,5,B0001YJA2E,"October 2005, We all know what's going on in the world and from start to finish this is a movie that brings home to us the strange times we are living in.  It is so relevant to right now even though it was filmed right after 9/11 and onward through the launching of the Iraqi invasion. A bearded man,  Jim,  looks on as his comfy world falls apart piece by piece until he's left with dust  By the end, his troubled eyes ask the question, ""how did this  happen?"" Unfortunately, I see this same look in many people's eyes  these days and sometimes when I look ion the mirror I see  it in my eyes too..The movie  has an impact that grows because it is a piece of media that  is a warning. Many times in the film there is the motif of ""the dead end road"" or ""road closed""  which represents the direction the country might take if they go once more down the path of war (which obviously we did). Toward the beginning of the movie,  Martin Luther King can be heard speaking over the image of young, carefree guys watching something which catches their attention (this scene is in the French Quarter of New Orleans way before the disaster of Katrina).  MLK  says: ""Don't let anyone make you think that America has some divine, Messianic right to be a sort of policeman to the whole world.""  He goes on to say in the tones of a God ""America is too arrogant...if you don't change your ways, I will rise up and break the backbone of your power and place it in the hands of a nation that doesn't even know my name...""  I said relevant.

But the main thing I found while watching this movie was that it wasn't just relevant to these recent  violent follies, the movie has a broader scope, focusing on the Big Gun of today (the U.S.) but implying that this version of dog eat dog is one in a long, long line stretching back in history. The end of the film could be the end of time or the dawn of time or both.",1130457600,8,1896,4.193370165745856
2043275,4,B0001YJA2E,"To begin with, consider it to be a piece of literature that found its way to a DVD. Or if preferred, think of it as a treatise about ""Man's inhumanity to Man"" that has been presented in a digital format rather than textual format. The title: ""USA The Movie"" is a deliberate provocation that up front spells out the irony which permeates this visual literature.

The Poem, ""Dulce Et Decorum Est"" by Wilfred Owen (a quintessential war poet and WWI soldier killed in battle) accompanied by imagery of clouds and a half moon is the prologue. It sums up the film's intention and message. The final lines of the poem quoted here:  ""My friend, you would not tell with such high zest, To children ardent for some desperate glory, The old Lie: Dulce Et Decorum Est Pro Patria Mori"".

To translate: ""It is sweet and glorious to die for one's country"" The poem details the brutal, gory death of one soldier dying in a gas attack. Owen calls the much spoken phrase : ""Dulce Et Decorum Est Pro Patria Mori"" a lie because he has seen the true meaning of war.

""USA The Movie"" picks up this theme and plays it out over 90 minutes orchestrating a non-linear experience, which increases in intensity, sometimes discordant, sometimes synchronized, finally potent.",1114646400,13,1245,4.671232876712328
2043276,5,B0001YJA2E,"Jam-packed with imagery and audio, featuring a protagonist who is deliberately linked to many cultural icons, USA the Movie is a one of a kind cinematic tour-de-force.

You might get tricked here depending on what you're expecting. The DVD is linked at Amazon to fantastic muckrakers like ""Outfoxed"" and ""Unprecedented"" but to my mind, it's not in the same category. It's not political, which is strange to say considering the fact that its subjects might be seen as September 11th/Iraqi Invasion/Bush etc. but I would characterize it as ""transpolitical"":  it has all of the above in it but it isn't about all of the above.

James Kirk is the captain of his own vehicle, but it's not a spaceship. He slumps at the helm of that classic piece of Americana: the R. V.  Reminding us of an older balding version of the character ""Billy"" (Dennis Hopper) in Easy Rider, down to the gestures and speech patterns, Kirk, is certainly ""riding easy"" in his oversized mobile world. This time, when he sets out to ""find America"" this doughy, over-the hill ""60's""throwback also finds tragedy at the end of the road.

When he's alone, Kirk is a lot like Chance the gardener in the classic"" Being There"": he's a cipher who seems to have no connection with anything but his radio. For Chance, it was the television, but the effect is the same: a numbed out blank slate. Zelig-like, Kirk swings both ways; Right Wing and Left Wing depending on who is in front of him. Hypnotized by a taxi driver spouting easy to digest Eastern philosophy, Kirk looks like he's ready to become a follower.  Ground Zero brings a tear to his eye and anger to his lips. An enraged rant with pat phrases about the corporate takeover of Democracy is what he summons up in the face of destruction.  Flags wave behind him and we're treated to a reverse ""Patton"" image.  Now the flags are a backdrop for a speech not about War but about the evils of the Military Industrial Complex. He knows all the right things to say but he is like a wind-up doll mouthing sentiments he doesn't understand or feel. Van Gogh wanted to be a preacher but no one would listen to him. Thankfully he turned to art and from his madness he left us something of value. James Kirk also goes mad and even resembles a puffy, bloated Van Gogh; only his insanity leaves nothing behind. The struggles of James Kirk are paper thin. Voices that really do care call to him throughout (listen closely to Martin Luther King, Jr. here. This is NOT the I Have A Dream Speech. This is the speech that got him killed.) But in the end as he's buried in the sand, looking like both the Adam and the God of Michelangelo and with his end drawing near, James Kirk would rather go to sleep.

More than anything, this movie is a character study. A portrait of America as it is today.  Read my summary again carefully and you'll see: James Kirk IS America.",1114214400,9,2866,4.536821705426356
2043277,1,B0001YJA2E,"This movie was recommended to me by some academics, who set some pretty lofty expectations. But to me, this movie was nothing but disappointing. The aim of the director is obvious--to use an interweaving of speeches/poems as a way to argue against the Bush doctrine. But the director fails miserably at this. The movie's choice of main character is quite questionable as well. It's a bum who is definitely not worthy of being heard. The rise of corporation power? So what? Most importantly, this movie misses the bull's-eye in its persuasive power; it's clearly intended for those who've already formed their opinions. The movie's aesthetics may be quite pleasing, but pretty much everything else sucks.",1114128000,5,703,5.121739130434783
2043278,4,B0001YJA2E,"It was heavy watching the main character go through his darker moments when he had his seizure and went crazy. it was too personal and disturbing even though it was no doubt necessary for the story,  I  thought the movie was much more interesting than what's usually out there.  I definitely recommend it.",1113782400,7,305,4.716981132075472
2043279,5,B0001YJA2E,"I almost cut my wrists with this DVD. I was so angry at the world when I finished watching.  I smoked a whole pack by the end. This thing isn't about America, it's about the world. It would have been ""England The Movie"" a hundred years ago or ""Rome the Movie"" a thousand years ago. It might be ""China The Movie"" fifty years from now.

And who are these people smugly pretending they know it all, splattering their pseudo-intellectual crap and slamming this film and claiming it has nothing to do with what is happening in this world?  Is there war? Is there devastation? Go back to watching Britney's belly get ripe with her commercialized offspring.  This isn't sci-fi and yes, it is a terrible piece of entertainment but a perfect piece of truth.",1113436800,9,748,4.559701492537314
2043280,5,B0001YJA2E,"The whole shorthand for supposedly being more aware in this weird time is that you are ""Blue"". The Blue State mentality. This is supposed to get us off the hook for what is/was happening during the last few years in our country (The USA). It doesn't get anyone off the hook but it makes us feel better, as though we aren't benefiting in any way from living here and getting all the good stuff that a US citizen gets just by being a US citizen.

But I'm so sick of bitching about this. It doesn't do any good. I haven't taken much action lately and I wonder how many people have. Maybe I'm just down because my job was ""outsourced"" last month and now I'm looking for work in the shrinking tech support field where most of the jobs are quickly going to India and other places overseas. I'm thinking that soon it's not going to pay off to be a citizen here with the screwed up infrastructure and the shrinking job market and the obsession with war. These days it seems like anyone who speaks out gets jumped and questioned about there ""patriotism"". Anyway, back to this review:  USA The Movie is an obscure DVD that makes me realize that some people have taken action, whether it's through politics, protesting or arts or media. The filmmaker is obviously passionate, knowledgeable, willing to go outside the norm, frustrated, unique, astute etc.

I looked through the whole site that's linked to the DVD and got lost in all the articles, essays etc.that are there. The DVD does that too, has references to different times, views and historical points. Sometimes someone does something out there.",1112832000,3,1593,4.6219081272084805
2043281,5,B0001YJA2E,Sorry Bush lovers but this movie is driving you crazy because it makes sense.  Get angry and hate it.  Disagree with everything in it but I for one stand by it.  It's not for the empty minds.  It is long and too hard to keep up with but by the second viewing it makes more sense.

It played in here in World Raw Views, a theater.  I saw it and later I ordered it through usathemovie.com.  The cut was different and much better.  See it and you will like or maybe hate it.

2043284,1,B0001YJA2E,"The only person who could possibly derive anything from USA the Movie is someone who has never thought - in any capacity - about the world we live in and its corresponding politics.  Using an interminable series of static, ugly, grainy, digitally-altered images married to various famous speeches (JFK, MLK, FDR, etc.) and other audio clips, USA the Movie is sort of like looking at xeroxed photographs while listening to AM transmissions from sixty years ago.

Sometimes it shows us the adventures of some burnout hippie named Jim, who rambles senselessly about how messed up the country is and then appears later to have a mental breakdown in a burning forest.  It's mind-numbing, sub-awful, pretentious art school drivel.  If you like this movie, then you are as out-of-touch as this filmmaker thinks you are.  Everyone else is intellectually light years beyond the simplistic garbage this filmmaker is peddling as a profound experience.  Rest assured - it is no such thing.

I was duped into buying this DVD by the multitude of glowing reviews here on Amazon, but if you look carefully you'll notice a very similar writing style among many of them.  Also note that most of these ""reviewers"" have reviewed only one thing - USA the Movie.  I'm thinking this is more than a coincidence.  Anyway, the mushroom cloud on its cover guarantees that the used DVD store will buy it from me for about $5, so my net losses will total fifteen dollars and two hours of my life, which I want back.",1110931200,4,1486,4.792156862745098
2043285,5,B0001YJA2E,"Like many folks I was so hopeful before the election. I really believed that we, as a nation, would realize our folly and correct our mistake. It was obvious. It couldn't go any other way. Well, needless to say, King George W. has been crowned again and I don't know what the hell has happened to our country. Stolen election or not, this time in history has me confused and has me searching for answers.

I got this DVD for the holidays from a friend who is like-minded. He had been raving about it for months: talking about how it really manages to nail the feeling of our times and somehow manages to bring home this feeling of lostness that seems to have grabbed ahold of America. Not that America thinks that it's lost, no, the country is certain that it has all the answers. But from a different perspective there is more and more confusion and it is all tied up in a weird smugness with a topping of fear.

But USA The Movie is somehow is comforting because any piece of art (and this really is art) that makes you feel that you are not alone in your thoughts and views is comforting. The movie takes a piece of historical torment and rides it all the way to the end where nothing is left. Human error? Nuclear annihilation? Global warming? Is their any way out of this mess? The film ponders these questions. It reminded me all too clearly how we were lied to by our ""leaders"", how we swallowed that lie and didn't really blink an eye. How some of us did  rise up for a short time to say NO! but that was that. Once the ball got rolling with war and the march of so-called ""freedom"", what happened to the outcry? I ask myself that question too.  Why did I, and so many others just let it go?

On an interesting note. When my friend and I talked about the movie some of the things that we discussed  made us think that maybe we were talking about two different movies. We almost had an argument about certain things that were and weren't in it. At one point I thought that maybe I was getting pre-Alzheimer's because I couldn't remember seeing a couple of scenes he mentioned. On the other hand, the film is so packed with ideas and thoughts that it isn't surprising that some things might stay in one person's mind and slip another.  Finally, we got together and checked our copies. Sure enough, they are different. The version my friend got for me is a newer one. So we had a very interesting time comparing the two.

2043286,5,B0001YJA2E,"Still on the fence about who to vote for this November? Wondering if we really were lied to about Iraq? Memory failing about whether Bush and Co. really did tell us that all hell would break loose if we didn't go get that crazed maniac Saddam who was on the brink of starting WWIII with his arsenal of death ?  Well look no further than USA The Movie.

Yes, I agree that Saddam was/is a crazed maniac but that's not the issue here. We all know the arguments on both sides. USA The Movie itself isn't even a real anti-Bush movie, its scope is much bigger  but this extra-creative film lays it out in Bush's own voice. Yes, he really did say that we were basically ""all gonna die"" (I'm paraphrasing) if we didn't disarm Saddam. He scared the crap out of us on purpose to achieve his own political ends. Or maybe he really believed it but that could be worse.

Whatever the truth was in Bush's head--here we are now with thousands of civilians dead, hundreds of our soldiers dead and thousands wounded, Saddam on trial like a whacked, out of work Hollywood producer and no apocalyptic arsenal to be found.

Makes you wonder, doesn't it? This completely one-of -a-kind piece of filmmaking puts some completely different thoughts, voices and visuals together side by side and makes you feel like you don't know which way is up until the final moments when you realize that you've been taken on a cinematic ride. It's a really, really good movie and so thought-provoking that you actually feel stunned and somewhat fuzzy at the end. Like you drank too many straight tequila's when you promised yourself you'd just have one. When your mind clears you wake up to the realization that you better VOTE yourself into a better world and keep working after that to clean up your act.",1092182400,13,1770,4.553459119496855

2043288,5,B0001YJA2E,"USA The Movie is like this: You take a nap on a long hot Sunday afternoon. It feels great to close your eyes and let your worries drift away. Soon you're lost in one of those intense lucid dreams where you know you're dreaming but you still can't wake up--not that you want to. You go with the flow, and soon you're in a kind of weird Alice in Wonderland story complete with characters you didn't think you could dream up. They're telling you all kinds of crazy stuff about war and peace while taking you through a trip into the past and even the future.

The dream starts to get heavier and you feel like it's going down a path you can't control. Maybe you want to wake up so you try to open your eyes but you can''t . Now there's destruction and sadness and confusion and scary voices telling you what could be truth or could be lies. You're seeing images that flicker and change

and then get clear, but do you even want to see what you're brain is creating for you?

Finally you're lost in a myth world and you realize the end has come. The end of the world and the end of the dream. It's over. What do you wake up to? What do you do next?

2043289,5,B0001YJA2E,"It's funny because I read all the reviews on this page after getting this movie and it's either a love it or hate it reaction. You'll probably either love it or hate it too. I think the best films are the ones that divide people because obviously they have some kind of impact. I'm in the five star camp because this film did a real number on me and made me want to go back and find out more about Afghanistan and Iraq. I have to admit that I was pretty tuned out when all that was taking place. Especially Afghanistan and I feel guilty about that. The music through the movie was beautiful. I kept getting lost in it especially during some of the historical flashbacks.  Personally, I thought the audio was great. It seemed to me that the soundtrack with speeches, music and the radio was put together so that you feel like you're in the RV with Jim, the main character, or in his head. Everything not on the radio was very clear and everything on the radio sounded like it was really on the radio. Anyway, this is a very amazing DVD which made me cry.",1090713600,6,1053,4.265

2043291,5,B0001YJA2E,"This fictional drive through reality is really a wake up call to all of us who have decided, consciously or unconsiously, to ignore the seriousness of the state of our violent world - and how apathy has gotten us to this point.
USA The Movie formerly titled America Off Line, begs you to really look at yourself and asks you to do more than just feel. And this is what makes it such a unique experience.
This is not your typical movie. They didn't even run credits at the end.
I watched the film many weeks ago but it's still with me all the time. The images and the speeches were that powerful.
Some of the characters we meet made me so angry I wanted to scream and some really opened my eyes in a profound way.
One scene in particular brought me to tears because it was so real. I don't want to spoil it so I'll just mention that it includes a taxi driver with wisdom, heart and a message so simple everyone should hear it.
The main character is a strange but real man who seems lost like the rest of us after the horror of September 11. We are brought along as passengers on this journey as he travels through America, exchanging vehicles as he passes through different phases of awareness. On this journey, we can hear the car radio feed us speeches and poems and opinions from past and current political figures and from people like you and me. I found this to be a very effective technique because you have to pay such close attention to what is being said, as opposed to what is being shown. Very non-Hollywood. The protagonist goes from denial to disillusionment and most of this you can tell by looking into his eyes. Eventually he becomes as destructive to himself as the world is in general.
This is the never ending cycle of violence.
Many of the scenes are shot in a way that feels and looks like a dream. At the same time you're struck with the harsh contrast of the reality of the subject matter. Which to me makes beautiful sense since many of us run around in a productive daze not unlike a dream, choosing to deny what is really going on, and what has been going on for a very long time now.
The point of this film comes across very clearly, very early on.
It solidified my belief that each of us urgently needs to examine the amount of responsibility we have as individuals to each other. There are too many casualties of war and violence. So many babies that deserve to live die every day because the 'adults' in charge don't know how to properly communicate with eachother. It's heart-rending and I've always felt it but watching this film sort of woke me from my dream and now I'm doing more than just feeling.",1089676800,,2632,4.362525458248473
8018327,5,B0001YJA2E,"Great film but too intense to watch. The main character goes through heavy emotional breakdown, a seizure like attack that was apparently caught on camera, which I found to be too disturbing, yet insightful and well fitting to the story. There's a lot more to this story, sometimes even odd humor, weird encounters with real-life characters and heavy, original images of the 9/11 disaster sites. If everything out there right now didn't already feel like a nightmare it might even have been easier to watch but what do we watch on the news everyday?",1155859200,4,549,4.851063829787234
8018328,5,B0001YJA2E,"I hosted a viewing party for USA The Movie on Memorial Day because I thought it would be a good thing for my friends to watch instead of just eating barbeque ribs. There was plenty of beer (the good stuff) which might not have been such a good idea because 7 of my guests totally were blown away in a good way by this movie but two of my guests got so pissed off they practically tore me a new one with the kabob skewers. I loved it (not the skewers!) because there should be some heavy duty feelings stirred up about this war and war in general. There is no middle ground anymore these days and my ""lefty"" friends (and me) are sick of being dominated by the ""right"" who are rapidly being exposed for how wrong they are.

My pissed off buddies especially objected to the heavy truths in the statistics at the end of the movie which lay out some basic facts about the state of the world and the state of America these days. One of them started screaming ""Prove it! Prove it!"" and they were shouted down by the response ""Open your ******* eyes. You'll see the proof!"" A great time was had by all. We'll be doing it again on July 4th!",1151539200,21,1131,4.1880733944954125
8018329,5,B0001YJA2E,"Hundreds of thousands dead, thousands of American soldiers killed or wounded, the world sees us as a bigger threat to Peace than Iran, the country is quickly going broke, the Constitution in tatters, voting rights are being questioned, reporters are threatened with jail. USA the Movie told us so. Way back, right after 9/11, The filmmakers took off in a RV filming a man named James Kirk, a self-absorbed 1960's type as he interacted with the lay of the land pre-war.  That's the ground floor of this film but so much more is built up from that.

 USA the Movie, definitely NOT a documentary but still real, is filled with voices that accompany everything you watch: just like a chorus of angels and demons which must inhabit the head of schizoprenics or mystics. They tell us what has been before, and most disturbingly--what will be in the future. These are strong voices taken from real history or caught from the time that the movie was filmed--which has now turned into history.

The voices command, plead, scream, argue, contradict, warn.  One says that ""first they went after Russia, Then it will be terrorism, then they'll go after China and then it will be extra-terrestrials -- all to keep feeding billions of dollars to war profits...""

Protesters shout to ""Rise Up"", a calm voice explains how our corporations make us hated abroad,"" a smirking. Cheney-like survivalist tells us that we'll be glad to oblige the enemy with mass death , just like we did to the Japanese"", Amy Goodman reads a list of statistics derived from the very first days of the invasion of Baghdad, which now seems almost nostalgic, given what was to follow over the coming years. Martin Luther King speaks the greatest words of warning: ""We are heading down a dead end road that will lead to national disaster"". He begs us, from his grave, to put aside our arrogance because otherwise God wil ""rise up and break the backbone of our power"". The whole film is more like a perfect example of the creative ravings of a human mind torn to bits by everything it has seen and heard and by what it senses will come. But I have to say, maybe the reason I love this film so much is because now that everything it was warning about has happened (which is a little freaky, if you think about it), it makes me feel like I'm not crazy to feel like I do. I watch it and think ""That's right, the world is insane, it's not just me."" Don't you think that is kind of comforting these days?",1151452800,9,2455,4.555555555555555
8018330,5,B0001YJA2E,"USA The Movie: This is a movie for NOW! I came to it in a very round about way -- through a posting on indymedia.org about one of my heroes, Pink Floyd's Roger Waters. The film deals with war and how we can't seem to get away from it. So it isn't just about Now but it's also about Then. It's about US and Them. The film somehow makes me feel like I'm not alone in these frustrating times and I haven't seen many movies that have given me this feeling without a lot of talking, so its a real find.

Here are some excerpts of the post from indymedia by Hannah Korigian:

""Roger Waters is the most intellectual and complex lyricist in rock. Both in his solo work and in his work with Pink Floyd, Waters builds conceptual underpinnings for his creations that add an unusual depth in a field generally known for simplistic expressions. Unlike most rock music, which revels in sexuality, the vicissitudes of love and general ""good times"", Waters' compositions focus on larger issues such as war, personal alienation, mortality and societal apathy. These themes are played out in a multitude of ways, from the exploration of time and the cycle of life in ""Dark Side Of The Moon"", the longing for lost innocence in  ""Wish You Were Here"", bitter criticism of social norms and structures in ""Animals"", individual breakdown and militarism in ""The Wall"" and the tragedies of war in ""The Final Cut"". Waters continued to explore the darker side of the human experience in his solo work, perhaps most effectively in ""Amused To Death"" in which he takes aim at the fusion of militarism and entertainment. Rather than being a ""rocker"" in the usual sense of the word, Waters is a consummate social critic who utilizes the forum of rock to express his views to a wide audience....""

""Waters has influenced many over the years and his style is reflected in the works of music and visual expression by a variety of artists.  In recent times a notable example of artistic creation in the Floyd/Waters style is the relatively obscure independent film ""USA The Movie""which has the same complexity and multi-faceted approach to cinema as Waters has to composition. ""USA The Movie"" merges a free-floating fictional storyline with real world events and places.  It is a take on war, past and present, through the ""comfortably numb"" eyes of an aging American hippie who can't break free of his own apathy and thus becomes a symbolic weapon of mass destruction. ""USA The Movie"" has a particular resonance with ""The Final Cut"" and such lyrics as:

""In my rear view mirror the sun is going down
Sinking behind bridges in the road
And I think of all the good things
That we have left undone
And I suffer premonitions
Confirm suspicions
Of the holocaust to come.""

The filmmaker, W.T. Zeyera, who in various interviews has expressed his admiration for Roger Waters' work and sensibility, also utilizes audio in ""USA The Movie"" in distinctly Floyd/Waters manner. The audio design brings together elements of sound, speeches and music to create a profoundly haunting atmosphere reminiscent of  ""Dark Side Of The Moon"" or in a more biting tone - ""Amused to Death"". This is a Floyd/Waters type of project not in the entertaining or rock and roll sense but in the willingness to take its time and captivate through its substance as well as style...""

8018332,5,B0001YJA2E,"This film is an exploration of the Spirit and the Flesh in modern times.  Protagonist Jim Kirk, drives an unwieldy RV across America, stopping often to fill his gas-guzzling tank. He  is middle-aged and confused . He fuels his thick, diabetic body with cups of coffee and radio chatter. He is the Flesh: agitated and sometimes spaced out, fairly oblivious to the growing tension around him but feeling it as twinges of discomfort.

The Spirit suffuses the film through speeches and other sounds, as well as what appears and goes by in the visual field. The Spirit eventually collides with the Flesh and Kirk goes down, unable to comprehend what has happened to him. He's been in denial about just how bad things have become due to  he waywardness of all of us, because we are all focused on the needs and desires of our flesh. We're all in the same denial and so we, like Kirk are in danger of going down and being blown away by desert sands just like him.",1145836800,2,956,4.508670520231214
