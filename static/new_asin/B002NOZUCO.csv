3959755,3,B002NOZUCO,Bob was not articulate at all. It was good. But not inspiring.  I do not regret this purchase...but I definitely could have saved by you-tubing the info instead.,1275955200,2,161,4.75
3959756,5,B002NOZUCO,"Fantastic, very easy to follow and very informative. I am looking forward to series 2. Well worth buying.",1275782400,2,105,4.888888888888889
3959757,4,B002NOZUCO,"As a self taught sewer, I always enjoy learning a new skill and finding out new things that didn't take at first exposure. He starts from step one and proceeds to sewing a useful project. This is definitely a new sewer DVD but he is very patient and demonstrates things very clearly. The other two DVDs are about learning to draw designs that are proportionally correct and how to start a design book and where to get your ideas. The negative: my copy did not come with the promised pattern, nor did I find it online. I would enjoy seeing more advanced DVDs in the future.",1272412800,9,572,4.40566037735849
3959758,5,B002NOZUCO,Extremely happy with the entire package. Everything was concise and helpful. I benefitted from purchasing this.,1269388800,4,111,6.0

8375240,1,B002NOZUCO,Too difficult for a 10 year old to follow.,1434844800,,42,3.7777777777777777
8375241,5,B002NOZUCO,just what we expected!,1421625600,,22,4.75
8375242,2,B002NOZUCO,"Not impressed soooooo basic and waste of money in my opinion,  the pattern sucked because i had to tape it together and the measurements were off",1366934400,,145,4.576923076923077
8375243,2,B002NOZUCO,"I cannot believe that anyone would be interested in fashion design, and yet not know how to sew a seam.  This man has a wealth of information to share, but he did not give much on this set.  There is really not one word about drawing clothing.  I am under the impression he had planned to do more DVDs, but it has been several years since he did this set.",1345507200,2,355,4.042857142857143
8375244,2,B002NOZUCO,"I borrowed this set from the library and found it to be very, very slow and basic with poor grammar.",1313884800,2,100,4.05
8375245,5,B002NOZUCO,"This DVD was pretty informative. If you don't know sewing basics, this will help you out. I wanted to learn more about the design/creative process and the dvd lightly addressed this.

The best part of the DVD was the hooded scarf project. I received this DVD a few months before Christmas and used this hooded scarf to make gifts for everyone this year.  I was able to be creative and make each one unique.  After about 30 hooded scarves, I was 'over it'.  But everyone loved the scarves and I enjoyed making them.

Bob Martin is nervous and stumbles a bit throughout the DVD, but it makes him even more endearing. Overall, a good purchase and I would recommend this to anyone wanting to learn the basics.",1307491200,9,705,4.519685039370079
8375246,5,B002NOZUCO,Wow - I cannot believe the value of this product.  There is so much information here for the money.  The sewing portion is for beginners - but that is what I wanted.  You can also download a pattern right from his website/store.  Bob comes across as a genuine person who truly wants you to learn what he has to offer.  I am incredibly happy with this DVD.,1290816000,7,355,4.2388059701492535
8375247,2,B002NOZUCO,I found this DVD to be way too basic and slow.  I believe it is geared at the absolute beginner who has never turned on a sewing machine.  The extremely slow pace that Bob Martin speaks only made me sleepy but did inspire me to start writing reviews.,1288483200,4,250,4.1875
8375248,5,B002NOZUCO,Lots of detail from learning how to use a sewing machine to designing and making a finished product. Well worth the money!,1278288000,4,122,4.590909090909091
