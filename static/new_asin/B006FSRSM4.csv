Susan is great, enthusiastic, upbeat, uplifting, has a great figure and seems like a genuinely nice person. I wish she made more videos. God bless you Susan and thank you!!",1444867200,2,308,4.421052631578948
8497178,5,B006FSRSM4,"I love this workout!  It is just so much fun and the music is great!  I have actually found myself humming a few tunes throughout the day.  I haven't worked out in awhile and so I only wanted to do workouts that are fun to get going again.  This one is definitely a keeper.  The moves are not overly complicated, but have that latin flavor that is so fun.  She keeps me moving and keeps my heart rate up, however the moves are not too fast.  Just right and I definitely think you would be pleased if you give it a try.

There are two workouts on the disc.  At this point I only do 1 at a time and then do the cool-down.  Have fun!",1417737600,,630,3.9285714285714284
8497179,5,B006FSRSM4,"I have the first latin workout and enjoy it. The second one is similar but has less talking-which I like.  Susan is cheerful and encouraging, and the steps are easy to follow",1401148800,,174,4.4375
8497180,4,B006FSRSM4,"Again, this is a very easy workout suitable for everyone. The music is great, though I was expecting something really ""spicy"".
Anyway, I really like it!",1383177600,2,152,4.884615384615385
