8086904,5,B000BI5MPY,"Great video of Jose Alfredo Jimenez's greatest hits. I bought this one since they knocked most of these videos off You Tube. So if you want some color and black and white videos of him singing his greatest hits, this is the one. The backup featuring Mariachi Vargas (a must) is flawless. Inexpensive and recommended product. Note some of the videos are older and black and white, so you're not going to have high definition quality. But still a nice to have item. I was after the video of ""Llego Borracho el Borracho"" and it was on there.",1339891200,,538,4.5
8086905,3,B000BI5MPY,"Good quality and sound, some of my favorites, there should be more like this of different artists on the market.  Great buy for the price.",1331424000,,138,4.52

8086907,5,B000BI5MPY,"Anyone who likes the legendary singer/songwriter Jose Alfredo Jimenez will treasure this collection of exceptional film clips of Jimenez singing his poetic, soulful songs in his unique, somewhat rusted by tequila voice. Jimenez was born in 1926, and his career flourished from the late '40s until his death in 1973, and he wrote a vast quantity of material that was to be successful not only for himself, but for many of Latin music's top singing stars, then and now.

The film quality is superb considering its age, and sound quality excellent. The first 6 tracks are in b&w, and include a duet with Amalia Mendoza, and the following 9 are in color, and make up nearly 45 minutes of outstanding music by one of the great masters of Mexican music. Includes a brief clip with Pedro Vargas, accompaniment by the Mariachi de Tecalitlan, and ""extras"" like a photo gallery. Track 6, written for Maria Felix, has clip of her, looking incredibly glamorous, thanking him after the song. Track list:

1: ""15 de Septiembre""
2: ""Llego Borracho el Borracho""
3: ""Maldito Abismo""
4: ""Te Necesito Amor""
5: ""El Silencio de la Noche"" (with Mendoza)
6: ""Que Digan Maria...Maria...Maria""
7: ""Camino de Guanajuato""
8: ""Ella""

10: ""Serenata Huasteca""
11: ""Mi Tenampa""
12: ""Despacito""
13: ""Que Bonito Amor""
14: ""El Rey""
15: ""Gracias""",1167868800,19,1330,4.933035714285714
