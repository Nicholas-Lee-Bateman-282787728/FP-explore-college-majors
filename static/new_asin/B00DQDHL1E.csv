8596285,4,B00DQDHL1E,"Weve reached the final season of Hey Dude, the Nickelodeon comedy from 1989-1991 that centered on the teenage staff of a dude ranch over the course of a summer.  This is also the only season to include all the characters in the opening credits.  And while there are still plenty of laughs, the poor episodes are weaker this time around.

I must admit that not many of these shows were familiar to me, which was a bit of a surprise.  True, I was never a faithful watcher of the show, but I did catch quite a few reruns when it was airing on Nickelodeon.  All that meant was I got to enjoy some laughs for the first time.

And the characters are still fun.  Theres senior staff Ted (David Lascher), lifeguard Melody (Christine Taylor), riding instructor Brad (Kelly Brown), and ranch hands Danny (Joe Torres), Jake (Jonathan Galkin), and Kyle (Geoffrey Coy).  Rounding out the cast are ranch owner Benjamin Ernst (David Brisbin), his son Buddy (Josh Tygiel), and Lucy (Debrah Kalman), the adult in charge of the horses.

So what actually happens in these thirteen episodes?  The highlights include the teens inventing a new staff member named Jed and then having to keep the illusion going.  After one practical joke too many, the rest of the group decides to convince Ted that hes shrinking.  A double date goes very wrong for four of the members of the gang.  When Brads father loses his job, she suddenly has to live on what she makes at the Bar None.  And in the series finale, the old staff and the new staff square off in a game of capture the flag to determine who gets to be senior staff next summer.

On the other hand, there are some episodes where the show just doesnt work so well.  Mr. E. getting amnesia was one of those.  It was almost funny, but it was more painful than funny.  But the worst episode involved a mother leaving one of her twins behind at the ranch because she is so forgetful.  Yes, the characters interacting with the baby was fun, but I never could get past the premise.

The show is definitely a product of the late 80s and early 90s.  A couple of the guys sport mullets.  Their clothes scream the time period.  And one episode finds Ted trying to earn extra money so he can buy a tricked out tape and CD player.  I just had to laugh at that one, although the episode was good.

Now if Im being honest, Ill freely admit that none of these episodes break any new ground.  Even though I hadnt seen them before, I could predict what was going to happen early on.  Its a sitcom, unexpected plot twists just aren't the genres specialty.

Likewise, the acting is still bad.  The main casts acting works, although it is a bit over the top.  But the guest stars can really be bad.  This is especially true in an episode that finds Jake having to fight a bully.  Wow was there some overacting there.

But if you grew up with the show, none of that will matter.  These characters are old friends, and I enjoyed getting to visit with them again.  This is a single camera comedy, which means no laugh track, but I still found myself laughing at their antics.  Its still entertaining, and thats all that matters.

Those who have bought the previous sets will know what to expect here.  Weve got 13 episodes on two discs, just like always.  And just like always, the shows are in full frame, stereo, with no extras.  But if you want to watch this show again, youll snap it up.

And if you have fond memories of the show, youll enjoy catching the final adventures of the Bar None gang.  While there are a few clunkers, there is still fun to be had in Hey Dude Season Five.",1433894400,,3590,4.3936170212765955
8596286,5,B00DQDHL1E,Love this show. The title screens are simple and easy to navigate. Also good quality for an 80's-90's show.,1421366400,,107,4.684210526315789

8596288,5,B00DQDHL1E,"One of my favorite shows ever! I discovered the show when I was looking through the internet looking at different early Nick shows. Hey Dude was one of the only ones who really stood out to me. The show is a comedy, but also teaches life lessons. The setting is on a Dude Ranch where teenagers work and live for the summer. Mr. Earnest owns the ranch and has a son named Buddy. They get in many scrapes and scrabbles, but always manage to get out of them comically. I would recommend this show to anyone who enjoys comedies. Though I'm sure anyone could enjoy the show!",1420070400,,569,4.327102803738318
8596289,5,B00DQDHL1E,"I finally own all the seasons for one of my favorite children's tv shows!!  Today's teens probably won't appreciate it, there are some generalizations that are not correct and the clothes and the feel of the show is very early 90s, but there are also some great lessons that are the same no matter what decade you are born.",1416441600,,323,4.47457627118644
8596290,5,B00DQDHL1E,"In the last season of Hey Dude Ted made A full return appearance to all episodes!

Jake stands up to Roy the Bully way to go Jake!",1394496000,,287,3.6885245901639343
8596291,5,B00DQDHL1E,"I never thought i'd see the day this would happen, Hey Dude the complete series on dvd, its been a long long wait, thanks so much to Shout Factory for making this happen, loved this show as a teenager and still love it, so much fun reliving it again, it brings you back to an innocent simpler time.",1392681600,3,298,4.155172413793103
