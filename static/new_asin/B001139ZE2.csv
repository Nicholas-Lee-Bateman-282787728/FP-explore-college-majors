3058839,4,B001139ZE2,"If you are a fan of horror movies, esp movies like Hostel, The Texas Chainsaw Massacre, Saw...you would enjoy this. There are several scenes that made me drop my jaw and turn away. And for the men, the outhouse scene is one of the worst things I ever saw! I cringed and I am not even a man. Very interesting flick. Not for the squeamish.",1204675200,12,337,4.2
3058840,4,B001139ZE2,"While the plot for Carver might not be terribly original, I must say that this little gem surprised the hell out of me. It's incredibly well shot and generates a true sense of suspense and dread from beginning to end. The acting? Again, it surprised the hell out of me in a very good way. All performances were spot-on which is usally not this case in a low budget slasher film. In addition, the backwoods locations were just awesome and really added to the appeal. Crumbling outhouses, barns and even the woods themselves are used very smartly and effectively. The effects were definitely gruesome and well done. Don't believe the other review here that says this movie is only about the gore because it isn't. Any self-respecting horror fan should check this sucker out. And for the record, no, I am not the writer/director of this film nor do I know anyone associated with this film.",1203897600,16,886,4.685897435897436
3058841,4,B001139ZE2,"What would the world be like without over the top splatter fests? I personally don't want to find out. I'm always on the lookout for weird and disturbing slasher flicks and Carver did not disappoint. It's your basic kids in the wood getting hacked up by the locals, sure, but it's got a little something more to it. It's a bit smarter than the average micro-budget horror film. The gore FX were truly cringe-worthy, and there was some real suspense in moments. It also had a heightened style through most of it that you don't get in a lot of these straight to DVD jobs.

All that said... it's got its flaws. Plenty of them really, from a few technical aspects to some hit or miss acting. However, I think its good points were enough to outweigh most of these, and I quite enjoyed it overall. Definitely worth a look.",1203811200,15,816,4.44
3058842,2,B001139ZE2,"This movie is apparently based on the true events surrounding the infamous Carver family in the backwoods of some ""real"" town. The Carver family consists of two brothers, one a red headed invalid bartender who is half retarded and his obese, useless and totally retarded brother who likes to wear gogles as he kills people. This movie presents the well worn plot of 4 very unlikable 20 somethings who stop their pointless roadtrip long enough to cross the 2 retarded serial killers. The end result is lots of blood and over the top gore with very little plot or empathy derived from the audience. I found myself nodding off on a couple of occasions during the movie which proves that ripping off a man's package with pliers isn't enough to cover for bad moviemaking and predictable crap acting.",1203724800,11,794,4.760869565217392

3058872,3,B001139ZE2,"I honestly can't put my finger on why I enjoyed this gruesome, snail-paced horror movie as much as I did. Maybe it's just that it captures a look and feel that works for me, maybe it's because it's so refreshing to see a straightforward slasher pic with no special twists or gimmicks. Be warned that the first scene is truly disturbing, and after that, as I said, the movie plods along at a laughably slow pace that will probably disappoint most viewers. But the writing is good and the story manages to avoid a lot of the pitfalls that other indie horror films tend to be beset with. No awards for the actors, but they do their job.",1431388800,,633,4.372881355932203

3058875,3,B001139ZE2,"Carver's only true flaw is its utter lack of originality. In every other aspect, this (presumably) shot on video romp holds up against any 5 or 10 million dollar low-end exploitation film released to theaters or turning up on basic cable. And I doubt it cost more than twenty grand. The direction, photography, and-- yes-- even the acting are more than equal to any number of January-February theatrically-released horror films (you know the kind I mean). The only thing these guys don't have is a D-list ""name"" for the lead, like, oh say, Kristin Kreuk. I look forward to seeing more of their stuff!",1428883200,,600,4.778846153846154
3058876,4,B001139ZE2,"This is how indie horror should be. It certainly shows what can be done with a very low budget, good acting, and solid directing.

First off, you can ignore the DVD artwork - this isn't a supernatural/possession film, as the freaky eyes might lead you to think (funny, as a sidenote, how similar it is to ""Evidence of a Haunting"").

Now, if you aren't into the graphic torture porn genre, you definitely won't like this one. Frankly, I'm not a fan of that genre. What I do enjoy is a well-told story (even if it's unoriginal) shot and edited well. This throwback to the old slasher films, albiet with far more blood and gore, actually had me sitting up and paying attention. The dialogue was well-written and delivered believably by the cast. I actually - and this is what surprised me - started to care about the characters, particularly brothers Pete and Brian. Even the local hillibillies carried their roles off pretty well.

Currently playing for free on Amazon Prime, horror fans definitely need to give this one a viewing.",1427414400,3,1029,4.705555555555556

3058885,4,B001139ZE2,"Carver is not to be understimated, it did not require a massive budget to earn four stars. If one foes in not expecting hollywood, one will enjoy the realism and shock this film portrays. It is not just a torture film or a copy cat of many torture films, it is unique in its own way. The gore and special effects are convincing enough to have viewers of tame horror wondering. So you told yourself you would go on a roadtrip and camp.oit and enjoy it. Think again, carver portrays elements that films like the orginal Texas Chainsaw Massacre portrays, yet is in a leauge of its own..Yes it is low budget, yes there are some repeat themes, nonetheless if one jas taken a break from shock horror, or Torture film this will refreshen. I am giving this film four stars for its class because it doesn't set in the class of hollywood blockbusters that created trends. Remember do not expect hollywood, set down turn up the volume pay attention, and enjoy. I will not give away any spoilers, if you are a gore fan you will appreciate, of not i would say ""what is the ideal of gore"". Convincing acting as if in some scenes this was happening.

3058905,1,B001139ZE2,"This tripe couldn't classify as a true horror film OR a ""gore"" film, because it has neither. The plot is so ridiculously predictable that anyone who sits through this is obviously only in it for the gore. Although there's plenty of blood, the torture/kill scenes are almost laughably juvenile; it almost appears someone wanted to put together a gore flick, but couldn't muster the stomach for it at the last minute. A 20-penny nail in one scene, a crowbar in another scene, a lead pipe...yet never is there anything gruesomely violent that is actually seen. It reeks of the old 80's movies where the film editing was so blatantly obvious.

The acting itself is extremely poor, and for someone who's hard of hearing, the closed-captions are a MUST because the dialogue is so muted. Sadly, however, the captions are completely out-of-sync for about 2/3 or the movie, which just adds to the torture of having to sit through this.

Someone is obviously infatuated with fecal matter, however, as the close-ups and repeated scenes of filthy, repulsive toilets and restrooms is enough to turn the strongest stomach. To these ""kids"", however, it didn't seem to bother them. Piles of feces on the walls and floor, as well as overflowing the dry toilet bowl, were hardly enough to keep them from dropping their jeans and taking care of business...or scooting along the floor through the stuff in order to play a prank on your buddy. The whole movie was utterly ridiculous; the torture scenes were laughable - if someone smashes your kneecap with a sledgehammer, you're going to do more than just say ""Ahhhhh!"" - and the plot was non-existent. The dialogue was unintelligible, and the script itself was probably written by a junior in high school during a Wednesday afternoon detention.

Carver does hit some key marks that can and do make for a good horror flick. It also misses some key marks that hurt its effectiveness. There is the loud mouth, the mr. softy, the semi tuff guy, the party girl and the kinda different girl for the main characters.
Its based on true events (can't say how accurate it is) that take place in southern nowhereville USA. The story involves two brothers and a couple that is best friends with the older brother. They are taking a camping break from school and the brothers are trying to get reacquainted with one another. They meet at a bar/restaurant for a bathroom break when the bar's owner asks for some help moving some items from his barn/storage building. They agree after being offered money and free booze. The building is near their camp site so they decide to set up camp and then do the favor. They find a girl who has already setup her camp on their spot so they all decide to camp together. They ask the girl who is waiting for her camp buddy if she would like to come along for the company and she agrees. They find some 8MM films (with sound) and a projector (silent type) and decide to see whats on the films. They find what appears to be snuff films of staged murders.
This is pretty much the setup before any action starts happening.
Some of the kill scenes are decent enough with cut aways during some of the strikes and a fair amount of blood with some tourture mixed in to shake things up a bit.  The special makeup effects aren't bad for the budget. The killer is todays standard BIG BOY southerner with the usual attire. The movie has some cursing including the Fword and  several scenes of female frontal nudity during the kill scenes.
We see a key character in the films that never gets addressed even though the subject is brought up. Did they forget?
""WARNING THERE IS A FEW SCENES OF FECAL MATTER MENT FOR SHOCK AND AW"" I only mention this for those who may be or take offense at this cheap shot gross out.
The movie s production values are good for the most part including the decent acting, but some things that hurt the movie are when they don't know when to stop  the action or that none of the characters have any real redeeming value (to many low budget and some big budget movies do this to often) well one sorta does. Then there are the TSTW (to stupid to watch) moments with the victims doing so many dumb things that only dumb down the movie or given scene.
I am giving this 3 stars for the things it does well over the things it doesn't do. Worth at least one watch.",1408492800,,2698,4.32806324110672

3058919,4,B001139ZE2,"If you are a gorehound interested in seeing people being brutally killed, Carver (2008) is probably a film that will be of interest.  The budget may be modest, but writer/director Franklin Guerrero Jr. delivers some shocking, bloody, bone shattering, ball bursting gore, with generally good production values.  Like his previous film, The 8th Plague (2006), Carver is set in the vicinity of the fictional town of Halcyon Ridge.  The situation is a very familiar one for slasher films, as group of young adults on a camping trip encounter a deadly killer.

Billy Hall Carver (David G. Holland) runs a small tavern, with the help of his brother Bobby Shaw (Erik Fones).  Bobby is a silent hulk of a man, who has the unpleasant habit of butchering people, using common hand tools.  The film opens boldly with Bobby ending the life of woman, in a most unpleasant and graphic manner, using a hand saw.  The movie follows the adventures of a group of campers who endure some cruel horrors, at the hands of a particularly cold blooded monster.

Brothers Pete (Matt Carmody) and Bryan (Neil Kubath) meet up with their friend Zack (Jonathan Rockett) and his wife Rachel (Kristyn Green) at a small tavern, where they witness the local sheriff, taking Bobby Shaw into custody.  In return for free booze, the group agrees to help the shorthanded Billy Hall, transport some supplies from a warehouse in the woods, over to the tavern.  They pitch their tents at the campsite, and meet Kate (Ursula Taherian), another camper who is waiting for a friend.  Kate joins the group on their trip to Carver's warehouse, where they discover a stash of films and a projector.  They watch movies of a masked man, brutally murdering various people in the woods.  Believing the films are fake, the group grabs the supplies and heads over to the tavern for a night of singing and heavy drinking.  Unfortunately, this night will be the last for most of them.

Bobby Shaw is a big and very nasty dude, who dons a mask when he does his evil deeds, killing with great efficiently, and virtually no emotion.  Zack is ambushed in an outhouse, and a very sensitive part of his anatomy is crushed in the jaws of Bobby's pliers.  Rachel is next, and gets nailed like a board.  There's not a high level of intelligence among the campers, as Pete and Bryan manage to get themselves trapped in the warehouse.  Pete is then injured in an accident.  Kate is more successful, striking back at the man in the mask, but she too finds herself trapped in the warehouse, from where there is apparently no escape.

The once the violence begins, it keeps coming in waves.  Each time one of the victims does anything even halfway intelligent, they are brutally smacked down and made to suffer pain, as Bobby Shaw likes to take his time.  The setup for the mayhem is not particularly well written, and features an overdose of gross toilet humor, but the bone crushing, blood spattered, second half of the film is nicely paced, and very well executed, with a nice mixture of horror clichs and unexpected surprises.  With an excessive number of deathcrawls, the victims get plenty of chances to take down Bobby Shaw, but they have problems striking a vital area.

Writer/director Franklin Guerrero Jr. covers a lot of ground in his two commentary tracks for the film, the DVD also includes some deleted scenes and a making of featurette.  For a financially strapped project, the production and editing is better than might be expected.  The dialog and story structure is weak in places, but the film definitely delivers where it counts.  Hitting with the impact of a sledgehammer, this is not for the squeamish.  Guerrero is a filmmaker with potential, who hopefully will get an opportunity to work on a project with tighter material and a bigger budget.",1288483200,,3800,4.776416539050536

3058922,3,B001139ZE2,"Carver (Franklin Guerrero Jr., 2008)

I can make you one guarantee about the weird, weird experience that is Carver: once you have seen it, you will never be able to hear ""Turkey in the Straw"" again without imagining blood, gore, and widespread death. Which can be very interesting if your neighborhood's ice cream truck plays it incessantly. It's a silly little movie, and it's got more than its share of flaws, but it brings the gore in a memorable enough setting that, like me, you may be willing to forgive the film for a lot.

Plot: nothing out of the ordinary. Two couples head off to the country to do a bit of camping. When they get to the campsite, they find another lass there who's waiting for her friend, who went out that morning and never came back. (Thanks to the opening scene, we know she won't be.)  The batch of young-and-beautifuls is subject to the attentions, and predations, of the local serial killer, and the remaining folks need to figure out how to escape the area without getting chopped into pickled pigs' feet to serve the local bar patrons.

No, the plot's nothing new. Most of the acting is mediocre, and some of it is downright awful. The camerawork seems a little shaky at times, though this does look like a bigger-budget production than I expected. In other words, it doesn't sound like a great deal to get excited about. Guerrero, however, is willing to do all sorts of interesting things one doesn't see in your usual slasher film. (Imagine getting brained with a toilet. A full toilet.) The resultant gore scenes make for a mix of horror and humor that is, if not unique, at least so far beyond convention that Carver succeeds in doing something American gore films haven't done for a while now (save the redoubtable Deadgirl), and that is shock the audience. From that standpoint, I'd have to call it a success, though a mediocre one. Still, if you're a gorehound, it's a must-see. ** ",1260403200,,1925,4.633431085043989
3058923,4,B001139ZE2,"""Carver"" is one of those films that stick with you for a while after the DVD has been ejected. Maybe it's that stupid song that keeps playing at various speeds or perhaps the grainy feel/look of the cinematography, but most likely it's some of the grizzly death scenes, that especially hit home with veiwers of the (male) persuasion...
Writer/Director Franklin Guerrero Jr. presents us with a cavalcade of gruesome ways to bite the big one, and ""Carver"" delivers plenty of the red stuff. The story itself is a bit used by this point, but if you're a fan of Torture-Horror, you will be high on the hog, as ""Carver"" brings it in heavy doses.
This is low budget, and at times it becomes very evident, but as far as ""Bang for your Buck"" goes, it can be overlooked.
Acting-wise, it is hit or miss, but the production value appears like that of a much higher budgeted film. Mr. Guerrero has obviously done his homework, and realizes what it takes to make an audience squirm.
My biggest complaint would be the unoriginal storyline. A group of friends on a roadtrip fall victim to a family of maniacs (sound familiar?), yet it is presented in a brutally raw fashion and keeps the tension level on high.
A pleasent (word used loosely) addition to any Horror collection.",1238716800,2,1260,4.629464285714286

3058925,5,B001139ZE2,"As I read through the reviews, I was shocked at the number of people who disliked this film.  It had me wondering, 'did we all watch the same film'.  I realized that at least one person didn't.  This person said it was about a pumpkin carver who wears a jack-o'-lantern (sorry, it was ""jackal lantern"") as a mask killing a bunch of teenagers.  That is so far from the truth.  There were no pumpkins involved in this film, nor anything else Halloweenish.  Well, everyone has their own personal opinion.  And now for mine:  Actually, I thought this was one of the best slasher films I've ever seen.  I'm not going to give a rundown of the plot.  I'm just going to tell you what I loved about it.  There was nothing about this film I didn't like.  I loved the realistic gritty camera work, which almost made it seem like documentary footage.  The music was also extremely eerie and disconcerting.  There wasn't a lot of predictability here.  In typical slasher films, the lead actress is always left alone after everyone else gets slaughtered, and must fight the killer single-handedly, and almost always succeeds.  After which, she sometimes discovers a wounded survivor, and everyone's all smiles.  Then something happens to make you jump (usually it's the killer popping up, not dead after all).  This is not your typical slasher film.  It's VERY brutal.  It goes for your throat.  It challenges you to not look away.  I was very happily surprised by all this.  I didn't know anything about this film before I watched it. There was an uncomfortable creepiness that could be felt from beginning to end.  The choice of actors and the acting was top-notch, as was the direction and the cinematography.  The killer was very scary, and very human (nothing supernatural here), and it was all filmed beautifully.  The suspense was almost unbearable at times (maybe that was because I was watching it alone in the dark).  Fans of blood and gore shouldn't be disappointed.  The special effects were amazingly realistic, with outstanding scenes of torture and death (the outhouse pliers scene being the most cringe worthy.  I dare any man to not look away during that scene).  It's all very horrific.  I really loved the ""Texas Chainsaw Massacre"" feel of it (I'm talking about the original, not the inferior remake).  It's almost paying homage to it.  I also noticed a bit of an ""Evil Dead"" influence.  There's actually one scene where the younger brother character is in the 'barn of horrors' maze carrying an ax (I think it was an ax, but don't quote me on it), and he jerks at a sound.  It's straight out of ""The Evil Dead"", with dripping ceiling pipes and all.  It was great.  People say that the plot is unoriginal, but then there's really no originality in films these days when you think about it.  Everything's a remake or a sequel, or a sequel to a remake!.  If you want true originality, you should watch some underground Art House films, and keep a very open mind while doing so.  Just something to think about.  It seems to me that this film was not intended to be all that original.  It's more like a tribute to the old great slasher films of the '70s and '80s, giving nods to some truly amazing classic horror films, and adding the great special effects of today.  I think it ranks right up there with some of the best (but then I really love horror films).  Just don't expect the big Hollywood treatment.  This isn't a big Hollywood film.  It's amazing what can be done with a lower budget and a talented crew.  It's also very scary, and quite unsettling.  As far as the 'Based on a True Story' inclusion goes, any true film fan knows you're supposed to watch the credits till the end of the film, and actually read them.  You'd realize that the story is completely fictional.  You should also know that a lot of horror films use 'Based on a True Story' as a tag line to make people feel even creepier about what they're seeing.  I'm not the least bit offended by this.  It definitely worked on me.  It's also often used when the film is actually very, very loosely based on an actual event.  I think this film will eventually gain cult status, and have a large underground following.  Well, you never know, we'll see. Bottom line is, if you're not a fan of gory horror films, it would be best if you avoided this film.  For the rest of you, I highly recommend it.  Maybe I'm not a big tough guy, but this film left me feeling very uncomfortable, and more than a little freaked out.  I had to immediately turn on the lights when it ended.  But hey, I live alone in an old dark house.  I know, it's just an excuse.  Maybe I'm just a wuss.",1228694400,15,4642,4.533816425120773

What makes these films good as opposed to jsut exercises in brutality is whether or not they provide the scares that they should.  Carver is one of these, and the fact that it pays some good homage to Texas Chainsaw Massacre in the process makes it worth checking out.  The familiar storyline involves a group of young people on a road trip that make a wrong turn, and soon enough are hunted, tortured, and murdered by a sadistic, backwoods family.  Yeah, Carver isn't original in the least, but it provides enough scares, shocks, and some blood curdling gore (including a scene involving a pair of pliers that will make you squirm) to satisfy fans of low budget horror.

All performances were spot-on which is usally not this case in a low budget slasher film. In addition, the backwoods locations were just awesome and really added to the appeal. Crumbling outhouses, barns and even the woods themselves are used very smartly and effectively. The effects were definitely gruesome and well done. Don't believe the other review here that says this movie is only about the gore because it isn't. Any self-respecting horror fan should check this sucker out.

It's your basic kids in the wood getting hacked up by the locals, sure, but it's got a little something more to it. It's a bit smarter than the average micro-budget horror film. The gore FX were truly cringe-worthy, and there was some real suspense in moments. It also had a heightened style through most of it that you don't get in a lot of these straight to DVD jobs.

All that said... it's got its flaws. Plenty of them really, from a few technical aspects to some hit or miss acting. However, I think its good points were enough to outweigh most of these, and I quite enjoyed it overall. Definitely worth a look.",1203811200,15,816,4.44

Now, if you aren't into the graphic torture porn genre, you definitely won't like this one. Frankly, I'm not a fan of that genre. What I do enjoy is a well-told story (even if it's unoriginal) shot and edited well. This throwback to the old slasher films, albiet with far more blood and gore, actually had me sitting up and paying attention. The dialogue was well-written and delivered believably by the cast.

The gore and special effects are convincing enough to have viewers of tame horror wondering. So you told yourself you would go on a roadtrip and camp.oit and enjoy it.

3293402,1,B001139ZE2,"This tripe couldn't classify as a true horror film OR a ""gore"" film, because it has neither. The plot is so ridiculously predictable that anyone who sits through this is obviously only in it for the gore. Although there's plenty of blood, the torture/kill scenes are almost laughably juvenile; it almost appears someone wanted to put together a gore flick, but couldn't muster the stomach for it at the last minute. A 20-penny nail in one scene, a crowbar in another scene, a lead pipe...yet never is there anything gruesomely violent that is actually seen. It reeks of the old 80's movies where the film editing was so blatantly obvious.

The acting itself is extremely poor, and for someone who's hard of hearing, the closed-captions are a MUST because the dialogue is so muted. Sadly, however, the captions are completely out-of-sync for about 2/3 or the movie, which just adds to the torture of having to sit through this.

Someone is obviously infatuated with fecal matter, however, as the close-ups and repeated scenes of filthy, repulsive toilets and restrooms is enough to turn the strongest stomach. To these ""kids"", however, it didn't seem to bother them. Piles of feces on the walls and floor, as well as overflowing the dry toilet bowl, were hardly enough to keep them from dropping their jeans and taking care of business...or scooting along the floor through the stuff in order to play a prank on your buddy. The whole movie was utterly ridiculous; the torture scenes were laughable - if someone smashes your kneecap with a sledgehammer, you're going to do more than just say ""Ahhhhh!"" - and the plot was non-existent. The dialogue was unintelligible, and the script itself was probably written by a junior in high school during a Wednesday afternoon detention.

3293413,3,B001139ZE2,"Carver is a low budget 2008 Indie horror flick shot directly on video and I think made to look like 70's vintage film with its faded greenish tint. Carver does hit some key marks that can and do make for a good horror flick. It also misses some key marks that hurt its effectiveness. There is the loud mouth, the mr. softy, the semi tuff guy, the party girl and the kinda different girl for the main characters.
Its based on true events (can't say how accurate it is) that take place in southern nowhereville USA. The story involves two brothers and a couple that is best friends with the older brother. They are taking a camping break from school and the brothers are trying to get reacquainted with one another. They meet at a bar/restaurant for a bathroom break when the bar's owner asks for some help moving some items from his barn/storage building. They agree after being offered money and free booze. The building is near their camp site so they decide to set up camp and then do the favor. They find a girl who has already setup her camp on their spot so they all decide to camp together. They ask the girl who is waiting for her camp buddy if she would like to come along for the company and she agrees. They find some 8MM films (with sound) and a projector (silent type) and decide to see whats on the films. They find what appears to be snuff films of staged murders.
This is pretty much the setup before any action starts happening.
Some of the kill scenes are decent enough with cut aways during some of the strikes and a fair amount of blood with some tourture mixed in to shake things up a bit.  The special makeup effects aren't bad for the budget. The killer is todays standard BIG BOY southerner with the usual attire. The movie has some cursing including the Fword and  several scenes of female frontal nudity during the kill scenes.
We see a key character in the films that never gets addressed even though the subject is brought up. Did they forget?
""WARNING THERE IS A FEW SCENES OF FECAL MATTER MENT FOR SHOCK AND AW"" I only mention this for those who may be or take offense at this cheap shot gross out.
The movie s production values are good for the most part including the decent acting, but some things that hurt the movie are when they don't know when to stop  the action or that none of the characters have any real redeeming value (to many low budget and some big budget movies do this to often) well one sorta does. Then there are the TSTW (to stupid to watch) moments with the victims doing so many dumb things that only dumb down the movie or given scene.

3293416,4,B001139ZE2,"If you are a gorehound interested in seeing people being brutally killed, Carver (2008) is probably a film that will be of interest.  The budget may be modest, but writer/director Franklin Guerrero Jr. delivers some shocking, bloody, bone shattering, ball bursting gore, with generally good production values.  Like his previous film, The 8th Plague (2006), Carver is set in the vicinity of the fictional town of Halcyon Ridge.  The situation is a very familiar one for slasher films, as group of young adults on a camping trip encounter a deadly killer.

Billy Hall Carver (David G. Holland) runs a small tavern, with the help of his brother Bobby Shaw (Erik Fones).  Bobby is a silent hulk of a man, who has the unpleasant habit of butchering people, using common hand tools.  The film opens boldly with Bobby ending the life of woman, in a most unpleasant and graphic manner, using a hand saw.  The movie follows the adventures of a group of campers who endure some cruel horrors, at the hands of a particularly cold blooded monster.

Brothers Pete (Matt Carmody) and Bryan (Neil Kubath) meet up with their friend Zack (Jonathan Rockett) and his wife Rachel (Kristyn Green) at a small tavern, where they witness the local sheriff, taking Bobby Shaw into custody.  In return for free booze, the group agrees to help the shorthanded Billy Hall, transport some supplies from a warehouse in the woods, over to the tavern.  They pitch their tents at the campsite, and meet Kate (Ursula Taherian), another camper who is waiting for a friend.  Kate joins the group on their trip to Carver's warehouse, where they discover a stash of films and a projector.  They watch movies of a masked man, brutally murdering various people in the woods.  Believing the films are fake, the group grabs the supplies and heads over to the tavern for a night of singing and heavy drinking.  Unfortunately, this night will be the last for most of them.

Bobby Shaw is a big and very nasty dude, who dons a mask when he does his evil deeds, killing with great efficiently, and virtually no emotion.  Zack is ambushed in an outhouse, and a very sensitive part of his anatomy is crushed in the jaws of Bobby's pliers.  Rachel is next, and gets nailed like a board.  There's not a high level of intelligence among the campers, as Pete and Bryan manage to get themselves trapped in the warehouse.  Pete is then injured in an accident.  Kate is more successful, striking back at the man in the mask, but she too finds herself trapped in the warehouse, from where there is apparently no escape.

The once the violence begins, it keeps coming in waves.  Each time one of the victims does anything even halfway intelligent, they are brutally smacked down and made to suffer pain, as Bobby Shaw likes to take his time.  The setup for the mayhem is not particularly well written, and features an overdose of gross toilet humor, but the bone crushing, blood spattered, second half of the film is nicely paced, and very well executed, with a nice mixture of horror clichs and unexpected surprises.  With an excessive number of deathcrawls, the victims get plenty of chances to take down Bobby Shaw, but they have problems striking a vital area.

Writer/director Franklin Guerrero Jr. covers a lot of ground in his two commentary tracks for the film, the DVD also includes some deleted scenes and a making of featurette.  For a financially strapped project, the production and editing is better than might be expected.  The dialog and story structure is weak in places, but the film definitely delivers where it counts.  Hitting with the impact of a sledgehammer, this is not for the squeamish.  Guerrero is a filmmaker with potential, who hopefully will get an opportunity to work on a project with tighter material and a bigger budget.",1288483200,,3800,4.776416539050536

I can make you one guarantee about the weird, weird experience that is Carver: once you have seen it, you will never be able to hear ""Turkey in the Straw"" again without imagining blood, gore, and widespread death. Which can be very interesting if your neighborhood's ice cream truck plays it incessantly. It's a silly little movie, and it's got more than its share of flaws, but it brings the gore in a memorable enough setting that, like me, you may be willing to forgive the film for a lot.

Plot: nothing out of the ordinary. Two couples head off to the country to do a bit of camping. When they get to the campsite, they find another lass there who's waiting for her friend, who went out that morning and never came back. (Thanks to the opening scene, we know she won't be.)  The batch of young-and-beautifuls is subject to the attentions, and predations, of the local serial killer, and the remaining folks need to figure out how to escape the area without getting chopped into pickled pigs' feet to serve the local bar patrons.

No, the plot's nothing new. Most of the acting is mediocre, and some of it is downright awful. The camerawork seems a little shaky at times, though this does look like a bigger-budget production than I expected. In other words, it doesn't sound like a great deal to get excited about. Guerrero, however, is willing to do all sorts of interesting things one doesn't see in your usual slasher film. (Imagine getting brained with a toilet. A full toilet.) The resultant gore scenes make for a mix of horror and humor that is, if not unique, at least so far beyond convention that Carver succeeds in doing something American gore films haven't done for a while now (save the redoubtable Deadgirl), and that is shock the audience. From that standpoint, I'd have to call it a success, though a mediocre one. Still, if you're a gorehound, it's a must-see. ** ",1260403200,,1925,4.633431085043989
3293420,4,B001139ZE2,"""Carver"" is one of those films that stick with you for a while after the DVD has been ejected. Maybe it's that stupid song that keeps playing at various speeds or perhaps the grainy feel/look of the cinematography, but most likely it's some of the grizzly death scenes, that especially hit home with veiwers of the (male) persuasion...
Writer/Director Franklin Guerrero Jr. presents us with a cavalcade of gruesome ways to bite the big one, and ""Carver"" delivers plenty of the red stuff. The story itself is a bit used by this point, but if you're a fan of Torture-Horror, you will be high on the hog, as ""Carver"" brings it in heavy doses.
This is low budget, and at times it becomes very evident, but as far as ""Bang for your Buck"" goes, it can be overlooked.
Acting-wise, it is hit or miss, but the production value appears like that of a much higher budgeted film. Mr. Guerrero has obviously done his homework, and realizes what it takes to make an audience squirm.
My biggest complaint would be the unoriginal storyline. A group of friends on a roadtrip fall victim to a family of maniacs (sound familiar?), yet it is presented in a brutally raw fashion and keeps the tension level on high.
A pleasent (word used loosely) addition to any Horror collection.",1238716800,2,1260,4.629464285714286

They throw in a Sheri Moon Zombie wannabe (not happening) and for some reason this movie shows many people on the toilet.  Maybe the director is obsessed with fecal matter, I dunno.  I do know that this movie was slow paced, boring, predictible and really had no scare to it.  I'm glad I didn't pay the full purchase price.  PASS!",1232150400,3,469,4.523809523809524
3293422,5,B001139ZE2,"As I read through the reviews, I was shocked at the number of people who disliked this film.  It had me wondering, 'did we all watch the same film'.  I realized that at least one person didn't.  This person said it was about a pumpkin carver who wears a jack-o'-lantern (sorry, it was ""jackal lantern"") as a mask killing a bunch of teenagers.  That is so far from the truth.  There were no pumpkins involved in this film, nor anything else Halloweenish.  Well, everyone has their own personal opinion.  And now for mine:  Actually, I thought this was one of the best slasher films I've ever seen.  I'm not going to give a rundown of the plot.  I'm just going to tell you what I loved about it.  There was nothing about this film I didn't like.  I loved the realistic gritty camera work, which almost made it seem like documentary footage.  The music was also extremely eerie and disconcerting.  There wasn't a lot of predictability here.  In typical slasher films, the lead actress is always left alone after everyone else gets slaughtered, and must fight the killer single-handedly, and almost always succeeds.  After which, she sometimes discovers a wounded survivor, and everyone's all smiles.  Then something happens to make you jump (usually it's the killer popping up, not dead after all).  This is not your typical slasher film.  It's VERY brutal.  It goes for your throat.  It challenges you to not look away.  I was very happily surprised by all this.  I didn't know anything about this film before I watched it. There was an uncomfortable creepiness that could be felt from beginning to end.  The choice of actors and the acting was top-notch, as was the direction and the cinematography.  The killer was very scary, and very human (nothing supernatural here), and it was all filmed beautifully.  The suspense was almost unbearable at times (maybe that was because I was watching it alone in the dark).  Fans of blood and gore shouldn't be disappointed.  The special effects were amazingly realistic, with outstanding scenes of torture and death (the outhouse pliers scene being the most cringe worthy.  I dare any man to not look away during that scene).  It's all very horrific.  I really loved the ""Texas Chainsaw Massacre"" feel of it (I'm talking about the original, not the inferior remake).  It's almost paying homage to it.  I also noticed a bit of an ""Evil Dead"" influence.  There's actually one scene where the younger brother character is in the 'barn of horrors' maze carrying an ax (I think it was an ax, but don't quote me on it), and he jerks at a sound.  It's straight out of ""The Evil Dead"", with dripping ceiling pipes and all.  It was great.  People say that the plot is unoriginal, but then there's really no originality in films these days when you think about it.  Everything's a remake or a sequel, or a sequel to a remake!.  If you want true originality, you should watch some underground Art House films, and keep a very open mind while doing so.  Just something to think about.  It seems to me that this film was not intended to be all that original.  It's more like a tribute to the old great slasher films of the '70s and '80s, giving nods to some truly amazing classic horror films, and adding the great special effects of today.  I think it ranks right up there with some of the best (but then I really love horror films).  Just don't expect the big Hollywood treatment.  This isn't a big Hollywood film.  It's amazing what can be done with a lower budget and a talented crew.  It's also very scary, and quite unsettling.  As far as the 'Based on a True Story' inclusion goes, any true film fan knows you're supposed to watch the credits till the end of the film, and actually read them.  You'd realize that the story is completely fictional.  You should also know that a lot of horror films use 'Based on a True Story' as a tag line to make people feel even creepier about what they're seeing.  I'm not the least bit offended by this.  It definitely worked on me.  It's also often used when the film is actually very, very loosely based on an actual event.  I think this film will eventually gain cult status, and have a large underground following.  Well, you never know, we'll see. Bottom line is, if you're not a fan of gory horror films, it would be best if you avoided this film.  For the rest of you, I highly recommend it.  Maybe I'm not a big tough guy, but this film left me feeling very uncomfortable, and more than a little freaked out.  I had to immediately turn on the lights when it ended.  But hey, I live alone in an old dark house.  I know, it's just an excuse.  Maybe I'm just a wuss.",1228694400,15,4642,4.533816425120773
3293423,3,B001139ZE2,"This film was a good, but not a great horror flick.  It's not really anything special, just a pumpkin carver wearing a jackal lantern as a mask killing a bunch of teenagers with a long black carving knife in a small town during a Halloween party out in the middle of no were.

Extremely boring, bad acting, no plot to speak of, and the list goes on and on.  Some of the torture scenes are interesting at most, but alot of this stuff has been done in movies like ""Saw"" and ""Hostel"".  I've read some of the other reviews and for the life of me, I can't figure out why some of you are giving this movie 3 or 4 stars.  You've obviously not seen a decent horror movie before.  If you really want to see some good, and I mean Good horror movies check out Texas Chainsaw Massacre (the original), Wrong Turn (If your into the hillbilly stuff), and House of 1000 Corpses.  These are much better by far then this movie.  Please, please don't waste your money on this one.",1223942400,2,806,4.326666666666667

Some of the scenes will stay with you for days after seeing it.  The plot was a little diferent than your typical ""stranded teens"" in a remote location and the Carver family puts on a good first outing.  After finding out that this was filmed in Virginia I have been trying to find out where it was shot.  I live in Richmond.  So, if you like extreme gore with some of the torture aspects that's so popular these days then I THINK YOU WILL ENJOY THIS.  As for a rent or buy it deal.... that's up to you.

3293430,3,B001139ZE2,"The torture sub-genre of horror is all the rage, thanks to all the Saw's and Hostel's and the like that seem to pop up every month or two.  What makes these films good as opposed to jsut exercises in brutality is whether or not they provide the scares that they should.  Carver is one of these, and the fact that it pays some good homage to Texas Chainsaw Massacre in the process makes it worth checking out.  The familiar storyline involves a group of young people on a road trip that make a wrong turn, and soon enough are hunted, tortured, and murdered by a sadistic, backwoods family.  Yeah, Carver isn't original in the least, but it provides enough scares, shocks, and some blood curdling gore (including a scene involving a pair of pliers that will make you squirm) to satisfy fans of low budget horror.  Carver isn't perfect by any stretch of the imagination, but if torture horror is your thing, you could do a lot worse than what you get here.",1204675200,14,953,4.485549132947977

8240060,3,B001139ZE2,"When rating movies of this genre, there are 4 main things that I look for: good storyline, good special effects, good pacing of the plot and a good ending. To be fair, most horror flicks have elements of these - but it seems to be getting more and more difficult to find films that showcase all four.
In the special effects department (which in this case translates to blood-and-guts), this movie gets high marks. If that's what you like then there is certainly plenty of it here (to the point that your stomach might start churning). As far as the other three aspects, though, there was still something left to be desired. With carnage done up so graphically, I would like to have known more about the hacker: what was his background story? The ending seemed a bit too predictable, and the 'hard stuff' was pretty much all there was to the movie. In the past I was into this kind of horror style more - but now I look for substance when I sit down and watch a movie. The special effects though were very good - it was scary, and lives up to what 'horror' is supposed to be all about.",1523232000,,1084,4.344827586206897

Also the outhouse scene was awful. The toilet isn't even attached, and I would hate to see what that guy thinks a bad outhouse is if this one is ""pretty decent"" because, oh man. Also, I'm impressed such rusty old saws could do any damage, much less cleanly cut through bone and muscle.
