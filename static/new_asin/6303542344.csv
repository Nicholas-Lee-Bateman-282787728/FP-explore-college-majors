691547,5,6303542344,"From BBC comes another timeless classic. Middlemarch is so many things it is impossible to list them all! From love to politics, it keeps you inraptured in the wonderful story written by George Elliot. The story is supurbly played by Juliet Aubrey as Dorothea and handsome dashing Rufus Sewell as Ladislaw. This tale of forbidden love will draw you in... a must see!",1069891200,4,366,4.825396825396825
691548,2,6303542344,"Does away with most of the social issues, including the growth of the merchantile class and cross-class marriage. Poor casting/poor scripting of Rosamund and Fred Vincy and Mary Garth (Eliot's Mary doesn't speak with a working class accent, but Andrew Davies' (scriptwriter) does) and family. I may be picking nits, but this movie turns a very intelligent novel into a simple romance.
And there's none of Eliot's witty humor!!
Read the book instead...",1049068800,10,451,5.191780821917808
691549,5,6303542344,"This is a superb adaptation of George Elliot's novel of the same name. Set in nineteenth century England in the rural town of Middlemarch, it follows the lives of several of its inhabitants, as the threads of their lives intertwine with those of others. Filled with memorable characters with whom the viewer becomes engrossed over the six hours that the series runs, it is a well acted, beautifully filmed period piece.

When an idealistic, ambitious, handsome gentleman, Dr. Tertius Lydgate (Douglas Hodge), moves to Middlemarch with the expectation of running a charity hospital that will allow him the opportunity for medical research, he is teeming with anticipation at his prospects in this provincial backwater. He is quickly thrust into a situation not of his own making, however, as the town seems to be a family divided over who is to be chaplain of the hospital. Aligning himself with his benefactor, Mr. Bulstrode (Peter Jeffrey), the town's unpopular banker, he sets the path upon which he must travel. Moreover, when he freely states his opinions without regard for the existing medical establishment, he makes enemies without even  realizing it, so pure of heart is he. Upon meeting the lusciously lovely and thoroughly spoiled social climber, Rosalind Vincy (Trevyn McDowell), daughter of the town's upstart mayor, he is lost to her charms and loses sight of the prize. He sets upon yet another path that will bring him ignominy.

The lovely and intelligent Dorothea Brooke (Juliet Aubrey) is a scion of one of the wealthy first families of Middlemarch. She, too, is idealistic and wants to leave her mark on the world. Her head filled with socialist ideas, she, being pure of heart,  longs to set right wrongs perpetrated upon the poor by the wealthy landowners, a class of which she is a member. Moreover, having been denied the education available to men, she deeply admires learning in others. Unfortunately, she is taken in by the scholarly pretensions of a wealthy, middle aged cleric, the Rev. Casaubon (Patrick Malahide), and chooses to marry him over her other suitor. Thinking that she can assist her husband with his scholarly work, she discovers too late that he may have other ideas on this matter. When she meets his cousin, the romantically handsome Will Ladislaw (Rufus Sewell), this sets into motion a future event that is to have a lasting impact on Dorothea.

One would think that Dorothea and Tertius would be a perfect love match. Alas, that is not to be, as the heart of each is captured by another. Scandals, romance, intrigues, politics, and the wind of social change permeate this epic period piece. With numerous memorable characters and subplots that move the story along, the viewer remains enthralled, as the entire six hours melt away. With beautiful, lush cinematography, wonderful costumes, and ensemble acting that makes this epic period piece flow, this three tape video is a welcome addition to one's collection. Bravo!",1013299200,240,2969,5.038696537678208
691550,5,6303542344,"I haven't bought these tapes yet, but I've never forgotten Middlemarch since it was aired on PBS in 1994. I couldn't believe how I got hooked on waiting for the next one each week (and I missed three, so I've got alot to look forward to ;). Up 'til then, I'd always thought those PBS specials were just glorified soap operas (though I had enjoyed some of ""I, Claudius""). But every once-in-awhile, over the years, I've vaguely remembered it and today thought, ''hey, I wonder if I can find that PBS thing on tape.'' I couldn't even remember the name. So I went to the PBS web site and hunted it down. When I saw the words ''Dorothea,'' it all came back to me. I wish I could be more specific as to why I liked it so much... I think I fell in love with Dorothea ;). Anyway, I can't wait to finally watch all of it. I hate it when PBS does something this good. Tax money used to fund PBS is unConstitutional.",1003190400,3,905,4.177142857142857
691551,5,6303542344,"Not a faulty word or move in the whole masterpiece!  What a cast:  how does the BBC do it?  There are some 90-minute flicks on video that I'd never give a second glance.  But here's a SIX HOUR gem that I have already watched three times.
You know what?  It's because every actor on screen knows what the words mean;  they actually understand the script, and they behave in the 19th century, not as 2001-style posers.
This video could form the basis of a dozen high-school and college courses:  history, sociology, faith, economics, politics.  But it's best as a wonderful expression of the way people simply are.  I love it.  There are half a dozen stories happening, and you don't want to miss a moment of any.  And, you begin to care deeply for everyone there.
Come on, what do you do with six hours, anyway?  Watch this masterpiece!",994896000,10,835,4.530201342281879
691552,5,6303542344,"Despite a previous reviewer's assertion that the book is always better than the movie, THIS movie is far better than the book!  The turgid prose of the book bogs even excellent readers, while the movie (happily making use of the 1 picture = thousand words paradigm) entertains and enchants.  It is faithful to the book and functions beautifully as the basis of any essays you might find due.  My only caveat?  Buy lots of popcorn.",991094400,5,430,4.693333333333333
691553,4,6303542344,"Juliet Aubrey and Rufus Sewell are wonderful as the star-crossed lovers in this miniseries.  Juliet is Dorothea, an idealist who marries an old scholar, Mr. Casaubon, determined to make his life better and help him with  his work.
He couldn't care less, of course, and their marriage is a  cold one, until she meets his cousin Will (Sewell) who is as instantly  smitten as she is.
When Casaubon dies, instead of being able to go to  Will, Dorothea is stunned to find out that the evil old goat put a codicil  in his will so that she will lose everything if she marries poor Will.
We  also have the social-climbing spoiled Rosamond, who has enticed and married  Tertius, the noble doctor who seems initially more suited for Dorothea, and  Rosamond's devil-may-care brother Fred, whose life seems to be going  nowhere.
I loved this miniseries, how Will pines for Dorothea and his  heartfelt declaration is just so tender.  Fred eventually becomes a man and  Rosamond ends up getting what she wants, with poor Tertius meeting a fate  he does not deserve.
Wonderful writing and wonderful acting make this  miniseries a must-see.",960854400,10,1124,4.842105263157895
691554,4,6303542344,"I waited so long to obtain a copy of this movie I was apprehensive to see if it was worth the wait.  I am delighted to announce Middlemarch is 360 minutes of romance.  It is a movie best seen all at once but if this is not  feasible, owning it is the next best thing.
I was impressed by Juliet  Aubrey's performance and was smitten by Rufus Sewell.  It is a pleasant  change to have a movie cause a sub-conscious smile.
The scenery was  beautiful too!",948672000,24,451,4.174418604651163
691555,5,6303542344,"This is the perfect film for Anglophiles or fans of well-made classic novel adaptations. Based on George Eliot's Victorian novel, this film introduces us to such memorable characters as sweet and sensitive Dorothea  Brooke (J. Aubrey), passionate Will Ladislaw (Rufus Sewell), formidable Mr.  Casaubon, handsome Dr. Lydgate, materialistic & pretty Rosamund Vincy,  and her flighty brother Fred (Jonathan Firth),  to name a few - as well as  to their hopes, dreams, trials and triumphs.  There are 3 love stories  featured in this film (2 of them love triangles!), splendid  characterizations, high production values and an overall wonderful  miniseries!

The weakest episode is the last, when the various threads of this complex narrative are tied up in a semi-unsatisfactory way;  but that's the fault, I believe of the original novel.

A warning that this single DVD, which compresses six hours of programming onto one thin platter,  is of poor quality concerning the video (the soundtrack, rich in ambient stereo sound effects, comes off quite well).  To squeeze it all in meant severe compromises, and the resolution of the image is barely at VHS level.

691933,4,6303542344,"After I started watching this series, I realized I had seen it before many years ago, probably when it was a Masterpiece Theater presentation.  I liked this just fine.  I haven't read the book, though I own it and have been meaning to read it.  I must confess that I didn't like the character Ladislaw, though I couldn't tell you why.  Clearly he is one of the characters you are supposed to like, but I just couldn't manage it.  On the other hand, I really liked Rosanund Vincy. She is a shallow creature like you often see in period dramas, but what came through wa that she really loved Dr. Lydgate.

There are a lot of subplots here and most of them re handled pretty well. Still, in watching the show, I had this feeling that a lot was being left out as far as depth is concerned, which isn't surprising considering the length of the book.  Clearly I will want to read it now.

There is what is called a feature that comes with the DVD.  It is referred to as a reader's guide, and that is exactly what it is.  Usually a behind the scenes documentary has interviews with the actors or crew, or deleted scenes, and so on.  This DVD talks almost entirely about the book and the author, and merely shows scenes from the program to illustrate its points.  It is almost like they filmed the feature  separately and then used post-production to weave it into the series.

So this isn't what I would call a stunning or vibrant adaption of a classic novel, but it is entertaining and I would recommend it to anyone who likes periods dramas.",1442102400,3,1536,4.381625441696113

692252,5,6303542344,"I had startged to watch this when the series was originally televised, but hadn't finished it, so I was anxious to see the whole series. I though Eliot does a brilliant job of showing the power of gossip and innuendo and how lives could virtually be ruined because of it. The era showed just how much money and marriage were intertwined and how flawed characters could be drawn into ill-suited relationships. Eliot manages to skewer the hypocrisy of British societal mores at the time, without losing his sense of humor. It was a well paced and lively series that ended well. Very entertaining.",1418860800,,594,4.776699029126213

The role of the workers in the village was not illuminated so a reader with little knowledge of the industrial revolution viewed the video without thinking much about their role.

Had I read this, perhaps I would have set some of my foolish concepts of 'love' aside, and made better choices in life.  This novel captures and fleshes out the characters so well, that they with their qualities, foolishness and failures make them so recognizable.  Eliot always sets up a moral struggle, and illustrates the foibles of those who have moral failings, and are unable to act in their own self interest.  It is so applicable today as our technology and social mores change, but human nature makes little forward strides. Both men and women today also fixate on that perfect other, and rationalize away the truth that is often apparent to all around them. This blindness to character flaws is the undoing of most relationships.  It is a morality tale that has lessons for any young woman or man...it is about those lessons that somehow our parents fail to teach us.",1407542400,4,985,4.611428571428571

If you enjoy this film, and the novel itself, you might find the book MY LIFE IN MIDDLEMARCH of interest.  The author has insights about the story I hadn't realized.

I think they did something wrong in their quality control.  The first DVD player I put the brand new disc into would not read side A, though it did read and play side B.  Blurry images were an obvious problem.  The disc had no identification except for very small print around the center circle.  A single disc is used to hold 6 episodes plus the Reader's Guide. Amazon's return for refund page suggested I trouble shoot and try the disc in another player, so I did, and found that both sides would play in that machine.  I watched some episodes on both sides to explore the quality.  I thoroughly enjoyed the Reader's Guide and was glad to see a list of titled scenes within each episode.  I would have welcomed a card insert or little booklet listing everything.  The subtitles worked and that is important for two people in the family.  I did not find Middlemarch available on blu-ray, so the three-VHS set is my only other option.  BBC, please get this done to higher standards.  A powerfully performed classic like this deserves it.  A lot more special features would be fantastic and additional languages too.

Juliet Aubrey portrays Dorothea, a strong-willed and independent minded woman who is determined to improve lives. When these two young people collide, their lives change in a manner that they had never envisioned. This adaptation, thanks to an excellent script by Andrew Davies (who also penned the script for the glorious 1995 adaptation of Pride and Prejudice starring Colin Firth and Jennifer Ehle) and the great cast, bring the life of a town on the brink of the Industrial Revolution to vivid life.

It is almost as if a camera crew went back in time and captured each character and event  as it happened. Productions such as these put Hollywood to shame, and the seven hours devoted to the story do complete justice to the book which I read only in Cliff Notes in English class to pass the test. (with another five hours it might also have done justice to the social and political history included in the book, but im not complaining). The dramatic tension reached a complete climax in the final episode, that one almost had to keep telling oneself that it was only a story to relieve the dramatic tension. Now if the creators of this wonderful dramatization would only do the same for such American books as ""Lily Queen"" and ""Alienation of Affection.""",1312070400,2,846,4.64
693214,4,6303542344,"There are so many 'main' characters in Middlemarch, it's like a soap opera, but none of it is over-the-top or filler. I quickly chose the storyline for Rosie as my favorite, wondering what would happen to their debt issues, her feeling of being ruined in her home town. I also enjoyed the story of Dorethea, and wondered how her marriage to a man who looked like a walking, balding skeleton would work out. That storyline left me a little wanting, as the relationships Dorethea built and the lives she touched was not built up in enough, even for this long, long series.

The costumes and settings and little knick-knacks were right on par. The horses, beautiful. The accents, for the most-part, seemed authentic.

Now for me, Thomas Hardy stole every scene he was in. You might know him from All Creatures Great and Small! He played Sigfried and in MM was just as bouncy and spoke with that outlandish air we all love from ACGAS. He was a delight and I wish he had been in it even more.

The beginning was a bit confusing, as they introduced all the characters (pretty much) right off and all of their names were too much for me. It turns out I followed along just fine and for good or bad, every character they had introduced right in the beginning was important. So don't watch this when you are sleepy or trying to do something else. No multitasking during MM.

Overall the movie left me feeling melancholy but that I had seen something well-done. Also, while the scenery and so forth was always beautiful, it was a little washed out, possibly due to the age of the movie.

If you enjoy movies like Bleak House (one of my favorites, be sure to see it!) and Pride and Prejudice, give Middlemarch a chance. Have fun!",1311552000,3,1718,4.511254019292605

693216,5,6303542344,"The story is a little slow to develop, and there isn't one true hero or heroine. There is one wealthy young woman who seeks to make a difference in the lives of the downtrodden people she sees as she rides through the woods to her great home. Others in her class ignore the plight of the people, but she wants to make a difference. A new doctor comes to town and he also has noble ideas, but no money to back it up. One would think that the two of them would fall in love and live happily ever after, but that's not the way the story goes.

She marries a man she apparently loves, only to lose the right to make a difference.
He marries a woman of little brain, who just doesn't get it. She reminds me of David Copperfield's first wife, Dora, but even though she starts out with similar sweetness and character, you'll have to wait to see how that turns out. At times she made me want to shake her. The power of that woman to control, and even possibly bring to ruin, the husband who had so much promise is contrasted to that of Dorthea, a woman of great promise and empathy, who is controlled by her husband to the point that she cannot fulfill her passion to make a difference. She is powerless.

The other characters are interesting, at least an hour or so after you get into the movie and the plot develops a little. The start is slow.",1272758400,7,1339,4.206225680933852

There are some scenes I wish they focused more on--like the jewel scene. It's in the first episode, but Dorothea's indecisiveness of accepting the jewels was not played out, but the dinner scene following it was wonderfully done.

Anyway, other than a few things I wish they went more in depth in,this is a very good adaptation of the book. I love the cast.

693283,2,6303542344,"Mr. Brooke, played by Robert Hardy, was the only likeable character for me.  He at least had some range.  Dorothea, the heroine, took martyrdom to a new level and the actress who played her, Juliet Aubrey, apparently is of the school of minimalist acting, i.e., she didn't do any.  I had to keep turning up the volume to hear her because she whispered her lines, then her husband Mr. Casaubon, played by Patrick Malahide (who was much better as Sir Francis Walsingham alongside Helen Mirren as Queen Elizabeth) shouted at her so I then had to turn down the volume.  There was no chemistry whatsoever between her and Ladislaw and after her husband died, I couldn't have cared less as to whether or not she and Ladislaw got together.

Dr. Lydgate and his wife Rosamund are just plain laughable.  She spent money like a drunken sailor, then blamed her husband when they went broke.  He, of course, was too busy undressing her both w/his eyes and literally to notice that they were out of money until the bailiffs came aknockin'.

It kept me entertained for at least a week. I know that a lot of people don't like long movies which would be true if you had to sit threw it all at once. But it had the option to play all or just one part at a time. The movie in itself was very moving. Tells of how sometimes marrying for the wrong reasons that you might think are the right reasons can be unsatisfying and lead to a lonely life. Then the spouse can be very vendictive even in death. She loved her husband but he still was very reserved and unloving up to the end and even in his will. I really did enjoy the other stories in this movie too.

693285,5,6303542344,"To say that a series is a ""BBC British period production"" is to say that the film was crafted with the kind of care and skill that is the standard for making a Rolls Royce engine.  You expect quality and you get quality.  Whether you are watching a series based on Charles Dickens or George Eliot novels, the BBC gives you a memorable experience.  Perhaps it is because England has cultivated such a splendid assortment of credible actors specializing in this genre.  Perhaps it is the quality of the screen-writing, the cinematography, direction or some combination of everything. Whatever it is, the ""union"" label here means something.

Middlemarch is named after a town in England, just prior to the Industrial Revolution, when social unrest was causing the entrenched political structure to unravel, and people were looking towards upward mobility and questioning the entitlements of the landed aristocracy.  A young, idealistic doctor, moves into this very staid town where for generations business has been conducted the same way, and the same elite families held sway.  He dreams of cutting edge medical research (actually dissecting corpses) and devoting his services for free to a charity hospital.  A young, idealistic young woman chafes at the societal restraints around her desire to help the poor, especially by building cottages.  Though the two marry different people and there is no romantic link between them, they end up with lives very different from their ideals.

This is a six part series on DVD and time flies when you are watching it.  There are many plots and sub-plots and characters, all of them interesting and most interrelated.  Highly recommended.",1248566400,7,1678,5.1286764705882355

693287,5,6303542344,"I purchased Middlemarch because I had heard it was a good period piece.  I was not disappointed; in fact, the mini-series exceeded my expectations by a good measure.

I'll confess right off that I've never read the book.  However, I assume it follows pretty closely because the screenplay was written by the ever-reliable Andrew Davies (who also penned the superb 1995 definitive version of Pride and Prejudice, as well as many other films of Austen's novels).  The film deftly blends multiple story lines and never loses track of any of them.

The main story line is that of the very bright Dorothea Brooke, played in an understated way by the lovely Juliet Aubrey.  Dorothea is a young niece of the aristocratic Arthur Brooke (the always excellent Robert Hardy), who is painfully, but cheerfully trying to make the transition from the late-feudal Britain to a country marked by the rise of popular democracy.

Dorothea is attracted to men of intelligence and ideas.  She is drawn to the much older scholar Rev. Edward Casaubon, who is engaged in an exhaustive study of mythology.  He has spent copious amounts of time researching his subject, but little actual writing.  Dorothea (or Dodo, as her sister Celia has dubbed her) yearns for a 'soulful life', though her sister doesn't see the attraction, nor for that matter does the rest of the family, including her father.  Sir James Chettam, a family friend, who is wealthy and much interested in Dorothea's attractiveness as well as her intelligence, seems a much better choice, as he is closer to her age.  But Dorothea is undaunted.  She is excited by the idea of helping Dr. Casaubon in his study, and, at first, so is he.  So, they marry.

All is not plum perfection in the new relationship, though, primarily once Rev. Casaubon's moody, restless cousin Will Ladislaw shows up.  There is an instant attraction between Dorothea and Will, that is evident to everyone including Casaubon.

Meanwhile, Dr. Tertius Lydgate has arrived in Middlemarch (a fictitious town set in the Midlands of England in the mid-19th century, placing it between Jane Austen and Charles Dickens).  He has ambition, and seeks to improve the medical profession and health care in the England that is removed from the big cities such as London.  He has decided to remain a bachelor for the time being, though there is pressure on him to settle down in short order.  One of the young ladies he is acquainted with is the pretty, but vacuous Rosamond Vincy, who is the niece of the pompous, dictatorial, but very rich Mr. Bulstrode, who is in charge of a group of city elders who control much of what goes on in Middlemarch.  Rosamond is smitten by Dr. Lydgate, who is handsome, intelligent, but poor.  Rosie, and Dr. Lydgate calls her, has misunderstood Dr. Lydgate's attentions to mean that he means to marry her.  When he explains to her that he has had no such intention, she becomes hysterical and cries unceasingly.  To calm her, Dr. Lydgate promises to marry her, a promise that will lead to much regret on his part.

It's a film with a multitude of plot lines, as the above description hints at, but the George Eliot (and Davies) pulls it off well, and the whole remains cohesive and neatly wrapped up in the end.

This really is a must-see for those who love Jane Austen, Charles Dickens, or the Bronte sisters.  It's one of the best period pieces set in the 18th and 19th century England.

Not to be missed; I loved it.  Very highly recommended!",1244246400,6,3481,4.764607679465776
693288,5,6303542344,"After coming off from watching more light-hearted, but still fairly heavy BBC period dramas (North and South and Secret Garden). it was a very jarring change indeed to watch ""MiddleMarch"".  Still, because I had always wanted to read MiddleMarch and ""Silas Marner"" by George Eliot is one of my favorite books, I pressed on through watching the first episode, which was very hard at first due to the amount of and breadth of the characters, and finished watched MiddleMarch very satisfied indeed.

  It is very easy to see why ""Pride and Prejudice"" and ""North and South"" recieve almost unanimously great ratings, whereas this one tends to be either love or hate.  George Eliot did not write in the manner Jane Austin did, Jane Austin usually (although not always) wrote about people who were in high society and were in some relational pursuit and it almost always ends well.  Not to say bad things don't happen, they just don't feel as bleak as they do as in George Eliot's  writing because she wrote from a far more realistic perspective.  This does not discredit Jane Austin, but she uses a very different medium to get her message across than Eliot does most of the time.

  The story of MiddleMarch is very complex and involves three major story lines, and a few minor ones, but all of these storylines and sub-plots are interwoven.  It is not so much about one event, but it is about life and how the decisions we make can affect the course of not only our entire lives, but others as well.  Both the characters of Dorethea and Tertius Lidgate rush into matrimonial unions with disasterous and unexpected results.  Whereas, Tertius' wife Rosemand's brother Frederick comes from very low beginnings to bring his life out of the ashes for the one he loves.

  To say that this movie has no happy endings is ludicrous, two of the main characters end up very happy, one just got scarred along the way.  While the other lead character did not end up happy in the end because of the choices made.

  These different characters choices contrast, it is almost impossible to say much without revealing the twist and turns and ending.  It shows us what happens when we make hasty decisions to marry based on our feelings without actually knowing a person.  These people had to face the consequences, divorce was not such an easy option in those days.

  Probably the most enjoyable for me to watch was the relationship between Tertious and Rosemund.  The dynamics in their relationship are amazing!  Having been through a very trying and year with my fiance (whom I am certain is the right person for me), I have learned how not to deal with my fiance.  Interestingly enough the very things he and I once did to eachother Tertius and Rosemund do.  She constantly tries to undermine his authority and he constantly gives into her demands because he cares about her and is to weak and naive to realize what she really does need is to suffer for once in her life.

  I read many of the negative reviews and I understand why they are given, but I do not agree with them in the least.  Yes, this is long and a bit slow at times, but it is very gripping because the characters are very real and you want to know whether or not they will find happiness.  Yes, there is some sensuality, but I didn't think it was gross; it was merely passionate kissing within a marriage relationship and it illustrated the immaturity of the relationship very well.  I have already answered the question of whether or not there are happy endings, there are, but it is just a very long a tiring ride by the time you get there, which is WHY I very much recommend watching this over the course of a week or so. Personally, I finished it all in one day because I had to know what haoppened!

  If you like geat acting, a gripping and very complicated story, and very complex and realistic characters as well as situations that are not sugar-coated, but true to life; then you will love MiddleMarch.  If you do not like stories in this vein then you probably shouldn't waste your time.

What a disappointment to discover that although the characters are acted well, and the storylines had promise.... the film in itself dragged terribly.
Each time there was a promise of drama, excitement, passion, intrigue....it would immediately fizzle out - or to be more descriptive - the scenes and characters would never fully reach their dramatic potential either in words or actions.  The moment was cut off, the feeling didn't come across completely - for lack of better terms, things would never climax, situation to situation.

Do not get me wrong, it was a very compelling story with different personalities of scoundrels and saints.  Dorothea is angelic and steadfast, and although the scenes with the doctor and his spoilt wife were the most ""fully"" dramatic in his angers and their troubles - he is still a man to be admired for how much he tried to do for others and his marriage.  There are several love stories/couples within the film - but again, none of them seem epic, heart-felt, deep or passionate.

I did try to be captivated by the movie - but one shouldn't have to try.

693499,3,6303542344,"Although this BBC miniseries is not the top one we've seen, it still has its moments.  Also, it's quite a bargain for 7 hours of viewing.  To be sure, rich character development, beautiful scenery, and fine acting, are all there.  But the story is very much a 19th century soap opera with many of the key characters acting in a self-destructive, petulant way.  Middlemarch is a pseudonym for one of the midland cities in England, most likely, Coventry.  The town has its country charm, but many of the inhabitants are small-minded and petty.  Few characters are really worth worrying about, with the exception of the Garth family who will be noted further below.

The central character, Dorothea Brooke, is born to an aristocratic life, along with her sister Cecilia.  Their parents died while the sisters were young and both girls are taken in by their uncle, Arthur Brooke, played by Robert Hardy.  He dotes on the girls as if they were his own and tries to make them happy.  Despite all this, Dorothea feels guilty for her privileged life and longs to do something profound in the world.  Instead of marrying the next door neighbor, the dashing, young Sir James Chettam, she is attracted to an old fossil and religious scholar, Rev. Edward Casaubon, who is at least 20 years older than her.  (Sir James marries Cecilia in one of the few bright spots of the story).  Dorothea's life with Casaubon turns into a nightmare, as their marriage is never physically consummated.  One reason for this may be that every day for him is a ""bad hair day.""  Mr. Casaubon spends his time on vainglorious sophistry and religious wanderings and eventually dies of a heart attack.  While this is going on, the young idealist, Mr. Ladislaw, Casaubon's nephew, meets and falls for Dorothea.  We learn that one of the stipulations in Casaubon's will is that Dorothea will lose her position and fortune if she marries Ladislaw. Of course, this is what happens in the end and viewers are left wondering she didn't give away her estate first and then run off with Ladislaw.  At the conclusion of the story, the narrator tells us that Ladislaw is elected to Parliament but doesn't say much more.  We're left to hope that he and Dorothea had a happy life together after much disappointment and despair.  Nevertheless, we're told that when Dorothea dies she is left in an ""unvisited tomb.""  Who needs that?

Other threads of the story are equally soapy, as we are introduced to the young doctor, Lydgate, and his eventual bride, Rosamund Vincy.  Rosamund is daughter to Mr. and Mrs. Vincy.  He is a merchant and the town mayor.  Son Fred is a disappointment to his family throughout most of the story and has trouble making his way in the world. (Fred is played by Colin Firth's younger brother Jonathan and thus is the only connection we could find to the 1995 production of ""Pride and Prejudice.""  After getting depressed watching ""Middlemarch,"" we just had to re-view segments of P & P.)  Fred is befriended by Mr. Caleb Garth, father of Mary Garth, Fred's love interest.  Mary won't accept marrying Fred until he learns how to make a respectable living which he eventually does as apprentice to her father.  They manage some of the local farms and estates and do well.  Fred and Mary eventually end up together which is about the only trace of a happy ending this long story provides.

Back to Dr. Lydgate, he is also an idealist and donates his time in building up a big, new hospital in Middlemarch.  He hopes to make the hospital a major center for the study and cure of fevers of all types.  In his private practice, Lydgate does much to upset the existing social structure and becomes unpopular with most of the local power brokers.  An example of this is where Lydate suggests a glass of wine for one of the locals rather than a concoction from an older doctor.  (At this stage, viewers may be tempted to reach for a bottle of wine or something stronger, too.)  Lydgate does gain support from Mr. Nicholas Bulstrode who becomes his friend and patron.  Sadly, Bulstrode, the banker, makes important enemies and brings Lydgate down with him.  At the end of the story, we're told that Lydgate dies at age 50, and Rosamund re-marries an elder physician.  So much for idealism.

We've never had much interest in George Eliot and doubt we will pursue any of her other works.  If they're like ""Middlemarch,"" about the only conclusion one might have is that it sure is better living today, with all our problems, than having lived 200 years ago in a sad place like Middlemarch.  If you want to immerse yourself in British period drama from the 1800's that has real punch and a happy ending, try ""North and South.""",1163289600,7,4691,4.691554467564259

693548,5,6303542344,"George Eliot (1819-1880) was a brilliant Victorian intellectual whose novels were written for adults. In this marvelous BBC series we see her words come to vibrant life!

Middlemarch unlocks the secrets of the inhabitants of a town

in the 1830s in the English Midlands. Industrialization in the

form of the railroad; the Reform Bill; the changes in the medical profession are all manifest in this series. Middlemarch is beautifully filmed with outstanding actors such as Juliet

Aubrey and Rufus Sewell makiing the characters come alive.

The story deals with three principal characters:

Dr. Lydgate who marries poorly and lives to regret it as he

courts and wins the shallow, vain and money grubbing Rosamund

Vincy.

Dorothea Brooks is the rich woman who marries a pedant but is

loved by his cousin Will Ladislaw.

Fred Vincy loves Mary Garth but has problems with gambling and

debt. Fred is the brother of Rosy.

  The novel also delves into the unsavoury past of Mayor Nick

Bulstrode whose past is revealed by the visit of the awful Mr.

Raffles who knew him back when!

  Middlemarch is seven hours long and first ran in the USA on

Masterpiece Theatre. The pace is leisurely and slow for many

American viewers used to quicker action. However, this BBC

adaption is well worth the time as it explores character in

depth; tells a classic tale with superb actors. The costuming

is realistic and accurate to the period. The music is dramatic

and the story told is classic.

  I highly recommend this exquisite production! Excellent!",1152230400,17,1545,4.92578125

693551,5,6303542344,"This is a superb adaptation of George Elliot's novel of the same name. Set in nineteenth century England in the rural town of Middlemarch, it follows the lives of several of its inhabitants, as the threads of their lives intertwine with those of others. Filled with memorable characters with whom the viewer becomes engrossed over the six hours that the series runs, it is a well acted, beautifully filmed period piece.

When an idealistic, ambitious, handsome gentleman, Dr. Tertius Lydgate (Douglas Hodge), moves to Middlemarch with the expectation of running a charity hospital that will allow him the opportunity for medical research, he is teeming with anticipation at his prospects in this provincial backwater. He is quickly thrust into a situation not of his own making, however, as the town seems to be a family divided over who is to be chaplain of the hospital. Aligning himself with his benefactor, Mr. Bulstrode (Peter Jeffrey), the town's unpopular banker, he sets the path upon which he must travel. Moreover, when he freely states his opinions without regard for the existing medical establishment, he makes enemies without even realizing it, so pure of heart is he. Upon meeting the lusciously lovely and thoroughly spoiled social climber, Rosalind Vincy (Trevyn McDowell), daughter of the town's upstart mayor, he is lost to her charms and loses sight of the prize. He sets upon yet another path that will bring him ignominy.

The lovely and intelligent Dorothea Brooke (Juliet Aubrey) is a scion of one of the wealthy first families of Middlemarch. She, too, is idealistic and wants to leave her mark on the world. Her head filled with socialist ideas, she, being pure of heart, longs to set right wrongs perpetrated upon the poor by the wealthy landowners, a class of which she is a member. Moreover, having been denied the education available to men, she deeply admires learning in others. Unfortunately, she is taken in by the scholarly pretensions of a wealthy, middle aged cleric, the Rev. Casaubon (Patrick Malahide), and chooses to marry him over her other suitor. Thinking that she can assist her husband with his scholarly work, she discovers too late that he may have other ideas on this matter. When she meets his cousin, the romantically handsome Will Ladislaw (Ruffin Sewell), this sets into motion a future event that is to have a lasting impact on Dorothea.

One would think that Dorothea and Tertius would be a perfect love match. Alas, that is not to be, as the heart of each is captured by another. Scandals, romance, intrigues, politics, and the wind of social change permeate this epic period piece. With numerous memorable characters and subplots that move the story along, the viewer remains enthralled, as the entire six hours melt away. With beautiful, lush cinematography, wonderful costumes, and ensemble acting that makes this epic period piece flow, this film is a welcome addition to one's collection.

693583,5,6303542344,"George Eliot has always been among my favorite authors, and ""Middlemarch"" is without a doubt her masterpiece. Given the multitude of characters, plot complexity and psychological depth of the book, I feared that ""Middlemarch"" would never be made into a successful film. That entire plots would be dropped in the interest of time, or the whole of it so neatly packaged as to render it a mere shadow.

Yet in this six-episode, seven-hour series, BBC has created a vivid, authentic distillation of one of the greatest novels of the 19th century. Casting is superb-- particularly the luminous Juliet Aubrey as the quietly passionate, idealistic Dorothea Brooke, and the marvelous Rachel Power as pragmatic Mary Garth.

All the residents of Middlemarch come to full-blooded life in this remarkable adaptation of what is indeed a milestone of fiction-- a social drama with an edge of Austen parody, but with little of her sentimentality. Eliot was far too much of an intellectual, and in Middlemarch, she establishes herself as the godmother of the modern 20th century novel.

Middlemarch is foremost a human drama of hypocrisy and foible, of ambition, success and failure. The spoils go to the victors, who aren't always worthy; and those meant to inherit the earth usually end little more than 6 feet of it. And yet, all too rarely, there are those who do find love and fulfillment in the guise of a soul mate.

Eliot wrote Middlemarch with her usual detachment, painting characters in broad and intimate strokes, but ultimately leaving the reader to pass judgment-- just as her characters do among each other. This perfectly crafted series takes a similar path, never insisting that we love or hate a character, but simply see them as products of their environments, bound intrinsically to their fates, and only with great courage breaking free of convention.",1143331200,46,1856,5.055555555555555

Add that to the brilliant performances, and engaging story, I have watched it over 30 times.  The reason it is only 4 stars is that this breathtaking, artistically literate  cinematography was marred in the transferring to DVD... the aspect ratio was changed, making everything slightly longer and narrower than in the video.  It is frustrating.  Sigh.  To those who have not seen it before, you will probably not notice it, unless you focus on when people turn their heads in close up.  My other quibble is that these DVDs do not include the really wonderful commentary done before each section in the Masterpiece Theatre presentations.  Let's hope they'll add those in as a special feature in following editions.  Get it in video if available.  I'm still glad I have it, and it will be watched time and again.

The story sounds gentile and ambling in an Austen style but is actually pacy and complex, touching on the hopes, dreams and dashed realities of many of it's characters as they try to find a way to live in within their social parimeters and subtle force/raise their own agendas.

 This production is cracking and will leave you wanting, the costumes and period locating are spot on. Worth the six hours, you will doubtless get so hooked as to do it in one sitting.

 Fans may wish to know that the series was filmed in Stanford in Lincolnshire, a beautiful Georgian/Regency market Town between Leicester and Peterborough.

As to the production itself, it certainly is interesting in many respects and a great deal of effort has gone into recreating the period. Unfortunately the same amount of effort did not go into dramatic pacing. This is a slow plodding effort with no clear direction.

Although the miniseries is not completely faithful to the book, it is, like so many other BBC miniseries and other BBC programs we have seen on Masterpiece Theater, a marvelously well done story in its own right. In common with all true classics, it contains drama as well as comedy, tragedy as well as lightheartedness; it also has a large number of characters, running a continuum from the silly to the too serious, from the selfish and criminal to the altruistic and those with impeccable intergrity. The BBC has at its command a wonderful group of superb actors, and I detect nary a misstep in their performances. This is one of my favorite novels and this is one of my favorite movies or miniseries, which I have viewed many times. It always brings a pleasurable experience, even though the author, ever true to human nature, does not make a cheery, happy end to every plotline. I recommend the book to everyone who wishes to learn more of people; you will find people in the book similar to some you know yourself. I recommend the DVD for the same reason.

Different from most period piece movies in the fact there is a lot more politics, science, etc than you'd find in a Jane Austen movie.

Although you are happy to see them together in the end, you don't really know why they fell in love and you don't really care that much if they end up together.  Some great stories of tragedy that are done far better than the love stories.",1116460800,2,617,4.301724137931035
693647,5,6303542344,"MIDDLEMARCH, the film, is not exactly faithful to the book of the same name. Although most folks will appreciate the depiction of this tale, I recommend you read the book.  The film would have you believe that Ms Brooke fell in love with Will Ladislaw the first time she saw him, but the book makes it clear that although Ladislaw loved Dorothea from early on, Dorothea (played bu the wonderful Juliet Aubrey) had no such notions and  loved only her husband, the narrow Causabon (Patrick Malahide).

MIDDLEMARCH is a tragedy. Dorothea's greatest wish, that her life have meaning is denied her. First, she falls in love with a clergyman much older than herself and marries him against the wishes of many family members and friends. Then she gives up the estate she inherits when he dies, and with which she could have done much good.  She is forced to do this because he has left a stipulation in his will that she forfeit everything should she marry his nephew (impoverished by the actions of Causabon's family).

Dorothea Brooke marries Causabon with the hope of assisting him in the development of his work entitled ""The Key to All Mythology"", an ambitions undertaking reminiscent of `The Golden Bough' developed by Sir James Frazier around the turn of the century (19th-20th).  However, Causabon holds an attitude typical of his times -  he believes women are not capable of scholarly pursuits. It is only when he is near the end of his own life, with his health failing, that he allows Dorothea to read to him and translate sections of  the Latin texts, but it is too late.

When she marries Will Ladislaw, Elliot (voice of Judy Dench) tells us of Dorothea, ""Her full nature, like that river of which Cyrus broke the strength, spent itself in channels which had no great name on earth. But the effect of her being around those around her was incalculably diffusive: for the growing good of the world is partly dependent on unhistoric acts; and that things are not so ill with you and me as they might have been, is half owing to the number who lived faithfully a hidden life, and rest in unvisited tombs.""

Dorothea's counterpart (MIDDLEMARCH is two books) is Doctor Lydgate, filled with noble aspirations which are laid in the dust by the profligate spending of his adored young wife. Lydgate wants to conduct research on Typhus and Cholera, and help the poor and ill with a new hospital dedicated to their needs.  Dorothea wants to help him, but when she loses her fortune, their plans are lost and Lydgate must move to London and take up work that supports the lifestyle his ambitious and overweening wife clearly desires.

Acorn's DVD version of the film is well done, although not remastered ( I finally parted with my old tapes). The shots in England and Rome are much deteriorated since the early 1980s, so it may be worth owing the DVD if for no other reason than to have an idea of how Rome looked before automotive exhaust and ribbons of highway destroyed areas that had stood for thousands of years.

George Elliot was Mary Ann Evans, and Evans was a contemporary of Hardy. Both followed in the footsteps of Dickens and took up the cause of the folks disenfranchised by the Enclosure Acts, and in Elliot's case--the plight of women. This classic speaks to our times.",1114646400,18,3281,4.695121951219512
693648,5,6303542344,"I read Middlemarch 5 times in college, and did a thesis thereon.

One misses only Eliot's elegant sentences but, surely, for that one must return to hard copy which, all these decades later, I certainly plan to do.",1114214400,13,429,4.706666666666667

The film, while attempting to be comprehensive in its picture of connections in an 18th century British town, loses its focus, allowing its characters to drift and wander in and out of the story. If there is a main character, it is Dr. Lydgate, who does maintain some interest as he struggles with his disillusionment. The relationship of Dorothea and Mr. Ladislaw was just not believable. Perhaps better casting of the two would have helped make it work, but I am unsure.  They never really seemed compatible, and their love story just did not work for us, given their characters. While there is a palette of interesting characters, none are held onto or followed long enough to really understand them.  We tried to maintain some interest in the film, but by the end, it was just curiosity as to the outcome that kept us viewing. The ending, by the way, was unbelievable too--too contrived and too neat, in our way of thinking,for the 6 hours that preceded it.
