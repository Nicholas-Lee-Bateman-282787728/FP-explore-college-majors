2354660,4,B000A2XB9U,"Even though you can be against the war in Irak, this is a typical tribute show made with ""american style"" that is always good to see. I bought because I'm a Kiss fan, but I finally found a good show, good sound, good artists.

Kiss, as always, it's the strongest show. Only 3 songs at the end, but all the power put in stage. Kiss is as good as ever, and this is just one of the proves.",1130112000,5,386,3.948717948717949
2354661,5,B000A2XB9U,"Is that I work at Camp Pendleton & went to this show.  What an event.  I had recently seen that the dvd was released & will be purchasing it very soon.  Now, i'm not in the military ( did spend 11 years as a Navy Corpman ) & am lucky enough to work on the base & had been invited to the show.  What these artists did was truly amazing, & what the base did was equally unbelievable.  You figure that the stage would be small, no pyro, not a big production.  WOW WAS I WRONG.  Full pyro, stage sets, the whole 9.  Ted, Godsmack, Richie ( who was awesome, can't get enough of acoustic Bon Jovi hits ), & of course KISS were amazing.  Destiny's Child ( not really a big fan, but they put on an awesome show, let me tell ya ).  Even the other bands i'm not to fond of put on one helluva show ( Hootie, Ja Rule ).  Now, like I said, I didn't get the video yet, but after going to this show in person, I KNOW IT'S AWESOME...  Enjoy...",1127692800,,927,3.8983957219251337
2354662,5,B000A2XB9U,"I just got my Copy of Rockin the Corps...

Featuring our Boys KISS!!!!

This was a concert/event to pay tribute to the U.S. Marines returning from Iraq, Over 50,000 Marines, sailors and family members attended at Del Mar Beach, Camp Pendleton.

I was going to wait on this one till I saw what others thought...

But in the absence of The ""Rock The Nation"" DVD ...

I needed this ""fix""...

Well, I wanted to sit back and enjoy the whole show but I couldn't...

So I Zipped to Ted Nugent...Kicking it off with the Star Spangled Banner...

Than Godsmack....

Boy do these guys get the Party started right!

Godsmack, in the KISS vein, Make sure their fans see a Rock show!

This makes me want to see them all the more.

Ted is in his glory as Godsmack backs him up....

you can see the joy on the faces of the guys in Godsmack

as they look like kids in a candy store getting to Jam with Ted!

A dream of any self respecting Rocker!

After that I had to Zoom to Kiss!!!...

(I had too...)

Though the Guys did 5 songs that night...

Sadly only 3 are featured here.

Detroit Rock City

One of the first things that is obvious is

Paul is Not Dancing and Jumping up to his normal form (This being due to this happening shortly after his surgery...).

Does that Stop Kiss from Being entertaining...

HELL NO!

The Guys kick it and everybody does their thing.

In what one might think of as an unusual sight,

The crowd is littered with folks in Kiss War Paint...

Gene is unusually animated!!!

reminding me of his younger days.

Up next is ..

Love Gun ... which Paul kicks off Accapella

and boom the boys are back to Rockin'

Of course the Last song is ...Surprise

Rock and Roll All Nite!

Wow! The Amount of Pyro they use is amazing!

Paul Smashes a Guitar.. All Hell Breaks Loose...

All is right with the World!

The crowd is really into this show!...

The Bands are giving it up for folks that they respect.

it shows in every performance.

Even the Bands and entertainers that

I wasn't necessarily into

show their Heart.

I could have lived with Richie Sambora doing maybe

1 less song...or Hootie in the Blowfish doing one less...

and Hey!...the could have put the other 2 Kiss songs on there...

Destiny's Child is Easy on the Eyes of The Ken Man...

So, I was entertained....

would I recommend it?

it is very entertaining.. YES... should you buy it...

I will say this, A portion of all proceeds has been pledged to benefit our troops and their families through Support The Corps, Inc., a tax-exempt, nonprofit/charitable organization.

so it's a Double Good thing... you get to see our Boys.. and Help our Boys in the Armed Forces...

2354664,5,B000A2XB9U,"I recently viewed the premiere on INHD2 (Hi-Def channel) and it was incredible.

With a high-energy series of live musical performances including Godsmack, Kiss, Ritchie Sambora (belting out 3 Bon Jovi tunes) and Ted Nugent just to name a few. I would recommend this to any rock music enthusiast for these performances alone... It's a shame there isn't a CD available!!

The program is very well produced with short performance introductions, split screen intermissions featuring Marine activities, comments and backstage antics of the performers, Very to-the-point and complete.

I would highly recommend this DVD and am personally looking forward to its release.",1120953600,9,664,5.490196078431373

8073486,2,B000A2XB9U,"I love almost every band on this DVD. Kiss, Godsmack, Sambora, Uncle Ted, you name it, these guys ALL kick ass, and the fact that they did this show says a LOT about their dedication to this country. The best of the best performances, and collaborations here. Just awesome!!!

The ONE (huge) drawback to this? Censorship. You'd think I would have bought this thing at Wal-Mart. You just do NOT censor rock concerts, period!!! This takes a HUGE part of the experience from it!!! Sure, you get the idea, but what, are we 12 now? Censoring performances like this is just tacky!!!

Petty? Maybe, but let's get real here, I have been to countless shows over the past 10 years, and its just WRONG to censor this stuff. Yeah, maybe taking the nudity out of 'em (flashing) is needed, but seriously, WTF???

Do NOT buy this if you're after the REAL experience. Talk about a HUGE disappointment !!!",1312502400,,888,4.6075949367088604
8073487,5,B000A2XB9U,I ordered this dvd a week before Christmas knowing I would not get it in time. But I was wrong it was here on the 24th Thank you so much!,1232928000,,137,3.6
8073488,5,B000A2XB9U,No one ever has or ever will do it quite as good as these guys do.,1193961600,,66,3.1875
8073489,3,B000A2XB9U,"I appreciate the artists who played this show for our Marines.  Regardless of your opinions on the current war, the armed forces are still in the line of fire and we should always recognize and honor their service.  This was a rare show of support from the entertainment industry which is usually too high on it's own self-important horse to say thanks.

Now, onto the show...

Godsmack and Nuge kick ass, pure and simple.

The comedians aren't so great.

Ritchie Sambora does a low-key but respectable set.

Destiny's Child is smokin' Hot!!

But to be honest, the only reason I went out of my way to see it in the theatre was to see KISS on the big screen.  Despite the way-too-long patriotic rant from Paul Stanley KISS rules the stage as always.  Only three songs, probably not worth the full asking price for this DVD, and KISS fans will skip to these performances anyway.  I'd say save your $$$ for the Rock The Nation DVD releasing in December.",1131235200,3,950,4.562130177514793
