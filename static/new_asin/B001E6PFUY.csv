Our kids loved it and learned from it and now, so can the next generation.
From bouncing to the beat of the catchy tune to, being captivated by the brigth colors, this show's positive messages will reinforce what children are taught at home and in school.",1370822400,,331,4.533333333333333

8296810,5,B001E6PFUY,"I remember watching this show on the Disney channel when I was younger. This was one of my favorite shows. It always entertained me. It also taught good lessons.
As a child I always had this strange obsession with places that looked small on the outside but were quite large on the inside. I always loved the episodes where you can see into Gloria's room. She has this nice sized room under the umbrella tree.
The characters on the show are very lively and easy for a child to love. The puppets are cute and the voices are great. Each puppet has its own personality that comes through each episode. There are so many strange things on tv for kids today. These dvds is something I would show any child. They are adorable even to adults.
Another thing I realized watching this dvd is the colors. I was expecting very low quality since this show came out when I was born. But they must have redid it. The colors from the puppets are so vibrant. It looks almost like a brand new show. It might be the tv that I have, but I was very impressed with the quality of the dvd.",1298764800,,1066,4.282178217821782

8296812,5,B001E6PFUY,"This is a great Canadian show that I grew up watching on my parent's satellite dish in the 80's and early 90's.  Watching it now with my daughter, I still find it enjoyable and simple in a time when kids are constantly bombarded with loud and hyperactive cartoons.  It has five episodes on it, just a sampling from the first season, but it is enough to get a good idea of the show.  It's good for kids old enough to understand the dialouge; puppets are involved, but there is not a lot of singing and dancing to attract a toddler's attention.  It's an older show, so obviously not a sharp picture quality on high def televisions.  All in all a great buy, though.",1233532800,,662,4.349593495934959
