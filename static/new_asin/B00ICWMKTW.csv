8640886,5,B00ICWMKTW,This is one of the many films i liked.l But it is listed as a lost film since no good copies are available. I have a copy widescreen and it is watchable. The music by Elmer Bernstein is excellent That was  released on cd and that is complete. So where is a better copy may be somewhere in the 20th century fox vaults.,1392768000,3,317,4.031746031746032
