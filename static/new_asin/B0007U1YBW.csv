8051751,2,B0007U1YBW,"BOOOOOOOOOOOOOO.  I didn't like it . it may be good for people who are familiar or more advanced , but its not a learning tool for a beginner. What it shows is judo throws executed in  competition while a narrator describes whats happening between opponents, using Japaneese terminology which is OK if they give you list of what they're saying. But a newbie like myself found it a bit hard to follow some of the advanced throws and concepts out of the gate. If your familiar with the art, it might be helpful, if not, and your looking for introductory ideas, this is not the DVD for you.",1419379200,,587,4.425925925925926
