5361357,5,B009RNK0YC,"Cheyenne ""Fourth Season"" was O.K., but the stories in the other Three Seasons appeared to be better
written.  Clint Walker's acting was very good, but the acting parts for the other actors were marginal.
This is the only season that left me and my family somewhat disappointed in quality of story.
Thanks for listening!

I loved it the first time I watched it. The second time, I just sat back and enjoyed it for what it was, Good, Clean family entertainment .
Great acting from the entire cast,  wonderful story lines (the good guy always win)
The only thing wrong with this show : is those low down dirty varmints at warner bros. didn't make any more of them, than they did.",1425340800,,482,4.2967032967032965

5361402,5,B009RNK0YC,A gift purchase.  This was my favorite Western as I was growing up. It was enjoyable to watch the show again.  It made me want to saddle up and go for a horseback ride.,1393545600,,168,3.911764705882353

5361404,5,B009RNK0YC,"I was a western buff during my childhood years frequently going to the movie matinees. Cheyenne was one of my favourites. In my retiring years I wondered if I would ever see them again. What wonderful quality in both picture and sound with something filmed so long ago. Here in Australia we no longer see most of the old western series, so thank you Amazon, l look forward to receiving other series in due time.",1383523200,,411,4.493333333333333
5361405,5,B009RNK0YC,I always order these for my mom. She loves Clint Walker and the entire Cheyenne series. She watches them daily.,1380931200,,111,4.6
5361406,5,B009RNK0YC,"I like this series due to its being a western and starring Clint Walker.  The quality of the DVD was very good.

It arrived in a timely fashion.  Karen",1380672000,,151,4.137931034482759
5361407,5,B009RNK0YC,This is one of my favorite shows from when I was young.  This item came quickly and I'm very pleased with it.  It was packaged well and not damaged.  I would buy from this person again.,1380672000,,185,4.083333333333333
5361408,5,B009RNK0YC,I loved the Cheyenne TV show. It is another one of those that should have gone on and on. But....,1379721600,,97,3.9
5361409,5,B009RNK0YC,Clint Walker as always is brilliant as Cheyenne Bodie. One of the best TV westerns ever ! It's a pity it was not made in colour.,1378857600,,128,3.9615384615384617
5361410,3,B009RNK0YC,"As some others have noted, there must be zero manufacturing quality control on these Warner Archive made-on-demand (MOD) DVD-Rs.  I've ordered five seasons of this show, and several DVDs in each of seasons 2 through 5 were seriously scuffed - a far, far worse track record than any other sets of DVDs that I've ever purchased.  The only seasons *without* scratched DVDs was the first season, but those are proper pressed DVDs that evidently come from a different sort of manufacturing/packaging line than these crappy MOD DVD-Rs that Warner loves so much.  And, since I'm complaining, remember that MOD DVD-Rs will NOT play in anything but a standard DVD player hooked up to a TV.  In every way MOD DVDs are a very bad format which I avoid at all costs... after all, one can make their own MOD DVDs easily from TV broadcasts, and *those* discs will play in ALL of ones' various players.  The Cheyenne TV program itself is a classic, which is the only reason I put up with Warner's crap manufacturing and too-high prices.",1378425600,10,1020,4.707865168539326
5361411,5,B009RNK0YC,"They don't make shows like this anymore.  Clean, wholesome, and entertaining.  This show is a must have if you collect western shows from yesteryear.",1378166400,,149,5.166666666666667
5361412,5,B009RNK0YC,In season four and five Cheyenne takes some new directions by adding Bronco Lane and Sugarfoot to the mix.  This actually helps bring so variety and new life to the show.  Please keep publish all seven seasons of the outstanding and well-liked series.  Highly recommended.,1377993600,2,272,5.0
5361413,5,B009RNK0YC,"I had been waiting for a long time for this series to be produced, I'm seriously happy to have it",1376956800,,97,3.9
5361414,5,B009RNK0YC,we enjoy the old westerns and this was one of best  and still is.  We still enjoyed it.  Clint Walker is the best,1376092800,,113,3.8260869565217392
5361415,5,B009RNK0YC,This is a great set of DVD's. The episodes are very good and on the last disc you get an episode of Kung Fu:The Legend Continues featuring Clint Walker as Cheyenne Bodie.,1376006400,,170,4.34375
5361416,5,B009RNK0YC,"This season of the Cheyenne series is about like the others in the series.  The simple plots and good old values are refreshing.  My only complaint is that the sound doesn't seem to be equalized.  Sometimes the volume has to be all the way up to hear the dialog.  At other times, the volume has to be set to about 50%.",1375747200,,318,4.163934426229508
5361417,5,B009RNK0YC,"If you're a western fan like me, all these shows are great!! I can't wait to get season 6 an 7 an so on.",1375660800,,104,3.375
5361418,5,B009RNK0YC,I was so pleased to see that a very good remastering job has been done on Season 4 and so it is a pleasure to watch albeit in black and white - there are 13 episodes and a bonus on the 4th disc of a colour episode of Kung Fu: the Legend Continues titled Gunfighter which stars David Carradine and featuring an appearance by Clint Walker as Cheyenne Bodie - this is clearly some time after the Cheyenne series was filmed as the actors are considerably older - I have not watched all discs yet but only skipped quickly through each one to check they all play ok and to check on picture and sound quality and I am very pleased - highly recommended.,1375401600,3,645,4.209677419354839
5361419,5,B009RNK0YC,I grew up watching this show and enjoy it very much. I like clint walker as an actor and think he could have been the character in real life from his performance.,1371513600,,162,4.09375
5361420,5,B009RNK0YC,This had great stories along with great guest stasrs.  Definitely an adult western.  Definitely fun to watch.  Was of the adult western variety.,1366934400,,144,5.173913043478261
5361421,5,B009RNK0YC,I'm a big Clint Walker fan and especially in his role as Cheyenne Bodie.  These were by far my favorite westerns and were some of the first adult westerns in the genre of GUNSMOKE.  The biggest shortfall for these films is that they were shot in black and wihite and  3:4 aspect ratio.  Being a Clint Walker fan added that extra star and would probably rate lower for a non fan.,1365811200,4,378,4.28169014084507
5361422,5,B009RNK0YC,"Great series !! Always liked Clint Walker. Takes me back in time watching the black and white TV shows, enjoying the DVD's.",1365638400,,123,4.636363636363637
5361423,5,B009RNK0YC,THIS WAS GREAT TO WATCH!  GOOD ACTING & GREAT STORY WRITING. SHOWS HOW STRONG THE CHARACTER OF CHEYENNE BODIE WAS STRONG AND ALWAYS TRYING TO DO WHAT IS RIGHT.,1364947200,,159,4.482758620689655
5361424,5,B009RNK0YC,"Found this to be as great as the first 3 seasons, looking forward to season 5 coming out.  Enjoy Cheyenne very much, the stories are good and Clint Walker is great, as always.",1362873600,,175,4.303030303030303
5361425,5,B009RNK0YC,"After going on strike against Warner Brothers, Clint Walker returns in season four (now contracted for 15 episodes per season instead of 36). Every season from now till the end of the series lasted a mere 15 episodes per year, airing on a rotating basis with SUGARFOOT and BRONCO. Every episode is in gorgeous quality and are uncut and unedited. It is nice to see that Warners did not get careless with their DVD release by offering inferior prints. Packaging is great and keeps the discs protected.",1361145600,9,499,4.747126436781609

5361428,4,B009RNK0YC,"Cheyenne is a likeable hero and if he can solve an episode's problems without violence, he will do so.  There are still plenty of shots fired and fistfights but there is always an underlying theme of how to make the West a better place.  It is nice to see guest stars that went on to bigger and better things and to see those guests that you have seen time and time again in other shows.",1359244800,4,387,4.1466666666666665

5361437,5,B009RNK0YC,"Season four of Cheyenne what great show.  I have purchased the other three seasons of Cheyenne and as soon as I saw that season four was available I purchased the DVD. All baby-boomers whether they live in the USA or Australia know how good this show is, they do not need me to recommend it to them. As soon as they know it is available they will buyit.

While I have the opportunity I would ask Amazon to use their Market Power and ask Warner Brothers to release season 5,6, and 7 ot this great show. Also I would like to add my voice to, and join with everybody who has asked for Bronco, sugarfoot,Lawman and Lancer to be released; because it appears that if these show released at a reasonable price there are many people just waiting to purchase these products.
