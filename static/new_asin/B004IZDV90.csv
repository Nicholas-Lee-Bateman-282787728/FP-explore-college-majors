4389908,3,B004IZDV90,"I was really hoping that the movie would show stuff that we didn't see in the Airwolf Series But what was done was that the movie consisted of the very first two episodes of the series and it was distributed as a movie and of course the two main stars of the series are deceased and the story didn't continue years later as a possible revival of the original story years later in the future with some surviving stars or new cast members continuing the Airwolf Saga to present day. I was very happy to see Ernest Borgnine and Jan Michael Vincent and Alex Cord in the story but I wish it could have been updated to the present tense. It would have been more interesting to see how that would have  went. I still look forward to an updated version sometime in the future before I die, Please make that possible if you can",1488758400,,818,4.27741935483871

4389922,1,B004IZDV90,"Aside from the movie arriving over a month later after I ordered it, the picture quality was atrociously bad.  Almost low-end VHS quality.  The picture looked so faded out, it's embarrassingly incredulous that it was represented in a blu-ray format.  The DVD version of this movie was so much better, both in resolution and color.  There is nothing wrong with the movie itself, the movie was great, but the vessel that it was depicted on, really and truly sucks.  I would recommend not purchasing this movie from the same seller.  There seemed to be absolutely no attempt to enhanced the picture and sound quality to show it proudly in blu-ray, no remastering whatsoever.  I am deeply disappointed because I love this movie and was expecting to see it in an enhanced blu-ray HD quality.",1459814400,9,786,4.82089552238806

4389945,4,B004IZDV90,This is a fun film to watch . I must say that it has a political plot too it but what I must say if your into 80s TV shows this one is worth. If your a history buff you will like Airwolf because it has a Cold War Theme attached to it's storylines. Furthermore Airwolf was simply a cool show and this movie  will take you back in time. Ernest borgnine is as usual a standout and the staple of Airwolf and yes Jan Michael vincint simply rocked in this film ....scene when they stole the Airwolf now that was in simple terms Just Cool.,1412812800,3,532,4.018867924528302

4389949,4,B004IZDV90,"I loved the series when it was on the air, and I am reliving it again. I bought the entire 4 seasons, plus the original movie.
Used to watch the real Airwolf fly out of Van Nuys, Ca airport (VNY) when I was a pilot flying out of there myself.
I am now building a 5' long flying radio control model of this helicopter, made from a Bell 222. Great design, very stable
flight characteristics, both real, and model. I find that you get pretty attached to the crew, and the last season with a new cast
was not as good. Maybe if it ran longer than one season, but I doubt it.
Good video, I liked it, and as a series, it got even better.",1408492800,4,630,4.007936507936508

4389955,2,B004IZDV90,"Airwolf when it was first on TV was good, and this pilot comes close to emulating the original. Big problem for me was the fact that for the convenience of disk space, they did a lot of little clipping here and there. To the new to it, it won't be noticable, but for a fan who watched it regularly until they 'sharked' it by a major change of the storyline, you spot and remember the many small bits they chopped from it, and may find it unsatisfied as I did.",1403308800,6,459,4.111111111111111

has fallen into the hands of terrorists and you-know-what has hit
the fan. Pressure is on the intelligence agency that developed
the aircraft to recover it before the President calls in the
 military. It carries cutting edge, multi-functional technology
 now that will give our enemies much greater range and
effectiveness in air combat. Nine seconds after ignition
Airwolf can exceed Mach-1 from sea level to 65000 feet.
Jan-Michael Vincent is the agency pilot sent to bring it back.
A terrific movie. Absolutely terrific.

available on Amazon.com. I have the indoor model that

4389981,5,B004IZDV90,"The only thing missing from the DVD version is the last part of the Movie where StringFellow Hawk Plays the Chello for the Eagle as he remembers Gabrelle while out on the dock and it is rather moving.  Other than that it is an excellent recording.  And the interview with Ernest Borgnine is fun.  He was a great actor and will be sorely missed.  (I wrote this review 3 days prior to receiving the series)

As for the 12 or so minutes missing from the movie itself I found a cure for that.  The First Season DVD set has the Pilot for the series and everything that was missing from the Movie here is on that first disc.  So I got my music back at the end of the program I have always immensely enjoyed even at the age of about 12.  But now many years later I know I have a much greater appreciation for not only the music but the Series itself, the paintings, the scenery, the actors and actress's and all the work that went into making the series as enjoyable then as it is now.

The reproduction is very well done.  It plays well on both my Blue Ray player and my DVD player.  I could not be happier.  Everyone did a fantastic job on this and everyone should be congradulated and commended for all their hard work and efforts to bring back something so many of us enjoyed for a very long time.

4389984,2,B004IZDV90,"Airwolf The Movie was a really good movie right up until the very beginning of the film where they Blasphemed God's name over and over.
This added absolutely nothing to the film as did the sexual vulgarity. Taking intimacy down to the ""Barnyard Gutter"" isn't a good written script nor good acting. Unfortunately European society and the American one following close behind have become or are becoming desensitized to bad behavior, bad life styles and bad language. Character matters here. The special effects were very good, unfortunately it was ruined with totally unnecessary negative attitudes and bad language that are either are to suppose to impress us or try to get us following the same bad examples.

4389987,3,B004IZDV90,"I just watched this version of the TV Pilot.  Ok, besides the few sprinkled f-bombs, I did not see anything to cause me to say ""Hey... ""I've never seen that"".  It also says ""remastered""... from what? 16mm film? The video is still grainy, but considering when this was made, I won't hold it against them, but it sure doesn't look ""cleaned up"" or remastered from the master film. As to the ending, I could swear in the TV pilot they showed the ""lair"" where they keep Airwolf.  In this new version it just flies back over the ocean towards home.  If you already have the TV Pilot as part of Season 1, I don't see the need to add this to your collection.",1315612800,24,650,4.260162601626016
4389988,2,B004IZDV90,"My opinion?...

Video quality - good.  Hey, they wern't thinking of Lucas film quality shooting when this was made.  I think they cleaned up the film footage well.

Audio quality - good.  Same thoughts as above.

Foul language:  I don't mind a 'colorful metaphor' used to enhance the emotional moment.  But, for this movie version, whoever was in charge of dubbing in to the ORIGINAL spoken script all the @!%# in to this sacred, classic, television pilot......that production manager has not matured much past a 16 year old.  Whay take the 'uncut version', and dirty it up by adding poorly chosen, cheap cuss words?

Speaking of the 'uncut version' - they CUT a couple of good scenes OUT from the television version that we reference from in editing this movie.  The first flight in Santini's chopper to the lair..Hawk being short with Gabrielle on that she had not seen the original painting in the art gallery(hint of Hawk's inherited wealth)..and, worse, the ENTIRE last part of the show that put together what the series was going to be about (Hawk and Arcangel's meeting at the cabin after Hawk recovered Airwolf). Making the movie with a strategy to cut out the hints of what the future relationship between Hawk and Arcangel would be..that left too big a gap. Some added scenes helped...there's a scene that proves Moffett was a pistol marksman, and, could have hit the refueling hole.  But, the missing scenes seem to have taken much more away than what the original cut scenes added.

My bottom line review.....thumbs down to this version.  Watch the original on Hulu for free.",1315440000,4,1587,4.82962962962963
4389989,5,B004IZDV90,"As this DVD was first released in early 2011 in the UK (Region 2) only as a market tester (along with a short-lived Blu-ray release), for the completists this updated version includes a brand new pure-Airwolf interview of Ernie Borgnine (thus the addition of him as ""Santini' that's been added to the original Region 2 artwork) that was shot in L.A. during May 2011.

I'm sure there'll be many Brits who have a multi-region DVD player who'll buy a second copy (I've pre-ordered) just to see this new interview alone, and probably matched by others who'd wished it had been on the Region 2 release first time around who'll buy it again anyway.

The Region 2 quality was not as good as Universal-Playback's original release of the full-length Pilot episode for the 1st Season Box Set HOWEVER this was due to this European ""Movie"" print only currently existing as a DigiBeta print and Fabulous were forced to use that.

It's nice to have anyway for certain music cues that were different, plus the alternative, self-contained edit that made no references to the future TV series at all.",1314921600,,1083,4.780748663101604

Starring Jan-Michael Vincent, Ernest Borgnine and Alex Cord

All-New Interview w/Academy Award-winner Ernest Borgnine and more!

FOR THE FIRST TIME EVER, THIS FEATURE-LENGTH MOVIE WILL FINALLY BE MADE AVAILABLE TO NORTH AMERICAN VIEWERS

I know what you are saying. ""Isn't this already out?"" Yes, the TV movie that kicked off the series was released on the season 1 set back in 2005, but that's not exactly what this release is. The Shout! Factory press release didn't explain exactly what it was that's coming on September 6, so I'll clarify it for you.

Airwolf: The Movie was originally released in the United Kingdom as a standalone TV movie, not as a pilot for a series. Their cut of the movie featured scenes that were moved around, or removed, as well as some uncensored material that wasn't seen in the US (the cut is rated ""18"" in the UK), and scenes from ""Mad Over Miami"" added to it. It's this version that Shout! Factory and Fabulous Films is releasing, and why the press release mentioned it'll be on DVD ""for the first time in the U.S. and Canada.

Fans wanting an absolutely complete set of Airwolf should know that this isn't something that's duplicated on the season 1 set. I strongly recommend it if you like Airwolf. You won't be disappointed.",1308441600,58,1348,4.843478260869565
