4859712,1,B005QPFSLA,"El Paso was a Paramount western from 1949, really a B western, but spruced up with Cinecolor (cheaper than Technicolor), several exciting chase sequences, and a climactic shoot-out in a dust storm, so that it could pass for an A film.  No better or worse than many of the westerns made during the 40s, apparently the copyright has expired on this, because this DVD is made by an unknown company, and the quality is deplorable.  It has been photographed off a TV screen, as evidenced by a band of distortion at the bottom of the image through most of the film.  So you have fuzzy focus, washed-out color, and poor sound.  I managed to stick with this through the entire film, but now the DVD is headed for the trash bin.  Let's hope Warner Archive resurrects this  movie, in a restored version it would be a worthwhile addition to all the 40s B westerns that are being reissued these days.  John Payne and Gail Russell play the leads, along with Sterling Hayden as the bad guy.  Plus George ""Gabby"" Hayes playing the same role he played in every western he was in.",1403395200,8,1063,4.5

4859714,5,B005QPFSLA,"I can't believe that I never saw this one, to my recollection. It is a great yarn, the bad guys are really bad, and the good guys struggle with their identity a bit, which makes it interesting. Sure there are some moments when the plot leaves you a wee bit incredulous, but it's a great movie, as good as some of the John Wayne classics. Of course, I would give his best movies 6 stars if I could........",1398816000,,404,4.1923076923076925
4859715,4,B005QPFSLA,"Finally a watchable print of this 1949 western. Glad to have it back as it brings back memories. Infinitely better than the dreadful ""Loving the Classics"" version that I bought. John Payne was a credible actor and the cast includes the beautiful, tragic Gail Russell and the old Western stalwarts Gabby Hayes and Henry Hull. The plot does not hold up as the hero participates in lynching the bad guys, of course they deserve it, while literally walking into a bright future with the heroine. If Amazon makes it available for purchase, I would buy it to add to my collection.",1398643200,,574,4.693069306930693
4859716,3,B005QPFSLA,"When Paramount made a Western in the late 1940s and early 1950s, it was rare, but worth waiting for.  All Westerns were in brilliant color and were fast-moving, crowd-pleasers for the time.  The print and the usually washed-out colors produced by the Cine Color process used here looks particularly good on the print in the Amazon video library.  It's still an enjoyable Western today.  The cast consists of John Payne, Sterling Hayden, Gail Russell, Gabby Hayes and a reliable group of supporting actors.  2-1/2 Stars on a my usual 4 Star rating system equates to the 3 Stars of 5 Stars rating I assigned to this Paramount Western.",1396569600,,632,4.814814814814815
4859717,4,B005QPFSLA,It was a true old western; which I like. John Payne one of my favorites. Well worth watching. I like that old westerns are in the mix.,1393632000,,134,4.0
4859718,2,B005QPFSLA,"When I yell at the screen, ""What, are you an idiot? What are you doing THAT for?"" more than three times in a movie at the lead characters, it's a movie I could have skipped and will never watch again. John Payne plays a good guy (lawyer), turned into a bad guy, a good guy again, a bad guy again . . . He's got a 13-year-old riding next to him at the head of a vigilante mob. And he keeps getting innocent people killed by believing some of the most demonstrably evil characters in the west -- led by a land-grabber and a corrupt sheriff played by, respectively, Sterling Hayden and Dick Foran -- are suddenly going to be kind to good folks.
The storytelling is also way too drawn-out -- and I can't stand gun fights where I can't figure out which side is shooting at which. Someone had the bright idea to shoot it in a dust storm. I didn't even notice the bad guy getting killed. People were just running from shots and falling down a lot in dust.",1376179200,6,948,4.185792349726776

4859724,5,B005QPFSLA,It has a positive message,1456704000,,25,4.2
4859725,3,B005QPFSLA,"Nothing special to write home about. Standard story of good versus bad with Sterling Hayden being the heavy this time, usually he is the good guy. The story is typical 1950's early 1960's lore about a peace loving guy who is forced to wear a gun to fight for freedom and court justice. I am fond of Westerns but would not care to recommend this one. R",1455926400,,351,4.253731343283582

4859745,2,B005QPFSLA,"I am willing to suspend some belief for a good plot.  This is very poor fair.  Too many personality swings
(in all senses, including hangings) and amazingly predictable!  Set in 1865 the holsters were filled with
1873 Peacemakers and 1875 Remingtons - not to mention 1871 Springfields! Funny that during the
gunfight climax one shooter had a lot of trouble with his trapdoor!  Best plot point was a heroic and
non stereotyped Mexican!",1434240000,,434,4.904109589041096

4859748,5,B005QPFSLA,"I am giving this release five stars based on the fact that, at the moment, this is the only DVD of EL PASO that I know to be available, and because the film has always been a favorite of mine since I saw it many years ago on an old black & white television set. As some other reviewers have rightly pointed out, the picture quality leaves something to be desired: this early Pine-Thomas production was filmed in Cinecolor, a cheaper and less stable cousin to Technicolor. The print used for this issue is a bit washed out, as many Cinecolor prints are now. Still, it is entirely watchable and enjoyable. And the so-so quality of this issue is more than compensated for by a stellar cast and pretty much non-stop action. In addition to the unheralded John Payne, who made an excellent Western actor (just think of his superb roles in SILVER LODE or TENNESSEE'S PARTNER), you have ""Gabby"" Hayes who always brings his inimitable brand of corny humor to every picture he made. Then, there is the gravely-voiced Henry Hull, another superb character actor who never really turned in a bad performance. Additionally, there is Sterling Hayden (long before his DR. STRANGELOVE fame as General Ripper!), the veteran Dick Foran, Arthur Space, Lee ""Lasses"" White, and even a youngish Denver Pyle. And, not to forget, Gail Russell.  In other words, the cast is quite strong and the acting quite respectable.

EL PASO, from the beginning, is filled with non-stop action and derring-do. And Payne (who should be better known than just for his role in MIRACLE ON 34TH STREET) calmly fills the bill, first as the Eastern lawyer, then taking up arms with returned Confederates to secure justice.

A few years back EL PASO showed up on, I think, TNT; and it may have been shown on Encore Westerns. The print then was fairly decent; so good prints do exist. I don't know who has a good print these days, but let us hope that perhaps Warner Archive (or maybe an enterprising company like Olive or Shout! Factory) will pick it up and issue it as it should be.

In the meantime, if you are like me and like this film as I do, and can deal with a somewhat washed out color print, I can recommend this issue. The film is a classic oater, and certainly worth it.",1430438400,3,2236,4.56857855361596
