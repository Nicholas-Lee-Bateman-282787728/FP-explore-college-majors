7877169,5,6304794525,"This is a very well researched and analyzed documentary focusing primarily on the history of Anti-Semitism; the problems that the Jews have been facing right from the crucifixion of Christ, to the holocaust, and even today in the context of the present Middle-East problems between Israel and Palestine. I would highly recommend this documentary to anyone who may want to have an in-depth study of the history of Anti-Semitism.",1123718400,6,427,5.202898550724638
