4982,5,0767025385,"There are so many wonderful stories of immigrants who struggled and overcame poverty to achieve greatness in some field.  Irving Berlin's life experience is eloquently captured in this excellent biography.  The Russian Jewish boy who left his impoverished Lower East Side New York family to avoid being a burden and became one of the greatest American composers of popular songs, songs like ""Alexander's Ragtime Band,"" ""Easter Parade,"" ""White Christmas,"" and ""God Bless America,"" is the subject of a most inspiring story....There is only one minor correction I would make: the box of the A&E DVD says the running time is ""approx. 100 mins.,"" when in fact the program runs about 87 minutes.",1141862400,15,689,5.142857142857143
4983,5,0767025385,"Comprehensive and interesting bio of America's Songwriter, especially to those interested in standard popular music, the style of which is generally no longer being produced, written or appreciated. As good as some of today's music is, can most people really easily hum or whistle any of the score of a ""Phantom"" or ""Les Mis?""",1125964800,7,326,5.055555555555555
4984,5,0767025385,An excellent video!  It follows you from Russia to the streets of New York to Broadway to Hollywood telling you of the genius of this Song Writer of the Ages. It's 100 minutes of entertaining education!,1122422400,8,202,4.611111111111111
4985,4,0767025385,"I agree, Irving Berlin was a brilliant songwriter, and A&E always does a nice job with their biographies. But he didn't write ""Yankee Doodle Dandy,"" as is written in another review- that was George M Cohan. For a wonderul portrayal of George M, get the movie ""Yankee Doodle Dandy"" starring Jimmy Cagney- and you thought he just did gangster movies...",1045008000,12,350,4.85

7788650,5,0767025385,"Showed this DVD at a church social gathering and everyone raved about it.  A fascinating, detailed documentary about a musical genius and mensch.",1457395200,,145,5.304347826086956

7788652,5,0767025385,"Great episode of Biography.  How I miss this series - a TRUE reality series about, well, REALITY.  How A&E and History have sadly changed. Regarding the documentary itself, the story of Irving Berlin is very much the story of 20th century American music--and American history--itself.  A must see.",1428451200,,297,5.145833333333333
7788653,5,0767025385,"Show this at an assisted living, and our residents love it!",1413331200,,59,4.454545454545454
7788654,5,0767025385,"Wonderful dvd, but WHY IS IT SO EXPENSIVE?  Almost $40 is crazy.  Please bring down the price , and you will sell a lot of copies.",1406246400,,130,3.9615384615384617
7788655,5,0767025385,"Irving Berlin is generally recognised as America's greatest ever songwriter and this superb documentary interviews family and friends as well as having a generous helping of excerpts from film and stage productions.  No doubt ir has been shown on the box but anyone who wishes to know more on the life and times of this extraordinary man and musician shouldn't hesitate.

It seems strange that while we have some interesting Hollywood biopics on many of the great 20th century Broadway writers as far as I can ascertain nothing has been made on Irving Berlin, although he does appear as a link character in several of such films.  In the meantime this is about as good as it gets.",1358985600,,680,4.745762711864407
7788656,5,0767025385,This man was such a genious.  Couldn't even speak English when he came to this country and didn't even gradute from H.S.  His talent is amazing and his love for this country mega more than most natural born citizens.  Love this biography - check it out if for no other reason than it is totally inspiring!!,1302998400,,306,4.428571428571429
7788657,5,0767025385,"Everything you could possibly want to know about a true genius is contained in this remarkable video, which traces his entire life from his poverty-stricken beginnings to the master of American music, equaled possibly only by that of George M. Cohan. Berlin's life is an inspiration and a story of self-improvement that is unsurpassed.",1293926400,,335,5.222222222222222
7788658,5,0767025385,"I watched this DVD and wished it would never end, respective not as soon as it did. It's a very well-made biography about a very interesting, very smart, very gifted, very straight and non-boring man - Irving Berlin - and his  social environment. I dearly regret not ever have had the opportunity to met him in person.",1183075200,4,318,4.578947368421052
