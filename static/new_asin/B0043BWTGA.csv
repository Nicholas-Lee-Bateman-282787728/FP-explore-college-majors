8414559,4,B0043BWTGA,"A fun and informative series for adults and children alike.  This collection (despite being DVD) would make a great gift for any aircraft/fighter enthusiast who hasn't seen the series.  The narration (and series itself) is over a decade old at this point, however, it possesses good production quality and fascinating information without feeling tacky or tawdry.",1423267200,,362,5.446428571428571
