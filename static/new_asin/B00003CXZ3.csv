1321776,2,B00003CXZ3,"The screenwriter came up with a clever idea, but couldn't figure out what to do with it.  The movie raises questions and builds tension and then ends suddenly without resolving them.  The ending was a huge letdown.  Lots of writers can dream up challenging puzzles; only the really good ones know how to resolve them.",995155200,3,317,4.7272727272727275
1321777,5,B00003CXZ3,"Memento is like nothing you have ever seen.  That much I can garantee you.  Guy Pierce suffers from a specialized form of amnesia where he no longer can make short term memories.  His long term memory is intact right up to the incident which caused his condition...and his wife's death.  Thus our swiss-cheese brained hero is seeking revenge for his wife, while his memory is wiped clean every ten minutes or so.  Covered in tatoo's, pocket's full of polaroids with notes scribbled on them (such as a picture of what his car looks like, aptly labeled ""Your Car"") Pierce has to try and find the man responsible for the way his life is now while mixing with a great assorment of characters with no idea of how he met any of them or who he can trust.  This is easily the best movie I saw this year and I highly recommend it.",994550400,5,821,4.368421052631579
1321778,5,B00003CXZ3,"Next to Die Hard and Brazil this is my favorite movie of all time. I have seen it 3 times in the theaters. It is so original and so filled with great ideas and plot twists, ...I have never rubbed my head or been absorbed in deep thought so many times within a single movie. Advice: Don't see this movie while out of school, your brain will hurt from thinking so much.",994204800,,367,4.111111111111111
1321779,5,B00003CXZ3,"I have an extremely hard time picking my ""favorite"" movie ever, because I keep changing my mind, but Memento has a very legitimate shot at getting the number one spot forever.
An un-original story told in an innovative and original way with extraordinary acting (Guy Pearce and Joey Pants both deserve Oscars), and the best ending since The Usual Suspects (okay, maybe The Sixth Sense too).  The end of the movie makes you really want to go back and see the whole thing over again.
Honestly, I don't know what to say because the movie was so good.  I went with high expectations of seeing something that wasn't retreaded Hollywood garbage, that was an exciting thriller with a real story, good action without overdone special effects and with real acting.  I was not disappointed.
I swear, if this movie doesn't win an Oscar in every eligible category, something is amiss.",994032000,,872,4.8
1321780,5,B00003CXZ3,"Ever tried UN-scrambling eggs? Ever get a 10,000 piece jigsaw puzzle of the seas and the cloudless skies for Christmas? Well, this is how you'll feel with ""Memento"". This fascinating flick, destined to rack up the Academy Awards,is an example of one of the most original methods of filming & editing. Based on 10 minute segments going BACKWARDS, this movie unfolds into a terrific thriller! Leonard (Guy Pearce) is out to seek revenge on the person who raped & killed his wife and left him without short term memory. Teddy (Joe Pantoliano) is his ""buddy(?)"" cop(?)! BOTH deserve awards for their performances! The ending is fascinating but I can only say one more thing: Rent it, buy it, whatever...just SEE it. Not for the simple minded or Van Damme fans (Ha!)",994032000,,761,4.816793893129771
1321886,5,B00003CXZ3,"What an unusual movie.  Special effects at the beginning running the film backwards lets you know you will be seeing the movie in rewind mode.  Imagine you have to cope with short term memory loss, that what you experienced will be gone in the next few minutes.  Leonard has to take quick notes and snapshots to remember and give him a reference for what and why things are happening in the present.  If he wakes up next to a strange woman in bed and doesn't remember her he has to ask or find a clue as to how she got there.  He is vulnerable to not-so-nice people.  He can remember his life before the hit to the head but will forget everything that takes place afterwards in a matter of minutes.  When things and clues are really important he has them inked in his skin.  It is the quest to find a killer that keeps him going.  And we are put in his position of looking back at all the clues to see why things are turning out as they do.",1518220800,,940,4.149171270718232

1321895,4,B00003CXZ3,"Memento is intense, entertaining, and confusing. The color scenes, run in reverse order, were longer than the B&W scenes run in chronological order. We know the ending because it is the beginning and we don't know what really happened (I emphasize the past tense) until we get to the beginning which occurs at the end except for the B&W segments, which end in the middle.
I think one aspect that draws so many positive reviews to this film is that it is not structured in the orthodox manner of filmmaking. The viewer must deconstruct each scene from the following scene in the previous segment of time. The newness of this structure makes one think, perhaps even somewhat mathematically. It is revolutionary and worked as, I presume, a first time method but I think it would become tiresome if done again, at least, to anyone who has experienced it in Memento even if they liked it. I liked the film but I won't be saving it to watch again. I think it will lose its magnetism the second time around.
I was reminded of putting all the scenes on the board and then mixing them up but with two plans of order at the same time.",1513209600,2,1124,4.487804878048781

1322388,5,B00003CXZ3,"Was introduced to Nolan when I watched this film; from then on have been ""following"" his work without regret. Very original storyline and editing job entices the viewer to watch the film at least 3 times. In addition, the style of this film actually forces the viewer to sympathize with the mental condition of the protagonist. Once I figured out that the B/W frames were shown in sequence and the color scenes in reverse (or was it the other way round?), the film became even more watchable.

So now after 12-13 viewings over the years, finally concluding that either ""Teddy"" was right, and/or possibly ""Lenny"" had invented the entire narrative to forcibly block out his repressed guilt, my short term memory is now shot to hell

1322539,1,B00003CXZ3,"I'm sorry. I hated this film. I found it confusing, frustrating and infuriating. It is about a man with no ability to retain short-term memories, trying to find the killer of his wife. Defending her, he suffered a clubbing, causing his amnesia problem. Two sets of sequences, one in black and white and the other in color take you forward or backward to incidents that occurred soon after his amnesia vs. those occurring at the current time. These alternating before-or-after flashbacks were confusing and irritating. Other reviewers rave about this film, complaining only about the ""limited edition"" DVD as opposed to the other version. Not me. I watched the film as part of a cinema class, and was intrigued for about ten minutes. After those first ten minutes, I found the film agonizing. It seemed to last forever. When it finally ended, inconclusively, I bolted from the classroom with a great feeling of relief and deliverance. Maybe you will enjoy it. ""Memento"" obviously has many enthusiastic fans, but for me, the movie was a painful ordeal to be endured for much too long.",1457049600,,1082,4.918032786885246

I liked the way the film pulled you along into the story by the interjection of past, present and future between the black & white scenes and the color scenes. Just when you think you know what is going on you find out that it you were wrong - Natalie is a user, Dodd and Jimmie are creeps, Teddy may or may not be the killer. At the end, the viewer is still not sure what is real, and what is the misinterpretation of reality.",1456876800,2,600,4.366071428571429

1322941,4,B00003CXZ3,"The thing to remember about Christopher Nolan movies like ""Inception"" and ""Memento"" is that the psychologistic trappings are there to serve ends that are very familiarly associated with recognizable movie genres.  ""Inception"" is a caper movie; ""Memento"" is a ""noir"" -- a designation that Nolan himself acknowledges in one of the Special Features interviews that comes with this movie.  In other words, don't expect to learn anything of interest about the mind -- just sit back and enjoy the clever ways in which Nolan has put a new spin on the old forms.  In particular, you can savor the ingenuities of plotting that the more psychologistic focus requires.  Where these are concerned, Nolan doesn't put a foot wrong, and his feeling for visual styles (and sometimes tricks) that both interest us and orient us to the world of the movie is arresting and highly inventive.  In the case of ""Memento,"" (without giving too much away), you have two stories running -- one ""backwards"" in time (and in color) and the other in ""forward"" chronology, in grainy black-and-white.  The assumption of the movie is that the protagonist, Leonard Shelby (Guy Pearce) has, as a result of trauma associated with his wife's murder, lost the ability to retain memories.  He can remember things from before the trauma, but he has lost the power to make new memories -- and that makes it difficult (!) for him to try to discover her killer.  Things stay in his mind for only a very short time, and in order to try to fix these memories, he uses notes and a Polaroid camera

Noir movies are about trust, or, rather, the lack of it or uncertainty about it.  Memory problems like Leonard's exacerbate problems of trust -- trust, after, all is difficult enough, but when you can't remember what you did two hours ago and can't remember the people you have just been talking to or sleeping with, then is trust even possible, and is getting at the truth even possible?  Obviously, a person in Leonard's condition is highly vulnerable to manipulation and to being misled, especially when there's no way of hiding from people the fact that one has this odd memory disability -- and can a person in Leonard's position even trust himself?  And can we, as audience, trust him, one of the oddest centers of consciousness in any movie?  It's fascinating and disturbing, as all good noirs should be, and Guy Pearce does a wonderful job as Leonard.  He is an actor of uncommon versatility, and he inhabits the odd characters he plays with what seems like effortlessness -- think of ""A Slipping Down Life"" or ""Priscilla, Queen of the Desert,"" or the Australian ""Jack Irish"" detective series.  Joe Pantaleoni and Carrie-Anne Moss do excellent work in support, and the whole thing is both engaging and creepy.  Well worth seeing.",1437350400,,2788,4.813417190775682

1323050,5,B00003CXZ3,"Memento is an uncommon movie in todays world of super heroes and big budget blockbusters. A film that is very well written, has great dialogue and character development, and is quite original. Christopher Nolan, who has shown that he is a master storyteller, directs it impeccably.
Memento is definitely a thriller with a central mystery, the hunt for John G, the man who killed Leonards wife. Leonards problem is that he cant make new memories, as he puts it, I can't make new memories. Everything fades, nothing sticks.. This is quite the problem for Leonard. The fun part for the viewer is that the story is told in reverse through the eyes of Leonard, which means the viewer experiences it basically the same way he does. The viewer shares his handicap in a sense. This specific style is really cool; however, I did find myself rewinding and watching scenes again to make sure I didn't miss anything.
The supporting characters, Natalie and teddy, are well developed also. They are well rounded which I really liked. There is a lot of ambiguity to them; they aren't black and white, they definitely fall into a grey area, as we all do. I like that in a movie because it makes it easier to relate to. They also have great dialogue, which makes a movie much better. A perfect example of this is when Natalie says, Is that what your little note says? It must be hard living your life off a couple of scraps of paper. You mix your laundry list with your grocery list you'll end up eating your underwear for breakfast.. This quote shows that there is a little humor mixed in with what is essentially a dark film
The plot is told in reverse in fifteen-minute increments, which is really innovative and. The fact that is told in reverse is one of my favorite things about the movie; it really keeps you on your toes and is very engaging. As with most Christopher Nolan films there is a lot of ambiguity, which is cool because you get to decide for yourself whether or not you agree with the characters and their actions.

I became lost unfortunately even in his valiant effort to explain because it was detailed beyond belief.  What i did take from it and even then I am not sure yes/no if he meant he was or was not Sammy but it seems possibly like in The Machinist he was so disturbed that he had to detach from himself and create another person who killed their wife thought insulin with loss of short term memory when it was actually him.

1323273,5,B00003CXZ3,"Christopher Nolan is one of the most creative directors in Hollywood. His movie,Memento proves it. It is a great movie that is presented in non- traditional way that would make the viewer appreciate it even more as compared to other great films.

Memento is a psychological thriller film written and directed by Nolan,who adapted from his younger brother Jonathan's short story entitled,Memento Mori. It stars Guy Pearce as Leonard Shelby, a man with anterograde amnesia,which impairs his ability to store new explicit memories. During the opening credits, which portray the end of the story, it is shown that Leonard kills Teddy,played by Joe Pantoliano. The film suggests that this killing is vengeance for the rape and murder of his wife based on information provided by Natalie,played by Carrie- Anne Moss.

This film is often used to show the distinction between plot and story. Its events unfold in two separate, alternating narratives  one in color, and the other in black-and-white. The black-and-white sections are told in chronological order, showing Leonard conversing with an anonymous phone caller in a motel room. Leonard's investigation is depicted in color sequences that are in reverse chronological order. As each sequence begins, the audience is unaware of the preceding events, just like Leonard, thereby giving the viewer a sense of his confusion. By the film's end when the two narratives converge we understand the investigation and the events that lead up to Teddy's death.

Memento is not only a film that would give the audience great entertainment but it is also provides them a one of a kind movie experience. Aside from having the plot and the story told in a non- traditional manner whether it is colored/black and white or chronological/reverse-chronological,it involves the viewer into solving the puzzles and mysteries of a crime thriller. Although some may not appreciate the way the story was told as people may not get right way the fashion on how the plot and the story is being told,it nevertheless puts the viewer into the inner workings of the mind as well as the character of Leonard as well as emotions depicted in the movie. That is why it definitely provides the viewer an absorbing experience although it may create confusion to some.",1419552000,,2279,5.101876675603217

1323458,3,B00003CXZ3,"""Prisoner of Consciousness"" is a documentary about Clive Wearing, a music scholar who contracted a case of encephalitis that rendered him incapable of retaining memories more than a few seconds at a time. A supremely intelligent and sensitive man, he remembers everything up to the point he became ill, but now exists in a perpetual and bewildering ""now."" He fills notebooks endlessly with the phrase ""Now I am finally awake,"" and even though he sees where he has already written the same thing, he has no memory of doing so. His impression of his condition is of having suddenly awakened from a coma - at every moment. Yet he is able to play a piece of music from start to finish with no trouble, because each moment of the music flows seamlessly into the next. He has a touching relationship with his wife - if she is out of his sight for even a few moments, when he sees her again, he reacts as joyfully as if their meeting was a reunion after a long absence.

Wearing's plight as presented in the film forces us to confront what it means to be human - whether we are the sum total of our memories, or if there is some essence which transcends this. ""Memento"" is a thriller based on this interesting and compelling condition, with the scenes in reverse order, so the audience does not ""remember"" what happened any more than the main character, who suffers from a milder form of Wearing's condition, does. ""Prisoner of Consciousness,"" if you can find it, is a far superior and ultimately more moving film.",1403308800,2,1507,4.5814814814814815

1323556,4,B00003CXZ3,"Memento's a heavy-handed theory movie that's not nearly as pretentious as 'The Matrix'. The theory? Derrida. Derrida's endless inscriptions, the endlessness of writing, figurative and literal, that permits no signification, no meaning, only perpetual reference. That's the meaning of Pearce's tattoos.

I sense there may be a deeper feminist angle in the film, if not because of the existence of Derrida alone, though if it exists then it isn't worth the trouble of excavating and presenting 'spoon in mouth' to a mesmerized audience. Me? I wake up every day with my coffee and open the internet hoping to find out in the news that our liberal world has literally ended, so it goes without saying that I wish the most miserable death on all feminists.

Detecting liberal social-engineering both in and outside of entertainment is an instinctual skill of mine, it now runs on a subconscious motor, so I can't help myself. That's why my parents paid LSU 30,000 dollars, it seems. Again, I detect feminism but, again, mainly because of Derrida. Then again Moss's character is also peculiarly devious and then there is the marriage story, but what the heck. This may be a termite infested limb, but I suspect that Derrida was just used as a framework for pure entertainment and in this respect the film works very well.",1396483200,3,1315,4.9457013574660635

1323559,5,B00003CXZ3,"This movie came out before Christopher Nolan was a household name.  It was a relatively low budget film that is part revenge story, part drama, part dark comedy and part love story.  The basic plot is that a man is looking for his wife's killer, but because of a head injury he cannot make new short term memories.  He remembers everything up to his accident, but becomes a blank slate every few minutes.  As a result he takes Polaroids of the people he interacts with, writes notes to himself and tattoos clues onto his body.  The twist is that the movie is shown in reverse.  You get a scene, then it will roll back about 5 min or so, and show the events leading up to what you just watched.  And keeps doing that throughout the entire movie.

While the writing and directing are great, the key to the movie being as good as it is was the acting.  Guy Pearce as the main character, Lenny/Leonard does a great job both when he is narrating the rules for his life, and when he is onscreen.  Joe Pantoliano and Carrie-Anne Moss both having come off making the original Matrix film when this came out are great playing characters that are much more than they seem.  What you find out by the end/beginning of the movie is that all the characters are pretty morally gray.

As far as extras go there on the blu ray there are about 25 min worth of behind the scenes material.  Commentary on the film from Nolan, a copy of the script, a gallery showing the various clues tattooed on Leonard and his diary.  Not a ton of material but good for what it there.

Most likely anyone reading this by now will have already seen the movie, but it not it is definitely worth checking out.  It is much more like Inception than it is the Dark Knight movies, but to the extent you can say Nolan has a style, it definitely follows it.  It is not a movie you can have on in the background and get what is going on.  You really do have to pay attention all the way through or you will miss too much.",1395100800,,1976,4.2520107238605895

You see his fantastic idea of playing a film in reverse, but with enough fiddling with this honestly fun (yet annoying at times) menu we are show the film in chronological order, does it matter?  If you're a dvd extras junkie then it matters so very much, does it change the film?  The film is set to be a mystery, seeing it in order removes the intrigue, which I personally keeps the film hinged, but it still makes for a fun re-experience.

At least it was until I watched it for a second time about a year ago. Now, the title is as firmly planted in my melon as the visceral reaction I had whenever I was reminded of it in the years following the original viewing.

It is probably the only film on my top 10 list that I had trouble remembering the name of, that has no quotable quotes, that elicits no awe for its cinematic tricks or poignant portrayals delivered by the cast. It just plain wowed the bejeezus out of me. It has the rare quality of not only not tripping over clunky plot devices that defy likelihood and human nature, it rises to the level of ""Man, I just never would have conceived of, let alone executed this vision"".

I had no idea who Chris Nolan was in 2000, nor did I care. Guy Pearce was just another imported face. The reason I went to Memento in the first place was Joe Pantoliano because I liked his shtick in Eddie and The Cruisers. Funny, Eddie and The Cruisers begat my exposure to Memento.

The structure of the film is brilliant--since it opens with the ""final"" scene, we, like the main character, have no memories by which to judge what is truly happening.  As the movie progresses backwards chronologically our lack of knowledge of prior events can lead to misinterpretation of situations.  Only when prior scenes are revealed are we able to understand the motives and actions of the characters.  Great acting, intelligent premise.

1323847,4,B00003CXZ3,"Memento is an incredible movie about a guy who has no short-term memory. The film plays in reverse as Leonard Shelby (Guy Pearce) tries to remember who he is and how he can avenge his wife's death.

The packaging and format of the 2-disc DVD version is unusual to say the least. The movie options on the disc are probably the most complicated I have ever seen. Basically you are shown a screen full of psychological tests before you can play the movie or access the bonus content. It is fun but I still need the guide sitting next to me if I want to do anything except play the main feature. I must admit it does fit the theme of the film quite well and it's definitely original. There is also an easter egg that allows you to watch the film in chronological order. All the extra features on the DVD are ported to the single disc Blu-ray except ""Mindbenders and Challenges Designed by Nolan to Unlock Hidden Disc Features"" that has some easter eggs such as the chronological view.

Special Feature:
* ""Remembering Memento"" - a 10-year anniversary look back on the making of the film
* IFC Interview with Writer/Director Christopher Nolan
* Audio Commentary with Director Christopher Nolan
* ""Anatomy of a Scene"" Sundance Channel Documentary
* ""Memento Mori"" - Short Story by Jonathan Nolan
* Feature Script, * Tattoo Gallery, * Leonard's Journal

On IMDB the discussions draw no conclusion.  No one can be certain for sure what happened or if anything happened.

I recognize that to those raised on the Waiting for Godot style, these  may not be issues. They were for me. By me, so to speak, this is an art-house, off-off-off Broadway, Dadaist, University  experimental film.

This movie is a very ""on the edge"" thriller. Its probably best not to descibe this film as a thriller but the plot has us guessing and trying to find a solution to a complex puzzle.
In actuality the movie questions perception and what is memory
. For example: I look at a pencil and before I pick it up I know what it should feel like .Its weight and texture . How do I know this ?
From previous experiences. My memory of seeing , touching and using a similar item. The film shows us this could be a mistake. This pencil could be filled with metal or I only think I have picked up a pencil before in my life.
Now this film is certaintly not about pencils but it is  about  perceptions and memories Our journey throughout  is about questioning  our protagonist memories or lack of and the way he preceives  what is in front of  his eyes and in our minds.
We try metaphorically to believe  a normal pencil is in front of us  but slowly as the movie progresses find  the pencil is filled with metal and are forced to question our memories and perceptions in everything we now are going to experience.

Christopher Nolan directs this absolutely engaging film of a man with memory disorder who is hunting down his wife's killer.  Kudos to Nolan for the genius in assembling this mind-blowing, puzzle of a movie.  Guy Pearce, in his first starring role, perfectly nails the leading man, the forgetful Lenny Shelby.  His memories only last 15 minutes maximum, so he has to write down every significant thing that happens in his search for his wife's killer.  The movie unfolds backwards in 15 minute increments, and it is up to the perceptive attentive viewer to piece the puzzle together and figure out this filmatic enigma.

If you desire a challenging, yet fun film, this is it.  I guarantee you will watch it more than once.

How can something so backward be so progressive?  Not a feel-good movie, not a blockbuster, not sexy, but makes you think and care and wonder and beam.

Then again; it didn't do well when it first came out since it was more an art house flick that catered to a very small group. In the theater when I first watched it, I actually saw a guy (outside of myself it was just the two of us!) get up half way through!

1324107,4,B00003CXZ3,"""The first time watching it felt more confusing in the long run as the many seeing it were inattentive and willing to talk over silly quibs. The second time, it was more focused and geared toward the plot and ideas, felt more in synchronisation with this rather bold and complex storyline. For starters, the Nolan fandom (popularity rose after The Dark Knight) has not been a part differing myself from the friend who had a copy of this DVD (who says this is his favourite film). First off, the idea that it is a favourite is nothing to be ashamed of. Memento has something elusive and cryptic about its ideas and thoughts and leaves for multiple discussion and dissecting of particular scenes (in addition, the cinematography, performances, Hans Zimmer-esque soundtrack, indie feel/credibility, and Hitchcockian/Fincher-esque vibes that ring true in this film are prevalent!, esp. in the case of films like Se7en, Blackmail, and Vertigo). Guy Pearce, who plays Leonard/Lenny, steps in the jacket of a James Stewart-type figure arguing for interpretations and perspective of the murder of his wife which sounds about as paranoid/schizophrenic as his short-term memory loss character Leonard as in Vertigo where he idolises a dead body. Trippy, enigmatic, and quite disturbing at moments- this is uncompromising, complex, and without clear elaboration, inventive all the way especially considering it has no source material from a book but through a brotherly bond through Jonathan (Chris' brother) Nolan too in the form of a short story. In all respect, this film is surprisingly more superior than Inception and The Dark Knight Rises given its source material, its foundation, and credentials. While difficult on many corners, it feels more closely knit and compact in scope with many discussion-heavy elements than his more commercial features.""",1358899200,,1847,5.285714285714286

I really enjoy this movie, which I feel is just as fresh and exciting now as it was when it was first released.  But the thing that REALLY impresses me about this movie is that if you watch the scenes in order, the movie still works as a thriller, and a mystery.  The original version, with the scenes played backward, is a gimmick, but but it's not JUST a gimmick.  I highly reccomend buying the Limited Edition DVD, which has an easter egg which allows you to reverse the scenes.

The one annoying thing about the limited edition is that the menu is not set up as a normal menu.  You'll have to either play around and explore the different menu screens, or just google for directions.",1356480000,,747,4.416058394160584

It's definitely a film that requires at least two viewings to fully understand the film's meanings.  If you're a fan of Christopher Nolan's other convoluted films, then this one is definitely something that deserves your consideration.  On the other hand, if you enjoy simple plots and characters, then this is definitely not the movie for you.

On a side note, there's an option on the DVD to view the movie's events in chronological order, but please do yourself a favor and forget about the option...or just don't use it till you've watched the movie at least once.

1324326,5,B00003CXZ3,"MEMENTO: Christopher Nolan's groundbreaking film that revealed to the world that he was one of the most unique new voices in cinema; a man that would prove to be one of the best filmmakers of the last two decades.

I saw this film when it first came out in theaters, and I haven't seen it since. So why the 5-star rating? I was so totally compelled and profoundly disturbed by the film that it falls into the category of ""Brilliant Films I'll Never See Again"" (Another recent example of that is MARTHA MARCY MAY MARLENE). Guy Pearce is the kind of actor who never seems to get the acclaim he so richly deserves, and he's astonishing as Leonard. Joey Pants (Pantoliano) is chewing up a good deal of scenery in this film and certainly appears to steal some scenes, but Pearce's self-effacing charm and quiet intensity make you unable to take your eyes off him. Carrie-Anne Moss doesn't amount to as much as I would have preferred, although that may be more to do with her rather uninteresting performance.

When you get right down to it, the film ultimately belongs to Nolan. By using the reverse-order single-scene narrative, he makes a film that is very uncomfortable to watch since the film essentially is taking place inside Leonard's fractured mind. Being inside of a mind like that is such a disturbing place to be, and I think that's what keeps me from watching the film again, but I can still say without a doubt, I still realize what a powerful, suspenseful and great film MEMENTO is, and I am doubly glad that Chris Nolan continues to make films that not only defy Hollywood convention, but they also push you and challenge your ideas. In another life, Nolan designed great mazes and created great riddles. In this life, you get to see them unfold on-screen, even if you don't get the answer or find the exit.

With the exception of INSOMNIA, which is a film I respect but don't like, Nolan has made some of the very best films of the last decade. From THE PRESTIGE to BATMAN BEGINS to THE DARK KNIGHT to INCEPTION and MEMENTO, Nolan is now a name on par with the very best cinema has to offer.",1335484800,2,2102,4.526315789473684

The packaging has all kinds of tib-bits, as if it were designed by the same people who did the Beck's ""The Information"" CD. The movie is done well, and adds a twist to both the ""backward-drawkcab"" and amnesia themes, and it's an interesting murder mystery with a great twist at the end.

Drama, Mystery, Thriller, 113 minutes
Directed by Christopher Nolan
Starring Guy Pearce, Joe Pantoliano and Carrie-Anne Moss

""What's the last thing you remember?""
""My wife...dying.""

I remember watching Memento on cable and buying it a few days later. It was such an original way of telling a story that I was excited to show it to my friends at the earliest opportunity.

They hated it.

The opening scene shows Leonard Shelby (Pearce) killing Teddy (Pantoliano), but that scene is actually how the story ends. Leonard suffered a head injury when his wife was murdered by intruders and hasn't been able to form short-term memories since the event. He remembers everything up to that point, such as who he is and what he did for a living, but can't build new memories.

What would it be like to wake up every day and wonder where you were? What are you supposed to be doing that day?

In order to place the viewer in a similar position, Nolan tells the story in reverse. We see events unfold and new information is introduced each time. The information changes our perceptions of the events we have already seen and the people we have already met. Who can Leonard trust? How can he keep the information readily available if he's going to forget everything?

Nolan actually tells two stories. One is in black and white and proceeds in normal chronological order. This tells the story of Leonard's life before the accident. He worked as an insurance investigator and one of the claimants, Sammy Jankis, had the same problem with his memory. A tattoo on Leonard's wrist tells him to remember Sammy Jankis, and he's able to because it happened before he suffered the head injury.

A second story shows Leonard's hunt for his wife's murderer. This time, Nolan tells it in color and uses reverse chronological order.

Are you with me so far? Good.

You can see why my friends hated the film. It requires patience and your full attention to understand what is going on. Furthermore, Leonard is an unreliable narrator, so we can't trust everything. Nolan presumably did this to show that Leonard can't trust his own thoughts.

In order to function at all, Leonard employs a series of devices to aid his memory. He also sticks to a routine as much as possible. He takes photos of his car, his motel, and people he meets. As he finds out information about people, he writes notes on the photos.

Teddy is either a crooked cop, a complete liar, or both. He claims to be helping Leonard look for his wife's killer, but he makes several attempts to borrow Leonard's car. When you see the closing scenes, you'll understand what his true motive may be.

Natalie (Moss) is also claiming to help Leonard by providing information. Unfortunately, she also has motives of her own.

Leonard doesn't know who to trust. He also doesn't know how long he's been trying to avenge his wife's death. Because of the nature of the narrative, we aren't even sure that Leonard hasn't already killed the murderer at some point in the past. Are Teddy or Natalie using him for some other purpose? Are they even who they say they are?

I've seen Memento at least twice a year since I first saw it. It has endless replay value and it's interesting to see some of the events unfold when you know the outcome. Nolan gets the little details right as well as the big ones. Notice how Leonard forgets which way the motel door opens and how he brushes his hand against a glass in a restaurant because he's forgotten that he put it there.

Each time I watch a Nolan movie I think it's the best thing he has ever done. Whether it's The Dark Knight, Inception, The Prestige, or Memento, he treats his audience with respect. Rather than spell out every little aspect of the story, he allows the audience to draw its own conclusion. That alienates some viewers, as it did with my friends, but the payoff is worth it if you are willing to pay full attention.",1330473600,10,3925,4.625899280575539
1324330,5,B00003CXZ3,"Memento is one of those few movies which are complicated to understand at first, but after a few times watching it over you seem to understand at it better and better. A man who is in search of his wife's murder but suffers from short term memory loss. Basically he can't make new memories after the incident, he could only remember memories prior to the incident. Meaning if he had killed his wife's murdered he won't remember.
  I've read several reviews saying the movie is trash. Most likely is because the movie is played backwards and is divided into two section. One section is black and white which is relative to his past experiences before the incident. While the scenes in color are the present. At some point in the movie they both meet up, and start to make sense. The limited edition dvd does have a speacial feature which plays the entire movie in chronological order.

#1: Guide to Accessing Extras on 2-DVD Limited Edition

While disc 1 isn't that bad (within a few seconds, I figured out that clicking ""read"" accesses subtitles, ""comments"" turns on the audio commentary, etc.), trying to find the extras on disc 2 can be very frustrating.  If you enjoy the challenge of mapping out the contents for yourself, more power to you, have a blast.  For the rest of us:

I haven't gone through all 950+ reviews to see if someone has already posted this information, but I've found two websites that detail how to access everything(?) on the discs:
[...]
[...]

Edit: Ok, Amazon removed the hyperlinks, and I can understand why.  So, I'll reproduce some of the information here, what I consider the most important pieces.  Do your own web search if you want more.

To run the movie in reverse (i.e. chronological order):
. Select the clock icon (NOT the watch icon)
. Answer ""C"" to every question you're asked
. Order the photographs 3-4-1-2

To access a menu of supplements (""Anatomy of a Scene"" featurette, director's script, stills/production sketches gallery, international poster art gallery)
. Select the clock icon (NOT the watch icon)
. Answer ""E"" to every question you're asked

There's plenty more, so do a web search if you're interested.

#2: Blu-Ray: buy 10th Anniversary Edition, not the older 'original'

I just received the 10th Anniversary Edition Blu-Ray.  By chance, I visited a friend who has the original Blu-ray and was able to compare.  The 10th Anniversary Edition is not a re-packaging of the original with more extras (all the extras from the 2-DVD set are now present).  The picture is greatly improved (the original is 'soft' - the 10th anniversary edition shows much more detail).  Also, the strangeness of the menus on the 2-DVD set is gone.

Note: The 2-DVD set allowed you to play the movie ""in reverse"", i.e. in chronological order.  That option is not present on either Blu-Ray release, as far as I can tell.  So, if you own the 2-DVD set and want to keep the ability to play the movie ""in reverse"", you'll have to keep Disc 2 from the 2-DVD set, and be satisfied with standard def for the ""in reverse"" version.",1327449600,15,2299,4.757575757575758

Even the disk does not follow the Newtonian cause/effect nexus we know on this planet--standard  DVD commands such as find scenes do not work, which in turn make it impossible to uncover the ""reality"" (if any.) Supposedly flashbacks of (anti?)hero who devolved from reputable insurance agent to  justified vigilante, with such memory loss that cannot function in this space-time despite carrying inch-thick file of documentation and writing, yea  bodily tattooing, important considerations as to who/what (has/is to?) occur(red). Like Run Lola Run, but less coherent. Unreliable narrator cannot maintain distinctions between multiple realities and  his constant shifts of P.O.V between color and b/w are unhelpful;  happenings and identities shift, even between friend and foe constantly and nothing is what it appears. Cannot exist in this universe, assuming Occam's Razor applies in an America filmed in 2000. Therefore either (1) space and time fold back on each other at the individual level without warning or (2)it's a drug-induced bad trip. Drugs are mentioned throughout and fantasy desiderata such as protagonist killing a gangster to take on his Jaguar and girlfriend and even clothing, not to mention a free $200,000 to live on without a job, with no law enforcement or Mob penalties (scot free)are much in evidence.

There now you have an Easter egg version of Memento in chronological order like you've probably heard of. Well, it's not a myth.",1310342400,3,594,4.5092592592592595
1324387,5,B00003CXZ3,"Leonard's mission to find the man who murdered his wife faces a big handicap. With his total loss of short term memory, he can't hang on to the clues he finds.

The movie shows us Leonard's story from end to beginning so it's easy to get caught up in the strange loops of the narrative. This technique is not just a gimmick. The inverted sequence drives the story in ways that make events flow in a way we can follow, but also hits us with sudden ambushes. Memento puts us inside the mind of a man whose mind can't work right. The experience is strange and disorienting, rare and uncomfortable.

The best illustration of this occurs some way through the movie. We are abruptly cut to a junk yard, and we hear Leonard thinking to himself ""Am I chasing him? Or is he chasing me?"" And at this point, we don't know. Despite everything we've seen and heard, and figured out so far, we have NO idea. There is simply no way to make it fit in. And no time to sort it out. We are very much in Leonard's skin.

Even if told in a normal sequence, Memento has layers beyond the story line. Beyond the story line about Leonard's mission, we see how life delivers rough justice:  What happens to Leonard is rough justice for what did to someone else suffering from memory loss. The stranger we see Leonard murder at the beginning of the movie has received severe judgement for his crimes. Also, everyone who interacts with Leonard takes advantage as soon as they discover his shortcoming. A pretty dark take on human nature.

""in medias res"" starting the story in the middle is an effective to tell a story. Memento may begin at the end, but it constantly keeps us in the middle of things. The rare experience it provides is good reason to see it. It's also the reason it's not a big commercial success. Watching Memento again, you can't re-experience what you experience seeing it the first time, and you may find the initial experience so disconcerting you don't recognize that that's the payoff. I'm glad I rented it. It gave me a rare, disturbing experience that I couldn't recapture.",1307923200,3,2074,4.50531914893617

1324463,4,B00003CXZ3,"Christopher Nolan's Memento is one of those films you may have to view several times to truly appreciate. I had heard plenty of buzz about this film for years, but only recently saw it. At many points, I think the viewers are as perplexed as Leonard Shelby. Leonard Shelby(Guy Pearce), searching for his wife's killer, has a rare condition that doesn't allow him to remember certain events. Events are remembered only in a haphazard way, and, for this reason, he uses notes and pictures as an aid for his memory. What makes the film unique is simply the way it is told, using a non-linear or chronological way of telling the story, but rather scattered and fragmented bits and pieces of time through the point of view of Leonard. We have 10-15 minute segments that reveal events and partial memories, and we are constantly rewinding and fast forwarding to a slightly different version of the plot. It's a bit jarring at first, and difficult to follow, but it doesn't alienate the audience, and eventually the viewer is able to pick up on this type of narrative. Give Nolan credit for pulling off such a film and having very few inconsistencies. Several key characters could make or break the case in Leonard's search, but his reliance on scraps of paper and notes only give him partial, vague clues about who to trust. Therefore, from Leonard's point of view, the line between friend and enemy is always indistinct. Memento somehow manages to mimic its storyline with its film techniques, with scattered clues here and there, and is a cerebral whodunit experience for the viewer to try to piece together. It is also a unique, stylish, film that has great pacing and building suspense, and finishes with a nice twist. Just the kind of film for those who are sick of the same old, same old that Hollywood spews out. As far as the extras, they were so-so, hence the 4 star instead of 5 star rating.",1299974400,,1895,4.676646706586826

1324465,4,B00003CXZ3,"I watched ""Memento"" because I saw it in the book ""501 Must-See Movies"".  My observation of the books selections is that a few of those movie I didn't really have to see but ""Memento"" is one that lived up to the billing.  I admit to being scepticle at first because it seemed that I was watching the movie backwards in sequences.  I wondered what kind of movie it would be since much of it was rerun scenes.  However, I realized that this was a unique movie that keeps the viewers guessing (although I can imagine that some may have taken it back to the video rental without watching the whole movie).  The retelling of the various scenes created impressions as well as doubts and that really came together at the end.  However, the ending was not typical either.  It left us wondering what is the reality.  Along the way there were at least two or three scenes where I had to double-check to see if what I saw was real or not.  ""Memento"" has a plot but it seems less important to the film than the twists and turns it takes us on.  In the end, I was pretty dazed by what I had seen but I knew it had been an exciting ride.  I suggest most people should watch ""Memento"" at least once (excepting small children and pregnant women).  I don't know that I will watch it again but I'm sure there are a lot of people who do watch it over and over.

1324466,5,B00003CXZ3,"The only bad thing I can say about Memento is that it has put the bar so high that I have been searching for a film of its caliber ever since. Possessed of the sort of evocative plot that guarantees that I will be there on opening day, it thrilled me just reading the synopsis, never mind that rush after leaving the theatre that comes from being completely in thrall. It is beyond doubt, one of the most startling concepts ever put to film. And its not only the plot itself, but the way in which it is told, that makes this a classic. I LOVE when i meet people who have never seen this film, and scratch my head when i meet the occasional person who didn't enjoy it. Inevitably, its the action-movie types who want to be able to run to the concession or make up another batch of chicken wings and come back and still be able to hang onto the plot who wound up disappointed. It demands an absolute attention that many moviegoers will find exhausting, but for me, its why films are made. God, just watching it (which I have, many, many times) still gives me a thrill.

1324470,5,B00003CXZ3,"Took like 2 months to get this product. Amazon assumed the package was delivered, but there was no signature confirmation (probably because the item was a mail-slot-sized box). They asked me to review it the first time, and I'm all ""I never even got this.""

On the bright side, after I filed the ticket, the movie was delivered within 2 days.

In itself, the 2-disc set is a microscopic marvel of DVD-packaging production. The dvd box is themed as a medical history folio of Leonard Shelby, the star of Memento. It has a post-it that tells you to 'watch,' and a number of photostatic copies of various medically-themed sheets, just as flavor for the box.

The movie itself is amazing. Shot in reverse chronological order, Memento is an investigative psychological action-drama starring brain-damaged hero Leonard Shelby. Someone raped and killed his wife and destroyed his ability to remember, but he's created a system of polaroids, tattoos and very specific notes to take the place of memory. Since he can no longer form long-term memories, the audience is taken on a ride with Leonard in the way he sees life. The movie starts with Teddy (Joe Pantoliano) getting shot in the head by Leonard, and it continues as a slow reveal of exactly why this had to happen, and how Leonard, with no ability to know why, was certain that Teddy was the one who killed his wife. This is accomplished through scenes (each exactly the length of time Leonard can remember before forgetting) in reverse order accompanied with segments of a phone call between Leonard and an unknown caller, describing his condition, letting the audience know exactly what he's capable of, and how he manages to function day-to-day.

But what if you wanted to disentangle the chronological mess the movie finds itself in and really see how Leonard Shelby would look in real life? You then use the hidden movie on Disc 2. I won't explain how, but on the extras disc you can find a full copy of the movie, spliced into chronological order.

In terms of the climax, lots of things cleared up by the time the black-n-white (forward) and the color (backwards) met up. That's when the movie really started making sense.

There were some gross moments that turned my stomach, but other than that, the violence was tolerable. It wasn't as bad as I was expecting.

Oh,since I did mark it spoiler, I believe that the cop was telling the truth about everything. For a few reasons, one of which was Lenny's memory of giving his wife an insulin shot. By the end, it seemed to me that he made up the story about Jenkins in order to ""deal"" with his role in his wife's death. And then his monologue at the end where he pretty much set up the cop so that he would be the one he went after was creepy.

1324517,4,B00003CXZ3,"Mostly Christopher Nolan gets pub for being the man behind Batman Begins and The Dark Knight, but with the popularity of Inception people, are starting to get a handle on the dark twisty directing style that is really his bread and butter. Also, seeing as I am actually unsure yet as to whether I will pay to go see Inception, I decided to temper that by retro reviewing this one.

Memento was not the first movie he directed, but it is the movie that really put him on the map and was his first movie to actually have a cast and a budget. (even though it was a small one) He made some smart casting decisions by casting the always great Guy Pierce as Lenny and surrounding him with a cast of solid supportive character actors. Oddly, he snagged two of the cast from the previous years Sci/Fi smash the Matrix. Carrie-Ann Moss and Joe Pantoliano both had major roles in that movie, and are the two major supporting actors in Memento. They both give excellent performances. Also, you can see a cameo by Jorja Fox in this film as Lenny's wife when she is shown in the flashback scenes. She is more commonly recognized in her role on CSI as Sara Sidle. The acting will not be a disappointment in this film which is important since this is primarily a character and dialogue driven film. Guy Pierce particularly sells this film with his continually ability to make the fact his characters memories keep disappearing believable. The acting however, is not what makes this movie distinctive as a Christopher Nolan vehicle.

What Christopher Nolan loves to do, and does well, is winding a plot that makes it difficult to separate the reality from the fiction. He is striving for more than just a simple plot hook with a twist at the end. He is trying to craft a movie that makes the audience completely engage with the characters, yet been completely in the dark about what is real and what isn't. A Nolan film is unmistakeable in its artistic value. Its dark gritty, and his style is very distinct. Its hard to describe but you know it when you see it and by all accounts Inception might be his opus when it comes to this style and reality bending. But this all started with Memento, which deals with something nearly as fragmentary and illusory as dreams, memory. If you are a lover of the movie Inception, then you owe it to yourself to watch the movie that started Nolan on this path, and if you have seen it then you should go re-watch it, Memento is truly a great movie.",1281916800,,2469,4.484444444444445
1324518,5,B00003CXZ3,"Though Memento wasn't Christopher Nolan's very first film, it was his first shot at the big time, as Doodlebug was a 3 minute short and Following was a student film made on a budget of under $6,000. So, you could call Memento a memento of Christopher Nolan's inception as a professional director. It is based on a story that his brother Jonathan wrote about a man who suffers from Anterograde Amnesia--the inability to form new memories after damage to the hippocampus. This character is named Leonard Shelby and he is played by the versatile Australian Actor, Guy Pearce:

---------
Leonard Shelby: It's just an anonymous room. There's nothing in the drawers. But you look anyway. Nothing except the Gideon bible, which I, of course, read religiously.
===============

Pearce is really good in this, and though the premise has a built in catch--since he can't remember anything he continuously says the same things and tells the same stories until the people he meets and the audience are both totally fed up--I enjoyed his performance a lot. Leonard is bent on getting revenge on the man who murdered his wife, but his memory problem not only makes this especially difficult--he takes notes, Polaroids, and even has important ""facts"" tattooed on himself in a futile attempt to keep track of it all--it also makes us doubt the veracity of his subjective view of reality. Is he really on track to get revenge, or is he being manipulated by others with their own agendas? And if he does get revenge, how will he enjoy that dish--best served cold--if he can't even remember it being served? And even the memories he does have, the ones formed before the accident, how does he know that they are true?

Leonard Shelby--and the other characters, too--are all the ultimate Unreliable Narrators. I first heard the term in conjunction with the novel The Good Soldier by Ford Maddox Ford, but if you watch the director's interview in the DVD bonus material, Nolan uses it to describe Leonard. Such elevated concepts and questioning of the very nature of reality are the hallmarks of Nolan's films. He is a rare director who can both toy with philosophy and a big budget, and still fill the seats. An art house director whose films are blockbusters. Memento, while certainly no blockbuster, was at least successful enough to allow him to keep making films. I have not seen Inception yet, but it seems to be doing very well at the box office, while sporting a convoluted and deep plot that once again questions the nature of reality. Both Memento and Inception remind me in a way of The Matrix, and by the way, the other two supporting cast members--Carrie-Anne Moss and Joe Pantoliano--were both in The Matrix as Trinity and Cypher respectively. They are both feeding Shelby stories that may or may not be true. In Memento, who isn't an Unreliable Narrator?

The fun of watching Memento is putting together the pieces of the puzzle. It alternates between flashback scenes, which are in black and white, and color scenes that are present time, moving forward. The chronology of this approach is identical to the way F. Scott Fitzgerald wrote The Great Gatsby with each flashback sequence going further and further back in time until at the end the puzzle of Gatsby's greatness is solved. Now that I think of it, Nick Carraway was also a kind of Unreliable Narrator, because the first thing he says is:

In my younger and more vulnerable years my father gave me some advice that I've been turning over in my mind ever since.

""Whenever you feel like criticizing any one,"" he told me, ""just remember that all the people in this world haven't had the advantages that you've had.""

And Carraway then proceeds to use the rest of the book to harshly judge and criticize just about everyone, advantaged or not.

1324519,5,B00003CXZ3,"I'll admit it, it took me nine years to get to this film. It couldn't possibly exceed the hype. There was just so much critical love for this film that it couldn't possibly deserve it. Yet, after the movie had ended for my first viewing, I was left with the words, ""Holy crap, that was pretty good."" My mind was blown at the ending, and after this mind-frak of a film, I left to meditate on it. Then I watched it again after a month, and I stuck with my original opinion that this is in fact, a really good and original thriller. Is it perfect? No, but it's still quite the classic and a must-see for everybody, at least once.

If there's one reason to watch this movie, it's in the way it's presented. It starts at the end, starts at the beginning, and alternates between the two until they meet in the middle, to which the movie is wrapped up. It works for the story, and keeps the viewers on their toes in keeping track of everything. Let me illustrate to you the brilliance in this presentation. There's a scene where Carrie-Ann Moss comes up to Guy Pearce in her house, bleeding and bruised. She tells Guy Pearce that it was her boyfriend did it to her and that Guy needs to get rid of one of his associates. Seems harmless enough, right? Right, but you just watched the scene without context. Then it moves to the scene that led up to the previous scene. Carrie-Ann Moss comes into a room, Carrie-Ann Moss tells Guy that she's going to use him & proceeds to go on a obscenity-laced tirade directed towards Guy. Only problem is that Guy will never remember this conversation in a minute because he can't write down that Carrie-Ann Moss is actually bad. Guy then hits her, causing her to bleed, so Carrie-Ann Moss walks out the door. She sits in her car for a minute, and then Guy forgets everything that just happened to him, and Carrie-Ann Moss walks through the door as seen in the scene previously, or afterwords. It's more or less brilliant and Nolan uses it to his advantage to spice up an already great story.

If there's on fact the movie wants to get across to you, it's that this short-term memory loss makes your life a living hell. The movie goes deep into the detail of how somebody with this condition would live. What are the downsides, what is their life like? Does the ending take things a little bit too far, in basically revealing that half of what the movie told you was a basically a lie? Yeah, maybe a little bit. But hey, the reveal speech by Joe Pantoliano and Guy Pearce is great. And again, it's a 'Holy Crap' moment that will leave you satisfied on your first viewing. Did I get the same feeling the second time around? No. Since I was diverted thinking about the mystery of it all, I started thinking about the more logical points of the movies and the detail. In this sense, the movie didn't hold up for me the second time around. Plus, I must ask, is Carrie-Ann Moss' character really necessary? I mean, besides the scenes that I mentioned above, was she really essential to the movie, or was she just a diversion, or just another person to manipulate Guy Pearce after Joe Pantoliano is gone?

Overall, I would highly recommend seeing Memento once. Any more than that is risky. Sure, it's brilliant, but some of the magic from the first viewing was lost on the second, as least for me. Still a classic, I really hope I never get that short-term memory loss.",1278288000,,3391,4.413738019169329
1324520,5,B00003CXZ3,"I saw this movie a couple of years ago, and, now that I'm old enough to have short term memory myself LOL, I decided to watch it again on a whim. I am amazed at how the film stands up. I saw nuances this viewing that I don't remember seeing in the last. Nolan is doing Inception, due out in July, and the theme sounds similar. I cannot recommend this movie enough. Eventually, you will put certain flashbacks and fast-forwards together and be stunned at the ""real"" story. Thumbs up!",1273881600,,482,4.366666666666666

1324560,5,B00003CXZ3,"Leonard is an insurance investigator whose memory has been damaged following a head injury he sustained after intervening on his wife's murder. His quality of life has been severely hampered after this event, and he can now only live a comprehendable life by tattooing notes on himself and taking pictures of things with a Polaroid camera. The movie is told in forward flashes of events that are to come that compensate for his unreliable memory, during which he has liaisons with various complex characters. Leonard badly wants revenge for his wife's murder, but, as numerous characters explain, there may be little point if he won't remember it in order to provide closure for him. The movie veers between these future occurrences and a telephone conversation Leonard is having in his motel room in which he compares his current state to that of a client whose claim he once dealt with. If you're looking for something intense, suspenseful, and different than your usual effects-packed thriller, this is the best movie. It's brilliant story telling. You might get frustrated because you don't know what's going on. That's okay. In fact, that's the whole idea. Sit back and find out just how twisted and complex Leonard's world is. You'll have a hard time forgetting how much you enjoyed it.",1267574400,3,1292,4.986111111111111
1324561,5,B00003CXZ3,"I saw this film when it first came out in theaters about 10 years ago.  As has been well described in other reviews, it's a brilliant psychological thriller that keeps you guessing as you see each scene the way the main character would- without any memory of what came before.  As the film progresses, into the past, the mystery is gradually revealed, and what we find out at the end, which is what happened at the beginning, gives new meaning to everything that came after.  Sound confusing?  Well it is.  Which is why the film is worth seeing again.

Seeing it again after 10 years was a strange experience, and even more fulfilling than the first time.  That's because I didn't remember how the story ended (or began), so I could appreciate the unraveling of the mystery anew.  And yet, with each new plot detail revealed, I began to have vague recollections of what would happen next.  That made each scene more significant and enjoyable.

To put it another way, when you see the film the first time, you're mostly in the dark about what's really going on until the end.  And by then you may have forgotten much of what you saw because you didn't know it mattered at the time.  Seeing it again, each detail becomes richer in meaning, the film seems deeper, and I could appreciate it on another level.

When you get past the superficial level of the plot mystery, what remains is a meditation on how we choose who we are in the world, and the role that memory plays.

After seeing this film, you may feel just a bit queasy, as you consider whether the foundation of your reality is as firm as you thought. We are, after all, what we know.  And we know only what we can remember.  And memory is imperfect at best, and may in fact be just a well-crafted illusion to create the world we want to live in.  In that world, the meaning we bring to each new day is just a product of the memories we carry with us.  There is a little bit of Leonard Shelby in all of us.",1266969600,2,1963,4.346153846153846
1324562,3,B00003CXZ3,"This is a intricate crime story, and somewhat confusing to watch.  The main character, Leonard Shelby (Guy Pearce)  has lost his short-term memory.  His long-term memory is intact.  He can remember details and everything that happened before his ""accident"", but cannot retain what he has done or said five or ten minutes after doing anything (anterograde amnesia).  He is unsure of who to trust, who are his friends, what is true and his only goal is revenge, finding the man who raped and murdered his wife.  He is focused only on justice.

He is well-built, thin, handsome, wearing expensive suits, driving an expensive jaguar, but lives in ratty, run-down motels, paying cash for all he wants.  He is a former insurance investigator, very aware of his handicap, explaining to people in great detail why he has trouble knowing them or remembering what he told them.  He has to rely on others, his index cards, photos, and skin tattoos to latch on to his past thoughts and observations.

Leonard has psychological issues as he fights and struggles to interpret the evidence he finds and keeps on index cards and hiding places.  The film starts from the endpoint, the murder of ""Teddy"" known as John Edward Gammell.  The film re-winds and stalls in the present at times -  it is complex and confusing to refigure the frames and realize how the meaning of events changes.  The bad and good criss-cross as the story unfolds.  It seems the color scenes are shown in reverse order and black and white are chronological.  The two sequences come together at the end of the film.

Leonard meets a woman named Natalie after finding a note in his clothes.  Natalie at first is angry and resentful because she identifies Leonard with the clothes and car of her boyfriend Jimmy.  After being educated about Leonard's short-term memory she uses him to drive a threatening man out of town.  She offers to run the license plate on Leonard's latest tattoo to help in his investigation.

The ending is somewhat of a surprise if you can figure out the movie's timeline.",1266364800,,2052,4.789173789173789

He can remember everything in his life perfectly up until that omnious night.  Out of revenge, Leonard (guy pierce) searches for his wife's murderer.  But he can't be certain about anything as he tries to uncover the truth.  This is a deep movie and it took me a couple of times watching it to understand a few things.

1324566,5,B00003CXZ3,"This gripping revenge thriller will keep you guessing from beginning to end and keep you talking long after it is over. With it's unusual style and it's extremely complex plot, Memento will take you for a mesmerizing ride that you will not soon forget. Leonard, possessing a rare brain disease that leaves him incapable of forming new memories, is on a constant search for the man who murdered his wife. Leonard's disease, however, makes this search for revenge seemingly impossible. He must assemble numerous clues for himself, some in the form of tattoos, others in the form of Polaroid pictures of people relating to his search. These clues leave Leonard with just a hint of who the people around him are and provide him with knowledge of the previous progress he has made. The viewer follows Leonard, without any awareness of who is pulling the strings, from the eventual finding of the suspected killer to the start of Leonard's escapade. This backwards telling of events leaves the viewer in a similar state to Leonard's, having no idea what has just previously happened and how or why the current situation is taking place.
 Memento is a great movie to own because it is one of those rare movies that you will want to watch over and over again. With it's intricate plot and changing perceptions of characters throughout, there is always some missed hidden detail waiting to be discovered. If you like thriller movies that will keep your mind stimulated while keeping you at the edge of your seat, you need to buy this movie.

Christopher Nolan has crafted an inventive psychological thriller that keeps the viewer guessing right up until the final scene. Guy Pierce gives a nicely measured performance and is supported by a solid cast. It's an enjoyable challenge to rewind the movie in your head, as you watch, in order to keep track of the reversed narrative. And the pay-off at the end is also quite satisfying.

From the first minute of this thing I was hooked, held in trance for two hours until it ended...or should I say began? Employing a relatively unique approach to storytelling in a movie, Memento begins at the end and then works slowly backwards, kind of taking two steps back for every step forward. While initially somewhat disconcerting, it's eventually revealed to be a wondrously effective method that, to an extent, mirrors some of the confusion felt by Leonard. Because Leonard forgets information he knew the day before or even minutes before, the backward storytelling mechanism is able to function effectively for us, as information he knew at the beginning of events is not revealed to us until the end. Leonard's condition resultant from a head injury he suffered trying to save his wife--he writes everything down. However, his memories from before the incident are mostly intact, something that is both curse and blessing as memories of his lost wife--his lost life--torment and drive him. He prints notations on Kodak snapshots to retain photographic evidence for himself of, for example, which car is his, which hotel he's staying at, the people he knows--both the ones he believes are helping him and the ones he believes are not. The most crucial information he has tattooed on his body, and his entire body is crosshatched with inked information--clues to remember what has happened, what he's doing, vital information on the suspect he's pursuing--the most chilling of which is written backwards on his chest so he can read it in the mirror. Joe Pantoliano and Carrie-Anne Moss have absolutely killer roles and performances as supporting characters, and Guy Pearce's portrayal of Leonard is convincing beyond all measure. I was edge-of-the-couch engrossed in this, itching to find out what was what, who was who, and the twisting revelations gradually revealed along the way never ceased to intrigue and affect me.

1324683,5,B00003CXZ3,"Chris Nolan movies are starting to grow on me.  The director of Following, Batman, etc., tells a story of a guy who has no short-term memory, who keeps notes all over the place, even tattooing the more important ones, to remember what happened an hour or even ten minutes before.  It's also about a drug-dealing gal who wants to get back at her boyfriend and a few other guys and uses our hero's lack of memory to use him for her own vengeance.

It's a story about vengeance and the blocks in the road to achieving it, that even with your handicap you can stay the course.  But what if the course is twisted and you can barely remember the whys and hows of it all?

It's about a guy who feels guilty for what he did to a guy who had the same condition and also had a wife who died.

Nolan's film is the most unusual cinematic adventure I've ever seen.  It's not your basic action thriller, though there's plenty of both.  It plays backwards.  You get the ending right from the start and then find how he got there.

I heard that there is a ""linear"" version that goes from the ""end"" and moves to the ""beginning"", but that would be really dumb.  That defeats the whole premise!

Get the DVDs on Amazon, it's a must-own for sure.

1324687,4,B00003CXZ3,"There is much to like here.  The film is a tour de force in many respects.  What is troubling isn't so much the film but the passionate reverence of its fans.  For thousands of years, artists have striven to find forms with which the incoherence and complexity of ""reality"" can be communicated to people.  In the best art, a kind of sublime simplicity is achieved.  Now, we are giving birth to a new form: the puzzle film.  This genre seems to propose that chopping up time and skewing perception can take us further towards understanding the world than conventional means can.  But this is a false idea:  in the end these puzzle films work best only as mind games.  Any aesthetic connection to deeper ideas is really just gravy.  ""Babel"" was perhaps the most corrupt example:  at its heart was a ridiculously contrived matinee thriller masquerading as an indie art film.  ""Memento"" is more of a Borges story elaborated to epic proportions.  Fascinating, yes.  Brilliant at times, perhaps.  But, in the end a bauble for people who like to stare at baubles thinking themselves wise for doing so. The ""profound"" content about identity, projection, etc. really could have been explored with less fuss.  The film may one day be viewed as a symptom of our inability to make sense of our lives in a fractured moment in time, an example of our social illness rather than a work of art.  And a depressing experience, to boot.  Baroque, in the worst sense, in that it will inspire a whole new generation of fan boys to invent ever more clever and complicated toys with which to engage the minds of their ""soul"" mates.

Still, hats off to the filmmakers and cast for an impressive, if dubious achievement:  this is probably the best film of its genre.

So I highly suggest watching the special features first because it helps explain the movement of the film and gets you prepared. Otherwise, the viewer may get lost. The story is about Leonard, so traumatized by a blow to the head after his wife's rape and murder, that he has lost his short-term memory sohe  takes Polaroids of everyone he meets and writes notes on them so he can remember them later. He also has tattoos all over his body which are all reminders as well.

This film was meant to be somewhat confusing for the viewer because it is confusing for the main character as well, who is our guide throughout this film.

I really enjoyed this film and it is definitely worth the buy. I would highly suggest getting the two-disc limited edition because it has some helpful extras which make the movie a little easier to understand for the viewer",1228867200,,943,4.601190476190476
1324691,5,B00003CXZ3,"Definitely strange, interesting and fun!!! Very unique idea for a film!!!

This movie is for the ""COMPLEX THINKER"" or the ""DYSLEXIC MIND"" ...few can put this movie together in less than 2 or 3 viewings. This film literally runs forward from the end of the movie yet backwards at the same time; adding supposed real-time moments where the main character is on the phone or reminiscing about things he remembers before his assault.

Strangely enough, I got this movie the first time viewing it!! Hm?

To fully get this award winning ""never been done before"" storyline you'll quickly discover that you're viewing the movie in reverse while the chapter's (scene's) are running forward... maybe better said as, ""The last scene/end of the movie is run forward first as the movie starts - then things reverse so you start at the beginning of each prior scene (that you haven't seen yet) watch it to it's end - arriving at the last (prior) scene's start and so on""!!!

Got that?

Then if that wasn't enough you'll soon discover that this is a movie about a man who's short term memory has been lost (brain trauma) by an assault on him and his wife. His wife is apparently killed and he can only remember up to that moment (birth until trauma). New memories can never be formed and since he's decided to solve his wife's murder and his assault he has to write himself notes and other various extreme things so as to remember what he has discovered from day to day ...or is it month to month? ...year to year??

The day after this movie, if you aren't the thinker type you're brain will definitely hurt!!!",1226102400,,1595,4.598591549295775
1324755,5,B00003CXZ3,"With his second feature film, director Christopher Nolan (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Following/dp/B00000F3CD/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Following</a>) created a stunning thriller. Not only is Memento an incredible accomplishment as a film, but also an impressive feat for a relatively new filmmaker. The film's screenplay, which was written by Nolan and was inspired by his brother Jonathan's short story, is nothing short of brilliant. The story taps the best ideas from both classic noir and detective films of the late 1940s, as well as more contemporary psychological suspense films, and the result is a film, which is in essence a neo-noir/thriller. Skillfully, Christopher Nolan avoids the all-too-familiar pitfalls of the two genres while acknowledging their inherent strengths. Rich in atmosphere and character, Memento is a modern classic and a prime example of using an intricate narrative to heighten a story's impact.

Ever since his wife was assaulted, Leonard Shelby (marvelously portrayed by Guy Pearce) has suffered from a rare disorder. His mind is incapable of creating new memories, so everything he has experienced since the attack he forgets in a matter of minutes. Left with little to live for, Leonard vows that he will avenge his wife... but this proves to be difficult without his short-term memory. Leonard relies on mementos (lists, notes, photographs, and even tattoos) to aid him in his search for the killer, but he is also forced to trust strangers. Among those that he confides in are Teddy (played by Joe Pantoliano, with an irritating smirk) a sarcastic snitch with connections on both sides of the law and Natalie (played by Carrie-Anne Moss, who straddles the line between sympathetic victim and sadistic seductress), the girlfriend of a missing drug dealer. As Leonard follows the clues it becomes apparent that the people he surround himself with are not what he perceived them to be. They are either exploiting his disability for their own gain or manipulating him to keep him from the shocking truth about his wife's death and the identity of her killer. Leonard realizes that he can trust no one, not even himself.

When Memento was released, it was hailed as a visionary piece of filmmaking and it's clear that the greatest star of the film is its story, which unfolds in a series of segments shown in reversed chronological order. This method, which might have spoiled the ending in any other film, is miraculous in that it places the story's climax in the beginning of the film and then allows the audience to see what events lead up to that final act. In recent years many filmmakers have played with viewers' expectations and intentionally subverted those expectations, leading to mixed results. Often filmmakers that embrace such an unorthodox narrative to tell a story do so to individualize their films, but if their films had were to be edited into a more typical narrative structure, then they would lose their originality. Not so with Memento. Its narrative isn't just a manipulative gimmick to keep audiences interested. The story almost requires this dyslexic treatment so that viewers will gain greater insight into the protagonist's dilemma. Another unique aspect is its psychological inner workings, which suggests many things about the nature of corruption and revenge. If one were capable of forgetting their past transgressions, are they then purified by their ignorance of those transgressions or are they forever condemned to suffer the consequences of their actions... again... and again... and again? Do our memories determine who we are or does our character shape our memories to suit our needs? If only we knew; if only we could remember.

Well, it does work backwards, but it's not confusing if you pay attention and don't talk all the way through it. If you really have trouble, just watch it all the way through again. It's a really good movie, and they do a good job of making everything as clear to you as it is to the main character, Leonard. The problem is... Leonard has short-term memory loss, so we see things from his viewpoint: bits and pieces, flashes of memory, etc. His life is confusing and hard for him to follow at times. If the movie were linear, it would be boring. The ""suprise"" and the ""end"" is really more like a suprise beginning, and... well, we just couldn't have had that twist if we'd have known what was going on all along.

1324763,5,B00003CXZ3,"With all the movies out there that pretty much tell you what to think and feel, this movie is a great escape. It's a great murder thriller, a wonderfully acted masterpiece, and a storyline worth your attention.

Christopher Nolan does a great editing job (subliminal messages, anyone?). The main point to the story revolves around Leoard Shelby (Pierce) , a man with ""a condition"" who is trying to solve the murder of his wife. And with that bit of information, you'd think you'd seen it all. But, the actors, the plot, the storyline, and how it's all plays out is far more engaging.

You get to put the pieces together with Lenny, and try to figure out the unsavory characters, the trustworhy friends, and no one is what they seem. The real highlight is not in the ending, but in the way the story is told to the audience. (Just to hint: there are two storylines that climax, and the way you get there is awesome!) It's this type of story-telling that sets the movie apart from many other murder mysteries.

Not that you won't get the movie in one sitting, but half of the fun is not understanding the movie chronologically, but trying to uncover all the plot devices and subliminal schemes Nolan purposefully inserts throughout the movie.

Of course, the cast is excellent. And what I like most is that there aren't too many auxillary characters. Almost everyone you're introduced to is important and helps the story along.

Again, I highly recommend this movie to anyone who loves a good murder mystery, but isn't afraid to have the movie take you for a whirl before figuring it all out!",1214179200,,1590,4.644128113879003

This is a movie in which you find yourself investigating something different each time. After the movie's over, you may find yourself debating which characters were actually honest and sincere and who were not.

The dvd package is very cool. This is the kind of product you can appreciate because it's unique and the layout of the case inside and out reflects the characteristics of the movie. The inside flips upward. There's post-it notes on the inside and pages from a psychiatric file (Leonard Shelby's).

1324804,5,B00003CXZ3,"The reason Memento is so amazing is that it's told in reverse.  It's completely unique, a trend-setting idea.  There are small tidbits at a time, just enough to give a clue about what happened.  It's a truly amazing idea that keeps a viewer slightly off-center the entire movie.  Memento is truly ground-breaking when it comes to the movie-making aspect and story-telling style in cinema.

The basic story of Memento is about revenge.  When someone wrongs someone you love, to what lengths would you go to avenge their death?  Now, throw in a slight road-block: you have no short-term memory.

Leonard (Guy Pierce) wakes up unaware of anything.  The only clues he has are tattooed all over his body.  On his arms, on his chest, everywhere there is a patch of skin he has notes to himself.  The only thing he knows is that all his tattoos, and several polaroid photos, are clues towards the mystery that is his wife's rape and murder.

The wide-reaching impact of short-term memory loss is immense.  A person could never go to school, learn a new language, quote a recent conversation, or visit an interesting site that was just happened upon.  And, depending on when the memory lapse hit, a person could forget something a simple as wiping after going to the bathroom.

Of course, that could come in handy if someone happened to have a dreadful one night stand; they'd never have to own up to it.  Maybe they have a favorite book; each time it would be the best book ever.  Each surprise movie ending would be the same time and again (would really help when watching movies like Sixth Sense).

1324809,5,B00003CXZ3,"Memento is a truly complex and engrossing thriller, full of twists and ambiguous peripheral sub-plots which only the most observant of viewers will catch. If you can get interested enough to explore beyond the basic experience, it's as about as cerebral anything committed to celluloid in its depth and deliverance of narrative.

Leonard Shelby has a memory span of around 15 minutes (not a hard and fast rule - this can change dependent on stress) due to Anterograde Amnesia - meaning he can remember the past but cannot make new memories - as the result of head trauma suffered during an attack in which his wife, we are lead to believe, was killed. Now, with only notes and Polaroid pictures to remind himself of what he is doing, he's searching for the killer in order to extract revenge.

Okay, so it's an original story, and it's also really original insofar as it's a plotline which is told in neither a linear or non-linear fashion, but in reverse chronological order, however even beyond that (if you followed it) there's so much more beyond the confines of what we do see and hear, that it leads to an incredibly complex and wonderfully intricate story.

If you only watch it once and understand it completely you're a genius because it's taken me several viewings to get the entire picture. I was also lucky enough to find the ""Easter Egg"" (possibly the best Easter Egg on any DVD ever - if anyone knows of a better one, please let me know) and found that even after watching Memento in chronological order, it was still engrossing and deeply intricate.

The special features delve a little deeper into the history of storyline also, giving us some hints and clues as to how Leonard Shelby ended up in the time and place we join him (not to give too much away - but he's an escaped mental patient), and even the special features themselves are cryptic and accessed only through careful examination, analysis and exploration. EVEN THEN, there's a great deal of symbolism (torn out newspaper clippings in the shape of America, references to the nihilistic nature of a life lived without cognisance of actions etc.)

It's clear that writer/director Christopher Nolan invested a lot in this, creating a story that can be disregarded as `decent' or explored as magnificent in its dimensions.

Top marks, and some of the best special features on a DVD, but I can also see how some people wouldn't enjoy it simply because it's not mindless enough.

1324867,5,B00003CXZ3,"Director Christopher Nolan was unknown in 1996 as he took a cross-country trip with his brother, Jonathan; who pitched a storyline to him. Christopher loved it and they began to collaborate on the project. Christopher finished his screenplay for a future film before Jonathan finished his short story, which he called MEMENTO MORI. The film did not come to fruition immediately.

Nolan was born in England, and he spent his childhood moving back and forth between the United Kingdom and the States; ending up with dual citizenship. In the middle 90's, he had shot a low budget film in London. It was called FOLLOWING, and it was released in 1998. It was shot in black and white, and it had a fractured non-linear plot line. Simultaneously, Nolan's lady friend, Emma Thomas, was pitching his finished script for MEMENTO. It was considered by the executives who saw it, ""the most innovative script"" that they had seen in ages. It was green-lighted, and given a budget of 4.5 million dollars. It was originally slated to be shot in Montreal, and then the project shifted to Los Angeles. It was said that at Cannes, after the screening of FOLLOWING, in 1998, Nolan gave a pitch to the audience for funding to make MEMENTO. One just has to admire such audacity.

Nolan had felt for a long time that he liked the way commercials and music videos were shot in a non-linear fashion. He also responded to literature presented that way. So he decided to take the methodology, and what he learned on his first feature, refine it and transfer the concept to MEMENTO; creating a wondrous cinematic puzzle of a picture. It certainly is evident that he succeeded beyond his wildest imagination.

MEMENTO raises the curtain showing us the end game, an action that is the result of circumstances we do not yet know, presented in color. Then it jumps to a separate narrative line, what we figure out is a flashback, presented in B&W, with our protagonist, Leonard Shelby waking up in a ""strange"" motel room. That is when we discover, as he talks to someone on the phone, that he suffers from a rare form of amnesia, known as ""anterograde"". ""I know who I am. I just can't form new memories."" When he awakens in that motel room, or in any room, he seems to have to piece together just where he is. Then we are flashed forward to about five minutes ahead of where we left off in the color narrative. Lenny's attention span seems to be about 5 minutes, and each time it begins to fade, we are transported to the B&W storyline shown in what seems chronological order. Odd as it seems, the color narrative is being shown in reverse chronological order; that is to say that the color section is presented in a linear fashion, but each time we return to it, it begins 5 to 10 minutes prior to where we left off, filling in some plot gaps as it approaches the inevitable fade out.

As an audience, we are confused, dazzled, and fascinated as we endeavor the meaning of these two independent parallel timelines. We watch, we make assumptions, we surmise, and as the film comes to what might be closure we realize that the two narratives were not parallel, rather they were moving toward each other, one linear from the past, the other in a tantalizing mind-blowing reverse mode, kind of in the present. Suddenly, following the action in the B&W narrative, the two timelines merge, and the action is transformed to color; with the narrative lunging toward us repeating the opening scene of the movie, becoming an action that is more like in the middle of the plotline. Are we more confused? A little perhaps. The plot threads converge and the ""mystery"" is explained, although it might not be accurately explicated, and in some ways it only deepens as even more options and solutions present themselves.

Guy Pearce as Leonard Shelby was astonishingly good, both a lost soul and a dangerous avenger; a man so logical, so meticulous, so organized that he found a way to circumnavigate his inability ""to form new memories"". As an actor he has never been more physical, more intimidating and lethal, pulsating with pent-up emotion and energy -yet he manages to capture our empathy, and holds our attention, his hopes become ours, his quest our own. With the odd reverse narrative, the director gets us to rediscover time and place much as Lenny has to, as we careen along beside him, off balance, piecing together the plot like manic chimps putting together a puzzle while swinging on a rope; several ropes.

Carrie Ann-Moss as Natalie the bar maid, the gangster's moll, a drug runner, a femme fatale, love interest, abuser, and ten times a bitch -was very effective, creating a character that we can not shake from our senses, emerging as sexy, selfish, and far from innocent. She aspired to be the queen bee, acting as a black widow, shamelessly manipulating all the men in her life; steering toward what she perceived was her big pay off.

Joe Pantoliano, a veteran of putz roles, usually playing shady, vicious, unreliable, and untrustworthy types, leaves shadings of all this in his John ""Teddy"" Gammel, a man who misrepresents himself to Lenny, changes his identity often, and hides his purpose; whatever that might be, from hour to hour, from episode to episode. Yet his role as cop, or ex-cop, crooked and larcenous, comes off as semi-sympathetic -quite a feat for any actor.

This film provokes discussion, after challenging the viewer to stay with it. Director Nolan has created a complex methodology that continues to perplex us, even after multiple viewings. The movie is not easily pigeon-holed or labeled. It requires that we consider the fragility and the ineptness of memory that includes some misrepresentations and implanted data, and is rife with occlusions. MEMENTO has dozens of scenes that change point of view, or particulars of plot, as we experience them; plot elements that surely are in conflict with themselves, perhaps even some teasing red herring moments. I feel that director Nolan intentionally played games with us, as his later suggestions of multiple endings, and his complex DVD and websites data are testament to. Regardless, this is a film like no other, an original that is worthy of both its accolades and its criticism.",1199836800,,6228,4.803171641791045

1324871,4,B00003CXZ3,"If you prefer mainstream entertainment, skip this film - and this review - right now.  However, if you revel in strange realities present with artsy cinematography, then Memento may be for you.  Leonard (Guy Pearce) has a ""condition"" that prevents him from creating new memories, and thus he is stuck only with the person he was before his wife's brutal death.  Now, he wakes up every few minutes to a new life organized only by Polaroid pictures, notes scribbled to himself, and a maze of tattoos scrawled over his body.  Leonard believes in facts, not memories, although the viewer soon discovers just how tenuous the relationship between fact and fiction really is.

Although the film begins at what is essentially the end, the progression is as chronologically complex as Leonard's own fractured sense of time.  The vignettes, with scenes repeated and extended, gradually build on one another to give the viewer a fuller sense of what is really happening.  In this way, the characters are plastic, changing according to Leonard's latest understanding of them and then vanishing from his consciousness.  There's Teddy (Joe Pantoliano) and Natalie (Carrie-Ann Moss), two people who seem both friendly and malicious. Like Leonard, we have to learn anew about them in every scene.  These puzzling glimpses begin to assemble into something larger than even Leonard is willing to admit.

While Memento falls into the postmodern realm of filmmaking, with its use of alternate realities and means of communication, it is not as riveting as&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Fight-Club-Widescreen-Edition/dp/B000067J1H/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Fight Club (Widescreen Edition)</a>&nbsp;nor as humorously self-referential as&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Adaptation-Superbit-Collection/dp/B00005JLRE/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Adaptation (Superbit Collection)</a>.

1324926,5,B00003CXZ3,"`Memento' is probably one of the only films that must be watched from beginning to end, no if ands or buts, in order for it to be even enjoyed.  I mean this with all sincerity, if you miss the first thirty seconds you're screwed.  That said, when caught from the very beginning `Memento' is also one of the most enjoyable and richly rewarding films to be watched.  It's a true stunner of a film, from plot to execution, and is one that will instigate lots of post-watching conversations.  The acting is top-notch, especially from the likes of Guy Pearce (looking like a scraggly Brad Pitt covered in interesting tattoos) who just blew me away here.  I've never really been a fan of Pearce.  In `L.A. Confidential' I felt he was the weakest link and pretty much everything else I see him in I just don't feel him, but here he just soars.  The direction of the film is a thing of beauty really, and Christopher Nolan has pretty much established himself as one of our greatest new-wave directors.  He truly gets into his material and delivers this masterful story in a very unique way which proves to be the grandest embellishment.

The film centers around Leonard Shelby, a man who's lost his wife to rape and murder and in the process lost his mind.  He has set out to find the man who did this and punish him.  The movie opens with him killing a man named Teddy.  This is the end of the film, or I should say the end of the story.  Teddy is, for the sake of discussion, the man who raped and murdered Leonard's wife.  The film them jumps back in ten minute segments until we get to the beginning of the film, or should I say the beginning of the story, where we uncover who Leonard came to this conclusion.  What makes this direction so interesting is that the film gives you just enough information to keep you guessing.  It tells you just a little bit and then takes you back and fills you in, leaving new doors open for interpretation before taking you back again and filling you in.  It's truly a masterpiece of a film and executed so well it's a real shame the academy snubbed Nolan his directing nomination.

Like I mentioned, Pearce is a spectacle in this film, but there are two other performances within `Memento' that deserve attention.  For one we have Carrie-Anne Moss' who plays a barmaid who is helping Leonard for reasons yet to be uncovered.  Is she really concerned with Leonard's plight or is she using him for her own selfish gain?  Moss surprised me here because I'm really not familiar with her work aside from `The Matrix' and a film like `The Matrix' doesn't really allow the actors to shine, but here she delves into the meat of her character and delivers a great performance.  The real star though, the actor that outshines them all, is Joe Pantoliano of `The Sopranos' fame (yes, that's Ralph).  As Teddy Joe is spot on and delivers an exciting, fresh and completely absorbing performance.  It's funny because my wife and I are HUGE `Sopranos' buffs and when we saw `Ralph' we just about died (since his character was one we loathed from start to his finish) but here he completely sheds his `Sopranos' persona and delivers a separate performance altogether and it paid off wonderfully for him.

`Memento' is a film for the ages.  It's one of those movies that may not be your cup of tea, and for that I understand, but really, there isn't much to dislike with this film (that is if you catch it from the start).  There are so many films where one is advised to sit back and turn your mind off but here I'm telling you to sit up and turn your mind on because `Memento' is the type of film that will keep you thinking, keep you guessing, and in the process keep you completely entertained.  The end, or should I say the beginning, plays out in a wonderfully inventive way that is unexpected yet ultimately rewarding.  It packs a huge `wow' factor and I just love that about this film.  I don't want to say too much because I don't want to spoilt he surprise, but just be aware that it's not what you'd expect, and that's a beautiful thing!",1189900800,4,4064,4.460081190798376

Why?  It's not only one of the most original movies in a long time.  It's one of the best movies of the 2000's.

Memento is the story of a man trying to find out who killed his wife, although he has more obstacles to face than your average revenge character does.  He has a problem with his memory.  He can't make new memories and can't retain anything for too long of a time.

This movie is extremely engaging.  You don't want to miss a single moment of this film.  It's quite good too.  The story, although it seems to be told backwards, is actually told in a different non-linear way.  It jumps from place to place, although it's still easy to follow.  This isn't your normal blockbuster entertainment flick.  It's deep.

The Limited Edition DVD release is one of the best releases of all time.  It is loaded to the brim with special features.  Includind an excellent audio commentary from Christopher Nolan, plenty of features, a trailer, making of featurettes, and some amazing hidden features including a chance to watch the movie chronologically.  I haven't yet tried this but it's definitely worth it to better understand the entire movie.

1324997,5,B00003CXZ3,"Every so often, there's a movie where the hero has amnesia.  Even with amnesia, a person can establish an identity in a few weeks, judge new people and surroundings, and function.  In addition, such movie heroes are easy to identify with, because the audience seems to know as much as the hero.

Well, in this movie, our hero has the opposite problem, an inability to make new memories.  And that kind of problem is indeed rare, and it merits some discussion.

What would you do if you couldn't form new memories?  Well, you would probably be institutionalized, or cared for by family or friends.  Without that, it would be important to be in familiar surroundings as much as possible, ones you would remember.  You would remember your old house, your old car, and, of course, your old acquaintances.  But you would not remember new possessions or friends.  And you would be totally lost in a new town, while in your old one, you would know where your friends' houses were, where your bank was, where the restaurants were, and so on.

You would need to avoid strangers.  And you would need a way to take notes, read and understand those notes, and keep a rough diary.  Probably you would need to trust a few friends to keep a few key documents and help you update them occasionally.  And you would also need a safety deposit box for notes, diary entries, money (even with a bank account, a safety deposit box would be very useful), and so forth.

The key problems would be taking notes, figuring out how to make sure you could and would read and understand those notes, going on ""missions"" (even a short errand would be a major event), and keeping your privacy.

For any important task, you would almost surely need to be backed up by a trusted friend, known by you from back when you were able to make memories.  That friend would need to be with you at such occasions or as a minimum constantly available by phone.

You could write cryptic notes that only you could decipher, using your earlier memories.  But it would be hard to be sure just what secrets you had divulged.  Basically, you could keep your ideas private only by making sure nobody else saw them.  And that would be tricky.  That's one more place where a safety deposit box could help somewhat.

I'm writing all this in order to explain just how weird the situation is for our hero in this movie, who is basically, um, ""open loop,"" and cut off from almost everything that is familiar.  It's a fascinating and suspenseful movie, but one can see that the hero is at a tremendous disadvantage.

On the other hand, there are some things the hero knows quite well, and that makes the movie work.  Rather than offer a spoiler, let me just say that I highly recommend it.",1179792000,,2731,4.533742331288344

And though I bought this DVD when it was released and had watched it twice (which is the minimum number of recommended viewings for this film), it's just collected dust for five years and I hadn't returned to it since.

Aptly enough, I had forgotten much of it, making much of Memento seem newly fresh yet oddly familiar, much like most of its main character Leonard's daily doings.  Leonard, as we pretty much all know by now, is trying to get revenge for the killing of his wife, which is made somewhat more challenging (to say the least) by the fact that he suffers from extreme short-term memory loss and can't remember any more than ten minutes at a time.  As Leonard himself will tell almost anyone he meets: ""I can't make new memories - everything fades.""

All of which would in itself make for an interesting movie.  But what makes this film truly ingenious is the way it is constructed and edited.  You know, one of my dearly-departed favorite author Kurt Vonnegut's Eight Rules for Writing Fiction is: ""start as close to the end as possible.""  Well, Memento takes this rule - written by one of the ultimate storytellers - and pushes it to its extreme, actually starting AT the end and then working backwards - which makes for one of the all-time greatest stories.

Now, a lot of movies that are assembled in this kind of non-linear time-jumpy kind of way are gimmicky to a fault, and confusing for no good reason.  But in Memento, this style of editing actually serves the story and makes it better, because - by showing us Leonard's perpetually-perplexing world out of sequence - it forces us to experience the movie in the same disoriented way that Leonard experiences the world.  So as Leonard puzzles his way through his life, so do we.  This makes us empathize and connect with the film's central character in a way few other movies have ever been able to achieve before or since (whichever way you happen to travel through time in your search).  Of course, the fact the Guy Pearce's performance is so riveting helps us enormously with our empathy as well.

Anyway, there are about a thousand (or so) other reviews here that will tell you more about what happens in the movie, but I think that this story - more than most - relies on the surprise that each new/past detail reveals, so I don't want to ruin any of this film's revelations if you are lucky enough to be contemplating seeing this movie for the first time.

And if you are considering watching this picture for the first time (or even if you've already seen it), I would definitely encourage you to buy this DVD.  Because the great thing about owning a movie like Memento, as my experience will attest, is that it rewards multiple viewings.  And the depth and the detail (in addition to the design) of the film ensure that each viewing is made fresh with new insight and understanding.

In the end, Memento is so much more than just a non-linear, well-crafted crime thriller.  It's also an exploration of what makes up a person's identity, and an examination of the malleability of experience.  Ultimately, Memento shows us how all our memories are fallible, and - to some degree - we all have to use devices like Leonard uses to remember things: whether it's jotting down phone numbers, taking pictures on our vacations, or (in my case just now) watching a DVD to remind you of all the things you loved about a movie in the first place.",1176508800,11,3703,4.63302752293578

1325102,5,B00003CXZ3,"***SPOILERS***

Finishing watching this for the 5th or 6th time today, I learned yet another piece to the puzzle of this movie which put it together in a way that blew me away as much as the first time I watched it.

I can go in depth into the reviews and how good the movie is, but that's been done already to death.  I'll explain to you still confused how this movie works, starting from the true beginning

- All the black-and-white scenes come before the movie... Leonard is already on his journey attempting to find John G. and being lead by Officer Gammell on the phone (Teddy).  He finally finds the ""John G."" guy, a drug dealer called Jimmy Grant, and kills him.  It's revealed now that Teddy has already helped Leonard find the killer of his wife the year before, but since then he has only been using Leonard's condition and his need for vengeance for his own shady means---he set up Jimmy the drug dealer by pretending to have $200,000 worth of methamphetamines for sale, and planning to steal the money for himself.

- Leonard realizes Teddy's plan, and distracts Teddy by throwing his keys in a bush, then he decides that if Teddy is going to be making him chase around John G.'s or James G.'s as long as possible for his own benefit, he's going to chase his own John G.... Teddy himself.  So he writes himself clues about Teddy, by writing ""Don't believe his lies"" on the back of his photo, and tattooing his license plate number on his body.  Thus Leonard is plotting revenge again, but not against his wife's murderer as he thinks, but against the guy who's been using him to kill people.

- Thus the color scenes begin (unveiled in reverse in the movie) in which Leonard is trying to follow the clues to John G.  Teddy (the John G. Leonard is after) is trying his hardest to throw Leonard off course, and to get him to give up.  He then encounters Natalie, and she finds out that Teddy was involved in her boyfriend (Jimmy Grant, the drug dealer)'s death, and attempts to use Leonard to try and kill Teddy.  She doesn't realize he is already attempting to ""find"" him and kill him, as he set himself on this course to begin with (before losing his memory at that moment)

- There must be some sort of ability for Leonard to remember things and his memory distorts these things the way he thinks it.  The big clue to this is when he tells Teddy that ""memory can change the color of a car, it can change the shape of a room"" and concludes with the true beginning, when Teddy reveals to him that there IS no ""Sammy Jankis"" as he thinks... the character he's been talking about throughout the movie was a fraud, and had no wife, whereas the story of his disillusioned wife was actually Leonard's wife, and that Sammy was actually Leonard.

Really this was truly a unique film, and spellbinding.  It's so complex, you can't watch it only once.  You learn something new with every viewing.

And the film also has a very very dark, grim aspect about it.  Aside from the fact that he can never live a normal life again, he can't trust anything or anyone, and he doesn't even realize he's a murderer, and will never remember that it was he who set himself against Teddy after learning that Teddy had been using him for his own selfish purposes.",1165622400,5,3251,4.431932773109244
1325103,5,B00003CXZ3,It is fun to watch this movie scene by scene backwards: starting from the last scene to the first.,1163030400,,98,4.2105263157894735
1325104,5,B00003CXZ3,"I watched the entire movie with my mouth open, glued to the screen. (Well, almost :) ). I have never before, and not afterwards, found a movie that was quite as good as this one in terms of captivation, plot, and the idea. The story sucks you in, and your brain is working the entire movie trying to figure out exactly what's going on. On my first take, I didn't quite get the outcome, so it took me some time and watching it again to really figure it out. Since the first viewing, I've watched the movie many times and, suprisingly, found something new every time. And I still watch it with the same feeling of suspense and interest. There are so many different ideas presented in the movie -- about the inconsistency of ""reality"", about being used in others plans, about knowing who you are... This movie is truly a genius production, a masterpiece.

The basic plot is about a guy who has an amnesia-like disability, where he does not remember immediate past events. The story progress backwards (!) from the end, and this technique makes you see the main character's predicament and frustration with not being able to remember or understand what's happening to him. (Except we, as the viewer, are able to see the 'future' and know what will happen to him next!)

I thought the actors were great, the director did a great job and, to quit raving about this movie, I have to say that it's simply SUPERB. Watch it and you won't be dissapointed.",1160697600,16,1444,4.55
1325105,5,B00003CXZ3,"""Memento"" eclipses everything which preceded it, and set the bar so high it may never be topped.  And all for $5 million in production costs.

Director Nolan does a remarkable job of juggling the complex plot elements, but sabotages himself with some of his rather ordinary visual schemes.  I refer you to the diner sequence in which characters portrayed by Guy Pearce and Joe Pantoliano converse over soup.  Given that the film was shot in Panavision's 2.35:1 anamorphic process, the scene would have played more effectively if Nolan had simply planted his camera for a medium shot of two skillful actors as they provided plot exposition.  Instead, Nolan intercuts between close ups of the two, which is a method more typical of and appropriate for the narrower aspect ratio of television.  Close ups work best when used judiciously and to provide emphasis.

I mention this only because this is how detailed I have to go in order to find fault with the film.  If I didn't know better I would swear that Pearce is an American actor--his accent is that authentic.  All of the performances are convincing and it's always fun to see ""Eve 6"" (Harriet Sansom Harris) from that great ""X-Files"" episode.

This film is proof of the morally bankrupt notion that movies have to cost $200 miilion or more.  I am SICK of ugly, witless, loud blockbusters which are polluting pop culture.  If the choice is to spend that sort of money making a movie...or allow the movie to go unmade...

1325162,5,B00003CXZ3,"Directed by Christopher Nolan, ""Memento"" is a Masterpiece of suspense. I highly recommend this film to all viewers. As the films narrative begins, we find the films main protagonist, Leonard Shelby (Guy Pearce) as a man who suffers from a rare brain disorder caused by trauma. Leonard is unable to remember recent events that occur, and as a result, he must write down everything. Even going so far as to have tattoos on his body to remember the most important evidence which will help him find the man who killed his wife. Furthermore, he even takes photos of people to help him remember who they are. However, there is more to Leonard than we are led to believe, and I do not wish to divulge this information. Leonard has begun his search of the killer by relying on the tattoos on his body, and photographs that he keeps in his pocket--for if he does not, then 10 minutes later he will forget everything.

Furthermore, even though Leonard is suffering from a loss of memory, and unable to remember events that occur, he is tormented by the death of his wife--and is relentless in his pursuit of the killer. He was a former insurance agent who one night was attacked in his home. With his wife murdered, while he was left for dead, the injuries caused are rare brain disorder which has left him frustrated in trying to uncover the truth. Moving along with the narrative, we see Leonard as an insurance investigator prior to his attack. He was responsible for uncovering fraudulent claims. And interspersed within the films narrative of Leonard's memory loss, we see him as a man who has denied the same claim by a man named Sammy (Stephen Tobolowsky). He denied the claim on the justification that the man was faking his illness in order to collect money. And Sammy's story is important to the film.

Leonard's attempts in trying to track down the man who raped and murdered his wife is difficult. The problem is not only that Leonard has short-term memory loss due to a blow to his head when his wife was attacked, but moreover, who can he trust? Enter another protagonist in this film, Teddy Gammell (Joe Pantoliano). Can Leonard trust him? And what does Teddy know about Leonard that he is not telling him? The interesting part of this film is that it begins at the end and then proceeds backwards in reverse chronological order. Teddy's character is very important in the film, and where Teddy's loyalties are, leave the viewer in suspense. The entire film is a Masterpiece in script-writing, and it is thoroughly worth the watch. I highly recommend this film to all viewers. [Stars: 5+++]",1156118400,4,2595,4.68859649122807

He can only remember things for about 10 minutes and then everything fades so he has to take pictures of things he needs/wants to remember and for the important things, he has them tattooed on his own body.  He is trying to find the guy who raped and murdered his wife and you are shown a lovely picture at the beginning of the movie that shows a picture (won't say too much to ruin things for readers of this review who have not seen the movie and are interested) of Teddy shot in the head, but you don't know why this happened and the movie begins its sequences of going backwards in 10-12 minute sequences then moving into no-color sequences where Lenard talks more about his condition.

This powerful and challenging Noir has to do with a simple question: what about you or me if suddenly the lights of the memory simply turn off? What if your capacity to remember is no longer than five minutes?

The dramatic and awful premise: a horrid murder and a serious cerebral damage will make your name still persists but your entire life since that moment will be a total mess, a complicated puzzle of photographs, annotations, addresses, footnotes, faces, false names are the lost fragments product of a bloody explosion, that has caused a true virulent disorder of the vital synapses, reduced to occasional flashes.

A man without memory will become a desperate man; he needs to belong a country, be part of a community, for love and be loved and so nourish his imagination,  to expand his intelligence and so  to learn and grow up. On the other hand a man with just a memory becomes a modern Faust.

1325171,5,B00003CXZ3,"First of all, I own the 3-disc english import so I can't really review this edition when it comes to features, but I can tell you what the movie is like and about.

This film is directed by the british director Christopher Nolan, who also directed the brilliant come back of batman in the batman franchise title ""Batman Begins"". Memento is Nolan's second film and is the first film in cinema history to be told backwards. This film is based on his brother's (at that time) unpublished short story he was telling him on a trip to chicago. Although not an exact adaptation of the story, it is based on the ideas and backdrop of the short story.

Guy Pearce play's the poor soul Leanard Shelby, who has a condition he suffers that is bassicly short term memory loss. So in other words he doesn't have the ability to create new memories. The only reason why lenny is still living is his desire to revenge his murdered whife's death, which is the only thing he can remember last, his wife dying. Due to his condition he has to make notes of the clues to finding his wifes murderer and rapist. All the clues to his wifes killer are tattood on his body, and all things he needs to know are on pollaroid photo's that tell him where he's staying and who's helping him get his revenge. The film bassicly starts from the end and works it's way to the beggining which is the end of the film. I don't want to spoil anymore of the movie so it is up to you to figure the clues out.

This film should've taken home the oscars for best screenplay and editing for very good reasons, Christopher Nolan had to start with the end and work his way backwards, same goes for the editing. The performances are very good and exciting to watch, but the stand out is definately Guy Pearce's tough role as the the man with a condition he's still holding onto. If you're a fan of Film Noir I highly reccomend this one, but even if you're not this is one to give a shot.

Basically, the movie plays backwards, in bits and pieces.  The story is a of a man with no ability to form new memories who is nevertheless obsessed with seeking revenge against the killers of his wife.  And all the screwups he makes as a result.

As the story unwinds and we find out more and more of the stories of the various people flashing through the life of this man, we also find out that EVERYBODY in the movie is a bad guy/gal, except perhaps the murdered wife.  And so at the end of the movie, there is simply this empty feeling of disaffection for all of the characters and the movie as a whole.

For one thing, there are no big-name stars (Carrie-Anne Moss from the _Matrix_ movies is as close you come) so you can concentrate on the story, and on the confusion that inevitably strikes the first-time viewer.

And, as with _Pulp Fiction,_ _Mulholland Drive,_ and a few other recent non-linear films, you'll enjoy this one more as you re-watch it.",1138320000,,958,4.8121212121212125

To swoon on, I think it's the BEST moviescript EVER written. I see Memento as a perfect circle; you can join the story at any given point and it would make structual sense. But at the same time you can join the story at any given point and it would still leave you with lots of questions of what happened before, what happened after and what is the actual TRUTH. The more you watch the movie the more answers you will have, but at the same time still more questions will arise. Isnt that what we ask of a movie - to keep us entertained after multiple viewings? If ever aliens visited earth and wanted  samples of our movie industry, I would be sure to include MEMENTO as one of the prime examples of human achievement.

Memento begins with ""an"" answer. It may not be ""the"" answer and from their the viewer must figure things out backwards. It is very disconcerting and difficult to watch. It is not a movie you can see the first time and just relax, maybe missing a scene here or there...every scene is important...every answer will lead to a question.

I say watch this twice because at the end of your first viewing you will understand what happened but perhaps not really ""get"" all of the details that explain the series of events (that you just watched backwards). Viewing the film a second time is easier because you have an understanding of what will happen next (or do I mean before) and can therefore pick up a lot of the subtle's you may have missed first time around.",1136073600,3,890,4.487654320987654

Cast:  Guy Pearce, Carrie-Anne Moss, Joe Pantoliano, Mark Boone Junior, Russ Fega, Jorja Fox, Stephen Tobolowsky, Harriet Sansom Harris.

Running Time:  113 minutes

Rated R for violence, language and some drug content.

There are a lot of excellent movies whose scripts rewrote the rules of cinematic storytelling (the Oscar-winning ""The Usual Suspects"" and ""Pulp Fiction"" are two good examples).  ""Memento"" deserves a place among those films: it's the most complex, original, innovative, intriguing achievement to hit the big screen in a while.  ""Memento"" looks like an ordinary film noir, having all the conventional elements (femme fatale, unreliable characters, ambiguous protagonist/narrator, bleak ending), until is fatally strikes you with its originality and audacity, making you unable to stop watching.  Director Christopher Nolan manages to pull off a rare feat in the film business these days by taking the entire industry by storm with his incredible intelligent, disjointed thriller ""Memento"".  While many films have since tried to imitate its taut script and superb execuation, it remains one fo the most unique and thought-provoking pieces of the past decade.

From the beginning you realize you're not watching the usual thriller: the reversed opening sequence is a fascinating narrative choice, and even more fascinating is the director's decision to tell the whole story backwards, with each separate scene ending where the previous one began. Thanks to this trick, the audience is as confused as the movie's main character, Leonard Shelby (Guy Pearce), a peculiar DIY detective who wants to find the bloke who raped and killed his wife (CSI's Jorja Fox). While attempting to save his wife during the attack, ""Lenny"" sustained a head injury and has lost his short-term memory, so every new event is gone from his mind after 10 minutes. He has to go on with his life by taking notes, snapping Polaroids and putting tattoos all over his body. He also gets some valuable help from a cop, ""Teddy"" (Joe Pantoliano), and a barmaid, Natalie (Carrie-Anne Moss). But should he really trust them, given he can't almost even trust himself due to his neurological condition.  Nolan (who screenwrote the film as well) knows how to build up the tension, as well as add emotion, with the touching parallel story of Sammy Jankis (Stephen Tobolowsky), a man with the same disease as Leonard.

Both Pearce and Tobolowsky are superb as the two troubled men: the former makes you feel as uneasy as he does almost immediately, and he's got some really ace lines (""How am I supposed to heal if I can't feel time?""); the latter, on the other hand, is heartbreaking, his experiences make us wanna cry before the film's over. Pantoliano and Moss are very impressive too, their true intentions remaining unclear until the end.  Nolan beautifully intertwines the present and the past, linking events together like a detective putting all the clues together until the thief is found.  While ""Memento"" is thoroughly composed with its intertwining plot, the film's great strength can also be considered it potential flaw. The confusion that is inevitable can make it difficult for some to follow, especially for those who are used to a film flowing over them in a passive way. Memento requires you to exercise your brain and even when it is all over certain questions will still remain and further viewing is essential.  Of course, the central paradox of the film should not be forgotten, this is a revenge story but of course the character has now way of remembering the actual crime, his memory is gone and the memory of the act of revenge will also be a fleeting one.  Nolan's story and the ensemble cast's acting are outstanding, but a mention also has to go to the cinematography and soundtrack that both helped greatly to create the oppressive mood that pervaded throughout he film and is essential to generate the sense of fragility that exists in Leonard's connection to the world.  An intelligent, profound, and supreme addition to the genre.  One of the best films of the decade thus far.",1135814400,2,4118,5.072592592592593

I picked this topic to speak on when I remembered laughing at myself the night my film class and I watched Memento, a movie based on Memento Mori, the name of the short story.  I turned up my car music, left the place, and headed the wrong direction on the highway, ""idiot!""  I was so used to going to my friend's house; my car just automatically steered me into going the opposite direction of my home.  He wouldn't be available that week, and I knew this because I had just spoken with him by cell phone before getting into my car.  Yet, I'm not so sure I have no explanation.  After watching Memento, I realized the satire of going through motions that have no memory.  I laughed out loud, alone, and in my car when I realized the occasion.

I remember Leonard Shelby.  He is the main character of Memento.  Leonard Shelby had a memory dysfunction.  I don't suppose I acted much differently than Leonard Shelby.  Leonard Shelby escaped an asylum!  Memento is the story of a guy that can have a conversation with someone and, by the end of it, did not know what was said at the beginning of it.  By the time he got done with the movie, he was quite a unique individual.  His actions were attributable to a memory dysfunction.

Movie critics are important to movies.  They make important decisions in front of viewers or readers everywhere.  They affect a film's interpretation.  They are so engaging, they occasionally get to be Roger Ebert and Leonard Maltin.

Some people prefer to remember the instances they choose, like when a wife receives insulin.  She must be diabetic.  Some create the likeness of something that isn't really there by filling in the blanks.  ""The best jigsaw puzzles are the ones with a few pieces missing.""

All anyone has to do is tell a good story.  That is all people really want to hear.  If I can do that, I am doing my job.  This makes me necessary.

Getting people to assume the untrue makes sense.  One can better understand this when realizing their wants and needs which may have nothing to do with reality.  People have a motivation that's in the subconscious mind, and people understand by drawing conclusions in places where there are no real explanations.  The reason to watch this movie is to believe what happens is the truth.  It doesn't matter if it's just a movie, because everyone knows that, anyway.

I bought the movie because I'm a good student to my college course.  I wanted to make a sensible statement when my instructor asked for one from me.

The order in which I put my story is important to the theme.  For instance, when Leonard Shelby's mental state takes advantage of his physical state, he doesn't know a method for how to act.  It bothers him greatly to know his wife is gone.  So like his kind of mental patients, the largest contributing factor is repetition.  After all, when he found my diary, he thought it was his.  Keeping two diaries is not easy.  Look, I just have a memory problem.  Leonard Shelby was in an institution.  He deliberately put himself there.  Of course, he'd know if he did.  I drive a BMW.  Where's the straight jacket.

Wait!  The beginning is the end.  It is the reason I see the centrifugal point of this valuable illness.

Sammy Jenkins?  He killed his wife.  That'll never happen to Leonard because he developed a special system.  I know that for sure.  He may suffer from a memory dysfunction, but he can't reverse the past.  No one controls the past.  The past makes no difference, here.

1325251,5,B00003CXZ3,"The clever thing about the order this movie is presented, it puts you in the same mindset with the main character: you don't know whats going on, your just popped into a situation like he is, reading messages off his body, trying to figure it out with him as you go.

This not only is effective for that reason, but it makes the second and third and fourth viewings more interesting because you can then 'begin' to piece it all together

I watched it in reverse order (chronologically) by starting on the last chapter then scanning backward as I finished each one.  ThaT took alot of concentration and i messed it up alot but i got the main idea and its much better watched like it was meant to be, but thats a fun project to pursue later if you have patience...see this movie keeps giving long after other ones are forgotten on a shelf!

Guy Pearce is one of those characters I find extremely watchable.  I don't know what it is but I think it has to do with his face and voice, like an intriquing quality. Weird thing is I think I would like the feeling of punching his face, especially if he's wearing glasses like in la confidential, so for some reason I think it would feel good to punch through the glasses into his face. He just has that kind of face but I really like the actor Guy Pearce don't get me wrong, its just a punchable face thats all, like it would be satisfying to do so",1132358400,2,1390,4.269961977186312

1325254,5,B00003CXZ3,"'Memento' is a film that I approached skeptically.  I'd heard nothing but good things, pretty much, but it sounded gimmicky, and like precisely the sort of slightly arty, slightly innovative film that stupid people and mainstream critics will see and proclaim it genius, and, worse yet, somehow imagine that their love of this film make them smart. (I'm no indie/intellectual film snob, mind you, but I can usually spot a sacred cow from quite a distance)  And I suppose I was right, partially, as looking at the review for this it's apparent that more than a few dummards are claiming 'Memento' to be the greatest, most original film ever.  And, yeah, they don't know what the hell they're talking about, but they manage to be almost right anyway.  Still, on top of being a first-rate thriller (well, more or less a thriller anyway.) 'Memento' has got a real human interest angle, and prods into some ideas with regards to reality and perception.(It may not be incredibly revelatory, but few films inspire the mind at all.)

I suppose I should summarize the basic plot: Leonard Shelby is on a quest to avenge his murdered wife.  Unfortunately, during the attack he was injured, and can no longer make new memories.  Thus, he's got grope through the present, with only notes and tattoos and instinct to guide him towards his goal.  As you would imagine, this can get pretty damn complicated.  Personally, I don't think the whole backwards chronology gimmick is all that hot of an idea, in and of itself, and it's certainly not original to this film.  Of course, Nolan redeems it through the second conceit, which is that Leonard, has no short-term memory, thus placing us in his shoes, as much as is possible via the reverse chronology. (i.e. he doesn't know what happened in the previous scene, chronologically and neither do we.)  Normally, this would just be a cheap gimmick, an easy way for the director/writer to keep us in the dark, and create cheap, obvious ironies, but now there's actually a legitimate, defensible reason for presenting the film this way.

It would be inappropriate to discuss plot details, though suffice to say that the other characters in the film well understand how easy it would be to manipulate a person with no memory.  Still, clever and intriguing as the plot is, the character of Leonard is perhaps the most interesting part of the film.  Personally, I find him to be a great, tragic and highly sympathetic figure.  He's particularly compelling to me, as I find revenge to be a rather romantic notion.  I'm sure many will disagree with me, and say that it's meaningless, but that's precisely the point.  This is heightened by the fact that Leonard will never know if he gets his revenge, not inside anyway.  But, the principle of the thing is enough to drive him.  Of course, we eventually learn that not everything is the way it appears, but this only undermines it all slightly, as there is still abundant reason why he should want to kill John G.  And, Leonard's condition is so hopelessly screwed up and existentially twisted that you can't help but feel for him.  Living completely in a void is a scary thing, and the film helps you  really reflect on these things in a way you probably haven't before.

Performances are all excellent, though special note goes, again, to Guy Pearce as Leonard.  He's in a really complicated spot, as there really no guidebook for how to play this role, as he's got to continually be in a sorta semi-confused state, reacting to a scene as he perceives he should, but not really feeling why. (or vice versa)  Nolan's direction is stylish and sharp, though it doesn't draw as much attention to itself as it might have, which is probably a good thing.  The score is effective too, lotsa low-key, pulsing stuff, but still charged with emotion.

Yeah, it's a great movie.  Clever plot + emotional resonance.  Usually you only get one, if that.

This movie redefines  psychological thriller. It makes you think. Leonard is a man with a short term memory disorder. Not to bad right? So what? He can still live. He remembers things from  before the ""accident"". Right? Well....not really. Since he has short term memory he can't remember things for at least 5 mins. before he forgets what just happened. Without giving to much of this great and sometimes confusing story, i will now tell some of it. Because of his condition he can't remember things *you know this already....* but he now wants to find his wifes killer. When the ""accident"" happened. His wife was killed in the accident that made him get short term memory. He now is seeking vengence. To remember things he  stays organized and keeps notes. He even had some of them on hid bodhy, as tattos.  He is seeking a guy named John G., his friend Teddy is helping him find her. Along the way Leonard runs into a woman, Natalie, who helps him out of pity. What is most amazing about this story is 1) the way it is presented, they start from the end and work to the begginging. No movie has done that before, and this movie has done it very well. 2) All the ways people translate what happens, many people translate the endding *or should i say...begginging* differently, which makes this movie a very interesting discussion. It drives deep into the human pshyic, and shows  us things we simply cannot accept.  An amazing movie, with some of the best acting I have ever seen. You have not lived, or seen a good movie till you see this. What i think is sad is that Guy Preace was never recognized for this performace. Because it is so well done. I'm about one of the only people in  my town *very big town....*...or in my state probably that has ever even seen or heard of this wonderful movie.

1325303,4,B00003CXZ3,"Christopher Nolan's ""Memento"" is a revenge story told backwards from the end to the beginning.  Our main character, Leanard(Guy Pearce) lost his short term memory one night, when two unidentified bandits invaded his home and allegedly killed his wife.  Leonard managed to gun down one of the bandits, but was pushed into a mirror by the other, knocking him out and taking away his capability to form new memories.  His motive is simple:  Find and kill his wife's killer.

When we first meet Leonard, he is well aware of his condition and knows pretty well how to deal with it---or so we think.  He is constantly on the look out for those that might want to take advantage of him and is not trusting of anyone.  He takes pictures of place, people and thing and jots down notes on them to jog his memory.

The first scene in the film is Leornard gunning down the man whom he is hunting for the rest of the film.  The rest of the movie goes backwards, explaining how Leonard came to the conclusion that the man he shoots at the start, was the second bandit involved in his wife's murder.

This movie is exceptionally well shot on film and very captivating.  This is a completly original concept, at least as far as I have ever seen and engages the viewer's full attention.  The ending is sinister and makes the viewer change the enttire perception of Leonard.  You feel total pity for the man throughout the whole film and during just the last five minutes of the film, everything changes.(I don't want to go into detail, as to not spoil this for the first-time viewers.)

Joe Pantalioni is perfect for the role of 'Teddy' a ""friend"" of Leonard's and is very convincing as the overly-annoying ""nice"" guy.

This film is well worth purchasing, as it will take a viewing or two to fully understand, appreciate and get used to the way this story is told.

The basic premise of the film is a narrative as told from the perspective of the main character, Leonard (played by Guy Pearce) who is an insurance claims investigator. Due to a recent ""incident"" in which his wife is murdered, Leonard has lost the ability to retain any new memories. Older memories, however, are apparently left intact.

Throughout the entire movie Leonard struggles to find his wife's killer from within his tragic new reality. He does this moment by moment, desperately keeping scribbled notes to himself which are hastily written on hordes of post-it notes and Polaroid pictures. These notes are pasted all over his sleazy hotel room and clues he deems very important are actually tatooed to any bare spot he can find on his body.

There is a juicy twist, however. The entire story is told in reverse as a series of vignettes where Leonard recalls his past and interacts with the various seedy characters surrounding him. Each character has their own agenda, however, it isn't clear who Leonard can trust and who is playing him for their own ends. The other main characters are the crooked cop well played by Joe Pantolano, Carrie-Anne Moss as the scheming opportunist bartender Natalie, and a few local drug dealers and other miscreants. The coolest thing about this method of storytelling is that it really adds a desperate, almost schizophrenic tone to the viewing experience. This mirrors Leonard's own world and draws you into the character.

If you like being spoon fed the summer blockbuster type fare, maybe you should rent this first. This movie will challenge you as you will be confused through most of your first viewing.

This movie might make you feel like tearing your hair out if you don't pay attention to something. Now, for the plot. The movie centers around Leonard, a man that has no short term memory. After he was hit in the head while trying to save his wife who got raped and murdered, he lost his ability to retain new memories. While he can remember everything up to the incident, everything since after around 15 minutes is impossible for him to remember. Leonard thus thinks that everyone is a stranger to him. He takes polaroid pictures of everyone that he has met and writes their name and information that he should retain about them from a past encounter. (if they're a liar, etc..) He also must take pictures of his car, and Inn where he stays. Lenny's goal is to kill the man who raped and murdered his wife. He's got one big gun and will do anything to find this man. He gets assistance from a cop and a good friend. But, he doesn't know who he can trust and life gets very hectic for him. The movie is told in reverse chronological order, going from the end until the start. Not until the very end (start...) of the movie will you understand everything.

The ending is very unpredictable and excellent. The movie is a masterpiece as I have said because it's so original. The acting is great notably by Joe Pantoliano. After watching this one, believe me, you'll want to rewatch it over and over to be able to understand everything.",1119657600,2,1935,4.348066298342541

1325312,3,B00003CXZ3,"As most reviews mention, this film basically runs backwards - it's divided into 5-15 minute scenes, each scene ending where the previous scene started.  We meet the hero of the film, Leonard (Guy Pearce, in another great acting job) just as he has murdered a man named Teddy.  So we know what happened (Teddy is murdered), but we don't know why.  It turns out Leonard has brain damage and cannot make new long-term memories.  He can, however, condition himself (in a classical, Pavlovian sense), and so he writes notes to himself, takes pictures, and prints tatoos on his body to keep his life and quest straight.  The quest? - finding and killing the man who murdered his wife.  The first scene implies that Teddy must have been the murderer.  But is he, or is Leonard being set up by someone and can't remember it?  This is the crux of the question that is answered as we learn how Teddy came to be murdered.

The gimmick - playing scenes in reverse order (but the scenes themselves play forward) - is essential for the enjoyment of the film.  First, it puts us squarely in the shoes of the protagonist, who always knows what he's doing, but doesn't really know why.  There are many visual clues - scratches on his face (how did they get there?), a picture of a man he's beaten up, a cryptic message on the photo of Teddy - ""Don't believe his lies.""  Second, the story is too straightforward to view in forward order - watching it in order would be no more interesting than a typical episode of Law and Order (much like viewing Pulp Fiction in chronological order).

At this point, I should mention that the film has an unfair reputation of being difficult to follow and of being violent.  The most violent scene is, in fact, the opening credits, which are more violent by a long shot than the rest of the film.  Similarly, the film is not difficult to follow.  Sure, you may not be able to piece together every little detail (the same can be said for most good Film Noir) with just one viewing, but the answer to the question of the first scene - ""why was Teddy killed and did he deserve to be"" - is obviously resolved.

There are two main problems with this DVD edition.  One is with the film: Leonard's memory problem seems to vary with the needs of the plot.  At times he can hold things in his head for a long time, at other times he forgets in the middle of doing something (for example, at one point he is in the process of running and can't remember why, but at another point he manages to gather up a bunch of items, drive to a deserted lot, and burn them, which must have taken quite some time).  This is something you only think about anfterwards, though, so it does not detract from the film.  The second problem, for which I deducted a star (it's really a 4-star film) is the fact that this particular DVD edition is extremely bare-bones.  There is a special edition of Memento, which would be the recommended format for repeated viewings.

All-in-all, though, this is a very enjoyable movie.  It's the type of film that many people will want to own and watch repeatedly to understand all the little nuances of the plot.  That's not to say that the film doesn't hold up to a single viewing - it's very interesting and intriguing, mostly because of the manner in which the film is constructed, but also due to the actors, who do a good job throughout.",1115078400,6,3365,4.450244698205546
1325361,5,B00003CXZ3,"A wonderful film that I almost turned off halfway. I'm glad I didn't, because I really didn't see the ""ending"" of the film coming (it's absolutely not the ""end"" of the story by any means). It was satisfyingly surprising and made me re-think the entire film. If you start getting antsy, just hang tight, things will reveal themselves by the movie's end.

As you probably know by now, the film jumps backwards in 15 minute increments to something that happened before the scene we were just shown. Things you thought were ""truth"" now become questionable and I must add that things that were questionable sometimes are more so as a result of these ""flashbacks"".

(Spoiler below)

From the mix of untrustworthy characters (including a fabulous acting feat by both Carrie Ann-Moss as the woman we're not sure if we want to trust, and Joe Pantoliano as the man we don't know if we can trust) - I was left wondering if the main character really knew what he was doing and if really it was *he* who was the one manipulating people.

1325364,4,B00003CXZ3,"As I left the theater, my mind clouded with all of the images and story of the film, I realized that I had seen a great addition to the film noir canon. I pass the line of people waiting for the next showing.

The film ends and the lights come up. Wow! Wow spelled backwards is still Wow! I get up and leave the packed independent theater.

I have heard a lot of good things about ""Memento"", the new noir film from writer - director Christopher Nolan, and I am not disappointed. Movies like ""Memento"" are perhaps the hardest to write about. I have to be careful to not give away anything. Anything at all. If I do, I will rob a moviegoer of a potential surprise.

Leonard Shelby (Guy Pearce) is in the middle of a mystery. He is trying to find the man who raped and murdered his wife (Gorga Fox). Leonard has a problem that further complicates this mission. The trauma of his wife's death has robbed him of any short-term memory. He can remember who his wife is, how to drive a car, etc., but anything that occurs to create a new memory will be forgotten. Leonard must rely on notes, tattoos on his body and Polaroids of his friends, enemies, places he lives, etc. He can't talk to people for very long, because he will ultimately forget who they are. He can't talk to people on the phone, because he has to see their eyes, a skill he learned as a former insurance investigator. During his investigation, he meets Natalie (Carrie-Ann Moss) and Teddy (Joe Pantoliano), two people that may or may not be his allies.

If ""Memento"" were laid out in a typical chronological fashion, it would be an interesting film with some good performances. Christopher Nolan, the writer and director, decided to tell the film backwards. The first indication of this is the first shot of a Polaroid undeveloping. We see a picture of a man's body in the corner of a deserted room. The hand holding the photo shakes it a few times, it becomes lighter. Shakes it a few more times, and so on, until the picture pops out of the camera. We then see the climax of the film first, shocking us into the film's different reality. As the film rewinds, we see Leonard slowly unraveling the mystery that leads up to the climax and the detours that he takes along the way. Each segment of the story is just a few minutes in length, the length of Leonard's memory. This helps the audience really feel for Leonard's plight. We essentially have the same problem Leonard does. We don't know what happened before, so everything is new to us, just as it is to Leonard. This construction is really brilliant and it is a testament to the skill of Nolan that the film does not seem as gimmicky as I just described it. We quickly buy into the world he has created and it seems natural.

To provide a break from the rewinding story, Nolan inserts an ongoing telephone conversation between Leonard and an unseen caller between each of the short segments. In chronological fashion, Leonard recounts the story of his most important case as an insurance investigator, the case of Sammy Jankis (Stephen Tobolowsky), a man with a very similar case of short-term memory loss, and his wife, Mrs. Jankis (Harriet Sansom Harris). The story of Sammy Jankis provides a very human aspect to the story and allows us to see Leonard as a normal human being. The story also helps us to understand Leonard's plight.

Guy Pearce is simply phenomenal. In each brief segment, he has to start each by figuring our what is going on, trying to figure out if the people around him are helping him or should be avoided. It doesn't sound like the character would allow a lot of time for development or allow the audience time to identify with him, but Pearce makes it happen. Because he is used to the problem, he knows to act quickly. He makes the character work hard throughout to find the source of the mystery. The scenes when he is on the telephone, recounting the story of Sammy Jankis also help to humanize the character. Much of the flashbacks present a different Leonard, providing a nice counterpoint.

Carrie-Ann Moss is very good as the required Noir femme fatale. She has a simply amazing couple of scenes in the middle of the film during which we quickly see who she is, what her role is and how deeply Leonard's problem affects him. She is a very strong character. Joe Pantoliano plays Teddy, Leonard's ally. Leonard plays along with Teddy despite the Polaroid in his pocket labeling Teddy a liar. Teddy is a very complex character who likes to talk and he talks a lot. During his many conversations, he also takes advantage of Leonard's problem.

""Memento"" is a very memorable film, sure to delight you with its twists and turns.

The house lights go down as the last minute stragglers try to find seats.

I read the newspaper, waiting for the film to start.

I buy my ticket very early. I know from the buzz that I need to buy my ticket early. A lot of people will want to see the film tonight.

No I'm not void of any sort of exaggeration so as to speak but the concept seemed cramped up. I waited for the movie to start but somehow it never does. By the time the end was around I looked at my watch facing the unavoidable feeling of being lost. Many say the fact that this movie is so difficult to understand makes it ""exciting"" and ""re-watchable"". I'm not watching this again in any case because I didn't find it worthwhile the first time around. Now This is a film a lot of people would swear by. However , it left me uninspired but ensured about the number of similar films that would prop up in the near future.

Am I over critical? Maybe. I just choose to be so with Memento. I suggest you give this a watch to know for yourself.  There's no review that can actually help you find solid on this movie. Atleast not mine.",1111881600,3,973,4.311475409836065
1325366,5,B00003CXZ3,"I remember not liking this film that much after viewing it in the movie theatre, but that was because I didn't completely understand it. (I also was only about 12 years old). Unfortunately, when it was released on DVD I completely forgot about it, but I luckily chose to purcahse it a few days ago and am glad that I own it. I now appreciate it so much more. Memento, the innovative and intelligent thriller from Christopher Nolan was certainly one of the best films of 2001 and is one of my personal favorites.  Nolan is a gifted director and adapts a  screenplay based on a fascinatingly original short story written by his brother, Johnathan Nolan.
  Guy Pearce plays Leonard Shelby, a man seeking vengeance after his wife is raped and murdered.  Unfortunately, after the incident, he can't remember anything and is unable to create new memories.  The film is very unique for many reasons: great performances all around (especially from Joe Pantoliano as Teddy who just about steals the show from Pearce, also Carrie-Anne Moss who proves that she's more than just a pretty face and action star as Trinity from ""The Matrix"" and turns in a superb performance as Natalie.
  The film is also told in reverse, and starts from the end.  This is not exactly a typical, mainstream film and is probably not for everyone.  Nolan is definetly a talented director, his more conventional follow-up ""Insomnia,"" (2002) was also great.
This is a film you will think about for awhile, it's not an easy film and it might take some time to figure it out.  It's essentially a puzzle.  This film easily rewards repeated viewings.  Memento, is a film-noir classic.  Nolan is moving
into different territory though with his next film, the highly anticipated ""Batman Begins.""  That should most definetly be promising.  I own the regular edition of this film, which is fairly weak, so I suggest purchasing the delux, 2-disc edition. Overall, in my opinion, this is a film which is worth owning, but if you haven't seen it, definetly rent it.
  Memento is rated R for Violence, Language and Some Drug Content.  The film features very little violence, mainly some gunplay, (some of which is bloody), a few punches here and there and quite a bit of profanity.  If you didn't like this film, it's probably because you didn't fully understand it, so I suggest seeing it again to fully grasp it.",1111276800,,2367,4.7690417690417695
1325367,5,B00003CXZ3,"I hate to see when a good, different, quality, movie is completley over looked at in Hollywood. In the movie ""Memento"" starring Guy Pierce, gives a good performance as a man who suffers from a memory disorder in which he can't make new memories after a severe accident with a killer who murdered his wife. Since he cannot make new memories, he has to write all information on photographs. Guy Pierce does not know who his friends or enemies are. He has to rely on his photogrpah notes to catch the murderer. When you first watch the movie you maybe confused like I was, because they play the movie backwards. But in the end it all comes out to a great ending. Infact, I had to watch the movie again to look some parts over. The suspense and intensity is unbelievable. Like I said Guy Pierce gives a good solid performance along with Joey pants, (A friend or a foe). Whats sad is that the movie almost did not go into production. The movie was finished filming around 97' but did not get released in theaters till 2000. It was also played in very select theaters as well.

WRONG!!

What makes ""Memento"" unique is the fact that the movie goes in reverse. No, not the film strip, the story. The movie begins on the last scene and works its way through each scene backwards until (at the end of the film) you reach the beginning of the story. CONFUSING, HUH? The reason for this odd story telling is to recreate the feeling of having short term memory and it succeeds. (trust me)

The reason to get this version of the DVD is that a special hidden features exists: THE MOVIE IN CHRONOLOGICAL ORDER!!!

Here's how to get it:

Pop in the second disc > In The Main menu, Wait Until You hear lines from the film > Select the Clock Image > Answer all of the following multiple choice quesions with the letter ""C"" > When four pictures of a woman changing a tire appear, Put them in this order: 3,4,1,2 > Now the end credits will play in reverse and then the movie will be in chronological order! > ENJOY!!",1109635200,5,1222,4.457399103139013

I was very sad when Chris Nolan didn't win for Best Original Screenplay for the Academy Awards. The story is original, engaging and thought provoking.",1108944000,,457,4.7974683544303796
1325370,2,B00003CXZ3,"I felt very conflicted about this movie. On the plus side:

The cinematography was decent. The tension and suspense were palpable. The acting was excellent. the plot twists were mesmerizing. So why only 2 stars?

The whole plot of this movie was that the main character suffered an accident that leaves him unable to create new memories after the murder of his wife. So he goes around taking snapshots of everything and tatooing notes on himself so that he can ""remember"" clues he finds while trying to solve and vindicate his wife's murder. Every time he meets someone new he tells them about his memory problem and that he won't remember them the next time. So you never know if he can trust the people around him or not.

Sounds good right? But think about it- it doesn't make sense. If he's unable to make new memories since the accident then how does he remember the fact that he had an accident and that he has this memory disorder? These would have to have been facts he accquired after the accident. Hmmm. How does he even remember that his wife was murdered in the first place?

So this movie, though well shot and well acted, leaves me cold because of a plot hole so huge you could drive a mack-truck through it.",1108252800,4,1222,4.490990990990991
1325398,5,B00003CXZ3,"Like a classic book, Momento is a simple story masterfully told with meticulous attention to detail.

Awesome movie - the story is really quite simple (I'm not going to spoil anything), but it is told/shown such a unique matter that it keeps you intrigued from start to finish. The sooner you catch on to where the storyline is taking you the sooner you want to rewind and start over.

Guy pierce is excellent- his portrayal of this strange character is memorable. The writing is also wonderful: he is witty, smart, yet at the same time oblivious to the nth degree. And thus he is vulnerable and taken advantage of by people around him.

The film is also quite funny. Lenny suffers from a strange and unique condition, where he is incapable of making any new memory after he had an accident. So his mind hits the reset button every so often (sometimes quicker when his mind is racing).

There is a scene where he is being chased by someone and in the middle of the run ""Ok, what am I doing here? Aha I'm chasing someone"" after a gunshot at him ""No, I think he's chasing me."" He is constantly talking to himself trying to make sense of his surrounding.

I guarantee that this is one movie you'll have to watch twice. It's not very long (like and hour and half) so it's no big deal. You have to watch very carefully, paying close attention to the usage and morphing of the colors in the movie. Analogously: It has the same feel as the matrix, with better writing, better direction and the lack of superfluous action scenes.

I can't promise that you will put it on your top ten list, but you will be thinking about it after the film for a while. And be sure you will recommend it to others.

The story revolves around Leonard Shelby (Guy Pearce), an ex-insurance claims investigator who had to give up his job after he lost his ability to create new memories.  He lives by taking photos and keeping notes of his life.

The last thing he remembers is two men raping and killing his wife.  So he has dedicated his new life to finding- and killing- the man who killed his wife and took away his memory.  All he knows about the man are the few facts that he pulled from the police file from the accident: his name is either John or James, and his surname's initial is G (John or James G.).  The man has a connection to illegal drugs, and he has a license plate number.  Along the way, he is joined by Teddy (Joe Pantoliano), a guy who he fears he cannot trust, and Natalie, a woman helping him out of pity.  Unfortunately for Leonard, though, his notes can be manipulated, and he soon realizes that no one can be fully trusted.

The great thing about the way this movie is told is that, since we haven't seen the events leading up to a scene, we are just as in the dark about the situation as Leonard, and just when we think we have something figured out, our beliefs can be shattered in an instant when the truth is revealed.

You'd think that with the end at the beginning, it would be impossible for there to be a twist ending (I know I thought so), but just the opposite is true; the final scene of this film will completely blow you away.

The basic story concerns Leonard(Guy Pearce) a man suffering from short-term memory loss who is attempting to unravel the mystery of his wife's murder.  Leonard's efforts include a network of body tattoos, Polaroid pictures, and handwritten notes he leaves for himself.  As Leonard attempts to piece together the mystery the question arises as to the reliability of these reminders.  Leonard's condition also subjects him to the exploitation from some malevolent forces.

If you get the ""Limited Edition"" version, you CAN watch the movie in chronological order but it is an ""Easter Egg"" on the 2nd disc. I.e., It's not right there as an option under the special features that says ""Play in Chronological Order"" or anything. You have to know how to do it. I could just ruin the mystery and tell you how to do it, but where's the fun in that? As far as I know, the original U.S. DVD release doesn't have this feature (although I've read that the Canadian release has a feature allowing you to play each chapter in reverse order).

As for the movie itself, it is a great one. Some people complain about the ""gimmick"" but I just think these people are missing the point. Guy Pearce's character has a form of amnesia that makes it impossible for him to form new memories, so he has no short term memory. He has long term memory going up until the trauma occurred which left him with this affliction. The movie tries to let the audience know what this would be like.

1325405,5,B00003CXZ3,"Memento is one of the best films ever made in Cinema and I give credit to the Director and the actors, mainly Guy Pearce.  What makes Memento a great and unique film is that it plays backwards, though some parts acctually play forward(i.e the black and white scense)it kind of gets you confused which you'll have to acctually use your brain to figure out though later in the film it becomes easier to understand and you'll get the hang of it.

The story is pretty simple.  Leonard(Pearce)is out for revenge, to get the man who raped and murdered his wife.  The problem is that Leonard suffers from a rare brain disorder which means he can't make new memory(AKA short term memory loss)but for some odd reason he can remember things before his injury(which still kind of bothers me for some reason) and must write down notes and stuff like that inorder to get to the next puzzle or answer.  Since he has this short term memory loss he must take pictures, write down things and get tatoo's on his body which gives him clues and facts in order for him to get one step closer to the answer.  On his way through this journey of finding the man who did this to him he makes friends with a woman named Natalie and Teddy who may know more about Leonard then he could imagine.  To make things worse for Leonard he gets caught with some troubles like getting cooked up with some guy named Dodd(what he does and who he is you'll have to see the film for yourself)...Overall this is an Excellent film.

The film is pretty original if you ask me and Director Christopher Nolan did an excellent job editing, pacing this whole film.

I really like how the movie plays backwards which give the audience little confusion but that's it and the black and white scenes are very juicy and detailed until the very last scene where we find out what the real truth is.  You see the movie plays at the very end of the film and plays backwards to the very beginning of the film.  I really liked the characters in this film especially Teddy.  The characters were great and it's good to see Carrie-Anne Moss not dressed in black trying to save Zion and make out with Neo for a change...

Overall Memento blew me away.  This film has excellent writing editing, Great Actors, Excellent yet very simple story told backwards and some really great yet accward moments and there for I give this film a

5 out of 5 stars...

1325406,3,B00003CXZ3,"I don't want to repeat here what's been said in many other reviews.  The acting was okay, some cast members were better than others, and the main gimmick is the backwards time of the movie.  It literally starts with the end and shows the viewer, snippet by snippet, how the characters ended up there.

What's philosophically important in all this is the ""meaning"" of the first (and in a way, last) scene.  The main character has no short-term memory.  What this does is make it impossible for him to put together a coherent narrative of his own life.  To counter this he leaves himself notes, and even tattoos (pretty lame actually), to help him pick up his own life story where he left off.  The problem is, no note can ever be detailed enough and the notes he leaves are far too open to misinterpretation to be of good use.  He ends up stringing together a personal narrative that does not match reality.

In this sense, the movie is a foil to postmodern philosophies that hold that there is no more meaning to the world than individual narratives.  The movie shows what happens when one person's narrative does not match the true history and reality of the events...people die.  The main character's desire to have a meaningful life after all meaning has been stolen from him, even if he must ignore inconvenient facts to create that meaning, leads to disaster.  Read this against current US events, I have in mind the President's narrative regarding Iraq versus the actual history and true meaning of events, and the tragedy in the movie pales in comparison to what can happen in real life when narrative is corrupted by emotion and desire.

Overall, I give it only three stars because once you figure out the time sequencing thing, the ending is fairly predictable.  Also, in many ways, it is unbelievable.  I mean, where were the police as he was killing these people?  Who would tattoo those messages onto him (there's no way he could have done all of them with his homemade ballpoint pen cum tattoo needle)?  Also, the character Dodd just disappears despite being a [...] he beat up, put in a closet, and then just let go.  It seems to me he would have come back to get revenge.  Maybe that happens after the move begins-ends.",1102636800,3,2234,4.624365482233503
1325454,2,B00003CXZ3,"A friend recommended ""Memento"" to me, because I am very much into suspense thrillers. However, I approached it with a wary eye, as it was recommended to me by the same friend who suggested I see ""The Usual Suspects.""

""Memento"" is unmomentous for the same reason ""The Usual Suspects"" was: It requires hanging all one's emotions as a viewer on the gimmick peg. For example, I stopped watching ""The Usual Suspects"" about 3/4 into the movie.

""It was just, frankly, boring,"" I told my friend. ""I lost interest.""

My friend screamed at me that I missed the big shock ending, in which Kaiser Sose is explained. I would've loved that movie, I was told, if I was simply patient enough to wait for the big payoff at the end.

I countered that Hitchcock movies have big shock ending payoffs at the end, too, but that Hitch *kept the viewer interested* with taut suspense, a great plot and finely-honed dialogue.

So, I went into ""Memento"" with a little more patience. I stuck with this one until the bitter end, and it was indeed bitter.

The gimmick in this movie, which I picked up a third of the way into the inaction, is that it is shot in reverse time. Its hero, played by Guy Pearce, who must have graduated from the Keir Dullea Space Odyssey 2001 school of cardboard acting, suffers from a memory disorder. He can't remember what happened the day before, so he must reconstruct it physically -- with Polaroid shots and body tatoos -- to create a history for himself, so as not to go totally insane.  He also is tracking down a killer (a device borrowed from Hitch). When he catches the real killer, he can exonerate himself.

But, the story is told with painstakingly pedantic scenes and horribly fake understatement. I had no sympathy for the hero at all, and if it weren't for some very good acting by Carrie Ann Moss and Joe Pantoliano, I probably would have tuned out early.

The problem with ""Memento"" is that it tries to hard to be a film noir for our times, while ignoring just what it was that made those movies so memorable. Combing my mind, I cannot even think of one lesser film noir that was less entertaining than ""Memento,"" and no, I'm not forgetting ""Johnny Stool Pidgeon"" or ""Detour"" either. As far as ""The Big Sleep,"" ""Out of the Past"" or ""White Heat,"" forget about it! ""Memento"" is so far out of their league that it is an insult to compare this dreck with those great classics.

Watching movies requires, as we all know, the ""willing suspension of disbelief."" And I've got plenty of that suspension: It keeps me well entertained even by such formulaic movies as ""Dodgeball"" and ""Mr. 3000."" When it comes to movies, I admit I am guilty to being an escapist.

But, when something is just patently ridiculous that it defies belief, that's where I draw the line. In order to reconstruct his identity, Pearce has had tatoos embossed all over his torso. Okay, that's fine. I'll buy that.

However, just look at those tatoos: The producers obviously wanted them to look so cool that they went whole hog that they had a tatoo artist not just scrawl utilitarian messages on his body, but recreate the Sistine Chapel according to Marilyn Manson across his chest and arms. This one affectation comes off as more pretentious than the entire final script for ""American Beauty.""

Of course, there are no scenes of Pearce actually getting a tatoo. They would be too laughable.  However, I can imagine what one scene from the cutting room floor might look like:

PEARCE: I need this tatooed.

TATOO GUY: What does it say?

PEARCE: ""He has a gun, and he's coming for you.""

TATOO GUY: That's a lot of words, but if I just use navy blue, I can do it for you pretty cheap.

PEARCE: Cheap? I have $1000. Go to town, man.

TATOO GUY: Where do you get all that money? I mean, you live in a fleabag hotel, and with no obvious means of support.

PEARCE: I got it from Chris Nolan, my director. He said I've got to look ""killer cool."" Use this CD cover as an example for your fonts.

TATOO GUY: Wow, that IS cool. Motorhead's ""Sacrifice."" Lots of cool Goth script.

PEARCE: That's right. We're going after the MTV crowd: Nolan told me not to worry too much that there's nothing really cool about me at all, at least not in the Robert Mitchum or Elvis sense. Nolan said ""image is everything,"" so with these tatoos, and working out at the gym all day, so that my pecs look really ripped, I can't lose.

TATOO GUY: Bitchen, dude.

Of course, there is a bona-fide shock ending by the time this mess wraps up, but you'll figure out that Pearce is the killer long before he does.

If you have the intestinal fortitude to sit through this half-hearted art-school film, I recommend Edward Dmytryk's 1965 classic amnesia thriller ""Mirage"" as the perfect antidote. A tightly-shot thriller in the Hitchcock tradition, Gregory Peck doesn't need pecs nor tatoos to deliver a convincing performance. Instead, he uses Peter Stone's crafty dialogue. He also does something else that has eluded Guy Pearce.

He *acts* .",1101168000,11,4994,4.582022471910112
1325455,5,B00003CXZ3,"'Memento' is a very well made film. The main character Leonard makes genuinely surprising discoveries throughout his search for the man who murdered his wife. This is a revenge movie in which I actually felt sympathy for the protagonist, for, though 'Memento' is primarily a thriller, it does not gloss over the sorrow Leonard feels about his wife. Unfortunately, Leonard is also very confused and vulnerable because the man who killed Leonard's wife also injured Lenny in the head, causing him to have very short short term memory. One of the main themes of 'Memento' is how crummy people are - and how people will manipulate each other at any chance they get.

'Memento' is famous for being told ""backward"". One thread plays forward, another, which involves most of the action in the story, works backward, scene by scene. It works well, and is more than a gimmick. The climax is neither predictable nor over the top, and is one of the best I have seen in a while.

The acting is astounding, particularly by Carrie Ann Moss. As her character gradually unfolds, the viewer sees the greatly varied facets of her personality. Joe Palantino is an excellent actor, and he is perfectly cast as an untrustworthy but seemingly helpful cop. Guy Pearce successfully plays Leonard Shelby, who is alternately lost, driven, disciplined, and frazzled. Each main character is sympathetic in some way but has a supremely unpleasant streak.

Due to its intricate plot, carefully attended details, and complex character motives, 'Memento' holds up on repeated viewings. Highly recommended.",1100390400,5,1573,5.065637065637065

He spends the film hunting down his wife's killer, but with a short-term memory that lasts for mere minutes, he is forced to write down clues on the fly as he gets them, and rely on his notes rather than his memory to solve the case.

1325461,2,B00003CXZ3,"Film noir with a unique narrative device: the story is told starting at the end in short segments in which the story moves forward. Between each of these segments, there is a black and white segment of the protagonist on the phone with an unidentified person. How these segments fit in time with the rest of the story isn't clear, even on repeat viewings.

The narrative device simply makes the story too confusing for a movie audience. DVD viewers can replay segments to catch details and clear up confusion.

Whether they will want to or not is another question. This film has an overabundance of murder, delusions, revenge, greed, drugs, lies, manipulation, tatoos, violence, and despicable acts of one kind or another to qualify as film noir. But even in film noir at least one of the characters should deserve some sympathy. In this movie, none of the characters do. In the end, we are asked to believe that the main character would choose to become a serial murderer killing people that, at the time he makes this choice, he knows have nothing to do with the attack. His only reason is just to give his life some semblance of a purpose. Nothing in his background makes this action believable.

Even puzzle fans who persist in trying to understand what is going on will be frustrated by the movies plot holes, red herrings, and inconsistencies.

The main character is supposed to remember everything that happened before the attack, and not be able to make any memories since. But he doesn't remember some things that happened before the attack, and he does remember some things afterward that are inconsistent with his supposed mental condition. He remembers exactly what his mental condition is. How? He can't remember if he's chasing someone or if they're chasing him, but he remembers that he drove to the location, where the car is, how to get back to it, which car it is and where the keys are. How? He remembers that he's supposed to take pictures to help him remember. He remembers that he's taken pictures, and where they are. He remembers that he needs notes to help him remember and he remembers that he's supposed to look for those notes.

The real story of how his wife died is not credible. It's inconsistent with his mental condition after the attack. It's simply not believable that someone in his mental condition would have been in a position to do what he supposedly did. In addition, one of the other major characters' actions are inexplicable. That character keeps turning up with no apparent motivation, knowing things that the character has no way of knowing.

Tatoos are important in this film. The protagonist believes most of the tatoo ""facts."" In his condition, how does he remember to believe them? The protagonist has a tatoo that says ""never answer the phone."" Notes are pushed under his door telling him to answer the phone. But why? Why not just knock on the door? So what does he do? He answers the phone. And why is not answering the phone important? He's so easy to dupe in person, the phone doesn't create any bigger threat. Yet he spends much of the movie on the phone.

At the end of the movie, he's shown in bed with his wife. He has a tatoo that we've never seen before. It says: ""I've Done It."" Presumably he's imagining this. But imagining this tatoo is completely inconsistent with his mental state and motivation at the time.

Memento is a challenging trip. But ultimately it's a trip not worth taking.",1095465600,9,3451,4.692561983471075
1325462,5,B00003CXZ3,"I have seen a lot of movies and almost always I know what the director is doing.  I know what the actors want to achieve.  I know what the aims of the producers are.  It's all transparent, but once in a while there is a work of pure genius that makes me think I really don't know anything at all.  Memento is such a work.

Looking at the premise of this movie, I recall that it can really happen.  Neurologist Oliver Sacks, in his wonderful book, The Man Who Mistook His Wife for a Hat (1986), recounts the story of a man who could only hold the memory of the last thirty seconds or so.  Leonard's condition in this movie is better.  Apparently he can hold in his mind what has happened over the last few minutes.  Also he has the ability to follow a kind of learned routine in which he is able to function by continually writing himself notes.  In the case recalled by Dr. Sacks, the man could not do that.  He could not even remember enough to finish a short conversation.

The idea of taking notes to ""remember"" is something that some Alzheimer's patients are able to do in the early stages of the disease (which may be where Jonathan Nolan got the idea for his short story on which the film is based.)  Sacks recalls such a case in his An Anthropologist on Mars: Seven Paradoxical Tales (1995).  The notes act as the man's memory, just as the notes and photos do for Leonard in this movie.

The next question might be, could someone with Leonard's ""condition"" actually function well enough to get by without being institutionalized or having somebody take care of him on a minute to minute basis?  Leonard says, ""Habit and routine...conditioning make my life possible.""  He ""remembers"" to look in his jacket pocket to see where he is living.  Presumably he also does this when he is in his car and has forgotten where he is going and doesn't know where he is.  Presumably he has many notes that we don't see him refer to.  How does he find his way back to his car after going somewhere?  He identifies his car from a photo, but where is it parked?  In the scene where he wakes up next to Natalie, he gets up and goes to his jacket and finds her picture so he knows who she is.  He also finds a picture of her and Dodd.  He somehow ""remembers"" the significance and writes on the back of her photo, ""...she lost someone too.  She will help you out of pity.""  How does he remember these things?  Perhaps they are examples of ""implicit learning"" that ""Sammy"" was not able to accomplish, what Leonard calls ""conditioning.""  In implicit learning as opposed to ""explicit,"" we learn to do something without knowing we learned it.

Regardless of these questions, this is a brilliantly conceived and plotted thriller, and the acting by the three principals is superb.  Guy Pearce plays Leonard in a most immediate and affecting manner so that we are forced us to identify with him and his predicament.  Carrie-Anne Moss, whom you may recall from The Matrix (1999), is mesmerizing with her sexy, mysterious eyes as the hard-edged and haunting Natalie.  Joe Pantoliano is first rate as Teddy, the wisecracking, cynical and rather annoying undercover cop.

But what really makes this a stunning movie is the way it is constructed.  The scenes are presented in reverse chronological order, so that we know the latest action first, and at the end of the movie find out the earlier action.  This seems an extraordinary way to tell a story, but it works.  Incidentally, there's a Seinfeld episode told this way, the one where they go to India for a wedding; and to some extent this technique was employed in Quentin Tarantino's Reservoir Dogs (1992).  What makes it particularly effective here is the material.  Leonard, as Teddy points out, is not the same person he was before his wife's death and his injury.  For him the arrow of time has lost its meaning.  Earlier events are just the same as later ones.  Director Christopher Nolan (Jonathan's brother), who also wrote the screenplay, was able to dovetail the action scene by scene as we move backward in time so that what seems true in the beginning becomes different than what is true in the end.  And indeed, like Leonard, our experience of the story doesn't depend on time's arrow.

Viewing this the second time (and you may feel a compulsion to do just that) some of the lines that were not funny initially become very funny.  The voice-over in the chase scene with Dodd is an example.  Leonard finds himself running and he says, ""So what am I doing?...I'm chasing him....No, he's chasing me!""  Or when Teddy asks about the gun, Leonard says, ""Must be his.  I don't think they'd let somebody like me carry a gun.""  Or Teddy's line to Leonard, ""I've had more rewarding friendships than this--but I get to keep telling the same jokes.""

The key to the powerful psychological ""ending"" of the film, where we realize what will eventually happen, occurs when Natalie tells Leonard that revenge is useless because he won't remember it.  He replies, ""It doesn't matter whether I remember or not....""  Indeed we see that he really doesn't remember his revenge and that implies that he will...

But you really need to see the movie to appreciate the stunning implication.

On another level this is a movie about what makes us human.  What would life be like if we lived in an eternal present without reference to the past?  We could be easily exploited by those with knowledge of the past, as Leonard is, but there is a deeper question being asked.  Does life have any real meaning for a person without memory?",1095206400,8,5548,4.5823170731707314

1325511,5,B00003CXZ3,"I read an extremely detailed review, with explicit spoilers, before seeing this film-- but still enjoyed it thoroughly.  It's the most original concept in film-making in recent years.

The acting, camera-work and set-dressing don't make much impact, although-- to give credit where credit is due-- the realism in wardrobe, set-dressing, and dialogue is extremely well done.

What sets this movie apart is the intricacy of the editing.  It's filmed in such a way that you'll thoroughly enjoy ""making an evening of it"" by inviting friends to watch the film, then discuss the plot afterward, over a long dinner.  Bonus points if you can figure out who the bad guy is, and a half-dozen other major plot points-- but DAMN, you'll have a fun time debating & puzzling over it.

IMPORTANT:  Other reviews have (incorrectly) said that the film's sequences are shown backward.  This is not true.  Or rather, it's only half-true.  The film is made up of a series of 5-minute segments.  Half of them (let's call them M, N, O, P, ... Z) are shot in black and white, while the other half (let's call them A, B, C, D, E...K, L) appear in color.  The black-and-white segments are shown in reverse order (Z, Y, X, ...) and are interwoven with the color segments, which happen in chronological order (A, B, C...).  The result is a bit confusing:  The segments are shown in ""A, Z, B, Y, C, X, D, W, E..."" order.

This interesting use of editing and sequence lets us completely enter the confusing world of the main character, who's unable to form new memories, and so, can't remember anything for longer than 5 minutes.  It also helps to keep us guessing about major plot points.

Keep your eyes open for logical conflicts and what look like continuity errors, in the main character's oldest memories.  These apparent errors are particularly revealing, and closely model the way a real memory works:  impoerfectly remembering things, and hiding painful memories while editing & altering memories.",1093824000,6,1977,4.847761194029851

 Leonard himself kills his own wife. His wife survives the intruders assault. Leonard kills one of them before he loses his memory. The second intruder is killed latter with the help of Teddy. Teddy shows him a picture where Leonard, covered in blood, is pointing at his chest where he would tatoo that he killed the second intruder. Somewhere at the end of movie, as Leonard drives around in a frenzy of mental activity, we see a rushed glimpse of him relaxing in bed with his wife -- with the legend ""I'VE DONE IT"" tattooed on his chest (exactly where he was pointing in the picture).

 In other words, his wife was still alive AFTER he killed the second intruder.

 In the last scene of the movie, Teddy explains to Leonard that he has manipulated Leonard to kill Jimmy and possibly several other similarly loathsome bottom feeders before that. He says something to the effect that it was ""to give you something to live for""; of course, Teddy also has to admit that his own motivation had a little bit to do with the $200,000 in drug money stashed in the trunk of Jimmy's Jaguar.

 Leonard gets angry, and Teddy, apparently frustrated by his lack of memory, hits him hard with some uncomfortable truths: Leonard's wife hadn't even died, Teddy tells Leonard. She actually survived the assault. Leonard himself had killed her, by administering insulin shots. The Sammy Jankis business is a dreamy conflation of a real story with events from Leonard's own marriage, events so horrifying and guilt-causing that Leonard has had to project them onto someone else -- poor, hapless Sammy Jankis.

 As Leonard narrates the conclusion of the Sammy Jankis story, we see an extended shot of poor Sammy in an insane asylum. A figure walks across the front of the camera -- and suddenly, for literally a split second of screen time, we see Leonard himself in Sammy's chair. Similarly, as Teddy berates Leonard at the abandoned building, we see shots of Leonard himself administering insulin to his wife's thigh.

 Leonard has a copy of a police report, but we are given to understand that some pages are missing. Presumably the missing pages would have included the information that Leonard's wife didn't die in the original attack. But who took the pages? And why? Apparently, Leonard himself took the pages because he wanted to believe that his life has a ""mission"" to find the killer (even though his wife survived the assault, and he killed his own wife by insulin, i.e. ""Sammy Jankis"").

 Teddy's outburst at Leonard in the end answers all the film's questions. But if what Teddy says about Leonard is true, and if Leonard can remember fully his life before the attacks, why doesn't Leonard remember his wife had diabetes? He says flatly that she didn't. But as Leonard himself tells Teddy fairly early on, ""Memory's unreliable ... Memory's not perfect. It's not even that good. Ask the police; eyewitness testimony is unreliable ... Memory can change the shape of a room or the color of a car. It's an interpretation, not a record. Memories can be changed or distorted, and they're irrelevant if you have the facts.""

 Did Sammy kill his wife with insulin? Or did Leonard? For Leonard to have killed his wife and then have transferred the story onto Sammy (as Teddy claims) would require that Leonard remember an event that happened after his accident. Yes, Leonard has a quick memory flash of injecting his wife, but it's followed by a repetition of an earlier version of the memory, where he was merely pinching her. Is the injection memory just the other memory distorted by Teddy's suggestion? Except, several hours later in the chronology -- which is to say earlier in the film -- Leonard, sitting at Natalie's house, has another momentary memory flash of preparing the injection. (It appears to be the exact same shot as before.) Even if the image was a false one, influenced by what Teddy said, how can Leonard still remember it hours later?

 Who ends up in the mental hospital? Leonard tells us that Sammy ends up there. But Teddy tells us that Leonard's nuts, and then there's that flash in which we see Leonard himself there",1091664000,9,4187,4.767634854771784
1325515,5,B00003CXZ3,"What has not been commented on too much is the subtle humour present in this film noir.  There is something subtly funny about the lengths Leonard will go to seek revenge for his wife's death,as he attempts to rationally cope with his disability, including Polaroid photos, notes to himself, maps, and body tattoos; not to mention stealing a dead man's Jaguar.  Of course to him it is not at all funny, but a thoroughly rational and disciplined response to a debilitating psychological condition. By this constant discipline he hopes to overcome his disability.  I thought this film was strong in almost all ways, including its portrayal of L.A. lowlife,a brutal drug-related murder, the character Teddy, and the use of Sammy Jankis as another example of a person with short-term memory loss. Sammy was a sad case, being denied insurance benefits after an accident; the insurance company--more specifically Leonard-- determined his condition was psychological, not physical. Leonard constantly forces himself to remember Sammy. I thought the scenes with Natalie, who helps him try to find his wife's murderer after Leonard beats up Dodd, were excellent. Whether Leonard or Dodd actually beats up Natalie is unclear. Leonard's memory  is so faulty it's hard to tell. All Leonard knows is he loved his wife, and he has mementos of their life to prove it.  He even has a call girl come in to recreate their former life.  After two viewings I still find it somewhat surrealistic as to what actually happened, even including whether his wife is truly dead or not, or whether in fact Teddy is honest. I think the bulk of the evidence suggests that he is.  There is a short scene late in the film showing his wife embracing his tattooed body, indicating she was alive after he believes she died. The film is very good at evoking for the audience a state of mind of short-term memory loss. There is also some question about the underlying assumptions of the film including the assumption that Sammy's wife was diabetic: Teddy says late in the film that Sammy didn't have a wife; it was Leonard's wife who was diabetic.",1091577600,,2110,4.877094972067039
1325516,5,B00003CXZ3,"Before you watch this film, to avoid being confused you have to realize that the whole movie is played out backwards. A certain scene will play until it reaches the starting point of the scene before it. Christopher Nolan used this technique to put the viewer into the same perspective as the protagonist. He suffers from a short term memory disorder that renders him incapable of making new memories past the point of his accident. During a robbery of his house, he sustained a serious head injury that messed up his memory. So he is trying to track down his wife's killer. However, it's very difficult for him to do because he can't remember new things that he's just discovered. To compensate for this, he has a series of tattoos with the certain facts that he has confirmed. He also takes pictures and makes notes to remember people or places that he's been to. The film is executed brilliantly and showcases the perfect actors. Guy Pearce stars as the protagonist, Leonard Shelby. And the film co-stars Carrie-Anne Moss (The Matrix, Red Planet) as Natalie, and Joe Pantoliano (Bad Boys II, The Fugitive) as Teddy. The film also has a terrific twist of an ending. 5 stars, one of my favorite films.

Sidenote: This DVD edition, the Limited Edition, has a very unique style to it. The special features are all easter eggs, as you are presented with a series of questions and then you have to answer them in the right order to reach certain supplements. It is an interesting approach to the new things you can do with the DVD format, but it can get frustrating at times. If you prefer a more straightforward DVD version, there is a single-disc edition available.",1091404800,,1664,4.679180887372014

He seems to wake up fine and know that he has this problem of no short-term memory. It doesn't seem like he should be able to remember that.

The acting is fantastic, cryptic, as we aren't sure how much Leonard really knows about himself (and he doesn't know how much he knows either!)  What role does his subconscious play in his actions?  Has he recorded all that has happened to him, somewhere in his emotions?  Do we even have a subconsious?  What will his future hold?  How can he live?

This handicap would be more than most could bear, but add a single-minded vengeance focused on finding the murderer of your beloved wife and you have a volatile mixture for increased interest and high drama.  The driving force for bringing this unique premise to the big screen is the product of the collaborative efforts of Director Chris Nolan and Columbia Tri-Star Studios.  Their efforts in creating a story that stimulates our intellect and traps us in its' snare of plot twists for the entire duration of the movie is an achievement and makes this a must see for anyone looking for change a pace from the typical drama.
Further adding to this unique premise is the fact that the story is told in an unnatural reverse sequence; beginning with the ending, then building towards the ending again in ten minute segments.  Even though the viewer is shown the ultimate ending first, the story really becomes about why the story concluded this way and thus begins their journey with Leonard Shelby, the unfortunate amnesiac portrayed perfectly through the fine acting of Guy Pierce.  The viewer roots for Leonard due to his absolute devotion to finding his wife's killer through many of the creative efforts he utilizes to overcome his affliction.  These include the use of Polaroid pictures, many notes scribbled on various pieces of paper and from a multitude of tattoos that adorn his body along with two individuals that we, the viewers, are really never sure are supposed to serve as friend or foe to Leonard.  With all of these elements combined, this movie fulfills the role of achieving the highest excellence in film for this genre and creates a superior classic psychological drama for all to enjoy.",1082592000,,1832,4.909385113268608

Its so hard to watch because none of the scenes hold out long enough each past event is by the most 5 min and by least a min. then they go to the time before that. He ceriously in this movie forgets everything like a hundred times over so so boring and the ending is boring because its really suppose to be the beggining don't expect this to be an action film cause its not i don't really know what kind of film this is. I only gave it two stars cause guy is in it and he always does a fantastic job. But definitly not a movie to buy if your realy keen on watching it rent it instead because this is not the movie for the average only for those who say a movies great because they are lost and confused in the end me personally i like to see a movie that leaves you feeling like youve learned something from the movie but this does not do that it just leaves you very dissapointed.,1082505600,,1107,4.013574660633484

Also, you probably missed the point on ""conditionilizing"" the memory, so even when you don't remember something, when it gets repeated long enough, your brains get conditionalized to it.",1082332800,,511,5.095238095238095

You are immediately thrust into the life of a man with a type of memory loss that prevents him from remebering things for more than a few minutes at a time. He has no idea of what happened to him or why. The most ineresting thing about this movie is that for the most part you only know as much as he knows. This technique is very effective in that it keeps the viewer on the edge from the start of the movie to the surprising ending.

1325577,5,B00003CXZ3,"To conclude, this movie rocks , although you may need to watch it a few times to fully grasp all the subtlties of what's going on.
The Limited edition version is by turns incredible rewarding and distressingly frustrating!  I don't know who decided to make it in such a way, but I truly believe they need to rethink their strategy - not everyone has the patience to play games with a DVD each time they want to watch it, and those of us renting it from our local soul-destroying chain video store that shall remain nameless, don't get the inlay cards etc. leading to a puzzling night...
It challenges a lot of our assumptions of truth and memory and really forces us to home in on our own ideas of which narrative we believe, and should we trust the narrator.
Basically each disc has a set of psychiatric test questions that loop around, and depending on your answer offer you various bonus features.
Disc one isn't too hard to work out, but disc two can be prohibitively obstinate.  Thank god then for the invention of the ""Internet"". Accessing this through a ""Computer"" will lead you to a bunch of fan sites that have maps and hints to guide you through the labyrinth, which does come off as being slightly rewarding.
The movie opens at the end and replays in short segments leading up to the beginning of the plot, while it alternates with black and white sections that go forward in time to the start of the real plot. The plot itself is dark and disturbing, yet tinged with a surprising amount of humor (""See, I have this condition..."").

The main reason I picked up this DVD was the ""alternate endings"" feature on the back of the box. This turns out to also be slightly misleading. What you can get is 3 different directors commentaries over the ending, with three different ways to interpret the closing (or opening?!) scenes.  I actually found this really cool, as each narrative presented by the director is presented as fact, and it's really cool to watch them all back to back with the thought ""I'm being lied to!"" in the back of your mind.  That's pretty damn cool.
Very rarely a movie comes along that is so good it makes you rethink everything you once thought about movies.  Memento is that kind of film.
The other special feature I was really looking forward to is the chance to see the whole movie in the correct sequence, which is also buried in Disc 2.  This will certainly clear things up for anyone that didn't understand it the right way round, but I got kinda bored watching the straight version, possibly cos I'd just watched the ""right"" version the day before.
Anyway, memento will make you a better person and cause girls to fall at your feet.  Not really, but you should go buy it anyway.",1080950400,6,2715,4.526530612244898
1325578,3,B00003CXZ3,"An interesting movie with a captivating (although not all that original) premise, ""Memento"" is a true cult film, one that tries to offer something slightly different and personal. The concept is good, but after the first half the movie gets a bit repetitive and unsurprising, culminating in a mildly disappointing ending. Still, the acting is top notch, since Guy Pearce truly is an excellent choice for the lead role, delivering a subdued and intriguing performance. Directing Christopher Nolan suceeds at creating a gripping and moody atmosphere with enough suspense and interest, grabbing the viewer`s attention. That`s particularly relevant, since in this story every detail counts. Well, the plot per se is hardly anything new, so what sets ""Memento"" apart from most thrillers is the way its story is told. As a whole, this effort is worthwile and appealing, yet it`s more cerebral, cold and distant than enjoyable, entertaining and warm. It`s also a bit too depressing, since the final revelation makes one look at the characters from a new (and darker) perspective. Still, ""Memento"" is a remarkable movie about human nature, lies, trust and love, providing a clever (perhaps too clever, by the way), unusual and witty mistery. It`s unfortunate that, at parts, it carries more style than substance, but it`s a solid cinematic experience nonetheless.

1325580,5,B00003CXZ3,"so the movie itself it first class first of all - innovative, extremely hard to follow and requires several viewings. the way the dvd's are produced is another thing - the film itself as well as all the options and extras are all kinda like easter eggs that you have to find. the disc itself only specifies the actual features i.e. the nice sundance channel documentary, the original short story memento mori, the trailers and picture gallery, but you have to pay a lot more attention to find the really hidden easter eggs, and boy the dvd doesn't make it easy to find them, even if you found instructions on the web of how to locate them!
the most important easter egg is the film in reverse sequence, i.e. in the realtime chronological order of the scenes - very nice to watch but only after you've seen the original sequence of the feature. another easter egg is a couple of japanese posters for the film and a nearly impossible to read journal made by leonard (i couldn't read any of it, maybe you need a hi-def tv for that...)
but for me the best easter egg is the alternate director's commentaries. basically for the last 20 minutes of the commentary track, there are 4 separate commentaries by the director. i won't tell you how to find them (and not many website will) but needless to say they are so hard to find that i still haven't managed to listen to one of those 4 commentaries. the first one is a continuation of the commentary from the rest of the film, i.e. talking about the movie etc., two other commentary tracks concern teddy's character with opposing views about him in each track. this is a fantastic idea because different people will hear different commentaries about teddy (assuming they've found the easter egg) and will draw different conclusions about him, and then in some hypothetical debate they'll go head-to-head with those who'd heard the opposing commentary track, if you know what i mean. finaly the fourth alternate commentary is the most interesting just because it's recorded backwards! i'd love to hear what's being said about it but to do that you'd need to record the track on a tape deck and then play it in reverse... not quite sure how to do that nowadays since i don't even own a tape deck but it would be interesting to hear what's on it.
i also read that none of the bonus features from the original one-disc dvd are included in this special edition 2-discer so that's a shame, but then again all those easter eggs will eventually drive you insane anyway so no need for even more extras!
a couple of final notes, apart from the alternate commentaries, the actuall full-length director's commentary can become tedious just because he never shuts up and just moves from one idea to another without any break in between them, and he doesn't always sound very clear with his low british accent voice. finally guy pearce in great in this movie and boy was i surprised to learn he's the guy from Priscilla Queen of the Desert!

It's better to let this movie take you on a backwards path from end to beginning.  It's truly fascinating. If you're not sure whether you'll like it, just look at the stars. You stand around a 90% chance of enjoying this film. From the moment I popped the DVD in, the main menu just blew me away. It's the MUSIC, by composer David Julyan. I watched this a couple months ago and the music stayed in my subconscious. Finally had to play the movie again, and I enjoyed it just as much as the first time, even after knowing all the twists and turns.
I don't want to rehash what I'm sure most people do in these reviews. Reading them makes you feel sometimes like you're reliving Groundhog Day. One enjoyable thing was the way the DVD was produced. There is actually a dual main menu, and you can access the secondary one by slipping into the audio selections and then returning to the main menu. Even the building of the scene selections is a completely different approach to producing a DVD. More companies should be so innovative in bringing a fresh approach to creating unique menus.
This is a great movie for thinking people to watch. It is one of the better- written and edited movies out there. And I know that most movie- goers want a movie that challenges the mind. Lenny (Guy Pearce) does plenty of thinking and I found myself trying to get into HIS mind because, while the story plays backwards, I want to know just where he's going and how he can keep his sanity. If I had the same condition as Lenny, I'd be completely paranoid -- I wouldn't trust anyone. What better way to remember than having information tattooed? But how easy you can be manipulated when you have short term memory loss.
I see there is a new limited edition of Memento at about the same cost as the original DVD, and I plan on owning this one. Rent the film and you'll more than likely discover that you'll want to watch it time and again, so you may as well pick up a copy. Listen. Most people voted Memento with a perfect score and less than 10% gave it a ""D"" or worse grade in a highly- respected movie site with a total of over 67,000 votes. Across the board demographically, the voters gave it at LEAST 8/10, with women 45 or older giving it just under 8.

1325616,4,B00003CXZ3,"So, lots of people have told you how terrific this movie is (except those that didn't understand it).  I highly second those glowing reviews.
Just two things, though:
First, if Leonard can't remember anything since he and his wife were attacked, why does he remember his ""condition"" and explain it to everyone he meets?  He seems to never need prompting on this point - he doesn't even have a tatoo explaining it.  So, how could he remember it, since it happened after the attack and he can't remember anything he does, says, has done to him or said to him from that point on?
For this reason I gave it four stars.  Otherwise it's excellent, and deserves multiple watchings.
One other thing: At the end of the movie we see flashbacks (?) of Leonard with his wife.  There is a new tatoo on his chest that isn't there throughout the entire movie: ""I DID IT"".  This was alluded to as a tatoo he would give to himself after killing his wife's murderer.
So, was his wife really dead?  Was it all an act (remember, he accused his client of acting, right?)?  Was he dreaming of his wife being alive after his vengence?  Is this just a left-curve thrown in by the filmmaker to confuse us?
An enigma inside an enigma....
I also liked the menu ""clues"" - very clever, extending the story outside the bounds of the film itself....
Also, Guy Pearce could be my best friend's twin brother... very surreal watching him....

Still, Leonard Shelby (Pearce's character) is shown killing three people and beating up and kidnapping a third.  One of his persistant acquaintences, Teddy (Joe Pantoliano), claims Leonard has killed yet a fourth person.  Leonard is neither remorseful nor restrained by religious feelings.  He might be considered a smiling psychopath, even allowing for the memory deficiency.  If he doesn't get his inciting tattoos removed, he might be serial killing for the rest of his life.  This Guy is something else!",1074729600,,851,5.542635658914729
1325619,4,B00003CXZ3,"The movie begins with a bang (literally and figuratively), and the viewer is immediately sucked in to the story, which, for the most part, works its way backwards in small segments, giving the viewer brief moments of continuity so that the viewer has some sense of chronology in this tale told in reverse.
This was my first experience with Guy Pearce in a leading role, and he was impressive, accurately portraying Leonard Shelby's sense of hopeful but frustrated determination to overcome his short-term memory loss.  Unlike Dory in Finding Nemo, however, Shelby's condition is not used for comic relief.  Instead, the story weaves its way in and out of Shelby's in-the-moment sense of reality, bringing him into contact with a variety of interesting characters, most of whom viciously manipulate him.
Joe Pantoliano and Carrie-Ann Moss (of Matrix fame) both play supporting roles, as does CSI/ER veteran Jorja Fox.  But the story primarily focuses on Pearce's Shelby, and his desperate attempts to find his wife's killer...and himself.
Although I have only watched it once, it would probably be as interesting to view again now that I know what to look for.  Not sure I would want to own it, but a very interesting story that compels you to follow it to completion.",1074729600,,1267,4.990521327014218

1325621,5,B00003CXZ3,"Memento, this movie is unique. You think that this movie would go in events from beginning to end.  But this movie is different. It goes from the end to the beginning, but is that really possible? Is there a plot that can really support that? Well as a matter a fact there is, this movie can actually have that and also let the end (beginning really if you think about it) have a wicked twist. Now I might be confusing you but be confused no more because now let me explain the plot.
Memento is about Leonard, he suffers from short term memory loss. Leonard remembers everything up to his wifes murder. Leonard also was attacked during his wife murder (thus the memory loss) He cannot create new memories. So now he is trying to have his revenge with the killer. But how can he accomplish that with his condition? Well...
Leonard is very organized, he can take notes and take pictures so he can remember who is who. He takes pictures of all of his contacts. As he goes through his quest he is getting closer and closer he also gets tricked, people can take advantage of someone who won't remember you. He meets a bad cop named Teddy who helps him meet his murder and a bar maid named Natilie.
This movie is very suspenseful, this should not be watched by anyone younger than 15, because this movie is very graphic. Be careful when you watch this because some parts are boring. Have fun...",1074556800,2,1388,4.421875
1325622,4,B00003CXZ3,"""Memento"" can obviously be described in many ways.  I see it pretty much as a mind boggling and extremely original movie that is extraordinarily inventive in how it's told.  From the very beginning or should I say the very end of this film to the end or was it the beginning, this film will lead you in the process of here's how it ended and now let's work out how we got there.  I simply cannot think of any other film that I've seen that has been portrayed in such a manner and oddly enough, it works wonderfully for this thriller.
Simply put, to make this movie work, it had to take some of Hollywood's best on screen talents and that is exactly what the producers of this film came up with.  Guy Pearce's performance as a man who cannot make new memories is stunning to say the least.  The ever beautiful Carrie-Anne Moss of ""Matrix"" fame performs brilliantly, showing that she definitely has talents outside of the ""Matrix.""  Joe Pantoliano, most recently acclaimed for his performance during his stint on ""The Sopranos,"" performs exceptionally well in this film, just showing that he gets better and better with every role.
The movie was based on an original short story by Jonathan Nolan and Christopher Nolan took it and ran with it, culminating in this extremely intriguing revenge thriller.  Christopher Nolan most certainly deserves all the praise and accolades he has and continues to receive for the originality of concept in the screenplay and his directing performance of this film.
The Premise:
Guy Pearce plays Leonard Shelby, a rather odd individual who at one point seemingly had the perfect life with his wife yet one day that came crashing down on him when he awoke and found men attempting to rape and kill his wife.  During that incident he struck his head on the wall and has, since that time, not been able to make any new memories.  What follows from there is an intriguing tale in which Leonard, who is constantly taking Polaroid snapshots, making notes and doing self tattoo's to remind him of the ""facts,"" attempts to seek revenge upon the person responsible for his wife's death...
I would definitely recommend this mind boggling, well told revenge thriller for any and all who are interested in this type of film, Guy Pearce's performance alone makes this film one to watch!  {ssintrepid}

1325662,5,B00003CXZ3,"Here we have a man whoe had an accident.  He can no longer make new memories, they just fade away.  So he must leave himself notes.  Mostly in the form of poloroid picture and very important notes are tattooed to his body.  He is on a mission of revenge.  He is after his wife's rapist and murderer.  But he has no memory after the accident.
The movie begins with the end and goes to the beginning in ten to fifteen minute segments divided always by a black and white segment that goes in normal order which actually takes place before the colour part does.  It may sound confusing, but is actually quite e4asy to follow.  The point of the movie is not to find out whodunit, but the why.
The acting is perfect and the cinematogrophy is perfect as well.  The music really fits the mood too.  Plus there is a twist at the end (or the beginning!).  Multiple viewings are required to really pick up on certain things that are definelty missed and will make the story have more sense and really uncover the ""conspiracy"", if there really is one that is!
The special features could be really good...if I could find them that is.  Disc 2 is filled with them.  But the menus and the ""tests"" you have to take on each selection are so cryptic and obscure its darn near impossible.  It took me an hour to get the ""anatomy of a scene"" show thing.  And that was all I was able to find.  That one gripe aside, everything is perfect.  I have no beef with the movie whatsoever, it's totally awesome and I wish everyone would watch it.

1325664,5,B00003CXZ3,"This is truly an original film.  Once in a while a film or filmmaker comes along and completely destroys all conventional ideas about how to make a movie.  This film is told in reverse order and by the end it completes a loop where the viewer could push 'play' on his DVD player and continue with the story, forever.  From the very first scene it is obvious that something unusual is about to happen.  The photography itself is run in reverse to set the tone of the story.  Not to be lost in the disjointed narrative are three great acting performances from Carrie-Anne Moss, Joe Pantoliano, and most notably the lead actor, Guy Pearce, whose role in ""L.A. Confidential"" began my personal respect for his talent.  This is high quality filmmaking on all levels.  It is true that the first time I saw this, by movie's end, I wanted to scream.  The director, Christopher Nolan, forces the audience to remember each previous scene in detail leading up to the end, thus making the audience identify with the main character who suffers from short-term memory loss.  This is a unique film, and I am proud to have it in my collection.  Later.",1074038400,,1134,4.597014925373134
1325665,5,B00003CXZ3,"First things first:
The movie:
Memento is an ingenious film center on the life of Leonard Shelby, a brain-damaged widower who obstensibly lost his ability to form new long-term memories when his wife was raped and presumably murdered. The caveats in that previous sentence are result of the film's storytelling which do not allow a viewer to take ANYTHING presented onscreen for granted. The movie immediately sets you in Leonard's world as it is presented in a succession of 5-10 minute flashbacks, which chop your own knowledge of events into segments like Leonard lives. It is this unusual presentation that drives the movie. What would otherwise be a relatively dull plot is brilliantly revealed in turns and twists in this presentation. The distortion of time becomes the primary narrative device, rather than a cheap gimmick, and truly makes Memento a better movie. The acting in the film is good though not brilliant, with the best work coming from those around an above-average Guy Pierce.
Generally viewers either love or despise this film's ultimate plot, but no one disputes it's creativity. This film's heart is black at best, and takes a decidedly bleak and utilitarian outlook. While it will not change anyone's life, it does deal a massive narrative twist, the biggest in a long series of reverses and shifted angles.
Ultimately, though, if you see the movie once, you will want and need to see it again, and likely again. It is simply impossible to take everything in on the first viewing, because you simply don't learn enough to catch the import of every detail. Which is why one would want the DVD.
Which brings us to this very unusual disc. The packaging itself, which mimic a patient's file at a mental hospital, sheds light on the enigmatic Leonard Shelby and his past.  The package also provide some hidden instructions for viewing the first disc. The menus on the disc are presented as a series of slides from a mental competence exam, but an extremely strange one whose questions are not always answerable. The first disc has a few hints that point at the various sub-menus. This brings us to the second disc.
The second disc is similar to the first, with the same moving slides of the exam, but is completely without instructions or even hints of any kind. The viewer is forced to paw around confusedly looking to see what special features they might stumble upon. This is an artistic decision that borders on cruel, but fits with the overall ethos of the film. Hidden among the many unanswerable questions is a version of the film with all the scenes in chronological order, which does much to deepen your understanding of the film, should you find it (or, like me, look up how to get there on the Internet)
While the second disc fits the overall artist approach of the film, it is frankly an unacceptible case of viewer torture. The features are worth finding, but not worth the huge investment it would take to do so. But I am sure Chris Nolan loves that I react so strongly to it. Because it is a tremendous movie, and the special features are unique and very good, I give the disc the 5-star rating, but ONLY because the needless complexity of the second disc can be beaten by an Internet connection.",1073952000,3,3231,4.749110320284697
1325666,5,B00003CXZ3,"I got Mememto for me and a friend to watch, and I found the movie to be VERY GOOD! Of course I found myself confused in some parts, but you have to think about it, and at least have to see it twice to understand what is going on in this film. The movie consists of Leonard, a man who after his acccident can not remember things that happen as recent as 10 minutes ago, so he takes pictures of people, places, and things and jots down notes so that he can see what he has to do.
 Now the movie plays BACKWARDS, it is like what one reviewer said; it is like going to sleep, having dinner, having lunch, going to school, having breakfast, and waking up. Leonard is looking for the guy who murdered and rapist who raped and killed his wife. Now the chase is on, I am not going to give away the ending, but this is a GOOD movie, and not to be taken light of. You have to think about what is going on, and just when you think you had it solve, there is another twist which makes it more interesting. It is like a good detective story with great twists, and I recommend this movie who are interested in a good mystery. Good movie.",1073606400,,1123,4.058558558558558
1325667,4,B00003CXZ3,The hype about this film is the plot twist however it does not turn out to be half as good as what people where saying about it. It is a good ending to a film in a Hitchcock sort of way but does not come close to the twist scene in the Usual Suspects but it is still leaps and bounds ahead of say - Identity. The film is mostly shot in reverse and that is a very cool concept that is committed to the screen in a very daring and remarkable way.

1325669,5,B00003CXZ3,"Why oh why did this NOT win best Original Screenplay?  It's one of the most complex films to come out in recent memory and it loses?(I think it lost to Almost Famous, which was equally good). Anyway enough griping, this was innovative. A movie that starts you off with the last chronological event and working backwards. So imagine having Sleep, Dinner, School, Lunch, School, Breakfast in that order and you get the picture.
Leonard Shelby is tracking down his wife's murderer and rapist.  He fought with the assailant only to have his brain screwed with. See, he can remember everything up until the accident but everything afterwards disappears, like if he were to shower, 10 minutes later he'd literally forget he took one.  So to help him out, he takes pictures of places and pictures with notes in order to keep track of who's who and who to trust.
It got quite a lot of attention due to the rather unorthodox way of showing a film(final scene first, first scene last in a time aspect), and also its twist at the end. Once it unfolds towards the end, you really see how the rest of the film came together...if you can remember it.  Problem with this kind of way of showing and also its benefit is that sometimes you forget how Leonard got to a particular place or why he was there, making the benefit of repeated viewings.
If you wanna work your brain for a change, instead of the ""jerking off the ego"" movies that have come out recently, give this one a watch.",1072483200,7,1467,4.524528301886792

GHD was the story of a man locked in a world that had no memory, each day starting at zero and where he is held prisoner even if he is the only truly free agent. Memento turns this idea inside out so that the main character himself  has to relive each day anew, standing still as the world moves around him. In one he is the focus of change as others are the unchanging scenery - his world externally resets - while in the other he remains the same as the others develop and transform before our eyes - his world internally resets. In GHD imprisonment is physical (he can't get away from the town) with time the only tool: the lack of physical consequences for his actions is comic. In Memento imprisonment is in time with the physical the only tool (his photos, notes and tattoos): the lack of psychological consequence for his thoughts is tragic. In GHD the central character learns to use the world to his advantage and his journey ends when he is ready for acceptance (he goes through the seven stages of loss). In memento the world learns to use him to its advantage and his journey continues when he refuses acceptance - Teddy's speech at the end.",1071792000,,1248,4.522123893805309

This is a puzzle movie, if you prefer to have a plot spoon fed to you and a nice neat round up of events in the final scene that explains it all then continue browsing for something else.
Otherwise this is the movie for you... I won't outline the plot as to do so would be to mentally prepare you for what comes next or should that be before :-)
This DVD has a hidden easter egg (use google) that allows you to view the movie in the *wrong* order. If you have already seen Memento then this hidden gem makes this DVD worth the price alone.

1325702,5,B00003CXZ3,"I think that Memento is to be seen by generations to come as one of the most intriguing and best thrillers done in history. After  seen it, you won't be the same. In a certain way, we all have our episodes of amnesia which disturb our daily life and make us sometimes feel embarassed and/or upset with ourselves. We say to ourselves and to friends that our memory was not the same it was some years/months ago. Where the hell did I put the keys? My credit card, where is it? What was the maiden's name of my wife? But the questions asked on Memento are quite different from the simple ones we ask ourselves: Who is the murderer of my wife?, is the initial question. The second, sure, is Where is he? But things gets progressively complicated to a man enmeshed in such a personal tragedy and say he has no short term memory, and who uses as his very personal notebook nothing more than his own body. A good idea, isn""t it? The best way to remember things when you don't have memory at all, is to tatoo things in your own chest, left arm, right leg and so on. Stand up and read your body in the mirror and you will gonna have all the answers. Who killed your wife, where is he, etc... Or not? When to begin? When to stop? So many questions, so many answers. Somehow akin to Blade Runner in asking many intriguing questions to viewers.

Guy Pearce puts in another fine performance, capturing the manic edge of the protagonist as he struggles to solve the vexing riddle of his identity.  The movie is more about style than substance.  The story itself is rather simple, but Nolan's sharp editing makes it a movie to remember.",1070236800,2,629,5.137254901960785
1325705,5,B00003CXZ3,"True movie making innovation is achieved in a film called Memento. Unfortunately, it is almost impossible to review this movie without giving away some key points. The film does not tell the story in the usual chronological order, but rather alternates scenes from the beginning and from the end of the story, one after another, until the movie ends at the middle of the story. Confused yet? Let me explain.
The movie begins in color with the first scene showing a developed Polaroid picture. Someone's hand shakes the Polaroid, but each time it shakes the picture is fading out. We soon see that the scene is literally going backwards. The next scene is in black and white and a man is in a hotel room. If you are closely paying attention, you realize that the black and white scenes are moving forward in time, while the color scenes are moving from the future, backwards, at the same time. The movie's conclusion has the black and white and the color scenes meeting up at the same point in time, so the movie ends at the middle of the story.
The crazy scene sequence tells an interesting, edge-of-your-seat story. We meet a man, Leonard Shelby, who cannot make new memories because of injuries suffered when he and his wife were attacked. His wife died in the attack, and Shelby has set out to find his wife's killer. Because he cannot make new memories, Shelby takes Polaroid pictures of almost everything to remind himself of the people he meets and the hotel where he stays. He also tattoos various messages to himself all over his body. The most important of these refers to finding his wife's killer.
Memento is groundbreaking in terms of its innovative, unusual screenplay, which earned an Oscar nomination for best screenplay. The actors do a magnificent job of telling the story and making it very realistic.
If you are a moviegoer who needs the story to be spelled out logically from beginning to end, then you may not enjoy Memento. While the storyline is excellent and the acting is great, the style of scene sequence could leave you frustrated and confused.

1325707,1,B00003CXZ3,"I recently bought this Limited Edition DVD set because I love the film and wanted to watch all the extras that comes with the DVD.

When I got the DVD, it was beautifully design. But when it comes time to play it. Horror! Though the DVD was designed to be viewed like a mediacal file, it was a terrible way to navigate through to get to the extra. Disc 1 was pretty easy. One just needs to hit WATCH and the movie will play.

Disc 2 was a different story. After hitting an icon that looks like a book, it led me through a series of question. I managed to find the Director's Shooting Script that correspond to the film in multi-angle. It was pretty cool. But that was it.

I am still looking to see how I can get to the Original short story, the Trailers and all the extra freebie. But at every turn, all I get was a series of questions that leads to more question. Undoubtably it was fun for the first minute. But very quickly, the frustration sets in. I think the designer forgot that they are designing a DVD that is meant to be watched. What's the point of hidding all the features that no one can find. A bummer...and very disappointing as a DVD.

I would give 4.5 stars to the movie but 1 star for the design of the DVD. Save your money and go get the regular edition instead.",1069372800,23,1282,4.157258064516129
1325708,5,B00003CXZ3,"Let's see, how to begin this review-- how about at the end and move slowly toward the front?  You see, that would be a propos for this film, which takes precisely that approach to tell the story.  It moves from end to beginning, with each scene that the audience sees being the scene which took place before the previous scene.
Well, kind of.  There is also another similar plot line which runs in true time and is mostly the main character, Leonard (Guy Pearce) talking to someone on the phone about a strange mental condition.  No worries about telling the two plot lines apart, because this alternate plot line is shot completely in black and white, while the plot line that runs in reverse is done in color.  The movie alternates black and white scenes with color scenes, which leaves us completely confused for a while.
Not really such a bad thing for this movie, because that's exactly what Leonard feels.  He was a detective living a normal life, when his wife was brutally raped and murdered.  He walked in on the attack and was slammed into a wall.  He developed a strange condition from this injury.  He can form no new memories.  Anything that happened to him before the attack is crystal clear.  Since then, any encounter he has fades from memory within seconds.
To combat this, he uses his body as a kind of billboard, tatooing various facts about the killer all over himself, so he won't forget them as he hunts down the killer of his wife.  He also keeps pictures of everyone he meets and writes notes on the backs to keep straight whether they can be trusted.  Some of the people he meets may not be his true friends, but we don't know that, we are along for the ride.
The two main characters Leonard meets in the movie are Teddy (Joe Pantoliano) and Natalie (Carrie Anne Moss).  Both characters are not who they seem at first, and one wonders if either can truly be trusted.  Kudos must go out to Pearce, who gives an excellent performance as the brain damaged Leonard.  You can sense his acceptance of the reality of his life, yet see the despair just underneath the surface.  Magnificent performance.
Camera work is another plus here.  A couple of neat tricks for us.  The opening scene is of someone being shot with a pistol.  The scene goes completely in reverse, with the bullet going back into the gun and the blood crawling  up the wall.  This sets the scene for the type of storytelling we will be seeing.  Also, I mentioned the two separate storylines.  Watch toward the very end for these to come together.  It will take a careful eye to spot the moment when they do.
The main accomplishment for Christopher Nolan is the ability to structure the film in this way and still leave us a surprise at the end.  Or beginning.  Whatever.  By the time the credits roll, we learn that everything that has gone before may not be completely accurate.  Is that the message?  That memory itself is unreliable?  Perhaps.
Finally, the DVD itself.  Wonderful.  The image is crisp and clear.  The DTS sound is awesome  The discs are loaded with extras although I admit they are a pain to access, particularly disc 2.  You may have to go to a website to fully explain how to access everything.  My favorite feature is the one which lets you watch the whole movie in real time  The black and white scenes all actually happen before the color scenes in real time.  This is evident when you utilize this feature.
In short, this is a must see.  I promise, you will not see anything like this for a long time.  The script, acting, and execution are near flawless.  Go grab a copy of this and get ready to watch it at least twice!",1068768000,,3633,4.492354740061162

My friend who told me about it said it was ""f*?ked up!"", and i understand why she says that, but its F-ed up in a good way. I'm not gonna tell you what it's about, because i know i'll spoil it :) so i'll jus tell u what i think and how i felt.
i'm sooooo sick of films that are predictable. Since watching ""Identity"", ""The MAtrix 1,2,3"" to name but a few, i've become so into confusing thrillers and films that remained with you for a while and kept you interested. it was very refreshing to see another film like that, but it seperates itself from the pack! This is like none other! It's on a whole new level, just like The Matrix is! i like how the film, makes u, well it made me be a part of the film, and i felt it wanted me to feel how lenny felt-the frustration, confusion, anguish, also the HOW and WHY, did this just happen? backwards style, the film is filmed, which kinda mirrors his condition. Absolute class!
This is one excellent film, but it's not for everyone. If ur a sucker for action-packed, big blockbusters etc, this isn't for you, but if you're willing to see something different, you can't get anymore different! It's so unique-in it's own way- and original. There will never be a film like this again. It's a shame not a lot of people have heard about this film, myself and many of my friends and family being an example! The acting is very good. Guy really does capture his character very well. I couldn't believe this guy used to act in something as sad as NEIGHBOURS!! lol. He has a come a looooong way! Joe and Carrie are also very good!!
P.S It's a ""thinking film"", so you might need to see it more than once, if you're not used to those kinda films. It is confusing. Don't be put off though, cos there are comprehendable parts! It's just putting the jigsaw together. If u are that sucker, i'll think you'll convert. Confusing films are a lot more fun! lol j/k Have patience! it's bloody worth it!",1068508800,,2035,4.315926892950392
1325749,5,B00003CXZ3,"Don't get this backwards, I really did love this movie (the screenplay, the acting, the filming).  It's just I felt a little, um, uncomfortable, each time a scene ratcheted back, and we find the main character in the equivalent position of somebody that's had the ol' shaving cream-and-feather prank done to them while they're sleeping.  He is constantly ""reawakening"" due to his medical condition, and usually it is with figurative egg/pie/shaving cream on his face...he is constantly momentarily confused until he figures out what has just gone on.
He is on a Dirty Harry type of avengement for his wife's rape and murder, but his clothes don't fit right, his car looks like he forgot to buff the wax off, and he's constantly looking for his Life under the couch cushions.  Everybody calls him Lenny, which he hates.  He gets tricked into doing everything from paying for two hotel rooms to carrying out somebody else's vendetta.  Still, you root for the guy, which may make this one huge practical joke on the viewer...you end up feeling at the end of the movie like somebody slipped something in your drink.",1068249600,,1111,4.857142857142857
1325750,1,B00003CXZ3,"Contrary to popular belief, yes you do need to be a rocket scientist to figure out what the heck is going on.  In addition, it was a bore unlike the equally confusing Mullhulland Drive.",1067817600,8,185,4.4411764705882355
1325751,5,B00003CXZ3,"It's not uncommon for a film to start at the end of the story, then explain through flashback what led up to that moment.  MEMENTO starts at the end, but is anything but common, because it then progresses backward in time.  Each 5 to 10 min. segment (shot in color) occurs at a point in time just prior to the one before.  Interspersed within this reverse narrative are B&W scenes in chronological order which, if all put together, lead up to the final segment, which is the beginning of the story.  How could something that sounds so confusing make a watchable film, you might ask?  It's a tribute to screenwriter/director Nolan that he created such a compelling and thought-provoking mystery/thriller from such a framework.  It's rare to find an unconventional approach to film making that really works..and this does.
Guy Pierce is excellent in the role of Lenny, a man who has suffered a severe head injury while trying to defend his wife against an attack by burglars.  This injury has left him incapable of making new memories; he retains nothing for more than 5 or 10 mins.  He can't watch a half hour TV show because by the end, he's forgotten how it started.  His condition is not amnesia; he knows who he is and recalls everything about his life before the injury.  His brain simply won't retain any new experiences.
Lenny's wife was raped and murdered by her attackers, leaving him devastated and filled with rage.  A police investigation turned up a suspect known only as ""John G.""  Of course, Lenny's injury would quickly cause him to forget all of this, so he has his chest tattooed with ""John G. raped and murdered my wife"".  His quest to find and kill  the man who ruined his life is what gives him purpose.  In order to function, he is constantly taking Polaroids and making notes to refer back to after he's forgotten.  The most important clues that he uncovers he has tattooed all over his body.  Lenny's mission is complicated by two people with ulterior motives who take advantage of his dysfunction.  One is Teddy (Pantoliano), a cop helping him find the killer; the other is Natalie (Moss), a woman he meets along the way who he thinks may be able to help him.
Christopher Nolan adapted the screenplay (which was nominated for an Oscar) from a short story by his brother, Jonathan Nolan.  The genius of the script is that it mimics Lenny's handicap in that the viewer doesn't know what preceded the current scene, just as Lenny doesn't know because he's forgotten!  It raises intriguing questions about the role of memory in our perception of reality.  At one point, Lenny is thinking out loud about his predicament.  He wonders how many times he's been reminded and forgotten that his wife is gone.  Imagine learning that a loved one has died, over and over, each time as if it were the first.  ""How can I heal if I can't feel time?""  How can he trust others that he only knows through scribbled notes on photographs?  In a surprise revelation near the end of the film, we find that Lenny can't really ""know"" anything because he can't even trust himself.  Because this film is so unconventional and tough to fully absorb in one viewing, some impatient folks will consider it a waste of time.  But MEMENTO is extremely well made (Oscar nominated for Best Film Editing) and well worth the effort for anyone who appreciates film as art and is not intimidated by complexity.",1066780800,2,3394,4.658823529411765
1325752,3,B00003CXZ3,it was strange going backwards all the time in this movie but it was a greay viewing and Pearce did an excellent job at telling his characters problems. not for everyones taste,1066089600,,176,4.53125
1325753,5,B00003CXZ3,"I've seen this film 8 times. The first time I saw it, the movie ended, and I sat there with my eyes wide open and said ""...Woah."" I then bought this special edition and watched it 7 more times, including the time I watched it in chronological order. Unfortunately, I had my theory about the movie DOWN after 7 viewings, but then the 8th viewing left me thinking too hard, and I lost my theory. I'm so confused. And that's because it's an intricate, complex, mind-numbing film. This movie is utterly amazing. Just AMAZING. We have a guy named Leonard who wants to avenge his wife's rape and death. Sure, that's pretty good, basic but good. But now we throw in something else. Leonard has ""short term memory loss"" because of a head injury he received during his wife's assault. This causes our man Leonard to forget everything that happened after the injury after about 15 minutes. If he meets a person and has an hour long conversation with them, the next day he will have completely forgotten that person. Genius. Now, add this final twist: make the film backwards. So, the scene you're watching came after the scene that you're watching next, etc. Masterpiece. This is my favorite movie, and it takes multiple viewings and maybe some cheating (watching it in chronolgical order) to straighten it all up in your mind. The features on the DVD are wonderful. It has the short story which the movie was based on, the movie in chronological order, photographs of props used, film posters, documentaries. The single problem is that the special edition DVD itself is insane. The first disc which contains the movie lists a bunch of words and you have to choose through each one to find the single word that starts the movie. The second disc has you searching through loads of images and questions that would belong in a psychological exam to find the special features. If it weren't for this masterpiece movie, the DVD would have dragged it down to 4 stars. But what can I say? It's just way too good.",1064361600,4,1995,4.638418079096045
1325754,5,B00003CXZ3,"The film focuses on a man named Leonard Shelby ( Guy Pierce). He is obsessed with finding his wife's killer. On the night his wife was killed, he gets his head knocked while attempting to save her. This causes him to develop a condition. Leonard can only remember everything that happened up until the night of his wife's murder. He cannot make new memories, and forgets everything five minutes after it happens. This forces him to live a life based on a endless supply of notes, poloroids, and tatoos that he puts all over his body. We are introduced to the two main people in his life - Teddy ( Joe Pantoliano) and Natalie ( Carrie Ann Moss). Both claim to be a friend to him, but things are not as they seem. Both Teddy and Natalie have personal reasons behind wanting to help Leonard. Now Leonard must not only track down his wife's killer and deal with his condition, but he must also determine who's friend, and who's foe.
I am a sucker for a good mystery, and ""Memento"" is the most original and well executed mystery film that I have ever seen. The story is suspenseful and extremely complex. I love how Christopher Nolan had the film unfold in reverse. You come to feel very frustrated over the course of the film. However, that is also why the story is brilliant. You find yourself starting to feel exactly how Leonard does. This actually involves you in the film personally, and makes you sympathize for Leonard overall. The film's focus keeps switching back and forth between Leonard's search for the killer, and flashbacks into Leonard's prior life as an insurance investigator and his big case with a man named Sammy Jenkis ( Stephen Tobolowsky). I loved this aspect of the film, because Sammy suffers from the same condition as Leonard's. ""Memento"" is also guaranteed to keep you guessing. The film continually dangles clues in front of you. But since the story is told in reverse, what you are seeing, may not be what it seems! The film could not have succeeded without the performances given from the sctors. Guy Pierce's portrayal of Leonard is one of the best that I have ever seen. It is so realistic, and so convincing, that you come to believe that Guy Pearce actually went through the same thing himself. The fact that he made such a difficult role look so easy, still amazes me to this day. Joe Pantoliano and Carrie Ann Moss are also great. Their performances add to the film's suspense, because you never know what to believe.
Christopher Nolan's ""Memento"" is amazing. The film has great acting, a nice script, an intense, complex story, and an outstanding ending. The limited edition DVD only adds to the already flawless film. This 2 disc limited edition DVD is great because there are mindbenders and challenges you have to go through to get to the film. That brings the meaning of the word ""interactive"" to a whole new level! The special features include a Sundance Channel Documentary, the original short story By Jonathan Nolan, and much more.",1064275200,4,2974,4.677480916030534
1325755,5,B00003CXZ3,"If ever there was a movie that Guy Pearce was destined to play in, Memento is it.  Don't get me wrong, L.A. Confidential was superb, but this is just amazing.  Guy plays Leonard, a man who remembers nothing other than the fact that his wife was brutally raped and murdered.  He is unable to make any new memories, so that leaves him unable to pinpoint exactly who is responsible for this terrible deed that he cannot erase from his mind.  Through a series of tattoos and Polaroid snapshots, he tries to piece together some logic to the events that happen to him throughout the course many days, weeks, months or even years for that matter.  Leonard has no idea.  Shot in black and white and color and told in a reverse-forward manner that will amaze you, Memento has everything going for it.  The limited edition DVD is very confusing, and if you purchase it, be warned.  It's puzzling, but it certainly fits the movie.",1063756800,,919,4.560975609756097
1325756,5,B00003CXZ3,"""Memento"" is an absolute masterpiece of modern film. Christopher Nolan does a perfect job of capturing the emotion and despair of Leonard Shelby. See, the plot goes something like ths:
Shelby is happily married when someone breaks into his house and kills/rapes his wife, while in the process smashing his head against a mirror, damaging his brain and causing him to lose all short-term memory. Shelby then goes on a manhunt to avenge his wife's death. This is made much more difficult by the lack of police cooperation and his condition, which forces him to write himself endless notes, and, for the really important stuff, get tatoos made so he'll never forget.
This premise alone would be entertaining enough, but Nolan decided to do something a little different: He tells the story all backwards and out-of-order. At first this is quite confusing, as the viewer is forced to see things the way Leonard does - in 10-minute sections that reveal the developing plot, intercut with shorter sections that show scenes from Leonard's past. This is crucial to the meaning of the film.
So Leonard finds some assistance in Teddy (Joe Pantaliano - ""The Matrix) and Natalie (Carrie Anne-Moss ""The Matrix""). The problem is, Leonard can never be sure if these ""friends"" are genuinely trying to help him, or taking advantage of him and his condition.
I can't really go into any more detail without giving away certain plot elements. Just do yourself a favor and rent, buy, borrow, steal, or bootleg this movie. ""Memento"" is one of the most exciting thrillers to come out in a loooong time, and will stand as a milestone in filmmaking for this century, and the next.",1063497600,,1654,4.868794326241135

1325788,5,B00003CXZ3,"I kept wanting to hit pause and think about this one, as the backwards story-telling can get to be a bit much at times.  It certainly was worth it, though, to get to the end (actually, the beginning) and see what the filmmakers had accomplished.  The acting is very good here, and the characters are all believable and fascinating.  The most fascinating thing about it is that they've created a film that mirrors the main character's method of keeping track of things--they've made a series of snapshots that continue to answer questions about something we know but don't have any memory of.  And without ruining the ending, they've made us doubt or question virtually everything we've seen up until the final frame.  We'll never know who Leonard truly is or what he's truly done, but this film is a great ride to get to the end (beginning) of the road.",1063497600,,853,4.66

One striking thing about the movie is that Leonard's (the main character's) condition is a mirror of how many people go through life.  Every day is going to be more of the same unless you keep track of where you are and where you want to end up.  I found the movie very inspiring, although in a strange way.",1062979200,,578,4.314814814814815
1325790,5,B00003CXZ3,"I can't explain how ingenius the concept of this movie is.  The film starts out with Joe Pantaliano (Teddy a.k.a. John G.) being killed by Guy Pearce.  Don't worry, that's not a spoiler.  The reason it is not is because the movie runs backwards.  The scenes in color are the things playing backwards.  The reason for this is that the real twists of the movie are revealed at the beginning of the story.  I was absolutely SHOCKED at the end.  Really, this movie is a classic when it comes to suspense and originality.
The synopsis is sort of confusing within the movie, but the basics are quite comprehendable.  Guy Pearce's character has a memory problem, therefore not allowing him to know who to trust and who not to trust, as he cannot form new memories of people, places and things.  He has to write down everything and take pictures of every person.  This also adds to the interest of the movie.  But essentially, he is trying to discover who raped and murdered his wife, his last memory.
Guy Pearce was phenominal, and deserved a 2001 Oscar nomination.  He really was powerful, conveying a memory problem most people probably could not even begin to fathom having to live with.  Joe Pantaliano plays the ""bad guy"" very well.  He makes you dislike him, much like he did in The Matrix.  He has proved time and time again that he is a wonderful talent.  Carrie-Anne Moss was alright as Guy Pearce's confidant of sorts.  She basically runs a bar and helps him find John G., the alleged killer of his wife.  I do often notice how she is a good character actress.  I have seen her in three movies: The Matrix, this movie, and one of my favorites, Chocolat.  In each movie she really plays the specific characteristics of each person well.  For instance, her seriousness and love for Neo in The Matrix was just right.  And her extreme ""uptightness"" in Chocolat really made you angry.  I used to dislike her acting somewhat, but now respect her after seeing more of her work.  I look forward to seeing more of her movies.
Bottom Line: I was surprised that this film did not win anything at the Oscars, but luckily has earned its standing as a true classic among movies. (I give it an A+)",1062720000,,2185,4.529411764705882

1325793,5,B00003CXZ3,"Looking back on all the films released in 2001, I cannot help but remember the promising and captivating indie flick, ""Memento"". The film continues to astound and baffle its viewers with its complex structure and gripping storyline. ""Memento"" was directed and written by the young prodigy, Christopher Nolan, who derived the movie from a short story that his brother, Jonathan Nolan, had previously written.
The story of ""Memento"" revolves around its three main characters, Leonard, Natalie, and Teddy, who are played by Guy Pearce, Carrie-Anne Moss, and Joe Pantoliano respectively. The movie follows Leonard as he searches for his wife's murderer. Leonard cannot form new memories since he was hurt during the ""incident"", rendering him unable to remember anything longer than fifteen minutes. Christopher Nolan uses this disability to his advantage, allowing him to play with ideas of constructed truth and uncertainties as the movie progresses.
The backward sequence of events is one of the film's most innovative elements and makes certain surprises even more astonishing to the audience. It also forces the audience to rely on their own memory to make sense of the plot, which is a great parallelism that heightens the enjoyability of the movie. The use of ""memory"" is one of the film's most noteworthy innovations, but it is only second to the film's complex narrative structure and suggestive postmodern themes that truly set it apart from other films.
Even though the film is very innovative, it can be easily viewed as regurgitated film noir with a new spin. ""Film noir depict a world of pessimism, corruption and hopelessness, and are distinguished by their dim, shadowy appearance and dark overtones"" (Hannsberry, 1998). ""Memento"" fits these characteristics, as it concerns itself with this specific tone and mood. So if you like feel-good movies, you might want to sit this one out.
""Memento"" leaves everything purposefully incomprehensible and debatable to further highlight the insignificance of absolute meaning.  This will drive some of you insane, but for those of you that enjoy figuring out things for yourself and left with your own interpretations of the movie, then you should definitely watch this flick. Although the movie breaks numerous movie norms, I found that it is the movie's obscurity that makes it such a beautiful and noteworthy accomplishment. Christopher Nolan's ""Memento"" is a classic worth remembering, standing on its own two feet as an example of breaking from the norm while delving into serious modes of thought that makes the audience think and feel from a different perspective.",1060646400,2,2622,5.2727272727272725

What struck me about the movie was Shelbys helplessness, he could be used by basically anyone who knew his condition. Then again he needed to be, and let himself be ""used"" to protect himself from his feelings of guilt. Teddy was killed because he became a threat to Shelbys guilt protection.",1058832000,2,661,4.706896551724138

Perhaps it's the best movie of the last 5 years; the best quality of the film is that every time you watch it, you'll discover something new. Definitely a movie that should belong in every movie fan collection.
""Memento"" tells the story of Leonard (Guy Pearce), a man who has lost the most important thing in his life: his wife; she was raped and murder by a man that Leonard refers to as ""John G""; also, Leonard was beaten severely by the same man who killed his wife. The most significant manifestation of Leonard's injuries is that his short-term memory has been destroyed; and now he is hunting John G to get revenge. Because Leonard can't create new memories, he now must store his clues on little notes, on Polaroid photographs, or on his body with home made tattoos. Also, Leonard meets two persons: Teddy (Joe Pantoliano) and Natalie (Carrie-Anne Moss), they seem to help Leonard, but he doesn't trust them completely.
The narrative is told in reverse, ""Memento"" begins with the end of the story, but don't take nothing for granted, there will be a lot of plot twists throughout the movie.

It's amusing that they decided to model the menus after an aspect of the movie, but doing so makes it too easy to miss many of the features on the discs, or two difficult to find features you're looking for.

If you are expecting to kick back and watch passively while the kids are playing in the room, the dog is barking, and you're preparing dinner, then look elsewhere. If you are unable to give your COMPLETE attention to this film, it may well be the worst film you'll ever see. But give it your undivided, and you'll find that it haunts you for days, perhaps weeks, after the credits roll.

If there is just one fault that I can find with the movie, it is that, in the end, when the actual beginning of the story is being told, it's explained just a bit too much.

1325857,3,B00003CXZ3,"_Memento_ is a revenge/thriller that stars Guy Pearce, who turns in a very good performance, in the role of Leonard Shelby, a widower, who has completely lost the ability to make short-term memories since the rape and murder of his wife.  Since Shelby cannot remember anything from one minute to the next, he is forced to develop a system of documenting the clues he discovers during his investigation, including information about whom to trust, or not.  He relies primarily on Polaroids, notes and tattoos in order to help him remember the most important ""facts"" he discovers. Along the way, Shelby is befriended by Natalie, played by Carrie Anne Moss, and Lenny, who is brilliantly portrayed by Joe Pantoliano.
Delivered by director Christopher Nolan as a series of short pieces, which are then strung together in reverse chronological order, _Memento_ is effective in creating for the viewer a sense of Shelby's dilemma in terms of solving the remaining mystery surrounding his wife's murder.  _Memento_ offers a reasonably original screenplay that is well acted on the overall, and, considering that this is Nolan's second film, the directorial work is deserving of praise.  That said, for me _Memento_ started to wear thin about 3/4's of the way through its 113-minute running time.  (FWIW 120+ minute run times tend to be my preference).  Personally, I found the subtexts of the plot rather obvious - not disinteresting, just obvious.  Additionally, I think that _Memento_ would have benefited greatly from a somewhat faster pace.
I rented the standard widescreen edition of the DVD, so I cannot comment on any extras in the deluxe package(s) that may be available.  The picture quality and digital transfer are excellent, as is the sound quality of the DD 5.1 soundtrack.  Note, however, that the audio mix is very straightforward (as befits the movie) and does not make extensive use of the capabilities of modern multi-channel systems.
With all the hype that surrounded this movie, I almost bought it sight unseen a few times.  It's definitely worth a single viewing, though I doubt I'll ever watch it a second time.  Don't get me wrong, this is a good movie - I personally just don't think it's great!  I'm glad I rented it!!!",1056240000,,2236,4.997304582210242

1325861,5,B00003CXZ3,"Memento is one of the few movies which really made me think. The idea behind the movie is amazing - taking the whole story backwards.
And the part when the present and past (the backward story and the frontward story) connect is shown brilliantly.
The movie is about a guy who can't remember anything for more than five minutes - and so he makes notes, tattoos his body, and uses polaroids to assist him. He remembers that his wife has been raped. And so he goes after the killer for revenge. But it is difficult due to his memory.
And this is made more interesting as the whole movie is shown in a reverse order.
After the movie got over - I sat for hours thinking about it. And I re saw the movie the next day to understand it better. And you know what - it was more fun the second time - as I started getting a clearer picture.

And considering that it was a semi-independent film (meaning that it went to indie film fests, though it still had enough money to cast some pretty big names, like Carrie-Anne Moss), it makes me wonder why Hollywood is blowing hundreds of millions of dollars on mediocre films - instead of unforgettable ones like this one.
Memento is the story of Leonard Shelby (Guy Pearce), a man who lost his short-term memory when he tried to save his wife from the man who raped and murdered her.  Intent on revenge, Leonard keeps track of the facts with the help of Polaroids, scribbled notes, and tattoos, which tell him which hotel he's staying in, who he can trust, and who's lying to him.
The story is filmed in Tarantino-like intensity - in short clips, jumping from one story to another.  To complicate things even more, the scenes are shown in reverse chronological order.  You view each scene through the main character's eyes - not knowing what happened earlier.  In the end, everything you took as a given is shaken - and you're left wondering who the bad guys really were and who was telling the truth.
When it was all over, I spent hours working everything out, playing everything in true chronological order.  And the more I thought through it, the more amazed I became.

1325905,5,B00003CXZ3,"Be prepared to watch Memento several times.  There is much more going on than may meet the eye at first glance.  Director/Writer Nolan is doing much more than telling a tale in an innovative fashion.  He is making statements about reality and human experience whether he intended to or not.
The narrative loop in the film, far more than a gimmick, unseats us from the comfortable theater seat and makes us sit up an take notice.  By the end of the film, we have (hopefully!) figured out what exactly is going on to Leonard/Lenny.  It's a shame he has no clue -- or does he?
I've always thought Guy Pearce was a great actor, and this is easily his best work to date (with LA Confidential a close second).  Joe Pantoliano and Carrie Ann Moss are brilliant in the supporting cast.  I just wish this film had garnered more acclaim than it did.
Unfortunately I haven't found any of Nolan's work since to be all that memorable, but he has proven himself to be both insightful and capable of crafting a stunning piece of ground-breaking cinema.
One wish for the DVD -- on Nolan's ""Following"" we had the option of watching the film ""in order.""  I really wanted that option here.  Not that I need it to help the film make sense, but just to get one step deeper into this wonderfully crafted film.

When I first saw this movie i didn't figure it out at first but then i thought about it and figured it out.
Guy Pearce plays Leonard Shelby, a man looking for vengeance on the man who raped and murdered his wife, but the problem is that he cant make new memories so he has to write down, take pictures and tattoo himself to capture vital information for him to remember.  Joe Pantaloin plays John Edward Gammel aka Teddy, who plays a vital role in the movie. Carrie Anne Moss plays Natalie, a woman who is supposedly helping Leonard.

Be warned, because of the complexity of the plot, you have to really follow the film closely. In other words, you probably won't get much out of the film if you're watching it at a party or making-out or talking on the phone or whatever. You have to use a little bit of your brain to piece the movie together.

1325909,5,B00003CXZ3,"Many movies that promise to ""keep you guessing on the very end"" or ""keep you on the edge of your seat"" fail to deliver what they advertise. ""Memento"" keeps these promises.
The story is told through Leonard, a man who is looking for the killer of his wife. Not a very original story - until his condition is revealed, a condition which has robbed him of his short term memory. The man who killed his wife also stole Leonard's memory as well, and his mission is to find the man who did it. As you may well imagine, this task proves to be exceedingly difficult. But as difficult as the task is for him, the task is even more difficult for the viewer, because the sequences are played in reverse - from the ending to the beginning.
This ""backtracking"" is neither annoying or incredibly complicated; rather, it adds to the suspense because nothing is really as it seems. Guy Pierce does an amazing job of playing the helpless Leonard, while Carrie-Anne Moss (you may know her as Trinity from ""The Matrix"") plays her role well as Leonard's twisted informant and lover. Not only that, but there is a powerful message in this movie as to what motivates a man to continue living after he has lost everything.
However, the one thing that made ""Memento"" stand out the most was, without a doubt, its unique form of storytelling. Most movies give you a question at the beginning and an answer at the end.

The movie is told in scenes, chronologically reversed. So now we have a man who can't make new memories with a movie told in reverse. Oh, and it's a Film Noir murder mystery because he's also trying to find the killer of his wife.
Really, you have to fight your way through the story but that's what makes this such a great movie. The ending is a bit of a twister, a snake eating its own tail.

The storytelling is undoubtledly one of a kind. the movie actually starts at the end, where Leonard Shelby (Guy Pearce) successfully finds his wife's killer and executes him. No spoiler here i guess. Then the movie moves backwards about 10 minutes at a time leading to the events happening previously.
In between these 10 minute reversals are black and white segments that actually move forward. these black and white segments more or less kinda introduces the character and his illness bit by bit so that the viewer can make sense of what is happening to the character as each of the 10 minute segments are being played in reverse.
as the black and white segments move forward, and the normal segments moves backwards, they converge into the climax of the movie.
The Memento LE DVD set is a definite collector's item. it has a lot of features that you'll really appreciate. A special feature on this DVD is on the second disk where you can veiw the Original short story and an easter egg where you can actually view the movie in its chronological order! Also, the director's commentary is a useful feature that lets you in on insights into the making of - and the meaning of - Memento.
The DVD's navigation system can be a bit tricky for some users. upon opening the dvd, a series of words flashes by, and you are required to remember those words to navigate the main menu, which is a test of text retention. Actually you don't have to remember a thing since the correct answers are the only ones you can select. Disc 2 is the same but instead of word, it flashed a series of images. no memorization here actually. This can be a challenging and rewarding exercise letting you fully interact with the viewing process. This exercise can actually become frustrating. Because once you've cracked the puzzles on disc 2, this feature becomes inconvenient and irritating whenever you want to access the features again. That's basically why i gave this 4 stars instead of 5
For the technical aspects of this DVD, the sound quality is great. This edition has a DTS 5.1 track on top of the Dolby 5.1 surround track. DVD is presented in high definition anamorphic screen and the picture quality is very good.

Making me navigate through numerous menu screens answering multiple choice questions to find the content is not my idea of good interface design.  If you must do this give me an option to see a real menu.  I had to find a website that ""decodes"" the stupid menu system to know if I'd watched everything on the DVD--I hadn't.  I don't think I should have to crack the Rosetta Stone to watch a movie I've paid for.

Guy Pearce, Joe Pantoliano and Carrie-Anne Moss do terrific work. Essentially an ugly film on multiple levels Pearce in particular creates a memorable person who has short term memory loss. Excuse the play on words but his performance is essential to pulling off the backward plot convention. Joe Pantoliano's character Teddy is immediately (the word greasy comes to mind) not likeable although we do not find out exactly the nature of his relationship with Leonard until the film unfolds it's twists and turns. Similarly Carrie-Anne Moss's Natalie is cleverly plotted and the general theme of the film is equally well concieved and developed. Memento's themes take a bit of time to develop besides the obvious short term memory loss. I won't discuss the themes as they are best seen and experienced by the viewer.
Christopher Nolan's dual screenwriter/director duties serve him well as he allows his cast to work with the material and feed off one another, not a simple thing to do when every scene is essentially new to Leonard also called 'Lenny!'.
The city is generic enough and the look of the film is mostly seedy, film noir. The pace is fast and the script tight. You care for Leonard as his life unravels like a backwards train wreck and in the end you are left stunned.

1325966,5,B00003CXZ3,"Before Christopher Nolan would be tapped to direct a remake of 2002's Insomnia, he directed this modest budgeted thriller that sets bold new standards in mystery and suspense cinema. Guy Pearce (Ravenous) plays a man named Leonard Shelby who is searching for the man that raped and murdered his wife. That alone is pretty much the plot, but what sets Memento apart from other revenge themed thrillers is the fact that the film moves backwards event wise. The film starts out from the end and works it's way back to the beginning, letting the viewer find out not just how something happened, but why it happened. Memento is presented in this form due to the fact that Leonard suffers from a condition received when his wife was attacked that stops his brain from making new memories. Lenny can't remember faces, names, locations, or anything else on his own so he takes Polaroid photos, writes endless amounts of organized notes, and even makes himself home made tattoos. Pearce is simply unbelieveable in his role as the tortured soul Lenny, while Joe Pantoliano (The Matrix, tv's The Sopranos) almost steals Pearce's thunder as Teddy, a man who may or may not be on Lenny's side.

That being said, I'll tell you why I see it as a WOW! Christopher Nolan has created a piece that is unmatched in it's originally and is on par with 'The Usual Suspects' in terms of storytelling at it's finest. The script is tight, and the performances (Guy Pearce...if you haven't heard of him yet, trust me...you will!) are solid.
The fact this film is told backwards gives you an intimate 'bond' with the protagonist, in that you can't remember what happened before either, and this adds a dimension that few films can project. But, you can't 'leave' for a second. If you have to do anything, pause it, because little clues are left all throughout the movie, and the different way the story is told can also leave you feeling lost if you miss some of it.

Everyone is blowing smoke about how they ruined the movie by revealing all this 'Leonards a dirty killer' at the very end. But if you open your eyes, you'll realize they clued us into the ending constantly during the movie. Why do you think Natalie was so mean to him at first meeting? He was wearing the suit of her boyfriend, and driving his car! Why do you think Teddy was telling him not to trust her all the time? Plain and simple, people who gave this movie a bad review, are probably fans of films such as Scream 3 or Ace Ventura. They don't like a plot line and ending you have to think much about. They just like being told what happened and accepting it, no matter how ridiculous. For fans of intelligent AND highly entertaining movies (im not an art house fan) pick this one up.

The plot unfolds both backwards and forwards as Leonard tries to piece together his life. Joe Pantoliano is excellent as Lenny's acquaintance and Pearce himself also delivers a memorable performance.

The movie is in reverse chronological order (if you didn't know already) and tells the story of a man who has no short term memory who is looking for his wife's murderer.  The film has a couple twists throughout, but the main course is the ending (or should I say beginning).
This DVD is full of extra features as you can see by the list that ... provides.  The best of which is a version of the movie in the ""correct"" chronological order.  This version is almost as good as the original movie!  This is like getting 2 movies for the price of one.
I will admit that the menu's are a bit annoying in the sense that it can be difficult to get to some items, but there are navigation guides out there if you need help and you will get the hang of it.
It basically comes down to this: if you like your movies on the edge, innovative and little off kilter, this is the movie for you.

Leonard Shelby (Guy Pearce)searches the murderer and rapist of his wife. The problem is that Leonard hasn`t a good memory,because during the incident with his wife,he wants to rescue her,he gets injury of his head.
A new life begins,because of his bad memory he has to jot down notes for everything. He isn`t able to remember a face,a name or indications to the murder of his wife.
With photos and tatoos,which he makes on his own, he tries to remember things,situations or persons which can be connected with the murder of his wife.

1325993,5,B00003CXZ3,"Everybody can now take a deep breath; it turns out Hollywood still has a few tricks up its sleeve.  In an age of brain-dead cookie-cutter action flicks and puerile teen ""comedies"", it's rare to see a film that flexes its creative muscle and does something new and relevant with motion picture.  Christopher Nolan's suspense thriller Memento does precisely this, and it's a wonderful experience.  The protagonist is Leonard Shelby (played with quiet intensity by Guy Pearce), a former insurance salesman who tries to hunt down the man who murdered his wife and inflicted brain damage on him.  The problem is that he suffers from anterograde amnesia - that is, he remembers everything before the attack, but is unable to make new memories.  He investigates the crime by writing  himself notes, taking polaroids of his peers and tattooing his body.  The movie is sequenced starting with the final events and works its way backward in the colour scenes.  The black and white scenes, however, are chronologically sequenced, with the two types of scenes meeting at the end.  The effect may be disorienting for the first couple of scenes, but it turns out to be much more than just a novelty.  This structure is integral in slowly revealing small surprises leading up to the expected revelation at the end.  The viewer is constantly paying close attention in finding clues to determine who is helping Leonard and who is setting him up.  Not since The Usual Suspects has a thriller commanded the audience to pay such attention to detail.  The multifaceted and often manipulative supporting characters keep the viewer on his/her toes;  the terrific performances by Carrie-Ann Moss (Natalie) and especially Joe Pantoliano (Teddy) do a wonderful job justifying the dubious level of trust that Leonard experiences.  Helpful advice - pay special attention to their body language.  The film is a grim commentary at how we often trivialize our remarkable capabilities; the tragic consequence of Sammy Jankis' condition particularly demonstrates the value of our ability to form memories - which we often take for granted.  What makes this film so relevant is that it refuses to settle for a simple, generic whodunit, using its innovative structure to build a tapestry of clues and characters, and also to ""put the audience in Leonard's shoes.""  It is a film that tempts - some would argue that it requires - repeated viewings, and promotes active discussion long after the credits roll.  Most of all, it stimulates the mind without losing sight that a movie should also be entertaining.  This is a classic example of intelligent movie-making.",1043712000,7,2627,5.065116279069767

I would recommend this movie to just about anybody. The R rating is due to violence and profanity, including a scene with an obscene amount of strong language. I can't say enough about this movie. There is nothing like it. There are no mistakes and it is completely unpredictable. I give it five stars out of five.",1043107200,5,632,4.601769911504425
1325995,4,B00003CXZ3,"Memento is an outstanding effort--both the film-making and acting are superb.  I think many however, would admit [perhaps only to themselves] that this film goes up a few notches based primarily on the fact that it was such a sleeper and went mostly unrecognized by the movie-going public.
If Memento had been promoted the way say...Minority Report had been, i.e., with showy appearances on Oprah and the evening talk-shows, I'm not sure it would be so critically acclaimed by every armchair movie buff [including yours truly of course].  Part of what made Memento so good was the surprise I had because I didn't have enormous expectations.  After seeing the film in the theater, I rented it and didn't feel nearly as enthusiastic the second time through; although I still think it's a very well written, directed, and acted film.
I suppose it's just the nature of having a trick ending...the red herring isn't so persuasive when you know you're being had.  In short, I'm not sure this is the sort of film I'd really want to *own*.  Maybe if I had a friend over who'd never seen it, but even that's no fun really.  It's always better to get something neither of you have seen.  So, I'd say Memento is certainly worth seeing at least once and then a second time to accentuate the fact that you were completely duped the first time around, but apart from that, I'd pass on this as a purchase.
I think I could write a nearly identical review for the Usual Suspects too.  For some reason however, I feel much differently about the Sting for some reason.  Hmm...perhaps there's more to my lack of enthusiasm for Memento than just the trick ending.  Food for thought.

1326028,5,B00003CXZ3,"Far too many times have I heard people praising the pretentious, high-budget films of 2001. The problem with this is that many of these individuals don't really know what to look for in a good film, and only say that movies deserve Oscars because others told them so. Think about it...if The Lord of the Rings or A Beautiful Mind for that matter, flopped at the box office, would it be as highly recognized? The problem is, the Academy is just like these people, and refuse to use their brains or form their own opinions about movies. Which is why Memento, and many other movies of its kind are far too often over-looked by the dull, uneducated masses.
  Yes, when you watch Memento you do have to *gasp* think! Oh, what a concept! If you are one of the few individuals who enjoys a film that challenges them, and makes them question their own opinions about themselves and the world around them, you will fall in love with this film.
  The movie opens with Leanord Shelby (Guy Pearce) killing the man who raped and murdered his wife. Or at least, the man who he thinks raped and murdered his wife. The conflict throughout the film is Leanord's inability to make new memories. Everything, as Leanord so aptly describes it, fades. The film's first scene is the last scene in chronological sequence and the film is stacked so that from there it plays out backwards so that the audience can properly identify with Leanord's illness. Leanord is desperately trying to find his wife's killer, and along the way meets some new friends (Teddy: Joe Pantoliano and Natalie:  Carrie-Ann Moss). Or are they enemies? We are never quite sure until the very end, and along the way, we are desperately trying to piece together Leanord's life, as is he. Leanord is obsessed with finding the man who destroyed his life, and it is something that he can never forget, for it is the very last thing he can remember. One of the saddest and most powerful points in the film comes when Natalie asks Leanord what the last thing he can  remember is. He replies, ""My wife..."" Natalie comments on how sweet that is until Leanord cuts her off with, ""...dying."" It is moments like these that make Memento one of the most brilliant films ever created, and I highly recommend it to anybody looking for a challenging and incredibly involving film experience.

Guy Pearce is excellent -- the entire cast is excellent. No thriller deserves any less effort than the amount obviously, and well executedly, put into this film. Additionally, the film's editing, cinematography, storyline and directing were each very creative, definitely representing more than a mere fresh breath of air.
The film's conclusion, in which the story's ""time periods"" meet to reveal a plot twist that satisfies the viewer but does not end the storyline, is so original and mindboggling that it SCREAMED ""Give me Oscar!"" last March, and was certainly robbed of one.

It is not to state that I am some great intellectual but I do enjoy the act of asking myself questions and trying to come up with the answers. The best way to wind up a film for me is to have a coffee and talk about it with whoever I saw it with. I usually gauge the success of the film by how long the conversation goes on after. An hour is usually the mark of a really good film, that happened with Fargo, Schindler's List. With Momento, I am still talking about it months later...
I enjoy no-brainer films once in awhile too, sometimes it is nice to just sit back and drink in the eye-candy and take it all in at the surface level. But Momento is not this kind of film, which probably explains why this film has not gotten the mass recognizition that it so richly deserves.
I now use this film when I first meet or interview people, and ask them what they think of it, if they've seen it. ... Everyone, like the character in Momento likes to think of themselves as the positive flawless person of thier own stories but really are they, or do we all lie to ourselves to make ourselves happy?

1326032,5,B00003CXZ3,"Before Christopher Nolan would be tapped to direct a remake of 2002's Insomnia, he directed this modest budgeted thriller that sets bold new standards in mystery and suspense cinema.  Guy Pearce (Ravenous) plays a man named Leonard Shelby who is searching for the man that raped and murdered his wife.  That alone is pretty much the plot, but what sets Memento apart from other revenge themed thrillers is the fact that the film moves backwards event wise.  The film starts out from the end and works it's way back to the beginning, letting the viewer find out not just how something happened, but why it happened.  Memento is presented in this form due to the fact that Leonard suffers from a condition received when his wife was attacked that stops his brain from making new memories.  Lenny can't remember faces, names, locations, or anything else on his own so he takes Polaroid photos, writes endless amounts of organized notes, and even makes himself home made tattoos.  Pearce is simply unbelieveable in his role as the tortured soul Lenny, while Joe Pantoliano (The Matrix, tv's The Sopranos) almost steals Pearce's thunder as Teddy, a man who may or may not be on Lenny's side.  Carrie-Anne Moss (another Matrix alumnus) plays a sympathetic soul to Lenny's crisis while hiding ulterior motives, and she gives a knockout performance as well.

It's probably the only movie that would ever work better backwards than forwards, and it has one of the ten most shocking endings in the last decade.  Joe Pantoliano, (from the Sopranos) and Guy Pierce umm... (Memento) light up the screen, while Carrie Anne Moss (The Matrix) better than a girl, though one seen of her's is scary.

Guy Pierce plays a man without the ability to create new longterm memories since he was injured in a breakin where his wife was raped and murdered.  Since then he has taken it upon himself to avenge this great wrong by tracking down the attacker a man he calls "" John G."".  He tatooes ""clues"" that he finds on his body so he won't forget them.
The movie is directed from the end to the beginning, the ending of each scene being where Pierce has forgotten that bit of short term memory. This allows the viewer to feel as confused as Pierce and claw at what is going on along with him.  You cringe when you see how cruel the world can be to him, and you cringe when you see how cruel he can be to the world.  carrie anne moss also gives a great perfomance.

1326036,4,B00003CXZ3,"""Memento"" is one of those relentlessly brainy thrillers that actually require you to think. And it does something else that you don't usually see in a movie: at the beginning of the film, we share our hero's sense of confusion and helplessness. Not only do we not understand what's going on, we're not even sure how to figure it out. Then gradually, we begin to piece together the story, something our hero cannot do. By the end of the movie, we transcend his state of helpless confusion and return to our role as spectators, accompanied by the full realization of just how awful his situation is because we've been there. Unlike him, however, we can return to our linear, cohesive world, while he is trapped in a kind of forever now.

The ending is incredibly sad and I feel for the main character every time I see it, even though I know what's going to happen.
You also get a whole new spin on the story. While people can whine all they want about the backwards thing, the movie goes backwards because it has to. If you watched it in sequence, it really wouldn't have much emotional impact. So, the movie needs the gimmick. If that turns you off, you probably won't enjoy the movie. Go see the new Bond or something if you don't think you can handle a backwards-running movie. Don't get me wrong; it's done well, but some people will probably be lost right from the beginning.
Lastly, it's not all flash and no substance. Great performances all around, and the whole Sammy Jenkis story is really interesting and works well grounding the viewer between the backwards scenes. As for this DVD set, it's not that great. The commentary is boring; Nolan keeps justifying the backwards structure, but someone should've told him that the majority of the people who will listen to the commentary already agree with him and would rather hear about something else.

What he's done here is take a gimmick & imbue it with deeper meaning than it was meant to have. In doing so, he's elevated a simple film noir to the level of existentialist classic and simultaneously reinvented the rules of film noir, a
once dead genre.
  Nolan was smart enough to not resolve the old cliche of the amnesia victim like movies of yore where they just suddenly remember everything & then it's O.K. From the begining of the movie we get clued in that Leonard Shelby is going to be permanently scarred, and so he comes to represent ALL that is wrong with forgetting, including our own absent mindedness.
  It is this hook of the ""unreliable narrator"" that makes the movie endlessly fascinating. We begin to look for the one true cause of Leonard's problem. Is it his injury? Is it his notes? Is it people misleading him? Is he purposely misleading himself?
In Nolan's film they are all dependent on one another, and the movie becomes a Rorshach blot for ourselves, represented by Leonard's constantly looking into mirrors & coming to absolute conclusions that shatter his world farther. He can never accept the tatoos built up over time in lieu of memory without being reminded of his wife's murder (Jorja Fox, later of CSI. Don't blink or you won't catch her). Even ""Teddy""/Lt. Gamel clues him to missing pages only to be blotted out like an incorrect note.
  Plotwise, this movie stands in league with Kurosawa's Rashomon, its complement. In Rashomon, we get an individual questioning witnesses brought forth to tell stories to provide for clues. In Memento, we get clues provided for stories to tell witnesses brought forth to question an individual. Both movies point fingers at relative & absolute judgement being nothing without each other in the pursuit of justice.
  Nolan has reinvigorated film noir as a style for illustrating
modern ills. Rather than using the old black & white shadows & tilted camera angles, however, he uses all the opposite tones, light, colors: the character being sure & naive rather than cynical & doubtful, the loud enamels of modern hotel rooms, instant polaroids instead of newsprint, characters who consider Leonard a nuisance instead of a threat, etc. This isn't completely origional on Nolan's part, Tavernier used it in Coup De Torchon, but Chris realizes its potential here.
  This has become one of my top five films ever. It still affects me.
  What you get with this Limited Edition is Nolan's commentary (sadly left out of the origional) & other behind the scenes stuff. My favorite part of it is the packaging & the convoluted entry screens that play on the theme of a psychiatric file filled with tests of perception that you have to take to play the movie. Not for those who want instant gratification or are easily frustrated, but lots of fun to those of us who like to stoke the paranoid atmosphere of the movie before watching.
  Christopher Nolan is the new post modern Hitchcock.
  A classic in every sense.",1037577600,5,3172,4.760948905109489
1326098,5,B00003CXZ3,"Memento is unusual. It keeps you guessing, but not because the story changes or because you do not (really) know what is going to happen next. It is because you have become like the main character of the story -- your memory is not what you are accustomed to. You realize you know much more than you think, but cannot piece it together. The movie does not play tricks with the camera, as some do to a nauseating degree, rather it plays tricks with time (and, hence, your mind). These are the better kinds of movies. Only ten minutes or so are a little slow (you can see some repetition only so much). Definitely one of those that you want to see -- not as a hot-item summer movie, but as one that you have to see in order to say you have experienced all types of movies. Try it.",1037577600,,778,4.193333333333333
1326099,4,B00003CXZ3,I really enjoyed this movie. I got so involved with the memory loss scenario that I almost convinced myself I'd lost my car by the time I had to drive home. The main issue I have is if the guy is suffering from a condition where he can't form any new memories how can he remember that he has the condition in the first place to make all the notes required???,1036886400,,358,4.056338028169014

1326129,5,B00003CXZ3,"Ever since he incurred a head injury while attempting to stop the rape and murder of his wife, Leonard Shelby (Guy Pearce) hasn't been able to make new memories. He's forced to take pictures of, and write notes on, the people he's met and places he's been. Despite his handicap, Leonard hopes to find those who raped and murdered his wife.
Memento is the most innovative and absorbing thriller to come out in years. It begins at the end, and ends at the beginning. The story is told in segments, where the events of each subsequent segment precede the events of the previous segment. Simultaneously, black and white segments proceed in a chronological order. They're inserted in between the other non-chronological sequences.
Christopher Nolan presents us with a thrilling and provocative noirish screenplay. He expertly looks at how memory can be manipulated, how far people will go to get what they want, trust, perception, and guilt. There are many twists and turns as we're kept on our toes as Leonard searches for those who destroyed his life.
Guy Pearce carries the film on his head and shoulders; he is able to show just the right amount of anger, frustration, paranoia, and confusion in a masterful performance as Leonard Shelby. Pearce is backed up by strong supporting performances from Joe Pantoliano and Carrie-Anne Moss.
Exhilarating and unsettling, Memento is a film you won't soon forget.",1036281600,3,1403,5.0

1326131,5,B00003CXZ3,"I know people who saw ""Memento"" and absolutely hated it. Mainly because the film plays out backwards, and nobody seems to ever know what's going on. But hey, that's why I love it. Guy Pearce perfectly plays Leonard Shelby, a man who has a rare form of amnesia that allows him to remember everything from his past right up until the incident that took his memory away, but makes him forget everything that happened just 15 minutes ago. Throughout the whole film he has only two friends, but are they really his friends? And, since he's searching for his wife's killer but can't remember any clue he may stumble upon along the way, he has them tattooed all over his body. But are they really clues? Who knows. Because Leonard can't remember what went down 15 minutes ago, we're not allowed to know either. That's why the film literally plays out backwards: to give the audience a sense of what it would be like to suffer from a disorder that leaves you bewildered and clueless. It's the ultimate way to interact with a fictitious character. At the film's end, you may still feel bewildered and clueless, but that is what's so great about it - this has never been done before. ""Memento"" has become an instant classic, and was hands-down the best film of 2001. And if you haven't seen it yet, what are you waiting for?

If you like watching the same scene over and over and over and over, each time getting a little longer, then you'll love this movie.  The plot of the story isn't bad once you piece this mess together.  The writer and director are under some misguided idea that if we see the same scenes repeatedly not knowing what the hell is going on, we'll get some idea of what the main character is going through.  B.S.!!! This film is unwatchable!  I'm not against movies that make you think or assemble the plot in a piece at a time.  Great movies like Exotica, Crash, and Vanilla Sky are wonderfully crafted storys that stretch your perceptions of reality and make you think at the same time.  Memento is garbage plain and simple!

I felt like I actually got to know Leonard, probably because he introduced himself so many times to everyone he met.  It is apparent the crew paid attention and thought out what Pearce should do.  There are only a couple times he seems to remember something he shouldn't remember, but they are inconsequential.  There is one character, I won't say who, who actually left me with the feeling he is truly twisted.  This is one of the best movies I have seen in the last few years, and I completely recommend it.

1326136,3,B00003CXZ3,"This movie had me up until the end.  It just wasn't believable--no, I don't mean a reality-based believable, I mean that the character would not have done what he did at the end.  After sitting through this film and getting to care about this guy (even though he was a shmuck), they go and pull that on me.  Yeah, human nature is suprising, but really this was less of a suprise and more of a predicatable hollywood ending. It ruined the whole feel of a very well paced and intriguing movie.  I would have given it 5 stars for it's unique qualities and ability to draw you in, but the ending was anything but unique.  It was intentionally made to please the viewer with a pose of the unique, but it was almost a cliche.  Trying to be somewhat like Seven.  But Seven had already been made, and Pitt's character in that film did what he probably would have done.  For someone with this guy's curiosity, he would not have taken the action that he did.  Why be so into finding out about what happened that you tattoo yourself over every inch of your skin, then go and blow it all with a simple act of unfounded vengeance.  Sure veangeance is a strong emotion, but this guy isn't lazy, he's not tired of the hunt (he can't be, he forgets how tired he is every day), but for some reason he just gives up at the end.  I don't accept that.  It was lame and I feel cheated, not out of my money or time, but out of a promising 2 hours of film that was corrupted by the director's (or whoever controlled him) desire to make an ending that satisfied the masses instead of something true.",1035244800,12,1575,4.265993265993266
1326137,5,B00003CXZ3,"I've already reviewed this movie twice, so I'll just mention some themes I have been uncovering in watching this movie and in reading detailed analyses...
GRIEF.  For me, this one comes home more than the others, yet is the linchpin for all the others as well.  ""How can I heal ...if I can't feel ...time?"" Leonard asks, and I must admit, grief is like that.  You can't feel time.  Which leads to a sense of...
PERMANENT DISORIENTATION.  No matter where you are, you're not completely there.  Everything feels disconnected, effects not lining up perfectly with causes.  Leonard states that ""It's like waking, like you just woke up"" and it is this disorientation, among other things, that leads to...
ALIENATION.  I call this ""Portable Loneliness,"" for it goes with you wherever you go.  In a crowd, on a bus, at lunch with a friend, we Gen Xers and so forth feel alone in a crowd, for we have become convinced through existentialist, post-modernist Deconstructionism that nothing holds together and that only the self is truly real and permanent.  This brings us to...
SELF-DECEPTION.  We lie to ourselves to be happy, and as Teddy says ""We all do it!""  We want to believe that we are good people and that the people we love are good people.  Leonard wanted to believe that his wife was murdered when she was raped so that he did not have to face the truth that (1) he accidentally killed his own wife, and (2) his wife had become an unbearable person to live with after ""the incident"" and tricked him into killing her.  We lie to ourselves.  All of us.
This is apparently not much of a Memento review.  ..  I think it's time we explore the themes that Nolan has woven so discreetly behind the films ...themes so unobtrusive that they can be passed over without a second glance.  As much as an over-the-top person like myself might hate to admit it, that is the sign of truly excellent writing...",1034985600,3,1896,4.608955223880597
1326138,5,B00003CXZ3,"Director Christopher Nolan recieved a great deal of critical acclaim for Momento, and deservedly so. The film is unlike any film before it, and the amount of thought and artistry put into the film make it a true masterpiece.
The film is very unorthodox, for the sequence of events play almost backwards and forwards at the same time, achieveing a somewhat strange viewing experience. Often times it feels like deja vu, and leaves you questioning your own perception of events.
Nolan has really crafted this film into a visual and mental puzzle, giving us clues here and there yet never insulting our intelligence. Joe Pantoliano does a great job in this film, as does Carrie-Anne Moss, but Guy Pearce really does a marvelous job. He uses body language and other subtle devices to make his ""condition"" truly believeable.
The special edition DVD is very nice, as its packaging is very clever and fitting for a film such as this. The special features menu is a giant puzzle which you must decipher to access certain features, and it is very entertaining and enjoyable. A DVD set like this really makes you frown upon the many DVD's being released for big name movies with hardly a commentary track on them but priced twice as high.

1326159,5,B00003CXZ3,"It's difficult to think of a more engrossing movie then Memento. Chris Nolan took a good idea (a man who can't remember attempting to avenge his wife's murder), threw in a gimmick (a slick backward presentation), and created a masterwork. The opening, where a Polaroid undevelops, is a classy lead-in to the style. But that's just the start.
The backwards style is more then a gimmick. The plot is mostly told by ending the scene at the beginning of the prior scene; this is intercut with black and white footage that serves mainly for plot exposition; watch carefully the second time, and you'll see Nolan's genius
Guy Pearce's performance as Lenny, while not the key to the film, is effective. We can feel Lenny's confusion as time and time again he wonders, ""What just happened?"" Carrie-Anne Moss and Joe Pantoliano are equally effective; we are never quite sure why they're doing what they do, any more then Lenny is.
The ending... err, the middle... is one of the strongest and most confusing events in the film. Every thing you witnessed since the first shot of the movie is seen in a new light, questions are answered, and new ones are posed; that this is true in all good Noir does not in any way stifle the questions you find yourself asking as you attempt to decide who had been lying all that time.
All this: the style and substance, plot and gimick, performance and editing, together, adds up to one of the best, most distinctive films of 2001.",1034726400,,1456,4.647286821705427

It seeks, in a word, to make a cold meal appetizing to a new audience and isn't particularly skillful or smart about how it proceeds toward that dubious goal. Here it is people: A willfully perverse disassembly and reassembly of linear narrative is all Memento has going for it. Whoopee! To anyone having even name-dropping contact with Faulkner's The Sound and The Fury, Kurosawa's Rashomon or Welle's Citizen Kane, this alone isn't nearly enough to get the job done. Better people have made the map of this territory; Memento's makers don't know how to read it, plain and simple. Memento looks pretty, projecting depth with tons of style. But it is essentially as slick and vaccuous as movies get. It is Deep Movie Lite. It is Dragonfly for the coffeehouse set.

Lots of people disagree with my opinion on this, and I don't know what to say to them: if Guy Pierce's character doesn't strike you as a totally unacceptable portrait of a human being, you don't really know our species that well.
But up until that phony ending, it's a real nice movie.  The backwards narration forces you to give your full attention, and the result is that you become deeply involved in what's going on.

The whole ""backwards"" premise works amazingly well, and is one of the best ideas ever devised for a film, reminiscant of PULP FICTION. Guy Ritchie is Sammy, a man who loses his short term memory when his wife is murdered and he gets attacked. Joe Pantiliano (THE MATRIX) is Lenny, a guy who may, or may not be Sammy's friend. The search for the elusive ""John. G"" provides for some chilling moments. Sammy's condition forces him to tattoo himself with notes like ""Never answer the phone"", which racks up the tension and pushes the limits of audience's cerebral limitations. One of those films which you have to watch two or three times to fully understand it and get the whole idea, it's endless in it's creative concepts, leaving the viewer surprised and somewhat confused. Director Nolan does the best with the inventive tricks and piecing together the plot machinations.

The Nolan team creates a world which allows the viewer to sympathize with the difficulties of the man, not only living with a memory problem, but also with the unrealized revenge of his wife's murder.
The disorientating method of the presentation of the movie sequences allows the viewer to experience first hand the challenges he faces. It also ingeniously places the viewer into the mind of the the main character, because the viewer only learns the plot at 15 fifteen minute intervals. Not only does the viewer feel disorientated in fifteen minute parcels, the movie moves from the end backwards to the beginning. I have never seen a movie that has been capable of showing the end and then worked its way backward to the beginning without giving away the plot until the very end.

...This is the sequence of events.
1.  Sammy has no long term memory and Leonard, an insurance agent determines that Sammy is faking his condition.  Sammy is also a drug dealer on the verge of a very big deal. The only hint of this in the movie is right before Sammy's wife kills herself when she gets off the phone and says, ""What have you done?""
2.  The drug dealers break into Leonard's house to find if he an accomplise of Sammy's and trying to hide the drugs Sammy was supposed to have.  After all, Leonard says Sammy is faking. If so, Leonard might be the one with the drugs or working with Sammy to steal from the dealers. Leonard's wife is killed before his eyes right when he is shot in the head and loses his memory just like Sammy.
3.  Teddy, a crooked cop and a lier, uses Leonard to find the man doing the drug deal (who is a John G) and kill him for the drug money. No doubt Teddy gave Leonard the name John G. to prompt Leonard to kill the guy.  When John G is dead, Teddy shows up to get the drug money but Leonard takes it instead and steals John's car before Teddy can get it from him.  At this point Teddy makes up several lies to get the money, including the one about Leonard being a self-induced murderer. note: Leonard places the drug money in the trunk of the car he steals and forgets it. Also, Teddy all but says he is the man who killed Leonard's wife.  Leonard then writes down Teddy's License plate number and goes and tattoes it on himself then forgets it all.
4. Natalie is John G's girlfriend, who Leonard killed and she is torturing Leonard and misleading him to get even. During this time Teddy keeps showing up and sending anonymous messages to Leonard to mislead him. Also another guy shows up looking for the money whom Leonard captures and beats up, then lets go.  You are led to beleave this is Natalie's boyfriend; it isn't.
5. Natalie identifies the license plate number as Teddy's and gives it to Leonard.  Leonard then kills Teddy and takes a picture so he won't forget that he finnaly killed the right John G. Right before Leonard kills him, Teddy once again all but admits he is the guy.
Note: Leonard is NOT on a rampage to kill John Gs. With each tattoo he narrows his suspects down. The finnal clue is the license plate number. Leonard will never find another John G with that license plate. At the end of the film, Leonard is onl contemplating the lie Teddy told him, it is not the truth...
... no where in the film was any direct conclusion drawn to any evidense.  This movie keeps you guessing and no matter how many times you watch it, you will never get any concrete evidense to whats going on.  Everything I have said earlier is drawn off conclusions that explain the sequence of the plot. I could think of no other way this film would make sense...
I give this movie three stars because it was intellegently done and very thought provoking.  Few movies today require any conscious thinking to watch.  I liked this movie because it intrigued me. Even though I thought it was bad, it took me a long time to draw that conclusion...

I found the idea of coping with a condition where one has no short-term memory quite intriguing. I felt that Guy Pierce did a really good job of playing a complex role, and Carrie Ann Moss & Joe Pantiliano were pretty good too.
Christopher Nolan does a great job of intelligently directing what must have been quite a challeging movie to make. The editing, central to this movie, was quite smartly done.

Sit back and enjoy this one folks..",1032393600,,465,4.0989010989010985

1326224,5,B00003CXZ3,"The first time I saw this movie I sort of kicked myself on choosing to watch it - I just couldn't understand one single piece of it. You could try to convince yourself about a particular scene, but the next scence challenges you because the movie is presented in a way that you will understand the entire stuff if you watch it from back to front.
Welcome to Memento - a different kind of a thriller. A modern epic by Chris Nolan, that you will never understand if you are watching it for the first time. This is because the scenes are in the reverse order. You'll find two people speaking in a scene as if they were absolute strangers, and in the next scene you'll find that they have known each other before, because a flashback gives you more information about their previous meeting.
This movie is a thriller, and more than the plot, I loved the way it was presented. A true directorial masterpiece.",1031875200,,902,4.4397590361445785

Pierce does a great acting job, and the film doesn't insult your intelligence, it makes you work to follow key plot points. People actually have to pay attention to what is going on, which is something that is highly unusual in ""mainstream"" American cinema.

1326226,5,B00003CXZ3,"""Memento"" is one of my favorite ""hidden gems"" of 2001, and similar to movies like ""Fight Club"", ""The Usual Suspects"", and ""Dark City"", it stands out as one of the most unique.
Guy Pearce plays Leonard Shelby, a man on a mission to find and punish those responsible for the murder of his wife. The problem is that after the murder, he is shocked into a state of short-term amnesia, meaning that his memory is very short term. He meets people, does things, and has encounters that he forgets almost minutes later. To counteract this condition, he covers his body in tatoos, notes, and carries a file full of information that he cannot afford to forget. Who are his friends? His enemies? It is a struggle to make that distinction.
What is most interesting about ""Memento"" is the style in which it was filmed. Rather than starting from the beginning and moving to the end, ""Memento"" is shown in reverse. The movie starts at the ending, and moves backwards to show how things got to this point. The experience one gets from watching ""Memento"" is similar to what Shelby experiences in the movie. A surreal trip, which leaves you dumbfounded at the end.
The acting in ""Memento"" is first rate. Guy Pearce is a very reliable and versatile actor, and this is his best role since ""LA Confidential"". Support comes from two very talented actors, Joe Pantoliano and Carrie-Anne Moss (both of ""The Matrix""). Joe Pantoliano, oddly enough, further pushes his trademark. I won't spoil what it is (it would kill the plot), but think of what happens to him in the end of ""Memento"", and rent his other movies and see how they end up for him.  Where the movie really stands out is the direction, which is a fresh approach on a very old concept (one man's revenge caper).
A lot of my friends didn't like ""Memento"", most likely for the reasons listed above. They were confused, and didn't like the way the movie repeated itself (remember, it moves backwards). True, you must pay attention while watching, otherwise you will get lost. But I encourage you to watch ""Memento"" with an open mind, it is a very rewarding experience.",1031184000,,2102,4.665768194070081

I have no problem admitting that this movie messed with my head. The main reason that I rented it the first time was because I am a big Guy Pearce fan, and I would have been happy just to see how much depth his acting ability has.. But by the time the opening credits were over, and you slowly watched a polaroid ""undevelop"" (turn from a picture to a white fuzz), I knew that I was in for more than I bargained for. Never have I seen a movie that manipulated my feelings more, especially about the characters. When you first meet Guy Pearce and Carrie-Anne Moss, you are given one impression of them, which you figure is the right one (because you've already seen the movie end). However, as the movie progressed, I found my opinions changing completely, until who I thought they were turned out to be completely wrong. With a fast paced and intelligent script, and great performances by all of the leads, this is definetly the mindbender of the year.

Creative, fresh, interesting, with as many twists and turns to keep you guessing and never for a minute regretting seeing this movie!  The acting is good, the directing is superior, and the plot keeps you on your toes.
I don't want to give anything any but the gist is the central character has a unique form of amnesia - he cannot, no matter how hard he tries, make new memories due to a serious blow to the head.  He is trying to find his wife's killer...how he goes about this is the premise of this film.  He has discovered some very creative ways with which to tell himself how the investigation is going.
One tip - the film is played out in an interesting way that can leave you dumbfounded at first, but once you get the hang of how the movie plays out it's easier to follow.  You may have to watch it twice before it all clicks into place!

This DVD version, like the Canadian bare-bones edition allows you to view the movie in chronological order of scenes should you wish or if you are still confused after the first viewing, but I recommend that you watch it the way it's intended first. As someone who's also designed and programmed DVD's, one feature of this limited edition is to be be either given high praise for it's design or extreme displeasure for it's navigation. To access anything on the 2 discs, you are presented the options for DVD navigation cryptically like a series of pshychiatric tests. Thank goodness for the Internet and it's multitude of websites that have mapped this labyrinth out for you. From a design-sense it's brilliant, but navigation wise, I can see why many despise this disc and the designers should have presented the viewers with an easy navigation menu system as well.

1326274,4,B00003CXZ3,"A great director is born! The sign of a true artist is to take a simple story or scene and recreate it masterfully. That, in short, is what Christopher Nolan has done with what would have otherwise been a by-the-numbers film noir tale.  Memento sticks with you like a bad head cold. You just can't get it out of your system long after you've seen it.  The endless plot twists, the ingenious editing ploys, the ambiguity and mystery of each character, the backwards tatoos, and oh that cool Jaguar! All superb! Memento is the thinking man's mystery movie.
Guy Pierce gave the performance of the year. This was arguably the most difficult role in years. Here's why: Guy had to play a character that a) did or did not rape and kill his own wife, b) if he did kill his wife, he had to hide it behind the deer-in-the-headlights performance, but that would be difficult since he has forgotten the details of the murder thus he would have to invent conceit from fleeting bits of memory, c) if he is innocent, as an actor, Guy can't give away that he is innocent otherwise he gives away the movie. So how do you play a guy that might or might not be innocent of a crime that he doesn't remember committing or maybe he does but has conveniently forgotten. See what I mean? Guy Pierce deserved the Oscar if for no other reason than he delivered an impeccable American accent (the guy's Australian).
This is about as close as modern filmmaking will get to duplicating the effects of Hitchcock's masterpieces. Hitchcock literally took us inside his character's mind by going to great pains to show the story unfold from the character's perspective (Vertigo, Spellbound, Rear Window, etc.) Christopher Nolan accomplishes similar results with the visual trick of looping back every 10 minutes and repeating the action because the character's short term memory only lasts about 10 minutes then he has to re-create his life again. This goes on throughout the entire film (and possibly ad infinitum). We never actually solve the mystery which is the most frustrating and yet most deliberate part of this film. You, the audience are actually supposed to figure the mystery out. You are, believe it or not, required to think through this film. I know, I know, we're supposed to think? At a movie?
The character played by Carrie-Anne Moss is actually similar to the character of Constance played by the gorgeous Ingrid Bergman in Hitchcock's 'Spellbound'. She too had to help an amnesiac, played by Gregory Peck, regain his memory.
Memento has some sidesteps that confused and frustrated me. For instance, the ending was a bit abrupt and could have been more skillfully explained. Saying that Leonard ""raped"" and murdered his wife was probably over-the-top and made me wonder why would a husband rape his own wife first and then murder her? It cast doubts in my mind that Leonard committed the crime because most crimes of passion don't involve raping your wife first. The black and white flashbacks of the old man were a distraction and a side story that I have yet to piece together. Some eagle-eye observers on the internet spotted Teddy in the background of those flashback scenes. Did Teddy kill Leonard's wife? Did Leonard kill his own wife and then kill Teddy to shut Teddy up? Will Carrie-Anne Moss go out with me?",1029369600,2,3302,4.7508710801393725
1326275,5,B00003CXZ3,"I was able to buy this DVD when it appeared in my Amazon Gold Box (having a one-year-old in the house, the Gold Box is the only way I can buy DVD's anymore!), and I could not refuse the [inexpensive] price I was offered.  I'm very glad now that I opened my Gold Box at the right time.  Even at full-price, this is a must-see film.
My first introduction to director Christopher Nolan's work was in Insomnia- another must-see if you haven't already.
As the Amazon review explains, Shelby Leonard (Guy Pearce) is a man with an unusual mental condition that prevents him from creating new memories.  To complicate the situation, he is trying to search for his wife's murderer.  The police won't help him because they don't believe him- as they see it, the case is open-and-shut.
The most effective way Christopher Nolan found to confuse the viewer (as much as Leonard must have been) was to portray the film in ten-minute segments- in reverse.  This technique reminded me a little of Tarantino's jump-around technique in Pulp Fiction, but ""Memento"" was more linear- the end of one segment was the beginning of the previous segment.
Although I was expecting all of this from reading the other reviews here, I was not expecting to get as thorougly confused as I did.  I paid full attention to what was happening, but at the end I still felt like my head was spinning.  I have seen several movies that have left me confused (case in point: Eyes Wide Shut.  I'm sure Kubrick was a wonderful director, but I still don't get the way that film unfolded), but this left me pleasantly confused; I'm still thinking about it several days later, and enjoying the film even more in retrospect.
The entire cast was well-chosen, from Guy Pearce as the fiercely determined Leonard, to Carrie-Anne Moss as the highly intriguing Natalie.  I'm still not sure if she was a ""bad guy"" or a ""good guy.""  Joe Pantoliano (Moss' co-star in ""The Matrix"") was also excellent as John G./Teddy.
Although the beginning of the movie starts with finding out the identity of Leonard's wife's killer, the film is most definitely not that simple.  At the end, the film takes everything you've expected thus far and throws it upside-down.
I don't typically get into ""thinking person's"" movies (neither does my husband), but this was one such movie that I'm sure I will be watching again, to see what I missed the first time around.
For film buffs, the limited edition packaging is also a great perk: it is modeled after Leonard's evidence file in the film.",1029196800,,2515,4.693181818181818
1326295,1,B00003CXZ3,"This movie bites.  I don't usually write a review with such a base and overly simple description, but this one deserves it.  I found nothing what so ever in this movie to like.  Some people have hailed it as the intellect's movie.  That is why I originally wanted to see it.  But, an intellect's movie is good because the movie is intelligent, not because you have to be intelligent to understand the movie.
The precept of the movie, that a man with a memory disorder becomes a hired killer because he'll never feel guilty about what he can't remember, might have been interesting if it had been taken advantage of.  Unfortunately, I think the precept probably never actually made its way onto the screenwriter's desk.
The film makers wanted to do something different by starting at the end and moving the the beginning.  Well, I guess they did something that hadn't been done before.  Perhaps they should have thought a little about why it hadn't been done before.  The sum effect for me was simply irritating, as I was forced to watch the same footage over and over again, as it eventually lengthened to the beginning (which was actually at the end).  Did you get all that?
The acting was ok, but who cares in a movie so annoying and stupid.  Don't buy this movie, don't even bother to watch.  If my review still hasn't clarified the movie for you, just go to a thesaurus and look up all of the synonyms for pretentious and stupid.

1326296,5,B00003CXZ3,"This review will only deal with the features found on the ""Memento Limited Edition 2 Disc Set"", and not the merits of the movie proper.
-------
My only qualm with this DVD edition is the packaging.  Wrapped in a tight-fitting but flimsy cardboard box, designed to look like Leonard Shelby's case file, it's almost impossible to get the discs out on first try.  I find that I have to open the back to push out the innards, which tends to warp the shape of the box.  Found inside are several loose sheets of paper, which look like psychological tests, notes from the case history, and, as you will soon see, the DVD's on-screen menus.  The whole thing is ostensibly held together by a little plastic paper clip, whose only real purpose, I've deduced, is to get lost behind my TV set.
The first thing one notices once Disc 1 of the DVD loads is a psychological test, asking the viewer to commit to memory a list of words that will go flashing by on the screen.  Don't be alarmed.  Although Chris Nolan and Co. have set up the DVD to look like a series of tests, you really don't have to read through or pay much attention to everything on the screen.  However, because sometimes they can be quite entertaining, I suggest you do.  ""Why are these people laughing at you?"" asks one question.  ""We know you did it,"" ominously states another.  This edition can get trippy if you let it.
After the memory flash, you are then asked to select from a list of words the ones you didn't see.  Like I said, this isn't really a test, but an ingenious way to present the disc's main menu.
Selecting WATCH plays the movie.  Selecting READ allows you to choose between English or Spanish subtitles, while LISTEN allows you to hear the movie in either English or French, 5.1 Dolby Digital or DTS 5.1 Surround Sound.  CHAPTER sends you right to the scene selection option.  And COMMENTS turns on Christopher Nolan's Director's Commentary track.
In my review of the commentary track for ""Following"", Nolan's first movie, I called his delivery ""monotone... somnolent at times"" but that he's ""so smart and precise about what he's saying you can easily overlook that and become engrossed in the content.""  I can say pretty much the same thing here.  Except that, in some ways, it's a less effective track.  Nolan spends a lot of time analyzing the story, deconstructing the main character, his motivations, the structure, etc.  They are the kind of out-loud thoughts a screenwriter might use when figuring out his screenplay, but serve little purpose for a viewer watching the film (okay, I suppose prospective screenwriters will get some value out of it).  It is thrilling to see how Nolan's big brain works, how he's thought through every situation, and has a reason for including everything in the movie.  But it's just one note played over and over for an hour and a half.  If Nolan had mixed things up a bit, included more anecdotal information, or behind the scenes goodies, it would have been a stellar track.  As it is, it's got a very narrow appeal.

Disc 2 begins much the same way that Disc 1 did, except this time you are asked to view a series of pictures, and then are asked to select which picture from a list wasn't shown.  This is, as I'm sure you have guessed, the menu for the additional material features.
Selecting the COMPASS shows you a behind-the-scenes photo gallery, as well as pages from Leonard's Journal.  The BOOK allows you to read Nolan's script while listening to the audio track of the movie.  You are even privy to the notes he made in the margins of the script, offering further thoughts on how scenes might be filmed.  The GLOBE brings forth a whole mess of international promotional material, while the BINOCULARS give the option of viewing the international and North American theatrical trailers.
Selecting the SKULL starts a featurette, produced by the Sundance Channel, called ""Anatomy of a Scene"".  Nolan, his editor, composer, producer, cinematographer, and one actor (Joey Pantoliano) discuss the whys and hows of the production.  Particular emphasis is given to the opening few scenes, detailing how they were set up to gently bring the audience into the aesthetic of the film.  Overall, the 25-minute segment further cements the notion that Nolan is an intelligent filmmaker, in full control of his cinematic palette.
Although not listed in the features on the DVD box, the much-ballyhooed 'Chronological Version' -- playing the scenes in the order in which they happen rather than back to front -- is here.  Trust me.  I just watched it.  I'm not going to tell you how to find this version, for I think that would be a spoiler on par with giving away the end (beginning?) of the movie.  But I will say that this information is available in several places online, so those of you who get frustrated with the puzzle should easily be able to obtain the answers (if not, drop me an e-mail).  And I must say, ""Memento"" is still quite a gripping tale when told this way.  But it does make Nolan's reason for telling the story his ""gimmicky"" way quite clear.  The problem with this feature, however, is that it doesn't offer you the option of fast forwarding or jumping from scene to scene.  So unless you can watch the whole movie in one sitting, you better not press 'stop'.
If you enjoyed ""Memento"" because it was a complex puzzle of a film, than I suspect you will enjoy this equally complex and even more puzzling DVD version.  I'm almost positive that there is more to this edition than the features I've listed above.

1326298,5,B00003CXZ3,"Memento is an absolutely thrilling movie based on an original screenplay written by Christopher Nolan.  Memento (Latin for ""Remember""), told in a clever backward/forward reverse sequence in 10-minute or so segments, exemplifies quiet brilliance in a completely innovative style that replicates the confusing sequences viewed from the perspective of the main character (Guy Pearce).
Guy Pearce plays Leonard Shelby who witnesses his wife's rape and murder and in the process, loses his ability to retain short-term memories.  From hereon end, Shelby is intent on avenging his wife's death - but he's hampered through his inability to retain any knowledge and relies solely on tattoos and Polaroid photos to ensure the ""truth"".
From the opening scenes where a gun is fired and a man is killed, a fast pace is picked up and maintained.  However, the true exaltation felt is not in watching a scene unfold, but rather in discovering why the scene unfolded.  Critics rave over the astuteness demonstrated by this film as complex characters reveal new sides of their personality throughout the film.
The revelations shown in the final seconds weave the finale to the fascinating storyline that will inevitably catapult a chain of similar films to follow.  In retrospect, the audience can only follow so far as Leonard Shelby can and that's enough to keep you mesmerized in this film for a while to come.",1029024000,3,1397,5.136563876651983
1326299,4,B00003CXZ3,"Over the past six or eight months, people have been telling me that I need to see ""Memento"" and that, given some of my other favorite movies, I would most definately enjoy.  While, it is a very good movie, one nagging flaw prevents it from living up to its potential.
A quick overview--the main character, Leonard, wants revenge for the murder of his wife.  So, he embarks on a quest for revenge.  The only catch is that since his wife's murder, he has no short-term memory (caused by an injury suffered while attempting to save his wife).  He can no longer remember things.  To aid him, he makes notes, takes photographs, and gives himself tattoos, so that he knows what he has seen and what he is doing.  To enhance this, the director tells us the story backwards, that way, we, much like Leonard, do not know what has just happened.
I was reading a review for this movie, by Roger Ebert, and in his review, he brought to light the following question ""If the last thing Leonard remembers is his wife's murder, then how is it that he knows he cannot form new memories?""  This is what did it for me.  This question almost destroys the otherwise excellent plot.
If you discount the flaw, however, and just accept that he just knows, then you are left with a smart and adventurous movie.  The acting is excellent, and the method of story-telling does make you feel like you are in Leonard's shoes.  Discounting the one major flaw, this movie is probably among the best of the year (My vote for 2001, the year this was release, I believe, is the Royal Tenenbaums, but that is a different review).
Ulitmately, this is a great movie, that is taken down just a bit by a slip up in writing.  It is well worth the money spent on it, and will provide a thought-provoking, enjoyable experience.",1028937600,,1784,4.492260061919505

The acting is sensational.

It does an excellent view of putting the viewer on the same level as the main character by showing the movie in reverse. ie. The first scene you see is the last one in the story.
--The folks at Columbia/Tristar really went all-out to bring the viewer into this movie. The menus alone give you a perspective on the story and main character not possible in the theater. This two-disc set gives you everything you'd expect from a special edition: director's commentary; trailers; production photos; mini documentary; 5.1 surround sound, etc. But wait, there's more... It's just hidden within the maze of questions in the psychological exam that makes up the menus on both discs. If you keep searching on disc two, you'll be able to watch the movie in chronological order, which is my reason for buying this special edition. (If they don't edit this out as a spoiler, just select the Clock form the main menu, choose answer ""c"" five times on the questions, then put the pictures of the woman fixing the flat tire in the order of 3,4,1,2.)",1027123200,161,1163,4.757425742574258
1326358,5,B00003CXZ3,"""Memento"" is the ultimate movie lovers flick.  It incorporates the best aspects of classic film noir (circa early 1950s) and turns it on its head with the clever trick of presenting the narrative in reverse.  The movie starts out at the end, with brain damaged Lenny taking revenge by killing the man who raped and killed his wife and who left him brain damaged.  But did he get the right guy?  As the film progresses, it becomes more and more unclear.  When the truth is revealed, the ""ending"" takes on a whole new meaning.
Guy Pearce, the ""other"" Australian actor in ""L.A. Confidential"" emerges from Russell Crowe's shadow with an outstanding performance as the tormented Lenny.  Backing him up are fine efforts ""Matrix"" vets Joe Pantoliano and Carrie Ann Moss, who are Lenny's main antagonists.
Well scripted, well acted, and challengely put togather, ""Memento"" was the best American movie of 2001.",1026950400,2,901,4.933774834437086

I've never seen a movie like this before.  Guy Pearce plays a man who is trying to uncover his past.  He has lost the ability to create new memories (Anterograde Amnesia) due to something in his past.  Thus, each day he wakes up he has to relearn the fact that he can't make these new long term memories.  He has the ability to make short term memories, but his ""slate"" is wiped clean about every 20 minutes.  The movie is a series of events played in revere order, so after the current scene is over, the scene that occured chronologically prior to it is then played.  It's really something that you have to see to experience, but is done flawlessly.

Christopher Nolan hands down, is the best new filmmaker. If you like Memento then you'll also like his latest movie Insomnia. Guy Pearce does a fantastic job as Leonard Shelby. Carrie-Anne Moss also does a great job as the snotty Natilie. And Joe Pantoliano does a good job as the back-stabbing Teddy(or so you think . . .)
This film is absolutly confusing, but in a good way. You have to watch it about 5 or 6 times to really solve the mystery. You have to consider everything. I mean EVERYTHING! If you happen to have the May 22, 2001 issue of Entertainment Weekly then read the article on Memento, AFTER the movie. It helps you consider a lot of things you probably will miss like I did. I have yet to buy the movie but it looks like a keeper!
Heres a little about the storyline of the film:
First off be aware the film goes backwards which is pretty cool. Its put together perfectly. The film is about a man whos wife is rapped and murdered and when he tries to interfere he gets knocked-out. When he awakes he is unable to make new memories, so all he has left is everything that happened before the murder and he is destined to find the man who killed his wife.

That said, Memento takes a couple of basic film techniques and really runs a clinic -- what it does, it does really well, and the performances of the stellar cast are nuanced, memorable, and overall quite excellent.
Film school students: let your hair down and enjoy this one, it's actually very entertaining, very accessible, and at the same time difficult enough that you can admit you liked it. Hollywood buffs: just once, pay close attention to a film -- don't talk, don't get up for food or a bathroom-run, just leave the noggin' on while you watch; it's a great little film, and it may even make you feel like you understand film students better than you did before!",1026259200,,941,4.674698795180723

The first disc is fine, the menu I can understand.  But when you get to the commentary... that's when we start to slide down the surface of things.  See... at the last 15 minutes... the track is backwards.  Like something out of Twin Peaks but not played forward and without subtitles.  Too bad we can't play it in reverse and hear what Mr. Nolan is saying.  For all I know he could be making fun of us for buying this overpriced coaster and listening to his commentary spoken backwards.
  The second disc is a mess.  I was able to find the movie played in chronilogical order, but in the week I had it (I sold it and bought the normal version) I couldn't even access the trailer.  You have to take these tests and if you answer wrong you go to backwards, and there are soooo many questions that it's hard to keep track of the path you're on.

The menu, however, is rather confusing and can be a bit frustrating.  There is nothing that says ""to play movie--click here"" or ""special features here!""

  This is a very well made, very creatively made movie.  It holds your interest throughout, and it twists your mind in every which direction.  This is achieved by showing you 5 or 10 minute snippets of the action in reverse order.  Yes, it begins at the end and ends at the beginning of a very strange day for our hero, which we find out is a fairly normal day for him.  The acting is very convincing and the story will keep you guessing up to the very end.
  On the other hand, as I did, you might be able to figure out what is going on about halfway through if you pay careful enough attention.  I won't give it away, but ever since The Sixth Sense came out, directors and screenwriters have been jumping all over each other to come up with a twist ending to top everyone else's, and if you think about it they are all just giving you a slightly different angle on the same twist.  It was an engaging watch, but you have to ask yourself if it would still be as engaging had it been shown in the proper order?  I realize that it was the intention all along to make the film this way and I do think it is innovative and thought-provoking, but is that the only reason that it is?  Something to think about...
  I can't tell my real gripe about this movie without spoiling it for those who have not seen it, and I will not do that.

He can remember everything up to the attack, but nothing afterwards for more than 10 or 15 minutes before it fades away. Yet faced with the prospect of spending the rest of his natural life as an institutionalized, non-functioning vegetable, unable to heal the emotional wound of his wife's (murder?) because he cannot ""feel time,"" cannot process his pain, our protagonist ""Leonard"" (Guy Pearce) opts instead to focus his crippled consciousness on vengeance - even though he can't possibly remember it when he acheives it - as an ""existential"" redressing of the balance of the crime. ""My wife won't be avenged until her murderer is dead; the act of killing him will avenge her; it doesn't matter if I remember doing it or not"" is Leonard's POV.
So he writes himself notes compulsively and somewhat frantically, since ink on paper must substitute for working memory. The really important stuff he gets tattooed on so that nobody can deprive him of it. He takes polaroids of important people and places and writes cryptic descriptions on them. It's all a way of keeping himself vital.
He actually fares pretty well, all things considered. Pearce's performance conveys a certain inherent sense of humor behind the frenzy of the character in his predicament, such as he would probably require to keep himself even marginally sane within the 15 minute gamut of his consciousness. Naturally, inevitably, he does get swindled in spite of his constant and justifiable paranoia, and because ""Memento"" is a film noir, of course the swindler (well, one of them) is a femme fatale, a spider woman in the grand tradition, played brilliantly by Carrie-Anne Moss. Yet unlike the films of the 40's, the swindle does not destroy him and is ultimately incidental - just another memory-that-was. Leonard's condition renders him amoral, unaccountable and oblivious, a being totally ""of the moment.""
The scene with Moss (""Natalie"") where she shows her true colors, knowing that she can say whatever she wants without consequence, is almost as hilarious as it is vicious and intense and believable.  And the whole movie is composed of similar ""real"" moments - ""it's all in the incidental details that don't seem to matter,"" to paraphrase Leonard himself.
And the way it's edited is perfect. Never before has a mere technical convention - that of beginning at the chronological end of the story and working backwards in overlapping segments - been so effective in conveying the peculiar quality of a character's psychology. You really feel as though you have a sense of what it must be like for Leonard, because you don't really know what's going on either.

Director Chris Nolan presents the plot of ""Memento"" backwards in 10-minute increments to highlight Lenny's fragile memory and confusion.  Thus, as the Amazon.com reviewer noted, what happened is not nearly as important or interesting as why things happened.
The acting is superb on all counts, as each actor plays their role perfectly.

In the opening credits you see a Polaroid of a murdered man that fades away, and then, the movie begins. Of course, the movie starts at the actual end of the story, yes......,  it's told in reverse.  It moves backward, scene by scene,  each scene overlapping the other slightly, just in case you missed something.  The story also has a few extra flashbacks thrown in to confuse us more.  But, these flashbacks are very important and pertinent to identifying with the main character.
This isn't used too often in moviemaking.  It does force one to pay attention though.  It makes the movie patron think,  mentally work a little, and then form your own conclusion about the film's ""message"". The director's vehicle of delivery to the audience was done on purpose, no doubt.
The ending  is appropriate for such a convoluted twist of events.  It's well worth waiting for and your glad you finally got there.  It feels like you've been on a very thrilling ride but your ready to get off now, thank you very much.  Or, you just solved(or not) a difficult crossword puzzle.  Others will just feel mentally challenged, a little confused..... But, so what.  Maybe that's the point of the story.  It's what makes moviemaking and a good story, interesting.  In this case,  maybe a bit bewildering, but very cleverly told.  It's definitely open to a lot of interpretations.  For some, at least.",1025049600,,2174,4.670184696569921

1326492,5,B00003CXZ3,"Memento is not a movie for everyone.  Its nonlinear plot is not a series of flashbacks that accompany a ""time forward"" plot.  It traces the actions of the protagonist- Guy Pearce (L.A. Confidential} back to the beginning of his present state.
Joe Pantoliano (The Matrix) plays the quintessential cypher personality of a manipulator as he guides Leonard to a heart stopping climax.  Or are we following the fantasy of a damaged brain confabulating to survive?  Leonard is driven by revenge - he believes.  His drive and discipline are perverted by Teddy (Pantoliano), by the beautiful Carrie-Anne Moss (Matrix), even the manager of the motel he uses as his home base.
Leonard's loss of short term memory exposes a disturbing riddle of reality.  Do we create our experiences?  Or do we follow our memories to 'paint' our existence?
As Leonard states early in the movie, memories are notoriously innacurate.
So where does this leave Leonard?

Leonard, a man who suffered a freak injury that prevents his attention span from exceeding 5 minutes, is faced with solving the case of his wife's murder. The problem with him is -- are the clues that he finds mere edifices that he uses to inviegle himself into finding ""a killer"" (as opposed to ""the killer"") or are the clues legitimate, and are they properly founded upon? At the end (or the beginning), however, after he finds ""the killer"", he sets off on another parallel journey to apprehend the other killer...In the end, we just realize that he is creating his own reality and the backwards chronology helps to illustrate this point poignantly.

1326494,5,B00003CXZ3,"I really think that we need more movies like Memento.  Memento scores big because of intellegence, maturity, and most of all being unique.  The problem with many movies is that they don't bring anything new to the screen, and don't have any depth or intellegent plots.  At first, Memento sounds like your average everyday movie, it's about a man who's wife was murdered and now he is seeking revenge.  This seems pretty boring, but it isn't, because there is one thing that makes this movie a whole lot more interesting.  Leonard, the man whos wife was murdered, got an injury on that same night, and because of it, he can not make new memories, he can remember everything that happened up until the injury, but everyting else just ""fades,"" as he says.
One more idea that is brought to the movie is that it is shown in reverse, starting at the end of the movie's story and ending at the beginning.  It is a very intellegent idea, because it puts the watcher in Leonards shoes, you know what's going on at the moment, but you have no idea what just happened.  You may think that the movie will be boring because of this, but it left me on the edge of my seat nearly drooling becuase I wanted to find out what would happen next.
Memento's acting is amazing.  Guy Pearce puts on a very convincing performance of a nervous and confused Leonard.  Joe Pantoliano also does a great job as Leonards friend, yet you never know for sure who he is until the end of the movie.  Carrie-Ann Moss plays another one of Leonard's friends who puts on a great performance as a hard-to-impress yet understanding woman.
Memento is flawless, a masterpeice.  Every element that makes up a good movie is present here, it is a deep and intellegent movie that will keep you on the edge of you seat, thinking and always dying to find out what will happen next.  Without a doubt a 5 star movie, original, unique, exciting, and very intellegent, see this movie.",1024790400,4,1932,4.5201149425287355

Alot of people said that this or that didn't make sense but anyone can get the movie the first time if you just have to watch! This movie is an example of Filmmaking. It's not just famcy CGI and huge celebrity names. This movie is based around a plot and the characters who make up that plot. This is a movie you will continue to talk about and recommend until everyone you know has seen it. It's just very well done. The performances are great and the unsequential order of the film made an interesting story even better. I read the short story before I watched the film and there is alot of differences from the story for example he uses sticky pads and a few other things that I won't reveal for those who've not experienced either. I suggest everyone read the story as well to see how it all began. I truly feel this movie should have got more Oscar Noms than it did perhaps for Best Picture. But despite it's lack of accolade's it is as good if not better than some of the films that were so highly praised and recognized.

The final episode of M*A*S*H comes to mind, as does Radio Flyer, but until Memento, these two titles were alone, unique to this subject matter.  Other films have tried, such as Jacob's Ladder, but sadly, this film falls short of the emotional impact found in the first two, and now in Memento.
Simply put, our protagonist is so damaged by grief, so bludgeoned by sadness that he chooses not to remember the event, or denies to the fullest extent the fall out of the tragedy.

1326546,5,B00003CXZ3,"Just watching the innovative style of the film, being played backwards, is enough to behold.  Though it's seems unnatural at first, the way director Christopher Nolan pieces the film together flows really well.  If the unique style wasn't enough, the plot and message of this indie film are both superb.  Here Nolan takes the mystery genre to a fresh level that has yet to be discovered.  A man who's condition cripples him of gaining new memories tries to learn who killed his wife.  This movie also tackles many thought-provoking themes-purpose in life, the selfishness in mankind, trust, and memory.
I really gained a great respect for Christopher Nolan, this being his sophmore film.  I also recommend watching his first feature ""The Following.""  The performances by Guy Pierce, Carrie-Anne Moss, and Joe Pantoliano are all noteworthy.  All three are very believable and do a remarkable job.  This two-disc dvd package is satisfactory, but nothing great.  They make it somewhat of a hassle to find things and none of the extras are spectacular.

1326548,5,B00003CXZ3,"I imagine everybody knows what ""Memento"" is about by now, so I will be brief: Leonard, who can't make new memories due to a brain trauma, is on the trail of his wife's killer. The movie is told in a series of two tales: One, working backward, is the ""current"" storyline, filmed in color, told in 10-minute increments that jump backward. The second, filmed in b/w, which takes place well before the ""current"" storyline, is interspersed between each ""current"" segment, and it runs forward. At the end, both storylines meet.
It's brilliant. The characters are fascinating, with constant surprises (who CAN you trust, the movie asks). There's a delicious sense of disorientation caused by the backward movement, because we don't know any more than Leonard does how he got into each new situation. We, the audience, also see that Leonard trusts his intuition and his skills more than he should (he thinks he's a great read of character, but he makes several very key misjudgments; he thinks he's terribly organized, but he doesn't have photos of nearly everybody he should, and he doesn't even carry a pen in one crisis situation to write something down before it's lost), things that are revealed slowly through the backward takes.
In the end, the movie is an expose of how unreliable memory is. Leonard's own memories of his pre-trauma days are not reliable, but his belief in them is crucial to his well-being. Even when told a very plausible story of what *really* happened, at the end, the audience realizes, with a pang of loss, that this is the beginning of the ""current"" storyline and that Leonard will go the rest of the storyline not remembering what he has gone to so much trouble to discover.",1023840000,3,1699,4.802047781569966

He can remember everything that happened up to the ""incident"" and the ""incident"" is what consumes and motivates his life everyday. The movie starts with Leonard killing Teddy, rightfully played by Joe Pantoliano. The movie laid out in reverse to see not why Lenny killed Teddy but what led Lenny to kill him. The reversal of the chronology is effective in making viewers feel as if they also have no short term memory. The movie is strengthened by another supporting performance: Carrie-Anne Moss as Natalie. In a way ""Memento"" is similar to ""The Sixth Sense"": After you've watched it the first time, you can go back the second and third time and notice things you didn't see before. Highly recommended.",1023840000,,866,4.78
1326551,5,B00003CXZ3,"Okay, first:  I read a review where the person asked:

""But if Leonard can't remember anything after the incident, why does he know his illness?""

Leonard can recall everything up to the accident.  One of his tatoos says, ""Remember Sammy Jenkis.""  Jenkis had the same affliction and Leonard knew him before the accident.

I love this movie because it asks a valid question:

Upon what do you rely to create your reality?

Memories are faulty.

Leonard's memory problem is acute, but studies show that everyone's memory is faulty.  Of the people who are let out of jail when physical evidence turns up to clear them, most were convicted on eye witness testimony.  Eye witness testimony has been shown to be among the least reliable evidence.

The written word calls for interpretation.

Leonard writes things down and even tattoos them on his body.  But, the things he writes down are sometimes helpful, sometimes not, and sometimes call for interpretation and judgment.  After the murder, Leonard finds a note in his pocket that was intended for someone else, which leads him to a bar where strange things happen.

How many debates have raged over interpretations of the Bible?

Emotions cloud your reality.

Leonard gets angry at Tedy and decides to set him up.

We knowingly lie to ourselves.

Leonard writes down false information to get back at Tedy, knowingly lying to himself because it feels good.  Knowing that he won't recall the lie later.

Can't trust what people say.

Tedy is a suspicious character, but he gives Leonard some information that is verifiably true.  Does that mean everything he says is true?  How to tell?

We are open to suggestion.

Leonard's memories change when Tedy challenges him.  Which version is right?  Tedy's, or his own?  Does it mean anything that the power of Tedy's suggestion momentarily causes Leonard to doubt his own version of events that he does remember because they took place before the accident?

Emotions cause us to be used.

Leonard wants revenge, which sets him up to be used by Tedy.  Revenge is also unsatisfying.  The one thing Leonard should forget, he can't.  Impure motivation clouds his judgement and causes him to be a pawn in someone else's game.

Remember Sammy Jenkis.

Sammy -- and Leonard's -- ""condition"" is the human condition.

The fact is -- we all go through what Leonard is going through, but we can see it more clearly when confronted with a character that is going through an extreme illustration of it.

We are all groping through life using unreliable methods to create reality moment by moment.

Just an aside, but I loved the fact that the hotel clerk rents Leonard two rooms.  Usually that's the kind of detail where you walk out of the film and ask, ""why didn't the hotel clerk try to rip him off?""

Great story and great attention to detail.

See this film.

While watching this for the first time, I remember getting really upset with trying to figure out what exactly was going on because I would immediately forget what had just happened in the previous scene. On the second and third viewings, I realized why this was happening. Our minds work in a very linear fashion-we're used to seeing the cause BEFORE the effect. In this film, the cause comes AFTER the effect, which we aren't used to seeing. Add to that the forward plotline of Leonard sitting in the hotel room, explaining his story over the phone and we're left in a constant state of disorientation, constantly asking ourselves ""Okay, what just happened here?""

1326577,5,B00003CXZ3,"Memento is a story told backwards.  The main character is a man without any short-term memory - he can't remember what he did 10 minutes ago, and everyone is a stranger, no matter what they've done.  Each scene begins with our hero blinking his eyes and trying to figure out where he is and what he is doing. Each moment is a little mystery to him, and to the audience.  A system of notes and tattoos that he has given himself add meaning to his life, as he is in fact pursuing his wife's killer.  Each scene is actually the scene before the last, given in reverse order, and each explains what you saw before while introducing a new mystery.  It all wraps up into a mind-blowing ending, the biggest mystery of them all.
It may sound confusing, but it all works, and Memento is fascinating to watch 2, 3 times or more.  Once you've figured out the mystery of who everyone is and what is going on (which can take you a couple of viewings) then you can watch this film just for its wonderful insight into human nature.  The way people change in this story has to be seen to be believed.  This is the absolute best film for peering into the mind of the mentally ill, 'cause for our hero, nothing is wrong except his one weakness, and he tries to compensate for it with intelligence and routine.
The DVD is a good (not great) effort, and I recommend the ""Special Edition"" over this one.  The largest sin is that individual scenes are poorly indexed, so that you can't watch the film ""in order"" and figure out what happened.

I've seen it up close and I can't imagine what they were thinking. You have to play an unending stream of nightmarish games to use the DVD!
The disc with the movie is easy enough to figure if you work it out logically. You'll be shown a quickly edited series of words. Then the DVD will ask you which word wasn't shown to you in the sequence. To start the movie, pick the word ""Watch"" out of the menu. Movie will play.

1326623,5,B00003CXZ3,"It's finally here.  The wait is over.  Now, you can get the special edition of ""Memento,"" which is loaded with tons of cool features and extras.  Not only that, but the movie is also remastered, both in picture and sound.  Is this special edition worth getting?  You betcha!
The picture quality is outstanding!  It's hard to believe that this is a low-budget film.  Somebody wrote a review claiming that this wasn't in widescreen.  I don't know what kind of version that person got, but the one I bought is very much widescreen, so don't let that throw you off track.  To have this movie be presented in full screen would be a crime!  I also noticed how much better the sound quality is.  I haven't had a chance to watch it in DTS, but I'm sure the quality is top-notch.
Before the special features, a little recap of what the movie is about for those who are new to this movie.  Leonard Shelby has a condition.  He has no short term memory.  Everything fades for him.  If he talks to someone for too long he'll forget who that person is and what they were talking about.  Ten or twenty minutes later he'll have no recollection of what happened earlier on.  The twist: he's looking for the man who raped and murdered his wife.  Now, Leonard is armed to the teeth with important tattoos to help him remember important info, and is also armed with a camera to take pictures of those who he encounters.  He only lives for revenge, wanting to find the identity of a killer he can't possibly ever know for sure.  The second twist is that the movie is told in REVERSE order.  So, be warned; this is not a movie you can just sit down and eat your popcorn and relax.  This is a movie that forces you to think.
Now the special features; there's tons of them.  You get to hear director commentary, which is very cool.  On the second disk is where all of the special features lie, but you can't just click on them.  OH NO!  You've got to work to earn them.  Solve brain teasers and puzzles and answer questions very much like a psychological test.  Very cool!  If you're a fan of the movie, you won't mind the work.  Some of the features are a behind the scenes feature, two trailers, pictures, the short story by Nolan's brother, Leonard's journal, and more.  And there are hidden features I have yet to find.  But I did find one that I think will interest you very much.  Know what it is?  Do you?  Yes, there is a way to watch the movie in CHRONOLOGICAL ORDER!!!  It's hidden, so it's not an option you can just select.  It's pretty easy to do.
NOTE: IF YOU WANT TO DISCOVER THE FEATURE FOR YOURSELF, DO NOT READ THE NEXT PARAGRAPH!!
Here's what you do: 1)make sure the second disk is in. 2)click on the clock image that is below the gun. 3)answer the series of questions anyway you please; when in doubt, go with ""C."" 4)you'll be asked to put four images in chronological order instead, put them in BACKWARDS order. 5)need help? here's the order: third image, fourth image, first image, and then the second image. 6)movie will begin to play in chronological order. congrats! enjoy!
I was very pleased with this special edition of ""Memento.""  It was like watching it for the very first time.  If you're a big fan of the movie, then get it as soon as you can.  You will not regret it.  I know I didn't.  This special edition surpasses the original in every way.  See it to believe it.",1022716800,3,3375,4.375806451612903

Nothing in the story is neatly lain out for the film goer.  There are twists, turns and dead ends in the plot that lead you to suspect one chain of events, while another is the actual truth.  The director insists that the viewer pay attention.
Guy Pearce is excellent in the lead role as are all the supporting cast, especially Carrie-Ann Moss as the bartender with ulterior motives.  No one is what they seem as Pearce's character reveals his quest in a reverse chronology.
The combination of short-term memeroy loss and reverse chronology of the storytelling work wonderfully, surprising you and challenging you pre-conceptions.  The editor, who's name escapes me, is certainly to be commended for their work.

HOWEVER, I recommend anyone interested in purchasing this DVD to avoid the Limited Edition at all costs and settle for the original version instead, unless you enjoy spending hours navigating through the pointless and stupid puzzles you are required to solve before you can access ANY of the features on the discs!

1326626,5,B00003CXZ3,Memento was one of the most talked-about movies in the year it was released.  That was how it got popular - people talked about how good it was - not from excessive hype.  That is a decent measure of the quality of a film - not box office takings.  Memento was made on a shoestring budget.  It is fortunate that the creators were able to release a limited edition.  The additional features are well worth the extra amount.,1022457600,,422,4.358974358974359
1326627,4,B00003CXZ3,"Certainly the best picture of 2001. The cast is great and the story is one of the most originals I've seen. But if Leonard can't remember anything later of the incident, why he knows his illness? That makes the story impossible. The DVD is very poor, specially in the spanish version.",1022371200,,284,4.588235294117647
1326628,5,B00003CXZ3,"First, a word of warning, if you decide to buy this film, make sure that you're in the right frame of mind to sit down and watch it. Clear a two hour space in your schedule to watch it, and then add an extra hour or so while you flick back through the film and attempt to come to terms with what you've just witnessed. It really does help to have the brain cells firing on all cylinders for this film!
Memento is one of the most original and intelligent (not to mention funny and profound) films of the last decade. Possibly ever.
The story revolves around the character of Leonard Shelby, (played wonderfully by Guy Pearce), a man who has no short-term memory. Since an attack in which his wife was brutally raped and murdered (Leonard's last memory is of this in fact), and in which he recieved a damaging blow to the back of his head, he has been totally unable to make new memories. Something of a problem when Leonard is utterly consumed by the desire for revenge.
In order to place the viewer in a similar state to the protagonist, the film has a unique structure, beginning at the end of the movie chronologically, and working its way backwards through time in small (10 - 20 min) segments. Viewing the film, you find yourself in the same position as Leonard, desperately seeking the truth about what has happened to him, and willing him on in his strange investigation.
There is also a wonderful kind of twist at the (actual) end of the film, which completely changes your views on what has transpired and no matter how good you are at guessing the ending of films, this one is going to catch you out. How Christopher Nolan managed to cultivate such an intriguing and intricate story as this is astonishing.
The performances of the three main leads are superb. Guy Pearce plays Shelby with the perfect amount of bewilderment, ironic humour, and pathos. It is essential to the way the story works that we feel empathy for his character and his situation, and Pearce manages this brilliantly.
Carrie-Ann Moss puts in a great performance as Natalie, one of the two main characters whom Leonard comes into contact with. She manages to remain ambivalent all the way through the film, and one is never sure whether to trust her or not.
Joe Pantoliano puts in a scene-stealing performance as 'Teddy', the friend that Shelby can never quite trust. Pantoliano's performance, (like The Matrix co-star Carrie-Ann Moss'), is ambivalent throughout, but he manages to remain wonderfully charismatic. He keeps us guessing about what it is that he knows about Leonard and his past all the way through the movie.
The movie in itself would be worth the purchase of the DVD, but the inclusion of an original story by Jonathan Nolan (the directors brother), an interview with Christopher Nolan, the entire shooting script (complete with notes and scrawls written over by various parties involved in the film), as well as a hidden feature by which you can watch the film re-edited in chronological order, it really is an essential purchase.
I can't recommend this film highly enough, particularly to those who enjoy thrillers, or giving their brain a good work out during a film.
How this film missed out in the Oscars is beyond me. Brilliant stuff.",1022371200,,3236,4.698943661971831

The point is, if your memory is bad... forget it!!! If anyone out there has sucessfully unlocked all the features please write in and help us out.
Aside from that, the film looks great. The DTS is as always, the only way to listen. The commentary is essential to understanding some of the meanings behind the movie that you don't always pick up. Thought provoking, bewildering, and any other big word there is. Guy Pearce not only has a memory problem but he's also blonde. If you've found this review confusing, I'm just trying to fit in with the film and the dvd. So I appeal to everyone who reads this. I need help!

""Memento"" shows us his search in reverse, taking us further and further into memories that Pearse no longer has.  This storytelling technique works brilliantly, and never becomes confusing.

This DVD is right up there with the Special Editions that we're served up for Fight Club & Seven (except there aren't 4 commentaries), but here 1 commentary from the MAN - Christopher Nolan, is all you need. As soon as you put in the movie the fun begins. I won't go into detail, but it gets you REALLY geared up and in the perfect mood to watch the movie.
So I pop in the first disc and I get the movie playing, which I haven't watched in about 4 or 5 months. When I first saw this movie - I couldn't stop watching it. Now after having not seen it for awhile, it was all slowly starting to come back to me as I watched and tried to put this puzzle of a movie together again but came up a little short. I felt exactly like Leonard Shelby, I forgot little details and therefore couldn't remember how the story was going to finish(start?) - but I had a vague idea - I just needed my memory to be refreshed by seeing it again.
All I did was watch the movie so far (worth the price by itself) but can't wait to watch the track with Nolan's commentary which I'm going to make the last thing on this DVD that I watch, because I want to psycho- analyze and have more fun with this movie before Nolan tells me everything and puts all my theories to rest. So you get the movie, a commentary track from Nolan - and the rest of the Special Features you will have to find yourself.

1326657,3,B00003CXZ3,"May 18, 2002
`Memento', were it the forty minute film project of an
UCLA sophomore, would've been hailed as the best student
movie ever made.  Had it been produced for a television
anthology program (were there any anthology programs to
be found on television, alas), it would've blown its
viewers away presented at the length of fifty minutes.
As a feature film, however, it is nothing more than a
diverting, clever, but mostly mechanical exercise often
stretched beyond its means to entertain.
You'll spend the first ten minute or so becoming
acclimated to the inverted nature of the film.  From
there you'll spend another ten or twenty guessing the
surprise climax you know is coming (by the halfway mark
I had concocted five possible resolutions, one of which
proved true).  But from thence on, as you might expect,
you become not a little impatient for the film to play
out.  Tightened and cut by thirty percent, `Memento'
would moved at such a breakneck pace that its relatively
familiar crime-story situations and characters would not
have hurt it any.  The actors involved in `Memento' are
fair to excellent, but there's only so much you can do
with detective fiction archetypes.
In these days of media-hype, DVDs, video releases, and
cable channels, movie buffs and professional movie critics
might be suffering from burn-out.  After all, there's
only so many wise-cracking family pets and rule-breaking
cops a person can take.  As a result of this, clever
movies--not particularly great movies, but anything with
a properly screwball delivery--have graduated above
themselves in critical attention.  So it seemed with
`Fargo' and `Being John Malkovich' and `The Usual
Suspects' . . .
. . . and so it is with `Memento', a pastiche of Jim
Thompson-esque crime cliches complicated, but not
deepened, by a fairly original cinematic device.  A
neat little film, but only if approached without
expectations.
It's worth your time.  Just be prepared to spend most of
that time remarking to yourself how clever the film is,
rather than truly falling into the story.",1021680000,3,2066,5.05

Joe Pantoliano was great as the ""good cop - bad cop"" dual personality.  This movie kept me guessing right up to an ending that could have easily come from a John Carpenter flick.

1326659,5,B00003CXZ3,"Chris Nolan's mesmeric thriller, Memento, is a dazzlingly original piece of filmmaking the likes of which Hollywood rarely produces. Each element of the film - from the acting to the editing - is flawless, but Memento's genius is largely based on it's unique style of narrative.
Leonard Shelby (Guy Pearce) is suffering from a rare condition which has erased his short-term memory - or as he succinctly puts it, his ability to make new memories.  The film attempts  - and succeeds  - in recreating the world from Leonard's point of view. Thus, the first scene shows us what actually occurs at the end of the sequence of events that the film depicts - a polaroid of a dead man fading, then the event itself in reverse, a gun swallowing bullets, suddenly the man brought back to life. From then on we start at the beginning of a series of short scenes, each one starting where the next (previous) scene ends. In this way we are able to gain an insight into the bewildering, disorienting view of the world that Leonard is faced with, the only certainty, that his wife was brutally raped and murdered (he sustained brain damage trying to defend her) and that he must find her killer and exact vengeance. Leonard is able to make some sense of the world by writing things down, taking photographs of the people he becomes involved with, and for the really important ""facts"", tattooing them onto his body. Yet each time he wakes up, the only thing he remembers is that his wife is still alive, and the ways in which he is forced to realise what happened are heart-rending.
A tremendous central performance from Pearce allied to a fine supporting cast (Joe Pantoliano, Carrie Ann Moss), taut script, evocative photography and brilliantly paced direction make Memento a truly memorable film, and one you won't want to miss.",1021420800,4,1814,4.734177215189874

Thankfully, I'm sometimes proved, to my delight, to be wrong.  Not to sound too highbrow, but I've watched a lot of movies.

Memento was the most refreshing movie I've seen since <i>The Matrix</i>, which is pretty funny when you consider it has both Carrie-Ann Moss and Joe Pantalione in it.

This movie will entertain you, but more importantly it will make you think.  Think about who you are, what defines you, how people perceive you, and how you perceive yourself.

If you're IQ is higher than 13, you should be able to get some enjoyment out of this movie.  However, if you ever thought Rocky was in danger of losing against Ivan Drago, avoid this movie.

I always hated Guy Pearce, but after this movie and his brilliant performance, I have nothing but respect for him.  Imagine how hard it would be to play this character, let alone be someone who suffers from short-term memory loss.  I've read case studies about things like this, and his portrayal of a man searching for some, any, meaning to his moment-to-moment existence is remarkable and heart-wrenching.

Definitely pay a few bucks extra for the special edition. The main disc is weak on the extras, and doesn't have a DTS soundtrack (DTS is much better than Dolby 5.1 if you have a DTS-decoding receiver).
What is really engaging about this movie are the twist and turns along the way that lead to a very satisfying payoff. The mind-bending going backwards in time bit is an interesting idea, but could easily have been a ponderous disaster in less sure hands than Christopher Nolan's. Each of the 10-minute flashback seens begin and end in exactly the right places. Each new revelation and twist leads logically to the next.
The movie's weakest point is that, in the end, you don't like any of the characters. They are all selfish bastards, in a sense. Hey, but that's film noir for you. If you didn't like The Usual Suspects or Reservoir Dogs, you probably won't like this one. I however loved those movies, and found Memento to be endlessly fascinating.

I prefer more visually appealing screen blockbuster action-type flicks with lots of special effects myself, but there are a lot of classic movies I enjoy, and this one will probably become a classic in its own right.
The overall premise is quite interesting, since the scenes occur in reverse order, as you watch the memory-impaired Guy Pearce try to solve the mystery of his wife's murder. Pearce does an excellent job in the role, as he methodically gathers the evidence and tries to sort it all out depite his memory impairment.
Before his memory defect occurred, he was an insurance fraud investigator, and if it's one thing he learned from his old job, it's the importance of having a system for gathering the facts and considering the evidence. Pearce does just that, and by taking photos and writing notes on them, he is able to remind himself of the facts he has discovered during the course of his investigation and ultimately solve the mystery.
I also enjoyed Pearce's role as the professor in the recent remake of the Time Machine. All in all a fine flick and worth seeing even if you're not into more thoughtful kinds of movies like this one.",1020988800,,1279,4.614035087719298

Each little jump back is packed with revelations about Pearce's character, the identity of ""John G."", the little notes on Pearce's polaroids, the tattoos, and the very nature of his quest to find his late wife's killer.  As each flashback redounds upon the one that precedes it, one really gets the sense of seeing the protagonist's life run itself in reverse, as if through some chronological mirror, and mirrors are a prominent theme throughout the movie.

1326699,5,B00003CXZ3,"I really don't get those reviewers which gave this contemporary piece of originality one star, saying the plot is incomprehensable, acting wooden and so on...
Those are presumably the same people which didn't get ""Usual Suspects"" or ""Matrix"" either. Who cares? It's their loss.
I bought this DVD without seeing the movie, which I don't do very often, but when I read that it won at Sundance, that it has ""backwards"" plot and learned that it didn't earn more than 25 million at the box office (which is  actually a lot with this budget, but low enough to know that it's not for the masses), I knew it had to be good.
Of course, it may be too smart and confusing for an average viewer, but if you like original work with substance that doesn't provide all the answers for you at once, then this is for you...
Plot in two sentences: a man kills another man. Going backwards in intervals of 10-15 minutes we find out why...
The thing everybody overlooks is the fact that by going backwards you really get to understand how the main character feels, since he hasn't the capacity of turning short term memories into long term memory...
DVD itself is superb. Special Features are loaded. By going through all of them you'll see what lenghts the filmakers went in trying to make the charachters believable and the story to check out... You also can read the original story on which the movie was based on.
And finally, there is supossedly a secret function that plays the scenes in chronological order, rather than backwards.
Fantastic!

1326750,5,B00003CXZ3,"Brilliantly directed by Christopher Nolan, who also wrote the screenplay based on a short story by his brother, Jonathan Nolan, this film had to be a huge challenge for all.  The word ""memento"" means ""remember"" in Latin, and the story is about Leonard, so traumatized by a blow to the head after his wife's rape and murder, that he has lost his short-term memory. He's out for revenge and is looking for the killer, but, although he remembers his life with his wife and who he is, he cannot remember anything that has happened since.  He therefore takes Polaroid shots of everyone he meets and writes notes on them.  And he also tattoos things he wants to remember all over his body. The role calls out for an exceptional actor and Guy Pearce certainly does rise to the occasion.  I found myself drawn to him, identifying with his condition, and joining him in his struggle to relate to the world.
The story unfolds backwards, an unusual narrative technique that is tricky to use.  We see a scene and think we understand.  And then there is another scene that has happened prior to it, and it totally changes our perception of what is going on.  Purposely, it is confusing.  And purposely, there are moments of clarity where it all fits together only to become even more confusing in the next scene.  Carrie Ann Moss plays a femme fatal and, as we get to know her, we are not quite sure what her motives are.  Joe Pantolino is cast as in the role of Leonard's buddy, and we are constantly confused as to whether he is friend or foe.
I sat there fascinated as this complicated plot unfolded, enjoying the mastery in which the director led me down different avenues of thought and also introduced questions about the moral issues involved.  By the end, I was absolutely sure of nothing at all, except that I had been traveling on a roller coaster of an experience that didn't have any easy answers.  While I tend to want films to have a beginning, middle and end, and a story line that is easy to follow, this an exception to the rule.  I definitely recommend to those who are willing to explore this unique film, which is certainly one of a kind.",1020384000,136,2145,4.511627906976744
1326751,4,B00003CXZ3,"This is one movie where it pays to pay close attention.  The movie runs backwards.  It starts with the camera focused on a Polaroid instant picture developing-and showing a man who has just had his brains blown out.  The movie proceeds to explain how things got to this point through a series of backward looking sequences that develop the plot in reverse.
Guy Pearce plays Leonard Shelby, hunting down the man who raped and murdered his wife. The problem is that ""the incident"" that robbed Leonard of his wife also stole his ability to make new memories. Unable to retain a location, a face, or a new clue on his own, Leonard continues his search with the help of notes, Polaroid's, and even homemade tattoos for vital information.  Pearce does an exemplary job of projecting he ""condition"" he suffers from and the director provides ample illustrations of how others can exploit his condition.
The suspense of the movie lies not in discovering what happens, but in finding out why it happened, as well as in trying to figure out which of the cast of eccentric and volatile characters are aiding, exploiting or hindering Lenny as he proceeds with his mission.
The acting is uniformly impressive.  This represents one of the best-and best used-ensemble casts I've seen in a long, long time.
The movie moves along at a torrid pace even though there really isn't all that much action.  This is a cerebral thriller. If your idea of a great movie is special effects, bodies, car chases and gun play, is not your flick.
For a movie like this to succeed the editing must be first rate-the jarring backward thrust of the sequences is distracting enough in itself, so the other aspects of continuity that editing can provide must be present consistently.  The editing and direction, for that matter, are both first rate.  The editing also contains the clues that provide the answers to what's really going on.  It bears repeating, this is a movie you have to pay attention to.

The film literally starts from the end and finishes at the beginning and has you more intrigued with every scene completed.
In order for Shelby to remember he creates a system in which he writes down notes and has tattoos on his body which will enable him to find out what is truth and what isn't. This systematic and comprehensive approach by Shelby enables him to determine who he thinks killed and raped his wife.

1326759,4,B00003CXZ3,"Now, Guy Pearce is great.  Joe Pantoliano is great.  Carrie-Anne Moss is great.
But the star of this movie is the storytelling device.  Told in 5-8 minute scenes shown in reverse order, this is a ripping good murder mystery yarn.  But if it was told in order, showing the wonderful twist ending first, there really wouldn't be much here.  This movie is a joy to experience, but I'm left with a sense of ""wait a minute"" when I reflect on the story and how it fit together--there's one unfortunate coincidence that a large part of the story turns on, and it makes the whole thing feel more contrived than clever.
Pearce plays Leonard, a man who can't store any new long-term memories:  if it didn't happen in the last 5-8 minutes,  it didn't happen.  Notes to himself are his only record of events, and the reliability of these notes--even the permanent ones--is constantly tested.  He's riding the knife edge between this moment and the distant past--these are the only worlds he knows, and he lives his life as a victim to the cavernous gap between them.
Now, this character has enormous potential that largely goes unrealized so that the film can concentrate on the plot, which focuses on Leonard's hunt for the man who murdered his wife.
Carrie-Anne Moss is a waitress/love-interest(?) who is involved in a sub-plot that is never fully realized.  Her impact on the main story and the main character is what's important.
The difficult thing is that because of his curious mental problem, no one in the movie can actually have impact on Leonard beyond messing with his head, which everyone in the movie takes an opportunity to do.  (Please note that I said ""everyone."")
All in all, it's an enjoyable tale with a unique storytelling style populated with excellent performances from actors portraying characters whose development was sacrificed to the gods of plot and storytelling.
Yes, this is one that Hitchcock would have wanted to make, but I daresay he wouldn't have done a better job--I think this one's as sharp and tasty as the script allows.  Cheers to Christoper Nolan the director, but jeers to Christopher Nolan the screenwriter, who needs a few lessons developing characters.",1019088000,3,2187,4.849462365591398
1326810,5,B00003CXZ3,"If you've never seen this movie and are planning to, let me warn you: make sure you're awake. You want to remember it, because the first time is the best. You ARE Leonard, because you know exactly what he knows - no more, no less. You must decide whether you trust the other characters using your own judgement, precisely the way Leonard is doing. You may agree or disagree with his assessments, but ultimately, you're as blind as he. There's an ambience to watching this film the first time that you won't be able to capture again, so you'll want to be coherent.
Which isn't to say that this movie isn't excellent the second time around, or the third, or the fourth . . . it's still an enthralling few hours or so. Each time you watch it, you pick up on new nuances that you missed before, so it doesn't really get old. Besides, the acting in this film is absolutely smashing. Guy Pierce is amazing as a protagonist who, while a less-than-perfect individual, is a mirror of ourselves. Because you almost literally become Leonard, Carrie-Anne Moss' Natalie is that much more heart-breaking, leaving you bitter. And who could forget Teddy . . . ah, Teddy. You're never really sure if you can trust him. You want to, but you can't quite manage it. Even after it's all over, and the facts are revealed, you'll still have lingering doubts about Teddy.
Ultimately, this is not a movie for those who like a nice, tidy ending. Nor is it for those who dislike an aftertaste; this film will stick with you for quite awhile. While not a pleasant little movie, it is pure genius, and for those who can handle a bit of cynicism - after all, it conditions you to trust no one, because everyone's out for themselves, and no one (repeat, NO ONE) thinks twice about exploiting Leonard - this is an absolute must.",1018656000,2,1796,4.512269938650307

The only failure this movie has is that by being so creative in structure, it somehow fails to engage the emotional side of the story.  Still, any movie that can actually be logical and consistent and still require the full attention of the viewer to comprehend is worthy of note.

1326818,4,B00003CXZ3,"This film is a sequence of vignettes, shown in reverse chronological order, through which a murder mystery begins to unfold.  The end of each newly witnessed scene takes us to where the prior one ends.  Since the edges of the scenes overlap by a few seconds, we are able to piece them together to form a continuum.
Brilliant in concept, well executed and well acted, this film is a spellbinding puzzle that is engrossing from beginning to end.
Some critics of the film complain that the film's story would be simple-minded and uninteresting if viewed in normal time.  I don't agree.  In any case, the film's ""backwards"" format poses certain limits on story complexity because of the extra mental effort we must go through to piece the puzzle together.  I think the film achieves a perfectly reasonable balance, considering these constraints.
Others say that there are flaws in the plotline; however I believe that a second viewing will convince most observers that there are explanations for most, if not all, perceived anomalies.
As Leonard Shelby, Guy Pierce delivers a fine, low-key performance:  that of a man whose emotions are sometimes grayed by the trauma of a life that has come unraveled.  Shelby is a man who is not completely innocent, but his life has become such a nightmare that he we feel sympathy for him nonetheless.
However the finest performance of the film is by Carrie-Anne Moss.  In the character of Natalie, Leonard's flawed and tragic soul mate, she embodies anger, hatred, vindictiveness, sadness, compassion, and desperation.  And all are portrayed without a single false note.

Despite all its good qualities, and despite the fact that I'd like to go back and figure it out properly, from start to finish, I don't think I will.  The film is so relentlessly depressing, and disturbing that the ending, while clever, and satisfying on one level, brings its own sense of relief that you can get back to normal life.

Those who can't see past Memento's ""gimmick"" of moving backwards in time have missed the point. This is the only way the viewer could possibly experience Leonard's condition - which is the inability to form new memories. By withholding from us the content of the ""previous"" scene, we truly see the world as Leonard does. If the film were run forwards, we would pity Leonard or think him a fool; the movie would simply not work. That said, the movie is run backwards, and it does work - brilliantly.
Memento is about memory - how memory defines us and how we define it. Who are you? Simply put, you are who you remember you are. A slightly more artsy film, ""Dark City"", explores this concept as well, if more fantastically.
Memento's style is that of a ""puzzle flick"". If you enjoyed ""The Sixth Sense"" or ""The Game"", you will enjoy Memento. A series of logical revelations lead us to the start/end, which is ultimately satisfying. The tone throughout is gritty, realistic and dark - noirish, if not downright noir.

Carrie Anne Moss and Joe Pantoliano are even better in key supporting roles. Telling the story backwards from the perspective of the protagonist (who sustained a brain injury that makes it impossible for him to sustain new memories more than a day) is a clever device that keeps the viewer intrigued and involved--unless you're the type who needs to have stories told in a predictable, linear fashion. You piece together the crime mystery just seconds ahead or (or behind) the protagonist. It was reassuring to see this movie sweep the Independent Spirit Awards, and it wasn't much of a surprise that the Oscars largely snubbed it--giving it just two nominations (and no wins) in the writing and editing categories.  Compare this to something like ""Moulin Rouge,"" which some think is so very ""creative.""  Well, I like to see creativity with some substance, not just all surface flash.

1326875,4,B00003CXZ3,"To put it precisely as possible, ~Memento~ is a smart film.
Taken from a short story written by his brother, Christopher Nolan crafted a screenplay and created a film that absolutely requires his viewers to engage and contemplate the story. No passive viewing allowed in this film. ~Memento~ requires full attention and engagement, otherwise there's no point.
The story concerns a poor soul by the name of Leonard Shelby, (Guy Pearce) who has contracted an untenable form of memory loss, due to an extremly violent attack, also leaving his wife dead. The problem with this form of amnesia, is that it is on going: Shelby knows who he is but cannot remember anything else fifteen minutes in the past. He cannot create new memories. Rather than sit in front of the television feeling sorry for himself and watching re-runs of 'Friends', (which, in a way, is another form of amnesia) the man is on an obsessed mission to find his wife's killer.
What would you do in the same position? Shelby's trade-off on actual memory is a brilliant system combining hand written notes, photos with relevant captions; and the real important memories, those of the 'etched' variety, he has made into tattoos. When he wakes up in the morning, it's back to his notes, re-orienting himself to why, what and where he is - this is an existential battle of the highest order, a perpetual war to remain in present time. What I find even more frightening: whom could you trust? These are the film's themes taken to the insane edges of possibility.
Guy Pearce's performance as the empty headed avenger is nothing less than brilliant. Throughout the film, he continued to repeat a subtle gesture - reaching behind his neck under his jacket and adjusting his shirt. The reason for this quirky mannerism is revealed at the end of the film. I mention this to illustrate Pearce's meticulousness as an actor. According to sources, his research as an actor is impeccable, focusing on the finer details of his character. Which begs the question: why not a nomination for best actor? This performance easily ranks in the top five for 2001-2. I believe the Academy has a similar condition to Leonard Shelby: any film released before June 2001 was forgotten and never got a mention. And that's a shame.
The London born director and writer has been dubbed ""norish"", ""meta-noir"" and ""cerebral"". What ever you call Christopher Nolan, the man took a great idea created by his brother and put it on the screen with elegance, charm and intellegence. Impressive.

In MEMENTO, Guy Pearce (L.A. CONFIDENTIAL) plays Leonard ""Lenny"" Shely, a man who is trying to track down his wife's killer. However, Leonard has no short term memory. He can remember everything until his wife's murder, but then his mind is a blank. He meets a new person and within five minutes, he forgets. He goes somewhere then forgets where he's at and why he's there. To help himself survive, Leonard takes Polaroid pictures of everything and writes important details on the back. However, the most important pieces of information he gets tatooed on his body. Lenny's tired of living this way, but must keep on until he finds his wife's killer.
Pearce's performance catches all the nuances of a man who has literally lost his mind. And Carrie-Anne Moss (Matrix) and Joe Pantoliano pull off superb performances in their major supporting roles.
Christopher Nolan's direction is pure genius. The story of MEMENTO is told backwards. At first the idea seems absurd, but it works brilliantly.

1326931,5,B00003CXZ3,"NOTE: Written August 2001
Though 2001 is far from over, it's not to early to say that Memento is one of the Top Ten movies of the year. This outstanding suspense thriller gets just about everything right. It's stylish, tricky, clever and intriguing. It's the kind of movie that makes you think, leaves you guessing and causes you to debate it with the people you watched it with. If it has a fault, it's that it pays no mind to the modern phenomenon of limited attention spans. Pay attention or be lost.
The movie opens with a shot of a hand waving a Polaroid snapshot. But, wait a minute! This photo isn't coming into focus, it's fading away. We are going backwards. Each scene shows what happened before the preceding scene. Because of the marvelous way it is edited, it isn't that hard to follow. The result is not so much one of confusion as it is one that demonstrates how tricky memory can be.
The protagonist, Leonard [Guy Pearce], has anterograde memory loss, which is a condition that makes it impossible to make new memories. This condition is the result an injury he received on the night his wife was brutally murdered. He attempted to save her, or that's the way he remembers it. Now he is on a quest to find her killer. This is an almost impossible task for him. If he meets someone, he won't remember doing so ten minutes later. If someone talks to him too long, he won't remember the first of the conversation. It makes him easy to victimize, and, along the way, he meets several characters who do just that. At the same time, we slowly begin to wonder if Leonard is, in fact, a victim. There is something not quite right with his story.
Leonard's long term memory is perfectly intact. He remember everything from before the injury. He has a methodical personality and uses all sorts of tricks to help him remember things now. He constantly writes notes. He uses Polaroids to remind him of who he has met and where he has been. He even goes so far as to have pertinent facts tattooed on this body, so that when he wakes up every morning, he will remember his mission. It is important to note that Leonard isn't looking for justice. He's seeking revenge.
Guy Pearce is stunning as Leonard. His role is much more difficult than he makes it appear to be because he must create in us empathy and understanding for a character who, because of his condition, basically has no personality we can relate to. How do you relate to someone who never remembers he's ever met you? A bond could never exist. Yet Pearce does make us care about Leonard.
This is director Christopher Nolan's second film. His first, which was shot on video and is in black and white, is so obscure you'd be hard pressed to find anyone who's seen it. After Memento, be promises to be a very recognizable creative talent.
There is something reassuring to me about this movie's success. [People] have voted Memento number eleven on [a] site's list of best movies ever made. While I might not rank it that high on my own list, the important point is that, of the 12,000 plus votes cast, about half came from people under twenty-five years old. This group rated it even higher than older voters. The fact that all those kids can be so impressed by a literate, intelligent movie that has no special effects and no pop music soundtrack is something that others in Hollywood should pay attention to. Perhaps the business would be well served by more movies that challenge their audiences.",1016064000,,3462,4.549679487179487
1326932,5,B00003CXZ3,"This movie came as a huge surprise on me in a very positive way. Once in a while there are screenwriters and/or directors who really want to do something extraordinary to impress the viewers of their production. As an example, Groundhog Day had the main character relive the same day over and over again for ages until he finally got the girl of his dreams in the end, and it worked. Fight Club also gave you an intense story where two very different characters slowly evolved to a movie climax rarely seen, because to most people the answer to all the story's conflicts is to unimaginable. A closer example to ""Memento"" is ""The Usual Suspects"" from 1994, which gave you a very exciting story set in the criminal underworld run by Kayzer Zose, a man everybody fears but no one knows who he is...a lot like the main character in ""Memento.""
The story is about insurance investigator Leonard, who suffers from short-term memory loss. Leonard got injured after intervening on his wife's murder. The murderer was still there when Leonard walked in on them, thus the main character ended up with a cracked skull (figuratively speaking).
The movie's opening scene is where most crime stories would end; the main character gets his wife's murderer. The rest of the movie is built upon the fragments of memories that led Leonard getting his guy, in other words this movie is kind of told backwards, starting from the mentioned opening scene and ending where the whole situation actually begun... sound confusing? Well, I was confused for about fifteen minutes but once I understood what was going on the rest was just pure genius. At one point I asked myself: ""How can a story told backwards actually get more exciting by the minute?"" As much as I would give you some information about this, you really have to see the movie for yourself to actually understand what a gem this really is. The tension curve is always rising, with an ending so surprisingly good that this movie is up there with stunners like aforementioned ""The Usual Suspects"" and ""Fight Club.""

The movies main theme consist of perceptions vs. reality and how the two only briefly come into contact with one another. Our protagonist Lenny, played excellently by Guy Pierce, has a peculiar memory lose condition, and we are forced to relate to his inability (and unwillingness) to face what he already subconsciously knows.  But we don't know that at the time and neither does he. Confusing, I know.
In order to give the viewer a sense of Lenny's (he hates it when you call him that) confusion over his memory condition the film is played backwards so that in each scene we are confronted with no memory of the preceding events, left only with clues that must be put together.
We journey with Lenny the investigator and try to put the pieces together but he ultimately leaves out a key element: his own motives for not wanting to know the truth. The reason for this is that  Lenny instinctively knows that even a terrible purpose is better than no purpose at all, and should he solve the mystery he will be left as a mindless mental patient.
Basically Lenny, with the help of ""Teddy"", are building a mystery using the truth as model for their deceptions.
The black and white scenes give the movie a truly nice touch that threw cleverly threw me off the scent.

Very gimmicky and self-conscious, this film expects the viewer to automatically care about its protagonist and his ludicrous dilemma.  It's true that Guy Pearce may succeed in arousing a very mild affection for his character, but that I think is due merely to the amount of time (depending on one's patience) the viewer spends watching him go through his paces.  Even if the ending were extraordinarily mind-blowing (which it is not), it still would not adequately compensate the viewer for the time invested to get there.  The film is extremely tedious to sit through:  the characters are not interesting, the acting unremarkable, and the dialogue insipid.  Why anybody would sit through this bilge, and why the director assumes people will, is the real mystery.  The film  resembles a poor made-for-TV movie, at best, that you might come across on the USA channel (and promptly dismiss).  It's a perfect example of what somebody must have considered a unique concept with great potential, but alas, this effort fails to realize that potential.  All of the fancy devices like flipping back through time and the alternating use of color vs. black & white cannot disguise how boring and empty the movie is.  All flash and no substance makes Jack a dull movie viewer.  For your sake, I hope you listen to the one voice of reason crying in the wilderness of mistaken notions of effective filmmaking.  Take the two hours you would waste on this [stuff] and watch Snatch instead.  Say what you will of its subtsance, that film, at least, contains, along with its flash, almost nonstop humor and an abundance of compelling character acting.  With a minimum of characterization, Snatch succeeds where Memento does NOT, in showing us why we should (or shouldn't) care about the characters, and then the film keeps us entertained all throughout, instead of having faith that we will respect a single corny concept enough to wait two tedious hours for a payoff that, in this instance, doesn't come.  I give it one star merely to recognize the (misguided) efforts required to make the film, and because I have (I think) endured worse films.

And in the end the two stories meet and when the viewer realizes or thinks they know what happened the black and white story becomes color. Only you really don't know the half of it. Now, for me I figured out a few things before hand so it didn't shock me as much as it probably would have (The first time I saw it was on DVD and I had to pause it a few times so I had extra time to think about it rather than seeing it all at once in a theater), but it was extremely worth every minute and there is still even more twists that threw me off all the way till the absolute end.
Overall it was very impressive and very well done, and to think it was filmed in 24 or 25 days, UNBELIEVABLE!
I think that this movie is a classic. I for one and maybe the only one, think that this movie should have either A) a prequel or maybe even B) a sequel.

actually watching it provides the kind of jolting calm effect akin to last year's other under-rated, alienation-effect piece, ""the man who wasn't there.""

1327064,5,B00003CXZ3,"As of this writing, the subject of this review, Memento, is probably the best film of 2001.
Leonard Shelby has a rare form of short-term amnesia; he can't form new memories. The only thing he does remember is everything in his life up to the night his wife was raped and killed by an anonymous assailant who gave Leonard the head injury that caused his condition. Now Leonard is obsessed with finding him, despite his handicap. He writes notes to himself, takes pictures of important people and places, and even tattoos important facts on his body. He will not give up, even as he wakes up every day not knowing what happened the day before.
With a premise like the one written above, do you really need to read the rest of this review to convince yourself that you simply must go see this movie? The possibilities for great suspense and mystery should be obvious from the premise just given. Memento has the perfect concept for a wonderful mystery, and takes advantage of it through the structure, which is unique, engaging, and central to the film's method of bringing the viewer in. One of the important questions for the film would be, How can it tell the story in an interesting way, and at the same time let us in on Leonard Shelby's world? How can it give us an idea of what it's like to be him? All these questions are solved in one fell swoop with the help of a great, non-linear plot structure.
The film starts with a memorable image: a Polaroid being developed backwards, eventually being put back into the camera by our protagonist, Leonard Shelby, after he has shot someone. This first image sets up the style of the rest of the film: nonlinear and looping back onto itself, the film is split up into subsections of plot that take place after the one following it. So, in essence, we are being told the story backwards, with each subsequent section ending where the previous one began. It's a unique, engaging, and important method of storytelling this film employs, and it never gets confusing or unclear for the audience. Of course, Shelby lives in real time, in constant forward motion, not traveling further and further back in time like we are while watching the film. But in order to capture the essence of Shelby's existence, we have to be given the sensation of suddenly being thrust into a situation without knowing (or in Shelby's case, remembering) what has happened before. We have to be as clueless as he is. That is accomplished through Memento's structure. It's much more than a gimmick; it's a gateway into the protagonist's mind.
From there, the film simply takes off, and never slows down. We are constantly kept alert and engaged in what's happening because we are as clueless as Leonard, and simply because the mystery is so great. His investigation for ""John G,"" the killer, is fascinating and leads to many twists, turns, new alliances, and back-stabbings. Just when you think you have it ""figured out"" (if you're foolish enough to really think so) the film takes a turn and opens up whole new possibilities.
With the smoothness and grace of a film that knows it has a spectacular script, Memento introduces its various themes seamlessly into the main detective-story narrative. What is so immensely enjoyable about watching Memento is that it has so much thematic depth to it; all of the plot's twists and turns only serve to emphasize one of its many motifs. How far can someone rely on his or her memory of something until it starts to become distorted? Shelby's situation is so precarious because he is the most unreliable of narrators; the audience, following the story, is dependant on him for telling the story. Like a cancer, this realization is introduced in the viewer and grows as the film progresses. Shelby is a living, breathing personification of an intriguing philosophical question: can someone live without memory, by just knowing the facts about a situation and going on them? ""Memory is unreliable. Facts are the only thing you can count on,"" Shelby says. He lives that quote, for time doesn't exist for someone like Shelby. Since he can't be aware of the passage of time, not knowing where he has been or how long it's been since his wife died, time really has no meaning for him. His ""time"" is merely the short bursts of consciousness that flare up and die every day. Shelby's condition is one of the most tragic situations any protagonists in film have been in.
The acting is, in a word, excellent, with Guy Pearce wrenchingly inhabiting this character. He's able to be charming, clueless, determined, and gruff all simultaneously. He is a detective trying to figure out the mystery but raging against the confines of his own mind, which prevent him from doing so. He talks to other characters in a polite and nice, but neutral manner, as if unsure whether or not he has actually talked to this person before but just doesn't remember it. It's a quietly intense performance, and the audience feels his pain through it.
I end this review with a mention of the ending of the film. No spoilers here, but not only does it manage to surprise us, shock us, and put the entire story in a new perspective, but it also wrenches the sympathy out of us so naturally because of what it does to Leonard Shelby in terms of his development as a character. To say that we discover a new side of him is to put it lightly; we simultaneously cry out in horror and sympathy at the final, brutal revelation. To say anything more would be wrong. It is the perfect ending to a perfect movie.",1013472000,15,5526,4.668717948717949

1327071,4,B00003CXZ3,"Memento is a great movie.  By reading other reviews, you can get the idea of the plot.  I watched this expecting unique storytelling and a great climax.
Memento begins with a murder and then works its way back through the eyes of Lenny who has know short term memory.  Each scene begins with us not knowing how Lenny got there.  This is appropriate (not a gimmick) since Lenny has no idea either.
I paid attention to each scene trying not to miss any details that would confuse the ending.  But there really aren't any details to miss.  The ending covers all the bases and explains everything, yet there are many unresoved questions, and I think the director Nolan wanted it that way.
While Memento was unique, it was also quite humorous.  Guy Pierce did an excellent job of portraying Lenny.  Lenny seemed so trusting of everyone and since he had no memory of them, he assumed they were always being honest with him.
So while this movie is dark at its core, it portrays an innocence and lightheartedness that makes it fun to watch.

The lead character, Lenny (Guy Pearce - is excellent) has anterograde amnesia, and is seeking revenge for his injury and his wife's murder. He is only cognizant of brief spans of the present, before his short term memory is lost. The film is edited to instill this same feeling of uncertainty of facts, relationships, and self-trust in the viewer. The story unfolds backwards, in brief spans, in a way that grabs your interest in the unravelling, like a top-notch mystery. This is the type of movie that has you still thinking about it hours after it is over. If you love mystery thrillers, or like studying films, this film is a must.
My only disappointment is that the DVD did not have a director commentary audio track. However, it did include an IFC Interview with the director, Christopher Nolan. This includes some insights into this film, the festival showings, and the relationship between this film and his brother's short story. Other extras are ""ok"" -- trailers, and a lot of handwritten notes, stills, and a newspaper article hyperlinked together...largely a time-vampire, much effort you'll spend to get very little insight. The IFC interview was the only good DVD extra.
This is an independent film that leaped from the festivals to the big screens, which is rare. Cinematography, multi-layered story, editing, and acting are the reason for it's success. Supporting actors are Carrie-Anne Moss and Joe Pantoliano (both from Matrix), are excellent. It does have many small twists, including the ending. The twists are non-Hollywood enough that you don't guess most of them.

First, running the story backwards is inticing--a brilliant way to isolate pure perception from interpretation.  Anything that shows how the passage of time affects our memory and opinions is a winner.  What was disappointing was that superimposed over this simple and gigantic concept, was a lot of silliness about murder and personal deception.  The twisting of memory and the concept of time was deception enough.  Overdone.  Maybe shooting for both depth and marketability is not such a great formula.

1327086,3,B00003CXZ3,"the way this movie is filmed is fairly unique; the action sequences are running backwards in time while the telephone conversations of the lead character, Leonard (Guy Pearce) moves forward. the parallel time streams were presented well and the phone conversations are shot in black and white to help ingrain the timing distinction.
however, this movie is a mystery at its core -- a logic puzzle and there are several things that makes the premise unbelieveable. the primary problem is why Leonard is able to run around given that he was connected (victim or not, the degree depends on your interpretation of the film -- but probably a victim if you analyze the tattoos) with one or more homicide. given his condition, it's difficult not to either be released to his closest kin, or be committed... either of which would have prompted a search of a missing, potentially derranged, and dangerous, person.
given his condition, i can't imagine him eluding any kind of manhunt -- he is just so easily remembered. it's also difficult to believe Natalie (Moss) wouldn't turn him in for either revenge for Jimmy or to tie up a loose end with Dodd. there's no reason Dodd wouldn't turn Leonard in (even as an anonymous tip) -- well, maybe not Natalie or Dodd per se but others like them that Leonard's probably met in the past.
for a guy that's so disciplined (to the point of tattooing instructions), Leonard also seem to rarely keep a pen on his person... that's not a short term memory problem, that's logically irresponsible.
finally, it's really reaching that a cop would use such a loose cannon like Leonard, who takes polariod 'momentos' and accumlates so much circumstantial evidence of everyone.
if, however, you sit back and don't think about the film from a logical starting point... it's not a bad movie with some credible acting and otherwise good direction.",1011916800,,1863,4.861635220125786

I can honestly say this went into my best bin along with Priscilla: Queen of the Desert.  Next up (and I am far too pumped about) The Count of Monte Cristo.  not only does Guy seem to be in a great role but the other actors/actrices seem to be great.  Also, (and I thought I was dreaming this one) in March 02, The Time Machine!  I can't believe my favorite actor and one of my favorite old movies coliding into a new movie.

In fact I enjoyed it myself for the most part, but in my opinion, I walked from this movie with nothing.  It was entertaining to see how the movie progressed.  The story that unfolded backward was ingenious, but rough getting started.  The performances were excellent, as was the script.  Guy Pearce, Cary-Anne Moss and Joe Pantoliano all carry the movie so well.  My problem is that the entire movie gets you to sympathize with the character and by the end, you're not sure what to think.  I don't want to give much away by saying anymore.  The movie is obviously leaning toward being artistic, and that's fine.  And I do know something about art, I was an art major in college.  I guess my beef is that the movie is dark and down in it's tone, and many people will not find it entertaining in that respect.  Movies in general are supposed to entertain and with that said, if you don't find dark, moody, twisted and surreal entertaining, you probably won't find this all that much fun to watch.

1327134,4,B00003CXZ3,"This film has one thing that makes it really, truly great - the end clears up the central plot completely and will surprise the audience (MAYBE you can figure the ""what"" but NEVER the ""why"" until the end) while leaving room for interpretation of subplots by the audience. However, lazy viewers beware - the central theme of this film is how we restructure our own past via our memories to make sense of our lives. As in life, not every ""memory"" you will see is ""true"". The cinematography gives the only clues - there is absolutely no atmosphere at all in the main storyline, but the ""flashback"" sequences are stylized based on time, location and condition to help the viewer make sense of the film as a whole. Given some EFFORT, viewers will figure out what is ""true"" in the context of the film. The structure and complexity of the film can throw off a viewer unaccustomed to paying close attention - the story is told backward, each scene followed by the scene that precedes it chronologically, allowing the viewer to share the main characters disorientation. Guy Pearce plays a man who cannot make new memories - he forgets everything he has been through since a horrific incident that cost him his memory and his wife. He keeps himself aware of his progress on the quest for his wifes' killer via scribbled notes, annotated Polaroids and tattoos of the most crucial ""facts"" in his quest. Viewers adapt quickly and the technique actually increases suspense. It also makes the film hysterically and unexpectedly funny in places. The acting is understated - the characters act like people, not actors - quite refreshing. Guy Pearce is perfect trying to convince everyone, himself included, that he ""knows"" what he's doing and has his ""facts"" straight. Carrie Ann Moss is GREAT as a bartender who helps Our Hero - more or less. The only thing keeping me from awarding 5 stars is that the DVD extras are pathetic. You get trailers, a couple (literally, two) pictures of the tattoos of the main character, the film website, a copy of ""Memento Mori"" - the excellent short story on which the film is based - and an interview with director Chris Nolan. The interview is very good, but the only extra worthy of the name. I would have paid extra for an option to play the film in ""real time"", just for kicks. However, the film is excellent and a definite ""buy me"". Finally, I leave with a primer for the unobservant:
** Black and white sequences of Guy in his hotel IMMEDIATELY PRECEDE the film time frame and move in NORMAL time (i.e., forward). All other ""flashbacks"" are keyed to specific time frames and types of events, but to discuss them, I'd reveal too much. Suffice to say, there is a logical scheme to the flashbacks that will tell the careful viewer exactly what happened - more or less - by the end of the film. (...)",1010707200,4,2821,4.632734530938124

NOTE: You will HAVE to watch this movie more the once to understand it all.
That being said, I also want to respond to Afaf's question about the pinch/insulin shot: It was definitely a pinch and he did not O/D his wife like Sammy. Based on the guidelines presented for Leonard's disability, he would recall everything up to the truama. This would inlclude the fact that his wife was NOT a diabetic.

It stars Guy Pearse(L.A. Confidental, The count of monte crisco)Joe Pantiliano(The Matrix, The sopranos television series) and Carrie Anne Moss(The Matrix).
Gur pearse is a man who has no short term memory, so he cant remember anything past 15 minutes. To remembe things, he takes pictures, wirties notes on them and also get tattos on his body. Joe Pantiliano plays a man who is friends with guy pearse, but you never truly know who he is. Finally Carrie Anne Moss plays a mysterious women, who doesnt turn out to be who she really is. The plot of the movie is that guy pearse is trying to find out who murdered his wife.
Sounds simple right?Well its not. The story is told backwards.it gets very confusing. For example:lets say that a scene begins with guy pearse getting dressed, that scene will play and then the movie will go to black and white and he will be talking on the phone. Then, he stops talking another scene happens, and that scene would end with him getting dressed.it continues like that until the end. For most of the movie, you don't know who he is talking to, but when you find out, you won't be disapointed.
The movie is rated R for Violence, Language, and Some Drug Use, so the movie is not for everybody. This might be a movie where you need to watch it more than once to understand it.

Because of his condition Leonard has to continually keep notes, on paper, with polaroids but also with tattoos and notes written on his body, as his only ways of retaining any new information. From day to day he has to rely on his notes to remind him of his progress and trust that they are correct. His life is permanently lived in present-tense and his only purpose is to find those responsible for his wife's murder.
What makes this movie really intriguing and keeps you on the edge of your seat is the fact that the story is told from the end backwards, each segment of the movie revealing a little bit more of what has previously happened. Who is a friend who is an enemy? This is what keeps you interested, this what keeps you guessing. I saw this movie at the theatre and what made it a great movie first time, apart from the excellent story and excellent acting from all concerned, is the surprise element and whilst if you are watching this movie for the first time it really is a rewarding experience, my concern with buying it on DVD, is that like many great thrillers it's maybe not so good for repeated viewings. Despite the fact that it is undoubtedly excellently crafted and has top notch performances from Guy Pearce, Joe Pantoliano and Carrie Anne Moss, it's the intrigue that holds the movie together and hold it together it does very well, for this is an excellent, very intelligent movie. I just feel that once you know the end of the movie (the beginning of the story) it might not hold the same allure (or your attention) second or third time around.

But the supposed messages people pick up on about the nature of reality and the plight of Leonard's character should not be taken as seriously.  Sure it's horrible that Leonard has to suffer due to his anterograde memory loss, and it is ok to develop a sense of sympathy for him in the moment, but it should not be taken as the heart of the movie.  Similarly, his skewed perception of reality should not be seen as an excuse to interpret the movie as a deeper metaphysical analysis of every day life and the reality which surrounds us.  It is merely a tool used to add to the suspense and drama of the thriller, and it is here that the heart of the movie truly lies.  Memento is an engrossing and deceptive thriller...nothing else.  No deeper analysis of life, no great human drama or tragedy.  Leave it at that, and this is definitely one to remember.

1327197,5,B00003CXZ3,"Christopher Nolan's mind-bending thriller ""Memento"" is one of those rare instances in which the form of a movie is designed to match its content.  Here is a film all about the nature of short-term memory, which, by its own ingenious structure, challenges the audience to cope with its own mastery of short-term memory.
Guy Pearce stars as Leonard Shelby, a man who suffers from a ""condition"" brought on by a trauma to the head that prevents him from being able to retain any short-term memories (he can remember his life only up to the moment of his wife's rape and murder).  To cope with his affliction, Leonard writes himself copious notes, mostly on the backs of polaroids he takes on a regular basis but sometimes on his own body in the form of informational tattoos.  To approximate the sense of dislocation of time and place that Leonard feels on a daily basis - as he has to reorient himself to people and events he has recently met and since forgotten - Nolan has chosen to structure his film in a backward progression, so that the first scene ends up being the most recent and the final scene the earliest in time.  This technique is not exactly an original one, since the 1983 movie ""Betrayal"" used roughly the same format in the context of a romantic drama.  Still, ""Memento"" deserves enormous credit not only for trusting its audience to be able to cope with this complex style but for managing to keep most of the plot details well-focused and coherent for most of the film's duration.
One of the risks of a film like ""Memento"" is that it could, if handled badly, easily become a mere exercise in technical ""gimmickry.""  One of the ways that Nolan avoids that trap is by devising a plot that is as gripping as any to be found in a traditionally structured example of film noir.  ""Memento"" is filled with the kinds of narrative twists and turns, surprise revelations and moral ambiguities that form the basis for any good example of the genre.  More important, Nolan makes Leonard a compellingly sympathetic character, one whom we come to care for because his plight is so heartrending at its core.  Here is a man who not only has to deal with the immense incomprehensibilities of his life but who cannot even benefit from the time factor that helps mourning people come to terms with the loss of a loved one.  To Leonard, his wife's death is a perpetual recent event, one from which he can never attain that emotional distance so key to finally overcoming his grief.
Special note should be taken of Guy Pearce, who delivers a knockout performance as Leonard, perfectly capturing the determination, frustration and emotional pain that define the character.  Carrie-Ann Moss and Joe Pantoliano offer superb support as two perpetual ""strangers"" who play significant roles in Leonard's strangely dislocated and fragmented life - yet just what those roles are is as much a mystery to us as it is to Leonard.  David Julyan's subtle and haunting musical score and Wally Pfister's fine cinematography greatly contribute to the unique quality of the film.
Watching ""Memento"" is like entering a strange, mystical dream.  Like Leonard, we feel as if we have suddenly been stripped of that ability to fully make sense out of the chaotic world around us.  We feel cut loose from our mental moorings and find ourselves adrift in a world bereft of the rules of chronological reasoning we cling to so desperately for survival.  How many movies actually manage to shift our paradigm of perception and make us look anew at the way we observe the world around us?  Not many, I can assure you.
Christopher Nolan's brilliant and audacious cinematic tour de force reawakens our faith in the medium and those who dare to challenge it.",1009756800,14,3724,4.750387596899225

The very fact that the director chose to assemble it in a fashion which is almost HOSTILE to the average viewer (i.e. the general public, which generally seems to want watch something they can predict from beginning to end, the first time they see it...) makes me think that this film should be admired.
I give it ten punk points for sheer nerve.
If you've never seen the film, suffice to say that the first time you watch it, you will most likely be lost much of the time.. but the story unfolds in such a way that you don't really care.
And the second time you see it?  Well, if you aren't the type to watch a movie twice, get ready to change that habit at least this once, because you will get more the second time.
The structure, story, and conventions used in telling the story contained in this movie are amazing, frankly.  The main character has been rendered incapable of forming new memories, but still remembers his past.  The trick is, and this is fiendishly clever... the movie takes place in a series of two to three minute chunks, which is about the amount of time it takes to form a new memory.

1327234,4,B00003CXZ3,"Definitely a movie a viewer must watch at least 2 times to remember crucial important clues and relevant names to the plot. Quetin Tarantino style of direction. Time corresponded with main character's memory loss of the tragedy of his wife and himself. The brutal incident that occured in his home caused physical damage to his brain that would affect short term memory, OR DID IT? Sammy Jankis had similar problems with short term memory like Lenny. Leonard, the main character, was an insurance investigator who found that his memory loss was attributed to mental health instead of physical trauma. Leonard was mentally disadvantaged and others tried to take advantage of him for their own personal reasons. Very unique story line and direction. First film I have ever seen that focused on memory as being the most crucial element in uncovering the plot. The viewer will see small clues as the film advances and you will return to those same clues with more information to link the puzzle together. Incidents that occur don't chronologically follow in standard format. The movie begins with the ending. You will see random events that will link all together the further you watch this movie. It will make so much more sense near the end. It is a very compelling film that will keep you watching. It never gets boring. Scenes are very quick and if you turn your head or get up, you will miss vital parts. Pay attention to names. This will help you with association with the main character. Movie is executed very well with dialogue, acting, and time references. This movie can be seen by 10 different intelligent people and you could possibly end up with ten different opinions on it. Don't be surprised. The director wanted to leave it ambiguous for interpretation by the viewer. My philosophy is: The story is about a man who revenges his wife's death, realizing his own guilt, suppressing it with very strong denial. He is physically fine but his mental inner demons will not allow himself to accept the truth. Thereby, short term memory loss helps him cope with his profound loss of a loved one. All the characters seem like liars and it is hard to distinguish who might be telling the truth. Very clever editing and the relapses in time are exact with real time. You must watch the entire movie from front to finish to complete this puzzle. Very intelligent film making and direction with a strong supporting cast. My only complaint is that the film never clears up why and how certain character evolve into the story line. If this part was not so vague and more definite then it would receive 5 stars. Otherwise, a very interesting movie that forces the viewer to use his senses, attention, and problem solving ability. If you are an intelligent movie watcher that wants more than your typical and predictable script, then this is the movie for you. Memento will cause use to question with uncertainty on what you think you saw. This movie is a great discussion piece for philosophy and interpretation.",1009497600,2,3009,4.799614643545279

Along the way one can find a psychological study in the slippery nature of memory and reality.

1327237,5,B00003CXZ3,"Formalistic experiments in film can be a hit-or-miss affair.  Most filmmakers playing with form -- in narrative or visual presentation -- find it difficult to marry the experiments they want to conduct with a compelling story.  Memento writer/director Christopher Nolan flies out from among his competition by finding a story which by nature demands an unconventional narrative approach, making Memento the four-aces masterpiece it is.
The amazing thing is that Nolan makes you hang on to a story in which you find out the ultimate outcome of the plot in the very beginning.  Memento, however, makes you care about *how* something happened, the cause of the effects, and somehow manages to generate suspense even though you're watching events unfold backwards.  An astonishing writing feat.  The actors do a terrific job -- Guy Pearce wisely holds himself back and delivers a low-key, simmering performance and a deadpan voice-over job that are instantly winning; Carrie-Anne Moss continues to make smart choices in edgy roles, not content to milk her sex-symbol status; Joe Pantoliano's smarmy charisma comes through yet again as he chomps lines with gusto, coming out with some of the funniest moments in the film.  Nolan mines the central conceit of a character with no short-term memory for fresh comedic moments, and this also helps keep your attention even if you might sometimes get lost in its complicated plot.  And of course, the bounty of story twists and revelations make this movie a terrific rewatch experience.

The acting is magnificent with the exception of Joe Pantolino who plays the greasy mugging role as usual.  The direction is great and Guy Pearce really captures the character without playing over the top at all.  Lovely and understated.  The problems I do find with the film are the black and white sequences which although very captivating, are not clarified for the viewer distinctly in terms of when in time they happen.  Another problem I have is the resolution for us...so, did he do her with the needle or did he commit the heinous acts he thought he saw John G commit???  This is totally unclear because the Teddy character suggests both that his wife had diabetes...but he also said that Shelby had killed the real John G and gave proof with the photos.  Is this some huge glitch the director didn't bother working out because he felt the audience would just think...""oooooh...he did imagined it"" and just forget the details?  I don't like working for a film attention-wise and getting peanuts in return.
As for how could he remember his condition...something several people keep asking...Um...did you notice that ""Remember Sammy Jankis"" tattoo on his hand?  I think that's what it was for.
Either way...the entertainment was 4 stars...but if the director really did screw it up the way I think he did...he deserves to give me my money back for being such an untalented dolt.

Not knowing what will happen next, and when it all came together at the end, you immediately had to watch again because you couldn't believe your eyes. One cool feature on the DVD would be the option to watch the movie in the forward sequence, maybe like after so many viewings the option would be unlocked.
The acting was superb! Guy Pearce did an excellent job, as well as Carrie-Ann Moss and John Pantoliano. You could feel the frustration and confusion Leonard was feeling as he tried to piece together the fragments of his brief memories. The dark scenes in the motel room were haunting as the puzzle of events were being linked together. The Sammy Jankis part of the story gave credibility to his 'condition'. Totally fasinating movie.

Momento was about a man who's been seeking revenge for his wife's murderer but he has one problem, he cannot create any new memories since her murder because of a head injury that he suffered during the attack. The move is made backwards which creates some confusion throughout the movie but it all comes together in the end (or beginning). The camera work, the directing and the script all work in complete harmony to create a movie of superb quality. I don't believe that I have ever seen a really good suspense movie till now and I strongly urge anyone and everyone to rent or buy this movie as soon as they can.",1008979200,,782,4.4

Twists and turns everywhere. Excellent dialogue, especially for Guy Pearce. What is unclear to me, even after a couple of viewings (and with a substantial IQ), is how Natalie

Chris Nolan's direction is superb and innovative. The movie starts at the end and goes backward in ten minute intervals. Taking you to the beginning to see where it all started. The flick has a great leading man in Guy Pearce. New Market Films should push his performance for Oscar consideration. He turns in one of the best performances of 2001.

The main character ""Guy Pierce"" was injured when somebody broke into his house, raped and murdered his wife.  He now has a condition that gives him no short term memory. He will forget a face after a minute. cannot watch TV. because he will not remember the begining of the show when it finally ends, nor when on the phone will he remember who he is talking to.  However he remembers everything up to the time his wife was killed.  That is what fuels his life, he wants to find her killer.
He gets through the smaller things in his life by looking at polaroids labled ""My Car"" or with peoples names.  the more important things in his life he tatoos on himself.
All of this can make for a thrilling suspensefull movie as when one scene begins with him on the phone, he, while talking is slowly pulling off a bandage from a new tatoo, as the bandage comes off the words ""Do NOT answer the phone"" are revealed. Then he asks, ""Who is this?"" and the other line goes dead.

It's that good. I'll make it simple: This is one of the most fascinating films to come around in recent times (perhaps ever?). One of the few that I could describe as ""mind-blowing"" with a straight face. One that can be watched over and over--in fact it practically demands it--without getting dull. The script is snappy and the cast is top-notch. The backwards storytelling may be just a gimmick, but it's quite a clever one, especially in the context of this story. Not only does it raise the classic suspense/noir tactics to another level, but it puts the viewer in Leonard's head, forcing us at first to see things as fractured and stilted as he does. It's quite an experience.

He can remembe reverything very well up to the injury but after that, forget about it. He has to take polorids of everything, write notes, tatoos, all in this grand search for the murderer of his wife.
Here's where the movie itself takes a brand new life. By running backwards, repeating scenes over and over, by the time its over you are left with a full story, a full movie, and a tremendous impact of what memory is and just how a story can be told.

1327359,2,B00003CXZ3,"Friends recommended this movie to me.  Smart friends.  Memento is a classic who-done-it murder mystery (...) We are deliberately fed conflicting misinformation at the end of the film (or should I say the beginning?).  It is as if the director (...) structured the plot-line in reverse chronological order, with the hope that his audience would be sufficiently confused that they would either assume there had been logical explanations for everything or, better yet, they would had invent their own explanations.  My friends have come up with differing explanations (...), however these explanations are not necessarily grounded in the ""facts"" presented in the film.  (...)
The real kicker is that many people are watching the movie over and over, hoping to figure it out.  Dustin Hoffman's character in Rain Man will sooner figure out ""Who's on first.""

Incredibly complicated yet devastatingly simple, i still didn't see any of it coming, i still don't really understand how it was all woven together, but boy am i impressed.
Its hard to think of a more intelligent movie, and one that requires quite so much concentration, this isn't a popcorn and sunday afternoon movie, this one needs you awake and alert and concentrating on every sly move the narrative pulls or you could quite easily miss the beauty of this movie.
Shot in an unusual style in that the movie ""develops"" much like the photographs the main character takes to help with his memory, slowly and partially.  You see it tells everything backwards, from end to beginning then end again, except the end isn't quite the end, confused? sorry, but its hard to explain.
Essentially we see one scene, say five minutes worth of plot, then the next five mins shows events leading up to the part we just saw.  For instance if for instance we just saw a five minute scene starting with the character walking into a house, when thats done we see another five minute scene climaxing in him pulling up to the house.  I've explained it remarkably bad but it really is ingenious, and a crucial subplot intersects these scenes giving a nice background and an unusual twist to the overall story, as well as providing a slight relief from all the head-swirling of the main story.
The story itself concerns Lenny, an ex insurance investigator whose wife was murdered, fairly straight forward except lenny suffers from a memory disorder which means he has no short term memory, thus he uses polaroids and tattoos and hand written notes to help him along his way to finding the killer, but at the same time is never sure of who people are and if he can trust them.
The cast headed by Guy Pearce is generally very very good and Guy himself shows why he won rave reviews after L.A Confidential with another excellent performance.  The direction is pretty slick and extremely sly and all credit must go to the makers not just for thinking up such an intelligent story but for comitting it to film and making it work.
If any downfalls of the film exist its in that it may be a little too clever for its own good, a lot of people won't have the patience to concentrate for the whole movie and may find it boring or hard work, not generally what people want from entertainment and thats a fair expectation, I know I have to be in a certain frame of mind to watch this myself and know many people to have switched off halfway in.
That aside if your prepared to work with the film to its conclusion and to keep your eyes open and your mind on the plot then its an extremely rewarding experience, one that will have you gasping, full of admiration for all the players involved and with a head full of questions to which there is no answer other than possibly watching again.  The sort of film you watch and immediatly want to talk about to anyone else who has seen it, and restores faith that sometimes you can get an intricate story from somewhere other than a book.

1327363,5,B00003CXZ3,"I've been flipping through the one-star reviews for this movie (more than I would have expected) and there are a few themes which are repeated in these viewers' complaints:
- There was a predominant artsy-fartsy, pseudo-intellectual air about the film.
- ""I couldn't follow it!""
- The ending stunk.
- We don't really find out what we want to find out (i.e. that the main character is an unblemished hero).
Here's my response to these thoughts, because I would hope that these poor reviews won't deter people from experiencing this movie:
Yes, there's probably a artsy sort of pseudo-intellectual thing going on here. That comes from the pseudo-intellectuals themselves, however, so they can choose how to view it if they like, and you can do your own thing. If there's one thing you should pick up from this movie, it's the idea of perception being reality, so if you get yourself caught up in the artsy-fartsy intellectualism, you'll probably concede your chances of enjoying the movie. It's a movie, not a textbook... enjoy it, don't take it too seriously.
If you can't follow the plot... I can't help you there. You might want to consult your doctor about a possible ADD affliction, though.
If you had a problem with the ending, well, you're not alone. I loved this movie, but when I watched it the first time I was pretty disappointed with the ending. I guess it comes from our ""big Hollywood film"" conditioning- there's always gotta be something at the end. I contend, as everyone else does, that this film defies convention. I, however, believe it defies convention in other ways aside from the obvious ""back-to-front"" presentation. We're slapped with an ending which is neither tragic nor joyous. It's just kind of there. What you make of it is up to you. If you choose to take the 21st century prepackaged hyper-caffeinated approach, then you may find the ending to be completely lacking any substance. On the other hand, if you keep your mind open (and it should be WIDE open after 90 minutes of this brain-twister) you might find something else. I won't tell you what to find; if I did, I'd be one of the same pretentious, self-appointed intellectuals that draw the ire of a typical average Joe moviegoer.
Finally, what I enjoy most about this movie is the character development. I read a complaint that we never get a grasp of who each character truly is. I think that's true, but I think that's what makes it great. There can be poor character development which makes us wonder who is who and renders us unable to discern between good and evil, and then there can be brilliant character development which aims to erase the fast food mentality of black and white, prepackaged archetypes and the like. I'm not sure anything in this movie is necessarily brilliant, but I do enjoy the fact that we DON'T know the characters and their integrity. What we're left with is an introspective on truth in relation to perception. We're also reminded that guaging human morality is a fudgy proposition- we know what we're supposed to do, but even the best of us aren't always inclined to do so. Each of the three characters who are the main foci of this movie are difficult to read- are they friend or enemy? Are they rife with malicious intent, or are they ordinary people put in extroardinary situations in which they must conduct themselves with less-than-admirable behaviors? It is painful to some viewers that they can not differentiate between hero and villain, and that may be why this movie is not for everyone. Whatever the case may be, you are cheating yourself if you don't give this movie a fair shake. It is a tremendous movie which will surprise and shock you as well as make you think.
Of course, I could just be full of it too.",1006300800,12,3742,4.7145038167938935

1327365,5,B00003CXZ3,"First off, this is probably the best movie I have seen in years. This movie will pull you in from the start, mystify you for 113 minutes, and will leave you stunned at the end. This is not your typical revenge movie, because both the story and the storytelling are very original. The reason being that this story is told backwards. You watch the scenes of the film in their reverse chronological order, which leaves you wondering not ""what happens next,"" but rather ""what just happened?""
Leonard (Pearce) is on a personal mission to discover the identity of the man who murdered his wife. But to complicate matters, Leonard has a rare memory condition which he recieved the night his wife was killed. He no longer has any short-term memory. He can rememeber who he is, and everything that happened before his memory condition started, but he can't form new memories. He relies on notes and photographs to continually remind himslef what he is doing, who his friends are, and where he has been.
The story is told in reverse order so the viewer can sympathize with his condition. Leonard doesn't know where he just was, or what he just did; so this way the viewer doesn't know either. The suspenseful drama that unfolds is like no other you have ever seen. It is a unique story in that you know how it ends, but you watch to find out how it began. With every passing scene you go a little further back in Leonard's life, learning what he no longer remembers, until you finally reach a shocking finale (beginning?) that will make you want to watch it again on the spot.
This is one of those movies about which you will discover something new each time you watch. The discussions you will have with your friends after seeing it will never get boring. I watched this movie 4 times during the first week that I owned it, and then let someone borrow it. Every day, I called that person almost begging him to return it so I could watch it again.

The hero of the piece is a puppet without his awareness and you wish that he never knows the extent of his manipulation by the good folk that populate his world.

The suspense lingers even more, as the biggest foil for Leonard to solving the mystery of who raped and killed his wife is his ""condition"".  Moreover, by reversing the order of the presentation of events, the movie, then, is essentially shot as a reconstruction of memories leading backward to the pivotal moment that sets the events in motion, which is precisely what Leonard is lacking.  If this were the same story, with the same character, but with the scenes portrayed in normal order, this would have been a completely different movie.
But even beyond the mystery element of the story, the movie is also a character profile, of a man seeking revenge for the rape and murder of his wife, yet in all likelihood won't remember the satisfaction of getting that revenge.  As the viewer is taken back closer and closer to the beginning, we get a better idea of how and why the messages on the photos and Leonard's body were put there.  The suprises here, again, only could be revealed if the movie started at the end and went backwards.

Memory can change the shape of a room; it can change the color of a car. And memories can be distorted.

1327419,5,B00003CXZ3,"Bring no expectations to this film. Some reviewers have been (over)using the word ""linear"" in writing about this film, trying to describe the fact the story is not told beginning with A, and progressing neatly to B, and all the way to Z. However, the film does more than simply skip randomly from one letter to another. The film has a precise structure.
Leonard is a man with Hippocampal brain damage. He has short term memory as long as he sticks to one subject. As soon as the subject changes, he has forgotten what he was previously discussing. Someone says something to him, he turns his head, and has forgotten what was said. He also cannot make new memories. He remembers everything that happened in his life before the head injury he sustained when his wife was raped and killed. (or was he hit just before she was attacked?)
Leonard is a fighter, however. He tattoos information on his body. He takes Polaroids and writes information on them in indelible black ink. He has a flow chart on the wall of his hotel room with pictures and notes. Step by step, Leonard is learning to cope with his brain deficit. His struggle and success is symbolized (in case we miss it) in his tattoos. The early ones are amateurish scrawls, while the later ones are precise lettering, and the very recent artistic script.
The narrative structure for this story is Leonard's ability to frame his experiences. At first it is poor, and the viewer is confused. We see scenes, and are introduced to characters, but we can't make any connections among them. Later in the movie, each scene makes sense; it connects to something else; we see the whole picture, and not scattered and disjointed bits.
It is very clever. I thought of Roshomon, watching it, but it is much more intricate than Roshomon. Even more mind-boggling is Guy Pearce as Leonard. He proves himself a consummate actor in this film, at least to me. His range is astounding: the last film I saw him in was Priscilla, Queen of the Desert.
Also, if you see this film, you get to hear one of the funniest lines of the year: ""What's going on here? OK...I'm chasing him. No. He's chasing me.""",1005523200,,2135,4.606299212598425

Only the story's told out of order and often repeats itself showing what you just saw(or thought you saw) in a new light. Similar to Pulp Fiction, but much more intense in that regard(and all regards, really). A very scary movie that chills you not because of potential danger, but because you'll have to imagine what you'd do if you were suffering from the disorder.
  I didn't think I'd like this before I saw it. The description rubbed me the wrong way. But after viewing it, I thought it to be the best movie to come out in years.

1327421,5,B00003CXZ3,"Memento, though under-rated and not popular, was possibly one of the best films of the year 2000.  Guy Pearce plays Leanord, a confused, but earnest man who's sole purpose in life is to find his wife's murderer.  His handicap--the disability to form new memories--severely impares his search for the murderer.  He doesn't know where he is, he doesn't know how he got there, but he does know what he wants to do next.  So Leanord gets tattoos and writes notes to remind himself who he's searching for and important things that he has discovered.  ""It's like waking up,"" he tells people who ask what it's like.  Leanord's major problem in the search is the people he meets.  His ""buddies"" take advantage his memory-loss, and Lenny falls for it sometimes.  Natalie could just be using him to kill Teddy.  Teddy could just be using him to kill Natalie's husband.  What makes this movie so interesting is that contrary to most omnipotent audiences, the audience for this film does not know what's going on.  We know as much as Leanord, if not less.  This film leaves everything up to our own reasoning skills.  Nothing is solid.  ""The memory is an interpretation, not a record.""  In the end, we don't even know if Lenny has the right reason for this search; does his wife live or die?
  To top off this confusion, the movie is completely backwards (except for sporadic B&W clips).  The ending is already known, it is the beginning that this movie is searching for.  Along with the plot, the cinematography is superb.  With bone-chilling images of his wife's murder, and records of Leanord's distorted memory, the camera really conveys Leanord's deep confusion.  I recommend this to any film-noir lovers!  If you're sick of seeing movies like American Pie and Scary Movie, Memento is a fresh change of pace.",1005436800,,1801,4.779220779220779
1327422,5,B00003CXZ3,"Considering the undeniably interesting and original premise (guy with no short term memory goes in search of wife's killer) and the film's rave reviews, its perhaps surprising that this film didn't do better.  But then again it didn't contain Hollywood superstars, and before anyone mentions Blair Witch, a hugely successful (and fake!) marketting scheme.  More importantly, it's an adults' movie, which of course means that it can never be a box office success.  Although maybe those times are changing with 'American Beauty' and 'Magnolia' doing so well.
Anyway, the movie itself is told backwards.  Here the end is the beginning, the audience gets to see who Pearce took his vengeance out upon, and we backtrack to the beginning to find out the real conclusion.  This twist is ingenious, but makes for frustrating viewing as you try to grasp what's going on whilst watching the action at the same time.  This is a must-see-twice movie if ever there was one.  The acting from every quarter is wonderful, hopefully setting up Guy Pearce as a major star .  Come on Hollywood, the rest of the stars of 'L.A Confidential' are doing well!  Carrie-Ann Moss proves that there's more to her than rubber suits and special effects and Pantoliano gives a magnificent turn as Teddy.
So what makes the movie special?  Well, it's intelligent for one.  There's a neat little subplot that tugs at the heart strings.  Plus the director manages to extend empathy towards all of his miserable characters, imbuing them with life rather than using his supporting cast as mere cardboard cut-outs to help make the lead look good.  But what is the film about?  Any number of things really.  It challenges its audience's ideas of memory and its reliability as well as showing just how bland and easily forgettable most of today's movie fodder is.  This is a film to end all films: it makes you think, cry, laugh and sit at the edge of your seat.",1005436800,,1922,4.8318042813455655

1327444,5,B00003CXZ3,"Listen, I generally get lousy ratings for my movie reviews, so I am prepared for this.  That being said; here goes.
A THINKING MOVIE, NOT A RELAXING ONE:
If you like a movie that makes you put your head in gear, this is it.  Pay attention very closely to what goes on in this movie.
I plan on watching it again and again, because there is some loose threads that just don't fit.
UNUSUAL PRESENTATION BUT DONE REALLY WELL:
Are you a Pulp Fiction or an X-files fan?  You might really like this.  No, no aliens, just an unusual story line.  I have to be careful not to ruin it for you.  This movie is not only different in that it is about a guy with short-term memory loss, but it is presented differently.  In a way you as the viewer are forced to piece together the movie, just like the main character does in his notes.  It is really well done.
BASIC STORY LINE:
In a nutshell, Lenny is a guy that has short-term memory loss.  Leave the room after talking to him for 15 minutes and he will forget who you are.  He remembers his past, his wife, her attack. Everything is up for grabs after that.  However, he wants his revenge for her attack.  This is his theme and his tatoos help piece together this puzzle.
ACTORS:
Guy Pearce memorable in L. A. Confidential as the rule-stuck young cop is almost unrecognizable in his bleached-blond look as Lenny.  He does an admirable job showing the confusion of a young man with a brain disorder that literally forces him to live in the moment.  Notes, tatoos and Polariod photos take the place of his memory.
Joe Pantoliano from the Matrix plays Teddie, his sleazy accomplice, providing confusion and direction.  Carrie Anne Moss also from the Matrix is Teddie's counter-balance.  Who does a guy with no memory trust?
NOT A MOVIE TO RELAX BY, BUT UNIQUELY ENJOYABLE:
If you want to think, this is a great movie.  If you want to coast, watch something else and save this when you want to get your mind in gear.  Some people like movies like this, some people hate them.  It may also just depend on your mood.
IF AT FIRST YOU DON'T LIKE IT, GIVE IT AT LEAST 1/2 HOUR:
When I first started watching this movie, my thought was, it was kind of tedious.  Great a weirdly unfolding movie.  Then when a couple of things happened that I didn't expect, it really got my attention.  Give it at least 1/2 hour to get yours.

1327446,5,B00003CXZ3,"""Wow"" is the only word to describe this movie.  I have finally seen ""Memento"", and now I know that it's not pure hype; this movie is outstanding!  This is one of my new favorite movies.  If you like movies that make you think (""Fight Club,"" ""Unbreakable""), then you will love this movie.
I will be quick and brief when I describe this movie, because this is another movie where you have to be careful on how you explain it or you'll give it away.  Leonard seems to be an ordinary man, but he's not.  He has a certain condition where he is unable to create new memories.  If he talks to someone too long, he will forget what he was talking about and whom he was talking to.  Leonard has an agenda in mind; to find and kill the person who raped and murdered his wife.  Leonard can remember everything before the ""incident,"" but he cannot remember anything new.  So he takes pictures of people to remember them and he tattoos important information all over on his body so he will remember things.  As his quest for vengeance continues, the more the twists and surprises come about.  Just when you think you know everything, you don't.
This movie was brilliantly directed.  The events in the movie are backwards and brief, which sort of gives us an idea of what the main character is going through.  All though you do not see a lot of actors in the film, the ones who are in it deliver top-notch performances.  Guy Pearce did an outstanding job and was the best actor in the movie.  The screenplay was mesmerizing and made the characters seem that more realistic.  There are a few extras on the DVD, but it would've been nice to have a few more in there, as always.
There are no guarantees that you will like this film.  Since this is such a unique film, it means that only certain people will like it.  I think it's worth viewing and even if you do not like the film, I think you'll admire how it was done.  Hey, I hated ""Citizen Kane,"" but even I can appreciate how it was filmed and directed.  If you don't want a film that's going to make you think, then don't see it.  If you want more action than story, don't see it.  Otherwise, give it a shot!  Since Leonard is so dependent on facts, here's a couple for you that will help you out during the movie:
FACT 1:  Pay close attention to the movie.  If I were you, I wouldn't take any breaks.  If you do, you might forget what has happened, and you'll lose the rhythmic flow of the movie.
FACT 2:  Nothing is what it seems.  Make sure you pay attention to every character and every conversation that takes place.
FACT 3:  Re-watch the movie.  This is the type of movie that likes to screw around with your brain!  You are very likely to be confused the first time around, but the second time should be a little more clearer.
This is a remarkable film and is an excellent thriller that outdoes most films.  Who are Leonard's friends and foes?  Who can he trust?  What is real and what is not?  You'll find that out soon when you see it.  ""Memento"" shows you that some memories are best forgotten.  What a spectacular movie!!",1005177600,3,3071,4.333919156414763

I flat out found it intriguing. wanna get this? Okay. Close your mental eyes. You have no short term memory. I mean NO short term memory. Anything that happened 15 minute ago has evaporated from your brain. The only way you can identify (NOT REMEMBER!Only long term memories exist) with anything, is by the photos in your pocket, or the bold tattoos you've had inked on your arms and legs. each of these are a direction to solving the murder of your wife, and the bludgeoning that resulted in your memory loss. Now, don't trust anyone, especially those who proclaim themselves to be your friends. Not a bad premise eh? Now, live your life in reverse from a seamy hotel room you're not sure if you rented...

1327503,1,B00003CXZ3,"Christopher Nolan directs this stunningly akward and rather destructable piece of, need I say- waste, about a man who's life changing accident leaves him with a memory disorder- in which he can only remember previously before this accident, but the present and everything afterwards just flies right over his head.  He is obcessed with trying to find John G, the man responsible for the murder of his wife.  Through taking pictures, writing notes to himself, and tatooing his body to remember things, this man's life gets more confusing as time goes on, because to him- time is nothing, and he can't really feel it.  THE MATRIX's Carrie Anne-Moss and Joe Pantoliono star with Guy Pearce in this deranged thriller.
To start off, this plot is so confusing and holds so much, it relies on itself being so non-understandable to make the viewer think there actually is a plot going on.  The point of the film is basically to surpass as something very original, which it is, but the problem is that its originality makes no sense whatsoever.  Sometimes we never know at what point in the film we are because they are constantly flashing back to the past to try to show us an event that took place that (Guy Pearce) can't remember.  Carrie Anne-Moss plays the mistook Natalie, a beaten woman who is trying to help out Leonard (Pierce) solve this case.  There is so much strange build around each character, including the odd Teddy, another man who seems to stick around and pretend to be Lenny's friend.  The purposterous events that take place over and over- like Leonard waking up in the motel and wondering where he is, looking at himself in the mirror, and questioning who people are- even telling the same people over and over about his condition; it gets to the point where you are tired of hearing it.  You are ten times ahead of the film and where the characters are at that you want to just get over with the film.
All of these events lead up to a wonderous conclusion, but the problem is that you can't understand it, and you keep thinking about the strangeness of it after it's over.  All of this is topped off with unique acting, disgusting language used constantly- of course because these people can do and say whatever they want to Leonard and he wouldn't remember it fifteen minutes later anyway.
The cruelness of the film, to its nonsense plot, its characters, and audience is enough to plague the whole idea of motion pictures.  They are meant to entertain, not to poison the mind with film algebra that has no answer.  This technically skilled and wondrous film would work if only it knew when to stop itself, if it could understand the boundaries and tolerances of audiences.  The film is highly skilled with an edge to it that the audiences want, but it is overdone with originality that the film doesn't make any sense anymore.  If only the plot wasn't like playing catch, going back and forth, when instead it should be keeping us in an orderly fashion of the film's movement, we'd all be able to keep up with it.  But as Christopher Nolan has left it, it is a stand-alone which will pit the audience in brain-freeze and they'd rather go see Pootie Tang instead.",1004832000,9,3178,4.639928698752228

1327505,5,B00003CXZ3,"I'm writing specifically to respond to the numerous people who thought that this movie's structure was ""contrived"" to hide a weak plot. It's often been said that there are just a few distinct plots that arise repeatedly in all literature (I think it might have been something like ten). What differentiates a great story from a terrible story, then, is the attention to detail, the characterization, and the degree to which we are convinced of the story's reality. In short, it is not the story being told but rather the *way* in which it is being told that makes great literature... and great movies.
In this respect, _Memento_ is a masterpiece. Far from being a pretentious contrivance developed in order to cultivate an arthouse atmosphere, the story's disjointed structure serves to convey Leonard's own disorientation and paranoia, his sense of having an idea what he's about to do, but not knowing what he's just done. Indeed, this structure is about the only way in which that feeling *could* be effectively communicated. The scripting and execution throughout the movie are flawless, and the acting is superb. Joe Pantoliano should top everyone's list for best supporting actor, and Carrie-Anne Moss and Guy Pearce also turn in Oscar-worthy nods. The story itself, presented in forward order, may not be the greatest ever written.

I almost hesitate to write a review of Memento, because part of the beauty of this movie is watching the plot slowly unfold in interesting and unexpected ways, so beware: do not read too many reviews, as they will spoil this wonderful element of the movie!
Without giving too much away, the movie is about a man with a condition known as 'anterograde amnesia.' This is a bona-fide neuopsychological disorder in which the victim cannot form *new* memories after becoming afflicted.  They can remember everything from before their injury, but after the injury they forget things five minutes after they happen.  This movie tackles many interesting philosophical questions about the construction of the self, memories, and the world using anterograde amnesia as a vehicle. If you liked The Matrix, you will *love* Memento.
If you get off on movies that make you think, movies that leave puzzles hanging in mid-air only to be taken up again much later in the movie, this is for you. If you like a movie that forces you to think about philosophical issues, this movie is also for you.

1327572,5,B00003CXZ3,"If you need a film with great acting, a stimulating and smart script and a plot line that you won't sleep through, look no furthur than this noir thriller. The film opens on a brutal image. A photograph of a grisly murder that slowly begins to fade. The photograph slides back into the camera. The flash goes off. The blood slowly begins to disappear from the walls. And the murdered victim rises to his feet. The stage is set for a tense, dramatic and emotional thriller that tells the story of Leonard Shelby (played by an excellent and pretty fine if I do say so Guy Pearce) in reverse. Leonard is searching. He is looking for somebody in particular, the man who raped and murdered his wife. But the only problem is that Leonard suffers from short term memory loss, causing him to forget things that happened minutes before. To remember things, he keeps notes and tattoos important information on his body. With ten minute footage intermixed with a black and white shot subplot, the film takes you on a ride full of twists and turns. You know what the effect is, you know what the present is, but what was the cause? As the film begins to unfold, the story begins to reshape. We meet Teddy (Joe Pantalino? is that right?), a cop who may or may not be on Leonard's side. We also meet a waitress named Natalie (Carrie-Anne Moss) who may have alterior motives for helping Leonard. The ending left me astounded and wondering what exactly happened the night his wife was killed and what kind of guy is Leonard. I won't give away the ending, but trust me, it wraps it up (excuse me)starts it up nicely. 'Memento' is truly a great picture, why don't more movies like this get seen or even made? It is definately one that will keep you on the edge of your seat and wondering along with Leonard.",1003881600,6,1789,4.474006116207951
1327573,5,B00003CXZ3,"Dark, suspense, at times humourous, a fantastic movie.  The opening scene has Leonard (Guy Pearce) shooting a guy... in reverse (blood flowing back into the body, bullet & shell, back into the gun) to give you an idea of what's to come.  This is a fast paced, edge-of-your-seat (sorry for the cliche) movie that uncovers why Leonard killed Teddy.  Joe Pantoliano (Teddy) gives an outstanding performance and deserves a nod for best supporting.
Be warned though, if you like your movies tied up in a nice package with a pretty little bow... well you'll still like the movie but you won't be thrilled with the ending.  It leaves questions unanswered.  You *WILL* talk about this movie after you watch it... and you will watch it again.
Destined to be a classic and definitely on my list of movies to own.  I've actually own the DVD (haven't had a chance to watch it) though I was disappointed that they don't give you the option to watch the movie in chronological order.  That would have been a cool addition.",1003881600,,1008,4.661016949152542
1327574,5,B00003CXZ3,"Memento was my favorite film last year, and I was very happy to finally find a film that wasn't Planet of the Apes, Tomb Raider, or The Mummy 2. This film is much, much better than any other action movie put out last year. It really makes every other film I saw last year look hollow and boring.
Aspects of the film that I enjoyed were the uncertainty of which reality was being experienced at different times, the nature of the lead character's strong, yet easily-manipulated personality, and the many questions that are left up to the viewer to answer for him or herself. I believe the characteristic of this movie that is most engaging is the subtlety with which aspects of the plot unfold. Subtlety is in very short supply in modern movies, and I was happy to see that it played a very large part in Memento.
The actors gave excellent performances. Solid, two-sides-to-each-decision roles that make you empathize with them, and yet sometimes you are reviled by them.
The best film of the year last year, and I applaud them for making it.",1003795200,2,1041,4.602150537634409
1327575,1,B00003CXZ3,"Guy Pearce adds another bad tasted movie to his curriculum, summing this up with the utterly ridiculous RAVENOUS. The director had one single purpose here: to enter the history of movie making by shooting the first picture that moves backwards. Ok, he achieved it. Congratulations. But the history... my God, there is none!!! even the ""Moral"" dilemma of living in that kind of memory disorder is ridiculous !! The solution, for Leonard, is to become a killer, a good one because he doesn't feel regret (because he soons forget what he did!!!). When Teddy says that he already killed the ""certain"" killer of his wife, and proves it by showing a photo of LEonrad smiling full of blood, Leonard destroys the evidence (by means of burning this photo and the photo of the guy he just had killed), and selecting Teddy to be his next ""target"", the next man to be hunted to give some meaning to his life!!!! Bad taste, bad taste, bad taste. (...)",1003708800,5,938,4.656626506024097
1327576,5,B00003CXZ3,"Rarely am I excited to watch a movie for a second time after having JUST seen it. But Memento has broken my general rule.
As a college student I'm being exposed to a wide variety of new and intriging information. Among the pool of knowledge is anterograde amnesia, which Leonard (played by Guy Pierce), the main character of Memento, suffers from. He is no longer able to make new memories due to a traumatic brain injury. But the movie isn't just that. It's shot BACKWARDS. You learn Leonard's story slowly, just as he might feel. You see a scene and are left with a ton of questions. The next scene backtracks, showing you the event previous to the scene you just saw. It ends as it begins to trail into the beginning. It's just marvelous. Over lying the main story is scenes shown in black and white. Exactly WHAT is going on in those black and white scenes is yet another mystery and wonderful entanglement of Memento. There's plenty of twists and turns as more and more is shown to you. Who to trust is a big issue and I was on my toes trying to guess exactly what would come next. When the movie wraps up and all the frayed ends are connected for you, the amazing twist at the end leaves you wanting to re-watch the whole thing right then.
Leonard can't make new memories. Imagining what that world must be like, because it is quite a different world from those who can make new memories, is quite impossible. The wonderful writers, actors, and directors of this film have made that world possible. The disjointed fluidness of the film truly make it feel as though you're caught up in Leonard's world. I know I personally can't wait to get caught up in it again and catch more details I might have missed the first time.",1003622400,2,1726,4.44794952681388
1327577,5,B00003CXZ3,"Alfred Hitchcock was the master of Cinema's Rule One: 'Do not tell. SHOW.' Director/screenwriter Christopher Nolan takes that philosophy a step further in this film noir masterpiece by controlling not only the viewer's visual sense but their perception of time as well, reconstructing the protagonist's attempts to make sense of his world by reading the clues he leaves for himself (and us) and deciding who to trust in order to understand not only what occurs, but why. In effect, Nolan has rewritten the rule: 'Do not show. EXPERIENCE.'

The cast is exceptional, Guy Pearce in particular, and traditional film noir elements are executed very well, with haunting music, taut cinematography, smart dialogue, effective voiceover, and a constant search for motive. Humor is used sparingly and effectively. This is really an editor's film, and Dody Dorn deserves an Oscar nomination for editing this gem.

As for the DVD edition, it is a mixed bag. Though operationally a bit buggy, cinematically and artistically the special features are creative and fun. For instance, interesting scenes run behind the menus, and many film clips appear framed as Polaroid camera shots, both fun to watch and relevant to the film's concept. The original idea for the film was supplied by the director's brother Jonathan, who wrote a short story based on the same idea and designed the film's web site; information rendered from outside the time frame of the film, viewable on the DVD as newspaper clippings and notes by Guy Pearce's Leonard, are adapted from that web site. Also included are Jonathan Nolan's short story, an Independent Film Channel interview with Christopher Nolan, trailers from Memento and an earlier Nolan film, cast and director biographies, subtitles in English or Spanish, and a tattoo gallery (which looked interesting, but I couldn't get it to work on my Power Mac G4).  I wish more DVDs would incorporate this kind of material.

I was disappointed because I'd heard that on the DVD you could watch the film as if it was shot running forward but that is not here, unless you count running the chapters in reverse from the Chapter Selection feature. I would also have liked to have seen behind-the-scenes footage, especially storyboards.

This is a great film to watch with a group (as long as they don't talk during the film) so you can talk about it afterward. Nolan and crew can be proud of this fine film. The DVD extras could have been better, but they are still fun to play with.",1003622400,26,2492,4.952153110047847
1327578,2,B00003CXZ3,"Okay, I was so excited about seeing this movie. For the most part, critical reviews were overwhelmingly positive.  I am also a huge fan of movies that are a little off the mainstream path.  Some of my favorites over the past few years are Being John Malkovich and Magnolia. I was almost certain, from the reviews I had heard, that Memento would join that list.  So, I hurriedly bought the DVD without having seen the movie. That was a mistake.
The movie plays backwards.  For example, if you divided the film into 20 scenes, traditionally scene 1 would play first, followed by scene 2, etc.  In Memento, Scene 20 plays first, followed by scene 19, then scene 18, etc.  This is definitely a unique style, and if it would have worked, I would have been thrilled with the technique.  Unfortunately, I don't think it is successful.  Just when a little Momentum begins to build, we are pulled from the story and thrown back in time.  The film could not hold my attention.
More troubling, though, is that interspersed within the film are scenes that play in the correct chronological order.  This just adds to the confusion.  By the end of the film, I was frustrated and exhausted by trying to keep up with the plot (which I cannot help but think would have been extremely weak if played in the traditional chronological order)and was hoping the ending would shed some light on the muddling film.  Instead, the ending just left me asking ""What?""  If Memento were a better film, I would attempt to watch it a second time to figure out some of the puzzles. But as it stands, I don't feel like watching this film again anytime soon.
I would reccommend that before purchasing the DVD you rent the movie first.  It could save you from disappointment.
NOTE: I really give the film 2.5 stars. It's has a story that is a little below average, but the unique presentation style is thoughtful and a welcome change to most Hollywood garbage. I just wish it could have been executed more effectively to lessen confusion and ambiguity.",1003449600,6,2016,4.626404494382022
1327579,5,B00003CXZ3,"If you haven't seen Memento yet, Lord have mercy on your soul, run down to the video shop right now and rent a copy. This movie is truly unmissable. It has been highly praised by critics and audiences alike, and in general has Wowed the world. I mean, it even earned a place on the IMDb Top 10 (out of 250!) films of all time. That is pretty impressive. I can see exactly why the world loves the movie. It's different, exhilarating, amazingly engaging, original, smart, involving and endlessly entertaining. Memento is just everything you want out of a smart and fun movie. You truly get your money's worth with this one. Now, where should I start? Hmm, yes, Christopher Nolan. What a guy. He put his heart and soul into this movie and has come up with a true original. The script was actually adapted from a short story but extended to a film that seems so totally new and fresh you would never guess it had been adapted from anything. Christopher's direction is brilliant. He uses black and white for the unforgettable flashback scenes and colour for the scenes that are happening at that time. The film pretty goes backwards but is never confusing if you watch it carefully. Another great thing at the movie is Guy Pearce. He is one heck of a performer! While not only truly believable, he somehow possesses his character into amazing form. We never really know if Pearce is acting or not. There are plenty more great things about the movie. The editing is effective, especially within the first few minutes. The voice-overs help you to understand where the movie is taking itself. Carrie Anne-Moss's character is very intriguing. This movie is shocking, intriguing and truly unforgettable. If you haven't seen it by the time I've finished blabbing about how good it was, then you should get help.

1327580,3,B00003CXZ3,"Memento is an amusing way to spend ninety odd minutes, no more.  The gimmick is neatly handled, but ultimately turns out to be rather more obvious than I had anticipated.  This whole business of basing an entire film on one slim premise is getting rather tiresome.  First The Usual Suspects, then The Sixth Sense, then this.
If any of the characters had grown on me as human beings, I might have liked the film better.  As it is, it is a rather chilly exercise in style and narrative trickery.  Nothing more.",1003363200,,508,4.538461538461538
1327581,5,B00003CXZ3,"This a classic film noir on a par with the best of Hitchcock. The plot was so ingenious and imaginative-a man is searching for the rapist and murderer of his wife even though he has an unimaginable handicap-he can't make new memories and he forgets everything after 10 or 15 minutes that he's just been through. That leaves a compelling plot, and Christopher Nolan's screenplay milks it for all it's worth in this terrific movie.
Add the incredible acting skills of Guy Pearce, great supporting performances by Joe Pantoliano and Carrie-Anne Moss and you have what is in my opinion the best movie of 2001. I can tell when a mystery is great because I was so blown away by the truth that was revealed at the end (or in this case, the beginning)!!! Astounding.",1003363200,,758,4.622222222222222
1327612,5,B00003CXZ3,"This is one of the best movies I have ever seen.  It is original, superbly acted and brilliantly edited together for a unique viewing experience.  The premise of the movie is that Leonard (Guy Pierce)is trying to find the men who raped and murdered his wife.  Unfortunately, he was hit on the head by the men who assaulted his wife and now he has only a long term memory and his short term memory fades after five minutes or so (meaning he can't make new memories).  He copes with this by writing himself notes on paper, pictures and even tatooing certain bits of information onto his body.  The style in which the film explains the story is brilliant, as another way of developing such a unique character would have proven inadequate.  The movie starts at the ending and works it way to what normally would be the beginning. While it goes about it in this fashion the plot unfolds and we are introduced to various characters that all interact/affect the main character (Guy Pierce) in some way.  The question is...who is truly a friend and who is an enemy?  All is revealed in the movies satisfying and unexpected ending (er, beginning).  Memento is a creative and intellingent story that is crafted brilliantly and assisted further by stellar performances from all the movie's players.  After watching it, you can't help but get philosophical and try to divulge some deeper meaning from the film and life in general.  I know I've been pondering something.  If Leonard can't make new memories since the incident, then how is it that throughout the movie, anytime he meets someone, he always tells that he has this condition and can't make new memories?  Since  he didn't develop this condition till after the injury it should not be in his long term memory and no where does he have written, ""I have a condition that doesn't allow me to make new memories.""

1327613,5,B00003CXZ3,"I passed by this film several times at the rental store, but I'm so glad I finally picked it up.  As previously mentioned, Memento is about a man unable to make new memories searching for a killer based on messages he writes and photographs he takes for himself.  Imagine not knowing where you are or how you got there every time you wake up.  Now imagine trying to track the person that killed your wife with this condition.
The thing I enjoyed most about this movie is how we are introduced to a scene where neither the audience or the main character know how he got there.  Then scene by scene we backtrack until it makes sense.
The supporting cast make this movie even more interesting.  Buddy and the woman (forget her name) each seem to have their own agenda.  Leonard (main character) interacts with these people based on the messages he writes on their pictures.  You will have to watch this movie (on the edge of your seat) to find out if that was a good idea.",1003190400,,969,4.410112359550562

It's overtly about a guy searching for the murderer of his wife. He has no short term memory (He can't remember anything new beyond a few minutes into the past. His real memories end on the night his wife was murdered.) But the film is so layered, reverse accumulation.

One was ""Requiem for a Dream"" which is enough to drive a person right over the edge with sheer intensity, the other is Memento.  I've been bombarded by cheap, half-a$$ed, smarmy flicks for so long that I'd forgotten how good movies could be.
I've talked to people who've expressed frustration over how difficult this movie is to follow, but to me, that's what makes it so great.  This movie isn't a mere distraction or white-noise on your TV, this movie requires participation.  It commands your attention and it makes you THINK.  Thinking is something we've all been doing a lot of lately, but for too long many of us have been content to allow our brains to slip into auto-pilot and cruise along unchallanged.
So next time you go to the video store, put down that lame Adam Sandler movie you've already seen half a dozen times and rent this one instead.

Interestingly enough the movie is told backwards, and the solution is ironic in the fact that it is the very beginning of the story.  The film challenges our memories, and perceptions of reality.

1327642,5,B00003CXZ3,"The first part of this review is for those who have not seen this film. The second part is specifically for those who have viewed this film more than once.
In this first part I will mention that this film is highly unusual. Even a description of the plot and characters would only be my abstract and subjective opinion. You the viewer, are the final judge as to what actually took place within the story. This movie is that obscure, intricate, illusive, and downright subjective. This is not (not at all) the type of movie that you go into viewing with preconceived ideas--whatever they may be. If you are the type of person who just has to know about a movie before you even watch it, you are doing yourself a grave disservice in this case. Exercise your mind and your comprehension skills and view this film without any foreknowledge, other than the fact that you are in for a special dosage of mental stimulation.
I would recommend this film to anyone who enjoys being intellectually challenged. Those of you who are intuitive and sensitive to subtleties, those of you who notice things that others overlook, and those of you who are clever and inventive will love this movie. Detectives, medical professionals, psychologists, sociologists, scientists, mathematicians, and creative professionals, such as writers, will find this film very rewarding.
This is certainly the type of film that you will want in DVD. You will have questions that only the extras on the DVD can answer for you. There is also a website set up specifically for admirers of this fantastic movie. If after watching, you can figure out the website address, you are very clever.
In this second part I would like to discuss my opinion of what I  believe is an overlooked aspect of the plot and the main character, Leonard. If you think I am on to something, than e-mail me.
I have many ideas about how to interpret this film, however I am going to give a very unusual interpretation here, in hopes that there are others out there that, like me, like to think ""out side the box"", so to speak.
The way I see it, Leonard is a person who loves to kill. He has been killing prior to meeting this person he refers to as his wife, who is actually not his wife. He uses his memory condition as a contributor to his psychological dysfunction (his need to kill).  He remembers what he needs to remember, and forgets just what he needs to forget. Leonard displays both sociopathic and psychopathic behavior. He surrounds himself with abusive, aggressive individuals who fuel his justification for his heinous actions. Leonard is extremely clever and intelligent, and he is disciplined and systematic to a precision.
Leonard was committed to a mental institution prior to meeting his supposed wife--whom he also killed.  There is special meaning to the one tattoo that Leonard can see at all times, ""Remember Sammy Jenkis,"" and it is not because Leonard is Sammy. It is because Sammy is the first person Leonard killed, prior to his incarceration at the mental institution, as this is Leonard's reminder of his purpose in life as a killer. And the real kicker is that Leonard would have everyone believe that his memory condition is a physical handicap, when in fact it is a mental projection produced by his severe psychosis.
And the beauty of this film is that it does not matter if my opinions are near fact or far fetched, what matters is that this film allows me to create what reality I would have with it.",1002499200,5,3473,4.699507389162561

1327645,4,B00003CXZ3,"An anonymous, sun-drenched wasteland of motels, diners, and strip-malls is the backdrop for Christopher Nolan's hypnotic tale, Memento.
Memento's protagonist is Leonard Shelby, a man living for vengeance; to punish the man who raped and murdered his wife.  But Leonard is no typical vigilante.  He suffers from short-term memory loss--he cannot make new memories.
Leonard is never fully awake, nor fully asleep.  He is constantly waking from a dream that he can't quite remember.  It is almost never nighttime in Memento.  Life is one unending day.
Leonard must keep himself in a state of coiled readiness.  Pearce's body is lean and sinewy, all tendon and muscle, ready to lash out against threats, real or imagined.
Nolan runs the film in reverse, so the end of the story is Memento's opening scene.  The movie lurches backwards in jagged chunks of time.  Rather than spoiling the fun, this trick includes the audience in Leonard's disorientation while letting them know what's going on before he does.
I have racked my brain for a film to compare with Memento, and the best parallel I can draw is to Hitchcock's masterpiece Vertigo.  Though very different characters, Pearce's Leonard and Jimmy Stewart's Johnny share a terrible sense of desperation and loss.

Carrie-Ann Moss and Joe Pantoliano give expert supporting performances as Leonard's acquaintances, but the molten core of Memento is Guy Pearce's Leonard, a man teetering on the brink of madness, clinging desperately shreds of  reality.  As he searches for his wife's killer, he is sad, brave, and demented.  Leonard is a man driven to horrifying extremes--such as tattooing important information on his body--to keep his life in some kind of order.  One of the film's unforgettable scenes shows Leonard frantically searching for a pen to write down a critical piece of information.  Such is life for Leonard--always desperate, always searching, a moment away from oblivion.  Memento's conclusion is immensely satisfying, but the greatest thrill of the movie is watching Leonard's tragic struggle for survival.  Leonard is like a fish drowning in a tidepool--desperate, driven, and, ultimately, doomed.",1002153600,3,2166,5.286549707602339

Guy Pearce and Joe Pantoliano turn in great performances as a man with no short-term memory and a his enemy/sidekick/friend. You will need to watch this movie more than once, because once you've seen the end (or the beginning, as the case may be) you'll want more than anything to go back and observe again how it got there.

1327709,5,B00003CXZ3,"Memento is one of the most innovative and intriguing films of the past 10 years.  Other reviewers have certainly given the reader enough information to cover the film (read them).  The singular thing about it is the way the film successfully puts the viewer in exactly the same position as the protagonist - unable to ""connect the dots"".  The story is told in short segments - in reverse order, causing the viewer to have to ""remember what came next"", and - just as the protagonist - I felt almost compelled to take notes, just so I could piece the story together in some coherent way.  If this sounds uncomfortable, it is.  If it sounds unpleasant, it is not.  Rarely does a theatrical experience challenge the audience to this extreme.  The over-all look and feel is certainly 'Film Noir'.  In most cases, color tends to disrupt the feeling of 'Noir', but not here.  The whole experience is so unique that the mood is maintained throughout.  Amazingly enough, Memento manages to accomplish all this without ever seeming self-conscious.  There is no ""look how clever"" gloss.  The film accepts itself matter-of-factly - and so do we.  The cast is uniformly excellent, and the script is sharp and precise. Occasionally, a film comes along, which - because of its complexity or innovation - absolutely demands several viewings.  Memento is just such a film.  If you rent (rather than buy) it, you will soon find that you've paid the purchase price for repeated rentals.  Bite the bullet, and spring for your own copy!",1001894400,3,1515,4.813953488372093
1327710,5,B00003CXZ3,"After watching Memento, my wife and I sat up talking about it for a long time. The story is a classic detective mystery with a couple of big twists - first, the detective cannot form new memories, because of an injury he has suffered. This means that he retains information for at most ten minutes, and may well forget the beginning of a conversation by the end, or if distracted.
The second twist is a creative result of the first - the director has chosen to let the audience experience some of what life might be like for this character by showing the scenes in reverse order. For the most part, the movie unfolds backwards!
One result of this is that performances by Carrie-Anne Moss, Guy Pierce, and Joe Pantoliano shine even brighter, as you see their actions, then the motivations for their actions later on. Layer upon subtle layer, the characters and situations are built, until we arrive at the beginning of the film, and the biggest twist of all.
See Memento. It's one of the most creative movies I've seen in a lifetime of cinema.

But what I got was an interesting premise and a well acted film.  The movie was intriguing, but the only complaint I have is that is was to complex.  Taking out a few events or expounding on a few things would have helped this movie out alot because their is just so much going on.  Messing with time frames is also something that seems to be in style now but i've never seen a movie go completly backwards.  Overall it was an enjoyable movie, but no masterpiece.

I knew very little about ""Memento"" when I saw it, and I'm glad I didn't.  The way that the film is unraveled backwards is unique and mindbending.  I often had to ask, ""Wait, what just happened?"" in my mind, but it is not too hard to follow.  It's true, this movie has you asking ""Why did that happen?"" all throughout it.  You see something happen, and have to wait until you backtrack further in order to understand it.

The plot is so simple, it is complicated. Told backwards, in little ""acts"", you have got to pay attention to this movie.  And be intent in your attention; no interruptions, as I had to rewind the DVD at least 5 times to catch up what was being said, or who was doing what.  Each detail of the movie is important. The story unfolds--remember, the movie moves backwards--as Guy's character is looking for the man who he thinks has raped and killed his wife.  The only problem with Guy's existence is that he has a ""condition""...he doesn't process or remember short term memory.  He remembers details by taking Polariods. Couple this with the fact that there are some dubious characters taking advantage of him so that he can carry out their dirty work and you've got a beautifully shot, cleverly acted story.

The movie moves backwards, from the end of the story to the beginning, so the object of the viewer is not finding out WHAT happens, but WHY.The basic storyline revolves around Leonard, who has suffered a condition called short term memory loss, or the ability to make new memories. The last real memory he has is of his wife dying, after she was ""raped and murdered"" in their home. The premise of the story is that the only thing he is living for is revenge;to catch his wife's killer. The actors are fabulous, especially Guy Pearce, who shows that Academy Award acting often goes unnoticed, probably because of lack of publicity for the film.  The movie is definitely worth renting if not BUYING! The DVD, however, leaves some to the imagination. Repeated viewing of the film does leave previous unanswered questions answered, but a cronilogical viewing would be helpful. However, this would take away the beauty of the film, so some director or director/actor commentary would be useful. Regardless, buy the DVD because no matter how many times you watch it, you will almost always find something you have missed before.

1327768,5,B00003CXZ3,"Christopher Nolan's 'Memento' is unlike any other film you'll ever see, a piece of film noir so original and so tense, it will stick with you for days. Told in reverse, the film follows Leonard (Guy Pearce) as he tries to find the man who raped and murdered his wife. There's just one snag: Leonard suffered a brain injury while trying to protect his wife that fateful evening. He can no longer make new memories, only able to recall his life before the event, everything else fading away within minutes. He wakes every morning still expecting to see his wife, never remembering who to trust and who to fear. Relying on Polaroids and tattoos to keep track of clues he drifts on, forever looking for a man who may be a lot closer then he thinks. From this premise, writer/director Nolan weaves a perfectly crafted tale which unravels itself slowly and methodically through flashbacks. We, like Leonard, are completely lost. By starting at the 'end' of the film, we gather more and more information as the story is presented, a chunk at a time, until the shocking finish, which makes the preceding 110 minutes all the more devastating. 'Memento' is a perfectly executed film, full of wonderful montages and unpredictable twists and turns. The cast shines. Carrie-Anne Moss and Joe Pantoliano are by turns sympathetic and heart-breaking and Pearce has never been better. There are few films out there that truly attempt at reinventing a genre and even less that succeed. This is one of those films and it is not to be missed. If I see a better movie then 'Memento' this year, I will be greatly surprised. A masterpiece.",1001376000,4,1616,4.754448398576512

The plot has been covered extensively in previous reviews, so I won't go into that.  The performances are outstanding all round - Guy Pearce as lead character Lenny is perfectly cast as the confused, vengeful husband.  Joe Pantoliano, as the shady police contact and Carrie-Anne Moss as the sexy bartender are also brilliant: Moss in particular seems to relish her role.  This is a movie for the ages, one to be talked about with friends over drinks.  It raises more questions than it answers - about the human condition, reliability of memory, the power of relationships and context and the confusion of the mental conditions.

1327773,5,B00003CXZ3,"A film noir, with quite a few laughs along the way, told backwards about a man who experiences short term memory loss from an attack that also involved his wife. Since the main character can not remember people, conversations & locations beyond a few minutes he uses polaroid photographs, notes to self & tattoos to ensure his memories are as he can believe & trust. But are they really?
While Memento is primarily an enthralling suspense/thriller about a man in search for an attacker/killer, it also delivers intriguing, philosophical reflections by the main character about the accuracy of memories which we develop over a lifetime.
I've read that the DVD version would have the option to view the film in a linear, chronological order, however it doesn't. That would have been amusing to watch, however Memento would be a -completely- different film if we -first- heard Teddy's speech in the warehouse in the actual beginning of the film. Memento took a long time to reach people & gain merit which is too bad. It's without a doubt the most original, least passive film I've seen in 2001. Every actor delivers a strong performance & there is nothing weak about this film.

It is an incredibly awesome movie about a man; played by Guy Pearce; who is after a man who he believes killed his wife.  There is one minor problem, he cannot create any new memories.  He remembers what happened before ""the incident"", but anything after that he forgets almost immediately.
The movie starts at the end of the story and goes backward, well sort of.  Each scene picks up earlier and ends where the last one began.
Carrie Ann Moss and Joe Pagliano (sp?) do some incredibly interesting and awesome acting to help bring the story to life.  This is well worth buying and owning, or at least renting to watch.",1001030400,,686,4.456
1327776,5,B00003CXZ3,"Memento is one of those rare films that manages to do something new.  On one level, this film is a simple crime thriller.  Guy Pearce plays the disabled Leonard who is searching for his wife's killer despite being hampered by the inablity to make any new memories.  Though the mystery element of the plot is compelling, the true force of the movie comes from its ablity to let you experience a series of events from Leonard's perspective.  The movie runs backwards in ten minute clips that mirror the increadibly short period of time in which Leonard can maintain linear awareness.  You watch as Leonard is thrust into a situation and, along with Leonard, you have no idea how he got there.  It is only after the scene has run its course and the movie skips to the next sequence that you are finally given the answer.  However, every answer you are granted unearths three times as many new questions, and you find your attention rapt and unrelenting as you wait for the appearance of Leonard's next random adventure.
This movie is as compelling as any that have been released in recent memory.  Like ""Pulp Fiction,"" the events of the film are not presented linearly, thus making the editing a major factor in the effect of the film.  The structure is increadibly unique and well crafted.  The movie starts at the chronological end and moves backwards in jumps which are separated by black and white segments that take place in the distant past.  The narrative lines run towards each other and eventually connect using the very clever device of watching a polaroid picture develop (thus providing the bridge from black and white to color).
Guy Pearce gives a tremendous performance.  If he got your attention in L.A. Confidential, he's proved himself to be a formidable actor here, much like Brad Pitt's career defining performance in ""Seven.""  But really there is not much more I can say, the whole supporting cast is superb, the script is well above average and the direction and film construction is magnificent.  This is a daring and thought provoking movie and if you have any interest at all in the genre of film it is not one that you can possibly justify having missed.",1001030400,,2176,4.737400530503979

Guy Pearce captures the tortured Leonard perfectly and Carrie-Anne Moss is amazing as the femme fatale. It  has been so long since a movie that required actual brain power has gotten any press at all that those who didn't like this movie probably just enjoy sitting around watching films where what will happen next is so blatantly obvious a sponge could figure it out.

1327799,5,B00003CXZ3,"When Leonard wakes up during the night to find his wife not next to him in bed, he automatically yells to her demanding that it's late.  When he gets no response except what sounds like muffled screaming from the bathroom, he immediately gets out of bed and picks up his gun to investigate the situation.  As he opens the bathroom door, he finds what seem to be a man atackaing his wife.  Leonard shoots one man directly in the head, seeming to kill him.  When he goes to check if his wife is okay, he is pushed from behind by another man, slamming his head and falling to the ground beside his wife.  As he lays their next to his wife, staring into her eyes, the second attacker runs away and the scene fades to darkness.  This is Leonard Shelby's final memory.  The only thing Leonard has as he begins his search for the man who raped and killed his wife and destroyed his ability to create new memories is a name: John G.
This is the basis of Memento, one of the most interesting and imaginative movies ever created.  Without the ability to hold a thought for more than a few minutes, Leonard has developed a system of ways to keep track of his investigation through a complex series of notes, photos, and tatoos.  The movie is played backwards in a way that a scene is shown for about ten minutes and then another scene is shown of how that scene came to be, and this goes on and on throughout the whole movie.  If the beginning, which is shown at the end, hadn't been done so well, this form of showing the movie would be terrible.  It is, however, very effective in this case.
As Leonard continues his backward search, he meets up with both allies and enemies, most of those he meets are both.  Everyone seems to take advantage of his memory problem is some shape or form.  A personal favorite is the hotel worker who rents him out two rooms, even though he only uses one at a time.  At the end of the movie, most people won't belive that the movie is over.  The ending really seems to leave you hanging.  But this is only because the ending is the beginning and the real ending is shown at the beginning of the movie.  If you think about what happened during the movie, it should all add up.
This movie isn't for everybody, though.  If you talk during the movie or someone talks to you during the movie, you'll miss something.  If you watch the whole movie with no or very few interruptions, you will be greatly rewarded with the privalige of watching (and hopefullly understaing) an amazing film.  This movie may be too fast paced for most, and not everyone will appreciate the backward story telling (it takes some getting used to), but ultimately this film is worth watching, even if it's only to be able to discuss the ending endlessly with those who watch the movie with you.",1000857600,,2787,4.385214007782102

And the devastation is breath taking.
O.K...so maybe that intro overstates the case for ""Memento"" being THE great noir film of the 21st Centuty. But still ""Memento"" takes the film noir genre and it's concerns and wraps them up in the trappings of postmodern thought to take the genre where it's never gone before. It's all here, if you watch close enough: text v. body, perception, reality, identity, the self as a construct...these and more are postmodern themes that have been beaten to death in the literature. When these are combined with the traditional themes and trappings of the film noir, you end up with ""Memento.""
The tried and true noir themes and signs are here: a lead character who has no clue what is really going on, the femme fatale, the third party manipulator, the shadows, et al.  What ""Memento"" does is take these noir trappings and raise them to the nth degree of confusion. ... This is also an outre and compelling crime story...disorienting as all hell, but that's part of the fun.

1327802,5,B00003CXZ3,"Movie Summary: Leonard Shelby has lost his wife and himself in a brutal attack in his own home. His wife has died and Lenny has lost the ability to create new memories. He lives in a fog where the things that have just happened quickly fade into oblivion. The last thing that he can remember is his wife; his wife dying. What keeps Lenny going is the search for his wife's killer. Because of his condition, he can't remember for more than a few minutes, so he uses notes, picture, tattoos, and conditioning to keep himself on track. After searching for who knows how long, Lenny has closed in on the man he has been looking for. But is it the right guy?
My Opinion: Memento was gripping from the very first moment and it hasn't let up even though I've finished watching it over 12 hours ago. I loved the concept of Lenny not being able to make any new memories. It fits excellently with the backward method the story is told with. It took some mental work to put the pieces together one by one as they happened, but I thoroughly enjoyed doing it. The plot was very tight since it had to be able to fit together in small slices backwards. This forced them to have a story that worked; something that other movies are sadly lacking. The subplot of Sammy Jankis rounds out a very full story and makes Memento something very special. I found the acting to be top notch Guy Pearce is awesome as Lenny. I didn't doubt his condition for an instant. Joe Pantoliano is equally as great playing Teddy. Leonard decides not to believe Teddy's lies. We are left on our own to decide. No mater what conclusion I come to about Teddy, one thing is certain: Memento is a highly entertaining movie. It is a prime example of why I love movies like I do. Don't miss it.
DVD Quality: Video: Widescreen Anamorphic 2.35:1 with great video quality.  Sound: DD5.1  Extras: Tons of extras including the entire 50 page short story ""Memento"", Cast Biographies, Newspaper clippings pictures notes and clues from the story, Interview with the director, and Trailers. Menus: The menus are freaky and very cool. Things appear and disappear from different options as you move around. You get flashes of things that make you feel like Lenny.
What You Should Do:  See this movie. See it on DVD and check out all the extra features. If you are a fan of intelligent movies that make you think while they entertain you, then you are going to want to own this DVD.

1327804,4,B00003CXZ3,"This is a film about the dialectics of remembrance and oblivion, about the question of the existance of a real world outside of our consciousness, about the nature of time and truth in a psychological sense.
Given it would be possible that a man has his full capability to think, remember his complete life until a special incident (when his wife was raped and he was heavily injured trying to help her), still can think and draw highly difficult conclusions, but is unable to make any new memories thereafter. He can plan for the future, but forgets within minutes every detail that was ever happening since his injury.
The very last thing Leonard remembers permanently, is the pain to see his wife dying, and his permanent will for revenge.
People used to say, time can heal every pain. But he cannot remember anything since, he even does not know how much time passed by: ""How am I supposed to heal if I can't feel time?"" He's searching for revenge as if this would comfort and relieve him. But he cannot even remember, if his wife is really dead (he saw her dying, but maybe she recovered?), he does not know if he already got revenge ... Sure, he has his photos, but other than people with a normal memory, if he doesn't like the truth he can simply burn a photo in order to clear his conscience.
Trying to give the viewer a feeling of his ""condition"", the film jumps backward in time, step by step, tells the reason later than the event, thereby fully stretching the VIEWER's attention and short-term memory. Only at the end of the movie, i.e. the beginning of the story, the viewer can know, should know, if all of Leonard's conlusions have been logical, in other words, whether or not he punished the right one (or two?).
It's almost impossible to understand the complete plot after seeing this movie only once, and even after the second time you will still not be sure. This makes it really absolutely interesting. For me, the movie is based on a brilliant idea, exciting, made virtuoso, unfortunately with very low respect to reality, but still a rewarding brain-teaser and contribution to a philosophical and psychological discussion.",1000684800,7,2145,4.6923076923076925
1327805,5,B00003CXZ3,"As the year progresses there have been many surprises, but far more dissapointments... Earlier this year I stopped by my uncles theater to see a movie with virtually no publicity, hoping the movie would live up to my uncles recommendations.
This turned out to be, by FAR the best movie to come out this year. The story is about a man who suffered a severe trauma during a tragic event involving his wife. He ends up with what is described as a lack of short term memory, he can remember the big picture... Who he is, where he's from and what has happened up to a moment... from then on he can only leave himself hints as to what has happened.
The narrative is told in reverse, bassically you start in what appears to be a series of episodes starting from the end and culminating in what appears to be the cause of the events. Forcing the viewer to play close attention to the events as they unfold, putting you in almost the same situation as the protaganist himself... you end up trying to keep track of everything that's going on without anything there to remind you.
All I can say is this movie is well worth at least one viewing, if that is not enough for you to make this purchase... nothing will ;).",1000684800,3,1205,4.36

To tell the truth I can't say anything bad about ""Memento"" because I just love this movie! The acting is marvelous and the way the story is told is captivating. Check out Guy Pearce of L.A. Confidential-this guy can act!! Don't know why Hollywood is ignoring him. He held this story together perfectly and allowed us to get into the mind of this poor man who's on a mission that at most times is so hard for him to stay focused on because of his ""condition"" so he delevops ways to remind himself of important details about his quest for revenge that are quite amazing-like tattoos and Polaroid snapshots of people and cars, etc. I liked Joe Pantoliano and Carrie Anne Moss too.

Definitely reminiscent of the Hitchockian suspense, where you're guessing until the final scene. Memento is abot a man who's short term memory has been destroyed and he is trying to puzzle together the clues to who murdered his wife and who assaulted him and gave him this condition. The movie is brilliant in the sense that we are as clueless as the main character Lenny, we are trying to piece things together with him and in doing so we question our own memories and interpretations of the facts. Guy Pearce is swift and glides gracefully from scene to scene with that fragment of fear upon his face like anyone in a condition where they couldn't remember one thing from the next. We totally empathize with his character and we are totally right there with him with each lost and lingering gaze. Memento is so smart that it out smarts even the most intricate investigator, it makes you apart of the puzzle. You become the eyewitness. The eyewitness who can only see what they want too and process the facts. By this movie's end, you'll question what you've seen and heard and wonder have you identified the killer or made yourself the suspect.",1000512000,5,1257,4.718181818181818

This movie, being the classic that it is, DEMANDS so much more.

Like what, you ask?
1) How about an option that would play the film in chronological order?
2) (MINOR SPOILER< - This won't make much sense to you unless you've seen the film) Full, indepth explication of the ""Sammy Jankis - Leonard Shelby"" connection. Maybe the director taking us through HIS opinion(some of us are kind of stupid and may not take the hint).

He lives on a quest to find and kill her attacker. Unfortunately he can't remember any details in the present and thus takes Polaroid pictures and writes himself notes about people and places. There are some characters in this movie who take advantage of his weaknesses and exploit him. Also, this movie starts at the end and works its way backward in time to the beginning. It was a little disconcerting. Though it was interesting for the first half of the movie, it began to lack substance from there on. In the end, is was thoroughly unsatisfying.

Then I saw ""Memento"" and my faith in the entertainment business of making movies was restored to an extent. What a refreshing, absolutely stunning great movie. I don't want to get carried away with adjectives but it lived up to all the hype I had heard on the net about it. The story is not original but the way it's told is. The movie is told backwards with the end at the beginning, but we are given a narrative that is unique in the way it's told to get to that end. Leonard Shelby, who is played exquisitely by Guy Pearce (who is always great in the movies I've seen him in, why hasn't he been up for the Oscar by the way????) is the haunting, tortured main character who's life has been destroyed in one fell sweep by two criminals who raped and murdered his wife and in defending her he suffers an injury which destroys his ability to make new memories. Even with that severe handicap he sets out on a mission to get revenge. What a great theme, and Christopher Nolan the director and screenwriter tells it to us in a way that is unforgettable. Joe Pantoliano of ""The Matrix"" fame is his friend (or enemy??) who sets out to help him on this quest, and Carrie-Anne Moss (also from ""The Matrix"" provides the femme fatale character, and the two of them complement Guy Pearce'S great performance very well. Joe Pantoliano's is able to inject humor, empathy, and charm in his character and Carrie-Anne Moss provides some good eye candy and and excellent acting as well. Even though the theme is serious it has it's funny moments too, and this helped to relieve some of the tenseness of the strong scenes that I found myself caught up in along with Leonard Shelby. Please take the time to see this movie and view it with an open mind and patience. Once you ""get it"", and that may take more concentration than you're used to giving a movie, I just can't see why the ""getting it"" will not be the most entertainment adventure you've had with movies so far this year.

Some have complained that this DVD is problematics because there's no commentary. If you watch the film closely and rewind when necessary, is commentary really needed? It might have been nice to hear what Nolan had to say, but I think this film speaks for itself.

I was hooked on this film from the opening sequence and even though I was in the ballpark in terms of unraveling the puzzle, the ending surprised me.  The most important thing is that the ending fit.  The idea of a man trying to find the person who raped and murdered his wife is old enough, but the twist of making the protagonist devoid of short-term memory is utterly fascinating.  But what makes ""Memento"" great is what writer/director Christopher Nolan does with that clever idea.  Those who complain that the story is one of those post-""Pulp Fiction"" films that plays around with the time should just calm down and realize the story is simply being told in a regressive manner, with each scene taking us back for the next key piece in the puzzle.  Guy Pearce turns in an utterly convincing performance as Leonard Shelby, the man with a mission but no short-term memory, with Carrie-Anne Moss as Natalie, the woman who appears to be helping him, and Joe Pantoliano in a restrained performance as Teddy, who cannot be trusted according to the note Leonard has penned on the back of his polaroid.  The DVD version has a few select treats: Christopher Nolan is interviewed about both ""Memento"" and his previous film, ""Following""; the short story by his brother Jonathan Nolan, which inspired the film and was written contemporaneously; background information about the characters and events you have to searh and find in the ""otnemem"" section.

For a DVD, the added content -- one TV interview with the director, widescreen format, Dolby audio, digital video, small picture gallery -- is unexceptional. For a movie of Memento's artistic stature, a secondary soundtrack featuring commentary by the cast and director would have been greatly appreciated.

1327881,5,B00003CXZ3,"As a medical doctor with a neuroscience degree, I very much appreciated the intracacies of this psychological thriller which has a very real basis!  I do believe the main character over-stepped his capabilities for somebody with his condition; no amount of organization could allow someone to retain that much information.  The character would have to re-read EVERYTHING to the point where he would have forgotten it well under half-way through.  A real person with this condition actually stopped recognizing himself in the mirror because he had aged beyond the point where he was able to remeber himself.  This movie, and anyone with such a condition, is a living nightmare.  Fortunately, it doesn't appear to be overly emotionally painful for the patient.  For family members, it is obviously very painful.  Eventually, they will not be recognized either once they age sufficiently.  This is an incredible mind trip done in an extremely creative fashion-- a fashion that puts you in the main character (patient's) shoes!  This is an experience not to miss.

1327882,3,B00003CXZ3,"In Memento, Guy Pierce plays a former insurance investigator with a rare form of amnesia trying to track down his wifes murderer. What seperates Memento from Dana Carvey's comically fumbling opus ""Clean Slate,"" which had an eerily similar plot, is that Pierce's amnesia is based only around short term memories, which can be as frightningly annoying at times to the viewer as it is to Pierce. Memento also wreaks havoc with the usual time continuom, much in the same way that Pulp Fiction did, tracing it's characters personal history backwards. For the most part this works to great effect in creating an intriguing scenario and thickened suspense, although at times it neccessitates that the plot be overly simplified just so it's easier for the viewer to try to correctly piece everything together chronologically. This brings me to the major faults of Memento. Since the main character doesn't really know who anybody else is, neither do we. The characters are all paper thin and nothing more than shadows, leaving the viewer a little hollow. On top of the poorly (although albeit neccessarily so)defined characterization, the movie ends abruptly and somewhat unreasonably. The conclusion actually negates the importance of everyone we've been introduced to, and implodes what little we actually did know about them. The general feeling we are left with is one of emptiness, as if the previous hour was all just a waste of time. Understandably, this brings us closer to experiencing Pierce's feelings, but is ultimately detrimental. It seems like the writer was stretching for one last plot twist, ala Usual Suspects, that just wasn't feasible. Overall, the first three quarters of Momento is a four star movie, the last quarter is just sort of ridiculous.",1000080000,4,1760,5.13588850174216

To make you REALLY pay attention, everything you see and hear is from the perspective of the main character (brilliantly acted  by Guy Pearce) who has short term memory loss.  Since the plot line is reversed, it grows more complicated at the story progresses and challenges you (along with the main character) to solve the puzzle.  My best advice for the first time viewer is to sit back and enjoy the ride.  You can worry about figuring out the details later!",1000080000,,584,4.621359223300971
1327884,5,B00003CXZ3,"The only film that I can think of that comes even close to the ingenuity of Memento is The Usual Suspects. Like that way underappreciated classic, Memento gives you the ending immediately, and then spends the rest of its time showing you how it got there. Each scene offers clues and various revelations--Leonard's tattoos, why he writes what he does on Natalie's and Teddy's pictures, what happened to his wife, Leonard's job before ""the incident""--each of which are thrilling mini-narratives in themselves.
The acting is first rate. Guy Pearce, best known as ""the one who wasn't Russell Crowe in L.A. Confidential"", is Leonard, a character who will intrigue you, engage your sympathy, and might even scare you by the end. Joe Pantoliano's Teddy will have you debating his intentions towards Leonard for days afterwards. The real acting coup, however, is fellow Matrix alum Carrie Anne Moss--her performace as Natalie will make you love her, hate her, and make you fiercely protective of her.
The movie can only be watched on DVD. Keep the remote handy as you'll want to pause every now and then, if only to read Leonard's tattoos for various clues. After watching the movie, be sure to check out Otnemem in the Special Features section for newspaper articles, pictures, journal entries, and psychiatric reports on Mementos intriguing characters. They will help confirm what you think happened in the movie.  DVD also offers the playful option of choosing to watch the movie backwards (or would it be watching the movie forward?). You will definitely consider the option after watching the movie. I haven't done it yet, but I can't wait to see the effect that it has on the movie.
This movie is worth the critical hype. If you enjoyed movies like The Sixth Sense, The Matrix, The Usual Suspects, Seven, Fight Club, and Dark City (some of my personal faves), then Memento will be the crown of your DVD collection!",1000080000,75,1913,4.922600619195046

The beginning of this movie is actually the end of every other movie out there.  But this works for this film...because like us, the audience, the main character, Leonard, has no idea what occured just before the scene that we are watching.

1327887,5,B00003CXZ3,"... and the bewildering nightmare of life without it--therein lies the crux of ""Memento"", a quietly brilliant film by Christopher Nolan. The film's opening credits, set over the image of a Polaroid photograph in the reverse process of developing itself, indicates the way the story will unfold--backwards. The cast is filled with first-rate actors, headed by Guy Pearce in a mesmerizing performance as Leonard Shelby--driven, tormented, with a sallow, haunted visage that is maintained throughout the film-who suffers from a rare medical condition which has robbed him of short-term memory. He is on a relentless quest to find and kill the man who attacked and murdered his wife, and who is responsible for Leonard's memory malfunction. The ""rub"" is that Leonard can't possibly remember the identity of the assailant. Leonard is only able to track him down by the use of Polaroid photos scribbled with reminders, a few odd post-it notes, and, most chillingly, by tattooing clues to his body, including a constant reminder of the reason for his mission, emblazoned backwards across his chest, readable only by use of a mirror. (An aside: ""We all need mirrors to remind ourselves who we are"", says Leonard at the end of the film-but the film's question to the audience seems to be: what does that mirror reflect? And can we always believe in the truth of that reflection?) While some may find the vigilante aspect of the main character abhorrent, the audience's empathy for Leonard is gained by the poignancy of his plight. In one heart-wrenching scene, Leonard, while burning some of his wife's belongings, wonders if he has ever similarly disposed of her things before and thinks: ""I can't remember to forget you."" ""Memento"" is an astonishing homily about guilt and vengeance (and is vengeance ever really attainable?), manipulation and betrayal, and the lies we often force ourselves to believe when we fall into our own self-inflicted episodes of short-term memory. NOTE: Those with short-attention spans need not apply! This film demands from its audience absolute attention from beginning to end.",999993600,23,2100,5.161290322580645

This is truly a great movie.  The best movie I have seen all year.  Maybe the best movie I have seen in about two years.  Guy Pearce is excellent in this movie.  If you don't know who he is he was in L.A. Confidential with Russell Crowe and Kim Basinger a few years back.  (Also another great move.)
Guy plays Leonard (don't call him Lenny), a man with no short term memory.  Due to the fact that he cannot remember conversations that took place less than five minutes ago, he uses a series of notes and photographs to remind himself of events and people.  He also tattoos himself with important facts that he does not want to forget.
I won't give much away because you really have to go into this movie with a clear mind.  As you have probably already read or heard elsewhere the movie goes in reverse.  It starts at the end of the story and ends at the beginning.  This makes for a very interesting plot device.  Yet it does not make the movie difficult to watch.
The thing I loved most about this film was that there were really no answers, no resolution.  Things were left open to interpetation of the viewer.

The best thing about it is the story. You probably know the basics: Leonard Shelby (Pearce) out to avenge wife's murder, has no short term memory, scenes are shown in reverse chronological order. This is a high concept that is done very well. Memento may be one of the cleverest movies ever. Not only are you caught up trying to figure out what's going on, but many of the scenes are surprisingly powerful: Leonard's tatoo-covered body, his attempts to assert that memory is over-reated, one character showing how easy it is to manipulate someone with his condition. And ""Do not believe his lies"" can take its place along with ""Rollo Tomassi"" and ""Who is Keyser Soze?"" in the neo-film noir hall of fame.
A few gripes: the big twist at the end, while a good one, didn't strike me as quite as original as the rest of the movie. (Don't worry, no spoilers; but I can think of another flick that had a rather similar twist at the end.) A story this complex probably leaves a few goofs in continuity, though it takes some careful observation to spot them. And duh!

1327947,5,B00003CXZ3,"Memento is a perfect thriller it has the twist and turns that are necessary to carry the viewer through the whole flick. But what elevates this film above every other thriller of the past ten or so years is that if you blink, laugh or linger too much on a pivotal scene the whole flick becomes a mosh pit of violence, tragedy and brilliant acting that still ties together at the end but not as tight a knot as it would be as if the viewer would have paid attention. So long story short you will have to watch this dvd at least 3 or 4 times just for a complete picture. The story paints the amazing Guy Pearce as Leonard a modern day Trojan Horse who is used by all the bad guys around him to do their own dirty dealings but Leonard has problems of his own he has a dead wife and short term memory loss. Leonard body is covered in tattoos and pockets full of poloraids of the people he interacts with so he could have some form of continuinity in his life. I won't play spoiler here but the plot is simple but the pace is not. You have to catch the opening to get the endng and the flashbacks don't really excell the story instead they are in place to make the viewer draw their own conclusion as to Leonard's life. Because for all the Trojan Horsing he has been doing some key factor remains Leonard's wife is dead, nobody including Leonard can be trusted, the hand is not quicker than the eye and Memento has to be on eof the most daunting and rewarding films in the history of cinema!",999734400,2,1486,4.181184668989547
1327967,4,B00003CXZ3,"The state of confusion I am left in after watching ""Memento"" is one that is as thought-provoking as it is maddening. The plot twists and surprises that director Christopher Nolan employs in his energetic, frenetic script are intelligent to a fault, ones that tease the mind for hours after the film has ended. And while I was still left with questions about certain plot points and character relations, I was nonetheless enthralled by the experience.
At the center of this frenzy is Leonard Shelby (Guy Pearce), a former insurance investigator in search of the man responsible for the rape and murder of his wife. His search is complicated by the fact that, due to his inability to create new memories, his short-term memory is of no help. He quickly forgets the beginnings of conversations with those he comes in contact with; his only way of staying on track are small notes on paper, Polaroids of those he meets and their names, and homemade tattoos that cover his chest and left thigh.
And here's a surprising twist: the film is told from the end to the beginning, starting out with what should be the film's climax and taking things from there to the very beginning of Leonard's search. This is little more than a device, though it tends to make us ponder the film's many machinations on a much more intricate level of thought. There is more to keep up with, which makes it even more interesting.
As we progress into the film, we are introduced to characters that Leonard has already interacted with at some earlier point in the reversed story. By the movie's midpoint, many of the puzzle pieces are in place: Leonard has been receiving help from Natalie (Carrie-Anne Moss), who is out for revenge against someone who took the life of her own love. At the same time, Leonard interacts with the man we see him killing in the beginning, Teddy (Joe Pantoliano), who offers him information we automatically assume is bogus.
Or is it? The movie keeps this a secret even after its ending, inviting us to think on the subject, to ponder on the film's many turns and spins. There are so many questions that come to mind: who is really responsible for the murder of his wife? Who is the real ringmaster behind all of the mayhem that goes on throughout the film? Who is the mastermind? By the time we finish thinking about it, we're more concerned with who is on top rather than who killed Mrs. Shelby.
And that is precisely what makes this such a fascinating film. It will turn many off for its lack of a final resolution that is blatantly obvious to everyone, but those in the mood for some deep thought will not pass this up. The ending provides no answers, no easy solution to its complex formula of mystery, leaving we, the viewers, to ponder the final conclusion in our own minds, and decipher what has just come to pass in front of our eyes.
The film has its share of effective performances that range from subtle mysterious to all-out masterful. Guy Pearce brings a hushed fervor to his character, embodying Leonard with an inner willpower that keeps the film at a fever pitch. Carrie-Anne Moss is eerily mysterious as Natalie, whose intentions play a bigger role than you would first consider. Joe Pantoliano gives his character just the right appearance, that which instills a great sense of suspicion for his character, Teddy, who uses Leonard's memory loss to his advantage.
My advice to anyone who sees ""Memento"" is simply this: don't give up on it. Appearances can be deceiving, and this is a fine example of that. Nolan's reversal device enhances rather than diminishes the movie's effects, perhaps because it allows us the chance to give serious thought to the events going on. I entered into this realm of filmmaking not knowing what to expect; I came out with a thought-produced headache of pure satisfaction.",999734400,,3822,4.714499252615845

It's not every film where you hear the lead charcater say ""I'm chasing someone,....oh wait, he's chasing me"", I love scenes like that. Guy Pearce does a great job in the film too, it's an very unusual role and he handles it very well. Joe Pantalino and Carrie Anne Moss a very good too as the 2 people he trusts his memories with.

The way this story is told keeps you learning things the way Lenny does - piece by piece, note by note, tattoo by puzzling tattoo.
And when you finish this movie and immediately start it again you realize what an amazing piece of work it really is. For hours afterwards I felt the need to mark things down in notes to myself.
And that's saying nothing of the beautiful and dead on acting abilities of Guy Pearce. (Not once do you find yourself thinking of Felicia in Priscilla, Queen of the Desert!) Most of the time he seems a distant and more talented relative of Brad Pitt. Carrie Anne Moss is multifaceted and perfect as well.

1327970,5,B00003CXZ3,"Probably the best movie of this year, there is no doubt in my mind that it's at least worthy of contention in that category. Memento is a briskly paced movie that's told in the reverse direction, from end to beginning. While some feel that this device is ""gimmicky"" and doesn't add any value to the actual story, I feel that it adds to the movie's central message, it's central theme - what's the impetus for anything, everything that we do?
The dvd is missing commentaries that we'd expect from a picture of this scope, but it makes up for it by including the original short story that the movie is based on. It also has the standard trailers. What I was hoping they would've included was an option to play the movie in the forward direction, from beginning to end.
I've given this movie a five because it exceeded every expectation of mine. You go to a movie to be entertained. This movie made me think...a rare treat in today's market. Guy Pearce is excellent, and Carrie Anne Moss is so cunningly evil in this picture.
While I highly recommend this picture to anyone, I'd hesitate in recommending it to those who watch pictures passively, those who look for a story - a plot, to sustain their attention. Memento is much more than that. At times, it might be overwhelming to the typical movie goer. In any case, it's definitely worth watching at least once. Trust me, you'll remember it after that.

1327971,4,B00003CXZ3,"This film spawned yet another ""movie moniker"" for me: ""Schizophrenic Deja-Vu.""  I can't think of a better description.
This is truly an enterprising way to choreograph a film - from the end, BACKWARDS to the beginning!
The disjointed way in which it is filmed gives you a pretty good feeling for what Leonard actually experiences as his life.
LOTS of plausible motives and suspects are developed throughout the film, so by the end (er, beginning) you STILL can't be sure you have it figured out - and chances are you won't anyway.  It's not exactly a suprise ending, but it wasn't expected either.  Or it was expected along with any of a half dozen OTHER possible endings.
You know those ""experimental"" films where audiences are given a chance to VOTE on where the plot goes, as it actually plays out?  Well, this would be one heck of a good candidate.  The movie could have gone in any of a dozen other directions and been as unique and compelling as ever.
The only down side to this was that of all the possible endings I was imagining, the actual ending was rather abrupt and sort of ""unfullfilling.""  It was as if the director and screenwriter, having gotten this huge machine rolling downhill, couldn't think of a way to STOP it, so they just let it plow into the brick wall at the bottom.  Perhaps not too bad a solution, though.  Given the complexity of the screenplay, I can't imagine coming up with ""the one true ending"" that really settled it all.

1327973,5,B00003CXZ3,"Having ripped the plastic off the the cover of the DVD and shoved it into the player to experience the reversed chronology and intense performances just hours ago when the DVD arrived in the mail, I can assure you that this is a film not to be missed.  Not only is it a film that's not to be missed, but it is also a crucial addition to any film-goers collection.
Memento evokes in the viewer a wide variety of conflicting  emotions, from sympathy to rage to confusion to horror.  Christopher Nolan creates a tense and riveting atmosphere where the simple search for a writing utensil becomes a mans chance to find his own identity.
The story centers around Leonard, a man with a memory disorder that cannot remember what he has done since the brutal murder of his wife.  The story is told backward, so that the audience can attempt to grasp, if only for two hours, the emotional agony associated with not knowing what has come before.
It is a film that resonates with the viewer long after the last reel has played.  I do urge you, though, to not waste your time and energy trying to decipher how he remembers some things (like for example that he has a memory disorder), and focus instead on the weary existence and emotional trauma of a man who knows nothing of who he is or was.",999648000,,1282,4.438297872340425
1327974,5,B00003CXZ3,"This film, easily the most original film (the only other candidate being ""Being John Malkovich"") of the past ten years, is also probably the best film made so far this year. It relies on the most treacherous and damning of human aspects--memory--to not only confuse our desperate protagonist, but also ourselves.
Beginning on a disconcerting note, the film shows a man being killed, and then runs backwards, scene by scene, in ten minute segments. The film becomes not so much as a ""whodunit"" but more of a ""whydunit"" and ""howdunit."" It explains how a man without any short-term memory named Leonard has come to be in California, looking for his wife's murderer. The only things on his side are Polaroids with notes scribbled under them to remind him of important people and things, important ""facts"" tattooed on his body, and two people of questionable motive named Natalie and Teddy.
This is a film where you need to sit down and stay down. If you get up to use the bathroom, I promise you'll miss something crucial (and you'll want to remember everything you can for the astonishing, much-debated ending). If you stop halfway through and try to finish later, you'll have probably forgotten many seemingly insignificant, though undoubtedly important, little bits of information.
Technically, the film is exceptional. The music and cinematography is first-rate, making California look like a bleached, bleak cesspool (the finer elements of Man are totally ignored here). Guy Pearce conveys phenomenal depth and range as the desperate, troubled, yet wry Leonard. Carrie Ann-Moss (almost wholly unrecognizable after ""The Matrix"") shines as the bitter, yet tender Natalie. Joe Pantoliano, of course, plays Teddy utterly to hell. It's a magnificent performance, and one that well deserves award recognition.
This film is by no means for everyone. Some of it is very intense, and it certainly will mess with your mind. But for all those patient and willing enough to sit through it, think about it, and give it a chance, it will prove to be that most rare type of film: a film that proves as intellectually stimulating and challenging as it does entertaining.",999648000,,2155,5.056179775280899
1327975,5,B00003CXZ3,"Like The Usual Suspects and The Limey before it, the ""truth"" if you will about Memento is not told during the actual film, but rather the writer has decided to leave it up to the viewer to fill in the blanks. Post modern and how.
What Chris Nolan does give us is one heck of great film which will keep you absolutely glued to your chair. I even suggest watching it with someone so you can bounce ideas off of each other during and after the movie. Things slowly begin to unravel during Memento, and the end manages to completely unglue everything you thought had figured out concerning Guy Pierce's very well acted character, Leonard Stanley. My friend and I have come up with three possible scenarios, which range from plot loophole to a deranged scerial killer with charm. I'm going to have to study it further.
Oh, the DVD extras are a complete waste of time and contribute nothing to the actual, wonderful movie. I really enjoyed Memento and am very glad that I own it. So i can watch it again and again and etc.",999648000,,1016,4.438502673796791
1327976,5,B00003CXZ3,"Strikingly original and gloriously film-noir, Memento is a rare film that finds the perfect marriage between substance and style without sacrificing the tension, drama, and humor in its well-written script.  The first offering from writer-director Christoper Nolan, and adapted from one of this own short stories, Memento engages audiences of all levels in a murder mystery of the first caliber.
Leonard (Guy Pierce) is hot on the trail of the man who murdered and killed his wife.  He, too, was injured in the attack, rendering him unable to record any new memories - everything fades after around 10 minutes.  Although he remembers everything until he blacked out, including his wife lying dead on the floor, he has formed no new memories since that time.  This unusual condition has obviously rendered his search somewhat problematic, and Leonard is forced to rely on scribbled notes, photographs, maps, and tattoos to attempt to piece together his investigation.
In what has been described alternately as a pedantic, pretentious film-school choice and a masterful way to tell a story, the story is told in 10-minute segments, starting at the END and working backwards.  Therefore, the audience can piece things together in a way Leonard cannot, and our reality becomes totally different from the main characters'.  In fact, one could make the case that Memento is a meditation on the meaning and reliability of memory in and of itself, but I'll leave that one to the scholars.
With its legions of fans, it's a wonder this DVD wasn't released with more extras on it.  In fact, there are FOUR different versions of Memento on the world market, and all four DVDs have their strengths and weaknesses.  The American NTSC-format Region 1 version, seen here, has an interview and the incredible Memento website on it (which, I should note, adds to the story, but only look at it after you've seen the movie, because it might spoil some things).  The Canadian version of the film, also a Region 1 NTSC DVD by Alliance, has no extras but has an option where you can select the film's chapters in chronological order, allowing you to see the movie ""backwards"" (forwards, really).  The French and Belgian version is Region 2 PAL, and lacks all the extras but has an option where you can actually play the film in chronological order, instead of having to go back to the chapter screen 48 times.  And, last but not least, the planned UK Region 2 PAL release (slated to hit the streets on January 14, 2002) will have a director's commentary, the ""play chronologically"" feature, but none of the American version's extras.
This shouldn't surprise people, as Memento was released first in the UK and did significantly better there at the box office than it did here.  However, unless you want to import a DVD from Europe - which requires a DVD player configured not only to play Region 2 discs, but one that can translate a PAL signal to an NTSC signal - the American version will be just fine.  The picture and sound are great, and the chronological mode is basically, as a friend put it, a gimmick.  And, with a movie as good as this, we can live without a commentary.",999648000,2,3158,4.813308687615526
1328026,5,B00003CXZ3,"""Memento"" is surely one of the most innovative pictures in recent years. Christopher Nolan's screenplay (based on a short story by his brother Jonathan) is terrific and introduces us to a complete new way of storytelling. The script should be a shoe-in for an Academy Award nomination.
Nolan very wisely chose relatively unknown actors to play in his complex thriller, so that the audience can focus on the bewildering story. Pearce, well known for his performance as an honest cop in Curtis Hanson's masterpiece ""L.A. Confidential,"" does a great job along with ""The Matrix"" stars Joe Pantoliano and Carrie-Anne Moss.

I watched it on the recommendation of my brother, who I introduced to the world of convoluted, somewhat disturbing, interestingly ended movies about a year ago.  If he had a debt to repay in terms of movie recommendations, he has done so in full.  Thanks Bro.
Acting:
I didn't initially realize that I had seen ""Teddy"" and Natalie from the Matrix, or our protagonist Leonard, from LA Confidential.  Despite the fact that I had seen the players before, this passes my major test, which is to say that I didn't think of them AS acting during a moment of the film, nor afterwards... not until writing this review actually.  Whether you buy into the characters played is a related, but separate matter.  I did, but maybe not everyone will.  <gasp... not everyone can relate to, or understand everyone else.>  If you can get into the characters, you will be well rewarded for it.
Storytelling:
You all know it starts at the end and ends at the beginning, yes?  That's the basic idea, but there's also, ironically, effective use of flashback not relating to the bit of the story shown so much as to break things up even more, and provide more context for the story to develop in.  The forward rolling flashback and backward action merge at the climax quite artfully.
Even without attention to these bits of craftmanship, or even much sense of cause and effect, the movie is not only watchable, but enjoyable.  Very few movies with such pretensions are actually cool BEFORE you know what's going on.
The overall backwards telling is, as pointed out before, not original.  It is however, in the case of this movie, more than a gimmick.  Non-comformity to timeline in telling does lend itself to abuse... all you have to do is confuse your audience and they'll have to watch the movie again... ha ha!  However, it's a step in the right direction atleast in terms of experiencing Lenny's condition and more importantly, the story works better told in reverse.
Again?:
I'm writing this after watching the movie again.  In the first viewing, quite a few iffy movies manage to entertain... a little.  Besides, I haven't been able to think about too much in between viewings.  I think I can wait another month, when it comes to film society to see it for the third time.  I think after that, I might not watch it for as long as a year or so, but I do have to see this movie again... especially with folks who've never seen it before.
Why not 5 stars?:
There pacing problems with the movie... not big ones, but noticeable in parts.  Hang in there.
Some people have criticized the ending as being implausable.  Here's my take on the practical end.  That a person could loose all short term memory was news to me.  I don't know the neuroscience (though I'd be curious to learn), but that a particularly traumatic short term memory might find a space in long term parking before someone in his condition could forget is unremarkable in contrast to his condition.  As for repressing memories... no credibility lost there.
The bigger challenge is with the decision the character makes in the end... it's not unmotivated, and it lends a certain badassedness to the film, but it feels a touch out of character maybe.  It worked better on second viewing, but the voiced over thoughts still didn't quite bring me quite there.  If they had, this would be a five star movie for sure.",999475200,3,3452,4.621311475409836

The plotting is intricate and stylish with the audience put in Leonard's shoes as the story moves backwards, so most of the time we are as in the dark as he is.  Direction and editing (essential in this reverse storytelling) are very fine.
The anamorphic DVD has a superb 2.35:1 transfer, virtually as good as I've seen on disc.  No flecks or damage of any kind, and a complete absence of edge enhancement, artifacting or any other problems.  This picture is vivid and natural, really top notch in fact.

The only snag is the complete absence of additional features, which is sad as this of all films would have benefitted from them.  I reckon a Special Edition could come along eventually.",999302400,,1034,4.919540229885057
1328035,5,B00003CXZ3,The most original movie that has come out this year. Well acted. The beginning is the end. The end is ..... I'm not going to give that away. It leaves you thinking. Such a rare feat in movies today. Definitely worth a look.,999043200,3,223,4.209302325581396
1328045,5,B00003CXZ3,"Ironically enough, the last movie I went nuts over before Memento was also a Guy Pearce film, L.A. Confidential. That was four years ago. Not since then has the film noir genre been brought back not only so well, but also raised the bar for similar films. You all know the story, and if you don't, read the other reviews here. I was fortunate enough to pick up the DVD of this movie I had seen 6 times earlier a week before its release. The disc is produced nicely--the menus show us a portion of the ""first"" scene, in forward playback for the first time. Teddy's backwards cry is heard often, and at one point (I don't know how/why this happened) the order of ""Play Movie/Subtitles/Scene Selections/Special Features"" became ""Special Features/Scene Selections/Subtitles/Play Movie"", and pressing down brought me up and pressing up brought me down. There is also a nice 20 minute interview from IFC with Christopher Nolan, as well as the movie's entire website. There's a nice little tattoo gallery as well. The disc only gets 4 out of 5, however, because it lacks an audio commentary, and also lacks what could be the most original special feature imaginable--a reworked edit of the film. How much would you want to watch the movie in sequence! That would rock! Alas, it isn't here. But I'm sure someone will do it, someday. Email me when you do, ok? Alright, I'm out...gotta go watch it a seventh time.",999043200,18,1403,4.7073170731707314
1328046,5,B00003CXZ3,"I saw this movie originally knowing nothing except that it was filmed in backwards chronological order. Seeing how the movie ends first, I suspected that there would be little suspense or climax as the movie reached its end....well, beginning. I couldn't have been more wrong. With each step back into the past this movie gets better and more intense, and the final scene left me absolutely speechless. This is not only one of my favorite movies, but undoubtedly the most well-written films I have ever seen. Do yourself a favor and watch this one....you won't be disappointed!",999043200,,577,4.958762886597938
1328047,5,B00003CXZ3,"Memento is original, daring and creative. I never experienced quite the same tension in a live theater before as one could feel the whirling brains ticking and clicking as each viewer attempted to process the extraordinary plot. I could ""hear"" mental springs pop out loud as this movie-going audience desperately attempted to keep pace with, make sense of, and follow each twist and turn of the story's spine. A ""grabber"" in the true sense of the word, this film demands contemplation, reflection and respect.",998870400,2,509,5.071428571428571
1328048,3,B00003CXZ3,"A movie such as this, which has an intriguing concept and takes itself a little too seriously just begs to be picked apart. Under close scrutiny the plot just falls apart, which I am sorry to say is what the whole movie is based on. As has been pointed out in numerous reviews, Guy Pearce's character wouldn't be able to remember that he had a memory problem. I wouldn't point out plot discrepencies, as I am the first one to check my brain at the door when seeing a movie. But this one seemed way too pretentious and self-indulgent to allow that to happen. To be fair, it had it's fair share of great moments. The clever chase scene where he figures out he is being chased is cool. The ending is surprising and interesting, it made me think about the movie a while afterwards. The only other complaint I have about this movie, is that if the story was told forwards it wouldn't make much sense, which is my core problem with the movie. It is stylistic, and has interesting ideas about human nature, but still it lacks cohesion and tries to reject hollywood conventions but falls right into them, it may not have the same story structure but that hardly makes it non-mainstream or artsy as some have put it. It will be and already is a huge cult hit, so I guess I'm fighting a losing battle.",998784000,,1291,4.383333333333334
1328049,5,B00003CXZ3,"This movie has been moved up to my #1 favorite movie ever. It is incredibly thought provoking, well written and directed. Guy Pearce does an excellent job and proves just how talented he really is with this performance. I highly recommend this movie to everyone. Although, you shouldn't watch it with that friend who has a need to talk through movies asking ""what's going on?"".",998697600,3,377,4.815384615384615
1328050,5,B00003CXZ3,"Memento is not the only movie about time manipulations, but it is probably the best one. When you are watching it you put yourself in the shoes of the main character (Lenny) then you keep forgetting like he does.

The film is stylish and intelligent, smartly and ingeniously directed, and exploring a number of profound issues such as memory, identity and learning techniques, though it's overburdened by its elaborate and complex plot, which demands total concentration on the part of the viewer, or else the thread is lost. For buffs of ""art"" cinema, but definitely not for those who want some fast-paced, ""no-brainer"" entertainment.",998611200,2,643,5.313725490196078
1328052,5,B00003CXZ3,"Those who describe ""Memento""s narrative structure as simply one that moves backwards are doing the film a disservice. It's much more complex than that. Sure, part of the narrative moves in reverse chronological order, beginning with the end and moving backwards. But another part moves swiftly forward, starting from the traditional beginning. And then there are a series of flashbacks, which jump back and forth willy-nilly through time. It all culminates somewhere in the middle, the various narratives intersecting with a truly satisfying twist.
Those who describe ""Memento""s narrative structure as simply an attention-grabbing gimmick are doing the film a disservice. Sure, it's a unique take on a standard film-noirish detective story. But I'd reason that the ""gimmick"" provides much of the suspense in the story. We know that Leonard kills Teddy in the film's opening scene, but we don't know why. We assume he's got the right man, but the slinky narrative forces us to question everything that we would normally assume. And the twist ending (which really takes place in the middle) would not have nearly the shock appeal if we hadn't already suffered along with Leonard throughout the course of the picture. Our emotional investment in him helps create the exhilarating moment when the curtain is pulled back and we really see who's pulling the levers.  I was grinning wildly at this point, impressed that the filmmakers managed to catch me off guard.
Those who describe ""Memento""s acting ensemble as anything other than spectacular are doing the film a disservice.  Guy Pearce is laid back, stylish, and cool, even when caught in the midst of a hazardous situation.  He's seen it all before (even if he doesn't really remember it), and that world-weariness is worn well in his role as a typical film noir anti-hero.  He's also a fine example of the post-modern unreliable narrator.  This convention, which works well when utilized in literature, is a tough feat to pull off in film, for the audience sees what the character sees instead of being told about it.  The film's unique structure subverts this point, and Pearce is left carrying the load of exposition.  He does it well.  Joe Pantoliano, as Teddy, sports a cheesy moustache and crewcut, and gets to lurk suspiciously after Leonard even while he's playing as if the two are friends.  Pantoliano imbues Teddy with hidden wisdom and cunning, wrapped up in a package that would intimidate no one.  Carrie-Ann Moss, as the typical moll, does well in bringing out her character's street smarts and savviness.  She appears to be in Leonard's corner, but Moss allows just enough doubt to keep her character intriguing.  The rest of the cast appears too briefly for any solid judgement.  Too bad, because Canadian boy Callum Keith Rennie, hee playing a vindictive drug dealer, is a fine actor who could have done much more than what he was given.
Those who describe ""Memento""s writer/director as amateurish are doing the film a disservice.  I found Christopher Nolan's work to be relaxed and assured.  He'd have to be in order to keep the various narrative balls juggled in the air.  A movie like this is ripe for continuity goofs and inconsistencies.  After a couple of days contemplation, I can't find any.  And all this while keeping the suspense tight, the story moving, the visuals appealing and perfectly symbolic.  And even though he does his best to keep the audience up to speed, he never panders to the lowest common denominator by providing easy answers.  ""Memento"" is a movie that you can't watch passively.  It demands (and rewards) your attention.
Those who describe ""Memento"" as anything but a superb piece of filmmaking are doing the film a disservice.  I enjoyed every minute of it, and can't wait to see it again, armed with the knowledge of what really happens.  It's a terrific little movie.
Those who describe ""Memento"" as anything but a superb piece of filmmaking, are doing the film a oh wait, have I told you this before?",998438400,31,4004,4.961077844311378
1328053,5,B00003CXZ3,After seeing this movie you can appreciate that there are people out there you still want to create great movies.  Guy Pearce gives the performance of his life in what I think will go down as one of the greatest films ever made.

1328054,5,B00003CXZ3,"""Now where was I?""............Memento is without a doubt one of the greatest movies of all time and maybe the best movie of the new millenium.  It's originality, and phenominal script out do any other movie I have ever viewed. Its backward chronological order is ingenious leaving the audience clueless and full of suspense as to how the protagonist Leonard Shelby wound up where he is in the present scene.  Guy Pearce and John Pantaliono give amazing performances and Christopher Nolan's abilitys as a director and screen writer portrayed in this movie are simply unfathomable.  This story of ""memory man"" Leonard Shelby's quest to find the man who raped and murdered his wife, is a twisted rollercoaster ride, leaving the audience thinking for days about what EXACTLY happened, and how.  I suggest this movie to EVERYONE!! who appreciates GREAT film and a good suspense story. God, why does Sept. 4th have to be so far off.  Maybe I should tattoo the date on my arm.  What do you think Lenny?..............oh thats right, Leonard, i must have forgot.",998352000,2,1053,4.954545454545454
1328085,5,B00003CXZ3,"At first, this movie is puzzlingly opaque. Who is this man, and why are events unfolding in such a strange way?  ""Memento"" attempts- and succeeds at- the very difficult task of telling a story from two very different perspectives: That of a man with (as we slowly learn) anterograde amnesia (often incorrectly called ""short term memory loss), and that of the people around him with whom he interacts. What makes it even more difficult is that the two narratives appear to be unfolding in different directions, with respect to time. What actually happened- and when did it happen? Who is telling the truth? Who is manipulating whom?

This is an adventurous and totally original bit of filmmaking that strikes out in a completely unfamiliar direction. The cast and acting are absolutely superb, the script is tightly paced, without a single word of wasted dialogue, and the cinematography creates a gritty, noir feeling. The result is a a movie with uncanny sense of realism and individual alienation that pulls the viewer in and holds their attention right up to the end.",998265600,,1070,4.938888888888889

A ""whodunit"" mystery what moves backwards... yep that right you see the end of the story in the beginning and the end which is the beginning is the climax. Definatly a must see thriller where it really is impossible to know who the killer is until the end or was it the beginning?

Not only does it have one of the most talented casts you will see but it has the story to go with it. For some people who enjoy their no brainer blockbusters it might be hard to comprehend but please persevere! You will be rewarded with the most twisty-turny film you will probably ever see. There is just so much to explain that i would not be able to do it any justice. The real appeal of the film for me however lies in the cast. You have three of the best actors you can see at present. Guy Pearce is outstanding as is Carrie-Ann Moss and the ever sinister Joe Pantoliano. I can't understand why Guy Pearce is not on a par with Russell Crowe or Kevin Spacey (co-stars in LA Confidential). He seemed to miss out on all the plaudits and he deserves more than just a glancing nod of appreciation for his talent.
