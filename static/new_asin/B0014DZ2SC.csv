3130282,5,B0014DZ2SC,this is a very good series. I have been waiting for amazon to get it. I got it from some where else. it has poor quality. I would love to purchase this from amazon. when will it be out on dvd? please let me know.,1205539200,17,212,3.7333333333333334
3130283,5,B0014DZ2SC,"I keep checking back to see if KF:TLC has been released yet. But I have already signed up to have Amazon notify me when it is available and am just hoping another person has some news.
Online research shows that Warner Brothers admits the problem is getting the needed agreements and releases to the MUSIC in the series.
Apparently that is the big hold up. I note that Jeff Danna sells soundtrack albums with music from the show, so I am thinking this is the
person to petition. Or maybe tell Warner Brothers we are willing to pay a couple extra dollars, if we can just, please, get the DVD set.
Still hoping to just get an Amazon notice that its ready to be ordered.",1374105600,,667,4.344

3130285,5,B0014DZ2SC,"Really Amazon? These are 2 different tv shows, and you are listing the reviews as the same as the original series. The original always makes me sleepy with its background music. This show got me into it though. Just wish it was released in the US, which looks like will never happen, due to Germany buying the rigts, and locking out the rest of the world to it. :(",1361577600,2,364,4.2898550724637685

3130289,5,B0014DZ2SC,"The original 1970s KUNG FU has been released in its entirety on DVD. Kung Fu the Legend Continues is long overdue for release. If Warner Brothers is concerned about low sales for the spin-off, why not release the two shows together as a special edition box set?  There was a good connection with the original series, the main characters evolved well throughout the seasons, the storyline for each episode had the viewer eagerly awaiting the next. The two series belong together. I would buy a box set in a heartbeat - for myself and all of the Kung Fu lovers in my life.",1350864000,2,570,4.533980582524272

I can't understand why it has not been put out on dvd yet. You can find almost anything on dvd now.

I hung on every word and as I too was searching for wisdom tried hard to practice the nonviolent ways to live my life. This whole collection, to be of value as a teaching movie that it is, must also contain ""The Ledgen Continues"".

David Carradine was superb as his return as the grown-up ""grasshopper"" and Chris Potter was magnificent as Kane's long-lost son. Together, they made a wonderful team catching ""bad guys"". Chris Potter grew up to become a cop and Carradine used his ShaoLin moves magnificently in every episode. A wonderful addition to the series was the ""apothecary man"". He also played an important character in the series. I can't wait for the series to be released on DVD.",1349222400,2,512,4.829545454545454

It's about time that it has finally been released on dvd-I just don't get why it took so long, and it stinks that David Carridean is gone on to the after life.

3130304,5,B0014DZ2SC,"KF TLC was an amazing show!! I don't understand why it is taking so long to put out in DVD, after the first one has all 3 series out now. It only seems logical that this one would be next. From reading other's posts on here, this is one of those shows that for them, and me, it brings back a lot of great memories. I remember Saturday afternoons it was always on in my house. And that theme song, gives me chills everytime I hear it b/c of these memories. It just takes me back :) And now it seems the only way we can watch this show is by watching on youtube (thanks youtube, btw, keep up the great work) or by some poorly downloaded thing off the internet that isn't worth it. And I don't understand why I seem to see a new series out everytime I go to Wal-Mart, and some of those seems to be a little sketchy to me. Why are they out and this one is not?? I think you would generate more interest by putting it out there. Please amazon, hear your customers on this one, and if it isn't up to you, get it to the people who can make it happen....and make it happen!!!!
  I am about to move out of the parents house and on my own, and I would love to be able to have this show to get me through those nights when I long for those Saturday's where everything was a little bit simpler. If I can't go back in time, I can watch a show that can take me there for a few hours. And you can also give some props to the late David C. No matter what you think about him, he could definately throw down the Kung Fu. And of course Chris Potter, in my opinion, nuff said :)
  So please, put it on DVD already. Please.",1296086400,8,1603,3.923076923076923

I actually just wrote an email to WB on their site to encourage them to move up the release of this fan favorite. Hope others will also to let TPTB know they may not be in touch with what the fans want to see. They don't think it would be a big seller so it's been shoved down the list for a 'whenever we get to it release'. We need to let them know we want it now not later.

3130306,5,B0014DZ2SC,"The series is both action-filled and emotionally satisfying, as well as a little cheesy some times, but then again what 90's tv series doesn't have a little cheese in it? Terrific performances by David Carradine reprising his role as Kwai Chang Caine, and Chris Potter as his son. A truly amazing series for its time and some of the episodes are timeless.

3130307,5,B0014DZ2SC,"I found out why this show is taking soooooooo Longggggggg to be released on dvd. The answer came from this source.

......Kung Fu: The Legend Continues
When asked about this title, our contact at Warner Home Video said this: ""The original Kung Fu did well enough for us and was a true classic. (We) don't expect the spin-off to do nearly as well, which is why we haven't green lit, but it's still on our long list.""

3130309,5,B0014DZ2SC,"Even though I did not like the original Kung Fu series, I adored this follow-up series.  It was my absolute favorite TV show ever - even had an ending.  (Forever Knight, Babylon 5 and Stargate Atlantis come in a close second, but all of these dvds are available.)  I don't know why this show has not been put on dvd or at least as a digital video on demand.  In fact, there were several series that used to show on midnight on abc on Fridays that then switched to the Sci Fi channel.  Some have made it to dvd; some have not.  Just because they are not network blockbusters does not mean that they did not have a large following.

The series involves Cain finding a long lost son who was brought up as a policeman after the temple was destroyed.  It is a very sophisticated plot line with very well known actors.  The combination of mysticism and hard action, as well as relationship between the characters is rarely seen anymore.

Go to Chinatown; ask for Cain, but don't ask for the dvds because they are not out even now.  I wish Amazon could get the rights to this, as no one else (e.g., Netflix) has seen fit to do so.",1286496000,4,1123,4.274881516587678
3130310,5,B0014DZ2SC,"With all the years that have passed and even with the original Kung Fu series having been released to DVD, I cannot believe that this series has not been released. When David Carradine passed away this past summer I thought for sure they would finally release this series in his honor. Well, thanks to bit torrent P2P downloads, I do have this series and frequently watch various episodes from it, but I would gladly pay almost any price for a properly (legally) released set of DVD's.

3130315,5,B0014DZ2SC,"A fine four-season show in which the grandson of Kwai Chang Caine of the 1960's hit, Kung Fu, returns.  Played by an older David Carradine, he also bears the name of Kwai Chang Caine and is a wanderer. Where the original show emphasized the contrast of the rough-and-ready violence of its Wild West setting, this series puts Caine into a familiar modern-day police action drama format, contrasted against the peaceful martial arts philosophy.  Naturally, there's plenty of martial arts fighting...No one was smoother than lanky, dance-trained Carradine in exhibiting the flowing grace of kung fu.  The later series also had a greater emphasis on the mystical aspects of Kung Fu and Shaolin.

Caine is reunited with his son, Peter (Silk Stalkings Chris Potter) whom he believed killed in the destruction of their Northern California temple by a renegade Shaolin.  The son is a tough guy police detective in an unnamed Midwestern city who is led to recall his temple training and eventually eases back into the Shaolin way as the series progresses.  Caine settles in the city's Chinatown where he works as an herbalist and kung fu instructor and extends help to those who come to Chinatown in search of him.  Caine is allied with the Ancient, played by Kim (Uncle Benny in Lethal Weapon IV) Chan, Carradine's daughter Calista Carradine makes a few appearances.  Robert (Star Trek's Gary Seven) Lansing was Peter Caine's adoptive father and chief of detectives during the first season until he departed from the show on a Caine-like wandering; Lansing soon after succumbed to cancer, making his final goodbyes all the more poignant.
There are some very entertaining episodes such as the time travel episode in which Caine seeks help from the original Master Po, Robert Vaughn and Patrick McNee appear in two Magnificent Seven-themed Dragon Wing episodes, another episode cleverly did a low-budget take-off on The Great Escape, and a favorite, a time travel story in which Caine goes back to fill in for his wounded grandfather in a fight involving TV Western stars James (The Virginian) Drury, Clint (Cheyenne) Walker, Jack (Maverick) Kelly, and Clu (The Virginian) Gulagher. There's a good wrap-up episode for the finale.
Carradine said he was picked over Bruce Lee because Lee's image was too at-odds with
the visualized character of Caine.  Lee, of course, had every reason to feel he was robbed since he helped develop the series concept, but it's impossible to see anyone else in the role.",1249516800,5,2491,5.041362530413625

It's a mystical police drama, where Eastern-taught Kwai Chang Caine (grandson of the original Kung Fu character) teaches wisdom to Western-taught, long lost son, Peter Caine.

After 12 years, I have finally seen this completely and other than Peter still grating on my nerves at times, it was thoroughly enjoyable. It was fun to see Caine occasionally use my favorite weapon--the staff simply to see the grace and speed of his movements. However, the core--the heart--of what makes this series great is it's stories--exploring faith, love, trust, acceptance, suffering, friendship, and healing--along with characters, masterfully brought to life.

It's terrible  how little I remember of the details of the episodes, and how much I enjoyed seeing the relationships develop between the characters.  I am not a fan of the older kung fu show, but this one was great!  The guy who played Peter Caine was Awesome, and Caine was ok I guess, I'n not a fan of him, but I really enjoyed the character development that Peter experienced as he came more on terms with himself, and his interactions with his father.
The plots were totally awesome cheeze, but they had this more serious side as well, and I loved it.  I always wanted to see the next episode, because I wanted to know where Peter was going on his personal journey.

3130336,4,B0014DZ2SC,"And now for some bubble gum escapist hokum, not too much to challenge your suspension of disbelief, but enough to achieve roller coaster velocity and the thrill of the ride. Ho hum to today's predilection for reality based police, hospital, court room and forensic clap trap. Very clever but highly formulaic and routine. Give me quirky, give me the believable unreal, give me fast track comic book escapist bubble gum.

That's why I like Kung Fu, The Legend Continues. Nothing pretentious, nothing exceptionally clever or arty, no Emmy apirations here. Just plain mindless fun.

It doesn't have the more serious angles of its parent Kung Fu. Its more like Kung Fu meets X-Files meets Star Wars. The Kung Fu action for example is hokey and quite over the top. The actors, well David Carradine plays it like a contemporary Obi Wan Kenobi with tongue, and most else, heading cheekward. His mentor, that old Chinese sage cant fool me..its Yoda with chop sticks. Even the son is a Luke Skywalker clone, learning dad's tricks so that the Force can be with him.

Then there's the obligatory and increasingly nefarious super bad guys, that good old 'Grasshopper' philosophy and the ubiquitous collection of 'help me Obi Wan' damsels (with apologies to political correctness).

It's all just a whole bunch of escapist bubblegum and I love it because of it. Lotsa action, lotsa thrills, not much to think through but for pure fun entertainment it deserves 4 stars. Its worth a peak.

3130337,5,B0014DZ2SC,"First you must know that I love TV series with heart.  Good heroes and spunky characters are a huge attraction to me.  Oh yes, and don't forget out-of-the-ordinary.  Kung Fu TLC has all this in spades.

David Carradine is excellent, as always, as the grandson of the original Kwai Chang Caine.  Thankfully the scripts sometimes make him step outside his usual quiet self, and we get to see some very interesting variations on the Kwai Chang theme.

Chris Potter is Peter Caine, the great grandson of the original Caine, and rather less of the Chinese character than his father.  He's a cop who was separated from his father as a teen, who is angry over the loss and unaware that his father is still alive.  In the pilot they are reunited by fate - a very strong emotional moment - and begin a spiritual journey together which is one of the underlying themes of the series.

The supporting characters are a real hoot, expecially Kermit, The Ancient, Strenlich and Capt. Simms.  Learning more about each of them as the series progresses is a delight.  They all have many suprises to reveal as time goes on.

There were also some amazing surprise episodes that blew us away with the casting.  Check out the Dragon's Wing episodes, for example.

If you don't know this series, do what you can to check it out.

I remember Saturday afternoons it was always on in my house. And that theme song, gives me chills everytime I hear it b/c of these memories. It just takes me back :) And now it seems the only way we can watch this show is by watching on youtube (thanks youtube, btw, keep up the great work) or by some poorly downloaded thing off the internet that isn't worth it.

(Forever Knight, Babylon 5 and Stargate Atlantis come in a close second, but all of these dvds are available.)  I don't know why this show has not been put on dvd or at least as a digital video on demand.  In fact, there were several series that used to show on midnight on abc on Fridays that then switched to the Sci Fi channel.  Some have made it to dvd; some have not.  Just because they are not network blockbusters does not mean that they did not have a large following.

The series involves Cain finding a long lost son who was brought up as a policeman after the temple was destroyed.  It is a very sophisticated plot line with very well known actors.  The combination of mysticism and hard action, as well as relationship between the characters is rarely seen anymore.

3364812,5,B0014DZ2SC,"A fine four-season show in which the grandson of Kwai Chang Caine of the 1960's hit, Kung Fu, returns.  Played by an older David Carradine, he also bears the name of Kwai Chang Caine and is a wanderer. Where the original show emphasized the contrast of the rough-and-ready violence of its Wild West setting, this series puts Caine into a familiar modern-day police action drama format, contrasted against the peaceful martial arts philosophy.  Naturally, there's plenty of martial arts fighting...No one was smoother than lanky, dance-trained Carradine in exhibiting the flowing grace of kung fu.  The later series also had a greater emphasis on the mystical aspects of Kung Fu and Shaolin.

Caine is reunited with his son, Peter (Silk Stalkings Chris Potter) whom he believed killed in the destruction of their Northern California temple by a renegade Shaolin.  The son is a tough guy police detective in an unnamed Midwestern city who is led to recall his temple training and eventually eases back into the Shaolin way as the series progresses.  Caine settles in the city's Chinatown where he works as an herbalist and kung fu instructor and extends help to those who come to Chinatown in search of him.  Caine is allied with the Ancient, played by Kim (Uncle Benny in Lethal Weapon IV) Chan, Carradine's daughter Calista Carradine makes a few appearances.  Robert (Star Trek's Gary Seven) Lansing was Peter Caine's adoptive father and chief of detectives during the first season until he departed from the show on a Caine-like wandering; Lansing soon after succumbed to cancer, making his final goodbyes all the more poignant.
There are some very entertaining episodes such as the time travel episode in which Caine seeks help from the original Master Po, Robert Vaughn and Patrick McNee appear in two Magnificent Seven-themed Dragon Wing episodes, another episode cleverly did a low-budget take-off on The Great Escape, and a favorite, a time travel story in which Caine goes back to fill in for his wounded grandfather in a fight involving TV Western stars James (The Virginian) Drury, Clint (Cheyenne) Walker, Jack (Maverick) Kelly, and Clu (The Virginian) Gulagher. There's a good wrap-up episode for the finale.
Carradine said he was picked over Bruce Lee because Lee's image was too at-odds with
the visualized character of Caine.  Lee, of course, had every reason to feel he was robbed since he helped develop the series concept, but it's impossible to see anyone else in the role.",1249516800,5,2491,5.041362530413625

After 12 years, I have finally seen this completely and other than Peter still grating on my nerves at times, it was thoroughly enjoyable. It was fun to see Caine occasionally use my favorite weapon--the staff simply to see the grace and speed of his movements. However, the core--the heart--of what makes this series great is it's stories--exploring faith, love, trust, acceptance, suffering, friendship, and healing--along with characters, masterfully brought to life.

In David's memory, I join my voice to my fellow fans' asking that this finally be made available to own.

Many thanks.",1245110400,4,809,5.207692307692308
3364817,4,B0014DZ2SC,"Kung Fu- The Legend Continues was just one of the shows that captured the imagination.  A blending of detective stories and mysticism, plus the age old plot of an estranged father and son trying to make things right.  Add just a touch of action and suspense and you have a good show.  I've been waiting for years to see this come out on DVD.  All good things come in time, right grasshopper?  I believe that now may be that time!

This is my 3rd review- 08/19/11. 4th review-Dec 19th ! Was hoping for Christmans gift.. We all have to persuade Warner Bros that the show is worth making on DVD-Region 1 (USA).

I always felt like the MST3K creators were missing out not having a chance to review the likes of this show.  Still, I digress. This show holds a lot of sentimentality for me.  I looked forward to this show every week as a tween/teen because I loved the characters and their light-hearted, humorous, and yet serious approach to the run-of-the-mill cop drama.  I will be THE FIRST in line to purchase this once it comes out on DVD.  Please, don't make us fans wait another minute.

3364823,5,B0014DZ2SC,Kung Fu the legend continues is so superb while I watched the show it was and is one of my favorite TV shows. Chris Potter played the excellent role as Peter Caine and David Carradine as Kwai Chang Caine played his role as Peter Caine's father and as the great Shaolin priest. I am getting restless waiting for warner brothers to get Kung fu the legend continues with all seasons out. All the other characters in the TV show were excellent as well with their role playing like Kermit. So warner brothers please speed up the process to get this wonderful TV show will all seasons out in stores please.,1232668800,4,600,4.463636363636364
3364824,5,B0014DZ2SC,Kung Fu is one of the most honest and soulful stories I ever saw --- the beauty when someone is simply true to himself. It is the everlasting hope that all humankind will at some point be able to cherish life for itself. When east meets west and finally the best qualities are shared. A great inspiration & teaching.,1232409600,7,316,4.372881355932203

The cast was excellent and worked together so well, and the soundtrack was beautiful as well.  Yes, sometimes it was what some might call ""cheesy"", but to me it still told a good story and did what I expect most out of a TV show:  It entertained me!  I've been looking forward to the release of this series on DVD and recommend it to anyone!",1230163200,3,493,4.268817204301075

The show, especially the father/son dynamic, is what drew me in, but the quality kept me coming back. I will buy this series the first day it is out.",1224806400,5,344,4.196969696969697

Cool site for old shows and movies you can't find or just don't want to buy a whole DVD for.  There are very minimal commercials (30 secs) but it counts down the seconds and worth it.,1219363200,5,339,3.9705882352941178

3364830,5,B0014DZ2SC,"I never realized how attached I was to this show, until pre-dvd shows started being released, and now, once every few months, I check to see if it has come out yet.  It's terrible  how little I remember of the details of the episodes, and how much I enjoyed seeing the relationships develop between the characters.  I am not a fan of the older kung fu show, but this one was great!  The guy who played Peter Caine was Awesome, and Caine was ok I guess, I'n not a fan of him, but I really enjoyed the character development that Peter experienced as he came more on terms with himself, and his interactions with his father.
The plots were totally awesome cheeze, but they had this more serious side as well, and I loved it.  I always wanted to see the next episode, because I wanted to know where Peter was going on his personal journey.
PLEASE release this show!!",1215648000,8,862,4.3625
3364831,5,B0014DZ2SC,"I remember as a kid of 10, eagerly waiting for evening on Saturday to see this show.  I was hooked the first episode!  I loved the drama and also the action.  The show did have some silly bits to it, but I just loved the acting and the emotions between Caine and Peter.  Father and son really getting to know eachother again.  The minute this becomes available, I will buy it!  Let it be soon!!!",1214956800,44,395,4.2

3364833,4,B0014DZ2SC,"And now for some bubble gum escapist hokum, not too much to challenge your suspension of disbelief, but enough to achieve roller coaster velocity and the thrill of the ride. Ho hum to today's predilection for reality based police, hospital, court room and forensic clap trap. Very clever but highly formulaic and routine. Give me quirky, give me the believable unreal, give me fast track comic book escapist bubble gum.

That's why I like Kung Fu, The Legend Continues. Nothing pretentious, nothing exceptionally clever or arty, no Emmy apirations here. Just plain mindless fun.

It doesn't have the more serious angles of its parent Kung Fu. Its more like Kung Fu meets X-Files meets Star Wars. The Kung Fu action for example is hokey and quite over the top. The actors, well David Carradine plays it like a contemporary Obi Wan Kenobi with tongue, and most else, heading cheekward. His mentor, that old Chinese sage cant fool me..its Yoda with chop sticks. Even the son is a Luke Skywalker clone, learning dad's tricks so that the Force can be with him.

Then there's the obligatory and increasingly nefarious super bad guys, that good old 'Grasshopper' philosophy and the ubiquitous collection of 'help me Obi Wan' damsels (with apologies to political correctness).

It's all just a whole bunch of escapist bubblegum and I love it because of it. Lotsa action, lotsa thrills, not much to think through but for pure fun entertainment it deserves 4 stars. Its worth a peak.

3364834,5,B0014DZ2SC,"First you must know that I love TV series with heart.  Good heroes and spunky characters are a huge attraction to me.  Oh yes, and don't forget out-of-the-ordinary.  Kung Fu TLC has all this in spades.

David Carradine is excellent, as always, as the grandson of the original Kwai Chang Caine.  Thankfully the scripts sometimes make him step outside his usual quiet self, and we get to see some very interesting variations on the Kwai Chang theme.

Chris Potter is Peter Caine, the great grandson of the original Caine, and rather less of the Chinese character than his father.  He's a cop who was separated from his father as a teen, who is angry over the loss and unaware that his father is still alive.  In the pilot they are reunited by fate - a very strong emotional moment - and begin a spiritual journey together which is one of the underlying themes of the series.

The supporting characters are a real hoot, expecially Kermit, The Ancient, Strenlich and Capt. Simms.  Learning more about each of them as the series progresses is a delight.  They all have many suprises to reveal as time goes on.

There were also some amazing surprise episodes that blew us away with the casting.  Check out the Dragon's Wing episodes, for example.

If you don't know this series, do what you can to check it out.

A message to Warner Bros.:

PLEASE RELEASE THIS A.S.A.P.!!!!!

P. S. The first two seasons are now available on DVD from Amazon, but the price is a bit high for an aging TV series. And where is the rest? Keep it coming!",1212883200,55,1526,4.531135531135531

Fingers Still Crossed.
