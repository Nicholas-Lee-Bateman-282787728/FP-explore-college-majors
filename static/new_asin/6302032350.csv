7820127,2,6302032350,"After a prologue in which the ""devil rider"" kills various people after the Civil War while laughing in a bass-voiced ""Bwa-ha-ha-ha...I'm evil!"" way even cornier than Tony Todd, we jump forward 100 years. Now some present-day yuppies are interested in purchasing the farm as a ""dude ranch,"" creating new victims for the demon/ghost who believes any new landowners are trespassing on the property once stolen from him.

It's a crude slasher/western that's pretty slow at first and hugely inept, but enlivened by some amusingly bad acting and dialogue--landing halfway between amateurish bore and amateurish laugh riot. It takes nearly an hour to kick into (moderately) high gear, after which the amusing part trumps the boring part. But it's still frankly awful. For comparison purposes, you might regard Canadian heavy-metal artiste ""Thor's"" two movies (""Rock 'n' Roll Nightmare,"" ""Zombie Nightmare""). In all fairness, the photography is pretty decent for a low-budget movie, with lots of attractive landscape/sunset shots.

When an actor playing a supposed city slicker pronounces ""scintillating"" as ""skintillating,"" you know you're in the hands of people who really don't know any better. If you're a bad-movie junkie, I'd say this is worth a look for camp value. Otherwise...well, you know the answer to that.",1369180800,,1311,5.390243902439025
7820128,2,6302032350,"If you don't pay attention, this is what you get!  I wanted the obscure movie ""Devil Rider"" (1970) Starring Sharon Mahon, Ridgely Abele, Johnny Pachivas. Plot: A young rebellious girl hooks up with a biker gang. Her mother hires a private detective to find her and bring her back.  However, at the time, I didn't know that there was a 1970 AND a 1989 movie with the same title - but completely different plots.  There was no box cover on the Amazon movie page (I just added them), and no plot or reviews.

The ""stars"" of this 1989 barker are: David Campbell, Wayne Douglass and Rick Groat.  I gave it 2 stars because it does have some redeeming qualities - if you enjoy the old strange horror movies that was prevalent in the 50s and 60s drive-in theaters.  And they do throw in a buxom, full-mooned naked woman at the beginning to keep us guys watching - just in case there is more (there is not).  The acting is very amateurish and the plot is basically a murdering cowboy psycho that cannot be killed, who returns to continue his killing spree of 100 years prior.

You've been warned!",1307664000,,1087,4.454545454545454
