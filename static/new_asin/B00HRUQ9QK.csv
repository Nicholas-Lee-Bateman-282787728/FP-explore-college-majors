6201383,3,B00HRUQ9QK,"Not what I expected.  This is a documentary on WWI originally aired by CBS in the 1960's and re-released for the 100th Anniversary of start of the war.  Because this documentary was produced 15 years after WWII, it trades in German war guilt and is completely foreshadowed by events in the 1930s and 1940s - events that have no bearing on what the monarchies of Europe were thinking in 1914. Also missing is the sheer carnage of trench warfare and the effect of so many casualties on the warring nations.  This viewpoint of WWI may have had some appeal in the aftermth of the Second World War,  but today's historians view the First World War on its own terms - not as the genesis of the Nazi era.",1411603200,12,697,4.421875
6201384,5,B00HRUQ9QK,"An outstanding video!  Highly recommend it.  The historic filmography and photographs and Robert Ryan's narration are excellent and insightful.  I particularly liked not only the war footage but the episodes that explored the culture and events surrounding and leading up to WWI and its aftermath.  There are also episodes on the USA's war with Mexico (Gen Pershing vs Pancho Villa) and the European dynasties pre-WWI.  I can't recommend this dvd set enough. Get it!  It is well worth it and at a very, very low price,too.",1411084800,36,522,5.011627906976744

6201386,5,B00HRUQ9QK,"For someone like myself with a limited knowledge of the First World War, I found this to be an excellent account of the war and its immediate aftermath.  It also gives a good motion picture idea of the war and the conditions in which it was fought. I also like the bonus DVD with its concise histories of World War II, the Korean War, the war in Vietnam, and Desert Storm.  A good concise history of the major conflicts of the 20th Century.",1409788800,18,440,4.289156626506024

6201402,5,B00HRUQ9QK,"World War I is probably one of the most tragically forgotten wars in U.S. history, partially because of this country's late entry into it and being eclipsed by other 20th century events like the Depression, WWII, Korea, Vietnam and the current fiascos in Iraq and Afghanistan.  Those who have done at least a little studying of WWI will agree that it was uniquely horrifying because of its senselessness, basically brought on by a pissing match between various royal families in Europe and Ottoman aggression, and striking incompetence by the armed forces of almost every country in it except for the Americans, Australians, and Belgians, who, despite being run over by Kaiser Wilhelm despite being a neutral country, fought like wildcats when the opportunity finally came to push Germany back.
  This DVD set is remarkable despite its being released in 1964 after the series aired on CBS, back when history shows actually had viewers who were still interested in learning something besides keeping up with Kardashians, fashion networks and other totally useless programming today that is more of an insult than entertainment.  Narrated by Robert Ryan, it uses authentic film from the actual pre-war years, the war itself and post war.  I severely doubt any single source has the amount of genuine footage this program had.  It is very accurate, puts blame where it belonged, particularly in the hands of the incompetent British commander Douglas Haig, who was monumentally stupid along with most of the rest of the commanders, Winston Churchill, who ordered the pointless slaughter of over 50,000 British troops at Gallipoli in Turkey, basically herding them onto very small strips of beach to be pinned down and shot and mauled with artillery fire by superior Ottoman troops who only had to maintain higher ground and mow down troops ordered to attack where it was impossible.  Despite criticism for the needless carnage, Churchill never admitted failure and wanted to keep killing men until they could break through the Dardanelles and control the Black Sea.  Finally the Brits had to withdraw in total defeat, not gaining one inch of enemy ground and losing several ships and subs in the Straits too.  As history shows, Churchill wasn't done.  He was dead set against Britain taking part in D-Day when plans were being drawn up, preferring a long difficult march through Italy and trying to cross the Alps.  That would have bogged the Allies down terribly and had FDR not told Churchill he damn well better be ready to pitch in on D-Day, the end of the war would have been much farther away.  Appointing another British general lunkhead, Bernard Montgomery was a Churchill idea, and Montgomery was infamously slow in helping soften the beaches at Omaha and getting his naval support and troops to the beach heads.  I submit Churchill was a grandstanding military idiot who is not worthy of the adulation he unfairly receives to this day.
  But back to the DVD - we get the horrors of the Somme, the pointless back and forth attack and retreats that annihilated northeast France and most of Belgium for years and the U.S.' involvement that finally resulted in drafting men after the Germans announced unrestricted submarine warfare and were sinking American cargo vessels.
  Worst of all, France and Britain were so vengeful toward the Germans that it wiped them out as far as food and clothing was concerned.  An ambitious German corporal, Adolph Hitler took the extreme surrender terms badly, and 25 years later would exact a terrible revenge.
  I can't recommend this DVD enough.  It's easy to watch in 30 minute installments, or all at once.  In a world that is on the perennial brink of total war, or so it seems sometimes, one would be hard pressed to view a DVD that points out just how ultimately pointless war is.",1491177600,7,3825,4.953051643192488

6201409,5,B00HRUQ9QK,"I concur with the others who have praised this fine series (which i remember seeing as a child). I must add, also, that the music score by Morton Gould is one of the most stirring of any war series, right up there with Richard Rogers' score for Victory at Sea. My only quibble with the series is that they changed the opening title scene from each episode (where the soldier in the trench hunches down aiming through his rifle. I bought this centennial edition from Amazon and highly recommend it!!",1473638400,4,498,4.544444444444444
6201410,5,B00HRUQ9QK,"This documentary which originally aired on CBS in 1964 has by far the most interesting historical film footage ever compiled.  That would be enough to purchase this, but there's more to it than great film.  Robert Ryan narrates the 26 episodes in such a way that nothing is left out to his description of the events that seemingly were all interconnected.  I have viewed numerous films of WWI over the past few decades, but this truly ranks at the top.  Only""The Great War""--now unavailable comes close to the true horror of the world's first modern war fought by ordinary young men led by incompetent leaders, as the death toll reached in the millions.

6201412,5,B00HRUQ9QK,"An excellent production, so far (only on 2nd of 3rd disc).

Comprehensive, yet informative, with coverage of background stories / facts. Good selection of ""extras"" included on each disc.  GREAT:  video footage, from French, British, American sources, probably others too; music score; script and voice; titles; editing. Does not appear to have been designed for TV viewing since various ""chapters"" are not limited by specific time limits. The ""chapters"" will vary in length based on the topic.

Would definitely recommend - great value for home library and for others wanting to understand USA's entry into a worldly arena. The European WWII theater may have evolved from the manner that WWI was ""resolved"".  Another instance explaining about how history does repeat!

6201426,5,B00HRUQ9QK,"World War I is one of those things that is so muti-faceted and complicated, it is almost impossible to get the full scope from just one source. This video documentary comes pretty close. Books on the subject may seem overly dry or overly detailed, simply because the subject makes it unavoidable. Well organized, this video version shows the viewer the history as it happens, in actual footage of the war as well as  supporting activities. Each chapter is well edited historical footage of events put into an understandable sequence, with Robert Ryan narrating the story. I would suggest this as the first source for anyone wanting to understand World War I. Other sources should be used to fill in the blanks or add details especially since there have been more details learned in the years since the video was made. But this is as comprehensive an explanation as one is likely to get from one source, and easy to understand besides. It is also surprisingly even-handed, giving credit as well as criticism to both sides in the conflict. It is several hours worth of historical footage, giving the viewer almost a feeling of having a window into the past. It will take days to get through all of it, but it is well worth the time.",1435276800,,1230,4.694444444444445
6201427,3,B00HRUQ9QK,The main problem with WWI history is that everyone who had a major role in it is dead.

more about the antebellum tensions between far from innocent France and nascent Germany.

Narration is written and performed first rate; soundtrack tends to get rather repetitive.
American involvement is given a couple of chapters, though the Wilson regime's many hypocrisies are so typically minimized.
