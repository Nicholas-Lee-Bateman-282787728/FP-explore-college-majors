8000089,5,B0000D8UC2,"This movie is awesome!  I got it at the drug store down the road for 4.99!  (An awesome deal)  I liked it so much I decided to Google it and ended up here.  If you like really cool ""B"" Italian action movies, likable good guys, and ""hardcore"" bad guys than Black Cobra is a must own.  The story is great! Detective Malone (Fred Williamson) must protect a female fashion photographer from the ruthless Black Cobra biker gang and their indestructible leader Snake (Karl Landgren), after she sees them kill her neighbor. This results in a lot of cool action including various show downs with the Malone and the Cobras in different settings.  Add cool poppy 80's music, ""Dad this is the A-HA!!""  and a cool funny ladies man side kick for Malone, and you get a one really enjoyable action movie.  The climaxes are great too, especially when Malone and his buddy have to rescue the chief's daughter from the Cobras in the abandoned parking lot.  Oh and the closing theme song is rrrrrreally cool.  Happy Happy Italian 80's pop rock!  ""Take me to Ameeeerica!""  I give this the highest rating I possible can!

 And I'm not the only one who enjoyed this movie they're 2 more Black Cobra movies (AKA Cobra Nero 1-3).  I got the Legacy entertainment version DVD.  It preserved the original film and sound quality which is a big plus, and had nice menu music.  On a technical note, the volume was a little separate, but if you turn your TV up its fine, it's not too loud and you can hear everything.

Legacy is great, it get all my kung fu, and action pics from them.  If you looking for cool Bruce Lee clone movies Legacy is great.  And Black Cobra maybe the best DVD I have from Legacy.",1105833600,,1675,4.447368421052632
8000090,4,B0000D8UC2,"Other reviews on here say this is a bad copy. That's too bad.
All three Black Cobra flicks are fun vehicles for Fred ""The Hammer"" Williamson fans who dig this sort of thing. There's a better deal for Black Cobra and Williamson fans here on Amazon: check out the Strike of the Black Cobra DVD with all 3 Black Cobra flicks for six bucks and some change! Great deal Amazon!",1100736000,,371,4.314285714285714
8000091,2,B0000D8UC2,"A COP [FRED WILLIAMSON] IS HIRED TO PROTECT A YOUNG PHOTOGRAPHER FROM A VERY MURDEROUS MOTORCYCLE GANG. THIS POORLY FILMED ACTIONER IS YOUR USUAL ACTION FLICK. BUT, IT IS OCCASIONALLY FUN TO WATCH. AT LEAST THERE IS SOME GOOD ACTION AND THERE IS SOME COOL VILLAINS. THOUGH THIS IS QUITE FAR FROM BEING A GOOD MOVIE, IT'S MUCH BETTER THAN ONE WOULD MOST LIKELY EXPECT. FANS OF FRED WILLIAMSON WILL MOST LIKELY ENJOY THIS. IF THIS FILM ONLY HAD A BETTER SCRIPT AND SOME BETTER ACTING, THIS MIGHT'VE BEEN A MUCH BETTER MOVIE. SHOCKINGLY, THIS MANAGED TO SPAWN TWO SEQUELS.",1094774400,,569,4.7
8000092,2,B0000D8UC2,"I find it funny that the movie sells here for [money], when I can pick it up at Wal-Mart for [money] Canadian here, and it's still not worth it.  And judging by the previous review, the DVD quality probably isn't any worse.  The picture was extremely dark and grainy, and looked like it was shot in the early 70's rather than the late 80's.  The music was of ok quality, but didn't really suit the movie well in my opinion.  But then again, I was expecting blaxploitation, which despite the title, really had nothing to do with that genre at all.  Plus the voices were of very low volume when compared to the music, so I found myself turning the volume way up to hear the speech, then way down when the music came blaring in all of a sudden.  As far as the voices themselves, the lip synching was horrible; I felt as if I was watching an old asian kung-fu flick.  I guess if there was any saving grace for this movie, it was just how bad the actual acting and story were; almost laughable, which was what kept me from giving this movie a 1.  I'm a big fan of B-movies, so I can forgive alot the predicable and often retarded things I saw in Black Cobra.  But the DVD quality alone is enough for me to not recommend this movie.  Plus Black Cobra is ... whipped, the Zombies biker gang are laughably un-tough, and you only get to see one boob.",1073347200,2,1341,4.223529411764706
