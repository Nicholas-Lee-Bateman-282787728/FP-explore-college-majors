8005767,5,B00013A0GU,"The title of my review essentially speaks the truth Ray invested a lot into this product and has an affinity for the Fleischer's work and is the undisputed expert of all things Fleischer. This package not only has added sound effects and scores to enhance the quality but the picture quality is well ahead of most other distributed/publicly seen versions of Out of the Inkwell. Even though Ray should be credited for resurrecting the classics the cartoons have to hold their own as well which they essentially do. Ray's talents for preserving classic cartoons could only do so much if the classic cartoons were mediocre. I see this set as a team-effort, have exceptional material to work with and then take the initiative to preserve it and enhance the quality with sound-effects, music, and picture quality. The annecedotes that he discusses inbetween segments are insightful but are fairly basic in comparison to what Ray really knows. Based on viewing his posting history the man himself can get a lot more intricate than what is seen on here, though it might be affiliated with not trying to go above peoples heads.

The penmanship is superb and second to none in the nineteen-twenties especially after the entrance of Dick Huemer in 1923. It is a sad state of affairs to see how much potential the brothers had and was unrealized because of how far they fell in the thirties a lot more could have materialized that didn't and this set shows what they had going for them. They were overly dependent upon Paramount who was more interested in commercially exploiting them than allowing them to artistically progress. One wonders if the cold personality of Adolph Zukor had watched these shorts collectively he might have had a change of heart and allow the Fleischer's to grow. Ray obviously brings back the spirit as if your at a silent movie house amidst the 1920's.

It is interesting to see the company artistically evolve through out the twenties. When the series initiates in 1919 we essentially see the brothers experiment with themes to showcase the capabilities of the rotoscope obviously shorts like Perpetual Motion convey their affinity for science and technology. The Oujia Board is essentially a mainstay in silent animation but the Fleischer's execute with much greater fluidity and grace. They become less technically limiting by 1923 with the arrival of Dick Heumer and arguably hold the technological lead in the industry by a large margin until the rise of Disney.

We see them reach their peak in the mid-twenties, than Alfred Weiss taking over showcases a noticeable shift in the films and the end to this remarkable series ends. Though this was arguably one of the most influential series in American Animation history. Walt himself was partly motivated to join the industry under this series, when taking that into consideration it was obviously pervasive and possibly the most unsung series in animation history. Its importance is just as great if not greater than how unknown it is. Ray has the best prints so if you go to any source to buy definitive silent animation please make it Inkwell Images.",1305590400,2,3126,4.93916349809886
8005768,5,B00013A0GU,"Koko the Clown was always funny and 100 years later, he is still funny.  I purchased the DVD for myself as I was introduced to Koko in the 1980's and lost the VHS.  However, the DVD has been used countless times since to entertain nieces, nephews, church school classes and now Koko has made his foray onto college campuses at RIT and SUNY Brockport where he has become a Saturday night staple and somewhat of a cult figure.  Go boldly into the 21st century Koko!!!!!!",1171152000,7,468,4.482352941176471
