993041,5,6305229449,"True, in this beautiful Disney tale of a young chinese girl, Disney gave us a strong female heroine who did stand up and create an ancient ""women's lib"". But beyond this, this movie is sheer eye candy.  With beautiful scenery and breath-taking computer animated scenes, this  movie is by far my favorite. Not to mention GREAT characters. Eddie Murphy  adds hilarity to the tiny dragon Mushu. I recommend this one highly!!!!",913075200,,423,4.929577464788732
993042,5,6305229449,"This film had the usual Disney excellence in animation, music, visual impact, etc.  But what really pleased me (as a mother) is that finally we have a strong female heroine, whose stands up against the patriarchal  nonsense... a wonderful story of a young woman conquering her fears and  finding/creating her place in a world where she doesn't fit, where they  will not hear her.  Mulan has the courage to step outside society's  ""norm"" and be herself, to persevere and find her power, and thus  achieves greatness.  Although she does finally marry, she marries as an  equal, far different than the matchmaker tradition of her times.... and  marriage is just a part of her story instead of the ""goal"" of her  life (or the movie).  The story is exciting, amusing, heart-warming, and  inspiring... with a taste of education about an ancient culture and a  much-welcome dose of feminism.  Great stuff!",911520000,,898,4.932885906040268

993886,2,6305229449,"Although the film Mulan tells the story about the courage and persistence of a young girl who becomes a hero, or seen as a women-empowering film, I did not particularly enjoy the overall content of it after considering repeating occurrences of examples that promoted and displayed traditional gender roles, stereotyping the female gender.

In the beginning of the movie, when Fa Mulan met a matchmaker for an arranged marriage, she had to make herself presentable and not only look like, but also be what was considered a beautiful woman. She was expected to be the perfect bride by presenting herself with pale skin, bright red lipstick, flattering makeup, and a small curvy waist. All, which are physical features that made women distinct, which partly defined what it meant to be feminine. If one did not have these attributes, they would not be essentially 'good enough'. The emphasized physical features that Mulan showed contributes to what was expected for a woman to look like to please men. Clearly, a lot of effort, work, and time was put into trying to get her ready and presentable even though Mulan herself, was not happy with it as seen from her sad and confused facial expressions during this scene. It caught to my surprise, that it is still relevant today, that women still spend large amounts of time and money to purchase makeup and clothing to make themselves feel beautiful with the motive to impress others, such as male beings.

However, when the matchmaker was inspecting her physical traits, she saw that Mulan was very skinny, and made the remark that, too skinnynot good for bearing sons. This was the opposite of what her mother and the ladies that helped her get ready tried to achieve, creating essentially a double standard that could confuse women of what was wanted from them. It shocked me to see the contradiction of whether to be skinny and beautiful, or wide and still beautiful, to produce offspring, because it seems impossible to me that one can be both at the same time. It also disturbed me when the matchmaker stated sons specifically.  This can be interpreted that only sons were desirable, as if females were genetically programmed to be worthless and inferior, no matter what type of personality they have.

Not only was Mulan was expected to be physically beautiful, she was also expected to demonstrate ladylike traits. She had to show etiquette, manners, and intelligence, and she had to cheat her way through mastering those characteristics by writing specific words to remind her on her arm such as, quiet and demure, graceful, polite, delicate, refined, poised. She had to disguise herself as someone she wasn't to meet what was expected. She couldn't speak her mind to stand up for herself and had no say as it isn't a womans job or business to meddle into the important related affairs. A way she could show such attributes, was knowing the correct way to pour tea. This demonstrates the notion that women are to be the servants of the household to serve the men and be the homemaker.

Later, Mulan made the decision to go to war disguised as a male in place of her sick father. The song, Ill make a man out of you displays lyrics that outlines the traits of masculinity and essentially looks down upon anything related to women traits. The men sang, You must be swift as a coursing river. Be a man. With all the force of a great typhoon. Be a man. With all the strength of a raging fire. Mysterious as the dark side of the moon. These could be understood as the necessities of one being worthy to fight in a war. These traits is what defined what a true man is like, that all men who would matter had to be this way. This creates a stereotypical representation of the clear line between which gender is more superior and physically stronger. The traits discussed are none of which the traits were expected from Mulan, or even anywhere like it.

Another song that the men in the troops sang was, A Girl Worth Fighting For which discussed what the men individually looked for in a woman. Yao, Ling, and Chien Po sang, I want her paler than the moon with eyes that shine like starsMy girl will marvel at my strength, adore my battle scar I couldn't care less what she'll wear or what she looks like. It all depends on what she cooks like, beef, pork, chicken. My girl will think I have no faults, that I'm a major find"". Everything that they stated are qualities that they men could use for their own benefit. Yao valued a woman with physical attractiveness, Ling ideally wanted one who would make him feel good about himself, and Chien Po wanted basically a homemaker who can cook well. All of which are feministic attributes to how a woman should traditionally be like. This seems fairly stereotypical and gives the idea that men are selfish and like to use women as objects to better themselves.
No matter how big Mulans accomplishments were, she did not get full credit from everyone. Even her own friends from the army no longer supported her once they found out she was a woman disguised as a man, resulting to not listening to her ideas and kicking her out. It was an entirely different story when she was known as a male. Praise and celebration became underappreciated and ignored in a heartbeat.

In the end, Mulan did save China. She demonstrated quite heroic and brave traits to save her people, such as the king, her friends and family, and the citizens from the Huns. She was obviously quite the opposite of being a weak, vulnerable woman which was emphasized throughout the film what a girl is like. That was quite the high point of the movie of finally seeing that Mulan, a woman can do something that important and outstanding. She stepped out of her gender zone and did something incredibly different. Yet, the emperors underling still criticized how she is will never be worth anything because she is a woman. This brings back to the point where how simply being a woman voids what greater good and success is done. That it is not considered something important unless it is done by a male specifically.

In conclusion, I feel that Mulan demonstrates more negative messages than it does positive as the discriminatory scenes and dialogue are often overlooked when the creators ridiculed the female gender. The portrayal of the two genders differ through the characters dialogue, actions, and attitudes. Rather than displaying equality or individual rights, the film reinforces the traditional gender roles that are assigned to simply being a female. The gap between gender equality and stereotypical gender roles grew bigger and bigger as the film progressed and left me speechless to see how a Disney film, that was supposed to be a positive source toward young children would imply such negativity.",1478649600,,6770,4.750850340136054

No, it's strange that Disney would present a movie in which there are screen shots of an entire army (and their horses!) lying dead, or indicate that someone is about to get shot dead with an arrow, or have the heroine help kill thousands of people with cannons and an avalanche.  Surely this is the only Disney heroine with a body count to her name.  Still, real life calling.  The movie presents a real historical period, the Han dynasty, and the cultural situation is beautifully depicted.  The details of food and dress, architecture, weapons, everything is well done.  The family dragon spirit keeps things light and shows the importance of the ancestors in Chinese life.  My kids love it and as time goes by they'll hopefully start to think more about the larger issues it presents.

It shows that women can do a lot of the same stuff men can do and sometimes they can even do more. Everyone has their own opinions and favorite movie genres; Mulan gives you a little bit of everything: action, comedy, romance, tragedy, and animate. This movie lets their viewers see how beauty and strength can be in the same person. People, I have seen Star Wars, Jurassic World, Avatar, and The Breakfast Club. These movies are no Mulan, because with a name like Mulan, you know it has to be great. Now, everyone knows our generation is lazy and watches a lot of Netflix, Hulu, or any other T.V. things. I can tell you I have done my fair share of sitting on the couch binge watching all of our DVDs and Netflix; this means I have watched plenty of movies (especially the Disney ones). Even when I am 18-years-old, I still am more excited to watch Mulan than any other movie out there. Mulan is not just a movie, it helps teach you a way of life that you can be who you want to be and make your own life great. But wait theres more, it lets you know that you're capable of taking life into your own hands rather than just sitting there, watching it go by.

  (WARNING! Spoilers are contained in the following!)

Plot: Loosely based on The Ballad of Hua Mulan, the movie tells the story of a young Chinese girl named, well, Mulan.
Her family wants her to find a suitable husband to uphold the family honor according to Chinese tradition. Mulan tries to live up to her culture's expectations of women, but her clumsy, tomboyish personality makes this very difficult.
  Then, her life changes forever when news reaches her town that the Huns have invaded China. By order of the emperor, one man from every family must join the army.
  As her father is elderly and wounded, Mulan fears for his life. So, she disguises herself as a man, and with the help of a dragon named Mushu, goes off to fight for her country.

  The Six Questions.

Is it funny?
Yep! Kids aged two to ninety two will get a kick out of the little, fast-talking Mushu. He provides most of the films comic relief. It is especially amusing when he gives Mulan bad advice about how to act like a man.
  Disney is very good about avoiding humor that is crass or hurtful. And Mulan proves it.

  2. Is it romantic?
Well...There is an attraction between Mulan, and the hunky captain Li Shang.  I emphasise attraction because it really doesnt go beyond that.
  If I made a list of the most romantic Disney Princess films, Mulan would probably be the second-to-the-bottom (the first would be Brave.)
  Why would I say that? For one thing, this is the first Princess film not to have liplocks.
For another, the scenes between Mulan and Shang that hint at romance the most are so lame, that I cant hear it without wanting to roll my eyes and bang my head against the wall.
  I'm not saying that every Princess flick has to have romance: Im saying that, if you do hint at love, make it good. For example, at the movies end, after Mulans identity is revealed and she's saved China from the Huns, she stops by Shang. He awkwardly tells her: umyou...you fight good.
  She doesn't get the compliment.
Why didn't Shang give her a simple smile as she triumphantly rides home? She could've smiled back, or even blushed! There you go. You got the hint, and its not at all cheesy.
  Ive said enough.

3. Is it thrilling?
Yes. Although Mulan is rated G, there are still plenty scenes that show the characters are at war.
  And there are two big battle sequences. The first one with the Huns charging down the mountain, similar to the buffalo stampede in The Lion King. Except these Buffaloes are carrying very sharp swords and shooting flaming arrows.
  The last one is toward the end. Its mainly between the main characters and Shan Yu the villain, so its slightly less exciting. But only slightly.
  No one is killed on screen.

4. Is it heartwarming?
Certainly! Mulan is the first Disney female lead since Belle to have a personality, a brain, AND a heart.
  In the end, Mulan is successful in her quest to save her father and country, not because she followed her heart, but because she used her head. In doing so, she earns the respect of her people.
  Speaking of her father, Mulan has a wonderful relationship with her parents. Theyre kind, concerned for her safety, and when Mulan accidently disgraces her family, they don't cast her out. They comfort her.
  The other men (with the exception of the bad guys) are also strong, brave, and hardworking. The most heartwarming scene is at the end when Mulan comes home. She presents the sword of Shan Yu, and the crest of the emperor. Very prestigious awards.
But her father tosses them aside, and embraces his daughter. He says: The greatest gift and honor is having you for a daughter. A gentle reminder that the best rewards are right in front of us, rather than material things.
  Mushu the dragon was demoted from his post as guardian. In order to get it back, he makes a few selfish choices. But, he makes up for them by sticking with Mulan through thick and thin. Just like a true guardian.

5. Is there anything else I liked?
Certainly! There are four songs in the film. The first one Honor To Us All shows us what the ancient Chinese culture was like.
The second one Reflection (my favorite) is sung by Mulan as she struggles with her desire to please her family, and her wish to be herself.
The third song Ill Make A Man Out Of You is a lively montage as Mulan and her fellow troops prepare for war.
The final song A Girl Worth Fighting For is about the men singing about their ideal women, to take their mind off the hardships of battle. Although its rather out of place (plot wise, because none of the guys end up with a girlfriend) it still has a catchy tune.

6. Are there any negative elements?
Not many. I already mentioned the romance issues. But in one scene just before battle, were shown a village that has been ransacked. We briefly see bodies lying among wreckage. Although theres no blood, it is a rather disturbing image.
  In one sequence, Mulan is taking a bath in the river.and the guys decide to jump in. No choice parts are seen, but it is uncomfortable...so much so that when Mulans clean, she says emphatically to Mushu: I never want to see a naked man again!

  6. Would I recommend this film?
Absolutely! Mulan is a truly funny, heartwarming, and beautiful movie. Its one of my favorite films. I think you would would love it too!",1457568000,,5311,4.514675052410902

994458,5,6305229449,"Although it's classified as a ""princess"" movie, it's so incredibly different.  Mulan is a girl who doesn't know where she fits in, speaks her mind in a society where women are to be ""seen and not heard"", and wants to bring honor to her family and be able to like herself.  She's not a damsel in distress, but is smart, strategic (though her strategies are often outlandish and outside the box), strong, and brave.

The soundtrack and music is probably the best I've heard in any Disney movie; there isn't a single song or track in the movie I didn't like.  The characters are excellently done, and the time period was also well represented.  The story is actually based off of the ""Ballad of Mulan"", a story from China, though with obvious differences.

This is a must-watch for Disney fans, and particularly those who want to see the ""damsel"" save herself (and maybe China while she's at it).",1447027200,,893,4.620253164556962

994664,4,6305229449,"Disney has had many, many hits over its long reign over animated films, but also its share of misses (though given the sheer number of films they've created, there's bound to be some misses in the mix).  For a period of time in the '90s, the renaissance they enjoyed through films like ""The Little Mermaid,"" ""Beauty and the Beast,"" ""Aladdin,"" and ""The Lion King"" started to fade, and Disney sought to regain their glory days through a string of more dramatic films -- ""The Hunchback of Notre Dame,"" ""Pocahontas,"" ""Tarzan,"" and others.  While many of these films did quite well at the box office, they aren't as fondly remembered as the classics, and many people point to their more dramatic nature as the reason for their failure.  I disagree -- I think the main failing of many of these movies is that Disney tried to have their cake and eat it too, by going for a more dramatic tone but still clinging to their trademark musical numbers and goofy animal/mythological sidekicks.  Not that a dramatic film can't have lighter elements or even musical numbers, but it has to be done well, and sadly the more dramatic stories and the classic Disney elements didn't always gel into a cohesive whole.

""Mulan"" is one of these more dramatic Disney films, and for the most part it succeeds -- its musical numbers fit the film well for the most part, and many of its comedic sidekicks bring humor to the story without feeling out of place.  But a few elements still feel like they don't belong.

Ancient China is under attack by the Huns, led by the sadistic warlord Shan Yu, and the Emperor decrees that every family must send one man to join the army and fight to save their kingdom.  The titular Mulan, a spirited and clever tomboy who struggles to fit into her honor-bound society, knows this decree can only mean tragedy -- the only man available in her family is her aged, lame father, a famed warrior whose glory days are long behind him.  Desperate to save her father, she disguises herself, steals her father's armor and horse, and joins the military in his place as a boy named Ping.  Accompanied by a wisecracking dragon guardian named Mushu (who aims to improve his standing among Mulan's ancestors by making her a war hero) and a plucky cricket, she sets out to prove her worth as a soldier... and finds herself in a position to save all of China from the invading Huns.  But can she save her homeland and protect her identity at the same time, or will her cover be blown with disastrous consequences?

The animation of this film is stunning, from the opening sequence (which mimics a traditional scroll painting before segueing to traditional animation) to the lush landscapes of ancient China.  Movements are smooth, and human characters are stylized without being warped out of recognition.  The animal designs tend to be a little simplistic, but given that the main focus of the film is humans, I'm willing to overlook this.  And there are a few segments that are obviously CGI (distance shots of the Hun army and the fireworks scenes in particular), but they weren't so jarring as to jolt me out of the movie.

I admit to not being familiar with the legend of Mulan until watching this film, but I loved the story, and this film led me to research it in greater detail.  Disney has, of course, taken some liberties with the original legend, but not to the extent that they do with a lot of their films -- the original story is still there and not butchered beyond recognition.  There's some thoroughly modern elements to this film, but not to the extent that it makes the film feel anachronistic, and it still has the look and feel of an antique legend instead of a ""Shrek""-ified take on the original story.

My main problem with the film?  Mushu the dragon.  While most of the comic-relief characters (most notably the Emperor's snotty advisor Chi-Fu and Mulan's fellow soldiers Ling, Yao, and Chien-Po) fit well into the story, Mushu... does not.  His inclusion feels pretty tacked on, and it's obvious that Disney was trying to duplicate the runaway success of ""Aladdin's"" Genie, but while the Genie managed to succeed at his goal, Mushu just feels annoying and ultimately unnecessary to the story.  The fact that he's voiced by Eddie Murphy doesn't help -- I find Murphy to be far more irritating than funny, and let's face it, when it comes to comedy and vocal versatility Murphy is no Robin Williams.  Mushu could have been nixed from the film without sacrificing much of anything.

Final tidbit -- there are quite a few famous voices hiding in this film aside from the aforementioned Eddie Murphy, including B.D. Wong, Donny Osmond, Pat Morita, George Takei, James Hong, Harvey Fierstein, and the ever-versatile Frank Welker.  Have fun finding all of them...

While not an instant classic like ""The Lion King,"" and while Mushu is an annoying inclusion, this is still a very enjoyable film, with great music, an epic story, and beautiful art and animation.  Probably best for ages 6 and up due to some scary scenes.  And I haven't seen the sequel and don't intend to -- from all accounts it's quite skippable...",1435104000,,5127,4.697206703910615

Mulan was the Disney Studio's 36th animated feature.  It was one of their better efforts.  Though at times the comic relief threatened to get out of hand and bury the more serious aspects of the story under a ton of laughs.  Nonetheless, this tale of supreme sacrifice in the face of death on the battlefield or death when discovered a woman, is incredibly moving.  Few people are willing to put the interest of others first.  It's one of the more positive messages set forth in a Disney film (must be a fluke).

Long before Frozen, this film gave us a well developed, strong female lead in a non-romantic setting.",1409097600,10,405,5.151515151515151

995055,4,6305229449,"Mulan came out towards the end of Disneys peak era of animated musicals, which began in 1989 with The Little Mermaid and ended in 1999 with Tarzan. The company released 9 major feature films of that genre in that period, and I rank Mulan is somewhere about 5th or 6th in that pack; thats no insult given how strong most of the films were. This is a quite entertaining, beautiful film, with very good musical numbers, which only lacks in a few story elements and a central heroine not quite as well-rounded as the likes of Ariel, Belle or Jasmine from past films.

Mulan, voiced by Ming-Na Wen, cant seem to act as a proper Chinese lady and find a husband. She decides to take her physically ailing fathers place when every family must give a man for war that has come upon them by the Huns. Dressing and acting like a man shes awkward in the training at first, but she eventually becomes one of the most impressive of all the soldiers, while the man leading her and the squad is one she admires and finds quite dashing as well. Along the way she gets some much needed help from a small but determined dragon voiced by Eddie Murphy.

The film has a nice combination of comedy and action, although they are within a story somewhat clunky at times. This is no doubt a gorgeous film, from ancient Chinese villages to snowy mountain peaks to the Forbidden City. The title character is certainly a strong willed female hero, and mostly it is not by chance but by the choices she makes which determines her fate. Unfortunately she just didn't engage me as a person like any number of other Disney leading ladies; as much as I admired her strength her character basically swung in two modes: awkward bumbling girl and super-brave hero woman. Its a good Disney heroine, but not a great one. The songs are nice, with a couple being fairly memorable.

On balance the good stuff in this film far outweighs the minor issues I had. Mulan, even if it isn't one of the best Disney animated musicals, is certainly one that should satisfy those of all ages looking for a rousing and inspirational tale. One last thought: What the heck were they thinking with that first song in the ending credits? It doesnt fit movie at all.",1406851200,,2207,4.498753117206983

995413,3,6305229449,"I've been a lifelong fan of Disney animated films but from 1995 on to 2012 I only saw a single Disney animation in the studio and unfortunately it was Mulan.  Mulan is generally considered a better than average Disney animation and it's certainly not the worst during the time period but I definitely left the theater disappointed. The story is pretty good and the animation is attractive and clean but overall it just is not a well done movie so let me list me reasons for not liking Mulan.

1. Mulan. Disney is not known for its subtlety and Mulan herself is a perfect example. She joins the Chinese army trying to pass herself off as a man to replace her ailing father. That's fine but not only is she successful in her subterfuge but she excels to the level of ridiculous. By the end of the movie she's doing stunts and acrobatics more akin to what you might see from Batman.

2. The cutesy sidekicks. Disney LOVES sassy sidekicks and Mulan gets not one, not two but THREE. There's a sassy horse, a sassy cricket and a sassy little dragon voiced by Eddie Murphy.  The movie is only 87 minutes long and all these scenes with Mushu the dragon and Cri-kee the cricket really eat into the actual story and most are not funny.

3. Mushu. The film is supposed to take place in ancient China so did they really need Eddie Murphy doing voice work sounding precisely like Eddie Murphy. Seriously?

4. Shan Yu. The main Hun villain is just ridiculous. It's one thing to make him tough but again, Disney seems to know no constraints. He can survive an avalanche, is able to cleave through 3 foot thick pillars and can smash his body through the main support beam of the Emperors temple. He's less like a tough Hun and more like General Zod.

5. Here is my biggest problem with the film by far. **SPOILER ALERT** Mulan manages to defeat the entire 2000 man Hun army single handedly. Let that sink in. SINGLE HANDEDLY as in with zero help. But when it is discovered that she is female, Captain Li Shang, who has throughout the movie been presented as an upstanding guy is literally ready to execute her but resists because besides taking out all the Hun's she also did an absurdly dramatic rescue to save his life. Instead she is simply banished. I don't doubt that ancient China was a very patriarchal society but this is absolutely absurd. She is only accepted in the end because she manages to save the Emperor. So because she was female she had to save China TWICE in order to gain approval. Ridiculous.

6. The entire ending of the movie is silly. ** MORE SPOILER ALERT ** Mulan manages to kill all the Huns besides Shan Yu and his top five lieutenants who manage to sneak into the Imperial City. As the Emperor is preparing to reward  Li Shang for beating the Huns Shan Yu and his men snatch up The Emperor and dash into his palace lacking the doors behind them. The palace is absolutely monstrous but appears to be entirely empty. In fact the Emperor apparently has zero guards anywhere so it's up to Mulan, Li Shang and their three goofy friends one of which is voice by Harvey Fierstein to mount a quick rescue. From there on the whole thing is just a silly mess including Shan Yu inexplicably going into Super Yu mode.

There is definitely stuff to like in this film and the few moments where Mulan is trying to hide her gender from her male comrades are done well. I love the skinny dipping scene. But Disney includes so much extraneous junk including scenes of Mulan's ghostly ancestors chatting and the stuff with Mushu and Cri-kee that the core story is just squeezed out.  The scenes of the Huns attacking are amazing right up until Mulan defeats them and then it just seems pointless. Mulan came between Hercules and Tarzan and although neither of those would make it into my Dinsey top ten they are a darn slight better than Mulan.",1382745600,,3839,4.48567335243553

(Wouldn't it be fun to see a sequel, with Mulan running matters in the imperial court?)

995585,5,6305229449,"In all the hub bub over Disney buying, and then integrating Pixar, we might forget that the gold standard for US animators was, and in some respect still is, Disney. And Mulan (and the more recent Wreck-it Ralph) is a reminder of how great they have been, at their best. The characteristics of great Disney animation? Starts with a superb story - just the right balance of being grounded in Chinese history, and also trying to speak to our more modern world, where women truly are trying to be treated as equals of men. Add to that exquisitely beautiful backgrounds and character work, which speaks to a long tradition of Chinese visual art, and then excellent voicing by everyone from Eddie Murphy to George Takei. And, here is the best test - if a film makes you cry, then it is really doing something, and this one does it for me a couple of times: first, when Mulan's father says ""the greatest honor is having you as a daughter"" and later, when Mulan brings honor home to the family.

996489,5,6305229449,"Growing up this was one of my favorite Disney movies.  In fact, there was a time that I watched it every day for two weeks straight.  Drove my parents crazy but I was happy.  I just liked how Mulan was empowered, and not as flighty as the other Disney women.

Mulan is the only child of her mother and father, and as a girl, it is up to her to make a good match and marry well to bring her family honor.  The problem is, Mulan just isn't cut out for that type of life.  She isn't graceful enough and just has more spirit than a proper girl should.  So after failing at the Matchmaker's, she decides to further deviate from the appropriate path when she steals her father's armor and army conscription and rushes away into the night to take his place.  But pretending to be a boy will be a lot harder than she thinks, and even worse, training is not progressing well and the Huns are in China.

Mulan is a strong female character.  Which is great when you consider that a lot of the Disney girls aren't that strong and are only holding out for their prince's approval.  So well done on this one Disney.  Even her love interest, Shang, doesn't know she's a girl, so there isn't that usual mix of romance that is found within these  movies.  Although Shang is a pretty neat guy himself, and seems dedicated to the work he is doing.  Her friends are pretty goofy and provide comic relief.  But then again Mushu does too in his dragon guardian role.  And all of the voice actors were spot on in this movie, I thought the voices fit well to the characters.

This movie is very colorful and I like that; I especially love the part with the Chinese paper dragon as I thought it was pretty and authentic.  It was standard animation, and honestly, with all the Pixar and CGI stuff Disney does now, I had begun to miss the plain cartoon feel of the older movies.  They just seem like classic Disney.  Picking the story of Mulan to use, was as I said before,  a brilliant stroke by Disney to get a strong character out there.  It was a neat story and watching Mulan grow during it was fun too.  I can say that as an adult the story felt a little rushed, but not nearly so much as some of the other Disney movies.

The music was fantastic in this movie.  I can honestly say I know all the words to all the songs and was singing along to it.  There's just something catchy about them, especially the ""I'll make a man out of you"" song.  Nothing like that to get the blood pumping  (maybe even better than the Rocky theme), or maybe I'm the only one who feels that way.  Regardless, the composers did a good job on this one.  In fact, the only song I don't like is the one where they are marching into battle; I can't even remember the name of it because I choose to ignore it.

Great movie, one of my favorites of the Disney line up.  Fantastic characters, fabulous music, and a good story.  Well worth watching by the entire family.

996490,1,6305229449,I got this as a gift and when given it was not in English and had no way if changing it to English. I am very upset but this and the person this gift was for was so heartbroken! Contacted the seller waiting to see what will get done about this but wanted to let anyone looking to buy this to make sure you get English if that's what you want don't just trust what is on the site.,1350000000,,379,3.810126582278481
996491,5,6305229449,Great movie. Has some mature themes that newer movies tend to skip. There is a good reason in the movie that I feel is important for my daughters to learn.,1349740800,,155,4.2
996492,3,6305229449,"I purchased this wanting to add it to my DVD collection, but I didn't realize what I was getting.  I didn't know what it meant when you purchase a DVD created for a region outside of your own country origin.  I live in the United States, which I have now learned is Region 1.  I no longer own an actual DVD player, so I use my computer to play DVDs.  Windows Media Player gives you the option to change your region 4 times, so I changed it in order to watch the DVD, and changed it back so I could continue to watch the rest of my DVDs.  I was a little unhappy when I realized that I can't really watch Mulan again without risking getting kicked out of region 1 so I could no longer view the rest of my DVDs.  Perhaps this is my own fault for not researching what I was getting before I purchased it, but now I know not to purchase DVDs for anything other than region 1.  In addition, it took several weeks for the DVD to ship to me here in the US which was a little annoying.  I think it came from China, but that amount of waiting for something as small as a DVD was a little ridiculous.  Lesson learned.",1349654400,2,1106,4.013698630136986

996498,4,6305229449,"I LOVE that this portrays a strong female character and also another belief system (as did Pocahontas), but do not like the dressing up and behaving a certain way to  ""be marriageable."" The only saving grace for that aspect is that the great warrior seeks Mulan out (as marriageable), knowing she is nothing like those ""traditional"" women the match-maker is readying for marriage. I also think the character of the little dragon who earns his way back into an honored place amongst the honored ancestors is a great character and a good lesson about quick thinking, perseverance, and determination. I like this movie and I'm glad my 4 year old granddaughter loves it, even if she's moved on to Peter Pan after watching this one more times than I can count. There are not enough videos for children with strong female characters.",1348272000,,827,4.823943661971831

The purchase arrived within few days,despite the oversea shipping.  To my surprise, the DVD has the option of speaking in English or Mandarin.  It also played on the portable Panasonic DVD player, I purchased at Best Buy.  Most importantly, my daughter loves this movie and hearing it in Mandarin.

Though there was a lot of implied violence, but my 4-year old didn't know what was happening.  Disney did its usual good job of implying any violence in a way that younger kids who don't already understand death and killing already, aren't left with questions due to the movie.

996760,5,6305229449,"I got the 2 disk set from the library and was as happy with the film as when I saw it in theaters. I'm glad I did not pay retail for the special edition, though! It has interesting facts, some creative insights, pre production art stills, and due credit given to the tiawanese crew member who contributed priceless cultural experience.

I am not saying the second disk is bad, but it's not worth double the cost of the movie disk alone. I would have liked more depth about China, it's landscapes, buildings, and morals/values ... these were very briefly addressed, probably because the target audience is kids.

I plan to buy the film for my collection. It's an overcomer theme that has a happy ending, like classic bedtime stories do. Not a fan of ""sophisticated"" plots and ""grey"" morality like newer stories present. I want clear cut good and evil, honorable heroes, wise leaders, and realistic emotions. Mulan has all of this. I recommend it for kids, and parents - homeschoolers in particular will find a lot to talk about afterwards.

Unlike many films, it isn't stereotyped at all. It is not ""feminist"", ""patriarchal"", or any other ""ism"". Yay!

Mulan makes hard choices and follows through them, despite personal risk. Such strength of character and love for others - social responsibility towards your family/troop/country - has largely disppeared from American culture. So sad! I hope quality media like this will inspire future leaders to have honor and courage as adults, to stand for their convictions, if not stand up to Huns.

The negative was Mushu, the little dragon. I found him annoying more than funny, especially when he causes Mulan awkward, embarrassing situations - with no apology. Repeatedly. I don't enjoy watching others put in painful situations. He detracts from the cultural context - I think Khan should have trampled him some more! Good horse.

Artistically, look at the character creation bonus feature and the stills. Rewatch the film. You will get a different perspective and sense of the Chinese quality to the art. For example, the horse Khan, is very angular with large body and very thin legs, emphasizing strength and grace.",1336867200,,2163,4.9449035812672175
996761,4,6305229449,"This one is better than I expected. Since Disney is traditionally very big on old-fashioned girly girls, I was not at all certain how this story of a girl who dresses up in armor and passes herself off as a boy in order to join the Chinese army and fight the invading Huns would work out. Turns out it's really pretty good. The premise is that she donned her father's armor to save him from conscription since he was wounded in the service of the Emperor years before. It was clear he was unfit for duty, but the conscription officers demanded one man from every family, and Mulan had no brothers.

She has two magical allies: a dragon (Eddie Murphy at his best) who was sent by her ancestors to protect and aid her, and a cricket given to her by her grandmother for good luck. Grandmother didn't know about the idea of going to war, of course; she had brought the cricket for good luck when Mulan was presented to the matchmaker. That didn't go well at all. But the cricket turns out to be pretty darn lucky anyway.

My favorite part of the movie is the training camp, where the captain who is ruggedly handsome and the General's son is set the nearly impossible task of training the sorriest bunch of recruits you've ever seen. Mulan (called Ping as a boy) ends up being one of the best recruits, with courage, agility and cleverness more than making up for lack of bulk. Still, the company is really not ready when they are tricked into believing the general has called them to the front.

No, I won't give any more away, except to say that there is a good bit of humor, lots of creativity and surprises, and the predictable part that Mulan becomes a hero and wins the romantic attention of the handsome captain.

The dragon is a little guy, but arguably the best character in the whole movie.",1336608000,,1796,4.4169184290030215

I changed the region on my laptop (macbook pro, and note you can only change the region 4 times before it locks) and it played perfectly.

A bonus for my wife is that Mulan, living and competing in a man's world, manages to become a real female hero.  She doesn't feel like a man in a woman's body, but like her own person.

996965,5,6305229449,"I haven't seen a Disney animated feature since Lion King, but I saw Mulan recently with my wife and have to say I enjoyed it. As somebody who studies Asia, I think it's about time Disney ventured into Asia (with the exception of Jungle Book, I believe this is the first animated feature based on an Asian story). The story, in short, follows a Chinese woman who joins the army and helps stop a Hun invasion. Disney of course overplays the traditional Asian values theme (honor the ancestors, etc), but fortunately it never takes this to the point of being insulting towards Asian cultures. The story has a good balance between character and childish humor - at least for the first hour - so both adults and kids can enjoy it. I was disappointed with the second half, after the Chinese troops discover that Mulan is a woman. Rather than take that revelation and get some really interesting character development, the last half our of the film is a predictable fare of Mulan and her compatriots stopping the Huns with some wacky antics. Despite this lackluster ending, overall it's not bad.",1314489600,,1088,4.701570680628272

997053,4,6305229449,"Although highly formulaic, `Mulan' is one of the better Disney films of more recent years.

Like `Pocahontas' this film has a female protagonist and she is as independent and free spirited. When the Huns invade China Mulan's father is called to fight, but due to his ill health Mulan sneaks away, disguises herself as a boy and learns to fight in his place. She is assisted along the way by one of her family guardians, a tiny red dragon (voiced by Eddie Murphy, before he became better known as the voice of Donkey in `Shrek').

This film has some nice touches and is animated very well. The voice cast is very good and the music isn't too saccharine or cheesy either. You always know with a Disney film how the story will go, I.e. independent main character wants to find their own way in life, but family loyalty and immaturity holds them back, they go away and learn a lesson fighting an evil character of some description (usually assisted by a cute side-kick), find love and learn lessons and then they come home to a big happy ending family reunion. There may be slight deviations from this from film to film, but this is generally how they tend to go and it is a formula that works.

All in all I enjoyed this film, maybe more so than the previously mentioned `Pocahontas', and whilst it was relatively short, it was entertaining for the duration.",1299888000,,1355,4.545081967213115

The VHS version my girlfriend owns is better quality than this, and that's pretty pathetic in this day and age.

Mulan may not be a princess, but she's definitely ranked up there with the Disney princesses we grew up to admire, perhaps even better than them. She is brave, smart, beautiful, and selfless.

997059,5,6305229449,"Mulan is one hour and thirty minutes and was released in theaters on June 19, 1998. The movie tells the story of Fa Mulan who is the young daughter of the great warrior Fa Zhou. Mulan thinks of herself as a disappointment to her family, but her father does not let on and cares a great deal for her. In the opening scene the Huns have just stormed the Great Wall of China and the Emperor of China has conscription notices sent out to each household informing them that one male from each household must join the army. Fa Zhou, who is in poor health, accepts the conscription on behalf of his household. Mulan knows that her father is unfit to join the army steal his sword and suit of armor and takes the family horse and rides away in the night to join the army. When the family finds out about this Grandmother Fa asks the Ancestors to watch after her. This wakes up the First Ancestor Fa who awakens Mushu to summon the rest of the Ancestors. First Ancestor Fa sends Musho to awaken the Great Stone Dragon, but in doing so Mushu accidently destroys the Great Stone Dragon. Mushu pretends that he is the Great Stone Dragon and sets out, along with Cri-kee, to help Mulan. Mulan disguise herself and a man (calling herself Ping) and tries her best to fit in but does not. It is not until she has proven herself that the camp finally accepts her.

Mushu gives Chi-Fu phony orders to send the men on their first assignment. The men break camp and head up to meet General Li's army, but they arrive too late. The village is destroyed and all of the soldiers are killed. Captain Li Shang, General Li son, and his men all are that remain left to prevent the Hun invasion. It is Mushu that accidently sets off one of the rockets and alerts the Hun army. At battle breaks out and Ping uses the last rocket to start an avalanche that wipe outs nearly all of the Hun army. Ping is wounded in the battle and when the doctor mends her wounds it is revealed that Ping is a woman. Since Ping\Mulan saved Captain Li Shang life, Captain Li Shang spears her life and kicks her out of the army. Later that evening Mulan discovers not all the Huns were killed and several of the survived including the leader of the Huns Shan Yu.

Back at the Imperial City Captain Li Shang and his men are welcome as heroes of China. Mulan tries to warn Captain Li Shang that Shan Yu and some of his men are still alive and are heading towards the Imperial City, but Captain Li Shang will not listen. Mulan, Mushu, and Cri-kee take matters into their own hands once the Emperor of China has been taken hostage. Mulan, Yao, Ling, Chien-Po, and Shang manage to sneak in the palace, distract and take out the guards, and rescue the Emperor of China. Shang and Mulan battle Shan Yu and Shan Yu meets his death when he is carry off by a rocket and into a munitions tower where there are other rockets. Mulan is a hero to all of China and heads home to her father. Mulan won several Annie Awards and grossed $304 million worldwide. The special effects in Mulan are great and Mulan gets an AAA+++.

And this is saying something, because my ancestors were Huns.  :)

Mulan is a lovely character, the voice actors (Donny Osmond singing, Eddie Murphy speaking) do some of their best work ever. While I couldn't call it faithful to Asian traditions, they do try to observe some, such as the family name coming first in an introduction, ""I'm looking for Fa Mulan.""

This is my favorite Disney movie.",1267056000,,408,4.704225352112676
997163,5,6305229449,"My first exposure to this tale of Ancient China's girl warrior was from viewing a doll of the character featured on the Home Shopping Network sometime in the early 90s.
 Little did I realize how much publicity there would soon be in the Western World for China's legendary forerunner to France's Jeanne D'Arc within just a few years!
 The Disney animators have done a fine job of capturing  the  Chinese flavor of the story, and basing the layout on Ancient Chinese watercolor pictures. One feels the figures stepped  right off those delicate and antiquated sheets of paper, and in essence, became timeless.
  Our story begins with the grim scenario of the Mongolian leader Shan Yu (Miguel Ferrer)  and his troops  crossing over the newly constructed Great Wall of China to invade the country. The Emperor( Pat Morita) orders that conscriptions be formed by all Chinese men capable of serving.
 Elsewhere, in a lovely province, the farm girl who will make a difference is preparing for a meeting with the village matchmaker(Miriam Margoyles). We first meet young Fa Mulan( voiced by Ming Na and sung by Lea Salonga) as she employs the service of her dog, ""Little Brother"" ( Chris Sanders) in helping her feed the chickens in an innovative way that goes awry, resulting in her father Fa Zhou's (Soon Tek Oh) praying even harder for the success of his awkward daughter on that day. Her mother Fa Li(Freda Foh Shen), and Grandmother Fa(voiced by June Foray, and sung by Marni Nixon) help prepare her by helping to dress and presenting her with good luck charms, including the little cricket, Cri-Kee(Frank Welker), whose name, I somehow have reason to believe, isn't as Chinese as it sounds...
  Long story short, the visit with the matchmaker doesn't go well, and Mulan is in a funk about yet another failure despite her father's attempt to console her.
  Soon messengers reach the village calling for them men to join the army. When Fa sees that her father, who has served before is physically unable to re-enlist, she ignores the fact that women caught serving in the army will be executed, stops listening to the voices that tell her she is forgetting her place as a woman, and does what her heart tells her is right, cutting her hair, taking her father's armour, and riding off one rainy night to serve in his place.
  Pausing for a moment to find inspiration, and hoping for a guardian, Mulan will soon get her wish in the form of the little dragon Mushu( voiced by Eddie Murphy, without the ""gai pan""), who despite the objections of the First Ancestor ( George Takei), and the other ancestors due to a past failure, takes it upon himself to see Mulan through the battle, along with little  Cri-Kee  and Mulan's horse, Khan( also voiced by Frank Welker).
 What I found amusing about the ancestral tete-a-tete was that, having lived in Hawaii, with its large Chinese population they reminded me of people I knew when I was young.
  Mulan soon arrives at the Army camp where she encounters the other recruits, including the feisty one-eyed Yao ( Harvey Firestein), the joker, Ling (Gedde Wantanabe), and the  gentle giant, Chein-Po (Jerry Tondo).She also deals with the officious official Chi Fu (James Hong), but is impressed by the strong young commanding officer Shang(voiced by B.D Wong and sung by Donny Osmond), whose father General Li (James Shigeta) is facing combat elsewhere.
 While failing to make a good first impression, Mulan eventually inspires the men when she succeeds at the first test Shang gave the recruits.
 Soon, we follow the troops on marches through the beautiful countryside, and see the evil Shan-Yu and his forces drawing closer.
 Mushu and Cri-Kee either cover for Mulan, to prevent her from being exposed, or take matters into their own hands in altering the course of events.
 The climax of this story is a dramatic confrontation with the Mongols in the snowy mountains, where Mulan discovers a way to cut the strength from behind Shan-Yu when the power of his forces seems overwhelming.
 Wounded in battle after saving Shang's life, Mulan is soon discovered to be female. While Shang spares her as an act of reciprocity, he orders the troops to move out and he will have no more to do with her.
  But Mulan's work isn't finished yet: Having seen the Huns pop out of the snow, she hurries to warn the men, who soon realize they must follow her lead in order to defeat Shan-Yu. The finale is spectacular, and she who saves China pretty much saves the world--or at least most of it.
 What makes this a great story for children is that they see the imperfections of Mulan, Mushu, and Cri-Kee, but they can learn about perseverance in spite of past failures because these characters believe in themselves and their ability to do good.--A highly recommendable tale told with Oriental grace!",1264118400,,4818,4.797820823244552

997165,3,6305229449,"Disney could have done a great job with this adaptation of a Chinese folk tale. But unfortunately, they just had to ruin it with some comedy. Now, I'm not saying that this automatically makes the film a complete failure. The animation is top-notch, with some beautiful scenery and a powerful action sequence. The drama really adds to the tension in some scenes. The music from Jerry Goldsmith is also a treat. But what really makes this a mediocre Disney film is the unnecessary comedy. Disney could have made this one of its more outstanding animated films, if it weren't for all that humor. Instead of it being a serious epic like Princess Mononoke, Mulan is more of an uneven display of drama and slapstick. All of this funny stuff is very out of place for such a powerful folk tale. Couldn't they have taken Mushu more seriously? Plus, the songs are very forgettable. ""A Girl Worth Fighting For"" and ""I'll Make a Man Out of You"" aren't in the same level as ""Be Our Guest"" and ""I Just Can't Wait to be King."" There are no memorable melodies and no decent lyrics, though ""Reflection"" is a slightly up there.

So Mulan is basically a mixed bag. The stunning animation and the apparent drama are what's good about it. The unnecessary comedy and underwhelming songs are what's bad about it. It's too bad, really. This project had some big potential, but they just had to turn it into an adequate animated film.

Yet, she displays courage and stamina beyond any other Disney heroine. When it all comes down to it, (with the possible exception of Pocahontas), all the Disney gals need to be ""rescued"" by a prince or other supporting characters. She doesn't. SHE'S the hero at the end, combining both masculine strategy with feminine guile. The romance isn't quite so blatant and she can get along perfectly without a prince at the end. He comes to HER.

On another note, the grandmother was better comic relief than Mushu.

The animation is spectacular: the battle with the Huns, the Imperial palace and the mountain scenes are particularly breath-taking.

However, as a student of medieval history, I would have liked the Huns or Hsiung-nu as the Chinese called them, to be shown as shorter and that their saddles had stirrups--they were the first people to make widespread use of them.

Mushu is the only likable 'animal' character from Disney since Sebastian the crab from ""The Little Mermaid"".  What's best about this movie?  No dashing Princes swooping into the save the day!

997209,5,6305229449,"Except, they do still sing--as sort of narration for their emotions. The songs are highly unmemorable (as I sit here writing this, I can only remember the line, ""I'll make a man out of you,"" which is from the very worst song ever including in a Disney film.  By the way, will Disney ever have a ""training session"" that will last more than a couple minutes and that isn't put to a song? They did that to this movie, Hercules, Tarzan (who also grew into an adult instantaneously), and Beauty and the Beast (in that Belle changes her mind about the Beast during a song).  One more really bad thing about Mulan--Mushu is a total hinderance. I'm not just talking about his pop-culture mouth (which someone should have popped), but that he in fact causes more problems than he solves. Would it really be so much to ask if Mulan could have made the mistake that ""gave away our position,"" instead of having Mushu shoot off a rocket? At least that way, she's redeeming her own mistake, instead of someone elses, which gives no emotional payoff. Better yet, why not have the falcon find the line of troops--after all, that's what the falcon is for, right? It scouted earlier for the general's encampment and brought back the doll, remember?  Oh, and the cross-dressing thing at the end was a little too weird--a bit too Fushigi Yugi and not really very intelligent--do you honestly think that anybody would fall for that trick, even if they were really women (especially considering what the Monguls would have done).  The best parts of the movie were the references to Japanese cartoons (anime). When Mushu fries the feathers off of the falcon, it looks like a Chocobo from the Final Fantasy series, but is just as likely a reference to the horseclaws from Nausicaa of the Valley of Wind (the director, apparently, is a devotee of Miyazaki). Another Nausicaa reference--the doll, which is similar to the one that Lord Yupa finds at the beginning of the Nausicaa movie (it crumbles, and Yupa says, ""Another village has died.""). Also, Mulan's hair is given incredible attention, which is not usually the case in Disney films (usually they're just pretty and blow in the wind). Just watch her hair when she bows in shame after they find out she's a she!  Beyond that, there is a good deal of emotional content, though once the possibility of execution is lifted (a life for a life), it is never mentioned again--even though the overseer, who really hated her, could have had her executed at a moments notice once she caught back up with them. And I'm sorry, but for all their knowledge and art, the Chinese were rather steadfast about their ways and about honor--they would not suddenly become so accepting of women, especially since they are still rather unaccepting of women.",1222473600,,2765,4.728215767634855

I love the artistry of the film and how all the backgrounds and nature look like Asian watercolor artwork.

Donny Osmond also has a great song and many of the characters are voiced by popular Asian actors.  This is a very fine film and very underrated in the Disney array of animated features.

997304,3,6305229449,"Being Chinese, I really wanted to love this movie, but it lacks a few key story elements that set ""Masterpiece"" animated features such as 'Beauty and the Beast' and 'Aladdin' apart from the rest. The animation and sound are fine as they should be and the mountain pass scenes are really cool, especially the part where the huge Mongol hoard comes charging down towards the protagonists in an endless wave of cavalry. The main musical theme ""Reflections"" is also well written and expresses Mulan's feelings and desires with emotion.

My issues with the movie:

1) The bad guy is certainly bad. He looks bad and he acts bad. However, there isn't really any clear logic or motivation to why he is doing what he's doing. In Beauty and the Beast, Gaston is driven by his egomaniacal desire to have Belle, the one woman in the village who shows no interest in him at all. In Mulan, the bad guy rapes and pillages China because... well... just because. There doesn't appear to be any goal or motivation for him. He destroys simply because he can, which is certainly possible, but makes for a rather flat character. Gaston, Jafar, and Ursula are much more interesting villains.

2) Mulan's romantic partner is kind of a ""himbo"". He's a pretty boy who doesn't really do much and isn't all that bright. It's not clear to me why Mulan would really want to get together with him other than the fact that he's a good looking dude. Besides that, he doesn't add much to the story. Which leads to my next issue:

3) In the other great Disney features, the lead and their romantic interest share in the resolution of their conflicts and defeat the villian as part of the resolution of the conflict in their romance. In Aladdin, Jasmine and Aladdin battle Jafar together as part of the resolution of the problem where Aladdin lied about being a poor street kid because Jasmine is the Sultan's daughter. Ariel and Eric battle Ursula as part of the romantic conflict brought on by the fact that he is human and she is a mermaid. Eric sees that Ariel is a mermaid in the end and doesn't care. He still risks his life fighting Ursula together with Ariel. In Mulan, it's pretty much just her and the romantic part of the story is an afterthought and they never really get into the issue of resolving that she is ""doing a man's job"" and shouldn't be in the Chinese army as part of their romantic conflict. It just gets OK'd in the end because she saves the emperor. They don't resolve it between themselves as individuals. Actually, up until the end he still does not accept her until the emperor accepts her. Not very romantic.

4) Finally, the supporting characters don't add much to the story either. The dragon and cricket add a little comedy here and there, but not much else. Some of the soldiers in Mulan's unit had potential, but don't really fully get there.

So, overall I liked the movie, but I didn't love it. This could have been one of their classics if they spent a bit more time developing the story and characters. It looks great, but needed some more under the hood of the story.",1174176000,16,3073,4.547920433996383
997305,5,6305229449,"Released after Pocahontas, when the Disney animated renaissance was coming to a close, this movie did not get much attention; this is unfortunate.  While some of the comic relief is pained, Mulan herself is so lovingly rendered that she compensates for the groans.

Mulan, the character, is animated by Mark Henn, one of the main animators behind the beautiful and timeless Disney heroines of the 90s.  Like Jasmine, Mulan's movements are feminine, lively, and nuanced, and show how much love he put into his work.  Her facial expressions are subtle but clear, showing both her intelligence and her girlish immaturity.  It is obvious why he was assigned to the animation of women over and over again; he is a master and considering how popular his Princesses are, I don't understand why he gets less love than Glen Keane.

Equal to Henn's animation is Ming-Na's voice acting.  Her voice acting in Final Fantasy is too good; it only shows off the mediocrity of that animation.  Here, though, she brings sympathy and depth to the character.  Mulan to me is the perfect heroine.  Her goal was not true love, she would take it, yes, but her heart seeks respect and honor first.

The plot is almost cloying but stops short at tender.  Songs like A Girl Worth Fighting For are forgettable at best, but both Reflection and I'll Make a Man Out of You, the song where Mulan climbs the pole and proves herself, are classics.  While sometimes irritating, Eddie Murphy's Mushu gets a few belly laughs.  Still, it is the character of Mulan that makes this movie a favorite.",1171929600,2,1560,4.772388059701493

997364,5,6305229449,"Disney got it right with their re-telling of the Mulan legend. It's a far better historical drama than Pocahontas, less dependant on fluff than Hercules, no sugary songs to clear the gloom like in Hunchback, and more of an original concept than the recycled Tarzan. And for what it's worth from a Chinese person's perspective, the stereotypes aren't too bad. Sidekicks are a little cheesy, but the main characters are handled well.

All this makes for a rocking good time with Mulan. You get a truly independent and proactive female lead, and a genie-like character in Eddie Murphy's Mushu. There's actually a nice sense of danger and tension in the mountain scenes, with some excellent computer work to show a huge invading army. The villain's less memorable here, but he's pure evil without remorse, and there are tastefully handled offscreen deaths to show he isn't kidding around (hey, it's a war story). Fun songs keep the movie light where appropriate, and the whole project has a -slightly- more mature edge while remaining strictly Disney and family-friendly.

Great collection of extras in this set, including some deleted material, the original Christina Aguilera music video, and behind-the-scenes stuff. Also of interest is a Jackie Chan music video from the overseas promotions. The guy's English may not be so great, but he sings all the ending themes to his own movies in Hong Kong, and has a good voice when he's in his element.

Definitely one of my top five favourite Disney films, and a solid buy for any family or animation lover's library.",1152057600,,1560,4.969348659003831

997415,5,6305229449,"Though Walt Disney Pictures has made many animated features, the vast majority are based on stories common in western cultures.  ""Mulan"" breaks new ground as an animated feature from a Chinese fable.  Mulan is a young girl who has taken her father's place in the military to fight invaders.  As with many countries, women were expected to remain at home and allow men to handle the fighting.  As this movie makes very clear, death was an expected punishment for a female impersonating a male warrior.  However, Mulan overcomes stereotypes and helps defend her country, and charms us along the way.

This movie has an incredible cast.  Miguel Ferrer voices Shan-Yu, the leader of the invading Huns.  Miguel adds a sinister edge to his deep voice that enhances our dislike for the ruthless character of Shan-Yu.  Beautiful Ming-Na provides the voice of Mulan.  Ming-Na won an Annie Award for her voice portrayal of Mulan.  Eddie Murphy is perfect and funny as the dragon Mushu whose heart is bigger than his body or his brains.  The late Pat Morita is excellent as the voice of the Emperor of China.  Numerous other voice talents bring this movie to life.  Korean actor Oh Soon Tek voice Fa Zhou.  Veteran actor Miriam Margolyes voices the Matchmaker.  Matthew Laborteaux, Gedde Watanabe, James Hong, and numerous other stars make their appearances in this film.

As with many Disney films, this movie includes several excellent songs.  Singing those songs are well known artists Christina Aguilera, Stevie Wonder, 98 Degrees, Donny Osmond and Lea Salonga.

This movie captured more than the hearts and minds of viewers.  This movie also captured 14 awards and 13 award nominations, including a nomination for an Oscar.  This movie also has one of the highest box office totals of all time, ranking in the top 200 as of the date of this review.

Walt Disney Pictures has had some mis-steps in movie productions as it seeks to regain the prominence in family films that it once had.  This movie placed Disney Pictures back in the spotlight as one of the premiere studios for making family films.  I believe that most families will enjoy this tale based on a Chinese fable.  Along the way perhaps members of the family will learn something about heroism and selflessness, and that girls and women have far greater capability than many, including themselves, give them credit.  This DVD is a necessity for any family's home film library.  Enjoy!",1143244800,2,2440,4.902200488997555
997416,5,6305229449,"Mulan in many ways is probably one of the better ones that Disney made before making some really subpar fluff. Pocahontas was disappointing and Hercules was a bit too light-hearted to be taken seriously. Even with comic relief, Mulan wants to be taken seriously too and that's why it works. Not a classic really but still well made.

Film's set in China with Mulan trying to impress the matchmaker to find a husband. Only things don't go so well, and things get worse when Mulan's ailing father is called into war with the Huns. Not wanting to risk her father's life, Mulan takes his armor and sword and rides off. Her family guardians don't want her to leave so they summon a dragon, only they get Mushu instead, a very tiny lizard-like wisecracker. Along for the ride is Cri-Kee, a lucky bug, to help save the Emperor.

Disney was heavily starting to use CG more often and combining traditional animation and it's still impressive to see. Each Disney release usually has that one big action scene or animation showcase: the dance in Beauty and the Beast, stampede in Lion King and the Hydra fight in Hercules. Here we get an avalanche and it still looks cool. My only problem is there's not really enough wide shots, we're very close to it and would've been nice to see all of it.

Eddie Murphy in many ways is like a more tolerable Robin Williams. They're both very manic and hyperactive comedic wise but Eddie's not as energetic, which is why Mushu works, he knows how to dial it down. The rest of the cast is quite good, including Ming-Wa, known from the Joy Luck Club and ER. The other cast you probably wouldn't recognize since it's not huge like James Woods or Mel Gibson, which works just fine.

One thing that doesn't work with the film is the songs. There's nary a Circle of Life or Never Had a Friend Like Me in the entire thing. They're not really all that memorable and there's a certain predictableness to the structure of them. At least Hakuna Matata was different to Be Prepared just as Be Our Guest was different to Gaston. Here, you're almost unsure whether it's even different songs and you'd have to think ""well it does sound a bit different"".

Mulan probably won't enter the Disney classic catalogue like Lion King or Bambi but it's still one of their better made ones.",1140739200,,2291,4.564476885644769
997417,5,6305229449,"This is one of my all time favorite movies.  Initially that was so because of the empowering message it has for females, but it is also a very watchable movie.  It's entertaining and very well done.  You can really tell that the people making it put thought and effort into it, and weren't just trying to dash off a quick buck.  There's a minimum of painful, dragged-out scenes, and in general the storytelling is skillfull and economical.  The musical scenes are all fabulous, and there's something really special about Mulan's 'reflection' song.

The dvd itself is something I have no complaints about, though I haven't compared it to other editions.  There are some very interesting ""the making of"" extras, as well as an ultra-cool version of the ""I'll Make a Man Out of You"" song, which switches from language to language as the song progresses, yet still sounds smooth.

This movie has a really special place in my heart, despite not being the best of all Disney movies.  There's just a sparkling quality to it, and I don't only mean aesthetically, though it is pretty, too!",1138924800,2,1079,4.758064516129032

997419,3,6305229449,"Note that the three stars is for the DVD, not the film. While it's not quite The Little Mermaid or Beauty and the Beast, I'd still give Mulan five stars just for the powerfully dramatic story and the message that, if I had little girls, I'd definitely want them to get from this movie.

However, ""Special Edition"" is not my preferred term for this DVD. Mulan's ""Special Edition"" got basically the same treatment that The Lion King's ""Platinum Edition"" got - crap. Sorry, but a bunch of featurettes do not equal a real, cohesive ""making-of"" documentary. And the lack of theatrical trailers, at one time the sole bonus feature of a DVD, is inexcusable. DVDs with little or NO bonuses often at least include a trailer. I wouldn't have even spent money, but the transfer is top notch, in anamorphic widescreen, and that was worth the $10 I was able to get it for at Wal Mart. (I'm pretty sure it's not that cheap anymore, it was a limited-time only sale.)

I didn't quite expect Platinum Edition treatment, so it didn't disappoint me like when I found out the specs for The Lion King, as it WAS a Platinum Edition and should have been handled better. But even the current 2-disc Pocahontas 10th Anniversary Edition and the now OOP Sleeping Beauty 2-Disc Special Edition managed to recycle an old making-of documentary to go with the other little featurettes on various things AND managed to include 2-3 theatrical trailers.

If you only care about the movie and not the bonuses, definitely buy this. It's the only version of the movie in print, and rightfully so as the picture and sound are top notch. However, if you also like DVDs with great bonuses, I can't fully recommend this DVD. Unfortunately, I have to give this product 3 stars. It would be two stars except the movie is just so good and given to us in such a wonderful presentation that it earns this DVD another star.",1127088000,7,1876,4.610778443113772

Having seen this many times and enjoy it more as time goes by...if i was on a stranded island and can only have 3 DVD movies with me, this would be one of them.

Maybe what I like so much is that Mulan is not waiting for her prince to come or any damsel in distress deal, but she is an intelligent woman held down by her society. The story: Mulan's father is old but he is called to war. He will probably die. Mulan decides to take his place. This is remarkably unselfish because if she's discovered she will be killed. This shows how much she loves her dear old dad. You just have to see the movie to appreciate it. The songs are amazing (""I'll make a man out of you"" Donny Osmond's voice is fantastic). The extra features were also pretty good. I found ""I'll make a man out of you"" in all different languages very interesting. The animation is great as it shows a lot of the natural beauty of China. So make sure you don't miss one of Disney's greatest(and probably last judging by the way Disney is going down the drain) animated movies.",1121126400,,935,4.318181818181818
997491,4,6305229449,"This movie is probably the last really good animated feature ever made- although not holding up to the classics such as Beauty & The Beast, Aladdin, The Lion King or the Pixar collaberations. But, this movie holds up the classic Disney tradition of good storytelling, animation, and moving music.

Probably one of the last classicly animated movies. Mulan takes place in China just after the Huns invaded. With the Huns invasion the emperor of China asks one man for each family to serve in the army. Mulan a troubled girl who is trying to find her place in the world while, dealing with the fact that she dosn't fit in. Mulan continually humilates her family who she loves greatly. She feels as though she is a dissappointment-unable to find a husband. Well, when her father is asked to serve in the army Mulan can't stand the thought that she might lose him. She decides to disguise herself as a man and serve for him. When Mulan is discovered missing her dead family ancestors ask the help of Mushu-a wise cracking dragon to guard her. Mulan quickly finds herself having trouble in the army and in constant conflict with the guys. But, eventually becomes acceptted especially by Chang the head of the army. When, Mulan is injured her secret is revealed. Chang spares her life... but, when Mulan sees the Huns heading in the same direction of the army- it's up to her to warn the guys and save China from diaster. Only problem will anyone believe her now???

With such memorable songs as ""Reflection"", ""I'll Make A Man Out Of You"", and ""True To Your Heart."" You'll find yourself singing along with the songs. I love the song ""I'll Make A Man Out Of You""- Donny Osmond has the most amazing voice. Les Miserables fans will be pleased that Lea Solgna sings the film version of ""Reflection."" I LOVE the bonus features such as the music videos especially the one with Jackie Chan(He was the Chinese voice for Chang) singing in Chinese ""I'll Make A Man Out Of You."" The quality on the DVD is better than the version I saw in theaters.

I love this film and continually watch it over and over again. I especially like Chang in this film. I'll give it 4 stars-it's great but, it's not gonna be a classic such as Beauty & the Beast or the Lion KIng- I think the girls will like this film but, the little guys might not be into this as much.

997492,5,6305229449,"Maybe one of the most mature and serious features Disney has developed. It's about battles against the will and the courage of a young woman who won't give up. It's Mulan, a movie that combining very elements -humor, love and hate-, creates an intelligent story that no one should miss.

Based on a Chinese legend, Mulan is the tale of a young girl that doesn't fit in the rigid structures imposed for her traditional culture, as to how it should be the women's' rol in society An independent spirit sentenced to ""never bring honor to her family"" for adopting her own way of thinking and acting.

In the time of Chinese feudalism, the Emperor, who has to confront an attack of Huns, commanded for the evil Shan Yu, orders to recruit a man for every family to take a place n the future war. Mulan's father, the only man in her family and very tied to traditions, accepts his duty without a doubt.

And like her father, without too much thinking, Mulan decides to takes his place, turning herself into a man. She cuts her hair, steals her dad's war weapons and gets enlisted in the military calling herself ""Ping"". On the road she meets 2 cartoonish-y friends, a funny dragon called Mushu and a cricket called, Crikee (convenient). Both give the usual touch of comedy in this kind of movie.

In military life, Mulan shows a defying and rigorous training, under the critic eye of her boss, Captain Shang. And she proves both intelligence and courage in the battlefield. Her search to defend her family name and to get approval of her way of thinking is told with great style.

The animation is very nice, from scenes as impressive as the battle in the snow to the parade before the Imperial palace. Unusual camera angles are implemented, colors and textures are used with great delicacy, enriching the cinematography; the score is light and fresh.

In Mulan, once again Disney tries to explore emotions and feelings like family love, duty, courage, honor, obedience, boldness, willpower and team work. All of them very positive notions for children and adults, to learn and practice.",1118880000,19,2080,4.732044198895028
997493,3,6305229449,"Disney's Mulan doesn't rank too high on my list, it practically goes on the list of bottom 10.  I recently bought the Special Edition DVD release and did not enjoy the movie, that's why I hardly even took the time to look at the bonus features.  Disney was trying to go beyond their usual and classical formula of weak and lonesome heroines in need to be rescued, and they did a fine job at that, but they also went very, very wrong in other very important parts.

In order to make Mulan seem like a real heroine, or just to represent women in a more realistic way, they turned men into complete fools, absolutely brainless and dumb and that is where the film producers went extremely wrong.  Nowadays it seems that in lots of cartoons men are represented this way, as ugly, burping/spiting machines with no brains and shapeless bodies while women are represented as mature, intelligent, beautiful and reliable and this is simply not right.  But are all men in ""Mulan"" like that?  No, there's Shang, he seems like a fine representation of intelligence and bravery, until it goes overboard.  At one point, Shang held back his tears at a time in which it was very normal for any man to cry and I didn't like that, it makes you think that men are supposed to never show emotion or pain and that is not true and it really bothered me.  Other flaws in this movie included the very, very annoying voice of Eddie Murphy, although it seems that for once he is able to control his foul-mouth, which is somewhat nice.  Animation is sharp but the art to it is absolutely terrible, with the excuse of wanting to imitate Chinese art, the animators made the characters angular and sort of painful to watch.  It is also hard to care for the characters in this film since each of them seems highly flawed.

It is a shame that whenever Disney wants to go to new heights or step out of their classical style, they fail completely.  However, the film still has its high points, as I said, the animation is elaborate and sharp and the music is pretty cool (Except for when Raven sings in some of the bonuses, ugh!).  But even with these few highlights, it is hard for me to recommend the film, buy the soundtrack instead.",1117929600,4,2201,4.4725

Mulan is smart, tough, loves her family and is a little bit rebellious. If there is any ""princess"" I want my daughter to want to emulate it would be Mulan. The folks at Disney might not be sure whether Mulan is one of the Princesses, but in my house, Mulan is the best princess of all.

This is one of the most watchable and most fun of all the Disney cartoons (ok, Lion King might be better taken on the whole, but--especially if you have a little girl--Mulan is the best).",1117065600,2,787,4.3108108108108105

The characters were very likable, and I didn't find myself rolling my eyes or nearly gagging at any of them.  That's another good quality in a movie: likable characters.  Trust me, I've read plenty of books where I think the author got the main character mixed up with the main character's enemy who everyone is supposed to hate.

This is a wonderful film, with gorgeous animation, a thrilling plot,lots of humour, great characters and a superb score.  Mulan herself is an attractive and heartwarming heroine who keeps your interest and sympathy throughout. You feel like cheering when she manages to climb to the top of the pole and throw down the arrow, and there is a breathtakingly exciting scene where the Huns come sweeping down the snow-covered hill and she defeats them with a brilliant piece of strategy  The supporting characters are good too, Mulan's parents (unusually for a Disney film, she has a father as well as a mother)are very sympathetically portrayed, and she also has a feisty grandmother who has one of the best lines in the film, when she sets eyes on gorgeous Captain Shang and says ""Sign me up for the next war!""

In this masterpiece, a young woman by the name of Mulan feels uncomfortably pressured to be the traditional perfect bride and daughter of her time and culture in China.  But unknown to everyone who knows and sees her, she has much different and untraditional plans for herself.  When the Hun Army invades China, one man from every family is called to serve in the country's defense.  When her previously injured father is called to serve, Mulan seizes the opportunity for adventure and honor and takes his place.  Tagging along with her is ex-guardian Mushu, a tiny scrawny dragon willing to put her life in danger to regain his position of exalted guardianship, her lucky cricket, and her trusted anti-Mushu horse Khan.  Together they embark on a remarkable journey so save China and, perhaps, herself.  Will she succeed?  Will she be discovered by her commanding officer?  And will Mushu ever regain his position?

Mulan is played by the talented and spirited Ming Nga (sp?) and Mushu by the hilarious and gifted Eddie Murphy.  It is a worthwhile addition to any collection.  Songs include ""Honor to us all"" and the hilarious and inspiring ""Be a Man"" sequence.

997566,4,6305229449,"Although ""Mulan"" isn't my favorite of the big Mouse's productions, it is definitely in my top ten.  In this tale, a young girl goes against tradition and takes her father's place in a great war with the Mongols by disguising herself as a young man.  The tale has been told before in various forms, but it works very well in this picture.

The story gives girls a strong message of doing what you believe in or what is best, even though it may go against tradition or the majority's point of view.  In the end, Mulan not only gains the respect of her fellow soldiers, but of the entire empire of China.

The action sequences are fairly intense, although there are really only two major battles.  The first is the brilliantly animated fight in the snowy mountains where the Chinese, outnumbered, take on a huge Mongol force lead by the sinister main villain whose name escapes my memory right now.  The second major conflict takes place in the emperor's palace and spills into the streets of the city.

The characters in this film are all given proper introductions, though the main bad guy doesn't have many chances to develop.  All we really know is that he wants to take over the Chinese empire.  Ming-Na Wen provides the speaking voice for Mulan.  The rest of the character voices include B.D. Wong, Pat Morita and a hilarious Harvey Fierstein.  Of course, everyone focuses on the comic relief of Mushu(Eddie Murphy).  Murphy does a splendid job with the character, though I think he could have been given a little more room to expand on the character.  In all honesty, Mushu is almost as funny as Murphy's ""Donkey"" from the ""Shrek"" films.

The songs in this film are pretty good.  ""Reflection"" is a rather good song that is performed by Mulan(singing voice provided by Lea Salonga).  The song is very inspiring.  My favorite song has to be ""Be A Man,"" however.  It just sounds great and reminds me of Elvis' ""GI Blues.""  You'd think the military would be an odd setting for musical numbers, but it works in both of these films.  Another excellent song is ""True To Your Heart,"" performed by Stevie Wonder and boy band 98 Degrees.  It's a very peppy, feel-good song that finishes off the film in great fashion.

The DVD includes a number of special features.  From games to the obligatory ""Making Of"" featurette, it's all here.  There is a music video of the aforementioned Stevie Wonder/98 Degrees song and a very, VERY virginal looking Christina Aguilera performing ""Reflection.""

Overall, a fine addition to the family DVD collection.  I highly recommend this to folks with young daughters due to its good message.  Don't worry if you only have sons, the message works for them as well, and there's plenty of action to quench their craving for fight scenes.

Of course they like that it's animated, there's singing not to mention talking animals.  BUT for me it's a strong and courageous story, in which a young woman realizes that she has to assume responsibility for her family!

Mulan is now a young woman it's time to be a wife.  Her visit with the matchmaker is the worse.  The matchmaker tells her that she will never bring her family honor.

The Huns are attacking China.  Every village needs to send a male to represent their family.  Unfortunately Mulan is and only child.

Instead of allowing her father the only man in her family to go Mulan disguises herself as a man to help her family and her country. Her ancestors send a dragon in an effort to bring her back in order not to disgrace them.  In boot camp, she's learning to fit in with the other soldiers.

A note to those who find this animation Japanese. The Tang dynasty, when the story of Fa Mulan happened, was the period when the Chinese empire flourished. Historical research shows that Japan was one of the countries which had been sending students to study in China during this period. As a result, the students eventually brought back Chinese cultures including clothings, architecture, tea and language etc. back to their own country. One of the examples are the large amount of Chinese characters which Japanese people would use when they write nowadays.",1102809600,2,721,5.269565217391304

997620,5,6305229449,"For me, watching ""Mulan"" on Special Edition DVD was the first time viewing the movie. It's a great presentation and it really holds up well. The music is in the strong Disney tradition, with vocal pieces developed by Matthew Wilder and David Zippel and the awesome soundtrack by the late Jerry Goldsmith. The story is well written, with characters the viewer can really feel for, particularly the main character Mulan. Finally, the film is a visual masterpiece that really draws the eye to its beauty and helps to tell the story. Possibly the film's only weak point is its villain --- Shan-Yu doesn't really have the same effect as some of the more well-developed Disney villains such as Jafar from ""Aladdin"" or Hades from ""Hercules.""

I'm not any big, renowned film critic, so if I haven't sold you on the movie, perhaps I can at least give you a good run-down of the special features. Although the special features for the ""Mulan"" Special Edition DVD are not quite as numerous as those for the recent ""Aladdin"" release, they're just as good. The first disc contains songs / music videos and deleted scenes, as well as a tour of Mulan's World. The songs in this movie are very strong and the music videos are no exception. Some are better than others, but I definitely enjoyed them all. Jackie Chan's performance of ""Be a Man"" in Chinese was a great one to include. There are several deleted scenes, complete with commentary, as well as a deleted song that's fairly cool, but it's obvious wouldn't have worked with the movie. The Mulan's World feature has Mushu (Mark Moseley I would assume, since Eddie Murphy hasn't done the voice since the original feature) explaining various aspects of China. Since it's Mushu, there are plenty of jokes, of course, but I feel this actually really was quite well done as far as learning goes. Finally, the first disc includes a commentary track that gives a lot of insight into the making of the film, what things did and didn't work, and what some of the major people involved with the film liked. The second disc contains one more bonus song, ""Reflection"" in Spanish and a behind-the-scenes tour of the movie. Unlike the ""Aladdin"" behind-the-scenes featurette, this one has a bit more open feel. Each of the aspects from graphic design to music are in separate sections and you can select them to view at your leisure. You'll learn everything from how the movie was developed visually to the process of being it to other countries.

This is definitely the complete package of what one would expect from a two-disc DVD set. If, like me, you haven't seen ""Mulan"" before this, you should definitely take a look, or if you're already a fan of the movie, this is a great DVD set to get.",1100390400,5,2722,4.692468619246862

997622,5,6305229449,"Mulan is beautiful in story, art and style. It departs from the normal Disney style giving an Asian feel. The writers do an excellent job sticking to the story and the characters. The ""sidekick"" characters add to the story instead of distract which is a problem for a few of the recent animated films.

What sets this story apart for me is that Mulan is selfless in the story and the themes of family, respect, tradition, and sacrafice take center stage. If you look at other heroes from not just animation but live action too, the main character's motivations are generaly selfish. Mulan puts her life on the line for her father and her country, not for love, or to be human, or rich or so many other selfish reasons we see so often. The morals and principles of this story are very clear and very powerful.

I enjoyed every aspect of this film from start to finish and like many of the recent animated features in the past two decades this film is definately not just for children.

Mulan will probably be the last great tradional cel animated feature from Disney for a long time. I know a lot of people enjoyed Tarzan and Lilo and Stitch, but Mulan is a notch above those titles. Unfortunately the traditional cel format has given way to the popular 3d animation features. It is two bad, because I really enjoy both formats. I'm sure it will make a comeback in a decade or two after the 3d genre runs its course, but until then we have the luxery of great titles like Mulan on DVD to enjoy.",1099180800,4,1493,4.421818181818182

997687,5,6305229449,"Mulan is one of the finest Disney movies ever produced. I have yet to disagree with Disney on any of their choices for ""Platinum"" or ""Special Edition"" releases.

The first thing I would like to address is the aspect ratio. A past reviewer claimed that ""this is obviously not the original aspect ratio for this film!"". That statement is utterly false. The previous release of Mulan on DVD had CROPPED wide-screen. This means that the picture was re-formatted so that it would appear to be in the 1:85:1 ratio, which trimmed off the edges of the picture as well as some of the top and bottom. True wide-screen always gives you MORE picture. It's extremely important to know the bars on the top and bottom are UNUSED space. Also,the original DVD release was NOT compatible with wide-screen televisions. I have viewed this disc up-scaled on a 50 inch HDTV and it looks glorious!

Now, for the first time, Mulan is presented in it's ORIGINAL aspect ratio of 1:66:1. This is the ratio for other films like Aladdin and The Lion King. The wide-screen is entirely anamorphic so wide-screen TV owners can rejoice at not having to stretch out the picture or have unnecessary black bars on the top and bottom of the screen. The picture quality/resolution is quite pleasing on an HD Display as I said above. Clear, bright, vivid colors show through on a spotless transfer of the film taken directly from the original CAPS files in the Disney vault.

The bonus features are very good. A wealth of material is presented on both Disc 1 and 2, making this truly worthy of the title ""Special Edition"". The features themselves are covered in other reviews, so I won't go into that. Just let me say that this is definitely a DVD release that no Disney or Mulan fan should pass up.

Mulan: ""Can you stay for dinner?""  Grandmother: ""Can he stay FOREVER?""",1098748800,12,1832,4.659442724458204
997688,3,6305229449,"Yes, I have heard many stories about Mulan since I was young and I have grown to accept that the different versions existed might have presented contradictory facts about the legendary Mulan. Disney's Mulan, despite the fact that it's highly entertaining with the wonderful animation and catchy songs, I cannot help but am irritated by the writers'/producers' ignorance about the background historical facts. Mulan ia a legendary hero and I'm not sure which dynasty did she live. I'm not even sure whether she was real. However, one thing I know for sure: the Chin Emperor was not a benevolent, but a cruel ruler. It is generally agreed that Chin dynasty ended in the rebellion of Xiang Yu and Liu Pang, and Xiang Yu didn't get killed in the comical way portrayed in the cartoon. In history, the ending of the Chin dynasty was welcomed and Xiang Yu was generally being upheld as one of the heros.  It's fine with me that Mulan is a well-liked film but I hope that the viwers will keep in mind that the chinese history bit in Mulan is entirely inaccurate.",1098748800,4,1054,4.666666666666667

997691,5,6305229449,"First of all, I was, and am, very glad about Disney's including a MANDARIN LANGUAGE AUDIO TRACK on their Special Edition DVD. --Unfortunately, this is true for the Special Edition ONLY; the newer blu-ray has 6(!) foreign language tracks, including Dutch, Flemish and Catalan, but NO Mandarin or Cantonese!!! (Disney, what are you thinking?!)

Next: I have to emphatically disagree with reviewer Bill Mydo below. -You will excuse me if I spend some little time defending this film against his critique; Mulan happens to be my favorite Disney animated movie, second only perhaps to Beauty and the Beast. Perhaps my being Chinese-American may have something to do with it, as does the fact that I strongly identify with the character's self-doubts. Still, I am fairly particular as to what I consider ""good art""; and it boggles and confounds me that anyone would fail to see the difference between this movie and, for example, Hunchback or Hercules.

Yes, Disney's Mulan is very much a western/ American movie, made for western and American- not Asian- audiences. No, they ""didn't get it right""; or, not exactly. But I never expected them to, and I give them a good deal of credit for trying. They came quite a bit closer that I ever thought that they would. Nor do I find this movie overly feminist (no more than Snow White or Cinderella are ""chauvinist""). Mulan may be a strong female character, but she is not Aladdin's Princess Jasmine. Mulan is not defined by rebellion, nor by what she rejects. Instead she upholds her sense of honor as she struggles to find out who she is and where she fits in. Moreover, in a genre known for its blatant ad nauseum boy-meets-girl love themes, I truly appreciated the downplayed understatedness of the ""interest"" between Mulan and Captain Shang.

As to the ""commercial"" aspect of the film; yes, it had its tie-ins and its merchandising. What Disney movie doesn't? But the real issue is the worth of the film itself, and on this I take exception to the review below. I believe there is more in it than Mr. Mydo gives credit for.

The film does have its awkward moments. The scene with the match-maker and Mulan's first entrance into the army camp are both extremely painful to watch- I do not enjoy watching anyone be utterly humiliated- not even a cartoon character (and I do not believe that someone as bright as Mulan would fumble so badly over simply coming up with a new name). I also find it somewhat irksome that one minor character, Mushu the dragon, continually steals attention away from the movie's proper focus. And there are a number of jokes and visual gags that closely border on PG. I found this in somewhat poor taste in a kid's movie.

But these faults are counterbalanced, and more than compensated for, by the scenes that really work. The opening ""brush painting"" of the Great Wall; Mulan's song (Reflections) and the ensuing scene of loving encouragement from her father; the scene where she decides to leave home; her heart-to-heart talk with Mushu at the abandoned camp in the mountains; the Imperial Palace where she is honored by the Emperor before all China... the sheer artistry of these scenes is breathtaking.

I do have one problem with how the new Special Edition is presented.  Why on Earth did Disney opt to give us a letterboxed version with a 1.66:1 ratio, when the previous DVD was presented with a ratio of 1.85:1????  Even the new ""Aladdin"" comes in 1.66:1.  These are obviously NOT the original versions as shown in theaters.  The box for ""Aladdin"" states ""Presented in Originally Created Aspect Ratio"".

997767,4,6305229449,"Mulan was Disney's last animated grasp at a musical. Following this movie we have yet to have another Disney theatrical animated feature that features the characters singing songs Broadway-style. Strange considering that Disney were making animated musicals during the years when bursting into song in a film was not considered fashionable and, not long after Mulan was made, the musical came back into cinematic vogue. Still it seems that Disney pride them selves on being out of step with everyone else - even to their detriment. The songs in Mulan are wonderfully fitting and, although the score has nothing to seriously rival Be Our Guest or Circle of Life, numbers like Reflection and I'll Make a Man Out of You deserve a place in Disney's musical Hall of Fame.

Mulan is not one of Disney's mordern greatest hits along the lines of The Lion King, The Little Mermaid or Beauty and the Beast. Instead it sits with the likes of Hercules and Hunchback as one of those films that is great but didn't receive much publicity and box-office in comparison. Hopefully this extras-heavy package will rectify this somewhat and help it attain more than being a 'Disney Princess' movie (not being a six year old girl, I find the whole notion of the 'Disney Princess' drive rather cheapening to the characters involved - still it's good marketing).

The package seems similar to the treatment that Alice in Wonderland got earlier this year (and that Disney keeps threatening to do with Lilo and Stitch, Pocahontas and Mary Poppins - but still no sign of them) with more scope due to the film's comparitive youth. The never-before-heard song will be interesting although it is doubtful it will appear fully animated and part of the finished film a la Human Again and Morning Report. More likely it will appear accompanied by stills like I'm Odd on the Alice DVD. Mushu the Dragon pops up on some extras but, since he hasn't been involved in the character since the original film, it is doubtful whether Eddie Murphy will be providing vocals. The audio commentary should be extremely interesting (they always are) as should the information supplied on China and it's customs (although they are sure to be child-friendly since they're hosted by an animated dragon!). For the adults and buffs there seems to be plenty of behind-the-scenes stuff although on some Disney DVD releases these are frustratingly short and undetailed - fingers crossed for this one. Digital Dim Sum also sounds very interesting.

Since this is a double discer I'm sure we can expect the extra's quality to be similar to that of the Alice release although the heights of The Lion King, Beauty and the Beast, Snow White and the upcoming Aladdin (which this seems to be an appetiser for) would be prefered. Just as long as we aren't fobbed off with one similar to the very disappointing Pinnochio 'Special Edition' released last year.",1090713600,5,2894,4.890020366598778

This one was incredibly simple and to the point. Value all people and learn what they have to offer no matter what their sex, believes, et cetera. I highly recommend this movie for the whole family. It is ashame Disney hasn't learned it shouldn't limit the sales of their movies yet. I think they are going to learn the hard way when someone buys them out and stops the stupid moratorium policy. I know if I could buy Disney the first thing I would do is fire the person or persons responsible for the moratorium and second I would immediately make all Disney movies available all the time. If you see negative votes here there is a good possibility they come from scalpers. They want to sell you used Disney movies for three or four times what they are worth.

The movie opens with Mulan getting ready to go to the ""Matchmaker.""  Although, she is a beautiful girl, she lacks the grace to make a good impression.  Devistated, she returns home. Her father tells her that ""like the cherry blossoms, her season has not come.""

When China is invaded by the Huns, there is one line in the movie that is uttered by the emperor and it is SO insightful. The general in charge of the armies confidently announces that his men can handle this invasion.  However, the emperor issues a proclamation calling all available men because, ""sometimes a single grain of rice may be the deciding balance in tipping the scales.""  Or - ""one man may make a difference between conquest and defeat.""

In this case, it turns out to be a woman!  I LOVE how Mulan interacts horribly with the men at first and how she is told to leave.  Mulan has to prove herself and she doesn't give up.

Even after she is a hero, Mulan is disgraced when it is discovered that she is a woman.  She is shunned and yet when she must come to the rescue of China again, her comrades are loyal to her and listen to her ideas.

Throughout the movie there are the different interactions of those who accept women for who they are and those who are stuck within stereotypes.

This story tells about a young Chinese girl who failed the test for honor, but when she noticed that her dad was going to war, it got WORSE! To protect her father, she cuts her hair and puts on her armor (there was a wonderful dramatic music while she did that. It was so unbelieveable and touchy!).

Eddie Murphy is not welcome here as the '90's LIKE' dragon, who's lines are soooo coooool, and rad. I felt like I was listening to a cartoon from Saturady mornings! Why not keep him still GOOFY and FUNNY but historically correct? It's like Disney is so afraid that if the dialouge of the kids we have today isn't in there somewhere, then it'll flop. Not TRUE. My niece brought this up, and she's only eight! She asked me why do some of the characters in the movie not sound historic? 'Most of them sound and act like us today' were her exact words.
'Be A Man' and other songs are sure winnners, keeping right to the story, and the culture VISUALLY is great and acurate, so why not keep the culture of the way people spoke to each other back then? They had humour too! Just not this sarcastic ' Right on, keep it cool daddy-oh' junk. Some of the jokes were funny.....like the part where Eddie Murphy's dragon was wearing the stone head of a guardian dragon to be disguised so he can save the day was hilarious! Or Mulan swimming with the soldiers, and had to hide her 'woman' body since she cannot reveal that she's not a man....poor Mulan. Lousy parts,(too many of them) like the BACON & EGGS ??!! (in ancient China??!!) for breakfast, or of course, they had to use fireworks at the end, like a ""MISSLE"" to keep things a bit too familliarly modern.....you guys can't be original...have to be so SAFE FOR MODERN COOOOL RAD KIDS, HUH?
So, keep up good humour and great stories...and the visuals culturally.....the dialouge and attitude stinks of most of the characters. Stop modernizing any of your movies that are suppose to be historical!!!

Mulan realizes that he could never survive a battle, let alone the riggers of winter in the mountains.  She disguises herself as a man and sets out to represent the family as a member of the army.  This is no GI Jane, a 1 star movie.  This is a solidly told story that is all the more interesting because it is set in China, where a girl has no status.  Mulan is brave, determined and admirable and wins over those in per patrol that must fight with her.
We rated this movie 22 out of 41.  Disney used CG here but the effort could have been better.  This is a story that the whole family liked and we watched it several times, but then interest waned. My little ones will go through phases of watching a new Disney movie to death, and then it wanes to ""periodic"".  This one never an obsession for anyone in the family, no one has anyone asked to see it lately.  When the kids were asked to help rate it they remembered that there really was some cool stuff in this movie.  But ultimately, there were 21 Disney movies that they liked better.
I thought the problems might be the medium coloring, but they watch the ""power puff girls"", and Disney's worst isn't ever close to being that bad.  I also didn't care for the digital imaging job that was done... almost as if it was rushed.  I thought the action was good and the characters interesting, so maybe the kids didn't care for the music.  What would the Hunchback of Notre Dame be without that wonderful music!

Though the lines are not quite as funny as what you'd expect them to be for Eddie Murphy, he is the best part of the show.
Good movie.  The animation is wonderful. It's just not one of those movies that my family requests to watch very often at all.  It is at the back of the pile of Disney movies now - waiting to be requested again.  It is worth seeing once - from there you'll have to form your own judgement as to whether it becomes a family favorite - or just a once in awhile movie.

Mulan is the beautiful young Chinese girl that has a kind of tomboyish way of thinking, way after her time. After having a terrible time at the Matchmaker, she learns that her father, being the only man of the house, is being called off to war. She knows that he is not in fighting health, and that he would surely get hurt in battle. In order to save her father, she cuts her hair and pretends to be a man and goes off to war in his place, posing as a little known son. After going through a rigorous training course, led by the lovable male figure of the movie, she is ready for battle accompanied by Crick-Kee, Mushu the dragon, and her horse. Mulan encounters some face to face combat with the Huns, and eventually is injured. She heals, but the injury revealed her true gender. She is sent home with a strict warning, but overhears a plan of attack on the emperor by the Huns. She rushes to the palace to warn the army, but because of her history, she is not believed. When the Huns arrive, she pulls together the army and engages in a swordfight with the leader of the Huns. After a close escape, she defeats the Hun leader, and watches in amazment as the emperor presents her to the crowd and she sees everywhere, the people of China bowing down in respect to her. She is awarded the position of Emperor's advisor, and the respect and trust of everyone. This movie has some great music, the best by far being ""I'll Make a Man Out of You"". It also has some great humor, thanks to Mushu, voiced by Eddie Murphy. This is one of the best Disney movies that you can get and really has a good lesson to it. You should definitly buy this movie.

998156,5,6305229449,"Based on a beloved Chinese legend, Mulan is a lovely, spirited, intelligent, outspoken, but less than graceful young girl growing up in ancient China. She has come of age, and it is time to be married off to a young man, but the village matchmaker does not believe it is possible. Speaking openly, even to men, and having poor serving skills, Mulan is simply not a proper young Chinese woman and will never bring her family honor. Her despair over dishonoring her family and her desire to freely embrace her true self must be cast aside, however, when the Emperor calls out for one male member of each Chinese family to join the army and help defend the land from the invading Huns. With her father too weak to last long in military service, Mulan is the only member of her family who is able to fight, but a woman joining the army is forbidden, and the penalty of deception is death! After she makes the dangerous decision to disguise herself as a man and fight in her father's place, Mulan's ancestors send a mighty dragon to bring her back before she causes her family further shame and embarrassment. But Mushu (Eddie Murphy), a much more miniscule dragon, takes his place and decides to help Mulan in her quest instead of bringing her home. In her guise as a male soldier, Mulan barely manages to keep her secret while training, marching, and fighting, but by the time her struggle is over, Mulan and those around her learn that she doesn't have to be a perfect bride or beauty to bring her family of honor.

There's a lot of animosity towards the Disney animated features that have been released since ""The Lion King."" Many have said that ""The Lion King"" was the last great film of the Disney Renaissance that supposedly started with ""The Little Mermaid."" Not at all true. ""Mulan"" is a prime example. The story is powerful, emotional, and more real than anything Disney feature animation has tackled before, except maybe ""Pocahontas."" The film envelopes you in ancient Chinese culture, the music is fantastic, and the characters are believable, endearing, and beautifully played by their respective voice talents. Eddie Murphy, of course, is the big name tagged to this feature, playing a role that he seemed to be reprising in Shrek (but he's much funnier here). Much of the rest of the cast list reads like a Who's Who of Asian-American actors, from Pat Morita to James Hong, with the beautiful Ming-Na Wen as Mulan herself. And, while there IS a clear villain, the ferociously looming and eventually realized threat of Shan Yu (Miguel Ferrer) and his army of Huns, the real conflict in this film is Mulan's struggle to discover herself and to prove her worth to her family, her people, and to herself.

This 2-disc Special Edition does a nice job stepping things up from the previous Gold Collection release. Presented in anamorphic widescreen, Disc One features an informative audio commentary with directors and producer that gives you insight into the depths to which the filmmakers went to make ""Mulan"" culturally accurate. It also holds a Disneypedia Activity, a ""Fun Facts"" clip, and a nice collection of deleted scenes that include a cut song for Mushu. Disc One also has a collection of preview trailers for upcoming Disney releases, naturally, and a special ""Mulan 2"" sneak peak. There's also a ""Music and More"" section that provides us with 4 music videos. As expected, you get the 2 music videos from the previous release of Mulan: ""Reflection,"" in which the vocally stunning Christina Aguilera sings the lovely ""be yourself"" themed song while ironically dressed quite un-Christina-like, and ""True to Your Heart,"" where Nick Lachey leads ""98 Degrees"" through Chinatown as they stalk a hot girl and run into Stevie Wonder. Both make for some darn good tunes and interesting visuals. A 3rd video offering is the Mandarin version of ""I'll Make a Man Out of You,"" sung by Jackie Chan. This makes for interesting entertainment for us Chan fans. One wonders, though, why Donnie Osmond didn't get a video for the American version. It's definitely one of the best moments in the film (though there are many great moments). And, the last video is, you guest it, Raven. This time, Raven sings ""True To Your Heart"" off the ""Disneymania 2"" CD. Now, I know we all get annoyed when Disney tries to pass a commercial off as legitimate art, but I have to admit that I think she sings pretty good. Problem is, why don't they make an effort to do a decent video? How many recording booth videos is Disney Channel going to make?

Disc 2 of the ""Mulan"" 2-disc Special Edition carries over the ""Music and More"" section for one more video. This time, we get the Spanish version of ""Reflection,"" sung by an uncredited vocalist whom I am informed is named Lucero. It's pretty much the same thing as the Aguilera video, but in Spanish. Sadly, there is no big ""Behind the Scenes"" featurette on ""Mulan,"" which is too bad since I'm sure there was one made for the Disney Channel. They really should include those on their DVD releases. In fact, it seems that most of the ""Backstage Disney"" (as it is called) section extra features have been shot after the fact. We don't get to see the sort of footage we used to see in behind the scenes Disney stuff, with animators hard at work and voice actors in the recording studio. In fact, the voice cast is tragically absent from this set. Now that is a true shame. Not so much as an interview. However, there is still plenty to see and do, plus, many sections thankfully include the good ol' ""Play All"" button. We are offered first a section called ""The Journey Begins,"" which includes a look into a trip to China that the filmmakers took for inspiration and preparation, a wonderful recitation (set to artwork) of the poem the film used as a basis, and two early presentation reels. Second is the ""Story Artists' Journey,"" which holds a featurette of filmmakers reflecting back on the film along with storyboard to screen comparisons. Next is a favorite of mine, the ""Design"" section, where we get to see all those neat art galleries. I love to see all the cute artwork of Disney girls evolving into their final forms. *drool* This section also houses three featurettes on art design, character design, and color. Good stuff! The ""Production"" section offers progressive demonstrations, a featurette on ""The Hun Charge"" computer effects, and a featurette on crowd computer effects. The ""Music"" section simply holds a brief featurette that could have been longer, but as it is, makes point to mention one of Mulan's best attributes, only using songs that fit story purposes. The final bit of extras are in a section called ""International Mulan."" There's a featurette on translating the film for the world audience, a multi-language reel, and a publicity art gallery.

There are only two major blemishes to this lovely 2-disc DVD release. One is the aforementioned lack of voice cast presence among the extras. The other is the fact that there are no theatrical trailers for the film itself to be found. Even the previous Gold Collection release had a trailer. Other than that, this is an excellent release of a beautiful and touching new Disney Classic that should be in everyone's DVD library, particularly recommended for those sick of Princesses and looking for a very different type of ""Disney Girl."" Myself, I'll take Mulan and the princesses too, ha!",1025395200,,7390,4.780125195618154
998157,5,6305229449,"I love ""Mulan.""  I wasn't sure if it would be as good as the previous cartoon musicals I've seen (Aladdin, Lion King etc). I ended up loving it!!  I thought it was a very good message about defying the norms of society and being yourself.  a very big step for Disney.  Eddie Murphey portrays the amusing Mushu dragon who helps Mulan on her way to join the army in honor of her grandfather, who is sick and cannot fight anymore. The songs are great...especially ""Reflection"" which has beautiful lyrics (also song brilliantly by Pop singer Christina Aguilera on the sountrack).  The animation is great, and very similar to my fav movie ""Pocahontas.""  If you loved ""Pocahontas"" and didn't get to see ""Mulan"" in theatres, then I urge you to buy it. This in my opinion is the last great film in the wave of Disney musicals (beginning of course with a classic favorite Little Mirmaid). Now we have to put up with annoying stories of ape-boys and Aliens visiting Earth (yawn). So that said, I really reccomend ""Mulan.""  I think she is a good role model for girls and in addition the story is great! This will become a classic...and is reccomended to anyone of all ages (I was 15 when I saw it). Overall grade for ""Mulan"": A+

998160,4,6305229449,"The newest Disney Animation studio in Florida just opened, and this was their first film to animate. Maybe that is why the movie has a fresh look that's a departure from Disney!
A new studio animation division called for new animators and directors, who were new enough not to fall into the cookie-cutter plots and themes we have seen in recent Disney films. Although it didn't garnish as much recognition as Beauty and the Beast or Aladdin, Mulan is just as entertaining, witty, dramatic and FUNNY. The humor works, not really because Eddie Murphy has a prominent role in this movie, but because the jokes originate out of the plot and the theme- the dragon Mushu is not just there to crack jokes! You will not be taken aback by the portrayal of Chinese people or their history (although the Huns never really attacked China, but no matter) and they do NOT mimick the anime style.
The theme, by the way, is honor, standing up for yourself, and keeping with those you love to the fullest extent! Oh yeah, and cross-dressing! Not a first for Disney, they have done it before, but this is the first animated film where cross-dressing is the major target for humor. It treats the suggestive theme very gently so no one will be offended (and we never do see anything!) while at the same time takes it to such outrageous heights that you can't help but accept it.
Visually, the animation is top-notch. The art is inspired by Chinese brushstrokes and beautiul subdued color palettes.
As for the songs, there are four here, none that are Oscar-worthy, but okay to listen to. The best song could be ""Be A Man"", sung during the booth camp scenes.
I would not make too big a deal on the bonus material, however. They really only consist of one trailer and two music videos, all with bad reception.

I'm sure Disney took some liberties with the story, as they do all that get turned into mass-entertainment. This film is exceptionally well-done. The vocal casting is spot-on, with Eddie Murphy nearly stealing the show as Mushu, the wise-cracking dragon sent(?) by her ancestors to protect her. The love Mulan has for her family, her father in particular, is well-represented here, as it is her love for him that drives her to take his place in the Chinese army. What would any of us do to save the life of someone we love? The fight scenes are awesome, being of higher quality than many live-action movies. The songs are top-notch, especially 'Reflection', and 'Be A Man'. What should please some is that the charactors don't break into song at the drop of a hat, as is usual in many animated films nowadays, but rather the songs are dispersed throughout the film, and only five songs at that.
The animation is superb, the vocal talent is perfect in their roles, and the plot is well-thought out. A definate feather in the cap of Disney!",1016928000,,1134,4.646766169154229

998218,1,6305229449,"I've read many plays about Mulan. I've read many ballads of Mulan. I've saw many movies about Mulan. But, what Disney did here is an outrage. Mulan was never a victim of misogyny. In the real story of Mulan, the men who found out that she was a woman, weren't angry. On the contrary, they were pleased! Because they've underestimated what women can do. In fact, if you go through many Chinese stories and fairy tales, you'll found out that there are many female warriors and female protagonists who did not hate their own culture (let alone think it was misogynistic). Does that seem like China (or Chinese men) is misogynistic toward females? The view that Asian males are misogynistic is a stereotype. Yet, Disney played on this. For instance, in the song ""A Girl Worth Fighting For,"" you have the following lyrics: ""I couldn't care less what she'll wear, or what she looks like! It all depends on what she cooks like!"" There is nothing in Chinese literature where a women's worth is measured by her husband's belch. Then we have the character Chi Fu say, ""She's a woman. She'll never be worth anything!"" All lies. Where in Chinese literature do you have that saying? First, women's worth are measured by how well they cook, then they aren't worth anything!  Can Disney make up their minds about their own lies?! The real Mulan is an example for females and males alike. For instance, Chinese used the real Mulan story to motivate people to fight imperialism. The Disney executives should be ashamed of themselves. They've ruined my culture and people are buying into their lies. The movie is not structurally good, nor were the songs entertaining. This fake Mulan story was short, annoying, and insulting.",1012521600,32,1708,4.7898305084745765

998220,4,6305229449,"I'm an Asian-American adult male of Filipino-Chinese descent & I actually liked this movie!
First, it has a positive message for young girls.  Mulan is a strong-willed (but not arrogant or overly aggressive), intelligent young woman who defies unjust ""traditions"" in order to save her country from invading hordes of ""Huns"" (Tartars/Mongols?) while at the same time, being compassionate & caring.  Her strength comes from her basic (& sometimes flawed) humanity, not from aggression (or trying to be ""perfect"") & that's what I liked about the character.  (For those of you who haven't seen the movie yet, in the story, her elderly father is ""drafted"" into the Chinese army & in order to save him from conscription, she masquerades as a man to serve in her father's place.)
As far as Chinese history & culture is concerned, Disney gets the basic look of pre-Ching Dynasty China right.  (It's kind of hard to tell which Dynasty they're portraying, but it definately is before the Manchu conquest, since all of the men are sporting ""top-knots"", not pig-tails.)  The Chinese martial-arts (wushu or kung-fu not Japanese ""karate"") is also depicted accurately.  I also like the showing of the bamboo cannons, which the medieval Chinese armies did use.  (That's right.  Martial-arts movie fans often get the mistaken idea that the Chinese only used kung-fu & didn't use guns.  The fact is, the Chinese developed gunpowder & created the first guns ever!)
Some Asian-americans have complained about the ""inaccuracies"" prevalent in Mulan.  To be sure, there are some modern references in Eddie Murphy's monologues, but remember, this is an animated comedy!  Also, if you were to watch any of the old Shaw Brothers kung-fu films depicting the same time periods, they are rife with historical inaccuracies!  (Nobody complains about those movies, because those films are made by Asians!)  And at least, Mulan makes an attempt at getting it reasonably ""right"" (much more than the old ""Kung-Fu"" tv series, which is way off!)  Mulan does depict Asians with dignity & nobility (while also showing real human flaws.)  It does not favor negative stereo-types & any negative press from the Asian-American community is un-deserved!  (Lighten up, guys!  It's a cartoon!)
Lastly, the singing.  My own personal bias made me cringe at the songs!  (Sorry.  I'm not saying they're bad, it's just my own personal taste, that's all!)  In my opinion (and I know a lot of people won't agree with me), I think this animated movie would have been much better without the singing!  (But, as a marketing ploy, the singing & sales of the soundtrack make sense & I'm sure little kids liked the songs.)
I definately recommend this movie.  I hope one day, this movie would be remade as a live action drama.  (Maybe with Zhang Zi-Yi from Crouching Tiger/Hidden Dragon in the title role?  If not, how about Lea Salonga, who sings in this movie, in the title role.  She'll need some kung-fu/wushu training first, but I think she'd be great!)

Mulan has a moral story to tell to, and all in all I think it does a good job without letting the points get in the way of the story and dialogue which is way to easy to do.  The animation is wonderful as to be expected and the story flows well.
The only part lacking may be the romance part, it was predictable of course this being a kids movie, but came across a bit forced.  Perhaps leaving it out would have been a better choice, Mulan could have been just a hero, she didn't need to be a hero that gets her man in the end.

998222,5,6305229449,"""Mulan"" is one of the strongest entries by Disney in the late 90's. Aside from fantastic animation, what really makes this movie so great is it's intense epic-like unfolding (which should attract adults), with the Disney comedic angle (Mushu, the Dragon) to attract the kids.
Disney's 36th Animated release, also offers a strong message that I really don't think any of their films have had since Pinocchio. A child, whether being a wooden-boy or in this case a teenaged girl, can have courage and be unselfish when it comes to helping or protecting their family.
The DVD edition has a great picture presentation, and the Surround Sound is very effective. Especially during the stampede, which seemed to come out of ""The Lion King"".",1005436800,3,732,4.959349593495935

998332,5,6305229449,"Mulan is the story of a young girl who seemingly is out of place in her locale.  She's a bit of a klutz around the house and when she goes for an evaluation by the all important, she makes a shambles of the whole process.  None of these actions are intentional, they just seem to happen to Mulan.

The turning point comes when there is an invasion of China from the west and able bodied men are summoned to join the Army.  Mulan's father, though not really fit, feels he must answer the call as he has no sons to send to serve the emporer.  Mulan hears of this and she disguises herself and runs off to the Army.  Here she is still disastor prone but when the training is done and the crunch comes, she proves herself to be all too competent and courageous, ultimately gaining the thanks of the emporor himself.

This film is extremely well crafted.  The villians are typcially dark, brooding and sinister.  You know as soon as you come across them in the opening scenes of the film that they will not be good for China.  Violence is more implied than actually scene or it is indirect such as an avalanche that Mulan creates to save her unit buddies as they prepare to be over run by the human wave crashing down on them.  Villages are over run but there is no on screen gore, more just wrecked homes and scattered childrens toys.  The weasely snitch from the royal court is extremely well done.  He soon reveals that he is more at home with palace intrigues than roughing it with the troops.

I found this to be a good film and with some parental preparation, it should be able to be viewed by all children, not to mention adults.  I found it to be a highly entertaining, and at times moving, film.  I recommend it to all.",1002672000,5,1723,4.304347826086956

In this movie, Hua Mulan (I own a Singapore comic book by the same name too) is brought upon the matchmaker. It's tradition, for any of you who don't know. Now, Mulan is uncertain, since she'd rather do something else noble to please her family. Even her father doesn't thing she can make it through. He calls the ancestors, who get a rude awakening. Not trying to spoil anything though. This scene is the funniest part, where she leaves a permanent mark on the matchmaker, a rather bad one. She meets an amusing little cricket Krikee. He's so adorable! Another interesting and hilarious character is Mushu (voiced by Eddie Murphy.) He's wisecracking, all the same. Meanwhile, the Huns are invading China. Her aging father has been recruited. Mulan, fearing for her father's safety, decides to fight for him, posing as a man. Oh yeah, her name at the army camp is Ping.

998423,5,6305229449,"As the 36th animated masterpiece, this has to be the funniest movie yet. I could not stop laughing. The adorable, mischievous dragon (Mushu) has Eddie Murphy's voice and is perhaps the cutest animation I have ever seen. Watch for what guardian dragon Mushu does when he is trying to explain why he is not ""just"" a lizard. It will knock your funny socks off.

Mulan is extremely beautiful and her facial expressions make you actually feel everything she is feeling emotionally. I was so amazed they could put so much feeling into an animated character. Her lovable and tenacious spirit is admirable. She also seems to always be getting into trouble and the slapstick humor is the best I have ever seen in a Disney movie. The ""lucky"" cricket is a kind of side kick for the dragon and is supposed to bring Mulan luck.

This is based on an ancient Chinese legend in which a girl disguises herself as a soldier to protect her aging father so he doesn't have to go to war against the Hun army (the soldiers all look like wrestlers) which has come across the northern border. Mulan trains for war and proves herself quite capable of learning martial arts and excelling at all areas of military training.

The movie has a rather ominous beginning, a hilarious center and a memorable ending. It is just perfect to say the least. Through the movie Mulan is always trying to be the perfect daughter. What her father says at the end of the movie is so beautiful and shows the unconditional love between parent and child.

The main point to the movie is to allow children to become the person they are inside. To nurture their true gifts and to give them unconditional love. ""The children of our country materially have just about everything, but what they're often lacking is love and attention."" -Johann Christoph Arnold

In the Chinese culture, honor is very important, so this aspect is very prominent throughout the movie. In a way, it could help a child to realize that it is fine to be proud of your country. Many Chinese traditions and symbols are incorporated into the movie making it a spectacularly beautiful movie.

Mulan is an old tale set back in yesteryear with dragons and spirits. I think that's why my kids like to watch it. It gives them a sense of fantasy.
Another good way to rate DVD cartoons is the music. For me, if there are songs that you can sing to during the movie, it makes the movie so much more fun. There are a number of sing-along songs that will keep your youngsters' attention.

At least with real movie stars, we can always fantasize about someday meeting them on the street and striking up a conversation, but Mulan will always remain out of touch.
Anyway, back to the story. It's well made and interesting because it shows that Disney is waking up to the fact that the Sleeping Giant itself is waking up. There are over a billion people over there who need to be woven into Disney's world view and this is a great way to do it.

Mulan follows the story of China being invaded by the Huns and a Chinese girl, Mulan, dressing up as a boy and going to war in her father's place because he is too old to fight. This is treason and if she is found out she will be killed.  The film is a mix of humorous, sad and dramatic parts which works really well, and there is barely a dull moment; my list of 'favourite parts' covers almost the whole film, the only part that drags a bit is with the ancestors' spirits, as it just seems to lag a little there, with Mushu the only one being really funny. All the songs are great, the best ones that come to mind are 'Reflection.' and 'The Girl we're Fighting For.' but all the others are good, too. Mulan is a very strong character matched only, I think by Pocahontas in Disney films, but I prefer Mulan.

This movie is worth the money, although I think it lacks one good love song between Mulan and the Captain at the end--- Donny Osmond singing with Lea Salonga would have been awesome!",969580800,,474,4.552941176470588
998514,5,6305229449,"The Huns are attacking China, and the wise and good Emperor has requested  that one man from each household join his army to protect the land.  Fa  Mulan's father, very conscious of the honor it is to serve the Emperor,  accepts this command, even though he is severely crippled.
Knowing her  father will die if he goes to war, Mulan steals his armor and disguises  herself as a man, taking his place in the army.  Joined by the cute  Cri-Kee, her horse, Khan, and a has-been dragon spirit named Mushu, Mulan  attempts to bring honor to her family, her Emperor, and herself.
The  Chinese theme of Mulan is played very strongly in the art, which is  reminiscent of Chinese watercolors.  The movie, though very stylized, has  the feeling of the classic Disney films.
The characters of Mulan and her  sidekicks are descent people trying desperately to solve a very serious  problem.  The audience can really sympathize with them, and cheer for them,  and cry for them...
The music is entertaining... More rock than  classical, but still with that Disney feel to it.  The musical numbers are  all well done and entertaining, and the score is wonderfully written.
The  lead male character/love interest, a soldier with a lineage of service in  the army, is fairly flat...  There's not much to him other than his  single-minded goal of beating the Huns out of China.
At some points,  Mulan does resort some fairly obvious pop humor, ala Aladdin, which breaks  the mood and reality of the story.  Some moments are played over the top,  comedy wise, and in general this does not help the movie.
The movie ends  rather abruptly, though it is on a high note.  There isn't much time for a  resolution to the tale, and the viewer may be left wanting more.  (Maybe  that's good for Disney....)
Overall Impression:  No question about it,  this is one Disney film that is worth owning.  The few bad points are far  outweighed by the good, and it is, as I have stated, a very entertaining  movie.
Those of you with children...  There are some tense battle images  in this film.  On the flipside, Mulan is a good role model in that she  sacrifices her own desires to keep another person safe... What a good  message for the leaders of tomorrow!",968976000,4,2227,4.645994832041343
998515,4,6305229449,"Basically, it comes down to this.  The good things about Mulan - good  songs (esp. Be a Man) witty lines, especially from Mushu, a heroine who can  fight and be tough and isn't sickeningly good, some pretty tough scenes,  like the destroyed village, and good drawing which looks sort of Chinese  but also realistic.  The bad things about Mulan - it's OK for Mushu to  speak like a westerner as you get used to it and accept it, but stuff like  'jerks', 'quit' and 'guys' jars when the other characters say it, also  despite the feminist overtones Mulan still goes home and gets married in  the end.  I knew nothing about the original Mulan story so can't say how it  fares in that respect, but as a Disney movie it's great - much better than  Pocahontas.",965779200,,754,4.455882352941177

Disney's 'Mulan' is a wonderfully entertaining story  about courage and comradeship with all the typical (and necessary) Disney  mushy stuff too.  I love this movie and have already added it to my  collection.  Eddie Murphy's little dragon is fantastically funny and the  scene with Mulan and her father at the end always brings a tear to my eye.  Mulan proved herself and was accepted for that.

Imagine my suprise when Mulan hit the theaters and we saw a woman who saved the day  without having a man's potential mariage proposal as the principle  motivation.
Still reeling from the Disneyized Pocahontas, I also  appreciated the fact that women were portrayed more realisticly in this  movie. The musical score is not the greatest, but the ""Be A Man""  during basic training could just as well still be playing in the current  debate over women in the millitary. When I am feeling particularly  incensed, I wonder if watching this movie would be beneficial for many  members of congress since some of them clearly have a problem with women  serving.
Although there were breakthroughs with Ariel (who did not  listen to her father) Belle (who was a total bookworm) and Jasmine (who did  not like the arrainged marriage law)Mulan is the most feminist Disney  heroine. This is definently a movie that adults as well as kids can enjoy  because of the subtle connections to real life events.
Without being  preachy, the movie reinforces the idea that it is honorable for women to  break bariers and do the atypical. Three cheers for Disney!",964224000,5,1268,4.887323943661972
998518,4,6305229449,"The visuals in this film are stunning.  Unfortunately, the sound does not match up.  I'm refering to the profusion of westernised accents (especially Eddie Murphy's) and the songs.  I find them very jarring in the presence of  the beautifully rendered visuals of the Great Wall, Mulan's homestead, etc.
For kids, at least for western kids, this is certainly not a fatal  flaw, but it does lower the enjoyment for me.  A movie like Aladdin seems  to do a better job presenting a west-friendly version of the culture,  rather than a parody thereof.
Having complained about that, however, I  have to say this is a thoroughly enjoyable movie.  Murphy's dragon  (forgetting the American slang) is highly entertaining, Mulan is a heroine  you want to cheer for, and the supporting characters are lovable.  The  villian is a little flat (especially when compared with my favourites,  Gaston and Jafar), but he is certainly menacing.  Maybe a bit too menacing  for really small children - this movie seems little intense for the really  young kids.
The extras are not impressive, since they had to cram both  the letterbox and P&S on the same disc.  Why they do this is beyond me  - just dispense with the P&S and give me more extras!",961113600,2,1226,4.798076923076923

Mulan is a comedy.  Sure, it's the  tale of a girl in search of herself, but her sidekicks (Mu Shu and Krikee)  steal the show.  And the sidekicks are only on the screen to be funny.  Don't get me wrong, they are funny!  I constantly recite Mu Shu's lines...
 But...
 The plot of Mulan was a bit too predictable.
The  animation quality is excellent and the sound (on DVD) is THX... meaning  it's the BEST.  But this isn't enough  to make a great film.

It has everything for a good family  movie--a strong story, fantastic characters, heart, and a strong hero or  heroine.  The songs aren't anything to praise, but a few are rather nice.  The humor is also great, even though it's not of Aladdin calibur.  The  modern Disney formula is still there, like Mushu's western voice and  behavior, but Mulan still provides great fun for all.

998578,5,6305229449,"Mulan is one of the most funny and moving movies I have everseen.
Mulan is a young, beautiful Chinese girl who is of amarriagable age.  But her only problem is that she's too much of a tomboy to please the matchmaker, and she despairs of ever bringing honor to her family.
When Mulan bravely goes into the army to fight the Huns in her aging father's place, she is protected by a bumbling-fumbling guardian dragon, Mushu...
This movie has got to be the best one that Disney has ever made, aside from Toy Story 2.  There is a wonderful moral lesson in this movie, and is extremely enjoyable at any age.  The entire movie is filled with witty and funny lines, like when Mushu says to Mulan ""You're da man!  Well, sort of"" and ""Here's your breakfast.  (Here Mushu shows Mulan a bowl of porridge with eggs and bacon for a face) And it's happy to see ya!"" If you're looking for a laugh, a cry and a just plain good movie, rent or buy Mulan now.

Reflection was an  all-right song, but not memorable nor something I want to hear again.
The animation is stunning, but eye-candy can't replace characterization  and plot.",957484800,2,454,4.69620253164557
998580,4,6305229449,"Disney's Mulan tells the story of Fa Mulan (Ming Na Wen from the live action Street Fighter), a young Chinese woman who cannot bear the thought of her lame father going off to fight Huns, and so she impersonates Fa Zu's  non-existent son, Ping. The film opens with a breathtaking view of China's  Great Wall, built especially to keep the Huns at bay, but the builders  never foresaw  the development of the grappling hook. It is here me meet  Shan Yu, the Hun leader, and like a lot of Disney villains, he is  frighteningly competent and evil. And when he faces down a frightened  Imperial soldier who has managed to light a signal fire that alerts  positions up and down the wall then defiantly states, ""...now all of China  knows you are coming!""  Shan Yu is delighted!
 As the Huns approach,  Mulan is being paraded before the matchmaker-the woman who will find a  husband for her. Mulan's eagerness to succeed turns to disaster and she  humiliates her father, then again when the Imperial Army arrives looking  for conscripts, she demands that her father has already served. Her father  proudly exclaims that he will serve much to Mulan's grief-the scene is one  of the most memorable in the film. That night she sneaks out of her room  and dawns her Fa Zu's armor before cutting her hair. Stealing away into the  night, she exchanges the conscript notice with her hair comb then rides off  to join the Imperial Army.
 Mulan as Ping begins to suffer, mostly  because of the advice of Mushu (Eddie Murphy) -a little red dragon and  former temple guardian of the family shrine. She desperately tries to fit  in with the burly bunch of recruits and ""be a man"" under the watchful eye  of Captain Li Shang-who believes that `Ping' is ""unsuited for the rage of  war."", which forces Mulan to try even harder and in the process convinces  her fellow recruits to succeed until they complete basic training.
  Two of the more memorable scenes include the discovery of the devastated  village and the body of Li Shang's father-a memorable moment on a knoll  where Captain Shang mounts his father's helmet atop his sword. The second  is the spectacular battle sequence on a snowy mountain top. The CGI  sequence of thousands of Huns storming over the rise on horse back has the  same awesome feel as the stampeding wildebeests in Lion King.
 Mulan  scores big with us older folks and must admit my own ignorance in this,  because I have never read the original story and so do not know what Disney  has changed it. The songs, most notably ""I'll Make a Man out of You"" and  ""True to Your Heart"" are upbeat and fun. The animation is excellent while  the character art takes a little getting used to, similarly as the art in  Hercules. The signature CGI are pieces are subtle and as the technology  improves are meshed even more seamlessly with the traditional animation  methods. The voice acting is up to the usual Disney standards and I only  wish that those companies producing English translations for Japanese anime  would take a cue from Disney and hire real actors to do character voices.  Of course, that doesn't mean I forgive Disney for getting Phil Hartman to  do the voice of Jiji the cat in Kiki's Delivery Service.",957398400,,3218,4.664285714285715
998661,4,6305229449,"Disney's Mulan is a solid, well-crafted film.
The animation is engaging; the new crew created a unique style and some truly breathstealing cinematic sequences (The horde of Huns rivals the wildebeest stampede from  Lion King).
However, the Disney musical format doesn't quite fly in  Mulan.  The numbers don't contribute anything to the otherwise epic Eastern  feel of the film (the best song is sung by... Donny Osmond?).  On the other  hand, I had expected to be thoroughly annoyed by Disney's penchant for  cutesy sidekicks, but found myself instead pleasantly amused and  entertained by Eddie Murphy's dragon character and his cricket  chum.
Beyond these small quibbles, what makes Mulan a  ""purchase"" film for me, is the strength of the characters and the  story told through them.  Aside from Belle, Mulan is the only Disney  heroine to fully hold her own without dependence on a ""Prince  Charming"".  Courage is the mainstay of all the protagonists in Mulan.  And the Hun villain was impressively wicked.

Mulan was the first film in a while that wasn't centered  around a female lead striving for the affections of a man.  She was a  strong young woman who was protecting the health, safety and honor of her  father and her family.

998901,5,6305229449,"I work for Disney. That's that out of the way. I have to say that, though I did NOT contribute towards the making, I'm very proud of 'Mulan'. Like everyone else here, I am also capable of constructive criticism. I thought  the characters, music and the design were superb. It was a little  unfortunate that Mulan's speaking voice had to sound so all-American white  bread, despite the Chinese-American voice actress, in contrast to the  noble, gentle, more authentic voice of her father. It is also great to see  them beginning to break away from the 'musical' format, further  demonstrated by the use of music in Tarzan. People seem very divided on  whether Disney should stay 'Disney' - all clean fun, albeit very dull  sometimes, family entertainment; or to strive to create films that have  much wider, more sophisticated appeal. I am definitely for the latter  scenario. Disney has the best artists in the industry..and it's great to  see their material starting to reflect a more sophisticated, intelligent  audience. And what are these 'adult' jokes people keep mentioning...seems  like some people have a rather wafer-thin sense of humour.",939859200,,1147,5.06951871657754
998902,4,6305229449,"Perhaps Disney has finally BEGUN to drag itself out of the dark ages of portraying their female film characters as weak, flawlessly beautiful young ""princesses"" who swoon and wait for Prince Charming to come save  the day.
I am sick of having the old ""females are weak and only good  for one thing"" stereotype crammed down my throat by the film industry.  Especially the children's film industry.
This is the story of a young  woman who unintentionally but through necessity faces prejudice and danger  head on, and wins.
Like many of us young women, Mulan feels false and out  of place when trying to be graceful, beautiful, and obedient in order to  attract a husband, and her high-strung spirit obviously makes her  ill-suited for the traditional domestic role that society demands her to  fill.
She is a gentle and sensitive person who respects her parent's  wishes, but, though she tries hard, is unable to properly fulfill her duty  to bring ""honor"" to her family by attracting a prosperous  husband. She becomes depressed and feels ""useless"".
When War  suddenly breaks out, each family is  called upon to send a male family  member to join the army and help protect the Emperor and China from the  attacking Huns.  The only available male member of Mulan's family is her  father, a former military man, but due to an old injury he walks with a  cane and obviously won't stand a chance in battle.
Mulan cannot accept  the possible loss of her beloved father, so secretly steals his orders,  cuts her hair, dons his old armor, and rides away in the night to take his  place in the Chinese army, disguised as a boy.
Beautiful landscapes and  detail of traditional Chinese armor and clothing, several humorous  situations [though Disney really should decide whether they are making a  family movie or an adult one. None of the comments were really damaging,  but many of the innuendos and jokes were really unsuitable for young  children! What's the matter Disney, trying to creep in on South Park's  market? What's the matter with you?!!!!].
Though the ""Asian""  art style is different than Disney's norm, the realisticly flowing movement  that is Disney's signature is still there.  The scene where the TIDALWAVE  of mounted Huns pours down the entire hillside toward the  ""camera"" in one battle is AWESOME and rivals similar battle  scenes in BRAVEHEART and HEAVEN AND EARTH [Japanese]. Many other Mulan  scenes are equally exciting, but this is the one that most comes to my  mind.
Wonderful ""cinematography"", and great use of scenary  colors to convey different moods. Not TOO much singing, but enough to make  it ""Disney"".
Though the story slows down a little in the  middle, it's an exciting adventure, with a wide range of  ""colorful"" supporting characters [including the strong and  extremely handsome young man who ends up falling in love with her, for  those ""hopeless romantics"" out there], and a real mean [but not  TOO mean] bad guy.
My husband and I really enjoyed it and are purchasing  the DVD for our ""future"" children.
All in all, MY favorite  Disney movie.",939254400,6,3078,4.868471953578337
999170,2,6305229449,"Below is a copy of my email to Disney......
Dear Disney,  I am  writing to you, in response to your movie, ""Mulan"".  After  hearing how wonderful the movie is by several friends and co-workers, I  decided to purchase it, and watch it.  Prior to watching Mulan, I have  always loved  all of the movies Disney has released in the past,  many were  unforgetable, and very well writen, both loved by adults and children as  well, with very well researched and written scripts to always have a  meaning to both adults and children.  After watching Mulan, I was very  disappointed with the directors, and disappointed to find out that the  directors, Tony Bancroft and Barry Cook,  had no direction at all as to  what ""chinese"" and ""japanese"" are, and did not care  enough to even research just a little bit before releasing such a movie, to  be seen by millions. I am almost positive that they had at least eaten at a  chinese and japanese restaurant for that matter, and should find that the  foods taste quite different, and that the language and culture also very  different.  I have to say being chinese myself, having been born in  Hong Kong, yet raised in San Francisco since I was 2 years old, I consider  myself to be a native San Franicscan.  Although, I was fortunate enough to  have been able to learn the language and my culture from my parents, I use  to be ashamed of the fact that I was able to speak and understand chinese,  for all my friends were not, and I did not want to be laughed at or assumed  to be different than everyone else.  After growing up, and having children  of my own, did I appreciate the fact that I was chinese/american and have  always been so ever since.  I try to instill what I believe in my children,  and hope that one day they too will be proud to be chinese and would like  to learn more of their history as they grow up.  My children are 13 and 11,  both boys, and I was proud of the fact that they were able to clearly see  the wrong interpretations of chinese culture that you displayed in your  movie.  By the way I am only 32, and have never really cared enough about  the chinese culture to take a stand, for even in school, everyone is busy  learning about the history of the United States, I was hoping others would  also see what my friends and I saw.  After reading the reviews from  Amazon.com from many viewers whom also saw the movie, I was quite apalled  that some of them were chinese also, and yet couldn't tell the difference.  I took it as an  insult to me and my family, almost mocking the chinese  people that they are ignorant and wouldn'g know the difference, while  actually  Disney was ignorant to release such a movie. I am sorry to say,  that in the San Francisco Bay Area, the chinese people are not the minority  here, but quite the oposite.  We are now a growing poopulation, and  considered almost the majority, you will see it in the politicians, head  executives, children ratios in school, city hall, and especially in silicon  valley.  You should be more aware of your surroundings, for I would not be  surprised to find that one day, maybe someone of the chinese descent might  very well run Disney.  I apppoligize for the harshness in my writing,  but I must say that the clearly mistaken difference between chinese and  japanese, are vividly apparent in your picture, although the story was  wonderful and touching, I believe Disney must have been mislead by someone  on the staff as to the culture of the chinese people.  I am sorry, but  there is a big difference, not to mention, Japan and China are still  thousands of miles away from each other to the best of my knowledge, and  the language clearly different, and the clothing worn and ways of life also  different, not to mention that chinese names and japanese names are clearly  different.  As you probably could guess  what I am getting at,  the movie  Mulan was suppose to be about China, and not Japan.  Although, all the  names were chinese, and the language spoken was chinese, that was ALL that  was chinese.  The wardrobe, the way of dress, (clearly japanese), the  sitting down and drinking tea on the floor, (clearly japanese culture), and  even the flags chosen must have been a hit and miss.  Unfortunately for  you, it was a miss, the director did not even notice that that was not the  china flag. Ironically, the movie is about honor is it not?  Please  forgive me, but after seeing the movie, I hope that more chinese people  would feel as strongly as I do, for chinese people feel strongly about  respect, respect for others as well as elders.  I myself and many others  have respect for the United States as being a melting pot, and have  respected the american way of living, and caring enough to learn the  English language and culture of many different nationalities, for that is  what makes the people special for being different in their own ways as  individuals and as a whole. A good example is that I have owned japanese,  american and german cars, although I am not ignorant to the fact they they  are made in Japan, America and Germany, every one of them different in  their own ways. I am sure when you got your cars, you got what you expected  and hopefully made where they said they were made, and not just an emblem  put on a different car.  I am very proud to be chinese american, and  very proud to be living in the United States, but you must not deny me of  my passionate feelings for my culture. I was always taught to respect  others.  I would very much like a response to my email, or at the least  the acknowledgement that my email was at least received and read, and maybe  to hear what the comments of others are.  I would be very curious to see if  it makes any sense at all to Disney, that maybe next time they should be a  little more caring and take a little more pride in their work, so as not to  be put in an embarassing situation again",924220800,13,5922,4.43177570093458

Mulan is not authentically Chinese, just as animation done in  China featuring Americans is not strictly American. Each society has inside  jokes that other societies do not share. The eggs-and-bacon smiley face in  Mulan's breakfast was an American joke, a child's breakfast for a warrior.  The family name for Mulan - ""Fa"" - might not be perfect, but give  credit where it is due, she was not reffered to as ""Mulan Fa"".  Mushu reffering to Khan as ""Bessie"" is obviously an Anglo-Saxon  cow joke, which is brilliantly executed by Eddie Murphy.

999312,5,6305229449,"This movie is about honor and self respect.  It is perhaps the most adult movie I have seen in years.  All the characters behaved believably. (except for the Dragon and the Cricket, and that is outside of the relm of human  behavior anyway)  The movie treated a different culture with respect and  treated the issues faced by the characters with honesty.
Even in the  realm of violence this movie was adult in behavior, without going  overboard.  The death of the guards on the wall, the death of the scout,  the fate of the village and fate of most of the horde were not wallowed in,  nor were they glossed over.
In the relm of sex, this was also a very  adult movie.  Again, there was the lack of juvinile tittering, and a direct  and honest view of both attraction and the usual fate of a chinese  girl.
Mulan is a movie you can enjoy at every level.  It is intellectully  exciting as well as plain entertainment.  Mulan is about love, honor and  integrety.  The movie understands its own message.",920073600,,1000,4.4860335195530725

It truly outshines some, like the  poorly-depicted Hercules, and just makes you want to smile, cry, laugh or  sing along with the characters. I give this movie a million thumbs up!

999464,4,6305229449,"Or would have lurched out, had they devoted any media muscle to this film.  Instead, Disney chose to pull their punches and hope to recoup their money on video.  Had they pushed or hyped this film in any way--more people would  have seen this incredible film.
I was lucky enough to see it at the  Uptown theater, the second largest theater on the east coast.  Having seen  the video, I'm somewhat disappointed with the pan and scan job.  Watching  it on a television, it just didn't have the same effect.  Two  examples--when the Huns charge down a mountain on horseback, and when  everyone in the Imperial city bows.  I wasn't filled with awe nor fear,  rather I was filled with disappointment.  I had seen and felt those two  scenes in the theater, but on the video, they come across rather  unimpressive.  If Disney  ever releases a wide screen edition of this  movie, I'll change my review to five stars.
The voice acting is  excellent, as is the screenplay.  Ming Na Wen and Lea Salonga do an  excellent job as Mulan, with Eddie Murphy providing plenty of comic  relief.
The art and the animation style shows that Disney is not limited  to cookie cutter releases like Pocahontas and Hunchback.
Oh, and  finally, a Disney movie where the heroine doesn't end up  kissing/dating/marrying the 'hero.'  That was getting tiring.  That alone  gives this movie an additional 1/2 star.

The money I spent on Mulan is the best investment I've made in several years.  The music is  strong and beautifully done. The characters while drawn in a simple and  graceful style are detailed and very memorable.  The voice talents were  impressive, but it is the caliber of the co-starring and bit player parts  that impressed me the most.  James Shigeta as Shang's father, Pat Morita as  the emperor, and George Takei as the first ancestor were as entertaining  for me as Mulan and Mushu themselves.

It was great, a fantastic story,  it's a movie I can watch again and again.  I will definately be buying the  video.
I loved the strong female character, the fact that she used her  mind as well as the fighting skills she learned was great.  Disney did a  good job with Mulan by giving us a movie that adults and children both can  watch and love.  I can only hope they can repeat that quality in their next  effort.
