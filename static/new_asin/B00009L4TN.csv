7991298,4,B00009L4TN,"During the mid-to-late-90's, producer Roger Corman shot several haunted house horror films in Ireland (He set up a studio in Galway, Ireland and shot several dozen films of all genres from 1996 to 2002, which can be seen in the Irish documentary IT CAME FROM CONNEMARA!! [2014], something I advise you should search for), including SPECTRE (1996), THE DOORWAY (2000), and KNOCKING ON DEATH'S DOOR (1998), which director/co-writer Mitch Marcus (A BOY CALLED HATE - 1995; BOLTNECK - 2000) shot back-to-back with this film, a short, but not-so-sweet, supernatural tale based on the Henry James short story ""The Ghostly Rental"" (the film's shooting title). The film opens up in 1800's Boston, where James Farrow (Andrew Bowen; BIG BAD WOLF - 2006) and his secret girlfriend Sarah (Aideen O'Donnell) find what they think is an abandoned mansion and make love. A couple of months later, Sarah discovers she is pregnant, so artist college student James convinces her to get an illegal abortion, otherwise he will have to drop out of school. He takes her to a sleazy back alley abortionist/doctor, where something goes wrong and James is forced to take Sarah to a motel room above a bar, while she slowly bleeds to death. He leaves the room, telling her he will be right back and will get her help, but the callous James leaves her there while he goes back to his normal business. He catches a case of the guilts and goes back to the motel, only to discover the police carrying her bloody corpse away and put it on a cart. For some reason, James decides to go back to the mansion where he got Sarah pregnant, only to see a ghostly Sarah staring back at him through a window. He is also nearly trampled to death by a horse ridden by the sickly Professor Ambrose (Michael York, with huge muttonchops), who is racing away from the mansion at a high rate of speed. Professor Ambrose teaches at the same low-class college that James goes to and has an obsession with death (it all has to do with something that happened in his past). James is somehow drawn to that mansion, where he passes out on the porch and has a strange dream of a naked, bleeding Sarah lying on the floor while the room fills up with a geyser of blood (most of the bloody visions are taken from the cost-cutting Corman's THE HAUNTING OF MORELLA [1990], which wouldn't be a problem if there wasn't a trailer for that film on this DVD and it shows some of the same images we see in this film!), only to be chased away by a cane-swinging Professor Ambrose, who says that this is his house. The police are investigating the death of Sarah and the lead Inspector on the case, Lt. Ryan (Mike Finn), checks out the room Sarah died in and comments, ""We are looking for a man with dirty fingernails."" Meanwhile, James' bloody nightmares are now manifesting themselves in the real world, as he wakes up from a nightmare with bloody scratches on his stomach. James watches Sarah's funeral from afar (where he has another strange waking nightmare), where he notices a sickly-looking Professor Ambrose sitting in the graveyard. James tells Professor Ambrose that he is being haunted by the spirit of a dead woman and he believes the Professor is experiencing something similar, too. Professor Ambrose tells James to meet him at his study tomorrow night and not to breathe a word about it to anyone (rumors from some of James' college friends believe Professor Ambrose left teaching at the exclusive Harvard University and took a low-paying job at their meager college because he murdered someone in his past). At the study, Professor Ambrose tells James at one time he was married and he and his wife had a happy life in the mansion that James is drawn to. His wife got pregnant and died at childbirth, leaving the Professor to take care of his daughter on his own. He and his daughter made a pact with each other to look out for one another for all time. Years pass and Professor Ambrose comes home early after giving a lecture at Harvard, finding his daughter Lucy (Claudia Christian; THE HIDDEN - 1987) kissing and getting ready to make love to a man the Professor never met before. When Lucy tells her father that they are going to get married, Professor Ambrose reminds Lucy of the pact they made and tells her intended husband that if he ever sees him again, he will destroy the man's reputation (and, back then, he had the power to do so). He also tells Lucy that she is dead to him now and storms out of the mansion. A few weeks later, Professor Ambrose comes to his senses and returns to the mansion, only to find a note written by the intended husband saying that Lucy slipped into a coma and died. From that day on, Professor Ambrose became a broken man. He also became a haunted one, too. Lt. Ryan is getting closer to the truth in Sarah's death and James increasingly sees the ghostly Sarah as she creepily asks him to join her in the Netherworld. Professor Ambrose tells James in the cemetery that one night while he was sleeping at the mansion, he was awoken by something or someone scratching at his bedroom door. Just as he puts the chain on the door, a female hand comes thrusting through the opening. The apparition of Lucy appears that same night and tries to strangle Professor Ambrose while he sleeps, so he decides to sell the mansion. Every time a potential buyer comes to look at the mansion, the spirit of Lucy scares them away. One night, Lucy's ghost appears to her father and tells him to leave the house to her. She will be the tenant and gives him a bag of coins. There was one condition attached: Professor Ambrose must return to the mansion every week to pick up the rent and drink a glass of wine (something he refused to do when Lucy announced she was getting married). Professor Ambrose tells James that none of the coins are dated later than his daughter's death. He survives on this ghostly rental (the job at the college pays but a mere pittance), but the line between dream and reality have eroded for him (he also seems to get sicker by the day and coughs a lot). James wants to go with Professor Ambrose on his next rent pickup, but the Professor refuses and tells him to go out and live his life (James has never told Ambrose that he was responsible for Sarah's death). Professor Ambrose leaves the cemetery, telling James not to follow him, but James sees Sarah's ghost (there is blood coming out of her eyes and mouth) and decides that he must break his promise to the Professor, if not only for him to keep his sanity. Lt. Ryan finds the back alley abortionist and arrests him, but he is able to point out James walking down the street as the person who brought Sarah to him and a footchase commences. James and an officer tussle, but James gets away, losing his sketchpad in the process. James hides-out at friend Fletcher's (Jason Cottle) house, but the nightmares won't stop, as Sarah keeps haunting him (this time he sees her stab him in the back and we get a fleeting glimpse of James' innards spilling out his stomach). Lt. Ryan is able to locate Professor Ambrose (who is now at the point of death) through the drawings in James' sketchpad, which leads Lt. Ryan to Fletcher's house. James is able to escape through a window and a severely ill Ambrose picks up James off the streets and brings him to his home. A dying Ambrose tells James that finally telling his story to someone has released him of his otherworldly torments and he will now die in peace. James believes the only way to redeem himself is to go to the mansion and give himself to Sarah, but once he gets to the mansion, what he discovers is nothing he expected. It seems that Lucy was never dead. She was tormenting her father for breaking up her wedding and was slowly poisoning him with small doses of arsenic in the glasses of wine he was drinking every week when he picked up the rent. James drinks the glass of wine (Lucy tells him that this was to be the final glass of wine for her father, as she added a lethal dose of arsenic in it) and is the captured by the police and thrown in prison. It what turns out to be the film's most ironic scene, the back alley abortionist is his next cellmate and volunteers to look at a very ill James. The abortionist tells Lt. Ryan that James will have to wait for the poison to leave his system because to induce vomiting will kill him (he then has a hearty laugh at James' expense). Lucy goes to visit her father at his home, only to discover he has died. As Lucy is sitting on the stairs of the mansion (the very same place James and Sarah made love in the beginning of the film), she hears her father's ghostly voice and the mansion explodes (Talk about retribution!). James (who has black gunk dribbling out of his mouth) dies in his straw-strewn prison cell, his last words being ""Forgive me."", as the abortionist wails away in the next cell. It seems that sometimes being alive is much worse than death itself (but don't tell Catholics that!).  This is a tidy little supernatural tale that does manage to send some shivers up and down your spine. Michael York (THE OMEGA CODE - 1999) is fantastic as the tortured soul who believes that he is being haunted from beyond the grave when, in fact, it is simply an act of living revenge. I believe it is some of the best acting he has done in any film he has appeared in. I can honestly say I wasn't surprised by the ending because the death of Lucy is tossed off as an aside and we never see her body or funeral, just the letter Professor Ambrose finds on the fireplace mantle. This is one of two of Roger Corman's Ireland-filmed movies to take place in the United States because Mitch Marcus finished the last film early, so Marcus and co-screenwriter Lev L. Spiro (using the pseudonym ""L.L. Shapira"", who wrote the screenplay to Corman's non-supernatural Ireland-lensed THE GAME OF DEATH [2000], an adaptation of Robert Lewis Stevenson's ""The Suicide Club"", who also directed the rather gory sci-fi comedy WELCOME TO PLANET EARTH [1997] and plenty of A-List TV series) whipped up a quick script and filmed this one in less than two weeks (using much of the gore and nudity shots from previous Corman films, like the one I mentioned above). Like the other three previously-mentioned made-in-Ireland haunted house films, these are rather good Corman productions and better than most of Corman's output during that time (All four films use the same mansion in County Galway, Ireland). It could be because of the beautiful Irish scenery (this is the only one of the four that is a period film), but it is Michael York that makes this film worth watching. THE HAUNTING OF HELL HOUSE is only available on DVD in fullscreen, so some company like Code Red should pick-up all of Corman's Ireland films and release them in widescreen. They are all well-made films that would benefit even more if they were shown in their original aspect ratio. They may be B-Films, but they are highly enjoyable and good for a few scares. Also starring Brian Glanney, Ciaran Davies, Colm Lydon, Daniel Rosen, Fred McCluskey, Maeve O'Regan and director Marcus as a Professor towards the end of the film. A New Concorde VHS & DVD Release. Rated R.",1442793600,2,11180,4.553899652260308
7991299,2,B00009L4TN,"Ive watched this movie five times since I got it on DVD, and I still don't know what its about. Now, youd think a horror movie called The Haunting of Hell House would center on a haunted house, but this movie doesnt focus on any one person or location like a good haunted house movie would. Based on a story by playwright Henry James, the movie stars actor Andrew Bowen as New England college student James Farrow whose wife, maybe girlfriend, dies due to a botched abortion, and he begins to see her in dreams and hallucinations. He is soon drawn to the empty house they once explored in their youth, but now, it turns out that it belongs to a Professor Ambrose, played by the talented Michael York from the British stage. Farrow pursues Yorks help to rid himself of the ghost he believes is haunting him and scratching him up, but whether its in his mind or just his guilt is never explained. Meanwhile, Ambrose is similarly being haunted by the ghost of his dead wife who refuses to let him sell the house. Neither man believes the ghost of the other one exists. Meanwhile, Farrow is being hunted by the police for his dead girlfriend found in his apartment. He escapes to Ambrose for protection, but the old man is dying and cant help him. Farrow flees to the house to ask for forgiveness from his girlfriends ghost, but discovers Ambroses ghost isn't real after all. It turns out hes being systemically poisoned by his angry daughter and Farrow drinks the poisoned wine from her for her father to be with his bride. In the end, Farrow dies in jail next to the phony doctor who botched his girlfriends abortion. Is this a good movie? Uh, no. Its long, it drags on, its confusing and the name of the movie is misleading. This is not a haunted house movie. This isn't even a horror movie, and trying to make it look like one may be its worse trait. However, it does have some beautiful scenery for what I speculate is supposed to be Turn-of-the-Century New England. Overall, its not exactly a movie that can live up to the hype of its name.",1439769600,,2042,4.448
7991300,3,B00009L4TN,"A young college student named James gets his girlfriend Sarah pregnant. Fearing the loss of his reputation, he takes her to a ""doctor"" specializing in quick, back-alley abortions. Unsurprisingly, the woman dies from the slip-shod procedure. James is soon haunted by bloody nightmares, as well as Sarah's ghostly appearances. Meanwhile, the mysterious Professor Ambrose (Michael York) arrives on campus. Ambrose lives in the HELL HOUSE of the title. James' bad dreams continue, becoming increasingly violent and disturbing. Is he cursed by the undead Sarah, or is he simply losing his mind? THE HAUNTING OF HELL HOUSE (not to be confused w/ THE LEGEND OF HELL HOUSE) is a tale of remorse spiraling into obsessive guilt, flavored w/ psychological / supernatural visitations. Slow-paced, even plodding in spots, THOHH still holds a certain dark charm. Loosely based on a story by Henry James. Watch for Claudia Christian (THE HIDDEN, TV's BABYLON 5) as Ambrose's daughter, Lucy...",1386979200,2,977,5.35064935064935
7991301,2,B00009L4TN,"I am a Michael York fan and so decided to try out this movie.  Michael York and to be honest the other actors did a commendable job.  But the story/script was just very weak, no scary parts to speak of.  Pretty much a waste of time to watch it at all.  If I made lists on worst attempts at a ghost story this would be on it",1334707200,2,323,3.7761194029850746
7991302,3,B00009L4TN,"I stumbled onto this movie by accident.  I thought it was a remake of The Legend of Hell House - apparently my brain melded Shirley Jackson's The Haunting of Hill House with the Richard Matheson's The Legend of Hell House.  After getting it home and reading the back of the box, I quickly realized that was not the case.  I went ahead and watched anyway, and I wasn't disappointed.  It turned out to be a pretty entertaining ghost story with a bit of a gothic feel.  It kind of reminded me of some of the Hammer Horror movies I watched on TV when I was a kid.  The acting wasn't the best out there - Michael York was a bit hammy - but it didn't detract from the overall enjoyment of the movie.  The set pieces and look of the movie set a very nice moody tone that kept you in the period, and there were no cars passing by in the distance or actors wearing digital watches as far as I saw.  It was definitely no masterpiece by any stretch, but it did keep me from getting bored, and I never once looked at my DVD player's readout to see how much longer it would be until the movie ended.",1233187200,5,1086,4.113744075829384
7991303,1,B00009L4TN,"Save your money if you're looking for a good haunted house flick. This isn't even a bad haunted house movie... it's just a bad movie. I was bored 15 minutes in, and it never got any better. First of all, the direction is poor, as is the cinematography... it looks poorly done and cheap... there's a story, if you stay awake to follow it. It sure doesn't move quickly. If you're looking to be creeped out, stay away. If you're watching because your class is reading the story... well then tell your teacher that the class should read a more interesting Henry James story.",1129507200,,570,4.490384615384615
7991304,3,B00009L4TN,"Since I'm only really familiar with Henry James' TURN OF THE SCREW, which reached the screen in 1961 as THE INNOCENTS with Deobrah Kerr ( a marvelous film), I wasn't sure what James intention was in this confusing, though interesting, film.  It opens with Michael York (looking like a disheveled Ebenezer Scrooge) going to an old house and drinking a glass of wine.  Okay...next, we meet a young couple who go to the same house, make out on the steps and then the girl tells her lover she is pregnant.  Andrew Bowen as the young man is viscerally compelling and gives a performance that is not usually found in this type of movie.  Aideen O'Donnell as the girl is likewise beautifully effective in a small role.  Of course, the boy is worried about his parents' opinion of this common girl, so he arranges an abortion for her.  The abortionist is not even a doctor, doesn't use any kind of anethsetic, except Laudanum, and of course, once the abortion is performed, young Sarah is not in good shape.  John takes her to her room, and promises her he will be back with help.  However, he doesn't, and she dies.  That leads him into a nightmarish guilt trip, punctuated by ghostly visions, which leads him to consult York, who has been accused of killing his daughter (Claudia Christian).
From there on, it turns into a chase the suspected murderer, and an ending that is quite inexplicable.
In essence, this is a movie about guilt, and what it can do to you.  There is more terror in the souls of these two men than in any Hell House.",1075161600,16,1532,4.538181818181818
