7456060,2,B01648ETWQ,"I've watched from day one and have seen every episode.  Movie was typical of the last few seasons of the series rather than the series at its height and its best - despite Grissom's much anticipated return.  Crime investigation was perfunctory. Movie played out more like a soap opera focusing on the relationship between Grissom, Sara and Lady Heather. Old favorites returned (Brass, Catherine) for little more than cameos. The rest of the cast was pretty absent as well. Ending was probably satisfactory for some. Disappointing and unfulfilling for many others, including myself. All in all, it felt rushed and the story like a kick in the teeth. (Some of you know what I mean).

But even an unsatisfactory closure is more than some series get. Although I didn't like it, I appreciate the effort of writers and the cast to give us something.",1446595200,6,843,4.840277777777778

7456067,5,B01648ETWQ,I normally don't review things for the basic reason that I expect certain quality standards on anything I purchase.  This set is packaged well.  I haven't found the problems other reviews have stated.  What I love most about this set is the space saving design.  For 15 plus a season finale - this set would have normally taken up an entire shelf.  This set holds the dvds well AND has a very small form factor.,1528502400,,411,4.426666666666667

7456076,1,B01648ETWQ,This is the second time I have purchased this Series. I replaced the first one because season 10 disc 5 was in place of season 8 disc 5. The second was the same way! There is no way this should be Amazon approved!!! Very disappointing.,1523059200,,235,4.2444444444444445

Also, one of the cases has a broken piece on the inside. Not crucially important but still unfortunate.",1515628800,,321,4.631578947368421

7456092,1,B01648ETWQ,"It's been a while since I purchased this item. Finally got a chance to watch it tonight. I should say, I finally got a chance to open the package and place it in my player. The picture was fine, but even with sound turned up all the way, I could barely hear it.

Since it's been so long since I purchased it, I'll have to purchase another copy and take time to try to watch it to see if I can hear it. If I can't, at least this time I'll be able to return it.",1515542400,,459,3.78125
7456093,4,B01648ETWQ,"Season 1 is 4x3.  Others are 16x9.  The packaging is about as compact as can be for so many seasons but it does make it tricky to remove a disc without harm. After seeing some reviews about missing discs, I checked the whole package and all were present.  The shrink wrap looked like it had been opened. I think they may have checked the set after the reports of missing discs. The star deduction is only because they might have used a remastered season 1 for 16x9 and because of the difficulty in removing discs from the plastic enclosure.",1513987200,2,540,4.434343434343434
7456094,5,B01648ETWQ,"I have watched this as it aired on TV, but going back through the years with the team has been great.  When I bought this I took the chance the this set was complete, as it says so right on the box.  On the Amazon page it has the option where customers who have bought this usually buy season 14 and the final season.  This set includes all full seasons, 1-15, and season 16, the two part, two hour finale.  Adding this set to your collection is all you need to complete the series.  Well, you need to buy the short two season spin-off, CSI Cyber.  Not quite the same as the long running program, but I thought it would stick around longer than two years.",1513382400,17,655,4.158730158730159
7456095,5,B01648ETWQ,Great TV show.  We watched the first 13 seasons live but then dropped our cable for the past 4 and did not see the final 2.  We bought seasons 14 & 15 and then realized the final finale was on a separate video.  Glad we watched it.  Great ending to the series but not as good as the MASH finale.,1513123200,,295,3.8666666666666667
7456096,3,B01648ETWQ,"I had been looking for the complete series and was excited to see that this included the final season and the finale. I had read that a previous customer had received the set and received 2 season 10 disc 5 and no season 8 disc 5. I checked my disc as soon as the package arrived and have the same issue. I tried to report the issue, but the delivery contained several items and it would not let me report the problem. I tried to report the problem for the product page, but not sure they will respond.",1512864000,2,502,4.13265306122449
7456097,4,B01648ETWQ,when i got this in the mail i immediately opened it up to check all of the disc. long story short it had all of the disc except for season 8 disc 5. in its place was season 10 disc 5. what i did was put the disc 5 from season 8 from when the original season came out. the disc doesn't match the ones in this set but at least i have it. thank god it only had 2 episodes on it.,1512345600,4,375,3.5301204819277108

7456099,5,B01648ETWQ,"Holy smokes! Its one thing to have the complete series of a lesser known title or a show that only ran a few years on TV. But to think that the complete series of the first and original CSI is now available is mind boggling. For 15 seasons we were privy to the forensic stylings of the series that took place in Las Vegas. At times its hard to believe its off the air now, even more so since it still airs in reruns.

For those who somehow missed it during its 15 year run the series was about the crime scene investigation unit of the Las Vegas police department. This skilled team was led by Gil Grissom (William Peterson) who took a special interest in entomology. Grissom led a team that was the best of the best, tracking down killers and criminals by applying science and technology towards the goal of building enough evidence against them and to find them as well.

In talking to forensic scientists once the show was released you could learn (as I did) that a number of things they did on the show were done for that reason alone, because it was a show and not reality. But that didn't take away the thrill of learning some new way they used of discovering clues or doing things like reconstituting fingerprints that had been wiped away. There was a basis for the methods they used even if some of them haven't been applied. Yet. That potential always laid out there.

The show was so popular that it stayed in the top ten for years and spawned three side series as well, CSI MIAMI, CSI NEW YORK and CSI CYBER. None of those lasted near as long as the original but all did well on their own (with the exception of the last which was cut short). Each had their own specific look too. Watching these episodes the original seemed to use a lot of green and red color palettes. MIAMI always had oranges and yellows. NEW YORK a blue tinge. Only CYBER lacked its own color scheme.

What made the show work was that it covered more than just a weekly murder. Other crimes were committed as well. The CSI team always went in and scanned the crime scene looking for clues. Those clues would help when it came to booking the guilty party one most shows but they also helped in catching the crooks first.

Another thing that made the show stand out was that it was one of the first shows to truly start a TV family. These characters related to one another, cared about one another, helped one another and worked side by side without having to create a new romance of the week in it. That being said one romance did develop but it wasn't the highlight of the show.

This series also proved that you could carry on if you lost one of the main actors involved. Peterson left during the ninth season of the show and other actors were brought in to take over the department, including Lawrence Fishburne and Ted Danson. The same held true for various actors who chose to leave the show, replacing them with new ones capable of picking up where they left off. At the same time some of those characters were allowed to return to assist in future episodes which felt right as well.

I would love to say I watched each and every episode of this new packaging of the series but lets be serious. With 93 discs and 244 hours worth of material here the odds of that happening from the time it arrived here to my writing about it wasn't likely. I did pick a few to sample and the quality of the discs is fantastic. Shows that were interrupted by bad weather are now there for me to rediscover. And to use the term binge watching to relate to sitting through this entire series is an understatement.

Not only do you have the entire series on hand to enjoy there is a ton of extras as well. Plus the entire 2 hours series finale is included here, something I missed but can now enjoy just like you can. Having picked up the series each year as they were released I can tell you that this version and packaging takes up far less room on the shelf so collectors will be glad to take advantage of that. Its still a sizeable collection but not near as big as the space those 15 boxes take up.

The end results is that for a decent price and in a package that fits your shelf you can now own the entire series with little effort. Lost seasons won't need replaced as they're all here. As a fan of the show I can say without a doubt that this one is worth adding to your collection.",1511308800,3,4357,4.290754257907542

7456110,5,B01648ETWQ,"To start with  the service provided by the vendor through Amazon was superb - prompt, accurate and secure. The product was exactly as advertised - it was the two-hour special finale of the show after its 15 season run - my first try a different vendor sent me the right box with one disk from season 15 in it.

Virtually all of the series primary characters (including some favorite intermittent ones such as Lady Heather) put in appearances (the notable exception was George Eads' character Nick Stokes, who had gone off to San Diego to head up their Criminalistics lab a few episodes before). Many of their personal relationships and futures were untangled and aimed in encouraging directions. In all  an enjoyable reunion of the characters in celebration of a show that held our interest for fifteen years and long after.

The actual criminal activities and the investigation were rather routine - most of it had been done before (and frequently better) in past episodes [I sussed out the villain, method and the motive before the first hour was ended]. But what the hey? But it was mostly a frame for nostalgic character revisits, references to past events (one of the Casinos that gets bombed is now Catherine's), sly in-jokes (Hodges and Henry are still at it) and a final cast portrait before the show closed. I tuned in to see the whole creation all wrapped up with a pretty red ribbon and this did a pretty darn good job.",1495497600,6,1430,4.708

7456165,4,B01648ETWQ,"First off - loses a star because this should be included with the series - just another way to get extra money from people buying this series and it really irritates me.

***partial spoilers to follow***

Good conclusion of the last of CSI - bringing back Gil, Catherine, Lady Heather, Brass, etc...  Brought closure to some open questions from the end of the series along with bringing home one particular CSI that I honestly thought should have run the department and ending with her planning on leading the Crime Lab.  Sara and Gil finally dealing with what happened between them along with Lady Heather doing her own brand of help.  Lady Heather was my favorite character showing up occasionally on the series, and I wish she had shown up a lot more but bringing her back for this last episode was a cherry on top!!  Thanks for a great ride, this series will be sorely missed!!",1467676800,13,881,4.615384615384615

7456207,5,B01648ETWQ,"*When ordering this item, make certain the seller information (listed beneath pricing and ""In Stock."" status) reads ""Ships from and sold by Amazon.com."" Buying from a 3rd party seller is likely to result in receiving a copy with the correct ""CSI: The Finale"" packaging but wrong disc (CSI: Season 15, Disc 1 - Episodes 1501-1504) - see reviews from Dec. 2015 and early Jan. 2016. Amazon has corrected the problem in the copies they sell and ship.

As for the 2-hr finale special of CBS' crime drama CSI (in my opinion, the show that influenced the greater part of American television 2000 onward, for better or worse): Immortality Part I & 2 was a bittersweet farewell to the series I have watched for exactly half my lifespan. ***MILD SPOILERS AHEAD*** Grissom, Catherine and Capt. Brass return (how could you properly end this 15-year show without them?) to help solve a final case involving Lady Heather (see episodes 208, 315, 615, 723, 905 and 1119), but I am disappointed that George Eads (Nick Stokes, one of the only characters to stay with the show the entire 15-season run) wasn't part of it. But Catherine's daughter Lindsey returns in a surprise way and Grissom is able to pass on some further forensic crime solving wisdom to yet another generation. It was an odd mix of the 'Old CSI' with Gil Grissom & Catherine Willows, and the 'New CSI' with DB Russell & Morgan Brody, but characters from both regimes (Sara Sidle, Greg Sanders, Doc Robbins and ""Super Dave"" Phillips) helped to bring them together in a story that was fulfilling for me as a fan. A solid finish even if I never cared for the whole Grissom-Sara-Lady Heather off-and-on love triangle. In any event, if you claim to be a CSI fan of any calibre, you owe it to yourself to see the finale, even if you end up just feeling that twinge of regret over the passing of CSI...
