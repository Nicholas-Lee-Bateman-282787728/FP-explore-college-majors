8275424,5,B0019VWJL2,"In my last review of ""Super Robot Wars OG: Divine Wars"", I talked about how I wanted to see more character development because there were so many characters that were featured in episode 6 alone.

Fortunately, with this latest volume, we get just that plus the overall mecha action that we have enjoyed from this anime series so far.

In episode 9 titled ""Stage 09: Hagwane, Move out!"", preparations being to launch the Space Noah-Class all-purpose assault cruiser the Hagwane. Ryusei is reunited with his high school classmate Kusuha, now working aboard the Hagwane as an orderly.

Meanwhile, the Divine Crusaders launch an attack against the attack cruiser, the Hagwane and Rai finally confronts his brother, the DC mobile task force leader Elzam V. Branstein.

An exciting battle ensues between the Federation and the Divine Crusaders and all of a sudden, the mysterious pilot from episode 5 shows up from nowhere to assist the Federation.

In episode 10 titled ""Stage 10: The Elemental Lord of the Wind"", the Hagwane now heads south across the Pacific Ocean on their way to Divine Crusaders main heardquarters located in Aidoneus Island.

This time, the Personal Troopers go on the offensive against the Divine Crusaders but shocked to find out that they are facing the Barrelion, a new form of Armored Module and the Treue Unit, an experienced group of pilots from the United Colony.

Also, the mysterious pilot is revealed to be Ando Masaki, the operator of the Cyblaster, a form of humanoid mobile weaponry dubbed ""the Elemental Lord of the Wind"".

The Federation learns about Ando's goal of going after Divine Crusaders Commander-in-Chief Bian Zoldark and Shirakawa Shu, the pilot who initiated the war between the Divine Crusaders and the Federation.

While Ando is recuperating from battle, Shirakawa Shu and his super killer robot, the Granzon appears and Captain Minase (Captain of the Hagawane) must decide to fight the Granzon or retreat.

In episode 11 titled ""Stage 11: Masaki's Decision"", Ando must decide if he wants to help the Federation and help the Federation and crew of the Hagwane. Plissken makes a proposal to Ando for both sides to join forces to achieve their goals against the Divine Crusaders.

If there was one thing that took me by surprise was the humor in episode 11, as Kusuha's ""power drinks"" are introduced and to see how various characters react to it. Just to see Plissken drink her ""power drink"" was one of the most humorous segments I have seen in the series so far.

For a series that features a lot of battles and could be a bit complex, it was nice to see this humorous segment.

I have really been enjoying the the entire ""Super Robot Wars OG: Divine Wars"" series but I was a bit cautious to see how the director would handle all these characters that have been introduced so far.

This series has a lot of characters and although still managing to focus on the original three members, last volume focused on various teams and throughout the chaos of major mecha battles, I really enjoyed the last volume but wondered about the character development.

With episode 9-11, the storyline focuses on the crew of the Hagwane, newcomer Ando Masaki and of course, Ryusei as he has a new robot to learn.

Also, it was great to see Kusuha back but aside for being in the episodes for comedic value, I get a feeling that her part in this series will become more important.

Overall, things are now picking up in the series as the assault cruiser, the Hagwane now moves towards its destination to take on the Divine Crusaders main headquarters and encountering strong enemies along the way.

Another exciting volume in this series.",1218153600,,3665,4.8368
