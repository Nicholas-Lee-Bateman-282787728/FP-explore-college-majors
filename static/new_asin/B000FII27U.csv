8122999,4,B000FII27U,"I WAS MESMERIZED, ENCHANTED, THRILLED and teary with joy...the performances were astounding at any rate, but to be an octogenarian and still able to totally capture an audience in singing and playing.g the guitar magnificently for
more tan an hour is major showbiz savvy.
And the dance duo--SILVIO and ELISA-- were beyond extraordinary.  This was the music and song and dance of
SANTIAGO, CUBA. THIS MUSIC WAS MORE OF SPAIN with a coupon of Afro-Cuban.  Fun and enlightening.o",1391558400,,476,5.089743589743589

This might be your last chance to see the Afro-Cuban Legends because many of them are in their late seventies and eighties. Enjoy!,1390694400,,256,4.468085106382978

8123003,5,B000FII27U,"Aside from the fantastic music, what this video really brought home for me is how the US's totally misguided policies towards Cuba have hurt only the average Cuban and engendered widespread hatred towards the US government.  (Doesn't it seem that the US's policies towards ""rogue states"" always wind up hurting only the lower classes?)

These musicians put up with hardships that most Americans can't even imagine and still produced incredible music.",1170374400,7,450,5.323943661971831
