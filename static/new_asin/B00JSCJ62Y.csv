8653747,1,B00JSCJ62Y,"Please save your money.  This DVD is rambling and unfocused, and pays only lip service to Supinski's book (which itself  does not live up to it goal of providing a compelling explanation of trout behavior).  The DVD consists primarily of a bunch of fishing sequences that have very little instructional value, and the narration is at times contradictory, disjointed, or both.  This might have been useful if there were an editor involved in the production, but it's difficult to tell if one anyone had a sense of what information this DVD was supposed to convey or of whom its audience might be.  What passes, at the beginning of the DVD, for an explanation of trout behavior is reductive and not helpful.  It doesn't improve over its two-hour duration.",1421452800,2,753,4.84375
