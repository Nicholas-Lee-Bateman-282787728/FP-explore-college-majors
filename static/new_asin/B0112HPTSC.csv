7321983,5,B0112HPTSC,"Thank you Edify Media.
The When Calls the Heart Series on the Hallmark Channel is good, clean, wholesome entertainment for families. I'm so glad that the series is available on DVD. We dropped everything the first chance we got to watch this episode, ""Follow Your Heart"".

My Thoughts
I liked the fact that some of the situations saw some resolution after months of watching.
Jack and Elizabeth had a fight that reminded me of my husband and I once in awhile. If only they would listen to each other. If only we would listen to each other. ~sigh~
They set it all up for the next season. Ugh. What's next? I don't want to wait.
I continue to enjoy the series. There were a couple of developments that I really liked.
Keep the episodes coming!
From Emily, 18

Frustrating!
From Amy, 14
I liked it because it finally took a step forward.
It rekindled my excitement.
I can't wait for the next one!
All this to say...
We cannot wait for the next season.
It's frustrating. We want to know what happens!",1445212800,2,996,4.467032967032967

Recommend to others who've enjoyed the Christy series and Love Come Softly Series! You will definitely love these as well! Looking Forward to Season #3.......",1445126400,5,331,4.807017543859649
7321985,5,B0112HPTSC,"When Calls the Heart-Follow your Heart is the last episode of the second season and oh what a way to end it. Now Im just sitting on the edge of my seat waiting for the Christmas special and season three to start.
  So many exciting things happened in Follow your Heart. Of course we know Jack and Elizabeth had a big argument on the last episode and they aren't talking to much.
  Jack is still trying to get all of the people in the counterfeit ring, almost gets shot in this episode.
  Julie misses Tom and her family doesnt try to understand, they just want her to move on with  her life without Tom.
  Abigail and Pastor Frank and getting to be closer friends, but she finds out something that makes her rethink her ideas of him.
  To top all of that off Elizabeth accidentally lets Rip out of Jacks office during a thunderstorm and he runs away. So Jack and Elizabeth are off to find him in a cave and thats when love and disaster strikes.
  Love, love, love this series and this ending episode just has me wanting to see more and more. Highly recommended for the whole family. Very good viewing for all members of your household.

7321986,5,B0112HPTSC,"As Season 2 draws to a close, fans of the series, When Calls the Heart are waiting for resolution for our beloved couple of Jack Thornton and Elizabeth Thatcher who are now standing at the crossroad in their relationship. Returning home from Hamilton, the couple have had quite a few differences of opinions and the relationship remains strained. They will soon see that each time that one of them is faced with a life or death situation, like Jack's run in with the counterfeiters, they have to be honest with how they truly feel about one another. Will they realize that their hearts have always belonged to one another or for those they left behind in Hamilton.

Abigail is faced with trying to make Mr. Gowen's latest repairs otherwise she will have to shut down her cafe. The problem isn't the money but trying to get it done in time. Pastor Hogan offers to join in helping Abigail and Elizabeth in hopes of meeting the deadline. Unfortunately Bill Avery has returned to complicate things with his confessed feelings for her still and struggles to see her with someone like Frank Hogan. He hopes to speak with the man Jack arrested in hopes of discovering who is in charge of the counterfeiting ring against the orders of his superiors.

Rosemary has now relinquished her duties at the school now that Elizabeth has returned, even though she focused more on the children learning their parts for the Founder's Day play instead of their school work. However since she has rejected Lee Coulter's proposal to take their relationship to the next level, she now realizes how jealous she is when she see's that Lee has taken up courting one of the local widows. It makes her realize just how foolish she was but now she has to find a way to convey her true feelings for Lee without coming straight out and telling him so.  Elizabeth's sister Julie is still struggling in Hamilton with her feelings for Jack's brother Tom despite the fact that her family doesn't want her in a relationship with anyone less than what they desire for her.

The season concludes once more with a bit of a cliff-hanger ending and just when it looks like everything might just get resolved between our town's favorite couples, there will be a huge plot twist. For families truly looking for a series that the entire family can enjoy without the questionable content you find on television lately, you might just want to check out When Calls the Heart on the Hallmark Channel. This series is based on the novel by Janette Oke and producer Michael Landon Jr, this is a must see for everyone looking for an exceptional way to spend a family evening.

I received When Calls the Heart - Follow Your Heart compliments of Word Films and Edify Media Group for my honest review. I did not receive any monetary compensation, aside from a free copy of the DVD, and the opinions expressed here are strictly my own honest ones. For fans of Little House on the Prairie, now comes another exceptional series, I know you will LOVE. This series has even been Dove Family approved. The first two series are now available on DVD today for your enjoyment and I'd rate this one a 5 out of 5 stars. This DVD includes behind the scenes interviews with the cast and runs approximately 88 minutes.",1444953600,2,3249,4.643478260869565
7321987,5,B0112HPTSC,"My family has enjoyed very much this series inspired by Janette Oke's novel of the rugged Canadian frontier. From the exclusive behind the scenes interviews it appears the actors also feels the same and perhaps we might see more episodes in the future!

In these latest two episodes of When Calls The Heart we see a deeper relationship evolving between the honest and trustworthy Mountie and Elizabeth the city born teacher whilst both characters demonstrated their love and care for Hope Valley, the community they live in and its citizens.
Of course as in any relationship there are always some rocky moments...
And if some of the developments are a little predictable, it is easily forgiven as we find our favourites amongst the series. Let's not forget the great sceneries and beautiful costumes!

There is no denying the chemistry between both main characters is owed to a good script and the sterling reputation of its director!
When Calls The Heart series 1 and 2 reminds us of Little House On The Prairie, a timeless sitcom any family may sit down with and enjoy even today.
So When Calls The Heart continues in a tradition of good family entertainment with excellent values for young viewers to grow with at the opposite of Hollywood's often tasteless assaults on our senses!

This Hallmark series is well worth checking if you are looking for something to gather the family around and spend quality time!

5 Stars for both episodes!!
