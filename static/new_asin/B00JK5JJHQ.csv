8651665,5,B00JK5JJHQ,I love T.O.P so I had to get this. It's pretty awesome I would recommend it if you are a true fan. It can be pricy of you are on a budget like me lol but it's worth it.,1458259200,,168,3.3333333333333335
8651666,5,B00JK5JJHQ,"I love this book! When I first got it and started looking through the many, many, MANY pictures I was starting to feel that $90 was a little too much to pay for this. But once I watched the dvd that comes with it, that all changed. Hearing T.O.P talk about the reason he wanted to do this book and what it means to him, made it mean more to me. The dvd was fun to watch, especially all the raw footage of the actual photo shoots. The book itself is massive and very well made. It has a few odd pictures in it of a bunch of nothing, but all the wonderful pictures of T.O.P totally make up for it. My only complaint is that there are so many pics of him smoking. It's just hard for me to think about such a beautiful man smelling of nasty cigarette smoke. lol There is also a very large poster and 5 postcards included in the box. So all in all, it's a fantastic keepsake for any big T.O.P fan, and something that I will definitely treasure for years to come. I kinda feel special having this book in my possession knowing that T.O.P wanted to keep one for himself as well.",1446508800,2,1071,4.080568720379147
