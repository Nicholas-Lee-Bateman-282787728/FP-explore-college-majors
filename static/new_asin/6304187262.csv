803222,3,6304187262,"The name Lucio Fulci is infamous among the circles of horror fans, and a synonymous of gore, and blood soacked films. However, in the case of the black cat, this does not apply. The black cat is freely adapted from a short story by Edgar Allan Poe, and its more like a mystery film, than a horror film, since the gore level is minimal. The story is about a series of murders that take place in a small english village, and the investigation of a scotland yard inspector, who tries to reveal the murderer, suspecting him to be a local medium who has the ability to communicate with the dead. This is not the typical fulci film, and fans who expect that it will be gory will probably be disappointed as it tends to be more like a mystery than a horror film. As far as the supplements of the disc are concerned, they're minimal, with only a fulci biography and a theatrical trailer. The quality ( on the Anchor Bay DVD )of the picture is sharp, with vibrant colors but there are some occasional blemishes and scratches, and the most disturbing thing is a set of two vertical lines that appear every now and then on the right side of the screen , and keep appearing till the very end of the film. The sound is in mono, the dialogues are clear with no hissing and crackles. All in all, not the typical fulci flick, but a pleasant film to watch aimed mainly for the fans.",993168000,5,1365,4.315175097276264
803223,2,6304187262,"It appears that Fulci did not spend a lot of time or effort in producing this retelling of the classic tale of ""The Black Cat"", as it seems shallow and hurried. The story involves a pretty young photographer  who gets caught up in murders in a tiny English village, which may or may  not be traceable to mad Patrick Magee and his pet cat. Hmmm...There is a  severe absence of trademark gore scenes here,  which is why ""The Black  Cat"" never features much in Fulci filmographies. The only really  unpleasant scene is the one in which Dagmar Lassander is burned alive, with  plenty of close-ups. The English village is all very beautifully shot, and  it appears to be on location, but in every scene of tension, Fulci reacts  by zooming in on the eyes of the characters, (and of the cat!) Afer scene  upon scene of close-ups of eyes, you will be praying for the cat to come  and rip yours out! This film came after Fulci's period of greatness, and is  nothing more than a stop gap.",957312000,4,979,4.438202247191011

803462,5,6304187262,"This is a very-very stylish atmospheric suspense filled movie that could have used a huge injection of HORROR.  As is, it's a mystery of sorts, dealing with strange deaths in a quaint English village, each one aided and abetted by an evil black cat.  The story is ""freely adapted"" from a tale by Edgar Allan Poe.  The camera is often in stalker-mode, at times sweeping along the ground at a cat's eye view.  The acting is fairly decent (especially Patrick Magee as the morbid professor Robert Miles who purports to be a medium given to collecting tape recordings of the recently deceased).  Once the unexplained deaths catch the attention of Scotland Yard, they send an Inspector (David Warbeck) to investigate.  He turns to a photographer (Mimsy Farmer) to take the crime photos.  She sees evidence that a cat was involved and since there's only one cat in the neighborhood............

Most of the film involves set pieces, gruesome deaths, a suffocating sense of mystique.  There are also an inordinate number of eyeball shots, close enough to see the whites of everyone's eyes.  They are not used sparingly.  While this might seem to indicate a certain amount of tension on everyone's part, after a while, the sheer number of close-ups proves more comical than sinister.  But I did like the eyeball to eyeball shot of two people conversing through an opening in a gate.  Very stylish, pity there wasn't more substance.

803464,5,6304187262,"This film begins with one of the coolest tracking shots I have ever seen. Lucio fulci's take on Edgar Allen poe's short story is a great piece of gothic horror. It really feels like a hammer or amicus film and not a lucio fulci gore fest which it isn't.  The film stars the great Patrick Magee from a clockwork orange and roger corman's masque of the red death (another Poe movie), his eyes frighten me. The Beyond's David Warbeck also stars. The film's score is amazing by Pino Donaggio and is up there with his scores for The howling, Carrie, dressed to kill, blowout, and Don't look now as some of the greatest scores ever. sergio salvati's camera work is beautiful and the beginning credits is a masterpiece.

803466,4,6304187262,"A Scotland Yard inspector and an American photographer are drawn into a bizarre series of deaths in a small English town that seem to be linked to a psychic medium and his hateful black cat.

Inspired by the tale from Edgar Allan Poe, gore legend Lucio Fulci's ""The Black Cat"" is a refreshing change from the sorts of Italian horror films I'm used to seeing. It almost feels like a Hammer or Amicus production, or an attempt at one rather, and as a big fan of those types of horror films, I was very relieved to see that. Part of the feeling surely comes from the English setting, and another from one of the main stars of the film, actor Patrick Magee. However, the story plays a part in this too, as this film is actually about the intriguing plot more than it is about the gore. In fact, I'd say ""The Black Cat"" is fairly mild in the gore department compared to other Italian horror films. The performances range from quite good to adequate, and the music is pretty cool, so overall I can easily say this is among the better Italian horror films I've seen, but, as I've said, it's more because it feels a bit like British horror. If you are into the more typical Italian horror films, perhaps you will not like ""The Black Cat"" so much. If you are a fan of Hammer and Amicus, this is a good segway into Italian horror. The DVD from Anchor Bay claims to be fully restored (though I guess that doesn't mean a flawless picture), and the film is presented in widescreen. Also included are the theatrical trailer and a bio on Lucio Fulci. I can honestly say I like ""The Black Cat"" and it is worth checking out, though there are still going to be questions you wish it had answered. It IS Italian horror, after all. Still, this is among their best in my opinion.",1231718400,12,1758,4.343465045592705
803467,3,6304187262,"It is often forgotten that ""The Black Cat"" was made in between Lucio Fulci's wonderful triptych of Zombie films, and is a further illustration that Fulci was very willing to tackle esoteric and challenging material. A further surprise in light of its position in Fulci's filmography is the relative lack of gore. Aside from one or two cat attacks and an especially memorable sequence involving an unfortunate character caught in a blazing inferno this film is more interested with atmosphere. A suitably eerie English village informs the narrative backdrop of a rather fanciful tale about a professor who can both control his feline and communicate with the dead. Unfortunately for him there isn't enough death in this sleepy village, which potentially halts his experiments, so his cat is rather busy. Patrick Magee as the deranged professor chews the scenery, and adds a touch of madcap class to a somewhat thankless role. Fulci is at his best when his prowling camera follows the cat around roofs and alleys, and he imbues the cat with a wonderful demonic personality thanks to a number of well timed and not overused point of view shots. However Fulci's propensity for close ups on the eyes of characters is over used and irritating, as is the attitude toward the backward locals. Its quite rich coming from an Italian film crew, Fulci himself had well documented the backward superstitions in his own ""Don't Torture a Duckling"". Aside from the bricking up of the largely superfluous Mimsy Farmer the film bears little resemblance to Poe's original treatise on guilty consciences. One or two usual nonsense scenes are present - why does Mimsy Farmer's bedroom go crazy in best ""Exorcist"" style?, and why are the powers of Scotland Yard brought in just to find a missing girl? This is ultimately low calorie Fulci and a forgettable entry in Fulci's horror cycle. What saves the film from total obscurity is an excellent score by Pino Dinaggio.",1199491200,2,1946,4.97239263803681
803468,3,6304187262,"The Black Cat released in 1981 is one of Lucio Fulci's lesser known efforts. The Black Cat was released in a time when the splatter era of Lucio Fulci was upon us. If its gore you are looking for you won't find very much here, while the Black Cat does have some violence it's not very gory at all; the couple of gore scenes we get are very tame actually. I wouldn't even call them gore scenes.

With The Black Cat Fulci focuses more on suspense; while we all have our own opinion I think a lot of people went into this movie expecting a gorefest. Lucio Fulci was a director who could make his movies come out creepier than they should have, but it's the gore is what really got fans talking. The Black Cat could have used more of the red stuff; while the movie wasn't bad it just never had that creepy feel that some of Fulci's other movies from this era did.

The close up of the eyes is a Lucio Fulci trademark; when used right that shot can be really effective and make a scene very eerie. But here in The Black Cat, Fulci goes into close up of the eyes overload. It seemed every other shot was a close up of the eyes. Honestly it can get rather annoying after a while. The look of the movie is well done for the most part; Sergio Salvati was the cinematographer and he worked with Fulci on some of his most popular flicks of the 80s.

Lucio Fulci and Sergio Salvati are able to create a great look visually and are able to make some scenes a little creepier than maybe they should have been. The Black Cat really wasn't a bad movie it's your typical Lucio Fulci movie only without the gore. There were some decent moments of suspense and the movie is actually well made for the most part. At times The Black Cat can drag and there are moments when it can be a bit boring, but overall The Black Cat is enjoyable.

If you aren't a fan of Lucio Fulci your best bet is probably to skip this, but if you are a fan or a some what fan of Fulci The Black Cat is worth a watch. Just don't expect any gore because you will be disappointed; while The Black Cat lacks in some areas it is enjoyable for the most part. Not one of Lucio Fulci's best, but not one his worst. The Black Cat is a decent watch and has it's moments.

The DVD from Blue Underground is the same exact disc as the Anchor Bay version. So if you already own the DVD there is no reason to buy another one.",1178323200,8,2366,4.101511879049676
803469,3,6304187262,"A Lucio Fulci film without popping eyeballs, perforated skulls, and oozing entrails? Who'da thunk it? Well, that's exactly what you get with The Black Cat (1984) aka El Gatto nero, originally released in 1981 (I believe 1984 was when it was released in the states). And you know what? It's actually not a bad film, although Fulci fans would probably disagree, seeing as how they were probably expecting the visceral, gooey mayhem found in some of his other films released around the same time, like Zombie (1979), City of the Living Dead (1980), and The Beyond (1981). Very loosely based on the Edgar Allan Poe story, the film was co-written and directed by Fulci. Appearing is Patrick `Shrubs for Eyebrows' Magee (A Clockwork Orange, Asylum), Mimsy Farmer (Four Flies on Grey Velvet, Autopsy), David Warbeck (Twins of Evil, The Beyond), and Al Cliver (The Beyond, The New Gladiators)...apparently Fulci himself was in the film, portraying a doctor, but those scenes got deleted...I'm curious as to why a director removes the scenes from his own film, scenes in which he appears in...couldn't he take direction from himself? Whatever...

The movie starts off in what looks to be a quaint, English town, and we see a man walking towards a car. We also get a point of view perspective from something low to the ground, so I'm assuming it's a cat, given the title...no great, intuitive leap there. Anyway, the man drives off, notices a huge, black cat in the back seat, which puts some sort of eyeball whammy on him, the car crashes, and the man's head has an untimely meeting with the windshield. As the auto bursts into flames, we see the cat slinking along, assumedly back to its abode, where we meet the town oddball Professor Robert Miles (Magee)...the cat and Miles obviously do not get along as the feline tags him good. Next we see a woman, later we find out her name is Jill (Farmer), taking pictures of some ruins, and discovering an underground passage to an old torture chamber, complete with cobwebby skeletons (hey, a giant hole in the ground, let's investigate!)...some stuff happens, and then we see a young couple sneaking into a boathouse to smooch...uh oh, here comes that darn cat. Some other stuff happens and now its night and we're in a graveyard with Miles, and he seems to be trying to communicate with the dead...oh bruther...anyway, Jill, being the exceptionally nosy woman she is, seeks out the nutter Miles, and gets an earful about what he's trying to do...some more mysterious deaths occur (seems the corpses have cat scratch fever), and Jill gets suspicious and even more nosy (just like a woman). Just what is the strange relationship Miles has with his pussy?

I did enjoy this film, but that's not to say it didn't have problems. There are some really wonderfully gothic location shots, along with some very creepy set pieces, but the story was fairly disjointed and required the viewer to make certain intuitive leaps without very much to go on...what exactly was the point of Miles efforts in talking to the dead and how did it fit in with the story? I really have no clue...it did serve to set up a meet and greet between Miles and Jill, but if that were the only reason for its inclusion, it was entirely overblown as there had to have been a much easier, quicker, more sensible device used to facilitate their coming together. And what exactly are these dead people telling him? ""Well, I'm in a dark, dank, musty box, my bits and pieces are falling off, there are lots of bugs, and I just don't feel myself...anything else you want to know, brainiac?"" This is one of those films where it seemed like all the pieces where there, but they just weren't put together to create a viable picture. As I mentioned earlier, fans of Fulci's more grotesque cinematic ventures will be disappointed with this film, as there's so little blood (there is some, along with some nekkiedness...the movie may not be full on Fulci, but it's still Fulci). I really didn't mind the film lacking in the visceral, as it was pretty cool to see what Fulci could do with a film sans the elements he's probably best know for...and like I said, he did all right. I haven't read Poe's short story this film is supposed to be based on, but I did get a sense a great deal of the material here wasn't in the original story (artistic interpretation can go far when it comes to movies based on previously printed works). Some aspects did feel incorporated like the relationship between Miles and the cat, and the bit near the end when Miles is doing the brick and mortar work in his cellar (looks like a union job to me)...that particular scene, I thought, was shot very well, from the point where the audience was behind the wall as he was building it up, the light slowly disappearing (actually, most all of the cellar sequences were pretty cool). If you got the claustrophobia this will really give you the creeps. As far as the performances went, I thought everyone did pretty well. The real standout was Magee, as he seemed locked into intense mode throughout the film, throwing his crazy man stare about. Was the film actually scary? Not really...there were some tense sequences, but nothing that stuck with me once the credits started rolling.

Anchor Bay Entertainment provides a very good-looking anamorphic widescreen (2.35:1) print on this DVD, along with a suitable Dolby Digital mono audio track. I did notice some lines in the print, on the right hand side of the screen from time to time, but it didn't happen often, so no big shakes. There are some extras, including an original theatrical trailer, a Lucio Fulci bio, liner notes by Travis Crawford (located on the flipside of the DVD cover artwork), and a 5X7 reproduction of original poster art on the DVD insert, the flipside featuring the chapter stops. If you're interested in buying this DVD, I'd suggest doing what I did and buying the Anchor Bay DVD Fright Pack: Man's Worst Friends, which features six films including Parasite (1982), Lucio Fulci's The Black Cat (1989), Slugs: The Movie (1988), Bruno Mattei's Rats: Night of Terror (1984), Zoltan, Hound of Dracula (1978), and Dario Argento's The Cat o' Nine Tails (1971). It's available here on the Amazon website, at a really good price, and cheaper than buying the individual releases.

803470,3,6304187262,"The Black Cat (Lucio Fulci, 1981)
Always remember, the title credits say the film is freely adapted from Poe's story. Freely may be the understatement of the year. Best not to think on Poe's tale until the final ten minutes.
The killer kitty is at the center of the story, causing a series of accidents in a small Scottish town whose inspector, Wilson (Fulci regular Al Cliver), gets expsterated and calls Scotland Yard. They send in Inspector Gorley (David Warbeck, who also teamed with Fulci for The Beyond the same year). Gorley and Wilson, with the help of plucky American photographer Jill Trevers (sixties biker bad girl Mimsy Farmer), try to solve the crimes while working out what an aging, eccentric mystic (Patrick Magee) has to do with it all.
And now, the part that will make Fulci fans wonder who really directed this movie: there's no eye scene, and there's no spider scene. In fact, it's almost as if Fulci wanted to tone down the gore and make an atmospheric, gothic horror/romance, but without the romance (except for one sex scene that would barely rate a PG-13 today).
Fulci himself considers this movie a disaster. Who am I to disagree? Well, I will, at least in part. It's certainly watchable enough, if confused. It's not Zombi or The Beyond, but it's got its endearing points. Worth a free rental. ** ",1075334400,,1324,4.731601731601732

803528,4,6304187262,"Along with Manhattan Baby, The Black Cat stands as one of Fulci's most maligned movies of this period of his career.  Personally, I feel that in many ways this is a much better film than Manhattan Baby, but also not quite as enjoyable.  Manhattan Baby reached for stars that its budget and writing never quite allowed it to achieve, failing in many of its attempts but still aspiring to be greater than the sum of it's parts.
The Black Cat is a much more grounded film, allowing the audience's knowledge of Poe's tale, along with the beautifully photographed English landscape to pull the film along.  One notices almost right off that this movie doesn't really feel much like a Fulci film at all.  There is some gore, but most of it is limited to blood flow, shed without the huge spurting wounds, or chunks of human flesh that the maestro is so well known for.  The story moves with a linear feel, not jumping around, or making huge leaps in logic that the average viewer couldn't possibly follow. And the action, while present never hits the nerve shattering breaking point that usually accompanies a Lucio Fulci film.
This movie is more a tribute to the gothic Poe adaptations of Roger Corman from the 60's; as if directed by an eye obsessed Pete Walker.  Fulci pulls in the bizarre landscapes, the paranoid actions of the locals. And a lighter, more humorous tone than usually permeates his films, and he does it all beautifully.
The most fun part of this film is by far the title feline himself (or herself, one never really knows).  The cat runs and attacks playfully through the movie, dubbed with near lion level roaring, and thrown into the faces of his victims by some off camera hands.  Plenty of unintentionally funny scenes occur as a result of this unthreatening cat clawing peoples hands and faces into bloody shreds.  But despite these shortcomings, the animal does have a certain personality all its own.  Fulci's countless eyeball close ups really make the audience feel as if we are bonding with the cat, which makes the scenes of it's intended demise that much more powerful.
If you are a fan of Fucli, Eurohorror, or Poe, you should be able to find something in this movie that will appeal to you. Don't come in expecting nothing but wall to wall gore, this film is much different than that. But then again, those people who get mad when Fulci's movies aren't wall to wall gore never really understood his work anyway.",993772800,13,2440,4.666666666666667

7864073,5,6304187262,"THE BLACK CAT (1981) starts off w/ a bloody, fatal car crash, apparently caused by the title feline. We know immediately that Director, Lucio Fulci (A LIZARD IN A WOMAN'S SKIN, DON'T TORTURE A DUCKLING, ZOMBIE, CITY OF THE LIVING DEAD) is at work! A young, amorous couple is gassed to death in a boathouse. Meanwhile, a Professor named Robert Miles (Patrick Magee- DEMENTIA 13, A CLOCKWORK ORANGE, ASYLUM) visits the cemetery, attempting to contact the dead. A visiting American photographer, named Jill Trevers (Mimsy Farmer- FOUR FLIES ON GREY VELVET) is taking pictures of local ruins, when she stumbles upon an ancient tomb, filled w/ the skeletons of torture victims. She seeks out Miles, after finding one of his microphones in the tomb. Miles has a strange, fatalistic relationship w/ his black cat. His dread seems well-placed, when yet another gory death is caused by the dark paws of the furry fiend! How could this be true? Does Miles really have psychic powers, able to see things that have occurred? The killer cat continues to cause constant catastrophe. As the town's only photographer, Jill is asked by police to photograph the crime scenes. Can Miles convince her that indeed, a cat is behind the string of ""accidents"". THE BLACK CAT is an excellent supernatural  thriller. I believe it takes quite a bit of skill to make a cat, even a black one, appear menacing. Fulci manages to do so, while not going as overboard as he has in some of his films. This cat gives off an eeevil vibe! Fulci's ""cat-vision"" camera shots add to the beast's air of malignancy. The nod to Poe's CASK OF AMONTILLADO, toward the end, is a nice touch. Highly recommended to horror lovers in general, as well as Fulci fanatics in particular...",1509235200,,1734,4.79933110367893
7864074,4,6304187262,"I just rewatched the Black Cat, and was suprised by how much I liked it this time around. I bought this DVD back in 2013 and hadn't revisited it since then. Fulci shows a surprising amount of restraint in the Black Cat, hard to believe it came out in between Fulci's films City of the Living Dead and The Beyond. I liked the cat point of view shots, and got to love all of the Fulci close up on people's eyes. Great cast of actors from other Fulci films.

Blue Underground DVD picture quality is great.  But the only extra is the theatrical trailer, so might be time to upgrade to the new Arrow Video Blu Ray.",1504137600,,609,4.196581196581197
7864075,4,6304187262,"I purchased this film with the understanding that it was going to be a gory B movie with little in the way of story, certainly owing nothing to Edgar Allen Poe.  The only part of the film that even evokes Poes story comes at the last few minutes.  Another reason (for me anyway) for buying the film is that I have adopted three black cats over the years.  From the opening minutes of the film, the black cat is doing away with people in inventive ways, making it appear to be an accident.  Patrick Magee makes a sinister character with an uncertain relationship to the black cat, and he also is attempting to communicate with the dead.  The plot of the film tends to get lost into the supernatural as the black cat appears and disappears at will, which provides evidence that something more than the cat is behind the murders.  There are some genuine tense moments in the film.

If you are interested in a creepy and bizarre film with a slender plot, look no further.",1499731200,,967,4.429378531073446
7864076,2,6304187262,"Not to be the killjoy, but this is pretty pathetic.  It's a C Movie of sorts in my opinion.  That is, it's like watching a student film.  Putting myself in the position of judge, or instructor (this would not rate as a film that would have to be graded by a professor, because any school employing actual professors would probably not be subjected to, or have to grade a movie this bad.)

So rather than calling it a B film, I call it a C film because a grade of C would be the highest or lowest I would grade it at.  It's just not that good.  It is an Italian language film, but you can turn on English sub-titles so the time you waste watching this fiasco of bad-student film making.

This could possibly be the directors first go at a 'Full Length Motion Picture.'  If this is him at his best, his career in film-making is a sad litany of failure.  If this was his first, maybe he did better later on.  THIS take on the Edgar Allan Poe classic, well, I didn't finish watching all the way to the end, so I don't know if anyone is skinned alive or not, but the make up and 'special effects' are just not 'first class.'

Loosely speaking, it's junk.  With a positive spin though, it's inspiring because it causes one to think, ""I could do better than this.'

If you just wanted to watch out of curiosity in order to compare this with the 1930's version with Bella Lugosi and that other famous cat who played Dracula or somebody during the course of his career and is well known and loved among film students, cinephiles and the like as I did, the original which I have not yet watched HAS to be better, and probably is.

This beast just defies any thing I could say in an effort to be kind and not hurt anyone's feeling.  If you're looking for a reason to watch anyway, whether to see if it's actually as bad as I'm saying it is in contrast to a much higher percentage of those who gave it a higher score:  there is some gratuitous waist up nudity including some bare booby.

I'm not writing this in an effort to slam the mediocre acting, the tacky, lousy overall finished product, so-so cinematography, but to sum it all up.  I don't think you're going to enjoy this film.  But don't take my word for it, go for it.  I'm just giving you a heads up if you set the bar above waist high for movie night.",1499472000,,2301,4.210045662100456
7864077,4,6304187262,"If you don't enjoy late 70's Italian horror with all of it's bizarre non-sequitors, old school pacing and Cadmium Red blood effects you won't like this. My positive opinion of this movie comes from the POV of someone who likes the oddly batsh@t drive in theater nature of 70's - 80's horror films, has a soft spot for cats, is watching alot of Fulci, and has just discovered just how excellent a company Arrow Video is. This is a slasher movie with a little black cat as the killer. The killing spree is motivated by it's strange relationship with the local psychic, recluse, and paranormal researcher. The nature of this relationship is unclear, but it's implied that the cat is picking up on the man's sub-conscious petty jealousies and anger at his fellow villagers and acting on it. In one of those bizarre Italian horror twists it seems (at first) like neither actually want the killings to take place and each seems to resent the other. This is one of the most interesting aspects of the film and of course it's totally ditched for the sake of a climax where both cat and man are threats to the protagonist. The film is complimented by some excellent documentary content (about 2 hrs. worth) and an entertaining commentary. I find these movies improve greatly with commentary. The films of Fulci can be so gory and nonsensical that the presence of a commentator explaining why decisions were made adds tremendous value to the package. The new arrow cover is really cool as well.",1494201600,2,1484,4.711538461538462
7864078,5,6304187262,"Not a fan of most of Fulci's work, I had to watch this because of the Poe ""tie-in"".

Mr. Fulci was not about a linear narrative.  Not at all.  In a diabolic and very Jungian, odd turn of events, Patrick Magee (""A Clockwork Orange"") is a psychic ? scholar? maybe..supposed to sort of be like a Leprechaun on two legs? is the witting channel for the rage of a black cat.  The black cat appears at different times, at one point really f***ing up a Police Inspector who thinks he's Rico Suave.

Despite the absurdities that dog the film, it has a certain perverse (Poe's word, not mine) ""immanence of doom"" majesty.  Fulci knows how to drive home certain aspects of the ""The Black Cat"" and ""The Cask of Amontillado"" without needing to place us in a place of the slightest rationality.  The film utilizes a cat's eye to perfection.",1487116800,,826,4.466666666666667
