3156063,5,B0016C7E64,"James Ray is an amazing speaker, who knows how to get his point across. In this DVD on Harmonic Wealth, he explains the concept in good detail going into every area to help you achieve your goals. It is important to be balanced in all areas he says, rather than just thinking that financial wealth is it, the end of your unhappiness. The way that the explanations have been done in the DVD are easy to understand. You won't be disappointed.",1216512000,6,440,4.444444444444445
3156064,1,B0016C7E64,"This 'movie' is just one of Ray's live one-hour seminars caught on film.
I enjoyed his straight-forward, matter of fact style in the book and audio book; however his over the top enthusiasm in this seminar comes off as a little insincere and the story he tells about himself leading up to his motorcycle accident is extremely hokey and the message from the book does not carry through to his live show very well.
If you have read the book or listened to the audio book, I wouldn't recommend buying this movie as I believe you will be as disappointed as I was; however I do highly recommend the book and audio book.",1214611200,20,614,4.442477876106195
3156065,5,B0016C7E64,"This is one of the best personal growth materials I have ever purchased. James Ray is not only practical, but he's funny, warm & touching with his personal stories. This was done in a colorful & creative manner~complete with great music. If you liked ""The Secret"", you will love anything by James Ray!!!",1212624000,9,303,4.735849056603773
3156066,5,B0016C7E64,"I just finished Harmonic Wealth by James Ray and loved it.  Once finished, I am ready to start it again.  My husband, 16 year old son and myself, read it together at night and had discussions about life, money, health and dreams for our lives. We have had our own business for 27 years and most of what we read is how we have lived our lives.  It is a teaching tool to learn how we all need to take responsibility for ourselves in all areas of our life.  To follow our dreams or bliss. To live the life that is truly harmonic wealth in all areas of our lives, wealth, spiritual, physical, mental and relational. What a great book to read.  I would recommend for everyone to read and if possible get it into schools.",1208390400,11,715,4.227941176470588

8262102,5,B0016C7E64,"This is a very inspiring speech by James Arthur Ray in which he shares his life-changing methods and insights. It's funny, entertaining, and very inspirational. I enjoyed seeing it.",1390003200,,181,5.275862068965517
8262103,5,B0016C7E64,"If you are a fan of the movie ""the secret"" or believe in the law of attraction... then this movie is definitely one to add to your collection.  Love James Arthur Ray... he speaks with energy and explains things on a level easy for any one to understand.  Great tips and pointers... happy I added this to my collection of inspirational dvd's.",1336867200,,341,4.483870967741935
8262104,4,B0016C7E64,"This video is essentially one of Rays taped seminars with some theatrical overlays.  It was well done compared to alot of others that I own which are basically the same thing - taped seminars.

Ray is an excellent speaker and I believe his knowledge and message comes from a sincere place, although can be over the top a bit - but is still quite entertaining and more importantly informative with a bit of inspiration.

I gave this video 4 stars based on the content and how it was presented.  I am very  much in line with what Ray speaks about, especially the ""everything is energy"" view which is becoming more popular since actual science has proven this to be true, but lately have have the guts to reveal this truth.

If you like speakers such as Wayne Dyer, Deepak Chopra and JZ Knight, you will like James Ray.  He's enthusiastic, funny and very knowledgeable about metaphysics in every day life. Again, a good one for the collection.",1254528000,2,940,4.592814371257485
8262105,3,B0016C7E64,"I need to WATCH things in order for them to make sense for me.  Reading doesn't cut it, so that's why I gravitate towards movies more so than books.  Anyway, I read some reviews about how this movie didn't live up the book.  My take is a bit different.  I feel like the movie was FANTASTIC, even more so than the book.

James Arthur Ray, you got a little taste of him from watching The Secret, so I didn't really know how I'd take to him on his own.  I was VERY pleased with the way he combined The Law of Attraction with Quantum Physics, and delivered it in a very easy to understand, yet impactful way.

I went into this movie with low expectations, but coming out of it, I'd HIGHLY recommend it to anyone who wants to improve their lives.  This isn't a movie about money.  It's about wealth in all areas of your live.  I can't say about good things about this film and James Arthur Ray.

Update: 3/17/10 - I almost deleted this review because my opinion of James Arthur Ray changed completely since the Sedona, AZ incident, but didn't, because the DVD was actually very good.  The man should obviously be imprisoned for the remainder of his life, as he is a murderer.  Accidental or not, the man is a murderer, and needs to do serious time behind bars.",1252972800,2,1255,4.311965811965812
8262106,5,B0016C7E64,Best dvd on Law of Attraction! James Arthur Ray nail it down in simpliest and perfect form. Thanks James.,1223078400,2,105,4.578947368421052
8262107,5,B0016C7E64,"The entire content of this DVD is exceptional.  The music, seminar, and the subject manner are all outstanding. Overall this DVD captures you in your core intellect from the beginning of it to the ending credits.  Much needed real reflection of your life and the core essentials of what true wealth really is.  You will play it again and again.",1222732800,2,344,4.7
8262108,2,B0016C7E64,"This movie is a good introduction to the concepts of Harmonic Wealth, but I was rather disappointed since I read the book first and it was amazing.

So for those new to James Ray and his perspective on practical spirituality and the law of attraction, then the DVD is a good starting place... just make sure you watch it *before* you read the book!

Also, James is a very dynamic speaker - so be prepared for his explosive ""BAM!"" kinds of comments that seem to come out of nowhere.",1221350400,4,481,4.393258426966292
8262109,5,B0016C7E64,This is an amazing and uplifting DVD. James peels the onion back quickly on what we need to do to create the kind of results we really want in our lives. I will watch this DVD over and over again and I've recommended it to friends who also enjoyed it very much.,1220659200,3,261,4.038461538461538

8262111,5,B0016C7E64,"James Ray displays such passion, integrity and humility in this wonderful video. His style is extremely entertaining and the subject matter is brilliantly delivered. I highly recommend this video. It has been the next step for me from ""The Secret""and ""What the Bleep"".",1217289600,,268,5.255813953488372
