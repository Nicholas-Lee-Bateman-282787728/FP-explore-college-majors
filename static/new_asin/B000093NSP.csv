1878234,5,B000093NSP,This is just essential for having a close up view of this pioneering movement that charted a course for unknown horizons. Lavey's sense of humor and carny roots are on full display here actually putting one at ease. The most refreshing fact is to see that most of the members are actually middle aged and not young somber followers with all the trapings. Well worth the documentary tour.,1440633600,,387,4.705882352941177
1878235,3,B000093NSP,"an it's-not-so-shocking-anymore documentary that's nowadays funny. so corny its cool. full of naked women who should have definitely stayed clothed, women making out with snakes, and suspicous neighbors that are naive, dull bulbs. LaVey seemed to make an effort to be normal and ordinary, perhaps to lessen the controversy that no doubt surrounded him. He had some interesting insights and did things his own way, but what you are seeing here is his own brand of Satanism (as if there is any ""official"" kind?). It's definitely a do it yourself ""religion"" that was a reaction to the religious establishments at the time, which is how any religious sect is formed. He is better in writing than what is presented here, in my opinion",1437782400,,729,4.934959349593496

1878253,5,B000093NSP,"Yet again I will say that, I am very proud to call myself a Satanist. If your curios or if you already call on the Dark, this digital video disk gives you a look into a time shortly after the formation of our Church by the original man who surrounded himself with the comforting embrace of Satan. Calling himself an animal and taking great comfort in living as the beasts of the field. Rejoicing in the fleshly life. For the here and now, he knew as any sensible gambling man, was the only sure thing. So for me this was an absolute delight! Getting to see immediately after the formation of Anton LaVey's Church of Satan. Here today every Satanist including myself, owes a very great deal of gratitude to the man who dared to shed the blood, sweat and tears paving our ways for future generations. So truly hard he fought for us to where now, this beautiful country of ours actually recognizes Satanism as an actual religion, right beside all the rest. Or more accurately put, it is the left hand path beside all the, ""right religions."" For those nostalgic few like myself, nothing but sheer joy awaits you. For those just trying to get a glimpse inside, satisfaction for your burning curiosity may await. If your not satisfied however, perhaps you would like a guided tour down the left hand path.

1878255,5,B000093NSP,"This 1970 film is a great, honest, non-hostile, un-biased documentary presentation of the early days and general proceedings of the Church of Satan---possibly the only such one other than Nick Bougas' Speak of the Devil from 1993.  While I personally prefer Speak of the Devil because I felt it captured more of LaVey the person---his intelligence,  his charisma and his personality---this is nonetheless a gem.  It captures the spirit of the time so vividly, and the ritual scenes are very moving, though I am a Satanist so perhaps you would consider me biased.  But even from an aesthetic standpoint, the stunning gothic solemnity and high nobility of these dark ceremonies will make you feel SOMETHING I hope.  If not, check your pulse.  I also especially like that a lot of this documentary is dedicated to speaking to regular everyday people in the area and letting them talk about how they feel about having the Church of Satan in their neighborhood.  Some are supportive, some quite displeased.  If you are a Satanist or are at all interested in the Church of Satan's history, check this out.  Now I don't know quite what to say about the bizarre hypersexual Z-movie Sinthia: The Devil's Doll which seems almost like a random thing to slap onto a DVD with this serious documentary.  I love incredibly weird movies though, so I didn't mind, but the squeamish and faint-of-heart will find themselves skipping out on the bonus film.",1354924800,,1436,4.896694214876033

1878259,5,B000093NSP,"The film ""Satanis"" was the first documentary made on Anton LaVey and the Church of Satan, and remains a vital document to all those who may be interested in the philosophy and rituals of LaVey's group. Everybody gets a look-in here in this production: Anton LaVey himself, his beautiful blonde wife Dianne, the family pet, ""Togare"", (a fully grown Lion), some of LaVey's neighbours, plus other members of the Satanic Church. Sections from a number of Satanic Rituals are covered in this documentary, including an interview with the female, nude Altar: centrepiece of the LaVey Ritual procedure. (Unfortunately, people buying this disc in the hope of bearing witness to human and animal sacrifices will be disappointed). The documentary encapsulates a straightforward, explanatory insight into The Church of Satan and the man who founded it.

""Satanis"" is joined on this disc by an extremely odd,totally avant-garde cinematic schlock-horror offering called ""Sinthia"", but this itself is upstaged completely by the DVD's (unintentionally) hilarious extras: soft-core porn packaged as a forbidden ritual; a strip show from the 1950's; a brilliant, nostalgic gallery of schlock. The best of the extras, however, is the ludicrous mini-documentary featuring an alleged ""Witchcraft Initiation Rite"" taking place in a large, isolated manse in the middle of the English countryside, and narrated by stereotypical English ""cad"" (and famous Hollywood Suicide) George Sanders.",1297814400,,1464,5.565022421524664
1878269,3,B000093NSP,"I came into this one from two perspectives: one as an occultist and one as a fan of exploitation cinema. If you're looking for any sort of real, hard hitting investigation into the nature of Anton LaVey's Church of Satan, you'd probably be better served looking elsewhere. It is interesting as a tool of comparison, showing the CoS in it's fledgling years compared to how it is today, and what has changed. LaVey as ring-leader and master of ceremonies is as charming, funny, and insightful as you'd expect, but in today's world, what must have seemed incredibly shocking for the early 70's comes off as sort of droll and nonthreatening (especially seeing Anton in his fuzzy little terry-cloth devil hat). As far as exploitation cinema, it's ok as a period piece, but there's certainly more hardcore shocks and thrills available. In the end, its probably worth it for the exploitation movie completist, but neither the Devil's Mass nor Sinthia thrill all that much, especially if you're looking for some meaty occultism to chew on.

A tenative recommendation.",1273190400,,1059,4.983050847457627
1878270,5,B000093NSP,"The best documentary on the Church of Satan. Anton Lavey the High Priest of the COS tells the background, of his beliefs.

1878271,4,B000093NSP,I have been studying The Church of Satan and decided that I wanted an inside look at Anton LaVey and company. It's actually quite entertaining but some of the parts are a little strange. Not something I would show at a family get together or anything. Worth the price and offered some good interviews with LaVey and members of the church.,1270252800,,338,4.557377049180328
1878272,3,B000093NSP,"This DVD contains 2 full length films about the devil.  One is a devil related ""horror"" film while the main feature on this disc is a documentary that was shot in the late 60's/early 70's of Anton Levay, the owner of the black church in California (heard about in the Eagles hit, ""Hotel California"").

The documentary is really a highlight piece on Anton Levay and his followers.  It definitely was shot to ""shock"" audiences back in the early 70's and it's been used in a lot of Christian videos decrying the ""evils"" of the devil.  Geraldo has even taken pieces of it for some of his reporting on Satanism and Kids.  A lot of the footage was used during the 80's when the devil movement was apparently taking kids and sacrificing them to the devil, though none of this was actually proven.

The footage in this day and age really doesn't shock anymore but it's a nice look back at the beliefs at the time of the ""church of satan.""  The documentary is very slow so don't expect great filmmaking and the scenes in this movie are obviously staged to scare the people watching this.

Overall it's an entertaining pseudo-documentary to make parents scared.

The feature length movie on this disc is really not worth talking about but there are tons of extras that are entertaining.  If you pick up the disc for about $5 you will have a good time, if you pay more than that, it probably wouldn't be worth it.

He's a total freaking George McFly, just listen to his voice. He's an uninspired DWEEB in the lowest form (but what can we expect from a high school drop out and carnie whose writtings are basically watered down basterdizations of Crowley and Nietzsche).

1878275,4,B000093NSP,"If you want to see Anton LaVey at his best,then this is it. It was filmed at Anton's peak,as a sinister religious curiosity,at the crossroads of changing American beliefs,values and social mores. Anton Lavey was a self-taught and a serious scholar of history. Yet,his ecletic library of literary hodge-podge,could not compete with the massive volumes of a university's bibliose shelves. Anton presents some credible points about the fallicies and hypocriticies of modern christian societies. Anton makes clearly the point that you have to be a valid 'christian' to be a valid 'satanist'.There is something primal tucked away in the deep recesses of modern people's brain,that there is a need for 'bloodlust'.LaVey's rituals symbolically recreate the primitive virgin sacrifices of our developing proto-pagan ancestors. Today,we live in a modern judeo-christian western world,where we channel our bloodlust through other means. Contact sports,cable pay-per-view,the internet tube,video games and rock concerts are some examples. I think part of the trouble Lavey ran into was the finality of his christain/satanist linear thinking. He believed one is born,one lives and one dies,either going to Heaven or to the Devil,forever.
Neo-pagans believe in a circular life,where the eternal universe is cycling and we are born,spiritually tune in (or tuning out),and then carnally passed on,to be reborn by Nature once again. Was LaVey a serious occultist?I think in the beginning he was,it filled a spiritual void within him. Yet,LaVey was a skilled theatrical showman,who enjoyed playing up the 'negative energy' to get attention from his audience. The lacking of a serious academic foundation caused his satanic parsonage to crumble into a freaky vaudeville novelity act. Christian people who were ignorant about their pagan past,seemed most prone to the sinister spells of Anton LaVey,and gravitated to his black masses. A later documentary,filmed ten years later,shows a worn-out LaVey recalling his younger days and his satanic life. The name of the flick is,'Speak of the Devil'.Also a must see. The last part of this DVD is pure schlock,churning out grade-B Hollywood gristmill classics,take it or leave it.",1255651200,,2206,5.548961424332345

Satanis: The Devil's Mass (Ray Laurent, 1970)

Amusing, if biased and exploitive, documentary about the (then-)newly-formed First Church of Satan. Interview footage with the late Anton LaVey is intercut with clips of Satanic masses (replete with women in various stages of undress, probably as much to lure the paying rubes to the cinema as for any sense of veracity) and interview footage with people who live in the Church's neighborhood. The latter provide the truly amusing moments, as they range from the thoughtfully inquisitive to the knee-jerk ""they're gonna burn in hell!"" types. (The two Mormon door-to-door evangelists are especially fun. Watch out for them.) These days, with The Satanic Bible in its umpty-ninth printing, little of this is going to be new to anyone who has even a passing familiarity with Anton LaVey's credos, but it's certainly great for drinking games and the occasional nostalgic fling--in the seventies, this was exploitation cinema, folks. ***",1228608000,,1019,5.283950617283951
1878278,1,B000093NSP,"Ha Ha Ha.  Fooled you, because I'm DIABOLICAL!!!!  I actually think this DVD should get 4 stars. The world is a little less interesting now that this Messiah of Modern Times has released his mortal coil. He was a true visionary.  He realized (and helped others to realize) the hypocrisy and mind control of institutional religion and created a philosophical/aesthetic assault as an antidote to that influence. Institutional religiosity keeps the herds mindless so they can give up their personal wills to religions that keep them from facing reality or taking responsibility for themselves.  Lavey intended to awaken a few courageous souls to step out of the Matrix by giving them some intellectual free space and confidence to start thinking for themselves.  Most dolts are so blindly reactionary to concepts of good and evil that they're too blind to realize that the man wasn't ""evil"" or promoting a destructive view of the self and world.  He isn't really a Satanist as he doesn't believe in God (nor evil or good).  It's all a joke and a put on which the Christian automatons helped to promote and make famous by giving him all the publicity he needed, turning him from a neighborhood eccentric to an internationally known figurehead who hobnobbed with the rich and famous (William Shatner, we never knew ye.)  How ironic.  Christian churches perpetually need objects to fearmonger so they can continue to control their sheep and they find that in Satan.  Fear of burning in hell is how they discourage an honest inquiry that would get people to realize the MYTH that Christianity is. Do your homework and see how Christian beliefs have profoundly changed over the millenia. (i.e. Doesn't anyone think it peculiar that all the new testaments were found in the Meditteranean and written in Greek, nothing in Aramaic, which was the supposed language of Jesus and his apostles? Why are Paul's words in the epistles considered equal to Jesus's when Paul never heard Jesus speak? Early Christians believed when you died you hibernated in the ground, hence certain burial customs to preserve the body, until the second coming and at which point they were resurrected and judged worthy of eternal physical life on this planet. If unworthy you would be consigned to oblivion NOT eternally burning in Hell. The Christian religion is plainly a myth that usurped elements from other myths/religions and revamped them for new generations/millenia.) That being said, this documentary gives you everything you'd ever need to know about the Church of Satan. Check the opening sequence when Sweet Anton enters his ritual chamber with hyper-pompous solemnity.  It cracks me up everytime I see it. How could anybody think he was for real?  The funny thing is I found more compassion and acceptance in the faces of the Satanic church members on this DVD than I found in the faces of people I knew when I went to a Christian church (before the Devil opened my eyes) or the ""straights"" interviewed in this documentary.  Better a warm hearted sinner than a saint whose heart is hardened with piety.  The only reason I didn't give this DVD 5 stars is because this is a dated documentary, reflecting more the attitudes and mores of the early 70s than wholly speaking to modern times, as today people are familiar with anarchy and are more narcissistic than they were back then.  Or so it seems. If you got this far and looked for this DVD here, then you'll probably get a kick out of it. Diabolus Bless.  : )  I mean  : (",1189987200,,3502,4.847315436241611
1878288,2,B000093NSP,"I am reviewing the Anton LaVey documentary.  I watched about 2 minutes of the 2nd movie and quickly realized I could not suffer through it.

I already read a lot about Anton LaVey and his religious beliefs.  Basically, he doesn't believe in Satan and openly states so. His religious dogma is basically common pop psychology heavily mixed with Humanism.  Despite not actually believing in or being centered around Satan, it is of course, called Satanism, and he wears silly horns, utilizes several Satanic symbols, and constantly prays to Satan in his Masses.

The best I can gather is that Anton LeVay purposely started a religion in pop psychology/humanism belief that also serves as a hedonistic social club (mostly so he can have orgys easily).

This documentary has Anton explaining his major beliefs, Anton performing his Black Mass, interviews with followers (mostly social outcast Humanists disillusioned with Catholicism (the CoS Black Mass takes a lot from Catholic Mass and tries to do or say the opposite), neighbors (some concerned and some just mocking LaVey), and supporters.

The Black Mass footage features some naked saggy breasted senior ladies who just lie on the alter while Anton goes on and on boringly with his Black Mass verbage.

We also get to see footage of Anton playing with his pet lion, and stories about it's escape and about Anton being forced to donate it to a zoo.

All in all, Anton and his Church of Satan is more silly than sinister.  I guess it will continue as long as their are Marilyn Manson types and their 12 year old followers.

---Not part of the movie but interesting info----

The Church of Satan has as official dogma the belief that Anton LaVey played the Devil in Rosemary's Baby.  All insiders deny Anton played the part.",1155081600,,1773,4.87

He's worth the price of the disc right there. And that's not all! There's also some nutty mormon guys, some nice late 1960's styled nudity that's later follwed by the spectacle of a saggy looking lady on the altar (this proved to me that Satanists truly accept folks as they really are. lol!), and interviews with LaVey's neighbors are a real hoot too! I'd love to see more of the Church of Satan. They certainly aren't stuffy or bland. SATANIS is the reason to pick this up and it's well worth a look by fans of fun forgotten cinematic gems.

1878291,3,B000093NSP,"SATANIS: The Devil's Need for Clothes

BEWARE: The ""nude women on the altar"" are rather plump and geriatric, so don't go thinking this'll be some sort of supermodel type of nudity, because it ain't! And it ain't pretty! I only wish someone had warned me about it first.
LaVey is articulate and confident and speaks his mind beautifully, as does his then-wife Diane. Daughter Karla thinks the whole thing is just weird, and unfortunately the outrageously-beautiful youngest daughter Zeena was just a baby then.
It has it's moments of humor, in particular at the beginning when they finish up the ritual and LaVey dismissively says ""well, that's all for that part"" or something to that effect.
Mostly it reveals the types of people that are drawn into LaVey's ideology. They are primarily not the high society types, and frankly are quite low society. The main altar lady--a 50-ish creature who simply should never be unclothed, even in a home for the blind--discusses at length her low income youth and comes off as trailer trash,  as do a couple others. And during a ritual scene you see one very geeky-looking teenaged nerd who looks like that computer whiz you beat up in high school on a daily basis. It's no surprise to see some of these outcasts there looking for acceptance.
And that's what opened my eyes to what it's really all about: a safe haven for geeks and old ladies. Thanks, I'll pass.
The Sinthia movie is forgettable. Just an excuse to show some skin. Which isn't necessarily a bad thing, it's just that, like SATANIS, the skin quality isn't that great except for the main character.

1878292,5,B000093NSP,"The only reason I'd picked up  this DVD by SOMETHING WEIRD VIDEO was to be able to see Anton Lavey's SATANIS--hell, it's the ONLY reason to pick this collection up. But anyway, call it staged, call it a documentary, call it a docudrama-- call it what you will, but no matter what you decide, this is still an insightful look at the man and his then rather newish Church Of Satan. I had never seen Lavey speak on his religion before and here, he does so and I didn't find myself dissappointed. It's likely that the haters will find many bones to pick with this rather dated looking production, but considering it came out in  '70 , it still holds up pretty well.  After all, the times have changed, but the philosophy pretty much remains the same no matter how you dress it up or down. The 70's mode comes off as rather campy nowadays, but hell...the same can be said for the 80's too!
In one segment, Lavey is sitting amongst early COS members and commenting upon sexuality. In one part he briefly discusses Homosexuality and comments on it being a *NON ISSUE*. Bravo. How funny that many supposed Satanists that I've run into conveniently forget this. I appreciated those words & others coming DIRECTLY from the man himself. This film is a combination ""documentary"" and stage show (and depending on who you ask it's all staged). Some of the rituals seem a little silly looking now, but likely was quite disturbing to some back in the day, but who knows? I definitely wasn't there. I  have no complaints with how this whole production was orchestrated. It was an enjoyable view that didn't give me the feeling that the early COS was full of tweeked out fanatics blindly following Lavey. Many are quite able to sensibly tell you WHY Satanism was their chosen path. In fact, if you've read THE SATANIC BIBLE, you'll see this film is a perfect visual accompaniment to the book. It was good to see Lavey didn't come off as some crazy man ('course, I guess THAT depends on what path you're on, eh? But I was STILL waiting to see if he'd come off as a total Jim Jones, but luckily, that never materialized). Instead, he comes off as articulate and with a firm grasp of the concepts that he's speaking on, and also looks quite comfortable in  front of the camera.
 I am pleased to have this film within my collection here, but I do have two sizeable gripes about the DVD production itself. FIRST----On the SATANIS film: The transfer is not all that great. If you look at it with its age in mind, then it's acceptable, as in old TV show acceptable. And who knows how many 'archive' copies of this film still exist, so we might just take what we can get. I'm just sorry there wasn't better. It's DEFINITELY watchable, but if you're looking for a prestine transfer, this isn't it. SECOND---My biggest gripe about this package overall is that SATANIS was crunched in here with all of this other crappy ""Satanic"" stuff. It would have been nice to see SOMETHING WEIRD VIDEO pair the film up with a bit more seriousness instead of the garbage that they'd found to fill the rest of the disc. For those who want some kooky ""Satanic"" stuff, this of course makes great fodder and the pieces aren't totally awful on their own (well....uhm....). And I will admit that SINTHIA has some great (?!) lines that would be well suited for your answering machine's outgoing massage. SOMETHING WEIRD VIDEO is known for pulling together obscurities, which is cool. However, as a person on the Left Hand Path I would have preferred a DVD of Satanic documentaries that provides an overview of the religion & its many forms or even an all Lavey disc. But I guess depending on where you stand on Satanism, this could be the appropriate presentation of it after all. But despite all of this, if you are seriously into *any* variant of Satanism/LHP, you should at least make a pitstop and check this out once as part of your studies.",1066089600,,3897,4.55206847360913
1878293,5,B000093NSP,"Satanis is a wonderful documentary about Anton LeVey and his Church of Satan.  Every neighbour interviewed has either one of two extreme reactions: either he is evil incarnate and doomed to go to Hell, or else they think the Church is one of the funniest things they have ever encountered.  For example, one woman laughs about how Anton keeps trying to talk her large-chested friend into coming in for one of their ceremonies because he wants to see her naked.  Priests interviewed suggest that what he is doing is a silly passtime.  Stories are also told about, e.g., having to put up with the noise his pet lion would make at night.  The ceremonies themselves are a laugh riot.
Sinthia is nothing more than pop psychology nonsense.  Some of the psychedelic imagery is fun, and there are some laugh out loud moments, but it can get dull at times.  Suggested drinking game: one shot every time the lead female screams ""Mommy!"" or ""Daddy!"" (Actually, forget that.  Nobody can drink that much and live).
The extras are great too.  ""My Tale is Hot"" is funny (especially when the Lou Costello type complains to the devil ""Hey, you interrupted the Walt Dibney show!!"").  ""Sex Ritual..."" pretends to be a serious documentary, but is actually nothing more than an exploitation short with spooky, weird sets.  Its high level of prententiousness is hillarious.  The guys on Queer Eye for the Straight Guy will be surprised to learn when they watch this last short that they are unknowingly engaging in Satanic rituals.",1065916800,,1509,4.828793774319066
1878294,5,B000093NSP,"Before Speak of the Devil, which shows a look into the Black House today, that has long since been closed for public display of Satanic rites, there was Satanis. For many of us who were not yet incarnate upon this Black Earth, Satanis provides us with an intimate look inside the early Church of Satan, when this revolutionary organization gained its initial notoriety. We get to see L'Air Epais, in which a cardinal receives a flogging, then is reborn unto Satan & his own fleshly desires, as he enters a coffin containing the manifestation of Lilith. The ""lord's prayer"" is said backwards, a witch urinates blasphemously, as she represents a nun gaining liberation. We also get to see a curse, employing a beautiful serpant, & a fetish doll is impaled, as the congregation swoons in an hypnotic state of morbidity. A compassion ritual is also encated, as well as a lust spell.

Throughout the video, interviews are conducted with Dr. LaVey, & other Satanic Witches & Warlocks, & also with neighbors, who have varying opinions on the Satanic Church, its Black Pope, & its practices. Also here, are interviews with little Karla LaVey, & Diane LaVey, the second first lady, who repeatedly quotes the Doctor, verbatum. Baby Zeena is only briefly seen at the zoo, being held by Diane.

Satanis is the definitive, official documentary of The Church Of Satan, during its media-manipulation period of emergence, & subsequent development. With all of the emotions this video will inspire in you, you will feel as if you were there, partaking in the diabolic rites yourself.

""IN NOMINE NOSTRI SATANAS DEI! HAIL SATAN!""

Sinthea: The Devil's Doll

I recently had the opportunity to view the second feature on the Satanis DVD entitled ""Sinthea: The Devil's Doll"", and is easilt probably the worst movie I have ever seen, even with the  nudity included! Adding more skin and sex would have been its saving grace, but alas...

A young girl with a serious father-fixation comes upon her father and mother engaged in their marital affairs, and proceeds to stab them both and stab them both and burn the house down afterwards, and is subsequently committed to an asylum until an evaluation can be held upon reaching legal age to determine whether or not she should be released into society. At the evaluation, a psychotherapist regresses her launching her into a Jungian dream-world of orgies, a Luciferian sex cults' Bachannal, various mother-father projections, as well as a sweet lesbian scene. The Lucifer character proclaims that ""no matter where she goes, the servants of Lucifer will always follow."" That she would eventually return and join the cult. Her ""initiation"" consists of a flogging while all present laugh at her pain, torment, and misery. It seems that she squeals ""mommy, daddy!"" at least once or twice every ten minutes, which does become rather tedious, thus losing its fetishistic appeal. On a couple of occasions, she materializes upon a beach where she must choose her path, and is pursued by a red-faced mime, losing her clothing in the process.

The Psychotherapist eventually snaps her out of her hypnogogic trance as her self-projection is on the verge of a breakdown, and informs her that the only way to be rid of all of her frustration, confusion, and guilt, is to essentially relive the event of origin but change the outcome - that she would have to kill herself instead of her parents. So she enters the dark subconscious once again committing suicide in that crucial moment, thus altering her memories. She awakens relieved and seeming balanced. She thanks the Doctor and proceeds to step outside and driven by an automobile driven by none other than her father! As she plants a deep kiss on him. {I presume this was done for shock effect, for he of course was murdered}.

Rating: 1/5. Despite the pretty nude girl frolicking in the forest. Overall, this way out the street for mine!

Supernatural Trailers

The Devil's Hand, House of Exorcism, Mark of The Devil: Part II, Meat Cleaver Massacre, Witchcraft '70.

With the obvious exception of Witchcraft '70, which contains actual Satanic Rites conducted at The Black House along with an interview segment with Dr. LaVey, these consist of various previews of horror-themed presentations.

* Satanic Shorts

British Black Mass: In Britain, a film crew is supposedly ""allowed"" to witness a ""Black Magic ceremony"" through the window, because the ""evil forces"" conjured therein would strike the crew dead were they to set foot within the unhallowed grounds. Ring around the rosy commences, coupled with a supposed slaughtered chicken whose 'blood' is dripped upon the naked flesh of a nubile acolyte. Obviously, this is completely staged made for grimly piquant entertainment.

My Tale Is Hot: A fella gets paid a visit from Old Scratch as he sits down in his living room easy chair to watch some innocuous program, which is ""interrupted"" by a salacious performance from a sexy young stripper, which is much more preferable in this writer's estimation!

Sex Ritual of The Occult

Beginning as a three-part documentary-style film about ""Witchcraft"", a troupe of play actors ""re-create"" various traditions:

1. Lapsing into ceremonial orgiastic practices under the guise of a ""Black Mass"", including a girl in a coffin with surrounding undulating naked bodies.

2. Two homosexuals encounter each other in a misty dream-like setting {apparently on a park bench} - what this has to do with the Occult is rather unclear except that at the time this was released, homosexuality was still relatively ""taboo"" in mainstream society - probably included here for shock value.

3. A supposed ""Voodoo fertility rite"" to regain the fecundity of a young warrior, which predictably erupts into an orgy. The most gratuitously amusing part of it all is probably ""The End""...

7989062,5,B000093NSP,"For the sexually curious. And the attitude of those not part of LaVey's world is surprisingly null. The books and LaVey are  pleasing enough to those who take the occult seriously. It is surprising that LaVey considers a lot of magic practitioners to be an erroneous lot. He is scholarly, to say the least, but he honestly enjoys the physical and iconic, since we are given life. So, enjoy. Everyone, no matter what you worship. And considering that God used to fight the oppressors in life, but now seems to be the oppressor, it is a faith in living and its rewards that is something we all should practice -- within legal allowances.",1494806400,,635,4.619469026548672
7989063,3,B000093NSP,"For those who are already familiar with LaVey's Church of Satan and just want to see what he looked like in action, and what went on in the Black House, this is a cool documentary to watch. There are a few good interview snippets, mostly with LaVey, which show that he was a thinking, well spoken man with a unique appeal. Other interviews include reactions of neighbours as well as active Church members and friends of LaVey.

As l mentioned, it is interesting to watch if you like the subject matter already. However it's pretty poorly produced and fairly bland in its presentation. Many of the interviews are of inconsequential, random people and are rambling, uncoordinated and awkward. There's a total lack of any editing or tweaking of the footage for viewing. There is no soundtrack, or transitions between cuts. Even during the rituals, presumably the more exciting part of the documentary, the average person could easily lose interest and tire of it as it drags on, almost tediously.

Satanis: The Devil's Mass is basically uncut, uncinematic video footage solely for historically educational purposes. There is very little, if any, entertainment value to it except for someone particularly fascinated by the Church of Satan and its origin.",1491523200,,1250,5.033816425120773
