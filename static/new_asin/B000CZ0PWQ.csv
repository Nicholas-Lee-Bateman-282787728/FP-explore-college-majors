8102325,5,B000CZ0PWQ,A perfect gay hero. Done on the level of non porn. Good for the whole family with enough easter eggs to make all geeks smile .A+++,1499040000,,130,4.038461538461538
8102326,5,B000CZ0PWQ,"This was a really fun movie for those with a good sense of humor and enjoyment of the great passion that obviously went into this.  The acting was a bit Ed Wood in places, but that just made it all the more charming.  It was nice to see a gay super-hero where that was just a given.....it wasn't even called out.  Three of us watched this together, and we all thought it was a lot of fun for people with good humor and an understanding of comic book nerdery.  If you're smart enough to get ""Big Bang"", you'll love this!!!  I'm shocked I've never heard about this before, and also shocked at the other poor reviews.  This is EASILY the most fun superhero movie that I've seen.....much more entertaining than all the formulaic crap that shows up at the local mall. Hope the sequel is really coming!!!",1406419200,,798,4.394557823129252
8102327,3,B000CZ0PWQ,"My review of this movie is not a very good review in that yes, I wanted this DVD only for the fact that I didn't get the chance to see it in the theaters when if first came out.  But I bought this DVD hoping that if it was in Widescreen, its aspect ratio would've been something like 1:85 or less(you have to know literally about DVD terminology to know what I'm talking about).  When I received this DVD in the mail, I immediately popped it into my DVD recorder and started to watch it.  I found that it was in its original widescreen format(being 2:35)and that I couldn't get rid of those stupid ""black bars"" on the top and bottom of the movie.  i HATE WATCHING DVD MOVIES WITH THAT SITUATION ALWAYS BEING THERE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  If anyone reads this review and knows what I'm talking about, this DVD should be taken back to the Editing Room and brought out to DVD in an aspect ratio of 1:85 or less.  Again, that's just my opinion",1368057600,,936,4.350574712643678
8102328,2,B000CZ0PWQ,"I try to avoid making general statements about the quality of acting in gay films, as it's usually somewhat sub-par, or should I say sometimes sub-par acting is okay if everything else falls together and then you have a decent film.

Not here.

Every scene feels like a bad high school play.  I can't believe all these semi-stars showed up for this terrible mess.  I feel especially bad for Michelle Nichols, clearly out of everyone's acting league here.  Hers is the only decent acting during the entirety of this film. And the only few moments when you feel some sincerity and, perhaps, some meaning in all the messiness here.

There are a couple cute guys, and some nice costumes, and lots of nods to comic books.  This is a rental, purely.  I doubt you'll want to see it more than once.",1162684800,5,790,4.553191489361702
8102329,2,B000CZ0PWQ,"Not knowing this is a gay movie, my friends and I rented this flick for a beer and movie night. Now, we've watched some BAD movies (check out Scorpio Maximus). Surge of Power was cheesey enough that we were able to laugh at it the entire way through. This movie can be funny if you don't mind laughing through one long gay joke.",1160870400,4,328,4.222222222222222
8102330,1,B000CZ0PWQ,"While I am a fan of independent films since they allow talent that otherwise would go unnoticed to be seen, I was extemely dissappointed in this film which had the potential to become a classic. Instead we had banal dialogue,horrific acting, and clumsy editing which butchered any hope of making this a worthwhile endeavor. In fact, it seemed as if I was watching a fairly decent gay porn movie BUT WITHOUT THE PORN.  Almost every scene seemed to be a set up for a sexual encouter which never came.  The costume party scene could easily have been a faily decent orgy scene among those super heroes.  THAT would have been interesting.  Poor Nichelle Nichols oviously had no idea what she was getting into.  Her five minute scene provided the only decent acting (she was Greta Garbo compared to the other actors).  The whole movie would have been much better if every scene was of the caliber of her scene.  The costumes were fine and the special effects were cute and would have really shined if the film was not reminiscent of a home movie.",1149984000,6,1040,4.619565217391305
8102331,3,B000CZ0PWQ,"This film really does recall the feel of the old ""Batman"" tv show and the really bad 70's superhero films like ""Spiderman"" and ""Captain America"".  The dialogue is campy, and it's meant to be.  The effects and ""fights"" fall into the same category.  I was awaiting the colorful and cartoonish ""POW"" effects to pop up on the screen.  Think ""Legends of the Superheroes"" (if you can find it!).

There was also definitely a pop culture element to it.  A lot of references to modern superheroes.  And the discussion of the cape (as well as showing its pitfalls!).  Ahhh, reminiscent of ""The Incredibles"".  Ths isn't the big-budget superhero flicks like the ""X-Men"" or ""Spiderman"", and it's not meant to be.  You're warned.  And the geek factor was present.  I loved the scene where the comic-book geeks get smacked down by the jocks, only to hear the jocks talk about playing on their X-Boxes.  Priceless... ""Why can they play X Box, but we can't read comic books?"" And let us not forget our faithful hero doing the ""Wonder Woman Spin"".  Again, priceless.

There were times, however, when this film went waaaay over the top.  I respect the fact it's a small, indie, gay flick.  And I appreciate it, Lord knows as a gay comic book fan I've been let down several times by Marvel's ""gay"" characters like Northstar, Karma, and Sunpyre.  But there were times when I felt like it was ""too gay"".  The double entendres got a bit tiresome after a bit, like a bad skit drug out too long.  So I can see why some folks will be turned off by the movie.

It was a fun little film, didn't take itself too seriously, I can see some of my friends and I in it, but it needed to lay off the social agenda a bit.  So three stars.",1147996800,7,1702,4.440129449838188
8102332,1,B000CZ0PWQ,"Misleading. Boring. Thought it would be a fun movie for the family. Terrible acting,lousy dialogue, and directing. Social interactions only between men. No females other than a bit part with Nichelle Nichols. The DVD cover was quite misleading. I wish I could get my money back. What a disappointment.",1146009600,3,301,5.163265306122449
8102333,5,B000CZ0PWQ,"I was at the premiere screening in L.A., where they also showed the ""behind-the-scenes"" featurette that will be on the DVD, so think I have a good idea of what the DVD will be like even though it isn't out yet as I write this. The film was much better than I expected given how it was marketed as ""low-budget"". Yes, the effects are very low budget, but presented in a campy, funny way. There are lots of hilarious references to popular culture comic book superheros like Spiderman, Batman, and Superman, that had the audience laughing in stitches. Although the film is marketed as ""the first (***) superhero movie"", it really is not a film just for a (***) audience, but rather a superhero comedy where the hero happens to be (***). There are also great performances by several celebrities: Nichelle Nichols (Uhura from Star Trek) who gives a divine & classy performance here, plus the very cute grandma-ish Noel Neill (Lois Lane from the Adventures of Superman), Lou Ferrigno (The Hulk), and the always annoyingly queenie Bobby Trendy (Anna Nicole Show). As long as you go into the film knowing you should not take it seriously and that it is just amusing low-brow fun, then you'll like it. I would compare it in style to the 60's Batman TV series. I left the screening wishing there was a ""Surge of Power 2"" coming out as I really enjoyed the characters.",1143504000,6,1356,4.630705394190872
