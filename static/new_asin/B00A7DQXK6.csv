I've known about this film for many decades and have seen it numerous times on TV, but this is the first time I purchased it, and it was as a gift
for a church musician friend.  (Inconsequential spoiler alert, and possible enticement for potential viewers.)  My 75 y/o friend said, ""It's one of the worst movies I've ever seen!""  He gave it back!!  Now it's mine, all mine...!  I highly recommend it!",1420848000,2,624,4.9326923076923075

Dubs are ""best available source"" and can vary from very good to only fair. Audio levels are however some of the highest you'll find, which makes these ideal for laptop PC or portable disc player watching.

CARNIVAL OF SOULS is a 'B' picture masterpiece from a director whose previous experience was limited to making industrial shorts. Herk Harvey also wrote the story and appears as a spectral man that the central character (portrayed by Candace Hilligoss) sees at the most unexpected moments. Its twist ending has since been overused to the point of tedium, but ""Carnival"" may have been the first to use it.

Here, the sole survivor of a car plunge off a bridge into a river pulls up stakes and drives west in her 1960 Chevy Biscayne, to fill a job as a church organist. The morose and withdrawn young lady has unexplained visions of a dead person and she's inexplicably attracted to an abandoned amusement park located along a dried-up area of Utah's Great Salt Lake. What she finds there explains both her hallucinations and fate. This unforgettable sequence at the dance pavillion is chillingly surreal.

Parenthetical number preceding title is a 1 to 10 IMDb viewer poll rating.
