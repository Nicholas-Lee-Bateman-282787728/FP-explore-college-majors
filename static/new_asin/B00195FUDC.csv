3423002,4,B00195FUDC,"I usually avoid blood and guts type films like the plague, but Doomsday is a movie that makes the effort not to take its self too seriously! There are so many hysterically campy moments in this film I was practically jumping up and down in my seat at one point! And you really want the bad guys to lose in a very big way!

This is obviously a Mad Max remake. I think it's much better with a woman playing the role as hero. Doomsday also has more complexity. There's three sets of different types of bad guys. And a lot more is at stake this time, its not just the main characters' lives!

Sure, I could do without some of the gruesome violence, the reason for 4 stars instead of 5. But I have quick reflexes, and I don't hesitate to close my eyes when the need arises. A good habit to have these days when going to the movies! But unlike so many, many movies, the violence does not ruin this story! You really end-up caring about the good guys! You don't have any mixed feelings. This is a black and white world! Stupid, cruel and narrow minded villains - get the heck out of the way!",1205625600,4,1084,4.181818181818182

If you want novelty, or even plausibility, you probably ended up in the wrong theater by mistake.

So just take it for what it is: commodity entertainment, a bit bloodier than some but not off the charts, and where people keep their clothes on. Some days, I just want an adventure flick with nothing much to think about, except maybe how good Maj. Sinclair looks in that tight outfit. If that's what you're after, then ""mission accomplished.""

3423004,3,B00195FUDC,"""Doomsday"" is intriguing, I guess, but it doesn't really give us anything new as far as plot and genre are concerned. Everything from ""Resident Evil"" to ""28 Days Later"" to ""I Am Legend"" to ""Escape from New York"" to the ""Mad Max"" films are sampled to some degree, and this is annoying because ""Doomsday"" isn't a spoof or even a tribute. It's really just a rip off, and what's worse, it's a rip off that focuses more violence than on story. There's pretty much nothing to get out of it, save for a few fun moments of blood and gore. I'm not going to say that this is a bad film, because the idea it's founded on has been successfully done before. But I will say that it's unflatteringly unoriginal, meaning there's no need for you to pay for a ticket to see it. Trust me, you've seen it before.

Here's the foundation of the plot: in the year 2008, a deadly infection called the Reaper Virus forced the British government to seal off Scotland from the rest of the United Kingdom. (Other than the fact that the Reaper Virus leads to an outbreak of open sores on a person's face, I'm not exactly sure how it works. It's never explained.) By 2035, England is in social and political ruin, and what's worse, the Reaper Virus was not as contained as everyone thought; people in London are showing signs of infection after nearly thirty years of being disease free. Satellite photos reveal that not everyone in quarantined Scotland has died--if anything, that area is swarming with survivors, and according to a voiceover narration, they've been reduced to the behaviors of primal beasts. The most important among the survivors is Dr. Marcus Kane, a scientist who, if found, may be able to finish finding a cure for the Reaper Virus.

This leads us to the film's actual plot: military officer Eden Sinclair (Rhona Mitra) is assigned by Prime Minister John Hatcher (Alexander Siddig) to lead a task force into Scotland and find Kane. Everything seems straightforward enough, but as you know, something has to go wrong in order for the story to get interesting. While searching through a dilapidated hospital, Sinclair and her squad are attacked and taken prisoner by a band of crazed, murderous, punk-like cannibals. I know we've seen this before: characters whose years of isolation led to a new and completely warped sense of community. Anyway, the apparent leader of this band is Sol (Craig Conway), a loud, violent man who has no qualms about using Sinclair as a punching bag. He also doesn't seem to have a problem with roasting a living man over an open flame. Neither do the spectators, who cheer as they swarm up to the charred body and tear off slabs of flesh to eat.

Using all her military training, Sinclair breaks free from her holding cell along with Cally (MyAnna Buring), a young woman claiming to be Kane's daughter. After a long-winded and bloody escape from Sol's compound, Cally explains that, although she can point the way to her father, she can't actually take Sinclair there. This is because, apparently, Kane is not the man he used to be. The audience discovers this soon enough; in a remote wooded area, an armored executioner rides in on a white horse, after which he takes everyone prisoner. We then finally meet the mysterious Marcus Kane (Malcom McDowell), now the cold-hearted leader of yet another band of Rage Virus survivors. Behind the walls of a remote, ancient castle, Kane is no longer interested in helping anyone--he's perfectly content staying where he is while keeping everyone else out. The fact that Sinclair crossed into Scotland is bad enough; now the British government actually wants him to save lives. This begs the question: Have Sinclair's actions all been for naught?

This question may not be necessary, especially with scene after scene of bloodshed to keep the audience entertained. ""Doomsday"" relies so heavily on such scenes that pretty much everything else is secondary. Even a spur-of-the-moment car chase near the end of the film isn't as visually assaulting. It does come close, though; Sol and his posse have caught up with Sinclair at that point, meaning that more than a few people will lose their lives in the most violent of ways. But despite these unnecessary moments, the real problems of this film stem from a lack of originality. Everything I've described has been done before with varying degrees of success, so I'm at a loss to explain why it all had to be done again.

And then there's Sinclair, whose back-story is painfully underdeveloped. The film begins in 2008 when she was only a toddler, no older than three: in an act of selflessness, her mother saw her off in a military helicopter along with an address written on an envelope. Not much is explained afterwards, which is bad since we suspect her behavior towards her friend, Bill Nelson (Bob Hoskins), is somehow related. I'm not entirely sure why they made an attempt at human drama in the first place. If a post-apocalyptic gore fest is what they wanted to make--and I suspect that they did--then they should have pushed the drama aside, opting instead for even more shots of decapitations and spurting blood. Then again, that probably wouldn't have made ""Doomsday"" any better. It certainly wouldn't have made it original, which is what I wanted from this film above all else. I also would have appreciated an ending that didn't go for the obvious sting of social commentary; it's been done far too many times, and by now, it's just plain ridiculous.",1205539200,3,5475,4.783298097251586
3423005,4,B00195FUDC,"A great debut with Dog Soldiers, then the even better second film The Descent, and now the cherry on top called Doomsday. I just got back from seeing this film and it was a wild and crazy ride from start to finish. Sure it borrows quite a bit from Escape from New York and Road Warrior, but it is still unique enough to seperate itself from those movies. Rhona Mitra makes one sexy, tough and believable action chick. I didn't know if she could pull this kind of role off, but it worked for me.

Doomsday isn't going to win any awards and it's not better than The Descent or Dog Soldiers, but if you like your movies with plenty of action and gore, check it out and prepare to have a blast.

3 and 1/2 out of 5 stars",1205452800,19,716,4.107142857142857
3423026,4,B00195FUDC,"Okay, its not a great movie.  Its questionable whether its even a good movie.  The plot is literally all over the place, biting off more than it can chew.  The director Neil Marshall actually bragged about all the movies he ripped off and referenced in this mishmash of violent discord.  From the obviousMad Max and Escape from New York, to Excalibur, The Warriors, No Blade of Grass, The Omega Man, Waterworld, Gladiator, Metalstorm, Zulu, and A Boy and His Dog.  Apparently, he thought this was a tribute to post-apocalyptic movies.  He probably shoved the scripts to all of the above-mentioned films into a blender and this is what came out.  With poor Rhona Mitra expected to be Snake Plissken, right down to the eye patch and fancy removable eyeball.

The results are not quite this or that, but they are fun in a shockingly inept fashion.  Theres even a musical interlude, I think Marshall got mixed up and referenced Camelot instead of Excalibur.",1508284800,2,953,4.7975460122699385

Rhona Mitra does a fine job of portraying what is otherwise a generic role of a police commando, and McDowell, also does well in his brief appearance as a medical researcher who's morphed into a Hitler clone. But really I would just avoid this one, the original inspiration movies above are better. I mean for example, with the plague survivors so supposedly starved that they have (graphically shown ) turned cannibal, why do they all look so well fed and healthy?",1505520000,,582,4.762376237623762

This movie has a surprising amount of recognizable actors. The script is poor quality, but the cinematography, acting, and plot are pretty good. I would say this is a high quality B movie.

The first 5 or so minutes of the movie are really bad. If you find yourself starting to turn it off after the first few minutes I recommend waiting until they get past the introduction. If the entire movie were like the first 5 minute I would not recommend watching it, but it does get better.",1505260800,,600,4.495412844036697

3423035,4,B00195FUDC,"It's ""Escape From New York"" meets ""The Road Warrior"" by way of ""28 Days Later"" in ""Doomsday"". Director Neil Marshall's (""The Descent"") post-apocalyptic homage to the above mentioned (and more) plays it pretty fast and loose with plot and logic, never once slowing down for character-building as it jumps from one wild set piece to another. It's a film that seemingly has no attention span, never feels terribly cohesive, and yet never fails to entertain.

It's the year 2035 and a virus has all but decimated Scotland. In an attempt to contain and control the virus, the government builds a wall separating the ravaged country from the rest of Britain. Presumably, they made Scotland's ravaged population pay for the wall themselves. Enter hardened officer Eden Sinclair, as played by Rhona Mitra. Part Sarah Connor, part Snake Plissken, Sinclair (and her faceless team) is tasked with re-entering the ravaged region to hunt down a possible cure for the virus. Along the way, she matches wits with the locals who include but are not limited to a group of ""Mad Max"" rejects and a game Malcolm McDowell (who also provides the film's lengthy expository narration). Butts are kicked and blood is shed, to say the least.

Marshall knows what kind of film he is making and he also knows you've seen this film a hundred times before. Appropriately, he takes glee in his film's excess, going full Paul Verhoeven at times in embracing over-the-top gore and laugh-out-loud ultra-violence. This is a film made for the genre fan whose bread is buttered by '80s action, sci-fi and horror. It's pure homage of the highest order; a grindhouse-esque onslaught of tackiness and titillating tension. ""Doomsday"" never quite rises above its source material, and that's OK. As far as mindless, late-night entertainment goes, few modern films get the formula down as well as this glorious cheesefest does.",1499558400,,1883,5.032051282051282

3423080,2,B00195FUDC,"From the Director of The Descent and Dog Soldiers. 2 B-flicks that I enjoyed and so I was looking forward to some mindless fun here. It has a sizeable cast of solid actors too like Bob Hoskins, and Malcom McDowell while Rhona Mitra is always nice to look at and she is especially buff in this film. So why do I think the other 2 films are better than this one? I think it has to do with scope. The other 2 where much narrower in scope and focused in on the characters and situation better. Doomsday tries to be a larger film with too many borrowed ideas that it kind of collapses on itself. As others have mentioned this has the post apocalyptic gang types of Mad Max, the Escape from New York plot, the pathogen/plague from Resident Evil with Rhona Mitra as the kickbutt heroine instead of Milla Jovovich, plus there are some scifi elements too if that's not enough. It started off fine and I liked the electronic eye, but then it took a weird arse turn into Camelot (I kid you not) that had me almost crying for the actors and laughing at the dumbness of it all. Maybe if in the film someone had called them out on the absurdity it would have been a fun kind of moment, but no everyone was so serious about it. Then there was people dying in slow motion and pausing and then continuing to die in slow motion. I felt like a little piece of my soul was dying in slow motion after realizing that I payed to watch this (well actually used some credit that amazon gave me for slow shipping but I still feel gipped, lol). Ha, ha don't get me started on the car that's been sitting for 30 years and its battery still works (nice looking car tho). Aside with the ridiculousness of the story, there is an issue with the music (the music is fun) and that is that at several times in the film its louder and drowns out the dialogue. This was also mentioned on the Blu-ray review at Blu-ray**m website.

Anyways, if you like stupid fun this maybe your cup of tea, if you prefer your guilty pleasure stupid fun to be a little clever then you could be disappointed with this one.",1462752000,,2067,4.259541984732825

I am a huge fan of this director. Dog Soldiers was a mind-blowingly awesome movie and you actually get to see a couple of the actors from that in this (Spoon!!! <3). The Descent I was obsessed with since the first moment I saw it in Theaters (the version without the wakeup) and immediately bought it when it came out on DVD. Neil Marshall has done it again with this movie. It doesn't have a supernatural flair like Dog Soldiers or a horror monster horde like the Descent, but it still stands on it's own and I believe is on the same level as it's predecessors.

To avoid spoilers I can't really go into much depth about the content itself. The main character is a female protagonist (whom I have a total fangirl crush on) played by Rhona Mitra and the movie touches on her history a bit, which helps the atmosphere of the movie. It's a wonderful mix of modern with medieval and apocalyptic with explosions and car chases. Malcom MacDowell, of course, plays his role excellently. All of the actors did wonderful and even the characters you hate you love to hate.

Really can't say much more about it. The DVD I purchased was brand new, in good condition and not a scratch on the disc. A solid purchase. I shall enjoy wearing this out like I have my Dog Soldiers and The Descent DVDs.

So I definitely suggest purchasing and if you don't like it, you're only out 10 bucks.

 Rhona Mitra had not quite turned 30 when she stared as a one eyed operative in this apocalyptic action/thriller.  She easily pulled off the role with her energy, grim grit and her athleticism.  She has a definite female attraction, which we take as a bonus, except perhaps on the occasions when she pops out her artificial eye and uses it as a detached spy-ball.
 In the horrible (sad and grim not ill told) story, Scotland suffers an outbreak of a highly contagious and incurable plague.  The clever, heartless, soul-less rulers of Britain simply re-create Hadrian's Wall across the Scotland-England border and let the contagion burn out.  All goes well for about 30 years while a little girl survivor with one eye plucked out grows up and joins the government forces.  She has nerves of steel, a deadly aim and she can whip her weight in rabid Dingos or anything else.
 Eden, Major Sinclair, takes a group of government operators across the wall when satellite pictures show survivors where there should be none.  Lots of fighting, explosions and general running and killing transpire.  Think of a post apocalypse world where the Picts merge with Mad Max and you get the flavor of things.
 Writer/Director Neil Marshall made a movie for us that has all the plot, all the action and more than all of the bright colors and loud noises that we like in action films.  What he didn't bring us is heart.  We get a back story for Eden but we never feel like we know her.  We do not become her friend, much less her intimate.  He also directed Dog Soldiers, The Descent and Centurion.  I have seen The Descent and Centurion.  Both of them are of a cut with Doomsday in that they both have excellent production values, both have many interesting, scary or cool things about them and neither have a throbbing heart for us to listen to.  Like its fellows, Doomsday is so forgettable that after the last credit scrolls by, we think of it never again.  I can only think that Marshall and his producers knew exactly what they wanted to accomplish because he has also directed episodes for TVs Black Sails and Game of Thrones which are famous for the depth of the characters.
 Even supporting roles by Bob Hoskins and Malcolm McDowell cannot bring this game but heartless action flick more than two stars.  A pity that.
 R rated for gore, nudity and very casual murder in exotic ways, the film lasts for one hour and 45 minutes.",1431475200,,2433,4.646370023419204

I was even more excited to know Rhona Mitra was the protagonist, because she always delivers a great performance and of course, she's quite easy on the eyes.

While this movie isn't as good as other Neil Marshall movies, it still stands out to me as one of the more enjoyable movies within its genre.  The movie is very bloody and graphic, the production is well done (special effects are decent), and the acting is quite good from all roles, minor or major.

The action begins immediately, so you're hooked from the beginning.  There are a couple plot twists that prevent the movie from going stale.  Also, I have to say there is a strange, morbid sense of humor to the movie that I can't help but enjoy.  I'm not promising the moon here, but if you're a fan of the older Mad Max movies, you'll quickly realize this was Neil Marshall's tribute to the style.

3423184,1,B00195FUDC,"I found this movie because I love Dog Soldiers, I read the reviews and truly tried to just ""sit back and enjoy the ride."" Sadly I would need a partial lobotomy to enjoy this movie.  It just makes no sense at all.  The first scene that appaled me was when they first get over the wall and end up in a giant herd of cattle.  Now up to this point we've been told people ran out of food and were forced into cannabilsm.  I know city folk may lack survival skills, but surely mankind would figure out to eat the bountiful amount of cattle before they eat each other?  Maybe the decided to only use them for leather, since full gimp costumes are apparently needed in the future.
The next appalling thing is that I am expected to accept that humans have divided into either Renissance era people, in full period costumes, or 80's punk rockers.  Surely when society degrades we will have teams of seamstresses working round the clock to make these outfits while we struggle for survival.
The punk rock kids not only have cool leather outfits and makeup, they have full on rock concerts complete with aerial acrobats and pole dancers.
Okay, so after swallowing that pill, I am to believe that anytime our heroine stands her ground and gives a pouty defiant look she will not be killed, even though her pursuers were on a murderous rampage seconds before.  I also need to believe armored vehicles have easily broken windshields and cannot survive a Molotov cocktail attack (our soldiers would be in trouble if this was true).
Then there is the gratuitous car chase scenes where the car is miraculously unscathed after every encounter, even after it splits a bus in half and bursts it into flames!  (Of course every crash results in giant fireballs.)
I could go on, as my complaints of ridiculousness are many, suffice to say I am saddened that some of my favorite characters from Dog Soldiers participated in this movie.  You could not pay me to watch it again.",1394323200,2,1951,4.583333333333333

3423204,4,B00195FUDC,"""Doomsday"" is great! This is how the story goes: The year is 2008, and a pandemic threatens to wipe out the whole of the human race. For many in the United Kingdom--the epicenter of the outbreak--the end is nigh, so why bother to keep count? Within days of detection of the Reaper virus millions are infected in Scotland, the killer disease's home turf. Government has no choice but to declare the country a ""hot zone"" and quarantine the populace in hopes of containing the Reaper's spread. What was once Scotland is now a forgotten No Man's Land, with the Reaper given free reign to annihilate the population sealed inside. A quarter of a century later, with a new outbreak of the Reaper resurfacing in London, it becomes apparent that the government's best laid plans have gone completely, bloody awry. Department of Domestic Security (DDS) Chief Bill Nelson is summoned to meet with the prime minister and the true power behind his office, Michael Canaris, who reveal satellite photos of Reaper survivors in the hot zone. And survivors must mean there's a cure. Nelson quickly assembles a crack team of specialists to venture into the forsaken land and retrieve the counteragent to the virus. For the tough and efficient commanding officer, Major Eden Sinclair, the assignment represents a disquieting homecoming. Twenty-five years earlier, she had been shoved into one of the last evacuating military choppers and flown to safety--forced to leave her mother behind. Once on the other side of the immediately re-secured border, the squadron is on its own, venturing into a ghoulish terrain of corpse-strewn, forlorn cities. All too soon, however, the crew meets up with a pack of feral survivors, and finds itself unwittingly standing in for the callous government that turned its back years before. The cast led by Rhona Mitra is great! The story and screenplay and film editing and directing by Neil Marshall (who also directed and wrote the story and screenplay to ""The Descent"" (2006) & ""Dog Soldiers"" (2002), also film edited ""Dog Soldiers"") is excellent! The music by Tyler Bates (who also did the music to the upcoming ""Watchmen"" (2009), he also did the music to ""Halloween"" (2007), ""300"" (2007), ""Slither"" (2006), ""The Devil's Rejects"" (2005), & ""Dawn Of The Dead"" (2004) is excellent! The cinematography by Sam McCurdy (who also did the cinematography to ""Dog Soldiers"", ""The Descent"", & ""The Hills Have Eyes II"" (2007) is excellent! The film editing by Andrew MacRitchie (who also did the film editing to ""Die Another Day"" (2002) & Marshall is great! The production design by Simon Bowles (who also did the production design to ""The Descent"", ""Dog Soldiers"", & the upcoming ""The Descent 2"" (2009) is excellent! The art direction by Susan Collin, David Doran, Jonathan Hely-Hutchinson, Rhian Nicholas, Emer O'Sullivan, Andy Thomson, & John Trafford is excellent! The set decoration by Mark Auret & Zoe Smith is excellent! The costume design by John Norster is great! This is an great action-thriller that keeps you on the edge of your seat.

3423205,1,B00195FUDC,"The movie is so-so and the special features are great, especially U-Control ... when they work, which brings me to the reason I made this review, or rather angry rant! I don't know who was in charge of inspecting the Blu-ray version for bugs, but that person should be fired and banned from ever supervising a disc development again! The movie's features and settings are activated via an extremely moody pop-up menu that has a tendency to not show up, and since there is no top menu, you'll have to completely restart the disc if you want to access features such as bookmarks. specific chapters, and U-Control. Remember to check the timer beforehand though, because this movie does not pick up where it left off. This could have been a great disc if not for the technical flaws screwing it up. On the bright side, you can still change the subtitles and skip chapters if your remote has working buttons that let you do so.

3423208,3,B00195FUDC,"Most people love the occasional action flick, with lots of adrenaline, tough heroes, terrible villains and quest like plot.

Doomsday will not disappoint on the above mentioned attributes. Jumping from action scene to action scene in a non-stop move this film will keep you on the edge (and you won't fall asleep), the heroine is a gorgeous stylized super cop with a mission, the villains are wonderful caricatures of corrupt powers behind the throne, weak leaders, crazy leaders and totalitarian leaders.

Many references to other films of the genre, some remarkable scenes (like cooking time), did I already mentioned that the heroine is gorgeous? You will also find very nice extras on the DVD.

You will have a fun evening with this movie if, and only if, you can suspend your reasoning and logic for a while. There is absolutely no sense. After a great beginning and background presenting, everything starts crumbling, and you don't want to use your brain or else you might get damage trying to find the inherent logic of the plot (spoilers ahead, beware).

So the British government had satellites spying the contaminated area (Scotland) for more than thirty years and only in the last three they saw a few survivors in Glasgow...but they have Rock concerts with electric lights, races with dozens of cars and trucks (where do they got the gas for more than thirty years?), a medieval civilization sprouted. Those Satellites need a few optical adjustments.

The surviving locals reverted to cannibalism with cows everywhere.

A parked car untouched for dozens of years just needs gas to get started...right.

Two guys on foot can outrun motorcycles for a couple of minutes; great legs.

Old, very old ""cars"" can keep up with a state of the art Bentley on an open road.

A Heavily armored vehicle (almost impenetrable like the specialist refers in the film) has its armored glass broken by some stone and then the driver is killed by a crossbow bolt!!!

Poor heroine; every villain knows where she is.

Poor heroine; she must remove her eye to use a camera to do what most gadgets nowadays can do without fuss.

Strange maniacal villains that suddenly got very cowardly in a chicken test.

There are so many other silliness that you must really see for yourself. This isn't doomsday, it's dumbsday.",1362528000,,2303,4.904639175257732

They missed many good opportunities that could have been explored, like they could have done so much with the fallout shelter they found, and the concept of what would happen to the survivors and the dynamic of how to reestablish a society in a case like this was an interesting thought, but they rushed through things that could have made the story more believable and interesting, instead going for shock and gore over a good plot.

This is obviously a Mad Max remake. I think it's much better with a woman playing the role as hero. Doomsday also has more complexity. There's three sets of different types of bad guys. And a lot more is at stake this time, its not just the main characters' lives!

Sure, I could do without some of the gruesome violence. But I have quick reflexes, and I don't hesitate to close my eyes when the need arises. A good habit to have these days when going to the movies! But unlike so many, many movies, the violence does not ruin this story! You really end-up caring about the good guys!

3423224,3,B00195FUDC,"Doomsday(released Mar/08)has a stellar cast of actors in Bob Hoskins as Bill Nelson,an official,Malcolm McDowell as Dr. Marcus Kane,Alexander Siddig as Prime Minister John Hatcher(formerly Siddig El Fadil from DS9),David O'Hara as Michael Canaris,a senior official,Craig Conway as Sol,Rhona Mitra as Major Eden Sinclair and others. The cast is solid but the plot here meanders more than one would like and is yet ANOTHER version of a post apocalyptic world gone bad,due to an unleashed virus. If I had a nickel for every post apocalyptic/virus/zombie film that has been produced within the last decade,I would be a millionaire. Some do it better than others and put their unique stamp/slant on it,but,unfortunately,not this one.
The plot involves that virus I mentioned doing its thing in Great Britain. The government builds a wall about 3/4 the way up the island,isolating much of northern England and all of Scotland. It is a no fly zone and no one can get in or out. Some satellites have been keeping an eye on things in the zone and it seems there are survivors walking the streets in Glasgow. Top that with a viral outbreak in London,and the government dispatches a team to go to Glasgow to locate a Dr. Kane who may be able to provide them with an antidote.
The team,led by Major Sinclair,heads into the wastelands and finally into Glasgow proper. They are searching a hospital,the doctors last known location,when they are jumped. Alot of the team are killed,while Sinclair and others are captured by leader Sol,who commands the cities occupants. While Sol puts on a ""show"" for the populace,in which one of Sinclair's team is roasted alive and eaten(!),Sinclair,along with the daughter of Dr. Kane,is rescued and they barely escape Glasgow aboard a train. They end up at the end of the line and in a forest,where they are soon surrounded and again taken captive by Dr Kane. It seems the good doctor has abandoned all hope of a cure and now leads a band of men who are untouched by the virus or its effects. They ride horses,and live a medieval life,right down to the clothes and armour.
Sinclair battles one of Kane's champions and kills him. Shortly after the small band escapes south,finding a stash of materiel,including a posh Bentley,which they use as their lift back home. Approaching the outskirts of Glasgow,Sol and his boys(ala Mad Max)pursue the team relentlessly down the highway. Through some harrowing moments they finally make it out alive. A helicopter lands in front of the car and out pops Mr. Canaris,who is now the new Prime Minister. Sinclair presents Dr Kanes daughter as the antidote and she stays behind. Sinclair returns to her home before the outbreak,then obtains the severed head of Glasgow's late leader,Sol;killed during his pursuit of her earlier. She throws the head down before a hushed crowd and proclaims herself their new leader.
The ending is a bit iffy,if you consider that just days before they were all literally after HER head on a platter. Because she shows up with their ex leaders head,that's enough to make her their instant leader? Dunno. There is a scene earlier in the movie where a team from an APC(armoured personnel carrier) exit,dressed in environmental suits,presumably because the air is also contaminated. Well there are guys in the APC exposed to the air as they aren't wearing any suits. Does that make sense? The character of Sinclair could have easily been played by Kate Beckinsale, as Rhona Mitra seems to be doing her best to channel Kate all the way through the film,in action and look. The film itself could really be broken into three parts,the city of London,the city of Glasgow and the countryside of northern Scotland. The plot is very predictable and meanders far too much,not creating much excitement at any given time. And that group of Glasgow misfits dressed and riding cars ala Mad Max? Guys,you should have left it out,because Mad Max,and the two follow ups,did a much BETTER job at it than you tried to do;and on a much lower budget!.Of note,Jon Pertwee's son Sean makes an appearance here as part of Sinclair's team;the one that gets ultimately roasted alive.
Technically the film is in its w/s a/r of 2:35:1 and is clear and crisp. Extras include three featurettes.
All in all a been there-done that film that will have you yawning and looking at your watch more often than not. The cast is a good one ,but they have little to work with here. Comme si,comme ca;take it or leave it.",1350259200,2,4466,4.869908015768726
3423225,4,B00195FUDC,"You've seen all the pieces before. The country has fallen into lawlessness, where warlords with bad haircuts rule their fiefdoms (as in Mad Max, to name just one of many). There are the government officials trying desperately to save his bu... I mean, career (My Fellow Americans). There's the insanely contagious and deadly virus (28 Days Later). And there's the way-cool babe with a gun and an attitude (Resident Evil) leading her small but brave band through it all. Oh, and a little comedic banter (any Bond film), but not enough to change the tone of the film. If you want novelty, or even plausibility, you probably ended up in the wrong theater by mistake.

So just take it for what it is: commodity entertainment, a bit bloodier than some but not off the charts, and where people keep their clothes on. Some days, I just want an adventure flick with nothing much to think about, except maybe how good Maj. Sinclair looks in that tight outfit.

3423226,3,B00195FUDC,"After watching all the four Neil Marshall's films I can say that without any doubt this one is the most violent but also the less successfull. I hesitated a lot how to rate ""Doomsday"", and I finally settled on the three stars because, as one of the previous reviewers advised, I decided to treat it as a very dark comedy, in which there is enough good elements to compensate most of the bad points. Some SPOILERS below.

Bad points.

1. The abysmally stupid scenario. Even for a B category action-movie, ""Doomsday"" has an extremely appaling scenario, in which absolutely NOTHING makes sense.

2. Plot holes. To avoid spoilers just a very minor example - in 2035 British Army heavy armored vehicles will have windows you can break with an AXE!?

3. The incredible violence and foul language. Keep this thing away from your teenage children - this thing is strictly for people over 18!

4. The permanent sentiment of ""deja vu"". This is mostly a remake of ""Escape from New York"", so close to the original that even the main hero is one-eyed, and at one moment she will find herself in an arena fighting a colossal warrior with a mace... This is also to a lesser extent a remake of ""Mad Max 2"" - the main villains look almost exactly like the road bandits from this film, with their leader, Sol, being a copy of Wez, just more heterosexual... There are also moments reminding of ""28 days later"".

Good points:

1. The humour. Quite fast it becomes rather clear, that this film doesn't try to take itself too seriously. The violence is so omnipresent and graphic, that it becomes almost funny. The tongue in cheek character of the film is frequently underlined by little jokes - me for one, I simply couldn't take seriously a bunch of cannibals riding in a bus on which they painted ""Out of f...ng service""...))) Also, when watching the ""fiesta"" Sol offers to his cannibal tribe, it is impossible to not laugh, even if there is human flesh on the menu...

2. Rhona Mitra. Is there any need to say more?

3. Viper, the sadistic concubine/second-in-command of Sol. This ""man eater"" (in a very literal meaning of the term) is a show in the show. Played by the sculpturaly gorgeous South African stunt-woman and model Lee-Anne Liebenberg, with her face covered by an elaborate Maori-style facial tattoo and her splendid chevelure held in place by arrows, she is simply irresistible. In fact, she is the reason I give this film a third star...

4. The ultimate scene. That one, I didn't see coming at all - and I am not saying anything more. Enjoy it by yourself!

Bottom line, this is a very strange and hard to rate film, more a very dark comedy than an action movie, certainly worth watching once (but rather amongst guys...) but still weaker than Neil Marshall's three other films (""Dog Soldiers"", ""Descent"" and ""Centurion"").",1347840000,,2819,4.663306451612903

Malcolm McDowell (A Clockwork Orange) plays the role of Dr. Kane, the foremost scientist who was researching a cure for this deadly disease which ultimately lead to the building and sealing of large barrier wall isolating Scotland from the rest of the population. Left to die, nearly 30 years later, Kane and many others survive only to be sought out once again by the British government in order to obtain any chance of a cure for the recently returned outbreak of the reaper virus on the English side of the wall. Major Sinclair and her crew (tasked to enter the long abandoned land outside the wall and obtain a cure) soon find themselves surrounded by marauders from a cannibalistic group of survivors.

I believe that Doomsday could have been a decent, to pretty good, post-apocalyptic action/suspense film had every good thing about not been done before. In fact, I'd even say I enjoyed it, but there's a difference between paying homage to previous works (e.g. Road Warrior and Mad Max, the Alien and Resident Evil series, 28 Days Later, and most of all, the Carpenter classic, Escape from New York), and copying because you lack the creativity to do something new. Sad to say Neil Marshall's Doomsday is the latter. The rookie director's third film is pretty much like all of his others, and depending on what side of the aisle you sit on, that could either be a good thing, or a bad thing. I happen to fall on the side of the naysayers.

I'm not a fan of his work, but I can tolerate it. I like movies with dark settings, tons of gratuitous gore (which is plentiful in the Unrated cut), and strong female leads. Not to mention, I didn't list a single film in the previous paragraph that I didn't enjoy, so this movie was right up my alley. The performances are dare I say, pretty good. Rhona Mitra is always fairly deadpan, but she's okay. The best work came from the supporting actors who survived the longest (without spoiling anything). Malcolm McDowell wasn't a standout, but he was a nice sight in a film where there are only a couple of recognizable B-level actors. I just wish it had not been so laden with genre cliches that it never had a chance to be its own movie. Even with all that being said, I'll revisit Doomsday in the future because it was a hell of a fun time. It didn't fail to accomplish its primary goal: entertain. I say rent it.",1341792000,3,1704,4.444089456869009
3423232,3,B00195FUDC,"Sometimes bands like to make tribute albums, where the whole thing is covering songs that influenced them or if they just like it, and in that way Doomsday is Neil Marshall's tribute movie. After giving us the action packed gore-fest Dog Soldiers and one of the scariest movies of the decade The Descent, he toned down the seriousness and turned up the fun for this one. The biggest mistake you as the audience can make is going into this with your brain turned on, but it's understandable if you did since his other movies were treated seriously.

It's kind of baffling really how many ideas are present in Doomsday that get tossed aside or forgotten, the whole virus thing, the U.K. getting infected, all of that was kind of a back slide to the strike team getting chased by the crazy Scottish people who remained. One can make a drinking game when Neil Marshall homages a movie, but you'll likely die of alcohol poisoning if you keep it up all the way to the end. The fact is this is just a bunch of scenes that Neil Marshall wanted to do without very much concern for the story or characters, and the whole thing shifts up so much the audience can either try to follow but be baffled/confused or you can turn your brain off and enjoy the ride.

The main actress I thought was terrible, she had the acting range of a plank and barely batted an eye when her whole squad died in front of her. The other squad members that make it past the first assault were far more interesting, especially the doctor or whoever that *spoi-ah screw it* doctor was that survived the whole thing. The villians were gloriously over-the-top, the woman was complteley tattoo'd up and looks like a circus freak, while the guy looks like the singer from the Prodigy who you can't really take seriously because of his get-up. The best part for me was the car chase scene near the end which shows me I HAVE to watch Mad Max 2, the whole scene was like an adreneline shot to the jugular.

3423250,4,B00195FUDC,"The backstory of Doomsday (2005) is radical, pretentious, and farfetched, but if you put aside most of these grand trappings, the film is a bold, hard-hitting, action, adventure, that rarely slows down.  Set in Great Britain in 2035, writer/director Neil Marshall's (The Decent, Dog Soldiers) film features conflict in a number of arenas, from urban warfare in the streets of Glasgow, to combat with medieval weaponry, to a mad chase on the country roads of Scotland.

Rhona Mitra delivers an impressive performance as Eden Sinclair, an agent of DDS (Department of Domestic Security) the Government's police force.  Cool under pressure, she is a ferocious fighter, and a survivor of the Reaper virus outbreak that struck Scotland when she was a child.  At that time, the Government erected a thirty foot high wall, stretching across the Scottish countryside, to prevent the infected from escaping.  No cure was found, and those quarantined inside were basically left to die.

After decades of inactivity, signs of life are observed in the dead zone.  The Government ignores them, until the Reaper virus surfaces on the ""safe"" side of the wall.  In a panic, the Government authorizes a mission to enter the hot zone to try and find a cure.  Dr. Marcus Kane (Malcom McDowell), trapped inside when the wall was built, is a possible lead.  DDS Chief Bill Nelson (Bob Hoskins) selects Sinclair to lead the strike team, which has just 48 hours to complete its mission.

Based on what is supposed to have happened, the societies behind the wall don't seem very credible, as based on the age of some of the survivors, human life has clearly been flourishing for some time.  The number of survivors is quite substantial, and they have electricity, and automobiles.  Led by Sol (Craig Conway), the inhabitants of Glasgow are a fierce bunch, and make short work of the strike force, taking Sinclair and a few others prisoner.  Having developed a taste for human flesh, they make the death of one of the invaders, a huge public spectacle.

After some fancy swordplay, Sinclair makes a miraculous escape, with the help of Kane's daughter Cally (MyAnna Burning).  Riding a train that somehow still functions after two decades, the small party escapes into the country, eventually encountering Kane, who lives in a castle, and commands his followers like a feudal lord.  Eden has a magnificent battle with a knight in full armor, and then with Cally and Dr. Stirling (Darren Morfitt), the last member of the strike force, makes another miraculous escape, taking her leave in an immaculate black Bentley.  The film's final action sequence features vehicles streaking across the Scottish countryside.  Whatever they are using for fuel, has the vehicles running at peak performance.

While the individual action-packed segments are powerful and quite exciting, the pieces do not fit together very logically.  This may be a deal breaker for some, while others may find the brutal combat and breakneck action, satisfying enough.  Rhona Mitra's performance is strong throughout, and becomes the central focus as other characters fall along the away.  In writing Doomsday, Neil Marshall was apparently inspired by many films, including Excalibur, Escape From New York, and Mad Max.  This approach seems to contribute to the disjointedness, of what is still a very solid and impressive action/adventure.

The DVD contains both the unrated, and theatrical versions of the film.  There are also some production featurettes, and a commentary track with director Marshall, and members of the cast, but unfortunately Rhona Mitra is not among them, which is a huge miss, given her prominence in the film.",1282176000,,3675,5.11390284757119

It gets progressively more terrible until finally culminating in one of the most awful chase scenes I've ever seen.

That climatic chase scene is just atrocious.  Part of it is a car chase scene where you just want to tell the director that if he isn't going to take it seriously, he should do something else to end the movie.  Lots of action movies are unrealistic.  But the last 15 minutes of this movie crosses the line from unrealistic into something so absurd that it's almost insulting to the audience.

A quick jab at all the critics of this movie - What did you expect out of a movie called 'Doomsday', anyways?

Aside from my opinion of the movie itself, this is a shining example of what blu-ray should be! The picture is consistently sharp, colors are vivid, and I did not see a SINGLE artifact or bit of digital noise. The audio is perfect - one of the better examples of dynamic surround sound I have experienced. And no matter how loud the background sound is, the speech is perfectly balanced. The only area lacking are the extras - they are ok, but it doesn't really matter when the picture and sound are this great.

If you combined ""Camelot"" with ""Road Warrior"" and ""Robin Hood"" with ""I Am Legend,"" you might come up with something like ""Doomsday,"" a jaw-dropping concoction whose sole claim to fame is that it proves that British filmmakers are every bit as capable of producing a really bad action flick as their American counterparts.

In terms of plot, ""Doomsday"" is yet another futuristic action picture designed to turn the general populace into a bunch of paranoid hypochondriacs.  The movie begins in 2008, just as a mysterious killer virus has broken out in Scotland, forcing the citizens of that country to be quarantined behind reinforced metal barriers (constructed on the site of Hadrian's Wall) and coastal blockades.  Twenty-seven years later, a new strain of the disease has emerged in London, forcing a team of military operatives, led by the take-no-prisoners, ass-kicking Major Eden Sinclair (Rhona Mitra), to be sent into the quarantined area (where evidence suggests there may be some healthy survivors) to find out if there is indeed a cure for the disease and to bring it back to England with them when they return.  But the team gets more than it bargained for when it enters the famed ""hot zone"" of Glascow - namely an out-of-control society where any semblance of morality and law-and-order has long since broken down, the inhabitants have turned into insatiable cannibals, and one sector of the population at least - in an act of supreme screenwriting idiocy - has donned Medieval attire and retreated to a castle deep in the nation`s interior to begin the process of building their world anew amidst jousting tournaments and fight-to-the-death gladiatorial contests.

Written and directed by Neil Marshall, the appropriately titled ""Doomsday"" comes replete with stilted dialogue, wooden acting, laughable action sequences, a corny hail-to-Dorothy-the-wicked-witch-is-dead conclusion, and the kind of grunge-chic that has become the standard-issue look for any and all post-apocalyptic tales since the ""Mad Max"" movies of the 1980s.  Even the likes of once A-list players like Malcolm McDowell and Bob Hoskins get mired in the muck.  The art direction and production design are decent, but a single additional word of praise lavished on this cheapjack, gory - I lost track of the beheadings - and vilely sadistic ""28 Days Later"" knockoff would be excessive indeed.

3423263,4,B00195FUDC,"4 of 5 stars for this dirty gritty violent sci-fi movie. So a virus strikes forcing the world to enclose the entire country to prevent spread to the rest of the world. Ultimately a modern day great wall of China is built to secure the quarantine. It is assumed the whole population dies from the virus. Wrong! Many survive (hummm, natural immunity). After many years of stability, the virus spreads to England where the authorites decide they need to capture one of those immune people to create a cure. So, a para-military task force goes beyond the wall. They first go to a large city where they encounter a large collection of people who have gone ""primative native"" and attack the force. During their escape, they get linked to a different set of people who have gone ""knights and castles"".

This movie is very dirty and gritty. The most graphic violence that I've seen since some of those movies in the 70's. Plenty of blood, guts, bullets, body parts and dead people. Good action, good special effects, interesting plot. Worth watching, but, be warned, it is graphic!",1254960000,2,1073,4.737967914438503
3423264,3,B00195FUDC,"It's all been seen before, and this movie won't be the one to remember when you're discussing exploitation movies down the pub... but for all that, it does its job efficiently enough and does what it sets out to.
For the most part, what it is setting out to do seems to be to homage other movies.  It's set in a future world where an incurable disease called the Reaper virus (cos it's deadly, geddit..?) has led to a Scotland completely sealed off from land, air or sea to allow the population to die without infecting anyone else.  However, 25 years after the virus appeared and was contained, it has resurfaced, and a team must re-enter Scotland, to investigate recent indications of survivors, which could mean a cure is possible.  The build up and plot exposition are effective, evoking some of the ideas from 28 Days Later, and the scene where the armoured cars enter Glasgow rips off the scene in Aliens with armoured car carrying the marines to the centre of the aliens nest, down to the smallest details.  From Aliens, the director moves on to a Scottish variation on Mad Max's Thunderdome, as we meet the punkish degenerate subculture which has taken over the city.  Finally the movie brings all the pieces together in a car chase which plays like a mixture of Bond and Mad Max via Escape from New York to a not-quite-satisfying-enough conclusion.
Rhona Mitra plays the team leader, Major Skinner, dressed in unfeasibly tight clothes to accentuate her figure for most of the movie.  She does the job, but fails to really set the screen alight with the necessary charisma to make the B-movie nonsense memorable.  Supporting roles are filled out with a few British cinema stalwarts - Sean Pertwee, Bob Hoskins,  Malcolm McDowell and Alexander Siddig all perfom just to the level required and not much more.  It's action packed, bloody and gruesome and often gratuitous, but never goes quite over the top enough to be too offensive.  That is perhaps an indication of the director's intention to make a tongue in cheek apocalyptic thriller that does not take itself too seriously - and in that he has succeeded.  But in using a script riddled with plot holes and unlikely conveniences, he has failed to make something unmissable - or even truly memorable.",1254441600,,2261,4.771794871794872
3423265,2,B00195FUDC,"Though it includes lots of shoot-outs, gores and chopped-off limbs and heads, Neil Marshall's newest film ""Doomsday"" comes off rather disappointing. The film is from the director who made two impressive films, ""Dog Soldiers"" and ""The Descent."" Some say they are overrated, but still Neil Marshall managed to show originality and creativity in his previous works. As far as the budget goes, his latest effort has become much bigger and louder; however, ""Doomsday"" looks lackluster and, more importantly, derivative.

The outbreak of a deadly plague in Glasgow, with the horror of the pandemic, results in the quarantine of Scotland. No one is allowed to leave the country and the people inside the border are left abandoned. Years later, in 2035, because of another outbreak of the same disease in London, a group of soldiers led by Maj. Eden Sinclair (Rhona Mitra) is immediately sent to Scotland, in order to find a cure.

Usually any action or horror films need suspension of disbelief, but ""Doomsday"" asks for it so many times. You will see the angry mob gets killed by the soldiers, but one little girl is allowed to board a chopper. Eventually all logic is abandoned in favor of reasonable, if not remarkable action and set-pieces, which can be improved with better editing and choreography.

This is the world of Mad Max and Snake Plissken. Or one that has copied them. Clearly Neil Marshall loves classic action flicks made in 70-80s - soldiers' names include ""Miller"" and ""Carpenter."" You may add to them ""Hill,"" ""Cameron"" and ""Boyle"" perhaps. Don't get me wrong. Paying homage is not a bad thing. It is just that it doesn't necessarily mean you can dispense with a decent script and your own ideas. If your new idea is the lengthy ""BBQ"" stage with cancan music, you need to watch these classic films again. They may be violent, but certainly they are not boring.

""Doomsday"" has so many things - car chases, street combats, one-on-one fights, tortures, gores, decapitations and even deliberate dumbness. These factors can be fun only if they are done with decent stories. The film constantly changes its rules as it moves on from one chapter to another whimsically, and then we realize that like Tarantino's self-indulgent ""Death Proof,"" the director is actually doing what other directors did. And they did better.",1253404800,,2324,4.966580976863753
3423266,3,B00195FUDC,"ONCE UPON A TIME a man was visiting friends who served him breakfast with a boiled egg that was just beginning to spoil. Not wanting to offend anyone, he added extra pepper and ate it all. When his hostess asked how his egg was, he truthfully replied, ""Parts of it were excellent.""

The same can be said for this film.

As our own civilization comes closer and closer to crumbling in a dozen different ways, dystopian science fiction flourishes both in print and in films. DOOMSDAY is one of the handsomer and more thought-provoking entries in recent years. It has a skillful cast, excellent production values, and a gripping central story. (Bob Hoskins, Alexander Siddig, and Malcolm McDowell are the main supports; Rhona Mitra is the main star.)

Yes, we older folks have seen much of it elsewhere, especially in huge chunks of the MAD MAX/ROAD WARRIOR films (including DOOMSDAY's ""remake"" of the David-vs.-Goliath battle where ""two go in--one comes out"")--but perhaps each generation needs to have the vital wake-up calls remade just for them.

And yet, while we watch any film or read any story, a part of our mind often is doing a quality assessment of it--including how plausible its various characters and scenes and bits of dialogue are AND how consistently these unfold. Sad to say, this is where DOOMSDAY stumbles for me. After a fine set-up of a plague in Scotland, the cruel way a quarantine is established, and a later outbreak of the same plague in London, the heroine (played in wonderful kickass fashion by Rhona Mitra) is sent into Scotland to try to find a cure. BAM! We run into Major Plot Hole #1: Although it is made clear that for many years there has been absolutely no evidence of any human beings surviving in Scotland, not only are there hundreds of them in Glasgow, the first city investigated, but they are using electrical power to light up the city at night! (How did the military planes of the UK miss this little detail? Duh?)

Getting into a dangerous place, of course, is but half the problem in all such films--Ms. Mitra has to do some Kurt Russell magic (ESCAPE FROM NEW YORK, 1981) in order to complete her mission. BAM! BAM! BAM! Oops. More Major Plot Holes. Here are just a few along the way: How easy is it to open a giant blast-proof door in an old army tunnel? How likely is it that a powerful, pristine civilian car is waiting behind it?? How likely is it that--after 20 years--its gasoline is still good and its battery is still charged??? And what about the hundreds of cannibals from Glasgow? How did THEY just happen to locate the heroine on her return journey? And how likely is it that even a Batmobile could crash THROUGH a bus stretched across the highway--without suffering even one scratch????

Well, for the sake of fantasy fun, often a major component of such films, we all are used to suspending our disbelief, and in this case the payoff of this film is worth it: most of us nowadays are very disgusted with the lies told by politicians in our own city, county, state, and country, and the final scenes of DOOMSDAY (without away giving any details) treat the audience to some Satisfying Poetic Justice in this area.

Oh, just in case you wanted to watch this film with your grandmother, the unrated version has partial nudity for about 30 seconds (a minor female character in a bathtub).",1251417600,3,3344,4.66723259762309

She returns at the end? Why? Is this ever explained?

The Mad Max raiders are fearless and run head first into full machine gun blasts ready to die. But play a game of chicken with them in a car and they ALL swerve out of the way in fear of crashing. Makes sense...

What was the point of those futuristic army suits they wore if they offered no protection whatsoever?

The humvee/tank was explained to have 2 inch armor that can stop all sorts of ballistics. Yet the driver of the tank is taken out by a crossbow.

3423270,2,B00195FUDC,"A dystopian near-future meets a rebirth of the feudal system in Neil Marshall's post-apocalyptic vision, in which an elite team of military operatives accompany medical experts into the no-go zone that is Scotland in 2035 to find a cure for a virus that is decimating the population.

The central conceit of the film--that government would choose to seal off Scotland and rebuild Hadrian's Wall as a reaction to the virus--is cute and hokey to begin with, and this perhaps gives some indication as to the tonal and stylistic decisions taken with the project.  Unapologetically derivative, the Mad Max elements and a deliberate attempt to set the modern solider against the medieval knight are contrived and only serve to deprive the film of any real sense of gravitas or purpose, and the decision to use South Africa in place of Scotland for much of the filming may have made financial sense but it seems a shame the grandeur of the Scottish landscape itself was not on display here.  The dialogue is for the most part dreadful and the dominance of alternative sub-cultures is as implausible as their anarchic and cannibalistic portrayal is risible.  Malcolm McDowell is far better than the kind of role he is given here, even if it is not an atypical one for this stage in his career, and the choice of music is at times ill-fitting and only serves to date the film back to its stylistic roots.

There are, however, some things to like here.  The decaying cities of Glasgow and London look convincing, and the action sequences--if resorting to superfluous gore to the point of inciting boredom--are well executed.  Rhona Mitra makes for a fine and convincing heroine and the likes of Adrian Lester and Alexander Siddig also do the best they can with the material they have been given, but above all Doomsday feels like it was a much more intelligent and worthier piece of work that took a wrong turn very early in the creative process.

Doomsday is fun to watch and Rhona Mitre proves more than capable of being a butt-kicking leading lady, but after a while Marshall's constant homage to/rip offs of better films (including but not limited to 28 Days Later, Aliens, The Road Warrior, and Escape from New York) start getting tiresome and I found myself wishing I was actually watching those movies instead of a second rate clone of them.",1241568000,2,418,4.805555555555555
3423272,3,B00195FUDC,"In DOOMSDAY, director Neil Marshal has put together a film that has a pulsating energy from start to finish. Those who see this film are also the same ones who are likely to appreciate the liberal homages to a variety of cult cinema epics ranging from the wastelands of the Australian outback of MAD MAX to the virus based collapse of civilization of 28 DAYS. There is a surprising number of big names like Bob Hoskins, Malcolm McDowell, and Alexander Siddig (from STAR TREK). Yet, the one who has the lead and is in nearly every scene is Rhona Metra, a hard boiled soldier type cast in the Ripley (ALIEN) mold and Milla Jovovich mold (RESIDENT EVIL).  Metra is Major Eden, who as a child survived the breakdown of civilization as the Reaper Virus struck Scotland with such lethality that the Prime Minister decided to quarrantine the entire northern British Isles by building a 30 foot high wall along the lines of ESCAPE FROM NEW YORK. There are the few obligatory comments on the morality of the wall, but the entire focus of the film was for director Marshall to cram in as many scenes of over the top gore, violence, and cannibalism as he could squeeze into its running time. And this he does with a gusto that does not allow for the audience to note the various flaws and flubs. The most obvious flaw is that the central government in London had kept a sharp eye on the quarrantined section via electronic snooping devices but did not detect any sign of a resurgent civilization. Malcolm McDowell has spent the last twenty years playing psychotic baddies as he does with his sneering Dr. Cain, who may have the cure for the virus. Bob Hoskins shows a softer, gentler side than what he usually portrays as he acts as Major Eden's surrogate father figure. But we are not in the audience to observe any nuanced acting by either of these two. We wish to see heads lopped off, human bodies roasted and devoured, astounding car chases that are inevitably lethal, and very nearly any bloody scene from a cornacopia of genre action films.  And DOOMSDAY delivers on all these counts, and for that it delivers as promised.",1240358400,,2118,4.615384615384615

her physical agility lent a very view worthy and believable edge to this movie. I will watch it again.

3423276,4,B00195FUDC,"I've long been a fan of grim, macabre and/or darkly humorous post-apocalyptic science fictions films: 28 DAYS LATER, CHILDREN OF MEN, FIREFLY and SERENITY, the Terminator and Alien franchises. As a feminist, I also enjoy stories which are driven by strong women. Naturally, I loved DOOMSDAY.

The movie opens in Scotland, which has been thrown into chaos by a deadly and unstoppable viral outbreak (called - what else? - the Reaper Virus). Whereas science has failed to find a cure, the corrupt and panicked government's only solution is to wall of the city in hopes of containing the outbreak. Infected and healthy citizens alike are left for dead.

Fast-forward thirty years to present-day England. Scandalized by the unethical quarantine imposed on Scotland during the initial Reaper Virus outbreak, England's former global allies have ostracized the country. With England's economy in ruins and corruption running rampant, citizens are only slightly better off than their Scottish counterparts. That is, until the Reaper Virus resurfaces on the other side of the wall - in England. Having failed to develop a cure in the interim, the British government's only hope is to locate a survivor in the quarantine zone, and perhaps construct a vaccine using her DNA. But who might volunteer for what is, in essence, a suicide mission?

Enter Eden Sinclair (Rhona Mitra), the perfect (wo)man for the job. Eden was born in Scotland not long before the viral outbreak. Her mother managed to smuggle the young child out of the quarantine zone as the country descended into panic and anarchy. Equipped with a creepyawesome cybernetic fake eye and a team of military specialists, Eden infiltrates the quarantine zone in search of survivors.

DOOMSDAY is a loud, violent, highly stylized and deliciously over-the-top film. The story sports a few plot holes, sure; and the action sequences, while beautifully executed, defy real-world logic. If you can manage to suspend your disbelief, though, DOOMSDAY  is a wicked fun ride. Rhona Mitra kicks some serious arse, and stuntwoman Lee-Ann Liebenberg is hella fun as a tattoeed punk named Viper.

From a feminist perspective, the two parallel societies which have arisen in Scotland since the outbreak are fascinating studies in sociopolitics (and probably more realistic than the action sequences, to boot). One segment of the population, led by the scientist formerly known as ""Dr. Kane"" (who became stranded in Scotland whist studying the virus during the height of the pandemic), has reverted to a medieval state of existence; retreating into the mountains, Kane's society now lives in the ruins of old castles and get about town on horseback. Meanwhile, Kane's son Sol commands the urban dwellers, an anarchistic society made up of undisciplined, spiky-haired, tattooed-n-pierced punks. The two communities are more alike than they are different: both are violent, misogynist patriarchies, ruled by ruthless male dictators. Perhaps unintentionally, the filmmakers offer a peripheral look at the nature of hierarchy, dominance and oppression: thrown into chaos, yet given the opportunity for reinvention, Scottish citizens revert to a patriarchal existence, marked by obedience, subjugation and male ego.

In this vein, the film's ending (which I won't spoil here) offers an intriguing new direction for a sequel. IBTM, anyone?",1235865600,,3367,5.353497164461247

I enjoyed this movie more then other big-budget features like ""The Dark Knight.""  Mitra is an under appreciated actress whose movie career I've enjoyed since ""Beowulf"" (not the animated movie, but an earlier remake of the classic tale with Christopher Lambert that's set in the future), and followed through Hollowman and Highwaymen.

First, the movie itself has big budget production values, sets, special effects, and cinematography so at least the movie looks good even if you don't care for the plot.  The transfer to blu-ray is outstanding, though the Special Features are pretty lame (not even an interview with Mitra!).  Sound, and sound effects on the blu-ray disc were also of high quality.

Now to the movie itself - perhaps it is because I am a huge fan of B-action/horror movies, this movie was by far the best movie I've seen in a long time.  This movie takes the best elements out of four different genres, cuts the fat, adds high production values and Mitra, cooks it all up serves a big heaping dish of crazy, out of control B movie fun.  The plot, if you can accept the premises upon which it is built, is in fact fairly cohesive.  It seems as though many people are jarred by the quick changes in theme and tempo the movie goes through, but I like to think of it as getting 4 movies for the price of one.  My favorite scene is when Sol, with a background of 80s music and 2 hot go-go dancers, acts as the announcer for the BBQ of a captured scientest that Mitra was suppose to protect.

The PQ is a 4/5. Some shots are a bit soft, but overall, the film is pristine. However, the sound is amiss. The rears overwhelm the dialogue, especially in highly sound-complex action sequences. At times, I felt as though I was lipreading.

I knew nothing about this director before I watched the film and had expected the typical ""world gone wild"" film, with little cinematic value. However this world infected by a relentless virus, was created to capture the madness humanity has come to embrace, in the face of hopelessness. Everything from the cars, the buildings and the people ooze the sadness, and illness. The lighting for the first part of the film is dark, but for the second part, the film becomes more of an action flick, with some neat car chase scenes, and action sequences.

Rhona Mitra who plays the lead character, is effetive in her portrayal of a seargent charged with leading a team to enter the ""hotzone"" and lead the effort to find a cure. Tough and relentless, she is unapologetic, and represents a rare depiction of a ruthless female lead. Many times we assume that the female will be voice of reason, and tainted by emotion, but this time, she literally is on a ""mission"" and nothing else,and ultimately chooses to be among those that have chosen anarchy over humanity. She has abandoned civilation. The other cast members support her well, and provide a believable ensemble of the ""soldier"" type.

The score in this film was very effective in creating a high-speed and dramatic pace, especially during the second part of the film. It was a ""standout"", and probably because of the inequality in sound mix, between the front and rear speakers/lowering of the dialogue, appeared to be a standout.

3423287,1,B00195FUDC,"Good actors cant save a terrible script.  I liked the actors in this film.  The movie itself however was horrible.  If you've seen any of the Mad Max films and Escape from New York, then you have seen this.  If the United States is where all the aliens land then the United Kingdom is where all the deadly plagues start.

The movie starts with a deadly fast spreading virus that kills almost everyone in Scotland so the government instantly builds a 30' wall around the country and leaves the survivors to die.  35 years later, instead of NO survivors, there are a couple hundred 20-something men and women who are directly out of Mad Max films.

The Prime Minister sends in their top agent to recover the cure for the deadly virus that is presumably in the enclosed area and she gets immediately captured.  The rest of the movie is strange mix of fights, exploding heads, hacked off limbs and even an exploding bunny with way way over the top gore so common in Rogue Pictures' films.

If you are a fan of exploding heads, guts, hacked off limbs etc. and don't mind that the plot makes no sense, this is the film for you.  If you hate to see good actors and what could have been intriguing characters ( the two main villians ) wasted on a terrible movie, then don't waste your time.",1232323200,5,1282,4.417021276595745

That is more entertaining than this film.

3423292,3,B00195FUDC,"Remember when we had no choice but to watch beefed-up, brainless brutes try to save the day in any ultra-violent, post-apocalyptic action thriller?  Thank goodness those times have changed, and we can shout the mantra that hotness prevails even as the source of all that hotness goes about kicking the posterior of any man who dares get in her way.  I don't know if Rhona Mitra could take out the likes of Milla Jovovich - but I do know that is one catfight I would pay lots of money to see.  One thing I do know, however, is that Doomsday is all about Rhona Mitra.  Without her, this movie crashes and burns.  As others have pointed out, Doomsday is (to put it nicely) highly derivative of several earlier films; the weird thing is that most of those derivative scenes and situations are pretty stupid and over-the-top.  Even the great Michael McDowell isn't in the film long enough to make his character's recidivistic little fiefdom believable, but it's the whole Mad Max society that really weighs heavily on this film's overall success (or lack thereof).

One song you won't hear on this film's hard-edged soundtrack is Blue Oyster Cult's Don't Fear the Reaper.  Everybody fears the Reaper virus, as it has engulfed all of Scotland in a matter of days.  Despite serious international ramifications, the British government makes the seemingly sane choice of placing the whole of Scotland in quarantine.  I'm not sure how they went about building an elaborate wall all the way across the border of England and Scotland almost overnight, but build it they did, essentially sentencing every inhabitant of Scotland to a horrible death.  One of the few souls to escape (albeit without her right eye) grows up to become Britain's hottest female cop - and, thirty years after the Reaper virus outbreak, the person chosen to lead a team of cure-seekers back into the plagued northern lands.  It seems the British government has been covering up any and all knowledge of a significant number of survivors existing in Scotland.  Now the virus has popped up again - in no less a place than London - so all will be lost if a cure is not discovered very quickly.  Major Eden Sinclair (Rhona Mitra) and her team have less than 48 hours to get in to Scotland, find a source for the cure, and return home to save the day.

The plan goes awry fairly quickly as the team is attacked by a gang of ruffians with really bad haircuts, an obsession with facial tattoos, and absolutely no fashion sense.  When they're not doing whatever animalistic morons do, they like to rock out to Fine Young Cannibals music and, on occasion, eat one another.  Later on, what's left of the team finds yet another society of loons living quite the mediaeval lifestyle.  Holed up in an ancient castle, these guys take the Renaissance Festival lifestyle (Huzzah!) to bold new lows.  Malcolm McDowell's talents seem rather wasted on his role as the little fiefdom's leader, and the story quickly reverts back to its strength - gory, nonstop violence.

As long as you look at the script as nothing more than an excuse for stringing together a bunch of bloody fight scenes, you have a good chance of enjoying what you see here.  The story itself is hopelessly muddled, a sort of Frankenstein's monster sewn together with different parts of other, easily recognizable movies.  That's the real source of frustration among a majority of fans.  Director Neil Marshall raised the bar quite high with his two previous films,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Dog-Soldiers/dp/B000RW5BZ0/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Dog Soldiers</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Descent-Unrated-Widescreen-Edition/dp/B000IHY9TS/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Descent (Unrated Widescreen Edition)</a>.

3423296,3,B00195FUDC,"By no stretch of the imagination is DOOMSDAY a good movie.  It has a ridiculous plot, over-the-top gore, and virtually no discernible character development.  Yet it is so juiced up with antic energy that most of it actually ends up being a complete blast.

The movie begins in the present day, where a horrific virus is spreading across Scotland like any horrific virus in any of a million previous sci-fi flicks.  In an effort to stop the spread, England manages to construct an impenetrable concrete wall across the entire length of the Scottish/English border (apparently in about a week and a half).  The isolated denizens of Scotland fall into chaos and eventually turn to cannibalism.  This is an important point of the film, yet it is never explained.  There is plenty of food in Scotland (in fact, some soldiers literally run into a gigantic herd of cattle)...so why start eating your neighbor?

The brutality of England's response to Scotland's plight alienates the rest of the world, and Great Britain is cut off from the rest of the world economically, and falls into poverty and chaos itself.

We leap ahead about 25 years, and now the virus has been discovered in the heart of London.  The government calls on one of its top special forces agents (Rhona Mitra from NIP/TUCK fame) to lead a band of soldiers and scientists into Glasgow.  You see, the English government has known for some time that there a lot of survivors in Scotland and now it is interested in finding out from them where they got their cure.

So the little band of heroes heads into Scotland.  The vehicles they drive look much like the armored vehicles driven by Sigourney Weaver and HER band of ruffians in ALIENS.  They arrive in the Scottish capitol, only to be brutally attacked by a large gang of young thugs, dressed in crazy clothes, all with amazingly punk-like haircuts and feral attitudes.  Their appearance and weaponry reminded me of a low-rent THE ROAD WARRIOR.

Later, our heroes (those who still stand) escape and find another band of humans, mostly the parents of the young thugs.  These folks were around when the original plague hit, and have cast out their youth and taken up life in an old castle, far from the prying eyes of the English satellites.  Yet, for no good reason, they have also decided to start a medieval society!  So they run around like knights in TIMELINE or even A KNIGHT'S TALE.

There are so MANY unanswerable questions, like ""How did these thugs manage to get the absolutely coolest tattoos?  One would assume all tattoo parlors are defunct.""  Or ""Why again to they like to eat human flesh when crops and cattle abound?""

I hope you got from all this explanation that this movie is silly and it made up of random samplings from A LOT of other films (some much better, some not so good).  It is a true mash-up that borders on feeling like a rip-off.  I guess if I had to pitch this film, I'd say it's ALIENS meets 28 WEEKS LATER meets THE ROAD WARRIOR meets TIMELINE meets CHILDREN OF MEN.

It should be unwatchable (at least while sober).  Yet it is somehow fairly entertaining.
Primary credit must go to Rhona Mitra, a most unusual actress.  I'm not saying she's a great actress...not at all.  But she has a striking presence...looking like Laura Kroft from TOMB RAIDER combined with, perhaps, Kate Beckinsale from UNDERWORLD and maybe a dash of Ripley from ALIEN, ALIENS, etc.  She has a very unusual face (I remember her strange recurring role in NIP/TUCK where she came across both sensual and creepy at the same time) and a believable coldness.  She doesn't exactly create a character, but she creates a charismatic action figure.

The movie also boasts some spectacular gore.  If you like blood and brains flyin'...you'll get your fix.  It has the gore aesthetic of a George Romero flick (ah yes, KNIGHTRIDERS is yet ANOTHER movie DOOMSDAY rips off).  The action is fairly rip-roaring as well,  particularly in some early sequences in Glasgow and in an overtly ROAD WARRIOR-esque finale.

This is a film to get the blood pumping while putting the brain to sleep.  It moves very fast (except when it comes to those medieval scenes...the movie comes to a crashing halt in that 15 minute segment) and makes few demands on the viewer.  Director Neil Marshall (the fun but murky werewolf movie DOG SOLDIERS and the excellent THE DESCENT) has essentially taken a pure shot of adrenalin and put it onto film.  I guess there are worse things!",1225238400,4,4465,4.733160621761658
3423297,1,B00195FUDC,"What a waste of money! I had a hard time thinking of a worst film, but still couldn't come up with anything.

Decent acting, great action, and good music make this well worth at least a rental. I plan to get a copy myself. A top woman cop is sent to find how a group has survived a virus that has killed off most the population. She finds that the virus stricken just outside the walled city aren't the only people hostile towards those in the city, and none of the groups or the government have unselfish agendas. Malcolm McDowell is great as the scientist gone Medieval literally as a ruler. Good acting by Rhona Mitra, Bob Hoskins, and the rest the cast.

3423301,3,B00195FUDC,"Doomsday is certainly one of the more bizarre sci-fi horror flicks I've seen; think a frantic, chaotic mash-up of Mad Max, Resident Evil, 28 Days Later, Road Warriors, Escape from New York, and pretty much any other post-apocalyptic zombie flick you can think of, with a dash of Braveheart and a hint of Underworld thrown in for spice. Add a reasonable, if plot-hole-riddled, storyline, some government conspiracy, lots of fake blood, guns, swords, Molotov cocktails, explosions, and an awesome soundtrack. Mix together well, turn your brain off, and you might just enjoy this movie.
It starts out with a flashback to Scotland in the near future; a deadly disease called the Reaper Virus has ravenged the populous, and the government concludes that the best course of action is to quarantine the entire country. Thirty years later, an outbreak of the virus in London prompts the Prime Minister and his cronies to reveal some new information: it turns out that there were survivors beyond the wall after all, and they might hold the key to finding a cure.
Enter Eden Sinclair, part of post-apocalyptic London's answer to the police, who is sent over the wall with a team of soldiers and scientists to find a doctor who at one time had been working on finding a cure before being trapped behind the wall.
They eventually do find Dr. Kane, but not before encountering the two very different groups of survivors living in quarantined Scotland (Kane's medieval knights and castle-dwellers and his son, Sol's, 80's punk-revival cannibals), both of whom are trying their best to kill the intruders. All of this concludes in a car chase across the countryside a-la-Road Warriors that pretty much kills any seriousness that might have been accrued in the first hour-and-a-half.
Doomsday isn't smart or original by any means, but if you don't mind a little gore (or a lot, as the case may be), it's a fun action flick.",1222905600,3,1908,4.910216718266254

3423303,2,B00195FUDC,"In ""Doomsday,"" a wild and wooly rollercoaster of a movie, a lethal virus has spread through the British Isles, infecting millions and killing hundreds of thousands.  To contain the disease, the authorities quarantine the country by constructing a massive wall to keep the afflicted from the untainted.  This leads to fear, panic, and total chaos with mob rule prevailing, but the quarantine works.
 Three decades later, however, the virus resurfaces.  A group of specialists, including Eden Sinclair (Rhona Mitra), is sent to the still-quarantined country to obtain a cure.  Isolated from the rest of the world, the group must negotiate what has become a living nightmare, battling bloodthirsty, virus-infected mutants.
 ""Doomsday"" draws upon many other movies, specifically ""Mad Max,"" ""I Am Legend,"" ""28 Days Later,"" ""Alien,"" and both halves of the ""Grindhouse"" double feature.  Director Neil Marshall (""The Descent,"" ""Bully"") concentrates on pace above all else, dribbling out minimal exposition so that gun battles, gruesome bloodletting, and car chases can dominate the screen.
 The characters are standard action picture issue.  Bob Hoskins plays Bill Nelson, a down-to-earth, decent guy in charge of selecting the individuals for the deadly mission.  He knows Eden is the right person for the job and puts her in charge of a ragtag group prepared to brave the no-man's-land of the virus-stricken.  As soon as we see the two impressive-looking armored vehicles that will serve as the team's transport, we know from having seen so many similar movies that one will be destroyed and numerous lives will be lost.
 Eden is the strong, silent type, instinctively quick when danger is imminent and lightning fast in defending herself and her team against onslaughts of the humanoids, who resemble more 1980's punk rockers than plague-ridden citizens.  With her form-fitting black spandex and dramatic poses, Eden looks more like a comic book heroine than a serious law enforcement professional.  But, owing to the tone of the movie, this is likely intentional.
 In the ""Alien"" movies, Sigourney Weaver brought a gravity to her role as Ripley.  We believed her as a tough warrior when things got rough and she had to face a formidable enemy.  With Mitra, it's hard to shake the impression of her as an ad for a new fragrance in Elle magazine.  Every time we see a close-up, we are so taken with her beauty that we completely disassociate her from her character.  The result is that ""Doomsday,"" played absolutely straight, comes off as a campy foray into the deterioration-of-society genre.
 Malcolm McDowell pops up in the film's second half as Kane, the man who may hold a cure for the dread disease.  A megalomaniacal, futuristic Nero, Kane has created a fiefdom of sorts in the countryside to weather the plague that has affected the rest of the country.  Here, with his armored guards, he holds sway over a fortress and officiates over gladiatorial bouts.
 The movie has more than its share of jaw-dropping moments, such as a musical interlude by the crazed mob that has turned to torture and cannibalism for amusement and nourishment; a one-eyed heroine who removes her faux eye, which is a camera, so she can see around corners and peek into forbidden areas; and a tattooed, bare-chested, Mohawk-sporting mob leader who clearly missed his calling as rock star.
 ""Doomsday"" contains an enormous amount of violence -- graphic beheadings, bodies crushed under tanks, axes being imbedded into heads, and even an innocent rabbit being blown up by gunfire.  This is not a movie for the weak of stomach.",1221955200,,3600,5.112820512820512

3423305,4,B00195FUDC,"When I first saw this movie, I was immediately reminded of Escape from New York. Set in a somewhat near future, similar to the movie mentioned prior, a small group of soldiers go into an abandoned wasteland region. Like Escape from New York, they are going into a dangerous and hostile territory -in this case Glasgow- for emergent politcal reasons. Then as the movie progressed and I saw the denizens of this hypothetical Glasgow, they were extremely reminiscent of those denizens in the Mad Max movies. Weird hairstyles, clothes, and all.
  As far as the movie itself, aside from comparisons, it wasn't all that bad. A somewhat paper-thin storyline with some pretty damn good action sequences. It's a good mindless action movie with lots of gore and truly unique characters. Lots of explosions, gunfights, and well-choreographed fight scenes are really what this movie is about, unfortunately. The stroy is kinda cut and paste. A virus has ravaged the countryside and the small group, led by Major Sinclair, has been tasked to find Marcus Kane, the only scientist who came close to a cure. The scientist is located in Glasgow, a now savage region that was first taken by the Reaper virus (wow, that was the best name they could think of for the virus?). But like I said before, I did enjoy the movie.

I apologize if I offend the viewers that found the cliches in this film to remind them of the heyday of the post apocalyptic action pic, but I have to digress regarding the vapid, silly proceedings other wise known as DOOMSDAY.  Okay, when I speak of the 'heyday', I do include all of the obvious as mentioned before classics (ROAD WARRIOR, ESCAPE FROM NEW YORK, etc.), but also some other low budget greats as DAMNATION ALLEY, A BOY AND HIS DOG, or even LOGAN""S RUN.  Now, borrowing from all these ideas is not all bad.  Somehow though, NEIL MARSHALL re-tooled all of these ideas into one big ball of nonsense.  The flick just careens into the next cliche without a bit of panache.  When the knights on horseback show up I was just about to throw in the towel after many groan inducing scenes of uninspired carnage (I did write 'uninspired', carnage is great if done with verve ala MARSHALL's fantastic DOG SOLDIERS), but lo, if I had given up I would have missed the next bit - a souped up Bently driving over said knights.  Wow, it is as bad as it sounds.  I for one am also tired of peeking into a future where many of the denizens are sporting mowhawks.  The star I give the movie is for an interesting plot point pertaining to RHONA MITRA's fake robotic eye.  A cool gadget that alas is given up on in the third act.

This movie does not have the special effects from the 80s, I haven't watched a movie from the 80s since the 90s but I mean c'mon just because the soundtrack is from the 80's doesn't mean it was meant to compliment the movie to the literal degree.

If you like action, you will like this movie, but it has a lot of dark humor and emotional stages throughout the film. It is a bit unrealistic, as most movies are, but I loved every second of it.

Let's discuss the characters shall we? First we have the main character Rhona Mitra, who kicks ass and has a great haircut. Bob Hoskins gives the movie heart with his fatherly performance, granted he gets less screen time than he deserves. My favorite character was Craig Conway who went by the name ""Sol""; he was cruel, but hilarious. This movie has an ending unlike any I have ever seen before, how bold the main character was when she killed and conquered her way to escape being where she never belonged in the first place. Another thing I found interesting about the movie is how they claim to have survived by natural selection, not by a cure. This makes me wonder if some kind of virus really broke out in reality, one that could potentially end the way we live our lives now, would we triumph over a deadly virus, or live our lives like immoral beasts?

3423310,3,B00195FUDC,"As is apparent by the previous reviews, ""Doomsday"" leaves alot to be desired if one is looking for substance. It is derivative of just about every single ""pre-apocalyptic"", ""post-apocalyptic"", ""we don't care if you die"", ""pass me another knife, bullet, pistol, subgun, bow and arrow, sharp stick"" film out there. What many didn't get is that this film pokes fun not only at itself, but all those previously mentioned films as well, without actually trying.

I haven't seen Rhona Mitra in very many films (maybe I'm not looking in the right genres), but it takes quite a bit to act badly in a film such as this, so she can be excused this time. Bob Hoskins, Malcolm McDowell and a VERY raspy sounding, older looking David O'Hara put in their trademark best considering the type of film this is. The sets couldn't have been very difficult to build, and the pyrotechnics were in excess, as usual.

There has been a glut of these types of films lately, as each tries to out do each other, but action buffs shouldn't be put off by all the negative reviews. Just pop some popcorn, go to the local Seven-11 and get a big mug of soda, put this film in the DVD player and sit back. You may just laugh yourself silly. I did.",1220140800,3,1214,4.48868778280543

The films suspenseful storyline will keep your eyes glued to the screen throughout action scene to action scene, right up to the climatic car chase involving one exquisite Bentley.
One of the best Action Films that i have ever seen.",1220140800,2,444,4.5625
3423312,3,B00195FUDC,"It was sad watching Doomsday. As a Scotsman and a germophobe, seeing Scotland fall to a nightmarish virus was tough, but that wasn't the sad part; the sad part was watching what started as a cool movie completely collapse by its finish.

Especially considering that Neil Marshall was at the helm in the Director's Chair. Marshall's last film&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Descent/dp/B000JJ5F0W/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Descent</a>&nbsp;is on my Amazon Listmania List of Impressionable Movies. So my hopes were high for Doomsday. But ultimately the impression that I was left with after Doomsday was that the movie was an average-at-best try at combining&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Outbreak/dp/B001CT876M/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Outbreak</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Mad-Max/dp/B000OCZD5G/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Mad Max</a>.

That all said, I was entertained. And, ewww, the gore! Man, this movie pulled no punches with some pretty heavy gross-outs. The action is fun and plentiful. The story flows well enough, but goes from somewhat believable to way over the top when it comes to what becomes of the social organizations at Ground Zero (formerly Scotland).

Rhona Mitra (of&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Practice/dp/B000O77SOK/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Practice</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Boston-Legal/dp/B0019NEMK6/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Boston Legal</a>) does a fine job (and is a pleasure to look at) in the lead role as a tough, highly trained special ops Major. As I watched her, I thought to myself, ""Now who does this remind me of?"" Ah, Kate Beckinsale in&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Underworld/dp/B000TGJ80I/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Underworld</a>! Mitra would be the perfect fit if the producers of the Underworld franchise ever needed a replacement for Beckinsale....Oh, well would you look at that...Beckinsale is out and Mitra is in for the lead role of the scheduled release of 2009's Underworld: Rise of the Lycans. Woof.

Check out Doomsday on DVD only because the unrated version will be more...um...let's say ""viral"" than the R-rated version that will make it to cable and satellite.",1219968000,,2439,7.342465753424658
3423313,2,B00195FUDC,"This is the worst movie I've seen in quite a while.

I am very forgiving when it comes to B movies. This one is a C- at best. Rhona Mitria is the only reason I didn't give it 1 star.

Think of every clich you can of a post-apocalyptic society and you've got this movie. It's Road Warrior, Escape from New York, and The Postman, with bits of I am Legend and Resident Evil all rolled into one bland yawnfest. (Note: Each movie in that list is vastly better than this one.) There is lots of gore and truly pointless fighting that all leads to a rather boring ending.

On the good side...well, I'm stretching here, but Rhona is attractive, Bob Hoskins isn't but his character was about the only really believable one in the movie. The effects are a little over the top, but competent. Oh, and it's better than No Country for Old Men. No joke.

I had heard that this movie was a parody of ""Day After"" movies, but it isn't. If it had been, then shooting the cute little bunny might have had some purpose. As it is, both the bunny and this movie are DOA.",1219795200,,1047,4.22

There's a walled off city/state (Scotland) quarantined after ""The Reaper Virus"" starts wiping out the populous. Ah, but a good hearted soldier scoops up a wounded child and airlifts her across the border, leaving her crying mother behind.

Of course, that child grows up to be aloof, cynical action heroine (Rhona Mitra) Major Eden Sinclair. When a future sleazy Prime Minister in London discovers that the long-dormant Reaper Virus is resurgent, he corrals an elite force to go over the wall and find the long lost scientist who may just have a cure. But the troops are also told: The mission is so Top Secret that if they don't find the cure, they can forget coming back.

So they hit Glasgow and are immediately set upon by a punk-rock band of wild survivors who seem to dig&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Adam-Ant/dp/B00008PX8O/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Adam Ant</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Siouxsie-Banshees/dp/B00006IJXN/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Siouxsie & Banshees</a>&nbsp;while having friends over for BBQ. Then it's off to the wilderness in hopes of finding Dr. Marcus Kane (Malcolm McDowell), who has gone back to the real old school...knights, jousting and gladiator battles. And yes, our merry band still has to find the cure and beat the clock to London.

It's all highly derivative and lots of fun, if not in the least bit original. But director Neil Marshall (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Descent/dp/B000IHY9TS/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Descent</a>) knows his way around creepy thrills and fast cars on deserted highways, along with a dry humor that makes ""Doomsday"" trip along entertainingly.

Imagine that exact sensation, that feeling of annoyance, crankiness, disappointment and mild frustration just before you groan aloud and roll your eyes, lasting for 120 minutes - at which point you will groan aloud and roll your eyes. Reading the other reviews I thought this might be a guilty pleasure - instead it's just a damn shame. I'd rather sign a 3-picture deal to play the corpse's groin in the next ""Weekend at Bernie's"" sequels than endure this again.",1219017600,2,559,4.714285714285714
3423317,2,B00195FUDC,"Being a moviegoer, you tend to realize very quickly that not everything is going to have superbly written characters, emotional depth and/or epic action sequences and sometimes you just want to watch a good dumb movie to entertain yourself for awhile. Criticize them all you want but films done by Paul W.S. Anderson (of Resident Evil and Alien vs. Predator) or Michael Bay (Pearl Harbor, Transformers) manage to entertain even when your brain is constantly being reminded the film is breaking all the laws of physics, using cliches one after another and bad dialogue. But sometimes even dumb movies can go beyond this and become utter travesties and so we have ""Doomsday"", the latest from Neil Marshall, which not only seems molded together with scenes from other movies but they're not even done properly.

It's the year 2035 and Britain has been hit by the Reaper virus, a particularly nasty and contagious disease. The government seals off the top half of Britain (read: Scotland) and basically just let the population die out or have them kill each other when they've resorted to cannibalism. However, evidence of survivors as well as a resurgence of the virus outside the walls prompts the government to try to locate Dr. Marcus Kane, a scientist who is believed to be in possession of a cure. With the help of other soldiers, the government sends in Major Eden Sinclair to hopefully find a cure before it infects the rest of the country.

I just have one question to ask: have you ever seen ""Escape from New York"" by John Carpenter? I know how cliche it is to bring up the comparisons but if you've ever watched it then start watching this, I don't think there is any way you can get that classic 80's flick out of your head. Eden might as well be a female Snake Plissken (complete with occasional eye patch), the scientist plays the President role while the band of thugs and rogues could just as easily be led by the late Isaac Hayes. And that's not the only film here as ""Road Warrior"" and ""Mad Max"" will cause familiarity and even ""Aliens"" which includes characters investigating a potentially hostile environment with other characters doing surveillance in a heavily-armored vehicle (named an APC no doubt) which then proceeds to run over a dude in a manner straight out of Cameron's classic. I think we're getting past the point of homage here and getting straight into ripoff territory.

So besides the large list of references, how's the film? Well not that great either. The violence is over-the-top and in one case, an unusual choice of food that will likely cause you to cringe, rather depraved. The plot's flimsy and the characters are barely likable but seeing 2 ""Descent"" alums pop up was fun. Speaking of which, Marshall's 2nd movie was an outright modern horror classic, a bright spot in the wave of films competing to see who can outgross each other the most (see the ""Saw"", ""Hostel"" and the recent ""Texas Chainsaw Massacre"" films). His first film, the werewolf-centered ""Dog Soldiers"" was decent but with his 2nd film, he really showed a potential since not only did it have likable characters but actually terrified but whatever momentum he was gaining is all but squashed here. Every director's got to have their one bomb (Spielberg's ""1941"", Fincher's ""Alien 3"") but this certainly takes the cake.

Ever go to the video store and rent something simply because there's nothing else to watch? And upon taking that film home, you realize just how bad the video selection is? Well that's no excuse: watch ""The Descent"" or re-rent even but stay clear of this one.",1218931200,3,3586,4.807131280388979
3423318,2,B00195FUDC,"I should have known when this movie started out with a Voice Over that I was in trouble.  But the visuals in the beginning were interesting, Scotland being devastated by a plague, people dying or killing one another, the place being walled off and quarantined as a no-fly zone.  It was mass pandemonium and if you ignored the VO, it was fun.

Flash forward 30 years or so and the whole movie goes to hell.  Everyone in the world is under impression that those locked off ""behind the wall"" have all died, except a nasty sleaze ball business man/politician (of course).  He knows that there is life back there, they've seen it on satellite... and now the nasty plague is appearing in other parts of the world, so they decide to send in a woman with a funky eye and a bad attitude to go over the wall (into the quarantine zone) and try to find a Doctor who was working on a cure for the plague before they walled in Scotland and left him there to die.

Once she crosses the wall nothing makes any sense anymore.  This movie makes a switch to a bad version of Mad Max... apparently there are thousands of survivors... and they have electricity and gasoline... most survivors must have been mechanics, tattoo artists and hair dressers because after the devastating plague everyone has Mohawks, piercings, tattoos from head to toe, and they have rebuilt their cars into trash heaps only fit for a demolition derby.  They throw ""Punk Rock Raves"" at dinner time and blast electronic music ALL the time.  They are also cannibals... but not your good natured cannibals that will hunt you down and eat you... they make a spectacle and a show of it. The concept goes completely out the window and anything said in the first half of the movie needs to be forgotten because it now no longer applies.

Example - In the beginning the world has no idea if there is any life on the other side of the quarantine wall.. after the token tough girl and her team cross the wall the people over there said ""any time we get near the wall your people shoot us down"" now WAIT a second... if you're encroaching on the wall enough to get shot, then obviously people know you are there... DUH.

Then we go from guns and explosions to swords and bows and arrows and people on horses mixed in with people in cars, and it all becomes such a cluster that unless you are some sort of die hard Mad Max fan... this movie is BAD.  Sure there is a little gore... but not as much as one would like... the plot is garbage, the acting is b-movie grade, and the script is laughable.  In all honesty I can't believe I sat through the whole movie... but I was folding clothes and didn't want to stop long enough to put in a different flick.",1218758400,,2695,4.387550200803213

The beginning of the film was slow and we have seen this story a thousand times. The middle was pretty much gory and pointless.  Until the end it got better but it came a little to late.  Lately I have seen my helpful vote count drop with vicious speed.  I am sorry but I am a reviewer and I will not dumb down my views on films.  I must speak my mind in these situations because lately films have hit rock bottom.  And I try to point out the good films from the bad and if I appear cruel or tough it's because I do this for all who read my reviews.  It means a lot to me that people take interest on my opinions in the realm of films.  I wanna thank  you all so much for taking the time to read and rate.  So, like I was saying the end of the film in which the heroes are being chased by nut jobs and they duke it out, I thought it was amazing.  It was funny and vicious, very cool.  If the movie could have sustained this formula that just works the film would have been at least decent.  So until the end of the film we feel justified for sitting through a tasteless movie that offered a stomach churning thrill ride that didn't deliver.  I must strongly recommend that anyone who isn't prone to watching gory movies STEER CLEAR OF THIS FLICK IT COULD MAKE YOU SICK.  Honestly this film pushed me to my limits.  So this movie wasn't original or thrilling (only
at the very end) but it redeemed it's self.  Please continue to rate me helpful.",1218585600,,1585,4.124183006535947
3423323,3,B00195FUDC,"Best way put, a proper-English hybrid version of Escape From New York meets Mad Max Beyond Thunderdome. After Scotland is on the receiving end of a nasty virus (no zombification this time, just get sick, moldly, and die), England puts up their own version of the Great Wall Of China to keep them out, and let them expire. 30 years later the virus makes a return, this time on England's side, and with the help of Rhona Mitra (taking a page from the Milla Jovovich/Kate Beckinsale butt-kicking female handbook), goes back to the Scottish side to see why survivors are still kicking there & if they contain a cure.

Problem lies in Doomsday is that you've seen every bit of it before in a variety of other movies. Other than the first two I mentioned, if you want knights like in Excalibur, they're here. Want mindless violence with a strangely large amount of gore, that's here too. But if your looking for originality, go elsewhere. But for mindless action/apocalyptic fun, this might be for you. Sure, you might think that Mitra is mostly eye candy, but with probably one of the worse female haircuts I've seen in a long time, she makes you forget how fine she really is here. But is that a good thing? Overall don't blind buy it just yet, rent it, try to have a good time and think if it's worth a second viewing/ownership after or just see The Road Warrior again for the one hundredth time. It's up to you.

P.S.: Honestly, without the Unrated/Gore Version this would have easily been a 6.0. Yeah, those gore scenes are the movie.

3423325,4,B00195FUDC,"Do we really need one more resolute and ballsy action heroine? I guess we do. Rhona Mitra plays Major Eden Sinclair, a lethal, no-nonsense soldier who leads a tiny task force into the teeth of hell. And she's pretty, too. For a one-eyed girl. DOOMSDAY is yet another post-apocalyptic adventure thriller, and it was good enough that I couldn't help but wallow in its grit and cheese and many tributes to cult cinema.

The plot: When a devastating epidemic sweeps thru the city of Glasgow, the sole recourse is to seal off Scotland's boundaries from the rest of the world, with Scotland's infected populace thus isolated and left to die. Years pass, and the blighted place comes to be known as No Man's Land.

Cut now to the year 2035, and, in the struggling city of London, the frightening Reaper virus shockingly resurfaces. There is one hope. It seems that, for the past thirty years, remote reconnaisance has been maintained on Glasgow. Recent photos reveal there to be scattered survivors in the decimated No Man's Land, so giving hope that a cure may exist. A small military squad is tasked with infiltrating Glasgow and bringing back this cure, and they have to do this in forty-eight hours.

The photos didn't lie. There are survivors in the quarantined zone. They're friggin' cannibals...

There are moments in this film when you're reminded of Mad Max or Escape to New York or Aliens or 28 Days Later. And it's fairly clear that the eyepatch-wearing Eden Sinclair is a wink at Snake Plissken. Me, I enjoyed the shlock elements. If you've seen any of the above-mentioned films, then you'll get that twinge of deja-vu as you lay eyes on the visuals depicting a city in decay, the urban-punk flesh-eating marauders sporting makeshift Road Warrior-type regalia, and APCs trundling thru a ravaged environment. So, no, DOOMSDAY doesn't pretend to be an original work. It does, however, strive to be entertaining, and achieves this goal with some good success.

I've said this before, there's nothing like a robust British cast to lend weight to even the silliest of plots. Malcolm McDowell, Bob Hoskins, Alexander Siddig, and gravel-voiced David O'Hara all help to make the campy and predictable storyline easier to swallow. And writer/director Neil Marshall isn't stingy with the action bits. Rhona Mitra, not only a stunning beauty but in fantastic shape, dispenses plenty of crunching beat downs on depraved rogues what tried to mess with this lady. Mitra's Major Sinclair definitely leaves an impression. Plus, I kinda dig her nifty fake eyeball, which comes with bonus features.

Hang on, though. In a story mishmashed with bizarre elements, what falls flat is the lowrent medieval arc. Still, in that sequence, Sinclair manages to take on a giant armored gladiator, so that's something. Earlier, we find that these folks in the castle were at war with the urban cannibals, and yet we never get to see this aspect play out. So, no combat staged between these two factions. To me, this is a small bone to pick, but I would've liked to have seen something so odd and culture clashy.

There should be enough gristle and bloody mess and decapitations here to sate the common gorehound. And as long as you realize that you're not supposed to take this film all that seriously, you'll enjoy this. There's a decided tongue-in-cheek flair to DOOMSDAY, what with all the blatant homages to John Carpenter and George Miller, what with the casualties numbering a collided-with cow and an exploded bunny, as well as the mohawked head cannibal entering the stage to Fine Young Cannibals' ""Good Thing."" Yeah, I dig it.",1218412800,3,3611,4.909836065573771
3423326,2,B00195FUDC,"Neil Marshall, the British born writer/director who brought us instant genre classics with Dog Soldiers and The Descent, writes and directs Doomsday, thus giving me somewhat high hopes.  As you can tell from the previous reviews here, Doomsday is about as derivative a flick as you will find, and sadly flatlines shortly after it's electrifying opening act.  In a post-apocalyptic future, Major Eden Sinclair (Rhona Mitra) and her crew are dispatched to a years-long quarantined land in search of a cure when an incredibly dead virus makes a comeback, and soon enough Sinclair and her crew become trapped, hunted, and brutalized in their effort to escape, and the clock is ticking.  Sadly, Doomsday isn't nearly as enjoyable as that description makes it sound.  While Marshall manages to weave some nice moments of action and some bloody gross-outs, Doomsday as a whole just comes off as something we've seen too often before, and seen done much better.  The comparisons to Mad Max, 28 Days Later, George Romero's Knightriders, and more are unavoidable, and sadly, Marshall's dialogue and story elements don't fare much better either.  Also featuring Malcolm McDowell, Bob Hoskins, David O'Hara, Sean Pertwee, and Alexander Siddig; all of whom are utterly wasted in what comes off as throwaway roles.  All in all, even if you loved Marshall's previous efforts and dig post-apocalyptic sci-fi flicks, Doomsday sadly disappoints.",1218412800,2,1427,5.259911894273127

And, if you had ever heard the director's take on this movie, it's not to rip-off from these movies (Road Warrior / Mad Max, Escape from New York, 28 Days Later, and more).  It is to pay HOMAGE to these films.  Also, it is meant to be fun!

Pleanty of action and gore (thankfully not any noticeable CGI, but old school wreckage), and some humor to tie it all together. This movie shows that it isn't taking itself too seriously, so why should you? And I must admit, I really enjoyed the female lead (Rhona Mitra).  Yes, she looks good in a tight, all black outfit. But even her slender stature doesn't keep her from bringing the pain.  Some felt that she looked to feminine to pull off serious action.  But hey, I'm a person who can enjoy butt-kicking from either gender.

If you are looking for a fun, fast-paced film that you can both laugh and squirm at, then this film is for you.

Then it becomes a HUGE, loud, moronic and overblown ripoff of several other movies.

Synopsis: ok, there is this hot bimbo who's also a top soldier who's sent into Scotland to rescue someone you don't care to know in order for the corrupt government to find the cure for the plague-like disease that wiped the UK as we know it. But upon arrival in Scotland the bimbo's team finds an army of ""elite"" street punks (looking like it they were in 1979) who manage to wipe them out using just improvised axes, knives and etc.

THEN... after some usual torture, the bimbo-soldier and her friends manage to escape while the punks from 1978 party the night away at the sound of Fine Young Cannibals (the band) and some vaudeville acts. Oh, did I mention that the punks are also cannibals? How symbolically subtle!!

THEN... after running though the woods, our binbo-soldier and her friends are captured by some sort of horse-riding post-apocalyptic-medieval knights wearing plate armour and swords, who live in a big castle whose  stained glass windows show Biohazard symbols. In order to escape, our bimbo-soldier has to fight the biggest, meanest man. She wins and the group escapes.

THEN... while being pursued, SURPRISE!!!! ...they bump into a underground facility where they find a BEAUTIFUL, new, shiny Bentley Continental GT begging to be used. What happens next is the obvious: the film transforms itself into a Bentley TV commercial and a&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Road-Warrior/dp/0790729342/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Road Warrior</a>&nbsp;ripoff as the post-apocalyptic-punks from 1978 go after the binbo, her friends and her Bentley. But there's something very strange I could not understand: a Bentley Continental GT has a top speed of 195mph... but here it can barely go over 65mph and escape from the old 1970's Vauxhalls and Bedfords the punks drive.

But it's ok... the bimbo saves the day and her beautiful Bentley when they fly in the air among flames after a head-collision with a bus. The bus gets blown as the Bentley rides away in the sunset. Beautiful!

And then it ends: the cure is found, the corrupt government is exposed by some means we see on the first scene of the film... and the bimbo soldier goes to the punks and gets hailed as the new queen.

So... if this is not ridiculous, then it must be a great comedy because I laughed the entire film. Thank God I did not have to pay to see this.",1217980800,6,2520,4.995226730310263

3423333,4,B00195FUDC,"The Good Things
*Quite a few fun action scenes (I loved the ending car chase).
*Some good special effects.
*Loads of gnarly violence for those who like blood and guts.
*Good filming style.  Lots of good camera angles.  Interesting colors, textures, and lighting.
*Characters are not bad; pretty fun to watch.
*Music score was great.  Soundtrack is not bad.

The Bad Things
*Not for the sqeamish.
*Not very original.  The whole storyline is almost exactly like ""Escape from New York,"" what with the wall surrounding Scotland, the one-eyed main character, and her quest to venture into an uncivilized place to get something out.  The beginning reminded me a little bit of ""Resident Evil Apocalypse."" Parts in the middle and the end resembled the ""Mad Max"" movies a lot.

The Questionable Things
*Fast-cut filming for the action scenes can be seen as either intense or annoying.
*It started off pretty good and serious, but became quite absurd as it went on (what with cars exploding for no real good reason, among other things).
*Some weird ending.

As I said above, this is what you get if you take ""Escape from New York"" and mash it up with ""Mad Max,"" ""Resident Evil,"" and perhaps the ""28 Days Later"" saga.  Even though ""Doomsday"" is not very original, it is still a great deal of fun to watch, for it does have some great excitement, fun characters, and interesting photography.  You can either sit back and enjoy, or become disgusted by the unoriginality, absurdity, and the gross violence.  Personally, I would almost prefer this over ""Escape from NY.""

The DVD has good video and sound quality, and includes both the rated and unrated versions of the film.  I forget what special features are included, but there ought to be a few good tidbits.

3423334,1,B00195FUDC,"""Doomsday"" may well feature one of the most badly botched movie premises I've ever seen. It starts off as a serious, bleak exploration of a ""what if"" scenario in the vein of ""Children of Men""... Then gradually down-spirals out of control. The last hour or so is very nearly a parody, complete with Mad-Max-style mohawked, tattooed, pierced, scantily-clad, cannibalistic psychopaths, absurd death car chases, and medieval knights. YES, I said medieval knights. However, being blatantly derivative is not the movie's problem. Its problem is that it's insulting to the viewers' intelligence. I can buy the cannibalistic savages, if I really suspend my disbelief. But the very notion that a nation can regress into an EXACT COPY of its own past, is... preposterous, to say the least. From a technical standpoint, it's just as bad. The editing is horrible. Hundreds of frames are sloppily thrown together (where each frame is less than a second long). Result? It's all but unbearable to watch. Makes you really appreciate old action flicks where most fight sequences happen in real time, and actors are actually seen doing some fight choreography. To top it all off, add some pretty horrible acting, a plot as thin as eggshells, a completely wasted Malcolm McDowell, and you've got ""Doomsday"". Normally I'll swallow just about anything post-apocalyptic, but even I couldn't stomach this godawful mess. Do yourself a favor and revisit the good ol' Road Warrior instead.",1217721600,4,1463,5.177215189873418

Sure, there are elements of many movies entertwined here: Escape from NY, Resident Evil, Gladiator, Aliens and Mad Max most prominently, but what movies aren't these days.

Despite that, there's one thing that can surely be said about DOOMSDAY. They sure knew how to put on a show. Amidst the squealing tires, exploding heads, bloody swords, fireballs, arrows, barbecues and splintering cars, you won't be able to take your eyes from the screen.

The best part about DOOMSDAY is that on top of the fact that the movie rolls across the screen like an active warzone, it has a great story and great characters. Rhona Mitra proves that she has the capability to be a tremendous action star, and nearly guarantees herself another job in DOOMSDAY 2.

I don't care what anybody says, DOOMSDAY is flat out proof that we've been robbed over the last few years with so-called action movies. This movie is a model of how to grab the viewers attention and keep it. Crazy action scenes, but all of them pheasible. DOOMSDAY has action scenes that suck you into the movie, instead of the junk we've seen in movies that are so over-the-top you just want to get your money back.",1217721600,6,1356,4.595041322314049

Can you say 28-Days later clone?  Even the music was cheesy - third rate talent just repeating the same lyrics over and over and over. Imagine being tortured with the words ""When two tribes go to war..."" - yes, just those five words - so repetitiously (not to mention poorly and off-key) that you have to mute the volume. Apparently they think screaming the lyrics louder and pounding the guitar make up for the lack of talent.  The heroine? Clone of Resident Evil.

Explosions: I swear, rocks explode. Billboards explode.  Anything that is involved in a crash explodes.  I'm honestly surprised that the horses did not explode as well.

Nothing about this movie makes any sense. Zero. Zilch. Nada. The writer (If anyone would claim this drek as their own) was probably on Meth while watching parts of Camelot, Dawn of the Dead, Army of Darkness, Resident Evil and 28 days later.  When he regained consciousness he probably thought he dreamed an original gore-fest.  Not even close.  I can't think of a single scene in this flick that was not ripped off from other movies.

You'll notice ideas also stolen from: Escape from NY, Coneheads (yes, Coneheads), Beyond Thunder Dome, Resident Evil: Apocalypse, Demolition Man - too many to list. They all did it much better.

There are any number of plot holes and/or things that simply don't make sense, but somehow it still manages to be enjoyable.  Rhona Mitra stars in this film, and she performs admirably and adds a much-needed air of credibility to the film.  Malcom McDowell and Bob Hoskins also have small parts in the film, and both helped me gloss over the movie's flaws.

The Blu-Ray has features a nice 1080P transfer; unfortunately, the same cannot be said of the audio mix.  The dialogue was a little soft, and the explosions boomed with a little too much authority, so you may either be adjusting the volume of the movie throughout, or simply dealing with extreme loudness intermittently.

The special features aren't bad, but they aren't spectacular, either.  There's a commentary here (I haven't listened to it), and some U-Control special features that are fairly interesting.",1217635200,2,1005,4.870588235294117

(I saw it), Escape From New York (we're in the giant land prison looking for something important for a facist gov't. who has pretty much written us off, oh and look here's a really smart guy too), along with the Stirling novel series Dies the Fire (in which man kind must resort to the medieval way of life. Didn't really care for them, but hey it works here), and Romero's Dead line, Resident Evil (eventhough I don't really care for them), and Children of Men.
Anyway, I got lost somewhere in there. Maybe that's what makes the film great, out of any of the latest Post-Apocalyptic films haven't been all that great, but for some reason this one is. Maybe its the sum of its parts. Take classic end of the world scenarios take the bits you like, mix & bake at 350 for 90 min. and you've got a great apocalyptic vision, which isn't really an apocalyptic movie if you payed attention.
Which brings me to my next question. Is the combination of all these different scenarios & story lines stealing or a homage to those great films and those that made them?
I lean toward homage. Or, maybe I'm just a sucker for post-apocalyptic visions & dystopian gov'ts.

  First off, this is a movie and not a film.
 Second, there is no feel to the movie.  Just when you get used to a theme of the movie or when you start to feel like your getting into it, the movie changes settings.

3423344,4,B00195FUDC,"Alright, so Neil Marshall quickly became one of my favorite new horror directors after his pitch perfect thriller, The Descent.  And of course, there's Dog Soldier which practically all Neil Marshall fans adore.  So, what does he do for his third movie?

He mixes together a ton of different movies and creates a B-grade flick; as we all know about B-grade flicks, unless your name is ""Tarantino"" or ""Rodriguez"" (both directors, I enjoy, by the way), your movie automatically begins with a disadvantage.  I don't really need to go into the plot (Scotland is a wasteland, there's cannibals and a tough-as-nails cliche...things die...people die...there's a couple car chases...credits roll), but what I will say is that I was absolutely and thoroughly entertained from the beginning to the end.

The picture and sound quality far exceeded my expectations.  The picture (1080p, of course) is presented flawlessly.  Crisp details and terrific coloring melded together to show off the complete carnage that happens.  Meanwhile, the audio is also pretty decent, but completely bombards you with sound.  Overall a terrific package and one that will showcase your HDTV well.

If you'll permit me, before I close this review, I wanted to share a little personal background.  When I saw this movie, I was in an unfamiliar town with absolutely nothing to do and no one to hang out with because I was there for training.  So, I did what any moviephile would and watched a lot of films in the theatre.  Of all the films I saw during that two month period, this was probably the best and made me forget, for a little bit, that I missed home and my friends.

So, it's probably understandable why I enjoyed this film so much.  But, even without that little added information, when you look at it, Doomsday is action-packed, expertly filmed and crammed full of awesome set pieces and battles.  And the finale was such an amalgam of everything that came before that you won't even think about how ridiculous the movie is until the credits are rolling.  Is it perfect?  No.  Is it as worthy as The Descent or other similarly categorized horror films?  Hell, no.  It's not even completely original.  But it was fun.

3423346,1,B00195FUDC,"Neil Marshall's third feature film which he wrote as well as directed is a major failure. His first two films, 2002's cynical werewolf movie ""Dog Soldiers"" and 2005's atmospheric subterranean monster movie ""The Descent"" were excellent examples of inspired low budget filmmaking. These films were brimming over with enthusiasm, wit and a quietly self-deprecating tone, such that a number of critics justifiably saw Marshall as the potential new leader of a resurgence in British horror. Both films had a slightly derivative quality, but then that has been a convention of the horror genre for decades. But there is a fine line between being creatively derivative and a plagiarist.

In ""Doomsday"" Marshall quotes from such a number of sources, in such an unimaginative and uncreative way that this film feels like a feature length exercise in plagiarism. Marshall fills his film with grotesques and grotesque performances and shamelessly enters the debased territory more commonly associated with the torture trash films of Eli Roth. The plot itself, which sees Scotland, placed in quarantine due to a highly infectious disease, is a bungled mixture of John Carpenters ""Escape from New York"" and ""28 Days Later"" lacking either films energy or style. It is filled with very grim faced and serious performances, and characters with stupid biblical names like Eden and Kane. The symbolism is ponderous and juvenile. Marshall's efforts at gravitas through a lazy and sloppy Malcolm McDowell voice over is a device quickly forgotten as Marshall sets about putting his Lara Croft clone (the horribly po-faced Rhona Mitra) into a series of ridiculous action sequences. The future as forecasted by Marshall is the 1980's, which is perhaps the only scary thing about the film. It is the same dystopian 1980's influenced vision of the future seen in the Mad Max trilogy, but at least those films were actually made in the 1980's. The use of 80's fashions, images and music makes very little sense. I'm not sure as to what Marshall intended with this.

It's not a total dead loss though. Marshall has a particular flair for exciting action sequences, and the chase scene towards the end of the film is superbly edited and very exciting. Marshall also manages through accident or design to address anxieties about Anglo-Scottish relations - a prescient topic at a time in which the question of Scottish independence is an important one. The total rejection and isolation of Scotland by the English parliament in a time of crisis offers an interesting distillation of current cultural anxieties. Marshall pitches the cynicism in central government quite well, but this is undermined by Bob Hoskins' (what in god's name is he doing in such drivel) chewing of the scenery. No doubt the allegorical leanings of the film will rescue it from the total obscurity it deserves, but for the British horror film this is a major regression. I was looking forward to whatever Marshall's third film turned out to be. He had got over the usually very difficult second film, but this will be a severe stain on his filmography.",1214265600,6,3096,5.068627450980392

Anyway,
I love female fronted action and science fiction movies.  I love Sigourney Weaver's Ripley and watch all the Alien movies all the time.

Anyway I like Mila Jovovich ok and the other female heroines like Pitch Black's Radha Mitchel.

However, when I saw this movie Doomsday.  Rhona Mitra totally blew me away.  I mean she was tough, but also had such acting range.  Like when fighting when she had the upper hand or had an idea for an offensive attack she would have a little glimpse in her eyes.  Basically I could just watch her portrayal of Maj Eden Sinclair and just think she is the best action heroine suited for that movie and rivals Sigourney Weaver.  While I feel Sigourney Weaver had great range in the Alien movies especially Aliens, Aliens 3, and Alien Resurrection.  Maybe Rhona Mitra doesn't have quite that range but for me she made this movie awesome.

I mean I saw Rhona Mitra on the show the practice and didn't think much of her other than she was very pretty.  But, this movie makes me really excited about seeing her in the new Underworld movie even though I am not into those.  I feel she would be better than Kate Beckinsale for me I feel Kate is to stuck up.

Anyway the the movie Doomsday.

It is basically to me a good against evil movie.  Not this grey the bad guys sometimes do good and the good guys sometimes do evil, but in this respect and old fashoined black and white drawn lines movie.

Now it is very violent.  I mean cooking a person and eating them.  In battle cutting of an arm and the head of an enemy.  A rabbit is shot and explodes by a sentinal gun.  A axe goes into the head of an enemy.  An ultraviolent but cool car chase.  A person being shot in the face with a shot gun at point blank range.  A persons hand being cut off because it is attached to a brief case, they were already dead though.  Cutting a guys throut.  You get the point.  But, I still feel it is good against evil so other than the rabbit there is a point to the violence.

The special effects, costumes, cinematography, and music were very good for I think 15mil dollars but may have been pounds they spent for the movie.  Anyway the music is really good I did a review for the soundtrack.  It is the only soundtrack I own.

Anyway I loved the movie as well as Neil Marshall's other movies like Dog Soldiers and another really voilent but good one the Descent.

I feel if you like action, scifi, good versus evil, and kind of like wierd indie alternative movies you may like this one I did.

I'm already declaring it one of the top ten guy movies of all time.

There is a terrible viral outbreak in Scotland, and the best way to deal with it is isolation. The entire country is condemned and sealed off with a massive wall full of firearms to keep out the undesirables. Allow decades to go by and all is well. Right?

Evidently not. People survive, evolve, and turn into a raping, murdering, cannibalistic horde hell-bent on survival. Unfortunately for those outside of the quarantine zone the virus has returned, and it's up to the government to go back into the original land of infected and find the cure amongst the survivors who want nothing more than to destroy and consume all who dare to invade their turf.

Rhona Mitra is a hardened, lethal, and incredibly hot leader of the group sent in for the nearly hopeless mission. From beginning to end she is on a race for survival - blasting, kicking, stabbing, and decapitating her way to a possible cure and eventual freedom.

Doomsday is action packed throughout, and it's surprisingly beautifully filmed, with great shots of the countryside as well as the dirty, urban environment left to fend for itself. It's a great action movie, great post-apocalyptic movie, has tons of worthwhile battles and gore, and is an all-out blast.

Anyway, here's the plot for ""Doomsday"" before we get started; a virus breaks out on er, well, April 03 2008 (should that be ""has broken out""?) in Glasgow, killing pretty much everyone. So a giant wall is built around Scotland separating them from the rest of healthy Britain, leaving the Scots to perish. All is well until, 30 years later, London starts to show signs of the virus, and so they have to send someone (Rhona Mitra, sporting a fake eye that lets her see round corners.. yeah, I know) to try and find a cure from the newly discovered survivors in Scotland.

With me so far?  Well, it's hard to know where to start with this one. I mean, as this is my first ever theatrical review, I don't want to give away too much of the plot for those who haven't yet seen it, and so I can't really say too much or give away just how deeply, brain-smashingly stupid it all gets.

It's a real shame it has to be this way, Doomsday coming from writer/director Neil Marshall, the same guy who brought us the ultra ace ""Dogs Soldiers"" and the slightly inferior but still ace ""Descent"" has obviously sat and watched a load of awesome 80s movies and thought, ""hey.. I can do that.""

Hey Neil - no you can't.

Here's a small hint for Neil; if you're going to steal little bits from, say, ""Aliens"" (the big tank things in Doomsday even have the same ""door opening"" sound effect as the big tank things in that super sequel), fairly large bits like, say, the barbaric neo-punks from ""Mad Max"" or big bits like, say, most of the plot of ""Escape From New York"", (complete with a brooding 80s synth score) then its best not to have the audience wish they were watching those movies instead of this bewildering mess.

What's annoying is that, for the first forty minutes or so, its a fairly convincing, (dare I say the word ""gritty""?) portrayal of a country gripped by a disease it can't cure. Its a sombre watch, all death, decay and violence, backed up by suitably restrained performances from the likes of Bob Hoskins.

Remember that word, ""restrained"", because its the last time you'll see it here.

So far, so good then. In fact, the first time the group of soldiers are attacked by the savage survivors is a taught, frightening nerve-jangler. And.. then.. just like that, it absolutely, positively NOSE-DIVES.

Honestly, its like two different movies have been strung together. If you're going to show a realistic depiction of a dying country, its hard to stomach surreal scenes of the barbaric hordes, complete with MICROPHONES and stadium sound, performing dance routines for each other. Never mind the fact that three quarters of the cast at this point have seemingly forgotten how to act, the film has quickly lost its realism and scare-factor - in fact, its all a little embarrassing.

Sadly, it only gets worse from there. When they meet the next band of survivors its like they've stumbled back in time, with every single person dressed like extras from the first Blackadder movie, complete with KNIGHTS on horses, peasants wrapped in shawls and other versions of perfect period costume. When it comes to the most ridiculous car chase scene in history (with our heroine driving a mint condition Bentley that is seemingly made from the same indestructible material K.I.T.T was built with) you'll either be laughing in the aisles, queuing up to get your money back or facing the most ""HUH?"" ending ever. Its at this point that logic has been completely removed from Doomsday, and there are several crater size plot holes I won't mention here, and let you find out for yourself.

With Rhona Mitra's character Eden, it's clear Marshall was aiming for a super cool, Snake Plissken character. She fails. She's not believable or even that likable, and the various no-mark fodder that she tags along with are barely worth the screen time. The main cannibal, Sol, is too over the top and too badly acted to be any kind of menacing screen presence, and Malcolm McDowell actually looks embarrassed to be there. Who can blame him?

Basically, there are about 100 films that deserve your attention this year, and while it would be nice to cast a vote for the ""little"" film that could, this one most certainly couldn't.

3423361,4,B00195FUDC,"The Reaper Virus has broken out in Great Britain. A wall is built and as many people as possible who aren't infected are evacuated. A wall is built to try and quarantine the virus. It works...until now. Thirty years later, the virus has broken out again. Survivors are discovered on the other side of the wall which brings hope for a cure. A team of special forces, including Eden Sinclair, are sent to the other side of the wall to try and find the cure. The survivors aren't exactly normal though, as they've become cannibalistic savages and will basically kill and/or eat anyone that stands in their way. Will a cure be found and will Sinclair and her team be able to get back in one piece?

The best part of this movie, in my opinion, is the fact that it uses elements from a lot of my favorite movies to its advantage and the end result is spectacular. Not only is it incredibly gory, but the film also reminded me of films like Aliens, Gladiator, and even 28 Days Later. There's also the obvious comparison to Mad Max and I've even heard it has similarities to The Warriors, but since I haven't seen enough of either film to compare them...I can't really say.

Sol, played by Craig Conway who was also the main crawler in The Descent, has to be one of the most extreme, violent, and hardcore characters to come along in a long time. He's the type of character that is just angry all the time. With that kind of passion and energy, he tends to steal just about every scene he's in. As tough as he is, he tends to fail in comparison to Sinclair, played by Rhona Mitra. She doesn't seem to care about anything and always manages to find a way to get out of whatever situation she's in. She has to be one of the most fierce and dominant female characters I've ever seen grace the screen. Watching the savages, the way they live, and what they do to survive is a bit strange...but you won't be able to look away. Malcom Macdowell does a good job as Kane. You hear him more than you actually see him. I was a bit disappointed with Bob Hoskins' role in the film. I thought he was really impressive in Unleashed, but he didn't really bring the charisma he had in that film to Doomsday. I guess his role didn't really require as much this time around, but still. I was a bit letdown.

The scenes where all hell breaks loose are the most fun. Watching the battle sequences, the deaths, and especially the car chase at the end all make this film worth seeing alone. I don't really want to spoil anything, but let's just say you're in for a few surprises. I can honestly say I didn't really lose interest in the film from beginning to end either. Some films have slow parts or parts that drag way too long, but I felt like there was enough going on in this that I was interested the entire time.

I think Doomsday is a wild, fun, bloody ride for anyone willing to give it a chance. If you like sci-fi films with a touch of horror to them, then this is definitely a film for you. Also, if you're a fan of Neil Marshall's past work, like Dog Soldiers and The Descent, then I think this is a must see for you.

3423362,1,B00195FUDC,"This is one of the most embarrassing movies i've ever seen.

It takes a few elements from many different classic movies (aliens, 28 days later, mad max, blade runner, V for vendetta just to name a few) put them in a blender and use the resulting mix as an excuse for a story. Really, the story makes so little sense that it more looks like a series of action scenes strewn together at random.

The story goes more or less like this: a nasty virus kills thousands in scotland, the government decides to shut the whole country off building a steel wall to contain the disease, leaving everyone inside to fend off for himself. 25 years later the same virus shows up in london. the powers that be decides that to avoid a widespread infection they have to reveal their biggest secret: there are survivors in scotland, not everyone's dead. so they rack up a ""elite team"" to go inside, find the survivors and possibily a cure for the disease.

***SPOILER WARNING***
After going inside the team finds out that humanity actually survived and split into two different factions: some kind of madmax-like tribe where everyone is between age 20 and 30 and, despite the abundance of cow meat, a cannibal and a medieval tribe living in a castle.

I won't go into further details about the story, just know that it includes everything from car chases, arena fights, knights in armor, barbequed heroes and a steam train...
***SPOILER WARNING***

The movie itself is technically well made, it's evident they had a good budget to work with and the cast, comprising some second-rank celebrities, considering the plot did a respectable job.

The problem is that the plot is so... so... senseless that the only reason to watch this through the end is that you already paid for it, so...

And the ending is so inane it's really beyond description, you'll stare blankly at the screen thinking: ""what?""

3423365,3,B00195FUDC,"Doomsday (Neil Marhsall, 2008)

What should concern us is not that Doomsday is a silly, derivate ripoff of Escape from New York. What should concern us is that somehow no one in Hollywood managed to come up with a silly, derivative ripoff of Escape from New York-- a movie far more deserving of a silly, derivative ripoff than most that get ripped off-- before the Brits managed it. And to top it off, Doomsday is not only derivative, it's mind-numbingly stupid, full of plot holes, riddled with terrible dialogue, desperately cheesy, and just about every other bad thing you can say about a major blockbuster. I loved every second of it.

The story: in 2008, a virus called Reaper ravages Scotland to the point where the rest of Britain simply walls it off and leaves the populace to die. In 2035, London has become the same overpopulated morass Glasgow was before Reaper struck-- and it rears its ugly head again. Bill Nelson (Bob Hoskins), the head of defense for the British government, sends his best operative, Major Eden Sinclair (Rhona Mitra), into Scotland to track down survivors that have been captured by satellite photography in the hopes that Scotland has managed to find a cure for the disease. What Sinclair and her team find, however, is a lot more than they bargained for; it seems a good portion of the populace has survived, and they're not exactly welcoming of outsiders.

It may be a bit misleading to call Doomsday an Escape from New York ripoff, given that there are snatches of so many movies to be found here; The Hills Have Eyes (the original, not the horrible remake), Aliens, The Road Warrior, the Aussie TV show The Tribe, and any number of others can be found if you look hard enough. You might even see Takashi Miike if you turn your head and squint just right; the outrageous climax is straight out of the Dead or Alive series, at least in how far you have to stretch your disbelief. And ultimately, that's what kept me from hating it; Marshall simply threw all pretense at things like realism and continuity out the window, and just made the stupid movie he wanted to. There's no technical level at all on which I can appreciate the movie, and yet I have little doubt that at some point in the future  will end up in my movie collection, to be taken out and watched in the same way I watch Kingdom of the Spiders or Night of the Lepus now. And besides, all this and Frankie Goes to Hollywood on the soundtrack? How can you possibly miss? ***",1206403200,,2475,4.5675675675675675
3423366,2,B00195FUDC,"Just a note--as with all reviews this is designed to help those who haven't seen the film decide if they want to see it, if you disagree write a review (that's also what the comments section is about the voting isn't about whether or not you agree or disagree but if it helped you decide to see the film...)

In ""Doomsday"" a viral outbreak threatens the residents of the UK. Isolated to Scotland, the area is quarantined and sealed off with a giant metal wall. One survivor who made it through was Eden Sinclair (Rhonda Mitra). Eden is sent back by her boss (Bob Hoskins) with a team to find out if the survivors there led by Kane (Malcolm McDowell)have a cure when there is a viral outbreak in London. They find that Scotland has reverted to savagery and that they'll be lucky to get out alive much less back with a cure.

A homage (or tribute if you don't want the fancy term)does many things--1)It reinvents the genre it is a tribute to 2)borrows from those films in a knowing way winking its eye in many cases 3)gives new life to what have become cliches. ""Doomsday"" is homage as karoke--it looks and sounds like the films it is a tribute to but often hits the wrong notes.

The film begs, steals and borrows from other fims without breaking any new ground or being innovative in any way (or refreshing the genre). A good example of a ""homage"" that works is ""28 Days Later"" or even the ""Resident Evil"" films that borrow a number of ideas and make them their own. It's not a bad film just one that lacks invention outside of the production design (which itself borrows from the ""Mad Max"" trilogy, ""Escape from New York and its sequel ""L.A."", ""Damnation Alley"" and other flicks.

The cast is top notch with Bob Hoskins, Malcolm McDowell, Rhona Mitra, Alexander Siddig (""Kingdom of Heaven"", ""Star Trek: Deep Space Nine""), David O'Hara (""The Departed""),Sean Pertwee (""The Tudors"", ""Event Horizon"")doing the best they can with the material.

The one thing here that director/writer Neil Marshall has working in his favor is his inventive staging of action sequences. Marshall who made ""The Descent"" and ""Dog Soldiers"" has an ability to turn a genre inside out reinventing it in the process in most cases. With ""Doomsday"" it doesn't quite work but it is an enjoyable ride even if we've seen all the sights before. I'd wait for the DVD.",1206316800,9,2333,4.612048192771084
3423367,4,B00195FUDC,"Say what you want about movies being unoriginal today, when it comes to ""Doomsday"" I don't particularly care.  This type of movie has been rehashed many times, but I really thought this was a great movie and very well done!  Regardless of the fact that I'm probably partially biased towards the Post Apocalyptic theme (one of my favorite story lines), I can't help but advocate this film.  I think it was well done and had a pretty smart story-line.  It drew from all the greatest elements it could to combine into one killer movie!  However, in retrospect, and after conversing with another person, most moviegoers might see this as a three star film rather than four.  Like I said above, I'm probably biased towards the story line and good action is good action.

What we have here is an amalgamation of great films rolled into one.  Picture if you will a Mad Max type of character put into Scotland, but Mad Max isn't played by a male character, he is played by the Jill Valentine character type found in ""Resident Evil.""  Let's not also forget the obvious character influence from Snake Plisken found in the ""Escape from New York"" movie.  Furthermore there is a major viral outbreak that borders on themes drawn from ""28 Days Later"" and ""Resident Evil"", but in this scenario it is more of a plague concept and people actually stay dead from this!  I would say the primary influence came from the Mad Max series.  The main character Eden Sinclair is a cop of sorts and she suffered a familial loss.  It's definitely a Mad Max archetype if I ever saw one!  But certain nuances like the eye patch come from Snake; however this element isn't in the movie enough to be overly distracting in its obvious nature.  However, I loved the thought of a Jill Valentine playing in that role.  Though, I would venture to say that Rhona Mitra drew more influence in actually acting like Alice (Mila Jovavich) from ""Resident Evil"" because she was pretty cold and uncaring in feel, though the character base feels more like Jill Valentine (Sienna Guillory) from the same film.  Further, there are a huge amount of car chase scenes that are very ""Road Warrior"" in nature.  The people that seem to live in some sort of run down tribal society were very reminiscent of ""Beyond Thunderdome.""  Though, now that I think of it the gang seemed more like the crew Marek led in ""No Escape.""  Thankfully Tina Turner did not show up as a cameo in this film, nor did Master Blaster show up to challenge our main character to a ""two men enter, one man leaves"" battle to the death scenario.  No, this movie kept its premise to heart and loaded in the action sequences for us to really get behind the characters.

Here's the general synopsis of the film, now that I've gone over the major influences.  There was a major outbreak on the island where England and Scotland reside.  There was no cure so the government had to adopt extreme measures.  What they did was block off all of Scotland off from England and moved as many of the unaffected into England as possible.  Like in ""Resident Evil: Apocalypse"" there was a situation at the gate where people started to attack and they closed the gate before everyone could leave.  This is where it also takes on the ""Escape from New York"" concept.  However, it's different than ""Escape from New York"" because the gating off of the land is not because of economic strife and general degeneration of society, but because of the virus.  However, some of the adverse affects of gating are similar since it resulted in warring factions and gangs.  Like ""28 Days Later"" the viral concept is very similar and rather than being called ""Rage"" it's called the ""Reaper Virus.""  It's different than both ""28 Days Later"" and ""Resident Evil"" in the sense that it wasn't developed conspiratorially by the government and they lost control.  Rather the background of this viral infection isn't touched upon, just that a plague appeared and it got out of control, this all happened in 2007.  The year is now 2033 and it would appear their plan worked.  Everyone assumes the population of Scotland has been wiped out, but Satellite coverage of the area shows people clearly are still alive there (this is a top secret satellite mind you).  To make matters worse the Reaper Virus is back and in that time the population in England has exploded, society has degenerated due to that, and created an environment ripe for plague.  Now the clock is ticking and the government needs to do something.  The fact there are people living in Scotland indicates there is probably a cure.  Eden Sinclaire is called in to lead a special team to extract that cure.  The eminent virologist Kane was left behind the gate, it's up to her to try and find him!

As you can see they went with the female action star concept of Alice from ""Resident Evil"", but as you've seen, I've drawn her character design more akin to Jill Valentine. She's kind of a combination of the two characters, now that I think about it.  The world that was left behind the gate has become a shadow of itself and degenerated into a far more barbaric society.  The first living people Eden and her team come across are the vagrants/punk rockers who have developed some sort of tribal styled society.  There is the alpha male and his, naturally hot (in an, ""I have tattoos on my face"" kind of way), alpha female.  I will say that I wasn't expecting the movie to be this brutal in scenes.  It does get kind of gory, but not so much that you want to stop watching the film (for those who aren't into the gore thing).  Rather they are quicker scenes that flash across the screen, but there isn't a large amount of gore in the film overall, definitely less than one percent.  Probably on par with what you saw in ""Silent Hill"" (for those who've seen it).  Anyway, I was expecting a better fight between our lead actress and the girl with her face tattooed, unfortunately we didn't get that.  However, the final fight scene was highly original in my opinion and did make up for the lack of that major battle I was expecting between the two girls.

The second group of people encountered are lead by Kane (Malcom McDowell), the man she was sent in to look for.  Malcom McDowell did a superb in this role I thought and really added an intelligent, yet insane, feel to his character.  Kane did an interesting thing and developed an entirely different society built on medieval concepts.  This is actually foreshadowed in a final transmission from him when England and Scotland were still in contact all those years ago during the final stages of the plague.  Kane and his people even held up in an old Scottish castle and wore period clothing and armor.  They also used medieval weapons as their primary armament.  I thought this was great and there is nothing funnier than seeing serious medieval people walking into a room that says ""gift shop"" on the outside.  Not sure why they left those signs up from the old world, probably for humor value for the film makers and viewers.  At this point I couldn't help but think this movie was influenced by the book ""World War Z"" by Max Brookes because of the use of the castle.  Or perhaps we're seeing a sort of ""Reign of Fire"" influence in this film here as well.  However, the way it was used was more akin to ""World War Z"", I think.

There were very few areas that I had a major problem with in this film.  One scene that kind of stood out was when the team first located the lab the viral research was originally being done in.  When they got there they were attacked by the gang and to film the people running in the door and being shot, it seems it was filmed only once and then replayed when they wanted to have another round of people shot.  I'm not entirely sure why they did this, because I couldn't help but think by the time they replayed that scene a bunch the attackers would have been stumbling over the dead bodies.  It's cleverly spliced between scenes of the team being flanked and the team covering the front of their position.  So it's not overly noticeable.  The other area that was sort of out there was when Eden managed to find a high performance vehicle.  No, finding it wasn't an issue for me, it was that when she was being chased by these other run down vehicles they somehow kept up quite well.  Eden's care should've been easily outperforming these other basic vehicles that were chasing her.  My girlfriend and I agreed that just about all car commercials should be filmed in this manner now.  The gang from a dead society chasing the driver around the roads of a dead country... perfect car commercial!

At any rate, it's been a lengthy analysis, but surely enjoyable.  I think any fan of action would enjoy this movie, and surely if you've seen the other movies I've referenced in this review.  People that love the Post Apocalyptic scenarios would find great merit in seeing this movie.  I actually thought the acting was pretty well done overall.  The only character that felt slightly out of place was Bob Hoskins as Bill Nelson.  I found it hard to believe his character would be rubbing elbows with parliament, but I did enjoy his presence in the film for sure.  Did anyone else recognize the Prime Minister?  Alexander Siddig played Hamri Al-Assasd in season six of 24 most recently.  Clearly he's had a bit of an elevation from being ex-terrorist to being prime minister and we can't forget him as the kindly Saracen from ""Kingdom of Heaven.""  It was an interesting sequence of roles for him.  The main character played by Rhona Mitra, I must say, was not really on my radar.  I looked up her profile on imdb and I haven't really seen anything she was in, but this seems to be one of her first roles as an action star.  I thought she did an excellent job in portraying her character that is based on so many others.

I'm not going to give away anymore of the plot.  It certainly met my expectations and kept me in my seat wanting more.  The only thing I'm hoping for now is that it doesn't get ruined with a sequel.  I seriously loved the ending of the movie, it was so different from many of the others, but typical for a Mad Max archetype (sort of).  Part of me wants them to leave the movie as is and let it stand on it's own as a great film, but another part of me wants to see more to find out what else happens in that world.  I'm only going to give this four stars mainly because it's not a hundred percent original, but I think it is definitely worth checking out.",1206316800,3,10498,4.522015915119363

3423369,3,B00195FUDC,"In a futuristic Great Britain, a lethal virus has begun to decimate the population. In an effort to contain the disease, the bureaucrats build a 30-foot wall around Scotland,effectively quarantining the population within (and I suppose they sit through this passively making no attempt to escape). The wall is successfully completed and the problem of the virus considered solved. Meanwhile, the world in general is crashing, with rampant poverty and crime, run by a handful of power mongers.

Thirty years along, the virus raises its ugly head again, in a world ruled by a few and where the majority are packed into ghettos - a perfect breeding ground for the Plague. Coincidentally, it's discovered via surveillance satellite cameras that there are survivors behind the quarantined enclosure, and it is decided that someone has to get in there to find the cure for the disease. A maverick young female cop, completely fearless, is chosen, and goes in with a crack team...but we know that the road won't be an in-and-out waltz.

Borrowing shamelessly from any number of post-Apocolyptic movies, most notably the Mad Max series (I gave up counting the scenes and/or personnel lifted in toto from Mad Max 2 and 3), our hero Major Eden Sinclair (Rhona Mitra) forges through fire and cannibals to get the immune daughter of a plague scientist out of the walled area and back to 'civilization' where her blood can be used as a vaccine to cure the plague victims in the Free Zone. The car chases, the cars themselves, and the wild and evil denizens of the walled area of Scotland, were so obviously taken from Mad Max that I could predict the next scene.

I wanted to like this movie, as the good guys were all buff and filled with fortitude, and the bad guys were so gorgeously gory, but overall I ended up comparing it unfavourably in too many places to movies that had already covered this ground. The original Mad Max 2 - known better in the U.S. as the Road Warrior - had a freshness and originality in the early 80s that served the story well; the plot was better defined; and the score, by Brian May, showed direction and purpose, while the score of Doomsday could not approach the same level. For those who are unfamiliar with the earlier post-Apocolyptic movies, Doomsday will fill a niche, and it certainly wasn't boring; but I found it lacking in so many ways. I recommend finding a copy of 'Mad Max 2' instead. A movie movie, it effectively tells the same basic story of survival in a far better way.",1205971200,,2507,4.719178082191781
3423370,4,B00195FUDC,"Neil Marshall's follow-up to 2006's The Descent truly, honestly is one mixed-up bag. Doomsday is pure cinematic anarchy, but it's chaos that's under control and in the right hands. The film starts off as a deadly virus sweeps over Scotland leaving people and families in disarray. The government is able to contain the outbreak by putting up an impenetrable wall; sealing off the country from the rest of the world. Years later, the government has reason to believe that some may have actually survived the infection and begin wondering if there's a possible cure so they send in a top security force to investigate.

Leading the mission is the one-eyed Eden Sinclair, played with sexy machismo by Rhona Mitra, who is basically playing the female version of Snake Plisskin from John Carpenter's Escape from New York (one of the characters is even named ""Carpenter""). In fact the almost the first 20 minutes of Doomsday feels like a straight cover version of Escape from New York; using the same opening title font and 80's synthesizer score provided by Tyler Bates. Once inside the infected zone their team is ambushed by a gang of psychotic cannibal punks, and one of Sinclair's squad is cooked up and served to the gang. Mmm... toasty!

Some seem to be having a difficult time pinning down exactly what Neil Marshall's film is suppose to be. Is this a rip-off of past B-movies, or a loving homage, or is it something else entirely. Honestly, I'm not even sure what Doomsday is exactly. It feels has if Marshall has gone through a dozen 80's B-movies and taken his favorite elements and mixed them together in one explosively, combustible movie. I think there were a few clever ideas that if you look closely you might find funny (i.e. an emergency exit sign inside a castle?). Marshall stays so true to the essence of the genre that I'm positive he even included some of its flaws; like occasional continuity errors (yes, it's suppose to be funny that that Bentley is practically spotless at the end, after flying through that bus).

The film is like the equivalent to a greatest hits album; every 20 minutes the movie morphs into something different; from Escape from New York to The Warriors to Mad Max to Braveheart to Gladiator and ending with a car chase that seems ripped out of The Road Warrior. The film never stops moving and never stops evolving. Sounds incredibly uneven, right? Well it is, and yet strangely it almost doesn't seem to be a major flaw when I think about it. The strangeness of the film's structure is almost an interesting blessing in disguise. I don't think I could very easily defend this film in the traditional sense of ""good/bad"" cinema, but I'll be damned if I wasn't fully entertained for it's entire 105 minute running time, which felt like a quick 20 minutes. I was never bored, or even close to being bored. That's entertainment, and this film could have easily been another 30 or 40 minutes longer and I wouldn't have cared.

Doomsday is a film that is cut from the same table cloth as last year's Grindhouse. It may not be refined great cinema, but sometimes a nice sloppy joe can be just as satisfying as prime rib. Doomsday is about having fun, not about making much sense, or all the other things that tend to get in the way of entertainment value. Neil Marshall splatters virtually everything on screen; from cute, little bunnies to a leather-clad gimp, and does so by smashing the pedal to the metal and blazing across genres and cinematic styles and does it with such panache it makes it nearly impossible to not say that I enjoyed the ride, even if it was a familiar, bumpy one. It was a true experience; an exercise in visceral anarchy, both physically and narratively. This isn't the kind of movie you go see because of it's originality, but rather because of it's familiarity. If you love the movies that Marshall loves, then I'm sure you'll have a blast.

At a time when studios crank out pointless remakes and disappointing, over budgeted sequels, it's nice to see a movie where a director (with a much smaller budget) can throw just about anything and everything into a single movie and create one crazy-fun ride out of it. Logic put aside, originality temporarily shelved; Doomsday packs as much bang for your buck as anyone has any right to ask for. Shut up. Sit back. And relax. Take a load off and enjoy the ride. It's all that matters in the end--just have fun. Doomsday is pure formula, but it's a proven and tested formula that works. The movie is comprised of the best parts of genre films and compacted into one flick. I'd rather sit through a film like this than have to suffer through a serious-minded attempt by some hack film director to actually remake Escape from New York or The Road Warrior. If you went in expecting a horror movie or a science fiction movie or a movie that was to be taken seriously, then you went to the wrong movie.",1205798400,4,4906,4.660508083140877
