7820203,3,6301972112,"Arrived on time, no damage.  I never could get any sound from this, plus it is in black and white (I thought it would be in color).  I'm not sure if it is my VHS or the movie.  I wish they had this in DVD.  I ended up watching this without the sound, and I think I would have really liked it if I could have heard it.",1483747200,,317,3.6176470588235294

7820209,5,6301972112,"If you like the Pink Panther cartoons, then you will like this one! The Pink Panther is cold and hungry on Christmas. He'll try anything to get a hot meal, but nothing seems to work out for him (as usual). There is no dialog, but I think this just enhances the special. I also really love the songs! Its pretty funny and enjoyable. One drawback is the animation is alot like the other pink panther cartoons (which are fairly old) (Think: ""Yes Virgina, there is a Santa Claus"") So its a bit crude and only a few colours are used (alot of the stuff seems overly pinky/orange). But its still great to watch and I love it! And the ending is cute too! Good for kids or any nostalgic adults.",1037059200,25,685,4.276923076923077
7820210,4,6301972112,"This video is wonderful!  Although not top-notch Pink Panther humor, it still is a holiday delight.  Cleverly animated, it's a lot of fun to watch and is a wonderful Christmas video.",944006400,8,182,4.838709677419355
