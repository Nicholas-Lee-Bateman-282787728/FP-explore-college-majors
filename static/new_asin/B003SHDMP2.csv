I found these to be very mind expanding, and I felt like I was at the heart of the Greek geniuses of ancient days, breaking out of the limited matrix of modern scientific atheistic, a-spiritual ignorance.",1361232000,,239,4.690476190476191
4188352,1,B003SHDMP2,"I bought this appalling piece of academic dishonesty misled by its title, which made me believe it would be a serious, scientific and educational material. What I saw instead, and there is no way I'll ever have those 2 hours of my life back, was an ugly (in every sense) show of religious proselytism, poorly trying to pass itself as science. I am perplexed at this man's nerve, misusing serious, respected scientists' names and twisting their words in such a shameless fashion. I didn't even try to get my money back : I just took some sturdy scissors to each disc and threw the pieces in the garbage, where they belong. I am usually against the destroying or burning of books and other intellectual works, but this is neither work nor intellectual, and it embraces and encourages ignorant arrogance in such a way that it would probably have benefitted from the flames. At least they might have crept some light into this obscurantist, self-important and tacky piece of crap.",1293840000,4,976,4.781065088757397
8404366,5,B003SHDMP2,The most perfect explanation of Christianity so far. There is no church involved. Your life is between you and God. Just make sure that no church intervenes to keep you from discovering God in your self. The most real presentation of reality I have ever seen.,1467590400,,259,4.6521739130434785
8404367,5,B003SHDMP2,Great movie- very informative.,1464048000,,30,6.75
8404368,1,B003SHDMP2,"This is a gawd awful piece of crap! I would rate it zero stars if I could. It is mainly a non-sensical word-salad of meaningless statements based on highly contrived premises assumed to be true. I also believe it fraudulently uses sound recordings that are supposed to be Stephen Hawking speaking to provide platforms from launching a number of unhinged rantings, but the recordings say things that Dr. Hawking would never utter, for example calling Gravity a force, which science has known is not true since Einstein published his General Relativity papers 100 year ago. (What appears to be gravitational force is the impact of the warping of space-time by the presence of mass, and Dr. Hawking understands that.)

I did fall asleep partially through the movie and woke up just in time to hear a wonderful gem of whacky logic. The argument was made that because we could not see or measure the farthest reaches of the galaxy, they simply did not exist, by definition (by their definition, I guess). I think this same logic should be applied to God.",1449273600,,1049,4.795580110497237
8404369,2,B003SHDMP2,"the cosmographical videography was good until then (Hawkings digested) but the hurdles were too high, because even we know amazon is not the center of the universe~geesh",1436745600,,169,5.296296296296297
8404370,1,B003SHDMP2,"More deceitfulness from delusional Christians!  Trying to trick people into thinking they are going to watch a documentary based on good science, when all it is, is more Christian hidden propaganda. Christianity is a schizophrenic induced psychotic delusion, why? Because belief in a god is having an imaginary friend.  Believing in a god, and/or its son, (another fictional character), is like believing in Santa, if you're good, you are on the good list, and you will be rewarded, if you are naughty (by not believing in an imaginary friend), then you are on the naughty list, and you will be punished.

We are in the 21st Century, stop believing in fairy tales.",1427241600,3,664,4.910714285714286
8404371,5,B003SHDMP2,"I have enjoyed this series very much.  It is refreshing to find a scientific series that is not aggressively atheistic or dismissive of God. I was waiting for them to start trashing God and was very pleased to discover that these scientists actually respect Him and admire His creation.
I will watch it over again as I have a great love for Theology and for Science which was originally believed to be a way of understanding the magnificence of God's creation.  Now many people have been indoctrinated to see Science as being in opposition to God.
This series has been very good for me partly because of the discussions the scientists have about why we are here, what we are doing, where we are going, eternity, survival of the fittest, the wonder of how things work, ethics, scientific theories, God and Christianity.
Now it is almost impossible to find someone who has read Aristotle or any of the other scientists and philosophers discussed in this series and they are not familiar with the Bible.
Most people can discuss sports, Hollywood gossip, faux politics and other trash and trivia endlessly and yet they will never give a thought to the subjects that really broaden, define and mature a person's education, ethics, character, mind and soul.",1425600000,,1251,4.841121495327103
8404372,1,B003SHDMP2,Total apologetic BS. Waste of time. Guy is obviously frightened of death.,1417910400,,73,5.166666666666667
8404373,5,B003SHDMP2,"My review is explained in Episode 3 of this series.  Again, it is a fascinating series I encourage people to watch -- if you have an open mind.",1403136000,4,143,4.107142857142857
8404374,1,B003SHDMP2,"Completely biased toward Christianity, with repeated explanations about why the Christian God is ultimately responsible for the creation of everything. There is no discussion about religion from a historical or scientific perspective; instead religious views and beliefs are injected surreptitiously into the scientific content as though they were facts accepted by the scientific community. This is not the case, and this video is clearly designed to support the religious indoctrination of children and adults alike. This is irresponsible from a documentary film making perspective, and deplorable from a scientific perspective.

This video was originally produce in a language other than English, and has been dubbed in American English. Many of the interviews seem to have been done prior to the year 2000, and much of the content appears to have been created in the late 1990s. Production and dubbed audio quality are average to poor by todays professional standards.

I watched the first two episodes before deciding I could not take any more of the blatant promotion of creationist concepts. Im saddened to know that children all over the world are indoctrinated with material like this, depriving them of the critical thinking tools required to be a scientist. Do not confuse this video with a book of similar title: ""From Archimedes to Hawking"" by Clifford A. Pickover, which is an excellent read. The scientific and historical approach from that book was what I was hoping for here, but this video series did not deliver.",1386288000,11,1531,5.270491803278689
8404375,1,B003SHDMP2,"Poorly produced, video and dialog don't match well, dialog is boring, and not scientific. This is religious material masquerading as science and philosophy. You might like it if you are a religious ""creationist"".",1381449600,8,212,5.454545454545454
