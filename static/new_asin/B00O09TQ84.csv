The DVD will work in any DVD player because its region free. This is The Killers live Glastonbury 2007 in it's entirety. When i put this in my DVD player there's a disc menu but it's not in English so I'll translate it kind of for you Ver Pelicula =play concert Canciones=Set list Siguiente=Next Anterior = Back Subtitulos =subtitles Regresar=Back to main menu. Now yes there is subtitles and it tells you the lyrics the only way to turn this off is when you it play concert and on your DVD player remote turn it off. Here's the concert setlist: 1.
