6229389,5,B00HVFA3BS,"Even if it isn't the deepest series, it is still one of the best made. Getting the whole collection in one set AND including the few episodes done in English really make this a great buy.

6229390,5,B00HVFA3BS,"I'm a huge fan of Fist of the North Star, and am wondering if this version has the original bloody scenes. The watered down version will have a lot of light flashes that replace all the ultra violent bloody scenes. Can anyone tell me if this is the original bloody version or the watered down one? I'd also like to know if it is the English language version or Japanese with English subtitles.

6229391,4,B00HVFA3BS,"This was rather expensive, but worth it. An at least reasonably decent collection of Fist of the North Star and Fist of the North Star 2 with half-decent subs and an awkward case. Sure you can watch it online free, but some of us want to not have to rely on an internet connection to watch stuff still.

Anyway, as far as the actual review... wow. Um, this is going to be hard.

Fist of the North Star is a post apocalyptic martial arts fantasy anime, based on a manga published by Shonen Jump. It draws heavy inspiration from Mad Max and other western movies.
It is often rather dark and gritty, even despite its hope and justice centric plot. It is also incredibly violent (albeit in a partially censored form), but restrained enough in many places you can tell it's not really an adult anime. (Translated) language stays at a PG-13 level, and though there are plenty of inferences, they never outright mention or show rape. It is often just left at the sleazy cat-calling by thugs, and their tendency to pretty much show up and loom over everyone creepily anyway.
This leaves it in an odd place of being in my eyes almost appropriate for young teenagers since it kind of sticks to its theme of ""human decency or exploding head, your choice.""

Also don't bother with the dubs. They're only for thirty or so episodes, terrible, and about the worst dub I've ever heard, making Pokmon look like an AAA production in comparison. The most awkward 90's anime voice actors came out of the wood-work for it. Even Speed Racer dubbing would've been better.

They also don't have as good of special features as they say. They have bios, yes, but they're localized for the dub, and only cover the first plot arc. This means that by the time the dub runs out, so do profiles. That could've used at least a bit more work I think. They at least include a trailer for the movie, which after being used to the bluish white explosions, is damn gruesome in comparison.

That said for fans of martial arts movies or gritty wasteland stuff, this might be for you. Just watch it online just to be sure. I stuck through with the whole series and didn't regret it. And between you and me, the bad language, tropes and ultraviolence make it better. It usually comes to who's earned it at least.

Also I'm glad I'm done writing this interview. I'm used to just recommending things on their own qualities through direct example rather than description.",1419033600,28,2427,4.555045871559633

However, the Blu ray release of this series a bit lackluster compared to the DVD as the cool box art is replaced with a still image of the protagonist Kenshiro, and every one of the 3 discs share the same exact art. Be warned if the only Blu Ray player you own, like me, Is a Playstation 4 as there is a bug with the PS4 Blu-ray player  24p SD video encoded in h. 264 causing the episodes to stutter badly. But this is only on a PS4 and should be perfect on any other player. Also a small glitch on disc 1-- the 'play all' button skips the OP of the first episode. If you already own the dvd version the only pro to getting this blu ray is its smaller. Its still in standard definition. When this item releases hopefully they have fixed the issues but until then, you're better off with dvd version if you already have it. Still this collection is a nice addition if you want to save shelf space.",1507420800,7,1128,4.058295964125561

6229443,4,B00HVFA3BS,"The format all on its own is really interesting. This is NOT your usual Blu-Ray Disc. The picture quality is NOT 1080p. The audio quality is not what you expect to hear. Everything acts like a DVD, except there's like 8 DVDs in one disc, making sure you don't to stand up to change the discs a lot (I hate to sound dumb, but preserve your back! (okay, that was dumb too)). The normal anime DVD now has at least 6 episodes, if you don't count what Section23 is doing with their DVDs (4/5 episodes per disc is lazy and just raises production cost for having multiple discs, from what I understand, but thank god they're phasing away from DVDs by 2019). Two DVDs would equal the normal anime episode count of 13. These Blu-Rays have like 50-52 episodes each, making the total time for each disc 16+ hours in length. That's 4x+ the length of your normal anime Blu-Ray. The trick, like I said, everything acts like a DVD. The picture quality is 480p, and the audio quality on the audio track(s) is/are 2.0 Stereo. They are purposely put like that to put as many episodes on one disc as possible, making for a relaxing time watching an interesting format.
Because of those reasons, the WHOLE Fist of the North Star anime has been placed on 3 Blu-Ray Discs. 152 episodes in total. Eastern Star did this before with the English versions of Samurai Pizza Cats and The Wonderful Wizard of Oz anime. I'm currently having thoughts of them doing the English version of Sonic X soon, both collections put in a respective Blu-Ray Disc, and maybe Chargeman Ken. Best of all, according to the current Amazon prices as of this writing, they are actually cheaper than the DVD collection. Maybe, that's because of ""less discs = cheaper production cost"". You may feel like you're actually watching a DVD when you're watching a SD on BD, but you'll figure out the difference in terms of your money, the box, and the feeling.
As for the anime, I never did watch it yet. I know John Cena is a huge fan of this anime, but I never had the chance to really watch it through. I'll give this anime a chance once I get this set.",1505779200,5,2098,4.437823834196891

6229473,4,B00HVFA3BS,"First of all, I purchased this a month ago while it was on sale for $25. Amazing deal for the price I paid. Anyway...

Fist of the North Star is one of the most influential anime and manga series ever made, paving the way for future story-driven Shonen properties such as One Piece, Naruto, Hunter  Hunter and JoJo's Bizarre Adventure. Until the new 10s, the series was sadly under served in the US, with only 36 episodes of the TV series, a couple volumes of the manga, a spinoff OVA and TV series and the 1986 movie being released in the US. While many parts of the series have yet to make their way here, Discotek has finally given the famous TV series the treatment it deserves.

Previously released in four DVD sets, all 152 episodes of Fist are presented here across 21 discs. The image quality on these discs is pretty great, with the source footage being the excellent 25th Anniversary DVD box from Japan. Print damage and frame jitter from previous releases has been eliminated, resulting in a much healthier image. Audio features include the entire series in Japanese with English subtitles (which are much improved from the subtitles currently on Hulu and Crunchyroll) as well as the 36 initial episodes dubbed by Manga Entertainment in the mid-90s. This dub features solid acting with some standout performances, and a rather faithful script, but suffers due to new synth music tracks that fall rather flat to my ears.

The packaging is fascinating, but problematic. My sister best described it as being like ""a toolbox with discs in it"". The set features a clamshell-like ""box"" design with two page hubs. The page hubs house seven to eight discs each, three to four per side with two discs stacked on top of each other in most cases, with an extra four discs on one inner side of the case and two more on the other inner side.  For the uninitiated, DVDs do not have a protective coating like Blu-ray discs do, and are very prone to scratching. Not only does the stacking make it more difficult to retrieve certain discs, but it also leaves them more potentially open to scratching against each other, leaving abrasions that affect playback. It's not a packaging method I'm fond of, to say the least.

These discs sadly don't feature much in the way of extras. There are character biographies every few discs, as well as cel art galleries and a trailer for the 1986 movie, presented in Japanese. For a set so packed with show content, I'm a bit bummed by the lack of supplements.

For $25, I made out like a bandit. And for the usual $100 asking price, you're still getting your money's worth... for the most part. Some clumsy packaging and near-nonexistent supplementary material bring my rating down a star, but it's hard to argue when you have every episode of such an influential series in one set. Less-than-perfect rating regardless, this set is a must-have.",1471392000,4,2876,4.694444444444445

6229488,5,B00HVFA3BS,I've wanted this collection for a long time. This show is amazing. It has eng subs but also has the eng dubs for the first 36 episodes. The thing that makes this anima so great are the characters. So many great fighters that are good and evil. Even the evil guys are cool and some seem to have a good side but due to the way things are they feel they need to be the bad guy. The case houses all 21 dvds 2 discs in each slot. The slots are deep so there is enough room to fit both dvds easily (unlike some where the disc can pop out and get damaged). Every disc has animation on it of Ken or another character of the series.

Put it in your PS3, Xbox One or anything else I've tried and it's just fine.  Fantastic picture and audio quality.  Obviously not Bluray remastered quality but for the price it's hard to complain.

So weird that it screws up on PS4.  Some have suggested it's the SD on BD, but the AVGNX set was all standard definition and these jitters definitely do NOT happen on that set.

It still is SD, as the packaging does mention very clearly, but the video quality is excellent, and remember that even Japan does not have a HD release of this series yet. Sound is the original Japanese mono. I can't comment on the English track of episodes 1 - 36 since I never watched that show in that language.

IF YOU'RE EXPERIENCING PICTURE JITTERING / FRAME SKIPPING AND YOU'RE USING A PLAYSTATION 4 THIS FOLLOWING SEGMENT IS FOR YOU:

I was concerned at first because that happened to me while watching the first disc on my PS4, despite an outstanding picture quality. I then played the disc on my PS3 and there was nothing wrong. So, again, if this is happening to you, THIS IS NOT coming from the discs nor is this a manufacturing problem.
I do not know if this comes from the fact that these are SD videos on a BD and that the PS4 upscaling is to blame, or something else.
For curiosity's sake I put in another blu-ray in the PS4 (thinking it could be my system at fault) and it played just fine, and then played a DVD with the same upscale settings and it worked perfectly too. Thought maybe others were experiencing this and might come here to look for some answers, so hope this helps.

I will update soon on that matter after tweaking the upscale or turning it off on PS4, since I realize not everyone might have two systems that play blu-rays.

Thank you Discotek for this release.",1509753600,23,1425,4.366037735849057
