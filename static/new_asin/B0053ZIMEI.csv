Lovely cast, great summer movie if you can't get there for real. Fun in the sun and water. Good food and drink. I love this film and yet can't seem to say more about it than I have.

4553160,5,B0053ZIMEI,"Guillaume Canet creates films (Tell No One, Whatever You Say, J'peux pas dormir..., Je taim) that though they are about love, loss and life, they probe more deeply into the human condition than the glossy entertaining surface can conceal.  In the end all of his films demand that the viewer connects to his concept of the flow of life and death and those aspects of living that make a difference. Les petits mouchoirs AKA Little White Lies magnifies these attributes. The story is so conversationally written that for a while it is difficult to pull together where the film is going, but by the end of the film the audience is so choked by the discoveries revealed that tears and a stunned afterburn are inevitable.

Every year, Max Cantara (Franois Cluzet), a successful restaurant owner, and Vronique (Valrie Bonneton), his eco-friendly wife invite a their close-knit circle of friends to their beautiful Cap Ferrat beach house near Bordeaux to celebrate the birthday of Antoine (Laurent Lafitte) and kick-start the vacation. But, this year, before they all leave Paris, their mutual friend Ludo (Jean Dujardin) is hurt in a serious motocycle accident, ends up the ICU and as the doctors say nothing can be done to change things for at least two weeks,  the friends all proceed with their plans for vacation: no one stays behind to be supportive of Ludo, not even his apparent love partner Marie (Marion Cotillard). This sets off a dramatic chain of reactions and emotional responses. The eagerly anticipated vacation leads each of the protagonists to raise the little veils that for years they have draped over what bothers and upsets them. Pretenses become increasingly hard to keep up. Until the moment when the truth finally catches up with them all: each member of the group of friends has a problem that needs the support of real friends but none of them has the ability to share personal secrets. There are many concepts that are present here - one married man Vincent (Benot Magimel) has an inexplicable physical and emotional attraction to Max who loathes the idea of a possible gay liaison; Marie is visited by an infrequent lover Nassim (Hocine Mrabet), Eric (Gilles Lellouche) longs to be reunited with the woman who has found another, Jean Louis (Jol Dupuch) awaits messages from his emotionally distant Juliette (Anne Marivin) - and so on.  Yet each of these little situations confound Antoine who cannot believe this group would not stay near their critically injured friend Ludo. The consequences are revealing and point out the importance of owning up to the truths that define a life. To reveal the ending would be a disservice to all who may see this little masterpiece.

The entire cast is of the highest caliber and Canet succeeds in getting brilliant performances from each. Though each actor is excellent, the performances by Benot Magimel, Marion Cotillard and Franois Cluzet are exceptional. This is a thinking person's film but one that holds as much brilliant drama and impact as any film before us today.  Grady Harp, February 13",1360972800,9,3059,4.941634241245136
4553161,5,B0053ZIMEI,"What a great film! And the Blu ray has geat picture and sound (...you need the sound very loud because the music is just fantastic). Unfortunately the subtitles cannot transfer the real powerful and emotional message of certain dialogues. So, if you speak French you are in for a treat...I am not sure who came up with the English ""translation"" of the title ""Little white lies"", but it doesn't make any sense and it doesn't stand for anything. Total nonsense.

The film is about a close group of friends that are spending ten days together during summer vacation at a nice beach house close to Bordeaux which is about 600km from Paris. Max and his wife own the place. They have a boat and obviously a lot of money and they have invited all their close friends. One of them couldn't make it because he was in a nearly fatal bike accident. During this time all dirty secrets are coming out. The real title of the movie is ""Les petits mouchoirs"" which literarily means the ""The Small Handkerchief"". The title illustrates the fact that we always cover the small defects, a small stain on a table cloth, or a piece of dirt, with a small tissue. It is on the surface ready to show up. Same thing with our weaknesses or personal problems. There are not buried deep inside and are ready to show up any time. This is what the movie is about. About the small problems everybody has hidden inside and ready to come out. It always feels better afterwards. You feel free once you told everybody everything!!!

It is a great movie and like most great French movies, the characters are well developed. That is the reason that the movie is long (154 min). But it is worth your time and money. Especially if you speak French. In addition, the soundtrack is just fabulous. This is what I call the ""old timers"" music. All the good stuff from the 60's and 70's are there. This is my next purchase.

Five stars all around for the acting, the script (apparently was written in a week), the soundtrack, and the direction. To optimize the acting, all participants spent three months in the house before the start of the movie. Great move, everything is perfect, they really look and sound like the spent a lifetime together.",1360454400,7,2200,4.55050505050505
4553162,3,B0053ZIMEI,"In 1976, a Swiss ensemble piece called ""Jonah Who Will Be 25 in the Year 2000"" unwittingly kick-started a Boomer-centric ""midlife crisis"" movie subgenre that I call The Group Therapy Weekend (similar to, but not to be conflated with, the venerable Dinner Party Gone Awry). The story usually centers on a coterie of long-time friends (some married with kids, others perennially single) who converge for a (reunion, wedding, funeral) at someone's (beach house, villa, country spread) to catch up, reminisce, wine and dine, revel...and of course, re-open old wounds (always the most entertaining part). It's usually accompanied by a nostalgic soundtrack spotlighting all your favorite hits from the (60s, 70s or 80s). Like any film genre, the entries range from memorable (""The Return of the Secaucus 7"", ""The Big Chill"") to the downright execrable (last year's ""I Melt With You""). The latest, Guillaume Canet's ""Little White Lies"" (released in France as ""Les petits mouchoirs"" in 2010) falls somewhere in the middle.

Which is a shame, because writer-director Canet has assembled a fabulous cast; the problem is that somewhere around the 90-minute mark of this epic-length (2  hour) comedy-drama, he seems to run out of new and/or interesting things for his actors to do or say. The film begins intriguingly enough; a happy-go-lucky fellow named Ludo (Jean Dujardin, bearing an uncanny resemblance here to the young James Caan) hops on his motorcycle after a night of doing blow at an after-hours Parisian club, and promptly gets T-boned at an intersection by a truck when he runs a red light. As his friends gather at the ICU, we are introduced to our principal players: Max (Francois Cluzet, star of the director's terrific 2006 mystery-thriller, Tell No One) and his wife Veronique (Valerie Bonneton), Antoine (Laurent Lafitte), Marie (Marion Cotillard), Vincent (Benoit Magimel) and his wife Isabelle (Pascale Arbillot) and Eric (Gilles Lellouche). This unfortunate event has occurred on the eve of an annual vacation getaway for the gang, hosted by well-to-do restaurateur Max and Veronique at their beach house, which is a 3-hour drive from Paris. After a powwow, they decide that while it's a bummer that Ludo can't join them this time out, they should nonetheless plow ahead (all feeling a bit guilty).

As events unfold at the beach (and in keeping with the rules of the genre) each player shows their colors as an archetype (the free-spirit with commitment issues, the aging Lothario, the recently dumped single carrying the torch, the harried husband, the sexually frustrated wife, the substance abuser, the sexually conflicted character, etc). However, despite a script overstuffed with clichs and stereotypes, the talented and well-directed ensemble shines with genuine chemistry and warm, authentic performances. Where the director drops the ball is in the relatively tepid third act, deflating most of the dramatic tension with one too many self-pity parties and a subplot that has two characters running around in a sputtering state of gay panic. Still, there are enough compelling reasons to recommend the film; besides the appealing cast, DP Christophe Offenstein nicely captures the sun-dappled beauty of Gironde's Atlantic coast, and there's a well-selected soundtrack ranging from contemporary (The Jets, Damien Rice, Ben Harper) to nostalgic (David Bowie, Janis Joplin, CCR). Singer-songwriter Maxim Nucci (in a small role as Cotillard's latest boy toy) performs a poignant original called ""Talk to Me"". While Canet may not necessarily have anything new to say, he at least talks to us like we're grownups.",1360022400,3,3626,5.313588850174216

Being French, the characters are obsessed with l'amour, and spend what seems like two months (it's actually two weeks) navel gazing and breast beating over various aspects of their love lives, and fighting with each other.

It's billed as a comedy-drama, but I didn't do any laughing.

4553186,4,B0053ZIMEI,"This film was a little too long, and took a long time to get to the Heart Of The Matter, but I enjoyed every minute. This is a French film with subtitles and I almost prefer subtitles now. This is an adult film about adults who are still trying to find themselves. And, for the most part they do a lot of the finding in one summer's vacation.

We meet Ludo as he is snorting cocaine and meeting and greeting his friends at a party. He leaves on his motorcycle and has the most devastating and surreal crash into a truck. It really is horrific. Amazingly he survives, and we meet his close friends who come to his bedside.
Max the rich restaurateur who has the house they all go to in the sumner.
Marie, Ludo's girlfriend of the present, played by Marion Cotillard
Vincent, a married father of a little boy
Jean-Louis the most confused of all.

All of these people were to leave the next day for their holiday. They examine the pros and cons. Ludo is going to take a long time to recover, so they decide to go away for two weeks instead of the usual month. This is where all the soul searching occurs and the crux of their lives may be decided. They each have their own stories, and one by one it is told.

A film reminiscent of other films we have seen, but this is quite well done in a new locale with different stories. The acting is superb, and you may recognize these actors in other films you have seen.

4553205,4,B0053ZIMEI,"Preliminarily, it's very apt to liken this film to the 1980s ""The Big Chill"" in terms of general genre. However, the characters in ""Little White Lies"" (LWL) came across to me as less likable and harder to empathize with, probably by design, with a notable amount of pretentiousness and unnecessary small-talk. Here, LWL characterizations took a longer time to develop, making the viewing experience seem longer and more laborious; however near the movie's end the viewer better understands the different characters as the characters themselves finally take a harder look at themselves.  I would give the film five stars if rating were based on intent and content and message, but I drop it down a notch because of more technical issues such as length and unnecessarily slow character development. Various scenes were very intelligently written and extremely well acted, but I thought that the film could have done more to show the shortcomings of the characters without waiting for a single character to do so, in a didactic lecture, near the very end. As my high school English teacher commanded, ""Show us; don't tell us.""",1486166400,,1123,5.07027027027027
4553206,5,B0053ZIMEI,"IT IS DONE WELL AND DELIVERED SLOWLY AND METHODICALLY.  There is a big point to all of that some people are saying
and trying to realize and take in the scope of the ""white lies""...polite lies, that generally feel better to people everywhere so much more
than the raw, clear,  harsh, truth.  I make my reviews based  on ""the product"" that the movie is in general and then I consider the details.
AND THIS MOVIE has lots of details.  That two-hour time span allows the characters to be delivered clearly so that the audience can get
to know them as people, just people: people who will tell ""white lies"" to be polite and unoffensive.
***LET ME STOP FOR A MOMENT OF TRUTH....to be honest I don't know when and where they told white lies.
I said to myself: ""Watch it again and see if you see the point that is hidden in the title.""
THEN I DECIDED...""No.  I will likely always remember the essence of this movie because the characters didn't exactly
tell a ""story"" and there didn't seem to be ANY REAL POINT.  It seemed to me that the audience was viewing a video
of real people in their lives.  We caught them on video; stepped into their realness, their polite realness, like we all are real
and we got a chance to see what they're doing in their lives.  It was well-delivered as real people in life telling ""white lies"", which
is commonly known as ""polite lies"" to get-on with each other rather than fighting.  The kind of politeness and grace that the
Christians say delivers a 'grace'...that old, good and glorious Amazing Grace that contradicts ""wretchedness"" ...and saves all souls
from hells.
All of that grace stuff...allows our kind of specie to exist on a same plane together.

(There was a lot of drinking.)  Is that French.? It did feel like we were in France with French people.

SPEAKING OF REAL, REAL, REALNESS...When it comes to seeing after a ""friend"" at the hospital, or a mother, father, aunt, cousin, oh yeah:
and brother or sister, there is only one way to do it gracefully and fully.  Do your own personal thing; don't get all involved in what the group will do
or don't do.  Just do your thing and the rest who want to do something will follow your example.  Don't expect organization.  And don't expect people
who do nothing, zero, zilch: to NOT criticize your giving 100% of yourself.  That's also one of the EVENTS in our lives that we try to do politely.
People talk a lot about this EVENT in all our lives and don't deliver.  They do go on vacations.

You do have to be in the mood to look at a movie like this.  You have to be feeling like you want to see normal people living normally through
polite expressions that do feel like polite lies: falsehoods of politeness.  I might see it again but it will be a while.
It is near Christmastime.  In my world, we will be doing a lot of ''White Lies'' ourselves during this season: We will try to keep the ''realness''
at bay for a few days to have a wonderful Christmas Season.

4553262,5,B0053ZIMEI,"Les petits mouchoirs (Little White Lies) in an accurate and unfortunately sad representation of the life of friends who, despite one of theirs being in critical care following a motorcycle accident, go on with their vacation, abandoning said friend in Paris. Characters are well depicted and the cast of actors impressive. The film is somehow reminiscent of an American classic, The Big Chill. Even though one man is in the hospital fighting for his life, each character continues on with every day life and its insignificance. Characters impersonate archetypes: the rich guy, full of himself and always stressed and rude, the unhappy womanizer, the ambiguous bisexual good looking seductress, etc... surrounded by children who see their parents drink, smoke, have fun, argue, and so on. The decor is nice: the Atlantic coast of France, near the famous dune of Pila. Only one person is genuine: Jean-Louis, the local fisherman, who at the end of the film will break the bad news to the bunch, and make them realize how selfish their behavior is.",1392508800,8,1045,5.046242774566474

4553265,4,B0053ZIMEI,"As stories go it isn't the most gripping plot but features some of my favorite French actors.

4553268,4,B0053ZIMEI,"I'm a sucker for all things French and I live in the desert and dearly miss the ocean.  So I sat through the first part of this film even though I found it slow and boring and the characters terribly petty. I was also jealous of their wonderful vacation at the beautiful home at the beach in SW France.  There's lots of footage of pretty people cavorting on boats and in the water and of course having wonderful outdoor meals with lots of wine. After about an hour of this I shut it off.  The next night I returned to see if anything interesting might happen.  And it did. Slowly we saw through the cracks of the surface personalities and that's when it became involving.  By the end I felt like I was almost one of the group and I liked them all a lot.

The film is long and I think it could have been cut.  I did have a hard time with the American pop music which apparently sounds different to French ears than to mine.  ""Hang on Sloopy"" appeared at what seemed like an absurd moment and ""My Way"" at the funeral?!

As others have noted this is in the tradition of"" The Big Chill"" and other ensemble pieces where a group of old friends gets together and interesting stuff happens.  I agree with the reviewer who said this isn't the best of this genre but it isn't the worst either.  And as most everyone agreed, the cast is superb and makes sitting through the boring parts tolerable.  Marion Cotillard is particularly wonderful.

It's a good summer film if you can't go to the beach youself. A bottle of Bordeaux will help.",1375488000,2,1526,4.312280701754386
4553269,3,B0053ZIMEI,"Guillaume Canet is an excellent actor, writer and director (BTW: is Patrick Dempsey his brother?? or twin!) While the direction here is solid, Canet's story is hackneyed. I enjoy the more commercial French movies as well as the, shall we say cinematic and intellectual French films. So, I gave this one a try. This is clearly an ensemble piece with previous Canet collaborators (Cluzet, Cotillard, DeJardin, et al) all veterans, and each delivers a good performance. Yet, the story is predictable and the premise, somewhat of a stretch--would you really go on vacation leaving a dear, close friend on the verge of death, on his own with no one, NO ONE to care for him? C'mon, man! Not even an enemy would do that and these folks claimed to be ""friends."" While we all question from time to time the trustworthiness of even our closest friends, these folks take it to a whole other nadir. Beyond this premise, there are few surprises or new twists, both in terms of the story and the lessons learned. Moreover, the way in which those lessons are illustrated on the screen don't offer much that is unique or even different. Francois Cluzet is kinda lovable as the irascible and difficult kingpin of the group. The character ""Jean-Louis"" is just too self-righteous and preachy in the end, to even take seriously. Yet, there are fine performances. But again the content, i.e., story has been told many times in movies like Big Chill, et al, and they actually do it better. Four Weddings and Funeral is another in this genre that hits all the right notes. Also, take a look at Loose Cannons. This Italian ensemble piece about a family's dysfunction and coming to terms with individuals in the family is marvelously acted and tells a great story of being yourself and making whatever sacrifice is necessary to do so, even in the face of family and social pressures to be something else. RENT IT! ""Loose Cannon.""",1375401600,5,1904,4.755287009063444

8456013,3,B0053ZIMEI,"A group of self-absorbed friends get together for their annual group vacation at a beach resort.  But this one is different because one of their members lies badly injured in the hospital.  Of course, they convince themselves that they will abandon him to his hospital room, to cavort as usual, although they profess to love him dearly.  We witness all sorts of romantic entanglements, some more awkward than others, and the whole thing is clouded by a professed love of one for another, despite their both being married.  The film is fun as a group vacation can be, but the self-absorption does get a bit tiresome.  The end scene is not the best written either.  Overall, enjoyable, but not profound.  and VERY french.",1519430400,,719,4.796747967479675
