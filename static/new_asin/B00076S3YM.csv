8045093,4,B00076S3YM,"THE PHANTOM SHIP is the speculative movie take on the true mystery of the Mary Celeste, found adrift in 1872, w/ no survivors aboard. The highlight of the film is Anton (Bela Lugosi), a religious fanatic and murdering monster! His captive prey have no idea what hits them. Lugosi plays his disturbing role w/ menace and mania, making for a very enjoyable film. This movie definitely deserves to be far more widely known...",1416096000,,422,4.794520547945205
8045094,5,B00076S3YM,I had never heard of this movie before. Good watching for a rainy day i thought.  It's a movie you can watch again and cheap enough to lend out to friends and family.  Not one that upsets you for buying it and using it as a freesbee ! Some movies are not good enough to even lend out.,1322438400,,284,3.8793103448275863
8045095,3,B00076S3YM,"In spite of the product description stating this is the full 80 minute version, this - like all the other releases - is the 61 minute edit.

Picture and sound are ""public domain"" quality - which is OK by me.

This was Hammer's first foray into the macabre, so I had to collect it.  Just a bit disappointed that it wasn't the full version.",1202515200,4,338,4.25
