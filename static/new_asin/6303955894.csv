7856918,5,6303955894,This little reunion is a must see for Real World fanatics especially fans of seasons 1-4. Allison Stewart MTV VJ takes us on a ride through the first four seasons bringing  back all the castmembers for a reunion. The usual drama ensues between Puck & Judd when SF season comes out. It goes into a little piece on Pedro and his memorial service. But it has backstage drama as well. First off all the seasons go to dinner to discuss their season but the tables are mixed with different casts. The part I like best is the peek at audition tapes from most of the castmembers including Puck. I always like to see the audition tapes to see how they got on the show what stood out in their tape. Some of the tapes are hilarious. For me the first four seasons are the Real World the concept was still there. These new seasons are so camped up and exaggerated. I was a senior in high school when SF season aired so I lived thru the first four. I own it and recommend viewing take a nostalgic trip back to when The Real World was still experimental.,1084147200,3,1039,4.274111675126903

It's unfortunate, however, that Domininque and Aaron chose not to reunite with their LA housemates.  Nevertheless, I found this special very entertaining.  Enjoy!",1044576000,,332,5.73469387755102

The best part of the video is  when puck, being the troublemaker that he is, stirs some emotion in his  fellow castmates and the casts from the other seasons. The only thing that  I recommend is is that MTV puts together another reunion special for the  past few seasons.",949449600,3,538,4.393939393939394
