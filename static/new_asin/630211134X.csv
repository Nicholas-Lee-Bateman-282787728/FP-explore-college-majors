7821264,4,630211134X,Why hasn't this great movie been released on DVD?  It is a great document of the 70s Detroit wrestling scene.  I use to go to the matches as a kid,1196899200,,146,3.8333333333333335
7821265,5,630211134X,"I am glad I found this on amazon and that people had already wrote responses. Obivously these comments were written by true wrestling fans. If wrestling made movies this no doubt would be a B movie classic like Plan 9 From Out Of Space. The music is classic you have to actually listen to the lyrics of the title track I Like To Hurt People its great.

They have a wide variety of old school superstars. Andre, The Shiek and The Grand Wizard his manager, Bobo Brazil and so many more. Then there were guys I never heard of. What ever happened to the Captain ?

There are nothing but complements from me in regards to this movie so if you haven't seen it you are really missing out. If you have seen it you know what I mean. Find that friend who has never seen this movie and make them watch it.

They will love it",1132963200,3,813,4.165605095541402
