2126032,1,B0002VEZ3U,"This film is a perfect example of a brilliant idea with some poor follow-through.  When I watched the preview to this film, I was handed the impression that this would be a documentary of sorts filled with potent information and life-changing ideas.  I will be the first to say that the marketing of this film misled me.  What I actually found when I started this film was instead a movie, filled with shallow characters, horrible acting, and cliched moments.  The only redeemable value of this film was the brief interruptions throughout the film that stop the motion to give us a moment of trivia about the lines from some of the characters.  Outside of that, this film imploded into itself.  I say this because by the end of the film, I felt that nothing was resolved and the end of the film changed nothing about California.  Did anyone else feel that this was still a very hypocritical and racist film?  I felt that the purpose of this film directed by Sergio Arau was to bring the Mexican population into a new and blinding light.  What I witnessed in A Day Without a Mexican was that all the personal cliches that we assume about them are true, and that without them our economy in this country will fail (especially in California).  It did not give a personal touch to the subject, it just reinforced the fact that they are our workers, not our friends or neighbors.

Director Arau had the platform to make an amazing social satire, but ultimately fell short.  Why?  Let me explain some of the downfalls of this film.  The first is the acting.  ""C"" grade actors reenacting the events of the day that all the Mexicans disappeared is not a good start.  There was not one actor or actress in this film that I could say was great to watch.  These actors decreased the value and the overall effect of this film.  Several times I was so caught up with how bad these actors were delivering their lines that I didn't care about any of the statements that Arau was making.  I could have cared less, just get these actors off my screen.  The two that stand out in my eyes as the worst were Caroline Aaron playing Aunt Gigi and John Getz (of my favorite film Blood Simple.) as the racist Senator who finds his heart of gold.  Both of these performances were laughable.  Everything they said and did drew attention away from the actual points of the film, thus decreasing the effects.

Second, it was the production. I kept waiting for two things to occur during this film.  One, I felt as if at any time the set was just going to fall apart.  The overall cheese factor of the production limited my excitement for this film.  It reminded me of a child's drawing that you laminate.  It may have that glossy look, but what's inside is just scribbles.  Second, and I am serious here, I kept thinking that this was going to turn into a soft-core porn.  It had the acting, the production, and even the sounds of a soft-core porn ... so where was it?  I think this accurately describes the feeling you have as you watch this movie.  It is not pretty in any way.

Third, let's talk about the music.  I wouldn't have minded some influential Mexican music being played throughout the film to set the scene and to place the emotion, but instead what I found were horrible covers of American music about California.  It was pathetic.  The tone of this film was ruined.  A Day Without A Mexican was ruined from the beginning, but by this point (when the first song blazed through my stereo) it was forgotten.

Fourth, I mentioned before about how this film fails to successfully bring sympathy and knowledge about the Mexican population in California because it never addresses the cliches and stereotypes.  This was a major flaw in this film.  I wanted to feel as if they were just like you or me, just wronged by America.  This never happened.  From the opening scene when one of the actors says that her husband never goes anywhere without his teeth (and it was not addressed, but used as humor) I felt offended.  Arau built threw in stereotypes as a form of humor that destroyed his film.  Another one was the entire bit about the MeXican Files (parody of the X-Files) and the reference between UFOs and aliens towards the sombrero of a Mexican and America calling them ""illegal aliens"" was prejudice in my eyes.  It was an unfunny joke that continued to drop this film down several notches in my eyes.  Couple this with all the references to Jose on the back of the milk carton as missing was just despicable.  If an uneducated person watched this film, they would have seen it as a comedy instead of a social commentary on California.  Those that argue that the trivia was helpful, it was not.  It seemed random and thrown in at the last minute just to counter arguments that the film was becoming too much of a comedy.

Finally, the insanity of the ending is hardly worth mentioning.

Was this a cheesy sci-fi film, or an honest attempt to show the world the power of the Mexican population?  Who knows?  I don't think one could tell by just watching this film.  Arau did a horrible job in creating this film.  While I could see where he wanted to go with this picture, he never quite left the driveway.  Instead he blew out his tires and ran into the main support of the house.  Overall, it was pathetic.  This was a horrible film that was marketed to bring in those hoping to see a well-crafted documentary.  I felt cheated and lost by the end of this film.  I do not suggest that anyone watches the movie or gives their money to this director.  It was a waste of time.  This is your Public Service Announcement.

2126033,2,B0002VEZ3U,"Interesting idea, but the movies was too slow.

I really wanted to find out what the outcome was, so I just fast-fowarded to the end.",1097193600,2,133,4.32
2126034,3,B0002VEZ3U,"This film is vvvveeerrrryyyyy West Coasty! It only speaks about Cali. Characters make statements like ""All Latinos are Mexican anyway!"" You would never hear someone say that on the East Coast. I saw a film about the abuse of illegal immigrants in the San Diego area a few months ago. This movie uses comedy to address issues whereas that movie used tragedy.

This movie actually reminded me a lot of ""Bamboozled."" It doesn't take long to understand satire. Maybe that's why it does well on quick things like sketch comedy and not in feature-length films. I was the only non-Mexican American in the audience and some theatergoers left midway and I heard one woman say, ""That was the dumbest movie ever!"" It was okay for what it was trying to do.

Like many satirical works, the references weren't always subtle. The racist governor is named Abercrombie, obviously in reference to the lawsuits against store. Someone says, ""The number two guy in California is Mexican and he vanished too."" Can we say Bustamante?  The one woman who doesn't disappear is labeled ""the missing link."" She is kind of a sellout/una vendida, so it's a swipe at Latinos that try to front. If this weren't a minority-made film, I'm sure folk would be upset about referring to any person of color as the missing link, and rightly so.

Class-privileged people may be rubbed the wrong way by this film. It implies that California would suffer without Mexicans because no one would be there to clean houses and pick fruit. There was no mention of Latino professors at Berkeley or Congresspersons Sanchez and Becerra and stuff.

This film also implies that if there were no Mexicans, then white, blonde women would lack their Latin lovers. The film starts and practically ends with a Latino male-white female married couple. You never see any white male-Latina couples even though they exist a plenty in California and around the nation.  Not only is this portrayal cool with a stereotype, but it also kinda puts white blondes on a pedestal. This part of the film is somewhat of backhanded slap posing as a compliment.  I think many should be rightfully outraged by this two-way fetishization.

This film also portrays whites and blacks as being against Latinos and Asians. I felt bad about this as a black man that supports black-brown unity. However, blacks did play a significant role in Villaraigosa not getting elected as L.A.'s mayor, so maybe it's real. I have seen blacks and Latinos have more in common than Latinos and Asians.  It's hard for me to think that the main dividing line in the US is immigrant versus non-immigrant, even in Cali.

There is a metaphor of a dripping faucet and an overflowing glass of water.  Perhaps it relates to the push-pull factors that explain multinational immigration.  However, it was somewhat lost on its symbolism and I doubt most others would get it either.

But yes, I do recommend that people of any ethnicity see it.  Independent films don't stay in theaters long, so if this is playing in your city, go see it. Whether I liked the flick or not, I want to support filmmakers of color and this sounded curious.",1096156800,24,3128,4.789962825278811
2126035,4,B0002VEZ3U,"I loved the important message being drilled in here by talented filmmakers and couple Sergio Arau and Yareli Arizmendi (who also plays lead newscaster Lila Rodriguez).  People complain pejoratively about ""Mexicans,"" but it is true that California (and other states) would suffer greatly if this important workforce disappeared overnight.  The movie plays out such a scenario in a playful, biting, and phantasmagoric fashion.  This is a fleshing out of a 28-minute short originally released by the filmmakers in 1998.

I feel the success of this movie was a bit undermined by its odd marketing campaigning, which featured the ""Senator"" and ""Senator's Wife"" characters.  It was one of the better threads in the film, but this is the radiant Ms. Arizmendi's film all the way.  A campaign that featured her would have given potential filmgoers a far better feel for what to expect once inside the theater.  Nothing against actors John Getz and Melinda Allen, who are superb, but a poster of them holding gardening tools - while getting the message across like a 2x4 between the eyeballs - does nothing to get to the essence of the movie (which comes when Arizmendi's character finds out her true roots and what in means to be a Latino).",1095897600,9,1232,4.951456310679611

Did the Mexicans really disappear-- or is it that while there--no one sees them?  Or have they really left!! Thought provoking film, yet a spoof on USA/California vision of reality!

And of course the California dream collapses rather like a house of cards chopped off at the bottom.

And every person born in Latin America and living in California disappears.  It is the ""disappearance epidemic.""  The news states ""California feels like a ghost town.""

Results?  One third of Californians are of Central or South American descent.  Ninety percent of the produce in California is harvested by these recent immigrants.  Twenty percent of school teachers.  One-third of all consumers.  Sixty percent of construction workers are Latino.

Is it the Rapture?

In the meantime, food in the grocery stores is not being restocked.  The piles of garbage slowly build up.  ""Come back, amigos!""  There is confusion about who is disappearing: ""Guatemalans and Hondurans are not Mexicans.""

In a jab at modern news programs, Latina reporter Lila doesn't disappear, but is in a car accident and in the hospital.  The news station sets up a 24 hour ""Lila-cam"" in her room for the ogling public.  In the meantime, some businesses advertise a ""disappearance sale,"" and comedians wish their mother-in-laws could have been Mexican.  And the two-faced acting governor finally announces, ""if you see our Mexican brothers and sisters, tell them that we need them.""

A Day Without A Mexican is a ""dramatization"" of this disappearance.  The viewer gets the perspectives of the conspiracy theorists, broken families, the Border Patrol, restauranteurs, farmers, politicians, and others.  Of course, the racists are as pleased as punch: ""Celebrate the Disappearance!  It's our country!""

2126290,4,B0002VEZ3U,"Trying to conceive of a ""Left Behind"" style film happening to a specific race in a specific State is pretty out there. But director Sergio Arau does so admirably in A DAY WITHOUT A MEXICAN.

Part comedy, part mockumentary, the film's liberal leanings are sure to turn some viewers off. Taking consistent jabs at prejudices (and hitting their target more often than not), the film takes on the premise that a strange, magical fog has surrounded California one fateful day, blocking all incoming and outgoing traffic, internet access, and all forms of communication. And this weird atmospheric disturbance has also taken away all of the Mexicans. The disruption to the Sunshine State is evident as fruit rots on trees, vegetable aisles in grocery stores go empty, and car wash patrons have to dry their own cars!

Lilia Rod(riguez) played by Yareli Arizmendi (LIKE WATER FOR CHOCOLATE) is a televison news reporter who DOESN'T disappear. The supernatural phenomenon seems to have passed her by even though she's Mexican. Or is she? More unseen prejudices arise as we learn that most Anglos label anyone with a coppery-toned complexion as ""Mexican."" Lilia learns her true genetic heritage along the way but feels, in her heart, that she's Mexican and promptly vanishes in front of a televison audience.

John Getz (BLOOD SIMPLE) plays Senator Abercrombie who has to take on the position of California Governor Pro-Tem, as the current Governor and Lieutenant Governor were Mexican. Thrown into the spotlight, the new Gov has to deal with all of the chaos caused by the disappearances as well as the disruptions to his own household when their maid/nanny/cook vanishes.

Other characters include two border patrol officers who are forced to deal with their prejudices when they learn that they no longer have a viable job. This is one particularly hilarious portion of the film that will really tickle audience's funny bones.

As California tries to deal with the loss of an entire race, the remaining folks come up with some great reasons for the Mexicans' disappearance. Some say that the sombrero is shaped like a UFO for a reason <wink!> Others believe it's a form of the rapture, and the apocalypse is upon us. Still others believe that it is because the other races didn't appreciate the Mexicans and so they just up and left. Regardless of the reason (true or not) the effect is felt throughout the State. Anglos and other nationalities turn to looting and diving into black-market fruits and vegies in order to save their restaurants. Talk shows swing from one extreme to the other, some saying their glad that the Mexicans are gone while others struggle to stay on the air with a skeleton crew (many camera operators were Mexicans).

The film's faults are that this probably won't be for those who live outside California. A Day Without a Mexican has a fairly specific target audience. But the great message, often funny and poignant at the same time, cannot be denied: we all need each other, regardless of race.

Special mention of the film's musical soundtrack MUST be made, too. The mariachi version of California Dreamin' is outstanding, as is the theme song A Day Without A Mexican.",1160784000,10,3192,4.9440298507462686

2126303,3,B0002VEZ3U,"This film is a satiric attempt at letting the viewer know the impact that Hispanics have had in this country, specifically in California. It is a well-intentioned film, but, unfortunately, it misses the mark, as it tries too hard to be too many things. It is unclear whether it wishes to be a satiric mockumentary or a straightforward film. Moreover, it is often confusing, plagued by unclear metaphors, as well as the use of the word ""Mexican"" as a euphemism for all Hispanics.

In the film, all Hispanics disappear from California, upon the arrival of a strange, pinkish fog that surrounds that state, cutting off its communication with the outside world. Before long, thirteen million of them have disappeared, leaving California in dire straits, a virtual ghost town. Politicians, professors, newscasters, domestics, musicians, day laborers, landscapers, and restaurant workers are some that are among the missing. Virtually no profession is left unscathed, as millions of Hispanics simply disappear from the face of the earth.

The premise of the film is viewed through a series of vignettes that focus on certain families who have been personally affected by the disappearance of the Hispanic population. Although some of its points are of interest and portions of the film are funny, as well as informative, the message of the film is lost on the viewer, as it is done in by bad acting, poor editing, inept writing, too many subplots, and scatter shot direction. Overall, the film retains a surprisingly amateurish quality.

2126304,5,B0002VEZ3U,"I've heard people complain that they were expecting more from this film.  First of all, I'm wondering what it's missing.  Conceptually, this film is genius; the title in and of itself perfectly portrays the brilliance of the film's discourse: what if all the 'illegal immigrants' simply disappeared?  The economic, not to mention social, effect on our country would be devastating.  The film does a great job of illustrating and extrapolating upon this idea while maintaining a satirical, humorous worldview of capitalism; that is, the film is incredibly self-aware.  In fact, I might venture to say that most of the complaints alleged at the substance of this film hinge on a misunderstanding of the concept.  If 'A Day Without A Mexican' were to take itself too seriously, it would undermine the critical and discursive effect that it might actually have on a capitalist superstructure.  By playing it 'tongue-and-cheek' (alongside admirable performances) ADWAM is capable of illustrating the seriousness of the situation in manner that spurs activism and provides hope for a solution.  If anything, it's one of the most topical films in stores right now and, given the protests in Los Angeles a month ago, is a must-see.  Form your opinions then.  You might just learn a thing or two.

Okay, so it IS hokey and amaturish; but it is also entertaining and while not preachy or ""heavy,"" it does get it's point accross.  It challenges us to think about our prejudices, even the ones we think we don't have.  When we generalize populations and fall victim to political rehtoric we dehumanize the ""other.""  This film uses a subplot of vignettes to show us the importance and the humanity of our fully ""American"" latino brothers and sisters, and reminds us that the uniqueness of American Nationality is precisely that we are ALL immigrants in one sense or another.  I was disappointed in the poor reviews many others gave this film.  I think the amateur quality was endearing and effective in making it a sort of ""believable"" documentary.  I am eager to share this film with my 8, 11 and 13 year old children and their friends, to help them understand a little more about recent immigrant struggles.  The people who gave the worst reviews and redirected shoppers to buy different, ""better"" films (also very good) would do well to remember that not all films need to be literal, heavy, fully accurate, social works of art.

2126306,3,B0002VEZ3U,"""A Day Without a Mexican"" is a very poorly made motion picture.  This is most unfortunate considering the large illegal immigrant protests we are currently seeing throughout the country.  A well done comedy regarding our economy enduring the absence of illegal workers for a 24 hour period would be most welcome.  The story revolves around a weird phenomenon where all people of Mexican ancestry disappear in the state of California.  There are a few chuckles as the situation worsens---but soon one is likely to wonder when the film will be over.  The seemingly ultraliberal creators of ""A Day Without a Mexican"" do not possess a light satirical touch.  This talent is mandatory when dealing with issues which are troubling and often lack easy answers.  Placing the blame solely on bigoted white folks is childishly simplistic.  Sadly, this particular movie barely rates two stars.  If you really push me, I might give it three.  OK, I will.  Three it is.

I'm tired of hearing about the plight of the Mexicans. There are millions of American CITIZENS who live paycheck to paycheck, can't find employment, don't have health care, get on their knees to scrub toilets, etc. Instead, the mexicans, who come here ILLEGALLY think that we have to just hand them citizenship for no good reason because they can get here easily by jumping over a fence.

The movie portrays all white american citizens as rich, useless, don't know how to cook, clean or do their own laundry. Personally in my life time I have never had any friends or family who had a maid. This movie is just lame, don't waste your time..no matter what side of the immigration issue you are on, this movie is lame.",1146528000,7,850,4.775510204081633
2126308,4,B0002VEZ3U,"I laughed out loud several times while I watched this movie by myself; sometimes I laughed the harsh laugh of recognition; sometimes it was more broad and slapstick than that. I didn't mind the wandering narrative as some reviewers did; it felt consistent with the gradual realization of the folks ""left behind"" that not only were people missing - they were missed. I enjoyed the little mysteries: why was the son of the white mother and Latino father missing, but not the daughter? Why was the Latina reporter still around? Why did she subsequently disappear?

the only thing that I found truly unsatisfactory was that we never found out where all the Latinos/Hispanics (the subtitles make it clear that not all of them are Mexican) WENT while they were gone. Nor was they any clear moment of change that would bring them back.

But I found this film funny, and no more full of caricature than any other comedy. I found most of the caricature to be true, especially that of the governor pro tem, who was entirely too familiar. I think I work with this guy.

I recommend seeing this movie, in spite of its weaknesses as a FILM; it fills a gap that has long existed in the media, telling a familiar story from a less familiar point of view. Especially if you live in California, it will land on your doorstep in some way.",1146096000,4,1320,4.561181434599156

2126312,2,B0002VEZ3U,"There are quite a few good films which are dramas or comedies with good entertainment/artistic merit that also have a strong political message - among these is Oliver Stone's ""Born on the Fourth of July""  There are also good films which are documentaries, whose primary goal is to argue for a political view point - among these is ""Martial Law 9/11: Rise of the Police State.""

But when a film tries to be some combination of the two, the result is seldom pretty.  And ""A Day Without a Mexican"" is no exception.

When I rented this DVD at my local video store, I wasn't expecting a great film like one of Oliver Stone's.  I was expecting a fun cheesy comedy that would of course have an underlying political message as its subtext - that Hispanics are vital to the society and economy of the U.S. in general and California in particular.

But instead of just letting the film take a natural flow and counting on the viewers being intelligent enough to deduce the message for themselves, the film makers went out of their way to beat people over the head with each point.  And just in case they didn't make everything painfully obvious enough, they paused the film every 10-15 minutes superimposed text across the screen with their commentary (using a stupid ""typing"" sound effect) - usually to point out obvious facts like ""Nicaragua and El Salvador aren't part of Mexico.""  If the director feels the need to offer a play by play commentary, then that's what the DVD commentary tracks are for!

All in all, this film gets a big thumbs down.  It was a good concept, and if done right it could have joined the ranks of other great cult-classic cheesy comedies.  But the film failed miserably.  Only giving it two stars because it had some half-way decent music.

It turned out to be a rather disturbing promotional piece for the Mexican community in California. The message was clearly, ""Non-Hispanic people in California are inept morons that cannot perform any simple functions without the help of Mexicans.""

I think the Producers of this movie really wanted to make a film with a strong socio-political statement but decided that they should throw in a few gags to get somebody to watch it. It was 95 percent statement and 5 percent entertainment. The message would have been more effective if that balance had been reversed.

2126315,5,B0002VEZ3U,"A day without Latinos, and the list goes on... In this hilarious mockumentary, the director is presenting a wonderful hypothetical statement: What would happen if all ""Latinos"" living in Los Angeles would disappear one day? (Does anyone dared to ask or proposed this question with concise examples and simple choices besides him?) It is well known that a lot of people lack of information about the 21 different Spanish-speaking countries represented in this big metropolis and their sub-cultures in the United States. There are so many stories about people asking if ""Mexican"" is also a language, or what part of Mexico is Quito, or Lima, etc.; it is also know the inconspicuous stories of stereotypes and labeling Latinos that a lot of people assume or take for granted. It is also very hard for the non-Latino communities identify a Latino with specific characteristics and perhaps the director wanted to take this responsibility with humor and awareness at the same time. On top of that, the fact remains that not every Latino eats enchiladas, chili, beans, plays soccer, dress uncoordinated, listen to Mariachi music, work illegally, have lots of children, live in a slum, or work around the fields, etc. In conclusion, using these results, the director chosen a trivial title that seems more relevant when referring to a Latino in California: A day without a Mexican; (Sorry to all our Latin/Spaniards/African Spanish Speaking brothers and sisters). I give two thumbs up to the director for having the courage of telling a story that no one dares to tell, regardless of the criticism and ignorance about the main issue.

2126316,3,B0002VEZ3U,"Reviewer:  Lawyeraau (Balmoral Castle) - See all my reviews

""This film is a satiric attempt at letting the viewer know the impact that Hispanics have had in this country, specifically in California. It is a well-intentioned film, but, unfortunately, it misses the mark, as it tries too hard to be too many things. It is unclear whether it wishes to be a satiric mockumentary or a straightforward film. Moreover, it is often confusing, plagued by unclear metaphors, as well as the use of the word ""Mexican"" as a euphemism for all Hispanics.

In the film, all Hispanics disappear from California, upon the arrival of a strange, pinkish fog that surrounds that state, cutting off its communication with the outside world. Before long, thirteen million of them have disappeared, leaving California in dire straits, a virtual ghost town. Politicians, professors, newscasters, domestics, musicians, day laborers, landscapers, and restaurant workers are some that are among the missing. Virtually no profession is left unscathed, as millions of Hispanics simply disappear from the face of the earth.

The premise of the film is viewed through a series of vignettes that focus on certain families who have been personally affected by the disappearance of the Hispanic population. Although some of its points are of interest and portions of the film are funny, as well as informative, the message of the film is lost on the viewer, as it is done in by bad acting, poor editing, inept writing, too many subplots, and scatter shot direction.

The story focuses on a young journalist's attempt to document the disappearances.  There is a plot twist, which some may suspect a little before the end.  The key themes of this movie could be summed up as (1) not all hispanics are Mexicans; and (2) some hispanics are not Mexicans.  You'll understand why those are actually different statements after you see the movie.

The most remarkable thing about this movie is that it casts a bright light on often deliberately overlooked aspects of our uneasy relationship with our neighbors, without becoming preachy.  Instead, infectious humor informs a border-defying humanity.  Gringo's are not automatically painted as either Racist Neocons or Syncretic Liberals -- those these are certainly presented.  Instead, each character is revealed through the deeds which define him.

1) Suddenly, a purple fog appears around California, isolating it from radio, internet, phone, and travel in or out.
2) Suddenly, all the Mexicans in California swiftly and silently vanish away.
3) No third one, two was enough.

Once started, it wanders pleasantly between a plotless assortment of vignettes: a wife whose husband and son disappeared, a Latina reporter who didn't (!), a clueless governor pro tem whose naivete borders on racism, and a farmer's son who's blatantly anti-Latino. Parts of it are funny - like the fact that being ""Mexican"" has little to do with Mexico. Parts are warm and touching, and a few very human surprises keep it from dragging.

There's a political subtext, rubbed in our collective faces with occasional comments scrawled on-screen. It never crosses into the shrill, however. The director has the good sense to realize that I'd turn off a blatant rant. He also knows that, if he wants to make use of my attention, he'd better give something in return - and what a movie returns is amusement. I consider myself repaid, mostly.

It wanders back and forth between a few sub-plots, and it has a happy ending. It's pleasant and just a little thought provoking, but I don't feel that my library needs it.

I really looked forward to seeing this film ,because of it's synopsis. The idea of waking up and finding that all of the Mexican born , people are no longer in the United States , really stimulated my imagination. Can you imagine ? We probably take so many aspects of American life for granted , that we couldn't imagine how it could effect us ( economically , socially , culturally, ect.). I know I couldn't. So, I was prepared for the makers of this film , to take me on that journey. Unfortunatly ,the writer of this film couldn't imagine how that day would be, either.  A Day Without a Mexican , is one of the worst films I've seen in years. With weak actors , raggedy cinematography , lousy music , contrived themes , strained attempts at humor, and an anemic script , this film flops, more than a frog with a belly ache. Ultimately , I believe it was the director's dilapitated sense of the direction, for the film , and lack of creativity, that provided the fatal blow , for me. No wonder I never saw it advertised or endorsed by any critics. There's no redeeming quality about it. And believe me, I tried to find something worthwhile, simply because I felt like a dummy , for wasting my time. In lamen terms.... it just, straight, sucked !!

I try the English, just in case--English.  I mean, I can watch it in English, sure, but that's not why I BOUGHT this disk instead of RENTING it at Bl********ster.  I tried it on my DVD player, my neighbor's, and on my computer with two different player applications - nowhere did anything but an English audio track show up.

VERY DISAPPOINTING.",1104192000,5,1128,4.717948717948718
2126335,3,B0002VEZ3U,"It is easy to think of Sergio Arau's 2004 film ""A Day Without a Mexican"" as a great idea poorly executed, especially when you check out the original 1998 short film version provided on the DVD.  In both versions the citizens of California wake up one day and discover that all the ""Mexicans"" are gone.  Actually, it is all the Latinos in the state, but as several people are quick to point out, everybody from South of the Border is a ""Mexican,"" even if they come from Guatemala or some other place (like Israel or Armenia).  ""A Day Without a Mexican"" attempts to show what would happen to California if suddenly one-third of its population disappeared.

But whereas the original short film sticks to the mocumentary approach, the full-length feature tries to be a real film as well.  In addition to working in many of the bits from the original short film, Arau now includes several narrative threads following Caucasians with strong ties to missing Latinos: Mary Jo Quintana (Maureen Flannigan) is a school teacher whose husband and son have disappeared; State Senator Steven Abercombie III (John Getz) and his family have to overcome the loss of their maid (now they cannot get the peanut butter off the top shelf) and then he becomes the acting governor; and television news anchor Vicki Martin (Suzanne Friedline) is concerned about the station's missing weatherman.  Then there is television news reporter Lila Rodriguez (Yareli Arizmendi, the co-writer and wife of the director), who would appear to be the only Latina who has not disappeared from California.  Meanwhile, an eerie pink fog has surrounded the state, cutting it off from the rest of the world.

The result is a hit and miss proposition.  All of the explanations offered by the experts on what has happened are the stuff of bad science fiction.  There are those who are happy the ""Mexicans"" are all gone, but then there are also the normal citizens rioting over fresh vegetables.  Arau obviously has a bit more money this time around, so ideas that were only talked about in the short film get expanded, so that now we get a television commercial for the ""Disappearance Day"" sale.  There are a couple of points where the film tries to get poignant, and while Lila's big speech is fully of admirable sentiment, it just goes too much against the grain of the satire of the film.  Going from tongue-in-cheek to heart in hand is tricky business, and ""A Day Without a Mexican"" never quite pulls it off.  Besides, if anything I want to say that this film lets it audience off of the hook too easily.  Even insipid racism deserves to be skewered and while there are parts of this film that remind me of a ""MAD TV"" skit, but without either the savage wit or the big laughs.

After watching both versions I have a preference for the original short film because I appreciate the irony that it does not include any Latinos outside of photographs: even the dramatizations have to use non-Latino actors (a fact which is duly noted).  But it also has a lighter touch than the expanded film version, which often uses sub-titles to make points and provide statistics (e.g., how many Latinos are on the L.A. Dodgers, how many countries are south of the border).  Basically it comes down to the difference between showing and telling, and the failure of this film is amplified by the fact that the underlying message is rather important.",1103500800,49,3390,4.746166950596252

Sat down to watch it, and it was a bad news-report-style movie, slow, bad acting, no plot -- maybe I missed it as I fast-forwarded through to try and find something worth watching.",1103328000,7,291,4.452830188679245
2126337,1,B0002VEZ3U,"If the director had really wanted to make a point across the racial/ethnic spectrum, then he would have made a movie called: A Day Without the Working Poor, or A Day Without the Working Class, or A Day Without Blue Collar Workers. His premise is erronoeous at so many levels. One, not all Mexicans work unskilled jobs, in fact, most Mexican Americans, like most Americans overall, are middle class. Major misconception. So, this is pretty unfair to Mexican American doctors, engineers, academia, etc. Second, not all Latinos are Mexicans, in fact, in parts of the US Mexicans do not make up the largest Latino population, not in New York (Puerto Ricans, Dominicans), not in Chicago, definitely not in Miami (Cubans, Haitians). Third, there are not enough undocumented Mexicans in the US to fill all these jobs, despite the stereotype, many of these jobs are also done by Filipinos, African Americans, and whites, as well as other assortments of immigrants and minorities. Last but not least, this might have been a great movie if it had included the underrepresented US working class that works hard for little money. The poverty-stricken white Wal-Mart employees, the African-American janitors, the Middle Eastern convenience store workers who get paid diddly, the underpaid Filipino airport employees, etc. Small idea from a small director. The US without undocumented immigrants would survive well enough, but without all the hard-working people of all backgrounds, it would not.",1102636800,11,1482,5.23109243697479
2126338,5,B0002VEZ3U,"This movie is a sci-fi/mockumentary/social message sort of movie that tells us a whole lot without taking itself too seriously to have fun. A strange fog surrounds the state of California, making it impossible for any communication outside the state or into it, and when the fog comes the Hispanic population disappears, save for one woman, a reporter by the name of Lila Rodriguez.

With a third of the population missing, California, a place with the fifth largest economy in the world, goes into a chaotic collapse. On the low end of the economy, there is no one to pick the fruit, which accounts for California's number one industry. Elsewhere, husbands, parents, and people from all walks of life, including the Border Patrol, vanish and leave friends and loved ones confused and lost. Freeways are empty, and there is a poignant scene in which we see a driverless lowrider go bouncing down a SoCal street.

The star of the film is the reporter left behind, the lone Hispanic, the ""L"" factor who becomes her own reality show as a camera is set up in her hospital room and people gather outside her window in a bizarre gringo seranade. However, it seems every character in this movie is well written and well acted without exception, from the lovesick anchorwoman to the governor and his ditzy wife.  The late Eduardo Palomo turns out a solid performance (I believe his last before he dropped dead of a heart attack) as Roberto Quintana, a Tejano rock front man who leaves behind a wife, two kids, and two front teeth.

This movie pretty much gives anyone the finger who has prejudices against the Mexican population of California, and indeed, the entire Hispanic population of the state. As it is pointed out in the movie, if a Hispanic lives on the West Coast, they are presumed to be Mexican. It's a hypothetical, ""you'll miss us if we are gone"", and it shows how dependent California economy is on the aliens from across the border, legal or not.

Political? Sure. Overwhelming in its political message? Not at all. This movie is hilarious, and the message is neither lost in the humor, nor is the humor lost in the message.

So, Californians, next time you want to complain about the ""beaners"", watch this movie.",1101772800,16,2221,4.740932642487047
2126339,2,B0002VEZ3U,"A DAY WITHOUT A MEXICAN  could have been a poignant infomercial on the historical importance of the first Californians versus how they are perceived today: California's crops depend on undocumented workers, day laborers are an essential part of the work force, the inherent tenderness of the 'nannies' who nurture the children of the upper classes, and that is not even beginning to touch on the cultural riches of the Mexican foods, music, arts, etc.

But Sergio Arau unfortunately takes his obvious love for the Mexican population and blends it with the banal. The 'docudrama' format works for a while, managing to illustrate the various prejudices and dependencies on Mexicans in a way that promises to be illuminating.  But almost as quickly as the actual hypothetical event, Arau begins to impose the concept of the Rapture as the reason all Mexicans in California are suddenly absent.  And it goes downhill from there.

The cast is basically unknowns and that works to the director's advantage: the 'white folk' are as faceless and as stereotyped as the Mexicans.  This could have been an important red flag alert to a testy point of philosophy that is as major a political situation in every state as it is  in California.  Other films have traveled this bumpy road better.  Grady Harp, November 2004",1100736000,3,1307,4.986175115207374
