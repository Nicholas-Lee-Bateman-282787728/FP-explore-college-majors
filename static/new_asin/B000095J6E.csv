1879600,5,B000095J6E,"This dvd has an awesome anointing on it!!  I was extremely blessed by her words, singing and energy.  Pressed down, shaken together and overflowing!!!!!!!! That's what I'm talking about!",1060732800,,186,5.379310344827586
1879601,5,B000095J6E,"I enjoy this video so much that I watch it at least once a day, and it's been a few weeks since I purchased it. Needless to say, when I like something, I wear it out! Ha! But I have to admit that Dorinda Clark-Cole's ministry is such a blessing to me. It started first with the CD and now this incredible video! I was present for the taping and I still watch it over and over again like I'm seeing it for the first time. Her anointing is simply off the chain! From ""If It Had Not Been for the Lord"" to ""I'm Still Here"", she gives you 110 percent! For those who don't know her, Dorinda is one of the world-famous Clark Sisters, arguably one of gospel music's best groups ever. But here, it's clear that this is her time to shine as a solo artist. However, as she points out, she couldn't have done it without the support of those around her. I particularly like that she incorporates so many young people in her ministry. As you'll see, most of the background singers, choir members, musicians and dancers are young enough to be her children. So, the energy is no doubt high and so is the praise! Through it all, Dorinda never misses a beat. Please support this video and don't forget to tell your friends and family about it. I know it's gonna bless 'em real good. Thanks again Dorinda for being such an anointed vessel of God - allowing the Lord to speak through you with such honesty and conviction. As the song goes: ""I am still here and it's by the grace of God."" Thank you.",1058659200,5,1478,4.24468085106383
1879602,5,B000095J6E,"Dorinda Clark-Cole Live has been a great blessing.
Dorinda allows the Holy Spirit to lead, guide, and instruct every born-again Christian's heart through this video.
From the highly-energized ""I'm Coming Out"" to the emotional, spirit-filled ""I'm Still Here"" this video is an awesome wonder and testimony of God's faithfulness and redeeming power through the blood of Jesus Christ.
Be blessed.",1057190400,,392,5.55
1879603,5,B000095J6E,"Anointed beyond words!! This DVD had me up dancing as well as crying my eyes out! When she sang ""I'm Still Here"", I was through because she really ministered and the place was erupting with worship and adoration. This is a must have!!",1056326400,5,234,4.465116279069767
1879604,5,B000095J6E,Mrs. Dorinda is an awesome Woman of God. So open and honest and even quite funny.... A great addition to any library of DVDs. She has a holy ghost power like all the Clarks...,1231459200,,175,4.176470588235294
1879605,5,B000095J6E,"I have had this dvd for years now and just now writing a review, but I watch it at least once every other week.  She just blesses my socks off on this dvd!  She is so real with her love for Christ and her ministry.  I love Kiera Sheard in her appearance ""Cant Hurry God"" (she is a back up singer for all of the songs).
I love the other songs, If It Had Not Been For The Lord, Angels, and her tribute to her mom.",1218585600,,411,3.755813953488372
1879606,5,B000095J6E,"Dorinda Clark-Cole is heaven sent! When I watched this DVD I was going through a particular situation in my life and she just came along and blessed me in song. There is no other like her, she's in a league of her own. That's exactly why she's my favorite gospel female singer. I would have loved to been there that night. Instead, I was in my living room; the DVD was an amazing experience. I recommend this to any and everyone. It is truly a blessing!",1211760000,,453,4.27906976744186
1879607,5,B000095J6E,"Evangelist Cole definitely is a sanga from God. She looks and sounds amazing in this DVD my favirites are No Not One on which she imitates her mother the late Dr. Mattie Moss Clark and sounds just like her and I'm Still Here. The backstage features are hilarious and expect to see many celebs such as Faith Evans, Kierra Sheard, The Dynamic Clark Sisters, Kirk Franklin, Donald Lawrence, Kurt Carr, Richard Smallwood, and Lele of SWV in the audience.",1179360000,,450,4.708860759493671
1879608,5,B000095J6E,This DVD speaks spiritually in so many ways. I just regret that I didn't purchase it sooner.,1170720000,,92,4.470588235294118
1879609,5,B000095J6E,Dorinda Clark what can you say??!!!!  Other than she is AWESOME!!!  I love this DVD!  I purchased it after I borrowed my roommates DVD and I show it to everyone who comes over my house!  She as well as her sisters are truly anointed and appointed!,1159833600,,247,4.304347826086956
1879610,5,B000095J6E,"After watching the video, i felt like I was back at church. Even though she didn't sing as many songs as I would have hoped, it was live so that's as many as expected, she was awesome. I love her. She really is annointed. I recommend her to everybody. I wish I could meet her in person.",1142294400,2,286,4.035087719298246
1879611,5,B000095J6E,"I first heard about the DVD from a friend.  This was after I listen to the CD once and really didn't care for it.  After I watched the DVD, I kept trying to figure out how I missed being ministered to for over a year by those anointed songs.  I played the DVD daily for at least four months before I let someone borrow it and it blessed my soul and helped me to realized what my calling is.  THIS IS A MUST HAVE DVD FOR EVERY BELIEVER OR PERSON WHO NEEDS TO HERE A WORD FROM THE LORD ABOUT YOUR SITUATION.  It was uplifting and liberating to see an anointed woman of God, who has been in the Gospel Music Industry for over 30 Years, talk so openly about her suicidal thoughts.  I would recommend this DVD to anybody.",1123459200,,716,4.078571428571428
1879612,5,B000095J6E,"I have been watching this DVD for about two months straight since I got it. I was feeling discouraged in my life and the anointing of Dorinda's ministry and performance has uplifted my spirit so much and reminded me that I am still here by the grace of GOD.. I love the entire DVD. The sincerity shines through and her personal testimony is so wonderful. I have been a fan of Karen Clark Sheard for years and now Dorinda has been added to the list. If it had not been for the Lord, I would not have ordered her DVD and be here to tell you all about this wonderful ""Rose"" of gospel. There are truly angels watching over us all. Be encouraged and please get this DVD.",1111795200,2,665,4.203125
1879613,5,B000095J6E,"Put your dancing shoes on and warn your neighbors...You will dance with joy from beginning to to the end. This video has really blessed my soul, it has touched me in so many ways.  Anyone that is just looking for entertainment shouldn't stop here..it's more than that, it's a ministry.  Dorinda ministered to my empty soul.  There are so many things that I've taken for granted and I realize that the things i've been through..i'm not alone..she made it, I made and I'M STILL HERE!",1111276800,2,481,4.635294117647059
1879614,5,B000095J6E,"I first got Dorinda's CD, and I was blown away by it. She's one of my favorite of the Clark Sisters. Her and Karen. They have such a powerful and anointed voice! So when I got this DVD just this week, I haven't been able to stop watching it!! It's HOT!! Dorinda's vocal, and her anointing as a minister!! Man had me praising and shouting like I was right in that church!! I love this DVD!! I can't wait for the next one. This DVD is worth getting!! You will definately love it!!",1111190400,,478,4.150537634408602
1879615,1,B000095J6E,"but this dvd is disappointing.  Nothing seems to fit.  Introductions by Eddie Long & Byron Cage at the beginning of the DVD and the hip-hop dancers struggle for belonging on this DVD.  Why are there no shots of the band?  The material is not worthy of Dorinda's anointed voice and the entire project seems thrown together.  For these reasons, this DVD has only seen my DVD player once in the 2 years I've had it.",1109376000,,412,4.44
1879616,5,B000095J6E,"Dorinda Clark-Cole has had such an impact of my life, she just stays on top of her game through the whole concert. She made me feel that I was at the concert, it wasn't no concert, it was a healing, and worship experience. From IF It Wasn't For The Lord, to No One, to You CAn't Hurry God, to the moving song I'm Still Here, to the end of I'm Coming Out.
Dorinda proves to be the best in gospel music, as she go on to win numerous awards, and acheive many accomplishments. Dorinda, will still be here for many years to come..Go ahead Dorinda, because I'm Coming Out",1082592000,,565,4.192660550458716
1879617,5,B000095J6E,"You're not supposed to give out 5 stars but this was well deserved. Dorinda did not give less than a 110% through out the performance. Not only did Dorinda do an excellent job her neice also gave to the congregation as well as the viewers. I loved it! My only complaint if any...I was disappointed with there being only 6 songs. Just when you're getting into it and wanting more, it's over. I give it a 5, even still.",1076457600,,417,4.291139240506329
1879618,5,B000095J6E,"The energy of Evangelist Cole comes throught the screen. She puts the j in jazzy with her beautiful personality and scatty runs. I love the all the Clark sister each for there different attributes but my favorite is Evangelist Cole. If you love gospel this is a MUST have you can shout, clean, cook and enjoy this DVD. God bless you Evangelist and may God continue to use you as one of his vessels.",1075420800,,398,4.391891891891892
1879619,5,B000095J6E,"Dorinda Clark-Cole
This is only the beginning for you, God is not through with you yet. I really enjoy your music as well as your sisters' music, it's so inspiring. Contiue to let God use you and be encouraged. I won't even get into expressing my feelings because I can go on forever. Hopefully some day the musical gift inside of me will touch someone as your music has touched me.
Mrs. Clark your performance at the 2003 Stellar Awards was ""OUTSTANDING."" I got to see you in person, it was ""GREAT."" GO GIRL!
Hello to all the CLARK SISTERS fans!",1073952000,,546,4.415841584158416
1879620,5,B000095J6E,"The Rose of Gospel Music, Dorinda Clark-Cole, is blessed to have endured all of her hardships and it is evident in the song, ""I'm Still Here."" She really moved me with her vivid testimony during the song. I literally cried witnessing and discerning the fiery spirit she has for God through that testimony. The entire album and cd as a whole was an awesome experience. I enjoyed her musical concept, the singers' vocals were on point, the bonus features of the Celebrity Basketball Game and the behind-the-scenes, and the liturgical dance team gives the production so much life. Oh yeah, Kierra ""Kiki"" Sheard, Karen Clark-Sheard's daughter lit up the spotlight with Dorinda on ""You Can't Hurry God."" Look out for her album as well. The entire family is still blessed with a load of talent and an inspirational spirit of worship.",1070928000,3,827,4.872340425531915

7989619,5,B000095J6E,"The DVDs was what I expected, very entertaining. Dorinda is a consummate professional and she knows how to minister very well to her audience. The production of the DVDs is top of the line. Well worth the money spent. The songs : No, Not One and "" I'm Still Here "" , are a special experience just to watch The energy Dorinda expends in performing them.

7989625,5,B000095J6E,"What more can be said about this powerful woman of God? This DVD is truly inspirational. She starts off with If it had not been for the lord, which is a great uptempo way to open the DVD. The next song No not one is so annointed, and reminds us that no one can do you like Jesus, the way it ends is amazing, the background (which includes nieces Angel Chisolm and Kierra Sheard) is on point just awesome. Wait on him is uptempto and the features Kierra Sheard leading a little bit when her aunt goes to change, just powerful. The most moving portion of the DVD would have to be Still Here, I cry and become so overwhelmed with emotion and thankfulness every time I see that song. When she talks about her thoughts of sucide at a low point in her life, I just think, has she ever watched this? What an annointing that rests on her, what would we do without this powerful woman of God? I hope she realizes just how much of a blessing she really is. There isn't really anything bad to say about this DVD. I will say that sometimes the lighting was a bit of an issue(too dark), and the camera crew didn't appear to be on the same page as Dorinda at times, other than that just awesome from an awesome woman of God!",1259798400,,1210,4.1752136752136755
