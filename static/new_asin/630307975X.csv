Focus On The Family is proud to present this special limited edition for your family's enjoyment this Christmas season.

Young Davey and his dog, Goliath are busy preparing for Christmas season. In the process of decorating the house, buying his presents, and picking out a Christmas tree, Davy just doesn't have the Christmas spirit. It's not until he befriends the stranger in town - the new boy who works at the Christmas tree lot, and gives him a very special gift, that Davey begins to both feel and understand the true meaning of the Christmas spirit. This delightful presentation reminds us all what Christmas is all about.  Running Time: 30 minutes",1103328000,3,671,4.868421052631579

My son  loves Telebubbies, FisherPrice Little People, and Thomas the Tank Engine --  we are glad to add Davey & Goliath to this list.  Nothing is blowing  up, no character is yelling at another character, and there is a lesson to  be learned in each episode.  A rare find in today's video choices.  Five  stars for Davey & Goliath's ""The Waterfall""!",965520000,9,552,4.474747474747475
