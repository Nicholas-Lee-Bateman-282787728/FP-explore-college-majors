8615525,5,B00FG7W730,"These are the real deal.  I just got mine in the mail after a month of waiting.  You can get them through the amazon uk site and they are super cheap compared to the outrageous collector's prices that the US releases go for.  They are all in one big case and mine is broken so it won't close and I did have to buy a $54 region free player.  I think i still saved like $400+ just on this set ( I am still waiting for volume 2).  They played right out of the box and are in English (along with like 12 other languages), etc.  Needless to say, an amazing collection.  Includes the Mickey mouse in living color 1 & 2 and Donald Duck (1 thru 3).  From what I can tell so far, all special features and such are here.  There is one exception and that's the war time shorts like Der furher's face.  That particular one and others are missing from international releases but, Fall out and fall in are on here.  So it looks like they picked out certain ones that were 'offensive'.  The good news is that you can get the Disney Treasures:  on the front lines for those.  That is actually a really cheap U.S. Disney treasures set that contains a great collection of war time shorts.  Would I rather have the nice US releases in the tins, etc.?  YES.  But, this more fits my budget.",1440028800,7,1269,4.177685950413223
