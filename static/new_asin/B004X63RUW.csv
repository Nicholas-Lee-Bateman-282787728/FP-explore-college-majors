4492221,5,B004X63RUW,"This movie has an interesting plot ,and you get to see and hear an older, more mature Errol Flynn in a tuxedo in a casino in Havana,Cuba before the Communists took over. This movie was filmed in Havana. I like this story a lot. It was slow and built up to a familiar end as far as movies go about the mob and Havana. A delight for Errol Flynn fans in lovely black and white.",1396224000,,374,4.0
4492222,2,B004X63RUW,"Disappointing and a bit of a downer; expected better from one of my classic movie favorites, Errol Flynn. This must have been one of the last he ever made.",1394841600,,155,4.379310344827586
4492223,2,B004X63RUW,"One of Errol Flynn's last films before his death.  This low-budget production does manage some wonderful shots of the city of Havana, but great scenery isn't enough to recommend this picture.  The audio overdubs for a significant portion of the film are somewhat out of sync making for a distracting experience.  Also, the strained relationship of the two sisters is briefly mentioned, but never really explained.  The third act would have benefited from greater tension between the sisters, which would have added much needed drama and uncertainty to the proceedings.  By the way, this is the first film where the hard drinking lifestyle of Flynn is clearly apparent as his face appears older than what he actually was.  Fans of directors John Huston and Alfred Hitchcock may find this movie interesting. (Think ""The Maltese Falcon"" and ""North By Northwest"" since this tale evokes similar themes in the most broad manner)  Sadly however, ""The Big Boodle"" falls short in weaving together an effective thriller.

  For Errol Flynn fans, this gritty thriller will remind them of another Flynn picture, ""Mara Maru"" (1952).  As for the MGM DVD-R available on Amazon.com, the quality is good so no worries there for collectors.  The audio sync issues are simply a product of low-budget filmmaking, not with the film to DVD transfer.  In other words, that's how the movie was made, so nothing one can do about that.  The video quality is solid considering its age and the likely neglect it has endured over the years.",1359331200,5,1511,4.992
4492224,3,B004X63RUW,"The boodle of the title is a wad of fake bank notes given by a blonde player to Errol Flynn, a croupier in a Havana casino. Flynn is arrested on suspicion of counterfeiting but is released when an unknown benefactor pays his bail. For the rest of the movie Flynn dodges gangsters, corrupt bank officials and bullets in an effort to track down those responsible. This is a fairly unremarkable film with Flynn turning in an unremarkable performance. However, good location photography compensates with the streets, plazas, landmarks and historic locales of Havana appearing to good effect. The story moves along at a fast pace and the film never becomes uninteresting.

It comes as a nice surprise to find this DVD-R contains a good black and white print. Picture quality is generally crisp, clear and detailed, with deep blacks and clean whites. Print damage is minimal but occasionally a faint green hue and chroma appear. The movie is in the 4:3 ratio and looks like it was filmed this way rather than a pan and scan version of a widescreen print. Sound is equally as good - dialogue is clear and easy to understand with a minimum of hiss. The only extra is a theatrical trailer of the film. There are no subtitles or other languages. Recommended only for Errol Flynn completists.",1327449600,20,1281,4.77027027027027

4492237,2,B004X63RUW,I love Errol Flynn - but he was just putting in time to make money. It is pretty awful to watch,1440201600,,95,3.5714285714285716
4492238,4,B004X63RUW,"This underrated film noir sleeper has a left handed appeal that seems to be missed by many reviewers here. Obviously low budget but great cast and solid acting. The eye candy includes pre-commie Havana and two of the most gorgeous noir babes you've ever seen. Flynn gets rough handled or tongue lashed by thugs, cops and bureaucrats every five minutes but still manages to dish out some verbal and physical zingers. The convoluted plot keeps you guessing up to last reel. Flynn looks jaded, world weary and perfectly believable as a man who won't take an injustice lying down. Highly recommended.",1439942400,4,596,4.910891089108911

4492243,5,B004X63RUW,"I almost feel like I should apologize for giving this five stars but I loved the Big Boodle. Flynn was really coming to be recognized for great character acting and the plot is no stinker either. Sound and picture quality excellent considering what they probably had to work with. I have been a Flynn fan for almost 50 years and I actually enjoy the later pictures (not all of them) somewhat better than most of the earlier stuff. On camera, at least, Flynn ages well and fits these type of parts like a glove. He gets beaten up, shot and stabbed in the first couple of minutes of the movie, so he's not supposed to look like the picture of health. What he does look like is a handsome guy that got badly beaten up. ""From Here to Eternity"" it's not, but for a nice film noir before bed it does nicely. Ditto the previous reviews about the gorgeous Havana scenery. B&W fit the character of the movie, but I can't help but wonder if color might have been the way to go just for the location shots.",1416787200,,995,4.297872340425532
4492244,5,B004X63RUW,"Actually this a  reasonably good film and one in which we can sit back and enjoy the acting skills of Errol Flynn.  Undervalued as
a character actor, he brings to the part an understanding of bitterness and loss that would not be possible in a younger actor.  Still
handsome and still exuding a level of physical athleticism, the main character, an American casino dealer living in pre-communist
Cuba, is caught in the middle of a counterfeit scheme that threatens his life and well-being.  I would recommend it to lovers of
crime dramas, thrillers, mysteries, black and white films, and of course, fans old and new of Errol Flynn.

I would actually give it 5 stars!  Great for a lazy afternoon or a quiet evening.",1405209600,7,714,4.717741935483871

8446176,4,B004X63RUW,Flynn obviously a weary man but his acting is OK as always. Good Havana location filming. B-movie.,1493251200,,98,4.823529411764706
8446177,5,B004X63RUW,"This is one of my favorite Flynn films. Despite the B-movie treatment, Flynn turns in a very convincing performance.

Though technically not considered a classic noir film since it lacks some standard noir features, like dark expressionistic cinematography & stark, high-contrast lighting, it nevertheless has the gritty feel of noir. Shot on location in 1957 pre-revolution Cuba, it's sort of a time capsule of old Havana as it was then. The city is very much a character in the story, especially Morro Castle, the ancient Spanish citadel guarding the harbor, where the climax occurs.

The story is pretty simple noirish fare, involving counterfeiting, a down-on-his-luck expat casino croupier (Flynn), a beautiful banker's daughter, mob thugs, corrupt police, etc.,. But the cast is quite decent, and Flynn is entirely convincing. In real-life he'd recently suffered a serious financial setback and seems to really identify with his character's troubles. While pushing 50 & no longer a swashbuckler, Flynn is still impressively athletic and does many of his own fight scenes & stunts. The movie is obviously a low budget production & the direction is efficiently utilitarian; not much time for elaborate setups, yet the lighting and camerawork aren't bad at all.

One of the ways I judge a movie is by how memorable it is. I've seen this one several times and despite it's modest budget, the classic 50's B&W B-movie style is visually enduring. Underrated & worth seeing.",1491004800,,1473,5.206751054852321
8446178,2,B004X63RUW,Not the usual handsome and charming Errol Flynn that I'm used to seeing.  I was disappointed in this movie.  I had read some negative reviews about it but still had hopes that I would like it.  All I can say is that it's okay but not something I want to watch over and over.,1483747200,,274,4.037037037037037
8446179,4,B004X63RUW,"I liked this movie.  When watched against the backdrop of the last years of the Batista Regime and Flynn's involvement as a correspondent following Castro, it's more believable.  There's nothing phony about Flynn's world-weariness --- an actor never given the credit he deserved.",1480809600,,279,5.465116279069767
