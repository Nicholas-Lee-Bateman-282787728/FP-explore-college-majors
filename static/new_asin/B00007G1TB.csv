7975804,3,B00007G1TB,"Skeeter Bayer and Chan Biggs get Amazon's top billing in this early Roger Corman effort, but the two were hired as skiers and did little acting.  The real stars are Frank Wolfe and Michael Forrest; Richard Sinatra (a nephew of Frank) had the other major role.  I worked as a grip on this film (in between stints in college), and occasionally as a German soldier extra.  It was filmed at Terry Peak in Lead, South Dakota, the second of two films Corman made in the Black Hills that year.  (Corman co-produced the other, a classic, low budget horror stinker called ""The Beast from the Haunted Cave"" which was filmed in nearby Deadwood, mostly at the Franklin Hotel and the Old Style Bar  -- the ""cave"" was an abandoned gold mine on Deadwood's outskirts.)  Corman (whom Wolfe liked to call ""C.B,.""  as in Cecil B. DeMille) actually did direct this movie, which isn't that bad considering the miniscule budget he had to work with.  At least, it's not embarrassingly amateurish like the unintentionally campy ""Beast"" that has his name on it.  Only for hard-bitten Corman fans.",1362182400,2,1071,4.745945945945946
7975805,3,B00007G1TB,"Roger Corman presents this cheapie war film in a very fast way, only running a little over an hour. It is surprisingly entertaining. Every war film stereotype is here, except for the fact that these guys are on skiis the whole time. The plot follows an American recoinnaise team sent to map out the territory. When they stumble onto a bridge, they decide to blow it up to mess up the Nazis. It is not a particular great film but if one had an hour to kill and nothing better to watch than it might be worth it. Definitely not one of Corman's better films, but it works for what it is. Recommened for any war film buff or Roger Corman fan.",1322265600,,638,4.237704918032787
7975806,2,B00007G1TB,"roger corman i think has directed every kind of film there is . this is his war movie(i don't know if he did anymore)and even though this is one bad print i got mine in a dollar bin and for that price it's not that bad. the fact he was able to put this war movie together on such a small budget. get it cheep but if you likewar movies or just like corman,this is your movie",1147132800,,373,3.857142857142857
7975807,2,B00007G1TB,"Low budget, mostly poor acting, but the work involved in shooting this in that kind of terrain and weather is why I give it two stars and not just one.  There seems to be some frames missing and the film copy used for this DVD is poor.  But hey, it was less than four bucks!",1139356800,,274,3.963636363636364
