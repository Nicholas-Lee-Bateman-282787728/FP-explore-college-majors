8217943,3,B000VBH1M8,"I ordered this one, because I had the old volume 10 type which was unfortunately damaged by lightning storm somehow back feeding all the way to my VCR erasing/corrupting a portion of the tape eventhough my VCR was on a surge protector, and I could not find a volume 10 online anywhere. However, I did not find this volume 12 as motivational as volume 10.  Tae bo live basic volume 10 had 2 people in the video, one of which was a really old lady, that made me say to myself, if she can do it so can I, plus the background music timed with the exercise had a really good beat. Often I find exercise DVDs lacking that quality. For me, it's mostly about the music picking up tempo just at the point of the exercise where you would want to quit, but the music is too good so you just keep going. I wish Billy Banks would reproduce these old tapes to DVD, because I'd certainly order a few of them online.",1358553600,,900,4.172413793103448
