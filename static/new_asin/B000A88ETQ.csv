2379440,5,B000A88ETQ,I don't see how anyone could not love Ellen DeGeneres. The woman is brilliant. I just love how witty she is & enjoy her clever ability to use every day situations that we all have shared experience in to help us enjoy the irony in life. I love her. :),1237852800,,251,4.04
2379441,5,B000A88ETQ,I have always loved Ellen.  These CDs allow you to enjoy her as a stand up act.  Some of her best work.,1234742400,,103,3.6363636363636362
2379442,1,B000A88ETQ,"Her show was aired tonight as part of a series of the best stand up comedians of our time and I made sure I was around to see this. A big fan of her persona and on most issues in line with her views in a broader sense I even insisted my family stayed up to watch her 'live'.

I am perplexed to see the couple of reviews already as I found it absolutely disappointing. It seems from her show and the reviews it was more a question of validating her 'coming out' rather than meant as comedy. Sure she made a few nice anecdotes mostly about the obvious frustrations of our time but she did not manage to make any of us do more than smile a couple of times - not once did we laugh out loud. I have full and total respect for her bravery in coming out in a country so divided over an issue we don't even consider an issue in Europe but I fail  to see why people should pay to go to a show or buy a DVD because of that... send her a donation or a letter of admiration if you want to support her.....

Unless the show erroneously was labeled stand-up comedy and it is meant as a tribute to Ellen or her sexuality I totally miss the point of this show and cannot recommend it to anyone looking for a decent laugh.

I certainly will need to build credibility again before anyone will listen to my recommendations on stand-up comedy again!",1229731200,6,1329,4.080459770114943
2379443,5,B000A88ETQ,"Both of these stand-ups are absolutely hilarious.  You will be thinking of her jokes for many years after you've watched it.  There have been numerous times that an everyday occurence has made me laugh and remember something she said in these routines. Buy this, you will most definitely enjoy watching it again and again or sharing with friends.",1197244800,,346,4.948275862068965
2379444,5,B000A88ETQ,"For those of you living under a rock, Ellen Degeneres is the host of her own hit talk show. Of course, she wouldn't be where she is today if she hadn't gained national fame through her comedy.

The Beginning is extremely funny. Especially since it was taped only three years after she came out. She makes alot more references to her sexuality in it than in Here and Now. The topics range from losing attention during conversations, to her stops at a health food store and a sex store, to even God herself. Here and Now is alot more family friendly than The Beginning, but both will make you laugh at how accurate they are to the everyday world.

Whether you're a fan of her talk show, a fan of her in general, or just enjoy a good comedy set, this DVD will not disappoint.",1181952000,9,772,4.317241379310345

2379448,5,B000A88ETQ,"I recently got the chance to attend a taping of the Ellen Degeneres show (she danced with me, ha!) and I have to admit that I teared up when I actually got to see her in person.  It has been a dream of mine for quite a while.  Not only are these DVDs extremely funny and original, but they have some very touching moments, as well.  The interpretive dance in ""The Beginning"" gave me chills, even as it made me laugh.  And seeing Ellen tear up when she came out (ha) in ""Here and Now"" was beautiful.  I admire this woman's strength and ability, and I strive to be like her.  If you have a chance, buy this DVD set, you won't, can't possibly, be sorry.  :)",1155513600,29,654,4.102362204724409

2379459,5,B000A88ETQ,Some comedians are very engaging without having to be foul-mouthed and she is one of them.  Ordinary day-to-day experiences are really funny if you stop to think about them and Ellen does.  Giggles and laughter are great medicine.,1402790400,,230,5.026315789473684
2379460,1,B000A88ETQ,"Don't bother buying this book and if you do, don't bother reading it. I ended up sending my copy to a book dealer in New Zeeland hoping that DeGeneres' name would at least get it sold and contribute a few bucks to her new book company. If you want to read something worth reading, read what Portia has written.",1396396800,,310,4.271186440677966

2379465,5,B000A88ETQ,"I really loved these standup routines of Ellen's.  Her humor is my kind of humor in that there is very little swearing, sex/relationship jokes or mocking of others.  Just the everyday situations most of us face from time to time made hysterically funny.
The quality of the dvd's is excellent and it arrived promptly in the mail.  The price was right too.",1367798400,,354,4.67741935483871
