7565655,5,B0199ITMVG,I love watching a new game sack episode every saturday  and can't wait for volume 2,1450483200,5,83,4.1875
7565656,5,B0199ITMVG,I love Game Sack so I bought this collection. The bonus features on here are so epic. The classic videos from the early 90s are so bad ass. Looked like so much stupid fun.,1466640000,,171,4.0588235294117645
7565657,5,B0199ITMVG,"Game Sack is the most informative and down right awesome show about video games/systems on the internet! It's cool to see these first episodes and how far they've come...Like any show that just starts off, it's gonna be a learning/refining process, but it's to be expected for a couple of guys just starting on a venture. I mean these guys aren't polished actors or have majored in communication...They didn't have a professional studio and all that type of stuff, directors etc. So all things considered the progression of the show was pretty quick if you ask me, it evolved into something very polished. If you go checkout there youtube channel, the new episodes are pro...you'd be hard pressed to find a better show that's more informative then Game Sack.",1465344000,,758,4.883720930232558
7565658,5,B0199ITMVG,"Big fans of the show and the hosts.  Presentation is clean and easy to navigate, and the illustrations for each video on the Blu-Ray are hilarious!  Glad I bought this, and hope they may do this with later videos in their collection.",1464134400,,233,4.523809523809524
7565659,5,B0199ITMVG,Best show... ever,1463875200,,17,5.0
7565660,5,B0199ITMVG,Love gamesack so I gotta buy their stuff and was pleasantly surprised by their bonus features.,1462492800,,94,4.9375
7565661,5,B0199ITMVG,"Game Sack is a great show and the disc is filled with loads of extras.  I enjoy their sarcastic at times wit, they both bring the knowledge and are both very creative.",1462060800,,167,4.21875
7565662,5,B0199ITMVG,"Like many have said, this is a GREAT show with little vulgarity and just good 'ol fashion fun. The chemistry between Joe and Dave works very well. My favorite thing about the show is how down to earth the two of them are. Just a couple of buddies having fun and sharing old school gaming goodness.

The Blu-Ray is special to me because you get more of Joe and Dave... Just doing what they do. When watching the regular you-tube show, I often find myself looking forward to them cutting away from the games and just seeing what they have to say to eachother. The bonus material adds a lot more face time and the extra commentary breaths new life into the episodes I have already seen. The old videos and footage of them just having fun was cool too because they obviously enjoyed making them but more importantly don't care what the critics/nah sayers have to say.

Overall 5 stars for sure and if you watch them on a regular basis you will enjoy having a physical disc to cement this great Era of you-tube viewing.

Thank you Joe, Dave and Jen!",1461542400,,1044,4.398963730569948
7565663,5,B0199ITMVG,"This is a great thing to watch. If you are interested in retro games, you need to take a look at this.",1458604800,,102,3.6818181818181817
7565664,3,B0199ITMVG,"Very funny and honest compilation of the first 20 episodes of Game Sack.  The first 20 episodes aren't the reason you would buy this, but the extras and commentary are worth the price of admission.",1458518400,,197,4.628571428571429
7565665,5,B0199ITMVG,"Game Sack is the best. Hope they release more volumes, the quality of the show only got better the longer they did it. Special features on the disc are a nice bonus.",1457395200,,165,4.1875
7565666,5,B0199ITMVG,"This sucker is packed with so many extras!!!! Commentary on EVERY SINGLE EPISODE really sheds light on Joe and Dave's quirky personalities. The overall quality is top notch. Most movies released by big name movie companies don't have the quality and features this has. If you are a Game Sack fan, this is everything and more than you could want!!! One of the very best ive seen!!!",1456790400,,380,4.686567164179104
7565667,5,B0199ITMVG,Watch it with my kids. Family favorite ,1456099200,,39,4.571428571428571
7565668,5,B0199ITMVG,"I first discovered Game Sack on YouTube in 2013 when I was doing a random search on YouTube for the Sega Saturn. Joe and Dave did the best review of the system and games that I have ever seen, and I have been hooked on watching Game Sack ever since. It's professionally done and reminds me of a show that would have been on Tech TV during its heyday. These are two guys that really have a passion for gaming and sharing those experiences with an audience in a fun, lighthearted, and entertaining way. If you have an interest in gaming, you should be watching Game Sack. I'm glad to see that they decided to do a physical release, as it gives me an opportunity to show my support for the show, which, honestly, should be way more popular than it is. There is no angry yelling shtick here, as this has been done to death by now and is now more obnoxious than it is funny or entertaining. Instead, you have two guys who seem to genuinely enjoy their hobby of making videos and talking about video games.

The picture quality of this BluRay is better than the HD videos on YouTube, as a BluRay doesn't have to compress the video to save on bandwidth. The audio remains great as ever, as there is no over-modulation due to poor audio equipment, even in the comment tracks. There are a lot of extras and bonus features that are actually interesting and fun to watch, which make this more than just a collection of YouTube videos. The menus are very well done, as is the artwork for each episode in the chapter select. Game Sack has come a long ways since these early episodes, but Joe and Dave seem to find their groove in the final few episodes of Volume 1. The commentary tracks are entertaining to listen to and a nice bonus for fans. Some may say that the price is a bit steep, but keep in mind that this is something that has been produced independently, rather than by a major studio that has the money and resources to promote and ship to big box retailers in order to sell in bulk at a lower price to the consumer. It's obvious that a lot of time, effort, and thought went in to this release. I'm excited to see what the future holds for Game Sack, but for now...Shut up and take my money!",1455494400,2,2191,4.292270531400966
7565669,5,B0199ITMVG,Game Sack rules! Can't wait for volume two.,1455408000,,43,4.5
7565670,5,B0199ITMVG,"Joe and Dave (the hosts/creators of GameSack) have been my favorite YouTube hosts for a good while now.  When you watch their episodes, you can tell that they aren't just creating new episodes to make a quick buck...they clearly care about what they do.  They also keep a good balance of professionalism (Joe's editing skills are top-notch) and light-hearted fun (lots of little gags and jokes throughout the reviews).  Because of this, I was happy to pick up this compilation and support their work.  The disk also includes some bonus features that I really enjoyed (like a short documentary about how the show got started).  I hope they keep releasing these compilations because I'll definitely keep buying them.",1455408000,,714,5.016949152542373
7565671,5,B0199ITMVG,"If you grew up in the 80/90s and love video games, this is the show for you. Each episode is loaded with retro game reviews. Some of the voice overs are over the top bad, but it just adds to the shows charm. The show is funny but still more serious than AVGN or Pat the NES Punk. This Blu-ray disc contains the first 20 episodes of Game Sack with 2-20 in HD and episode one in 480p. I just got the disc in the mail today and still have to check out the bonus material, even though I am very happy with my purchase.",1455321600,,514,3.9047619047619047
7565672,5,B0199ITMVG,"I'm very pleased with this Blu Ray.  Now I have the first twenty episodes in their highest available quality, and all of them dubbed over with commentary by Joe and Dave.  I like listening to Joe and Dave, so hearing this new and exclusive commentary for the first time on this disc is a huge value for me.

Speaking of value, there are a ton of extras on the disc.  They've included an interactive Choose Your Own Adventure game starring Dave and Joe that purports to have 10 different endings.  This game is hilarious.  I haven't seen all of the endings, but most of them feel more like dead ends than endings.  It's a little frustrating that you have to restart the game completely after each ending, but it is really funny and it's very well put together.

When I heard that this disc would contain some of their old videos, I was sold.  As a casual Game Sack fan, I've only seen bits and pieces of what Joe has put together before Game Sack, but it's all been entertaining.  The videos included here are fun to watch, and they've all got commentary by Joe and Dave.  I would love to see more old videos in future compilations!",1454630400,,1131,4.389423076923077
7565673,5,B0199ITMVG,Amazing!,1454457600,,8,8.0
7565674,5,B0199ITMVG,"This Blu Ray was so enjoyable, I decided to post my first Amazon review, just to talk about it. The extras alone on this are well worth the purchase price and I honestly couldn't be more pleased. Joe obviously put a lot of hard work and effort into making this, just like they do with the show itself. I can't even count the number of games I'd never even heard of, let alone played before watching Game Sack. If you appreciate this show, I highly recommend buying it. Not just for the 10 plus hours of content, but as a thank you for all the free content they've been putting out for almost 5 years. For anyone worried their money would be going to pad the pockets if Internet millionaires, think again. These are 2 regular guys, who love playing and talking about video games so much, they put countless hours into self-producing show and Blu Ray on virtually no budget. If you still appreciate digital media and the cool extras you can't see elsewhere, help support this amazing show and give them a reason to keep doing it. This review might come across a bit fanboy-ish, but I guarantee you, it's worth the money. And really... what's more convincing than a guarantee from some random dude on the internet?",1453939200,,1211,4.509090909090909
7565675,5,B0199ITMVG,"Very good content and in HD to boot! Was a bit overpriced, but you get a lot of content for your money.",1453939200,,103,3.727272727272727
7565676,4,B0199ITMVG,"Kind of misleading editorial review. From the review: ""Check out these first episodes in HD and find out!"" Um, no. The first seven or so episodes are in SD (confirmed in the audio commentary), then they switched to 720p, and it wasn't until around episode to that they went to 1080. So yeah, only 2/3rds of the episodes on this disc are in HD.

The audio commentary on EVERY EPISODE is a nice feature. Each episode has its own menu page with custom art. They put chapter markers like every 1-2 minutes in the episode, which may be a bit of an overkill. The markers don't see to be at anywhere specific, but rather like they went into each episode and told it to put in 5 chapter markers at equal intervals throughout the show.

So yeah, I am enjoying the disc, and I like financially supporting shows I watch regularly on Youtube by buying their discs and stuff. And the audio commentaries are something you won't get on Youtube, so there is a bonus there",1453680000,,955,4.420454545454546

7565683,5,B0199ITMVG,"This collection is awesome, top notch video/audio quality and of course the classic wooden delivery of Joe and Dave. My absolute favorite show on YT, please support these guys so we can have Game Sack Blu ray Volume 2-10!",1452556800,2,221,4.6923076923076925
7565684,5,B0199ITMVG,"All I can say is WOW! This Blu Ray will turn any Game Sack fan into a Game Sack Super Fan! I watched everything the bonus features had to offer in a single sitting just minutes after opening the packaging.
  It was awesome to see how Game Sack started in their ""It Begins"" documentary! Its interesting to see how Game Sack came to be.
  The exclusive Random Battle 3 episode was also awesome! I felt bad for Dave! Joe got super lucky getting the game he did! It was pretty much untouchable compared to the one Dave got (I won't spoil the games they were given)! I really enjoyed the commentary too!
  The ""Choose Your Destiny"" interactive video had to be my favorite bonus feature. I could talk about it all day! Its super awesome and I won't spoil it for anyone.
  They also offer all of the 20 ending skits from the 20 episodes on the Blu Ray (which are hilarious by the way) but I ended up not watching that one until later because I love seeing the skits at the end of their corresponding videos but its most definitely an appreciated feature!
  They also show you tons of illustrations of Joe and Dave, including the ones used for this Blu Ray. They started the presentation of the illustrations with awesome music from SoulBlade (much appreciated)! All the art shown is really awesome and I truly do hope they use the artist for Volume 2!
  The Old Videos by Joe and Dave were really cool to watch. Although I was just a kid in the 90's it gave me a bit of nostalgia. I used to make videos like that with my friends when I was an early teen so this was not only awesome to watch, (especially with commentary!) but it brought back some fond memories too.
  This is all-in-all an absolutely amazing Blu Ray that literally every Game Sack fan needs in their collection. For the price, this is an absolute steal. Thank you Joe, Dave, and Jennifer for doing this! I WILL be buying Volume 2 when it comes out!
  P.S. Everyone should check out finalbosses.com for even more Game Sack awesomeness!",1452384000,8,1995,4.395095367847412
7565685,5,B0199ITMVG,"One of the finest video game shows on YouTube, and my personal favourite, comes to Blu-ray! Joe and Dave are a couple of decent, genuine guys providing highly informative and humorous insight to a topic they're extremely passionate and knowledgable about. Game Sack is created with a standard of quality and production value that meets or exceeds most TV shows and, for me at least, is endlessly re-watchable.
The Blu-ray itself is very well put together. The video quality, menus, special features, and even the disc and box are all top-notch. The production value absolutely matches that of the show it contains; Id expect nothing less from Game Sack. An excellent first release, and I look forward to many more.",1452124800,2,714,4.958333333333333

7565687,5,B0199ITMVG,"This is obviously a specialty item so it isn't intended to appeal to everyone. However, if you are a gamer or a former gamer and you love games from the 16 and 32 bit era you will really enjoy this series.  This disc would make an excellent gift for any classic gamer.  The later episodes have a much higher production value but the early episodes have their own unique charm.  If you watch this show on YouTube you should buy this disc to encourage them to keep producing more episodes and to release additional volumes.  Even if you have seen the episodes before there's lots of extra bonus materials.  This is very well done.",1451520000,7,628,4.473684210526316

But it's what comes out of their sack that really matters!  And with this blu ray, you can see it all in High Def and even more MEGA POWER!  It's loaded with so much extra content, you'll wonder how it was ever stored in their sack. Best show on YouTube and now the best show to ever be out on Blu-ray!",1451347200,5,472,4.01063829787234

7565691,5,B0199ITMVG,"It's easy to drown in the sea of mediocrity that is YouTube retro game review shows, but Game Sack offers safe travels on that sea in the form of a 45 deck luxury cruise ship. By far this is in the top 5 of game review shows on the internet, but don't let ""internet"" scare you. This is a TV quality show the like of what you would see on G4...right after COPS.

My only complaint is that that despite the show being TV quality it can be said that their faces don't meet those same standards. Yes they are ugly...and you be better on the radio, but then you couldn't see the awesome game footage. I guess i can live with mongoloids on my TV for a short time. I also heard that Joe is horrible in bed but I'm not sure why anyone who plays 30 year old video games would care about sex anyway so I guess it doesn't matter.

If you are a fan of retro games you can't go wrong with Game Sack unless you only watch pretty people.

that said, I found this DVD and all it's extra content to be an extreme joy, there is an extra ""random battle"" something I love because they compare games that aren't usually comparable. and it often makes me smile the length they'll go to try to make their game sound better.  also there is a lot of stuff on here, as a fan, I desire to know, like episode commentary. plus, if you play your cards right you get to watch Dave commit suicide because he couldn't handle Joe being a punk to him. (no hate towards Dave, but seeing that made me laugh). I still haven't managed to see all the extra and bonus stuff on the disk. but I do intend on watching it.

I was always against buying ""youtube to DVD/blueray"" video's but this felt worth it with all it's extra content.  If they released a volume 2, I know I'd buy it.",1473552000,2,891,4.162790697674419
