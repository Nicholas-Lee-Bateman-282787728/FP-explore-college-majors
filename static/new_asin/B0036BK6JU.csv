Dr. Bell one of Doyles medical school professors approached his sttudents with ""look for the clues the patient or cadaver is giving you they are there just open.your mind and find them.
This series ,Murder rooms (5 stories) involves Dr. Bell with his student asst. young Mr. Doyle mef studeng. Like the Sherlock Holmes stories , we all share in the solving of a crime.or crimes given what appears to be little information. In the beginning Mr. Doyle is skeptical of Dr. Bells methods. He is involved primarily as.a professors asst. not because he truly sees value in his mentors.methods but he is his asst.
However, as the series progresses ,the student sees value in these new METHODS OF.OBSERVATION.
Ian Richardson is wonderful as an unconventional Dr. asked to solve the impossible with his young colleague . Mr. Doyle slowly becomes.convincef.in this.new.methods of.deductions in battling the.unseen .
Unlike the Sherlock Holmes stories they do not share a flat ,seem inseparable and Dr. Bell does not have the same peculiarities such as cocaine addiction. There is.a frienship that eventually exists between the two. It is.based on a mutual respect for each other which  would normally exist between friends and not idol worship.
The.cases.in which they become involved are challenging and keep the watcher (thats you) guessing through the episode. I gound this series extremely entertaining and can not understand why there was only five episodes made.
In reality the relationship btween Dr. Bell and student Doyle remained in the classroom. It.was the basis for the Holmes /Watson stories which have given me great pleasure over the years as did this series.

8389852,4,B0036BK6JU,"This collection of all five in the series is marred only by the fact that there are Swedish subtitles (or we could choose Finnish, Norwegian, etc.!!!) that we can NOT get rid of.  Thank goodness the actual dialogue is in English and after a while you mentally ignore the subtitles --- or for someone it might be a great way to learn a language!  Or, if you like to do puzzles, handcrafts or something else while ""watching"" and actually just mostly listen,then this is the edition for you.  Too bad there does not seem to another edition offered that has the original pilot and the other four episodes as this one does since the shows are outstanding.  The acting is wonderful, the sets are realistic and the whole directing/ambiance is excellent. We wish there were more in the series. And without subtitles in any language!",1362614400,2,824,4.662068965517242
