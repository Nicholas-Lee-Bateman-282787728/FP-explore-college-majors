5740852,5,B00CU6WBB8,"I love this series! I just wish the light novel would come to America. The basics of the story is this. It is a perverted comedy about a teenage boy named Isse who thinks only about girls and sex, but girls hate him and his friends because of his perverted personality. one day a beautiful girl confesses to him a makes his dream of having a girlfriend come true. after their date she kills him with a light spear and that is how the story starts out(with his death) A female devil named Rias Gremory resurrects him into her devil servant and he finds out his now ex-girlfriend is a fallen angel that was ordered to kill him because he has a power that could rival god and the devil. thus a roller coaster ride of extreme laughter, nudity, and action from ""Hell""(pun intended) is born. This anime is just the first two books of the seires, and later this summer the second season is coming out in Japan which will be the next two books in the series.(there are currently 15 volumes in the novels) The story gets funnier and funnier as it continues. If you like comedies and don't mind nudity and sexual themes this is a must buy for anime fans.",1371600000,14,1144,4.350467289719626

5740917,2,B00CU6WBB8,"This is an incredibly boring anime.  Lots of double Ds and fan service does not save it.  Plot is ridiculous and rather smells of satanic propaganda (fallen angels don't fight demons, they are demons).  Even fan service feels kind of forced with an obligate jiggles that are out of place and look unnatural and obligate panty shots at sports events and pretty much elsewhere again added seemingly just to fill in time in otherwise senseless plot development.  The plot development also feels more like a video game with the ""power up"" upgrades of the main male character (fortunately not his male parts).  Two stars instead of one so not to disappoint fan service lovers, but there are better series out there.",1518393600,,710,4.8347107438016526

5740940,5,B00CU6WBB8,Man. Not gana sit here and say this dose anything original per say. Its a harem  anime lots of fan service and comedy ensues. all that said this was still refreshing in a few spots. One the fact that the main character had a spine and could fight but dose not always just auto win. Two. That its so blunt on what it is. I recall a very epic anime fight with well done animation over one character wanting to see one of the women's boobs and the other denying him. theres no veil here and its a bit refreshing so take that for what you will.,1504051200,,540,4.046728971962617

5740943,5,B00CU6WBB8,"Otaku John here to review High School DXD the Series.  Okay, as a well-experienced connoisseur of anime, manga, and light novels, going back from the 70's to modern day, I have read and watched just about every series out there at one time or another.  I can honestly say that for the genre it covers, this is a great anime.  First and foremost this is a fan-service comedy.  It's low-brow, and not intended to be taken seriously, or to compete with dramatic classics like Akira or Ghost In The Shell.  This is just a zany, funny, slapstick show meant for people to sit down and watch to escape the harsh realities of a mundane over-serious world.  That being said, this is definitely for adults.  Lots of nudity, language and more adult situations than you can count.  But that's the whole point, isn't it?  Too bad the High School DxD Light Novels aren't available in the U.S. currently.  Because the plotline and story is actually quite good.  Animation is 5-star, characters are excellent, voice actors are top-notch, and you can't help but binge-watch it as soon as you put it on.  Many people don't like this series, because they think it's too low-brow.  But if you're a guy, and you're honest with yourself, you can't help but accept the fact that just about every guy goes thru a phase where they're a lot like the main character Issei Hyoudo,( in their own minds, if nothing else).  If you like light-hearted comedy, and love to laugh, then get this.  You won't be disappointed.  Again, its made for adults, not kids.  Think of it like an 80's R-Rated comedy film, akin to Porky's or Revenge of the Nerds.  It's not a Francis Ford Coppola masterpiece of directing excellence, but it sure as heck is A-1 Entertaining.  I also highly recommend getting the High School DxD light novels, if you ever get the chance.  They're a great read.  Also, don't forget, there's two more seasons of DxD available right now too, and another in the works in Japan currently.",1503532800,8,1967,4.643478260869565

5741005,5,B00CU6WBB8,"- Synopsis: A war between Heaven and Hell takes place on Earth. The main character ends up getting killed and reviving as a devil. He's a simple-minded guy who just wants his own harem. Fortunately, he joins up with other devils that for the most part, treat him with open arms. Despite his perversion, our hero is a kind-hearted guy who cares deeply for those around him. From the moment he revives as a devil, his life changes for better or worst. This anime showcases Issei and his friends' struggle against other inhabitants of Heaven, Hell, and Earth.

===========================================================================================================

- Analysis: This anime manages to make a relatively creepy but interesting concept fairly light-hearted and humorous. That is, devils, demons, and the like. While the common assumption that devils are evil is quite known, this anime shows that generalizations aren't always accurate. Even devils are capable of kindness. Furthermore, any faction is capable of good and evil, regardless of who they may be. History would serve as a good example of this.

The main character Issei is also a very relatable guy. He's simple-minded and perverted. He isn't a tactician or strategist like some other characters may be. But like many fundamentally weak characters, he has a unyielding spirit to fight with everything he has and to never give up. A trait that may be respectable to some, while annoying to others.

- Features: English and Japanese audio, as well as English subtitles. Includes 12 episodes on 2 Blu-rays and 12 on 2 DVDs with a run-time of about 5 hours. Rated TV-MA for violence, language, and sexual content.

- Conclusion: Reminder that this anime is fan-service-heavy, uncensored, and will show plenty of boobs. Keep this in mind if fan-service isn't for you. However, it isn't just a simplistic anime, either. There's plenty of humor, perversion, and dark themes that are relevant to the physical world as we perceive it.

===========================================================================================================

5741013,4,B00CU6WBB8,"I am sad to admit that I am a bit of a harem-anime fan. I enjoy the situations the authors come up with to test the characters and often it makes for a lot of fun. I also lean towards the ecchi forms of anime. I like and have been keeping up with Monster Musume by Okayado and also was a bit of a fan of Rosario+Vampire. So enough about me. The latter show got a bit tedious (mostly same format every show) and the former is ok but has changed a bit (gotten calmer I think.) DxD falls right in between them for me. The different monsters in MM make it fun,  season 1 DxD really doesn't have near the spread of comedy that MM can have with it's additional species.

The first couple of shows in DxD are old hat - pervert (normal red-blooded American), pretty and voluptuous girl, angelic-type beings. BUT after the introduction of Ashiya, things start to move personally and some interesting plot points come into play. In general, it plays out as you think it will, but there is some fun along the way. They focus a bit too much on Rias* and her WAY too big boobs, but I really like the character growth of Hyodo Issei; using your own strong points in balance with your weaknesses, not striving to get rid of them.

As I've said on other shows, is it top rated AAA tv? Nope. Is it mostly fun and sometimes very interesting? Yes. I'm sure there are lots better shows, but I enjoyed this one and will be ordering other season(s) of it. If you like boobs, lingerie, male fantasies and a few surprises, I bet you will like this. This really is an introduction to the characters and settings, there's apparently lots more to come.",1474848000,5,1625,4.303921568627451

5741087,4,B00CU6WBB8,"First, Let me say that this is NOT a children's anime. That being said, Fan Service, Nudity, and teenage high school boy locker room humor abound in this series. However, If you can look past the childish/immature nature of the dialog and the bounding breasts, this is a really good anime. It is funny (in a South Park kind of way), endearing, and dark at the same time. The idea that the protagonists are actually Devils may not sit well with those who have high moral standards, but then I doubt those people would watch this in the first place. The character development and action/ fight sequence is slow at first, but it picks up. The pace quickens even more through Season 2 and 3, however Season 3 is only available in the edited Japanese version as of yet.

All in all, I enjoyed this anime. It was interesting to watch the relationships of the characters grow, as they learn to accept not only themselves but the other members of the house as well, and for better or worse, this Anime really is about family protecting family. Like I said, get past the immature nature of the humor and you may see the truth of the story itself, which was well written, thoughtful, and just a lot of fun to watch. I would rate it five stars, but--- The over the top sexualization did get overwhelming at times.",1453334400,,1302,4.470588235294118
5741088,3,B00CU6WBB8,The first season of Highschool DxD was okay 69.2/100 but I think both Highschool DxD New and Highschool DxD Born is better 100/100 like with To Love Ru series To Love Ru:Darknees is 100 percent better then To Love Ru 67/100 and Motto To Love Ru some where between 61/100 and 67.1/100 does anyone agrees?,1452470400,,303,4.527272727272727

5741110,5,B00CU6WBB8,"This review will consist of 2 things: What the product contains and What I think of the product.
First off this product is the 1st Season of ""High School DxD""
Second The product looks exactly how it does in the picture, it is basic blu ray casing with a slip cover.
Next This Product features a total of 4 discs. 2 of which are the blu rays and the other 2 are the dvd versions.
The 1st disc contains episodes 1-7 and the 2nd contains 8-12 as well as the extras.
This product comes with an English Dub as well as the original Japanese with English Subs.

This anime series was really great! If your looking for a Action/Comedy story about a guy with a harem of demon hotties this is a great choice for you! Also if you like a little bit of ecchi and romance in your anime, this definitely will be good for you as well! Keep in mind that there is nudity in this series.
This product overall is great I love this show and having a physical copy is the best.",1438819200,23,955,4.134408602150538
5741111,5,B00CU6WBB8,"OK, If you can look past the Fan Service, this is a great anime. But at least the fan service has a point in this show. As Issei Hyodo embraces his inner pervert he gains strength from it. I couldn't stop laughing.",1438732800,2,214,4.119047619047619
5741112,5,B00CU6WBB8,"A much more convoluted story line than I expected from reading the box and other reviews. This boxset covers the beginings and completes the main plot by the end. Yes, there are some racy scenes, but I have seen far worse in other titles.",1438128000,,238,4.431818181818182

5741121,3,B00CU6WBB8,"If you are looking for an anime to get started on, then don't get into High School DXD. It proves conclusively that the quality of anime is actually worsening over the years. This is especially true with the quality of each new season. The voice actors get replaced for the same characters and instead of tasteful, appropriate censorship, they start to use the logo of the series in High School DXD BorN (season 3). In addition, High School DXD is more focused on the proverbial TNA and so, it is not so much something that I'd put a child, let alone a teenager in front of. If you want good harem-themed anime, find something such as the Tenchi animes. But for the good of everything, DON'T buy this. You can do better with the money that you have and are willing to spend on blu-ray.",1431129600,,785,4.4206896551724135

But it still is an ecchi anime with a bit more nudity than most other ecchi animes out there.

5741288,5,B00CU6WBB8,"High School DxD is a great anime series for those who want to see magic, angels, and devils. This show i would not recommend to an audience younger than 17 years old due to the breast exposure that is all over the place. This is a very Ecchi Anime meaning it has a lot, i mean a lot, of boobs haha. When I received the package I looked and saw no damage whatsoever to the casing nor the discs within. I aim to add this to my collection of anime but the boobs are a little much throughout the show but the story line is very well made. It's the classic Devils Vs. Angels with a twist of a third party, the Fallen Angels. For those who enjoy Devils and Angels, this is definitely up your alley.",1411776000,2,692,4.0583941605839415

5741385,5,B00CU6WBB8,"High School DXD is, without a doubt, one of most popular anime right now and for good reasons! The storyline, humor, action, animation, music and dialogue is all blended together; which is guaranteed to satisfy any nerd.

I have heard a lot of criticism about this anime, which I'm sure you've all heard as well. Honestly, I don't know what these critics were expecting. This anime is about sexy demons killing fallen angels in the battle between good and evil. This is what we called ""Entertainment."" If you were looking for something different, like ""What's the meaning of life?;"" then you definitely should stay away from this anime.

Regardless, this anime is a must-buy for all fans of anime, especially if you like anime such as Sekirei, Queen's Blade and Sora No Otoshimono. The action is great, the humor is hilarious, the characters all have some development, and there are even some heart-felt moments where you're motivated to do the same as the characters. The music is AWESOME and the extras making the purchase well worth it.

Funimation did a great job dubbing this series. Personally, I like the subbed version better, only because I feel like I can take it more seriously than listening to some cheesy dialogue. Still, it's worth watching at least once.

Now, High School DXD New (Second season) was released in Japan in October 2013. Knowing this, we probably won't be seeing an American release until the beginning of 2015. However, I know it will be worth the wait.

Please support by purchasing this Blu-Ray/DVD combo, it's well worth it!

It seemed to combine all the bad elements of this type of anime: a completely unlikeable ""hero,"" female characters so pneumatic they look deformed, and a plot so farfetched that the viewer is in danger of brain-lock.

But when the character Asia is introduced, it begins to change for the better. Suddenly the hero has something to think about that doesn't reside in his pants, and the viewer has something to look at that doesn't resemble a cart full of watermelons. The storyline itself gets much more interesting once there are characters one gives a damn about.

I had hopes for the series at this point, but alas, they are dashed by the weak ending. Nothing is resolved, and even if there is a second season, will anyone bother to watch?",1391731200,,829,4.63265306122449

But in the end he finds that underneath all that perversion there is actually a brave and noble warrior inside of him.... and a massive dragon's claw.

This is one of the few animes that I enjoyed subbed and dubbed. I enjoyed the story more in subbed but the English dubbed jokes were hilarious.

5741434,5,B00CU6WBB8,"I first came across this series after discussing what fansubs (that is to say, un-licensed anime that is not professionally translated) my friends would be getting for the winter 2012 lineup, this title came to mind. the last time i had downloaded ANYTHING resembling fanservice was Queen's Blade in 2008, and that series was so heavy in the fan-service i felt i needed a hot shower to clean the muck off of myself. so when i heard that this was a pretty 'servicey' show, i had my doubts.
after downloading episode one though, i was shocked. yes, there was nudity. yes the character was an incorrigible lech, what amazed me is that they actually MADE THE PREMISE WORK. Issei was unashamed of his unbridled libido and his desire to see women's boobs. even as his girlfriend is MURDERING him, all he can think of is that her breasts were wasted since he only got to see them for a few seconds. Usually, if im being stabbed to death by a loved one, i would tend to surmise that breasts would be the least of my worried. That he is once again hunted by another fallen angel, bringing the whole 'cavalry' running was a sidestep, but when he wakes up naked next to a just-as-naked Rias Gremory, the most sought after campus idol, and doesnt totally recollect how he got there - okay, Awkward....
but instead, we have female characters who are in control of their sexuality. hell, instead of pummeling poor Issei like most decent harem shows, Rias tells him to look as much as he wants to. admitted, he is shocked by it, and doesnt resist much or even make much of a statement as she dresses in lingerie that would probably make a Victoria's secret model say 'daaaaaayum'
as the series progresses we get even more fan-service, in the first instance is a nameless rogue devil the cast has to eliminate, in which we meet the rest of the cast (Yuto, the Knight; Koneko, the Rook; and Akeno; the Queen to Rias' King) in which once again, breasts become the primary focus of Issei leading to comical results.
which is the amazing thing about this, as a fan-service show: it actually makes the fan-service part of the plot, and NOT just something to titilate the viewer:
case in point: the whole reason Rias is naked is that she can heal Issei's would totally with skin-to-skin contact, which is a staple gag about couples stranded in icy environments having to share body heat.
we see that the nudity is not just fun and games with the rogue devil for, despite her rather beautiful human appearance, she's actually a centauresque creature who has a human torso from the hips up along the waist of the monster, despite her beauty, its meant as a distraction as her own powers make her quite lethal to a normal person.
and as the series progresses, Issei's own desires (to be master of his own harem) are actually encouraged by Rias but it becomes soon apparent that having a harem like that will be an uphill battle due to his lowly status (that of the pawn) but can be 'promoted' for working hard.
the girls of the series are all about taking charge and easily match their male counterparts, though Issei is truly king of the libido in the series. even many of his eventual 'special' moves are based on rendering his target naked (which leads to many gags about its name 'dress breaker')
the fan-service continues on to season 2 (which just wrapped up a season or two ago in japan) and still appears to have room for a third season as well.",1390003200,,3428,4.539579967689822

5741443,4,B00CU6WBB8,"the harem genera is usually flooded with shows every season of anime, but sometimes one comes along that just has this certain spark to it that makes it stand out, and High School DxD is definitely one of those shows.

Animation/Visuals:
In this department, DxD doesn't do too much to stand out, but its definitely serviceable and the fan service is well animated and shot. Speaking of fan service, this show has a lot of fan service and at times it may be too much for some people, but if your use to harem shows it'll be no big deal. Also if your wondering, this is the uncut release, so there is nudity and lots of it. Overall it gets  the job done and looks nice for the most part. 8/10

Music:
Musically, it also doesn't try to do too much to stand out, but the music for the most part is very good, and the background music you will be hearing a lot of the time is repeated, but not overly so and you won't be wanting to gouge your ears out when you hear that same piano piece for the 5 billionth time. The opening and closing songs are both very catchy and nice, and the release also comes with text less versions of both. Overall, the music is good, but similarly to the animation, it doesn't do much to stand out . 8/10

Voice Acting:
Japanese cast wise, its great as it almost always is, with the stand out for me being Shizuka Ito as Akeno, who delivers her lines gracefully but with a perfect hint of sly seduction that just fits so well and made me love the character. Dub wise, its pretty good as well, but there are a couple hiccups. Sometimes the dialogue can be translated weird and causes what the character said to be different than what it actually is. Also, while I love Jamie Marchi, she just doesn't fit Rias very well as she just has a very different way of speaking and just doesn't fit the tone of her voice like at all. Definitely the best part of the dub is Ian Siclair as Issei who is funny, perverted, and voices him with such passion and i just love listening to it. The rest of the cast is good, so it definitely comes down to personal preference. 7.75/10

Story:
As much as I've been bashing the rest of the series for being kind of eh, surprisingly the best part of the series is the story, which has some really interesting mythos and fun characters. The comedy in this show is really funny, and i laughed at pretty much all the jokes in the entire series. I say the mythos are interesting because they do go quite deep and involved as well as the villains are interesting and well written. Also, the character development is also well done, fleshing out a few of the main characters and just being well done in general. That being said, a lot of the story elements done in DxD have been used before, but they're used so well here i don't really mind all that much. Also, if i haven't mentioned this enough already, this show has a lot of fan service, like, a lot, i'm pretty you see at least 2 pairs of naked boobs per episode a lot. However, considering the main character is a dirty pervert, i don't mind very much and think the nudity fits well with the story as much as the actual story. The story here is actually quite good, and its definitely way better than it has any need to be. 9/10

FINAL THOUGHTS
While for the most part it doesn't do too much to stand out, the story and the characters are well done and surprisingly is one of the best aspects of the show. Coupled with the fact that there is plenty of nudity and naked boobs, if your a harem fan or just an anime fan in general, this is a good show that's definitely worth your time and money.

FINAL SCORE: 8.25/10",1388016000,,3616,4.254730713245997

There's no reasoning or logic for it, the hero is a creep which a guy in real life in his situation would be in prison. A real anime fan would avoid this. I picked this up because I thought it would be like a harem-parody like Blue Exorcist or Disgaea. If your going gaga over this you obviously have no morals and are a pervert.",1388016000,3,409,4.061728395061729
5741455,5,B00CU6WBB8,"While I may not have bought this on Amazon.com I did buy it on Funimation.com recently and thought Id write a review on Amazon anyway.

In a world where righteous angels, deranged fallen angels and beautiful devils wage an ongoing war a perverted high school loser dies shortly after getting a girlfriend only to be reborn a devils pawn enough said!

Some may not be able to look past the fan service, but those that do will discover an awesome story with great characters and a very unique take on combat! The animation, characters, story and English dub are great which is why this is one of my favorite animes!

Be warned that the series is not suitable for children due to all the fan service and if you're unfamiliar with the term then let me explain. Fan service means there are a lot of large jiggling breasts, revealing clothing, panty exposing character animations, poses and camera angles as well as brief nudity and strongly suggestive themes.",1387843200,13,954,4.700598802395209

over all the show have my to watch recommendation, and when season two is license, watch that too, hopefully we get more season, cause the best are yet to come, if u think that final battle was good, wait til issei actually get his power, power by ero-turbo.",1387411200,2,1945,4.223719676549865

The action is well paced and animated and the last three episodes really do grip you. I was sitting on the edge of my seat waiting to see what happened.
This top grade A anime to be put in the same class as Rosario and Vampire and Ikki Tousen. (Sekirei and Heaven's lost property being the B-team).

When they have their first date, it also ends up being their last as she grows wings and stabs him with a spear of light.  As he dies, a vision in red hair and a big chest arrives and tells him she is her master.  The next day, he wakes up naked with her in his bed.  Later he learns that she and her friends (the school Lolita, the busty upperclassman, and the most popular boy in school) are all devils (and you would rather deal with a devil over a demon.  Devils make a pact and honor it, demons just want to play with your insides - even if you do not want them to.) and so is he and the one who tried to kill him was a Fallen Angel.  He will learn that he has a special power but can he learn to harness it to protect him, his friends and possibly one he cares about.

Despite the high Ecchi level, there is a story under all the adult themes.  Issei is actually not a bad person, despite his perverse behavior, he is willing to help those who needs it.  From his follow devils, to a lovely former nun he will follow his heart more than his hormones.

5741513,2,B00CU6WBB8,"Well lets start off with this, I bought the one that says Blu-ray+dvd combo pack thinking it was going to be an actual box containing two seperate dvd holders, but boy was I wrong. Plus the quality I received mine in is so FREAKING TERRIBLE. I did not pay 50+ bucks to get a case that looks like it has been sat on by 80 people. And when I opened it, the dvds were scrambled and had a couple of scratches. DO NOT buy the dvd combo pack. Buy the other one. >:( This is my favorite anime too.... The only reason I'm actually even giving this 2 stars is because the anime is amazing.",1377302400,3,580,4.052173913043478
5741514,5,B00CU6WBB8,"This is not the DxD covering the screen at every hint of ""naughty bits"" version. Coming from Funimation...I half expected it to be censored. This will likely sell primarily because it's a boob show. (Yes, the scenes don't just have nudity--the nudity is the scene.) However, beyond that, there is a very solid story with great characters and strong story telling. The jokes are funny, even the second--and third time around, while the story is short enough that it doesn't drag anywhere.

Hint: it's sort of like the Porky's series...nudity, sexual jokes, peep holes...

This product is both DVD and Blu-ray, although the product description is Blu-ray. Unfortunately, the extras are not dubbed--but I guess you can't have it all...",1376092800,159,732,5.091666666666667

8586351,4,B00CU6WBB8,"This show has a lot of fans and is one of the best in its genre and while I don't like everything about it, I do love the characters except the main female rias (who most of the fans like strangely enough). The show in my opinion has an average or slightly above average story and the combat is silly and not really appealing. The show excels in two areas
- character development
- ecchi /  harem / fan service
the show also is somewhat unique focusing on demons, angles and fallen angels which is kinda rare in anime and the fact that the show has this and is good is even rarer.
This is an easy decision to buy for yourself or as a gift, an anime doesnt get this many seasons by not being good ( especially when in this genre. If you've watched anime long you'll know that most anime end after the first season even the good ones.)",1522972800,,833,4.1419753086419755
