It's theraputic to watch these four friends as they flounder through their personal and professional lives.  Find yourself and others in them and learn to laugh about the world we live in.  Also check co-creator Larry David whom Seinfeld himslef credits as being ""90% of the show.""  Enjoy!",1094342400,8,416,4.9855072463768115

Kramer's obsession with Kenny Rogers chicken, Jerry's fear of germs, Elaine's ""SHUT UP"", George's lust for Marisa Tomei, his neurotic parents, The Soup Nazi....I could go on and on.",1092614400,4,466,4.406976744186046

Unlike other great tv dvds (ie. the Simpsons, Family Guy), the producer of this dvd took his time to create a dvd worth of the greatest show of all time.  Looking at the features in the dvd descriptions, i see that it is jammed with compelling extras.  I will, and sugest that any other person, pre-order season 1-3, and maybe even extras for christmas presents.

2120344,3,B0002UE1WQ,"The reason I went the route of buying the individual seasons was partially because of the reviews about the packaging of the DVDs in the lower priced box set. The other reason was because I already had volume 1 (seasons 1 & 2). The cost of buying the remaining volumes was only a few dollars more than buying the box set. There is another more recent box set which includes the coffee table book but it is hundreds of dollars more.  I could see spurging if it was blue ray but as far as I could tell there was no HD version available.

Anyway, I did not realize until after the DVDs arrived that there are two packaging options for each individual volume. The first is a cardboard box set which contains 4 individual thin plastic DVDs cases. The box is about an inch and a half thick so it takes up a bit more space than the second option. The second is about the size of a normal dvd case and has a plastic swivel which holds all 4 DVDs. I don't recall selecting either option when I ordered it but I ended up with the second option.  I would have been fine with this as these take up less space than the box set version. However, the plastic swivel is cheaply made and was broken at the hinge. I was able to tape it in place to prevent the DVDs from sliding around in the case.  I am likely going to rip these onto my NAS drive so I am not too concerned with the packaging anyway.  If I had known about the options I would have gone for the box set version as they seem more durable.",1442534400,2,1485,4.106896551724138

These packaged seasons are dirt cheap, and handy to have when you aren't ready for sleep, but don't want to invest three hours in a movie.

 We really are enjoying the extras, like interviews about the shows development and history, and comentaries from the stars. I had no idea these situations were built from real events in Jerry's and Larry David's lives. I learned lots of stuff I didn't knowso Seinfeld videos are actually cultural history, right?.

If you liked the show (and I loved it), you may have missed an episode here and there so now you can see them all and go back to the good old days of real funny TV. A show about nothing - Only a Genius like Jerry Seinfeld and Larry David could pull this off on network TV without a single cuss word. Classic material and a simply incredible cast make this a must see again and again and again.

2120429,5,B0002UE1WQ,"There's nothing dated about this classic sitcom, which defined the late '80s and early '90s TV comedy as Jerry and his buddies traipsed through New York life and its various little adventures.

As the creators promised, Seinfeld is indeed largely ""a show about nothing."" That said, it's often the little daily annoyances, ups and downs that make for the most entertaining stories in our own lives, and it certainly held true for Jerry, Elaine, George and Kramer.

Particularly memorable episodes include ""The Note,"" when George obsesses over a possible ""reaction"" to a massage from a male masseuse; the two-part ""The Boyfriend,"" when both Jerry and Elaine compete over the attentions of a baseball player they have recently met and become infatuated with (real-life Mets player Keith Hernandez, playing himself); and ""The Pen,"" when Elaine and Jerry visit Jerry's parents in Florida, causing Elaine to wrench her back on a very uncomfortable sofa bed and overdose on muscle relaxants just before attending an event at the Seinfelds' condo association (this was the only episode of the series run in which both George and Kramer did not appear).

2120432,5,B0002UE1WQ,"Like many other reviewers/fans, I believe that the third season of Seinfeld was definitely a head above the first and second seasons. Of course, there some great shows in those two seasons, but Season 3 is really the time when the show defined itself and started to perfect its elements. They found their comfort zone for plots, jokes and even some experimentation, such as an episode taking place outside the usual realm of location (""The Parking Garage"", ""The Subway"" and ""The Limo"" all come to mind).

Some of my all-time favorite Seinfeld episode are from this season. I loved ""The Parking Garage"" because it was able to take such a minimalistic idea and make an entire episode out of it. ""The Pen"" builds up to a hilarious climax where Elaine gets high off painkillers and Jerry's eyes get discolored from diving, forcing him to awkwardly wear sunglasses to a party. Then of course, the first time I saw ""The Limo"", I was truly taken by surprise and absolutely had to know how it ended, and what an ending!

There were also some episodes that took unusual elements and made them strangely charming. One example is in ""The Dog"" where Jerry has to watch a dog while his braindead drunkard owner (who's very funny during his onscreen time!), is at a hospital halfway across the country. ""The Subway"" is able to construct and execute four totally different plots, one for each of the characters, until all is brought to a head in the Restaurant at the end.

Overall, this collection brings together some of the greatest and most interesting Seinfeld episodes in the show's run. Add to the four discs all the extra features, and this is a purchase worth every last cent. Buy it and spend countless hours enjoying it!

Season 3 has many classic Seinfeld episodes and deserves the  same attention that the more popular and latter seasons often conjure.

2120439,2,B0002UE1WQ,"Let me be the innocent child in ""The Emperor's New Clothes,"" and proclaim:

Jerry Seinfeld is not funny!

Oh, I know what you're thinking: Here's  a guy who thinks Seinfeld was unfunny, but his cast was hilarious.

No. At best the rest of the cast was mildly amusing (although Jason Alexander is a talented actor, he is not necessarily hilarious, hence the two stars).

Because, when it comes down to brass tacks, ""Seinfeld"" *was* a ""show about nothing"" -- in every sense of the word:

The contrived semi-plots, with choppy one-liner segments.

The cloying, annoying, ejaculatory bass riffs between shots.

Jerry Seinfeld posing as this hipster: Yeah, right, a hipster with a ridiculous bushy mullet.  At best, Seinfeld was an Upper West Side Jewish version of Jeff Foxworthy.  You want to know why people think Jewish men are smug, metrosexual wimpish know-it-alls?  I submit Jerry Seinfeld as ""Exhibit A.""  If a WASP played a Jew such as Seinfeld, he'd be accused of bigoted racial slurs against the Jewish people. Grating, like fingernails down a chalkboard.

Oh, and speaking of freakish hair-do's:  Is there anyone alive who thinks that Michael Richards as Kramer would even inspire a single chuckle if shorn of that ridiculous Brillo-pad hair?  Within three episodes, he'd have been out of the door, after having been reduced to haranguing black hecklers in the studio audience:  He's a [n-word]! He's a [n-word]!

Pathetic.

And, ""Elaine""?

Puleeze! She makes Gwyneth Paltrow look like Kate Winslet, she is so flat.

2120444,5,B0002UE1WQ,"After two somewhat experimental seasons, Seinfeld really began hitting its stride in this third season. It's really a tribute to the talent that was in front of and behind the cameras on this show that they tweaked the formula for two seasons until near perfect comedy and chemistry was achieved.

In ""The Library"" we see how the writers make everything come full circle in this show. One of the best one-episode characters in Seinfeld's history, the Library Detective is an hilariously stubborn old fashioned man who confronts Jerry about a missing book from 1971 that was never returned. Jerry goes to see his girlfriend at the time to see if he returned the book, only to find that he had not. Meanwhile, Kramer meets a pretty librarian and George sees his brown toothed underwear pulling gym teacher, who now is a bum living under the steps of the NYC Public Library. The old man hasn't changed much, and he gives George yet another wedgie.  Also, the library book turned out not to be just a red herring, as it turns out the homeless gym teacher has hung onto it all these years.

""The Red Dot"" is a hilarious example of how George cannot just leave well enough alone - he always has to push everything to its limits. Elaine gets the long out-of-work George a job at the publishing company for which she works. Everything would be back on track for George, but he just can't resist having sex in the office with the cleaning lady. The cleaning lady takes the encounter more seriously than George does, and George is afraid she'll tell his boss of the encounter and get him fired. He decides to give her a gift, a cashmere sweater that has been deeply discounted because of a tiny red dot on it that is supposedly too small to see yet each of its recipients spot it almost immediately, including the cleaning lady. She informs on George, and he is out of work once again.

The season finale, ""The Keys"", sets up the Emmy winning fourth season. Kramer has been abusing his house priveleges in Jerry's apartment too much, so Jerry revokes his spare key privileges. Realizing that he has broken the ""covenant of the keys"" gives Kramer the realization he is now free to break out of his routine. Kramer takes off for California to follow his dream of becoming an actor. Jerry gave his spare keys to Elaine, then when he needs them, he goes with George to Elaine's to search for his spare set, since George has Elaine's spare keys. What they find is Elaine's show-biz project, an episode of Murphy Brown that she has written. Elaine finds the two going through her stuff and in turn revokes George's spare key priveleges. Kramer finds adventure as he journeys across the country to LA where he gets a bit part on Murphy Brown playing her secretary. The next season picks up on the gang trying to locate Kramer in California.

I highly recommend this season as the first season of Seinfeld where everything seems to be clicking both storywise and character-wise. It's not a show where you need any background from previous seasons, since, after all, it is ""a show about nothing"". However, I found it helpful to view the first two seasons first to see how everything came together.",1167523200,3,3178,4.627659574468085
2120445,5,B0002UE1WQ,"A third season for a sitcom makes it still a young show. However, by Season 3, Seinfeld and his friends are delivering one-liners and dealing with normally dull situations that will leave you with tears in your eyes and tummy-ache from laughing so hard. Who else but Seinfeld can make a joke out losing your car in a parking garage, being arrested for urinating in public, and a dying goldfish?!",1166572800,,395,4.6571428571428575
2120446,5,B0002UE1WQ,"Riding on the momentum of the last few episodes of the previous season, Seinfeld - Season 3 would be the first of several seasons where nearly every episode was top notch, many of which would become classics. The writing, much of which was based on things that really happened to the writers, improved tremendously as did the rapport among the cast. This led to a small but dedicated cult following which would increase during the season. Momentum had built as such that two of Season 4's episodes would debut the following summer rather than in the traditional fall season.

Disc 1 is very strong as both ""The Library"" and ""The Pen"" would become early classics while ""The Note"" and ""The Truth"" were also very good. Every episode of Disc 2 is top notch with the episodes ""The Parking Garage"", ""The Caf"", ""The Tape"", and ""The Alternate Side"" reaching classic status with the last debuting one of the show's many catchphrases, in this case ""These pretzels are making me thirsty!"" Disc 3 is just as great with the best episodes being ""The Red Dot"", ""The Pez Dispenser"", and ""The Boyfriend"", the series' first two-part episode, which features former baseball great Keith Hernandez as well as a hilarious segment involving a spitting incident between Hernandez, Kramer, and Newman in the guise of the movie, JFK. Disc 4 is awesome as well with the best episodes being ""The Fix Up"", ""The Limo"", and ""The Parking Space."" Even lesser known episodes during the season such as ""The Dog"", ""The Nose Job"", and ""The Subway"" are very funny. As with all of the DVD's released in the Seinfeld series, the coup de grace are the special features which feature bloopers, deleted scenes, inside looks, and exclusive stand-up material. Also included is a must see 22-minute documentary on the Kramer character and the highly recommended Notes About Nothing which are chock full of information.  Also worth noting is there's less emphasis on Jerry's stand-up routine as the writing team was running on all cylinders. Despite the struggling ratings when these shows originally aired, Season 3 would be the season where Seinfeld came of age and would lead to its phenomenon status.

2120448,5,B0002UE1WQ,"If you're a T.V. Seinfeld fan you will absolutely love the DVD's.  The scenes that are cut to insert commercials by syndicators are restored on the high quality DVD versions.  I grew up in the United States and had always liked the series from television.  I was married while living/working/studying in China in 2002 and bought the DVD's for my wife on our coming to the United States in 2005.  She had never seen Seinfeld before and had never been exposed to this style of humor or the slice of American life that the series presents.  We have watched the DVD's over and over again and they never fail to make us laugh and lift our spirits when we've had a bad day.  We utilize the closed captioning option and it has been a great help for my wife in acquiring an understanding of casual English usage including slang, and idiom.  On a more serious note, owning so many seasons and watching the episodes regularly makes you realize the sad truth that much of American life really is focused on the themes of myopic self-interest presented and ridiculed in this series. I sometimes worry that individuals may actually see the series as a validation of their lack of ethics, morals, and connection with the Creator instead of as a revelation and jabbing at today's inappropriate social dynamics; just as the Archie Bunker/All In the Family series did in the 1970's.
The DVD sets include great special features from ""How It Began"" to ""Making a Seinfeld Episode"", deleted scenes, behind the scenes commentary from cast and creators, never-before-seen standup footage of Jerry, original NBC promotional ads and trailers, outtakes and bloopers, and much, much more.  It's obvious that a lot of thought and work went into producing the DVD sets and I can't wait until the remaining seasons come out for sale at Amazon.  After all; ""Who wouldn't love Jerry?""
Episodes included in this set are:
Season 3 - The Note, The Truth, The Dog, The Library, The Pen, The Parking Garage, The Caf, The Tape, The Nose Job, The Alternate Side, The Red Dot, The Suicide, The Subway, The Pez Dispenser, The Boyfriend, The Fix-up, The Limo, The Good Samaritan, The Letter, The Parking Space, The Keys.",1150502400,10,2178,4.755968169761273
2120449,5,B0002UE1WQ,"Whilst we had to wait until the next season (4) for Seinfeld to win an Emmy Season three gave us some classic episodes which should have been at least nominated, such as The Parking Garage, The Limo, The Subway and The Parking Space to name but four.

This DVD set contains all 22 episodes of season 3 as well as the standard features which are on all other season sets, ie Yada, Yada, Yada Comentaries, In the Vault Deleted Scenes, Notes About Nothing and Inside Looks Brief Interviews.  Again we the viewers learn interesting stuff from these features such as Jason Alexander explaining during Inside Look of The Pen how he threatened to quit after George being left out of the episode. Whilst there was a lot of great information I was a bit disappointed with the commentary on The Parking Garage as it was just a couple of directors on an ego trip telling us what a great job they did, how the garage looks real and stuff like this. Surely Jerry or someone could have joined them to make it more entertaining.  Also included on Season 3 is Kramer vs Kramer where we meet Larry David's inspiration for Kramer his old neighbour Kenny Kramer.

Personally I am a big fan of Jerry's stand up so I love being able to watch EXTRA stand up and of course you get the commentary which is great because you get to hear what some of the gang thought about each episode but the best feature on this episode in my opinion is Kramer vs. Kramer: From Kenny to Cosmo which is about Kenny Kramer, the Kramer that Cosmo is based on and it's interesting and great yada, yada, yada.",1124323200,,808,4.219354838709678

2120463,5,B0002UE1WQ,"Although Seinfeld found massive popularity in its later years, it always had a contingent of naysayers who derided the show as being about nothing. Let's not even mention that most TV shows are about nothing and don't have the guts to admit it, but Seinfeld inevitably caught the mood of the times, containing the requisite amounts of jaded cynicism and irony that the 1990s embodied. Seinfeld was a show that probably wouldn't be made today, with networks looking more at bottom line than inspiration, but, in a rare instance of network foresight and courage, NBC stood by the show and watched it become the biggest show ever, surpassing even its ""older brother"", Cheers. It's too bad NBC didn't learn from their successes, to which their current fourth place status can attest.

The third season was pivotal. Although the show's ratings weren't exactly smashing in the previous two seasons, NBC decided that the show needed more room to grow. This season produced some seminal episodes, like ""The Library Cop"", ""The Pen"" and especially ""The Parking Garage"", which laid down the show's look and feel. By ""The Keys"", the season's final episode, Seinfeld the show had evolved into what we all remember it as: clever, wacky, and oddly insightful into modern-day life.

Sony really went to town with these DVD sets. Tons of deleted scenes, documentaries, commentaries (voice and text), etc. There's enough material here for even the biggest Seinfeld devotee to learn more. It's a great value, and you know you want it anyway.",1118188800,3,1522,5.011857707509882

Along with the episodes are a bevy of extras including cast commentaries, bloopers, deleted scenes, notes about nothing, NBC promos (""Sponsored by Vandelay Industries""), and other treats.

Season three marks the beginning of the solidification of the characters into the eccentrics we now know and love. The show really hit its stride after two seasons of prelude, and it is hard to imagine a funnier DVD set than this one. The mark of really good comedy for me is the ability to watch it repeatedly and still find it as funny as the first time I saw it: this set passes that test, and I highly recommend it.",1116547200,8,811,4.671328671328672

The show follows the life of comedian Jerry Seinfeld and the exploits of his ""short, quirky, bald guy"" best friend, George Costanza (Jason Alexander), Jerry's neurotic neighbor Cosmo Kramer (Michael Richards), and Jerry's ex-girlfriend Elaine (Julia Louis-Dreyfus). Through the years, they're joined by loveable cast of characters that includes Newman, Uncle Leo, the Soup Nazi, Frank and Estelle Costanza, the Bubble Boy, and countless others.

2120468,5,B0002UE1WQ,I was quite impressed with all the extra bonus material included in the DVD. I like how you can watch a favorite episode just to see it again and then go into the bonus behind-the-episode stuff and really get to see everything about that episode and what it was like to film it. The behind the scenes stuff was almost as hilarious as the show. I really think this DVD was worth every penny and its a great one to have on the DVD shelf.,1110326400,3,435,4.129411764705883
2120469,4,B0002UE1WQ,"My Gosh!! The extras here are so extense, well crafted, sincere... and there are LOTS of them. The extras here put the ""lack of extras"" on the FRIENDS DVD sets to shame!

The episodes need no mention. After all, this is one of the greatest sitcoms ever. We have THE PARKING GARAGE and THE PEN, to mention a few outstanding shows.",1109808000,4,329,4.39344262295082
2120470,5,B0002UE1WQ,"The Third Season of Seinfeld is superb. It was the season that led to the show being a huge success and eventually deemed the greatest sitcom of all time.

The success of the season is built upon the outstanding story lines as the season immediately leaps into a highly comical story of George being massaged by a man.

Another strong point of the season is the fact that actor Michael Richards finally unleashed into a new phase of the character of Kramer, playing the role more intelligently and incorporating many outrageous sequences of body movements for effect. In fact, each actor branches out even more in this season, especially Jerry Seinfeld who begins to learn more about acting and expresses more emotions in each episode. Each character can be found in the whackiest of situations and the hilarity of them will have you laughing non-stop.

The special features also have a large role in this DVD, taking up the majority of it. They are all fabulous as we often get an ""Inside Look"" at the episode with brilliant commentary from Larry David, Larry Charles, and other writers. And of course we also hear from Michael Richards, Jerry Seinfeld, Jason Alexander and Julia Louis Dreyfus. One of the features is a look at Kramer's character which is a thrill to watch. Another highlight to the extras is the unseen stand up footage from Jerry Seinfeld.

The quality of the episodes is nothing short of spectacular as well. There lies not one weak show in the collection of 22, with the highlights coming from episodes like:

The Pen: The only episode in which Jason Alexander sits out in,  it features Jerry and Elaine visiting Jerry's parents at a Resort  for the elderly.

The Tape: Jerry discovers a sexy message left on his tape recorder by none other than Elaine and George becomes attracted to her because of it.

The Boyfriend: One of the most famous in the Seinfeld episodes featuring baseball star Keith Hernandez. It relates to the delicate issue of the Kennedy Assassination.

The Cafe: Jerry feels obliged to enter a restaurant in fear of the man working there losing his business. This episode introduces us to the beloved character, Babu.

Overall, there are no weak episodes and you'll watch them over and over again. This DVD is an absolute must for any Seinfeld fan so please buy it you appreciate the humour of this wonderful sitcom.",1108944000,5,2358,4.783251231527093

Volumes 4 & 5 (Seasons 5 & 6) - Xmas 2005

Volume 6 (Season 7) - June 2006

Volumes 7 & 8 (Seasons 8 & 9) - Xmas 2006

2120472,5,B0002UE1WQ,"These are absolutely terrific episodes, but you already knew that, right?  Okay, so let me tell you a little about how they're organized in this DVD collection.  What's really great is that each episode (well, most of them, anyway) are followed by a one-to-five minute ""Inside Look"" bonus feature, each of which is essentially a short ""making of""/behind-the-scenes piece that discusses the themes of the episode in question and how they were developed.  It's really fun getting a little dose of that sort of thing while the episode is still fresh in your mind.  And, of course, there are lots of other extras on the final disc.  A particular favorite was a nice sampling of extended Seinfeld stand-up routines, using lots of material that didn't make it into the stand-up segments used in the episodes.  I'm betting that other TV collections on DVD will emulate the excellent presentation of episodes and extras seen on these ""Seinfeld"" DVDs.  Kudos to all involved for putting together such a great product, especially since everybody must have known they'd still make a fortune even if they just sat back and released bare-bones DVDs of these TV classics.  Thanks again... and bring on Season Four!",1108425600,2,1200,4.965
2120473,5,B0002UE1WQ,"Season Three is when I believe that ""Seinfeld"" really broke completely out of the mold of traditional TV sitcom.  The tone of these episodes is often chockfull of utter misanthropy, sarcasm, and the kinds of mean observations/impulses that we all have but seldom articulate or act on.  Also, while a few episodes in Season Two had the often-bizarre intersections of each characters' storylines by the end, every show in the third season abounds with multi-layered trajectories and train-wreck coincidences.  Finally, the shows on Season Three feature many of the catch-phrases and images that made the show famous--""These pretzels are making me thirsty!"", the Pez dispenser, etc.

Like the first DVD set, there are lots of great extras that go far beyond the norm.  The commentaries are hilarious and definitely worth watching.",1108252800,3,827,5.282442748091603

Not this set though. My one single complaint about the set: I wished they would have printed the DVD disc number on the spine of the DVD Case.

Fans of this series, which defined an entire generation and beyond, are breathing a collective sigh of relief that the actors finally got it together and ironed out the bumps to make this DVD release happen.  Perfect timing before the holidays!

The writing in this show was ingenious.  Jerry and Larry had their entire hands on the pulse of New York City and its inhabitants.  From major to minor details, you will find subtle and sometimes outrageous tidbits of life in every show.  It's facinating to watch how each episode winds up smoothly connecting each separate story, scene for scene, which unfolds in one laugh after another.  This was no ordinary sitcom.  For anyone who didn't watch this in the '90''s, now is the time to grab ahold of a classic comedy masterpiece.

Season 1 & 2 are great, but this set, Season 3, is a MUST HAVE, containing memorable classics like The Pez Dispenser, The Boyfriend, The Keys, and The Pen.  The extras are fabulously fun to watch, you'll laugh just as hard if not harder at the outtakes and bloopers.  The crisp, clean quality of each episode makes our old VHS copies horrible in comparison.  For years we suffered through shows in syndication, trying desperately to complete each season with minimal commericial interruption...but alas, our reward -- this is the gift to give yourself, the Faithful Fan, who now can sit back, put your feet up, and enjoy hours of non-stop entertainment, Seinfeld style!",1102464000,9,1482,4.719844357976654
2120484,5,B0002UE1WQ,"Season three is where the actors in ""Seinfeld"" finally find their voices and start having fun. The bloopers in the bonus section are hysterical -- I laughed more than during the shows, which is saying a lot. And those outtakes last almost as long as a show, just over 15 minutes! While I had seen most of these episodes in reruns, it was interesting to finally see them in order and get some of the nods to previous shows that I missed by watching them at random on television. Of note, Newman makes his first appearance in this season. Also, I found it fun to watch how Elaine used everything from roomy clothing to the sofa cushion in Jerry's apartment to hide her ever-growing pregnancy in the last dozen episodes -- especially since she was much more successful in diverting attention away from her belly than Carrie in ""Sex in the City.""",1102377600,5,842,4.546052631578948

2120486,4,B0002UE1WQ,"The third season of Seinfeld is when some of the really great stories came out, making this set a must have for fans of the show.  Of course, I loved Seinfeld over its entire run, watching the premiere when it first aired and then watching the series till it ended, so I may be a bit biased in favor of it.  The episodes are presented in the order they were filmed rather than the order they aired, which actually makes the continuity better for this set.  The special features are only so-so, and I did not bother to look for hidden bits like the first set had, so there might be more to see.

As with the first set, there is for each episode a brief making-of retrospective with various cast and crew sharing their recollections.  It is interesting to watch, and the different people giving commentary keeps it from seeming too repetitive.  I like the Notes About Nothing, which gives subtitles of minutiae, like Girlfriend and Boyfriend Counters for the cast, Kramer Entrance Counter, things like that.

The best part of this set, like the first set, is the outtakes.  While I did not actually time it, I believe that there are more outtakes in this set than in the first set.  I watched it three times before moving on, as I laughed so hard at them.  Some were already shown on other discs with the pertinent episode's short documentary, but they are still hilarious.

The behind-the-scenes stuff is OK, if a bit dry and somewhat padded in length by clips from the shows themselves.  The audio commentaries that can be run are pretty disappointing.  There are none with all four cast members, which would have rocked, but some have three (all but Seinfeld), likely due to the money issues that delayed this set so long in the first place.  I only listened to a couple, with Kramer, George, and Elaine speaking, as that was the closest to the cast as was available.  Not bad, but for 22 minute shows it seems clear to me that they did not put that much time and effort into it.  I also would have loved all four cast members together for one of the interviews, but maybe that can happen on a later set.

All in all, I am happy with the purchase, even if the features are not so great, mainly because I love the show and can now watch whichever episodes I like whenever I want.  And I am eagerly awaiting the rest of the series, as the later seasons just got better and better.",1101945600,21,2379,4.429885057471265
2120487,5,B0002UE1WQ,"While there were some select excellent episodes during the first two seasons of Seinfeld, I've always thought Season three was when the show really hit its stride and found its comfort zone where it would  remain for the next six years.

This season really defined the whole irreverance of the show and the pure ridiculous idiosyncracies of the characters.  Among the great episodes of season three:

""The pen""  Jerry visits his parents in florida and Jack Klompus gives Jerry the famous Astronaut pen that writes upside down.

""The Library"" The library asks Jerry about a book he checked out in 1971 and never returned, so Jerry looks up an old girlfriend for his defense against a library cop.  Phillip Baker Hall is priceless as the Libray Cop Bookman.

""The Subway""  Everyone has an uncommon experience while going their separate ways on the subway. George meets a beautiful woman who distracts him from his intended destination, a job interview. Jerry falls asleep and then wakes up across from a fat naked man and winds up discussing with him, the New York Mets & Coney Island.

""The Pez Dispenser"" Kramer joins the ""Polar Bear Club."" Jerry gets one of Kramer's Pez dispensers which makes Elaine laugh during a piano recital of George's girlfriend, and that puts their relationship in jeopardy.

""The Boyfriend Parts 1 & 2""  Jerry meets Keith Hernandez and wants to make a good impression. Meanwhile, George is out of time on his unemployment and he works harder than ever on his scheme to get a 13 week extension. He tells the unemployment office he was really close on Vandelay Industries, a company that makes latex products and whose main office is Jerry's apartment. Kramer and Newman hate Hernandez back to a time when they were allegedly spit on by him; however, Jerry supports the ""second-spitter theory.""  The First of Many legnedary Episodes.

Jerry Seinfeld, Larry David, and the other writers really stepped up to the plate and produced some superb scripts.  As interpreted by the wildly talented quartet of Seinfeld, Jason Alexander, Michael Richards, and Julia Louis-Dreyfuss, they deserve to be ranked among the most classic television comedies.  ""The Parking Garage"" and ""The Subway"" really stand out as prime examples of this show's philosophy of being about nothing, but every episode is a gem.  I've seen these shows many times and they never fail to make me laugh.  It's a pleasure to own such clear copies with so many great extras.

I say amen to that and quite honestly reckon that what we witnessed on our TV screens for what now seems like 9 very short seasons was a sort of pure, ""whipped up out there somewhere in the stars"" kind of entertainment genius that TV in it's current apocalyptic preoccupation with reality dribble and cookie cutter sit-coms may sadly never capture again.  But thank the almighty we can now unleash this comedic lightning in a bottle whenever we need a crack like fix of ""nothing"" by just dropping a DVD into a tray, dimming the lights and pretending it's Thursday night in 1991 all over again.  You know honestly I'm a bit suspicious as to the motives of people who would waste their time writing a review about something they obviously don't get and know very little about, I know ""nothing"" and subtlety are hard concepts to grasp sometimes but if you let yourself go and quit waiting for someone to lead you to the ""one-liners"" to drink you might just appreciate the fact that Jerry Seinfeld and Larry David figured that the audience was smart enough to get ""it"" without ""it"" being shoved down their collective throats.  They understood that the laughs and loyalty they would earn by not dumbing the whole process down by resorting to pathetic ratings period tricks like offering viewers ""an emotional Seinfeld we'd never forget"" or having Elaine and George get married in the season finale' to find out next season it was all just some twisted dream sequence would be much more rewarding in the end.  I guess it's sort of like when they say you should never talk about politics or religion at a dinner party, I think I'll ad Seinfeld to that list, bottom line is, if people don't get it, they never will so why argue the facts?  It's just a dirty shame they find themselves prisoners of such a bleak humorless little rock of a planet.  Now as far as the DVD goes, even without the fantastic extra's (which go to 11) it's Seinfeld on DVD... `nough said!  Heck I would have been satisfied if they'd released it dubbed in Bulgarian and had packaged the whole thing in smelly old mildew ravaged newspaper!  And that thing about smart people having a sense of humor... I guess the fact that I love this DVD and can't get enough Seinfeld makes me a freaking genius, a genius that can't spell mind you, but a genius that knows how to laugh!",1101600000,12,2436,4.530751708428246
2120490,5,B0002UE1WQ,"This DVD was absolutely brilliant. The combined acting of Jerry Seinfeld, Jason Alexander, and Michael Richards rivaled that of all  the greatest actors of all time. The entire series is a genuine masterpiece greater even than the Mona Lisa of da Vinci and the Cistine Chapel of Michelangelo. It was so delightful, there is no word in any language genuinely superb enough to describe it, so I am forced to make one up. And I shall do so right now... This DVD was absolutely scrumptrelescent!",1101600000,2,491,4.776470588235294
2120491,5,B0002UE1WQ,"It was the best of times, it was the worst of times: Seinfeld difused all discontent.

""Nothing Wrong With That,"" outakes are uproarious.  Although I've seen more of the show through reruns, a fuzzy memory was indeed revived by this smash-hit show, and now DVD, one of watching this classic sitcom on a warm, fresh spring day, just around dinner time way back in 95. (More idyllic times in general worldwide).  The true allure of the show, with all it's admirers and adherents countrywide (world over for that matter), in all liklihood can never be fully conceived by those of latter generations.  However, keeping the memory of the show alive will prove invaluable.  Seinfeld was not only full of wise-cracks, quick lines, and unique gesticulations, it also shared the common bond of character evolution w/ most other succesful network shows.  The prize awaiting fans in these first three seasons is a less refined ensemble, something that is interesting to view when one knows in the back of their mind how big the cast became over the course of the '90s.  If there were to be an aspect of the show that I enjoyed thoroughly, it would of course have to be their wonderful humor and, in retrospect, how well the whole crew depicts relationships.  Some may say the show got too big, and people became somewhat obsessed with its more surreal side (i.e. nutty premises and ""Kramers"" antics), but I have to disagree.  The show was great because it captured the best of fantasy and reality; something I notice also in a lot of British productions.  It has its manic moments, silly situations, and emotional realizations, all completing a compendium on every-day life.  To avoid further praise, the show is a classic because it shows how great life can be if it is lived with a little less gravity, a tad more enthusiastically, but always with the respect for genuine personality and freedom of expression.  A real delight and suprise was the ""Kramer vs. Kramer"" extra.  Michael Richards is so eloquent and insightful, drawing further recognition to his abilities.  In closing, thank you Sony and Seinfeld crew members for the DVD release.  Please throw in a ton of extras in future episode releases.",1101600000,11,2195,4.847184986595174
2120492,5,B0002UE1WQ,"First off, I am a huge Seinfeld fan, I have over 300 collectible items from the show including a piece of stage from the Marv Griffen set, and the original numbers off of Jerrys apartment, I have over 150 autographs from the cast and crew, so from all of this you can tell that I am a fan. I purchased the entire Series off of ebay some time ago only to be most disappointed with the quality and the commercials which were included!!!

Today I picked up the seasons 1,2,3 and am most satisfied with the quality but most of all I absolutely all of the bonus footage, the interviews are absolutely great, and any Seinfeld fan knows that there simply just are not enough of these interviews, however most of all I love the bloopers that are included, they're absolutely HILARIOUS!!! and very rare indeed. Of course you can not go wrong with the episodes that are digitally remastered and sound wonderful. The season 1-2 set included the very rare Pilot episode titled""The Seinfeld Chronicles"" which I personally have only had the pleasure to see one other time from the set I purchased from ebay.

This is a sure buy for any Seinfeld fan whether large or small. I truly can not say enough about these two sets. I have a very large DVD collection with over 350 DVDs and over 500 recorded DVDs(I have a DVD Burner). I can honestly say that Seinfeld Seasons 1-3 are in my top 5 DVDs, and were worth absolutely every singly penny and more!

Go out and buy these 2 sets, you will thank me later. Get them for Christmas, or Hannakuh or any other way possible, JUST GET THEM however you may. Trust me it is worth all the wait and hype. Best collection to date in my opinion.

Thank you Columbia Tri-Star for releasing these You have saved my Seinfeld collection and I can finally resell my ebay purchased Set. I simply do not need it anymore since these are finally being legally released.

Buy These 2 Sets, You will cherish every singly moment!",1101427200,7,1936,4.4576271186440675
2120493,5,B0002UE1WQ,"""Seinfeld"" continues to be sponge worthy in this great DVD boxed set of the third season.  The third season consists of 22 episodes. All the episodes are the uncut original episodes that aired on NBC (most of the episodes in syndication are usually trimmed by a minute or two). The boxed set has a slipover case. Inside the inside slipcase each disc is nicely housed in individual slim DVD holders. Season Three has 9 commentary tracks (if I'm counting correctly)featuring Jerry and Larry David, Michael Richards, Julia Louis-Dreyfus and Jason Alexander on a trio of episodes and writer Larry Charles & Director/Producer Tom Cherone on the remainder. Deleted scenes, unused stand up bits, promos and a sly featurette on the real Karmer make this a generous set particulary when compared to the bare bones releases for other similar (although not as funny) series.

Overall, the high definition transfer look very sharp.  The good news is that even though the show was videotaped, the quality of the picture and sound for most of those analog episodes continues to look great. The blacks are solid for a videotaped program and the colors are as real and true as they appeared over a decade ago. Sound is also quite good on this set. Clearly, Columbia took a lot of care in transferring the show. Considering they could have just dumped it on the market with only the episodes and no extras and commentaries, I'm a happy camper.

For a show about nothing this boxed set spends plenty of time and space talking about the something special that made this an outstanding show. We get 9 commentary tracks from Jerry, Larry David, writer Larry Charles and Jason, Julia and Michael the other part of the fab four. All in all, it's a generous boxed set filled to the brim with extras.

""Kramer vs. Kramer"" allows the real life inspiration for Cosmo Kramer to comment on his fictional counterpart. Kenny Kramer comes across as wacky and weird as Cosmo but a little scarier in that he occupies real space. We also get outtakes, bloopers (watch Jerry and the cast screw everything up and make the screw ups almost as funny as the scripts) and deleted scenes from episodes that ran a little but too long. ""Master of His Domain"" features the stand up material that introduced much of the third season that was shot but never featured in the show. You can well imagine which episodes they were intended for and guess pretty accurately without seeing any info on the subject. ""Sponsored by Vandelay Industries"" features the funny promo ads and trailers that NBC ran to promote the show. ""Inside Looks"" provides a glimpse behind-the-scenes as to what was really happening when various episodes were shot. There's also some discussion about improve on the set, what inspired the various episodes and the chemistry that the ensemble cast had together. We also have the chance to see trivia about the various episodes but, more importantly, two slightly different versions of the pilot episode that play a bit different as well. It's like entering the Bizarro Universe from Superman at times.

There's also cool production notes about the making of each episode that appear at the bottom of the screen. If you can multi-task you might appreciate the trivia and other info imparted about each episode. ""Seinfeld"" is, indeed, sponge worthy.",1101254400,13,3318,4.874113475177305

The original pilot episode was slow, and seasons 1 & 2 have some weak episodes, but Seinfeld truly begins to shine in season three.
