8509177,5,B00739YNR2,"The story effectively transports the viewer to Korea's Joseon Dynasty (16th century) and is a partly fictionalized account of the life of Dae Jang Geum, the first female physician to be assigned to care for the King.  This historic drama unfolds through a beautifully written storyline, extremely talented actors, breathless scenery, and perfectly researched costumes and sets. Our young heroine enters the palace at age 8 as a palace maid assigned to the royal kitchens, and through her abilities, wisdom, honesty and perseverance overcomes incredible odds to be appointed royal physician to the King.  Our orphaned heroine manages this feat in spite of the male dominated hierarchy and inflexible class structure.  Warning!  The romance, humor, politics and palace intrigue may be detrimental to your manicures and sleep schedule.  I know of cases where individuals have even skipped going to work due to the addictive properties of this program.  Be sure to keep a box of tissues nearby.  Also, you may be pleasantly surprised by the wonderful Korean cuisine presented throughout.

The quality of the DVD's is very good and the colors are beautiful.  The English subtitles may be objectionable to some language purists due to occasional grammar, vocabulary and spelling errors.  However, individuals who can appreciate an outstanding story and can overlook these (in my opinion) minor errors, will likely enjoy this series.",1378425600,,1426,5.354260089686099

Jang Geum overcame impossible odds that would have made most anyone else quit, but she continued to persevere determined to fulfill her mother's dying request.  This story takes place during the Chosun Dynasty about 500 years ago. Korea had a rigidly hierarchical class and male dominated social structure. This is based on a true story about the first woman to be the supreme royal physician of her time.

But she didn't set out to become a royal physician.  She wanted to work in the kitchen.  You will learn also about food and how it affects your system, and what foods can be used to treat what conditions.  You will get hungry watching this show!  I also had to know how to cook some of those foods, so after the show I purchased ""Royal Cuisine : Jewel in the Palace.""  This is a 4 volume set that taught how to cook these dishes.

The subtitles are accurate.  The acting is superb!  The music is outstanding! (yes, I bought the soundtrack, even though I don't speak Korean)  The story is moving and heartfelt; it will make you laugh, cry, cheer, and fall in love!",1369094400,,1217,4.452488687782806
8509179,5,B00739YNR2,"Jewel in The Palace is a very good Korean Historical Drama about the life of a woman who after many trials eventually became the first woman to be admitted as a royal physician to the King.  I recommend this drama to anyone who enjoys historical dramas and learning about other cultures.  The English translations are good.
I found that I had to clean the DVD's for them to play smoothly in my DVD player.  I was experiencing problem spots in playback.  After I cleaned them they worked perfectly.",1368748800,,497,4.613636363636363
