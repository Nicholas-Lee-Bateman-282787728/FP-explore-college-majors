8620704,3,B00G4REWMU,"This is a great movie that I've watched several times and the only movie I've ever purchased as a gift more than once. This time I purchased it as a gift for a friend who lives in Australia.  Unfortunately, my friend told me it will not work in DVD players outside of Region 1. I'm not sure what countries Region 1 consists of, so I suggest you ask the seller if purchasing it for use outside of the USA. The movie plays ok but the sound volume is muffled and makes watching it useless.",1473897600,,486,4.170212765957447
8620705,5,B00G4REWMU,"This is one of those ""based on a true story"" films that you wouldn't believe was real. The film involves a courtroom drama as a group of individuals are brought up on various mob charges. Each one has his own lawyer, which made the courtroom full. Jackie DiNorscio (Vin Diesel_ opts to defend himself to the dismay of everyone. He starts out as a buffoon against a confident prosecutor,  but as the trial drags on for over 600 days, Jackie becomes polished and the prosecutor unravels.

And of course with Vin Diesel, it's all about family (Fast and Furious mantra).",1435881600,3,566,4.65
