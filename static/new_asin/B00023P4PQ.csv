2060376,5,B00023P4PQ,This was an excellent movie for me.  I was able to relate and identify with various situations depicted in the movie.,1360886400,,117,4.571428571428571
2060377,5,B00023P4PQ,"Funniest and stark movie ever made about the joys and pains of aging, in a changing society and world.

Only Walter Matthau and Ossie Davis could have pulled off credibly, with drama, danger and humor, better than it was on the Broadway Stage.

It is about oui futures and presents, even the past.

Where do we come from?  What and who are we?
Where are we going?",1321574400,,363,4.373134328358209
2060378,5,B00023P4PQ,"What a lovely way for two superb actors to top off long, distinguished careers.  These talented veterans carry the whole movie, and its unlikey plot turns, on their backs like Atlas supporting an unwieldy world.

The DVD has no extras.  I can ony hope the producers saved all the out-takes and break-ups that MUST have occured during the making of this movie.

There are actually THREE stars of this movie.  Central Park is the unbilled third star.  I've never seen it looking more beautiful.

I will watch movie over and over.",1309824000,2,527,4.725274725274725
2060379,5,B00023P4PQ,"This movie is a laid back, relaxing movie. It's amazing that two elderly men can have such fun and have an interesting time.",1259798400,2,124,4.434782608695652
2060380,5,B00023P4PQ,"Nat Moyer(Walter Matthau)is a compulsive talker, philosopher, and troublemaker who pretends he is someone else. His daily companion on a bench in Central Park is Midge Carter(Ossie Davis)who is a halfblind superintendent in an apartment house;  Midge's view of life is realistic and down-to-earth as opposed to Nat's assuption of alternate personalities.  These two old men, in true vaudevillian fashion, take on the world and its threats - drug dealers,muggers,forced retirement, and worst of all, the spectre of the old folk's home. You will enjoy their repartie.",1239408000,3,565,5.482758620689655
2060381,1,B00023P4PQ,"I cannot review this movie that was ordered on 2/9/07, but still has not shipped as of today, 3/12/07. The 1-star rating is based on not having the movie to review.",1173657600,,164,4.32258064516129
2060382,5,B00023P4PQ,"This is a very good movie, one that you can watch many times and still feel good about it. The story is both funny and at times sad. Actors Matthau and Davis are brilliant in thier roles as two seniors holding thier own.",1156118400,6,220,4.1395348837209305
2060383,5,B00023P4PQ,"This film is about weaving tales and marking passages, unlikely friendships, courage in the face of age and frailty and the ordinary, common defeats just being alive entails. It's about truths which, although not strictly true, ought to be, about some of the frustrating faces of love and obligation and about savoring life even when it's becoming increasingly difficult to cope with.

Octogenarians Walter Matthau and Ossie Davis team up to face a variety of problems ranging from cataracts and glaucoma, brittle bones, poverty and growing dependence, to a Central Park thug, a smarmy ""communications"" agent assigned to oust Davis from his job and his home and finally, a thoroughly nasty drug dealer who threatens a young girl's life. It's a weird sort of feel-good film because nothing really works out exactly as planned and yet, one is left with the notion that all is basically well (if slightly goofy).

Very much worth the purchase. I'll be watching this over and over.",1461024000,,977,5.0246913580246915

2060392,5,B00023P4PQ,Classic! Love both of these actors. The story starts a little slow because its trying to give you a background to the Matthau character and why he is the way he is.,1426032000,,164,4.15625

2060395,1,B00023P4PQ,"My partner and I were expecting a good movie, since we like both Walter Matthau and Ossie Davis.  After about 30 minutes, we gave up.  Normally, we like thoughtful, social issues films; but this one just wasn't clicking for us.

2060397,4,B00023P4PQ,This movie explores some of the fears and frustrations of growing old with wit and beauty!

2060399,5,B00023P4PQ,The Matthau-Davis teaming was a stroke of genius. These two consummate actors  masters of their craft - turn character study into a search for gold and they find it.,1398124800,,165,4.689655172413793
2060400,5,B00023P4PQ,Walter Matthau and Ossie Davis are as good of a match as Matthau and Lemmon. I could watch this movie everyday.,1391212800,,111,4.333333333333333

8021592,2,B00023P4PQ,"Matthau and Davis are terrific, but a comedy ?  I think not, very depressing look at aging with no happy endings for anybody.  Video is fine, but the audio is very weak, had to turn the volume way up.",1502064000,,200,4.102564102564102
