4992604,1,B006J2QG3I,The movie was very slow and boring.  It was a terrible waste of time.  The plot needed a lot more to it.,1389052800,3,104,3.6818181818181817
4992605,4,B006J2QG3I,"I didn't really watch it, but my 2 1/2 year old (who loves cars) watched it quietly while I did some work.  Worth at least 4 starts for letting me finish a project!",1386201600,,164,3.9696969696969697
4992606,5,B006J2QG3I,"My son  & I loved this cars movie!  Very cute movie
I thought it had good lessons and  great animation too.",1385942400,,107,4.0
4992607,3,B006J2QG3I,"It was okay, entertained the child on my Kindle for a short time.  I don't think I would purchase it but used my Amazon Prime.",1385596800,,126,4.04
4992608,1,B006J2QG3I,The dad yells all the time.  Pretty evil and disrespectful dialogue throughout.  Just bad....Sorry my child found this one but it looked so similar to the Pixar Cars movies.,1385424000,3,173,4.931034482758621
4992609,5,B006J2QG3I,This is so cute! I don't know why it got such bad reviews. Why anyone would think this is part of the Disney Cars franchise is absolutely ridiculous. Its certainly a cheaper knock off but still really cute. My 2 1/2 year old loved it and he's a HUGE fan of Disney Cars. He wanted to watch it again when it was over. I've never seen the first one but this was free to stream so we gave it a shot.,1385251200,,395,3.888888888888889
4992610,1,B006J2QG3I,"This movie was so bad I am at a loss for words.

Lacks education.
Attempts to teach morals.
Dialog is very fake and boring.
My 2 year old and 5 year old watched it for about 5 minutes before begging for something different.  They watched iMax educational videos longer.",1384819200,4,269,4.469387755102041
4992611,1,B006J2QG3I,"What is going on with this movie? The animation was quite deficient and the voices were both angry and creepy. That Sparky deserved to have his tires slashed for the way he spoke to his father. Also, where were Lightning McQueen and Mator? Incredibly misleading...",1384041600,3,264,4.888888888888889
4992612,3,B006J2QG3I,"My 2 year old grandson will not sit down and watch this movie.
It's not comparable to Cars or Cars 2.",1373414400,3,101,3.857142857142857
4992613,5,B006J2QG3I,This move is super cute and was very affordable.  What boy doesn't love cars and he is so cute an relatable to little ones. I also have car's life one and would recommend it to anyone as well.,1362787200,2,192,4.052631578947368

4992617,5,B006J2QG3I,Taking cars are the best thing ever,1408060800,,35,4.142857142857143
4992618,1,B006J2QG3I,"I don't know how, in the pantheon of movies, this could possibly rate any higher.  Even compared to other ""cheap"" animated films this would not rate more than one star.  Poor animation, poor voice acting, no imagination whatsoever.  Somebody's rich uncle must have put up the money to get this produced.  Really, don't waste your time.",1405987200,2,335,4.928571428571429
4992619,2,B006J2QG3I,"I'm only giving this two stars because my three year old liked it. However, the animation was really low quality, the voices for the cars were annoying as anything, and the story was so weird. This was just awful to sit through, and I say that as someone who does not usually dislike children's tv/movies.",1405036800,2,305,4.5636363636363635
4992620,2,B006J2QG3I,"We sat down hoping to enjoy a movie with our 4 year old, and instead turned it off. All it was teaching him to do was talk back to his parents, and that parents are harsh towards their kids. Very slow moving plot line.",1402790400,4,218,3.977272727272727
4992621,1,B006J2QG3I,"Voice acting was horrible. Animation was bad, but not as terrible as the first one. Story was mediocre. Nothing like the movie CARS. A pure rip off the movie. Full of not funny car puns. Don't charge money for the third one.",1402531200,2,224,4.357142857142857
4992622,1,B006J2QG3I,"Horrible movie! Our 2 year old son who likes almost any cartoon, 5 min into the movie was asking to watch something else. This is a horrible movie, even free not worth the effort put into loading it.",1402531200,2,199,4.2631578947368425
4992623,5,B006J2QG3I,"My 3 year old grandson watches this over and over again, cute movie. I would recommend this movie to any child who is into cars.",1402099200,,128,4.16
4992624,1,B006J2QG3I,Sparky is the most annoying and bratty character. Even worse than Caillou. I can't stand to listen to this show when my daughter watches it.,1401840000,3,140,4.64
4992625,1,B006J2QG3I,"Boring story, boring animation.  I couldn't watch more than 5 minutes before my brain started to die off.  I think it actually made me dumber.",1400457600,2,142,4.64
4992626,1,B006J2QG3I,"Not reading the content and thinking this would be similar to Pixar's Cars, this movie is a bit of lack-luster entertaining.  My son loves anything cars / trains related and being that Pixar is not under PRIME this was the only thing available and my son just watches because it's cars but after 15-20 minutes he looses interests and I lost it after 10.  The storyline is BORING and the animation could be better along with the character voices which is almost as annoying as Caillou.

Save your time.  Not worth it.",1399852800,3,516,4.576086956521739
4992627,1,B006J2QG3I,I turned off in 10 minutes. Too much bickering and yelling. No need for young kids to watch a cartoon so angry.,1398902400,2,111,4.090909090909091
4992628,5,B006J2QG3I,"I fully understood before I even watched this that this was NOT the pixar movie.  my 17 month old son has a fascination with cars and he is LOVING THIS. so far we have watched it three times and he is not bored with it.  I am not even bored with this.
if you, as a grown up, are expecting a full feature film with plot twists and turns then this is not for you.  if you are a parent a young child that can not fully understand major story lines and are looking for something with cars, then this is for you. it was a cute film with lots of bold colors and a nice simple story line.",1398556800,,581,3.865546218487395
4992629,3,B006J2QG3I,"I wasn't impressed. I actually turned it off after 15/20 minutes. Sassy little cars, back talking and disobeying their Dad. Not the kind of example I want for my son!",1398470400,,166,4.566666666666666
4992630,5,B006J2QG3I,"I needed a lighthearted movie, and this one fit the bill.  It was funny, cute and had some meaning to it.  Enjoyed it.",1393545600,,118,4.086956521739131
4992631,1,B006J2QG3I,"My son loves cars so I thought I would turn this on as a prime instant video. But the father car is always complaining and not constructively dealing with issues. The child car is always misbehaving and setting a bad example for his younger sibling. If they spent more time showing helpful guidance, that would be great. But as it is, I think it shows my son bad examples on how to behave. I'll find something else for him to watch.",1390867200,6,432,4.345679012345679
4992632,1,B006J2QG3I,"not age appropriate, not funny.  don't waste your time watching it.  this tarnishes the brand and should never have been released.",1390176000,3,130,5.142857142857143
4992633,1,B006J2QG3I,Sorry but this isn't Cars. Wanted to watch Cars with my son on Prime thought maybe this could be a good substitute of it was just a whiney nonsensical mess. Couldn't get past the first five minutes.,1389398400,3,198,4.378378378378378

8499141,5,B006J2QG3I,Saw this one before we saw the Cars movie. My son is almost four now and we have enjoyed this movie since he was two. Different strokes for different folks I guess. We like it. :),1455926400,,179,4.0
8499142,2,B006J2QG3I,"The graphics in this video are cute, but the story and writing are not.  The mood was depressing and the characters were not likable.  My 3 year old however did enjoy this show and watched it many times.",1447977600,,203,4.315789473684211
8499143,1,B006J2QG3I,really inappropriate for small children and kind of creepy!,1434240000,2,59,5.666666666666667
8499144,1,B006J2QG3I,"This. was. awful. received as a gift, I am very thankful for the thought, but there was nothing but hate in this movie. Angry, hateful, back talking, and negative are great words to describe this movie, there is not one happy positive thing in this movie.  We watched about 10-20 minutes (felt like eternity, I almost turned it off after 2 minutes) just long enough for our 2yo to fall asleep.  Then I hid it.  It is horrible and definitely not the kind of thing I want my child to watch & learn from.",1418601600,3,501,4.308510638297872

8499147,1,B006J2QG3I,"This is horrible, I can't believe this is even a movie.  The story line is awful, the characters are rude, and I wish I could get my money back.  I feel like a bad parent even letting them watch it for 20 minutes.  There was even a line one of the cars said, ""I have a restraining order against you, I'm calling the police""  ??? WTF",1415059200,,332,3.984848484848485
