1356298,4,B00004UEDQ,"Sandra is indead talented,she just never got the perfect role to show it to us! Well here it is! And she did dammn good work! Her best film since ""Practical Magic"" with a serious theme but also funny in a way!  At her side the terrific good acting ""Elizabeth Perkins"" who  playes Sandy's Sister! This picture contens some very imotional scenes and  some terrible funny ones! I cant wait to hold this DVD in my hands! A must  see!",963187200,2,429,4.3924050632911396
1356299,5,B00004UEDQ,"This movie is one of the best movies of Sandra I have seen. She plays a alcoholic, who needs to find herself again in rehab, that is why the name ""28 days"". Why is this movie so good? Well, it shows you how the  real world can be, and that it isn't always much fun as it looks. My  favourite part of the movie is where Gwen (Sandra) plays a part of the hot  series ""Santa Cruz"". She has these curly things in her hair, and  plays a magic role as Dorian. She does this for her roommate, who is almost  leaving rehab. Of course there are more funny bits in the movie, but also  serious parts. But you have to acctualy see it, because I am not going to  tell you more. In my last sentence I just wanted to let everyone know that  YOU HAVE TO SEE THIS MOVIE!",962582400,6,754,3.947019867549669
1356300,4,B00004UEDQ,"This film is a very realistic one, based on how life could be affected when you or some relative or friend use alcohool or drugs. In addition of that, the history and the actors are very good and know how to tell the  history in an amazing way.",962236800,4,244,4.083333333333333
1356301,4,B00004UEDQ,"In the hands of an unsympathetic director and an ego-crazed star, ""28 Days"" could have turned into an uninspired vehicle for award season.
In the hands of director Betty Thomas and star Sandra Bullock,  ""28 Days"" is a masterful work of brutal honesty and bittersweet  comedy that never loses it's dramatic edge.  Bullock plays Gwen Cummings, a  party animal like no other.  Her wild antics spoil her sister's (Elizabeth  Perkins) wedding, not to mention causing a nice family the hassle of  rebuilding their front porch.
She is sentenced to 28 days in Serenity  Glen, a sort of new wave rehabilitation clinic.  The rest of the story  should be experienced on screen as we see Gwen struggle from denial to  opposition to acceptance and finally to a slow healing.  She can't promise  us, or herself for that matter, that her recovery will be swift.  What she  does do is take one day at a time and fight one battle at a time...a lesson  that all of us can apply to our every day lives.
Sandra Bullock gives the  absolute best performance of her career.  She will make you laugh and she  will make you cry, but what she does best is make you think and feel even  if the thoughts and emotions are unwanted.  She is absolutely flawless in  this film.  Further kudos should go to Betty Thomas for her edgy direction  and screenwriter Susannah Grant (""Erin Brockovich"") for hitting  another one out of the park.",961977600,4,1404,4.63265306122449

Beautifully done!  Addiction doesn't care if you are smart, pretty, and capable; it will take you if it can.

1356506,4,B00004UEDQ,"Sandra Bullock proves that she's not just meant for movies that dwell on her ""girl-next-door"" looks. She showed me that she can also play an alcoholic who crash lands and enters a rehab center, where she meets two guys, one being a washed up baseball player, played by Viggo Mortensen, who becomes a friend. The other guy becomes her fiance, but it appears that she isn't really into the relationship.  Throughout her struggles, she meets those who share all sorts of addictions, one ending tragically. There was one scene in the movie that I thought was overdone, but I didn't let that be an issue. The ending is like a real life ""awakening"", but I won't give it away. Watch and enjoy.",1407628800,,686,4.622950819672131

1356508,2,B00004UEDQ,"Absolutely disgusting, and I'm not talking about the acting, I'm talking about the premise and the script. She's a drug addict/alcoholic who ruins her sister's wedding, steals a limo driver's car (and livelihood) nearly causes a head-on collision, and totally trashes someone's home and the next scene is her driving up to a rehab facility???

If it had been me (a black man) I would be in JAIL, charged with grand theft auto, a drug charge, and I would do time in jail. The prisons are filled with poor and non-white people who did a lot less than she did in this film and that almost no one has a problem with this, and are more sympathetic toward her than the people she victimized speaks VOLUMES about white privilege and how its assumed that this sociopathic behavior is normal.

I could not watch the rest of the movie because I could not be sympathetic toward Bullock's character. I do not understand how she can be 'redeemed' by making her out to be a victim because she had a middle-class or upper-middle-class existence and decided to get stoned on pills and booze because she was bored.

Ah, poor kid...

But those poor kids who have real problems who get high or damage property or break the law?

LOCK THOSE ANIMALS UP!

It's a poor but very accurate social commentary on every level and the viewers who ""felt sorry"" for her only confirmed everything I've written above.",1406678400,,1383,4.624489795918367

1356534,4,B00004UEDQ,"I find that in recovery movies, some parts are dead on and others are off (from my experience).  Sandra Bullock really shines, you can see and feel her shift from a practicing drunk to recovery.  The 'kumbaya' stuff turned me off a little.  I understand the lack of mention of a higher power - this can be a sticking point for some.  It was obvious by the end that Sandra's character used the group as her higher power and that is, of course, a suggestion in the 12 and 12.  The only part I disagreed with was her eventual talk with her sister.  I would've liked to see something that more closely resembled a 9th step from Sandra rather than her sister taking responsibility.  This is counter-program.

Aside from that though, this movie provides hope and many tender, poignant moments.  I also really liked it when she had the courage to leave her boyfriend and the advice in the movie about relationships:  get a plant, if it lives for a year, get a pet.  If the pet lives for a year, you can consider a relationship.  Great advice, if hard to take.

It's a simple program, folks!  If you don't like it, we'll gladly refund your misery.",1392595200,,1139,4.4396135265700485

Writer Susannah Grant, director Betty Thomas, and cast researched their ensemble comedy by living in rehabilitation facilities. Ubiquitous Guitar Man Loudon Wainwright III plays and sings emotionally pertinent lyrics while standing behind the action as a Greek chorus [ASIN:6305291470 Mighty Aphrodite] Woody Allen. In the forefront is the fake soap opera Santa Cruz (commentary on popular culture available in its entirety on this disc in Special Features) addictively watched by the entire rehab community of the movie.

Makeupless Diane Ladd portrays self denigrating, humiliated wife of an emotionally abusive philanderer. Marianne Jean-Baptiste as Roshanda hides her British accent, delivers a druggie's aggressive front, until during family therapy her young daughter and son tell her how her addictive behavior affects them. This scene is reminiscent of Jess the child in When a Man Loves a Woman who explains to her father Michael (Andy Garcia) ""you are supposed to hold the bottle in a paper bag to drink"" describing her mother Alice (Meg Ryan),&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Saving-Mr-Banks/dp/B00GPWEPZ8/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Saving Mr. Banks</a>&nbsp;Tom Hanks Emma Thompson story about Mary Poppins,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/August-Osage-County/dp/B00H7LJ2UO/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">August: Osage County</a>&nbsp;Meryl Streep Julia Roberts Sam Shepherd.

In 28 Days Sandra Bullock's character has flashbacks of her alcoholic mother, exciting, entertaining, frightening, amnestic, behavior similar to her own character Gwen Cummings a journalist partying with boyfriend Jasper (Dominic West) borrowing money from her sister played by Elizabeth Perkins, until she destroys her sister's wedding with drunken disregard for the feelings of everyone. Judge offers choice of jail or rehab. Gwen chooses rehab until she decides continued partying with Jasper is more fun. When she is confronted with the jail alternative which she has chosen, Bullock's Gwen is able to lie ""I can quit, I don't have a problem, I can't go to jail"" until she can't. Steve Buscemi is stellar as Gwen's drug counselor Cornell, willing to narrate his own life violations of other's rights as we watch Gwen vainly trying to retrieve a bottle of prescription painkillers she had discarded.

Azura Skye plays a 17 year old heroin addict Andrea, Gwen's roommate, who uses chocolate and self cutting as dysfunctional coping skills. The addiction drives continued use with statistical consequences. Gwen teaches her roomie to fold a chewing gum paper wrapper chain to keep her hands busy instead of self mutilation. The disc has instructions on how to make the chewing gum paper chain. Gwen and Andrea clearly depict the tremor of addicts in remission.

Alan Tudyk is hilarious throughout. Especially in the Santa Cruz parody which the residents devise as a going away theatrical for Andrea. The emotional pain of leaving rehabilitation, with its safety, literature, lectures, 24/7 activities, monitoring, security and social support is well portrayed. What isn't seen is the financial burden of residential treatment.

Various forms of therapy are seen: equine therapy (use of horses to detect intention), climbing therapy (trust of others), group therapy (confrontation by others who are just like you), family therapy (pain), restricted access to mind altering chemicals (caffeine), outdoor therapy. And the shame and stigma associated with trying to get help: baseball player Eddie Boone (Viggo Mortensen) is approached by adoring young fans for his autograph. When Eddie tries to get an autograph from his idol Falcon (see this denouement after the final credits are complete at the end of the DVD) he is again humiliated.

Trying to act against the permanent neurobehavioral alterations in the brain caused by compulsive behaviors and brain cell killing chemicals, is a moment to moment struggle well filmed in this bucolic North Carolina setting.

The repeated relapses from rehabilitation are seen through the eyes of the residents, as well as returning patients.

The movie is laugh out loud funny, which makes watching easier since the subject matter is so intense. Stopping use is only the beginning of the work of change. Gwen realizes she has only taken a first step on the road of life, which everyone has to walk. The yellow brick road to a rescuer Wizard is an illusion which only circles back around to the self, again and again, as the person who has to do the work remains inside. Ruby Slippers notwithstanding.

It isn't all about other people, its about us, all of us, with bad breath, smelly feet, underarm odor and all the other frailties of human existence. When we are finally able to see us as a unit, we begin to heal. The gifts and talents offered and received are the same: listening, insight, honesty, candor, asking for help. We help each other.

1356548,5,B00004UEDQ,"If one is expecting a movie that examines substance abuse in all its depth and complexity as well as providing a totally accurate portrayal of rehab, ""28 Days"" is not the movie to watch. However, if one is content with a production that takes alcoholism seriously, does not see it as a laughing matter, and provides some insight into the tragedy of alcoholism and the skewered thinking of those tortured by the demons of the bottle, this is a movie worth viewing.

We meet Gwen (Sandra Bullock) when she is on her way along with her playboy boyfriend to her sister's wedding. Drunk when she arrives, she manages to get even more drunk, makes a fool of herself, and before long crashes into the cake when losing her balance on the dance floor. Trying to make amends, she commandeers a limo and takes it on an unsteady ride as she loos for a bakery. Needless to say, she doesn't make it, but crashes into a house. Faced with the choice between prison time and rehab, Gwen chooses the latter. It's at this point where the movie gains in depth. For it is while Gwen is in rehab that we begin to see the real battle that takes place within the addictive personality.

The multitalented Sandra Bullock is what makes this movie as good as it is. Always a fine actor, capable of filling many different roles, Bullock is at her best in this film.",1381190400,2,1337,4.475409836065574

1356576,3,B00004UEDQ,"Gwen Cummings (Sandra Bullock) is out of control. A self-proclaimed Alcoholic and part-time drug user, she has completely destroyed her sister's wedding. After arriving forty-five minutes late as the maid of honor, making an embarrassingly bad toast, slap-dancing on the floor, demolishing the four-layer wedding cake, and finally stealing a limousine and driving it to its destruction (all on the intent of 'fixing it')... Gwen finds herself sentenced to twenty-eight days in rehab or jail. It's her choice and obviously... she chooses rehab.

Her roommate is a potentially screwed-up teenage girl with a passion for soap operas but a good heart. Slowly Gwen begins to befriend and understand Andrea while finding the other people in her 'group' almost unbearable. There's the misunderstood, stereotyped gay man (in this account a German), a woman mentally abused by her husband's affairs, alcoholics, druggies, cutters... all manner of person seeking help and/or salvation to their incontrollable urges. Only Gwen is rebellious, but she makes the mistake of asking where she can get high... right in front of her camp counselor, who informs her that any mess-up's will send her to the alternative. In an uphill battle, Gwen must choose between what 'feels good' for the moment -- and her live-high-life with her live-in boyfriend -- or to patch up the misshapen hole that is left of her life and find reconciliation with her sister. As Lily herself proclaimed, 'Sometimes, Gwen, you make it really difficult to love you.'

The choice isn't that apparent at the first, but soon Gwen is forced into making a decision. She takes more time to understand and help Andrea, who is a secret cutter in times of torment; she also befriends a pro-ball player who admits himself for alcohol rehab. But the time is coming when Gwen must face her sister and try desperately to patch up a broken relationship... after all, she did screw up her sister's wedding, and that isn't easy to apologize for. Overall, the film has a good heart. It casts drugs, sex, and alcohol in a bad light. Unfortunately, it also laughs at them. There are several implied sexual scenes -- two of which are seen in passing in an elevator between patients, another with a man coming half-dressed out of a woman's room -- and lots of innuendos. Andrea's soap is desperately bad, with bed-hopping characters (only hinted-at with dialogue) and a wink at a sexual relationship between unknowing half-siblings. When Andrea is released from rehab, Gwen and her friends do a mock parody of the show that hints at these various discrepancies.

There's brief rear nudity, implications of past improprieties, and some immodesty. Overlooking the sensual current that flows through much of the film, there's also bad language (one f-word and many mild profanities, as well as repetitive uses of Oh, my God!) and substance abuse. Gwen nearly kills herself by trying to rescue the drugs she threw out the window only hours before. Boyish jealousy comes to blows. There are a lot of flashbacks as Gwen begins to remember the past... her childhood with an alcoholic mother. There's also a drug-induced suicide that leaves emotional scars on many of our prominent characters.

There are a lot of elements of good in the film, but in all honestly it shoots itself in the foot with sensuality and brief profanity. I was able to look past the flaws and find the lessons tucked away in the film's packaging, but those looking for a fun Sandra Bullock film like While You Were Sleeping or Miss Congeniality will be disappointed. The laughs are uncomfortable, but the heart-tugging moments of reconciliation and change very real. At the risk of giving the ending away (which seems to end prematurely) Gwen does choose to abandon all ties with her past and walk 'cleanly' into the future. 28 Days tries very hard to be both comedy and drama, but winds up being much more serious than comical.",1363824000,,3931,4.9696048632218845

The film does not glamorize or poke fun at its thematic content, but instead shimmers in truth depicting the problems in which a nowhere life can lead. This movie teaches us lessons through its characters. And the lessons are well taught. Recommended to all.

After getting into a car accident while drunk on the day of her sister's wedding, Gwen Cummings is given a choice between prison or a rehab center. She chooses rehab, but is extremely resistant to taking part in any of the treatment programs they have to offer, refusing to admit that she has an alcohol addiction. After getting to know some of the other patients, Gwen gradually begins to re-examine her life and see that she does, in fact, have a serious problem.

There, she begins to bond with her screwed-up teenage roommate, but finds the other people in her group almost unbearable.

Her life changes as she experiences ups and downs and faces the darkness of her own addictions, but in the meantime the movie is a little hard to love. It has a good heart and some solid messages in it, as well as a realistic view of reconciliation and recovery from drug addiction, but the laughs are very uncomfortable. The film winds up trying to be both a drama and a  comedy but winds up landing on the serious side of things. Good, but a hard watch and deeply flawed.

Then again, I didn't write the dern thing so I might as well grin and bear it - and that's easy to do when the acting, writing, and characters are so realistic (yet pleasantly fictionalized) as those in 28 Days. Enjoy this movie! It's definitely worth the watch! Then again, if you absolutely can't stand a few predictable moments or cliches, and maybe you're tired of the superficiality of the big, strong, adorably flawed ""better man"" (although they did seem to play well with how that issue ended) among the rest of a good movie, you might just want to rent it for your laptop for a slightly cheaper price. The lessons I believe this movie tries to teach are pretty clear and well-known, but still nice to see: everyone needs a helping hand at some point, life is about more than dulling the senses for the sake of a good time, and sometimes the hardest thing to do is exactly what will heal us - in this case, to face the reality of what we've become and how most of the time we're the only ones to blame...

I think that the director did strike just the right balance between a serious story about alcohol abuse and a relatively light hearted approach to it.  It's not heavy like The Days of Wine and Roses or Lost Weekend.  Yet it doesn't trivialize the problem either.

Sandra Bullock carries the film.  She's very good, showing the full range of cool and callous New Yorker and the vulnerable person underneat the facade.  She doesn't strike a wrong note anywhere.

The supporting cast is just as fine.  The young woman (sorry, I can't remember her name) who plays Sandra's 19 year old room mate in the rehab center is wonderful.  The fellow who plays the German is hilarious.  Viggo Mortensen, whom I love, is only in a small part of the film.

She made a lot of films, some good, some awful, but she got blamed for the failures, and never got credit for her good performances. Since winning the Oscar and then being cheated on by Jesse James, the public's sympathy has shifted 180 degrees. For a while there it was 24/7 Bullock, Bullock, Bullock on the airwaves, all day/every day. Critics like me are digging up films from the archive and going back to uncover any forgotten gems we may have missed. 28 Days is not the mother lode, it is just a load of Bullock.

-------------------------------------------
Gwen Cummings: Is that available stitched on a pillow somewhere?
=============================

During filming in New York Sandra Bullock stayed in the recently departed Dennis Hopper's apartment and that alone should have inspired the young thespian. Her method of acting involved downing a triple espresso before any scene that required her character to have uncontrollable shakes. Is that how Hopper did it in Blue Velvet? Bullock is allergic to horses, but one scene of equine therapy required her to gain a horse's trust so it would allow her to bend the horse's leg. In spite of her allergies, she bent it. What a trouper.

-----------------------------
Betty: Tonight's lecture: Are you a blackout drunk, or don't you remember?
==================

Betty Thomas, who was an officer on Hill Street Blues, and also acted in such films as Troop Beverly Hills, has stepped behind the camera where she has directed The Brady Bunch Movie and others of that caliber. She also directed Private Parts, the bio pic about shock jock Howard Stern. She is no Orson Welles, but knows how to serve up some light hearted fare such as 28 Days.

OK, it is not so bad in a kind of made-for-TV movie, after school special, sit com level acting kind of way. A light hearted romp through rehab. It's no Leaving Las Vegas, Days of Wine and Roses, Rachael Getting Married, or When a Man Loves a Woman. Sandra Bullock has a certain ineffable charm, and the cast of characters are all kind of cute in their own peculiar ways. Alan Tudyk plays Gerhardt, an extremely odd character who improvises a strange monologue about forks in the road. He is perhaps the wackiest neighbor, the Cosmo Kramer, if you will, of 28 Days; but the ever so slightly less odd characters anchor the story.

Dominic West plays Jasper, her boyfriend, her enabler, her co dependent. The audience, and eventually Gwen Cummings can see that he is not very helpful to Gwen in her quest for sobriety. Viggo Mortensen plays Eddie Boone, a baseball player with substance abuse issues. He is your average jock, except that he is a secret soap opera fan, showing his softer side. They created a soap opera within the movie, and it was called Santa Cruz. Also a big fan of Santa Cruz was Gwen's roommate Andrea (Azura Skye). Mike O'Malley plays one of the other rehabbers, and he can currently be seen as Kurt's dad on Glee.

Steve Buscemi is in this playing a counselor called Cornell. He does an adequate job, but it is not up to the level of his Theodore Donald 'Donny' in 1998's The Big Lebowski. But bottom line, what is?

------------------------------
Cornell: This isn't a way to live. This is a way to die.

1356626,4,B00004UEDQ,"I've seen this film a few times (I even saw it twice in the theater) and walking away from it I feel the same way every time.  This is a good film that just lands on the wrong side of great thanks to a few pacing issues.  You know, I really enjoy this film and find all the performances, especially Bullock's, to be strong and focused and intriguing; but the film has a few spots that just seem to lag along forever.  If the film had been tightened just a little (and maybe a few of the clichs flipped on their heads) then this film could have been one of the best of the year.

That said, Bullock would easily make my top ten Lead Actress ballot for 2000.

The film revolves around Gwen, a grown woman who acts very much like a child thanks to her addictions to pills and booze, not to mention the strong influence from her equally immature (and self centered) boyfriend Jasper.  When she unintentionally (yet most likely not really regretfully) ruins her sisters wedding thanks to her `issues', she finds herself spending a month in rehab where she starts to find herself by witnessing the effect her life has on others as well as getting to see herself through others eyes.  The film may go in a very predictable direction (the character arcs for Jasper, Gwen and one unlucky patient are very `by the book') but it feels very authentic and relatable from start to finish.

Well, except for the weird love angle involving Eddie, the baseball player.

In the end though, it is not the script itself that gets the negative point, or maybe it is, but not the plot aspect of the script.  There are just a few scenes that needed to be cut in order to keep the film from lulling and leaving holes of disinterest.  It's sad when a film can grab you and then kind of push you away almost simultaneously.

It's a balanceing act that this film didn't quite master.

Still, the acting is rather remarkable, especially when you consider the type of film this COULD have become.  When you think of Sandra Bullock you don't really think of dramatic actress.  You think of bubbly and cute romantic comedies.  Well, now you think of Oscar Winning actress (congrats Sandra, even if NO ONE should have beaten Mulligan this year!), but at the time this was released Sandra was not really known for her skills in the dramatic department.  She SOARS here.  She really understands how to use her knack for endearing the audience as well as this rich element of surprise into creating a beautifully sincere character.  The ensemble is actually very well used, from the selfish sensuality that envelopes Dominic West to the awkward heartbreak that swallows Azura Skye; all the way to Steve Buscemi and the ridiculously underused Mike O'Malley.

Of course, there is always one who just steals every scene, and here that is Alan Tudyk.

I totally recommend this film.  I wish that I could say it was perfect and give it an A, but a B+ is pretty good and this film more than deserves that grade.  Sandra is a star (we all know that) and this may be her finest performance (although I am still VERY partial to her work in `While You Were Sleeping') so see it for her performance if nothing else.  Thankfully this film is far more than just a performance vehicle.",1268092800,,3236,4.5111492281303605

The rest of the movie deals with a few people who are fighting for their lives against people going through sever withdrawal issues (rotting skin, vomiting blood, and trying to eat people's brains, etc.). The group fights their way out of an apartment building to find help from the military only to have to then fight off the soldiers who attempt to rape the women of the group.

Which is why I'm still torn over 28 DAYS.  This film addresses addiction, yet often in a comedic, lighthearted way.  And I like that. . .to some degree.  Yet I often wonder if this approach somehow sterilizes the ominous undertones and consequences of addiction--and the difficulties of recovery. But enough of my own personal dilemma. . .

Sandra Bullock plays (and plays well) a boozing, pill-popping party girl who goes on a binge that lands her in rehab; her journey--from being a rebel in denial to a fragile young woman coping with her fragility--is moving and compelling.  Dominic West is exceptional as Bullock's equally out-of-control boyfriend; Elizabeth Perkins also holds up her own as Bullock's older, often judgmental sister.  Of the fellow recovering addicts, Viggo Mortensen's character was never fully vetted, while Alan Tudyk as a rather flamboyant (and that's putting it mildly) light-in-the-loafers German is hysterical.  Overall a great cast that tackles a dark subject in both dark and light tones; here's hoping the lightheartedness of 28 DAYS doesn't sugarcoat a very serious matter.

1356633,5,B00004UEDQ,"28 Days is a fabulous movie that stirs many emotions associated with addiction, immaturity, and insecurity. Sandra Bullock plays a character that demonstrates how many perceived strong and ""vibrant"" people in our lives, are too often driven by hidden insecurities and emotional pain. The movie centers around a beautiful and charismatic woman about 30 years old, that has surrounded her life with equally colorful and insecure people that routinely gather and celebrate in public places, all attempting to demonstrate that they are part of the ""in-crowd"". Although these people can be perceived to be having the time of their lives, it turns out they really have no life at all - and do a great job of indirectly hurting themselves and their family. Addiction to alcohol and drugs is a common outcome, and I am guessing that we all may know people like this.

The movie makes you laugh and cry, and really makes you think about those people in your lives that may mask an internal pain, with external friendliness or happiness - maybe even ourselves. I can't imagine a better actress than Sandra Bullock to play this role, and have to say I really enjoyed the intelligence of this movie.

GREAT MOVIE!",1227312000,2,1201,4.882352941176471
1356634,4,B00004UEDQ,"I work with adults, families, and adolescents who have addiction issues. I am always on the lookout for both new and older films who are about addiction that I can show to my clients.  ""28 Days"" is one of those films.  It chronicles the life of a alcoholic party girl Gwen (played by SAndra Bullock) and an involuntary trip to rehab that she does not take seriously at first.  After she is encouraged to get drunk in rehab by her boyfriend, and nearly gets kicked out of rehab and put into jail, she begins to take what her counselor and her other friends in rehab are telling her about her problems drinking seriously. A death of a friend in rehab really wakes her up, and upon discharge she is intent to make changes in her life and stay sober.
 This video is excellent to show to a rehab group who are ""on the fence"" as to whether or not they have a problem with their drinking and or using drugs (despite the fact to everyone else in their life they obviously are addicted to alcohol and/or drugs). A counselor can process this movie by asking questions such as ""How are you like Gwen (the lead character) in ""28 DAys?""  Who is the enabler in the movie?  Why did the clients at the rehab center wear signs? etc.  I have found this movie to be very beneficial in producing a discussion of what is problematic, drug addicted behavior compared to social drinking.",1223856000,2,1364,4.410358565737051
1356635,5,B00004UEDQ,"Moving story about not only a woman who gets thrown into rehab, but also who has repressed her feelings, her life and finds herself maturing into an adult after drinking her younger life away. When she first gets into rehab, it's not only a typical scene that one might see in a rehab facility, but also one where, since the stunting of her emotional, responsible and relationship senses are that of a young, out of control child who raised herself. Through the movie, she learns how to be alive, how to be sensitive, that the man she thought was so great for her isn't at all and why, and she gets the beginnings of how to grow, get in touch with not only her feelings, but learns what is not good for her and to walk away. She learns to ask for help from those who are healthy and to walk from those who are not, slowly, and through a process that we can only wish some people would get, yet without the tragedy (although that's how some people must learn it, as for some they simply don't see it until they really hurt someone (or even kills them in some people's lives.)

This isn't only a good story for alcoholics or drug addicts, but also one for those who haven't grown up as adults for whatever reason. To learn that people make mistakes, to learn that human touch and feelings are really what life is about, not the girl or guy with the nice suit or those who are trying to make an appearance of having money, ""friends"", or the potential of the mansion on the hill, the so-called ""Glamorous life."" She grows to see through all the BS and get real with herself, get in touch with her feelings, realize that being able to be vulnerable is the best gift she can not only give to herself, but also to those around her, and she learns not only how to be a friend to others, but how to recognize who her friends really are.

Great flick they outta show and discuss in high schools and colleges (although there are some parts that are graphic - drug use, etc., but then if we are real about it, most kids are seeing this stuff to one degree or another anyhow!)

The lessons in this movie come SO late in life for some people, and for some not at all, living lives that are akward, fake, idealized, but then these people never really are happy on the inside, nor do they know how to really connect with other people. An awesome gift for someone who needs to grow before they can really feel what it is to have a family relationship, a true friend, a real life and be happy with who they really are (weather they hide in anxiety, drugs, alcohol, self-indulgence, or whatever it is that keeps them from being who they really are and not trying to put on a mask to feel OK or better than others. To simply be happy with who they are - monetarily rich or poor, healthy or sick, no matter what it is that they are trying to escape by the egotistical ""look at me, look at my [whatever], look at what I have"" syndrome that keeps SO many people from true happiness, and is sad to watch, as these people don't really feel, are not in touch with their feelings, and miss out on what life is really about and unfortunately often times self-medicate with alcohol, drugs, sex, gossip, talking to others as though they don't know anything (the ""know it all"" syndrome) whatever to make themselves feel good about themselves, and that often has other people who are centered in their lives dropping them by the wayside, as they don't care for the drama.",1196035200,4,3439,4.336956521739131
1356636,5,B00004UEDQ,"When I began watching this film, I had a sense early on that I might not like it all that much as I thought the character of Gwen and her drunken antics were somewhat overdone, until the scene where she crashes the limo. Such incidents do happen with addicts in denial and unaware of their dangerous behavior while under the influence. As the movie continued, I was impressed with how this film showed a realistic portrait of the events and situations that take place in a rehab facility. There is good humor throughout the film as humor is a needed assett when struggling through difficult times, but there is also debatable explanations on the meaning of life and why people make the choices they do as the scene with Gwen and her boyfriend gives an exchange of two very different outlooks on life. Gwen also comes to take accountability as she discovers the owning up process. The scenes involving her and her sister are touching and believable rather than coming off as forced or sappy, and the supporting characters grow on you despite their issues. Filled with superb writing that lends itself to many moments of laughter, sadness, and positive affrimations that are true to life(""Something bigger than us will care and determine our outcomes when we take care of the little things"")28 Days is one of the best movies to come around in a long time.",1188259200,3,1353,4.713080168776371
1356637,5,B00004UEDQ,"5 STARS RIGHT OFF!

Some films can be formulaic and their characters fairly predictable thus being the case in the 2000 film 28 DAYS starring Sandra Bullock. What makes this this film so appealing and so important is the correct balance with which Bullock handles her character, the alcoholic,pill addicted, made-a-mess-of-her-life (and everyone elses!)Gwen Cummings. With addiction ruining her life, Gwen enters a rehab for a mandatory 28 days after running a hijacked wedding limo into the living room of a house. She had previously made a complete fool of herself at her sister's wedding by falling backside into the three tiered wedding cake! Bullock allows Gwen to go through all of the stages of denial, regret and final acceptance of her disease with comedic touches and true pain showing both sides of addiction recovery as they are: the blunt reality that you have hit bottom and you may die, but on the other hand ""Keep it simple stupid"" and ""Easy does it. One day at a time."" In other hands, this movie about such a serious and life threatening condition might become overly serious,preachy or maudlin; but director Betty Thomas trusts Bullock with the Susannah Grant screenplay to keep Gwen from becoming a joke OR a model of sobriety.

If I had to choose one film that treats addiction without depressing the viewer to no end, then it would be 28 DAYS. Other excellent films such as MY NAME IS JOE, CLEAN AND SOBER, FACTORY GIRL,RAY, AFFLICTION and even NUTS, although completely wonderful films in their own rights, are very heavy handed and can be quite depressing. 28 DAYS embraces the grave subject with a lighter touch that does not bring down the viewer.(REMEMBER: Movies can inform and STILL be entertaining!) The viewer is uplifted and given hope amidst the rocky road to recovery. This is a highly recommended movie on the subject of addiction whether you are an addict, a counselor, someone in 12-step recovery, or someone affected by an addicts behavior.",1186444800,2,1978,4.919161676646707

1356639,4,B00004UEDQ,"This movie is another in a pretty formulaic cadre of from committed boozer and dope addict to drug free recovery stories.  This movie does have the virtue of being genuinely funny in some places.  Best of all  this movie does not take itself so seriously that the anti-drug message dominates the movie.  The Movie has a strong anti-drug message make no mistake about that but it is not preachy, high toned, condescending or overly moralistic.

I do not agree that this movie protrays all teenaged ladies as vapid, self absorbed, trite peices of fluff unable to avoid the snare of drug abuse or addiction.  However if you go to a football stadium during a football game most of the people you will see there are football fans.  Likewise if you have a movie set in the teen ladies unit of a drug treatment center you will see mostly teenaged ladies who for whatever reason were unable to beat the lure of low life dope dealers.  The fact that a small faction of teen aged young ladies end up on the crazy road to drug drained boozed up palookaville does not in any way take from the fact that most teen aged young ladies become awesome contributing members of society.  28 Days wants to be a movie that zooms in on life for a small fraction of teen aged ladies who have surcumb to the evils of dope and booze and are on the road to productive recovery.

Despite the serious subject matter what makes this movie fun, is the cast of odd ball characters on the druggie unit with the main character.  You just know by looking at this druggie program that it is populated with the posh more well to do upper crust crowd and their is nothing wrong with that.  Everyone is just slightly off kilter just enough to be interesting yet still beleivable.  I have found most dope addicts and boozers have their weird quirks.  It is said that what most in society consider an eccess of weirdness is the price paid by those whose level of inspired creativity allows them to think outside the box in chosen life pursuits.

In the case of the main character as with so many creative types, she aches to be accepted by mainstream society.  Her pleas to be loved by polite society go unrequited as thinking outside the box creatively has become a pain for which drugs and or booze become her crutch.  One of the funniest parts of the movie has to be when her enabler boyfriend brings booze, a cheap diamond and his stupid boozed up - pro-druggie ideals to her on a boatride while she is in the treatment center.  This guy was such a TOTAL UTTER LOSER, while he sounded sincere in his every word he was also a sad black comedy because, there are really people out there who think exactly like him.

28 Days (Special Edition) is a good DVD because despite its heavy subject matter it is still a ""very entertaining movie"".  Good fun solid Entertainment is something most druggie \ boozer finds redemption flicks usually do not do very well.  28 days is funny, entertaining while still holding on to its strong anti-drug message. Sandra Bullock is not bad to look at in this DVD, she does some good solid acting here and if Sandra is your cup of tea she shines like a diamond ever so nicely in for these 28 Days!

The satirical comedy scenes of the chanting were delightful and depicted the sense of silliness that most addicts or alcoholics see them as at first. The dramatic scenes of withdrawal and attempted suicide are very true. The need to change from an addictive social network to a sober support network is also true. I loved the horse scene at the end where the main character finally got a sense of spiritual victory when she finally submitted to the need for help. This is a film that captures the serious nature of addiction with a hint of humor in a manner that will allow the largest audience to gain insights into addiction and recovery.

1356643,2,B00004UEDQ,"Sandra Bullock plays a reckless woman, supposedly a writer, although this was only mentioned once in passing, who, along with her British boyfriend is constantly boozing and partying it up. She also seems to be hooked on painkillers. After ruining her sister's wedding, then stealing a limosene and drunkenly crashing it into a house, she (although this is not shown in the film), is sentenced to 28 days in rehab as an alternative to jail. In rehab, she meets some interesting characters with various addictions, and eventually starts to own up to her problems and begin her recovery.

The rehab characters, who each curiously show us about 30 seconds of insight, seem promising, but what we learn about them is vague. The lame chanting in the rehab center is silly, in that it is never explained why people buy into it so readily. At times the film played like an educational video about the dangers of alcohol/drug addiction, but even falls short there, as the center clearly is lacking in addressing some areas of treatment. Some performances are decent, while others are not so good. What happens after the 28 days are up, are we to simply assume what her life is going to be like? The film seemed better suited as a TV movie, really..

I could keep nitpicking, but I think you get the idea. Although it kept me interested, I was not exactly entertained, as the trailer hinted that this was to be an entertaining film. I was pretty much disappointed by it",1152921600,3,1460,4.69921875

This film does have funny moments from time to time but it is mainly a hard-hitting drama. The scene where Bullock is in the withdrawal period of her addiction is real and heartbreaking.

1356646,5,B00004UEDQ,"Maybe you are thinking what I was thinking when I first heard about this movie.  ""Oh great, they are making a cute movie out of a horrible problem called addiction, and are going to sum up rehab in a darling, romanticized way.""  I refused to watch it for a long time because of this presumption.  Relax, and give the film a try.  Although cute in places and using some subtle but great humor, '28 Days' does not romanticize the problem of addiction.

What it does manage to show, much to my amazement, is how trite and cheesy 'Recovery' can seem to the addict.  The scenes of chanting, serenity prayers, and singing 'Lean On Me' are not portrayed as inspiring or moving, but as irritating customs of the Center.  Perhaps portions of the movie go to the far edges of each condition, drunkenness and sobriety, but it does not come across as contrived.  People really do these things, and some people really recover from it, and '28 Days' follows Gwen Cummings story, who is an exceptionally ""gravitational"" personality, easily allowing for a larger than life story.

Gwen (Sandra Bullock) is a writer, and along with party-time boyfriend Jasper (Dominic West) show up late and manage to ruin her sister Lily's (Elizabeth Perkins) wedding.  After being late, Gwen ruins the mother-in-law's dress, takes a spin on the dance floor and winds out crushing the wedding cake, then steals a limo to drive to a cake store and replace it.  Careening down the road, Gwen wrecks the limo into the side of a house.  Sentenced to twenty-eight days in rehab or prison, Gwen finds herself at the Serenity Glen Rehabilitation Center.

Gwen's lifestyle as a New York writer/columnist is not conductive to sobriety, but even Gwen never realized the extent of her reliance on booze and prescription drugs.  Not until she breaks the rules of Serenity Glen and her counselor Cornell (played by the amazing Steve Buscemi) arranges to have her sentence continued in prison.  Only when Gwen practically leaps from a third story window in an attempt to retrieve the pills from Jasper that she earlier threw away does Gwen realize something is wrong with her.  She decides its time to do something for herself, and convinces Cornell to let her stay at Serenity Glen.

Gwen must face many aspects of herself that she finds intolerable while sober, while also facing visits from Jasper who doesn't see the point of leaving their old life behind for sobriety.  What follows is a touching, and yes, comical romp through Gwen's rehab, but it fits well because Gwen has a tendency to use humor to deflect emotional response.

The characters in this movie are outstanding.  Sandra Bullock plays Gwen to perfection.  Steve Buscemi is amazing as always, Dominic West as fun-boy Jasper is perfect, and look for a ridiculously intriguing performance by Alan Tudyk as Gerhardt, the funniest character in the movie.  Gerhardt is an eccentric, over-the-top, emotional, stammering geek, and steals the movie with only a few lines.  (""Oh my God, look at my package!"" and ""I want my foreskin back, no one asked when they took it, they just took it."")  Also, at the very end of the movie, check out Gerhardt's T-shirt that he's wearing.  Hysterical!!

Even through the horrid cheesiness of ridiculous rehab ritual, Gwen manages to make friends.  Aside from Gerhardt, there is Daniel (Reni Santoni) the doctor who used to pump his own stomach, Andrea (Azura Skye), Gwen's roommate, a seventeen year old heroin addict who is far wiser than her years, Betty (Margo Martindale) as the crotchety but not humorless receptionist, and Eddie Boone (Viggo Mortenson) a professional baseball player addicted to booze and sex.

I was surprised at how well this movie actually turned out, comparing in my opinion to the classics 'Days Of Wine And Roses' and 'Lost Weekend'.  Pay special attention to Cornell's speech for the group, where he talks about using whether something happened or nothing happened.  While there is good humor in this movie, and it realistically portrays the cheesiness of all those rehab clichs, it still winds out to be a good (though somewhat tragic) story about a good person.  Gwen is obviously a loveable personality, both drunk and sober, which makes her choice more realistic than someone who makes a ""dramatic change"".  There is a very funny scene where Gwen uses her talents as a writer to create an impromptu play based on Andrea's favorite soap opera, Santa Cruz.  The clips of this soap opera are so over the top that you will laugh your hinder off at them.

Great acting, fantastic characterizations, good photography, a healthy dose of realism, a great script, and insightfully surreal flashbacks made this movie much better than it should have been.  Oh, and it made me thirsty (he  he he).  Definitely a 'buy', but I always recommend rent first.  Enjoy!",1143590400,72,4834,4.8858895705521475
1356647,3,B00004UEDQ,"A woman with a penchant for the bottle drives a limousine into the side of a house while intoxicated, and must serve 28 days in a rehabilitation center or go to jail. Her initial indifference to the place and her issue, land her into even more trouble, at which point, she must ultimately decide what she wants out of her own life.

  A surprisingly emotional and funny picture, which despite its road-much-traveled feel, gives us enough interesting characters and a solid performance from Bullock, to qualify as a solid feel-good dramedy. I don't recommend you see this film if you're expecting to learn something new about the process of rehabilitation, drug or alcohol addiction or the relationships of an addict. But if you don't mind revisiting some of these tendered themes once more in a film which moves at a quick pace, delivers tit-for-tat moments of humor and drama, and ultimately gives you every single 12-step quote needed for anyone to conquer any addiction of life, then grab a couple of six-packs and check yourself into this moving picture. Of course, I've never been shy to admit my own enjoyment of ""the beverage"" every now and again, but thankfully my even bigger fixation on Internet porn, hasn't allowed either habit to take over my life completely. But enough about me. Harumph!

Sandra Bullock really surprised me in this film. Sure, her character is still pretty cute, does and says cute things, and knows how to party (well, early on in the movie that is... : ), but this movie allowed Sandra to demonstrate a little more of her dramatic range, a talent which up until this film, had personally gone completely unnoticed by moi. Well by golly, she pulled it off something fierce with several decent scenes featuring a serious Sandra wallowing in her troubles that be. Of course, much like any other ""institutionalized"" movie, the rest of the characters in the film also needed to create a certain amount of interest, if only enough to pad the lead performances. The film delivers on that front as well. The stand-out in the area of humour was definitely the ""german gay guy"" aka Alan Tyduk, who had the crowd in stitches every time he uttered, or tried to utter, a word in this film. Dramatically, Azura Sky took the honors with a touching portrayal of a girl struggling to overcome her disabling disease, and the best hair, as usual, went to the great Viggo Mortensen. I suspect that most fans of Julia Roberts' ERIN BROCKOVICH (7/10) will enjoy this one as well, seeing as both films feature top-dog actresses at the top of their respective game, an interesting yet predictable story, and as per usual Hollywood style, a generally upbeat ending. Of course, this film also has a lot more humor going for it, but I suppose that's offset by the film's many serious moments as well.

All in all, you don't have to be a drinker to appreciate this flick, but I suppose an affection for Sandy Bullock, an understanding of the subject at hand, and the capacity to embrace a familiar but entertaining theme, should make this one enjoyable for most anyone fitting that bill.

Cast:  Sandra Bullock, Viggo Mortensen, Dominic West, Elizabeth Perkins, Azura Skye, Steve Buscemi, Alan Tudyk, Mike O'Malley, Marianne Jean-Baptiste, Reni Santoni, Diane Ladd.

Running Time:  103 minutes

Rated PG-13 for mature thematic elements involving substance abuse, language and some sensuality.

""28 Days"" is one of the most accurate, yet touching movies about alcoholism and drug addiction.  The film does not glamorize or poke fun at its thematic content, but instead shimmers in truth depicting the problems in which a nowhere life can lead. Why would anyone want to see a movie about someone spending time in rehab, regardless of how well crafted it is? Because ""28 Days"" is an interesting, sometimes funny, and involving tale with empathetic, down to earth characters, it is a production that should not pass by you without a watch.  The film's main character is named Gwen Cummings and is played by the talented Sandra Bullock. She lives a wild, crazy life with her boyfriend, Jasper (Dominic West). Gwen is an alcoholic and a drug addict, and does not get much support from her similar love interest. As the movie opens, the two get drunk at a club, come home, have sex, and put out a fire with wine. The next day, Gwen arrives late to her sister's wedding, only to destroy an expensive dessert and crash a limousine into a house.

The Gwen Cummings character is developed clearly and effectively. We learn about her lifestyle, recognize faults, and are shown a dark history through painfully real flashbacks. This is one of the things that make ""28 Days"" so involving. We discover elements about the character and notice inner changes as she learns of them herself. I really cared about this character.  Gwen is given a choice, she can serve jail time for her wrongdoing or can waive that and spend 28 days in a rehab clinic. She chooses rehab. The head counselor is Cornell (Steve Buscemi), who shows empathy but also coyness. Also present at his heath clinic is an assortment of characters who sing sappy melodies and share group love, including Daniel (Reni Santoni), with thick glasses and medical capabilities, Andrea (Azura Skye), Gwen's young roommate, and Eddie Boone (Viggo Mortensen), a famous baseball pitcher with a drinking problem.

Gwen's experiences in rehab seem truthful and accurate. Her withdrawals and agonies are realistic and knowledgeable. It is obvious the filmmakers and Sandra Bullock thoroughly researched the stresses and details of rehab.  Sandra Bullock performs with the right amount of immaturity and charisma. This wonderful actress is set free in this kind of heart filled role; she is best when the main character. Here, Gwen is free to tread the surface of the movie and still allows other characters to contribute to her defining.  About half way through, the movie losses its much needed focus on Gwen and drifts into detailing relationships, friendships, and other characters. While most of the events that take place surround Gwen, the movie was on the right track with its first half. ""28 Days"" is smart enough to recognize its blunder; however, and by the final scenes it regains the emotionally correct material and concludes with high standards. The filmmakers are advertising it as a comedy, but only an isolation of sequences offer hilarity or slapstick. This movie teaches us lessons through its characters and the lessons are well taught.",1135987200,2,3429,5.067495559502665

The characters portrayed in this film were interesting.  We learned a lot in a short amount of time.  We SAW the characters getting healthier, learning to live, learning to live without drugs and alcohol. . . .they grew right in front of us (unlike in Clean and Sober).

Sandra Bullock played Gwen perfectly.  Elizabeth Perkins, in a smaller role, played her sister just as perfectly.  The viewer gets to see both of them heal. . . although Elizabeth Perkins' character isn't alcoholic, her life is also a struggle, and their closure is believable and warm.

Gwen has tough choices to make, and the ending is upbeat and positive, but absolutely credible.  We see her preparing for these choices throughout the movie.",1118880000,3,835,4.872340425531915
1356652,4,B00004UEDQ,"A script so good that even Sandra Bullock's annoying presence can't mess it up. There are still some typical ""Sandra"" moments, but for the most part in this movie, you forget you are watching her, and it's a great film. This is a comedy.

I have this DVD and watched it with commentary. I must say the director came off like a complete ass, but maybe she had a bad day. There are other cute features, like instructions on how to make a gum-wrapper chain like Sandra makes in the movie.

Basic storyline:

Gwen is a party girl who gets busted for a DUI. She is sentenced to rehab. At first she thinks rehab is whack and cheesy. She doesnt participate with the others, and has her party-boy boyfriend sneak her drugs. But then she starts to think she really may have a problem. Will Gwen straighten up, or continue with her partying ways? Will she accept the proposal of her drunk-druggie boyfriend?

This movie is above all a comedy. The addicts will make you laugh, Gwen's reaction to them will make you laugh. Steve Buschemi plays a rehab counselor, and while he isn't funny in this role, he is interesting.

There are a few sub-plots. Gwen's rehab roomie is a teenage heroin addict. Also, a major-league pitcher (sex addict, druggie) comes to rehab and bonds with Gwen. These aren't too detracting from Gwen and in fact it would be boring if the whole movie was just about her.

I don't think this movie did so well, and that's why you can get the DVD for cheap. If you have ever had a drug or alcohol problem, this movie will seem a lot funnier to you, than to someone who has never been into any of that.

I guess the bottom line is that people should not just brush this off as a ""Sandra Bullock movie"". I have seen a lot of her movies and this is definitely the best. It isn't brainless comedy. It isn't genius either, but it is definitely enjoyable and I think worth a purchase.",1118188800,3,1885,4.383954154727793
1356653,4,B00004UEDQ,"Its possible that some of the viewers who were disappointed that the movie wasn't serious enough may have missed the point. You just cant compare it to movies such as When A Man Loves A Woman because 28 Days is a dramatic COMEDY. The director says so herself in the special features. But just because it partly fuctions as so doesnt mean its showing addiction as entertaining. The comedy was to show how sometimes humor can help people get through difficult situations. And it did this without making addiction seem lighthearted. There were numerous scenes in the movie that made it absolutely clear how destructive addiction can be on one's self and those around them, such as the scene where the children are telling their mother how much her using has hurt them. Not to mention portraying the desperation that could cause someone to jump out of a window, ruining a loved one's wedding, relapses, and overdose. A movie that touches on all of these certainly cant be called a fluffy film. But that it can do so and also make you laugh is something special. The only real complaint I can find is that the scenes between Sandra's character and the ball player were a bit contrived, underdeveloped, and didn't always totally connect. But other than that Bullock and the rest of the cast were quite charming in a film balanced well between seriousness and laughter.",1115596800,2,1362,4.751054852320675
1356654,4,B00004UEDQ,"Some movies are just fluff, while some can change lives. 28 Days falls solidly into the second category, although it is by no means it is a documentary. It is a light Hollywood treatment of a serious topic. You can take the point of view that at least maybe people who ARE addicted will see it without realizing the full import up front, and realize they need help.

We begin with Sandra Bullock's character, who is a New York lady living the high life with her boyfriend. After a night of heavy drinking, she wakes up late for her older sister's wedding. She completely destroys the wedding, crashes the wedding limo and ends up in rehab.

You get the typical transition from surly, angry newcomer to understanding, coping recovery person - learning more about her past and the characters around her along the way. Situations are extremely two dimensional and oversimplified, but to be fair, the movie only has so many minutes in which to tell the story. There are the traditional set-backs and problems, and small victories.

So where is Viggo, the 2nd billing, in all of this? If you're a Viggo fan, you spend about half the movie waiting for him. He eventually shows up as a baseball pitcher tossed into rehab to fix his drugs-and-girls habit. He's got southern charm and a laid back personality, as always. And yes, there are horses. It seems Viggo likes to be in horse-movies. In this case, the horse is one of the key ""characters"" - it symbolizes Sandra's ability to finally let things go and trust in life.

It's actually suprising that Viggo got second billing here. He doesn't have many lines, and he isn't even a 'romantic partner' for Sandra. In fact he is quite innocent when Sandra's boyfriend accuses Viggo of stepping into the situation.  Viggo does deliver the final message to her as she leaves rehab, though - to learn how to forgive, and to cut her boyfriend loose in order to face a new world alcohol-free. Sure enough, it turns out her boyfriend is trying to drag her right into the same world, and she does better to go it alone.

The scenes with Viggo were a little contrived, but they had their own charm. Viggo had his low key country charm, but punched Sandra's boyfriend pretty quickly when things got rough. He showed Sandra how to pitch, and had her throw the ball with her eyes closed, to teach her trust. On the other hand, he was literally caught with his pants down, showing that he hadn't quite given up the sleeping around yet.

The only thing missing here in the ""Viggo Standards"" was another language - Viggo only gets to speak ""southern American"" in this film!

Interestingly, this was Viggo's last movie before the Lord of the Rings series. So he went from a very understated role, to one which made him world famous.",1114041600,24,2757,4.612244897959184
1356655,4,B00004UEDQ,"While the film was entertaining, I do not find anything in the least entertaining about the subject matter of drug addiction. In Gwen's book it was booze and Vicodin......a killer combo.....Alcoholics are often seen as hilarious, but in reality most of the time they leave a trail of tragedy not only for those who are closest to them, ie families and their friends, but they create pain in the lives of total strangers.....witness Gwen's destruction of a limo and a residence when she left her sister's wedding reception. I suppose we should be happy she did not end up on the freeway with the limo.
I found the characters in this film just too cute.....From what I have seen on COPS, they don't appear to be that cute in reality, or maybe if you have the 50K, which rehabs centers like Gwen was staying at cost, perhaps you see a different bunch of addicts.",1086566400,2,859,4.584415584415584

She tackles a very sensitive subject head on in this film and really shows a side of her talent that is incredible. Of course, she has a superb cast behind her including Steve Buscemi and an always great Viggo Mortensen.

It's not easy to play a believable addict without resorting to over-used Hollywood cliches, and she plays it well without overdoing it.  A few nice examples are the sugar-addiction that most addicts experience when giving up the drug of choice.  The gum-wrapper chain was also very close to the truth.  That nervous ""sober"" energy needs to be used up somehow!  I was married to an alcoholic and everything she went through looked very familiar to what my ex-husband experienced.

The only special feature I enjoyed was the Moment By Moment featurette, although it repeated quite a lot of the film. The film itself. It doesn't sound like a rehash of Girl Interrupted, but I think it was. Girl Interrupted is a modern day One Flew Over The Cuckoo's Nest, and 28 Days is a rehab version of Girl Interrupted.

After ruining her sister's wedding, during which she crashes a car into a house, Gwen is sentenced to 28 days in jail - or in rehab. Now try to remember all the cheesy stuff Hollywood had ever taught us about rehab - and that would probably describe the rest of the film.
So why the 5 starts? Because even with all this gooey cheese, the movie does have a few shining moments. One of the issues that isn't obvious in the first watching is how sheltered the addicts are in the clinic, and how tough it is for them to sometimes deal with the outside world as ex - addicts. There's a scene where a mother has to face her 2 kids in 'family sessions', and she is torn between being their mother who wants to encourage them to speak, and having to deal with her feelings about what they say. Gwen also has a tough decision when she gets back home - whether to rejoin her boyfriend and her old crowd. On another occasion, Eddie, a big baseball star, is glad to have a few minutes' reminder of his previous fame and glory by giving a couple of kids who recognized him an autograph, but is uncomfortable when they ask him where his car is (having arrived in a bus with 'Rehab Center' written all over it).

She makes any movie she's in worth seeing.  Examples-- I visit my mother for the holidays a few years ago and she wants to see Miss Congeniality and it turns out I liked it a lot.  Go to a friend's house and she wants to watch Hope Floats on TV and I end up glued to the screen.  Put any other actress in movies like these and I probably don't like them.  28 Days is no different.  I never thought Bullock would be believable as an addict but she portrayed the desperation and regrets of an addict and the struggle an addict faces for hope beautifully.  Plus, the supporting characters in the movie were great.  Just like every Bullock movie, there's a scene that seems a bit over-stated or goes beyond believability (who would put up with the way Bullock was acting at the wedding?) but I guess they have to do that to quickly advance the plot of the movie.  This isn't an academy award winning type of movie but it's entertaining and you get a glimpse into addiction.

The story focuses on Gwen (Sandra Bullock) an alcoholic journalist who wrecks a limousine at her sisters wedding and is sentenced to 28 days in a rehab center where she meets a wide variety of people. One might ask themselves, where is the fun in that? However in the hands of director Betty Thomas (Dr. Dolittle) a wonderful quirky comedy/drama is created. When people are uncomfortable and vulnerable it is a human tendency to deflect those feelings with humor. That is what we see here, a wide variety of people who need help with a multitude of problems. Each person uses humor in a different way to cope with what is going on in his or her lives. However, Thomas is careful not to go overboard, and she adds plenty of emotional scenes to balance out the movie. This is after all about rehab and the seriousness of addiction, and Thomas never trivializes the subject. In fact she, along with most of the cast, spent time at an actual rehab center in order to portray the experience as accurately as possible. By walking that fine line between comedy and drama, Thomas has created a group of people that you genuinely care about without pitying. In today's cynical world, that is quite a feat

1356667,3,B00004UEDQ,"The previews, at least the theatrical ones, for 28 Days are misleading. They put the emphasis on its comedic moments. The movie is actually a drama, a cautionary tale about the toll substance abuse has on one young woman. Because the character is rescued before she hits bottom or does anything she will forever regret, the humor has its place here.
Sandra Bullock is Gwen Cummings, a writer who loves to party. She lives with an Englishman named Jasper [Dominic West], who makes the perfect playmate. They drink, they go out to dinner, they drink some more, they go dancing, they go home and drink even more. When they can remember, they pop a few pills to make things even merrier. One night they light some candles to enhance a lovemaking session. In the process they nearly burn their apartment down. Things come to a head when they arrive late and higher than kites at her older sister's wedding. Gwen ruins the special day, then commandeers a limo, wrecks it and winds up in jail. The judge gives her a suspended sentence but orders her to go to a rehab center. Typical of an addict, Gwen minimizes the extent of her problem. She does not think she needs to be in the center because she believes she can give up her habit on her own. She is in for some surprises, not all of them pleasant.
I will admit that Ms. Bullock is not one of my favorite actresses. She's fairly lightweight. I've also never seen much chemistry between her and her costars when she's chosen to do romantic roles. She has her good points. Off screen, she is a great businessperson. In a movie like 28 Days, she is not afraid to be seen looking unglamorous, and this does lend credibility to her performance. She is also wise enough not to try to dominate a picture.
There are two fine supporting actresses. Elizabeth Perkins is convincing as Gwen's sister, who has spent a lifetime rescuing Gwen and is sick of it. Azura Skye is touching as Gwen's young roommate, Andrea, whose problems are quite serious.
The depiction of a rehab center here is a very Hollywood vision. Most of the patients are stereotypes of what addicts are like. Still, 28 Days is a likable movie, and it does provide a message. For more accurate portrayals of drug and alcohol addiction, I would recommend Postcards From the Edge and Girl, Interrupted. Two of the finest films on the subject are much older - The Lost Weekend [1948] and The Days of Wine and Roses [1962].",1016409600,22,2422,4.570114942528735

1356674,2,B00004UEDQ,"**1/2  There comes a time in the career of every performer identified mainly with lightweight romantic comedy roles to take the plunge into more serious acting challenges - in the hopes that we will see beyond his or her pretty face and into the heart of the great actor that resides within.  And strangely enough, many of these actors and actresses choose the same exact route to accomplish this feat - that of portraying a person heavily addicted to drugs and/or alcohol.  This was the case with, for instance, Meg Ryan in ""When a Man Loves a Woman"" and Michael J. Fox in ""Bright Lights, Big City"" to name just a few.  Now we have Sandra Bullock attempting to stretch her thespian muscles by portraying an alcoholic in ""28 Days,"" the tale of a young woman's experiences in a detox center located in a bucolic suburb of New York City.
One of the initial problems with such films is that casting such well-known faces in these parts automatically ends up conferring a bit too much glamour on the situation.  And ""28 Days"" is no exception.  It's hard to accept Bullock as a particularly credible person in this role.  Still, the movie is generally watchable because it manages to make the people and the rituals at the center seem both utterly addled and emotionally endearing all at the same time.  When Bullock - feisty, close-minded, smug in her sense of superiority - first arrives after being ordered to the center as a part of her probation, we are as appalled as she is by the touch-feely nature of what is going on there.  If anything could keep one from becoming an addict, the threat of being sent to a place like this would just about do it.  But then, as the various characters begin to open up and reveal themselves as true hurting individuals, we, like the Bullock character, begin to be won over.  But even these people aren't given enough screen time to really grow into fully-rounded, complex characters in their own right.
The film never entirely breaks out of its TV-movie formula.  We are treated to all the standard plot devices common to the genre:  the inevitable overdose by one of the patients, romantic interludes with a professional baseball player, the clashes between the latter and Bullock's troublemaking boyfriend.  One of the problems with glossy studies of addiction such as this one is that, more often than not, we are led to believe that the ""cure"" is a permanent one - not necessarily because the film shows us that (in fact, it makes a few nods in the direction of showing that it ISN'T always permanent) but because the two-hour time frame and the audience demand for a hopeful, upbeat ending inadvertently leave us with that impression.  To be fair to the film, it doesn't tie up all the loose ends into a nice pretty package.  We are given cause for hope, but the open-ended nature of the final scenes suggests properly that the struggle will go on.
""28 Days"" is a film with its heart in the right place.  In fact our own hearts go out to it, to Ms. Bullock, to all those involved in its making.  We realize that it is difficult to make a film that, on the one hand, yearns to be an uncompromising study of a subject as gritty as this one, yet, on the other, feels the need to appeal to as wide a mass audience as possible.  The result, unfortunately, is a film that is too lightweight to be taken seriously, too ""entertaining"" to be real.",991008000,4,3380,4.55702479338843

Adorno saw a lack of movement found in Jerry Seinfeld's cynicism about his friends' very ability to have meaningful lives, and this lack of movement exists in 28 Days.
28 Days is a disservice to people in recovery from alcohol and drugs.  Because of its deep structure it may itself cause people to relapse.
The most amusing part is the first five minutes in which Ms Bullock (an appealing *gamin* with an attractive vulnerability) trashes the wedding of her uptight sister in the company of her drunken boyfriend (apparently an Aussie, Brit or Kiwi who is later punched-out in good old Americano style by a more sober chap.)
Like old Three Stooges comedies in which the Republican dowager gets a pie in her face as a protest of real inequality (for in 28 Days, a dowager gets the canapes on her derriere), 28 Days cynically exploits real, if buried anger, against a classist binarism in which one is EITHER a free spirit, but economically disadvantaged, OR a sober resident in an ""upscale"" community.
This is hegemonic for it equates spiritual recovery, and salvation itself, with a nice car and house as trashed by one's daemonic, but salvageable, kid sister.
Missing is the very possibility that alcohol and drugs enforce for material reasons (known as ""protecting one's supply"") a great deal of highly conventional behavior, and that recovery can involve downward mobility.
So attractive is the liberation of the first five minutes that many people in recovery may turn off the new DVD player after Ms Bullock trashes the wedding, go to the nearest bar, put The Clash on the juke-box, and get well and truly wasted.
Recovery is not a matter of images but of texts. It is no accident that recovering people talk amongst themselves and read books, rather than watch videos.  As the movie cleverly portrays, the very chemical effect of alcohol, its destruction of short-term memory, causes life to degenerate into freeze frames, at first snapshots of liberation, later on, of horror.
Anne Wilson Schaef has called aspects of our society, as replicated by the Hollywood dream factory, addictive, and the best movie about alcoholism (The Lost Weekend) failed at the last minute; for in the novel on which The Lost Weekend was based, the hero does NOT recover, whereas Ray Milland appears to.  28 Days is in the tradition of this dishonesty and in my (layman's) opinion, anybody who watches this film in early recovery is in danger of a slip.  People without addictive tendencies and people with a year of sobriety will be mildly diverted by Sandra's adventures, even in the rather boring recovery home (a home which, it should be noted, is completely unavailable to most addicts and alcoholics.)",985996800,4,3103,4.957692307692308

1356679,4,B00004UEDQ,"28 Days
Score: 72/100
Boy, it has been some time since Sandra Bullock has made a good movie. Speed 2: Cruise Control and Forces With Nature were both serious flops with critics around the globe, and she hasn't been very well respected for a long time. But, this will be the film that puts her on track. 28 Days is a well-made and thought-provoking film that is much better than it looks, and it deserves a wide audience.
Gwen Cummings (Sandra Bullock) is a New York writer who just can't say no to drink or drugs. After crashing her sister's wedding car and ruining her wedding cake, Gwen is ordered into a rehabilitation centre, where she spends the next 28 days. At first she doesn't have much respect for the centre and tries to escape, but as her toxic levels come down, she gradually realises that maybe she can turn her life around.
The plot may sound lousy, but it isn't. It deals with human emotions properly and in a moving way, and 28 Days is able to put a smile on your lips and make tears come out of your eyes. Bullock is a stunner in this film, she is perfectly cast as Gwen, while Steve Buscemi is as brilliant as he always is, no doubt about that. Azura Skye, who co-stars as a friend of Gwen's, lights up the screen in an ignored performance which deserves praise. Susannah Grant, scriptwriter, seems to have a thing for making good actresses come back to their great standards. In the same year of release as 28 Days, Grant wrote Erin Brockovich, a brilliant legal drama that made Julia Robert's get the career-best nod. Now she can fix Sandra Bullock, and this could very well be Bullock's best film.
It has it's problems, some major ones, but 28 Days remains a worthy watch for all ages.",984787200,2,1707,4.439490445859873
1356680,4,B00004UEDQ,"This was a rental, and it was a pleasant surprise, as this film seemed to have not done too well at the box office. Sandra Bullock proves why she's one of Hollywood's top actresses -- she can act and people like her! She always seems to saturate her performances with sincerity, inviting audiences to relate to her characters, and it's no exception with Gwen. She's convincing and humourous as the alcoholic-in-denial, and we watch her come to terms with her addiction as the film progresses. Azura Skye also turns in a strong and sympathising performance as the drug addict who befriends Gwen. Viggo Mortensen, who was wonderful in A Perfect Murder, turns in a good performance; unfortunately, his character, Eddie, is underdeveloped, and one wonders why he's in the film to begin with. But despite that, the film is pleasant. It's not earth-shattering or a must-see (the ending is rather predictable), but it's a lot better than what else is on Blockbuster's shelves.",983318400,2,969,4.950920245398773
1356681,3,B00004UEDQ,"The movie starts out with an interesting setup. Gwen Cummings (Sandra Bullock) is a young woman with an obvious alcohol problem. After a night of drinking, she wakes up late to her sister's wedding. She spends the entire time going to the wedding drinking and ultimate ruins her sisters wedding by falling in the cake and then wrecking the limo going to get another one. For her actions, she is given a choice of rehab or jail. She chooses rehab.
Interesting film with some great acting. However, the plot twists are a bit contrived. At first, she is just doing time, but, in a moment of insanity realizes that she needs help and begs to stay.
From then on, her turnaround, from doing time to cooperative inmate, is almost on the verge of miraculous. And, this is where certain parts of the plot stop working and break the illusion created by an otherwise excellent film. This is not all that bad, but a bit more work on the script, and this could have been an award winner.
If you have ever read Syd Field's book Screenplay, you can see the plot devices coming out. From lifting a horse's hoof to possible rehab romance, this movie is formula all the way.
But, it works. Somehow, through all of the veneer created, a touching story shines through. If you decide to see this one, don't expect another Sandra Bullock comedy. While there are some funny moments, the tragedy of the characters' problems overshadows most of the humor.",982540800,3,1430,4.6117647058823525
1356682,2,B00004UEDQ,"My actual rating for this film would be 2.5 stars.
  The film was based on a woman who was sentenced to an Addictions Center by the Court. The most talented actor in the film, Steve Buscemi had a comparitively small roll.  You tend to want to compare it to Michael Keaton's 'Clean and Sober', but in reality there is no comparison which is disappointing. All in all a very forgetable film. The Theatrical trailers had little to offer as far as insight.  Just Actors and Directors patting each other on the back.

1356684,3,B00004UEDQ,"All in all, this movie had some interesting insights into the world of acoholism, which I think were candid, honest and well-thought-through. It had all the markings of a great movie - solid cast, interesting premise... but it really didn't live up to its promise as a ""great"" movie.
Essentially, the movie fizzles at the end. It takes, the safe, predictable road. I don't think a recovering alcoholic really gets to wrap up conflicts with pretty little ribbns like that. And  c'mon: An alcoholic who doesn't care about anybody and doesn't think she has a problem goes into rehab? You already know what's going to happen! And to use Steve Buscemi (I'm a huge fan!) in such an uninteresting way (re: a rather boring guidance counselor) is a travesty. Mr. Buscemi must have been returning a favor by doing this one.
In short, it's probably worth watching if you're a Sandra Bullock fan, but don't expect to be blown away.",980467200,4,919,4.74375
1356685,3,B00004UEDQ,"I didn't want to see ""28 Days"" in which Sandra Bullock plays a writer with a pill and booze problem sentenced to rehab.  Much of the film - in which Bullock is the only really recognizable face - seems to be what I expected, but I enjoyed it despite myself.  Surviving what could have been a fatal DWI accident, Gwen is sentenced to Rehab in some upstate facility that seems pretty nice to anybody not in immediate need of chemical stimulation.  Cigarettes are about the closest items of sin permitted, and even they're subject to war-time rations.
The directors keep the focus on Gwen, Sandra's charachter, but they compensate by restraining the urge to reduce her fellow patients into one-note charachters good only for comic relief.  Some of the best charachters seem both funny and sad at the same time.  Gwen's need for perpetual stimulation stem, not suprisingly, from her mother, a manic alcoholic in her own day.  Flashback scenes in which a younger Gwen and Mom sled down snowy hills would seem hysterical, that is until the moment we see the oncoming cars.
Gwen's and her friends' addictions come in all different categories - though most seem to share shameless addictions to simple things like ""Santa Cruz"", a vile soap opera, fatalism and a brooding unwillingness to admit their problems.  The challenge of the story is getting past the obvious addictions to the ones that really make these charachters weaker people but stronger charachters.  For Gwen, the addiction is to anything that keeps the world from slowing down enough to reveal its bleakness.  When Gwen's mother took a break from the party, she could be found napping on the kitchen floor, dreaming of a liver that worked.  Robbed of her pills and her beer, Gwen handles the slowdown of withdrawl badly.  Breaking her leg, Gwen wakes in the Clinic's infirmary, looking at her own reflection as if it were a stranger's - she looks ugly!  If they could hand out Oscar's for the best split second of self-realization, Bullock would win for that moment alone.",979603200,3,2030,4.835260115606936
1356686,3,B00004UEDQ,You won't want to go into rehab after you see this movie. The girl next door is a boozer and she breaks her sister's heart. She learns that her friends are her fatal flaw and her character is all that can save her. I've never been to rehab but I know the power of faith and the value of relationships with quality people. Weak people tend to become the kind of people they hang around with. This movie trys to say that change can only come from within if it is supported externally.  It's too bad they don't get into the value of character.,978220800,,540,4.1923076923076925
1356687,5,B00004UEDQ,"Sandra Bullock, with a few exceptions, has a tendency to star in movies that don't quite make it.  And this is one of them.
BUT, I was immediately and strangely moved by the story.  Maybe I was just in the right mood at the time.  I cannot remotely identify with the situation - alcohol and drug addict confined in rehab - and cannot vouch for the reality of what takes place.  But it seemed real, even that I might think and act like her in that situation.  Her feelings felt like feelings I have had.
To her character, Gwen, the counselors and her fellow addicts in in-patient rehab are weird.  I thought so, too.  She complains about ""romper room philosophy"" attempting to address very real, adult struggles.  I detested it as well.  She thinks her family doesn't understand.  They don't.  She resents being treated like a child by the employees.  I would, too.  But if this is an example, addicts need to be treated like adults with childish behaviors.  I wondered if such an artificial setting could help an addict overcome a problem that might very well still exist in the ""real world.""
By the end of the movie, Gwen is on a path that can lead to sobriety, almost, it seems, in spite of these weird people and inane platitudes.  I'm not even sure what the turning point for her was, and perhaps there was no single turning point.  It isn't usually that easy.  She has learned to care about the people and care for their struggles, and thus care for her own.  She begins to see beyond the simplistic chants into truths about her lovability, capability, and strength.  She has turned her back on her destructive past and embraced a sober future that seems possible and desirable.
No excuses for addiction are proffered in this film, even though the presumed origin of the character's addiction is presented.  It is demonstrated that a person in the same situation did not resort to drugs and alcohol to drift through life.  The movie's premise is very simple: one person's handling of her self-destruction and renewal.

The movie touches on the seriousness of alcoholism, but allows the comedic aspects to shine through. I would have liked to have seen Gwen's (Bullock) transition fleshed out more-- we get flashbacks instead of actual discovery-- and some of the characters are *too* stereotypical.

1356689,4,B00004UEDQ,"Sandra Bullock is known for her roles as a cute and light-hearted but often troubled woman, always having to overcome an obstacle.  ""28 Days"" is another of these films with a role that seems made just for her, and she plays it very well.  This is the story of a woman (""Gwen"") driven to alcoholism and then drug addiction because of her unstable childhood with a mother who died early from the same addictions, a father who was never there, and a perfect and overacheiving sister she could never live up to.  To avoid going to jail, ""Gwen"", as Sandra's character in the movie is called, has to spend 28 days at a rehabilitation clinic.  I only gave this movie four stars because certain aspects of it became annoying to me: the overdramatic depiction of the cheesy rehabiliation clinic and the residents there, the plot's fascination with a fictional soap opera, Santa Cruz, and an underdeveloped and quite irrelevant subplot of a mini-relationship forming between Gwen and a famous baseball player at the clinic.  However, the rest of the movie was great.  The plot, which one would expect to be hackneyed because of all the movies and books dealing with the subjects of alcoholism, drug addiction, and recovery, is pretty fast-paced and fresh.  Sandra acts the part very well, and the struggle of recovery is portrayed fairly well also.  I found myself rooting for the characters to beat the odds and finally kick their addictions, and of course for Sandra to turn out all right as well.  The subject of this film is a dreary one, but there are humourous parts injected at just the right times to keep it from becoming too heavy and depressing.

like the classic 'the bell jar' and, more recently, 'girl interrupted', '28 days' explores the creative & sensitive mind of women who refuse to live life by any normal rules.
as a writer, i am always interested in watching movies about writers, but sandra bullock's creative outlet in this movie is more verbal and physical than written.  i would have liked to have seen her character creating something out of the madness that is alcoholism. instead, she's almost a bystander in her treatment program and we watch as she fights herself in a battle against alcohol addiction.
the supporting characters are what makes this movie great, including Loudon Wainwright III as the ""guitar man.""  his songs add a deeper, serious touch to this film and are, as always, fabulous.  if you're interested in hearing more from Loudon, check out 'career moves' asin:... be sure to see him in concert the next time he visits your city -- you'll laugh and you'll cry.  he's the greatest.

I also admit that the presence of Steve Buscemi would save any movies from total oblivion. He is silently becoming the best american actor in activity.
I also liked a lot director Betty Thomas's sense of humor which was already patent in PRIVATE PARTS. Alan Tudyk's performance as well as the episodes of the soap opera Santa Cruz could be the only reasons to rent 28 DAYS if you're a Bullockphobic.

1356692,3,B00004UEDQ,"Sandra Bullock gives an outstanding performance in this story about alcohol and drug rehabilitation.  Unfortunately, the presentation of the story was lacking and it detracted from the film's overall effect.  Director Betty Thomas and writer Suzannah Grant (who scored with the screenplay of ""Erin Brockovich"") can't seem to decide whether they want the film to be a zany comedy or a serious drama.  They seem to have been aiming for a bittersweet comedy, but they missed the mark.  They trivialized the good dramatic elements of the story with numerous inane scenes, many of which were more ridiculous than funny.  The film also suffers from an excess of clichs, some overemphasized to the point of being moronic.  It is difficult to take much of the story seriously with all the foolishness that is continually erupting.  The result of this directorial miscalculation was that the film was hammered at the box office, with the gross ticket sales failing even to match production costs.  That's a pity because a lot of people missed an excellent dramatic performance.
Sandra Bullock was a ray of sunshine that burst forth from this otherwise jumbled mess.  Sandra simply out-acted and outclassed the entire cast and did a terrific job despite the ""nutty institution"" approach.  This is something of a departure from her accustomed romantic comedy roles.  She had a chance to flex her dramatic acting muscles here, portraying a very confused and distraught character.  She went from the highest of highs to the lowest of lows and handled the full range of emotions beautifully.  It was one of the most complete dramatic performances I have seen from her to date.
I rated this film a 6/10 on the strength of Bullock's portrayal.  Without her, it would have been about a 3/10.  If the topic had been treated more seriously, with sensitivity to the nuances of drug rehabilitation rather than having a good laugh at their expense, it would have been far more powerful and effective.",971654400,,1978,4.987804878048781

After ruining the wedding cake, stealing a limo, and plowing into a house, she is sentenced to 28 days in a rehab clinic.
It is here that we are slowly exposed to the ""real"" Gwen, the one that is hidden under the haze of alcohol and drugs.  Sandra Bullock gives the performance of her career in showing Gwen slowly realizing that she needs help and that, if she only reaches out to those around her (not only her co-rehabs, but her family as well), they will be glad to help her.  We see her trying to hold onto her independence while, at the same time, trying to establish a link with those around her.  This performance is only aided by the great supporting cast.  None of the supporting characters are thoroughly fleshed out, but the actors portraying them give us enough of a glimpse that their presence only makes the film stronger.

But there is just something about her that exudes ""next-door"" charm, whether or not she supports the label's  overuse. Maybe it's because she's such a gem of a person, especially  compared to the coldness of many of today's big stars.
So when you are  about to see this film you will anticipate that it be light-hearted, not  serious, in other-words, totally Sandra.  But the only thing light-hearted  about the movie are the circumstances several of the supporting cast  members get themselves into. Sandra plays this alcoholic with all of the  angst she's got. And it's a heck of a lot more than anyone would have  pegged her for.
So is she depressing to watch like this? Yes and no.  Depressing because, based on those nasty preconceptions us lazy viewers  have, you're waiting for her to jump out and say ""Just kidding!""  throughout the movie - her usual style - and, to everyone's surprise, she  really doesn't.  She gives every ounce of credibility and intensity to a  role that many would like to write off simply b/c it is too hard to change  one's preconceptions.
I am so excited when I stumble upon a performance,  such as this one, that allows me to deepen my respect for an actor.  Sandra  has deepened everyone's respect with this role.  She is a consummate  professional actress: She plays every role as if it were herself and only  herself on the screen.
