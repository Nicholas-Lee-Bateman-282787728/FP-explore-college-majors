I have all the Charles Paul Eisenmann dog movies and series I can get my hands on, this from TV broadcast tape to bootleg dvds. Now to have a dvd with great vid and sound was a long time coming and is a top shelfer. Hopefully one day to get  ""My Dog, Buddy"" and the full  The Littlest Hobo 1960's TV series on
dvds ( Blu even better). London and his family were the smartest best trained dog actors, the movies are always rewatchable. I have all the Lassie (almost a tie, ever enjoyable), Benji , Rin Tin Tin ( the first one ) and even Strongheart that I can get but London is a god of dogs, just don't give him a shotgun.",1456617600,3,745,4.027027027027027
7575806,5,B019HOVT0Y,"I've loved this film as long as I can remember. Watching this disc, the ending still tugs at my heartstrings.
It's a good vanilla release (film only, plus piracy warning). The picture is clear, the sound is crisp and film is uncut. The print used appears in excellent shape with minimal scratches or other artifacts after nearly 60 years.
After loving this film for so many years, I'm very happy to see this release.
Addition: I've seen copies recorded off broadcast & cable TV. Those are 4:3. This release is 16:9. Also, this IS a DVDR, but looking at the way it's put together, you'd be hard pressed to tell.",1452124800,5,610,4.554545454545455

8745277,5,B019HOVT0Y,"If you're looking for a wholesome and heart-warming little movie for kids of all ages, here's a cold wet nose.  It's the story of a dog with the mind and soul of an angelic being who rides in a boxcar to his next destination, disembarking to help humans and fellow animals alike.  In this adventure, he guides a less-than-cooperative lamb to escape a slaughterhouse, and wanders the seedier parts of 1958 Los Angeles in search of a lasting home for his woolly friend.  The creep at the slaughterhouse accuses him of being a mad dog, so a police car is often in hot pursuit.  Their wanderings include encounters with predatory bums, lost men at a skid row mission, and wouldn't you know, the Governor and his crippled daughter.  There are even doses of humor, danger, and pathos, with the magnificent German Shepherd billed as London performing hundreds of clever and touching actions.  I guarantee you will be in love with this hound after seeing this movie, which spawned two successful television incarnations.  Wonderful, small-combo music score by the maestro of low budget films, the talented Ronald Stein.",1468886400,3,1111,4.909090909090909
8745278,5,B019HOVT0Y,"This movie is about a German Shepherd (Hobo) who travels on the freight trains as a hobo. Hobo travels from town to town and stays for a bit before he moves on. In the current town, Hobo becomes aware of a boy from a boys home who has to give his pet lamb to the slaughter house. The boy leaves in tears and the Hobo comes to the rescue and absconds with the lamb to save it and give it back to the boy. But that doesn't quite happen. The dog growls at the slaughterhouse man and jumps on him pushing him down and he runs off with the lamb. The police get involved, Hobo is labeled as a vicious dog and the pursuit is on. The Governor's daughter gets her father involved all come to a wholesome conclusion.

This was a B movie that was a staple of matinees and drive-in fillers back in 1958. The dog is actually London who was owned and trained by Charles ""Chuck"" Eisenmann. London supposedly knew over 500 words and could do several other tricks that amazed countless audiences.

I've loved this movie since the first time I saw it on TV. Many parts were chopped for TV broadcasting so I've missed many parts. To finally see the movie as it was originally made, brought back many memories.",1461196800,4,1190,4.2844444444444445
