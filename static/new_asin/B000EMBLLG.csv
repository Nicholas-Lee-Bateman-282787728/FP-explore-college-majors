8111107,5,B000EMBLLG,"OUTSTANDING REVIEW, and you will not be disappointed.  Contrary to other reviewer, music was not my issue for purchasing this, it was for educational information, and incredible views that I could not get myself with my own video camera or still pictures.  BUY IT!",1189814400,2,264,4.9772727272727275
8111108,3,B000EMBLLG,"I picked up a copy of this DVD at the Postal Museum in DC and for the most part, it's informative and enjoyable. It seems to be slightly dated but the bonus material is nice. I would give it 4 stars but the cheesy soundtrack seems to have been composed on a $50 Casio keyboard by a high school student and soon becomes very annoying.",1171497600,6,333,4.138461538461539
