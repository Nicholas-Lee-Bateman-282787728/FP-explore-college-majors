8370172,5,B002H588LE,"THE 3 TAPE = about 3 hours, filmed in New Mexico at the NRA's 34,000 square mile facility.  Ron holds several national champion shooting awards.  His demeanor and ability to teach is outstanding.  I have watched my VHS so many times they are wearing out. I'm going to buy the DVD's.  I spoke to Mr. Avery twice when I bought these tapes about 10 years ago, and he was extremely nice.  Now (2013) he's joined forces with another high profile shooter (Travis Haley, formeraly of MAGPULL) and they are setting up a training schedule.

Bottomline is the Training Videos from Avery are outstanding.",1359590400,2,593,4.70873786407767
