1799867,5,B0000714EZ,"I first saw this documentary air on television. I knew then how important it was that I add it to my vast CD and DVD collection. The film itself is a brief but, informative look into a movement that was led by one of the greatest figures of our time. Just when I thought I knew everything there was to know about the life of Dr. King; along comes yet another documentary that contains a few interesting facts that I had no knowledge of.
Being a native of Birmingham Alabama, this documentary holds a personal meaning for me. This DVD chronicles Dr. King's journey from the streets of Montgomery Alabama to Birmingham Alabama where the heart of the civil rights movement unfolds with a realness never before seen in history. It also takes a look into his role in making a difference in the civil rights movement.
I'm buying it not only as a collectors item, but as a historical learning tool for my younger family members who have yet to know the sacrifices and trials of the man known as Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. A man who left behind a legacy of greatness. A great orator whose speeches will forever stand for all times. A leader who put himself on the frontline of a struggle which was met with great violence; only to preach ""non-violence"" to the people. I 'strongly' recommend this DVD to people of ALL races and backgrounds. For those who have seen other documentaries on Dr. King; some of the footage may seem brief by comparison, but those with little knowledge of Dr. King's life will be surprised, pleased, shocked, and informed.

1799868,2,B0000714EZ,"Do not purchase this DVD.  It doesn't even have the March on WAshington speech in its entirety.  I thought that it would be equal in quality to the ""Montgomery to Memphis"" documentary of which I have an old copy.  It wasn't even remotely close.  So take my advice.  Pass on this purchase and hope that some day there will be a DVD version of the original ""Montgomery to Memphis"" video.",1044316800,53,385,4.442857142857143
