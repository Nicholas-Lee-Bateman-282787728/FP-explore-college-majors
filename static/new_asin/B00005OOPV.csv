1641266,4,B00005OOPV,"It's really something to be able to compare the beloved cartoon of my childhood with the original (""Gatchaman"") and the update (""G-Force""). It's fascinating to see how Sandy Frank was forced to shred the characters and storylines to satisfy the censors and their ""protect the chiiiildruuunnn"" mania - and resulted in the abomination that was 7-Zark-7.
One problem - my DVDs came with absolutely no audio in the English language version of the ""G-Force"" episodes. And, since I don't speak Spanish or Portuguese, I had to return them. But I salute your customer services folks with their wonderful, prompt response.",1004918400,2,613,5.14
1641267,5,B00005OOPV,"Kudos to Rhino Video for bringing ""Battle of the Planets"" (and even more important, the original ""Science Ninja Team: Gatchaman"" episodes) to the American masses.
Those of us who grew up on BotP will undeniably get a massive dose of goose bump inducing nostalgia as the familiar Hoyt Curtain BotP theme begins and the sun rises behind the Earth during the opening moments of the show. It's as seminal a childhood moment for me (and many fans) as the signature intros to the Star Wars films.
That being said, BotP by itself has some rather dated elements. The obvious editing out of the violence from the original ""Gatchaman"" episodes is more obvious to today's viewer and there seems to be less and less tolerance for the American inserted scenes featuring 7Zark7 as the years go by. The result can often lead to confusing moments and inconsistencies in the stories.
But overall, much is still wonderful. The early 70's animation still looks good, the voice talents of Casey Kasem and company are top notch as is much of the music(even with those 70's grooves). For a trip down memory lane and a great introduction for the young ones, Battle of the Planets still brings a lot to the table and is highly recommended based on that(and a good reason to get the VHS versions if you don't have a DVD player).
What really makes these DVD's great however is the inclusion of the two corresponding Gatchaman episodes. Anime fans will not want to miss out on these as Gatchaman is one of the most influential anime shows ever. Contrasting them with BotP is fascinating and the episodes themselves are classic, introducing the team and the formula that will sustain 105 episodes. The print and the sound is decent for an old show and Rhino put alot of quality into the DVD menu's and interface. The bonus G-Force Guardians of Space episode is rather redundant but still presents a nice overview of the myriad incarnations that Gatchaman has gone thru here in America.
Thank you, Rhino, for bringing us BotP and Gatchaman and here's hoping for more volumes to come!",1004745600,4,2054,4.740223463687151
1641268,5,B00005OOPV,"Personally, if you're really interested in BOTP, then check out the BOTP episodes, but don't do yourself a disservice and skip watching the original, UNCUT, Gatchaman episodes. Don't expect to find any trace of the abominable 7-Zark-7 or his robot dog. And sorry, no Casy Casem either. Just pure Gatchaman in it's unbutchered form. This disc is a great example of what American companies will do to ""mainstream"" a foreign show for broadcast in the states. Check it out, these are a must have! Lets hope Rhino keeps up the great work.",1004313600,12,533,4.804347826086956
1641269,5,B00005OOPV,"I have very fond memories of watching this show when I was young.  I have watched the second volume these DVD's (not sure why it came out before the first) and it's still awesome. Each DVD includes two episodes of the the Sandy Frank episodes from the 70's, plus the original Japanese episodes with English subtitles and one episode of G-Force, the redubbing that was done, I believe, in the 90's. Lots of fun. Enjoy!",1004227200,,417,4.56
1641270,5,B00005OOPV,"Finally.....Battle of the Planets on DVD. Ah, life is indeed good. I haven't seen the original episode in 15+ years and I'm salivating just thinking about it. Sure, it was originally Gatchaman. However THIS was the show WE grew up on. With spectacular animation, incredible music, and emotional plots to boot Battle of the Planets created a lasting legacy now realized in the ultimate DVD format. I hope Rhino does it justice.",1002844800,2,426,4.930555555555555
1641271,5,B00005OOPV,"Why review? After seeing both BOTP and Gatchaman as a kid, it has been my favorite anime for years! Why they never released it years ago on video I don't know. Gatchaman is the most inovative story anime ever produced...awesome characters, excellent detail, great stories and the 1978 American version Battle of the Planets by Sandy Frank was a well done transition. I highly suggest this series for children and adults.",1002067200,,420,4.929577464788732

1641297,3,B00005OOPV,"When I came across these episodes in my public library, I was excited to relive my childhood.  I loved BotP and had a big crush on Jason when I was a kid (it didn't matter that he was a cartoon character).  I watched the BotP episodes and then watched the Gatchaman episodes. Wow, there was a difference! But most anime produced then and now weren't created for kids, but for young adults and adults. Robotech and Sailor Moon were both sanitized  for their violent and sexual content as well before making their US debut. I loved the Gatchaman episodes better and I was glad to view them before, now I will end up buying those episodes.  I also had a problem with the English audio track for the G-Force episode.  Don't people check these things before packaging them?  What happened to quality control? I would have scored it higher, if I hadn't seen the original and the G-Force audio wasn't bad.  I couldn't give it 2 stars because I've seen Eagle Riders.",1185753600,2,958,4.534883720930233
1641298,3,B00005OOPV,"Lots of other reviews here do an excellent job covering the content of this DVD.  I just wanted to mention that there is a slight technical problem with this DVD (and the rest of vols. 1-4).  The English language track on the G-Force episode is virtually inaudible, which is a real disappointment and knocked the DVD down a star.  I tried on two different players (Pioneer DV-626D and Playstation 2), and they both have the same trouble.  I even wrote in to Rhino's technical support and they kindly exchanged the discs for me, but sadly, the replacement discs are the same way.  I just wanted to put out the warning here.  The rest of the disc is fine and has great content - it's just that one problematic audio track.",1086566400,6,720,4.5
1641299,3,B00005OOPV,"When I first saw this for sale I was absolutely giddy with excitement.  One of the greatest shows of my childhood was now available on DVD!  I got it home and popped it in and...""I don't remember it being this lame?""  For what it's worth, there were some nostalgic moments.  One, was finally seeing my heroes in their colorful costumes saving the day and another was hearing Key-op talk in his very funny way, ""Brrrrrr-toot-toot!""  But after that I thought everything else was fairly second-rate.  It's amazing what glorious images I can conjure in my memory of this show, and how the reality of my adult perspective shatters all the charm it once held.  However, there are the ""Gatchaman"" episodes, which is the only feature of this DVD that saves it from being a complete failure.  While ""Battle of the Planets"" is broken up with freeze-framing and the intensely annoying 7-Zark-7 filling in plot holes with voice-over narration, not to mention his equally annoying companion 1-Rover-1 doing his side-show antics, the ""Gatchaman"" episodes flow more fluidly with more action and acceptable violence.  If I had known better I would have bought only the ""Gatchaman"" episodes.  It just fits the ideas better that they speak in Japanese.  I've seen enough Japanese animation to know that more things are possible in the hyper-reality of their highly creative shows than in the saccharin-based shows of America where the violence is tempered, if shown at all. Something that I recently noticed about world-wide animation is that virtualy all the characters are caucasian.  Being white, I guess I just never noticed.  Most Japanese animation, in particular, has a tendency toward white Americanized heroes.  It might be because we are the largest consumer nation in the world, but this is not a new trend.  Just like the cutting-edge animation from Japan like ""Final Fantasy: the Spirits Within,"" the show ""Battle of the Planets"" has an all-white cast.  It's just an interesting, cultural note, one that makes more sense these days than in days past.  Anyway, get the ""Gatchaman"" series on DVD if you must insist on purchasing anything for nostalgia's sake.  I got this out of a deep-seeded feeling of nostalgia, and I was disappointed overall.  Be careful.",1079395200,34,2252,5.005376344086022
1641300,5,B00005OOPV,"If you like the classic anime then these are the DVDs to get.  Ydo not just get Battle of the Planets version but also the Gatchaman & G-Force.  ALL THREE SERIES!!!!  I can't understand how anyone can complain.  Definitely one of the few classic series done right the first time.

1641301,5,B00005OOPV,"as an avid fan of anime, i watched the original epidsodes of captian harlock,cyborg 009, space cruiser yamato (star blazers for  the uninitiatied!) and gatchaman back in the day.
i was disgusted how american distribitors like sandy frank and saban (who aired gatchaman f1 as the kiddified eagle riders several years back) would butcher gatchaman from it's original content. at least carl macek allowed as much depth and violence in robotech as possibly allowed. same goes forsunbow's star blazers.
back to gatchaman or ""battle of the scammers"" this was not meant to be aired as some kiddy show but i guess frank tried to capatilize on the popularity of star wars at the time.
with goofy names like princess and the original jar-jar binks of
animation 7 zark 7 some poorly drawn r2 d2 ripoff. HA HA!
you must purchase this disc just to see what was left on the cutting room floor, contrasting of the three series; BOTP,G-FORCE AND GATCHAMAN.
there's one scene where mark/ken tries to rescue the captured astronauts, in the botp version; they weren't shown at the end but zark narrates; ""the astronauts have been rescued and are safe thanks to g-force, on the g force version; they were ""put to sleep/unconscious....and in gatchaman, they were killed by galctor/spectra but they're corpses were used to trap the unsuspecting leader of gatchaman.
casey kasem  and keye luke are very talented no doubt, but i wasn't happy with this shoody repoduction of one of the best classic anime series since mach go-go (speed racer).

1641302,5,B00005OOPV,"Even if you never watched Battle of the Planets, you should get this set just to see how vastly different the Japanese version was from the US version. It is jaw-dropping how much they felt the had to ""sanitize"" - things that Japanese children could handle, that US children could not.
[...]Both episodes on this DVD set are very eye opening, and would be a great discussion point for any aged viewer, to talk about just why those changes were made and if the awful stereotypes that resulted were perhaps worse than the ""violence"" they removed.",1054598400,3,544,4.677083333333333
1641303,5,B00005OOPV,I tell you besides DBZ G-Force is my all time favorite cartoon. It str8 brought back alot of my memories while I was little getting up in the morning getting ready for school. G-Force was the cartoon that made me fantasize about being a superhero. Then they brought back in 1994 on Cartoon Network. Then all of sudden it went off the air. G-Force is a cartoon I'll show my kids.,1049846400,,378,4.338028169014085
1641304,5,B00005OOPV,I was please to find out they re-released this on DVD. Brings back some of my childhood..,1042588800,,89,4.294117647058823
1641305,5,B00005OOPV,"Ohmigod!  I think I have died and gone to heaven watching this DVD.  I've been a G-Force fan for the last 10 years or so *ducks behind the computer as things are flung at her from all over cyberspace*.  Laugh all you want, it is definitely my favorite of the English versions, no stupid robots, no 'androids' that certainly look human to me, no flights to planets identical to the earth, etc....  And it kills me to see people rip it to shreds in all of their reviews!  Forget about BOTP!  I still don't get all the hype about it.  In fact I turned it off after watching what had to be ten minutes of new footage of nothing but a cheesy robot yammering on about stuff that certainly wasn't in either G-Force or Gatchaman (I guess someone stealing uranium was 'not appropriate' for a kid's show as someone just might die as a result *gasps of horror from parents everywhere*).  Seriously though, I wanted to cry when I saw what Sandy Frank did to this show!  Buy this thing for the Original!  BOTP fans find out what you've been missing all these years, G-Force fans rejoice in watching your favorite show whenever you want (there's one episode on each DVD)!  And even better, these things have the equivalent Gatchaman episodes!  Where else are you gonna find three versions of show you love on the same DVD?  You can always watch BOTP for a good laugh now and then, but take my word for it, stick to Gatchaman and if you want to hear it in English (i.e.  you can't handle subtitles)  G-Force is as close to an accurate translation as you're ever gonna get!
Just when I was about to give up hope that I would ever see G-Force on my television again it comes out on DVD!  And all you G-Force fans out there are gonna love Gatchaman if you don't already!  Buy it fool!  What are you waiting for?",1019088000,4,1793,4.349397590361446
1641326,4,B00005OOPV,"After years of waiting, ""Battle of the Planets"" has finally reached DVD! Now, you can re-live those weekday afternoons from the late 70's, when you raced home from school to catch the daring exploits of Ken, Joe, Jun....er....Mark, Jason, Princess, Keyop, and Tiny! (Yay!)
As you surely know, ""Battle of the Planets"" was the title given to Sandy Frank's re-working of the Japanese ""Gatchaman"" series. The violence of the original series was toned (way) down and new animation was made to compensate for the edits. In order to capitalize on the then-current Star Wars boom, ""7-Zark-7 (an R2-D2 clone) was created and appears in most of the new footage. ""Zark"" served as the team's coordinator, the show's narrator, and he would explain away plot holes that occurred due to the large amount of film that was trimmed away by the producers.
The picture quality of the Battle of the Planets episodes is very good! For a show that must have been mastered from 16mm prints, the images are fairly sharp and the colors are good. (In the 70's, syndicated TV shows were all 16mm - only networks used 35mm). Episodes that originally had teasers before the opening credits are complete with the teasers!
The production values of BOTP are quite high. Obviously, the producers spent a lot of money getting this show made.
The voice actors used in the making of BOTP were the best in their field at the time. Casey Kasem, Janet Waldo, Keye Luke, and Alan Young are all professionals and must not have come cheap. They handle the (sometimes silly) scripts very well and really enhance the series. Compare the voice work on this series to other shows of the same era (like Force Five) to see how good it is!
Another thing BOTP has going for it is the music. In addition to the original music composed for Gatchaman (by Bob Sakuma), Sandy Frank employed the services of Hoyt Curtin. Mr. Curtin, mostly known for his classic Hanna Barbera scores (like Jonny Quest & The Flintstones), composed BOTP's theme music and other incidental music cues used throughout the series. The fully-orchestrated scores are stirring and memorable.
Overall, this DVD set is a great value! In addition to two classic Battle of the Planets episodes, you get the original Gatchaman episodes the BOTP episodes were based on. You also get one episode of the mid-80's ""G-Force"" series. You can now see Gatchaman in all of its various forms!
The Gatchaman episodes are a nice addition to the set and really enhance the collection. As you obviously know, Zark is nowhere to be seen, and the stories tend to be more intense than the cleaned-up BOTP episodes. For someone who doesn't have warm and fuzzy memories of Battle of the Planets, you'll probably prefer Gatchaman.
Generally, the Gatchaman episodes look great, but there are a couple of problems with the presentation of them...
First of all, the mastering is a bit suspect in places. Some scenes appear dark and murky. While I expect less than 100% print quality for the 16mm BOTP episodes, Gatchaman was originally mastered in 35mm for Japanese network television, so the picture quality should be better. When Gatchaman was released in Japan on LD and DVD the transfers were excellent. I only wish Rhino employed the same quality control here.
The other weak aspect of the Gatchaman episodes is the English translation. While it does allow the viewer to follow the action fairly well, it seems more like a fan-produced work than that of a professional. The person who prepared the translation obviously had a good Japanese-to-English dictionary, but not a very good understanding of the Japanese language itself. As a result, the translation is stiff and unnatural. It lacks nuance and style. (There are also a few places throughout the episodes that weren't translated at all...)
The second ""bonus"" on each disk is one episode of the mid-80's version of Gatchaman, ""G-Force"". Unless this is the version you grew up with, I doubt you will watch it much. While the episodes themselves are less edited than BOTP, the production values are extremely poor. The voice ""actors"" used here are laughably bad and they seem genetically incapable of showing any kind of emotion at all. The ""music"" employed in this series sounds like it was composed by someone on a cheap Casio keyboard. And if you can't get enough of the show's monotonous electronic theme, you're really in for a treat - the same theme music is used throughout each episode...! Watching an episode of ""G-Force"" is like a stamina contest. Congratulations if you succeed!
... decry the Sandy Frank version of Gatchaman. This is unfair as Battle of the Planets and Gatchaman should be treated as different series. You will not enjoy BOTP if you keep comparing it to Gatchaman. Sure, lots of it was edited out. The new animation is crummy compared to the animation used in the original. The stories seem sometimes childish. But that's not the point. Battle of the Planets is a nostalgia treat for most of us who grew up during the 70's. Watching these DVDs is a real blast from the past and if you liked the show then, you will still like it now!",1015200000,6,5112,4.81683731513083
1641327,4,B00005OOPV,"Finally after first airing 30 years ago I get to see one of my favorite anime shows of all time...uncut!  To think I kept passing this DVD up because the thought of watching the butchered, 7-Zark-7 version would have made me sick to my stomache. Then finally I read the back. What? Original corresponding Gatchaman episodes? Yesss!
  Don't get me wrong, Battle of the Planets was good for introducing me to the Gatchaman series. But that's about it. The animation may look dated in comparison to todays anime, but understand that in 1972 when it first aired it was state-of-the- art. Don't beleive me? Another popular show that year was Mazinger Z (US Tranzor Z). Need I say more?
  Thank you Rhino for bringing this show to DVD and giving it it's just rewards. Now I can finally toss out my worn out, 3rd generation VHS tape. Keep em' coming!",1014595200,,843,4.593333333333334

From childhood, I had kept the G-Force flame alive, and told so many people about it, based on my experience of BOTP.  Now I got the package, and also another dvd on similarly themed material, I cannot stand BOTP, 7 Zark 7 or the robot dog, except for a wry laugh.
This is probably still great to show young children (I fell in love in the first run, around 8 years old), but the difference in story, and the quality of the the character development are all too apparent in the Gatchaman episodes (and the now embarrasing cover-ups of anybody actually getting hurt, or exactly which planet the action is taking place on =).

1641331,5,B00005OOPV,"I, with the other viewers, purchased the BotP DVD ready to expierence what I believed to be the best animated series of my childhood. Now, being an adult, I watched the video and noticed huge discrepencies in the flow and story-line--not to mention the graphically inferior and audibly horrendus 7-Zark-7 and his mut 1-Rover-1. The musical score was great, and gave me the chill bumps I was looking for...
But then, I looked at the special features. Innocently enough, I watched Gatchaman, the original uncut version of the series. My jaw hit the floor. The missing and confusing segments are all explained, without the zainy droids. In addition to more closely matching the Japenese culture (violence, adult themes, etc) I got a more omplete sense of the characters that I loved as a kid---now with its uncut glory.
In the end, you will buy BotP to relieve the series as an American child, but you will end up loving Gachaman because of the more complete and uncut story line.
Were I to review BotP ignorant of Gachaman, 3 out of 5 stars, mainly because $... is too steep for just 2 episodes. Having the Gachaman episodes makes it worth the price of admission. Don't worry, there's english subtitles for Gachaman.

1641332,5,B00005OOPV,"I ordered Vol. 1 of the ""Battle of the Planets"" DVD wanting to re-live some childhood memories of watching this show after school. It was nice to see the ""G-Force"" team in action after some 20 years. The episodes are great, that is until you watch the original ""Gatchaman"" episodes on which they were based. Then you realize just how much your childhood viewing experience was shortchanged.
  Put simply, the American version pales in comparison.  As a viewer, you will get to see just how how much drama, action and pathos were excised from these cartoons because of violence concerns by U.S. broadcasters. Many of those edited scenes were replaced with narration by ""7-Zark-7"", an ""R2D2"" rip-off created  to capitalize on  ""Star Wars"" which had been released a year or so earlier.  Watching some two decades later, you realize just how jarring this proved to the show's pacing. ""Gatchaman,"" however, moves at a more rapid clip.
  I almost forgot to mention, that ""Gatchaman"" was set on Earth and there were no 'battles' with other planets.  That said, you also realize just how awkward the premise of ""Battle of the Planets,"" was.  I gave the DVD 5 stars, but only for the ""Gatchaman"" episodes.",1006992000,12,1196,4.847290640394089

A show that I just couldn't get enough of and something to share with my kids. Sure 7-Zark-7 is campy beyond belief. But I don't mind. For now I will show kids the American version with it's more family ideals and when they are a little older they can watch whichever version they want.

Look no further than the title of the episode ""Rescue of the Astronauts,"" which was created from source material where the astronauts are hideously killed onscreen!  That whole scene gets excised, and instead there's just a shot of one character entering the Phoenix stating that the astronauts are rescued and safely aboard.  (If Sandy Frank showed ""Psycho"" on Television, he'd cut the shower scene and throw in some dialogue about how Marion has had to return to her home planet.)

If, like me, you're a forty-something who loved the BOTP show, it's going to be a bit jarring to you to see the original Gatchaman and realize:
* Zoltar is just an Earth-born threat.  Oh, and the lipstick is because there's a whole sexual thing that is unexplored in BOTP.
* The Phoenix never travels to other planets, which explains why all the alien planets would look like Earth, and why the space travel was just stars moving across the screen during some narration.
* Keyop isn't an android in love with a beautiful Earth girl. He's human and SHE'S HIS SISTER!  (Eww!)  All that bleep-blooping was probably a great way to cover the lips not matching the original dialogue.
* That guy in pink with a mustache is their actual leader, not 7-Zark-7.
* In case you were wondering why Mark had to throw that glinting sharp weapon so that the enemies can be knocked out by sonics...well, you're in for a shock.

Despite all the messing with the original, I still love BOTP.  I love Judy Jetson's voice as Princess, the character names, and some of the BOTP concepts, and more than anything I loved that MUSIC!  I tried watching the Gatchaman movie and it didn't have the same appeal.  I kinda wish there'd been at least one good adaptation of Gatchaman for American audiences, sans Zark and the intra-planet premise but with the same cast and voices...and Hoyt Curtin and Bob Sakuma's music.",1408233600,,2139,4.647214854111406
