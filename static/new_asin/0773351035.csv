7789289,5,0773351035,"""Rising Damp"" is the funniest British comedy I have ever seen. And if you can find this video buy it! It has in my opinion the best episode of the series ""The Good Samaritans"". All are great episodes but that is my favorite. Enjoy!",1038960000,,231,4.2727272727272725
7789290,5,0773351035,"If you've enjoyed the first two boxed sets of this hilarious classic, you'll not be disappointed with the the rest of the series.  The third boxed set contains six 25-minute episodes (the last episode from the second series and the first five episodes from the third series).  The episodes included are:  ""Things that go Bump in the Night,"" ""That's My Boy,"" ""Stagestruck,"" ""Clunk Clink,"" ""The Good Samaritans,"" and ""Fawcett's Python"".  If you already own the fifth boxed set, you may want to watch the Christmas Special after ""Things that go Bump"" as that is chronologically where it fits in.  Both of these episodes are the last to feature Brenda, with Miss Jones returning in ""That's My Boy"" for the third series.
As always, the episodes are all extremely funny, and I find I'm hard-pressed to pick a favourite.  (Perhaps I've just become more familiar with the series and the characters, but the series seems to get even funnier as it progresses.)  Certainly, two of my favourites are ""Things that go Bump"" and ""Stagestruck.""  Rigsby is never funnier than when he's a nervous wreck, and he's at his jittery best in these two.
In ""Things that go Bump,"" when Rigsby frightens Alan with tales of the ghostly grey lady who supposedly haunts the house, Philip and Alan decide to play a supernatural prank on him with hilarious results.  ""Stagestruck"" stars Peter Bowles (To the Manor Born, Rumpole of the Bailey) as Hilary, an out-of-work actor/playwright who's just written a new play.  Rigsby's quest for and jealousy of Miss Jones (Hilary's new leading lady) leads him to raise questions among the other tenants as to Hilary's sexual orientation.  Things backfire hilariously when Hilary finds out and decides to teach Rigsby a lesson.
In conclusion, I simply cannot recommend this series highly enough.  It is a true British classic.  Very highly recommended.",1011916800,4,1861,4.983818770226537
