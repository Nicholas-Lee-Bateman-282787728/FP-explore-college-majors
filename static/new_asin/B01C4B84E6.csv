8752165,4,B01C4B84E6,"The King and Country series includes the recordings of live-performances of four plays, i.e., Richard II, Henry IV part 1, Henry IV part 2, and Henry V. The performances have been recorded at the Royal Shakespeare Companys theatre in Stratford-Upon-Avon. The plays are incredibly entertaining, i.e., excellent acting, elaborate costumes, an impeccable stage design, fascinating fight arrangements, great sounds effects. Definitively, the Royal Shakespeare Company deserves five stars for its effective use of their resources and props in its attempt at presenting the sequel of the History Plays. But does such an excellent container match up with the quality of the content that is conveyed within? First, lets outline the overall structure of the History Plays as this will provide us with the context for this review.

The History Plays illustrate England as a being that goes through seven stages of transformation. Each stage is associated with one of the seven kings, i.e., King John, Richard II, Henry IV, Henry V, Henry VI, Richard III, and Henry VIII. The King and Country, therefore, addresses the middle part of this sequel. It may help to understand these plays to note that the entire sequel and its outcome were symbolically alluded to in the procession of kings in the witches prophesy inserted in Macbeth. The procession of the kings provides a link between the 11th century Scotland presented in Macbeth (a stage before the initiation of the process in England) and 16th century England (the outcome of the process).

In the History Plays, the king, members of his family and his courtiers represent various aspects of England. In each of the plays, there are only a few individuals who are aware of the concept of king, his role, and his function. Yet, they are confused because they are using artificial means to determine who the king is or who should be recognized as the king. Shakespeare clearly points out that these individuals do not have yet the capacity to recognize the righteous King. In Richard II, Shakespeare used the term the hollow crown to convey the difference between the King and a king. The crown is hollow or empty because the state of King does not correspond to the person wearing it. According to Shakespeares presentation, the true status of King is not determined by the crown, but by the inner state of a person. It is the gap between the concept of King and the person wearing the crown that drives the plots of the plays. In other words, the History Plays are an illustration of the process that gradually leads to the development of true Kinghood. According to Shakespeares narrative, a true King could appear only in the presence of an active agent of the transformation process. This active agent is symbolically represented as love. It is quite apparent that Shakespeare intentionally did not include love in his History Plays. There is no falling in love in the History Plays. The arrangement of the marriages is driven entirely by ordinary political and strategic motives. Or as King Henry V put it when demanding Katherine to become his wife, She is our capital demand, comprised within the fore-rank of our articles. It is this feature, or rather the lack of it, which differentiates the History Plays from Shakespeares other plays. This is why a true King could not appear within the milieu presented in the History Plays. This fact is also alluded to in the witches prophesy where the line of true Kings is symbolically presented as a reflection in a mirror held by the eight king. It is in this context that the production of King and Country may be evaluated, i.e., how does it help the audience to grasp the meaning of Shakespeares narrative.

Of course, the director has the right to exercise his imagination and present his vision of the plays. But the question is: to what degree may the director change the original story in order to express his own personal opinions or beliefs? I would argue that it is a matter of sincerity and humbleness. Sincerity, because it is necessary to put aside ones personal opinions and biases; humbleness, because one is faced with an incredibly sophisticated and delicate instrument whose mode of operandi and its function have not yet been fully understood. Shakespeare is unique in the sense that his writings impact and stimulate specific latent layers of the mind. There is no other English playwright who used or even was aware of such a technique. Therefore, flouting with Shakespeares text is different than making modifications to any other playwrights text. Randomly simplifying the plot, making a story more plausible, or bending it to bring in some currently pressing issues - all these destroy the original function of Shakespeares plays.

""Richard II""
In his production of King and Country, Gregory Doran made a few significant alterations to the original text. For example, he attempted to transform Richard II into a sort of melodrama by making Aumerle into Richards would-be lover and then his murderer. This change corrupts the intended impact of the play. In his comment about the change, Doran explained that it was a coincidence that seemed to work for us but happened to not occur to Shakespeare. Really? Lets keep in mind that there is no remark or scene in the canon that is ever offhanded. Every episode, every scene, every name and every place fits perfectly into Shakespeares narrative. Shakespeare used a somewhat peculiar method in disclosing his narrative. Namely, he would insert odd details, seemingly meaningless episodes or scenes that might look like mistakes or errors. Yet, it is these seemingly ambiguities that are the key elements pointing the audiences attention towards Shakespeares narrative. He used these ambiguities as markers to guide the readers through his plays. At the same time, these ambiguities serve as traps for our thinking flaws. Those who are driven by flawed thinking patterns will disregard these markers and will not be able to recognize Shakespeares tale. Those, however, who are sincere enough to put aside their opinions and beliefs, are able to follow Shakespeares signposts and gradually perceive the fuller picture. Therefore, there is a simple criterion which helps to determine which interpretation of the plots is correct and which is not. Namely, the correct interpretation must fit into every other scene and episode. If it requires removal or modification of any other scene or episode, then such an interpretation is definitively incorrect. In the case of Richard II, Doran had to cut off the entire scene with Exton in the last act in order to fit his version of the plot. In Shakespeares narrative, the scene with Exton is needed as it parallels (and therefore provides insights into) the circumstances of the Duke of Gloucesters death.

""Henry IV""
Prince Harry is one of the key characters of the History Plays. His personal reformation is a crucial element of the process that the being of England is going through in the History Plays. Right at the beginning of Henry IV, Part 1, Harry discloses to the audience his plan and his strategy (I know you all). It is interesting to notice that Harrys approach follows the same strategy as his fathers. The difference is that Harry has to play both roles, i.e., his fathers and King Richard IIs. This is why, at the beginning, Harry somehow mimics Richards behaviour in order to establish a reference pattern for his future transformation. It is quite ironic that, later on, King Henry IV will bitterly scorn his son for this behaviour. Harrys aim, however, is much higher than his fathers. As England is going through the transformation, so Harrys reformation is part of this process. Harry does not wish to be simply a king; his aim is to become the King. He knows that if he is to achieve his objective he has to learn how to overcome his behavioural reflexes and, when needed, how to exercise ruthless (I am now of all humours). The following episodes illustrate the stages of his reformation. He is somehow cruel when he uses Francis to test how behavioural conditioning limits ones ability to progress (I will give thee for it a thousand pound: ask me when thou wilt, and thou shalt have it). In his comment about Hotspur, Harry indicates that he is still not able to be ruthless enough (I am not yet of Percys mind). This follows with Harrys rehearsal of banishing Falstaff (I do, I will). It is at this point that the Sheriff arrives at the Boars-Head Tavern in Eastcheap. The scene in which Harry confronts the Sheriff is simple and brief but an incredibly powerful demonstration of Harrys ability to switch into an authority figure. This is an important moment that marks the beginning of Harrys transformation. Yet, this crucial moment is killed in the RSC production by parachuting there the Lord Chief Justice and making Harry to slap him. The carefully designed process of showing how Harry has been working on his transformation is disturbed. This clumsy and ill-timed modification interferes with the flow of the play. To support this modification, the director has also changed the Lord Chief Justices line in the last act from and struck me in my very seat of judgment to and struck me in an Eastcheap tavern house. The episode of Harry slapping the Lord Chief Justice does not belong to this scene. This episode took place much earlier, i.e., when Harry was imprisoned for that offence. In the scene at the Boars Head, Harry is on his way to the war, therefore he could not be put in a prison at this time.

""Henry V""
Henry V illustrates the final stages of Harrys transformation. Harry, as King Henry V, faces formidable challenges on his way towards his goal. In the final scene Henry V marries Katherine, the daughter of the French King. The marriage reinforces the peace agreement between England and France. Shakespeare subtly points out, however, that the ultimate goal of England could not be achieved at this stage of the process. Definitively, Henry V became a great king. But he did not become the King. Shakespeares plays contain several layers. So far, scholarly analyses, movie and theatre productions have been concerned only with lower layers of the plays. The more subtle layers still remain invisible to rational intellects and psychology. These more subtle layers are indicated by a series of ambiguities that Shakespeare left unexplained in the play. Lets take as an example the scene with Pistol, the page-boy and Monsieur le Fer (Act IV, scene 4). In the RSC production, the page-boy and Monsieur le Fer are killed. Yet, in the original text Shakespeare does not tell us if Pistol followed the kings order and killed his prisoner or whether the page-boy was killed after his return to the camp. In this way Shakespeare draws the audiences attention to other details disclosed in this scene which are needed to reconstruct Shakespeares narrative. This is an example of Shakespeares method to help the audiences to recognize their intellectual and emotional reflexes which prevent them from perceiving the more subtle layers of the play. Lets recall that, in his St. Crispins Day speech, Henry V announced that he who fought with him in the Battle of Agincourt shall gentle his condition. We may notice that among those who took part in the battle of Agincourt, Pistol and the page-boy are the only characters who will reappear in another play. Only then the audience will find out why Henry V could not succeed with his ultimate goal of becoming the King and what role Shakespeare chose for the page-boy.

It seems that the recent productions by the Royal Shakespeare Company tend to flout with Shakespeares text. Lets keep in mind that, in their original and uncorrupted versions, the plays are as adequate to modern audiences as they were 400 years ago. Therefore, the plays do not need any improvement or modernization. What they do need though is their faithful and unbiased treatment. Therefore, I am looking forward to seeing the next RSCs productions of the remaining plays of Shakespeares narrative. Lets hope that instead of trying to improve plots, the RSC will use their remarkable resources to help the audiences grasp their meaning. Otherwise, the seemingly odd reappearance of Falstaff and his followers in The Merry Wives of Windsor will remain incomprehensible.",1465084800,20,12338,4.948866377231066
