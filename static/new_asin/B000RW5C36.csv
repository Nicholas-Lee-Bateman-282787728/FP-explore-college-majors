8202607,5,B000RW5C36,"This movie was pretty expensive when I bought it.  Came to like $32 or something, but I figured I was helping out an independent film, I had already watched it on Sundance and LOVED it...So worth it.  Everything came pretty quickly too.  Shipping was reasonable, I guess, but to me, packaging is key.  It came in a package just right for it's size.  BIG bonus.  I recommend this DVD for the story, cinematography, cast, location, everything...I give it two thumbs up!",1271203200,2,467,4.703703703703703

8202609,4,B000RW5C36,"excellent documentary.  as one other reviewer wrote, this is an opportunity to see a perspective from within Mexico for workers living there.

Soundtrack, particularly in the closing scene, is fantastic: I wish they would release it!",1229731200,4,233,5.444444444444445
8202610,5,B000RW5C36,"""In the Pit"" (En el Hoya) is an eye opener when you think your own life is tough.  The sound track is haunting as is the spirituality of Natividad as she talks about her experience with God and the Devil. My new hero is Shorty who apparently takes life as it is and keeps on going.  So many movies are about Americans getting in over their heads crossing the border into Mexico like the movie ""Rx"".  ""Babel"" shows the consequences of crossing the border illegally--even if it is years later.  I have never seen an account of the lives of workers within Mexico, who are not trying to escape to the United States, but are blooming where they are planted. I would never survive in the ""Pit"". These hard working people are in my prayers.",1219968000,,733,4.407407407407407

Based on the title alone, one might assume that ""In the Pit"" was a behind-the-scenes look at the fast-and-furious world of NASCAR racing.  In actuality, it's a modestly-scaled documentary about the building of a massive freeway overpass in highly congested Mexico City.  The ""stars"" of Juan Carlos Rulfo's film are the unheralded common workers without whose backbreaking labor - often performed at great risk to their lives and persons - such public-works projects could never be completed.

""In the Pit"" is a paean to all the blue-collar folk who generally receive scant recognition from either the movie industry or society as a whole for the important work they do.  Rulfo provides no voiceover narration, instead allowing the men to relate their life stories wholly in their own words.  They talk not only about their work but their outside lives and interests, occasionally launching into reflective commentary on life, love, poverty, religion, the state of the world in general and life in Mexico in particular (the irony is that, in the two-tiered economic system in which they live, many of the men who had a hand in building the bridge will never have occasion to use it).  But most of the time we see them simply going about their daily activities on the job, good-naturedly ribbing one another as only a tight-knit group of experience-sharing buddies can do. Rulfo obviously has a great deal of affection for these people, yet he neither romanticizes nor sentimentalizes them or their plight; they are always just ordinary guys trying to make their way in the world with as much honesty and dignity as their situation will bear.

Rulfo ends his film on a bravura high note of moviemaking skill: a stunning six-minute-long helicopter shot that swoops along the length of the freeway barely above the heads of the waving workers.  Beyond its own aesthetic value, the shot drives home the sheer technological impressiveness of what these hardworking, largely ""uneducated"" gentlemen have been able to accomplish - and the legacy they will have left behind.",1204156800,4,2072,5.052785923753666
