7771437,5,B01H0REHHC,"This was an Excellent show and I bet it didn't catch on wide enough because of the Name.
A lot of people would just be uncomfortable using the word ""Bastard"".  Not on the Coasts of
course, lol, but in the Middle of the Country.  Virtually any other name, imho, and this show
is still on TV.",1478476800,,290,4.160714285714286
7771438,5,B01H0REHHC,I cannot wait for season two! I loved sons of anarchy and I think that Kurt Sutter is a freaking genius and Katy Segal should win an award.,1476662400,,139,4.0

7771442,3,B01H0REHHC,"IMO The pilot episode should only get 1 star, but it is unfortunately necessary for backstory. Gets better from episode 2-end of series. Took off 1 star for the unnecessary overabundance of gore and 1 star for the poor camera angles/filming. Close ups - way too close, filming of fight scenes too ""chaotic""/hard to follow and the camera ""bounce"" was distracting (mainly in episode 1). Apparently the person filming the pilot and episode 1 had no concept of a tripod (at the very least), could not stand still and/or hold camera still in several scenes.  Gives the impression of a very low budget production. Fight scenes were much too focused on gore instead of the art of swordplay. But it does improve starting with episode 2. The unnecessary gore is still present at times but to a somewhat lesser degree and the story line is allowed to ""shine"" a little more - so to speak. The acting/writing of the series are both good but the gore factor takes away from this series to a large degree. Without the negatives mentioned previously, I would have given this 5 stars.",1472601600,4,1068,4.680851063829787
7771443,5,B01H0REHHC,It did meet my expectations. Loved it!,1472428800,,38,4.571428571428571

7771445,5,B01H0REHHC,"LIVE THIS SHOW!!! Can't believe it only lasted one season. I really didn't think I would have been able to find this, so I had kept the season recorded on my dvr, taking up space. So happy to find it available!",1472083200,,210,4.146341463414634
7771446,1,B01H0REHHC,I really enjoyed this series and could not wait until I could get it on DVD.  Was not able to watch right away and when I got to the 2nd disk - it keeps freezing and pixelating.  Unfortunately - it was too late to return it.,1471910400,3,224,3.847826086956522
7771447,5,B01H0REHHC,Love it.  Only wished they did a season two.,1471046400,4,44,3.888888888888889
7771448,5,B01H0REHHC,"Bastard Executioner is another in a nice list of period television programs.  Set in 13th Century Wales this is actually is good. Lee Jones stars as Wilkin Brattle, an extremist anti-king man who takes the identity, and family, of a man killed in battle. Brattle is both an uneasily accepted and only slightly willing executioner. Katie Segal, a hag/witch, Annora, must help Brattle as he plans his move against the king.

Acting is good, setting/scenery mostly gray, which is befitting of the dismal times and look of the area. Well worth watching and a second season.",1469404800,11,569,4.916666666666667

7771450,5,B01H0REHHC,"i haven't bought the season yet, because still to high for only one season made, but really loved this show. was definitely something abit different and the storyline just got going good, before they ended it and decided not to renew :( don't understand why they do this to so many shows yet some pretty stupid ones that lost their story line after a few years are still on for 10 to 12 yrs already",1467849600,10,398,4.32
7771451,1,B01H0REHHC,"No Subtitles! I assumed it would be subtitled for the hearing loss group as nearly everything is now, My hearing is impaired and I could not understand the womens voices and very few of the men, A TOTAL LOSS OF $,",1467763200,7,213,4.219512195121951

Don't know why it had to end..  Getting one season is a tease.",1466726400,4,74,3.933333333333333

8764333,1,B01H0REHHC,"Been looking for this series for awhile. Great story, too bad he didn't get to finish it. Very displeased on the product. Should have known for only 13 dollars. I highly believe It's a pirated copy! Isn't  that against the law. Popped it in...yeah it's pirated!!",1520726400,,262,4.695652173913044

8764335,5,B01H0REHHC,GREAT set. Wish it hadn't been cancelled !!,1516838400,,43,4.5
8764336,5,B01H0REHHC,"This was fantastic.  No one knows of it. I loved how it started, and the extra plot line about the book of the nazarene and the inquisition like villains. A bit gory, GOT on steroids, but it all works with the story, and the plot.  Seemed to wrap up at the end with no bitterness and no second season in mind.  I so glad it was suggested via amazon.",1508889600,,349,4.028985507246377
8764337,5,B01H0REHHC,great show to bad it got canceled,1503273600,,33,3.857142857142857
8764338,2,B01H0REHHC,"Definitely NOT a medieval ""Sons of Anarchy"", which was one of my favorite TV series. Watched first 3 episodes; very slow moving, acting only fair, confusing due to trying to incorporate several different plot lines along with the supernatural. Even Katy Sagal was not up to expectations; she came off more like a gypsy fortune-teller at a carnival rather than a powerful witch. From other reviews it supposedly gets better later in the series but I couldn't make it that far. Maybe I'll give it another try.",1501804800,,507,4.839080459770115
8764339,5,B01H0REHHC,I loved this show when it was on television!! So naturally it was a must to own this on DVD.,1496707200,,92,3.65
8764340,5,B01H0REHHC,"I'm sure that Mr. Sutter had to leave many stories in this series untold.  A phenomenal tale, written & acted well beyond what we have become accustomed to on today's television...  His decision to end it, while possibly justified by the hated ratings system, was a travesty.

Long live Ventrishire...",1494201600,,301,4.98
8764341,5,B01H0REHHC,Loved the show when it was on. I wish it was never cancelled,1491177600,2,60,3.6923076923076925
