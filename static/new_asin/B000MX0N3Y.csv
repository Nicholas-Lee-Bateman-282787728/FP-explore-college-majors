8173228,5,B000MX0N3Y,"Hope was the first album to be recorded at Hillsong's convention centre!!! With the state-of-the-art sound, lighting and media technology, this album is one of the world's advanced technology and sophisticated Christian Meetings in 2003, and you can't help but get impressed by the quality of this album!! In special features, you can watch the behind the scenes and watch Luke Irvine switch cameras in the song ""Can't Stop Praising""!! You can also watch the inspiration videos by clicking on the music note on the bottom right corner of the screen!! Also, this was the first album that Hillsong ever recorded with their own TV gear! The Hillsong team put a big screen outside for those who can't fit inside the new sophisticated convention centre so they can worship God and watch Darlene Zschech lead with the Hillsong team in the lawns!!! After the second night, Zschech led worship with a small team in front of the people who were watching the large screen outside in the lawns!!! This convention centre was opened by John Howard, the Prime Minister of Australia in October 2002!!! John Howard said in his opening address, ""It's a remarkable testimony that on a Saturday evening at 6:00, in a suburb of Sydney, you can gather a congregation such as this. Darlene Zschech also said a pray at the end of this album recording while Highest, one of my favorite songs in this album!! She prayed, ""Father God, we thank You for Your miraculous, miraculous healing power. We thank You Jesus for the price You paid on the Cross, so we can stand healed, healed in Jesus Name. We speak healing over our brothers and sisters tonight, healing in Jesus Name. Father God, from any disease--to cancer we speak Your life, Your breath, Father God, Your truth, Your Word in todays situation in Jesus Name. Let them rise up Father God, let them Rise up Lord Jesus, healed and whole, Lord God, let them go all over the world and preach the Gospel and tell the testimony of Your miracle working power in Jesus Mighty Name. Father God, we give You all the glory, we give You all the glory, we give You all the glory, we give it to You Lord Jesus. There is none like You God, there is none, there is none like You Jesus. Our hope, and our trust, and our security, and our faith is in You. It is in Your Name, it is in Your Word. We thank You God. We than You Lord. -Hallelujah- Hallelujah - Come on sing Glory. Glory to God. Let every heart sing. Glory to God in the Highest."" Pastor Brian Houston said, ""You can live a certain time without food and a lot less time without water."" We pray that 'HOPE' is a blessing to you and your family.",1496016000,,2620,4.517894736842106

8173230,1,B000MX0N3Y,"The format of this disc is multizone which makes it incompatible with U.S. (zone 1) DVD players and is, therefore, unplayable. I tried to play it in multiple DVD players and computers without success.",1426032000,,200,4.911764705882353

8173232,5,B000MX0N3Y,"I Love the song Highest sang by Darlene Zschech. I even Love the prayer even more Darlene Zschech prays at the ending of Highest. Puts me into tears of Joy. I can't help but cry at that part. JESUS presence truly is strong on this dvd & cd to. There just more to the dvd than the cd. The song Highest on the cd had to edit to 9min 16 sec due to space. But on the dvd you get the full version of Highest which is 17 min 8 sec. I Love all the songs on here. Darlene Zschech does 11 songs on here all together. On the cd Tulele Faletolu sings Free. But on the dvd Joel Houston sings it instead. I like Tulele Faletolu version better. Darlene Zschech is My Fav. and i miss seeing her do half the album to where now she only does 2 or 1 song from This is our God and up. It's a shame as wonferful this dvd is that they dis continue it. You can't even buy this dvd at Hillsong own website like you use to. Thank God amazon had one last new for me to get. I wish they get more in stock on all the Hillsong dvd's.

This is the prayer Darlene Zschech prays at the ending of the song Highest
