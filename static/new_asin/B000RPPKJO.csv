This is not worth the money they are asking !!!",1274140800,,135,4.826086956521739
8202355,1,B000RPPKJO,"This product is just a poor quality audio recording of three lectures, with a repeating sequence of still images for background.  It would not be worth $1 for a download let alone $22 for the DVD.",1246406400,2,196,4.444444444444445
8202356,5,B000RPPKJO,"We have been warned that without alternative power sources and a reduction of carbon based emissions our planet will continue to heat up, melting the poles and flooding all low lying areas of the world. Much of which is agricultural & populated areas.  And all this from just 1 degree of warming! Scientists expects the planet to warm by as much as 3-10 degrees at our continued rate of temperature rise within the next century. Hydrogen and 0 Point Energy are just some of the solutions to this bleak future predicted by almost all climatologists and scientists? We cant keep waiting for the next generation to fix today's problems! The balance is in our hands! We have the technology to save our future, but do we have the will?",1223683200,,730,4.658914728682171
