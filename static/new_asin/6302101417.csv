We showed this movie to my sister-in-law and her 2 boys, they were on the floor laughing hystarically. We too use many of the statements made by Bob frequently. We talk about this movie all the time and when we can catch it on TV will drop everything and sit to watch. We laugh every time we watch it.",1017619200,,422,4.096385542168675

(You'll understand when you see it!!) I laughed so much that my cheeks hurt. I loved the romance in it. I even had tears in my eyes when Bob talked about when he was young.
The actors were amazing. This is one movie you won't forget. Another thing is that this movie is for all ages. I guarantee that you will love it!

It's just a very good comedy.  I would say it as the same type of humor as another very solid comedy, Overboard.  I just don't understand how this thing isn't available anymore on DVD.  If this was on bluray, I'd purchase it today.

If you have a chance to see it, it's a fun romantic comedy that I think most people would enjoy.  A lot of the humor is subtle and clever so pay attention.",1434585600,,567,3.9646017699115044

A large percentage of our generation would rate this film in their top 5 movies we watched instead of studying for mid terms.  As of 2 years ago this film was only availabe for purchase on VHS.  Now that it has been transferred to digital, we all can reminisce over the many moments Judy Finkle, er, Bob creates to cause us to laugh similar to when we were having a dorm party.

To this very day My cousin and I still quote multiple scenes from this movie, and my cousins nickname to most that know him is Bob even though that is not his real name. Before this movie Bob was not a famous name like ""Judy Finkle"", or ""William F Buckley"". I can say now that ""Bob maloogaloogaloogaloogalooga"". 1 malooga 4 malloga's has become a famous name in my household. To this day I can not say the name Cathy properly, and every time I see a rat at a pet store it is called ""Mooka"", and even the word chocolate is said in a long drawn out way.

This is, hands down, the funniest movie I've ever seen, and every few years, I check around to see if I can find a DVD, but to no avail.

Big Man on Campus is one of those movies that no one you know has ever seen. Show it to someone and he will wonder why he's never seen it and how he's lived without it for so long.

There are so many quality physical gags (Bob constantly knocking on the door), one liners, asides, and expertly timed exchanges in this film that you'll love it forever. The interview between Dr. Webster and ""Bob"" when he picks his name is top shelf comedy writing and timing.

If you want the domain please email me at malooga@gmail.com to talk about it. I will include all the site content so that you can put it on your server. Hope to hear from you soon.

Hi everybody. I've started a website devoted to this movie at [...] Guess who stopped by the other day? Mr. Maloogaloogaloogaloogalooga himself! Yes, Allan Katz emailed me to say thanks for keeping the dream alive. He explained why the movie has not been released on DVD. It was owned originally by Vestron. When they went out of business, the new owners sold off all the international rights, and decided not to release it into theaters.  Eventually this company was bought by Lions Gate, who I assume now have it in the vault. I've emailed them asking to have it released on DVD, but have had no response yet.

We all know how great the movie is and maybe if lots of us email Lions Gate, they'll consider a DVD. It's a longshot, but hey, this is a cult film and it's going to take a lot of pressure to get what we want.

Please stop by the site and have a look and let me know what you think. Allan sent me the original script along with a never before seen photo of Bob and I've posted these on the site. I'm planning to put lots of video clips up in the near future to make it more interesting. I have links where you can buy the VHS and posters.",1201478400,11,1492,4.1522491349480966

I recently started searching for this title again and read that a studio fire destroyed the original film, dashing any hopes at a DVD release. Not sure if this is true, but if it is, it is quite disappointing news.",1165536000,,345,4.2272727272727275

I have named every pet I've had since ""Bob"", and I love to go to chicken places and order ""Two Faces"", since I can get what ever part of the chicken I want.

WHY ISN'T THIS MOVIE OUT ON DVD YET!

I'd gladly pay $19.99 for it, but it might end up in the $9.99 bin or less if they ever dig into the classics and put this one out.",1157932800,15,446,3.723404255319149

422233,5,6302101417,"I first saw Big Man on Campus on HBO in 1989 or 1990 and found it one of the funniest movies I'd ever seen! The dialog is very witty and fast paced. We have watched the movie at least once a year since it came out and it is just as funny now as then. I got my daughter and some close friends hooked. We know the dialog nearly verbatim and use ""Boblish"" as a second language. In some circles I am known as ""Judy Finkel"" and we named our calico cat MOOKA beacause of a resemblance. The sound track is great also. I would love to be able to see the scenes cut from the movie that show up during the end credits. It would be fun to hear from other fans of the film.",1142553600,8,661,3.8676470588235294

422235,5,6302101417,"I loved this movie. It was funny, and yet touched your heart. My husband (Retired, 20yrs. ""Jar Head"") thought it was very funny, and he usually doesn't like comedy. He laughed so hard, sometimes, I thought he'd have to change his pants. Wish they would put it on DVD, since that seems to last longer.",1140134400,9,300,4.472727272727273

422280,5,6302101417,"I read all 17 of the reviews from other people, and it really is sad that we are the only people to have even HEARD of this movie, let alone seen it!  I kept giggling as I read all the reviews here.  ...two faces  LOL  two speeds  BIGGER LOL...  You gotta see this flick.  I bought it used for a dollar in a thrift shop, and fell in love with it.  Came here today looking for it on DVD...  What a shame.  The video companies need to recognize this as an instant comedy classic, along with many others (too many to name here) and re-release them on a better format.

EDIT:  Seems the masters were destroyed in a fire at the production's home.  A loss to be sure.  Unless someone with a heart buys, captures, remasters, and re-releases it on a modern format, we'll never see it, except on VHS, tucked deep in the corners of used book and antique stores, waiting for some day that a new, unexposed, classic movie neophyte discovers the lost gem that it is.  I will keep looking for a new VHS copy to surface, I will buy it, and I will have it transferred to DVD on my own dime, just so that I won't ever lose this treasure.  Am I gushing?  Yes, but it's that good.  It really is.  <end broken hearted post...>",1118620800,,1206,4.165217391304348

My children watched it all these years, and my son who is now 20 borrowed it to show his girlfriend a year ago. She also fell in love with it, and they watched it so much the tape broke. PLEASE PLEASE re-release this one on DVD. I'll be one of the first in line to buy it.

As other UK reviewers have noted, this is pretty much an unknown movie. I actually do not know a single person, except you reviewers, my brother, a neighbour and I, who have seen this. For shame. I'm not going to critique it. Waste of time. Instead, two words. Watch It. The Film. That is.",1064361600,,410,4.708333333333333

My grandsons were only 3 & 1 at the time but still thought it funny.  They are 18 and 15 and are still borrowing my video to show their friends because they have to see it to believe it. Now, the following is that much bigger. We love Alan Katz!  Actually, we love the whole crew.  I don't see how they made it through the hilarious script.  Cudos to the writers, the casting people, etc.  We always order ""2 faces"" when we go to the chicken place and watch the reaction on the employees faces then we crack-up.  I'm 62 years old, and still can't catch my breath from laughing whenever we watch Big Man on Campus. I'm laughing just talking about it with you. Like most of the reviewers, no one except us seems to have seen this movie.  It's a must when everyone is over for Christmas.  It going on 14 years and we never get tired of it.

Talk about a flick stocked full of laser-paced wit and sight gags(Corey Parker attempting to sneak out to see Kathy or Bob's Boogaloo with the head phones on), this is a real find!! I stumbled upon this near classic film at a small independent video shop in Oak Cliff (a section of Dallas, Texas) and knew I had to see it after reading the caption on the box:""BOB WASN'T SURE WHY HE WAS SO DIFFERENT THAN  EVERYONE ELSE ON CAMPUS---BUT HE HAD A HUNCH!"" Alan Katz
deserved an Oscar nomination for his portrayal of BOB MALOOGA-LOOGA-LOOGA-LOOGA (pay extremely close attention to the names as the closing credits roll!!!). So many great lines to name, and you'll certainly think differently about chocolate after this movie. O.K., I'm busted! I'm forced and compelled to give you a couple more scenes to watch for: Cindy Williams (yes, THAT Cindy Williams!) plays a psychologist who has a hilarious word-to-object-name-pronounciation-association session; and the dance in the window where the title of this message is derived. GET IT! GET IT! GET IT! That's all I can tell you! I'm a big MASH and Simpsons script fan and the screenplay of this movie will keep you runnin'!

I adore this film, a 'secret' classic! he he
So  many people don't know anything about it (in the UK anyway), but those that have seen it - love it!
A brilliantly quick witted script, with so many great one-liners.  ""2 speed - uurgh urrgh, uuuuuuurgh uuuuuuuuuurgh"". (You need to see it!)
A genuine fun for the all the family movie.
