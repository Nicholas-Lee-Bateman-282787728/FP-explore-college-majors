2396917,5,B000AYEIIQ,"As the penultimate Season Four transitioned to the undesired hour long format, most episodes from this season rarely made it to syndication, aside from the SciFi Channel.  As I've gone thru ""Season 4 (The Definitive Edition)"" it's like viewing an entire ""lost"" string of episodes from the genius of Rod Serling.  They are all wonderful but I am drawn particularly to ""Mute"", ""The Parallel"", ""No Time Like the Past"" & ""Passage on the Lady Anne"" as my personal favorites.

Some intriguing artifacts are the colorized scenes from the syndicated version of ""Miniature"".  While this is an interesting aspect of the storyline and gives a nice ""over the rainbow"" effect to the story, it also demonstrates why the dreaded colorization process of original Black & White films should NEVER be applied.  But that's just my opinion, I could be wrong.",1129680000,21,838,5.0

2396919,5,B000AYEIIQ,"In response to T Man's inquiry from 09/14/05 regarding details on this season- T Man indicates that he owns the first three seasons already on DVD. If this is the case, then he would have received the companion book bundled with Season 1. That book contains more valuable info on this as well as the other seasons than anyone could write here. I would suggest you refer to that. Bottom line- hour long format was not the ideal setting for the essential qualities of Zone, but I'm really pleased that they decided to do this for one season- it's a nice change of pace, and a few episodes IMO hold up to the standards of any of the greats- Death Ship, The New Exhibit, In His Image and IMO the best of the season= On Thursday We Leave For Home- as a response to my previous assessment regarding the format problems, none of these aformentioned episodes could have been achieved using the 1/2 hr format, as the majority of the content is essential to the story and not just 'padding'. See for yourself- buy this!",1127347200,11,1009,4.45945945945946
2396920,5,B000AYEIIQ,"I, for one, love the fourth season of Twilight Zone.  Was it as consistent in terms of writing and production as other seasons?  The answer is debatable, but keep in mind, even lesser TZ is greater than most TV!  Certainly this season did introduce some of my very favorite episodes of the series:

First -- ""Jess-belle"", which includes an Anne Francis performance that is superior (arguably of course) to any and all I have seen from her on the big or small screen. And Jeanette Nolan gives a 'wicked' performance as Granny Hart.  This episode alone is worth the price of the DVD.

Second -- ""Mute"", which features a young Ann Jillian as the title character.  Her acting was brilliant even as a child and her performance makes this one a very memorable episode.

Third -- ""The Bard"", with a stand-out performance from Burt Reynolds giving a very obvious parody of Marlon Brando.  All in all, one of the more humorous Twilight Zone episodes from any season.

Fourth -- ""Miniature"", with Robert Duvall giving a very sensitive performance, and also starring Barbara Barrie (from the old TV sit com ""Double Trouble"".)  It features some beautiful music from Mozart that adds so much to the emotional atmosphere.  A beautiful episode.

Fifth -- ""Printer's Devil"", which includes another stand-out Burgess Meredith performance as the devil himself!  This is very different from the other roles Meredith had played previously on TZ, and this further shows his incredibly dramatic range.

Though these five are my favorites of the season, that's not to discount the others.  ""In His Image"", ""The Thirty Fathom Grave"", ""He's Alive"", ""The New Exhibit"" and ""Of Late I Think Of Cliffordville"" (featuring the incomparible Julie Newmar of Catwoman fame) are all fantastic episodes.  Even the ones I haven't mentioned merit repeated viewings!  So get the DVD -- you won't be disappointed!",1126915200,10,1873,4.987096774193549
2396921,4,B000AYEIIQ,"Yes, in response to the other reviewer (at this time), this is the first and only season of the TZ to have one hour episodes. I don't remember exactly why the format changed (though I bet it was a studio decision) but I remember hearing that Serling thought that the half-hour show was the best format for telling these kind of morality tales, and was really unhappy with the new hour length. The hour shows, as you will see, required too much padding. Due to this longer format, and the fact that the studio wanted to saved some dollars, there are only half the episodes in this season as any other (only 18). And, unfortunately, not one of them is a classic on par with ""Time Enough at Last"", ""The Eye of the Beholder"", ""It's a Good Life"", or ""Nightmare at 20,000 Feet"" (though my personal favorite is season 3's ""The Midnight Sun""). In looking over the episode listing on TV dot com, the only ones I somewhat remember from Season 4 are ""Mute"" (about a little orphan girl with a power), ""The New Exhibit"" (about a wax museum of villians), and ""Miniature"" (about a doll house, though I mainly remember this one because it wasn't shown until the 80's due to a copyright lawsuit - it was still a decent ep as I recall). The rest, though perhaps not horrible, I hardly remember. I would give this season ""three stars"" overall but bumped it up to 4 because it is, after all, the Twilight Zone. You know you're going to buy this one because you have the first three seasons and are waiting for the fifth!",1126656000,8,1500,4.418772563176895

2396923,3,B000AYEIIQ,"These are the hour long episodes.  Not their best work.  Takes a half hour subject and stretches it out to an hour so they are long winded, rather dull, rather forced.  Most of the episodes could have been told in 30 minutes and been more effective.  The scripts just not as good as the half hour episodes.  Two of my favorites, though, that do make good use of the 60 minutes are ""Of Late I Think of Cliffordville"" and ""On Thursday We Leave for Home"".

I thought I was a fan, but now I see how many episodes I've missed.  Season 4 especially, made me realize there was only one season of hour long episodes.  If you think this is twice the fright or more to digest of some of the ""Brainier"" stories, think again.  Some of the episodes are as good as the other seasons.  However,  there is a stretch factor in many episodes.  I feel these could have been done as well or better in half the time.  Some episode plots seem repetitious or the same idea is overstated.  I'm almost done with Season 4 and ready to return to shorter programs where less is more.  Twice the time cost Season 4 a star.",1472774400,,792,4.283783783783784

If you are a Twilight Zone Lover, as I am, they are worth the price. If anyone is unfamiliar with the Twilight Zone series, it is a classic.

The season is complete; its just that for Season 4 they went with a roughly 1 hour format per episode instead of the standard half-hour block seen in earlier seasons.)

2397019,3,B000AYEIIQ,"I have the entire set of the Definitive Editions, and enjoy Twilight Zone very much. Unfortunately what many reviewers have previously stated about Season 4 is true: this is the weakest season of the series. To fill the longer time slot, most episodes have 'padding' in dialog and in the action. As a result, much of the suspense/tension of the plot is diminished. For non-fans, most of the episodes will be boring. For Twilight Zone fans, however, this item is still a 'must have' despite the shortcomings. Most of the storylines are solid and thoughtful, as in the other four seasons. In fact, one can easily see how some of these episodes could have become 'classics' if they had only been of the shorter format.",1384560000,3,715,4.728

2397023,3,B000AYEIIQ,"TWILIGHT ZONE: Season 4 I found to be only average. A stark contrast to season 3 which at least I found to be the best TWILIGHT ZONE season of the entire run. It was not wise for the producers to expand the show to an hour time slot. The pace and the writing is slow and labored. The trademark ironic third act payoff which Rod Serling's show was so known for falls flat of the half hour show expectations. One is at times reminded of what an OUTER LIMITS spinoff or imitation would be like in less capable hands, when watching some of these episodes. Evidently, audiences must have felt the same way in 1962 because by the next and final season, the show was back to its' half hour time slot and even featured some of the very best episodes that were ever produced for THE TWILIGHT ZONE. There really aren't many memorable episodes in this season. I, myself remember the ones that I do because I thought that they were rare misses (JESS-BELL, THE NEW EXHIBIT)and not worthy of the TWILIGHT ZONE writing or because although passable some episodes stood out slightly from what the season had to offer (HE'S ALIVE, THE THIRTY-FATHOM GRAVE). Whatever your stance on THE TWILIGHT ZONE Season 4, technically, the episodes have never looked or sounded better and I doubt that they have ever looked or sounded this good. Crisp and clean looking (almost video like appearance) with your choice of audio track (original monoraul or remastered)and an assortment of features one would be hard-pressed to be dissatisfied with. If you are a completist (as I am when it comes to THE TWILIGHT ZONE) I highly recomend buying season 4, but if you are not and are only looking for the best episodes of this show, look to any of the other seasons.",1372636800,4,1728,4.577419354838709

Rod Serling orginally wanted Season One to be presented as a full hour but, decided on the half hour gig. Sometimes great stories have to allow for time to present it as a full hour to get fit in all the great ideas from the writers mind.

2397030,5,B000AYEIIQ,"The Twilight Zone has always been among my all-time favourite tv shows despite the fact then when I first encountered it as a boy it scared me so much that I couldn't sleep! This fourth season is now in Blu-Ray format and while not every episode looks great on 1080p due to the various states of deterioration of the original master tapes they are certainly a whole lot better than the dvds. The sound quality for the most part has been cleaned up and hisses are few and far between. What I like about the Twilight Zone is that I never seem to tire of watching the episodes over and over again as I always seem to find something new that I missed on previous times. Not all the episodes in this fourth season score but the ones I liked the most are: ""The Thirty-Fathom Grave"", ""Death Ship"", ""Jess-Belle"", ""Miniature"", ""The Parallel"", ""On Thursday We Leave For Home"", and ""Passage On the Lady Anne"".  While many may feel the half hour versions are better I personally feel that season four is my favourite and I feel the best season.  I liked the way the hour format allows time to develop the story and the characters as well.

Most episodes have excellent picture and sound quality and in fact this has improved a great deal over the previous seasons as well.  Overall this is a very good blu-ray set of season four of the series which I personally believe to be the best Twilight Zone season.

Normally, I'm skeptical about older shows being remastered like this for Blu-ray, but overall, I'm pretty impressed. In a nutshell, here's what I think about The Twilight Zone on Blu-ray.

GOOD
- the quality of the transfers look very impressive in HD, there's no artifacts or other anomologies sometimes seen in the DVD version
- the audio tracks have been restored and remastered and they give a lot of new depth to some of the classic episodes
- a nice collection of episodes that still stand the test of time
- great extras are included, including interviews and other behind the scenes bits

BAD
- the set can be kinda pricey, so shop around for the best deal

Even if you have these on regular DVD, I realize that it can be daunting to buy another series AGAIN, just to have it in HD, but trust me, it's worth it.",1326326400,2,940,4.485380116959064
2397037,5,B000AYEIIQ,"I have loved the Twilight Zone since I was a young child. Due to the fact, that I was born after the series originally aired, I only got to see it in syndication. But, it seemed like it was on forever. The Twilight Zone and Star Trek were two of my all time favorite shows of the time (then I got into Cheers years later, all top quality writing). I found myself entranced by the writing and the cadence of the dialogue, even at a young age I found myself also drawn into the lives of the people and weird goings-on. I was always intrigued by the little morality plays that transpired within the half hour the show was on. And, for a brief time, the full hour shows were shown, these were not as popular in syndication for some reason. But, after viewing the episodes again, and in some cases, for the first time, I can't imagine why not. Perhaps it was more due to budget and time. It seemed in syndication, sitcoms were king, because of the shorter time frame, and the advertising dollars involved. Someone said that the hour episodes didn't pack the same punch as the half hour shows, which is true in some cases, but with these stories, it seemed as if they needed more time. As if Rod Serling and company purposefully held off on all the stories that needed more time and made a season out of them.

The opposite can be said for the half hour shows, as sometimes they seemed a bit rushed and you could tell that the stories would be even more awesome if they could be fleshed out a bit more. That isn't to say that this is a weak season, or that previous seasons suffered from the amount of time allotted. While some episodes are more of a standout than others, overall, the writing was exceptional, the casting was dead-on, and the direction was without flaw. With an a-list cast list, with actors that have went on to great success after this series, it is definitely a treat to have all of these seasons on blu ray. Considering the age of the series, and it being in black and white, it's overwhelming how great they look on blu ray. Usually blu ray brings out the flaws of something this old. but everything looks outstanding and sounds just as outstanding. I am not going to go into too much detail concerning the actual episodes, because I just want everyone to know how great the series is as a whole and how great it is to have this on blu ray. its worth every penny. I can not compare the dvd sets to these, as I held off on buying them until they finally released an ""ultimate"" version. I wanted it to be season by season and in chronological order.

The extras are definitely a plus as well with radio dramas, audio interviews, sponsor billboards and other interesting extras (such as Rod Serling's appearance on Groucho Marx's old show) You don't get this amount of extras on newer shows. With the exception of Everybody Loves Raymond most tv. shows have very few if any extras. Even my beloved Cheers was kinda shafted by Paramount as far as extras go. But, with the Twilight Zone they didn't leave anything out. All of this in great blu ray cases that fit neatly in your collection. Blu Ray is really the way to go for this series. Even if you have never watched an episode in your life, or if you are revisiting this show from your past. You will not be disappointed. Star Trek (the original series - 3 Seasons) look great on blu ray as well. I'd recommend both series. As with Star Trek they give you the option of watching the shows with improved special effects as well as original effects (but I'm not that much of a purist I love the new scenes/special effects) With Blu Ray these two prestigious shows are shown in the best possible way. I can not recommend these two series enough. They are classic tv in the best modern presentation.",1320278400,5,3761,4.39454806312769

2397040,4,B000AYEIIQ,"I have learned not to pay too much heed to certain critics of the later seasons of Twilight Zone. No. 4 has been a pleasant surprise in that it's stories are more consistently interesting than one is led to believe. On a number of fronts - the thoughtful, well-scripted stories; the attention paid to lighting and atmosphere in many of the scenes; the solid, at times brilliant acting; the sense of irony and mystery are mostly intact. Even the failed episodes, and there are a few, such as the Printer's Devil (really a near miss due to a lagging final 15 minutes) and The Thirty Fathom Grave- offer examples of fine acting; snippits of dialogue; aural and visual delights that one can take away without being totally disappointed. For me, the standouts in this set - such as Death Ship; Parallel; He's Alive; Mute (I have not even finished the whole set yet) are as good as any TZ episode. In the case of He's Alive and Miniature - quite simply classic examples of imaginative interpretation; outstanding acting (by Dennis Hopper and Robert Duvall respectively) and seldom matched storytelling. I just finished the uneven Season 3 which swung from the heights of A Very Good Life; The Dummy and The Midnight Sun to the only two outright bad episodes that I have seen so far - The very saccharine and disappointing The Body Electric; and the horrible Cavendar is Coming (despite talented Carol Burnett and Jesse White's heroic attempts to keep it alive). For me, I have actually found Season 4 to be a bit more interesting and consistent overall. I think that the stories back then moved a bit more slowly and require a bit more patient listening to be enjoyed. I get the feeling that this is a challenge for many some viewers who are used to programs that practically demand that we maintain a short attention span and not think too clearly about multiple plot holes and the fragmented, incoherent dialog. Twilight Zone, more often than not, actually requires you to do some thinking.",1310601600,2,1986,4.726224783861672

All Season 4 Episodes were 1 HOUR LONG, thus there is 18 total hours of aired episodes. Which is literally the same amount of hours as 36 half hour episodes. That is why price is the same as the other seasons - THE SEASON 4 SET WILL CONTAIN AT MINIMUM THE SAME AMOUNT OF BLU-RAY DISCS AS SEASON 3, IT MAY EVEN HAVE 1 MORE DISC DUE TO IT BEING MORE HOURS THAN SEASON 3!

KUDOS to the folks at Image for NOT using evil DNR which would have destroyed Mr. Serling's original intent.  To those that do not know, grain is an literally part of the physical composition of silver nitrate. Director's chose film stock based on how much grain they wanted their artistic vision to have. Grain=Detail not the opposite. To remove grain no matter how carefully always removes  fine detail. So much detail is in this Blu-ray set you can even see the ripples and sheen of Rod Serling's herringbone suits in some of the intro's. That and the tiny lines on actors faces is detail to the MAX. Except for it being black and white, it is like they standing right in front of us. You don't get that when DNR is used, what you do get with DNR is a waxy unnatural look.

The folks at Image should also be proud for giving us unaltered, uncompressed sound as an option. For those of us who despise unnatural processed modern digital sound and this is a blessing of blessings. Coupled with the pristine video which totally unmarred thankfully due to no DNR this Blu-ray set is nearly as good as a pristine 35MM print. This set showcases Mr Serling's genius rather than try to conceal it in a shoddy revisionist modern manner. This and all the Zone sets are true reference quality.

To the people at Image please produce all your Blu-Ray using the same level of quality and professional effort as your Zone sets!!!!!

Many company's could learn valuable lessons on proper Blu-Ray mastering from the people at Image who worked on these zone sets.",1304380800,43,1939,4.46045197740113
2397043,5,B000AYEIIQ,"Thanks to the wonderful invention of Blue Ray we fans of ""The Twilight Zone"" can now enjoy the series in beautiful, pristine condition. In this set all 18 episodes of season 4 (BLUE RAY RELEASE ON MAY 17, 2011) have been restored from their original studio prints. I have both the entire series on DVD and have compared them with the Blue Rays that have already been made available and the difference is noticeable: the print is even more vibrant and eye-catching and it's as if the characters come right at you on the screen. Another great asset to buying the Blue Rays are the extra bonuses that are not included on the DVD editions.

 Season four of ""The Twilight Zone"" began in January, 1963 after being cancelled by CBS in the spring of the previous year. It replaced the show that it had been cancelled for called ""Fair Exchange"". In order to fill the one hout time slot CBS brought ""The Twilight Zone"" back in one hour installments, so although fewer episodes of season four were filmed they were extended beyond their normal thirty minute running time. Creator Rod Serling hated the new one hour format as he felt the writers had to write stories way beyond their worth in order to fill an hour of primetime programming.

 The list of special bonuses for this particular Blue Ray include 13 new audio commentaries by ""Twilight Zone Companion"" writer Marc Scott Zicree and other followers and critics of the series. All of the DVD bonuses are also included here and include interviews with guest-stars like Anne Francis and Morgan Brittany; 7 radio dramas; isolated scores for select episodes; and much more.

 The following is a list of Season 4 ""Twilight Zone"" episodes along with their airdates;

1. ""In His Image"", Jan. 3, 1963

2397044,5,B000AYEIIQ,This was a great series that brings back memories. I have always enjoyed the strange episodes narrated by Rod Serling.,1293494400,,118,4.95
2397045,5,B000AYEIIQ,"I love the influences this show has on so many other movies and other forms of entertainment. For example, I noticed how ""little girl lost"" (season 3) where the kid falls into another dimension, is much like the premise for the movie ""Poltergeist."" I love for ""number 12 looks just like you"" (season?) where everyone gets whatever the predecessor for plastic surgery was in the 60's (when it didn't exist; or was quite limited in scale) at age 18. This was a lot more prophetic for the future than Rod Serling ever could have imagined back then when you watch it with 2010 eyes.

I also love ""Time enough at last"" where Burgess Meredeth played the dork who's in a bank vault during the nuclear holocaust and gets to read allllll the books he's always wanted...un-til...this is my favorite of his characters, maybe even before ""Rocky"" and ""Grumpy Old Men.""

Oh, odd little tidbit. If you notice the Twlight Zone movie where the kid turns everyone into cartoons, the sister whose mouth he took away is the voice of Bart Simpson, if I'm not mistaken. Speaking of, Mrs. Krabappel's voice played Bob Newhart's secretary in the Bob Newhart show in the early 70's. 'k there's your freaky pointless trivia for the day, kiddies.

Two members of Santana joined up and made Journey (apropos of nothing but pointless trivia). Neal Schon played for Carlos at age 15, and Greg Rollie(from very early Journey; he left after the first few albums-yes records-with Steves Perry and Smith) was his keyboard player.

As for Rober Duvall's appearance in ""Miniature,"" this came up at Chicago's last dollhouse store and workshop (3209 N Clark st). No one had seen this episode except for me, and this is a group of mostly older people who were there the first time it was played. In a group of wonderful people OBSESSED with miniature dollhouses (including myself, obviously), this was amusing to me. It's not unusual for it to take ten YEARS to make a large (50 inches wide, 26 deep, and 52 inches high) dollhouse. People use the hobby to be all-encompassing. Some women use it when their husbands die so they have something interesting and absorbing enough to pass through their grief. Even a ""small"" house such as my own (say 28 wide, and about 12 deep, maybe 25 high; very after-market or custom-made) has taken me about a year to make. It not only has a working doorbell, but a working tv set as well. Pieces that are one-of-a-kind can cost up to seven grand, but kiddie-oriented stuff is cheap. Looking at one of these houses in a photo; you can't tell they're not full-sized rooms.

So, this is clearly a heavy-duty fantasy of ours at the store. Unfortunately, Think Small is the LAST dollhouse store/workshop in 2,710 miles of roads in Chicago proper.

As I said, I love this show, even as dated as it seems to be sometimes, it's aged stunningly well for being 47 YEARS OLD! Wow, I just realized that! It's still incredibly entertaining, and you'll note that some wonderful people are not only fans of this show; but they're all expert-level geeks on the subject of the show. Not just the title of EVERY show, but original airdates and all.

As for the store, well, they're retiring at the end of April, 2010, which means they're closing forever :( It's a damn shame for such a unique business. Since they're not online, the phone number is 773-477-1920. Be sure and see the workshop. Phone first, as it is a small business (literally).",1268611200,,3421,4.6821963394342765

2397048,4,B000AYEIIQ,"The hour long episodes of season four have a few gems amongst them but as any fan knows TZ had peaked in season three.

2397049,4,B000AYEIIQ,"I rented this Twilight Zone episode as I like the time travel concept and wanted to check it out.  Our hero [Dana Andrews] goes back to important times in history and tries to change them, but something always happens that prevents him from doing so.  He tries to evacuate Hiroshima before the A-bomb -- no luck.  He tries to put a bullet into Hitler when Hitler is making a speech -- no luck there, either.  Finally he gives up and wants to settle down in a 19th century town and retire.  But he is afraid of making changes that could affect the future.  Huh??  But if he could not make changes in the first place no matter how hard he tried, how could he make changes accidentally?  You know, time travel paradoxes aside, this story is about a man who wants to make positive changes -- it ends well for him.  Rent this out.

Dana Andrews has also appeared in mainstream stuff:

2397051,5,B000AYEIIQ,"Even if you have the series on VHS or previous DVD releases, the picture and sound quality is SUPERB. The transfers are perfect. The extras make it worth the purchase. It even contains a disc with one classic TZ comic book from the 1960s and 1970s in PDF format so you can read a classic issue on your computer.

One small note: I definately agree with other reviewers. THE TWILIGHT ZONE: UNLOCKING THE DOOR TO A TELEVISION CLASSIC by Martin Grams is 800 plus pages includes ""everything"" about the classic series and is a wonderful companion with the DVDs. The book details Serling's writing career on radio, early television and Twilight Zone is well researched and highly detailed. Exclusive interviews with cast and crew and behind-the-scenes trivia will floor you. What you do is watch an episode and then read up on it in the book and you'll discover a wealth of trivia that makes this worthy of appreciation. Both the DVD set and the book is on Amazon.com. Do yourself the favor and get both. You'll thank me for it.",1226016000,2,1022,4.6464088397790055
2397052,5,B000AYEIIQ,"I spent over $800 on the VHS videos from Columbia House two decades ago. I spent less than $140 for the complete DVD set and discovered more treasures, rare filmed interviews, bonus extras and high-quality transfers that are far superior to what I have been watching the past 20 years.

The Serling blooper was the same featured in Season 1 box set. The color footage of ""Miniature"" was clearly from a VHS. But don't let that keep you from buying this must-have. The rarely seen hour-long episodes are available uncut and commercial free. Anne Francis gives a superb video commentary. The commercial billboards are great and perhaps the best of the season.

The retail price keep lowering over the months but by now it's beyond affordable. I recommend you grab this season box set today.

I also suggest you buy ""The Twilight Zone: Unlocking the Door to a Television Classic"" because the 800 plus page book is a P-E-R-F-E-C-T companion to the DVD box set. Before or after you watch an episode, you can use the book to uncover the in-jokes, bloopers and trivia that make viewing these episodes fun.

2397056,5,B000AYEIIQ,"If you grew up watching the Twilight Zone in reruns on your local TV station, you've never seen these hour-long episodes. That's right there are 18 episodes of the Zone that were lost and now are found. Once only available on specialty cable channels, these hour episodes are collected here in a great set. Each episode has been remastered from the original film negatives for the best possible picture and sound. You should know, though, that these hour episodes don't quite flow as easy as the half hour ones. In many cases this is good because it provides for more character development and suspense. ""The Thirty-Fathom Grave"" builds nicely. ""On Thursday We Leave For Home"" is an unforgetable character study with an incredible performance by Richard Widmark. ""Printer's Devil"" features Burgess Meredith so that one could be 4 hours long and still be entertaining. But episode like ""No Time Like The Past"" and ""In His Image"" and ""Jess-Belle"" seem a little padded. Taken as a whole this is a great set and for a long-time fan of the show like myself, a real treat to see ""new"" episodes of one of the greatest shows in TV history. I recommend it.",1151193600,5,1147,4.74
2397057,3,B000AYEIIQ,"There are about 8 episodes per disc, and what I don't like about these Twilight Zone DVD sets is, there is no option to play all episodes consecutively.  After one episode ends, you have to grab the remote and back out of that episode's menu, and then back to the main menu and select the next episode!  Just make sure you're remote is handy at all times when watching this DVD set!",1145664000,7,382,4.291666666666667
2397058,5,B000AYEIIQ,"It's the prevailing opinion of serious Twilight Zone fans that the hour-long format of the show's 4th series diluted the impact of the stories.

While this is sometimes noticeable, it's not by any means a fatal flaw. There is still a lot of enjoyment to be had.

The 4th series doesn't feature any absolute classics, like 'Walking Distance', but the level of writing, acting, and production is still high.

'Mute' is an excellent conceptual episode about a girl alienated by her special abilities.'On Thursday We Leave for Home' features the brilliant James Whitmore as a man whose purpose in life is destroyed by his own salvation. 'The Incredible World of Horace Ford' features a man utterly seduced by nostalgia.",1142640000,6,715,4.991596638655462
2397059,5,B000AYEIIQ,"The quality of the remastered prints of these great
old episodes is superb, but check out the interviews they
did with the actors (and there are even more of them on Season 5).  Morgan Brittany, Paul Comi, and Anne Francis, plus
writer John Furia Jr.  They all have cool stuff to say about working in that time period and how Twilight Zone has influenced their lives.  Buy Season 4 and Season 5 just for that!  I wish they'd done interviews for Seasons 1 thru 3.  BTW, I encourage everyone who posts on these TZ DVD product pages to talk about the *DVDs*, not grade or review the episodes.  We came here to buy the product, after all - and we want to encourage others to do likewise.  Also, the official review posted at the top of this page is WAY off.  The most glaring miscredit is Paul Brownstein, who did NOT produce anything on Season 4 other than *one* of the actor audio commentaries.  For the other seasons, he basically located some actors, got them to talk into a mike while watching the episode for the first time in 40+ years, and as a result, many of the audio commentaries are embarrassingly bad.  William Windom's, for ""Miniature"" in Season 4, is only one of many weak ones.  Jonathan Winters' on Season 3 is just plain bad.  Anyhow, buy Season 4 online - in stores, you'd pay almost twice as much.",1131753600,8,1314,4.429166666666666

wasnt familiar with it,as i believe is the case with most people.
These hour episodes were/are rarely shown in favor of the more
traditional half hour TZ's. The extra time added to each episode
didnt make Serling happy,but he and his crew did a pretty good
job. The extra ""fluff""that many critics called fill in to prolong
the show to an hour really isn't just ""fill in"" in my opinion as
i thought it to be important to the stories and their climaxes.
Several of these episodes are really very good and i put some of
them near the top of previous seasons and season five. Among a
few are ""In his image"",""Death ship"",""Mute"",""He's alive"",""Printers
devil"",a handful of the 18 total episodes. As a true TZ fan i
think you would enjoy this season very much and even if you dont
like it as much as the first three,it is worth owning as there
are some excellent stories and makes for a nice change towards
the end of the TZ ledger. You most likely will not see these on
t.v. so go for it!",1130889600,7,1047,4.346938775510204
2397062,4,B000AYEIIQ,"I realize the traditional point of view is that the fourth

season of Twilight Zone was the beginning of the decline of

the series.  I won't argue with that point of view, but I do

take issue with those who would regard the fourth season as

poor quality or even trashy writing.

Although it was a network gimmick, it is a good thing that

Twilight Zone expanded to one hour.  It represented the best

kind of artistic challenge to Serling and his excellent team

of writers.  There are episodes here that simply could not be

done in the half-hour format.  They require too much character

development and subtle nuances of detail.  I'm talking about

""In His Image,"" ""Jess-Belle,"" ""Miniature,"" and ""The Incredible

World of Horace Ford,"" among others.  These episodes belong

with the best Twilight Zone ever produced.

While Season Four certainly indicates a television series past

its prime, it is definitely not chopped liver!  Longtime fans

of the series will be able to appreciate the artistic output of

Serling et. al. in the hour format.  They will also appreciate

the fact that they can view the hour-long episodes--rarely seen
