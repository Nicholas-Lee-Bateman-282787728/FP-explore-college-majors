4387547,5,B004ISDU4S,"I absolutely adored this series.  Every member of the cast is first rate.  The writing has that touch of Britain that makes the series far more appealing to me than the American counterpart.  I find Alesha's character as the most compelling, but everybody commands my full attention.  Excellent series.  Five stars easily.",1367884800,3,322,5.115384615384615
4387548,1,B004ISDU4S,I was angry when I viewed this DVD and found out that it was the same as season 2 and season 3 was the same as season 1 of which I all ready have. The cost and trouble of sending them back is far greater than just chucking them into the trash where they belong.,1358380800,11,261,3.7636363636363637

8431125,5,B004ISDU4S,"I am partial to this series because of the police's sympathy to the affected. This is no longer true in some of our police actions in the US with Ferguson, Baltimore and other cities suffering extreme examples of misunderstanding and such force that people are killed before meaningful conversations can be started.",1447200000,,315,5.076923076923077
