3912446,5,B002DQSKMY,"Theses movies where made in the late 1970's to the mid 80's for people who enjoyed going to the drive in.  Most of these movies shows alot of T&A as movies of this type do.  Most of the movies in this collection are great to watch.  Like ""CAVE GIRL"".  This is about a high school nerd while on a school field trip.  Get caught up in a science experiment that send him back to the stone age.  Here he meets and falls in love with a cave girl.
All so inclued in the collection is; ""THE BEACH GIRLS"",""COACH"", ""HUNK"",""JOCK"",""MALIBU BEACH"",""MY CHAUFFEUR"",""MY TUTOR"",""THE POM POM GIRLS"",""TOMBOY"" (A MUST SEE MOVIE.). ""THE VAN"" AND ""WEEK END PASS""",1298678400,9,640,4.521739130434782

3912448,5,B002DQSKMY,"This 12 collection of movies was well worth the cheap price.  You get 12 unknown/never heard of comedy films that are mostly from the 1980's and few that are from the 1970's. The picture and audio quality was not that great, but very watchable- due to disk compression, 12 movies on 3 disks. There were some actors in the films that went on to become well known film stars.  Most of the films were funny or entertaining. My favorites were My Tutor, My chauffeur, The Pom pom girls, Jocks, Cavegirl and The Van.  This set is highly recommended.  There is a lot of great classic 1980's cheese to love in this set!  You really can't go wrong buying this set just for the entertainment value!",1284422400,4,688,4.472

3912450,4,B002DQSKMY,"If you are just an average collector of 80's movies, then this collection is absolutely great! you can't beat the price for all the movies your getting! And all the movies are classic 80's gold!
However, These are double sided disc's, containing two movies per side. There is quite a bit of compression on all of the films. So, if your an rabid fan of the 80's, and want the best transfers that can be found...you might want to track down the individual releases of each film. Be warned though: some movies on this set are OOP, you might have a hard time finding some of them elsewhere.",1276128000,9,586,4.435185185185185

The DVDs themselves still come in sleeves as always. but Mill creek spent a few more dollars on their cases to ensure they are not crushed or damaged during the shipping process.

They is some nudity to these films after all most were made in the shadows of films such as Porky's, and Fast Time at Ridgemont High (or at least 7 or 8 of them were) and basically have the same type of subject material.

Now if Millcreek would just distribute decent copies of H.O.T.S., Hollywood Hot Tubs, and a few similar films, I would really be happy.",1257292800,38,1147,5.684210526315789

Packed full of laughter, big hair and bright make-up, guys trying to score and girls who just wanna have fun, this is the ultimate 'feel good' experience for those who don't like movies that make you think too hard. Not every movie is great but there is enough classics on here to justify the couple you may not appreciate so much. If like me you think that they just don't make them like they used to then you need to add this to your collection.",1257033600,22,521,4.1683168316831685
3912455,3,B002DQSKMY,"The packaging is a keepcase with the discs stored in envelopes. Two movies per side, four movies per disc. I'm not going to bother with a content review but spec-wise, you can expect the following:

The Beach Girls - anamorphic widescreen - 91 minutes
Cavegirl - anamorphic widescreen - 81 minutes
Coach - anamorphic widescreen - 96 minutes
Hunk - anamorphic widescreen - 102 minutes
Jocks - anamorphic widescreen - 91 minutes
Malibu Beach - anamorphic widescreen - 90 minutes
My Chauffeur - fullframe - 97 minutes
My Tutor - anamorphic widescreen - 97 minutes
The Pom Pom Girls - anamorphic widescreen - 85 minutes
Tomboy - anamorphic widescreen - 90 minutes
The Van - fullframe - 89 minutes
Weekend Pass - anamorphic widescreen - 89 minutes

All prints are actually quite clean, minus the digital compression artifacts from stuffing so much on a disc. The Pom Pom Girls starts off pretty scratchy but cleans up after 10 minutes or so. It's easily the worst looking of the bunch.

Only 3 stars due to the completely avoidable compression artifacts.  You can't stuff 10 pounds of crap into a 5 pound sack.",1256083200,138,1105,4.769633507853404

Most of the time they spread the old CPI movies throughout their Genre multi-packs.  But this is one of the few multi-packs where they have put the old CIP movies in one place.
  While I already have many of these films in other collections.  But it is great to have alot of these old drive-in/B-rate films in one package.  Many of these most of us older people will remember.  And many of these films have then unknown stars that are now famous (Like Mariska Hagartay).  So if one doesn't mind good Drive-In fare to watch, than this is an excellent set to pick up",1401321600,2,732,4.561538461538461

3912479,5,B002DQSKMY,I love this genre of entertainment.  It takes me back to my days of High School and College.  This package of movies was delivered on time and very well wrapped.  I am almost all of the way through the films now and they are surprisingly good quality.  Only one  film was not up to the standards of the others.  My only complaint (not a big one) is that the discs are not labeled however it does not take long to use a marker pen to resolve that issue.  For the quality and quantity of this product it seems underprices.  Luv it!,1398384000,,529,4.1683168316831685

3912482,5,B002DQSKMY,"This set contains several B movies all of which contains a certain level of raunchiness. I bought it for the beefcake factor in some of the movies. For instance, My Chauffeur co-stars Sam Jones, who bare his buns while running nude in a park. Beach Girls features James Daughton (of Animal House fame) baring his beautiful buns in a strip down on the beach. Also, hunky blond Michael Biehn is bare-assed in Coach. Robert Carradine shows his bare buns in Pom Pom Girls. Naturally these movies feature plenty of bare boobies. Caren Kaye, who had appeared in several tv series in the late 70's and early 80's, frequently shows her boobies, but they did not boost her career.",1384732800,3,671,4.694915254237288

My main complaint is the packaging for the discs as they are only in sleeves and not in a clip holder which while okay to start off with could later lead to disc being scratched as you take them and put them back.",1377388800,2,473,4.031914893617022

It is perfect if you're trying to recall the overall ambience of movies from the 1980's. Exquisite blend of simple, lighthearted, playful storylines mixed with humor and totally radical dialogue.

3912498,2,B002DQSKMY,"Some reviewer have noted these films have a lot of T&A, but that's not really true. Certainly none of these films are what you would call nudies, there are no full frontal shots of either sex. The 'T' formula of the time called for one or two scenes where girls (rarely the star) rip open their their shirts for a few seconds or stroll in the background through a locker room. 'A' is the gang running down the beach to skinny dip or men in the locker room standing with their backs to the camera.

The only documentation is an alphabetical listing of the 12 movies on the back of the box showing date, run time, stars, and a brief description of the plot. Unfortunately this ordering does not match the order of the movies on the three disks, but each disk side is marked (in small text) with the names of the two movies on that side.",1363305600,,834,4.2784810126582276

Surprise! There are several decent movies in this collection (not good, mind you, but decent): The Beach Girls, which features Debra Blee, who looks a bit like Denise Richards but--if such a thing is possible--is even prettier; Hunk, which is a rather ridiculous take on the old deal with the devil motif; My Chauffeur, which stars Deborah Foreman in what should have been a breakout role--she's really funny; and Tomboy with Betsy Russell.

Weekend Pass, Malibu Beach, and My Tutor are also watchable if you're in the mood for very light entertainment.

Thats ok, you would expect something cheaply packaged. The 3 discs are double sided, and contain 2 movies on each of the flip sides. So beware if you hate those double sided discs, you may want to avoid this, although, as I said already, you'd expect these to be as cheap as possible for the quality of these movies.

""The Beach Girls"" - 2 and a half stars.
Had I not seen this on TV when I was much younger and would sit up to any hour of the night when its classification had ""contains nudity"" along with the title of the film. I think had I not seen it, it would have been a movie here I probably would have passed off as pretty bad acting in a near pointless film about a couple of college babes partying at a friends house on the beach. Sex, drugs and rock n roll all thrown in the mix to make up this typical cheesy 80's film. It has some pretty lame moments, and some music you will wish to forget, but it's one of the better movies in this package. Pointless fun, nothing all that memorable and I have grown out of that stage I just admitted to, so no points for the nudity, unlike some others would give extra stars for.

""Cavegirl"" 4 Stars
This is probably the best movie in the whole bunch. A group of high-schoolers go on an excursion to visit some mines for their geography class. The leading man of the movie is a nerd who somehow strays away from the group while exploring some caves and finds a crystal that sends him back to the caveman era. There he meeds Eeba (I think thats her name) and he teaches her some things and ends up falling in love with her. Will he return to his own time or stay with her? Watch it and find out. It's not just a cheesy 80's flick, this one actually had some funny and memorable moments and is not just a cheap boob flick.

""Coach"" 2 stars.
A seen it before story about a female coach who earns the respect of her pupils. However, unlike in something like ""Wild Cats"" this time around the student and teacher become involved and it ends in a ""That was the best summer of my life"" rubbish.

""Hunk"" 2 stars.
A goofy, but lame film, about a dweeb who makes a pact with the devil to sell his soul to become a beefed up hunk with everything. But along the ways he wonders if it is worth it or not.

""Jocks"" 0 Stars.
I couldn't even finish this movie; it's not just because the VHS transfer quality was so bad, it was because it was just boring me to tears that there was nothing going on other than some jocks trying to get laid and always football training.

""My Tutor"" - 1.5 Stars.
Not sure what the point of this movie was as I kept drifting in and out of consciousness. It stars some guy I recognize, but can't even be bothered to look it up who, so that was pointless for you to read.. it also co-stars an annoying young Crispon Glover. It had that big chested woman some pervs might recognize, but shes not even worth looking at in her small role as a hooker that the boys go to lose their virginity at the brothel of. The main guy's father hires him a tutor, and they get involved... blah, blah, blah. Personally, I thought it did not compare to ""Private Lessons"" and was far more less interesting.

""Malibu Beach"" - 1 Stars.
I can't even recall this one, so it couldn't have been any good.

""The Pom Pom Girls"" 1 star.
A pathetic cheerleader movie that tried to be a Porky's 3 plot, but failed at humor, acting ability and entertainment.

""Tomboy"" 2 stars.
I noticed a lot of praise in reviews from perverts of the 80's who seemed to follow this chicks roles around, just to see her naked. Well, I won't be rating anything based on what body parts are shown... I'm not 12 anymore. This movie is about a tomboy mechanic who meets her Nascar racing idol and falls in love with him. However for pretty much no reason she gets ticked at him and challenges him to a race. A bet is made with his sponsors that if she wins, using her own engine and car that she built herself, then they would use her stock as their racing car. What blows my mind is how stupid you would have to be to beleive this chicks computer and nitro powered jet car would be legal on the Nascar circuit no matter if she wins or not? Knight Rider much?

""The Van"" 1 star.
Zzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzz

""Weekend Pass"" 1 star.
4 actors pathetically playing sailors who get a weekend pass while docked and go in search of Californian babes. Nothing memorable to remember, hear, or see. Pathetic from the start, and finish, and probably in the middle where I was yawning and skipping chapters.

""My Chauffeur"" - 3 Stars.
I'm not sure if this was a decent movie, or it just seemed a lot better then the previous ones I had watched in this pack. It's about a posh limo company who are upper-class gentlemen. Then along comes the female lead, who is hired for unknown reasons at the time to become the first woman to be a driver for the company. The rest of the old farts hate her, except for one or two of them. She's basically a 80's 18-20 year old Madonna wannabe, with the 80's blonde hair, colorful outfits and cheeky attitude. Then she falls in love with the bosses son and some interesting developments occur. Not fantastic, but one of the better flicks here.

Overall, it's not a great must see package, but for the price, if you like old cheap 80's boob flicks, mostly set with 20 something year old's playing high-school kids, or college, or just out of school morons, then this cheapo set might interest you. The only movie here I would really recommend would be Cavegirl if it sounds like it might interest you.",1335484800,7,5880,4.267504488330341

8365897,1,B002DQSKMY,"The Latin phrase which titles my review means ""Let the buyer beware.""

And the main reason for saying that is that not one of the 12 movies featured in this collection is complete.  Every one of them has at least 4 minutes (in some cases more) cut out of the movie.  You can probably figure out without too much difficulty what is cut from the movies.  Let's just say that these movies, when first released, were rated ""R"" for several reasons, and that one of those reasons has been excised by Mill Creek Entertainment.

The least that Mill Creek Entertainment can do is put a ""truth in packaging"" notice on the package itself that says that the films were edited for content - as well as putting notice of same at the beginning of each film.  After noticing the cuts in ""The Pom Pom Girls,"" ""Coach,"" ""Cave Girl,"" and ""Malibu Beach,"" I ""did the math"" by comparing the listed running times on the back of the jewel box to the film's listed full running time on IMDB.

And, as at least one other reviewer has commented, the quality of the print for ""The Pom Pom Girls"" is really bad.  You'll find a lot better quality (to say nothing of seeing the WHOLE movie) on YouTube.

For whole, uncut copies of these films, look somewhere else.

And the packaging of the discs is such that it is very difficult to remove a disc from the jewel box without scratching it a little or leaving finger smudges on the disc.

No matter what the price or the quality of the movies' plots and acting:  very, very disappointing.",1485388800,7,1505,4.432727272727273
8365898,3,B002DQSKMY,"Putting two movies on a single layer is a waste of time. Dual layer would have only added a few cents to the production cost and made a much better saleable set.  Most are cropped on the top and bottom for the new 16 x 9 tv's of today.
I would have grouped them differently. Beach Girls and Malibu beach together, Coach and Jocks together, etc..
