203027,4,1932134670,"Gay Sex in the '70s is an excellent documentary on the heyday of sexual freedom post Stonewall and the sixties.  Here we see survivors of the early gay sexual revolution discussing the times and their recollections, clips from porn films of the period, stories of how sexual freedom and expirimentation defined the era of ""we are out"" and we're here and then the eventual fallout of such hedonism in the form of AIDS.  Well done, a bit nostalgic, and often surpisingly honest, this is a definite worthwhile gay doc. on a period that changed the community.  Sexually explicit in some scenes ( mostly porno clips), but well documented through archive photos and video.  Quite good.",1150070400,4,679,4.878260869565217
203028,5,1932134670,"i remember the 70s in NY as a gay man well.... the sex, the drugs, the sex. It was a euphoric and optimistic time. When the world was our playground and gay activism was at its peak. Optimism was not in short suppply. Little did we know that the epidemic of HIV/AIDS was merely around the corner. Joseph Lovett does an incredible job at capturing the decade. Its a blast to watch as well. The men are HOT!

The documentary also raises several important and relevant questions about the dynamics and activism (or lack there of) of the gay community today. This is a significant movie that should be seen be all!!!!!",1149724800,3,614,4.482142857142857

Gay sex in the 70s takes the viewer on a journey through the explosive period in the 1970s which was juxtaposed between hundreds of years of oppression and the AIDS epidemic which devasted the gay community. The movie successfully captures this brief yet incredibly libertine and optimistic time with both clarity and vigor. The result is a significant and thoughtprovoking piece which raises a whole slew of interesting questions.

Deeply disturbing in that those same commentators are very fortunate to be alive.  As I write this 3 of the main participants have passed. AIDS effectively ended the revolution and devastated the world that is so celebrated here.  That disease is presented as a footnote to the main theme of the work.

203045,1,1932134670,"I saw this joke of a ""documentary"".  It started out well; but then got very boring with the constant talk about nothing but what the title of the film is, and it focused way too much on NYC and the gay ghettos of Christopher Street, Chelsea, and Astoria.

I hoped the documentary would focus on other cities besides NYC or SF, or even small towns telling what it was like to be bisexual, gay, or an LGBT person in the 70s; but it did not.

The people interviewed in the documentary were the silly and boring drama queen Larry Kramer, random gay white men who all lived in NYC in gay ghettos, and the insane photographer Tom Bianchi who is quoted as saying how if he could go back in time and hypothetically not get infected with HIV he would not do this since he would miss out on being intimate with a very, very large number of men.

Hearing gay men talk about their sex lives is boring and they just would go on and on about how they had a very large number of sexual partners who they did not know, got STDs or infected with HIV, did not have long lasting partnerships or relationships, were self destructive with drugs and alcohol, had sex in public in parks, on Fire Island, in bath houses, in the dangerous Chelsea pier structures that were falling apart, in parked trucks, and in parks.  It got very boring hearing about all of this.

I am glad I did not pay to see this documentary as it was on Netflix.  Reading books like And the band played on,and Andrew Holleran's Dancer from the Dance gives one an idea of the silly and self destructive hedonism of the 1970s before HIV/AIDS, and just why so many gay men were self destructive, did not practice safer sex or figured that condoms should only be used by people who engage in sex with women, and just why so many gay men died of AIDS or were infected with HIV and STDs during the 70s.",1385769600,2,1846,4.287356321839081

It is amazing that such practices were widely accepted and that they resulted in social revolution.

203050,4,1932134670,"This is a documentary from the film maker Josephn Lovett, he actually appears in this too. He tracks gay life in New York from 1969 and the Stonewall riots, to 1981 and the beginning of the AIDS epidemic. It uses a mix of still photos, interviews and archive film from the era to tell the tale.

It is said that this period was the most sexually liberating since the times of the Roman Empire and that certainly seemed to be the case. Absolutely everyone seemed to be having more sex than they could handle, at one time one of the commentators called it the `narcotic of sex'. It was a bit like the old advert for `Martini' - `anytime, anyplace, anywhere etc'. There are some heart felt pieces about the repression that was taking place before the change in attitude, and sadly a lot of that still exists like the religious cures for being gay and even then the use of electro shock therapy as well as medication. It was also classified as a deviant mental illness.

We are taken on a tour of saunas, night clubs, back rooms, sub ways and the disused piers that used to line the Hudson. There were also the back of the `meat trucks', where you basically took a chance by entering (no pun intended) and as one guy says if you managed to leave with an orgasm and your wallet then you were doing fine.  We are given a taste of the politics, the drug use and the eventual wake up call that was AIDS. There are some genuinely touching moments when some of the participants talk about lost loved ones and we are not talking a few but way too many who were taken too soon.

I genuinely liked this documentary, it is only 71 minutes long and I would have liked to have seen more footage of the era and more of the music too, but that is my choice, this never portrayed itself as a gay disco party after all. For anyone interested in gay history this is pretty much a must see. It is only limited to New York so may seem a bit parochial given the title; for lovers of period gay cinema, I can recommend `Taxi zum Klo'<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Taxi-Zum-Klo/dp/B00483K13G/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Taxi Zum Klo</a>&nbsp;and `Nighthawks'&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Nighthawks-Strip-Jack-Naked-Blu-ray/dp/B001QGO3IM/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Nighthawks / Strip Jack Naked [Blu-ray</a>]both truly excellent.",1326585600,,2387,5.005037783375315
203051,4,1932134670,"I think this documentary was very well done. While the title should have been more specific,I think the documentary itself is a poignant series of narratives about a unique point in gay American history. A period that ends so tragically too, have a box of Kleenex nearby, the personal accounts are affecting. It's only about an hour so I don't know why anyone would complain about the length of the doc( Have people's attention spans shortened that much? I hope not.) Some of the people they interviewed have more interesting stories to tell than others but as someone who is not American and was a child during the 80's this was an interesting gathering of voices. I loved Baltrop's archived photographs of the docks, the streets,and Bianchi's Fire Island album. But they don't gloss over the negative aspects of this new era of openly pursued pleasure. The drug use was obviously excessive and  Bianchi expresses his reservations about random sex in a dark truck with 20 other people. This was a risky area where people were hurt or murdered and then came HIV/AIDS. I have to say that I could care less about Studio 54, that part of the documentary was not interesting since it was mainly a place for the elitists to hang out. The ethnically diverse night club was the most interesting of all the clubs they described. I would have liked to have heard and seen more about that. The bathhouses and pornography of the era were interesting as well. Joe Lovett talks to young gay men as well and aside from the usual superficial types, a few of the young guys acknowledge the struggles, praise those who came before them, and clearly know the attacks on queer sex and gender identity are far from over. Susan Tomkin, Tom Bianchi, and Alvin Baltrop are the best interviewees in the documentary, especially Baltrop who mentions the best thing about those days was ""having friends..."" which honors the memory of so many people who died shortly after becoming sexually free for the first time in their lives. I recommend this for those who are interested in this striking period.",1323820800,,2073,4.758333333333334
203052,5,1932134670,"Without being raunchy and taking a chance on not getting this review published,
I will say that this documentary is a good chronicle of the innocence,
wildness, decadence and recklessness of the gay community in the 1970's.
After the Stonewall Riots in 1969, gay men and women all over the U.S.
decided that they weren't going to be beaten up, pushed around and mistreated
anymore!---They decided that they were not going to live their lives in the closet
anymore, that nothing was wrong with them, they were beautiful and decent (well some of us!),
and that they were going to live life to the fullest of their personalities and
effect change in the laws of this country which they loved and paid taxes to live in!

Out of that general constructive ethos came the gay rennaisance of the 1970's!
This was a very magical, innocent, wild & frightening time all at once,
and here are some of the survivors who lived it, breathed it, snorted it, DID IT,
on a scale of hedonism not seen since ancient roman & greek times! (-:
Some of their stories are racey and raunchy, the archival footage is racey
in places, poppers, weed & coke are prevalent, but that's how they
rolled in the 70's! (-: It talks about the parties, the infamous baths,
the various clubs with different scenes for the different tastes of gay men,
it shows the openess and freeness, the recklessness of the piers and the
trucks in the old meat-packing (no pun intended) district, the drug chic,
the seeming never-neverland of Fire Island, and ultimately the heavy toll
(perhaps) that all of that wild, free and debaucherous living took in the early 80's,
when a new, horrible, mysterious ""gay cancer"" started to wipe out gay men
in droves and shut the door on the forever summer party boys fantasy forever!

Well, this film also shows how that same community got sober, woke up and
started to fight back against the ravages of this disease, which by 1985,
had a name, AIDS...But many were lost in those early days when nothing was
known about it, drugs were limited, and fear was high!
Many saw it as a divine judgement against gay men for what they deemed
as an unsavory & immoral lifestyle. (Nothing about AIDS is DIVINE!!)
But the gay community rallied, educated itself, and thanks to the struggles
and sacrifices of people like the late Harvey Milk and others, realized that
they had a political voice as well!
So there was much good that came from those very bad times.
But I liked that this film shows the pioneer group, the first generation
of liberated gay men who stepped out there, wild & free, and the doors that
had kept them oppressed in the closet were knocked down forever!

The younger generations of gay men and women are left to digest and discuss
these lessons and to use what they learn as it applies to their day and time.
This is good viewing for a young, entitled & frivolous gay community which
pretty much knows nothing of the struggles and gains of the past as they face
discrimination (Prop 8, The Struggle For Legal Acknowledgement of Same-Sex Marriage,
Enactment of Hate Crime Laws For Protection Under The Law, etc.) in today's world!
Even though much has been gained, the lessons of the past can educate and
strengthen you in your resolve to fight today, if you just pay attention.",1257984000,7,3276,4.644827586206897

203054,2,1932134670,"""These fragments I have shored against my ruins.""  These final lines from T. S. Eliot's ""The Wasteland"" are a nifty metaphorical device used by this surprisingly brief and innocuous documentary of a time when there were virtually no restrictions on what is normally repressed and taboo.  By interviewing some of the survivors, beginning with a subject who collects the photos of long-lost friends on broken shards, the filmmaker attempts to retrieve the days of Sodom (NYC in the film).  Were the fragments pieces of a puzzle, the film might have proven a more productive occupation of the viewer's time.  As it stands, the movie is little more than what most viewers probably already remember or know.  Those who weren't there will find more graphic accounts in the contemporaneous articles and advertisements of, for example, ""The Village Voice.""

I recall a day in 1979 when a protest against the making of a William Friedkin (""The Exorcist"") film starring Al Pacino (""Cruisin'"") caused enough of a stir to disrupt classes at NYU.  Even at the time, it wasn't clear to me what was so offensive about the movie--it was scripted in such a way as to make Pacino, an undercover, ""straight"" cop assigned to find a murderer by infiltrating the gay meeting places--the bars, the baths, the theaters, the piers, the trucks, the abandoned riverfront buildings--ultimately question his own assumptions about his own sexual identity.  Supposedly, the gay community was upset because the film would promote stereotypes.  The recollections of those interviewed for this movie merely confirm the foundation for such fears.

Perhaps what sets this film apart from others is its unwillingness to mourn or moralize. Little is made of the numerous casualties of the nemesis that decimated the citizens of Sodom after 1980.  Instead, the film focuses on a few of the more educated, thoughtful survivors (including an English professor), who express both regret for the end of the bacchanal as well as awareness of the steep price of excess.  The interviewees make some weak attempts to rationalize the party (the inevitable outcome of years of repression; the necessary purging preceding a discovery and acceptance of one's true identity).  But it's amateurish, overly-familiar psychologizing--too little too late.

As any teacher of composition wearies of asking student writers over and over again: ""Where's your thesis? What's your point?""",1249948800,6,2426,5.235142118863049
203055,5,1932134670,This is a great Documentary not only about Gay Sex in the 70's but also about being a Gay man in the hayday of 1970's NYC. It's about a movement of sexual freedom.

203056,4,1932134670,"This documentary reveals details of gay nightlife in the decade between the burgeoning sense of freedom engendered by the Stonewall riots and the emergence of the devastating AIDS epidemic that cast a shadow of death over casual sex.

Many reviewers criticize this film for its focus on New York, but I suspect that the Big Apple serves as a microcosm for gay scenes all over the world.  It is a fascinating social document of a much persecuted population.  It shouldn't be difficult for straight men to empathize with their gay brothers who sought anonymous sex in such dicey locations as the rickety New York docks, where some amorous adventurers actually fell to their deaths through the decaying boards.  Just imagine if there were hundreds of beautiful, willing women just waiting for whoever came along in the dark.  If you don't think that straight men would flock there by the hundreds, you're living in a fantasy world.  If you think they would, then you should have no trouble understanding the men in this film.  However, a chilling subtext arises: the AIDS virus was probably incubating and being passed around during much of this decade.

This film brought back many memories for me, as even though I grew up in Perth, Western Australia, all that was happening in NYC was reflected here and we all longed to visit ""The Village"" and Studio 54, lived, danced and drugged like we were there ourselves.

The telling of a seminal time in the history of gay culture very wisely resists a flash and sizzle style that could so easily have led this down the wrong path. Instead you have a good balance of interviews and flashback archival footage. The interviews are pretty much exclusive to the rare few who were actually there and are still here to tell the tale, recounting a  time that helped define what the word liberation meant to thousands of gay men during the heyday of Gay Liberation. Sandwhiched between the repression of pre-Stonewall 60's and the devastation of the AIDS crisis in the 80's, this is a great look at a halcyon period in our history with multiple repercussions which will still be felt in decades to come.",1202428800,,781,4.618705035971223
203060,3,1932134670,"This film serves a valuable purpose by covering a topic that is mostly ignored by other chroniclers of Gay History in the 70's, However it has its own biasis and leaves one surprisingly gaping hole.  The subjects interviewed are all knowlegeable and generous in sharing their personal recollections, and through their stories it's possible to get a glimpse of this otherwise blacked out area of gay culture.  Unfortunatley the viewer might be led to believe that EVERYONE was using drugs back then.  This is not so.  While drugs were certainly prevelent at the trucks and the baths and the back-room-bars, and the abandoned piers, many people chose not to partake.  In fact it was possible to frequent these places regularly, engage in sexual acts with mulitple partners, and still avoid partnering with people who were high or intoxicated.  It was also possible, after spending hours sampling from a vast tapestry of different partners, to end the evening in the bed of a carefully selected mate, or to bring him home to your own apartment.  I did these frequently, always sober, and (almost) always with sober partners.  The other glaring omission of the film is the lack of any mention of Subway ""Tea-Rooms"". It is amazing that none of those interviewed talks about it.  I am sure that they all must have had ample experiences in them.  Younger people today find it hard to believe that subways stations even ever used to have bathrooms. But once upon a time every single subway station, in every borough, was required to have a bathroom that was working and accessible 24 hours. And what's more, Gay sex was going on all day long in every single one of them.  Until the late 60's it cost a dime to enter them. Then, a law suit required the City to make them free.  In the early 80's, in the face of the early AIDS hysteria, Mayor Koch closed them all down, together with the bath houses.  And we all mourned.  submitted by Steve Ashkinazy",1183680000,13,1942,4.707100591715976
203061,3,1932134670,"*Gay Sex in the 70s* was an interesting documentary of sex among the gays from the Stonewall Riot (1969) to the emergence of AIDS (1980), or rather what they had initially coined it as the gay cancer.  However, this is gay sex in New York City.  I was somewhat disappointed of its limited scope.  I would've liked to see what gay life/sex was like in San Francisco, Key West and other places.  However, NYC did have a lot to offer on the history of gay sex in the 70s: the meat district, Christopher St., the piers, Fire Island, the Pines, Studio 54, bars, baths and other places.

This was like the utopia/apex of gay sex.  Men could have it anywhere and anytime, without a care who was looking at them.  Despite the celebration of ""free love"", it wasn't all carefree.  Gays still have to be careful where they ventured or else they could end up dead.  Plus, there were STD's (then called V.D.) around.

This film would have been more delightful if more people were interviewed rather than just the notables, such as Larry Kramer and Tom Bianchi.  I mean, it was great to include them but how about the regular guys?

Nonetheless, this is an important film for anyone queer or anyone studying queer history.",1181260800,3,1208,4.541666666666667
203062,4,1932134670,"As a young gay man this documentary is a very important relic in the gay history archives. As GLBT people in the new millenium we have this generation to thank for our liberation from the proverbial closet. These guys celebrated who they were and never apologized to anyone. They were the first truly liberated generation of gay men. Without them issues such as gay marraige and equality for GLBT's wouldn't even be on most political referendums.

With that said ""Gay Sex in the 70's"" was an eye opener! These men took free love and pride to it's apex. I often wonder, as someone who has never known a world without HIV/AIDS, would I have reveled in the hedonism and decadence of the 1970's? I won't lie, I would have had it off with a few. However, many of these guys, had they lived now, would be diagnosed as sexual addicts. It seemed like sex was the penultimate reason for existence as a gay man back then. While the celebration of sexual freedom and each other was a beautiful thing the blatant disregard for one's own health and well being was dumbfounding. The subject of ""The trucks"" disturbed me. They were willing to go anywhere, with anyone, just to have a moment of pleasure.

While gay men involved themselves in every sexual excess you can fathom they were innocent babes in the woods, for the most part. That is what really struck me. Rampant drug use, orgies, and public sex were just the norm in the community, and no one gave it a second thought. The sexual freedom and self love was wonderful, but there was still a degree of self loathing that came with a high price that their's and subsequent generations are paying for. The pendulum definitely shifted and that generation paid dearly for it's excesses.

Overall, I was really impressed by the documentary. My only critiques are as follows...

1.)What were the gay scenes in: San Francisco, Los Angeles, Atlanta, Houston, Chicago, Dallas, and various other metropolises like? We only got the view of New York City.

2.)What were gay men of color(black,non black latinoes, and Asians)up to?

To me this film showcased a small microcosm of gay life in those days. Gay Sex in the 70's, I feel, would have been better served had we been made privy to ALL facets of gay life not just the elite white gay activists in NYC. Perhaps this could have been done as a series. In my opinion it was a bit too comprehensive. I wanted to know more. And I particularly wanted to know more about the toll HIV/AIDS took on the community.

However, I am glad this film was made. Inspite of it's shortcomings it was insightful. I recommend it.

As for the person who suggested that AIDS not be cured in order to ensure no more sexual revolutions you are sick. The repulsive puritanical attitude that some people have towards sex and sexuality is mind boggling.",1178236800,4,2812,4.62124248496994
203063,3,1932134670,"The title of this documentary is misleading--it should be called Gay Sex in New York City in the 70's.  If it were titled properly, I could give it a higher rating, given that the bulk of the material comes from a half dozen subjects who lived in NYC in the 1970's.  The film purports to describes the gay male lifestyle during the pivotal period between the 1969 Stonewall riots and the first reported cases of AIDS in 1981.  In truth, it is a self-celebratory trip down nostalgia lane for a group of gay men who were active during that glittery, liberated, and risky time.  Their stories are interesting individually, but do not provide enough substance (or alternate viewpoints) for an entire documentary.  There is much more to the history of gay males, and to the decade of the seventies, than the slice that this documentary focuses on.  Anyone who doesn't have a personal frame of reference for the memories is likely to be bored by the sheer length of the film, despite the fact that there is great source material.",1176940800,4,1023,4.655555555555556
203064,5,1932134670,"The 70's were an amazing convergence of socialogical factors.  Joyful Gay men, for the first time, found they could practice their desires without undo police brutality.  The Stonewall Riots had cemented the arrival of Out as a verb.  It was literally a time of great happiness and fun.

This document, which includes much archival footage well as current rememberances by folks who were there, gives a guided tour of what could only be called Babylon.

Narrowing its focus to NYC, and The Pines, it gives an up-close and personal look at men who lusted for other men and what a wonderland a world of 'Yes' could create.  The tone shifts, because even though the name of the documentary is Gay Sex in the 70's, it takes you through the '80's and the advent of the AIDS pandemic.

It helps explain the mindset of those men trapped in the opening wave of deaths.  AIDS had literally infected (and in effect killed) a huge percentage of the gay men in NYC before the first syptom appeared.

It also discusses some of the hollowness of that age; the rampant drug abuse and mind-boggling disregard for personal safety that accompanied so much of 'the love that dare not speak its name' once it was shouting at the top of its lungs.  I am actually old enough to have participated in this, and knew many men who did.  They are all gone.  I am not, primarily because I was hiding from who and what I was.

I literally hid until after AIDS hit, and by then, I was too careful to ever put myself in harms way.  This movie tries to help the modern viewer see that these were intelligent, albiet driven, men.  They thought, as many folks do today, that medical science would cure whatever ailed them.  They were wrong, and those who see AIDS as nothing more than an inconvenience are just as wrong.

Required viewing for all men on 'the down low' or anyone young enough not to recall this time.",1175990400,6,1882,4.504424778761062
203065,2,1932134670,"This documentary celebrates a 12-year period between the Stonewall riots in 1969 and the beginning of the AIDS epidemic in 1981, a decade of gay sexual liberation. Unfortunately, the film is very limited to the New York gay scene, and to the experiences of five or six men who giddily recount their youthful days of irresponsible and hedonistic, drug-fueled lust. After its first 10 minutes of showing these men revel in their experience of finding anonymous sexual partners, and the frequency of these encounters, the documentary quickly grew tiresome and repetitive, and purveyed a somewhat sad and empty soullessness about their experience. At least the film doesn't preach about how more medical research money needs to be dedicated to curing AIDS so that the lifestyle of bathhouse orgies and rampant drug use can be restored for a younger generation of gay men.",1171497600,11,867,5.112676056338028
203066,4,1932134670,"While I was only a kid during the 70s, this documentary provides a fascinating, bittersweet snapshot of the ""golden age of gay sex,"" i.e. after Stonewall and before full-blown AIDS - along with Friedkin's ""Cruising,"" this doc shows us what NYC must have been like if you were young, hot, and single - and even if you weren't you could score, too. Hard to believe that this time period is only two decades ago, but it seems like a distant world, a long-lost era so alien from out contemporary culture. I wish the film had made an attempt to also cover other area around the nation like SF, LA, etc. but this insider glimpse of NYC nostalgia makes you pine for ""the good old days"" even if, in tragic hindsight, we know they could literally kill you.",1155513600,8,747,4.45985401459854
203067,5,1932134670,"I first saw ""Gay Sex in the 70's"" at the venerable Castro Theatre in San Francisco's Castro neighborhood while visiting friends.  The movie audience that day was respectful and serious -- there were no adolescent-ish hootings or catcalls.  This movie is a documentary, not a porno film, although there are some graphic sex scenes that are obviously part of what is being documented.

The thematic gist of the documentary could have been, BUT WASN'T, some Puritanical maxim about ""if you play around, you're gonna pay a price.""  Instead, the gist was that a suppressed subculture seized their opportunity to become liberated, and then further seized the opportunity to react in a responsible way to some subsequent negative consequencies of their liberation.  Some of the footage is raw because the topics are covered in an authentic way and not ""studio-produced.""  As a former college teacher of history, I would recommend this film for GLBTQ history classes.  As a practicing RN, I would recommend the film as part of any sex education classes, but I'm sure the ""Christian Taliban"" Fundamentalists would oppose most of the scenes!  As an ordained minister (Divine Science and Christian New Thought), I'd recommend the film for sensitivity training and for ministerial preparation classes.  I and many who saw the movie at The Castro left with tears in our eyes -- tears of Pride and appreciation, and a resolve to ""be good humans"" working for a better world out ""in the life.""

203068,4,1932134670,"I was there, and I found this film accurate.  I have less nostalgia about the period though because, though it was a period of unrestrained hedonism it was also a period of transition and upheaval.  In a very short time we went from total anonymity to visibility, and the experience was jarring for those in the gay community that took part and those looking on.  This was not quite underlined in the film.  While it was true that sex was lying around waiting to be picked up, this came at a price.  The price was intimacy.  Liberation came to mean being able to be promiscuous without shame; this had its upside.  However, by and large, it didn't seem to diminish loneliness or desperation for a lot of people, and for many others it barred connection.  The film portrayed the times honestly, and it was good to see the survivors as well as to remember those who didn't survive.",1152489600,15,879,4.518987341772152
203069,3,1932134670,"I wasn't part of the Gay scene in New York in the 70's, so I can't empathize with the ""nostalgia"" other reviewers found in Joseph Lovettt's Gay Sex in the 70's. In fact, I found it much like being invited to someone's house so's they could show you their slide collection, grainy black-and-white 8 mm footage and listen to their interesting commentary about  what fun they had in the good-old-days.

I think the six-or-so narrators, some still quite handsome, have preserved their memories with interesting photos and a few pieces of motion photography. But their vision is limited to the West Village, the pier-and-truck scence, some hot (at the time) clubs and some snazzy photos of Fire Island. To watch this DVD, one might conclude that there was no sex west of the Hudson!!!

The wrap up is a tragedy as the men explain how they and their friends paid for this decade-long romp. One, we in the post 80's era, know all too well.

I won't revisist the DVD. Had I known it's contents, I'd have invited a few friends over to watch the rental.",1150243200,3,1043,4.591397849462366
203070,4,1932134670,"I had the good fortune to live/play in New York in the 1960s and 1970s with, among others fabs, Mapplethorpe. This documentary is happily nostalgic, but seems a bit incomplete in that it does not even mention the iconic Manhattan playgrounds called the Everard Baths and The Mineshaft where everyone on Lovett's screen ended up after cruising the piers, bars, and discos.

Interesting talking heads are cast, but mostly take up too much time that might have been shared with some other surviving talking heads from NY. I loved docu as far as it goes, but it was, in my 2-cent opinion, only 65% of the true gay 70s NY so many of us lived. As companion feature, watch Friedkin's film ""Cruising"" which dares feature a darker vision of us creatures of the night, including the casting of ""atmosphere crowds"" of men, many of whom were the actual players in the Titanic 70s in NY before the iceberg of AIDS.

For neophytes who need intro to this glorious ancient pioneer history, Lovett's is a safe and charming introduction, and for us who lived it, a nice bit of nostalgia down the fast lane of Christopher Street.

As a longtime San Franciscan, I can't wait until Lovett does San Francisco gay-male sex in the Titanic 70s---which no one has yet paid more than ""lip service"" to in docu films.",1150156800,4,1288,4.640350877192983

I am glad that I did.  I enjoy documentaries a lot and this feature included many black and white photographic stills, of which I am also a fan.  The filmmaker managed to capture the libertine displays in all their candidness without crossing the line into the lewd.  I attribute it to the use of black and white photography---none of those fleshy pinks to shock the viewer.  The  activities discussed are limited to the New York area.  Within that environ, however, the viewer is taken into places as diverse as bathhouses, cargo trucks and night clubs.  For the people who want to know and have been too afraid to ask, this is a good primer for you.  It's funny in the recounting as well as poignant, for many people are no longer alive to share the stories.  The filmmaker avoids the usual musical selection.  He opts for disco, of course, but it is not the usual playlist.  The soundtrack offers a good choice of tunes that will harken to a party attended.  The people who are interviewed are well spoken and it's obvious they have a background in the arts.  It is factual and never forced.  These are guys you'd like to sit around and have cocktails with.  They're interesting people and you know they've got a lot to tell.  Outside of New York, the scene was somewhat more inclusive, in that the community was smaller and tighter.  A club would be mixed, or would have nights where it was limited to one sex or the other.  We had no problems with one bathroom in 1981, despite the sturm und drang it seems to be causing as of late.  Smaller towns or areas outside of New York, also have a history, and I would like to see it more fully told someday.",1516492800,,1826,4.407185628742515
