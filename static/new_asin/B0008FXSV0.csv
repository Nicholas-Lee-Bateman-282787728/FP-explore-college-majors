8187369,4,B0008FXSV0,"Every episode is incredibly fast paced and lasts for about 4 minutes each (3 minutes excluding the intro). However, the great jokes and random events makes it feel like 4 minutes is just about enough. The characters are great as well, as they're not following the usual ""anime"" formula. The main character is a crude and lazy loli, her little sister is too honest for her own good and there's even a typical ""handsome"" guy crazy about her 5 year old sister. And let's not even get started on the onion character, abarenbou...

The price tag is a bit steep for a dvd with less than a hour in content, especially when funimation's ""s.a.v.e."" sets are about the same price for a 24 episode long series, but it's absolutely worth the money. Buy if you're looking for a cute/random gag anime, without any hint of ecchi/nudity.",1397692800,2,821,4.623287671232877

8187371,4,B0008FXSV0,"Really cute series. Loved the songs (bought a cd), but I thought the humor was a Little weird (though I did understood them). That aside, I did really like this series.",1147824000,,168,4.451612903225806
8187372,5,B0008FXSV0,"It was pretty much along the lines of what I expected. The limited edition version is nice, although expensive. I would recommend seeking out a sample of the series before deciding to get the limited edition. One bad thing about the dub, is that you might get worried about getting used to it. In the case of Di Gi Charat, several different series exist, all of which are licensed by different American companies. ADV's voice cast is different than the ones on this DVD, and judging by the Bandai trailer for Di Gi Charat Nyo on this DVD, they'll have a different cast too.",1130457600,3,573,4.519230769230769
8187373,5,B0008FXSV0,"When I went to Broccoli's panel at the Fanime convention, I was waiting to hear news of this.  The Di Gi Charat original series finally released domestically - and in such a killer box set!  Here's what you'll be getting:

-The DVD with all 16 episodes

-A ""Party Night"" CD single

-Jewelry box

-Figures of Dejiko, Puchiko, and Usada

-A voucher for a t-shirt that resembles the one Takeshi wears, with the stretched-out Dejiko face (the Broccoli rep explained they included a voucher so you could select what size shirt you want)

-A DGC manga

-Booklet with translation notes and other informations

This is the essential Di Gi Charat release that many American fans have been looking forward to.  I'm so glad Broccoli finally was able to release the series here.  If you enjoy off-the-wall, cute, and funny anime, Di Gi Charat will be great for you nyo!",1117756800,10,857,4.716216216216216

An excellent anime for chibi anime fans and Japanese comedy lovers.

POPULARITY ASSESSMENT

Ahhh...the ever popular Di Gi Charat. Overseas, that is. Di Gi Charat is an extremely popular anime in Japan, although its popularity never really lifted off in the U.S. This anime is basically a cornerstone for parodies on popular action, romance, and slapstick based anime that hit the super popular lists in Japan. It's ultra cute characters skyrocketed it in the video-gaming/pop culture area of Japan's youth(not to mention tons of adults:)). If you're familiar with magazines like Megami and any of the Dengeki ones, you're already blasted with zillions of ads for this series. Tons of songs and CD albums have sprouted from this chibi(small/cute-style characters with the huge eyes and slightly chubby bodies) anime.

APPEAL

The appeal of the series is mainly in its nostalgic value. Note that you can enjoy it without having seen many other anime, but not to its full extent. Watching it without some understanding of anime cliques will make this anime seem bizarre.

OVERVIEW

The comedy, as I stated before, is a collaboration of parodies which bring up lots of concepts from several hit anime series without making it strictly parody-based anime.

HUMOR ALERT!

The humor in this anime is VERY VERY VERY Japanese! If you aren't very fond of their humor and are a fan of only action shounen anime or are looking for a really concrete plot or something like that, this anime is not for you. HOWEVER, if you're a lover of Japanese comedy like myself and are very fond of fun and colorful characters, you will LOVE this anime.

FURTHER VIEWING

Note that this anime seems sort of unfulfilled without watching the follow up, Panyo Panyo Digi Charat as well, but the story really doesn't leave anything undone.",1115337600,4,1821,4.957236842105263
