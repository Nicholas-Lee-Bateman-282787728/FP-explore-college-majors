679254,3,6303562337,"MY RATING-7.4
Impossible to fail with a formula like this- A gangster is killed by his partner and the Devil gives him the chance of coming back to the world of the living in the body of a judge, to corrupt people. Paul Muni is very nice here, spoofing his own image of gangster as well as Claude Rains, who we believe is really Satan. Anne Baxter is also very sweet and young as the judge's girlfriend.
Spite its age, the mov goes quite well and it's entertaining enough.",1040428800,2,472,4.314606741573034
679255,4,6303562337,"A beautiful rewriting of Faust. A bad guy is killed by anotHer crook when coming out of prison and finds himself in hell. But he is a perfect image of a judge who fights against corruption. So Satan proposes a deal : get into the judge's body and destroy his reputation. But it will not work that way and the bad boy will completely destroy Satan's plan. He negociates then his  promotion  in hell as a trustee, one of the bosses. He is in a way saved from damnation but in hell itself. Very entertaining and interesting to see how Satan miscalculated his project : a bad guy put in the body of a good guy is transformed by the transfer, and even some of his bad guy's natural reactions fire back and produce the opposite effect : it increases the good image of the judge. In other words one is bad or good according to the surrounding circumstances in which one lives, according to the picture the public has of this one, a good or bad representation.

679256,4,6303562337,"I had wanted to view this film for quite some time and when it arrived at my doorstep and later was loaded into my VCR it was all I had hoped for. Well written, solidly acted and directed, suspense laden yet humorous, the movie was definately as good as I'd heard. Especially outstanding is the performance of Claude Rains but it doesn't overpower the rest of the cast's excellent acting undertakings, particularly that of Paul Muni. This film is certainly well worth seeing and I encourage all of you to do so. One thing I should point out is that I purchased the VHS Hollywood Classics Collector's Edition put out by the Madacy Music Group of Quebec and my copy arrived damaged. This may very well have occurred during shipping and may not reflect on the distributor at all. I am also confident that, had I chosen to, I could have returned it and gotten another copy without a problem. However, I chose to repair it myself, which I was able to do but it did involve taking the tape apart and reassembling it. I don't know who was at fault but the bottom line is that my copy was damaged and you have the right to know that. As far as the film itself though; its a classic that absolutely does not disappoint. I urge you to give it a look.",1015286400,6,1240,4.349137931034483
679257,4,6303562337,"I have always been a fan of Claude Rains and in this movie, I find him to be an utterly delightful and humorous devil. If the devil can be humorous  or delightful. An entertaining dark comedy, Paul Muni is a murdered  gangster sent back to earth by ""Nick"" (Claude Rains), to  impersonate a well respected judge. What follows are many hilarious twists  and turns as Muni attempts to discredit the Judge's good name. This movie  proves once and for all, the devil can be outsmarted.",963532800,7,480,4.6

679432,4,6303562337,"Situated well within the tradition of Forties supernatural comedies such as HERE COMES MR. JORDAN (1941) and BLITHE SPIRIT (1945), ANGEL ON MY SHOULDER - penned by Harry Segall, who also wrote MR. JORDAN - centers on Eddie (Paul Muni) a gangster shot to death by his presumed best friend and sent to Hell as a result. There he encounters the Devil (Claude Rains), also known as Nick; and the Devil offers a bargain whereby Eddie can return to Earth, so long as he inhabits the body of Judge Frederick Parker, one of Nick's deadliest enemies, and thereby contribute to Parker's demise. Eddie readily agrees, as it provides a chance for him to get revenge on his killer (Hardie Allbright) at the same time.

The story proceeds in a series of comic misadventures, all carefully planned by Nick, but which go catastrophically wrong in their execution. As Judge Parker, Eddie gets involved in a fist-fight that enhances rather than destroys the judge's reputation; later on, he is about to take a bribe for a case when he discovers that the defendant is one of his ex-girlfriends (Marion Martin), prompting Eddie/ Judge Parker to send her to jail where she belongs.

The script is full of sharp witticisms, especially for Rains; not normally associated with comedies, he is given the opportunity to indulge in a range of facial expressions as he discovers that the Devil no longer possesses the power he once thought he had. Muni gets the chance to parody his famous tough-guy role in I AM A FUGITIVE FROM A CHAIN GANG (1932), with his rangy walk, head bent forward and his arms perpetually down by side, he looks like the typical heavy devoid of intelligence but with plenty of strength. He makes some delicious mispronunciations of the words ""Mephistopheles"" and ""Beelzebub.""

In truth the film's message is a profoundly conservative one; follow the ways of God and you will be protected from corruption. Eddie learns this precept as the action unfolds, which inspires him to turn against Nick and make decisions for himself. Yet there remains something peculiarly attractive about Hell, even if it is only the wonderfully Gothic sets with smoke arising from them (by Bernard Herzbrun), through which Eddie wanders before encountering Nick.",1468195200,,2237,4.928381962864721

In this remake it's a Politian & not a judge. The Devil is very believable in the remake. Plus the story is good also.

I encourage you to watch it & download From Youtube.com. Why? Because it's not available for resale as a digital download nor on DVD.

I also recommend watching Meet ""Joe Black"" Starring Anthony Hopkins & Brad Pitt along with ""Heaven Can Wait"" Starring Warren Beatty etc.

679633,4,6303562337,"One of satans' employee's - a mobster who was shot and killed and went straight to Hell, had a demonic curse and plan placed upon his tormented soul, by satan himself. That being: To tarnish a good Judges' reputation and ensure that this particular moral, ethical and upstanding Judge, would have his reputation ruined to the point that his chances for running for Governor - let alone being elected for that office, would be utterly ruined. Why? Because he was a decent man and an impartial Judge (who could not be swayed by lobbyists and their material and financial perks), who would make a great Governor. So, what's the curse and the demonic deal? That the mobster would get out of Hell to do the dirty deed because he resembles the good Judge. Then..., once the job was done, back to Hell, he goes. Meaning: He gets out of Hell..., at least for a short time as in, relief for his tormented soul. Actor Paul Muni stars in a dual role as the mobster and the Judge and Claude Rains, portrays the conniving, evil and wicked satan. And a young Anne Baxter, is the fair and impartial Judges' fiancee. This single, DVD-disc that was filmed in black and white, runs approximately 90-minutes in length. It is a vivid reminder of the fact that there really is a Hell, that is run by a very real devil, whose name is satan. This film gives it's audience something to look at entertainment wise, as well as, something to think about. Namely: The breaking of spiritual and secular law and it's ramifications. An interesting movie which emphasizes the fact that, crime of any kind does not pay, in this lifetime or the next. Nina Kish",1439164800,,1626,4.571917808219178

679641,5,6303562337,"""Angel On MY Shoulder"" is a very enjoyable, well-crafted morality tale.  The theme is focused on how a cheap hood gains some sense of integrity and honor after death.  Paul Muni, who reprises his Scarface characterization, is the classic hood who is constantly looking for ways to use and beat the system; a system that he considers to be even more corrupt than he is.  When he is rubbed out by his gangster best friend, he is hurled into the darkest part of hell.  To get out of that raging pit, he must make a deal with the devil, who is played with charming maleficence by Claude Reins.  The two of them return to Earth to eliminate a completely honest judge, who just happens to look exactly like the gangster.  Their experiences in the world of the living create some interesting insights into the nature of crime and punishment.  The ending of the film shows Muni and Reins walking back into the inferno.  However, they have now created a bond that is reminiscent of the ending of ""Casablanca.""  It is obvious that devil and the hood are experiencing the beginning of a beautiful friendship.",1372118400,,1097,4.61340206185567

This is the movie I think of when Paul Muni's name gets dusted off. It's his most fun picture. It's a marvelous fantasy in the same vein as&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Devil-Daniel-Webster-The-Criterion-Collection/dp/B0000AKY54/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Devil & Daniel Webster (The Criterion Collection)</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Here-Comes-Mr-Jordan/dp/B000KX0IOU/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Here Comes Mr. Jordan</a>.

Surly St. Louis gangster Eddie Kagle (Muni) has just served four years in penitentiary and now he's out. But on the same day of his release, he gets plugged by his own pal, Smiley, and with his own gun. Suddenly Eddie finds himself wandering in a nightmarish place that smells like rotten eggs. He runs into a sly fellow (Claude Rains) named ""Nick"" whom he thinks is a smooth-talking con man... and he's not wrong. For Nick will pull a fast one if you're not alert. Nick makes a deal with Eddie: He'll break him out of this joint if he agrees to impersonate someone out there. Eddie Kagle happens to be the spitting image of a crusading judge what's been getting under the skin of the Prince of Evil. And now this judge is running for governor, where his benevolent influence could only expand. It's time to launch a diabolical smear campaign.

Back on Earth Eddie's soul slips into the judge's comatose body, and, oh, now see how the judge's demeanor has altered, gone from sober dignity to aggressive c0ck of the walk. Anne Baxter is fantastic as the judge's secretary and fiancee Barbara Foster who grows very concerned at the judge's radical behavior. Due to the judge's recent illness, the doctor advises Barbara to play along, to go along with this odd behavior. I guess it's hard to put faith in a judge what's got his hat set on a jaunty angle. And who now surveys the world with skepticism and hostility.

And maybe goodness rubs off. ""Nick,"" ever at Eddie's side - although no one else can see him - and constantly whispering in his ear, can't help but notice that each effort to sling mud at his judgeship fails stupendously. He begins to question Eddie's motivation. Has the judge's innate goodness begun to thwart this hardened thug's baser instincts? Or perhaps it's the love of a good woman? Or maybe it's Eddie's resistance to being played for a mug? Eddie's no good at taking orders, see? And maybe you, too, will pump a fist in the air when a fed-up Eddie finally confronts Nick: ""Stop whispering in my ear, Devil!""

This is Claude Rains at his most playful. He's electric as the Devil, and generous with those mischievous smiles and those sly glances directed skyward at You Know Who. He steals plenty of scenes from Muni, but that's something you'd expect of Beelzebub. When he espies something that momentary gives him pause, he blurts out: ""What in my domain is that?"" Heh.

Paul Muni, as well, seems to delight in his send-up of a tough guy role. What's not to love about playing an out of sorts ghost in the shell? And how cool is it when the possessed judge unexpectedly applies jujitsu on a bunch of rabblerousers? I tell you, stuff like&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/I-Am-a-Fugitive-From-a-Chain-Gang/dp/B0007TKNJ2/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">I Am a Fugitive From a Chain Gang</a>&nbsp;or THE STORY OF LOUIS PASTEUR or&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Life-of-Emile-Zola-Special-Edition/dp/B0006HBV3W/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Life of Emile Zola (Special Edition)</a>&nbsp;may be more ambitious works, but I don't ever look for those pictures when I'm looking for a fun time at the movies.

But if Eddie is willing to make a deal, Nick (Claude Rains), one of the trustees, will see that he gets to St Louis. Smiley, that double-crossing rat, is in St. Louis living it up on Eddie's money.
To get to Smiley, all Eddie has to do is masquerade as a respected judge long enough to stop his campaign for law and order. Not an easy task because the judge has been playing ball with a lot of nice kids.

The VCI disc has a Leon Errol short which is also available on VCI's currently OOP Leon Errol comedy set.  I'm going with the VCI disc because I already have Underground, and the VCI disc has a nicer cover.  Even though the Roan disc lists the running time as 90 min., a side-by-side comparison shows it to be 100/101 min. as is the VCI disc.  The film's running time matches the original running time, although I'm a little suspicious of the scene following the one in the judge's chamber.  It starts in the middle of a word and looks like there could be a few seconds missing.  But every print I've ever seen is the same as this.",1234742400,14,871,4.433962264150943
679810,4,6303562337,"I really enjoyed this Paul Muni gives an over the top performance & Claude Rains makes a very astute Devil, who uses Paul Muni to begin a reign of terror in the USA. Paul(character is Eddie) is shot by a backstabbing criminal named Smiley and sent to hell. Eddie is brought back from hell to do the Devils work & to get revenge on Smiley. The scenes in hell were fantastic. Eddie's soul which is a gangster/criminal goes into someone who looks like him (a judge running for Governor). Anne Baxter slowly brings out the good in Eddie, to stop the evil plans. Anne Baxter is supposed to marry the judge. This had some good horror/fantasy mixed in with crime and really liked it overall. The VCI DVD print is good-very good. Full frame transfer..",1234656000,3,743,4.511111111111111
679811,4,6303562337,"It's the film everyone remembers from those Saturday afternoon TV film matinees. The producer, Charles R. Rogers, had a pretty bleak record when it came to producing films on his own (he was once a V.P. at Universal before going solo). But with ""Angel"" he knocked it out of the park. He inserted age-old movie favorties and combined them into one story. Gangsters, fights, comedy, drama, fantasy... what's not to love?

""Angel on My Shoulder"" (1946) offers up classic performances by such legendary stars as Paul Muni, Anne Baxter, and Claude Rains. All cast to type, they give performances that are timeless. When you think of any of these stars, think of them in this film and it will give you a pretty good idea as to what each was known for.",1227139200,,745,4.643939393939394

679885,5,6303562337,"Paul Muni, Ann Baxter and Claude Rains. This excellent cast and great story deserve a better quality DVD. There are some pretty silly movies out there in this supernatural genre ('Beyond Tommorow' with Aubrey Smith comes to mind). These silly movies are a thoughtless mish mash of new age / Biblical/ and everything in between, philosophies: Pure incoherence.

This story, however,  is  brilliant: it has chosen the Bible's perspective on sin,  good and evil, and  sticks with it to the end. Whole passages of the Bible are paraphrased or implied;  flawlessly and without seeming at all preachy. Here is Nick (Claude Rains as Beelzabub) addressing G-D regarding Eddie Kagel ( The ex-convict and main character):

""Must I run afoul of you again? Am I doomed forever to be vanquished? What is this subhuman creature, incubated in the recesses of foulness, done to become your favorite?
It was with evil intent that he ventured forth! He voluntered to do my bidding..."" (compare with Revelation 12:10; ""the Accuser"").

There are no stupid lines in this movie. Whoever, wrote it, must have been a student of the Bible. It is an intelligent production and highly entertaining. And one does not need to be of any religion at all to appreciate it.",1201910400,2,1240,4.927884615384615

679890,4,6303562337,"This movie, first released in 1946, is a good piece of entertainment.  The story ... a hardened criminal suffering in hell is brought back to earth and goes through an Ebineezer Scrooge type transformation ... is brought to life very well by the extraordinary acting talents of Paul Muni and Claude Rains.

The script also is excellent ... giving these two performers plenty of good lines to mold and shape to their liking.

The supporting cast is OK.  Anne Baxter as the fiancee is OK.  George Cleveland as the man-servant is also OK.  But ... they are minor leaguers to the major league talents of Mr. Muni and Mr. Rains.  And, when neither of these two gentlemen are on the screen, there is a definate lull or emptiness in the action.

Claud Rains is better here than he was in Casablanca (where his performance was sort-of choppy) and he is an excellent Satan ... very nefarious and, um, unctuous.  Paul Muni is the better talent here, however.  He is always working ... using subtle little gestures when he's not talking ... always moving, always adding a little something to the character ... and the result is a complete, very believable gangster who has a change of heart.

If you were, raised Catholic then you will recognize the title as you have a devil on one shoulder and an angle on the other and you are struggling in the middle.

There is great interaction between Paul Muni and Claude Rains. This move takes unexpected twists and turns. I may remind you a little of ""The Devil and Daniel Webster ""(1941). However, no one can play ""Nick"" as well as Claude Rains.

 I rather like the way they return to the surface. I never trusted those types of elevators. Before you write off Anne Baxter as just another personality in this film, remember that she was also Nefretiri in ""The Ten Commandments"" (1956)",1511740800,,878,4.608974358974359

Richard Kiley is the 1980s version played an evil version which was too obviously evil, but Raines understood what the devil would act like. Excellent movie all the way.
