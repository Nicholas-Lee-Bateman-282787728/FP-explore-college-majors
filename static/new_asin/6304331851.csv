841931,4,6304331851,"Now...i'm not going to say that this movie is Oscar worthy or anything of the sort...it isn't.  But what it is is wonderfully enjoyable and fun to watch.  The music is absolutely wonderful (""If ever I would leave  you"" is beautiful) and the sets and costumes are great.  True, this is  not exactly in the class with all the other Oscar winners...but its good  fun, and the story is classic...what more could you ask for?",947980800,4,420,4.533333333333333
841932,5,6304331851,"For those of you looking to explore the range of human emotion in a simpler time, this movie will not disappoint you. The film has everything; romance,love,lust,betrayal,murder,greed, and a cast of the most concincing  actors.  Richard Harris is a most splendid King Arthur, portraying a  gentle, strong, and wise man.  Vanessa Redgrave gives Queen Gweniviere a  playful, even lovable nature despite the destruction she brings to the  Court.  Franco Nero is the male perfected.  His Sir Lancelot has been  lusted after by many women over the years, due no doubt to his dashing good  looks and incredibly intoxicating french accent.  I first saw this film in  1968 at a theatre in Houston, Texas and was hooked immediately. The music  alone will stir your soul and cause you to reflect on your own past loves.  Many are the days in which you will find yourself mindlessly humming one or  more of the provocative songs from this picture. This is one of the finest  examples of musical moviemaking in the history of film.  I truly hope that  you enjoy it as much as I have over the years.",946771200,11,1085,4.741935483870968
841933,3,6304331851,"I prefer fiction. I wanted something to do with the sword. I mean come on, were talking about excalibur here! The greatest sword there ever was. I prefer either a mystical movie such as Legend, or an action movie like  DieHard. That's what I thought about it anyway.",925171200,,266,4.541666666666667
841934,3,6304331851,"As with CAROUSEL, not many people liked the film version of CAMELOT.  There were some superb actors in the cast, but only competent acting.  The singing - in a ""natural"" style - toned down the grand tragedy  aspect and as much confused audiences as alienated them.  On initial  viewing, the story and the songs are moving and impressive, but this is not  a film that stands up to repeated viewings.  The sets and costumes are  singularly stunning - a combination of primitive and an emerging gold and  jewel-encrusted aristocracy on the rise.  The wide-screen version is the  definitive one to own in that at least the grandeur of the spectacle and  sweep of the action fill the eyes and ears when the dramatic content of a  scene lets us down.  Harris and Redgrave are quite fine. Nero can neither  act nor sing but is a pretty Lancelot.  Hemmings makes the most of his  brief role as the destructive Mordred.  This was Alfred Newman/Ken Darby's  last scoring job for films and it won him his last Oscar.  Also Oscared for  Art Direction and Costumes.  Additional nom for Cinematography.  Worth  seeing and even owning - but not one of the great film adaptations of a  stage classic.",921542400,7,1184,4.658536585365853
842243,5,6304331851,"A film in its own category of superb. Not sure what year this was made but I was a teen then and love it as much now as I did then. Songs, sets, costumes, story, acting are all beyond fantastic. Vanessa Redgrave is a vision. Richard Burton is more heart-warming than you've ever seen him; his poetry/song renderings just classic English style of theater at its best. I guess it depends on what you like, but if you've never seen this, am highly recommending it.",1523059200,,461,4.435294117647059

I am looking forward to seeing Richard Harris, Vanessa Redgrave and Franco Nero. Their voices are wonderful.  The acting is very skilled and let us face it Franco Nero's eyes are the bluest and his voice - wow. I think it rivals Richard Burton and Julie Andrews.

842597,5,6304331851,"I saw the original Broadway production of 'Camelot' when I was a child (Richard Burton, Julie Andrews, and Robert Goulet) and loved it. When the film came out, I saw it and didn't warm to it. (Spoiler alert) I think one reason for my reaction was simply that the 1960 play was far more chaste (regarding the infidelity storyline) and this suited me as a ten or eleven-year-old and so perhaps the storyline got stuck in my memory that way. But now, having just watched the film version after many years, I have to say the film has aged beautifully and I much prefer it. It has humor, sorrow, extremely memorable songs and the costumes are wonderful--especially in the scene in which Lancelot is to be knighted. Much 'communication' between the three principals is done with the eyes. This makes the complex love triangle utterly believable. Because all three of the main characters truly love each other as people, the story rises high above the adultery theme--and soars with emotion. It has a number of good messages in it. (If you're feeling sad, 'learn something' says Merlin).

If they ever do a remake, I have one wish: please acknowledge that Lancelot du Lac was raised by none other than the Lady of the Lake (who had *much* to do with the sword Excalibur), that, depending on whose account you read, Mordred *possibly* had a faery queen for a mother in Morgan Le Fay, and Merlin, well Merlin is Merlin. I'm not suggesting a 'Mists of Avalon' treatment here, but a small, well-rounded subplot of something a little fae wouldn't go amiss. A fun bit of gossip: the actors Vanessa Redgrave and Franco Nero met on the 'Camelot' film set and *many* years later married (2006). They are still married today.",1500076800,8,1708,4.693333333333333

I did buy another dvd and got the same problem, so knew it wasn't the dvd, but my computer.  I hooked my dvd player up and the movie played just fine.  I bought another dvd after reading reviews instead of changing players, as others said they tried multiple devises with the same problem.  I then went to the Internet to search for the problem and found a setting that made the movie work on my computer.

I changed the rating and have an update for people who have my problem with this video.  It wasn't the video, but settings on my computer.  I put the dvd on play and right clicked the screen.

844445,4,6304331851,"The knock on ""Camelot"" when it first came out in 1967, and even today, is that it's overblown.  It's too long, too busy, too opulent, too fussy, too gaudy, too sprawling, too unfocused, and too slow.  Well, it is too long.  But as for the rest, I can only say I disagree.  This is a grand Lerner and Loewe (""My Fair Lady"") musical presented in a grand fashion.  Sure, it gets long-winded, but you can't blame director Joshua Logan (""Mister Roberts,"" Sayonara,"" ""South Pacific,"" ""Paint Your Wagon"") for trying to duplicate the splendor of the original Broadway production, which, if you ever saw it, was pretty darned splendid, indeed.  Be that as it may, this forty-fifth anniversary Blu-ray Book edition offers viewers a chance to skip any parts of the film they don't like and enjoy the parts they do, which can be many and enjoyable.  One's viewing and listening experience can be a full, three-hour music-fest or a brief stint with favorite songs.  Technology is wonderful.

Alan J. Lerner based the plot of ""Camelot"" on T.H. White's Arthurian novel ""The Once and Future King,"" 1958, which White based in turn on parts of Sir Thomas Malory's ""Le Morte D'Arthur,"" 1485, which Malory based on numerous French, German, and English versions of the Arthur legends written hundreds of years before he got to them.  So, yes, ""Camelot"" has a history.

The story recounts, largely in song, the familiar love triangle of King Arthur, Queen Guenevere, and Sir Lancelot.  My own major concern with the story, though, has nothing to do with its length or its lack of focus but with its actors.  At the time, it greatly disappointed me that the original Broadway cast had not reprised their roles in the film.  Richard Harris plays Arthur, and he seems to grow in the role as the movie progresses.  But he is no more than an acceptable if somewhat grudging substitute for Richard Burton, who declined to do the movie.  Vanessa Redgrave plays Guenevere, and she is really quite stunning, the best part of the picture.  Yet Julie Andrews would have done her own singing, and the songs are mainly what the film is about.  Ms. Andrews, too, declined to reprise her role.  And a really major letdown is Franco Nero as Lancelot.  He is simply no Robert Goulet, in stature, voice, or dramatic ability, a criticism supported by the fact that as an actor Nero disappeared into the woodwork of second-rate films as soon as he finished ""Camelot.""

Nevertheless, the cast do their best, with David Hemmings a deliciously slimy Mordred and Lionel Jeffries a delightfully dotty old King Pellinore.  Laurence Naismith as Merlyn looks good but is otherwise forgettable.  The sets are lavish, the art direction, costumes, and music won Academy Awards; and, needless to say, the songs are still the songs, among them ""I Wonder What the King is Doing Tonight,"" ""The Simple Joys of Maidenhood,"" ""C'est Moi,"" ""The Lusty Month of May,"" ""How to Handle a Woman,"" ""If Ever I Should Leave You,"" ""I Loved You Once in Silence,"" and, of course, the title tune, ""Camelot.""  They are as beautiful as ever.

Trivia notes, thanks to John Eastman in ""Retakes"" (Ballantine Books, New York, 1989):  ""Count how many times you see the color red in this Arthurian musical.  Josh Logan wanted the pageantry to look unlike any Hollywood medieval epic ever filmed so he tried not to use the scarlet cloth so typical of most.  Since there was no need for historical accuracy in portraying a legendary kingdom, he gave designer John Truscott free rein in creating a variety of strange objects, costumes, and settings.  Costumes, not including 361 suits of armor, numbered some 3,500, each given a hand-loomed appearance and home-dyed color.  The rainy-green color of the acreage surrounding Camelot (actually Coca Castle) was accomplished by spraying watercolor paint on a brown summer landscape; and the English fog was achieved by giant wind machines blowing clouds of chemical mist over the scenery.  Logan filmed key prologue and epilogue scenes in Spain.  Joyous Gard, the castle of Sir Lancelot, was actually the famed Alcazar in Segovia.  At the other end of the world, Camelot's dense forest stood on Stage 8 of Warner Bros.-Seven Arts Studios, draped in ten tons of artificial snow.  Genuine romance blossomed between Redgrave and Nero, who met on the set and thereafter lived together and produced a child.  Tom and Sue Logan, the director's children, played the farm boy and goose girl in the first scene of the movie filmed.""

Video:
Warner Bros. have transferred the movie to high-definition Blu-ray in its original 2.40:1 aspect ratio using a dual-layer BD50 and an MPEG-4/AVC codec.  The filmmakers shot it mainly in earth tones, yet the colors still look good, if sometimes in muted shades.  In other words, colors are natural in a realistically subdued sort of way, never bright or showy.  Similar to what we got on the DVD, there are no egregious glitches, fades, or scratches, just a few white flecks here and there.  However, the image is often very soft, and there are occasional scenes in which one cannot help noticing the grain and noise.  While most of the film is reasonably clear, there are some shots of Harris's face, for instance, that seem positively swarming with black specks.  Also, from time to time the picture looks slightly distorted, faintly squished, as though the video engineers had not quite converted the 35 mm anamorphic Panavision frames back to their appropriate dimensions.  Still, the Blu-ray's PQ is an improvement over the DVD, for whatever that's worth; personally, I was a little disappointed.

Audio:
The movie comes with a lossless DTS-HD Master Audio 5.1 track, which provides a wide stereo spread and a little rear-channel ambiance bloom in the musical numbers.  In addition, the tonal balance is quite lifelike, dynamics are fine, and the midrange is smooth and easy on the ear.  There's not much in the way of transient quickness, though, nor bass and treble extension, a normal expectation.

Extras:
For this forty-fifth anniversary edition of ""Camelot,"" Warners have given it the full Blu-ray Book treatment, with more extras than ever.  First up on the disc is an audio commentary by film critic and film historian Stephen Farber, which should please fans of the film and film buffs in general.  Next is a thirty-minute featurette, ""Camelot:  Falling Kingdoms,"" which recounts studio chief Jack L. Warner's attempt to duplicate with the movie the success he enjoyed with ""My Fair Lady.""  After that is the ten-minute featurette ""The Story of Camelot,"" which is a vintage, making-of promo for the film.  And then there's the thirty-minute featurette ""The World Premiere of Camelot,"" which shows us what things were like on the movie's opening night.

The extras conclude with thirty-five scene selections; five different theatrical trailers in aspect ratios varying from 1.33:1 to 1.85:1 to 2.40:1; English as the only spoken language; French and Spanish subtitles; and English captions for the hearing impaired.

Finally, because this is a Blu-ray Book, we get a forty-page hardbound book with color pictures and a load of notes.  To make a good package even better, Warners have also included a bonus CD soundtrack sampler with four songs:  ""I Wonder What the King Is Doing Tonight,"" ""Camelot,"" ""How to Handle a Woman,"" and ""If Ever I Would Leave You.""  The two discs fasten to the inside front and back covers via Digipak clips.

Parting Thoughts:
""Camelot"" has its critics, to be sure, but I am not particularly one of them.  It is an epic musical of heroic dimensions; a sentimental, idealistic piece of romance and adventure, fluff to be sure, but fluff I continue to enjoy.",1433030400,4,7687,4.941588785046729

It's even worse than the 50's remake of Showboat or Minelli's absurd Brigadoon; the single most foolish case of directorial miscasting in Hollywood history.  (The only scene that works is the short scene in the New York lounge before they return to Scotland.)  In case no one noticed, HARDLY A MEMBER OF THIS CAST CAN SING THEIR ROLES PROPERLY.  Harris sounds as if he's gargling Dutch cleanser; his horse could sing the role better.  Burton sounds like an operatic baritone by comparison.  Redgrave's attempt at ""singing"" must be meant as some sort of grim joke.  The original keys are transposed so low and the tempos slowed to such a crawl to a point where they lose all their color and charm.  The spirit has been completely sapped from The Lusty Month of May number.  Oh yes, nearly third of the musical numbers are cut.  A disgustingly pathetic non-effort.

The charm and magic of the original Broadway show, which I saw, which included singers who could really sing, right out the window. Vanessa Redgrave takes all the wit and bite out of the songs, and Richard Harris, wearing more eye shadow than his horse, turns Arthur into a total wimp. If as many people on this site had adored it when it was first released, it would have been a box office smash. As it was it was a box office bomb. It's right up there with 'Star!', 'Dr Doolittle,' 'Finian's Rainbow and 'Lost Horizon' as yet another monumental musical turkey. The sad thing is that the music is wonderful. Pity half the songs were dropped and nobody could sing. This film lost all the profits Warner Bros made from 'My Fair Lady.' It a terrible movie.

845587,4,6304331851,"Just because it is on blu-ray doen't mean it has improved the original insipid production. There's really not much depth to the simplistic script with each event parading across the screen as a disingenuous pageant not fully relating to itself as a whole. Of course the music is marvelous in a non-musical sort of way. I believe it was the first film to try and be more realistic with non-musical actors ""singing"" the  leads. Harris and Redgrave do their own singing---Franco does not. (Too bad because Lancelot's song was the only ballad that stands alone without the rest of the show.) Sets are grand, misty and have unnatural light sources much like a Kinkade painting. Of course the bulk of it is filmed in a studio and photographed with impressionistic techniques. Lots of blurred photography and unnatural too close close-ups. Eyes and noses are often too dewy for their own good (at such close range).",1404432000,3,908,4.858064516129033

845859,4,6304331851,"Warner Brothers/Seven Arts 1967 film production of Camelot is a good deal like the story it tells; it is lofty, inspiring, grand, fun, and sadly like its characters, it is flawed.  But that is not to say that it should not be recommended, oh it should, indeed don't let it be forgot.  The production is sumptuous, the acting is generally quite good, the music, both songs and Alfred Newmans incidental score (it garnered an Academy Award and a Golden Globe for best adapted score) are excellent, and the action scenes are very well staged.  There is humor, romance, heartbreak, and yes inspiration.  It suffered from some negligent final editing and some poor direction, but overall it is an endearing film.  Nominated for five Academy Awards it won three, and it garnered one very deserved Golden Globe for Richard Harris as best actor in a musical or comedy.
 The flaws come in some rather sloppy, or at least very hurried, directing and editing at times which are still in the surviving versions of the film.  Most of these problems were due to a rushed final schedule when budgets were running out. What is really sad is that many of these gaffes could have, and should have, been corrected with relative ease.  There may be some complaints about some differences, and exclusions, when comparing the film with the stage play, but they are to be expected.  All in all it still presented a suitable final effort for film producer Jack L. Warner, and was hardly a poor effort by director Joshua Logan.
 The casting was initially questioned but actually proved one of the great strengths of the film, and in a move pressed hard by Richard Harris the  principal singing was done live during filming not, as would be the usual practice dubbed in later.  Vanessa Redgrave in place of Julie Andrews as Guenevere actually created a more believable, if not earthy, character and she proved she could sing!  David Hemmings was delicious as Mordred.  And Lionel Jeffries and Laurence Naismith were absolutely perfect for King Pellinore and Merlyn respectively. The weak link, if there must be one, was perhaps young Franco Nero as Lancelot, but not at all bad job, and yes he made the ladies swoon!  And the romance was here also to be believed, Redgrave would be linked in real life to Nero and today is married to the one time Lancelot, a true story-book ending in a great actress life that has had its own tragedies.  But the film belongs to Richard Harris who was King Arthur.  Let us not forget Richard Burton, but Harris put his heart and soul into this performance, and he too could sing.  He took it very seriously from the start, literally finagled the part and made the role his own; story is that at the end of production he walked off with Arthurs crown.  It is a pity that no one thought to do T.H. Whites Book of Merlyn with an elder Harris as the aged Arthur or even, given his performance as Dumbledore, as Merlyn, and even his portrayal of the old philosopher-emperor Marcus Aurelius in Gladiator (2000) did much to bring this to mind.  While a great actor, and an uproarious individual, Harris never quite duplicated this level of acting, this was the role he was surely born to play.  The film made apt and in cases beautiful use of montages before it became a common devise to save time and still relate events, and it delivered numerous iconic images and moments:  the entrance of Guenevere, the marriage of Guenevere and Arthur, the massive court hall, the Round Table, the knighting of Lancelot, Arthur soliloquy, Merlyns mentoring of young Wart, Arthurs final victory and farewell, runnnnn boy!
 The production was simply lavish, though some saw it as cheap somehow, and it put some rather original twists to a semi-medieval setting including costumes, arms and armor giving unbelievable attention to detail.  This too garnered an Academy Award for John Truscott, actually Truscott won two awards, one for art and set decoration, and another for costume design.  The other two nominations were for sound, and cinematography.  It all gave this Camelot the true feel of a place with one foot in reality and the other in an imaginary world.  And while several songs did not make the translation from play to film, most of them did with some variations, and Frederick Loewes original music became something wondrous with the direction and conduction of the great Alfred Newman.  Newman was in the latter part of a great career to which he added an exclamation point with his usual directorial skill, and especially with what amounted to a new additional score as incidental music that is almost legendary today particularly in Lancelots escape, and the tour de force in Gueneveres rescue.  Newman was given an Academy Award for best adapted score, and it too was so well deserved.  The film has never been particularly well received with critics, for various reasons, but has remained popular and actually did well enough at the box office; the late Roger Ebert gave the film thumbs up and five stars but his review was somewhat grumpy.  Some of the production problems became the stuff of Hollywood stories.  The film went over budget was hurried at the end, and it came at an inopportune time. With the war in Vietnam we were more in tune with the stark realism of Bonnie and Clyde, or the satire and cynicism of Planet of the Apes or M*A*S*H than the pink glow of castle Camelot.  A musical about fantasy and mythical idealism seemed a bit out of tune; ironically T.H. Whites entire approach to King Arthur in The Once and Future King, from which the film and play flowed, was fiercely anti-war which the studio failed to fully realize. Unlike a large number of musicals from the 1960s and 1970s Camelot has aged well, and finally is available in Blu-ray and once again it sparkles.  There are also stories that some unused footage for scenes cut from the early production, in particular an adventurous quest by Lancelot, is out there somewhere but likely is lost.  Some footage is seen in the extended trailers and one wonders, could it be restored?",1394582400,11,6065,4.754770992366412

The Bluray transfer is pretty decent - both video and audio.  In 1982, HBO did a recording of a stage production of Camelot which was much better than this movie version - ironically using Richard Harris as King Arthur again - but he was much better in this stage production.

846254,2,6304331851,"I really wanted to love this movie.  I was warned that I'd hate it, since most people do, but I was convinced I'd like it.  The story of `Camelot' is one that is strong and exciting, and the idea of casting Vanessa Redgrave in her prime alongside the manly Richard Harris was almost like dream casting.

Add to that the fact that this was a musical, and you have me really excited.

Sadly, the source of my true excitement wound up being the thorn in my side by the time the film was through.  For a story that is so exhilarating and charming and thrilling, `Camelot' feels like a halfhearted joke and really fails to capitalize on any of its real assets.  Redgrave is given some of the worst songs I've heard uttered in a musical that wasn't aimed at teenagers, and Richard Harris suffers with a character that should have been more than he was.  The handling of King Arthur is so, underwhelming.  Franco Nero is decent as Lancelot, but this film is clearly uninterested with him outside of his charming good looks and so he winds up being an empty vessel.

My biggest qualm with this film is the musicality of it all.  This is a dark and serious story that needed edge to be something great.  It needed a heavier hand, treatment like that of `Sweeney Todd' in order to carry the weight of what we know of this tale.  Instead, the lightness and airiness of it all make the film feel like a spoof; like and intentional comedy that just isn't very funny.

The sets, costumes and the like are astounding, and that cinematography is just phenomenal, but outside of those technical merits this was a giant waste of time.  I can't even really say that it was entertaining because it missed so many marks.",1379635200,2,1699,4.456310679611651

I didn't worry about that but I soon began to worry as I realized that people's lips were moving but I wasn't hearing any words. I did hear the music so I knew my sound system was working. I tried fast forwarding but just saw more of the same. I finally got smart and hit ""menu"" on the remote control. There was, in fact, a menu! I went to settings and found that the default was to play the music tracks only with no voice! I can see where that might be a nice option if you just want some sound in the background but I suspect more people buy it to watch the movie! Seems like an awfully odd choice for a default. I don't know if this was peculiar to my particular model of player or if it is like that on all the DVD's. Certainly I've never seen a disk act like that before. Anyway, if it happens to you, now you know not to panic and to just go change the audio setting. Enjoy!

Oh yeah, another comment. I found the very end of the movie when Arthur says, ""Some do sparkle"" to be remarkably similar to the Camelot legend episode of Babylon 5 (""A Late Delivery From Avalon"" Season 3, episode 13) where ""Arthur"" says, ""The numbers do add up"". I have to wonder if the author, J Michael Straczynski, was influenced by the movie and if it was conscious or not. I'll probably never know.",1376524800,,1454,4.137809187279152

846316,5,6304331851,"Beautiful love story of a feminine lady who becomes her husband-kings confidante.  Tragedy strikes when King Arthur's spoils of war and battle training avert his heart from his first love.  Lady Genevieve, lonely and a bit too sensitive to a younger knight- Sir Lancelot, betrays her heart to another and King Arthur is eternally wounded in his soul.

If you like period films and musicals, then you'll enjoy this film.  What I appreciate most about the film making is that the musical overtures, songs and scores do not overwhelm the story plot.  The backdrops are beautiful and authentic looking.  Richard Harris and Vanessa Redgrave a wonderful to behold as an onscreen couple.",1376006400,,680,5.026785714285714

The first song Ms Redgrave sings sounds as if it were written for a teenage girl.  Redgrave was 30 at the time.

The only person I could even remotely care about was Arthur.  I think I really like Richard Harris.  None of the other characters were likable or sufficiently fleshed out for me to want to know them or know more about them.

846374,2,6304331851,"Camelot is on my short list of all-time favorite musicals. I grew up listening to the OBC recording, and had most of it memorized by the time I was 12. I was so excited when I had an opportunity to see the movie in the early 70s. I was so HORRIBLY disappointed when I left the theater.

Richard Burton is one of the greatest actors of the 20th century, and his performance on the OBC recording of Camelot is brilliant. Richard Harris' grotesque over-acting turns Arthur into a broad characiture, and his singing voice is barely able to do the songs justice. Julie Andrews in the OBC - what can I say, one of the finest voices the Broadway stage has seen. Vanessa Redgrave - really? She's too old for the part, and I'm not sure which is worse - her non-acting or abysmal attempts at singing. I can't come up with creative adjectives to describe Franco Nero's Lancelot so I'll keep it simple. Bad. The REALLY sad thing is that all three of the original actors would probably have been available to do the movie, but Logan, for some reason, decided to cast all non-singers in a musical. Clever man.

As if the casting weren't bad enough, the butchering of the score/book is unforgivable. Before I Gaze at You Again, The Seven Deadly Virtues, Fie on Goodness, The Joust, and The Persuasion (the last two not on the OBC album) are all completely cut. Follow Me has been cut as a song for Nimue and been turned into background music for a (really bad) scene in ""Act II"" that was written for the film. Additionally, the original overture - perhaps one of the best written for the Broadway stage - has been replace with a soppy, over-orchestrated offering.

I gave this movie a second star because it IS very pretty to watch; the sets and costumes are well done, and the jousting scenes are well staged. But these do not make up for bad singing, bad acting, bad screenplay, and bad directing.

If you can find a copy of the live recording of the 1982 Broadway revival filmed at the Wintergarden Theater, I definately recommend it over this. You still have to deal with Harris' pretentious over-acting (and more make up than Rue Paul uses), and accept Fie on Goodness being cut (along with the whole Morgan Le Fey forest scene), but the other leads are all quite good, and on the whole, it is an infinately better representation of Camelot than the sorry motion picture.",1373587200,6,2361,4.522248243559719
846375,5,6304331851,"This movie has always ranked in the top five of my favorites. The love triangle, myth, legend, and history, all blend together to make a marvelous viewing experience. Many of the songs are timeless and the acting is top notch. I consider it the best performance ever for Richard Harris and I have seen most of his films. Supporting cast is on the mark. Some say the director's close up shots are overdone, but I think they do well to convey the true emotions and heartbreak of King Arthur, who spends much of the film in anquish over the love affair of Guenivere and Lancelot.

It is hard to believe that Franco Nero spoke no English when he did this part, but that is one of the many bits of information you find in the extras.  The second dvd has so much that you will want to watch.  I remember when the movie started a trend in fashion and this too is touched upon in the extras.

846949,2,6304331851,"Bottom line: You could really like this production if it is the one and only version you see. It's hard to ruin the Lerner and Loewe music and ""Camelot"" story completely

But if you loved the Broadway version and the original score (as I did), you will find this movie lacking in many ways.

For starters, the wonderful vocal performances of Julie Andrews, Richard Burton and Robert Goulet far outshine their movie counterparts, who often struggle mightily to meet the music's requirements.

Then there are a number of inexplicable musical choices: a bland new overture (the original is a beautiful classic); a rearranged and bland """"The Simple Joys of Maidenhood""; an altered and repositioned ""Follow Me"" (leaving a huge plot hole; the lovely original explains Merlin's absence for the bulk of the story); elimination of the wonderful ""Before I Gaze At You Again""; elimination of vital musical plot movers ""The Seven Deadly Virtues"" and ""Fie On Goodness"" (again creating plot holes).

So, if you are a fan of the original but open minded enough to enjoy this movie director's different take on it (he reportedly did not like Julie Andrews or Richard Burton in their roles; go figure), then give it a try.",1354406400,3,1205,4.921182266009852

We just didn't like the director's constant cutting, extreme close ups and extraneous camera movement that didn't seem to add anything.  We also found it hard to emotionally engage with the characters.  We love musicals, we love the music for Camelot we just did not care for this movie.",1352678400,,560,4.673469387755102
846953,4,6304331851,"Haven't seen this in years, and great fun to see this absolutely beautiful version on Blu-Ray.  Also included was documentary footage of the premiere of the film, very interesting time capsule of days gone by.

This was first a wonderful Broadway show with Richard Burton as the King, introducing Robert Goulet, perfectly cast as Lancelot, and a young and impossibly talented Julie Andrews in the female lead.  For the movie musical -- Jack Warner's last hurrah with movie musicals -- Richard Harris as the king -- terrific -- Franco Nero as Lancelot, who was dubbed for singing, perfectly, and Nero was just fine, and a radiant Vanessa Redgrave as Guinevere.  Lionel Jeffries terrific as comic relief, playing King Pellinore, who's been looking for his own kingdom for years, which he lost in the woods.

Not a huge hit when released, as movie musicals were fading, and didn't make back all the money lavished on it, but terrific music and lyrics by Lerner & Lowe, who had earlier had a huge hit with the movie musical version of My Fair Lady.  Alan J. Lerner also wrote this screenplay.  On Broadway, of course, My Fair Lady also starred the wonderful Julie Andrews.  She later went on to score big with Mary Poppins and Sound of Music on the big screen.

This is another example of the sheer joy of seeing a movie you like, one you haven't seen in theaters since its first release, or never saw in theaters at all, and may have seen from time to time on standard def TVs.  Suddenly you're seeing this with a Blu Ray player on a widescreen, flatscreen, hi-def, and WOW.  Just beautiful, restored, I think, to full length, with an Intermission, and an Entr'acte during Intermission, and then you're ready to enjoy the second half of the film.

Franco Nero reappeared from time to time in Hollywood films, like one of the Die Hard films as the bad guy, but mostly worked in Europe, where he began.  Incredibly, he eventually married Vanessa Redgrave, and the two are still married today.  They met, of course, and fell in love, on the set of this film, which makes the whole thing more interesting, don't you think?

Suspend your disbelief in magic, and whatever else you have to suspend to be drawn into a wonderful, old fashioned movie musical.  Jack Warner spent a fortune on production, and it's all up on the screen, and pays off big time with your hi-def Blu Ray setup.  Certainly a wonderful film to share with children, and, as Hollywood liked to say back in the day, with ""children of all ages.""

P.S.  The son of Richard Harris played (very well) the British partner of what began as the advertising firm ""Sterling Cooper"" on AMC's ""Mad Men.""",1352073600,10,2652,4.652360515021459

However, the storyline of this movie, at least for me was a little too dull and somewhat pointless.  I tried to watch it with an open mind, because I love Richard Harris.  However, I feel Harris was somewhat miscast here.  He is not terribly dynamic or interesting in this movie.  Nor do I particularly care for Vanessa Redgrave in this film.  I think her acting got better as she got older.

I think perhaps that on stage, this was probably an excellent musical, but it did not translate well into a film.  I'm hard-pressed to put my finger on exactly why.  For some reason, the story is not interesting or moving enough to be impressed with.  Some of the script is funny, it is true.  Then, other parts of the script could have been much better.  The movie itself seems to wander about with no real purpose or plot.  Even though I watched it all the way through, it did not hold my interest after the first hour.

Though some of the musical numbers were quite good, the acting on the part of Richard Harris and Vanessa Redgrave was unimpressive. Overall, the film was very labored and there was little to connect one scene to another. If you want a truly excellent rendition of King Arthur and the knights of the round table, get a copy of the 1997 film, First Knight starring Sean Connery, Richard Gere and Julia Ormond. The acting is first rate and the film is filled with action and does not drag along like Camelot does.

Even though Richard Burton and Julie Andrews starred in the original Broadway production, after seeing this I can't imagine anyone better than Richard Harris! He IS King Arthur and he gives a wonderful and very moving performance! He is spot on in conveying his deep love for Guenivere, who's beautifully played by a radiant, Vanessa Redgrave. She gives an almost ""other worldly"" quality to the role. His devotion to her and her genuine affection for him makes her eventual betrayal all the more poignant. Franco Nero is visually perfect as Lancelot and he and Redgrave have a lot of chemistry together. They were really lovers off screen and it shows. In fact after all of these years, the two of them are back together again in real life, so there's a fairy tale aspect to their own lives.
The sets and costumes are terrific and of course the Lerner and Lowe score is one of their best. I don't think that team ever wrote a bad score! A lot of credit also goes to legendary composer, Alfred Newman, for his outstanding arrangements! One of the special features of this DVD is the ability to listen to just the music if you want.

I have always thought the music was great, but what is really more appealing, is the longing to go back to a time when life was more captivating, romantic and something to be longed for.  Then you find that life was no different then than it is now or perhaps the writers just don't realy know how to present it in a more realistic fashion.  This realization leave one a bit sad, but with enough of a longing to go back where life seemesd to be more carefree, and fun.

This was the first musical I had ever seem. I was smitten as youth, and have loved this movie as much today as I did forty five years ago. Richard Harris is brilliant as King Aurthur, Vanessa Redgrave never looked lovelier in any role before or sense. Franco Nero as Lancelot was a perfect selection for this role. I do not care one bit that they dubbed in his singing voice. I takes nothing away from his brilliant portrayal of Lancelot.
This is a movie to be cherished as much today as it was in 1967.

The music, sets, costumes are simply remarkable, as is the late ""RICHARD HARRIS,""
who I saw perform this on stage. That production had more depth for I think
they added speaches for him. And I don't compare ""apples from oranges,""
or ""My Fair Lady,"" which came with a book and ""Camelot,"" which didn't. But it
came from many written books.

ONE COMPLAINT: the first review is in the year 2000. Nothing from the newly
released, repackaged version. Been told the only change is packaging. This
has not been restored. And I've seen no one review the packaged one so I felt
you should know that the ""art"" looks wonderful but you get the same picture
from years before.

But it is being put together on ""BLU RAY."" And perhaps there will be some
remastering and more extras. Many are included in the dvd versions.
And as for Blu Ray I'm disappointed that they are doing what is bein done
with dvds. Less price for a Blu Ray that only includes the picture. No extras.
So why buy? But I love the combo packs for what I dislike about ""Blu Ray"" is that
is should be programmed to play in any dvd player.

They remove the mist where possible, increase the contrast and black content and totally remove the magic from the movie. As a result, Vanessa Redgraves' glowing complexion becomes muddy and solid, Richard Harries' blue eyeshadow looks like two black eyes and the things that look best are the wonderful details of the costumes. This should really be a brochure for the costume design.

Add to that, a tinny 5.1 soundtrack that lacks kick and muster, and you have a dead movie - one that caters to the people who just want to know how sharp their tvs are, not for those who enjoy a good movie. (Surprisingly enough, the isolated music soundtrack was rich and full, but can someone tell me how to turn on both at once?)

847440,5,6304331851,"What may be one of the most unjustly maligned movie musicals ever made, Joshua Logan's sumptuous ""Camelot"" stands a lot better in a world where the genre is effectively dead. It was instantly reviled upon release in 1967. The reality is, however, the film had a wonderful starring performance by Richard Harris, incomparably beautiful scoring by legendary Alfred Newman-- whose lush, dreamy arrangements beat the tar out of Franz Allers' sharp and stuffy orchestrations from the original Broadway version-- and sets and costumes that are far more impressive than anything James Cameron could conjure on a computer. ""Camelot"" has truly fascinating moments all over the place. It has both warmhearted comedy and stark drama. Laurence Naismith (Merlyn) and Lionel Jeffries (Pellinore) are the other standouts of a mostly top-flight cast. As for the actors' performances of the songs: all of the movie versions are more engaging than those of the original cast album. Richard Harris' Arthur is vibrant and human, while Richard Burton was fairly lifeless in his intonations. As Guenevere, Vanessa Redgrave lacks the vocal powers of Julie Andrews, but then I could never believe Andrews in the role. And the Lancelot songs (dubbed by Gene Merlino for Franco Nero) are much better in the film than Robert Goulet's shut-up-and-listen-to-me-sing showboating. And the DVD is terrific: a new-looking widescreen transfer of the film's breathtaking imagery, for instance. The disc also includes some truly fascinating documentaries of the period-- overwhelmingly sad considering the optimism they express for the film's reception-- a whopping five trailers, if you like seeing how classic films were marketed, and a mislabeled ""music-only"" audio track that features some rather distracting sound effects from the movie and should have had the vocal performances, as well. I mean, ""Little Shop of Horrors"" had one like that! Anyway, don't believe all the bad things you read about this ""Camelot."" Expensive? Yes. Overblown?

847528,1,6304331851,"In my humble opinion, this was the movie that started the end of the American movie musical tradition.  It was if Joshua Logan grabbed a rifle and intentionally shot it in head.  What a great shot!  It has taken us decades to recover.  Let's consider the choice of leads.  Richard Harris.  My wife put it succinctly:  ""Is he a man...or a ham?""  The term ""overacting"" may have been invented for his performance.  Now, he can't sing obviously, and neither could Richard Burton but Mr. Burton won a Tony for his performance.  The only award Mr. Harris could win would be a Razzie.  And he wore more makeup than Vanessa.  Yes, let's go to Ms. Redgrave.  As soon as she opened her mouth to ""sing,"" we started to laugh.  Of course, she acts like she's in a ""X""-rated movie, overly flirtatious and not convincing.  Now, no one could compare to Julie Andrews in the original Broadway production but do we have to go for the exact opposite?  And, then Franco Nero.  An Italian who supposedly did not understand English, playing a Frenchman and could not sing.  Minor quibbles, huh?  The audience bust out laughing when they first saw him on the castle ramparts singing ""C'est moi.""  His singing is dubbed but when he speaks, well, that's the end.  No comparison to Robert Goulet.  These were Joshua Logan's three bullets.  His fourth bullet was himself.  Terrible direction.  What is this staring at the camera supposed to do?  It has been said that Warner Brothers management wanted the original Broadway stars but Mr. Logan wanted these three.  Whether due to scheduling conflicts or money concerns, the salary carrots should have been increased (""How do you handle an actor?"") and filming schedules changed.  This was one of the studio's most expensive productions and designed to be a prestige event.  The mere mention of these three actors should have had Mr. Logan booted from the lot.  Now, the costumes and art direction were certainly worthy of their Oscars along with Alfred Newman's fine scoring.  Being an ardent fan of the Arthurian legends, one actually wondered after seeing it if this was an intentional act, to destroy the proud tradition that honored true singing voices in favor of a musical environment of mediocre talents and a tone deaf populace to benefit a growing record industry.",1261785600,5,2296,4.825192802056555

847530,5,6304331851,"Although this is a musical version about the classical legend of King Arthur, his lovable Guenevere and the purest soul the Frenchman Sir Lancelot, the results are outstanding.

Richard Harris is splendid as King Arthur, Franco Nero is ravishing as Sir Lancelot and the alluring beauty of Vanessa Redgrave ignites the screen every time she appears.

So many songs to convey the emotions. I loved I wonder What the King is Doing Tonight which showed how human young King Arthur was.

847647,3,6304331851,"Josh Logan's film of ""Camelot"" does many things well. It evokes both the fantasy elements and the stark medieval atmosphere of the original show, while adding many outdoor scenes that were not possible on the stage. Sets and costumes are stunning, and Logan succeeds brilliantly in recreating a fantasy world that is both romantic and realistic.

The 2 leads are excellent, especially Richard Harris as the noble, flawed Arthur, full of blind optimism and undue reliance on his childhood memories of Merlin. Vanessa Redgrave is both regal and sensual in her portrayal of Guenevere, although her singing voice is rather thin. Franco Nero fares less well; although he certainly looks the part of Lancelot,  his wooden acting and dubbed singing voice severely limit his credibility.

The film does not resolve the inherent problems that the original Broadway show had: a listless Act 2, and a ponderous, increasingly morbid tone throughout. The arrival of Mordred in the second half changes the tone of the film completely, and we find Arthur helpless to defend his beloved Camelot, as he becomes increasingly detached from reality and consumed by his reliance on Merlin's sorcery to help him cope with the destruction of his idealized kingdom. In this regard, Richard Harris is brilliant: his Arthur is both a man and a boy, full of hope and valor, yet unable to comprehend how his ""Jenny"" could betray him and Camelot itself. Although the ending renews Arthur's hope to some extent, the kingdom of Camelot ends up being merely a memory, a wistful sigh in an otherwise harsh, medieval world of war and chaos. This story of 3 people who genuinely love each other, yet are destroyed by their passions, is the very heart of ""Camelot"", and the film succeeds in portraying this tragic element of the story.

Where the film suffers most is in the music. Several songs from the stage version were deleted from the film (although the only really regrettable deletion is the lovely ""Before I Gaze at You Again""), and as previously mentioned, Vanessa Redgrave's singing is rather weak. One wonders why she was not dubbed as Nero was, although she does deserve kudos for taking on such challenging vocal material, especially in the wake of Julie Andrews' stunning work on the original cast album.

Overall then, ""Camelot"" is both a success and a failure; it is effective in portraying a medieval world of fantasy and heartbreak, yet as a musical film it lacks the magic of earlier Lerner and Loewe works, and at 3 hours it leaves the audience wanting both less, and yet more.",1229731200,7,2562,4.907621247113164

847759,5,6304331851,"When Camelot was produced in 1967, I was in the Army.  I first heard the title song when my room mate had it playing on his reel to reel tape player at Two Rock Ranch Station in Petaluma, California and was immediately smitten by the music.  I was discharged from the service in Oakland, California and returned to St. Louis, Missouri via Los Angeles where I was given a tour of the Warner Bros Seven Arts Studios in Burbank.  The throne room set was then in the process of being disassembled and I could tell that the artists who had created the wet rock wall effect which consumed an entire sound stage had been very good at their craft.  I had no idea what the signifigance of that visit was until I returned home to see the film at a local theater.  The music, the sets, the acting, the singing, and the story all come together to create and experience that you remember forever.  Franco Nero and Vanessa Redgrave did, in fact, fall in love during the production and had a son.  I also remember reading that a stunt man had been killed during the filming of the jousting scenes.  I guess I'm still old school for when I was able to buy this film on DVD, I felt that I was cheating the wonderful people who created it.

847885,1,6304331851,"Camelot was a Broadway hit in 1960 and defined the era when John F Kennedy was president.  Its original Broadway cast was the stuff of legend:  Richard Burton as Arthur, Julie Andrews as his queen, Guinevere, and Robert Goulet as the dashing Sir Lancelot.  With a score by Lerner and Loewe it remains a musical treasure that is often revived.

In 1967, Warner Bros released the film version.  The result was one of the most disappointing adaptations of all time, a long, long, long film that is difficult to watch through in one sitting.  Much of the blame for this must be given to director Joshua Logan who made few films and helped botch another screen adaptation of a classic Broadway musical when he made the film version of ""South Pacific.""

The casting of the film was also lacklustre.  Richard Harris comes off best as Arthur though he's no Burton.  Burton would have been too old to play the role on film but his greatness as a film and stage actor is something that can not be denied and he remains in a class apart from Harris.  Vanessa Redgrave as Guinevere is for me a disappointment.  I find it hard to imagine her as a queen at all for she lacks the regal bearing and elegance needed to play this queen of legend.  Her singing is acceptable given you have never heard Julie in this score.  Julie brought the right amount of natural elegance to the role while still being mischievous, flirtatious and sly when needed before becoming a woman who creates a major problem for herself by loving two men.  Her singing of ""The Simple Joys Of Maidenhood"" and ""The Lusty Month Of May"" are comic and vocal delights while ""I Loved You Once In Silence"" is heartbreaking.  Redgrave does not come close in matching Julie's talent as singer and actress.  Franco Nero is a handsome Lancelot but it's hard in 2006 to accept movies where the actor's singing has been dubbed as his is for this film.

My advice:  if you have an afternoon and evening to kill watch this but be warned it's pretty hard going.  If you want to hear this classic score at its best try the Broadway cast recording.  There are also excerpts that were filmed for ""The Ed Sullivan Show"" back in 1960 with the original cast that are available on DVD.  They give an inkling into what this film might have been like with the right director and cast.",1159142400,13,2316,4.505995203836931
847996,2,6304331851,"""Camelot"" on Broadway was cursed with the most excrutiatingly boring book that droned on and on and on.  But the production was blessed with a stellar cast including Richard Burton, Julie Andrews and Robert Goulet and an excellent score which included ""If Ever I Would Leave You"" powerfully sung by Mr. Goulet.

Joshua Logan was tapped to direct the film version and of all the reasons why the film failed-Logan as the director was the biggest.  Richard Harris as King Arthur when he wasn't hamming it up acted so morose you would think someone told him all the pubs in England had run dry.

Vanessa Redgrave made an enchanting Guinevere but her demeanor was somewhat on the frosty side.

Although the film boasted scenes of castles, vast meadows and grand castle ceremonial halls, Joshua Logan filmed a lot of the movie using extreme close-ups of his actors.  And a tight close-up on Richard Harris' face on the giant cinemascope screen was especially distracting. When he sang his nose-hair could be seen swaying to the music. And on one of Vanessa Redgraves close-ups, it was obvious she had a cold, and a joker in the movie audience shouted, ""Arthur get thy wife a hankie,""--Ok! Ok! I admit it-I was the joker who said it.",1153440000,7,1226,4.732394366197183

847998,5,6304331851,"With its lavish sets, beautiful music, and undeniable star quality, Camelot is a wonderful motion picture built upon the successful Lerner-Loewe Broadway musical, which in turn was based on T.H. White's The Once and Future King.  It is in no way a definitive account of King Arthur's story, as it concentrates on the fateful lovers' triangle of Arthur, Guinevere, and Lancelot.  I probably have a different take on the legendary romance of Arthur's two closest companions than most, for I look upon this story not as a love story at all, but as a true tragedy.  Franco Nero is wonderful as Lancelot (despite the fact that Nero is Italian, not French), and Vanessa Redgrave makes for a most enchanting Queen Guinevere, but my opinion of these illicit lovers is set in stone and could hardly be pulled out even by the likes of Arthur.  To me, Lancelot is one of the biggest cads in literature.  Granted, he had no intention of falling in love with Guinevere, but his actions made a mockery of all his numerous, rather obnoxious claims to purity, nobility, and chivalry.  Chivalry does not start by betraying your king and closest friend to engage in an adulterous affair that could not but lead to disastrous consequences on an epic scale.  This just goes to show how one lone Frenchman can bring about the ruin of the noblest of kingdoms.

I initially had a little trouble with Richard Harris as King Arthur, as he certainly doesn't conform to my image of the legendary hero (my King Arthur, for example, doesn't wear copious amounts of eye shadow), but his nobility and sense of purpose soon won me over.  Still, I'm not overly fond of the film's characterization of the man, for it creates for us the image of a weak, ineffective ruler who shames himself over his unfaithful wife and basically allows his kingdom to fall into ruin all around him.  I don't see many glimpses of ""the future king"" in this movie.  It would not be right for me to describe this as a fault with the film, however; it's just part of the filmmakers' designs, as their intention was to show us Arthur the man rather than the mythic Arthur of legend.  This version of King Arthur is exceedingly human, and that makes for some powerful scenes, particularly his passionate soliloquies as he ponders the loss of everything he cares about.  One cannot help but despair alongside Arthur as Camelot begins to crumble, particularly since, in this version of the tale, Merlin never warned against marrying Guinevere.  The one weak character in the film is Mordred (David Hemmings), who - despite his late-arrived scheming - seems almost tangential to the tragedy that unfolds.

While the film runs almost a full three hours, it never really succeeds in revealing the true magic of Camelot.  The hopes and dreams of Arthur for his Round Table of noble knights dedicated to pursuing justice and right doesn't get enough emphasis, and his attempt to create a criminal justice system feels like little more than a plot device for Mordred to orchestrate his downfall.  The loss of the Arthurian ideal is the true tragedy of this story, but too much of the film's emotion is dedicated to the illicit lovers, ignoring the fact that their sins would have basically pushed England into the Dark Ages.

It's a real shame that the musical has all but disappeared as a cinematic art form these days, as Camelot shows just how much depth and meaning an impassioned score and exquisite songs can add to a story.  When you think of Camelot, you think of the characters and the story only after your mind replays such songs as the title theme and the award-winning love song If Ever I Would Leave You.

The DVD's special features are good but not great.  Alongside comparably short descriptions of important Arthurian topics, short bios and filmographies of prominent players in the drama, and five different movie trailers, you get a 10-minute contemporary documentary about the filming of Camelot and a thirty-minute look at the movie's opening (with Vanessa Redgrave rather conspicuous in her absence).",1150502400,7,4056,4.807194244604316

I had listened to the Julie Andrews, Richard Burton, Robert Goulet cast album and loved the score.  I finally got a chance to see the film and it was unbearable.

I would say that it is the cast - most have never been in a musical and never have done a musical again.  But I saw Richard Harris do it on stage and he was brilliant.

I have to put the blame on director Joshua Logan.  Logan was one of the greats of Broadway and Hollywood but at times he got caught up in the luxury of the movie (look at South Pacific).  And this film is overly luxuriant.

If you are a fan of the show then try and find the Showtime production of the Richard Harris stage production.  This was a beautiful filming of a stage show.",1149811200,6,860,4.071428571428571
848000,5,6304331851,"This is the way musicals should be.  I'm not saying that Camelot is better than all the rest, but that it's a drama that just happens to be a musical.  It is all centered around King Arthur, (A wonderful Richard Harris) and his wife Guenevere (played by a beautiful Vanessa Redgrave) and what happens when Guenevere haves an affair with Arthur's friend Lancelot (Played by a handsome Nero, but Nero's acting isn't that great.)

Harris is perfect for Arthur.  He's strong and yet fragile when it comes to his cheating jenny.

Vanessa Redgrave turns in another great performance.  When this film was released, it received mixed reviews, but Redgrave always was praised.

Nero.  Well, Redgrave makes up for his lack of talent.  I will tell you that this film is three hours long and it does feel that long, only when Nero is on the screen, but the other actors back up his scenes.",1148947200,,877,4.642857142857143
848001,5,6304331851,"This film deserves its five stars for many reasons. One is the young Vanessa Redgrave, stately, gorgeous, limpidly serene as Guinevere; another is Richard Harris (God forbid that we should only remember him as Dumbledore); yet another is Franco Nero (C'est moi! C'est moi! C'est moi!). And finally, the little known but nonetheless admirable David Hemmings as Mordred (deliciously smarmy!).

Another reason is that this film is centrally placed in the Arthurian tradition. ""Camelot"" conveys the heart-breaking vision of T.H. White's Once and Future King -- itself based on Thomas Malory's fifteenth-century ""Morte Darthur"" -- to a modern audience. Perhaps the singing in the movie could have been better. But it's passable, and this film's virtues far outweigh its defects.

Let me just enumerate a few of the high points: The wonderful scene in which, on her way to Camelot, Guinevere escapes through the snow to croon the memorable ""Where are the Simple Joys of Maidenhood,"" only to be discovered by her future husband quite incognito; Lancelot fighting Arthur - again incognito - whom he unexpectedly defeats ""in the name of King Arthur""; Guinevere's comeuppance when Lancelot knocks down all of the knights she's set against him in a tournament, and his comeuppance in return when, after reviving one who seems to be fatally wounded, he stares into Guinevere's eyes and the two fall in love.

Of course, such stuff is corny! That's what's great about it! ""Camelot"" makes ""happy ever-aftering"" a virtue not to be underestimated.",1147910400,,1531,5.190283400809717

And it was funny to see Richard Harris as a younger man, since I've only seen him as Professor Dumbledore! This movie was supposed to be based on T.H. White's rendition on King Arthur and Camelot called ""The Once and Future King."" They tried to stick to the story line but they left out alot of the most important,funny and exciting parts of the book. We didn't get to see the Questing Beast,Arthur's education with Merlyn where Arthur becomes and communicates with all types of creatures, seeing the companion of Merlyn--the talking owl Archimedes, there was nothing with Gawaine, Gareth, Gaharris and Agravaine, and we didn't get to see Queen Morgause or Morgan La Fey in their Faery Palace, and there was no Robin Wood in the movie!

848003,4,6304331851,"In school, we're doing a lesson on the Medieval times. So, for the project, we watched this 1967 musical on the much told tale of ""King Arthur"". I was a little apprehensive at first since it was long in length, but then I gained confidence when I saw that the cast was led by Richard Harris and Vanessa Redgrave, to very fine actors. Well, I watched the movie, and now I shall write a review on it.

I'm not going to bore anyone with plot details since anyone who knows the legend of King Arthur and Camelot knows the plot of the movie. What I will focus my review on is the music and the acting. The songs are absolutely fantastic. ""If Ever I Should Leave You"" remains a classic, but for me the standout performance was ""The Lusty Month Of May"". That song was superb. The rest of the songs were also very good. I wish I could say the same for the rest of the movie. The cast is so so. I felt that Richard Harris and Vanessa Redgrave took turns carrying the movie, since I couldn't buy Franco Nero's Lancelot. The two stars' talent are on full display, as without the film, this movie would have tedious and unbearable. I also felt the film could have been a lot shorter. I felt that it got drawn out towards the end (by the end, many of us were disappointed by the end) and could have cut out some stuff.

Well, 38 years have passed since this film were released, and three things are still abundantly clear:

1) The music is still superb.

2) Harris and Redgrave still shine.

3) It isn't as good as many remember it.

I'd really only recommend this movie to fans of the genre of musicals. Otherwise, nobody will find this film very interesting.",1122854400,4,1647,4.296774193548387
848004,1,6304331851,"Someone out there is going to hate me for this review, and so be it; we are all entitled to our opinions. And here is mine:

I knew this was a musical from the get-go, and I am not fond of musicals, but I decided to give it a chance since I do like Richard Harris, and any good medieval tale. I rented this out just to see how closely the thing rode out to the true King Arthur legend. It was WRETCHED. I suppose the costumes are great if you like watching gala balls or modern model wear for the rich elite of the 60s, but no way in hell does it come close to looking anything like the real time era it's attempting to depict. The styles are all over the place and everything from the armor, weaponry and castle decor are like a conglomerated hodgepodge of design from all over the world. I guess if you have enough faith that Richard Harris can sing, then you can muster up enough faith to believe that this disastrous fairy-tale kingdom really existed somewhere at some time, but if you're a stickler for realism and accuracy (even in fantasy tales) like me, it will drive you mad.

As for the singing, or I should say, ""singing,"" the actors making goo-goo eyes at each other as they swell with exaggerated emotion is just flat out nauseating. Watching Harris reel around in disbelief making those soggy sad-eyes while crooning with a cracked voice just grated on my spine like fingernails on a chalkboard. Despite the stars in the cast, the acting is shallow, fake, and not very believable all-around. Probably the only outstanding performance was by a dashing young David Hemmings, decked-out in leather as deliciously evil Mordred, whom we hardly get to see very much of, but is actually a key player in the downfall of Arthur, his relationship, his position as king, and his knights. He's the only one in the cast that had any kind of singing ability, and that, unfortunately, ended up on the cutting room floor. What a shame.

The whole thing is a bloated bag of overblown, overlong and overdone pageantry. I guess if you like outrageous costumes and actors cast as singers who never had any vocal training, this movie will delight you. It seemed to drag on FOREVER (it even gives you a mid-movie intermission...to brew yourself some strong coffee and try to wake up, I suppose) and then ends abruptly, after leaving out big chunks of the actual legend. If I didn't know how the story went beforehand, I doubt the movie would have even made very much sense at all. The ending is so sudden, it feels as though they wanted to go on for another 3 hours but had to just wrap it up since they'd made it such a drawn-out, painful mess already.

If I'd seen this as an actual stage production, perhaps I'd have had a different opinion of it. If you saw all that pageantry in real life I imagine it'd have much more of an impact. On DVD, however, and even as a movie on a big screen, it's little more than a sparkly Christmas ball - decorative, but empty inside.",1122681600,7,2962,4.439338235294118
848005,5,6304331851,"I enjoyed ""Camelot"" from the very moment the title came onscreen, in big red lettering. The focus of the musical is on the destructive love triangle between Arthur, Guinevere and Lancelot, and on the idealized and idyllic lost world that was once Camelot. Despite the sense of loss, it ends on a hopeful note, that one day, Camelot may rise again. Pay attention to the little boy at the end of the movie: his name is Tom, he is from Warwickshire, and he is knighted by Arthur. I'm pretty sure this is an allusion to Sir Thomas Malory, author of Le Morte Darthur, the indirect source for ""Camelot,"" and who was also a knight and from Warwickshire. Moreover, Malory wrote ""Le Morte Darthur"" out of a nostalgic and idealistic vision of knighthood, so the idealistic little boy, who still believes in Camelot, almost certainly represents him.

Much of the story is told through the songs. The songs are wonderful, and I enjoyed all of them, but ""The simple joys of Maidenhood,"" ""I loved you once in silence,"" ""The Lusty Month of May,"" ""Then You May Take Me to the Fair"" and of course ""Camelot,"" (including its reprise at the close of the film, with different lyrics), are simply amazing. And it's not just the music. The lyrics are marvelous.

One reviewer writes that he is disappointed with the singing. I can imagine that after seeing the play with Julie Andrews in New York, one has every right to feel that way. Vanessa Redgrave is not Julie Andrews, to be sure, but she looks beautiful on screen, and her singing is more than OK, as is the singing of Richard Harris (Arthur. It could have been better, but it is enjoyable as it is. Incidentally, both Richard Harris and the young blue-eyed Franco Nero look very good, each in his own way.

This DVD has been digitally remastered, and as a result, the image is simply superb! The settings are splendid and almost overwhelming.

No printing presses in Medieval times? SO WHAT?! It's a movie. Get it? Movie- fantasy, fun, suspension of reality for a few precious hours.

Richard Harris is great as Arthur, very excited and ready to do good, Ginny is s very lithe and young, and ready to get into trouble, and Lance ready for a fall.

The costumes are SO cool. I didn't like them back in the 80's, but they wear well. The sets are pretty and the choreography is sweet.

848065,1,6304331851,"My earliest memory is seeing an outdoor community theatre performance of Camelot on a warm summer night.  There was romance, there was drama and tragedy, there were swords and real horses and fire.  It captivated my sisters and me so much we each remember it in a visceral way.  As a result, every few years I return to this movie with renewed hope (I have selective memory loss when it comes to the classics being butchered on film) but always end up disappointed.  This movie is such a terrible failure.

I love Richard Harris, and his acting is strong, but he just doesn't have the voice for the role.  Sadly, no one in this production of one of my favorite musicals does - such a shame.  Redgrave is simply wrong for the role, and Nero seems a parody of what Lancelot should be.

Even the strangely dated sets and costumes would be excusable if the performances were better, but unfortunately the entire thing falls flat.  The themes of duty, love, passion, and betrayal seem limp in the hands of the stars and the director.

When King Arthur reprises Camelot at the end, a good production should capture a moment as heartbreaking as the moment when Robert Preston reminds Ron Howard that he ""always think(s) there's a band"" in the Music Man.  Instead, the only heartbreak here is that one of the great gems of Musical Theatre was squandered on such a failure of a cinematic production.",1099094400,15,1390,4.609756097560975
848066,2,6304331851,"One of my fondest childhood memories is being taken to the Majestic Theatre in New York to see Richard Burton and Julie Andrews in Camelot. It was a magical experience and one of the reasons why I have a lifelong love of musicals. Naturally, I could not wait for Camelot to be filmed. When it was, way back in 1967, I was extremely disappointed. Seeing it again - or, rather, trying to sit through it - has not changed that opinion.

All the ingredients were there for a classic musical: an enchanted setting, familiar characters, a brilliant score, a script with flashes of wit. So what if the choreography was minimal? Instead we got a musical with plot and characters, comedy and drama. At least, we got that when it was on the stage.

Where did the film go wrong? The casting nearly doomed it - a musical populated with non-singers. Of course, that in itself is not always a problem (see West Side Story) but here the actors try to sing for themselves. King Arthur's songs were written to be what Alan Jay Lerner described as ""talk-sung"" and worked as well for Richard Burton as the method had for Rex Harrison in My Fair Lady. But Richard Harris had delusions of vocal grandeur and destroyed every song he touched. And Vanessa Redgrave...not to mention Franco Nero...? Still, the film might have survived the casting if it had a better director. Joshua Logan was really a stage director and had little feel for cinema (see South Pacific if you doubt that). Camelot's direction is that it had no direction. Example: At the end of the film, during what should have been a brilliantly dramatic and unforgettable moment, the camera zooms IN on Richard Harris, almost going up his nostrils, instead of pulling back to reveal the entire scene.

Visually, some of the film is quite impressive. But three hours is a long time to look at just costumes and scenery. And some bits are just laughable - such as spreading the word about Camelot throughout the land with flyers. (a) They didn't have printing presses then because (b) hardly anyone could read. But that's the sort of film it is - you need to suspend your belief along with your expectations.

There are many good and even great musicals available on DVD. Buy any or all of them instead of Camelot.",1093564800,11,2254,4.613466334164588
848067,4,6304331851,"WARNING: I saw Camelot as a child when it was first released-it made an impression. I then read the OFK by T.H. WHITE in one day and wrote an honors thesis on the development of the Arthurian legend in college. So yes,the story had some resonance for me. But why do I think Camelot works, whereas Excalibur, the latest King Arthur film and all the earlier films don't really? Because Camelot remembers 1)That audiences are more interested in people (character(s)) than plot. The people NOT the battles, NOT the magic, NOT the SPFX. (See why Spiderman2 works, or LOTR) And (2)Camelot is the ONLY version of the story that had a TRIANGLE--where 3 people care about each other EQUALLY, yet it still breaks. And the only way you get that tragedy is if both Guenevere and Lancelot love Arthur as much as they love each other. Otherwise it's just another adulterous affair, and Arthur is a cuckold we don't give a damn about.
  Re production: The sets were not cardboard. They filmed on-location in Spain at Coca, Alcazar of Segovia etc. etc.  Warners backlot built actual bricks/morter castle courtyard & real forest.",1090972800,21,1112,4.78125

is terrible-not that the show was great,anyway. And the entire

Their work makes the soundtrack listenable. Other than that,a poor

Julie Andrews voice is so superior to Redgrave's it is not even funny.  Julie should have been the Queen.  At least they asked her to be.  I loved the way she declined and since she wouldn't perform this show fell through.  I hated the way the director says that there was no one else better than Vanessa for the Queen.  He must have been in denial that Julie said ""No.""  Julie clearly would have been the better choice.  I also think the storyline is slightly terrible.  I have always had mixed feelings about the King Arthur legends.  I hate how the Queen falls for Lancelot, he is the most self-absorbed snot that ever lived.

848071,5,6304331851,"In this lavish adaptation of the Broadway musical based on T.H. White's modern classic ""The Once and Future King,"" the music of Frederick Loewe and Lyrics of Alan Jay Lerner weave this story into an intricate tapestry of unforgettable heart-stirring emotions. The emotions are quite overpowering and you almost have to watch this movie three times to fully appreciate the texture and detail of the 45 sets and 3,500 costumes.

Camelot is a timeless romantic drama that takes us to a medieval world that could only be imagined in your most romantic fantasy. The humor is witty, the music is unforgettable and the world of Camelot has castle scenes that are beyond compare. In fact, if you love castles, you will see scenes from dreamy castles in Spain. The Castle of Camelot is modeled after the Castle of Coca. The architectural details in the design are partly Romanesque, Norman, Viking and Gothic. The decorations have a ""fantasy"" medieval flavor.

The movie is at first shrouded in mystery as Arthur sits in a dark misty forest. Arthur is about to go into battle and doesn't want to die in a state of confusion. Merlin advises Arthur to think back to the time when he met Guenevere.

We are transported into King Arthur's memory, where the entire story takes place in vivid detail. King Arthur sings about his fears of the wedding night and it is all rather cute and humorous. We instantly see King Arthur as an eternal boy and later find out how he became king quite by accident when he draws the sword, Excalibur, out of a stone.

Guenevere arrives all wrapped in fur as she travels through the ""most ferocious, savage, terrifying forest"" she has ever seen. The branches are laden with snow and icicles. She simply adores the danger and beauty. When she hears the forest is quite dangerous, she wishes to be stolen away. Her heart is quite hungry for adventure and romance as a damsel in distress and all she has to look forward to is an arranged marriage.

When she meets ""Wart"" she has no idea he is King Arthur and asks him to run away with her. Vanessa Redgrave and Richard Harris are like two happy children living in a magical dream. King Arthur has a boyish charm, plenty of witty lines and the almost periwinkle eye shadow quite matches his turtleneck sweater and promotes a whimsical mood.

The royal marriage is magnificent and the wedding gown flows between two seas of candles. For a time, we truly believe this arranged marriage will succeed. Arthur shares his dreams of uniting the feudal city-states and Guenevere seems intrigued with her husband's leadership qualities. She too seems to be dreaming of a new world filled with chivalrous knights who fight for right.

When French knight Sir Lancelot arrives, he destroys the intimacy between Guenevere and King Arthur, although he promises to be the king's defender in this newly civilized world. Guenevere becomes a woman who must make impossible decisions. Lancelot dreams of all the good he can do, all the wrongs he can right and in fact, his desires lead him to a place where a fragile utopia is destroyed.

""Camelot"" then becomes a serious study in how three people are almost forced to make irreversible decisions. King Arthur (Richard Harris) seems to quickly go into an extended period of denial and since he deeply loves Guenevere, he forgives her for being human. Lancelot (Franco Nero) lives life intensely and feels deeply about King Arthur's mission. He is filled with a passion for life and makes promises he can hardly keep once he enters Guenevere's world.

Guenevere (Vanessa Redgrave) is so innocent in her love of both King Arthur and Lancelot. She falls madly in love with Lancelot because he embodies all that she has always dreamed of, despite the fact that their love now destroys Lancelot's chivalrous ideals. He fights for her and his impressive battle skills and depth of emotion after he fights in the joust draws her into his world. Each time they look at one another, the world stands still and in awe of this love they feel for one another. If only she had met Lancelot before she had been promised to King Arthur.

I doubt there is a more powerfully erotic and yet angelic scene than the one where Guenevere stands in the doorway with her golden hair flowing behind her in the drafty castle. This scene portrays her in an almost angelic way as ""If Ever I Would Leave You"" plays on, drawing us into an intimate circle created by three hearts who are forever woven into this immortal tale. How can your heart not melt when Lancelot declares his undying affection by saying: ""I, I love you. God forgive me, but I do.""

I really can't think of a more perfect movie. Sadly at the end of the movie, the story is not quite what we expect. Yet, I don't think we would want this movie to end in any other way.

848244,5,6304331851,"This movie is adapted from ""The Once and Future King"" by T.H. White.  And you probably know the story - boy becomes king, king is betrothed in an arranged marriage, Lancelot pops in....It is _nothing_ like the book but it does have its good points.
One is Richard Harris' over the top performance as King Arthur. He, much in the manner of Rex Harrison in ""My Fair Lady"", speaks his songs as opposed to singing them. Suprisingly, it actually works very well. It's not the ""feel good movie"" of all time, but it is a good one about flawed individuals - and it was said to be President John F. Kenndy's favorite Broadway play.
So if you're interested in seeing a movie that will make you think about great leaders' errors in judgement, along with the pagentry of court life, this is a movie for you. I recommend it highly.",1062115200,5,818,4.453333333333333
848245,4,6304331851,"Reviewers pick on the film's weaknesses, but overall, I think it is winning.  Here are my top disagreements with fellow viewers:
1)  Blue eyeshadow.  This adds to the exoticism of the medieval setting, in which courtiers were often dandy types, and strange fashions came and went.
2)  Stage cast vs. film cast.  Overall, I'd say the film audience got the best of it.  Most of all, Richard Harris, who campaigned for the part, plays Arthur with such puckish enthusiasm, dramatizing the conflict between the human boy/man and the beloved king.  Famous and drunk, Richard Burton would never have brought so much charm to the role.  (Later Harris became famous and drunk.)  Vanessa Redgrave's ethereal yet sensual charmisma convinces us that she is the fickle queen who dismantled Camelot; Julie Andrews' girl next door quality would never have had the same magic.
3)  Franco Nero was no Olivier, but his handsome doll-like appearance and stiffness actually drive the humor home in the hilarious ""C'est Moi.""  He comes across as a slick and shallow narcissist, making us feel worse for the all-too-human Arthur.
4)  Singing voices.  In most musicals the singing voices are dubbed.  Here they sang as they acted, giving the songs a rough but natural quality.  Harris is a good singer.  Redgrave's voice is delicate but this emphasizes her charm.  Nero?  Oh well.
5)  The film could have benefited from some editing.  It does get a little pompous.  The score relies too heavily on the songs, sometimes forecasting them before they have actually been performed, which bugs me.
6)  The highly detailed set is wonderful and has aged well.
Humor and sweet, manipulative emotion win the day.  You have to be willing to go along with this film, as its original audience was.",1058313600,11,1762,4.938566552901024
848246,5,6304331851,"I am an advocate of all the arts and Broadway musicals have descended from the noble art of opera. The musical era of the early twentieth century did not die in the face of the Cuba/Missile conflict, nor in the war years of Vietnam. The brilliant musical masters, Rogers and Hammerstein and Lerner and Lowe were incredibly gifted, providing audiences with catchy melodies, romance and powerful dramatic emotions. In Lerner and Lowe's Camelot, we are immersed by the love triange between Arthur, Guenevere and Lancelot, which seems small next to the bigger picture- the stability of Camelot. Camelot is the ideal world, the perfect society, Utopia, Paradise. With the aid of the good wizard sage Merlin, Arthur assumed heavy responsibility as king and head of the Round Table, a fellowship of knights on the quest for the Holy Grail and sworn to uphold justice and balance in the world. This peace was upset by war and by the problematic situation that arose when Guenevere fell in love with Arthur's best friend and champion knight, Lancelot.
In this excellent DVD, the 60's film is back with full glory. We realize why this musical appealed to a generation that was insistent on peace. Richard Harris is the perfect Arthur, idealistic, romantic, wise, mature, and in his scenes with Merlin we do see the pararellism with the writings of T.H. Lawrence's ""Once And Future King"" and the magic (Arthur becomes a goldfish, communes with nature, etc, is similar to the Disney interpretion, ""The Sword In The Stone"". Richard Harris sings superbly in his solos, ""Camelot,"" and ""How To Handle A Woman"". Vanessa Redgrave was not the original stage interpreter of Guenevere. The credit belongs to Julie Andrews, whose light voice, cheerful, innocent and sweet temperament is directly polar opposite to Guenevere's lusty, earthy, darker-voiced portrayal. But in my personal opinion, Vanessa Redgrave captures the true Guenevere. This is evident in her song ""Where are the Joys of Maidenhood ?"" ""Take me to the Fair"", ""The Lusty Month of May"" and her melancholy duet with Lancelot ""I loved You Once In Silence"". Franco Nero as Lancelot is charming, comedic, witty, a direct opposite to the upright Arthur, but we are sympathetic with his situation when his humanity comes through. He decides to break up with Guenevere out of his own love and respect for Arthur. Unfortunately, that is the moment when their affair is discovered, and the rest is history. Arthur battles Mordred, both of them lose and die, and Camelot disappears into the pages of myth. The rousing choruses are striking, especially in the wedding of Guenevere and Arthur and when Guenevere is sentenced to be burned at the stake. The finale is unsurpassed, as Arthur says: ""Ask anyone if they've ever heard the story, and if they have not, say it loud and clear; that once there was a fleeting wisp of glory..called Camelot"".",1041897600,14,2880,4.977178423236515
848247,5,6304331851,"An exceptional adaptation of a hit Broadway musical about the legend of King Arthur's mistily-remembered reign in the time of chivalrous knighthood and England's transition from the Dark Ages into the Enlightenment.  The plot is magnigficent, opening with a capering Richard Harris, whose introductory scenes are so over the top and mincey that even the most enlightened boyfriend/hubby will find his fingers wandering for the remote or searching for a brewski.  But King Arthur, like the film, gathers gravitas as the story unfolds... The classic triangle between Arthur, Guinnevere and Lancelot is retold as a parable for the civilizing of England itself -- Arthur allows himself to be cuckholded not for his love of a friend (which is the traditional view), but because to seek revenge would be to slide back into the might-makes-right barbarity and rule by force that he seeks to supplant as king of the newly unified England.  As a figurehead, he is trapped in more ways than one, and his character squirms painfully under our gaze, like a butterfly on a collector's pin.  The mix of humor and pathos is deftly played, and by the end, we're all swept up by the inevitable, inexorable tragedy, yet can still relish Harris' lusty hamminess.  I'm not that knowlegable about musical theatre, but I thought this film was swell.",1041897600,9,1327,5.013636363636364

848249,5,6304331851,"The Lerner and Lowe musical seems to be a variation from the T.H. Lawrence novel, ""The Once and Future King,"" from which the animated Dysney film was taken. Richard Harris, Vanessa Redgrave and Franco Nero effectively carry out the movie, their voices superb in every song and their dramatic performances making an excellent and enjoyable film. The story is the age-old Arthur myth. King Arthur, the idealist, tutored by his all-knowing wizard Merlin, creates Camelot, a peaceful realm supported by the mighty Round Table, whose aim is ""Might for Right"". But things begin to fall apart for Arthur and his dream. Guenevere, whose marriage to Arthur had all been arranged, falls for the dashing French-born champion Knight, Lancelot. Their affair sparks the suspicion of Mordred who reveals it to the public, just when it was ending (the parting scene between Guenevere and Lancelot..""And I shall never come to you again"" and their duet is very emotional and heartrendering). As we know, Mordred and Arthur battle, the Round Table is dissolved and Camelot becomes a dream remembered. This musical was appropriate to its milieu. It was the 60's when this film was made, and peace rallies were manifested over America. The idealism of peace and brotherly harmony (as in the Round Table) is effectively similar to the idealism of American government. The allegory of the musical is quite transparent. I hope you give this musical a chance, and it has a special place in my heart. Along with The Sound of Music and The King and I, this musical stands out in the great tradition. Five stars well deserved. Songs that stand out in this musical are ""I wonder what the King is doing tonight"" ""Where are the Sweet Joys of Maidenhood ?"", ""Camelot"" ""How to handle a woman"" and ""If I ever Would Leave You.""",1034985600,19,1792,4.878688524590164

My favorite is ""Lusty Month of May"" and if you have a 5.1 Stereo System this number surrounds you with beautiful music and so with ""If Ever i Could Leave You."" My eyes tear-up terribly during that number. I don't know how anyone couldn't fall in love with this movie. Also this movie is in it's original Roadshow Format with it's arousing Round Table speech from Richard Harris as the music builds just before ""Intermission."" It gives me chills just writing about it.

848251,2,6304331851,"Having grown up listening to the Broadway album recording of ""Camelot,"" my hopes were dashed upon recently viewing this DVD. Having never realized that there were two soundtrack albums for Camelot, it never occured to me that I wouldn't be hearing the stirring singing of the Broadway album, including the villainous songs of Mordred, which were easily my favorite pieces in the whole work.
In addition to not hearing ""The Seven Deadly Virtues"" and ""Fie on Goodness"" -- two of the greatest villain songs of all time, without question -- the musical and acting performances overall here are subpar at best. Richard Harris seems to be trying to do his whole performance via his eyebrows, which wiggle about on his forehead like catepillars trying to escape his face. Vanessa Redgrave, for all her justly deserved reputation as an actress, looks more underfed than radiant as Guenevere and Franco Nearo seems to be having a lot of fun in an entirely different film.
Director Joshua Logan did the real damage to this story, though, with a disjointed directing style that focusses more on interesting scenes and bits than making a coherent tale. Time passes at varying rates, with never any warning to that effect, and while some of the issues with the script are leftovers from the play, there's no excuse for not making a more coherent film, cutting and adding to the book as needed.
On the whole, this is a highly disappointing movie, and the DVD has a slapped together feel, with pale text in a squiggly font placed atop bright backgrounds, making much of the additional content -- which is anemic compared to disks like ""Shrek"" -- unreadable and unusable.

848253,5,6304331851,"I liked ""Camelot"" (1967), with Richard Harris, Vanessa Redgrave, and Franco Nero.  On it's own, it is very good.  The stars do their best, and that's saying alot.  There are no ""wink-wink, nod-nod"" hints toward JFK and that ""Camelot"".  The songs are memorable, and were probably sung by the actors themselves. The film never seems too long, or too short. The location setting looks like long-ago England, and France.  The stars act and sound like people from long ago, not as though they time traveled from the 1960's.  It is a great combined tale of people who, on the one hand who probably did live in the past, and at the same time, are the stuff of legends. It is also the story of important people centuries ago who had the same human failings as the people of today do, even you or I. Where the film falters, thru no blame of the movie's actual stars, is in comparrison to the Broadway actors. Richard Burton, Julie Andrews, and Robert Goulet. Mr. Harris, Ms. Redgrave, and Mr. Nero are just not in the same ballpark. Comparing the play's cd to the movie's cd only shows how much better the theatre's performers really were.  When asked to star in the movie; Richard Burton said no; then J. Andrews said no, then probably everyone else in the play said no; which made the movie producers have to recast all the parts. The movie casting department did a wonderful job, but, I hope, someone had a video tape of the original Broadway cast doing the play.

848345,4,6304331851,"A musical. But this is NOT a chick flick. This is an era of Hollywood stage-to-screen musicals at it's best. You all know the myth of Arthur, Guinever, and Lancelot in so many permeated forms. This is the one that started it all, and if I must say (oh, I must, I must), it is one of the best (maybe Excalibur). I read Maltin's review, and I gotta tell ya, Maltin needs to crack open a few cold ones and get off the high horse. Yes, Camelot can be a rather stiff translation from stage to screen at times, but take the whole bag or don't take it at all. Richard Harris made his mark with this movie. He is THE King Arthur which all subsequent Arthurs are guaged by. Venessa Redgrave never looked or acted better (I mean that), and the scene where Lancelot (Franco Nero) believed he had killed his friend in a joust, damn near made me cry. It was exceptional, considering this movie was done during the men-don't-cry era. David Hemmings is the perfect bastard as Mordred, Arthur's son by his sister. I don't know why Arthur insisted on calling Guinevere `Jenny', nor Lancelot `Lance'. I presume it was to `update' the film. But it doesn't matter. Every phrase is perfect in it's place. Arthur's solitary prose upon discovering Lancelot's love for Guinvere is a masterpiece in reflection, and it's style is still copied to this day. Something that makes you realize there was such great screenwriting in the 60's. There is a certain sadness in the movies' realization of a time and world lost, yet the songs, `What Do The Simple Folk Do', `Camelot', and `If I Ever Would Leave You' have created an eternal survival for this film. The costuming was typical `clean' serf suits, but the scenery looked as real as could be. And the soundtrack? absolutely magnificant. I am not a big fan of musicals. I am not a fan of overacting. But the background music to this film is as stirring as Armeggeddon, and the cinematography is excellent. There are no flaws in the film-to-dvd translation. If you own Lawrence of Arabia, you will own this. There is a line in this movie, ""you will learn that the world wags, and what wags it"". There is magic in this film. It embraces that kind of enchantment. Trust me. I am never wrong.",1005004800,28,2211,4.516209476309227
848346,5,6304331851,"Camelot has a rather dated look to it in some ways. The reds and oranges, greens, and earth tones were colors that were all popular back in the late '60's, and may have been realistic for the time period depicted in the film. However, I don't suppose it would have been realistic for Richard Harris to wear the eyeshadow that has been mentioned in other reviews, or for Vanessa Redgrave to wear her hair in a Leeway bang or to have false eyelashes. As this was 1967, and many of the British actors in this film were Blitz survivors the film has a strong anti-war message especially towards the end.
The cinematography and audio are both sharp and glorious. Richard Harris' singing has more emotion than Richard Burton's did in the stage production of ""Camelot"". Harris'pensive version of ""How to Handle A Woman"" is moving, although slightly chauvinistic. Like her performance,Vanessa Redgrave's contralto is sensuous and subtle in contrast to Julie Andrews' soprano in the original stage version.--Perfect for a ballad like ""I Loved You Once In Silence"". It's nice that the two leads were capable of doing their own singing unlike Franco Nero, whose quizzical-faced Lancelot got better as the film progressed. It would have been interesting to see what could have been done with the three songs that were left out of the film-""Before I Gaze at You Again"", ""Fie on Goodness"", and ""The Seven Deadly Virtues""- the last of which could have been sung by David Hemmings' Mordred with such relish! In the event that such a film could be remade today (Why not? It's happened with ""South Pacific""), I've often thought of who could do the parts justice. I've thought of Michael Crawford as King Arthur because at least he can sing, Sarah Brightman could still be Guenevere even though she's in her forties now, Christian Slater could match, if not outdo David Hemmings in sleaziness as Mordred, and Mel Gibson could be a Lancelot to whom even a King could forgive himself for losing his wife's affections.--Just a thought.

It is visually stunning and full of great emotion and yet seems to have a very great cerebral perspective overall in its effect. The picture wavers in tone and seems a bit episodic, but it does have skillful bits of genius tucked in among the gayety, pomp and circumstance, love, war and reflection. This is very uncharacteristic filmmaking from Logan. Richard Harris' King Arthur is beautifully underplayed and unfathomable at times. But he achieves some very effective moments in this unique telling of the Arthur legend. The movie is somewhat dark at times as it juxtaposes humor, which is biting such as is seen in the performance by David Hemmings and the screen presence of Franco Nero very foreign Sir Lancelot. It's a film that may grow on you each time you return to it. It did for me.

Yet, we have RICHARD HARRIS, so perfect as the failing  King Arthur, Vanessa Redgrave, never lovelier than in her role as the torn  Guinavere, and David Hemmings, a dastardly 'mod' Mordred reeking havoc on  the troubled Kingdom.  Franco Nero (dubbing notwithstanding) brings a  wonderful comedic touch to Lancelot, and with the sumptious sets and  costumes, 'Camelot' really is a BEAUTIFUL film.  It has been critisized for  having a 'Sixties' feel to it, but the somewhat hippy-ish design just adds  to the pleasure; and it REALLY doesn't matter that Richard Harris is  wearing WAY to much blue eye-shadow - we're in CAMELOT, for goodness sake!  There may very well be a 'legal limit to the snow' there, but when it comes  to make-up, no holds are barred! Oh, one can pick a MILLION holes in  'Camelot' - but why bother? It's better just to pour yourself a glass of  mead, light some candles, put 'Camelot' in your VCR and let Lerner and  Loewes wonderful score sweep you into a magical time which never existed.  'Camelot' is pure escapism, but it's escapism with 'heart', and that heart  belongs to Richard Harris.  This movie is HIS, and years after first seeing  this movie, when I imagine the face of King Arthur, the face that I see is  Richard Harris'.",963446400,277,1419,4.757201646090535
848350,4,6304331851,"This was a good movie, but at times it became long and tedious, and the watcher just sits there wondering when it will be over. The characters were very appealing, however, and you can connect with them. It is a good  telling of the traditional Arthur story, though, I think, and I would  definitely recommend it to people who enjoy the legends.  Peace out!",954201600,4,357,4.546875
848351,4,6304331851,"In the annals of musical theater, there are more than a few great scores.  Among them is Lerner and Loewe's ""Camelot"" which has more than its share of great songs that shine away from the musical play.

In 1964,  Jack Warner produced ""My Fair Lady"" at Warner Brothers.  It was  an excellent film, if a bit too cautious.  The play was a phenomenon and  Jack didn't want anyone mucking about with it.  Going to see it was almost  as exciting as going to church, even though the film itself was  entertaining and beautiful to look at.

Four years later, Warner attempted  to do the same thing with ""Camelot.""  In many ways he failed,  but in a couple of others he outshone ""My Fair Lady"" and many other fine movie musicals.  First, but not foremost, he enlisted the  talents of John Truscott to design the film.  No medieval tale has ever  benefitted from so fine a vision.  His sets and costumes are among the  finest ever created.  Second, and this is the best  part (for me) -- he acquired the services of the finest composer/conductor  Hollywood has ever produced.  Alfred Newman had already won 8 Academy  Awards prior to scoring ""Camelot.""  Newman was one of a handful  of composers who invented film scoring in the 1930s and 1940s.  As head of  the Fox music department from 1940-1959, Newman had the best orchestrators, best musicians and best composers working for him at Fox than could be  found anywhere else.

For ""Camelot,"" Newman had a free hand,  along with his associate Ken Darby who had worked with Newman for nearly 20  years, collaborating on such film musicals as ""Carousel,""  ""The King and I"" and ""South Pacific.""

The reason I'm  making such a fuss over this -- in addition to the fact that  ""Camelot"" earned Newman his 9th Oscar -- is that  ""Camelot"" rates as one of the best scored musicals in film  history and on this DVD, you can hear the entire musical score, free of  dialogue and solo vocals, in 5.1CH stereo!

What separates  ""Camelot"" from ""My Fair Lady"" is that in the latter,  Warner would not let conductor Andre Previn alter the basic orchestrations  of the play.  Previn had some leeway, and it really shows in the score when  he cuts loose.  By and large, though, this did not include songs....just  musical underscore/transitions.  Newman, on the other hand, virtually  co-composed the entire score.  Using the thematic material, he wrote a dynamic, Erich-Wolfgang-Korngoldian (""Robin Hood,"" ""The Sea  Hawk,"" etc.) underscore that rouses you, thrills you and makes you feel great even if the film drama itself can't quite live up to it.

Watching a film for this isolated score feature alone is something only die-hard music lovers could tolerate, but it's there and can be enjoyed by anyone.  Think of it as a full-orchestra karaoke feature and you can sing your favortie songs backed by one of the finest Hollywood orchestras ever assembled!

I've always been partial to ""Camelot"" for the score, the sets and the luminous presence of Vanessa Redgrave.

In truth,  however, ""Camelot"" never looked as good in its first-run roadshow  performances as it does on this DVD.  This movie shimmers and sparkles and  glows.  It looks absolutely NEW.  The sound does show its age in  spots.

If only Arthur didn't run around all the time calling Guinevere  and Lancelot ""Ginny"" and ""Lance.""  (Lance.  Ginny.  Ginny. Lance.).  That almost ruins the film for me -- that and Arthur's  eccentric blue eye shadow.  And if only Hollywood had not entrusted another great musical into the musically uninspired hands of Joshua Logan (one of Broadway's greatest directors but whose heavy hand all but ruined the film versions of ""South Pacific"", ""Camelot"" and ""Paint Your Wagon."")

It's a whale of a movie.  And the score is one of the finest ever committed to film.",949449600,190,3784,4.790951638065523
848352,5,6304331851,"I absolutely fell in love with this movie from the very first song! Guenivere (Redgrave) is very convincing, as are Arthur (Harris) and Lancelot. Harris is amazing as Athur. One feels all of his pain, his hopes,  his confusion. King Pellinore, Arthers good friend, is a welcome comady  relief. My favorite line? ""How can you get a fair decision from people  so impartial?"" from Pellinore. The songs are generally very lively,  although there are a few beautiful love songs. The costumes and scenery  were amazing! (Keep an eye out for the guys with lots of dark eyeshadow,  and remember, everyone in the movie has blue eyes.) The first time I saw  this movie it climbed the list to one of my favorites.
