8390216,4,B000FVUBRQ,"A wry tale of a gang of inept thieves who steal the wrong thing in a museum heist.  When they realize they've walked away with a Rembrandt they don't know what to do with it.  Naturally, conflicts arise between the four when they try to figure out how to unload it and make some money.  The most amazing part?  It's based on a true story!  This is both funny and suspenseful with wonderful performances by all the ""gang"" members who are really just small-time crooks.  (Their leader specializes in stealing scrap metal.)  If you like off-beat Scandinavian comedies then this is for you.",1425081600,,586,4.631067961165049
