7914707,5,B00001RMGA,"Come on, why all the hate about this? This was a very good Lupin film, I have never in my life been disappointed about any Lupin the 3rd movie. 5 stars",1522195200,,151,3.903225806451613
7914708,1,B00001RMGA,"I wouldn't have thought so much of this is I wasn't already exposed to Lupin III. However, since I grew up watching Lupin on Adult Swim, I have to say that I was downright insulted by this film.

The story is that Lupin and an aging MI6 agent both find themselves chasing a treasure hidden by a thief who stole from British and Japanese troops. Lupin wants it for the thrill, but the agent wants it to pay off his debts after a bridge that was pivotal to his life was mysteriously destroyed. Throw in his daughter, who Lupin is smitten with, and some Neo Nazis and you have the Pursuit of Harimao's Treasure.

For starters, the movie often forsakes animation in lieu of still frames with action lines. The heists, the main draw of Lupin III, are boring. Ohhhh, they scaled the side of a fortress and faced no opposition. Wow. Exciting.

The villains are stupid. VERY stupid. Lupin manages to trick the big bumbling German by saying ""I have the eagle statue"" causing him to take it out and flaunt it in front of him. He shows up three times and never invokes any emotion other than apathy. The main villain, whose big reveal is a main plotpoint and won't be spoiled, is either clever as hell or the most asinine thing in history. And the way they beat him was just hilarious.

The characters are just traits, no longer the interesting, compelling band of thieves. Lupin is eccentric and insanely annoying. Gone is the cunning thief. Now we have a guy who does handstands and laughs like a braying jackass. Jigen can shoot. Goemon has a sword. Fujiko is a sultry femme fatale (which is admittedly the highlight of the movie, seeing her play all three sides against each other). Zenigata likes ramen noodles. He seriously sounds like a four year old. Every single scene involves him talking about ramen. Compelling writing, guys!

SPOILERS RIGHT HERE:

The ending is laughable. It turns out that Harimao's treasure is a submarine made of gold full of more gold. I guess it's more interesting than a big pile of gold. The ending of the movie takes place on it as the villain (a transgendered Nazi) enters the sub with scores of Nazi troops. It seems that they're done for when Fujiko kisses the villain and, I kid you not, he runs away because she has cooties. Lupin takes this advantage to fight all the Nazis who have guns but don't use them. The villain shoots the secret agent in his shoulder and then gets punched in the face by Lupin. Zenigata arrests him (for some reason they made it so that s/he was wanted by ICPO.) The agent realizes death is coming for him and he decides to take the submarine under water while everyone else evacuates. (For some reason, the Nazi troops watch him do this and let it happen.) After all this, Lupin and the gang, plus the agent's daughter, escape on a raft. And the closing to this wonderful adventure is that he asks to hook up with her right after her dad is murdered in front of her eyes.. Lupin was a lech, but he wasn't a bonafide piece of ****.

This movie sucks.",1330387200,,3009,4.4799270072992705
7914709,5,B00001RMGA,"This is the funniest lupin movie ive seen so far. The story is slightly ludicrous, but their are a few fun twists and turns. Harimo's treasure is worth over 8 billion dollars, everyone is looking for it. This time, nothing is going to keep Lupin from stealing it.

As far as the subtitles go, funimation did a excellent job with the english script. If you only watch the japanese version, you miss out on a lot of jokes.",1140912000,,420,4.384615384615385
7914710,1,B00001RMGA,"Pursuit of Harimao's Treasure is never directed by Miyazaki or Takahata.

Do not expect Ghibli's quality in this movie. I hate jigen and goemon's personality in this TV Special series such as",1115683200,3,191,4.96875
7914711,3,B00001RMGA,"Earlier reviews are informative, descriptive, and reasonably accurate.  However, do not expect this to be a film directed by Hayao Miyazaki.  His name does not appear on the credits.  This film does not appear in the filmography in McCarthy's book on Hayao Miyazaki.  And it certainly doesn't look like Miyazaki's work of the last few years.",1112313600,,341,5.035714285714286
7914712,5,B00001RMGA,"First, despite what it may say above Hayao Miyazaki absolutely did NOT direct this film in fact his name doesn't appear anywhere in the credits at all. My understanding is that Miyazaki's experience with Lupin III was limited to `The Castle of Cagliostro' and a few television episodes. Still, `The Pursuit of Harimao's Treasure' is a darn good Lupin flick.

The Eurotunnel linking Britain and France has been destroyed by terrorists and retired British spy Sir Archer is about to be financially ruined. As underwriter for the Lords of London insurance policy on the Eurotunnel, Sir Archer is now responsible for paying the cost of the damage. With the help of Lupin III, Sir Archer embarks on `The Pursuit of Harimao's Treasure' in order to raise the capital to pay the policy and remain disgustingly wealthy. Standing in his way are a group of Neo-Nazi's led by the bizarre Herr Maforditte. Can anyone guess what HER secret might be?

Sir Archer is a pretty blatant homage to James Bond. Although he doesn't resemble Bond they make direct references to films `Goldfinger' and `From Russia With Love'. He even uses a Walther PPK.

`The Pursuit of Harimao's Treasure' is one of the better Lupin III movies. The animation is well done and the scripting is great. One of my favorite parts was when Fujiko was trying to sell Goemon's services to Herr Maforditte and the stoic Goemon starts coughing out `more, more' in order to urge up his hourly wage. This kind of subtle humor is what makes the series and clearly the writers of Harimao `get it'. I really don't have any complaints with the movie and highly recommend it for Lupin fans and Anime fans in general.",1112054400,8,1661,4.760416666666667
7914713,4,B00001RMGA,"This movie was done a year before that hideous ""Twilight Gemini"" and this one is pretty good.  Our boys start out with Lupin stealing some monkey statue.  It turns out that it along with two other statues are the keys to the Harimao's Treasure.
I won't go into the story except to say that it flows fairly nicely.  My girl Fujiko is the smart, sexy, and not to be trusted girl from the original TV series and ""Castle of Cagliostro"".  Excellent!  She's not the ignorant slut of ""Gemini"".  The only character who suffers is Goemon.  For some reason, he needs a job and the money and so he's been hired to help Lupin and company.  Why?  He was always part of the gang before.  I haven't watched the Japanese version yet, so I don't know what liberties have been taken.  However, as I looked this episode up on the net, it seems that Goemon is on the road to enlightenment and needs cash!  OK, I'll bite.
About 1/3 of the way through the film, Goemon disappears and suddenly you think, ""Where's Goemon?!""  He's gone so suddenly and with no explaination that when you notice it, you wonder if you missed something!  But never fear, he'll return, this time hired by Fujiko.
Jigen's character is done OK.  Nothing great, but his skills are used and he's where he should be -- watching Lupin's back!
As for inspector Zenigata, he's mostly a waste here except to pass a nearly endless supply of Japanese ramen noodle (bowls included) jokes.  But then getting him into every episode has to be pretty hard since he is never the bad guy.
Speaking of jokes, there are some good laughs here.  I won't give them away, but I will say to be on the lookout for Lupin's unique parachute storage area!  *lol*  Classic.
As to the DVD itself, we have the English dub which is pretty good.  As of this writing, I haven't compared it to the original Japanese so I don't know how many liberties they took with the translations.  However, FUNimation will soften some jokes and statements in the name of political correctness.  In addition to the English dub, there is the original Japanese version with or without subtitles.  Otherwise, that's about it for extras.
Bottom line:  I enjoyed this movie a lot.  There is some brief animated nudity when Lupin gives away some Japanese porn, but that was the end of it.  The humor is good, the story is pretty good, and the characters are treated well.  Lupin fans: GET THIS DVD!  Anime fans:  I think you will enjoy this movie.",1039392000,13,2446,4.533180778032037
7914714,5,B00001RMGA,"This is a heck of a decent introduction to tying Atlantic Salmon Flies.  Mr. Talleur has made an instructional video for hairwing salmon flies that is both clear and easy to follow.  I was able to tie these with just a few minutes practice.  The materials called for are easily (and cheaply) available (mostly dyed squirrel tail & stretch nylon over classic flosses) a fine, fine work.",1033171200,,385,4.7164179104477615
7914715,5,B00001RMGA,"After watching Secret of Twilight Gemini, I thought that this was a trend Lupin TV specials would be following. Boy, was I wrong. Harimao's Treasure is one of the funnest Lupin features I've seen since Castle of Cagliostro.
The story has Lupin and the gang off on a treasure hunt for the hidden treasure of Harimao, a renegade of World War 2. Lupin, Jigen and Goemon go searching for the three statues to open it while Fujiko gets some info on the treasure from the owner of the British spy mueseum, accompanied by his grandaughter. These two groups eventually cooperate to find the treasure. Add in some Neo Nazis and you've got one heck of an adventure.
The film, in my opinion, was pretty good. It's directed by Osamu Dezaki (Black Jack) and it really shows if you're familiar with his other work. Unlike some of the other features, Lupin's love-interest in this film is one that doesn't quite like him, which makes for some fun antics. One of the funniest gags in this film is that poor Zenigata never actually gets a chance to eat his ramen. That really helps the story.
The music reminded me a lot of the original series. Most of the music in the film is dead on in comparison to original series making it all the more appealing to older fans. Goemon doesn't get as much screen time, but he does manage to impress Lupin a couple of times throughout the feature. Fujiko isn't quite as kick-butt in this feature, but that doesn't mean she isn't willing to take some matters into her own hands. Animation-wise, the film is above average when compared to Gemini, so fans should be happy with that.
The extras aren't really anything special. Just bios on the characters and English voice actors. The menus work perfectly, but the text is so tiny and blurry, you might not even know what your selecting. The packaging is pretty cool and also includes in insert.
Overall, Harimao is a great film I would recommend to World War 2 fans, Bond fans, Dezaki fans and Lupin fans in general. Highly recommended.",1033084800,8,2003,4.597765363128492
7914716,3,B00001RMGA,"This is the second Lupin movie released by Funimation. Since the movie was made around the year 2000, all of the character designs look very modern.
This movie reminded me of Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade. Fujiko is working for the man who inspired the character James Bond. That man is president of an insurance company. Once the Euro tunnel collapses, that man has to come up with the cash to pay for repairs and reconstruction. So, he and his grand daughter with the Lupin gang, go off to Southeast asia to look for some buried treasure. Treasure hunting is a concept that I believe is being overused in the Lupin movies. The entire gang is being followed and chased by a large number of Nazis who are also after the treasure of Harimao... This is a movie that is following the same formula for the same Lupins movies of the past. I would only suggest this movie if you are a die hard Lupin fan.",1032307200,2,903,4.413173652694611
