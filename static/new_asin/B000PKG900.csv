8192211,4,B000PKG900,"I bought this on VHS in high school assuming that it was 70's soft-core pornography.  It isn't.  It is so much better. It is a musical about Purvis moving to the big city and trying to break in the music business and it is hilarious.  A bit tedious at times but still very funny.  The songs are outrageously funny.  ""I know a man that screwed a chicken, thank God that chicken died...""  I wish that the soundtrack was available.
I would like to point out that there are NO TOGAS in the movie.  Not a single one. There is only one scene that could be misconstrued as a ""party.""  The ending is admittedly weak, but who doesn't like a pie fight?  Tell me who?
I would love to find a better print of this film.  Also, I understand that this version has been cut for reasons that we will never know.",1389398400,2,794,4.198675496688741
8192212,1,B000PKG900,I had some doubts about ordering this movie.  Don't bother!  I  frquently get movies with no social redemning value but this doesn't even fit that criteria.  The color is horrible and faded and the sound is so bad that it is nearly unwatchable.  .,1337385600,,247,4.5227272727272725
8192213,3,B000PKG900,"Originally released under the bizarre title ""All Dressed Up In Rubber With No Place To Go"" (as well as the alternate title ""Pelvis""), I saw this insipid comedy at a midnight screening at the 8th Street Playhouse in NYC along with full live litany provided by the original Rocky Horror Picture Show Fan Club.  At the time the litany made entertaining the otherwise pretty dreadful film (tons o'female nudity notwithstanding).  The main reason I acquired the DVD (which sadly still looks like the cheapo 1977 film it was) as to my astonishment, my mother worked background in it and is highly visible (watching the stage magician perform):[...]
The DVD is full screen, not widescreen (meaning my mother's friend Carole got lost from the image), but being full screen helps make this strange feature visible as there has been zero digital clean-up: just a hasty transfer to DVD from its original and colour-fading celluloid.
It hedges between bad enough to be funny (a la MST3K), and just plain bad, but to each their own...",1238803200,,1021,4.895953757225434
