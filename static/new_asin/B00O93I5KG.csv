8682653,5,B00O93I5KG,"I really love this movie. The Trix and Tritannus returns, and the Sirenix fairies have to stop the onslaught from the mysterious abyss under the sea.
This is a pretty good plot here. However, The Mystery of the Abyss was pretty good but I think the 2nd movie (Winx Club 3D: Magical Adventure uncut) was the best in the film franchise because I pretty much am the biggest Believix fan ever. Btw I gotta finish watching this.",1447632000,,423,4.5064935064935066
