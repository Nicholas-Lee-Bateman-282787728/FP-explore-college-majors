3681261,5,B001L68CIE,"I have already learned so much from this DVD. They cover the material in a way that doesn't make me fall asleep. Although the acting is pretty bad, it is still a great learning resource.",1242259200,16,186,4.3428571428571425
3681262,5,B001L68CIE,"This 2 disc dvd did not disappoint.  It gave lots of informative information.  Information on how to adjust mirrors, how to break in emergencies, how far you should be from the steering wheel and on and on.  There are pretests to see what you know.  A word of caution though.  Don't let the beginning turn you off.  It seems like it's going to be a cheesy boring experience at first.  But, once you give it time it's great to help with driving situations.  There's a segment on different types of parking which is nicely shown by student drivers then in graphical animation.  It tells you where you should be looking when driving.  This is helpful so that you'll widen your visual scope.  I would definitely give this to new drivers, old pros, or kids about to get their license.",1236988800,30,779,4.532374100719425

3681284,5,B001L68CIE,Very good for young drivers-to-be and their parents.  This video really is thorough; using it helps keep the tensions down between parents and teens.,1430092800,,149,5.208333333333333

3681286,5,B001L68CIE,"Having no knowledge on how driving works outside of the arcade, I found this video to fill in all the gaps. Vehicular manslaughter was thankfully avoided in large part to the wisdom bestowed by this video. It even covers what to do in the event of brake failure or an ice skid.",1419724800,,277,4.346153846153846
3681287,5,B001L68CIE,Students love this and have bought it for home study...,1419120000,,55,4.6
3681288,1,B001L68CIE,Some of these reviewers are really accurate when they talk about how condescending these videos are towards high school students.  This DVD is so bad I really wonder if the positive reviews weren't left by the owner.  After reviewing these videos for two weeks I asked if I could send them back for a refund and was told there is absolutely no refund policy unless the product is damaged.  This policy obviously came about after almost everyone tried to get their money back I'm sure.,1418169600,,484,4.670588235294118

3681292,5,B001L68CIE,"Although my teen makes me angry, while cutting up as he watches this.  It is very informative and done well. Some things are a bit of a bore, but it helps supplement reading the manuals in a more interesting way.  Also, on the first DVD, it freezes in one spot, but not at a critical part. It still should not freeze though and the DVD has no marks or scratches on it.",1405209600,,368,4.097222222222222
3681303,5,B001L68CIE,Students are able to follow and utilize these videos when trying to pass their test.  Our high school thanked my agency for purchasing for the students that are having much difficulty understanding.,1401667200,,198,5.1875
3681304,4,B001L68CIE,"I was actually on the line for a 5 star but there are some things in the set that I don't completely agree with like numbered lane positions.  Too much info as far as that is concerned.  As far as being a useful tool for new drivers, it's great overall. I especially like the virtual driver and the add-ons that help keep the student interested.",1397174400,,345,4.292307692307692

3681309,5,B001L68CIE,Am a professional driving instructor and use it in every classroom instruction.  Students enjoy the interactive part and ease of understanding.  Only complaint is that the student driving with her mother takes her eyes off the road to look at her mother when talking and driving.  This is distracted driving and my students pick this up every time I show that clip.,1373587200,4,365,4.854838709677419
3681310,1,B001L68CIE,"I bought this DVD and went to the trouble of also purchasing a steering wheel and pedals for my PC because the program is billed as Interactive.  It is not interactive in the sense that you can use it as a driving simulator.  There may be an interactive question/answer section, but it is NOT a simulator program.  What a waste of time!!!  I have to return the wheel and pedals but it's too late to get my money back for the program.  Thanks a lot!",1367193600,3,448,4.223529411764706
3681311,5,B001L68CIE,We own a drivers education business and this DVD really aids in giving students up to date information and instruction. Great tool to have!,1364601600,,139,4.833333333333333
3681312,5,B001L68CIE,We bought this to help our son and to use as part of our homeschooling curriculum.  These DVDs are very informative and contain a lot of material that is beneficial for the student and the teacher :) They also have printable lessons!  Great for the on the road lessons!,1358985600,,269,4.469387755102041
3681323,1,B001L68CIE,"I agree with the previous reviewer that this DVD  does not relate to teens at all. My daughters 17  and 14 were laughing at it. The actors do not act well. It may work better for pre-teens perhaps.
I was also expecting this DVD to provide more in depth information about emergency situations and defensive driving.  Unfortunately, for my family it was a waste of money.",1344297600,3,369,4.5606060606060606
3681324,4,B001L68CIE,A fun dvd set starring teenagers and their parents --- as they point out  parts of the car functions and how to start driving safely and affectively- you also get computer graphic roads to see demonstations,1331164800,,206,4.722222222222222
3681325,3,B001L68CIE,"A 2-disc interactive DVD set, Rules of the Road covers all of the necessary information to pass the written driver's test. The second disc goes over all sorts of important tips dealing with such topics as road rage, auto repair and maintenance, and emergency situations. While it is supposed to be an interactive program, there is only so much real world experience you can get from a video. A great supplement to the teachings of this video is the PC game and drivers education tool, SimuRide Home Edition. My teens use it to practice real life driving situations, using the information they have learned from the videos.",1329436800,6,622,4.822429906542056
3681326,3,B001L68CIE,"Rules of the Road: A Complete Driver's Ed Course is a DVD that offers realistic advice to new drivers. I was looking for something to give my teenage son some added advice and knowledge of what to expect when driving on his own. He laughed at it. It didn't relate to the target audience (teens) well at all. I found that a far more effective drivers education supplement is&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Driving-Simulator-SimuRide-Home-Edition-for-PC/dp/B004COPQPO/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Driving Simulator SimuRide Home Edition for PC</a>, a PC based video game that offers real life driving situations and a simulated driving experience.

3681327,5,B001L68CIE,This is great for new drivers. To many new drivers should no be allowed to drive because they think driving is fun and tey want to see how fast they can go. That is how they get themselfs killed.,1327536000,,195,4.0256410256410255
3681328,5,B001L68CIE,"Teaching Son #1 to drive and I have 4 to follow suit over the years... this DVD covers the basics very well with material that would be hard to do without video. For example there's one lesson about alcohol and they have you young fellow drink 5 or 6 beers, measuring his reaction, cognitive and motor skills. He gets progressively worse, yet all the while he maintains that he is fine to drive. Very dramatic and effective to the young adult.

There were a few lesson or lesson point that I would not have thought of and the DVD was a good reminder.

Overall, I am glad I made this purchase. I am certain to get my money's worth of the next decade or so.  :-)",1320537600,4,660,4.222222222222222
3681329,2,B001L68CIE,"...there is a major flaw in the copy of this video I checked out from my local library.  During the virtual driving test, the car following the driver signals to turn left but when questioned on the test the correct answer is given as the driver was turning right.  This confused me and I reviewed that part three times.  I went to my own mirror and emulated the turn for myself and the video is in error.

Think of it this way, the car trailing behind you is facing the same direction you are, not the opposite direction, ""wysiwyg-what you see is what you get"" in the rearview mirror.",1320192000,4,585,4.339449541284404
3681330,1,B001L68CIE,"These disks are completely worthless because they won't play on any of my three computers or my DVD player. The computers complain the disks are protected by some sort of ""DRM"" and refuse to play, and my DVD player merely blinks and does nothing. Don't waste your money of these worthless disks. Next stop is to find out how to get a refund from Amazon for them.",1283904000,6,362,4.417910447761194
3681331,4,B001L68CIE,I teach adult education and even though this is geared towards teens it has been a helpful tool. It re-emphasises what I teach in the classroom. My classes really enjoyed the Virtual driver and the interactive tests and sign recognition.,1268352000,2,237,4.95
3681332,5,B001L68CIE,I use this in teaching teens how to drive.  It;s used in-class so they know what is expected when they are behind the wheel,1251504000,2,123,4.125

8317423,5,B001L68CIE,The video was very interactive and provided a tremendous amount of insight for someone who has never been behind the wheel of a vehicle before. I feel that the price was very justified for the amount of content and the depth of content provide in this 2-disc DVD set about learning the rules of the road. I could not find any other worth while driving videos to purchase.,1496707200,4,371,4.470588235294118
8317424,5,B001L68CIE,"There are 2 dvds included. Dvd 1 talks about getting to know your car,hitting the road, residential and city driving, driving in hazardous conditions,  and handling vehicle malfunctions. It talks about how to parallel park, when to adjust speed and lane change, keeping a 4 second following distance, not crossing several lanes at once,etc. This is a valuable resource.  I enjoy learning from this dvd. I recommend it to those wanting to learn how to drive.dvd 2-well you'll see it when you buy it.",1496448000,2,498,4.916666666666667
