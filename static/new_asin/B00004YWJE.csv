1378321,5,B00004YWJE,"Fans have waited this moment for years. We can buy The Complete Buffy's First Season at last. All the 12 episodes are more then worth the price.
Sara Michelle Galler, Angel's introduction in ""Angel"", the pilot episode ""Welcome to Hellmouth"", The grate villain The Master (the eldest and strongest vampire of them all), and a lot more inside this 3 disc set. It seems to have good bonus features, and did I mentioned Sara Michele Galler?. Definitely the best TV series after Dark Angel. It has it all, drama, comedy, love stories, action, Sara Michelle Galler kicking the you know what out of the vampires and demons, an amazing writing work (my own personal opinion is that Buffy has one of the best script works in TV production).
Every episode without any exception is smart, funny and every actor and actress give their best performance. The adolescence parody that Buffy the Vampire slayer offers is more then accurate for those who understand it. I'm most interested in the Joss Whedon Commentary, I really want to hear his perspective on the interviews about the episodes ""Hellmouth,"" ""The Harvest,"" ""Witch,"" ""Never Kill a Boy on the First Date,"" ""Angel"" and ""Puppet Show"".
I think I don't have to say much, ""it's Buffy"" after all, and the name says it all. Finally fans are rewarded for their patience. I just hope season 2, 3, 4, and 5 don't take to long.",1001635200,,1363,4.73109243697479
1378322,5,B00004YWJE,"It's hard to beat Buffy. Now in its sixth season, this series has proven time and again to be one of the best acted, superbly written and well directed drama series of all time.
Finally, fans have a chance to acquire the show on DVD, complete with commentaries from show creator Joss Whedon. Available in Britain for some time, this DVD has been delayed reportedly due to a conflict with the cable network FX, which has just started broadcasting the series in syndication.
For non-Buffy fans, this collection of DVDs is where you start. For Buffy fans, seriously, how can you resist?
The show starts with one of the better premieres of any program, ""Welcome to the Hellmouth"" and ""The Harvest"" -- two excellent episodes that introduce Buffy and her loyal companions Xander and Willow, and blow away any comparison to the mediocre movie.
I won't argue that this is Buffy's best season, mostly because it is a show that gets constantly better. And other seasons, like the second and third, have better villains. But this DVD showcases a great start, and lays the groundwork for everything to come.
Included in the DVD is ""Angel"" which explains the origins of Buffy's true love, and ""Nightmares,"" where everyone's worst fear is realized (and a killer of an episode not least for Buffy's nightmare -- turning into a vampire herself). Last but not least is ""Prophecy Girl,"" where an ancient prophecy reveals that Buffy is fated to die in her war against the Master.
And the show's start even reveals tidbits of information not fully explored until later episodes, and other series. Note that Darla -- Angel's sire and original bad girl of Sunnydale -- gets her start in the first season. Upon seeing her, Angel remarks, ""The last time I saw you, you were wearing kimonos."" Later episodes of Buffy's spinoff series, Angel, show that very scene, where she is indeed in a kimono.
Its a nice change from other series, which forget the background comments as soon as they are spoken.
Its impossible to say enough great things about the series. I don't watch that much TV, but everyone I've introduced this show has been hooked.
I wholeheartedly recommend that you purchase these DVDs and experience the show for yourself. Buy it for a friend at Christmas, or just take it home yourself -- you won't be sorry.",1001635200,7,2298,4.776381909547739
1378323,5,B00004YWJE,"I think that Buffy is the best show on TV and i'm glad that it's being released on DVD. The show has humor, action, better drama than any other show and did I mention that Buffy is hot.
 When I first heard about the show I thought that it would [stink] after having seen the movie but it only took 1 episode for it to not only change my mind but for it to become my favorite show. The problem with most shows is that they just focus on one thing and because of that they become tired within A couple of seasons. This show is always great fun and it does not hesitate to make fun of its self.
 I'm glad that the DVD's are coming with alot of cool features it would have been disapointing if all they had were just the episodes. Long live Buffy",1001635200,,742,4.006756756756757

1378325,5,B00004YWJE,"Ok, should I even bother in saying that ""Buffy"" is the best tv show? Anyway, even though I love it, I must admit that I liked it better the first two seasons, for after that, it became kind of too complex and maybe lost a little it's similarity with high school. Anyway, that's why it's great that they're selling the ENTIRE FIRST SEASON ( which to me it's the best and it's a classic) just in time for Christmas. Well, not really, but very close to Christmas. Re-live the laughter, the fun, the horror and the charm of Buffy's first season, where Willow still was insecure and nerdy, Xander was still hilarious and dorky; Giles had more screen time, and Buffy had a natural color hair and apple bossom cheeks, and Angel and Cordelia were still here. See how it all started! What I mean, is that you SIMPLY CAN'T DECIDE NOT TO BUY THIS It's simply great. Joss Whedon, the series creator is extraordinarily a genius and as I said, Buffy is the best tv show ever. I dont'know if you will ever find something like this again, it's too good to be true",974246400,,1047,4.374358974358974
1378326,5,B00004YWJE,"This show is a pinnacle of quality in both writing and production. To see the difference between where the show is now versus where it was then, the box set does wonders.
Joss Whedon(Toy Story, Speed, Alien Ressurrection) has reclaimed his movie story for Buffy and revitalized it as a series of relevance and entertainment. This boxed set & the price are nice.",973555200,,361,4.746031746031746
1378327,5,B00004YWJE,"For a first time screenwriter, Joss Whedon's ""Buffy the Vampire Slayer"" was a good effort for a feature film. I thought for sure the series was going to tank. When I started watching halfway through the first season, I quickly found that I was wrong.  ""Buffy"" simply blossoms on television. I've been hooked ever since.
For the first time, Whedon has provided us with all the terrors of high school (remember those?) in a horror genre setting. Not only that, but he provides a confident, cool FEMALE character to trounce the bad guys. Whether you're a fan of the genre or a teenage feminist, Buffy (Sarah Michelle Gellar) provides a niche for the unpopular misfits in high school, but looks upon them as heroes. Were you as uncomfortable as Xander (Nicholas Brendon)? As geeky as Willow (Alyson Hannigan)? As quick with an aphorism as Oz (Seth Green)? The series proves that high school is indeed survivable no matter who you are, even if you're cliquish Cordelia (Charisma Carpenter). And in the end, the more unpopular you were - possibly the more important you were to your teenage community.
Mix in your favorite teacher (or librarian) played by Anthony Stewart Head (who should play ""Doctor Who"" after he's done with ""Buffy"") to be the requisite horror genre British pseudo-scientist, and Buffy's single mom (Kristine Sutherland)  and you're all set to go with the most intelligent sci-fi TV series possibly written for this age group. (The next closest thing being the intelligent, yet non-sf ""Freaks & Geeks"".)
I'm not kidding. It's amazing how quickly these characters grow in the first season and their responses remain true to life despite the extraordinary situations they're thrown into. Creator Joss Whedon has become one of the most talented writer/directors working in the industry today, despite the fact that ""Buffy"" is most of what he's been doing for the last five years.
As far as what you get in this box set, you're in for a treat. This is the full first season, not just the half previously released on VHS; including the season finale ""Prophecy Girl"" - where we see just how heroic Buffy really is, despite her adolescence and fear of death. Also present throughout the series are teenage issues of emotional/sexual conflict (""Teacher's Pet"") and problems with acceptance (""The Pack""). Specific highlights also include Whedon's commentary for the two part premiere as well as the first appearances of Angel (David Boreanaz) and Jenny Calendar (Robia LaMorte).
Remember, Buffy's not JUST about vampires. In fact I think it's safe to say that vampires are secondary to the emotional undercurrent of the show, if not a particular episode's plot. Forget ""Felicity"" and shove off of ""Dawson's Creek"", this is the one for the adults.",973555200,594,2751,4.991285403050109
1378328,5,B00004YWJE,"Buffy has to be one of the best written show on television...and to be able to watch the whole first season on dvd is tremendous! Unfortunately, suffering from it's own name, people tend not to give it the chance that it deserves.  Trust me...this is definitely one to check out!
It's rare to see such a talented cast of actors together in an intelligently scripted storyline.  Kudos to the creator, Joss Whedon for taking his Hollywood-botched movie, and transforming it into the serious drama/horror/action/comedy that he intended it to be.
This is where it all starts.  I can't say that the first season is the best of the Buffy series, but it's definitely better than most shows out there.  From the first episode, BTVS has shown a steady rise in plot and drama, while always keeping a lighthearted twist.  You can see the cast gel together...and when the first season is finished, you'll find yourself wanting more.
The moral of the story: Give the show a chance! After watching a few episodes of the first season, most people find themselves pleasantly surprised.  Not hooked...but pleasantly surpised.  You'll have to wait until season two for that...",973382400,15,1158,4.907692307692308
1378329,5,B00004YWJE,Favorite show of all time! I even named my daughter Willow.,1504828800,,59,4.454545454545454

1378332,5,B00004YWJE,"I've enjoyed--I admire--""Buffy the Vampire Slayer"" more than anything I've ever seen from television.

I was slow getting around to ""Buffy.""  It sounded too silly (cheerleader? vampire slayer? really?) to be worth watching.  That was until I took my teenage kids to see ""The Avengers""--eight times, and I confess the last three were my idea.  It was the quality of the performances (directing and acting), and even more than that the script, which never condescended to its audience, and the obsessive attention to quality, for which no detail was too small, that kept me coming back.  I admire artists who have the self-confidence to take ""escapist"" forms seriously, by which I mean not that they hang them with Ingmar-Bergman-style crepe (I'm talking about you, DC), but that they are willing to give them every measure of their skill, intelligence and commitment, without apology or reserve.  With ""The Avengers,"" Joss Whedon won my admiration for all that and more.  So when the much-earlier Buffy (his first major project) showed up on Prime, I gave it a try.

I'd never binge-watched anything in my life (who has the time, right?).  I was a little surprised, then, to find myself streaming Seasons 1 through 7 every moment I could find until several weeks later, when I reached the end of Season 7.  And started all over again.

That was a couple of years ago.  I recently went through the whole series again, and find myself having to pay homage to Whedon's extraordinary achievement.  It's extraordinary for being his first major project.  It's extraordinary because he manages to elevate a premise as silly as ""Buffy the Vampire Slayer"" to a level of narrative complexity, emotional power, and conceptual depth that places it above anything I've ever seen on television, and above most feature films as well.  The time I've spent watching ""Buffy"" is simply the most rewarding I've spent in front of a small screen.

What is it about ""Buffy"" that has me raving this way?  It's difficult to do it justice without spoiling the plot or just becoming a bore, but here are a few things that come to mind.  First, there's that seriousness thing.  In a medium where success too often demands the least effort necessary to attract the least common denominator, Whedon's whole-hearted commitment (along with the rest of the cast and crew) makes ""Buffy"" by turns moving, thrilling, thought-provoking, memorable, and consistently hilarious.  That's another thing I like about it: for all his commitment, Whedon keeps the plot and dialog consistently funny, in a way that never undercuts the emotional impact of the story.  The writing--dialog, characterizations, plotting--is so good that it keeps you riveted even when the material is just ludicrously goofy: in Whedon's hands, goofy becomes art, and as the narrative arc bends toward Big and Important Questions, Buffy reaches toward the sublime.  Whedon does things with that narrative arc--twists it and bends it--that are so daring, so breathtakingly imaginative, that you would think you were watching the work of a seasoned craftsman at the top of his form.  OK, there is perhaps one season where the goofiness of the premise burdens the story perhaps a little more than it should, but even at its weakest the story never loses sight of where it's going.  The progression from beginning to end is skillfully controlled, assured, and in the end overwhelmingly powerful.  The characterizations--writing, direction, performance--especially Buffy and Spike, but the entire cast (with perhaps one exception, a lapse in casting that does not last through the series), are consistently convincing at the level of ""I know that person.""  Or ""I wish I knew that person.""  The characters are so good that, after you finish the last episode, you miss having them in your life.  Finally, I mentioned Big and Important Questions.  A lot of film and video offerings address questions of moral responsibility, duty, mortality, what it means to be human.  Whedon attacks these and more--and the complex relations among them--with the honesty, energy and intelligence they deserve.  And rather than being some kind of decorative intellectual bric-a-brac, these questions arise inevitably from the unfolding of the story, and are a crucial part of the emotional matrix that makes this series so deeply memorable.

If you haven't seen ""Buffy,"" if, like me, you dismissed it simply because the premise is (and it really is) so completely silly, give it a try.  You won't regret a minute of it.  Except, of course, that it has to end.",1493078400,5,4566,5.060160427807487

1378337,4,B00004YWJE,"I wasn't interested in this series when it originated. But I was bored the other night and purchased Season 1; I'm halfway through the season.

The nostalgia is a guilty pleasure. The series doesn't age well, however, in the sense that Buffy is young and attractive, and barely wearing any skirts or pants, while under the tutelage of handsome British ""watcher"" Giles. The series is definitely pre-9/11 (the Patriot Act, the NSA, cameras EVERYWHERE, social media 24/7, et al).

But - I'm enjoying the show. I like the camaraderie with the main characters, you can already FEEL the chemistry between Buffy and Angel, and it's been nice to lie in bed and watch something far better written than what is actually on nowadays.",1485129600,,722,4.861788617886178

1378422,2,B00004YWJE,"High school girl lives in a town where vampires and eventually demons show up CONSTANTLY. She finds out through the school librarian she is a ""slayer"" which translates into the ""chosen one"" to fight and kill them. She does.

While the first season of this show (and this represents my feelings on all of them) was tolerable, the rest of the seasons were just confusion--successful betrayals of the original purpose of the show set up in the first season. The first season was a show about good and evil and the heroine on the good side. As the seasons passed what was good and evil in this series was grayed. I'm sure it is no coincidence that the creator is a self-declared atheist who claims one reason he support Obama in 2012 was because he felt Romney's ideas would cause all things race riots. LOL (I have yet to read where he admitted he was completely wrong in supporting Obama for the riots Obama created since being elected in 2012.) Anyway, the show started showing witchcraft as good, wicca, ""good demons"", even the heroine being promiscuous as some right of passage into American adulthood, the heroine sleeping with demons and vampires, etc. It was just filth and disgusting. It just tries to water down wrong to make it right. Just confusion on the small screen by confused people.

Also there were the typical attempts at liberal moralizing with shows on current events. I guess they cannot help themselves.

I remember this show being on TV (first run) back in the 1990s. I used to roll my eyes at what those wannabe networks were trying to sell--WB, Fox, etc. This show seemed back then as such nonsense. All these years later I am vindicated. I watched. It is just stupidity.",1450396800,,1694,4.65886287625418

The only problem is that in the description it states that it comes dubbed in spanish, which is one of the main reasons I got it. So I can watch it with my grandmama as well. It is not. It has spanish sub-titles but no spanish dubbing. Which makes it a little more difficult for my grandmama to watch because reading text on a screen gives her a headache. But, she enjoys watching Buffy the Vampire Slayer none the less. All in all, a great purchase.",1448582400,,588,4.306306306306307

It was the first season, however, so this can all be forgiven. As a fan of the show I grew to love this season over the years because from the perspective of someone who has seen the entire show unfold, it can be a lot of fun to watch. Also, the heart of the show is very present in the writing and the chemistry of the cast. For the sake of nostalgia I give this five stars.

I am going to have to go over the box sets I have for all season to see the changes.  Although, I know I didn't like the darker 16mm version for season 1.",1435276800,,424,3.895348837209302

Each episode, particularly in the first few seasons, deals with a major problem in society today. Whether that means bullying (""Out of Sight, Out of Mind,"" a girl literally becomes invisible because she was ignored, which is a type of bullying), the dangers of sex before you/your relationship is ready for it (pretty much the entire last half of season two, beginning with ""Surprise"" and ""Innocence""), the dangers of online dating (""I Robot, You Jane,"" where the person on the other end of the computer screen isn't quite what was bargained for), or the fact that a someone is planning to set up a gun somewhere and start shooting up the school (""Earshot,"" Buffy gains the ability to hears the thoughts of others), there is much more going on in this show than just a girl that beats up the things that go bump in the night. This is part of the reason why the show has such a deeply devoted following, even after having been off air for nearly twelve years, and continues to be relevant to this day regarding the issues it talks about.",1426377600,2,1230,4.545045045045045

They say they want to redo this show, but nothing has come of it. How could you ever top the original? You couldn't.  Even though the effects would be better than they could do in 1996, the stories and acting was top notch.

1378648,5,B00004YWJE,"Buffy the Vampire Slayer is one of my favorite shows in the history of television - so it's not like I'm biased or anything. It has everything you could ask for out of a TV show - action, romance, drama, comedy, and at times poignant life lessons. Oh, and it has tons of vampires and demons, which puts it heads and shoulders and various unnatural bodyparts ahead of most of the rest of other shows that promise all that Buffy offers, but fail.
Most of the show revolves around the title character Buffy Summers, who is the Slayer, the Chosen One who kills vampires and fights off the forces of evil. Even though the subject matter is good vs. evil and humans vs. demons, the show approaches religious matters at a slant. The characters act based on moral grounds, not religious dogma, and this gives the show a lot of freedom to explore a blurred, fuzzy line between what Good really is, and what Evil really is.
Frequently the show will throw in a Life Lesson episode, such as what it means to be true friends, or the importance of self-sacrifice. Thankfully, these episodes are counter-balanced by a number of purely spoofy and just outright fun episodes, such as when all the adults in town revert to their teenage personas, or when the entire cast of the show breaks into song. There's something to learn from every episode, however, and that's something that makes Buffy the Vampire Slayer an instant classic in my eyes.",1425081600,,1426,4.618110236220472

The best part?  ""Oh, what was that?""  No problem.  Click, pause, scroll back and see that part again.  Yeah, baby.  One of the gems I caught this time around was the Nightmares episode where Cordelia was being dragged into the Chess Club meeting screaming bloody murder.

1378714,4,B00004YWJE,"Buffy the Vampire Slayer is, in my opinion, the best television show ever created. The ensemble cast was exceptional, the writing inventive, engaging and often, very witty.  The mixture of horror, humor, teen angst, drama and action was generally smart and original and the show was punctuated with interesting music, pop culture references, and some of the best-choreographed fight sequences seen on a weekly TV show.  Much has been written about the story line so I won't bother trying to create a synopsis here but will simply observe that the central character of Buffy, a young teen girl following her destiny as the Slayer, the chosen one, working to protect mankind from all manner of demons and evil balances the story of a strong young woman with purpose and a sense of duty against the life of a typical teen, worried about acceptance, popularity, love, and trying to enjoy her life.  The stories could vary anywhere from tense thrillers to poignant tales of the awkward pilgrimage of youth.  Each season contained both the individual story lines of the episodes as well as a larger story arc over the whole season (or more) which allowed the characters and story line to grow  and mature.  I have watched the episodes multiple times and each time marvel at what a special experience this series represented compared to the typical sit-coms, cop shows, and soap operas which populated the TV landscape.

So, if I'm so enamoured of the show, why did I give it only four stars. The answer is that, while I wouldn't recommend skipping the first two seasons, in my opinion, the show only really came into its own in the third season.  The episodes of the first couple seasons were much more uneven than the latter seasons (though, every season had the occasional clinker) and some of the plots were simply ludicrous.  The good news is that even when the plots ran off the rails, the dialog and character development were often more than enough to compensate.  (very mild spoilers ahead) This season included such gems as teacher who was actually a giant praying mantis; students transformed by hyenas at the zoo into a murderous pack; and an ancient demon downloaded into the internet and finally coming to reside in a robot fashioned in the demon's original image.  Faced with plots like those I can imagine that it might seem unlikely that anything about the show could redeem it, but believe me, it could and it did.  Over it's seven seasons, there were also plots which were phenomenal, unique and even daring and the characters grew to be complex and rich.  During its original run on TV, waiting for next week's episode often seemed like an eternity to me.  So, if you are moved to try it and you, too, have some difficulty with some of the plots, keep an open mind at least through the first two seasons.  I loved the show but still roll my eyes at some of the early episodes, however, when I think of what is to come any such flaws fade into the background.",1410393600,,2971,4.697495183044316

The first season is quite possibly the weakest of the 7, but it's still not to be missed. It introduces the premise of the series as well as the main characters and it sets the foundations for storylines to come in later seasons. There are only 12 episodes in season 1 so it's relatively quick to get through and has more of a monster-of-the-week feel than the rest of the seasons, but there is still a lot of fun to be had in viewing it.",1409270400,,566,4.017699115044247

Some story-lines could be construed as ""disturbing"" but you're watching a show about vampires and demons, so.... Besides that, there is extremely witty reparte, a few laughs, some surprises, and a whole lot of friendship going on.  You really need to pay attention since the details of the shows are outstanding.  And watching a little blonde girl save the world week after week after week after week is pretty darned awesome.",1405036800,,551,4.956521739130435

The special fx are terrible. The acting is rough. The plots are unselfconsciously melodramatic. I started on Buffy after having seen the Avengers and about halfway through had to stop and call the friend who recommended it and ask, ""Why the hell am I watching this?"" (I believe that was around the bug teacher episode.) But here and there I caught flashes of the brilliant character interaction that would later become the staple of the show.

And then the finale had a few moments where the pure potential of the show shined brightly through.
""Giles I'm 16 years old.""

Stick with it. The first season is awful and I didn't get properly hooked until partway through season 2, but then Buffy became my favorite show of all time. It's worth the pain of the early episodes.

1378749,4,B00004YWJE,"Buffy embodies what being a teenager is all about. Even though she is the Slayer, she is still the quintessential teenager with all the angst and parental disapproval. She was after all thrown out of her last school and blamed for burning down the gym. She has the heart of a loving daughter and the bravado of a superhero. Her ""loser"" friends are fiercely loyal and Willow and Xander are no less brave when it comes to battling monsters.

1378751,5,B00004YWJE,"I have not seen Buffy the Vampire in years, I just finished the first season a couple days ago and I LOVED it! This show is still superb as I had thought it was when I was a kid, this show is an absolute blast of fun, action, horror, humor, romance, drama, and everything a good show have, great heroes, likable, several great monsters/villains, this show is thankfully not just a vampire show, which is why it is so fun and easy to watch, because, lets face it, the vampire genre was drained of its blood decades before this show even came into play, but this show revived it for its duration of its run. I HIGHLY, HIGHLY, HIGHLY recommend Buffy the Vampire Slayer, enough of this Twilight garbage we've had going on these days and these overly sappy vampires and stupid cheesiness, at least Buffy the Vampire Slayer had the ability to make fun of itself and point out the obvious and did not take itself seriously, which is more than I can say for most shows in general these days. The humor made this show so unique, it was not overly graphic in violence or sexual content, and never got boring, it is, has been, and always will be a classic and a show that still has a lot of soul, a lot of heart, and life, and very much has fresh blood coursing through its veins.

My favorite episodes of season 1 are:

The Pack
Teacher's Pet

I don't really like joss whedons personal views very much, but he is by far the best producer of entertainment that exists right now.  Angel, firefly, dollhouse, and all his other projects are excellent too.  The only one i didn't care for was dr horrible and thats only because i don't really like musicals that much.

I'm pretty sure I watched the first episode no less than three times before finally buckling in and watching the entire season. In the end, season one is a decent, if not goofy, introduction to Buffy and her high school gang who work to protect the innocent, clueless citizens of Sunnydale. As one would expect from Joss Whedon, there's plenty of humor. The bad guys are not always vampires, but almost always arrogant and not so bright. The episodes are, for the most part, stand alone, so if you miss one you won't be left in the dark, which is pretty unique in television these days where every show seems to be serialized. The season is a short one, so if you're set on joining the millions of Buffy fans, grab some popcorn and a rainy Saturday and get season one under your belt.",1402704000,,868,4.39751552795031

1378759,5,B00004YWJE,"I thought this would be ""902010"" with monsters. I dug the movie, and thought it could have been a lot more. That it was hinting at something subversive and cool, and would turn the genre--and how women are seen in modern media--on its head. Little did I know that the show would deliver on all those hopes I had for the movie.

It can get a little too ""X-files"" monster-of-the-week, but wanting to pattern it off a successful show isn't bad. But where it really shined, is the arcs, the bigger mythology of its own series, the continuing stories, and the characters themselves. You can see all those seeds that made the rest of the series so good planted here.

This version on the live streaming seems way more crisp than on the DVDs that I bought a while back.",1402358400,,762,4.435714285714286

I don't know if I am just spoiled with shows like ""The Walking Dead"" and the new ""Teen Wolf"" but I am certainly willing to try another season to see if it gets better. I am guessing it has to get better or why else could it make all those lists. Personally I did not think the acting was very good on season one, and my biggest pet peeve, it is only one season, and seriously how many murders, attacks, and craziness can go on at a public school and it not get shut down??? I grew up in the 80's so I understand about not having money for lots of sets but honestly I am getting tired of only seeing one hang out place for the teens, a cave for the vampires, Buffy's home, and the rest of the time at the school. The main reason I started this show was trying to find a nice series I could watch with my twelve year old son together.

I originally resisted because I didn't want to watch a show about high school, but this is so much more.

I find myself wanting to binge-watch it even though I've seen all of it before. It's that good, and that satisfying. There are hints, even in the very first episodes, of the incredible richness yet to come....",1395360000,,648,4.684210526315789

1378809,5,B00004YWJE,"I do not watch much TV. I do, however, love a good show. This is not a good show. This is, as my title suggests, a Masterpiece. When Buffy was relevant on TV, I was in elementary and middle school and still as uninterested in TV as I am now. Of course I had heard of the show, knew what it was about, knew people who watched it, and had even seen a clip or two on TV in passing. But it did not catch my interest. Fast forward ten or so years. I was a twenty-something who was introduced to the Buffyverse through an old roommate. Was it love at first sight? No, but it grew on me. And when it did, it hit me hard, and I was (and still am) hooked. What makes this show so great? What makes me want to watch it over and over again (as many people close to me ask, questioning my sanity in the process)? Let me tell you.

1. Characters. Every single character in this series is fleshed out and has a story. There is not a single character in this series that I do not enjoy. These characters feel like real people, like you could bump into them on the street. You laugh with them (and at them), cry with them, and cheer for them. They feel like people you know; like friends. You watch them grow and develop. You watch their happiest moments and their deepest sorrows. These characters are alive, and their emotions and actions feel believable. Nothing they do seems unnatural, flat, or forced. This show has some of the best and most well-loved characters of all time.

2. This show spans and encompasses almost every genre. Comedy? Check. Action? Check. Supernatural? Check. Horror? Check. Romance? Check. Drama? Check. Musical? Check. Sci-Fi? Check. I could go on, but you get the point. And what's even better is, this show pulls off every single one flawlessly. Not many shows or movies can boast such an ability.

With all that said, let's get down to the nitty-gritty: Season One. It has twelve episodes and is a short but sweet introduction to Buffy's world.

Buffy Summers is your average sixteen-year-old girl who loves clothes, cheerleading, and boys. Except for that one minor incident: she got kicked out of school. Why? Because she's a vampire slayer, and she 'accidentally' burnt down the school gym. She and her mother Joyce have just moved from LA to small town Sunnydale, California so that both can start fresh with new lives. Buffy has sworn to put her slayer days behind her and be a normal teenager...or so she thought. Immediately after moving, Buffy is sucked into fighting demons and vampires again, for Sunnydale is on a Hellmouth; an underworld dimension that attracts swarms of vampires, demons, and other supernatural forces and occurrences. Through it all, she makes a rag-tag group of friends:

Xander Harris, the unpopular version of the class clown;

Willow Rosenberg, a shy, self-proclaimed computer whiz and academic goddess who is seen by many of her classmates as a loser or a nerd;

Rupert Giles, the pompous, British school librarian who also happens to be Buffy's watcher (guide/teacher).

These four make up the Scooby Gang (Scoobies) as they are affectionately called, and together they help to take down each season's 'Big Bad'. Season One's happens to be an ancient, feral-looking vampire entitled the Master who wishes to take over Sunnydale and ensure that vampires rule the world once more.

Other central characters that are introduced in this season are:

Angel, a brooding but handsome tortured vampire with a soul, and

Cordelia Chase, Queen B of Sunnydale high and one of the more popular girls in the school. She looks down upon Buffy and the Scoobies, proclaiming them 'weirdos', but oftentimes winds up being their ally (although somewhat begrudgingly).

Sounds good right? However, this season does have it's weaknesses. It is arguably the weakest of the seven seasons of Buffy, partly because it only has 12 episodes and partly because it is dated and some episodes are horribly cheesy. If you find yourself cringing unbelievably at some of the episode plots, keep going, because seasons 2-7 are much more mature and emotionally involved. The strength that this season does have is that, even though some episodes are cringe-worthy, each one delves upon well-known adolescent and high school issues, which most people can appreciate. I particularly enjoy re-watching this season because now that I know what these characters ultimately become, it is fun to watch them just starting out as misfits.

My ranking: 7th out of 7 seasons

Favorite episodes:

Welcome to the Hellmouth: A strong series premiere that successfully introduces Buffy and her world, as well as all of the central characters.

The Pack: A cheesy but hilarious episode about Xander falling in with the wrong crowd, who inevitably all get possessed by the spirits of hyenas.

I Robot, You Jane: Willow is my favorite character, and in this episode we see a glimpse of her inner strength and how powerful she can be.

Prophecy Girl: The season finale, in which Sarah Michelle Gellar delivers a stellar and heart-wrenching performance about facing death at only sixteen years old.

Least favorite episode:

I really do enjoy every episode in this season, but if I had to choose, I would say Never Kill a Boy on the First Date is probably the weakest. It's plot is nothing outstanding, and it focuses mainly on introducing the Anointed One, who, for making such a fuss over, really has no purpose for the rest of the show.",1391644800,,5441,4.768085106382979

1378835,5,B00004YWJE,"It's hard for me to be even remotely objective when judging this show, since I love it so much.  It's an almost perfect mix of horror, humor, teen-angst, razor-sharp wit and clever dialogue.  This show really hits it's stride in season 2, and never slows down, but season 1 is worth watching to see how it all began.  But even in these early episodes, Joss Whedon's trademark wit and eye for detail can be evidenced.  He loves to take every tired clich and turn it on it's head, and then mock the clich that he's putting his unique twist on.  You almost have to watch to understand it, however.

But, reviewing this at the tail-end of 2013, and looking back, I can see now that some of it is a little bit dated.  The video quality, especially in Season 1 can look a little grainy, compared to the gorgeous HDTV we are all accustomed to nowadays.  The show is definitely set in the late 90's, early 2000's, so the music, clothing and hairstyles probably don't look current (I wouldn't know, since I'm notoriously clueless when it comes to fashion -- just ask my wife, she'll happily agree.) There are little things that look odd to me now, like, why does no one have a cell phone? But this was filmed right before cell-phones became ubiquitous.

Still, don't let such minor quibbles deter you.  If you like intelligent horror, strong female leads, clever dialogue, and witty humor, then you've come to the right place.  Welcome to the Buffyverse.",1385683200,,1445,4.583657587548638

Sadly, this shows never gets off the ground.  We kept hoping, but every season was as dumb as the one before it.  We noticed, as well, that the only characters who grew had left this two dimensional show and moved to Angel.  Cordelia,  Wesley, and Spike were flat and forced until they moved to Angel and got rounded out, becoming more complex and real.  Since the actors obviously have potential, it must be the writing and directing that is so pathetic in this show.

At one point, Xander disapproves of Willow's addiction to witchcraft and her intent to use for revenge, by saying that part of life is to accept that the universe doesn't always function according to your perceived needs and that he thought it a bad idea to reach to forces that don't intend to do us any good to get what the universe thinks you shouldn't have.  One truly profound comment in a sea of juvenile flatness.  I wish the show and our culture made more of that.  Forget magic, when we reach for anger, for example, to give us power, we are all doing what Willow did, reaching for a destructive force to get our way and finding that, just like magic took over and nearly consumed Willow, anger or selfishness, or anything destructive, in the end, is not ruled by us, but takes over and leads those who use it to their own eventual ruin.

Buffy goes up against more than just vampires though, all manner of monsters and things which go bump in the night seem to show up and we learn the ONE TRUTH of this great 90s show - where Buffy is, trouble soon follows.

Joss Whedon's characteristic wit and macabre sense of humor shine through this early work and its plain to see he was headed to super Hollywood recognition - his talents can be seen in later works such as Firefly (the little science-fiction show that wouldn't die despite being cancelled) and on the big screen in The Avengers (which pulled in $1.5 BILLION dollars, ya, I guess that did ok).

1378884,4,B00004YWJE,"Buffy Somers, High School student by day, vampire slayer by night.  A young girl struggling with her identity, striving to make new friends in a new school, only child, parents divorced, in many ways a typical teen.  And then there's that whole, ""the chosen one. the vampire slayer,"" thing, the one thing in her life she has no control over.  Not that High School is a time when young persons have much control in their lives, but, for Buffy, it seems at times as if she has nothing at all she has control over.  Having recently watched seasons 1 and 2 in order, my own sort of mini-Buffy-a-thon, I can offer that there is a lot more to this series than vampires, werewolves, demons, witchcraft, although there is plenty of that, there's also the story of Buffy herself, how she copes with the pressures that seem at times to overwhelm her.

There is more to this series than slaying vampires and demons, there are the eternal questions of love, life, friendship, and the boundaries and bonds that tie them all together.  True, you have to take the story lines seriously, you have to get a little caught up in the intricacies of the various plot threads, and you have to care about the characters in order to enjoy watching this series.  Fortunately, Joss Whedon, the shows creator, never leaves you much time to linger on any one aspect of any episode, instead, he creates an alternative reality that includes all sorts of supernatural beings and occurrences that are loosely wrapped around Buffy growing up amid all the turmoil.  Whedon also created a wonderful panoply of supporting characters, that add some spice to the whole mix.  All in all, I believe that if you will give yourself enough time to watch the first three or four episodes in a row, you'll be hooked.

Warning:  don't be to upset when some characters you really like end up being killed off...after all, it's a harsh World out there.",1375228800,,1904,4.6537313432835825

1378900,3,B00004YWJE,"Before I bought this DVD set I knew very little about Buffy the Vampire Slayer. I heard it mentioned from time to time but never caught it on television - I grew up being more of a ""Sabrina the Teenage Witch"" girl. In a way, I am very glad that I did not get into this series until recently. Now that I am older, I can watch a program for it's depth and messages instead of the bubblegum appeal.

When I picked up the case I was really drawn into the beautiful cover art and thought it would be worth a watch. While I was expecting something very compelling from the start, I was very surprised. This season of Buffy is not nearly up to notch with the next ones to come. Some of the acting is a little shaky, the majority of the episodes involve dumb throwaway plots and monsters, and it just comes off as corny at times. Episodes like Puppet Show and I Robot, You Jane have overused and uninteresting plots. No one was really expanding their mind for these stories. I did enjoy the filler episode, Out of Sight, Out of Mind, and found it to be somewhat interesting and useful for the next season considering that Cordelia will become more of a main character in the next 2 seasons.

The format of this really reminds me of the cartoon Sailor Moon. A beautiful but somewhat ditzy young girl is called upon to fight evil and every episode deals with a monster of the day leading up to the main evil who must be fought in the final episode. The majority of these episodes are hard to get through and full of silly story lines. But what kept me watching was the witty dialogue and two stand out episodes, Angel and Prophecy Girl. They really point towards something that could turn special and could easily slide into the Season 2 episode pile! The main setup of characters are rather likeable and mesh well together, in my opinion. Things for the most part are light and happy, and hey that is nice to see in the Buffy universe having watched some of the later seasons now.

It was a bit hard to get through but this DVD set was worth watching to get to Season 2, which I have bought and watched - I am definitely more impressed. If you have the patience I would recommend this series! Buy Season 1 to understand the plot and characters from the beginning but do not judge the entire show from this box set. It gets much better and more entertaining. You will eventually understand the hype and following it has gained. It is becoming one of my favorites.",1372896000,,2453,4.339869281045751

1378902,3,B00004YWJE,"Buffy the vampire slayer is one of the greatest shows of all time and it is certainly my favorite show of all time.  However, in the grand scheme of things the first season was somewhat weak compared to other stronger seasons.  The show starts when Buffy Summers moves to Sunnaydale CA after being kicked out of school in LA.  Soon she meets her new watcher and mentor Rupert Giles and soon to be inseperable best friends Williow Rosenburg and Xander Harris.  Together these four characters fight the forces of darkness throughout the season, and series.  This season does many things correct, including realistically showing the pangs of growing up and being in high school.  For example,even though Buffy wants to be a normal girl and fit in she cannot because she is the slayer and, while for many different reasons, pretty much everyone has yearned to fit in.  There are some fantastic episodes in the first season, however, these episodes do not cover up the faults.  First, the acting in places is very wooden, especially Angel in his first couple of episodes.  The four main actors spend a lot of the first season learning how to realistically perform together and at times it seems like Xander, Buffy, and Williow were thrown together because that is what the show wanted and not because their friendship made sense.  Normally, I would rate this season as 4 stars, however, there are some minor video quality issues with the DVDs which is why I deducted another star.",1371686400,,1475,4.794466403162056

Buffy the Vampire Slayer is not your typical Vampire, Love Struck series, but has it the old fashioned way: have to be asked to come in, burn alive in sunlight, crosses, holy water, stake to the heart, etc. THIS is another reason why it is so great, because it isn't the glittery vampire crap everyone is into today.

1378921,5,B00004YWJE,"There are already a lot of excellent reviews for this show, and this show has been around long enough for it to have seeped into the collective consciousness. Most people already know about this show and have already formed an opinion. I am writing this review for two reasons. First, I recently decided to re-watch this series (I watched it for the first time a number of years ago) and I was struck by the high quality of writing and I wanted to add my voice to the chorus of praise surrounding the show. Second, I am definitely not the demographic audience for this show. I am a thirty year old man and I have no particular interest in the supernatural, vampires, witchcraft, or high school dramas. I was reluctant to even try this show but the writing turned out to be good enough to transcend my genuine lack of interest in the genre. So I would like to encourage others who feel they might be outside the intended demographic of this show to give it a try.

There are a number of reasons that this show stands out from the pack. First, as I have already mentioned, is the writing. Most shows like this tend to suffer from what I think are three major flaws in the writing department. First, the characters tend to be cliched and virtually interchangeable with one another. Every character in this show is fully developed and has their own important place in the overall economy of the show. They are not just interchangeable pawns. They are each like puzzle pieces and only when they are all added together do you get a genuine picture. If you subtracted one of them the show would no longer be as strong. That is really hard to do. To develop a genuine ensemble in which each part is as important and interesting as all the others. This show achieved that brilliantly, and it avoids cliche. Cordelia, for example, starts out as sort of the cliched popular girl, but as the show progresses, she becomes an interesting character in her own right.

Second, the dialogue in most shows like this tends to be bland and repetitive. Shows like this tend to have characters who get into the same arguments over and over and over. It feels like the writers need filler so they just transplant the same argument from episode to episode. Plus, the humor tends to be bland. The dialogue in this show is way above the standard. The humor is actually funny. I find myself laughing out loud in almost every episode and I never feel like the writers are just throwing filler dialogue in because they have nothing better to say. There are times when the dialogue can get a little corny but there are also some really brilliant speeches delivered by various characters throughout the run of the show. A lot of the speeches have genuine substance, and the verbal repartee that often takes place between characters is usually far more clever than the average.

Third, most of these shows lack a genuine connection to real life. The writing fails to connect to universal themes. Whether people realize it or not, I think the primary reason that this show was as popular as it was, is because people recognized that it was dealing with universal themes that related to their own lives. That can be very difficult to do in a show about the supernatural. The premise of the show is that Buffy is literally ""the chosen one"". She is supposed to be unique, and yet, somehow her struggles come to mirror everyone's struggles. I imagine that teenage girls in particular will identify with Buffy. Probably more than a thirty year old man anyways, but despite the difference between Buffy and I in age and gender, I still feel like this show connected with my own life. I saw a Joss Whedon interview where he talked about how traumatic high school was for him and how he feels like he will be carrying scars around from that period for the rest of his life. That is one of the primary themes of this show (the first few seasons anyways) and I think a lot of people can relate to that.

This show was successful in portraying the way that high school actually felt for a lot of people and it succeeded in giving a much more realistic portrayal than previous shows. Buffy is constantly trying to juggle her school work, her social life, and her family life, while spending her evenings fighting demons, a particularly apt metaphor, in my opinion. High school is often a time period when our own personal demons start to make an appearance and it can be very difficult to deal with all of that while still trying to maintain a normal life. High school is also a time when we try to figure out who we are, and sometimes we do not like who we are, and it takes awhile to accept ourselves. All of that is dramatized very well in this show. Even though this show is about supernatural fantasy creatures, it is also, in my opinion, one of the most realistic shows ever made.

The show also hits the sweet spot in terms of narrative structure. Each season has an overarching story line, but the episodes that deal with that story line alternate with more stand alone episodes. Shows seem to have a really hard time finding that sweet spot. When shows lack any overarching story line I tend to get bored eventually, but in some shows the overarching story line comes to usurp the stand alone episodes, and I get bored with that as well. This show strikes the perfect balance, in my opinion. The acting is also superb. There is a reason that such a high percentage of the actors and actresses in this show went on to bigger and better things. It seems like a television show like this is often the beginning and end of an actor or actresses career. Joss Whedon, or whoever was in charge of the casting, did an excellent job casting each character. The great writing would have fallen flat without quality actors and actresses to deliver it.

The show has what I would consider a few minor flaws. Sometimes it is a little bit too sappy for me. The show is dealing with high school emotions so that is, perhaps, unavoidable. There are also genuine moments of emotional truth, though, so it balances out. I am willing to forgive the sappiness because, sometimes, I think they get the emotions just right, which is rare. There are also a few moments in the first season where the special effects sort of pull you out of the show. Apparently, they had a really low budget for the first season. There were a few times where I was pulled out of the show with the thought ""That looked weird"". But that is ultimately a very minor flaw, and it becomes less of a problem as the show progresses. Ultimately, I think this is one of the better shows I have watched. It is one of the only shows that I have decided to watch again from start to finish. So that is saying something.",1367884800,,6729,4.502454991816694
1378922,5,B00004YWJE,"I watched reruns of the show, but I finally got around to watching the show in order a few months ago. I really liked the introduction to Buffy in Sunnydale. The characters are starting to develop slowly, and the Master proves to be a relatively interesting villain. Buffy really just wants to be normal, and it's a struggle most people face in high school without slayer powers. It really is an introduction to the chosen one's new life and the direction of the series. Granted I didn't watch the whole movie, but show seems to do a good job of being separate but including aspects from Buffy's past. Basically she's awesome and she tries to find somewhere she belongs in a high school which is the literal entrance to hell.",1367884800,,725,4.584615384615384

1378926,5,B00004YWJE,"THIS SERIES NEEDS A SEQUEL.  Ideas for that, follow at the end of this review.

This review is for the Amazon Prime viewing of the series.  I don't have it on DVD. Yet.  This series will be a privilege to own.  Truly first-class in every respect.  If you're in drama school or thinking about acting, directing, film editing, scriptwriting, etc. as a career -- this series is MUST WATCH.  Every skill one needs to acquire for A+ performance, is well depicted in this series.

Were I teaching drama, I'd make it mandatory to watch this series over and over, dissecting it just as much as one must do with Shakespeare or Attic plays.

You'll believe in Divine inspiration, when you see the genius combination of script, actors (especially in ensemble), choreography, timing, film editing.  FABULOUS.  Worth watching over and over, just to enjoy all that wit and skill!

Yet during seasons 1 and 2 (which I first watched live on TV when it was initially aired),  I kept on thinking, 'this is worth watching while I clean my email.'  For vampire series are usually maudlin;  high-school series are yawn yawn yawn.  The movie version of Buffy was abysmal, I turned it off after 20 minutes or so.  Not even Donald Sutherland could save that movie.

But this series is something else.  Sure, as the series progresses you're bombarded with occult advertising (one set of dark powers to save the world from another set of dark powers), but that's all the rage.  Lies always win.  Not even Christians care about Bible accuracy, so why should a secular show pay attention?

Even so, here both acting plus script, deliver great entertainment and many insightful, impolitic moments.  If you're a fundy uptight Christian, don't watch.  If you're a mature Christian, do watch.  The writers hit controversial topics in each episode, and usually with aplomb.

The writers give the actors many original and clever, zappy one-liners;  there are episodes totally removed from the plot without warning, as if Vampire SNL (Saturday Night Live); and the actors have great fun with it.  Wonderful cast chemistry.

The fight choreography is good.  Humor and camp pervades.  The series is often self-deprecating, too.  Lots of features packed into every 45-minute (commercial free) episode, and worth re-watching.

The acting is versatile, balanced, excellent.  Worth watching for the actors, alone.  But they'd not have much to do, were it not for the excellent script, direction, timing, film editing.  Good pace to each episode.  Always leaves you glad you watched.

As the series progresses, many a famous ancient or recent song, film or movie or book is burlesqued in the subplots, so there is much for such fans to enjoy.  Quick example:  the famous 'Mack the Knife' song is visually burlesqued by a Joe-Pesci-like loan shark, replete with flashy suit, fins and rubbery mask;  or, the A-Team and Shaq get a 30-second imitation.  1950's sock hops, Bye Bye Birdie and Sandra Dee all form the backdrop for a 'magic spell' in a sterling musical episode.  Film noir is well represented, and it suddenly turns on then off, with panache.  Fabulous wit and timing.

There are plenty of serious moments, which also suddenly turn on, then off.  Laced with the campy, self-deprecating humor, the serious moments are more meaningful, and you'll find yourself enlightened.

Sorry if I sound gushy.  I've not seen such amalgamated, versatile genius in a TV series this gorgeous since MASH, and Rocky & Bullwinkle.

Of course, all the demonology and magic in the series is from Jewish or Christian gnostic and classical Greek myths and drama.  They deliberately make the monsters LOOK like they are in costumes;  the costume's tackiness actually enhances both plot and meaning.

The plotlines twist, in both predictable and unpredictable ways;  when predictable, the self-deprecation is high, so you don't even mind the predictability.  The writers love turning stereotypes upside down, and the actors have great fun with that.  Sterling performances.

So, you'll forget to clean your email.

=========================
Season Seven is kinda rushed.  Its Episode 9 contained an astonishingly accurate translation of Proverbs 24:6, which is usually mistranslated in Bibles.  So how did the writers know that?  The mistranslations all imply that GROUPTHINK is superior to an individual's own wise (meaning from-God) counsel.  But the writers in the series wiped out that idea, and the whole theme of Season 7, followed suit.  Always must be ONE leader.

So that, my friends, is the proper theme for a sequel.  So now, it's 2013.  If the old white under-subway set of Alias is still available, that could still be used as a new headquarters for Buffy & Co., for a souped up version of the new story.

Here it is.  Okay, now all those empowered Slayers have had 10 years to actually TRAIN in their powers, but what did they do?  Nothing.  See, having power is not better than having love, and without love, there's no desire to train.  Without training, the power is wasted.  That's the big difference between evil and good.  God loves.  So power is used to effect the love, not to lord it over everyone else.  Satan loves power, so thinks he'll be happy if he can lord it over God.  Oldest story in the world, often told in simpering ways.

So Buffy & Co. have to come back.  Hellmouth wasn't the only one of its kind.  The others are regrouping.  And the demons DID learn from the explosion, so have gone corporate, sophisticated.  Government is what they chose to get into, so they can rule that way.  Regulation has become complex, through the roof, political correctness is thus all the rage, and bloodsucking is brainsucking, so to speak.  Brains are sucked dry of independent thought, as government around the world -- especially in the US -- has come to micromanage everything 'for the greater good'.  Yeah, greater good for those who wield the power, not for humanity as a whole.  Freedom is nearly sucked dry.

Now demons look like respectable humans and wear suits.  Invading boardrooms and especially Congress, the Presidency.  Quietly.  Deftly.  Evil has gone Versace.

Not that the popular fight scenes have ended.  Oh no.  The minions still want their tea and baguette, so the would-be legacy of strength to defeat evil gets delayed and diluted into bam-bam-bam.  Vampires are now used in policework, to avoid the expense of a long trial.  And, to wipe out the slayers who didn't train as they should.  So gradually, all those slayers are whittled down.  Victory is in sight, for only a few slayers who were too smart to do the bam-bam thing, are left.

Meanwhile, Buffy has recovered, and actually went back to school and learned some stuff, became something of a geek, like Willow.  Giles too, and Willow, have learned that the so-called black arts for good, are no better than their evil-usage counterparts.  But the covens still exist, cluelessly imagining that they can use the same old stuff to defeat the evil.  Angel, meanwhile, has finished his stint in Los Angeles, and has a found a new weapon.  (What kind?  I don't know, I'm not a script writer.)

So now what's left to defeat the suave demons?  Enter, Buffy & Co., if the original cast is still interested.

Oh and puleese, get straight on what the Bible actually says, even if you don't believe in it.  The real demon story in there is light-years scarier and more dramatic than any Christian even knows, than any film/series has ever told.  Leave out the 'devil's baby' nonsense in The Devil's Advocate, but take your cue from Al Pacino's soliloquy at the end.  That came somewhat close to the real fight going on, per 2Cor10:5, Ephesians 6.  It's a headgame.  Battle inside the soul, same battle as in Genesis 3, do you choose God over people, vox populi being the greatest evil weapon.

Okay, maybe this idea for the sequel is too scary.  I recant.  Sorta.",1366761600,,7898,4.876226415094339

1378934,5,B00004YWJE,"I'm watching <i>Buffy</i> for the first time in a big streaming marathon, and really enjoying it. I recall back then the name turned me off, and I didn't listen to people who tried to assure me that ""it's not as bad as it sounds"". And they were right and I was wrong. I loved Joss Whedon's <i>Firefly</i>, also watched retrospectively, so I shouldn't be surprised.

Although the milieu is high school, it's not strictly speaking a teen show. All the kids get some rather sophisticated lines that appeal to grownups, while still remaining rooted enough in that world that I felt sympathy for that familiar ""teen angst"". Sarah Michelle Gellar as Buffy pulls off the action-figure sequences competently and fleshes out Buffy as a real, believable human being (I find myself contrasting Gellar's performance with Jennifer Garner's as the action-figure in <i>Alias</i>, which I found wooden and shallow; Gellar is a better actress). Buffy can be the stereotypical teen girl, petulant and stubborn and willful and insecure...and then she goes out and saves the world. The supporting characters are part of the fun, too--Willow is stunningly adorable, but I find Xander just annoying and Cordelia a sad clown. Which is good--I'm reacting to the characters like they're real and matter.

1378974,4,B00004YWJE,"Buffy the Vampire Slayer is a series often talked about in Geek circles in fact that fanbase founded Tv tropes. Not watching this series made me feel illeterate in 'nerdom' if that is the correct term so I finally settles down to watch it and what were my impressions?

First, thing that stood out to me were the characters each of them felt like real teenagers not the hollywood sterotypes that were too often seen on 90's tv to even today. Everything from their strengths to their valunerabilitues  as a nineteen year old girl I could see a piece of myself in every character on the screen even Giles. The one who ended up being my favorite was Willow, who I also saw myself in the most. The actors were also excellent. I would like to put the spotlight on Sarah Gellar the most.

I do not believe that Buffy would have been the character she was without being portyaed by Sarah Gellar. She is so wonderful at playing Buffy's human side and still be a be a kick butt heroine. Too often when shows want to show the heroine's valnurable side they end up going to the point where they undercut her strength. That is not what happens with Buffy we see her fears, selfish actions, and emotions basiaclly everything a real sixteen year old girl is and she does not lose your strength because of it, but the fact she overcomes that makes her stronger. While the writing is at credit, I belive most of the praise for that does To Gellar and her acting.

Along with realistic teen character is to mix it with teen problems with a supernatural twist. Ironically I felt that these issues from parental pressure to feeling 'invisible' was handled much better and with more tact thatn most normal teen dramas. One thing the show has a problem with is narm.

For those of you who don't know narm is a term for when something that is suppose to be dramtitic or sad turns out to be funny. There is a lot of narm here. Moloch's robot costume is basically a power ranger's villian, The voodoo barbies, to the smoking kill's sign, not to mention that despite the constant murders that no one is closing the school.

As you can tell, I enjoyed the show and will watch the other seasons and hopefull the comic as well",1343347200,3,2198,4.428217821782178

1378976,5,B00004YWJE,"It's been years since I watched this show and I have to say that it is, even years later, very fun and witty.  With all the reality nonsense that is on television, you owe it to yourself to take some time to watch this creative offering.  As an adult watching the show, there are some deep concepts that I completely missed as a teen.  For a show that was geared to teens, Whedon did not sacrifice dialogue.  For girls that are teenagers now, I think Buffy's portrayl as a strong woman is inspiring.  If you just don't think you can stand watching a show about a bunch of kids contending with high school and demons, vampires, and witches, another great option created by Whedon is Firefly.

1378982,4,B00004YWJE,"I had to admit when I first found out about a show being made I was skeptic. I didn't think they could pull it off considering how buffy was a senior when she discovered her gift and started to slay the demons in the movie and killed a master at the school dance. In the show she comes in as a freshman who torched a gym already knowing that she was and in the craft of slaying already. but i guess they didn't want to necessarily tie it to the movie that way.

I honestly thought I wouldn't like it. But as I watched I was drawn into it more and more. Couldn't wait to get home when Seven O'clock hit. No one was allowed to bother me when i was watchin ""my show"" and i hated watching tv. They ignored the typical stereotype of her being popular airhead and made her the outcast of which was cool.

After season 5 though...her all of a sudden having a sister and then her dying at the end (a fittind end) and being resurected (not smart) I felt like they were trying to hard to keep the show going and they were running out of ideas. a lot of the episodes seemed..not fitting to the Show title because she fought less and less vampires

The episode where she became a counceler at the  school had been and all the girls were goin crazy over the dude with spelled letter jacket was the dumbest episode i had seen

To top it off they got repetitive when she started fooling around with Spike that twisted love affair wit the 'Bad vamp turn good vamp in love and go back to bad vamp' had already been done with Angel and that was enough. (2)trying to understand the source of why she was a slayer and her purpose was another (3)constantly firing Giles as her watcher got annoying.

But it grew into a stunningly well meshed cast with great character development and chemistry. Just as the dynamic in the show, Buffy cements the rest of the characters, Sarah Michelle Gellar clearly carries the series but she's able to do so because the cast works as such a compliment to her style of acting. The makeup gets better and better as it goes along and the guest stars are also strong.

So my favorite episode is probably the Nightmares episode. This deals with all of the Scoobie gangs nightmares and how the deal with them, Xander's being showing up to class in only his underwear. While this episode is funny, it lets us take an inside look into the characters we know and love. one of the best episodes in my opinion.
My second favorite has got to be out of mind,out of sight dealing with mysterious happening s revolving around Cordelia and her group. it lets Buffy and Cordelia work together, and lets us see wht this ""ghost"" is feeling and why this has
happened to her.

Amazon nudged me to review this, so here I am, but -- to review *Buffy* feels absurd! This series kicked ""I, Claudius"" and BBC/A&E ""Pride and Prejudice"" off the top of my best-of-TV list. When it went off the air, it left me...bereft may be the word.

Thank God for DVD's!

This series is s-o-o-o much more than a vampire/horror show. Do not mistake it for those childish movies. It is funny and deep and moving and clever and scary and disturbing...you could say it's about what it is to be human. As sci fi, it's in a class with ""Bladerunner""--seminal. It can be as delicate as Jane Austen, and as harsh as ""Deadwood""...but without its heartlessness. It has a pinch of ""My So-called Life"" or ""Geeks and Freaks."" The acting is superb and the writing often brilliant and always entertaining. The creator of the show, Joss Whedon, is a genius. (One episode is a mini-musical, years before ""Glee."")

""Buffy"" gets better and better as it goes along (and the later seasons especially are sexy as all get-out).

1379000,4,B00004YWJE,"This product was a replacement for the first season box set that I lost during a move, so it's been a few years since I've seen Season 1.

It's a short season, 12 episodes that really throw you into the fray. Because there is an entire story to get through in only 12 episodes, the plot moves fairly quickly; although when I first watched it, it seemed like to took longer to develop, which says a lot about the cast and crew of Buffy. The effects are somewhat cheesy, since it was first aired in 1997. (If you're getting into Buffy for the first time, the effects get a lot better over the seasons.) [Also an interesting side note, the development of computers in Buffy is quite interesting. In Season 1 they show a computer class, and the students are learning basic coding on MS DOS, but by the end of Season 5 Willow has a laptop. It's interesting if you're a computer nerd like me haha]

The first season is not the best season of Buffy; but it is somewhat necessary to watch, because later seasons refer back to earlier ones. (Buffy: The Vampire Slayer is based off of a movie, with different actors. The movie is terrible and is generally non-essential to the storyline of the Buffyverse.)

If you're into supernatural shows, serious plot-lines, complex characters (this show has a lot of character development), well choreographed fight scenes and strong female leads, then you should really consider watching this show.

The only con is: When Buffy has a problem, they tend to hit you over the head with it a bit. But it's easy to look past.",1284940800,,1550,4.544802867383512

In the first-season finale, Giles discovers an ancient prophecy which states that Buffy will face the Master and she will die. Upon hearing this, Buffy first denies her slayer roots, but when a small tragedy occurs at school, Buffy realizes she can't run from destiny, and decides to take on The Master.",1259712000,2,6892,5.600577478344562

1379010,1,B00004YWJE,I love the show.  The video quality of this DVD is terrible.  One of the worst video transfers I've ever seen.,1256428800,7,110,4.190476190476191
1379011,3,B00004YWJE,"I'm going to start out by saying that I love this show.  I have to be one of the only guys in the world who likes this show.  Now this was not the best season by a long shot.  I don't think too many people even acknowledge this season.  What it does is set the groudwork for future seasons.  The plot and all the main characters are introduced nicely.  The key problem with this season: low budget.

Now as many of you know, the series is based off a 1992 movie of the same name, starring Kristy Swanson, Luke Perry, and Donald Sutherland.  I haven't seen the movie, but I've heard it's horrible.  Taking that into account, it is surprising that this show was ever concieved.  Obviously, they didn't have a lot to work with.  As a result, there are many problems with the first season.  The costumes and makeup look kind of cheesy.  The action scenes are not very well choreographed.  I could be wrong, but I don't think many of the actors(with the exception of Anthony Stewart Head) had done much acting.  I didn't think the acting was horrible, but it's not excellent either.  The villian of this season, the master, is kind of lame.  I got real tired of his quips and attempts at being scary.  SPOILER ALERT.  His fight with Buffy at the end of the season did not make any sense.  How does Buffy easily kill the most powerful vampire on the planet when he easily killed her five minutes earlier?

Even with problems like these, the season is still okay.  There were elements of this season that would get better with better writing and a bigger budget.  For example, I saw right away that Xander is supposed to be the funny comic relief guy.  Most of his little jokes weren't that funny in this season, but I could see that his delivery of those lines was excellent.  And in later seasons, he does become a very funny character.

Overall, the season was okay.  It interested me enough to get me to watch the second season.  So if you want to get into a great television series, buy oor rent this DVD, suffer through it, and then you get to watch seasons two and three, some of the best television I've ever seen.",1255046400,4,2115,4.381443298969073

1379013,5,B00004YWJE,Buffy the Vampire Slayer is one of the best shows ever. I really loved the first season and every season after that. Season one will always be one of my favorites though.

1379014,5,B00004YWJE,"... you'll love Buffy.

Buffy Summers (Sarah Michelle Gellar) is the Chosen One, the Slayer. As Watcher Giles (Anthony Stewart Head) says in the intro to each episode: ""she alone must stand against the vampires, the demons, and the forces of darkness."" Sort of a rough gig for a 16 year old. But as we come to see in this terrific first season, Buffy can handle it.

Despite the title,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Buffy-the-Vampire-Slayer-The-Complete-First-Season-Slim-Set/dp/B000EHSVKK/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Buffy the Vampire Slayer  - The Complete First Season (Slim Set)</a>&nbsp;is about a lot more than vampires. There's invisible girls, green horned demons, ravenous hyenas, and the usual complement of ghosts and ghouls. But even beyond that Buffy is a show about what it's like to be a teenager. In a hilarious twist that will appeal to the poetic justice of teenagers (and those who remember the angst of being a teen) everywhere, writer and director Joss Whedon has situated Buffy's new high school atop a Hellmouth, thereby reinforcing the popular teen maxim that ""highschool is hell."" Well in Buffy, it actually is. Whedon carries this metaphor through without, using various supernatural scenarios to mirror the realities of what it feels like for a teen in high school.

For example, in ""Out of Mind, Out of Sight,"" Buffy and friends must battle a girl who was so unpopular that she literally became invisible and is now out to exact her revenge on the most popular girl in school. Other episodes like ""The Pack,"" ""Teacher's Pet,"" and ""I, Robot, You, Jane"" deal with similar issues including bullying, having a crush on your teacher, and internet dating.  Whedon's smart and funny writing ensures that each episode is relatable but never preachy. And of course, though Buffy's job description is to fight against evil in the name of goodness, she is no goody two-shoes herself. Saving the world isn't easy, even for the slayer. Buffy skips classes, argues with her mother and her Watcher, and frequently makes mistakes. But as the quintessential rebel with a cause, we forgive her and find ourselves identifying with her even through the mistakes. Add to these qualities the excellently choreographed fight scenes that fill each episode, the hilarious and heart-felt trials and tribulations that face Buffy and the Scooby gang (including Alyson Hannigan and Nicholas Brendan), and the heart-rending romance that springs up between Buffy and  Angel (David Boreanaz), and you've got a show that you can't stop watching. Yes, the clothing and the sayings are dated, and sometimes the acting and cinematography leave a little to be desired, but the underlying messages and feelings are still universal years later. If you've never seen Buffy before, get ready: you're in for a treat!",1250208000,2,2846,5.341517857142857
1379015,5,B00004YWJE,"Even though it's been years since this show first aired, I recently found myself missing Buffy and bought this DVD set to watch over a long weekend.  Back in the day, the writers and the actors were getting a feel for the show and, even though it wasn't as polished and dramatic as future seasons, it was great right from the beginning.

There will never be another show like Buffy, even though there are a number of vampire shows on TV, thanks to the popularity of Twilight.  Even though I like True Blood, it's not as good as this one.",1247097600,,537,4.35

Buffy and the gang is great to watch and I love how the story unfolds from one episodes to another, as if we are growing with the characters. As oppose some tv shows to where the story begins and ends in an episode and then it starts over next episodes, it doesn't evolve like Buffy the Vampire Slayer, and that is the big part of the reason it works so great, plus the Writers who has done the wonderful job of dialogues and adventure and humor. Everyone should see this show!",1239753600,4,678,4.223076923076923

Buffy moves to Sunnydale with her mom Joyce after being kicked out of school in Los Angeles. She immediately meets her new watcher, Rupert Giles and Angel, hunky vampire with a soul. With their help she starts battling demons and vamps in Sunnydale. And you thought Suburbia was safe!

The villain of the first season is The Master, one of the oldest living vampires in the world. The stories are well structured with sharp, funny dialogue and each character really stands out on their own. It's fun to see a female action star especially one that has time to be a cheerleader too. A must see for vamp lovers everywhere.",1239148800,,840,4.556291390728477

Season 2 and 3 are the best seasons. Buffy was a good show while it lasted, aww the memories!",1225756800,,393,4.549295774647887
1379020,2,B00004YWJE,"I like Buffy the Vampire Slayer. But season one is GOD-AWFUL.
The acting is rather Horrible. Nicholas Brendan better improve as the series progresses, because his performance is embarrassing.
The special effects are sad. i realize this is just when it started and therefore they weren't going to put a bunch of money into something they didn't know would succeed, but it really kills the mood it's trying to create.
The scripts are filled with horrible slang ""What's the sitc?"" (thankfully i think that dissapears after episode 2) But other than horribly dated language...is the cheesy corny crap the actors are regularly spewing. Yeah it's not all bad. sometimes i laugh.
But For example. Demon takes over the internet. the students start acting funny. They follow one of the students to an old computer development site called CDR.
Xander:Well i guess we better get to CDR.
Buffy: The computer development center?
YES MORON!  my god, we're only more than halfway into the episode. how poor do they think my memory is?
People state the ovbious on a consistent basis.
Oh yeah. the plots themselves can get pretty retarded.  A demon takes over the internet.
And  she's a vampire slayer, but when she suggests that Xander has been possesed by a hyena, that's just crazy talk!
Then 4 students kill their principal, but you never hear about it again. i understand that the show is episodic, but come on! they could have wrapped it up in the episode, instead of the 5 minutes a horrible song plays and Xander and his new hyena palls brood around campus.

i like it, and i'm enduring it because i just know that the series will get better as it goes on. but this is a really cringe-worthy begining, and not because the ugly vampires are scary.

i liked the witch episode quite a bit, it had a good twist. BUt all in all, season one is a lesson in how not to act or write a show.",1222992000,,1872,4.60960960960961

What i want to mention are the slim set packs.  They are marvelous.  Not only do they take up less room and use fewer resources, but they prevent the DVDs from sliding around much if they become dislodged in shipping so they don't get scratched.  I love DVDs but it is annoying that the larger packaging provides no protection for sliding DVDs, so I have to figure that someone associated with Buffy made yet another great choice, this one not about scripting, casting, or action choreography, but about the mundane but so important aspect of how to box the DVDs.",1219190400,4,786,4.430555555555555

With Buffy I lean on the fact that it was the beginning of one of the best 90's series, however, the series is still naive and innocent. Who would not love Sarah Michelle anyway? I do, passionately! The dark/doomy lights sorround them everywhere, haunting and heartless vampires can come from anywhere. The Watcher's British accent gives style to it and the different villains: possessed hienas, cyber demons, ''chuky'' vendetta toys and a gang of vampire soldiers give 100% entertainment to you.

1379041,5,B00004YWJE,"I will never forget the very first time I watched the television version of ""Buffy the Vampire Slayer.""  I watched it from day 1 and have never looked back.  What is it about ""Buffy"" that speaks to so many people from so many disparate backgrounds?  It isn't just a show about fighting vampires; it isn't only about being a teenager; it isn't just about fighting the forces of Darkness - yet it is all of these things and more.  ""Buffy"" encompasses humor, horror, angst, drama, romance - in other words, life.  Joss Whedon created an intricate world and kept it rolling - kept it alive.

Season One was a mid-season replacement, so it came in at a bit of a disadvantage - other shows were already emplaced, already had an audience and fans.  However, ""Buffy"" had a presence that brought people in.  Right away it was obvious that this was not going to be your mother's vampire show - the teaser opening was a cute little blond girl and a big guy coming into the high school at night - spooky spooky!  The girl is scared and unsure - the guy is macho and somewhat bullying.  Watch out, little girl, right?  WRONG!  The little girl is Darla, a powerful vampire - somewhere in the vicinity of 400 years old - who proceeds to kill the guy.  The next day, Buffy enters into her new high school.  We are quickly introduced to the main players - Cordelia, the rich and popular queen of the school quickly works to befriend the new girl from LA.  Xander and Jesse, the geeky guys, try to get her to notice them - Xander does this by actually running into her in the hall.  Willow is the brains; after Buffy sees Willow being put down by Cordelia, Buffy approaches Willow for help with her school work.  We see the beginning of the Scooby Gang form.  Then Buffy goes to the library, where she is accosted by Giles, who was put there to be her Watcher.  Of course, Buffy doesn't want to be a Slayer anymore - why would she?  It ruined her life in LA, got her kicked out of school and she had to move here to Sunnydale, butt-end of nowhere.  Of course, vampires don't care for the desires of school girls and there is a nasty vampire underneath the town - the Master, he is called - waiting for a chance to break free and take over the world.

Thus Season One begins.  Buffy takes on more than vampires in Season One, of course - she takes on witches, Incan mummy girls, giant praying mantis ladies, living nightmares, invisible girls, etc.  In some ways it is a bit uneven, as our heroes find their way into their roles.  In other ways, it is the best season of them all, because it is all so new and wonderful.  We watch Cordelia develop from a one-dimensional Queen B to a multi-faceted member of the group (albeit somewhat reluctant member of the group).

The box set doesn't have quite as many bells and whistles as some of the newer ones, but there are some nice commentaries on some of the episodes.  Unfortunately, once you turn on a commentary for one episode, it is on for the entire disk unless you turn off the DVD player, remove the DVD, put something else in for awhile and then put it back in, which is a bit annoying - it would be nice if you would turn the commentaries back off as well.  Something I would love to see more of - in ALL the seasons - is more outtakes.  Everyone loves outtakes but only one of the seasons has any outtake reels on it (I believe it is on the Season 4 disks but I might be mistaken).

There is more to ""Buffy the Vampire Slayer"" than meets the eye - don't miss it.",1187568000,,3500,4.297709923664122
1379042,4,B00004YWJE,"Joss Whedon is very smart to come up with such a great and well thought out show. From the beginning, you love all his creations. Sunnydale, the hellmouth, the slayer idea, Buffy, Giles, Willow, Xander, Cordy, etc., etc. Joss actually writes a whole lot in this season, which makes this season one of the most well written seasons in the whole entire 'Verse. But, with that said, some of the acting is not so great. The leads are great, but some guests are just lacking. Also, the visuals do not look to good to your eyes. The special effects and make-up crew are not looking too good at this point, but still decent, just nothing special. There are also some mediocre episodes (""I Robot, You Jane"" ""Teacher's Pet"") , but that was only one or two episodes. Now, let's go through the episodes.

Episode One: ""Welcome To The Hellmouth"" - 4.5/5 - Amazing! Amazing introduction to the series! The characters are great, plus the plot is great! Great one!

Episode Two: ""The Harvest"" - 4/5 - Good one!

Episode Three: ""Witch"" - 2.5/5 - Okay, but the plot bugs me at time. Nothing bad, but not very memorable.

Episode Four: ""Teacher's Pet"" - 0.5/5 - There are one or two good Xander lines, but, other than that, mediocre at best.

Episode Five: ""Never Kill A Boy On The First Date"" - 3.5/5 - This is a good one!

Episode Six: ""The Pack"" - 4.5/5 - I really love this one!

Episode Seven: ""Angel"" - 4.5/5 - Another one I love!

Episode Eight: ""I, Robot. You, Jane"" - 1/5 - Not good, but some good lines.

Episode Nine: ""The Puppet Show"" - 3.5/5 - This is a good one!

Episode Ten: ""Nightmares"" - 4.5/5 - Great one!

Episode Eleven: ""Out Of Mind, Out Of Sight"" - 4.5/5 - Another amazing one!

Episode Twelve: ""Prophecy Girl"" - Totally the best in the season! Sarah Michelle Gellar shows her acting abilities here. Her performance is absoloutley chilling!

1379044,4,B00004YWJE,"Maybe not techincally the beginning since there was a 1992 feature film of the same name (starring Kristy Swanson, Luke Perry and Donald Sutherland), but this series was a huge improvement over the movie, and with Emmy-winner Sarah Michelle Gellar in the lead, the show really caught my attention.  I was in high school at the time, so I could really relate.  It's interesting in retrospect, since the series ended, observing how the show and characters evolved over time.  The first season, for the most part, is arguable lighter and a bit cheesy compared to later on, and the series didn't really hit its mark until the second season, with the introduction of darker themes, backstory and the villainous vampire duo Spike and Druscilla (James Marsters and Juliet Landau).  At first, it's all about high school junior Buffy Summers (Gellar), having moved from LA after being deemed a troublemaker at her former school, trying to adjust to life in Sunnydale, which she later learns is positioned on the Hellmouth, where vampires, demons and other ghastly stuff roams.  She discovers that she is ""the chosen one"" -  the slayer who must work to rid the world of evil.  Her watcher, school librarian Rupert Giles (Anthony Steward Head), aids her in her burdening responsibility, while her two closest friends, geeky but lovable Xander (Nicholas Brendon) who nurses a mad crush on Buffy, and shy computer nerd Willow (Alyson Hannigan), who in turn, wants her childhood pal Xander to see her in a romantic way,  find out about Buffy's destiny and join the team.  Eventually, the snobby and ultra-popular Cordelia (Charisma Carpenter) also finds her way into what would later be referred to as the Scooby gang.  As if the burden of being the Slayer isn't enough, Buffy also has to deal with the trials and tribulations of teenage life (her beauty, wardrobe and wit don't make her popular, her grades aren't always stellar and the school authorities sometimes view her as a troublemaker), all the while trying to keep her destiny and mission a secret, and dealing with the aftermath of her parents' divorce, living with her single mother (Kristine Sutherland).  Oh, and there's the mysterious, handsome Angel (David Boreanaz, for the next two seasons would be a series regular, before departing to his own spin-off, taking Cordelia with him), who gives her information regarding resident evils (getting on Xander's nerves in the process), and whom she falls for.
She discovers a secret about him (he's a vampire with a soul) that makes for a star-crossed love that will carry on for two more installments and resurface briefly in later seasons. The slayer can't seem to achieve an ordinary life or romance, which continues to be proven as she falls into another ill-fated romance with the now-reformed Spike in the last two seasons.

The best episodes of this first installment are ""Welcome To The Hellmouth"", ""Angel"", ""Nightmares"", ""Out Of Mind, Out Of Sight"" and ""Prophecy Girl"".  There are only 12 episodes, a glaring difference from the other seasons, which consist of 10 more, but gives you all more time to indulge in season 2.

Prepare yourself for teen-angst, Buffy style!",1184198400,,3173,4.984848484848484
1379045,2,B00004YWJE,"Worst season of the series, followed by season 4. Horrible dialog, horrible acting, horrible plot. Everything is so generic, and cliche, it's unreal. Cordelia's character cannot be popilar in real world, she is just too abnoxious and superficial. Xander is plane annoying from start to finish at the end of season 7. However Willow is adorable and Giles is hot. Buffy's character is not a hero type at all. Sarah Michelle Gellar was obviously very wrong for this role, Faith's character later in the series is much more believable than hers. All of her fighting moves are awkward, and her lines are cliche, she just doesn't stike you as a vampire slayer. She is too little and too cheerleader type for this role. But of course she has to defeat the main villain with superhuman strength and magic who's been planning the apocalypse throughout the entire season in 3 minutes and still be on time for a high school dance.",1183939200,,919,4.75
1379046,5,B00004YWJE,"So you saw the movie and decided it's a bit dumb, why would you even think of watching the series? How could a Slayer of Vampires make for an interesting series anyway?
These were the thoughts I had after watching the original movie which WAS written by Joss Wheedon, the writer and sometimes Director of the later TV series. Joss himself openly admits that they wouldn't let him do with the movie what he wanted, not to mention some real corn-ball acting...it's no wonder that people are sceptic's when it comes to the series.
The first season is a great introduction to the Slayer that should have been in the movie. Yes there are a few campy episodes but over-all there is a serious theme that runs through-out which gives the whole thing a bit of an edge. Not to mention the characters which, strangely enough, grow on you until you just can't wait to see what they do next, or if they live or die. Vampire,Demons,Witches,Warlocks,Evil VS. Good, boy meets girl,girl meets Vampire with a soul...it's all here, and yes, you will become addicted...if your into wonderfully original writing,truelly decent acting and the feeling of celebrating Halloween every day of the year.",1180224000,2,1176,4.798029556650246
1379047,4,B00004YWJE,"Six or seven years ago I mocked Buffy the Vampire Slayer. I had no clue what the show was really about, but you could find me saying, ""a vampire slayer? what? so lame!"" So, I never even cared to watch the show. Also I was only 10 or 11, so give me a break people. :)

Years later I picked up a $20.00 copy of season one. The only reason I bought it was because of the low price, boredom, and wanting something to watch on an upcoming road trip with family. The first few episodes were a bit odd for me because I've never been one to watch this genre. The vampire faces were a bit laughable, also the other villains were odd. But as time wore on I became HOOKED like a crack addict.

I started to love every single one of these characters. Angel. Giles. Buffy. Willow. Xander. Buffy's mom. The Master even (ha). Etc.

The last two episodes of this season are killer. I especially love the moment when Buffy is walking to fight the Master in her white dress while music is playing. Yes, I'm a big nerd.

This season is awesome, but it's nothing compared to season two, which literally rocked my face off and made me almost fail finals due to the fact that I sat around watching it instead of studying.

Even if you're not a big fan of this genre (like me) this show is completely worth watching. It's just sickeningly awesome, funny as all hell sometimes, and suspenseful.",1180051200,5,1370,4.294573643410852
1379048,4,B00004YWJE,"I was 12 when I first saw buffy and wasn't impressed because I hated any show on WB like 7th Heaven and Dawson's Creek.

Fast forward 5 years later, I kept hearing how great Buffy was and people kept encouraging me to watch it again. I bought the DVD set and I was immediately impressed!

The show may be very campy for the genre they are tackling but what it lacked of budget went into the writing and casting

This show does something that is very hard with any shows on: It made a otherwise more scary genre seem funny, cool, sad, and entertaining

I suggest watching the episode ""prophecy Girl"" It's by far the best episode of that season and set-up every other season finale for the show.

This is definitely a great season, but season 2 and the rest build upon the foundation.",1178150400,,782,4.36551724137931
1379049,5,B00004YWJE,"Buffy is an incredible TV show.  It's not as consistent as the best HBO shows, but I like it better than them anyway.  It has incredible characters and great variety in the storylines which combine the best of comedy and tragedy.

The first season is a great introduction to Buffy, but it's not that good of a TV season.  The characters are dead on from the very beginning: the core actors do a fantastic job here, and Buffy, Willow, Xander and Giles are already delivering great lines.  On the other hand, the monster plots tend to be dumb, and the season's main villain is my least favorite of the entire 7 year run (The Master is very plain compared to the interesting bad guys they will face later).

I blame the crappiness of these monster plots on the fact that most of the Buffy writing staff joins the show in seasons 2 and 3.  The dialog is great because it's rewritten by creator Joss Whedon, but even he can't save the ridiculousness of ""I Robot, She Jane""'s take on the internet, for instance.

Still, even ""I Robot"", the worst episode here, introduces one of the best supporting characters, Giles' love interest Jenny Calendar.  Each of these  episodes has a purpose, and Buffy is best watched in order.  It's also more fun to watch the show improve in quality over the first two seasons than to watch the best episodes first and have to put up with the worse ones later.  The question is, will newcomers be turned off by the dumber aspects of season one and not finish the show?

If you're unsure about Buffy, you should start with Buffy season 2's third episode when Spike is introduced and the show finally has a proper villain (or, if you really want to be impressed, skip all the way to season 4's tenth episode, Hush, which goes thirty minutes without any dialog).  If you're sure you'll enjoy Buffy (which is how I approached the show, since I was told by many people that it was great) you should start from the beginning.  These episodes are actually very fun due to the fun dialog, even if they don't hold up well after seeing the rest of the show.",1176681600,3,2071,4.470744680851064
1379050,5,B00004YWJE,"""Buffy the Vampire Slayer"" is truly one of the greatest shows ever. It premiered back on March 10, 1997 and eventually paved the way for many other TV shows (""Smallville"", ""Charmed"", ""Veronica Mars""). It's pretty mind-blowing to think about how this little show had so much momentum. It premiered on the fledgling WB network. The network that only really had one pseudo-successful show to date (""7th Heaven""). Originally opted as a mid-season replacements, I don't think anyone expected this show to have as much resonance as it did. There are many things that work, namely the acting and writing. All of this is in no small part thanks to the brilliant Joss Whedon who adapted this show from his original 1992 film of the same name.

Let's talk about that 1992 film. To say the least, it bombed. The movie didn't seem to know if it was a comedy or horror film and it often struggled to find a plot. The film did, however, have some brilliant uses of dialogue. Joss Whedon acknowledged that the movie was butchered horribly and wanted nothing to do with it. This wasn't the first time his script would be mishandled and ruined in translation to film. His other feature ""Alien: Resurrection"" wasn't received too well either. Frustrated with film, it was no wonder Whedon turned to television. What came of this is wonderful.

The show revolves around the character of Buffy Summers. On her first day at a new school she meets a wide array of new cohorts. The first of which is Cordelia Chase (the school bitch). Over the course of the episode she also meets Willow Rosenberg, Xander Harris and her would-be mentor Rupert Giles. These cast of characters are portrayed fantastically by their actor counterparts. The brilliance of these actors is what propels the show and sets it apart from many other dramas.

What also sets the show apart is it's refusal to fall under one category. It does what the 1992 film failed to do: seamlessly mix together comedy, drama, horror, satire..you name it. The comedic elements come from the interaction between Buffy and her friends. Much of their dialog is derived from modern communication but hilarious uses of pop-culture recalls and banter is utilized. The horror element comes from the fact that Buffy is a vampire slayer. She protects the citizens of Sunnydale from not only said vampires, but demons and other things.

Drama comes from the humanism of the characters. With so many fantasy elements woven into the show, a lesser show would have delved into a cartoonish formula with cardboard characters. The emotions felt by the characters is raw and most importantly, real.

With all that said, the introduction season of ""Buffy the Vampire Slayer"" really was a preview of great things to come. The ratings weren't great but the network the show was originally broadcast on knew they had something special on their hands (and so did critics). A brilliant show made a brilliant first impression and it would not fail to create the phenomenon that the show is known as today. While it has been off the air since 2003, the ramifications of what Joss Whedon created thankfully still live on.",1172880000,3,3131,4.833955223880597

Forgive the enthusiasm, but anyone who has seen this show can surely understand. ""Buffy"" is brilliant, enough said. For the uninitiated (like I was), Season One is the ideal place to start. The audience is introduced to Buffy Summers (the brilliant Sarah Michelle Gellar), Willow Rosenburg (Alyson Hannigan), Xander Harris (Nicholas Brenden), the dark, brooding Angel (David Boreanaz), Cordelia Chase (Charisma Carpenter), and Rupert Giles (Anthony Steward Head). Creator Joss Whedon took the phrase ""high school is hell,"" and created situations that are direct metaphors for what all teenagers go through. Season One is all set-up, however, for the brilliance to come. This season is the perfect primer. The audience gets to know the characters, the witty dialogue is on full display, and the audience is ready to jump head-first into emotional journey to come beginning in season two. Season One is written like a very long miniseries. This is because ""Buffy"" was a mid-season replacement, and noone knew if there would be a second season, let alone seven. The season finale, ""Prophecy Girl"" could be a series finale of sorts. The big bad is slain, and everything ends happily. If you have not seen this yet, SEE IT NOW!!

1379063,5,B00004YWJE,"Just this week, I watched the first season of Buffy for the first time, as a result of several conversations with friends.  I've always found vampire stories fascinating, because of all the already overtalked ways they describe real human problems - people preying on people, the disastrous results of failure to accept the inevitable in the guise of mortality... yadda.  But I was never interested in Buffy, so I never got the point of why Sarah Michelle Gellar's face was all over everything.  I had a certain amount of disdain for the whole thing.

Now I know what this is about, though.  Gellar is just flat amazing.  It took me around 2 hours to get through each episode because I found myself replaying little reponses she made, facial expressions, the way she packs words by the way she moves.  I was already really impressed when I came to ""Prophecy Girl,"" then still couldn't believe it when I saw what she did in the ""Read the signs... tell me my fortune..."" scene.  Amazing.

So I know now why folks defend the show from philosophical attack, artistic attack, entertainment attack... what Gellar does is so offhandedly profound, and so accurate to the way a person moves and breathes naturally in similar situations ... (here, I was going to say ""it wouldn't matter what the series was about, but I don't want to take anything away from Joss Whedon, or the concept, or the supporting cast, they all gave her space to do the work) ... it's all explainable (to me) as a defense of Gellar.  She has a hundered faces, and inhabits them all fully.

Now, I CANNOT figure out why I haven't seen her in any number of  worthy projects since this.  I don't get it at all.  Does she not want to work?  Is everyone out there making movies asleep?  Or just scared by the cultural residue of the series?",1156896000,6,1800,4.578125
1379064,4,B00004YWJE,"buffy the vampire slayer is sacred territory for a lot of people, and consequently a lot of reviews on amazon.com are pretty biased and myopic.  i'm not a buffy disciple, nor purist, nor anything of the sort.  i'd never seen a single episode of buffy the vampire the slayer until about two weeks ago.  so my review doesn't suffer from 10 years of buffy-worshipping.  i'm just a regular guy who started watching buffy without any preconceived notions or ideas.

what 'buffy' does so well, and what makes it so successful in my opinion, is that establishes a buffy mythology. a lot of the most successful series in recent years (x-files, veronica mars, lost, 24, among others) do a great job at establishing a particular mythology.  it's not enough to simply create interesting characters anymore.  joss whedon and crew succeed in creating an entirely new world.  despite it's sort of absurd premise, this is what makes buffy successful.

the series does seem to struggle in finding its footing in the beginning.  the dialogue, acting, and direction are sometimes clumsy, but that's to be expected given that it was the first season.  during the first few episodes sarah michelle gellar seems to have a bit of struggle adjusting to her character, but come the last two episodes she managed to turn buffy into a fully-realized character.  the last episode, 'prophecy girl,' is especially poignant and heart-felt and gellar really shines in showing both the vulnerable buffy and the courageous buffy.  it's the kind of perfomance that makes buffy wholly believable.  and it's a good thing given that the success of the show rested squarely on her shoulders.

the supporting cast provides some nice moments as well.  willow and xander are great sidekicks as the geeky brain and sex-crazed adolescent male, respectively. giles, buffy's english 'watcher' gives the trio much needed guidance and provides occassional levity.  cordelia is at times a bit over the top most of the time, but thankfully we get to see a little bit more of her vulnerable side as the series progresses. the hunky angel, though someone underused in my opinion, provides some nice dramatic tension.  and i get the feeling that joss whedon had some serious crushes on his high school teachers as most of the teachers in buffy are ridiculously hot.

surprisingly enough, i think buffy is most enjoyable when we see little or none of the vampires.  when the episodes explore teenage angst, isolation, jealousy, love, rejection, and triumph is when 'buffy the vampire slayer' really succeeds and is the most enjoyable.  this is a credit to whedon's keen eye and observational skills.

sure, sometimes you'll *really* have to suspend disbelief and sit through some silly plots, but you'd be hard pressed to find a more geniunely enjoyable television show. i'm looking to spending some more time in sunnyvale, ca with buffy and her crew.  and did i mention sarah michelle gellar is extremely attractive?

p.s. the dvd 'extras' are marginal, at best.  it's too bad. i would have liked a lot more interviews and behind-the-scenes stuff. hopefully the rest of the seasons will have more extras.",1153180800,3,3152,4.992337164750958

1379066,5,B00004YWJE,"The only downside to the first season of ""Buffy"" is that it's only 12 episodes long. Other than the fact that it's too short, the first season is a wonderful introduction to what would become one of the most original and well-written series in the history of television. This DVD set is a must-have as it introduces us to the wonderful world of ""Buffy"", it's lovable characters and witty dialogue. The series begins with the main characters in their sophomore year of high school. Buffy has just transferred to Sunnydale High after being kicked out of her school in L.A. for her 'violent behavior', which no one realizes is actually Buffy taking on her Slayer duties and protecting others from the threat of vampires. Upon transferring, Buffy has decided that she's had enough of the Slayer life and is determined to put it behind her. Little does she know that Sunnydale High sits right atop a hellmouth and that her being sent there is no coincidence. She goes on to make friends with Willow, a shy, geeky 'computer nerd' and Xander, a sweet, goofy sort of guy who harbors a major crush on Buffy. The cast also includes Giles, the school librarian, who is Buffy's Watcher, responsible for training Buffy both physically and mentally in her Slayer duties (and who will become an important father figure to Buffy), and Cordelia, the stereotypical popular girl in school who has a love/hate relationship w/ the gang and always seems to find herself right in the middle of their often gory situations. The mysterious Angel, who we meet in the first episode, will play a very important role in the show, but he does not become a series regular until the second season. The first season of ""Buffy"" is more on the light-hearted side than the seasons that follow. The villians they face won't pose as much of a challenge as the ones they'll face in the future and their lives aren't nearly as complicated quite yet. However, the season finale sets the perfect tone for what the show will become. Stand out episodes are the pilot ""Welcome to the Hellmouth"", ""The Harvest"", ""The Pack"", ""Angel"" and the finale ""Prophecy Girl"". Other episodes such as ""The Witch"" and ""The Puppet Show"" are also a lot of fun and better display the fabulous humor of this so-called horror show.",1149811200,,2265,4.736708860759494
1379067,5,B00004YWJE,"BUFFY THE VAMPIRE SLAYER debuted in March of 1997, much to the dismay of movie critics everywhere. Going out on a limb was creator Joss Whedon, the man who has quickly evolved to demigod status in the eyes of millions of cult fans around the world, when he revived the box-office yuppie and decided to take it in the new direction that was sorely needed. As it turns out, the limb he walked on only grew stronger until we were all forced to acknowledge he wasn't falling off anytime soon.

As the lore goes, a Vampire Slayer fends off the ever-coming darkness - vampires, demons, and the like - and does so alone, without friends or family, so as not to endanger herself or others any more than they are normally. Her development is seen over by a Watcher, part of a tribe of stuffy British people who may actually ingest dictionaries and demon mythology whole so as to provide knowledge in the clinch. Season one opens on the small California town of Sunnydale, whose shiny name disguises a town so steeped in darkness that it may very literally be sitting on the mouth of hell. Buffy, looking for an escape from vampire slaying after her first Watcher died in L.A., sees Sunnydale as a clean slate - a place to start over. That is, until her new Watcher, the school librarian Rupert Giles, contacts her with portents of evil about to break loose. So what else is new?

After a mutual friend is murdered and turned into a monster, high school sophomores Willow Rosenberg and Xander Harris are pulled into Buffy's strange world and find an odd place in the not-so-well-oiled machine of Slayer and Watcher. Together, with snarky comments and pop culture references aplenty, they seek to undo any evil that pops up in Sunnydale while keeping Buffy's identity as Slayer secret from everyone, including Buffy's mom, who occasionally wanders into the line of fire.

So began a TV legend. Now, Fox TV-on-DVD resurrects the show on three discs with audio commentary, subtitles, and a sprinkling of mundane featurettes. It's not really the extras I enjoyed on this DVD set - it's the twelve episodes within, which I have watched so many times I now vomit snappy one-liners. But the ability to bring this wonderful first season to life again and again is worth any amount of money paid, believe you me.",1148947200,,2293,4.670792079207921
1379068,4,B00004YWJE,"i have been a fan of buffy since the first episode aired March of 1995. i have to admit that the first season is quite weak in the forms of dialogue and the story, but it does get better as opposed to other shows where seasons go downhill. even though the first season is not that good, i love every minute of the corny one liners and silly episodes of evil book demons having online relationships with a girl.

the dvd quality is very good, i feel as if i just watched it for the first time. the dark lighting of the show that i loved back when it first aired is present (as opposed to the newer seasons that seemed to have this crisp lighter feeling i disliked).",1148515200,,664,4.147286821705427
1379069,5,B00004YWJE,"I will start off by stating that when I first heard about BTVS I was not interested. This is when it was aired on TV. I thought the movie was soso and questioned why any station would want to do a series. I watched the first season of buffy starting in Janury 06. My nephew actually wanted this for X-mas and when he was finished I found myself bored and asked to borrow it to pass the time. Well guess what I was hooked! and I got my little sister hooked too. The stories where great! and I love SMG, I can not see any other female having played Buffy and Angel, My GOD! he's was soooo sooo fine! Just yummy. Anyway I will say that I went on to buy the entire 7 seasons of Buffy and all 5 of Angel. Yes for the folks that are not aware, buffy had a spin off called Angel. Angel started the same year BTVS season 4 aired. I am telling you get them all. I finished both series by the end of March 06.  Yes, it was like every freaking free minute it was either Buffy or Angel. I tell you without going into major detail about each detail I will say that BTVS and Angel were one of the best shows on Televison!!! period. I can honestly say I am glad I go from one season to another becasue I think I would have lost my mind if I had to wait it out! When I finished season 1, I was like my God, how did I ever doubt this series. All I can say is I wish the series and went on longer............

1379070,3,B00004YWJE,"I didn't starting watching Buffy the Vampire Slayer until I started watching its spin-off, Angel, so I missed the first three years of the show.  Now, thanks to DVD, I can catch up on all the shows I missed.  I have to say I was unimpressed with these first few episodes.  The writing was weak and the acting was really medicore.  Fortunately, all of that improved as the show continued.  What this first season does well is set up the mythology of the slayer and the watchers.  It introduces the Master Vampire, Darla (who really came into her own on Angel), and of course Angelus himself.  What did not really work in this first season are the sidekicks.  I was never a big fan of Xander throughout the life of the show, but Willow was always a favorite.  However, the Willow of this first season is a far cry from the mega-witch Willow of later seasons.  Sometimes it was hard to watch.  I'm kind of glad I didn't watch this series when it first aired.  Based on this set of episodes I probably wouldn't have stayed, let alone returned for a second season.  Fortunately, I came into Buffy later in its run and I can now watch these first episodes with the knowledge that it will be so much better.",1148256000,,1200,4.4
1379071,4,B00004YWJE,"When this season was on TV, of course I was much younger, and the 1st episode I ever watched was Teacher's Pet, and I was confused, because I loved the movie, and she is a vampire slayer, why was she fighting a she-mantis, so I didn't watch it after that.  My mother recorded the Welcome to the Hellmouth episode for me, after watching that I was hooked, now I see that it was nice that they put more demons in it, its awesome. Even though the acting is kinda lame, this season is still good. I don't know what that one person was talking about not having special features because it even says special features before you watch every episode, look for it. It has commentary on Welcome to the Hellmouth, The Harvest, Angel, and the Puppet Show by Joss Whedon.  Sarah Michelle Gellar I think is the perfect Buffy.  My favorite episodes from this season is Welcome to the Hellmouth, Angel, and Prophecy Girl, I even got a little emotional when she didn't want to die.  The clown in nightmares shocked and scared me where I ran out of the room screaming because Im scared to death of clowns, so all clowns haters be careful. All in all a good season, gets you into the story of Buffy's life, but wasn't she a senior in the movie?? Ive always been confused about that.

1379072,5,B00004YWJE,"Season one isn't the best of ""Buffy"", but it's still pretty good in general. You get to meet the Scooby's, and see them during their earliest years. The amazing thing is to look back at season one and see how much all of them have grown as individuals and how they've changed. While Season 1 does suffer from ""monster of the week"" lameness, it's pretty clear that Buffy as a series has potential, and you get to see that in coming years. While Buffy's structure has yet to fully form with emotional conflicts and stronger season-long arc's, some of it's ideas come through. The Invisible Girl isn't Buffy's best episode, but it encompasses things like isolation of the high school experience. The pack is an apt metaphor, too. In terms of the most enjoyable episodes of the piece were ""Welcome to the Hellmouth"",""Angel"", and ""Prophecy Girl."" The villain in terms of the first season is ""The Master"", the oldest vampire alive. He doesn't really stack up to ""The Nerds"", let alone ""Spike/Dru"", ""The Mayor/Faith"", ""Angelus"". But, the most important thing about Buffy's first season is introducing to these characters. You see them at their youngest: post-valley girl Buffy, Willow before the Wicca, Giles super bookwormish not very poignant, Xander as the dorky everyguy, and Angel as the mysterious stranger. The time when Willow loved Xander, Xander was soft for Buffy, and Buffy was hot for a good vampire named Angel. The innocence, the campiness; it's all a part of Buffy's journey, and it's wonderful to look back on.",1146787200,,1520,4.895348837209302
1379073,5,B00004YWJE,"That a large television critics and television studies scholars would in 2006 consider BUFFY THE VAMPIRE SLAYER the best show in the history of television would have been seemed impossible in 1997.  I remember my response on hearing that a TV show based on a failed movie was going to debut on the WB:  ""Why?""  Why indeed.  But as time went on, the show not only built a small but passionate group of fans, it became distinguished by the quality of its fans.  And now in discussions of great TV, BUFFY is often used as the standard for determining the quality of other shows.  It has influenced many of not most of the truly great shows of the past decade.  For instance, the main creative force behind LOST, Damon Lindelhof, has cited BUFFY as the major model for what they are trying to do.  Not bad for a show for which almost anyone in January 1997 would have predicted failure.

BUFFY's influence on subsequent television has been immense and is likely to go down as one of the crucial shows in TV history because of what it has spawned both in what television can do with long narrative and in the influence it has had on the depiction of women on TV.  Indeed, I believe that eventually the history of women on TV will be told in terms of pre- and post-BUFFY.  There simply were no strong female heroes before BUFFY.  Granted, a diminutive former cheerleader turned vampire slayer is utterly unrealistic, but what people don't often remark on is how unrealistic similar male heroes are.  The idea of a physically powerful female is no sillier than Superman, Batman, Spiderman, Kane, Kato, Billy Jack, Data, the Green Hornet, or what have you.  For some reason, TV tolerated impossibly empowered male characters but refused similarly empowered women.  A quick checklist of female heroes before and after BUFFY brings the point home vividly.  Before BUFFY there is the great Emma Peel in THE AVENGER, Wonder Woman, the Six Million Dollar Woman, and Dana Scully in THE X-FILES.  There was also Xena, who came after the BUFFY movie but before the TV show, but which also seems to have exerted no influence on the shows that came after it, all of whose creators credited BUFFY as their inspiration.  After BUFFY, however, we get Aeryn Sun in FARSCAPE, Max Guevara in DARK ANGEL, Sydney Bristow in ALIAS, River Phoenix in FIREFLY and the film SERENITY, Pez on WITCHBLADE, and Veronica Mars on VERONICA MARS.  One could probably add a host of other characters as well, such as Kate on LOST, Jaye Tyler on WONDERFALLS, and Georgia Lass on DEAD LIKE ME.  Buffy Summers created a whole new world of possibilities for women on TV.

BUFFY also has had a vast impact on television narrative.  I believe that BUFFY is the fourth of four immensely influential television shows on how TV shows handle narrative.  The first was HILL STREET BLUES, the show that introduced the multiple story thread format to TV.  Next was TWIN PEAKS, which introduced the idea of a dominant narrative that structures a show as a whole and sees no short-term resolution.  THE X-FILES took TWIN PEAKS's idea of narrative and extended it over several years through the telling of their alien colonization arc.  Finally, BUFFY continues THE X-FILES's practice of stretching narratives over several seasons, but centered the narrative on character development and introduced the idea of a master narrative for each individual season.  Since a vast number of shows in the past decade have either been directly influenced by BUFFY or influenced by shows that BUFFY influenced, one could argue that contemporary multi-episode narrative has largely been made possible by BUFFY.  Shows like SIX FEET UNDER, THE GILMORE GIRLS, LOST, ALIAS, FARSCAPE, and many others have directly credited BUFFY for narrative inspiration.

Season One of BUFFY is very good, but does not give any hints about just how great it would become in Season Two.  I read recently an article on the Internet about Season Two of THE SOPRANOS, arguing that it was in its second Season that the show got truly great, and explicitly mentioned BUFFY as the other greatest Season Two on TV.  I think there is some truth to this, though I would argue that Season One of THE SOPRANOS was better than Season One of BUFFY (though I prefer BUFFY as a whole).  There are multiple reasons that Season One of BUFFY wasn't as good as what was to follow.  First, it was a very low budget show.  Almost everything in Season One was done on the cheap, and this comes out in the quality of the production.  Second, Joss Whedon had worked exclusively as a writer prior to BUFFY, and while he was a very good one, he still had to learn to produce and direct in addition to writing.  So, there was a learning curve involved.  Nonetheless, even though the show wasn't as good as it would be in Season Two, this is a striking debut season.  There are some weak episodes, but from the very first episode there are a host of striking moments.  There are a host of marvelously well-written moments, especially dialogue, which has always been a Whedon strongpoint (before BUFFY he was a highly regarded script doctor, paid to take scripts lacking pizzazz and spicing them up).  The episodes were filled with glorious dramatic or action moments, but always also by great comic twists.  In the high school years of BUFFY, especially in Season One, the scripts were largely structured around metaphor.  The school was literally built on the mouth to hell, which expressed the idea that for many high school is like being in hell.  One episode deals with the negative effects of group behavior through focusing on a group of students who are turned into a pack of wild animals.  Another deals with a girl so ignored in school that she eventually becomes invisible.  Personally, I was never a huge fan of the metaphorical episodes, but a number of people found them compelling.

The most important achievement of Season One in my opinion is the assembling of a core group of characters-Buffy, her best friend Willow, Xander, the vampire with a soul Angel, the school Queen B Cordelia, and Buffy's watcher Giles-and establishing the central pretense of the show.  From the very beginning we are confronted with a beautiful young girl who was happy being a cheerleader, future homecoming queen, and social butterfly, but who lost all that when presented with her new destiny:  she was her generations new vampire slayer.  Gradually, the tragic ramifications of that would become clearer, for one became a vampire slayer only when the previous slayer died.  And you would then be the slayer until you died.  So while it is cool that Buffy has super strength and agility and recuperative abilities, but she is cut off from the life that she wanted and confronted with the fact that there might not be much point in her planning for much of a future.  Buffy doesn't want to be the slayer; she wants to be popular and have fun.  Instead of being a cheerleader, she has to hunt and kill demons.  What is most compelling about the show is how this young woman over seven seasons struggles with this fate that she did not seek and responsibilities that she can't pass on to others.  There is a sadness that runs through the show.

While I truly believe BUFFY is the best show in the history of TV, this is not among the greatest first seasons ever.  It is not as good, for instance, as the first season of ALIAS or LOST or 24.  But from small things great things may come.  What I tell people watching BUFFY for the first time is that if you like Season One of BUFFY, you will utterly love everything that comes later.  And now that it is priced to own, there is not reason not to get it.",1146268800,7,7680,4.687313432835821
1379074,4,B00004YWJE,This is such a great season and I love BTVS. Such a great show. It has plenty of action and some very shocking scenes.

1379075,4,B00004YWJE,"Season 1 of Buffy was the birth of awesomeness of that show.  It rocked.  It was cutting edge for the time, and reminded me of when I used to be excited to watch tv.  Viva the hellmouth!",1141862400,,186,3.972972972972973
1379076,4,B00004YWJE,"Season 1 of BTVS is often maligned for its cheap production values and effects, muddy look, and often cheesy stories (Not campy! Creator Joss Whedon hates camp.) But you must remember that Whedon was operating on a shoestring budget then. A series based on a failed feature film - with one of the most improbable titles ever conceived - did not motivate the networks to open up the coffers and dump money into it. It's shot on 16mm film (just a notch above the old home movie cameras) and this is awfully apparent in the nighttime sequences. I have no problem with all these quirks.

The only downside of the first season is that Whedon and his writing team were still exploring the possibilities of the show. BTVS's one-sentence description - A metaphorical depiction of high school life and female empowerment - left things wide open for material. The initial detours into weekly monsters in mediocre getups were still a bit too literal and the season-long villain arc was forced at times, but there were moments of brilliance peeking through with each successive episode. Glimpses of future character dynamics and the slayer mythos were taking hold by this season's end and would absolutely blast off early in the next. And the patented Whedonesque dialogue sprinkled with pop culture quips and character-based syntax gets started even sooner.

Season 1 is not among the best seasons (I think 3 is best, followed closely by 2) but it's certainly a necessary part of the Buffyverse. You can't fully experience the other six without it.",1140652800,4,1537,4.885057471264368
1379077,4,B00004YWJE,"During its seven seasons on the air - the first five on The WB, the last two on UPN - ""Buffy the Vampire Slayer"" garnered more devoted fans than you can shake a stake at.  The show's surprising plot twists, lovable characters, immense originality and wonderful wit are enough to draw in anyone - that is, if you make it past the show's campy title.  Sadly, many people heard the title and assumed that ""Buffy"" was a campy horror series - but now, thanks to DVD, you can shed your assumptions and watch the entire magnificent series from start to finish.

The season begins with high school sophomore Buffy Summers (Sarah Michelle Gellar) moving to the seemingly calm and quiet town of Sunnydale, California.  After the ordeal depicted in the '92 film of the same name, Buffy just wants to live a normal life, free from battling the undead.  But, as she discovers in the two-part pilot episodes ""Welcome to the Hellmouth"" and ""The Harvest"", she cannot escape her destiny as The Slayer - one girl chosen in every generation to battle the vampires, the demons, the unholy.  This time around, though, Buffy has friends to help her in her battle: wisecracking Xander (Nicholas Brendon), shy computer geek Willow (Alyson Hannigan), popular drama queen Cordelia (Charisma Carpenter), and Buffy's Watcher (a sort of mentor and guardian for the Slayer), droll Englishman Rupert Giles (Anthony Stewart Head).  Buffy also meets the handsome and mysterious Angel (David Boreanaz), who is not what he seems ...

""Buffy""'s first season is an interesting one indeed.  It's hardly as brilliant as the seasons that followed; when compared to the rest of the show, it's a sort of lame appetizer.  But this season is far from bad.  Some of the highlights of the season are the aforementioned two-part opener, ""Welcome to the Hellmouth"" and ""The Harvest""; Buffy's date with a 'normal' guy in ""Never Kill a Boy on the First Date""; ""Nightmares"", in which everyone's nightmares become reality; and the season finale, ""Prophecy Girl"", Joss Whedon's directorial debut.  Probably the season's finest episode is ""Angel"", the classic ep. in which Buffy discovers the truth about who - and what - Angel really is.  Of course, this season also has its share of bad episodes (most of the show's worst episodes are in this season).  Chief among these is ""The Pack"", in which Xander and a group of mischievous teens are possessed by the spirits of demonic hyenas.

Joss Whedon, worshipped as a God by fans of his work - primarily ""Buffy"" and ""Firefly"" - hadn't yet been given full control of the show, as these 12 episodes were filmed as a mid-season replacement.  Because of this, this season is perhaps a little campy and certainly not on par with the seasons which followed.  Season one of ""Buffy the Vampire Slayer"" is a good start to one of the best - if not THE best - TV shows of all-time.  I'd highly recommend that you pick it up and give it a try; if you make it to Season Two, you won't regret it.

Buffy Season One is taking the television series from the movie of the same name. Since it is the first season, it contains less episodes than the normal 22 of all the other seasons, it has only 12. This is because they shot it before they pitched it.

The episodes:

Ep. 1: Welcome to the Hellmouth

 16 year old buffy transfers to Sunnydale, but the librarian, Giles, haunts her about her destiny about being the Slayer.

Ep. 2: The Harvest

 The Master, villian of this season, reveals his true intentions.

Ep. 3: Witch

 Buffy tries out for cheerleading, but a curse seems to befall the entire squad.

Ep. 4: Teacher's Pet

 A substitute teacher seems to get all the boys attentions, with horrific results.

Ep. 5: Never Kill a boy on the first date

 Buffy gets a date, and then falls into a vampire plot.

Ep. 6: The Pack

 A clique of mean teens get Xander involved when they are possessed by hyenas.

Ep. 7: Angel

 Buffy gets close to Angel, only to find herself torn when she discovers his terrible secret and past.

Ep. 8: I robot, you jane.

 Willow chats with an internet date, but what does it have to do with the demonology book she scanned?

Ep. 9: The Puppet Show

 Someone is killing talent show contestants, and the ventriloquist act is mighty suspicious.

Ep. 10: Nightmares

 Everyones nightmares are real, and only the Slayer can stop them.

Ep. 11: Out of mind, out of sight

 An unpopular girl turns invisible and seeks revenge on the 'In' crowd.

Ep. 12: Prophecy Girl

 A prophecy foretells buffy's death, but she shows down the Master anyway.

On disc one, is a few special features, including an interview with Whedon and Boreanaz. Also, Whedon does a commentary on the Pilot, although his commentary is mostly him watching, with a few bits of info. A pilot script, and trailer round it out. Disc 2 features a photo gallery and another interview with Whedon. And finally, disc 3 contains biographies for the cast and a final interview with Whedon.

This season does little more than set up the characters, set the tone and theme of the series, and gives us a taste of the Hellmouth/High School connection. The major plot device is the use of the master as a villian that reappears thru out. However, in Dragonball fashion, he is finished within the whole season.

I gave it one less star than it deserved because it is the pilot season, and thus the quality, quantity and feel is compromised.

Overall, this is a good first season, but compared to the rest of the seasons (what with a bigger budget, better sound and audio, and more features) this one is required rather than requested. Overall, I say buy the Chosen Collection, and get them all at once. Watch this one, move to Season 2, then never speak of it again.",1138147200,6,2985,4.533834586466165
1379081,5,B00004YWJE,"Having had a couple of years to mull over the final episode of ""Buffy the Vampire Slayer"" and how it fulfilled Joss Whedon's mission statement for the series, I have been reconsidering the show's first season in terms of how it set the foundation for everything that was to come.  If you have seen the original theatrical movie version of ""BtVS,"" then you have probably noticed how the words are clearly Whedon's, but the tone is not.  Given a rare opportunity for a second chance to realize his vision, the first season establishes the following points for contemplation.  You will note that they are based more on comparisons to the theatrical film than the series finale, because that ended up being the more pertinent analog:

(1) The most important factor that gives the television series more depth than the movie is clearly the character of Angel (David Boreanaz), although the creation of the Scooby Gang is huge as well. But even more impressive than the fact that a vampire with a soul is in love with the Slayer is the fact that Joss Whedon holds off on this revelation until the seventh episode (""Angel""). For the first six episodes Angel was Mystery Guy, Stealth Guy, Cryptic Guy, and then in the first truly memorable moment of the series, Buffy learns the truth as Angel's face morphs in her bedroom. Creating these star-crossed lovers is where this television series start an operatic story arc that culminates in ""Becoming: Part II,"" the show's zenith.

(2) Related to this is the Master (Mark Metcalf) story arc that defines the first season. Each subsequent season of Buffy has similarly been defined by a pair of story arcs, usually dividing the season in half: Season 2 starts with Spike & Dru and then Angelus takes over in the second half. Of course, this helps set up the thrilling season finales each year as the Master/Angelus/Mayor/Adam/Glory meets their fate. But it also means that throughout the season things are brewing and building. In other words, the order of the episodes matters.

(3) As Joss Whedon has often told us, the subtext of ""BtVS"" is that High School is Hell. I was surprised that over half the episodes from the First Season dealt primarily with the horrors of going to high school, as opposed to expanding the Buffy mythos. Living up to the unreasonable expectations of parents (""Witch""), having a crush on a teacher (""Teacher's Pet""), school cliques (""The Pack""), meeting someone on the internet (""I Robot, You Jane""), facing your worst fears (""Nightmares""), being ignored by everybody (""Out of Mind, Out of Sight""), and even just trying to go out on a date (""Never Kill a Boy On the First Date"") are dealt with in Season One.

(4) The final obvious strength of the show would be the characters and the actors playing them. Willow (Allyson Hannigan) might by the all-time best Best Friend, and watching the character grow over the years has been fascinating. Poking fun at the pomposity of Giles (Anthony Stewart Head) never grows old, but I have to admit that I think Xander (Nicholas Brendon) is the [punch line] of way too many jokes. Then again, one of the show's masterstrokes is that Cordelia (Charisma Carpenter), who represents everything about high school that the others hate, gets dragged into being a member of the gang. It is also clear in retrospect that Joss Whedon's knows how to use the characters and acting talent he stumbles across. Elizabeth Anne Allen (Amy Madison), Robia LaMorte (Jenny Calendar), and Mercedes McNab (Harmony) are all introduced in first season episodes and brought back for even greater fun in future episodes.

Watching the first season episodes of ""Buffy the Vampire Slayer"" makes it clear that the show certainly started strong. Yes, there are some efforts that could be a lot better: my groaner is ""Teacher's Pet"" although others have problems with ""Witch,"" ""I Robot, You Jane"" and ""Out of Mind, Out of Sight."" But all of those episodes suffer in part because they are the farthest removed from the core of the Buffy mythos. But the ""Welcome to the Hellmouth/The Harvest"" pilot, ""The Pack,"" ""Angel"" and ""Prophecy Girl"" are first-rate efforts, and that's a third of the initial season right there. However, as soon as you watch ""When She Was Bad,"" the first episode from Season Two, it is clear that the show had gotten a LOT better. So I would really give Season One 4.5 stars, which rounds up on the strength of Sarah Michelle Gellar's performance and especially her ""I don't want to die"" speech in ""Prophecy Girl."" Killing Buffy only makes her stronger.",1137888000,5,4550,4.831835686777921

Yes, The first season has all 12 episodes (10 less than any other season). Although the box is nice for someone who wants to see the origin of Buffy, at least on Television, I think that this boxset is just not as impressive as the others. I supose ,however, that, although there are NO SPECIAL FEATURES, It's the only way you can see the first season, unless you want to buy the All Season set that is now out, and on Amazon. Also Buffy is on every morning at Seven (eastern time) on FX.",1136592000,2,8678,5.266909090909091
1379083,5,B00004YWJE,Joss Whedon is purely genius in creating a series tailored to those in and out of high school. Buffy is dealing with normal teenage issues along side fighting the Sunnydale's demons and vamps. The first season is excellent and lures you to watch one episode after another.,1136160000,2,272,4.808510638297872
1379084,5,B00004YWJE,"There are not many television shows that have garnered my interest the way Buffy The Vampire Slayer did. Having seen Joss Whedon's initial film ""Buffy The Vampire"", I didn't know what to expect from the series when it came along. However after the first episode of the season, I'm sure you will be hooked as well. While season 1 of the show might not be its deepest strongest effort, it definitely shows how much potential the show initially had, and how amazing it would become in later seasons (particularly 2 and 3). Although much of the season focuses around the Buffy's life in high school after moving to Sunnydale, none of the episodes lack the strength of any that would come later. Buffy fans need take heed and pick this up immediately.

Most of the major characters and themes in the story are set in the first season. The introduction of characters like Angel, Willow, Xander, Giles, Buffy and Cordelia all give hints to what will come in later seasons (especially in the case of the romance between Buffy and Angel). It has been said before that a lot of the Buffy mythos was not explained in the initial season, and that most of the story focuses around the life of a high school student who must balance her time between her slaying duties and the pressures of everyday teenage life. This is entirely true. While the story does focus more on high school, that does not detract from the plot a bit. In fact after watching seminal episodes like ""Welcome To The Hellmouth"" or ""Prophecy Girl"", it would be hard to write this off as just another teenage drama. The horror element adds amazing depth to the story. Whedon did a masterful job incorporating two completely opposite worlds with ""Buffy The Vampire Slayer"" (the horror one, and the teenage drama one). Things which happened in the first season were continued up until the very last episode, so in essence season one sets the foundation for the amazing things that would follow. The acting is altogether amazing, and the cast, while somewhat small and overlooked, does a stellar job with their parts. Sarah Michelle Gellar gives perfect life to the series' heroine as she displays the odd quirkiness and disposition of Buffy. Willow (Allison Hannigan) and Xander (Nicolas Brendan) are the perfect best friends to the leading lady (and each only get better as the story progresses). The only detraction is that the first season is only 12 episodes in length, making it very short. However understand that ""BtVS"" replaced a show mid season. That's the reason for its short airing. Besides that there is not one problem with the set or its episodes. The commentaries and extras such as outtakes, bloopers and more, are all welcomed additions to this already great set.

It's really kind of disappointing that after 7 seasons Buffy was finally ended. What's more disappointing is that stellar shows like Angel and Roswell both met similar fates. If you never got into ""Buffy The Vampire Slayer"" while it was playing on tv, but you maybe had interest in the movie, or in horror or drama, then this is the series for you. I would also recommend Buffy's counterpart series ""Angel"", and Jason Katim's ""Roswell"" as well. No matter when you started watching Buffy, season one is essential viewing for all fans. This is a great DVD set from one of the greatest television shows to ever be aired, and unfortunately we will not be getting anymore fragments of the story. Good thing we have still 144 episodes and 7 seasons to satisfy us!",1134864000,2,3493,4.752883031301483
1379085,5,B00004YWJE,"I saw this show from the first episode and it hooked me forever about one half hour into the pilot.  Buffy had just mistaken Cordelia for a vampire (who could really blame her for that mistake?) and thrown her up against a wall at The Bronze.  Cordelia exclaims, ""What is your childhood trauma?!""  EVERY other show ever made in the history of tv would have had that line written to be the standard, boring ""What is your problem?""  That's when I knew this show was different, special, better than anything that had come before - and I never missed a single episode from that point through episode 144, the series finale.  And I was never disappointed.  From the very beginning, BtVS turned horror, comedy, and drama conventions on their heads and never looked back.  This first season wasn't as polished or perfected as succeeding seasons of the show, but it was still groundbreaking television.  In fact, while the stories in it were less polished, season one may actually be the most important season of the series.  The events of season one have repurcussions that carry through the series all the way to the end (one of the great things about the show is its adherence to its own history).

I love going back and seeing where the scooby gang were when they started. For example, seeing the insecure and geeky Willow and knowing the power that she'll eventually discover.

1379101,5,B00004YWJE,"The brainchild of writer Joss Whedon, Buffy The Vampire Slayer originally entered American pop culture as a full-length feature film, starring Kristy Swanson, in 1992. But creator Whedon felt that the project never quite did justice to the full scope of his vision, so he managed turn the film into a television series in 1997. The result of Whedon's increased artistic freedom is a series that has enjoyed both critical acclaim and audience notoriety. Nominated for 14 Emmy's during its seven year run, the show managed to win only two (both in 1998 for Outstanding Makeup and Outstanding Music Composition in a television series). Yet, the true success for Buffy The Vampire Slayer is indicated by the massive success of the show's long run, strong DVD sales, and the overwhelming success of the series spin-off Angel...

Sarah Michelle Gellar plays the title role of Buffy Anne Summers, a teenage girl who stands alone among her generation as the ""chosen one"" able to ""stand against vampires, demons, and the forces of darkness. She is the Slayer..."" But Buffy is not alone in fulfilling her destiny as a slayer of vampires. She also receives help from the high school librarian, Rupert Giles (Anthony Stewart Head), who is a Watcher - the one chosen to train and guide slayers on their developmental path. In addition, new friends Willow Rosenberg (Alyson Hannigan - of American Pie fame) and Xander Harris (Nicholas Brendon) quickly uncover the truth of Buffy's destiny, and they often aid her in defending the world against evil forces...

The Buffy the Vampire Slayer (Season 1) DVD offers a number of exciting episodes including the series premiere ""Welcome to the Hellmouth"" in which Buffy and her mother arrive in Sunnydale, California, trying to escape their past. But Buffy quickly learns from the school librarian that the small town sits atop a ""hellmouth"" about to bring forth a master vampire. When her secret is revealed to new friends Willow and Xander, the three must work together to keep the master vampire from using his vessel to enter their reality... Other notable episodes from Season 1 include ""The Harvest"" in which Buffy prepares to face down the master vampire's henchmen so she can stop the harvest (a ceremony which will free the Master), and ""I Robot, You Jane"" in which Buffy and the Scooby gang discover a demon trapped in the school's computer network...

A her freinds that know about the slayer thing (Willow, Xander, Cordy) and oh, yeah Angel (you'll find out!).

This season isn't as long as all the other the seasons but must-watch to see the real coming together of the scoobies and the introduction of Buffy. I admit, some of the demons were pretty cheesy (or cheesier than the later ones).

This season is pretty good!!!",1112572800,,623,4.706422018348624
1379103,4,B00004YWJE,"Wow, Joss Whedon is truly amazing with his work. Now obviously this is not the best Season. But still better than most of the stuff out there.

Buffy Summers used to be popular back in LA. But she burned down the school gym, (Because of vampires) and got kicked out. So she and her mother relocate (Her mom and dad are divorced) to Sunnydale. So it's no suprise that she goes to Sunnydale High. But unfortanatley there is a Hellmouth right underneath the school. Which makes very wierd things happen. She gets there and makes friends with Willow and Xander. (These are the other two main characters in this series.) But she also meets snobish, popular Cordelia Chase. (Who actually becomes quite enjoyable in the Spinoff Series Angel.) She also gets a Watcher, Giles, who is the school Librarian. Also Angel, a vampire with a soul, plays a big part in this Season, but more in Season 2. The character that I like the best though is Willow, her story is so well written, and plotted in this Season, and the upcoming seasons. From her doing magic, to it becoming an addiction that would lead her to try to destroy the world. To her becoming gay. Anyway this is a great starting season, that is much needed to understand other seasons.",1111449600,4,1232,4.574660633484163
1379104,4,B00004YWJE,"I've been known to knock Buffy over the past few years, but here's a dirty little secret: I regularly followed the series throughout its first four seasons.  I was one of the maybe 10 people nationwide who actually watched the premiere episode on its March 1997 airdate, and while I wasn't knocked out, I was entertained enough that I continued watching the show for the next four years.  It was only later that I got sick of the show (a story for another day), but I guess you could say that, despite its weaknesses, Season 1 of Buffy was strong enough to make me a fan of the series.

So why do I knock Buffy these days?  Mostly because of the impact it had on other TV programs, particularly ""Alias.""  Buffy takes place in a fantasy world, with vampires and monsters and ""chosen ones,"" and that's fine, because these things are accepted in this fantasy world.  However, when a series like ""Alias,"" which is supposed to be more realistic, starts having its main character fend off multiple attackers with stunt-doubled high-kicks and also discovers she herself is a ""chosen one,"" I begin to have problems.  There are other reasons I've made fun of Buffy over the past few years, but, having just re-watched the first season, I've realized they're all moot.  Buffy is a fun show, one that never takes itself too seriously (unlike ""Alias""), and entertainment is its prime directive.

 Everyone will tell you the same thing: Season 1 is good, but Buffy gets much better later on.  That's true, but there's no need to dampen Season 1's entertainment value.  Each first season episode pretty much operates like a ""monster of the week"" special, and there are no season-long arcs, like we'd get in later seasons.  Instead, this season focuses on setting up the characters, the stories, and the strange hellmouth that Sunnydale rests on.  Comedy is more important than most anything else, and even the martial arts sequences, which the show soon became known for, are a bit underdeveloped.  In a way, each of these Season 1 episodes are like an amateur director's first film: a bit awkward at times, a little rough around the edges, but always full of energy.

The two-part pilot is probably the best of the bunch, and if I remember it right, it was actually a two-hour premiere back in the day, but here on disc it's presented as two separate episodes.  Written by series creator Joss Whedon (who didn't start to direct until later in the season), you can tell the producers had some time to film this episode, as it features more set-ups, pans, fades, and other assorted directorial ""tricks"" than later Season 1 episodes.  Proving again how quickly this season moves, our entire cast of characters is introduced within a handful of minutes; these are the people who will carry the show for seven seasons, and in no time at all we've met them and know how they work.  An impressive bit of storytelling that just about any screenwriter could learn from.  Beyond that, this episode works like a film in itself, introducing the Master, Season 1's main villain.

The other episodes this season are a bit scattered, some strong (""Angel""), some weak (""I Robot, You Jane"").  Since Buffy was a mid-season replacement, there are only 12 episodes, and The Master doesn't feature into the season's grander scheme as later main villains would.  Instead, he mostly sulks in his lair, awaiting the season finale; not your most compelling villain.  There are episodes that spotlight Buffy's circle of friends, like ""The Pack,"" which features Xander descending into hyena territory (a good episode, other than those VERY annoying hyena-cries Xander and pals keep making), and ""Out of Sight, Out of Mind,"" which adds more depth to snooty Cordelia (and also has a nice Beatles reference in the final shot).

The cast is strong, stronger than any low-budget supernatural/comedy thriller should be entitled to.  Whedon and his co-producers were either lucky or blessed when they pieced this cast together.  If you only judge Sarah Michelle Gellar from feature film debacles like ""Practical Magic"" or ""Scooby-Doo,"" then you don't know what this talented actress is capable of.  Like most others, during Season 1's initial airing it was Willow who appealed to me, but watching these episodes again, I found Buffy much more appealing, which was no doubt due to Gellar's portrayal and talents.  And that's not even getting into the physical aspect!  Seriously though, in later seasons Buffy was a bit more fierce and grim (sort of like a young Linda Hamilton), but in these first season episodes she's the definition of nubile.  She's also a bit more high-spirited, something that was lost later on.  I can safely say that most guys watching this season will find themselves falling hard for Ms. Summers/Gellar.

The rest of the cast is just as great: there's Alyson Hannigan as Willow, every fanboy's dream girl.  A living Japanimation character, the fan community accepted her with open arms.  This season doesn't give her the chance to show off her acting chops like later seasons would, but she's impressive and likeable regardless.  Nicholas Brendon is Xander Harris, my favorite character on the show (until Spike arrives, that is), but on my recent rewatching of the season, I didn't like him as much as before.  Maybe that's because I realized Xander (and, to an extent, just about every other character on the show) talks and acts just like Chandler from ""Friends.""  Do a side-by-side comparison, and you'll see what I mean.  Joss Whedon is worshiped by some for his gift for dialog and storytelling, but in many ways, he apparently lifted a LOT from the character of Chandler.

Next we have Anthony Stewart Head as the stuffy Watcher Giles, and he's great here, but again gets more opportunity in later seasons.  Then there's Charisma Carpenter as Cordelia; funny character, good acting, but a mere shadow of what the character would later become.  And on top of that, Carpenter looks nothing like a teenager, I don't know who the producers thought they were fooling.  Finally we have David Boreanaz as Angel.  The funny thing here is how much more interesting and impressive this actor/character became over the following years, because honestly Boreanaz isn't that strong of an actor this first time out, and his character as well soon was given a lot more depth.

Visually, the show looks pretty good.  Even though it was shot on 16mm film, the lighting and cinematography are so professional and well-done that you'd never notice.  The sets are a bit cheap at times, as are the special effects and monster makeup, but not so bad as to ruin your enjoyment of the show.  The soundtrack is low-budget as well; most of it sounds like it was recorded on a demo keyboard at the local RadioShack.

The DVD release is fullscreen, but as Whedon has constantly pointed out, Buffy was framed for fullscreen presentation throughout its seven-season run.  So in other words, Buffy in fullscreen is the way the show was intended to be seen.  There's some grain on the print, and some of the night scenes are murky, but this is the fault of the 16mm source print, rather than a DVD flaw.  The extras are passable, if a bit bareboned.  Whedon provides commentary for the first two episodes, relating all sorts of information about the series.  However, it sort of sounds like he's trying to suppress a belch throughout, which is disturbing.  There are also some interviews with Whedon and Boreanaz, as well as a few features with Whedon talking about the individual episodes.  No deleted scenes or making-of documentaries; that doesn't come until later season boxsets.

Like I said above, despite the low-budget limitations in its first season, Buffy is still a legitimately entertaining and high-spirited series, and I can't think of any other show, other than the Simpsons, that tried so hard to maintain and reward its fan base over the course of its run.  Give Buffy a try.  Regardless of your reservations, you'll more than likely find yourself hooked on it, and you can rest assured that the series just gets better and better.  And this is coming from a guy who generally can't stand monster/vampire flicks.",1110153600,,8183,4.865703971119133
1379105,4,B00004YWJE,"With the creation and elaboration of the ""Buffyverse,"" Joss Whedon proved himself to be one of the most talented auteurs working in television today.  ""Buffy the Vampire Slayer"" and the subsequent and equally entertaining spin-off ""Angel"" postulates a world that is pervaded by the supernatural.  Buffy Summers (Sarah Michelle Gellar), an otherwise normal high school girl, is the current incarnation of the Slayer, a superpowerful force for good that always takes the form of a young woman.  Along with her friends Xander (Nicholas Brendon) and Willow (Allyson Hannigan), her mentor Giles (Anthony Stewart Head), her mysterious boyfriend Angel (David Boreanaz), and the venomous Cordelia (Charisma Carpenter), she struggles with the forces of darkness and adolescence in equal measure.

No program has ever done a better job of mixing thrills, comedy and genuine drama.  I remove a star from the first season simply to give myself somewhere to go later, when Whedon had finished assembling a core of writers who thoroughly understood his concept, and the show reached its creative heights.  Standout episodes include ""Welcome to the Hellmouth"" (the series premiere that introduces Buffy to her new school), ""Angel"" (which reveals a devastating secret about her mysterious paramour), ""Puppet Show"" (a hilarious and creepy episode about a living ventriloquist's dummy and some mysterious murders), and ""Prophecy Girl"" (the season finale that resolves the Master story arc)./",1109376000,2,1473,5.524444444444445
1379106,1,B00004YWJE,"Looking in hindsight, it's a miracle that this show was not cancelled after the atrociously bad first season. What do we have here, after all? A show led by an annoying soap opera diva ""star"" who is not half as talented as she believes herself to be; a show full of negative energy, bad influences, plot holes larger than evertyhting you've ever imagined (for instance, once Buffy used a ROCKET LAUNCHER INSIDE A MALL - and this was not even big news!!), a perfectly normal, young and brilliant character (Willow), who the writers turned GAY for the sake of nothing! (nothing against gays, it was simply not necessary). And the reason she became gay is because she lost the love of a guy who could not even bother to speak! (the werewolf Seth Green).

But the plot holes are the real annoying thing. Suspension of desbelief won't make you forget them, because they are the essence of the show itself! It seem Joss Whedon made fun of all of the fans since the beginning. How, I repeat, HOW could Sunnydale High reamins open with people being killed by THE DOZENS inside it? There was no amount of police or Mayor's influence that could keep this secret. From teachers, to students, to coaches, to cleaning guys, a LOT of people died inside that school, all of them in a very violent mammer (in one episode, a guy kills his school budy because he's under influence of a demon who is inside the Internet... and he does it in a way to look like suicide - evil, evil, evil...) And, come next day, no one cares about nothing. Parents don't argue the authorities about what's happening (in ""GO FISH"", four students become monstruous fihes and disappears forever, wehen they go happily swimming into the ocean - what happened to their partens, their loved ones, the ones who cared about them?!!)

Also we have a guy called Xander capable of leaving his future wife at the altar, only beacue he has ""doubts"". We also have sadistic writers who are capable of making the aforementioned main character (Xander) loses one eye for the sake of absolutely nothing at the final season.

We have Cordelia Chase, who, even after being saved dozens of times by the heroe of the show, still treats her with contempt, as if she was a freak. By the way, look how Buffy dresses in high school. She lives with a divorced mother (and the show makes it clear that his father is very absent), and she dresses like a queen, everyday with clothes more expensive than the other. How silly and vain is that?!! Even Cordelia doesn't dress this way!

Also, where are the parents? It seems every adult in this show is bad, useless and mean. Be it The Watcher Counsil. the school principal, whatever.

All in all, this show is stupid, mean and ultra violent show that has only bad intentions. I cannot believe that the same Whedon that woked in TOY STORY created this horrible show.",1108252800,11,2846,4.583497053045186
1379107,5,B00004YWJE,"Buffy the Vampire Slayer the TV series began as a mid-season replacement (there are only 12 episodes in the first season) which means you're fighting for your life right off the bat. Since the creative team, primarily Joss Whedon, had to hit the ground running, for episode ideas they ruthlessly plundered every pre-existing horror concept they could lay hands on. In this first season, the episodes are much more stand alone, monster-of-the-week fests than the complex, long-term story arcs that would characterize later seasons. You either rise to such a challenge or you falter. Whedon & Co. went the former route, and in doing so, the frantic efforts of everyone involved lend this season a manic inventiveness, mixed with a certain schlockiness, that's immensely appealing.

In Season One, everyone involved with the project was willing to exploit any advantage they had to ensure the series survived. This included dressing Sarah Michelle Gellar in every lowcut, tight outfit complete with push-up bra they could find (which led Gellar to joke in an interview they were trying to morph her into Pamela Sue Anderson). Even Willow, who in later episodes would be presented as kind of dowdy until she blossomed into beauty years later, wears quite a bit of makeup in the pilot. Charisma Carpenter as Cordelia of course always looked phenomenal. And if having three great looking girls in the pilot episode was what it took to draw in male viewers, the Buffy crew was okay with that.

Episode One of Buffy the Vampire Slayer could be used as a textbook example of how to do a television pilot. Within minutes, without feeling forced or artificial, all the main characters are introduced, their personalities and the dynamics of the relationships that will carry them for years to come firmly established. Buffy Summers is an intelligent smartass desperate to leave behind her life as the ""Chosen One"". Alexander ""Xander"" Harris has the self-image of a geek (in many ways he IS a geek) but underneath that beats the heart of a noble knight and an utter willingness to be completely devoted to Buffy. Willow Rosenberg is a computer whiz with a sweet disposition, repressed sexuality, and an IQ that looks like a zip code. Joyce Summers is a stressed-out, hard working divorced mom who truly loves her daughter but only knows how to show it by being overbearing and critical to the point of cruelty. Angel is a brooding, mysterious, angst-ridden hunk with a dark past and immense - and reciprocated - attraction toward Buffy. Rupert Giles, the school librarian and Buffy's Watcher, is a veddy proper Englishman, a softspoken but demanding mentor, and supplies the father figure that Buffy, the product of a broken home, so desperately needs. Ultra-popular, ultra-beautiful, ultra-self-centered Cordelia Chase is the girl every guy wanted, and every girl hated, in high school. She serves the important function of being the one person in the entire show so insensitive, so blunt, she'll simply tell the truth as she sees it (which is spot-on an amazing amount of the time) no matter how unpleasant that truth may be. After Charisma departed Buffy for Angel, that function was served by the character of Anya, less successfully in my opinion. Anya's lack of tact was due to inexperience and ignorance of human social rules. Cordelia Chase by contrast knew she was being rude. She just didn't care. Thus her character had more edge.

There's been much written about how BtVS takes real human problems, expanding them through the device of the supernatural without ever losing the core emotional truth that people, especially adolescents, recognize and respond to. Thus in Season One we have a story about Xander being stalked by a praying mantis woman intent on mating with then dismembering him - but it's really a story about the terror of losing your virginity. We have a story about a pyromaniac witch killing cheerleaders - but it's really a story about parents trying to push their children to be just like them. We have a werewolf story (actually in this case werehyenas) - but it's really about being victimized by school bullies and finding the courage to fight back. We have a demon luring kids to their deaths Internet stalker-style - but it's really a story about wanting love so much you look for it in the wrong places. And so on.

To start with, Buffy the Vampire Slayer had a small (but fiercely loyal) band of viewers. I was one of them. These episodes will show you why we knew, from the very beginning, something great was in the process of happening - something that with Season Two would become a cultural phenomenon.",1107388800,6,4635,4.915708812260537

1379109,5,B00004YWJE,"Buffy the Vampire Slayer is the greatest show in television history. Buffy's First Season will not prove this conclusively to you, but it is required viewing before you get to the episodes and seasons which *will*.

You're probably saying to yourself ""Yeah--right. A show about vampires, called 'Buffy' for crissakes. I'm sure that'll be *really* great... if you're a twelve year old."" I mean, that's exactly what I said before I sat down to watch. But let me tell you that Buffy displays a level of intelligence and continuity that almost no other show does. The writing is in a league of its own, hitting home-runs in comedy, tragedy and suspense. The characters, despite their being fantastic (like witches and demons, etc.) are emotionally realistic and sympathetic. The acting is commendable. The direction, often top-notch. The special effects and scoring are somewhat weak in the first season, but they improve as the series progresses and eventually are quite compelling. And, above all, the storytelling is magnificent beyond compare. No other show can boast episodes like Becoming, The Body, Once More With Feeling, Who Are You, Innocent and Prophecy Girl, among others. No other show even attempts the daring of Buffy--the musical, the silence of Hush, the darkness of the sixth season or the zaniness of The Zeppo.

It's hard to back up all of these claims in a short review like this--after all, the show runs seven seasons--and it's impossible to do without spoiling things that should be surprises. But let me tell you that Buffy manages to create loveable characters that will live well beyond the series, gut-wrenching moments that will  move cynics to tears, laugh-out-loud lines that your friends will quote without end, and moral dilemmas that will get you to think, and re-think, and argue and debate and discuss.

In the end, you should go out of your way to watch this series. But don't rush because you have time; Buffy will be with us for a while. The quality of the series is such that it has already inspired spin-offs, novels, conventions and academic conferences(!). So enter, and with an open mind--the show will do the rest.",1106438400,3,2155,4.961218836565097
1379110,4,B00004YWJE,"Buffy The Vampire Slayer began it's amazing tv series with this magical first season. It may not be the best of the whole series but that's only when you compare it to the seasons that would later come. Even in the beginning anyone could see that this was the start of something truly great and special. What sets this first season from the later ones is that this one has a lot of heart. It's most visible during the incredible episode ""Angel"".

  There were a couple of episodes that weren't up to par with the rest, the worst being ""Teacher's Pet"" IMHO. But it made up for it with great episodes such as ""Angel"", ""The Pack"", ""Prophecy Girl"", ""Nightmares"" and ""Witch"".

""The Puppet Show"" is an episode that I have a problem with solely for the fact that dummies scare me. I know it's silly but hey, we all have our things. Despite that I really enjoyed ""The Puppet Show"" and the dummy turned out to be the good guy here, so that helped. People have a problem with ""Out Of Sight, Out Of Mind"" but I have to disagree with them. I loved this episode. It has a lot of depth to it when you analyze it. I know there are many teenagers facing a problem similar to Marcie's minus the the whole becoming invisible part. But feeling lonely is a part of what being a teenager sometimes is.

""I Robot, You Jane"" is such a good episode, I don't get why people complain about it. Watching it again now in the year 2005 is even funnier because of how high tech everything has become ever since that episode was first filmed and we all know that there have been some crazy cases with guys and girls alike being stalked by people they've met on the net.

  I think I must be the only person who didn't like at all ""Welcome to The Hellmouth"" and ""The Harvest"". Yes, it was what first drew me to the show when it first aired but compared to the rest of the season it just doesn't meet up.

Also...am I the only one who had a problem with the little boy who was the Annointed One? I just don't see the point of having him there. He didn't do anything, he was just there.

  The special features on this dvd aren't that special, especially when you compare them to the S.F for the other seasons. The interviews for ""Angel"" and such episodes were much to short and didn't tell us something new. In the ""Angel"" interview all Joss said was ""Here Buffy learns the truth about Angel, blah blah"" We already know that so...yeah.

I personaly enjoy all the episodes, even recognizing that season one can't hold a candle to season Five, for example (because it was the beginning, it had less budget, etc, etc).

Everyone says that subsequent seasons are better, but even Season 1 seemed pretty darned wonderful to me.

This show is a wild mix of comedy, horror, romance, and adventure.  Buffy has many of the concerns of the typical teen-aged girl while being a demon-killing superhero at the same time.  But she's not a grim, too-good-to-be-true superhero, she's a wisecracking, occasionally reluctant superhero.  I love watching a female character kick butt for a change, but it's also fun to see the characters grow and change, which they do even in the space of the first season.  Just when the comedy seems a little too dumb, something terrible happens.  Just when the horror seems a little too depressing, we get a joke.  And the relationships among the characters tie it all together.

This show is so cool that I'm amazed that Joss Whedon (the creator of the show) ever got any network to let him make this.  The thing this show reminds me of most is the ""Lord of the Rings"" movies -- there's that same small band of good people out to save the world from evil, the same sense that their love for each other is as big a part of the battle against evil as their actions, the same obsessive attention to detail and getting things right on the part of Joss Whedon that Peter Jackson brought to ""LotR.""  Since I adore LotR, this is a big compliment!

If a TV-hater like myself loves this show, just think how much those of you who LIKE TV will like it! :-)

Season one is awesome. In only twelve episodes, an amazing story unfolds. You will be come invested in the complex characters and really get into the stories told. The episodes in this season have a sort of monster of the week format mixed in with episodes about the characters (""Never Kill A Boy on the First Date,"" ""Angel""). You may be skeptical after seeing the pilot's Californian talk (""Neg"" ""Pos""), but things like that were thankfully abandoned. The writing on ""Buffy"" is actually the best I have ever seen.

1379116,5,B00004YWJE,"""Buffy the Vampire Slayer"" was a movie that was light and ""bubble-gummy"".  Then, WB introduced the world to, ""Buffy the Vampire Slayer"".  Not much of a difference there, right?  ""Buffy"" had everything, thy it be comedy, action, drama, lesbians (but only in the later seasons).  This show was well-written, and at first, poorly-recieved.  Then, like a wildfire, it spread, and now ""Buffy"" is as important to TV and the tough-girl genre as is ""Charlie's Angels"".  Sarah Michelle Gellar, here, more than ever, shows the passion that lied in the ""Buffy"" series.  The first season, in my mind, is the best season of all the others.  It showed Buffy being powerful, and a normal teenager.  The later seasons (mid-5th to 7th.  Where did Dawn come from and why is Buffy taking orders from her?) got ""bubble-gummy"" and the creators started showing the fear in Buffy, having her lose more battles, and killing her more than once.  Poor thing.  But the first season was straight-forward (i.e., cryptic message, evil prophecy, Buffy slays).  That formula worked perfectly.  The first, second, and third season all capture what was superb of this series, while the fourth and beginning of the fith only lost a tiny bit of that steam.  If you are A die-hard Buffy fan, than you probably already own the whole series.  If you are just getting into this show, buckle down.  You are in for the best TV plot ever written.  ""Buffy the Vampire Slayer"" Season 1 DVD is my most valued DVD in my collection.  And, I guarantee, once you purchase this, it will be yours as well.",1101168000,3,1553,4.749063670411985

1379118,5,B00004YWJE,"As with many other fans and reviewers, I was skeptical of a show based off of the wacky Buffy movie starring nonother than the girl who played Kendall (the chagrined daughter of Erica's rape) on All My Children.  Lucky for me, my skepticism lasted only through the opening credits of the first episode.  Instantly the audience, the network, and the creative team were able to tell they had struck gold with what would become arguably the greatest television show in TV history.

Joss Whedon's creativity, writing and (later on) directing skills all meshed together with an impecable cast that charmed the audience with their first lines.  The use of Buffy as a strong but understandably confused adolescent girl whose ""destiny"" is to slay vampires and thereby protect humankind is amazingly well done by Sarah and her writers.  Xander's goofballishness is charming enough to make you want to be his friend, but understandably annoying enough to make him unpopular at school.  Willow is the biggest nerd of all nerds who obviously needs a friends, and the scooby gang comes to fulfill that role perfectly.  Even the annoyingness of early Giles is great in this season.

Season 1 of Buffy is often the basis by which all other seasons are judged.  Not because it is necessarily the best, but because it does such a great job of allowing us to fall in love with the characters and feel like we are there with them.  The Master storyline was weak at times and utterly bone chilling at its best, but one thing is certain: by defeating the Master, Buffy proved herself to her water, her friends, and all her fans.  This is a great starting point for a show that should not be missed by anyone who considers him or herself a fan of Buffy or Sarah Michelle Gellar.",1100822400,,1756,4.705882352941177
1379119,4,B00004YWJE,"A nice beginning for a good show.  I came in late, I saw this first season when it started rerunning on FX.  Wish I had started sooner.  Compared to later seasons, sometimes I really miss the simplicity of this first one, in both the lighter tone, and the fact that you don't have to watch every episode to know what's going on. The are five main characters, Buffy, Willow, Xander, Cordelia, and Giles. One of the best things about the first season was the love triangle.  Xander has a crush on Buffy but she will never see him as more than a friend, Willow has a crush on Xander, but he will never see her as more than a friend. It's all cute and sometimes heart wrenching.  The underduse of Cordelia is one of this first season's biggest weaknesses.  Her character is mostly shallow but she's hilarious.  In retrospect, when you compare Cordelia in this season to her final appearance in the fifth season of the Buffy spinoff Angel, she may well be the most evolved character in Whedon's universe. Two episodes of note in this season that are often overlooked; ""Witch"", which has more twists and turns in the plot that you won't believe they packed it into one episode and features great performances by guest stars Elizabeth Anne Allen and Robin Riker, and ""Out of mind, out of sight"" which features an invisible girl terrorizing the school and is the first episode that shows there is more to Cordelia than meets the eye.  The extras leave something to be desired.  More commentaries and features would be nice, but Whedon's commentary on the first two episodes is both entertaing and informative.  With just 12 episodes on three disks, it is modestly priced compared to a full set, and of course it's the first season.  Creatively and financially it's a great place to start to see if the show if for you.",1099785600,5,1810,4.590062111801243

1379122,5,B00004YWJE,"First off, if you have seen the film version of ""Buffy the Vampire Slayer,"" don't hold that against this show.  This show ignores the existence of the film and starts over again (Thank God).

This 12 episode set (Buffy was a mid-season replacement) starts with Buffy Summers (the ""chosen one"" or ""vampire slayer"") moving to Sunnydale High School after being kicked out of her last high school for burning down the gym (fighting vampires of course).  There, she meets up with her new ""Watcher"" Rupert Giles, and fellow high school students Xander, Willow, and Cordellia.  Together, the gang fights the forces of evil that gather around the Hellmouth that lies under the town of Sunnydale.

What's great about this show, especially in the early seasons, is its mixture of action/drama and comedy.  The comedy is not slapstick, like in the film.  Rather, the comedy is the witty banter that occurs between all the characters.  It's never enough that you don't take the danger the characters are in seriously.  Instead, it just lightens the mood and makes you laugh.  The later seasons seemed to lose some of this wit, becoming much more darker and sinister, but the earlier seasons are free from this.  Also, the first season is a more episodic format, with each episode being a self-contained story (although if you watched them out of order, there are some references that you may not understand).  It was not until the later seasons that season-long story arcs were used that tied the whole season together.

The action is first rate in this show.  Perhaps the only thing about this show that surpasses the action is the superb writing from Joss Whedon.  If you liked Buffy on television, you should start up a DVD collection.  If you missed the show on tv, give it a chance and you won't regret it.",1098144000,6,1799,4.773462783171521

1379124,4,B00004YWJE,"Buffy the vampire slayer is one of those shows that took some time (if not long) to grow into an accomplished and truly unique series. So the first season is extremely enjoyable and entertaining at best and underdeveloped at worst. The season comprises a number of excellent, atmospheric episodes like The Pilot (Welcome to the Hellmouth), The Witch, Angel, The Puppet Show, Nightmares and the season finale (Prophecy girl) and some duds like Teacher's pet and The Pack. But still amid the meandering tone of the first season and the disappointing second rate episodes, it still shows that this is a classic in the making thanks to some intelligent scripts, original ideas, nice effects and above all interesting and endearing characters.",1098057600,2,738,5.107438016528926
1379125,4,B00004YWJE,"Joss Whedon, the writer, really shined in this, his best television series, with a great deal of talent and effort.  Though not the best season of Buffy, it has many endearing qualities that evolved to perfection in future seasons to a culmination in season three.  However, if you want to know the background of the characters, as well as see how this widely praised series has its roots, check this out.  The dialog alone is worth the price.  You won't get enough of the trendy phrases that, believe it or not, were invented by the writers and were not gathered by hanging out at local high schools.

1379126,5,B00004YWJE,"Since we are forty years old, my husband and I are hesitant to tell other people how much we love ""Buffy the Vampire Slayer,"" particularly the early-to-mid years (neither of us could ever work up much appreciation for the years when Willow became a mean lesbian witch and Joyce died and Buffy's l'il sis showed up out of nowhere, but oh well...) So it's nice to take advantage of anonymity here on the internet to say what a really quality show this is and how great it is to see it on DVD.

I think this is possibly one of the best written shows ever, in spite of some of the lugubrious camp lines like ""But we did manage to avert the Apocolypse!"" The wit is very sharp and the characters -- the good ones, anyway -- are so very likeable. The bad ones are satisfyingly creepy. And good, in the form of a ditsy blonde cheerleader, always ultimately triumphs. ""Buffy the Vampire Slayer"" is a modern morality play, well told.",1097712000,4,923,4.39766081871345

Don't be fooled by the lack of ""depth"" in comparison to latter seasons: season one's light-hearted wittiness was Buffy's greatest charm. And season one has plenty of depth and darkness - Gellar's ""I'm sixteen years old, I don't want to die"" speech in ""Prophecy Girl"" is one of the most emotional moments in the show. The bubble-gum coating - the ""campiness"" - makes Season One all the better.

I'm a fan of the earlier seasons (1-3), so Season One may not appeal to those who prefer the latter seasons. Still, I recommend this to any Buffy fan, or anyone who loves their dramas offbeat and witty.",1097452800,3,691,4.617886178861789

  Buffy Summers is the new girl at Sunnydale High.  Shes pretty clueless(if I remember correctly) why she is actually at Sunnydale.  And that, of course, is to fight vamps.  Sunnydale is actually located on the Hellmouth, which is basically a place where alot of demons reside.  She meets her watcher, Giles, the school librarian along with the quiet Willow, the comical Xander, and the snobby, yet likeable Cordelia. This is when the fun starts and Buffy begins to fight vamps and other demons.

  Some of the episodes are a little too much ill admit.  For example Teachers Pet(c'mon, it a praying mantis?).  But that isn't anyones fault. The series had just started, and was allowed to make some mistakes.

What people get confused about, is that this show is all about a girl stabbing vampires and quipping about it. There is so much more to this show and it's too bad that people dismiss it right away due to it's supernatual aspect. There is sooooo much more realism.

1379133,1,B00004YWJE,"I began watching Buffy in reruns because I really enjoy its spin-off, Angel.  I expected to see something similar to Angel, but instead found Buffy to be completely devoid of intelligence.

The characters are very flat, since all they seem to be capable of is shallow teen angst, and bad comedy.  It seems that the episodes are 90 percent one-liners, with everyone onscreen competing to say them.  The jokes are very forced, and therefore, not funny.  The only character worth watching is Cordelia.

The characters don't change, or grow very much.  If you watch the first season of Angel, the characters change quite a bit through the course of the first year.  Buffy, Xander, Giles, and Willow remain static throughout the season.  Xander is the primary example... all he is capable of doing is lusting after Buffy, which is funny for about 2 episodes.  After that, he quickly becomes very tiring.  The idea of the show is, I think, hey young people, these characters are young like you, IDENTIFY WITH THEM NOW!  Compare to Angel, which I have always felt was fine drama, that anyone could approach, whereas Buffy is of course, a vapid teen drama.

The show also suffers from an inability to take itself seriously, so that when it does try, it seems very forced.

The Angel/Buffy relationship is developed horribly.  They think they're in love, having barely interacted at alll.  Terrible, uninspired writing.

The main focus is on very dull monster of the week stories.  They find the monster, they identify it, Buffy kills it, with little variety in style.

I really cannot understand how this dreck ran for 7 seasons; still the WB cancelled it in its fifth year, and when UPN picked it up, it apparently lost them money.

1379135,4,B00004YWJE,"What started out as a replacement show, ended up being one of the greatest cult shows of all time, along with Angel and The X Files.  I am unsure how many of you remember these episodes, or how many of you would even consider watching the show.  Perhaps it's my job to make sure that you do watch one of the greatest television shows of all time, whether you like fantasy or not.  In retrospect, it's just an adequate season, given the wonder that is to come in later seasons, and that season one is abbreviated.  But, if one is to get themselves into a show that has been off the air now for seven years, you have to start at the beginning.  Everything about this season says beginning.

Now, that being said, the greatest part of this season is the characters.  From start to finish, we get to know them, their quirks and idiosyncrasies, personalities, and strengths and weaknesses.  In that, is the strength of the show anyways.  But the weaknesses of this particular season are within other things.

First off is the quality.  One would think the transfer to DVD would have been much better, but it's grainy, and really sub-par as far as production goes.  And the filler episodes, as far as plot goes, are rather pedestrian.  But, as for most things that I like, the good always outweighs the bad.  Second would be plot weakness, but there are enough good plots to make it manageable.

Below are my episode ratings and a small blurb.

1.  Welcome to the Hellmouth (1 of 2):  Good start, good introductions.  7/10
2.  The Harvest (2 of 2):  Good ending to the pilot two-parter, dwarfed by other episodes similar to it.  7/10
3.  Witch:  First stand-alone episode.  First dabbling of witchcraft.  Really great, honestly.  8/10
4.  Teacher's Pet:  Generic monster stand-alone.  Nice use of Xander and Cordelia.  Stupid everything else.  6/10
5.  Never Kill a Boy On the First Date:  The next step for the season arc.  Buffy's true beginning.  Very good.  7/10
6.  The Pack:  Frustrated with lack of continuity, but another great stand-alone.  Xander is great again.  7.5/10
7.  Angel:  Great expose into Angel's character, and his relationship with Buffy.  Great job all-around.  8.5/10
8.  I Robot, You Jane:  Worst of the season.  Nice to see a desperate side of Willow, and good for the introduction of Jenny Calendar.  Despised the plot though.  5.5/10
9.  The Puppet Show:  A good stand-alone episode, only strengthened by a good twist at the end.  7/10
10.  Nightmares:  A potentially great episode, spoiled by a horrid payoff.  6.5/10
11.  Out of Mind, Out of Sight:  A lovely episode in all phases.  9/10
12.  Prophecy Girl:  Considering it's a middle-of-the-road season by Buffy standards, a fantastic ending.  10/10

1379136,5,B00004YWJE,"This is where it all began!  The first time we get to see Buffy, Giles, Willow, Xander, Angel and Cordelia.  It's amazing to see the beginning of their relationships, and the first glimpses into a world that would last 7 seasons.  The special effects weren't as refined, the picture quality was a little less, and there were only 12 episodes to this first season.  But the humor and wit were here, the heartbreak, and a good hero's adventure begins!  Buffy Summers moves to Sunnydale with her single mom to start a new life - hopefully a vampire-free one.  But Sunnydale sits on a Hellmouth, so it attracts vampires and any number of demonic beasts hellbent on world destruction.  She's gonna need a whole team of friends and a mentor to help her!  It's a great first glimpse into the Slayer's world.
Oddly enough the first season was almost entirely shot on location rather than on sets.  So the graveyard is enormous and really spooky!  The high school looks impressive, and Sunnydale seems very real.  The vampires look a little different as they play with the make-up as the series goes on, and the dusting effects are a little primitive in this season.  But the first cut is always the deepest, and this season really sets the stage for everything to come!  Buffy is an amazing show with a female hero who relies on others to help her keep the demons at bay.  At its core the show is about growing up, and how high school can be hell.  Especially if you feel like an outsider - not quite fitting in to the mainstream.  Beautifully written and well-acted the show set action/horror cliches on their head and made it cool to be a strong girl who can kick butt and still get her heartbroken!  Buffy is a hero because we can relate to her.  She hurts as much as we do even if she's a little stronger physically.
Joss Wheedon (series creator and head writer) gives commentary on the premiere episodes and discusses how and why the series came about.  You also get interviews with him and David Boreanaz (Angel) talking about the series in video clips initially produced for the VHS series that came out starting in 1997.  You get the pilot's script and some photos as well.  Collectors need this set, and newcomers should start with this one.

1379139,4,B00004YWJE,"Buffy The Vampire Slayer was originally supposed to be a box office smash. However, due to complications on the set, the movie was not at all succesful. When the concept was revived in the mid-90's the creator, Joss Whedon, took Buffy into a completly different direction.
The WB had just begun and decided to take Buffy as one of it's main show components. The WB was looking for television shows that would appeal to the youth and didn't realize the wealth Buffy ultimatley would bring them.
The first season of Buffy (well all 12 episodes of it, it was a mid-season replacement) depictes the young female Buffy Summers moving and transfering in to a new high school. However, this high school isn't like any other, neither is the town of Sunnydale. For they both sit on top of a Hellmouth (a portal that unleashes Hell. It also attracts a lot of supernatural activity.) On Buffy's first day she meets Giles, her Watcher (they train ""the Slayer""), Willow, Xander, Cordelia, and a soon to be love interest Angel.
During the Season we are watching The Master (a really old and powerful Vampire who is trapped underground) repeatedly attempt to open the Hellmouth. We also find out that Angel is a vampire who had his soul restored by Gypsies (after he killed one of their own). We also see a nice handful of strange enemies throughout the Season.
Highlight Episodes: ""Welcome To The Hellmouth"", ""The Harvest"", ""Witch"", ""Angel"", and ""Prophecy Girl"".

The school librarian Rupert Giles ( Anthony Stewart Head) is introduced as Buffy's watcher who guides and trains her for her upcoming battles with the evil of Sunnydale. Buffy becomes friends with Xander Harris (Nicholas Brendan)and Willow Rosenburg ( Alyson Hannigan)who quickly learn of Buffy's situation, and decide to help save the lives of those in Sunnydale by working along side Buffy and Giles. Buffy also meets and begins to fall for a vampire with a soul named Angel (David Boreanaz)who also helps Buffy out from time to time. The main conflict of season one, is Buffy and her friends preparing to fight the master vampire of Sunnydale, who plans on releasing hell on earth by opening up the Hellmouth.
When I first heard about Buffy the Vampire Slayer being turned into a weekly television show, I was as skeptical as everyone else. However, you could tell that the show was going to become a good one after the very first episode. Show creator Joss Whedon managed to cast each character perfectly, and also managed to provide excellent dialogue for the characters, great special effects, and tons of action, suspense, and humor. Even though the first season of Buffy the Vampire Slayer is probably the weakest one, you can't really hold anything against the first season either because there was only 12 episodes. You have to look at the first season as more of a stepping stone that leads to something great. The best episodes from the first season are  ""Welcome to the Hellmouth"", ""The Harvest"", ""Angel"", ""Nightmares"", and ""Prophecy Girl"".
Overall, the first season of Buffy the Vampire Slayer offers a very decent start to the show, as well as some quality episodes. The special features for the season one DVD set include - commentary from Joss Whedon on the first two episodes, as well as interviews from Joss on several episodes.

If you pay attention, a great deal changes with nearly every character between episode 1 and episode 12.  Buffy starts off a little more airhead-y (and closer to the big screen Buffy) but she eventually moves towards the quick-witted punning slayer we've come to know.  Angel starts out a little more cocky than you may remember - and a little less soulful.  Its a good thing that Joss Whedon decided to make Angel a bit more sensitive than he started out, otherwise I'm not sure the Buffy-Angel romance would have worked.  The differences in Xander and Willow are a bit less striking, but they're there.  Buffy is a great show.  It started off as a great show and only got better from there.

1379143,3,B00004YWJE,"Buffy season one was good for several reasons and bad for several.
On the upside we meet some good characters.
Angel the vampire with a soul, a tormented character in early development. Somewhat bouncier then the depressing guy in his own spinoff.
Then we have Xander, the witty sarcastic goof with the hots for Buffy.
Has some awesome lines and stays clear of the shows annoying catch phrase dialogue.
Finally the new revamped (pun intended) Buffy. Sarah M Gellar is hot, but with an integrity which is rare in such a tacky role.
She credits the series.
Another plus to the show is the fact that unlike future series it is self contained, no cliffhangers at the end to make you need the next season to follow a plot line.
The ""Freak of the week"" format used in this show (and Smallville)
gives a reason for the supernatural being centralised around the shows base town ""SunnyDale"".
The town possesses a ""Hellmouth"", Gate of hell and so is a magnet for monsters.
The ongoing plot with evil nemesis ""The Master"" is weak and made worse by the poor casting of villain. You can't have a bad guy who can't hurt you and thats what we have here.
The show does have other weak characters such as Willow. Maybe if she were a lesbian witch (as she later becomes) the show would have given her more screen time. I would have.
All in all worth adding to your collection if you enjoy this sort of thing.
As a fan of the program Angel, my recomendation is to view the first 3 seasons of Buffy as they lead to the next show.
After season 3 the show decends into the metaphorical Hellmouth and becomes what I as a fan of the sci/horror genre call a ""Supernatural Soap Opera"".
If you enjoy this I would recommend Kolchak: The Night Stalker.",1086825600,2,1723,4.455696202531645

1379145,2,B00004YWJE,"Rarely do shows really have a great start in a mid season when replacing another show. ""Buffy the Vampire Slayer"" is one of those shows that replaced a show at mid season but caught on like it had been on all year. ""Buffy"" is not only a different and clever show, but it is great fun and very well done. In fact, I believe that ""Buffy"" is one of the best, if the not the best, television shows to ever air. It is just simply great with its great cast and crew, clever story, and a hip, fun style to it. ""Buffy"" is by far one of the greatest shows.
First, ""Buffy"" has a great starting cast that has no big stars (at the time) but they would soon become the leading Hollywood Actors, Actresses, Writers, and Directors. Joss Wheadon deserves most credit for creating an edgy and daring show that was a spin off of a very unsuccessful movie. Wheadon wrote the movie, but it was clearly edited and the show is much better with a whole new crew of writers and directors. Replacing Kristi Swanson, who played Buffy Summers in the 1992 movie, is Sarah Michelle Gellar, who on the first episode beats out Swanson for the 'best Buffy' award. There is no other way to say this except that Gellar is simply perfect for the role. Her supporting cast include British actor Anthony Stewart Head as Giles, the Slayer's ""watcher"". Head creates a more likable and believable Watcher than the film's Donald Sutherland. Also are Buffy's band of friends Willow (Alyson Hannigan) and Xander (Nicholas Brendan) who are both geeks but turn out to be both interesting and fun to watch. They take their characters and make a complex world of demons and magics also have human like qualities. Charisma Carpenter replaces the attitude that Swanson's Buffy had in the movie. Carpenter plays a rich, snobbish girl named Cordelia who is like Buffy's human nemesis. David Boreanaz plays Angel, a tourtured vampire with a soul who also finds a romantic relationship with the slayer. This impossible love story is much more fascinating that the dull and stupid one between Swanson's Buffy and Luke Perry. The villains are also much better and much scarier, such as the main villain who is called The Master (Mark Metcalf) and his little group of meanies including the vampiress Darla (Julie Benz). Yes, it it for sure, the cast alone makes this series an instant hit.
Second, even with a great cast, they need a good story to work with. ""Buffy the Vampire Slayer"" does of course have a main theme which includes The Master and Buffy's battle, but the true genius comes from the relationships played out by the characters. A tangled love story unfolds as the nerdy Willow is in love with her lifelong friend Xander, while Xander falls for new friend Buffy, even though Buffy is deeply in love with the tourtured vampire Angel. And a vampire in love with a slayer? That's just great writing. The monsters are also cool to look at, such as a giant preying mantis or even a demon trapped inside a robot body. The mythology is also created as the show goes on until there is a whole history dating back hundreds of years in the 'Buffy-universe'. More greatness of the show comes from the fact that it takes problems people deal with in everyday high school and turn those problems into monsters, such as the quiet girl who no one ever really sees turns invisible. Without a doubt, this is a great story.
Finally, to truly connect to the audience of teenagers, the writers had to make the show a hip and fun show that wasn't all about horror and monsters, but also about what was the current craze or big thing. People can relate to the show, such as the fact that if someone writes 'Have a nice Summer' in your yearbook it's because they had nothing else to say. Buffy also had a mix of unique and catchy clothes. Whatever was in on Buffy, was in everywhere else. Buffy had about as much influence on pop culture as any other show did, including ""Beverly Hills 90210"". ""Buffy"" was a great show that could have everything in it.
In conclusion, ""Buffy"" is a show that can't get much better. Yes, at times its corny, but isn't it suppose to be? The show is funny at the right times, scary at the right times, and heartbreaking at the same times. This is one of the greatest seasons of the show, and with the spectacular second season following up close, its even better! Don't miss out on one of the greatest series ever created, and start your ""Buffy"" collection here, with the first ones!",1086566400,3,4448,4.5543071161048685

In 1992 he and a director named Fran Rubel Kuzui created the movie staring Kristy Swanson as Buffy, and Donald Sutherland as her watcher Merrick.
The movie was a huge disappointment to Joss and as well with viewers. Joss tried to put Buff into his past.
 However, the character was resurrected as a television show, in 1997, on March 10, 1997. The beautiful actress Sarah Michelle Gellar was cast as our heroin, and Anthony Stewart Head as her watcher named Rupert Giles. Who is all so Sunnydale High's librarian.
Filling the shoes of Willow Rosenberg (the kind and nerdy best friend of Buffy). Was Alyson Hannigian.
All so Nicholas Brendon as the cute and goofy Xander Harris.
 Season one of Buffy the Vampire Slayer is really just an introduction of the characters and Sunnydale.
If you can get past some of the strange story lines. I promise that you will not be sorry for sticking around the series.
Buffy the Vampire Slayer has been completed for two years now. After a wonderful seven years running. Along with it's spin off ANGEL staring once Costar David Boreanaz.

1379149,4,B00004YWJE,"Buffy is the greatest televison series ever.  Joss Whedon wanted to create an icon and a universe that existed in our minds, and he has succeded.  The first season is a good introduction to the characters as a whole, but it only contains a few key episodes.  ""Welcome to the Hellmouth"", ""The Harvest"", ""Angel"" and ""Prophecy Girl"" are the standouts.  The set is weak on extra features.  Also the poor packaging leads to discs floating around in the sleaves, causing scratches (Fox Video please take note and fix).  Altogether, this is a must have far all Buffy fans.",1085616000,,565,4.714285714285714
1379150,5,B00004YWJE,"In my opinion,Buffy the Vampire Slayer is the best show to ever be made. But,like most shows,it started with a rather awkward first season. The premise is unpromising to start with. Who would watch a show about a girl slaying vampires?Well,I actually decided to give it a try. My first episode,being `Welcome to the Hellmouth`,I started developping an interest,immediately. The characters were very likable and the dialogue was better than perharps any show with the exception of The Simpsons. I continued watching and was mostly entertained. There were a few stinkers like I,Robot,...You,Jane but the really great ones like Angel and Prophecy Girl made up for that. The cast is really memorable. Buffy,Willow,Xander and Giles are about as good you can get as far as core groups go in a show. Cordelia is annoying but the last two episodes make her interesting. There's also Angel,the vampire with a soul,Buffy's mom and more. The Big Bad of season one is the Master. He's okay but I don't miss him once he's killed. He just lacks something that some later Big Bads have.
While I have been mostly positive thus far,season one is far from
flawless. It's only twelve episodes long and the story arc is really weak. Although,I admit Prophecy Girl is so great,it saves the story arc from being bad. There are also too many monster-of-the-week episodes that don't lead anywhere. Finally,after viewing the other seasons of Buffy,season one is lame in comparison. It even feels embarrassing at times because some episodes are very cheesy and can turn off potential Buffy fans that would have loved the show in its later seasons. At its best,season one shows potential that will eventually be fully explored in the later seasons. I think that for a true Buffy fan,season one is a fun little ride with a few great episodes and is really worth owning. The dvds,themselves,are okay. Picture quality is very average but that's to be expected with 16 mm film. The menus are bland but I like how Buffy says a cool quote each time an episode is chosen. Anyway,mostly this set gets a five-star because I'm a big Buffy freak and because it leads into some of the best tv ever.",1085270400,2,2159,4.822102425876011
1379151,3,B00004YWJE,"The series isn't worthy of multiple watchings, and once you've seen two or three episodes you've pretty much seen them all.  So then why did I watch them all you ask??  Well that is abvoius, Gellar's appeal makes her eye candy, and I can't take my eyes off her, the way she moves her sad expressions, and that droan of a voice, makes you go onto a daze and you can;t help be eb entranced by Gellar's magical spell of beauty...",1085011200,,426,4.246913580246914
1379152,4,B00004YWJE,"I remember being excited for the movie.  I was taking Tae Kwon Do at the time and thought the idea of a hot vampire slayer using bruce lee style martial arts would be a kick ass movie.  Even at the age of 14, I was disspointed, the jokes were too cheesed out and the only funny character was paul reubens.
So I was dumbfounded that they were going to make it into a series.  I was even more suprised that I really liked it.  It was funny, clever, packed with action, and had characters that were quirky but you got to like.
This first season was the shakiest.  You tend to see the main characters, especially the scoobies, to be more stereotypes than anything.  But they all have their charisma, and you get attached to them as the show progresses.  Buffy starts to show her weariness early on.  She wasn't more than a bubbleheaded teenager in the movie, but shows that she is accepting the weight of her responsibility.
The episodes were for the most part good, and the big bad was menancing, they range from funny to disturbing.  Puppet show was one of the cheesier ones, yet still funny.  Where a demon is collecting brains to keep himself in human form but is being hunted by a demon hunter, a lewd perverse one that is trapped in the body of a puppet.  Teachers pet follows the same cut, playing on the classic hot for teacher story involving Xander.  Except the teacher that he falls for is a giant praying mantis in human form hunting for male virgins to mate with.
The Pack is on a darker note.  Also a view on how cruel group mentality can be in high school.  Where Xander and the meanest clique in high school are somehow bonded with the spirit of a hyena and start preying on the weak, socially and physically.  There is also the Witch, about a womans obsession with regaining her past glory as a cheerleader.  Which has a dark end that is touched on later in the series.
Not the best season of Buffy by far, but better than anyone could have anticipated, creating a very loyal cult following.",1085011200,,2004,4.390243902439025
1379153,5,B00004YWJE,"Anyone who is a fan of television knows that Buffy is a great show.  This is where it all began as a television show.  The first season was made of many self-contained episodes with the Master running in the background.  Since Buffy was a mid-season replacement, there dvd only has about 12 or so episodes not the usual 24-22.  The video is a tad dark and the special features are rather lacking but the show is just too good for any of these things to matter.  The first season was one of the best of Buffy and Angel combined with humor.  Cordy was fantastic with her insults and Zander was on the top of his game.  Meanwhile, the Master played by the villian from ANimal House was fantastic.  I just wish he had a longer run on the show.  The two part season final was great, it just brought everything together and was a great fight that would be topped each and every season.  The last thing I want to say is about the relationship between ANgel and Buffy... This is where it started and it was so great.  It was well written and it developed so naturally for a teenage first love.  Go and buy this and then enjoy.",1085011200,,1118,4.271428571428571
1379154,4,B00004YWJE,"I'm a Buffy novice. Watching only the movie last year, I had successfully avoided the Buffy phenom year after year. Perhaps it was the undue influence of a certain person that worshipped the shows as the best thing on. But it took my current boyfriend to turn me on to the Slayer and her gang of do-gooders that has made me a complete convert. I stand in the awe of Buffy.
Since I have no other seasons with which to compare this first season, I must say this is a delectable, funny group of episodes. Setting the course of the show, Sarah Michelle Gellar proves her talent early on, giving Buffy the appropriate menace and high school angst. She clearly carries the show on her shoulders, yet carries that mantle with utmost professionalism. Her cohorts are equally compelling. Alyson Hannigan plays Willow, a self-confessed computer geek, with a sense of wonderful innocence. Nicholas Brendon gives Xander, a loveable loser, dignity.  Anthony Head's Giles, know-it-all librarian, is stuffy and fun.
The twelve episodes stand up well, with only a couple of brain scratchers in the mix. The first two set up the series and its characters very well. Some of the favorites included the ""Angel"" episode, that finally helps solve the mystery of the character while seemingly adding more to it, and ""Nightmares"" where seemingly bad dreams enter reality. One particularly odd episode was ""The Pack"", where hyenas seem to enter a group of students as they proceed to reign havoc over Sunnydale, but I didn't buy it.
Overall, you can see the promise of this series in these early episodes. I was pleasantly surprised at the developing sense of humor that seemed to grow with each episode. I really enjoyed the comraderie between all the main characters, as they fight both those hideous Hellmouth demons and the trials and tribulations of puberty. Overall, it's been an enjoyable experience.
I'm eargerly awating to watch season two on DVD now, and find out what happens to Buffy and her gang!",1084406400,,1985,4.872781065088757
1379155,4,B00004YWJE,"Buffy the Vampire Slayer, Season One. Buffy is a very complex television show. It's more then just about vampires and other dark things, that go bump in the night.
I have been re-watching season one lately. As I am waiting for season six on DVD excitedly.
I now appreciate season one more then when it first aired. When it first came on I don't think I understood some of the story lines.
 However, after re-watching it it really does stand out.
Some really great episodes are The Witch ( the first episode with Amy. ) Angel, the Puppet Show ( not as lame as it sounds. ) And one of my favorites Out of Mind, Out of Sight.",1084406400,,622,4.271186440677966
1379156,4,B00004YWJE,"These DVDs contain the first season of Buffy the Vampire Slayer, the cult hit now widely regarded as one of the best TV series in the history of American television.
Buffy is a High School student who has been chosen to become the Slayer, a girl endowed with superhuman fighting ability to protect the world from vampires, demons, and general evil.  She's in the right place for a slayer in Sunnydale, a city located on the Hellmouth, a center of attraction for the dark forces Buffy is fighting.
The first season is short, only 13 episodes to the 20+ that were filmed in each of the later seasons.  It's also less dark and less ambitious.  The standard plot for most of the episodes is taking some horror of the High School experience and giving it a supernatural twist: A gang of bullies who act like beasts and then actually transform into them, an unpopular girl who becomes literally invisible and starts wreaking havoc on all those who ignored her, etc.  The primary villain is The Master, an old and powerful vampire who is trapped below the earth but hoping to manipulate the power of the Hellmouth to escape.
The season is pulled above the average by a strong cast and excellent writing.  The dialogue is consistently clever and enjoyable. It's witty from the very first episode - in almost the first scene, Buffy, who was kicked out of her previous school, meets with a guidance counselor who tells her that every student at Sunnydale High starts with a clean slate, and demonstratively starts ripping up her earlier record in front of her.  As he tears it, he reads a few highlights then suddenly reconsiders, grabs some tape, and starts piecing it back together.  It's a great scene, and the moment that first made me a Buffy fan.  The invisible girl episode also has a very amusing finale.
The entire cast is impressive, but Sarah Michelle Geller as Buffy and Allison Hannigan as Willow stand out.
Still, if this your first exposure to Buffy, you won't really understand from this season why the show has such a devoted following.  The first season is merely a good, entertaining show.  Later seasons made the jump to real brilliance by making the characters far more complex and creating story arcs that stretched through entire seasons, allowing substantially more interesting stories than can be told in the largely single episode (the premiere and season finale are two part episodes) format of the first season.
Overall, this is the weakest of the seven seasons of Buffy that were produced for TV.  But it's still quite good, and if you're unfamiliar with the series and interested in learning more, the best place to begin is at the beginning.",1083110400,,2662,4.752711496746204
1379157,4,B00004YWJE,Buffy the tv show butchers the movie. If your able to forget about everything that happened in the movie this season is great. I don't remember buffy burning down the gym in the movie or her parents seprating and in the movie buffy was a senior in high school. This starts out with her in 10th grade becaouse by the third season she having her senior prom. But if you can look past all that you will like this show.,1082592000,,415,4.2
1379158,4,B00004YWJE,I always kind of made funny of Buffy and her loyal fans just to find myself now hopelessly addicted to this show. I'm borrowing all the seasons from a friend who has them and she can't get them to me fast enough. The worst part is I know how it all ends and it makes me immensely sad. Why can't it just go on forever and also I haven't watched Angel completely yet but from what I've seen it doesn't seem as fun as Buffy was.,1081900800,,425,3.953488372093023
1379159,3,B00004YWJE,"Buffy Beginnings:
 I started watching Buffy in spring of 8th grade.  I'd seen the movie when I was 11, and it instantly became one of my favorites.  Anyway, I loved it right from the get go.  It was cool to see someone kicking butt who was closer to my age than Dana Scully (who I love, I'm a hopeless X-Phile as well).  There's my simple testimonial.
 Now it's seven years ago that the series first premiered and we get these wonderful DVD sets of the best shows on TV!  So here's a retro review of season one.  As it stands, this is my second least favorite season.  It's hard for a series to run on half a season and try to establish a following.  Especially in March, when most shows are in a cycle of reruns.  Buffy premiered with `Welcome to the Hellmouth' and ended its first season three months later with `Prophecy Girl.'
  Between those episodes we were served were generally good, but not spectacular.  We got hints of how good `Buffy' could be with `Witch,' `Angel' and `Out of Sight, Out of Mind.'  But we also got `I Robot, You Jane, and `Never Kill a Boy on the First Date.'
 It leveled out to what amounted to a mediocre first season, but I think we all expected great things to come and season two delivered-in spades.

1379160,4,B00004YWJE,"Let me preface this by saying I'm a 55 year old retired U.S. Marine who rented the movie (it tanked at the Box Office and at my house) and had no interest in watching a series based on that dog.  Several years later, however, my youngest daughter came to visit me for a few days and started watching reruns of Buffy at the house.  I sat down one day just to be with her and got hooked.  This is a ""blue collar"" review of that series that I never intended to watch.  Josh Whedon, the show's creator, put more thought into his character developement for the series than he had in the movie, it seems.  Buffy, the Slayer (Sarah Michelle Geller) and one of the first real female heros on TV (most females in horror are air-headed and are eaten early in the script), is starting school in Sunnydale California in the middle of her sophmore year when the series begins.  She had been expelled for burning down the gymnasium at her school in Los Angeles.  Her mother has found a job in Sunnydale after her divorce and both she and Buffy are hoping to start fresh in a new place.  It seems to work for Mom but Buffy becomes involved with a murder at the school in the very first episode.  The cast includes Xander (Nicholas Brendan) the wise cracking comedy relief, Willow (Alyson Hannigan) the brainy naive nerd with no self confidence, Cordelia (Charisma Carpenter) the conceited, air-headed rich girl, Rupert Giles (Anthony Head) the ""Watcher"", expert on all things occult, and school librarian (he's English and quite proper), and finally Angel/Angelus (David Boreanaz) the vampire with a soul (due to a curse).  Josh Whedon gives all of us who have followed vampires through the horror movies since our childhood a new twist.  He gives us a better explanation of the making of vampires, the best history of vampires to date,  and a good explanation of their existance on this plane.  He also gives us Sunnydale California that sets atop the ""Hellmouth"" setting the stage for not just vampire stories but tons of demons, werewolves, and other evil creatures mixed in with your everyday teenager.  Trust me, as a father of four daughter who were all teenagers at one time, the teenager part is scary enough.  This season's twelve episodes were filmed on a shoestring budget with several different directors due to the uncertainty of the show being picked up.  The actors do a great job, making you really care about the well being of their characters and the writers manage to give the show a mini-series feeling (ending an episode but referring back to it often), mix in really good gags to lighten the show at some very strange times, and manage to tell a broad, twelve show, master story that is concluded in the final episode for the year.  As with later seasons, the final episode has a larger part of the season budget than the previous eleven to give the season a more spectacular ending.  While there is a master story and master villan for the season, we see periodic detours involving non-related evil guys who are endangering human life.  Buffy's friends, later to be known as the Scoobies"", help her as they can, give us plot twists as they are in danger either individually or collectively, and help her cope with everyday high school life.  Giles becomes her father figure, Willow her best friend, and Angel (the tall dark mysterious figure who drops in to give her warnings and cryptic messages) eventually becomes her love interest until she learns that he is in fact a vampire.  If you are looking for light hearted entertainment and have always thought movies didn't tell their stories well enough, you will probably love this series.  The first season dispite it's low budget is very good but after getting picked up by a Network it gets much better in the following seasons.  I recommend this season for everyone though it does have a great deal of violence (for me that's a plus).",1079654400,2,3896,4.67203513909224

Also the master is kinda cool and who doesn't think Sarah is an uber hottie? It's great to get an intro into the world but if you seen it, don't buy unless your a collector.

1379162,5,B00004YWJE,"When Buffy was released on TV I was in the sixth grade and I thought it was stupid. Now I'm graduated from high school and am a bit wiser then the snobby little punk I once was. I Purchased the First season finding it at a 20 dollar price and I thought what the heck. I didn't know that I was heading into one of the most creative and well-done shows That I will ever find. I was just hoping for a laugh
The gang is pretty much all assembled at the beginning. Buffy is the leader, Willow is the heart, Xander is the humor, Giles is the brain, Cordelia the popular girl we all knew and hated back in high school, and Angel the man no one really trusts. While it's easy to stereotype the characters in this fashion (and not totally inaccurate until Season 2 rolls around) each one does evolve gradually. These are all people that we knew and sat next to in class.
The first season consists of twelve episodes that with a couple of exceptions are all carefree lighthearted monster of the week fare. What makes the episodes work so well is the imaginative way each monster is presented. All the characters find a bit o humor in the situations they so frequently seem to get placed in. And it's nice to get a comfortable feel for everything before it all goes to hell.
What struck me most though while watching these episodes was the feel that those involved had might not have had a single clue what they were doing. It was a show that didn't really fit into any discernible genre on a network that was brand new with a budget that was freakishly low for some of the stories they were trying to pull off. But I really think it worked towards the shows advantage. The fact that everyone involved was learning as they went and that the effects are terrifically cheesy gives the show an organic quality. Plus it kind of doubles as a high school metaphor for the problems that we faced seemed to consume the world back then. Now those problems just seem like typical kid stuff when i look back.
Well I'm now addicted, snatching up each box set with a fervor that causes my roommate to constantly be rolling his eyes (although He knows a lot of what happens through out the entire series.) some people will probably never be able to get beyond their precepts about it. And that is truly a shame.",1078876800,2,2286,4.355971896955504

What is it about BUFFY THE VAMPIRE SLAYER we love about so much? Is it the kick-ass punching and kicking the Slayer does week by week? What makes us care so much about our Slayer and her Scooby friends? BUFFY is without a doubt the best damn show on television.  Regardless if it's over.  There are so many episodes worth watching over starting from the beginning.  And the frist season of BUFFY THE VAMPIRE SLAYER isn't half bad.  It was interesting watching these characters grow up, like watching your favorite characters growing with each passing season.  And what I love about the first season of BUFF THE VAMPIRE SLAYER, is that it had a great way of teen drama that deals with about this one girl, Buffy, who was often misunderstood.  And she and her friends would always solve the mystery of Sunnydale and why things happen the way they do.  The first half season was great, and it keeps getting better.

1379166,5,B00004YWJE,"I was never a Buffy fan. In fact when in show first aired in 1996 I made fun of some of my classmates that did watch it. For some reason it didn't appeal to me. 8 years later I cannot get enough of Buffy. I picked up this DVD because one of my closest friends loves the show and I finally decided to give it a chance.
Buffy Summers is a 16 year old sophmore at SunnyDale High. She just moved to SunnyDale from L.A where she got into some serious problems with vampire slaying(she burnt down her school gym). Buffy hopes that SunnyDale will be a good start of her new life without 'slaying'. But she soon finds out that she is the chosen one and will have to continue to kick some vampire butt!! She meets Xander and Willow who help her along the way(they are true friends) and she also meets her Watcher, Giles, who is the school librarian. Together they try to save the world from demons and vampires.
Some of my favorite eposides are:
- TEACHERS PET: This eposide is about a new science teacher at Sunny Dale that is actually a gigantic bug looking for virgin boys to mate with.
-THE PACK: Buffys class takes a trip to the Zoo and a group of mean kids and Xander become possessed by hyenas. They go around the school and bully their peers and they also kill the principle.
-ANGEL: In this eposide Buffy discovers that she really likes Angel but she cannot be with him because he is a vampire. Her envy turns to hate when she discovers that her mom was attacked by a vamoire and she thinks that Angel is to blame.
-PROPHECY GIRL: This is the final eposide of the season where Buffy faces The Master because he has gained enough energy to be above ground. He is ready to take on the world...but Buffy won't let him.
This was a great season but the only thing that bothered me was the lighting. I don't think that there was a lot of money in the budget for this season because the lighting is horrible. But I got past that and enjoyed all 12 eposides. Go pick this season up and get ready for some great stories because there is a lot more ahead for Miss Buffy the Vampire Slayer",1076630400,,2078,4.236775818639798
1379167,4,B00004YWJE,"Season 1 of Buffy is the origin of a phenomenal series, and it's amazing to see where a seven year web of plotlines began spinning.  The show and it's characters have evolved immensely over the years, and watching the first season again is like jumping into a time machine.
This season was unique to all of the others.  It had a stronger focus on horror, and the comic aspects overweighed the dramatic.  Since it was a shortened season, it was difficult to develop a complex story arc, which isn't necessarily a bad thing for season 1.  Sacrificing a complex plot, this season really draws the viewer into the foundations of some of the strongest relationships the show will see.  It focuses on the premise of the series, and you'll really grow attached to the characters, which is imperative for a show of this caliber.  You really get a feel for what the essence of the show is about, the undying relationships between Buffy and her friends and family.
While the majority of the set contains filler episodes having very little to advance the main plot, there are a few standout episodes.  ""Welcome to the Hellmouth"", ""Angel"", and ""Prophecy Girl"" all show the potential this show can have and WILL show in the promising future.  The cast absolutely graces the set with their chemistry, as always, and it was even apparent in the beginning.  Sarah Michelle Gellar soars with confidence through such a fantastic role, and by the end of the season in ""Prophecy Girl"" we begin to grasp how complex the character Buffy actually is...and Sarah delivers.

Oh, who am I kidding?  It's A Hot Chick Defeats Supernatural Menace With Subplots.  And it happens every week.  Not to say that it's not good.  It's incredible.  Like watching a horror-comedy with teen angst elements every week.  I hate to be pushy, but Dawson's Creek could have benefited from a demon here or there--it would have kept things lively.  That's one of the many reasons Buffy rocks. It's also consistently well written, and well acted to boot.  Gellar, Hannigan, and Brendan are fantastic, and Stewart-Head exercises a keen and careful eye over them as Watcher.

The comedy drama romance horror all mixed into one show nothing has ever had such a succesful combination. I know when i'm 50 and have kids or grandkids i'll watch this show and remember my child hood (i'm 16 right now) and good times it'll be a classic.,1075248000,,396,4.438356164383562

This is the start of the ""ScOObieS""..And what a perfect name for them THE SCOOBIES..Coz if they had a dog it would be ScOOby Doo. But that is besides the point..BuFFy The Vampire Slayer yes its corny yes its goofy yes its silly but that is why we all LOVE it. BuFFy is so much like shows we all grown up with..And without a doubt it has the best ""one liners"" that we have heard in years..And the one liners just keep getting better and funnier in the upcoming seasons as weLL..And this is the 1st season *which is actually half a season* that started it all. This show has everything..And it doesn't take itself seriously. Which makes it such a relief from shows that have come to take themselves way too seriously.
It can also be compared to ""Abbott and Costello meets Frankenstein"" too. And for us guys this show has the sexiest girls in a tv series i can say of all time. BuFFy Cordelia and of course WiLLow (she is a great actress and in my book one of the top most beautiful actresses of today:) And that gets even more in the other seasonS..BuFFy the Vampire Slayer is the most fun anyone can have watching tv today..This show lapoons satires all the classic scary movie characters and clitches' imaginable and more. Total Brillant Writting and a cast that works together in the best way imaginable..The chemistry between the players is beyond words..And we have fun coz we can tell that they are having fun making this show..And that chemistry shines here in the first season..And it only blossoms into greater heights with each passing season..Not many shows mostly of today can say that.
This show has dedicated follwers and one of them is me. And this show has earned each one of their fans..They deliver with enjoyable mass of entertainment..The timing of the cast is right on the money as the one liners are fired at warp speed..Has the ultimate power to keep the viewer's attension..Once a week i will review all the seasons of BuFFy. Today January 23 2004 Friday @ 12:22PM is my first. Stay tuned for more. For now let me end this one by saying : Prepare and brace yourself for a FUN ride with BuFFy WiLLow and the rest of the ""ScOObieS"" Gang..For tv doesn't get much better then this..And BuFFy the Vampire Slayer shares the throne along side the greatest shows of all time..More the highly recommended......",1074816000,,2385,4.667458432304038

Thank you for NOT being vague about why ""Buffy the Vampire Slayer"" is a bad show (That was sarcasm). Okay. I only wrote this to counter what the person who I quoted above, said, so I will. ""Low standards""? ""No acting, no writing""? You're kidding, right? Are you sure you know what good acting and writing is? You MUST be one of those silly people at the PTC (Parent's Television Council) who think that ""8 Simple Rules..."" and ""7th Heaven"" are shows of quality. Get a brain and spell Whedon's* last name right. And about ""many scenes bordering on being porn"": I'm pretty sure you're referring to the sixth season, so why not put it in a review for THAT season? Until then, try reviewing a product when you actually have bought it.
For the people who've never seen the show, if you have a brain that functions properly, and can use a television show where it's put to use, buy Seasons 1-4 in one set, instead of buying this alone.",1074470400,,1107,4.431372549019608

We decided that we wanted to start watching the show from the beginning, so we purchased this DVD set.  It's amazing the number of things that we learned from watching the first season.  The writing has been good since the beginning and I just love some of the things that Xander and Willow say.  Basically, I recommend this DVD set to fans or those who want to see how it all began.  Many of you who aren't into vampire movies will still love this show.",1072742400,,628,4.370689655172414
1379173,4,B00004YWJE,"For years, I was very very stupid about this series. I was certain that the movie was far superior (told you I was stupid), and that changing anything about it for the series was a mistake. Not only was I stupid, but I was wrong.
My experience with Buffy came in small doses, which got bigger and bigger eventually. It wasn't until the full series was put into syndication that I got to watch it to my heart's content. There is no doubt that this show ranks as one of the best ever aired on any station.
Welcome to Sunnydale. Population: Dwindling. Buffy Summers comes to this sunny little California town fresh from some bad raps in LA. Branded by mother and school faculty as a trouble-maker, along with having to make new friends and all, you'd think her troubles would be big enough. But no, she has to be the chosen one as well. Poor gal.
The first season was only twelve episodes long, but they were all worth the watch. They managed to introduce and develop the cast of characters, from Buffy's friends Xander and Willow; to their resident bully; Cordelia; the vampire with a soul, Angel; to his exhaultant fogeyness, Ruper Giles, Buffy's Watcher. All the characters add something to the story (yes, even Cordelia, but not a whole lot), and they provide equal doses of laughs and drama.
That's really what the show boils down to. It's a story of supernatural struggles wrapped in a comedy package with a healthy dose of good teen drama. None of it feels contrived or boring, and the cast and crew all obviously have a good time with it. From the first scene of the pilot to the final battle with The Master, you'll be wanting to see more Buffy, more fighting, and even more Buffy (meow!)
The DVD features some respectable extras, and solid audio and video, especially for a TV series. Even though there are only a dozen episodes on the disk, this is a no-brainer purchase for fans of the show, fans of teen drama (yes, Dawson's Creek is dead; get over it), fans of all things supernatural, or just people who like to laugh. Welcome to the Hellmouth. Don't expect to leave.",1071360000,3,2079,4.531914893617022
1379174,3,B00004YWJE,"The first season of any show is a little different.  The actors are still 'finding' their characters, and relationships are not yet developed.  So watching the first few episodes is a little awkward, but the show grows on you.  It is good.

My main complaint is the quality.  The DVD transfer was done horribly, or maybe they just used VHS tapes to make the DVD or something.  It's very grainy, the worst in dark scenes.  Hopefully the later seasons will be done better.

Update: I've since found out that for budget reasons, Season 1 & 2 of Buffy were shot on 16mm film.  This is what causes the extreme grainyness of any scene that doesn't have a lot of light.  Despite this, the show is amazing, probably one of the best ever put on television.",1070928000,2,747,4.466666666666667
1379175,4,B00004YWJE,"As you've probably figured out, this is hte first season of Buffy the Vampire slayer, which was spawned as a result of the cult hit movie of the same title.  The show was originally not projected to do well, after all it was released mid-season and was only given a few episodes to shine.  And shine it did!
The first season of Buffy introduces you to the main characters as Buffy moves to Sunnydale in grade 10.  Buffy is initially portrayed as a former Miss Popular bimbo cheerleader, but soon warms up to Xander, Willow, and her watcher Giles after being rejected by queen of mean Cordelia. The show already starts the threads of storylines that will be shown throughout, including the Buffy and Angel love story, Willow and Xander 'more then friends' storyline, and others.
Stand out episodes in this 12-ep season include ""Angel"" where Buffy and Angel first kiss and Buffy discovers his true identity, ""Nightmares"" where the groups nighttime horrors come true, and ""Prophecy Girl"" the climactic first-season ender.
While the season is relatively unstructured in comparison to other seasons, where there is one ""Big bad"" that is dealt with more or less in every episode, this season does have some good moments and shows that it has potential to be a strong show in the future.  A good season to watch just to get introduced to the funny humor and roots of the show.",1070841600,,1369,4.739495798319328

The show was broadcast on a grainy UHF station, and I thought I would be thrilled by the qualiity picture. Well, I was stunned alright.
I now miss that grainy picture I was used to. At least the ""fuzz"" moves with the characters. On this DVD it just lingers there, distracting me, slightly, from the action.
And the shadows are a little cartoonish looking.
Unless I read very convincing reviews praising the picture quality of later seasons' DVD's, I'll wait a few years to buy any more of this series, when digital transfer technology has improved.  I assume ""Angel"" DVD's will be similar.
From now on, I'll only read professional reviews, like Sound & Vision magazine.",1069718400,2,845,4.596026490066225
1379180,5,B00004YWJE,"NO review can quite capture how strong a show this is, but I'll try to sketch out a few of its strengths...
First, as has often been said in other reviews, this series has something to please just about anybody. It is a comedy, a mystery, an action show, a horror movie, a soap opera, a social commentary, AND in later seasons operatic melodrama (YES!). It does this, all while maintaining the basic hipness of the show and the reality of its characters. Each of these elements is done very superbly on its own, but the fact that these are all combined heightens the power of each of these elements.
Second, this show defies a whole set of expectations. Every episode is full of twists and turns that are often unexpected even to the most conscious viewer, leaving the viewer never knowing what will happen from minute to minute and week to week. Characters we grow familiar with suddenly have a life-changing event or the show provides us with a new revelation that impacts them throughout the rest of the entire series.
The storytelling is superb. Each episode stands alone as its own exciting, self-contained story with surprises and twists, and yet at the same time makes forward movement in multiple plot strands and character development. Characters or events that we see and dismiss now become the basis of important developments later. Already in season one, our perceptions we get of Angel and Cordelia in episode one are radically altered by the end of the 12 episodes (the season's so short because Buffy started off as a midseason replacement). I have never seen a show combine plot and characterization nearly as skillfully.
Very few shows capture the emotional depth that this series accomplishes. Many excellent shows, dramas and sitcoms alike, dwell on their own smartness and the characters become subordinate to the plot or dialogue. In contrast, the writers of Buffy throw crises at the characters that resonate with real horrors and struggles in our own lives. The beginning of the series often looks into the horrors of high school and adolescence -- the gulf with your parents, struggling to fit in to high school, loneliness, etc. Also, especially beginning in season two, the characters transcend adolescent archetypes and become vivid actual people who you care about as they struggle through very real traumas and dangers. Many of the characters of Buffy are fleshed out as genuine people, with their generous and delightful moments, who suddenly find out they must find strength and be heroes. The show's combination of humor and action with the real drama makes the drama all the more effective. In this sense Buffy is unlike ""real"" dramas that dwell too much on the self-pity and self-centeredness of their characters, shows that when you watch them it's like hearing a pianist pounding the same dull key over and over.
With Buffy you have a sense of a production team and actors for whom this show is a labor of love. Joss Whedon's enthusiasm for his project is clearly shared by the writers, producers, and the cast.
What's especially great is that if you come to love season one (which I'm sure you will), you will be BLOWN AWAY by season two, where the writing is much more consistent, the acting is more assured and nuanced, and the creators knock you over with surprises (some supernatural, others not) that really confront the characters with moral dilemmas and emotional crises where friendship, love, and loyalty are all put to the test. And not everyone passes the test all the time...
After watching season one you may be pleasantly surprised by the show but not understand why I am so enthusiastic. Well, leave that season two -- the season that converted the fans into fanatics.",1069459200,5,3720,4.859842519685039
1379181,3,B00004YWJE,"I didn't get into Buffy the Vampire Slayer until it's last few seasons.  Since the time the show first primiered, I dismissed it as another WB teeniebopper mellow drama with vampires thrown into the mix.  Season one is pretty much that in a nut shell, but despite the fact that the first season relies on way too much teen mellowdrama and some sloppy storytelling, the show has a strangely addicting quality to it thanks to the fine cast and quirky humor.  Sarah Michelle Gellar is Buffy Summers, a vampire slayer who moves from L.A. to Sunnydale, California (the show basically picks up from where the film, which starred Kirsty Swanson as Buffy, left off), a town full of vampires, demons, and all kinds of other nasties.  She soon meets her would be mentor Giles (Anthony Stewart Head), popular airhead Cordelia (Charisma Carpenter), and finds friends in the dorky Xander (Nicholas Brendon) and computer whiz Willow (Alyson Hannigan); both of whom would be the only cast members, along with Gellar, that would remain as full time cast members until the end of the series.  Buffy also encounters the mysterious Angel (David Boreanaz) who plays quite a pivotal role in episodes to come.  There is plenty to admire about the series, but some of the episodes, particularly the season finale, come off as pretty weak.  All that aside though, this first season of Buffy is better than what I thought it would be, but the best of Buffy would not be seen until later on in the series' life.",1069372800,9,1485,4.754863813229572

I personally dismissed the show without giving it any chance for six years.  I figured it would be childish and not worth the time, like most television.  However, when I stumbled upon a repeat of a Season 3 episode, I was attracted.  By the end of the Season 3 repeats, I was hooked.
The show is a marvelous combination of thriller, action, and comedy.  The well crafted episodes, though flawed every once in a while, have interesting underlying themes, personifications, and philosophies.  The first season is a bit rougher on the edges than the remaining seasons for obvious reasons, less money.

Buffy (and Angel) maintained an almost un-paralleled level of consistency through-out its run. It's great to see the introductions of characters and plotlines and are referenced and have resonance all the way through the last season.

However, with that said, Buffy: Season 1 has a very hip and fun sense to it.  Buffy's angst at this time felt a little simpler, which made for some hysterical episodes.  Plus, you get prehaps one of the coolest Buffy villians of all time... the Master (who, quite oftenly, steals the show in a wicked way).",1064448000,,597,4.711538461538462
1379190,4,B00004YWJE,"While I have reviewed all the other seasons of Buffy, I would be remiss if I didn't write a little bit about season one.
This is where it all starts, and as far as first seasons go, Buffy did it better then most. I would point to the writing as the key to the success here, with Xander really being the character that stuck out, at least in my mind, as the one that really kept things moving throughout the entire season. In a season where Buffy, Angel, Willow, and Giles really were not molded into their true characters yet, Xander (and to an extent Cordelia) was the character that was able to make us laugh, and at the same time keep us interested.
The villian role of season one is played by the Master. The Master really did set a fine standard for big bads to come, and as a testament to his effectiveness I would point to numerous special guest appearences he did in Buffy season two and three in past or alternate relatity sequences and in Angel season 2 in regards to the Darla arc, whom is another chacater we meet (briefly as she is dusted until he revival on Angel some three years later) in this season.
If you love Buffy, you have to have this, simple as that. It's the beginning, the Book of Genesis if you will of the Buffy Bible. Sure you'll wince at villians like Moolach (or however you spell it), and sometimes you may get a bit bored.

""Angel"" and ""Prophecy Girl"" are two of the finest episodes of any television series and it is a tragedy that they are overlooked when they are compared to lousy overrated Buffy episodes like ""Once More with Feeling"" and ""Hush.""
The ""Angel"" episode is a fantastic hour of television because it tells the tragic story of a man that is forced to look at the sins of his past in a believable light. It is also great because it really breathed some new light into the ""star-crossed-lovers"" formula and it gave us our first glimpse of the tragic and touching Buffy/Angel love story.
""Prophecy Girl"" is another truly great episode of Buffy because it focuses on dying young in a way that is not sappy or cheesy and it really makes you see what you have to do in order to be a true hero in the end.

In fact, it is one of the most amazingly intelligent cultural artifacts of the past decade, a show that has as many adult and academic fans as teens.  For those who have never experienced all that is the Buffyverse, this DVD set is an essential beginning point.  It not only contains all twelve episodes comprising the first season, the set contains numerous interviews, commentaries, and short features that should bring any neophyte up to speed on the beginning of this landmark series.
We first met Buffy the Vampire Slayer in the 1992 film of the same name.  The TV series supposedly begins a few weeks after the end of the movie, with Buffy and her mother moving to the town of Sunnydale in order to start afresh after she burned down her former high school gym, which was filled with vampires.  From nearly the first episode, the incredible chemistry among the original Scooby Gang members is established as we are introduced to Buffy's new watcher Giles, and her two new Sunnydale friends Willow and Xander.  We also meet the leading snob in the school, the appalling Cordelia Chase, and, of course, the dark and mysterious Angel.  Although this first season lacks the amazing story arcs that made BUFFY THE VAMPIRE SLAYER one of the great achievements in the history of broadcast television, the show was nonetheless remarkable from the very beginning for the enormously witty and intelligent scripts, a willingness to rethink every aspect of what is possible in a television show, and the unexpected approaches to character development,
From the very beginning, the characters in Buffy have stunningly familiar problems, problems that feel more realistically treated than in all other supposedly realistic TV drams.  And the degree of development and change for any character was from the beginning amazingly original.  Consider Cordelia's first words upon seeing Angel for the first time in The Bronze in ""Never Kill a Boy on the First Date""-"" Ooo! Hello, salty goodness!--are especially fascinating:""  If one juxtaposes those words with all the changes Cordelia undergoes over the years both in her relationship to Angel and in her own maturity, one is tempted to state that she perhaps has undergone more change than any character in television history.  In most shows, you learn most of what there is to know about a character almost instantly, but it is the genius of Joss Whedon and the others driving the Buffyverse that Cordelia, who seemingly is the most transparent of characters, could develop the way that she later did.
The central conflict in The Hellmouth Chronicles was from the first season to the seventh the internal conflicts that Buffy experiences in regard to her own slayerhood.  On the one hand, she is the Slayer, on the other, she wants a normal life filled with dates and love and friends and birthday parties and a (nonslaying) vocation and an education.  It will take seven seasons for that story to be resolved.  The great news is that anyone experiencing Buffy for the first time in these DVDs and liking them, will not believe how great the show would get in the next season.  Merely a hint at the greatness to come.",1060905600,3,3427,4.904844290657439
1379196,5,B00004YWJE,"I was only slightly interested in the Buffy series when I asked for this one for Christmas.  I saw the first episode and was hooked!  The writing, the stories and the acting combined make this the best series.  I am now a huge fan of the show and even though it is over, I still await the new seasons on dvd with great anticipation.  Once you view the entire 1st season and witness the ingenious combo of suspense, horror, comedy and drama, you will want to continue your collection.

1379197,5,B00004YWJE,"I just discovered how great the Buffy series is this past year. Having seen, and hated, the original movie, I decided the television series must be just another teen soap. That was until my husband came down with the flu, and we watched it in reruns while he recuperated. What a great series! The dvd has all kinds of interviews and extras, and it's kind of fun to hear insights into the characters, but the episodes are why we buy. The dialogue is incredible and the action is ""Butt-kicking"" (my son's phrase). There is a bit of teen soap, especially when dealing with Angel and Buffy's relationship, but it is well balanced with the monsters, action and comedy. I think the first season is the best, but the rest of the seasons are also great.",1059264000,,745,4.525925925925926
1379198,3,B00004YWJE,"This isn't a bad purchase at all.  And, if you're like me and got acquainted with Buffy through another friend's DVDs (a few days after the show ended), you quickly get a sense of why the show was so compelling.  The central characters are already well-developed, and the Master, the show's first ""Big Bad,"" is both scary and strangely endearing.  There are also some very funny moments (especially in ""The Puppet Show"") and Buffy's resistance to her calling feels right.
But the Amazon reviewer wasn't kidding when he called this ""Buffy 90210.""  You could also dub the season ""Buffy's Creek,"" or even ""Buffy the Vampire Slayer and the Cosby Kids:"" there are a lot of ""educational"" themes in this season, whether it's the pressure kids can face from their parents, the pain of social invisibility, or the casual cruelty high schoolers can inflict on one another.
Granted, it's all presented in a fantasy framework, but the consciousness-raising crashes through the show's growing mythology in a ham-fisted way.  You half expect to see Giles sitting on a stool and holding up a brochure at the end of a few episodes: ""If you'd like to talk to your teen about praying mantis intimacy, write to Keep Your Head On, P.O. Box 6339, Boulder, CO.""  The writers of the show later learned showing the pain of high school could be best accomplished by fleshing the characters out and watching them interact.  They sometimes reach that level in this season, especially with the depiction of the Buffy-Xander-Willow love triangle.  For the most part, though, the staff trusts the issues more than the characters, and it leaves the whole high school element of the show a bit hollow.
But there are a handful of great moments.  The aforementioned ""Puppet Show"" has an amusing twist on the haunted dummy theme, and ends with Buffy, Xander and Willow hilariously stumbling through a scene from the tragedy of Oedipus.  ""Nightmares"" marks the series' first use of dreams as a way of revealing its characters' inner psyches, with the perfect blend of humor and poignancy ""Buffy"" would make routine in following seasons.  And ""Prophecy Girl,"" where Buffy confronts the Master, is a masterpiece, a terrifically told story that neatly sums up the previous season and sets the stage for the next one.
But few episodes show the workmanship of those episodes, either taking a silly idea and running it into the ground (""The Pack,"" where Xander turns into a hyena) or ruining a decent episode with an unbelievable ending (""Out of Sight, Out of Mind"").  In this season, ""Buffy"" is very much a work in progress.
That doesn't mean it's bad; the show was just on the cusp of getting much better.  Newcomers should try Season 2, which becomes transcendant television almost from the get-go.  The central cast really comes to life in that season, and you won't miss anything if you skip this one.  Consider this a prequel, a set-up to the greatness that would follow.",1058745600,10,2935,4.865461847389558
1379199,4,B00004YWJE,"""Buffy the Vampire Slayer"" is a TV series take on the 1992 movie that Joss Whedon wrote.  Whedon didn't direct the movie, though, and he thought he could better communicate his ideas if he had control of a new ""Buffy"" show.  (The movie's director, Fran Rubel Kuzui, is one of the executive producers on the TV show.)  This first season was a late-winter entry in the new WB network's first (1996-1997) year in business, and contains only 12 episodes.
In the TV series Buffy is newly transplanted to fictitious Sunnydale, California, after having burned down the gymnasium (while fighting vampires, of course) in her old L.A. high school at the end of the movie.  Kristy Swanson, who played Buffy in the movie, is replaced by Sarah Michelle Gellar, already a TV veteran when she started the show at age 20 playing the 16-year-old sophomore.  No other characters from the movie appear in the TV series.  With a different location and characters Joss Whedon had a great deal of freedom to expand his vision, which started with the simple idea of a small, blonde teenage girl walking alone down a sinister dark alley -- until she's attacked by a monster.  This horror cliche becomes interesting when it turns out that the attacking vampire has met his doom because the blonde girl is The Slayer, the one girl in all the world chosen to stand against the vampires, demons, and other forces of darkness.
Much more information about the ""Buffy"" universe (or ""Buffyverse"") is available elsewhere, so I won't go into great detail here.  There are some significant differences between the movie and TV series visions of the vampires and demons existing on the periphery of our normal world.  In particular the TV series has slain vampires turning to dust, which helps maintain their status as fantasies to the uninformed majority of the human population.  And the TV series has Buffy amassing a close circle of high school friends who are privy to her secret, whereas the movie had a popular girl becoming alienated from her friends as a result of being Chosen.  The TV show has ample opportunity to demonstrate the everyday horrors of being in high school in addition to Sunnydale's supernatural terrors; the movie was a comic horror tale that didn't succeed as well in its message despite having a much higher budget.
As a mid-season replacement show on a new TV network, the budget for ""Buffy the Vampire Slayer"" was low by U.S. standards.  This first (short) season is distinguished by often-inadequate lighting, a theme song that was re-recorded in a later (4th?) season for better quality, and limited sets and special effects.  Yet it became a hit because of the writing and acting, featuring an innovative take on teenage creative speech which became known as ""Buffyspeak"".  Acknowledging the flaws, I still recommend this first season highly.
Each show in Season 1 of ""Buffy the Vampire Slayer"" is almost exactly 45 minutes.  Later seasons bring this average down; with more allowance for commercials and promotional spots the time for actual program content in the hour show drops to about 42 minutes by the middle of the 7-year run.  So there's more entertainment content possible in the first 2 seasons' episodes than in later years.
The DVD transfer of Season 1 is disappointing.  Each show appears pretty much as it was originally broadcast.  No apparent attempt was made to adjust for poor lighting or sound.  There are chapter stops, but many of them are misplaced -- some by up to a minute.  For instance, it's necessary to use the DVD fast forward or reverse to skip through the opening credits at the end of chapter 1 of each episode because the chapter 2 stops aren't placed properly.  In the DVD transfers of Seasons 3-4 the chapter stops are done correctly and the opening credits end just as chapter 2 begins.
The supplementary material is interesting for behind-the-scenes production information.  Writers and directors are the talents for the audio commentary tracks.  You have to wait until Season 4 to get any insights from a cast member.  I wouldn't rate the supplementary material as a compelling reason to buy any of the ""Buffy"" or ""Angel"" DVD sets as of mid-2003; you'll buy Season 1 and the later DVD collections because you'll want to revisit the Buffyverse, just as I do.
Summary: a 5-star show for its innovative ideas, writing, acting, and direction.  4 stars for the production values, with limited budget resulting in occasional sub-par lighting and sound.  Only 3 stars for the Season 1 DVD transfer.  Total score: 4 stars for this DVD collection.",1058572800,,4576,4.8785529715762275
1379200,4,B00004YWJE,"As annoying as I find Sarah Michelle Gellar (like she could really fight vampires with her cheap kicks, that's why she died so fast in Scream 2) I believe this is a good show. Season 1,3 and 4 were all great, but I'm just not a hyper fanatic of the series like some fans, I do like it alot, however. The show has fights, drama, cat fights, jokes (tacky ones) and great season finales. Season 1 is definately worth the price tag-12 great episodes! It was a mid-season replacement which is why there aren't 22 episodes like most others.",1058400000,,534,4.404040404040404
1379201,5,B00004YWJE,"I am a relatively new Buffy fan starting at the beginning, with no real sense of the direction future seasons may have taken.  The first twelve episodes of Season One certainly provide a wonderful introduction to the subject at hand, succeeding fabulously even when storylines wander into really weird places.  Few television shows could grow and prosper with such plot points as a substitute teacher who is actually a giant praying mantis, a girl who takes the concept of being invisible to everyone around her much too far, and an ancient demon who comes backs to life via the Internet.  In Sunnydale, a town residing directly over the Hellmouth, anything can happen and be accepted for what it is by both the characters as well as the audience.
There are many strengths to this show: Joss Whedon's vision, commitment, and talent; sharp writing by all concerned with different writers all moving seamlessly in a fictional world larger than themselves; excellent special effects; a genuinely unsettling atmosphere wrapped around a seemingly bright and sunny one; etc.  The greatest strength of the show has to be the actors, though.  Sarah Michelle Gellar is gorgeous as well as exceedingly believable in her role as the Slayer; Alyson Hannigan is captivating as the quiet, demure Willow Rosenberg; Nicholas Brendon brings an incredible amount of humor and teen-based reality to everything that happens as the Chandler Bing-ish Xander Harris; Charisma Carpenter is the quintessentially vain prom queen whose character Cordelia Chase really only begins to belie her stereotypical image toward the end of the season.  Topping them all, though, is Anthony Head in the role of Rupert Giles, the Watcher whose job it is to train and prepare Buffy in her role as the ordained Slayer.  His aura of professionalism, commitment, intelligence, and kindly authority injects a necessary dose of believability into an unbelievable world.  I'm rather ambivalent toward Angel (David Boreanaz), as I tend to share Xander's feelings of dislike for this mysterious man in Buffy's life.
One feels as if one knows these characters from the very beginning, identifying a great deal with some if not all of them.  Buffy just wants to be a normal sixteen-year-old girl, sometimes resisting her destiny as the one and only Slayer standing between the world and the apocalypse.  Xander is simply brilliant and hilarious to me as the normal guy trying to deal with impossible things as well as his undisguised and unrequited love for Buffy.  Willow is the smart and geekily unpopular kid who possesses a greater strength that she realizes, pining silently over Xander in the final ring of a weird little love triangle.  Eggheads like me, of course, celebrate the efforts of the scholarly Giles and identify with many of his old-school feelings and arguments.  It is not often that we are blessed with a librarian hero.
Season One has two dimensions to it.  First, it lays out the vague history of Sunnydale's newest student Buffy Summers, introduces the responsibilities and functions of the foreordained Slayer, and exposes us to a wide cross-section of the dangerous monsters that one would expect to converge on a place referred to as the Hellmouth.  Second, it assembles Buffy and her gang of friends into the first dream team of vampire slaying and other miscellaneous demonic extermination.  Buffy does most of the work, of course, but everyone plays a part in thwarting the incredibly threatening things that seem to rise up continuously in a town somehow still referred to as dull and boring.  At this time in Buffy's slaying career, her enemy is the ancient vampire named the Master; his attempts to free himself from his underground tomb and return to the surface serve as the backdrop of most of the major action of the season, leading up to a direct confrontation between him and Buffy in the final episode.
Perhaps no other show on television has given us so many great zingers and one-line catch phrases, digging deeply into the world of popular culture.  It also provides an impressively realistic look at youth and some of the issues young people confront in the normal, non-vampire world.  Buffy is about much more than slaying vampires, vanquishing demons, and the like.  Buffy, Xander, and Willow in particular deal with problems each of us have faced before alongside the type of evil threats that can be found only in Sunnydale, and it is this aspect of the show that truly connects with many of its fans.",1057968000,10,4501,5.0

But this season 12 episodes in all (10 less than 2-7).  It suffers the same as season 2 where the main story lets filler episodes (good ones) take the spotlight.

1379205,5,B00004YWJE,"Season 1 of 'Buffy The Vampire Slayer' was terrific. It set up the rest of the series brilliantly, and contains some of its best episodes. This was before things got very out of hand--the episodes here and light, fluffy and fun. The pilot was clever, bringing to it the feel of the film version, yet giving it a more sinister and deadly tone, darkening up things just a bit while keeping the whole ""Valley Girl"" feel. Characters are introduced who we think we'll never see again, but who cleverly show up in later seasons.
The show is witty and very well-written and developed. It's amazing how well thought out it all is. All the episodes here are stand-outs, playing like mini horror films, mixing teen angst, comedy, and horror flawlessly. The characters are exceptional, the actors have incredible chemistry, and the dialogue sparkles.
Season 1 is by far my favorite. I wish the show kept this tone a bit more throughout its later seasons. A terrific start to a great series.",1055980800,,979,4.730994152046784

The first season is a great one, which sets the pace for the entire series.  And while the first isn't too shabby, the later seasons get even better!",1055203200,2,385,4.647058823529412
1379207,4,B00004YWJE,"A show which re-defined a generation. Buffy The Vampire Slayer Season I was something never before seen before. A teen drama that actually made sense. Albeit the demons and mouth of hell. Buffy Season I is a beautiful sight not only because of the unparalelled writing behind the show, but also the realization of the show itself with the little resources available.
Taking an 18-year-old actress whose only true credits included an increasingly sappy soap opera, Whedon picked several other relatively new actors for his show. With it, he created a perfectly balanced chemistry which would propel many of the stars to genuine fame. His show also dared to depict demons and magic, a concept not touched on other shows of the time, save the X-Files, which never definitely had anything super-natural, only hints of it. Whedon's chance paid off. He created a show that would go on to last for seven years, and producing one spin-off, Angel.
I give the show four stars mainly due to the lack of believability, which was a product of the poor funding of the show so early on. Also, there was very little background information provided on the main characters, other than Angel. Buffy's past was never fully explained, as the creators did not want to mess with the continuity created by the cinematic version of the show with the same name. All in all, excellent. Its a must have for any BTVS or Angel fan.",1053216000,2,1401,4.769547325102881
1379208,5,B00004YWJE,"I must admit that when my brother first introduced me to the concept of Buffy the Vampire Slayer, I immediately denounced its credibility, ingenuity and mass appeal.  Who wants to watch a show about an ultra-petite, blonde bimbo whose resume largely encompasses slaying vampires and other eerie, under-the-bed creatures of the night?  Certainly not a sophisticated, know-it-all such as myself, but I eventually realized my monumental fallacy.  I recently bought the first season on DVD, and I must say that in a mere period of two days, I'd completed watching the entire set.  Season one, like all subsequent seasons, thoroughly enthralls my attention, releasing only when the final scene is finished and the last witty, one-liner is uttered.  I can't articulate how to describe the exhilaration I feel after the conclusion of each episode.  The clever coalescence of action, drama, horror, romance, and comedy truly captivates my senses and definitely contributes to the wide-ranging allure.  If you've ever experienced the dilemmas associated with high school life (and I'm sure you have), then you'll absolutely relate to the characters attending the high school from hell, or, well, directly above hell's mouth.  I would recommend purchasing this DVD set to any fan because it's well worth the money.  The acting is wonderful, the writing is magnificent, the individual and continuity episodes are excellent, and overall Joss Whedon is an extraordinary genius!",1052956800,3,1464,5.358078602620087

The juxtaposition of ""horror"" and comedy among high school students is wonderful. Vampire slaying becomes a metaphor for the dealing with the struggles of life. I'm an old guy, but I could identify with the metaphors.",1052352000,,421,5.0285714285714285

1379211,5,B00004YWJE,"When you break it down, all it took to make Buffy was great writing and great casting.
That is, of course, like saying all it took to make the Sistine Chapel was paint and a ladder.
How good is Buffy? So good it's scary. Or should be, to the witless clods who produce most television shows. Unless Joss Wheedon made a deal with a real demon (maybe not such a farfetched idea) he had no more and no less to work with when he started than anyone else. His show is just another television show, after all. No different, really, than, say, ""The Greatest American Hero"" or, for that matter, ""Charmed."" It's all just silly entertainment, right?
Ladies and gentlemen, to quote Stephen King (and who is more appropriate to quote here): ""You can drink your Dom Perignom from Waterford crystal or a Flintsones jelly glass, but folks, there IS a difference.""
Here is the difference. Buffy is not just entertainment, of either the guilty pleasure or the ""good-bad"" variety. It is great storytelling, told by great actors with terrific chemistry, backed up by people who believe in the show. It is television for people who hate television. It is horror/fantasy for people who hate horror and fantasy. It is just plain good (insert your favorite expletive).
What gets me when I watch the first season on DVD is that A) this show was a mid-season replacement (!) and B) that it was predicated on the largely forgettable movie of the same name, which came out in '95, two years before the TV show's debut. That's the creative equivalent of being picked 27th in the NFL draft and then turning into Joe Montana.
The DVD is of course ""light"" due to the fact it is only half a season (12 episodes) long, but who gives a damn? When every bullet in your gun is a magnum, you don't exactly need a thosuand rounds, do you?
Another striking feature is how quickly the actors took control of their characters and made them into people. For example, it took Anthony Stewart Head less than 3 episodes to have the ultra-complex Giles nailed down. That is incredible when you consider that many actors don't get a real feel for their characters in the first year or even two years of their shows (Patrick Stewart didn't have Capt. Picard down cold until the beginning of ""Trek's"" third season). It would have been so easy for Head to become a stodgy Van Helsing self-parody, or, in the words of Ethan Rayne, ""the snivelling, tweed-clad guardian of the Slayer"" (or in still other words, a Wesley Wyndham-Price character), but Head added layers to Giles almost immediately, and never stopped adding them. But to single out Head's skills is unfair, because the whole cast rocks. The actors are so good that just when you have decided on a favorite, somebody else steps to the plate and bam, it's a whole different home run race. Suffice to say good acting is one thing, good writing is another, but you can't buy this kind of chemistry.
My personal picks from the inaugural season (excluding the two part opener):
""Witch"": this episode is notable because it establishes right off the bat that Buffy doesn't just stake vamps, and shows how quickly the independent characters became the Scoobie Gang. If you watch this episode as a stand-alone, you will be struck by how smooth the interplay is between Giles, Xander, Willow, Cordelia, and Buffy. It has the feel of a troupe that's been working together for years. It is the third episode of the first season.
""Teacher's Pet"": Buffy's ability to self-parody using humor allows the writers to create the most ridiculous plots imaginable and still make them work. Plus Mrs. French is pretty hot. Who cares that she's really a giant shape-shifting praying mantis who eats teenage virgins? Great work by Nicholas Brendon.
""Never Kill a Boy...."" One of the things that makes BVS work so well is the fact that despite being a super-powered babe, Buffy is still stuck with the same problems as every other teenager: love triangles, homework, boy troubles, fights with Mom. In this outing she discovers that Slaying is one lonely gig. This is also a real showcase for the dude who plays the Master, who I'm convinced is the same guy who played Lt. Neidermeyer in ""Animal House."" (if I'm right about this, somebody please drop me a note)
""I Robot, You Jane"" Willow gets to flex against the demon Moloch, who unfortunately gets really, really dead at the end of the episode. Unfortunate because he was a great baddie (""Right now a man in China is transferring funds to an account in Hong Kong to have his mother killed (long pause) Good for him."")
""The Pack"" A tour de force for Nick Brendon, who plays a nastily self-confident villain so well you almost forget how bumbling and innefectual the normal Xander is. Probably his turn here got him more villain work in Season Three's ""Doppelgangland.""
""The Puppet Show"" Who doesn't find those damn dolls creepy? This one introduces the great principal Snider, who replaced hyena bait principal Flutie, and utters an all-time great Buffyism: ""Being friends with your students....that's the sort of woolly-headed liberal thinking that leads to being eaten."" It also has the funniest scene ever, when the Scoobies make a [weak] attempt to perform a stage version of ""Oedipus.""
It's worth noting that there are actually no bad episodes in the season, just some that stand out more than others (call it 12 - 0 with six or seven knockouts). Most everything is laid down that needs to be, including the show's basic mythology and the relationships between the characters (Xander's crush on Buffy, Willow's crush on Xander, Buffy's crush on Angel) that are so important to everything that follows later. What's truly amazing is that as good as all of this is, Spike and Drusilla haven't shown up yet, Angel hasn't gone bad, and Faith and the Mayor are way, way off. In other words, the best is still yet to come. What more could you ask for?
Oh yeah....season two.",1051833600,3,5908,4.7313288069835115
1379212,5,B00004YWJE,"This show is probably the best written and best acted TV series I have seen.  I have seen every episode of it, in now it's 7th and final season.  You can go back to the beginning and see how it all began.  The characters are unforgettable, their dialog is beautifully written, and personalities are well defined unique to each one.  One can enjoy the one liners especially from Xander, Buffy and Cordelia.  It is truly hilarious on one side, yet can switch instantly to touching and serious in the blink of an eye.  I recommend this DVD set to anyone, and the other seasons available as well.  I already own the first three seasons, and I plan to buy season four when it is released.",1051142400,,683,4.416
1379213,5,B00004YWJE,"I have never in all my life missed an episode of Buffy the Vampire Slayer because I loved it so much! Then I hear Buffy the Vampire Slayer Season One is coming out on DVD, and I was excited I got it the first day it came out.
My favourite episodes of Season One are ""Angel"", ""I Robot... You Jane"", ""The Puppet Show"", ""Nightmares"", and ""Prophecy Girl"". There could have been more Special Features for the First Season of Buffy, but overall it's GREAT! My favourite seasons are Season Two, Season Three, Season Five, and I know Season Seven is still not completely finished, but so far it is one of my favourite Buffy the Vampire Slayer Seasons.
If you're a Buffy fan, or if you like action shows/movies buy Season One of Buffy the Vampire Slayer, your life depends on it!",1050883200,,770,4.429577464788732
1379214,5,B00004YWJE,"The first season of ""Buffy the Vampire Slayer"" was awesome. I cannot begin to tell you how thrilling it is to sit down and watch a television show every week that has witty dialogue, down-to-earth characters, and action-packed scenes throughout every single episode. It's even better to buy a DVD set in which you don't have to worry about commercials or the terrible agony of a cliff-hanger that won't be explained until at least another week. ""Buffy"" is an amazing show all-around! Most first seasons need a little warming up to do, but not in this case. I can honestly tell you, yes, I am a huge fan of the series, but it is truly a great show. I was eight when the show first premiered. I was sitting in my room one night and was told to go to bed. Of course, being your typical eight-year-old, I turned on the television. Instantly, at age eight, I'm drawn into the world of ""Buffy."" It's a truly captivating show!
Season One is definitely one of my favorite seasons. It only contains twelve episodes, due to it being a mid-season replacement, but each one is filled with a new exciting theme. The main villain, however, is The Master Vampire. Buffy's objective is to stop him from rising, while dodging everyone he sends to try to stop her. Aside from this problem, there are a couple of episodes that have nothing to do with him, which I think is nice because it offered a break with side-episodes such as ""Witch"" and ""Out of Mind, Out of Sight."" Even with an outline of only twelve episodes, Joss Whedon (creator) and friends still manage to fit in these extras without taking away from the main point.
As for the actual DVD boxed set, it couldn't have gotten much better. It has a few nice photos and a small booklet inside which describes each episode. It folds out three times to reveal three discs, each containing four episodes. Those episodes are as follows:
Welcome to the Hellmouth:
 Buffy arrives at her new school, Sunnydale High, only to find out that she can't escape her true destiny. There she meets her new Watcher, Giles, and makes a couple of friends, Willow and Xander.
The Harvest:
 The second half of ""Welcome to the Hellmouth."" Buffy and friends materialize for the first time to fight off The Master's vampire gang intended to harvest Sunnydale and release him.
Witch:
 One of my favorite Season One episodes. This first non-vampire episode finds the gang dealing with someone harming members of the cheerleading squad.
Teacher's Pet:
 With the science teacher dead, things become even more mysterious when kids start disappearing after visiting the new substitute!
Never Kill A Boy on the First Date:
 Buffy's attempt at a normal life is shattered when a date is ruined by The Master's latest scheme.
The Pack:
 Xander starts acting strangely after a trip to a forbidden part of the zoo -- containing possessed hyenas.
Angel:
 Buffy gets to know Angel a little better -- for the worse!
I Robot, You Jane:
 Willow is seduced by a demon through the computer.
The Puppet Show:
 My other favorite episode about a demonic puppet featured in the school's talent show.
Nightmares:
 The season's most wild episode where the gangs' nightmares become reality and anything can happen. In my top-three list of Season One favorites.
Out of Mind, Out of Sight:
 Sometimes when people are ignored, they disappear. Only they usually don't come back and try to murder everyone that ignored them.....
Prophecy Girl:
 The show's season finale in which Buffy faces The Master and discovers her fate.
Bonus features include:
 - Exclusive interviews with Joss Whedon & David Boreanaz
 - Full-length commentary for ""Welcome..."" & ""The Harvest""
 - Photo Gallery
 - Character Bios, and much, much more!
With classic episodes such as ""Witch"" and ""Nightmares,"" Season One is clearly the best jump-start a show could have! Enjoy! PLEASE BE SURE TO READ MY REVIEW OF SEASON TWO & THREE ALSO!",1050105600,9,3893,4.770833333333333
1379215,4,B00004YWJE,"I started watching Buffy at the end of season one, so watching these for the first time was cool.  I was great learning all of the background on the story.  So, it was more educational for me.  The story telling wasn't too great though.  Buy season 3 for the complete package.  Buy this one only if you're a fan--like me.",1049673600,,321,4.283333333333333
1379216,5,B00004YWJE,Buffy the vampire Slayer is a cleverly written television series.  There are so few these days and I am glad to have been a part of it through the seasons.,1049587200,,155,4.166666666666667
1379217,5,B00004YWJE,"I was hesitant in buying the first season.  Most times, the first season of a show makes you wince and cringe when you re-watch them.  Shows usually take a season or two to come into their own.  There's usually a lot of hit-and-miss that goes on in first seasons of TV shows.  It had been a while since I had seen the first season of Buffy, so my fear was that I'd waste money watching a season I'd rather forget.  Not so!
In fact, I was surprised at how flawless the first season was delivered!  This intial season definitely stands on its own.  The quality of everything from acting to presentation never comes across as a fumbled attempt to make a series.  The writing is strong as ever, the jokes are funny, the actors are spot on, and the presentation and dress are hip, even now, years later.
The story, as all Buffy fans know, starts here with Buffy coming to Sunnydale, California to begin a new life with her mother.  Little known to her is that Sunnydale is actually ""the hellmouth.""  She's going to have her work cut out for her, but with the help of new friends, Willow and Xander, and her watcher (supervisor, guide, and trainer) Rupert Giles, she starts letting the demonic Sunnydale residents know that the slayer's in town, and she's making it her own.
I was actually talking about Buffy the other day with my husband.  He didn't pay much heed to Buffy before we bought this DVD set, but he couldn't get enough of Buffy after the first episode!  Now, he watches the latest season with me every week.  We spoke about how Buffy the Vampire Slayer holds the very rare distinction of being the only series we've seen that had a strong start to begin with.  Regardless of being new to TV, this first season didn't skip a beat.  It was as if the writers, producers, and actors had been doing Buffy for years and years before.  What a way to start off the show!
I think that this season, now looking in retrospect, is truly my favorite.  The entire season was strong, and there's really a beautiful nostalgia to it.  It's the most innocent of all the seasons, and Buffy's troubles were simple.  The drama with Faith, Angel, Spike, and Dawn didn't begin yet.  The biggest evil in Buffy's life at this point is high school, and there's something really enjoyable in that simplicity.
Simply put, I can't believe I had actually waited the amount of time I did to buy this set.  I bought it two months after it was released, but I'm glad I did.  I've since then bought seasons two and three, and they are the perfect solution to a rainy day.",1049587200,,2545,4.439655172413793
1379218,5,B00004YWJE,This is a must have if you love Buffy. This picks up where the movie left off. It also introduces everyone so you get to see how everyone came to know that Buffy was the Slayer. The only down point was that the budget was kinda low so there are some really cheesy moments. But other than that it's great.,1049500800,,304,4.083333333333333
1379219,5,B00004YWJE,"The old cliche holds true once again. Let me be frank, I tend to regard 99% of television shows as contrite, banal, and/or down right insultingly stupid. The writing is generally awful and as for the characters, they tend to be shallow, painfully uninteresting and naturally, I could not care less about what happens to them. Therefore, I never even gave a single thought to watching a show which,concerned itself with an attractive teenage valley girl who kills vampires. How could that possibly be good? Then one fateful night, when I could not sleep due to suffering from a severe head cold that left me feeling particularly self-abusive, I set upon a course of action which, seemed to promise the intensification of my current discontent. I turned on the TV. Flipping through the channels, I soon came across an episode of Buffy the Vampire Slayer. This is good, I thought. Soon the pain will become so intense that I will pass out and finally get some rest. Instead, I became a fan!
In point of fact, I found the show quite intriguing. The episode responsible for my conversion was the one in which Oz returns to Sunnydale and Willow has to deal with confusing feelings for both her former boyfriend, Oz, and current girlfriend, Tara. (Note to reader: this was not a season one episode.) Soon I realized that if I was truely going to discover what was actually going on, I would have to start at the beginning. So I bought this DVD set. Why this sudden turn about? Simply put, I not only care about the main characters, I love them. The reason I love them? Joss Whedon's brilliant, witty, and insiteful writting combines with a refreshingly talented cast to give each character the authentic and dynamic depth of a real person. All this is achieved despite the over all fantasy aspect of the program which, in itself is really amazingly good fun.
The first season naturally introduces the main characters. Buffy Summers (Sara Michelle Gellar), is the beautiful yet, often maddeningly immature girl struggling to have a normal teenage existance, dispite her ""chosen"" status as the slayer. Xander Harris (Nicholas Brendon), is Sunnydale High School's resident loser with the heart of gold and who's single best trait is his unswerving loyalty to his friends. Willow Rosenberg (Alyson Hannigan, famous as the ""flute girl in American Pie), is the loveably sensitive, highly intelligent and emotionally vulnerable girl who rounds out the trio. As season one progresses and the monsters fall prey to the slayer one by one, the three misfits begin to learn about life, love, and death, while forming the bonds of a triangular friendship that ultimately gives the show its most valuable and enduring feature. So give Buffy the Vampire Slayer a chance and you might just find yourself joining Buffy, Xander, Willow (My personal favorite, I simply adore redheads.) and the rest of the ""Scooby Gang"" as they begin to grow up by battling vampires, and more importantly, by confronting and eventually slaying the personal demons residing within each of them.",1049500800,,3050,4.912790697674419
1379220,5,B00004YWJE,"The first season of Buffy the Vampire Slayer was only 12 episodes long, but it is packed from end to end with some of the most worthwhile material to ever be broadcast on television.  From the gripping initial two-parter to the amazing season finale, even when the show has to slow down and do an ""average"" episode, it is still moving characters and overarching plot forward in almost every scene.
The two-parter -- ""Welcome to the Hellmouth"" and ""The Harvest"" seems to overcome the problems of a new series effortlessly, integrating everyone into the plot and kicking things off spectacularly.  And Buffy set high expectations for itself every time.  The third episode, ""Witch,"" was captivating from end to end and got the normal episodes moving on a good pace.  ""Teacher's Pet"" is the first of the ""average"" bunch, but it is still a well told story.
We begin to see the development of a trend in Buffy's social life in ""Never Kill a Boy on the First Date,"" which sets her up as not being able to have a normal relationship - ever.  (The twist it takes on the boy's reaction is fascinating as well.)  ""The Pack"" is actually rather frightening, all told, mostly because of how it has Xander in the group that is overcome with a curse and thereby tempers how it will be handled.  ""Angel"" contains one of the greatest revelations of the series, and it sets up the romance that would define so much of the first three seasons of Buffy.  ""I Robot...You Jane"" does a great job of introducing a fan favorite character, Jenny Calendar, in a rather amusing twist on a demon unleashed plot.
""The Puppet Show"" likewise pulls a great twist in its individual plot, and introduces Armin Shimerman as the most memorable of the unlucky principals of Sunnydale High.  ""Nightmares"" is a fascinating tale of reality being merged with the characters' darkest dreams; a LOT of character comes out of it as well.  ""Out of Mind, Out of Sight"" does a good job with suspense and an invisible girl.  And it is wrapped up with a resounding bang in ""Prophecy Girl.""
Buffy, from its very beginning, loved to push the envelope of its horror stereotypes in just the right ways, while keeping enough in tact that it would be quite comfortable for the viewer.  The vampires are great, especially Mark Metcalf as the Master, and Angel is the exception that proves the rule:  vampires are bad, 'kay?  Having vampires be the bad guys in a world of Anne Rice novels and Vampire: the Masquerade was a daring move, and I think Buffy pulled it off with style.  It also gave a nicely rotating list of monsters with enough in the way of inventive twists that it avoided becoming a predictable monster-of-the-week show.  And through it all, the season-length plot was advanced at a solid pace.  Even more amazingly, the writing was generally in the top notch for TV screenwriting.  Yeah, it was demonstrably written for television, but the overall impact is still a lot better than most TV shows get.
Then there's the acting.  Quite frankly, I think the main cast of Buffy for the first few seasons was one of the finer assemblages of actors on a TV cast.  Sarah Michelle Gellar is definitive in her portrayal of the heroine who would love to be normal.  Anthony Stewart Head, as her Watcher, pulls off something amazing with his academic-but-deep character.  Nicholas Brendon's Xander is generally the show whipping boy, but he retains a spark throughout.  Alyson Hannigan's Willow opens up the geekish girl type a lot.  Charisma Carpenter as Cordelia gets more interesting than a simple beauty queen.  And of course David Boreanaz gets to be brooding and romance buffy as Angel.  The bunch are probably one of the better ensembles you'll get a chance to see, and every episode of Buffy seems to feature them at their best.  The villains are good, too, especially watching Mark Metcalf chew scenery as the vampiric Master (a very prototypical villain, less interesting as a concept but a good introduction).
Buffy the Vampire Slayer, despite the short run of its first season as a replacement show, was the entire package right from the start.  Give it a whirl.",1049414400,,4120,4.73249299719888
1379221,5,B00004YWJE,"I had never seen a single episode before gambling on the box set purchase.
I have to tell ya, I was pleasantly blown away from the first episode, and frankly amazed by the season finale.
This show should appeal to a wide variety of people. Those who appreciate intelligent sci-fi-ish stuff (think X-Files or latter-day Star Trek), as well as those who love high school drama (think 90210 or Dawson's). Action drama fans, who like NYPD Blue or CSI, will also find a lot to love, plus there's Buffy kick-boxing or whatever you call the stuff she does, which is like nothing else on TV.
It reaches for epic heights, told in loving details. It's style is ""modern Dickensian"", if that makes any sense at all.
You will laugh out loud at least thrice per episode, and be startled more than once.
Get past the title, and you're are in for landmark television. The only thing to worry about, is that they don't release ALL the seasons eventually.
I've got to see how this all ends.",1048809600,,972,4.528409090909091

They are witty, hilarious, and sometimes tear jerking. The filming is inpecable, and despite the modest budget nothing, is done cheaply. The characters are all interesting, and you grow attached to them, like a chia pet. There are also a few features, audio commentary and interviews for selected episodes. As well as, photo galleries. Anyone who likes comdies, mild horror, and obviously girls who kick ... should watch.",1048377600,,555,5.043478260869565
1379223,5,B00004YWJE,"As a Buffy fan, and I'm sure fellow Buffy fans can relate. It's refreshing to return to the beginning of the cult hit; Buffy the Vampire Slayer. This is where it all begins, this is the root of what is now something that isn't just a TV show, it isn't just actors. It's something that we've grown to love. Something that is now a part of us. I know that may sound cheesy, but I know I'm not the only one who feels that way.
Season 1, what can I say? It where the legand begins. We first meet Buffy Summers in Welcome to the Hellmouth and the Harvest where she faces the Big Bad of season 1; the Master. At first glance, Buffy comes off as being snobby, Miss-I'm-So-Popular, but when you get to know her, she's anything but. She is that girl, who is overlooked. She posesses strength (and not only physical!) and kindness. She is your best friend and you can't help but love the girl. We watch as she struggles to fit into her new school, Sunnydale High. A lifelong friendship is built between Buffy, Willow and Xander (and the bookworm; Giles.. and even the self-centered Cordy).
This is also the season when Buffy meets the mysterious man (or vampire) that we all know as Angel. We see the developing attraction between both of them, we also see the conflicts that they both face, but overall, we see their love blossom.
This season is just... the BEGINNING.
The DVD set includes 3 discs with ALL 12 first season episodes which are:
Welcome to the Hellmouth
The Harvest
The Witch
Teacher's Pet
Never Kill a Boy on the First Date
The Pack

1379224,5,B00004YWJE,"Harold Bloom, in The Western Canon, tells us that world-changing literature, like the works of Shakespeare or the J Writer of the Old Testament, can be identified by two salient features: 1) a profound interogation of the language -- puns, wordplay, double-meanings and the like, and 2) a complete disregard for existing genre, jumbling all manner of existing story types into something new.
Both of these are key features of this late addition to the Canon, Buffy the Vampire Slayer. Appearing on (barely) network television only by a perfect storm of events (Joss Whedon's towering talent and love of junk culture, note-perfect casting, and a struggling netlet that considered 2.8 million viewers an acceptable audience), Buffy not only survived, but thrived (in cultish fashion).
This is the incomparable first year. Lighter, fluffier, and argubly wittier than later, longer seasons, these first 12 episodes introduced the seemingly ludicrous notion that a bunch of photogenic twentysomethings posing as teens, battling vampires with martial arts and purposefully tangled syntax, could be the best thing on televison. And give Bill Shakespeare a run for his money (Bloom said it, not me).
At its best (here, the season opener and finale) this dazzingly written and conceived show can trump anything else in media.",1047340800,,1316,5.331730769230769
1379225,5,B00004YWJE,"Now that it is official, and ""Buffy the Vampire Slayer"" will come to an end it is all the more reason to catch up on your DVD collection, begining with this not yet qiite perfect but totally indispensable first season of this extraordinary show. Get all the others, too: This thing keeps getting better and better, gaining fresh momentum with each season, never lame, never repetitive, and certainly never boring in all of seven years. That is all you can wish for in any show.

""Buffy"", which so successfully evaded any insipid one-way labelling as ""horror"", ""mystery"", or even ""drama"", continued to thrill more than its original teenage target audience with its intricately woven levels of metaphor, with the most sparkling casual wit since Oscar Wilde, with a whole world of clever cultural cross-referencing, and last but not least with a thorough love of language and all its splendours (and not just the much talked-about teen lingo, just think of multi-layered episode titles like ""Earshot"", ""Pangs"", or ""Entropy"").

This show is really anything but kids' stuff. It's not just ""feminist"" either, although it is more than refreshing to see women for once being in charge, being obviously and naturally in cool and complete control, empowered to the brim, without degrading men either. But ""Buffy""'s merits also include depicting overachievers, underachievers, hormonally overcharged boys, emotionally neglected youths, and many more sadly under-represented average existences other than the popular and the beautiful, and depicting them in a way that actually is at the same time fair and realistic. Yes, realistic it is, which may come as a bit of a shock to people who up to now only knew that this is a show about a blonde girl fighting vampires and demons with taek-won-do. Go, watch it: You'll be surprised!  Then there is the fine and differentiated handling of love and addiction, of violence and self-control, of loss and depression (which the frequently misunderstood season six was all about). All of these are things you don't see dealt with that recommendably very often, certainly not on television.
The casting is exceptional, too. Every single actor gives a brilliant performance, with Sarah Michelle Gellar pulling through the years of her demanding job with as much discipline and talent as Buffy herself, and Alyson Hannigan outgrowing herself so quickly she definitely needs to be in a lot more movies as soon as possible.

Fortunately DVD collections have been invented, so this legacy can be cherished and passed on to generations to come. I have no doubt it will.",1047168000,,2591,5.10377358490566
1379226,4,B00004YWJE,"I didn't start watching the Buffy series until the sixth season, so I was incredibly delighted to find that the entire first season on DVD.  Unlike the video sets, which only gave us ""select, important"" episodes, the entire season is available for our viewing pleasure.  Little can be said about the episodes themselves, as they have become cult classics with a good reason.  The story is intriguing, the characters interesting, and it's fun to watch.  However, many of the functions on the DVDs themselves are bad.  For example, the navigation is poor.  There is no direct link from the main menu to special features.  Additionally, the special features are somewhat wanting.  Josh Whedon is the only one interviewed, and it would have been nice to hear from the other characters in the series, especially Sarah and David.  Still, it's great to get to watch the whole season, uninterrupted, and not have to catch sporadic reruns on FX.  For that, it deserves the four star rating.",1046563200,,981,4.890909090909091

1379231,5,B00004YWJE,"If someone had said to me a couple of years ago that I, someone who is definitely NOT a horror/fantasy/sci-fi fan, would become a devout fan of the TV series Buffy The Vampire Slayer, I would have laughed in their face. I mean, how interesting could a TV show based on vampires really be??
During season 4 of Buffy, a friend made me watch the episode entitled 'Hush', and despite myself, I was quite impressed. I then started watching the Buffy reruns on cable. Though watching parts of seasons here and there gets very confusing when following storylines and character development. Then Buffy started to be released on DVD season by season. My chance to catch up with Buffy!!!!
What initially struck me as I first starting watching season 1 on DVD was how 'raw' the shows were. Though raw in a good way. First seasons of TV shows usually have much lower budgets and hence the special effects and musical scoring aspects are usually more noticably lacking than later seasons. But this first 12 episode introduction to Buffy is something special. We see some wonderful storylines - not just about vampires, but stories involving demons, possessions and magic. The writers on Buffy truely are creative geniuses to come up with wonderful, interesting and believable storylines such as those in season 1 (well, believable in the Buffy sphere!)
Whilst this show is about vampires, demons, and other paranormal phenomenon, these are really only metaphors used to illustrate the concepts of the turmoil of teenager years and developing into adulthood. If it were purely based around the paranormal, this show would have bombed, but thankfully the writers saw fit to address the themes that we all have faced (or will face) in life.
The DVD itself is very nicely packaged. The quality of the picture itself is somewhat lacking sometimes  - though this is to be expected since season 1 was shot on 16mm film and there are alot of night shots on Buffy. However the quality is still improved to that of a normal TV reception.
The extras include a Joss Whedon and David Boreanaz interview - whilst entertaining, it hardly gives away much information. A very clever music video for 'I Quit' is including also - great to see how music video footage and Buffy footage is combined to create a very entertaining video. The usual cast biographies, photo gallery and trailer are also on offer here, but the one extra that stands out is the audio commentaries on episodes 1 and 2. These were done by creator/writer/director/executive producer Joss Whedon who is not only entertaining to listen too, he also divulges alot of interesting information here. If you get this DVD pack, make sure you give these a listen....
What could be better than having access to season 1 Buffy episodes at any time on DVD???  It may not be as polished as subsequent series, but the raw energy and the blood, sweat and tears of the cast and crew of what would go on to become a cultural phenomenon makes for highly entertaining and original television.",1042156800,2,3013,4.803468208092486

It's great to have this collection of hip, scary and amusing episodes, in order, whenever I want them.  This is by far my favorite season.  I think any Buffy fan will not be disappointed with this purchase.",1042070400,,365,4.323529411764706
1379233,4,B00004YWJE,"When the kids of Sunnydale High meet new comer Buffy Summers, they write her off as another perky blonde with a smart mouth that likes to get into trouble. What they don't know is that when school's over, while most kids her age are out dating, going to football games and having fun with their peers, she's out saving the world from an impending doom known as the Hellmouth.
This basically sets the tone of the show. While most people threw their noses up at it's premise (including me at first), the small audience that began watching it were treated to something unlike anything else. A tv show that dealt with tough issues head on using metaphors along the way. Buffy wasn't just some sunny haired airhead saving the world on a weekly basis, she was deep. She faced problems and challenges that all teens go through plus some. It's the plus some that made the show such a hit. Tv shows like Dawson's Creek and 90210 never seemed to quite get it like BTVS did. We all have problems, but with Buffy, she had the weight of the world on her shoulders - literally - and that's pretty much what alot of teens feel like.
The show featured many characters that we all have come to know and love such as the kind hearted computer nerd Willow, the geeky and sarcastic Xander, the seemingly evil and selfish cheerleader Cordelia, the bad boy that we weren't supposed to fall for, but couldn't help swooning over, Angel and the wise beyond his years watcher Mr. Giles who not only served as a source of guidance, but also as a friend.
These characters now have a special place inside all of our hearts, because they touch us and we can relate to them. Everyone knows someone who helps them through life's toughest battles just as these characters aided Buffy through her problems. And although she doesn't win every fight, she always makes it through and back in 1997 when the show was airing, that was something us teens didn't get to see. That is why Buffy has become such an icon for people around the world.
Not only does the show connect with it's audience, but the show really is good. That may be an opinion, but it's many people's opinion. Many critics have kept BTVS on their Top 5 Favorite Shows Of The Year list since it began. The dialogue is witty, refreshing and to this day still stands to be original. The acting is top notch with everyone turning in a fine performance as always. The actors seem born to play these roles. The storylines are great. There's alot of building plotlines for the future that set the foundation for what's to come.
Overall the first season was a great one that had a spooky Twilight Zone feel to it. The monsters and demons all looked great from week to week. Everyone involved did a great job, but it was only the beginning...",1041724800,7,2763,4.495029821073559
1379234,5,B00004YWJE,"Okay I love this DVD but this question is for Buffy Freaks like me. In episode 7 Angel- the master tries to kill Buffy with the ""three"" and then Darla. Why would he try to kill Buffy when he knows about the prophecy in ""Prophecy Girl"". Dosn't he clearly say if she didn't come he couldn't leave. Why try to kill her. This is the only episode where he delibritly attempts to kill her, but why. Wouldn't he have screwed himself by doing this. Or was he just trying to injure her...",1041638400,,479,4.217391304347826

Coming out that she's the Slayer in ""Welcome to the Hellmouth"" where they let some of her frends find out. The first season lets you know from the start she doesn't just fight vampires, but there are witch's, demons, etc. that it also revolves around. It also shows that this show is like no other. It's not all about fighting and destroying evil. It's about her as a teen. She's growing up too. Dealing with crushs, friends, tests, and parents are part of her life too, just like ours. This season is great but if you really want to step into Buffy and love it, get the Complete Second Season. There is a lot of stuff there that is just great and you will discover that too.",1040947200,,815,4.333333333333333
1379237,5,B00004YWJE,"and I loved it! I was debating on 4 or 5 stars, because it isn't the best Buffy season, but it's really good! 4.5 stars I would give it, but that's not an option! So, I'll just give it as much help as it needs! Here's what I think of each episode:
 Welcome To Hellmouth: 9.5/10 One of the best episodes in the season, really well acted, and done nearly perfect!
 The Harvest: 10/10 The sequel to the first two episodes ever made, and it's made slightly better then the 1st. I loved it!! Really done well by Sarah!
 Witch: 8.5/10 Amy comes into this one, I don't like her much, just to say and I'm glad she didn't turn into a regular! Really interesting one though, and also very funny because Buffy joins the cheerleading squad!
 Teacher's Pet: 9/10 There's a hot substitute that Xander and the rest of the guys fall in love with. the actual science teacher was killed, but by what?
 Never Kill A Boy On The First Date: 8.5/10 Not bad, brings in a new guy who dances with Buffy, makes Cordelia jealous and then finds out what Buffy's life is really like, and goodbye!
 The Pack: 9/10 Xander turns into a Hyena as well as a group of kids that he hates. Pretty cool episode!
 Angel: 8/10 I'm one of those who doesn't care too much about Angel, he's too moody most of time and doesn't bring too much delight, unlike Buffy! But he's supposed to be that way, so I except him! And despite Angel being the centre of attention, this episode turned out pretty good!
 I Robot... You Jane: 9.5/10 Scary, a demon named Moloch gets trapped into a computer! He makes everyone love him, especially Willow because she brought him back to life, from a book!!
 The Puppet Show: 9.5/10 I really enjoyed this one, and the end is so funny when the put on the show! Buffy, Xander and Willow doing a talent show, funny!! Where as the puppet, what's with it? is it a killer or not, you'll be surprised when you find out what he really is!!
 Nightmares: 10/10 A kid named Billy gets nightmares become real! Very scary and Buffy even dies and shows her vampire face in this one, only, it's not reality so it doesn't count!
 Out Of Mind, Out of Sight: 9.5/10 A girl is invisible to everyone, so she becomes invisible and starts attacking everyone close to Cordelia! Then her! Really cool episode where you finally see Buffy on Cordelia's side, for the 1st time!
 Prophecy Girl: 9.5/10 Not as good as the other season finally's, only finally done worse was the 4th season's, that would still get about 8.5 or 9 out of 10. Buffy goes out to defeat the Master from opening the Hell mouth. Will she fail or succeed, well, either way, you don't give up!
 The bonus features: 8/10 All you get is Joss Whedon explaining half of the episodes, not really good, but it's good enough as it has a photo section, of about 10 to 15 pictures.
 This season wasn't the best, but wasn't the worst. None of the episodes really stood out, like other seasons, but it was acted very well, and some were really funny! Really hand it to Buffy for this season! Willow, Xander, Cordelia and Giles also delivered fairly good humour and you get introduced to the new principle, who gets swallowed by the mayor at the end of season 3, thankfully!! Great season, buy it and it's not too dark like other reviews say! At least not on my tv!",1040860800,,3281,4.375

1379241,4,B00004YWJE,"I'm a big fan of the show. I bought both season 1 and 2, my only gripe about the DVD sets are the picture quality. Most of the scenes are just too dark, and due to the nature of the show, a lot of them are set at night. So it was painful sometimes despite being such an incredible show! I hope the following seasons release will not have such problems, will it be too much if 5.1 dobly surround or dts be added?",1037491200,,411,3.9047619047619047
1379242,4,B00004YWJE,"Programs on Fox, are not a regular part of my TV menu, so believe it or not, prior to purchasing this set, I had never seen a complete episode of ""Buffy"" before.  The program premiered in 1997, and is still going strong, and this seemed like a good opportunity to check out this series from its genesis, and see what all the fuss is about.
The series gets off to a strong start with the opening episode ""Welcome to Hellmouth"", where the characters are introduced, and premise of vampires running loose in southern California, and being challenged by beautiful teenage heroine Buffy Summers, and her high school friends, is established.  Buying into the basic storyline is essential.  This is made easier by the quirky and engaging characters, strong writing, ""hip"" dialog, and relatively well done action sequences.  The American high school experience, though it has certainly evolved over time, contains elements of commonality that make it somewhat universal.  No matter how many years have past, most of us can still identify in some way, with these characters, and situations.  If you can't believe that there are vampires running loose in California, then this program I'm afraid is simply not for you.
Buffy, the series, travels an interesting path, as it targets a young audience, and seeks to present a mixture of humor, horror, science fiction and adventure.  This is a challenging task, given the limitations of the medium, and the target audience.  The focus of the episodes varies, as the different elements are emphasized.  With such a diverse range of subject matter, it is to be expected that the program does not always succeed in delivering a high quality, original episode every time out.  Still, the overall story quality of the 12 episodes of Season One, is pretty good.
The ensemble cast, is more than a collection of ""beautiful people"".  These young actors are quite talented.  Sarah Michelle Gellar, makes you believe in this unconventional story.  Though it is often hard to believe that this character is supposed to be only sixteen years old.  Alyson Hannigan simply shines as ""Willow"".  And the rest of the cast of is also very capable, with Nicholas Brendon, David Boreanaz and Charisma Carpenter.  Anthony Stewart Head, is vital in the role of ""Giles"", providing guidance, and when necessary an unsteady physical presence.  Regarding the ""look"" of the show, this is not a criticism, merely an observation, but this show appears to be very ""white"".  It doesn't seem to realistically reflect the ethnicity of southern California, with few Latino, Black or Asian characters featured.  Perhaps this changes over time.
Creator and executive producer Joss Whedon's comments are featured on the first two episodes.  His comments, delivered in a rather droll manner, are both extremely informative, and humorous.  Always conscious the budgetary constraints, his insights are so enlightening to a newbie.  Too bad he wasn't able to comment on more episodes, but at least this collection has some commentary tracks, few DVD collections of TV programs feature them.  I must disagree with one of Whedon's assertions concerning the lighting of the show always being well done, as there are numerous instances where the picture quality was a bit too dark and grainy, but that's not unexpected for a TV production.
This compact, attractively packaged set, covered with images of the beautiful Ms. Gellar, is probably a ""must"" for long-time fans.  As a newcomer, I generally liked what I saw, and was still able to find the series understandable and entertaining, despite my advancing years, and have since purchased Season Two of the series.  Looking forward to the continuing adventure.",1037404800,,3702,5.099502487562189
1379243,4,B00004YWJE,"In my opinion, Buffy the Vampire Slayer is still great, if not better, even in its seventh season. But nothing can compare to the very first season, when everything was a little darker, a little freakier, a little newer. I didn't start watching Buffy until its fourth season, so I had to rely on those handy reruns on TV in order to catch up on everything from the very beginning.
Now, I have to say I like the later episodes better (mainly because Spike is my favorite character, and he didn't become a series regular until season 4), but season one was great nonetheless. The later episodes have been wittier, and sometimes sillier, but they can't compare to the creepiness of the first season, when Buffy first appeared at Sunnydale High, which just happened to be built over the Hellmouth. This was back when Buffy was a cheerleader by day, slayer by night; Xander was a total nerd; Willow was a sweet little wallflower; Cordelia was a snob; Angel was a vampire; and Giles- well, he was the trusty librarian/watcher. They were the good old days, when Buffy and the gang made all the high school viewers in the world appreciate their own high school, because no matter how bad their school was, they could at least say it wasn't built over a camping ground for every kind of evil imaginable.
Included on this 3-DVD set are the series' first 12 episodes (remember? It was a mid-season replacement), interviews with creator Joss Whedon, commentary on the pilot episode, ""Welcome to the Hellmouth"", trailers, and more. For any Buffy fan, this is a must-have. Although I would have preferred a few more special features (how about interviews with the cast?), it's still a fine compilation for a fine television show.",1037232000,,1715,4.739130434782608
1379244,4,B00004YWJE,"Buffy is a great show, which may not appeal to many different age groups, but does appeal to fans of many different genres, horror, comedy, action, fantasy, romance, and drama (the last two being far more abundant on season 2). Season 2 and 3 are considerably better than season 1, but season one is still a must to own, particularly if you are new to the show. If you're pretty new to it, or have only caught a few random episodes on TV it'll get you started, and you'll enjoy the other seasons much more. And even if you've seen every episode it's still nice to have around to watch every now and then. Some episodes are rather dull to see over and over, but some such as the pack, and teachers pet are a joy to watch countless times! The show really has it all.

1379246,5,B00004YWJE,"Hi there,
I live in europe and would like to share some thoughts..here in europe(I live in holland) we have season 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5(in a couple of days/weaks) released on DVD.
The US sets are much cheaper than what we get, our sets are about the same price as your X files box sets and sometimes even expensiver than that.
We also have a more beautifull packaging(kind of a book thing).
Back to this set, Season 1 is not the best season(if we are talking about quality) that is/are season 4 and up(widescreen(!), better sound, more extra's etc.
but still it's worth buying, the quality of our season 1 is okay but not stunnig.
A friend of mine has also got the us edition and we compared it and i think the region 2 is slightly better(my opinion).
But season 3 is a lot better!(If you wanna buy a good set, this is for u) the quality is verry much improved compared to season 1+2(wich are the worst quality of all)the menu's are easier and you don't have that symetery walk trough thing.
Season 4 is really good, it's in my opinion not a good season but the dvd's are the best! Widscreen finally.. and it looks soooooo much beter! the sound and extra's are also fare more beter than the previous sets.
Season 5 is also verry promosing, this box has probally the best extra's and is also widscreen blablabla...
I just wanted to let you know what you can suspect, it's a shame you don't get the same packaging...season 1 fold out to a crussifix(is this the right way to spell it? ;) and season 2 and up had some sort of book style wich is verry beautifull and easy to use.
So keep in mind that this is info about region 2 sets(region 4 has other packaging wich is not really nice)I don't know if the upcoming us boxes will have the same quality..because there's such a price difference..
If you decied to buy region 2(because you cant wait or someother reason) keep in mind that only th UK, and Dutch and Belgium sets have the special packaging..
The German(cut's the season in half(except S1)) and frence(cut's the season in half and also has whole season in a different packaging, like the us packaging) and australian(region 4, cut's the season in half)editions have other different packaging..
I have all the seasons and have never had had any problems what so ever with these dvds(no skipping, no pixelateting(is this the way to spell it?), we almost never had those kind of things..
I hope this helps in your decicien.. :)

1379250,5,B00004YWJE,"I discovered BUFFY one night when I was about fifteen.  I think the way I found it was that I was flipping through the channels and saw James Marsters and David Boreanaz in a scene together.  My hormones decided for me that this must be a show worth watching, if the male characters were so cute.  Mind you, as a typical teenage girl I didn't really appreciate the undercurrents of drama and excitement throughout the storyline.  My mind was one-track, focussed on the 'salty goodness' as Cordelia would have put it.
I got into the series about halfway through the second season, and since then I've tried my darndest to watch every episode.  The plot is riveting, the characters are believable, and the cinematography is excellent.  There have been episodes where I've been so drained after watching them that I become nearly depressed.  I've been known to cry during the episodes.
The DVDs are helping me get through the semester.  I own both season 1 and 2 now, and I watch an episode in the place of the one showing on UPN, because I have a French course that extends through the time slot on Tuesday night.  I love going back and watching episodes like ""The Pack"" or ""Becoming, II"" - which, incidentially, goes on my list of the top ten BUFFY episodes ever.
The picture is a bit grainy in the first season DVD, which is understandable, considering the budget that the crew had to work with.  Also, there aren't many special features, but it's alright, because I didn't buy the DVD set for the features.  I bought it because it's much more organized than my stack of bootlegged video tapes that are sitting, collecting dust, in a crate next to my entertainment center.

1379252,5,B00004YWJE,"Season 1 of Buffy the Vampire Slayer is excellent, but I still do not consider it worthy of the title of ""one of the best Buffy seasons"" because it simply isn't. For a start there are a total of 12 episodes in Season 1 compared to the 22 in all the other Buffy seasons. Secondly, there isn't a lot of character development, most of which comes later on in the splendid Season 2. Thirdly, 20th Century Fox gave Joss Whedon a limited budget on which to film 12 episodes, making most episodes rather poor in sound quality, picture quality and special effects. Despite these few let-downs the season in terms of scripts, humour and character personality is absolutely excellent. Anyway, I'll get on with my review...

Season 1 starts with a brilliant two-parter season opener in the form of Welcome To The Hellmouth and The Harvest. Both episodes were first broadcast on March 10th 1997 in the US to great critical acclaim. Buffy Summers (Sarah Michelle Gellar) and her mum Joyce (Kristine Sutherland) have moved from Los Angeles to Sunnydale, California. Buffy ""fell in with the wrong crowd"" and burned down the gym. What everyone doesn't know is that Buffy was trying to kill some vampires; she found out she was to be the Slayer before coming to Sunnydale. Figuring her Slaying days are far behind her, she hopes to make a fresh start at Sunnydale High School. On her first day, she makes friends with Willow Rosenberg (Alyson Hannigan) - a nerdy, unpopular, computer whizz-kid with a heart of gold and a personality to make anyone who encounters her turn to slush! She also meets Xander Harris (Nicholas Brendon) who is the best friend of Willow. She is also introduced to Cordelia Chase (Charisma Carpenter), who is kind to her on her first day at school. ""If you hang with me and mine, you'll be accepted in no time,"" she proudly states to Buffy. It's clear that Cordelia is obssessed with being popular and loved by everyone. But after Cordelia sees Buffy hanging around with Willow and Xander, she turns on her - spreading rumors about her that last up until the end of the season. Buffy also meets up with the school librarian, Mr Giles (Anthony Stewart-Head) who has secretly been sent to Sunnydale by the Watcher's Council in England to be the Watcher of a new Slayer. To Buffy, he's annoying - ""a textbook with arms."" He knows Buffy is the Slayer, yet she won't accept this. ""Yeah, and I've both been there and done that and I'm moving on,"" she says. After Willow is snatched by a vampire, Buffy knows she must find her. Her Slayer instincts are instantly stirred and from then on, she realises being the Slayer is her duty. From then on, Buffy and the Scooby Gang (Willow/Xander/Giles) hunt the demons and vampires. Other top episodes include Witch, Teacher's Pet, The Pack, Angel, Nightmares and Out Of Mind, Out Of Sight. All the episodes have fantastic dialogue, witty one-liners and exciting storylines. This perfect combination is very hard to get right, but Buffy the Vampire Slayer manages to get it spot-on.

The seasons' main story arc focuses on the vampire legend, as does the second season. Yet Seasons 3, 4, 5 and 6 didn't really focus on Big Bad's of the non-vampire variety. The Master (Mark Metcalf) is a very powerful vampire that is stuck in between Hell and Earth who is desperate to get free and rule over the world. He makes many attempts to get free in episodes such as The Harvest, Never Kill A Boy On The First Date among others. In the season opener, we meet Angel (David Boreanaz). For the first seven episodes he is know by the Scooby Gang as Mysterious Guy. He's never around through the day, has pale skin and seems to know a lot about vampires - some would say a little to much. In the episode Angel, Buffy finds out he's a vampire. The one guy she's had a crush on is a vampire. Angel is a vampire with a soul and hasn't killed a human for years since his soul was restored. Amazingly, the two start to see each other in Season 2 but for Season 1 they mainly work together with Willow, Xander and Giles. In the episode I, Robot...You Jane, we are introduced to Jenny Calendar. She is an I.T. teacher at Sunnydale High School and features in the season finale Prophecy Girl. In the fianle, the Master is freed from his prison between Hell and Earth. Buffy and the Scoobies spend the most of the season looking for where the Hellmouth is - they realise the Hellmouth is situated directly underneath the School Libary. So Buffy, Willow, Xander, Giles, Angel, Cordelia and Ms Calendar work together in a spectacular display of teamwork and determination to save the day...

OVERALL GRADE: 10/10

All in all, Season 1 of Buffy the Vampire Slayer is essential for every fan. This TV show is legendary and these 12 episodes are absolute gems for everyone to treasure. The episodes are brilliant and you can watch them over and over again. A must buy - get your copy now from Amazon!",1033257600,5,4915,4.607305936073059

1379256,5,B00004YWJE,"Welcome to Sunnydale! Wait... You don't know where You are? Have You lost Your way? Let me help You and guide You through safely. Shall we begin then?
Sunnydale is a small town in California. It is best known for its high death rate, especially among teenagers. And now it became Slayer's residence. Who is the Slayer You might ask? The legend  tells us: ""Into each generation a Slayer is born. One girl in all the world, a Chosen One. One born with the strength and skill to fight the vampires, to stop the spread of their evil and the swell of their numbers.""
Here we have 16 years old girl who must fulfill her destiny. That's where the conflict arises and it is shown this season - her inside struggle between her destiny and desire to have a normal life.
Fortunately, she is not alone in her battle. Every Slayer has a Watcher. Watcher trains and looks out for each Slayer, guide her through her battles, but she is the Warrior and Watcher isn't. This particular Slayer, Buffy, however, will have more help. She made some friends who will help her to get through in one piece. Well, at least they tried. They are so called `Scoobies' or `Slayer-a-rettes'. Let's keep going, shall we?
Don't let the title fool You. This season and whole series deal with issues like friendship, loyalty, hate, love, fear, betrayal, trust, losses, deaths and actually growing up, maturing in this cruel world better than most dramas. One episode it's comedy, clever and witty, next episode it's drama filled with pain and grief. Some episodes are better, some weaker, but overall this season is strong. Not the best of all the seasons, but it serves its role well as an introduction to these series and universe.
Pros. This series is very clever written. Characters' quotes are the strong point of these show. Great acting and great actors, ones who play major characters and supporting cast had the job done. Story lines are very thoroughly thoughtful, because author (Joss Whedon) plans major changes for two seasons ahead and has time to develop plots and twists. He always leaves some leads to pick the m later. Characters grow with us, they develop each episode with every move made or phrase spoken. There is nothing unimportant in these series. Music and sounds are very well done and help to set up the atmosphere.
Cons. There aren't many for me, I am the fan, remember? This season's too short - only 12 episodes compared to 22 episodes in other seasons. There are very few locations which is due to lack of financial involvement early in the show. The quality of picture isn't great but it is explained by Joss in his audio commentary for episodes `Welcome to the Hellmouth' and `The Harvest'. This leads us to special features of DVD.
Special features include:
- Full-length audio commentary by creator Joss Weadon on first two episodes, which is very informative and entertaining. You should check it out.
- Interviews with Whedon and David Boreanaz (`Angel').
- Trailers.
- Photo galleries and cast biographies.
- Original pilot script for first two episodes.
- Subtitles.
Word of advise. If You're new to this show, don't check special features until You've finished watching all 12 episodes, `cause You might spoil some twists of first season plot.
I have a confession to make. When I watched first two episodes back in 1997, I was unimpressed. I saw the original movie and liked it. I didn't like Sarah's portrayal of Buffy. I was young, very young back then so bear with me. When our TV showed the first season in 2000, I decided to give it another shot. As season progresses, I become more and more addicted to it. Give this series a chance and it'll swallow You, make You an addict (in a good way, actually) and You will cry for more. There is more, since Fox did released season two also. 22 more episodes of Buffy. Isn't it just great?
I don't know about You, but I'll just go to my room, put first disk of Buffy's season one into DVD player and watch it one more time. Just in case, just to refresh memories. See You in Sunnydale! By the way, saving the world on schedule must be tough job...",1032307200,,4100,4.631868131868132
1379257,5,B00004YWJE,"Okay first things first, I'm a *huge* Buffy fan, so of course I'm biased.  Second, I feel in order to give an accurate review, i have to separate the elements of the DVD package from the elements of the show itself.
The show:
I'm one of those people who immediately scoffed at the idea of this show.  Until I watched it.  It works on so many levels and is iabout so much more than vampires and demons.  It's completely and thoroughly real.  Whatever your beliefs on the supernatural, if you survived high school you can relate to this show.  Joss Whedon has created characters that are so amazingly true, that you can't help but see yourself on the screen.  The evils that Buffy fights on a weekly basis are metaphors for everyone's inner demons.  I won't go too far, because this package only contains season 1, but if the show had ended there it would still be more than worthwhile.
I was reluctant at first to purchase this set because my first thought was that season 1 is my least favorite season- it doesn't contain all my favorite story arcs, has a lot lighter tone than later seasons, and is missing some favorite characters.  But then I sat down and watched them again.  ...
The show is a must watch from beginning to end, get the DVD package & get season 2 & when they come out, get them all.
The DVD package:
There's some really great stuff.  Joss Whedon's commentary on Welcome to the Hellmouth alone is worth the price of admission.  The interviews with Joss are pretty insightful, although it's obviously the same interview spliced throughout the set.  ...
However, I must agree that they missed the boat on the things they *could* have included.  I for one could listen to Joss Whedon commentary on every single episode.  And how about interviews with other cast members, including, oh I don't know, SARAH MICHELLE GELLAR!!!!
So altogether, the DVD package is still a must have. Yes, there are things I wish were different, but it's still awful good & it's not like there are other Buffy first season packages out there to choose from.",1031702400,,2050,4.578082191780822
1379258,5,B00004YWJE,"When I first saw the movie I thought that it was ok. But it wasn't what I'd call one of the greatest films in our history. So when the series came on I didn't really think much about it, and thought it was going to crash within the first few episodes, but it didn't.
After a while I sort of got into the habit of watching it on FX whenever I got home. It was then that I realized how much I really liked this show. And I got to know the characters alot better. Giles and his sort of quiet humor who would rather read a good book than watch the ""idiotbox"". Then theres Xander who has a big sense of humor but can get annoying sometimes. And Willow who is really the shy girl next door, who doesn't really know how to show her feelings until she meets Buffy. Angel who is the desperate soul happens to be a vampire and he falls in love with buffy, The classic Romeo and Juliet. Finally theres Buffy herself who is going through alot in her life, trying to be a regular teenager who has superhuman strength and has to save the world now and then.
I recommend this series for anyone who loves a drama with action and comedy in it.",1030579200,,1126,4.099547511312217

I do think that Joss Whedon is a genius in creating the series. The DVD would be a great source for the followers of the TV show, but I also think that the first timers would also like this item. Special features are not excellent but it is sufficient for the first boxed set.",1030060800,,417,4.097560975609756

1379262,5,B00004YWJE,"Here's the first season of the highly successful ""Buffy the Vampire Slayer"" television series.  This is a must have for any fan of the series or serious collector of vampire media.  The first season was excellent, setting the tone for all the wonderful shows that were in store thereafter.  The first season had fewer episodes than subsequent ones but this collection is reasonably priced and well worth the money.  Buffy in the television series is a capable albeit average teenage girl who finds herself not only dealing with the growing pains of being 16 years old but trying to ""have a life"" while being the slayer.  Through her growing pains both as a teenager and a slayer many of the issues that plague real teens in the modern world are addressed . . . and Buffy always comes out a winner.  Although there is a certain amount of violence this series is a real feel good show showing a teenage girl and her friends overcoming the complexities of becoming young adults.  I would highly recommend the Buffy series to ANYBODY.",1026691200,2,1030,4.688888888888889
1379263,5,B00004YWJE,"Watching the original 12 episodes of Buffy is a lot like flipping through your old high-school yearbook: plenty of bittersweet memories and lots of bad hairstyles. Remember the gawky, softer-side-of-Sears Willow (pre-lesbian and pre-wicca)? Scruffy, lovable Xander when he was allowed a higher percentage of wisecracks. Cordy, the Queen C, the Apex, in all her glorious cheerleader bitchiness. Giles, while he was still called ""Mr. Giles."" Ah, the library, I miss the library, the first bat cave. And, of course, a younger, innocent Slayer, before her two subsequent deaths and four more seasons of WB angst.
Of course, like high school, the place is a little smaller and dingier than you remembered it, the special effects, a little less special.
But the storylines, themes and dialog still smack with cleverness and depth as mandated by series creator/genius Joss Whedon, and hold up much better than any dusty yearbook. In fact, a few of the First Dozen remain absolute classics to Buffy minions, including ""Angel"" (of course) and ""Prophecy Girl."" I personally think ""Nightmares"" boasts one of the show's most inventive plot devices, turning characters' worst fears against them. It was a time when the show was a little more metaphor, a little less sci-fi.
While all first seasons are supposed to set the show's stage, the first Buffy eps really get the character evolution and story arches on their underworldy way: the formation of the Scooby Gang (originally dubbed ""The Slayerettes""); Buffy battling both demons and her destiny as the Chosen One; the Master as the first big bad guy; and the show's underlying mission statement, nothing is ever as it seems. From the opening scene of the pilot, this show was designed to always keep you on your toes.
One bonus of the DVD set is Joss's full-length commentary track on ""Welcome to the Hellmouth."" An interesting boon for any Watcher wanna-be, done with a style that makes you feel like you are participating in an intellectual discussion on television science rather than a rabid fan/pop-culture geek with way too much time on your hands. An important distinction in my book.
Untimately, Buffy's first season is the perfect way to reminisce, all the while reminding us that we've already graduated.",1026691200,3,2255,5.080862533692723
1379264,5,B00004YWJE,"I've always been interested in Buffy, I even rented the movie a couple times when I was young. Last year, I rented the VHS video of ""Welcome to the Hellmouth/The Harvest"", the series openers. I LOVED it, I fell in love with Buffy then and there, with just TWO episodes!!! This came out, I waited for a while, and I have no idea why, but I finally got this in May, so I am a fairly new Buffy fan, but I LOVE Buffy, and the 2nd season DVD is also great!!! This set includes three discs, each with four classic episodes on it, giving you 12 episodes to relive and relive again. They will always be good, everytime you watch them, you'll never get tired of them. The outstanding episodes are the series openers ""Welcome to the Hellmouth"" and ""The Harvest"", ""Never Kill A Boy On the First Date"" where Buffy deals with trying to be a slayer and have a normal life at the same time, ""Angel"" where the Buffy and Angel lovestory pretty much begins, and the season finale ""Prophecy Girl"" in which Buffy gives up her life to save the world...even though she didn't have to. This show has great theatrical value, and it's a TV show which says alot right there. It not only includes action, it includes drama and romance and lots of comedy, and with all these elements combined...how could you not fall in love with ""Buffy the Vampire Slayer""?",1026518400,,1330,4.4105691056910565

Now, however, I am able to watch the episodes from the beginning, in the linear order that they were designed to be viewed.  Maybe there aren't as many extras in this set as in some other DVDs, but I didn't buy it for the extras.  I bought it for the well-written episodes that it contains.  There was only one complaint that I have regarding this set - the episode titles aren't printed on the disks, which makes it harder to find a particular episode.  Fortunately, they corrected this mistake in the season 2 set.  All in all, however, this is a terrific addition to my DVD collection.",1026259200,,797,4.570422535211268

1379270,4,B00004YWJE,"July 3, 2002
Buffy came out of nowhere in the very late nineties,
an unheralded mid-season program starring unknowns,
the adaptation of a weak but loopy film project reborn
on a marginal network.  Despite mediocre ratings and a
lack of industry recognition, the show not only managed
to survive to maturity, it has even wormed its way
into the public consciousness.
The secret to its network survival is little more than
demographic appeal, clearly, but the secret to its cult
status and vaunted critical reputation is the powerhouse
effect of its first three seasons.
In its original incarnation (packaged here), Buffy is
one of the richest dramatic concoctions television has
yet produced.  It masquerades as an ironic kiddie horror
show but presents a better brand of melodrama than most
prime time doctor and lawyer shows.  Self-referencing wit
and ironic detachment are sprinkled literally throughout
the proceedings, but from the very first episode it's
clear that the producers, writers and actors take these
characters very seriously.
This is one of a very short list of TV show DVD
collections that I'd advise anyone to buy.  It is moving,
playful, review-worthy television at its best.  Season
Two is also available.",1025654400,,1226,5.171717171717172

1379272,5,B00004YWJE,"For the longest time, I thought people that talked about ""Buffy the Vampire Slayer"" (and ""Angel,"" its spinoff) were ridiculous. This, of course, was before I'd ever seen even a small part of an episode. Once I started, I couldn't stop. The characters really are flushed out to be interesting individuals, and the show explores many issues that all teenagers have to deal with in high school. (Believe me, I know -- I only graduated 2 years ago!) My boyfriend purchased the first season of ""Buffy,"" and we flew through it in less than two weeks. Some of the best episodes were:
""Witch"" - ""In an effort to inject somce normalcy into her life, Buffy tries out for the cheerleading squad -- Only to discover the competetion wants her dead."" (Summary taken from DVD booklet)
~~~ An amusing, and still yet poignant look at competetion between school girls.
""Teacher's Pet"" - ""Xander falls for a beautiful substitute teacher who is actually a She-Mantis intent on mating with, then decapitating, virginal boys."" (Summary taken from DVD booklet)

1379273,5,B00004YWJE,"How could I have been so blind? As if having been poked in the eyes repeatedly with the finger of ignorance, I was foolish enough to have initially dismissed Buffy with the haughty tones of a young man dismissive of the entire 'teen tv' genre. My friends, threatening me with outmoded farming implements, eventually managed to force me to watch an episode. It involved the inhabitants of the town of Sunnydale losing their voices whilst sinister floating demons prowled the night looking for... well I think you can guess. I was hooked. I had to see where it started before I went any further.
Buffy the Vampire slayer is that rare breed, an intelligent and witty horror adventure. First of all special mention must be given to the acting. Out of the regular cast it is difficult to see anyone as an actor... you can only see perfectly rounded characters. It really is a marvel. A host of young peformers acting in a completely unselfish way. There is no mugging, no shameless hogging of limelight. Nicholous Brendon does a superb job as the class clown, Xander. An unpopular boy who hides his vunerability under a facade of wisecracks and witticisms. Brendon appears to have a natural gift of timing, and if he is ever given a duff line he manages to make it look as if the character is naturally at fault for saying such a stupid thing, instead of exposing a rare inadequacy in the script writing. Alysson Hannigan perfectly portrays the 'class geek'. A rather sweet, innocent and totally unconfident girl of 'a shyness that is criminally... um... unvulgar'. (One for you Smiths fans there.) Hannigan and Brendon work together well, they really do seem like close friends. Protective of each other, needing each other for support and working together to not only defeat monsters but deflate any pofaced morbidities that could arise in the script. Anthony-Giles-Stewart-Giles-Head-Anthony works admirably at a character that has to indulge in a lot of exposistion for the benefit of the viewer. It is good to see that the rest of the cast and the script offer him plenty of opportunities to react in bewildement, annoyance and lovable 'Englishness' to the often exasperating youngsters. He also gets his fair share of action, fun and drama. Many TV shows neglect such characters, seeing them as little more than to speedily set up and advance plots. It's good that Joss Whedon values all of his characters.
And Sarah Gellar herself? In pathos she shows her isolation well. The strong feeling of responsibility towards her friends and her moral courage are played well by her. Although Gellar sometimes quips too flipantly... I think that she should deliver some of her vampire trouncing lines a little more edgily lest they end up looking like comedy monsters... she is very good at delivering the lines intended to satirise the American High school. Her scenes with her mother are played expertly to maximum effect. Notice that Buffy's mother actually has little screen time, but thanks to a resonant script and natural acting, it feels as if she plays a very large role in Buffy's life.
The TV show would be a lot poorer if it wasn't for the ease of which it switched emotions. Most inferior TV shows have one note. X-Files was guilty of this, opting for a continuous stream of angst after the first two series. Buffy switches from comedy to drama to horror with almost implausible ease. This keeps it difficult in guessing in what precise direction the show is going in. This unpredictability can only be a good thing. The writing is, by and large, very sharp as well. Although some of the vampires are fairly dull, and Angel does a little too much brooding, there are some cracking lines for the villains. The slap-headed Master getting his fair share of taunting and cute remarks. Cordelia provides expert comic relief and acts as the kind of teenager you'd think twice about saving from evil beasties. She also provides a vital link for the Buffy squad with the rest of the kids.
Episode quality? There are two duffers. The preying mantis teacher episode is let down by weak effects and a tale far too slight. It ultimately says nothing and is only saved by a slightly amusing script and good acting, especially from Brendon. 'The Puppet Show' seems far too unsure as to what direction it wants to take. It should be entirely silly but aims for pathos, which doesn't really work since the character we're meant to feel sorry for looks like a sinister cross between Howdy Doody and Captain Scarlett. Four of the episodes are cracking however. The first two introduce the concept and characters and provide a concentrated form of the soul of the show. 'Angel' reveals many sides of Buffy's character and places her in a situation true of many teen romances, despite the supernatural elements. The last episode is something of a rollercoaster. It has very strong drama and a good theme on the nature of responisbility, Giles especially getting a good part in realising his rather callous acceptance of Buffy as the world's saviour, sending her out while he remains in relative safety and his attempts to correct this. The only let down is a slightly anti-climatic and rather unimaginative end fight with The Master.
Overall then? Even the worst two episodes are entertaining compared to the usual quality of television. At its best Buffy provides a fun home for satire, drama, comedy and horror. The obvious love and care put into the show by all concerned is what keeps it fresh and earnest. Oh, and at one point Xander punches a scary clown. I cheered. Please don't overlook this gem, intellectual indie fellow, it will surprise you.
One last nightmarish thought. What if, due to the mystical properties of the Hellmouth, it was Uri Gellar and not Sarah Gellar who played Buffy? Brrr.",1025049600,4,5790,4.825955734406438

I read critics' praises of the show and about its cult following but at the time I thought, ""Why are they ranting and raving about 'Buffy the Vampire Slayer'?"" When I finally watched it, I was quite impressed with how witty, sly and suspenseful it was all at the same time without contradicting itself. The characters are quite aware of the absurdity of some of the situations they get into and play it off with a somewhat campy nature. It is completely different than Buffy the movie and that movie is the furthest thing from your mind while viewing the show.
This dvd and the one for the second season is perfect for the Buffy fan from the early days, late bloomers like myself as well as those skeptics who have yet to be converted -- and hooked!",1024963200,,813,4.426666666666667
1379276,4,B00004YWJE,"For anyone who's come in late to the Buffy phenomenon, this DVD set is a great bargain. These episodes pick up from the movie (and, frankly, make it unnecessary for anyone other than completists), and set up the Buffy show nicely.
Who was Xander's and Willow's friend before Buffy arrived? Was Cordelia REALLY that mean before she went soft on Xander? Who were Willow and Xander infatuated with? And what was the deal with Angel?
The first season sets up the rules for the Slayer (although some, like her ability to sense vampires, have gone by the wayside), the school years (including two very different principals, with the later being played by the actor famous for fan-favorite Quark on ""Star Trek: Deep Space Nine""), Buffy having to maintain a secret identity, and the non-story arc episodes, including a very chilling episode, ""The Pack,"" in which Xander falls in with a very, very wrong crowd.
This is only a half-season, as Buffy was originally a mid-season replacement. That's OK, as the overall story arc, about the Master being trapped beneath Sunnydale and attempting to get free and conquer the world, isn't the best the show had to offer (certainly not as good as season three's double threat of Faith and the Mayor). The Master as a character is a little campy and not quite as scary as Joss Whedon seemed to have wanted him to be, and the prosthetic teeth the actor wears makes him sound like an angry mole rather than the main vampire in the Buffy series. (For fun, try and trace all the prominent vampires' lineage in the show -- you'll see they all end up at the Master eventually.)
Some justifiably famous episodes are present in this DVD, including the season ender ""Prophecy Girl,"" which includes some of Sarah Michelle Gellar's best acting in the series, and the growth of the character from the somewhat unsure of herself and overwhelmed novice slayer into the more confident pro she would become. And, of course, the events of this episode also set up a major surprise in season two ...
Unfortunately, the DVD collection isn't as good as the episodes included. The added features are mostly the interviews made when half of these episodes were released on tape a few years ago, along with rather unimpressive publicity photos and a script. Further, the first episode, ""Welcome to the Hellmouth,"" is not as the show was originally aired, which included a voice-over and some graphics telling the history of the Slayers. For fans who have read the excellent ""Watcher's Guide"" companions to this series, this absence will be a little confusing, and it's baffling in any case. If Joss thought this material was some that he wished he hadn't put in the original episode, it would have been appropriate to put it on the DVD as an ""original opening credits"" feature. The final DVD also has a lengthy Universal Studios ad tacked onto the beginning, which is absolutely maddening. I wouldn't have minded if the DVDs had included ads for the DVD of the movie, or of future upcoming Buffy DVDs, but why do I care about this other junk?
In any case, this DVD set is a steal for Buffy fans, and is essential viewing for fans of one of the best television shows of all time. Buy it now!",1024790400,8,3198,4.7023172905525845
1379277,5,B00004YWJE,"This boxed set and its follow-up (the six-disc Second Season set) are must-owns if you're even remotely interested in film or television.
Buffy the Vampire Slayer simply has some of the best writing going.  Joss Whedon made a brilliant move by adapting the charming but forgettable 1992 feature into the television medium.  The longer character-development arcs and sense of intimacy in television are just perfect for fleshing out what at first may seem a whimsical idea, that of a high-school cheerleader who defies horror-movie convention and strikes back at the monsters and madmen.
Within the first episode of the first season, the series finds its heart (along with your funny bone) and never loses it.  Of course, much credit has to be given to the stellar cast:  As Buffy, Sarah Michelle Gellar's is nothing short of a virtuoso performance, her facility with both drama and comedy lighting up every scene; Nicolas Brendon is delightful as charming loser Xander, often surprising you with moments of pathos underneath a clown veneer.  Alyson Hanigan (Willow)'s comic timing is razor-sharp, and Anthony Stewart Head deftly juggles stuck-up conservatism and a disarming sense of self-deprecating humour as Buffy's ""Watcher"" and guardian, Giles.  Even the small roles are highly memorable, my favourite being the engrossing role-switching dual performance of Robin Riker and Elizabeth Anne Allen in the episode ""Witch"".
The writing is some of the sharpest I've seen in TV, witty and authentic to its teenage characters, free of the I'm-too-hip attitude that so many teen movies are plagued by.  And Whedon had made sure that amidst all the monster slaying and wisecracks, emotional resonance is never sacrificed.  Each one of these characters is lovingly constructed, feeling like old friends after a while.
The second season is where the series really soars into the stratosphere.  However, the first season contained in this boxed set is lighter in tone and therefore, arguably, more purely enjoyable.  A definite candidate for the top spot in my DVD collection.",1024704000,2,2068,5.258358662613982

Welcome to the Hellmouth/The Harvest(A-), A solid two part pilot that introduces all of the characters and sets up the shows mythology. From the beginning you can see that a great show is about to explode.
The Witch(C+), The first episode to not deal with vampires. It has some very funny moments, especially when Buffy gets too perky, but this is just an average episode. It does introduce Amy who will become very important later in the series.
Teacher's Pet(C-),This was the first episode to focus on Xander and its not great. It had its moments. Love the scene where Cordelia is talking to the councelor. But overall the effects are cheesy and this becomes the weakest episode from season 1.
Never Kill a Boy on the First Date(A-), Buffy has to stop the annointed one from arising but is to distracted by Owen to care. A solid episode that brings the master back in the story and helps move foward the season's arc. Sarah Michelle Gellar does a great job in this episode trying to balance a normal life with a slayer life.
The Pack(A-), Xander starts hanging out with some mean kids and the school principal gets eaten. A well done episode. The look on WIllow's face when Xander insults her is heartbreaking and the scene where Xander pins Buffy down is great. Also Buffy's little comment about being Scully'ed' is great.
Angel(A), Buffy learns Angel's dark secret. An awesome episode with many classic moments. When Buffy finds out about Angel the look on her face is priceless. I also love Darla and I thought she was great in this episode. Too bad she had to die.
I Robot, You Jane(B-), Simliar to teacher's pet in that Willow finds love but unfortunatly things don't turn out right. A mixed bag type of episode. The highlights include the introduction of computer teacher Jenny Calendar and the sexual tension that she and Giles obviously have.
The Puppet show(B+), Your typical evil puppet epiosde with a twist. There are some creeepy moments especially when Sid is in Buffy's bedroom, but the scene at the end where Buffy, WIllow and Xander preform at the talent show is hilarious.
Nightmares(A), I really liked this episode. Seeing everyone's nightmares come true was very fun to watch. It was also a treat getting to see Buffy look like a vampire. The best episode so far.
Out my sight, Out of My Mind(B), Buffy has to fight a girl who is invisable. An alright episode. It's great to see Cordelia start to become part of the scooby gang and her speech about being popular was great.
Prophecy Girl(A+), Buffy has to face the Master and die. One of the best Buffy episodes ever, from Buffy's speech about being to young to die, to Xander and Angel's team up, to seeing Cordeila drive through the school everything was perfect.
Overall this set is very good and Buffy fans should enjoy it. Others will get to see a great show unfold before their eyes. The best is yet to come though because seasons 2-4 rock.",1024704000,,3377,4.54679802955665
1379280,5,B00004YWJE,"Buffy is a 17 yr old girl who has moved to Sunnydale after accidentily burning down her school gym in Los Angeles while fighting vampires.  Sunnydale should be a breath of fresh air for her, a place where she can be normal.  But Sunny Dale is anything but normal.  As the first episode is aptly named ""Welcome to the Hellmouth"" Not only does Sunnydale have the highest mortality rate, but is also the center of mystical forces.  And Buffy must accept her duty as the Vampire slayer, one girl in all the world who is chosen to fight the demons and the vampires.  The show was a midseason replacement, so there wasn't much time for the archnemesis, the Master to evolve.  He is a 600 yr old vamp who plans to open the hellmouth.  Buffy and her friends, Willow and Xander are great, along with her watcher Giles, and the snobby Cordelia.  Perhaps even a love interest for Buffy, Angel a mysterious young man who helps her in the face of danger.
 The only bothersome thing about this DVD was that after you played an episode, you had to take the disc out to get to the main menu.  Atleast I haven't found a way.
From ""Welcome to the Hellmouth"" to ""Angel"" and ""Prophecy Girl"" you need this DVD!!!!",1024617600,,1192,4.401826484018265
1379281,5,B00004YWJE,"Although ""Buffy the Vampire Slayer"" started as a mid-season replacement for whatever, the show was so well made that it was an instant hit.  Its make-up department was nominated for an Emmy in the first season.  This show is the product of a great effort from everyone involved...",1024531200,,280,4.8125
1379282,4,B00004YWJE,"Don't let the title fool you. Buffy the Vampire Slayer is a smart, funny and sometimes very scary series.
  I think the series improved in later seasons (particularly the 2nd and 3rd, although it still produces great episodes even in the 6th season). But there's still a lot of good stuff at the beginning. The characters are so fresh and new. Xander loves Buffy. Willow loves Xander. Less melancholy in the Buffy/Angel relationship. Were the characters ever this young?
  It's a bit strange for me because I jumped on the Buffy bandwagon in the summer between the 2nd and 3rd seasons. So, for me, first season Buffy is a bit like looking at high school (or even baby) photos of friends I met in university.
  My favourite episode in this season is the finale, ""Prophecy Girl"" where Buffy faces the propechy of her impeding death. As she pleads to her mentor, ""Giles, I'm sixteen. I don't want to die."" Not the brainless commentary that critics who have never actually watched the show maintain. (Most critics who have watched the series given high praise.)
  The extras -- well, a bit light. I did enjoy Joss Whedon's commentary on the first two episodes. The ""interviews"" are recycled from the earlier video tape release (which only featured a selected 6 episodes, as opposed to the full 12 on DVD).
  And the video quality isn't the best. Apparently poor film stock was used in the first two years. (I think the transfer on the 2nd season DVD is worse, which is why I gave it three stars even though the writing and acting quality deserve 5 stars. Here, the writing and video quality both come out to a 4.)

1379283,4,B00004YWJE,"Yes, I always considered myself one of the 2nd type of people: I always enjoyed watching an episode whenever it came on, but I never followed the series consistently, so after the first few seasons I lost touch with all the new developments / new members of the gang, and the series wasn't as interesting to me as it first was.
But this is Buffy as fresh and as she was originally meant to be: both a vampire slayer, and a struglling high school student. We see her and her gang face vampires and all sorts of other unpleasant creatures and demons (and most of the episodes deal with non - vampire creatures...). But we also get to see other aspects of teenage life: Buffy's struggles with being unpopular and being teased by thepopular crowd, especially Cordelia, after being popular herself in her old school. Or the romantic triange she's in with Xander and Willow. Or better make it a square if we throw Angel into the equasion...
The series also manages to combine comedy, drama and scares / creeps very well...
Now for the point I really don't like about this set: the extras. There are a few, and they're interesting (Joss Wheadon's commentary, a few explanations by him on a few episodes), but there are so few of them! The commentary, for instance, is only for the first 2 episodes, but a commentary on the last episode would have been great too. Another idea would be to add a little 'in depth' explanation of the vampire mythology behind the series - even if it's gathering the bits and pieces Giles drops in the episodes...",1024099200,,1535,4.565217391304348

1379287,5,B00004YWJE,"I only have 2 complaints about these DVDs. First, and I think this was addressed by others, the ""Previously on Buffy"" scenes were deleted, which is a little jarring. The music was apparently all scored together, so when you start an episode it feels like you start 2 or 3 bars into a piece of music.
Other than that, my only complaint is that I want more commentaries!! The two commentaries and several featurettes by Joss Whedon are superb. He really brings exactly what I want to a commentary track -- info on the actors, and decisions that were made during the episode, and why. He explains his premise for a lot of decisions, and is able to admit when he could have done better. It is especially interesting on this first season DVD, having already seen most of the other seasons on broadcast TV, because I already know how many of the characters and specail effects have evolved.
As for the really good parts: The actual media is a very good quality. Nice sound, nice crisp images.
Buffy the Vampire Slayer is an excellent show, in that Joss Whedon and the writers are able to bring up a lot of issues relevant to ""growing up"" with out being preachy. In a lot of ways, Buffy is about 2 things: breaking stereotypes and peoples expectations; but also growing up in a very *normal* way, despite being or dealing with the supernatural and supernormal.
Overall, I highly recommend this box set. The show itself is great, and any one who has ever enjoyed Buffy on TV will love to have the whole season in one place.",1023667200,,1515,4.512727272727273
1379288,5,B00004YWJE,"Since it's debut six seasons ago, Buffy the Vampire Slayer has been one of the most original and inventive shows on television.  Many critics believe that Buffy is one of the best shows currently airing, if not THE best.  The show cleverly uses the supernatural and dark forces as metaphors for everyday teen struggles, and the process of growing up into adulthood.  The Complete first season on DVD is the best way to start from the beginning to see how your favorite characters have grown over the years, if you haven't done so already.
FOX has been releasing the Buffy series on DVD for the past several years over in the UK, while the US fans had to wait impatiently for their chance to own them. And now, Fox has finally released season one here in the US while the show has just ended its sixth season on UPN.  For all Buffy fans, this is the best way to own your favorite show.  Not only do you get extra material, DVD provides crystal clear digital picture, and whopping audio.
For those of you who aren't familiar with this series, this is the perfect chance for you to start.  Buffy the Vampire Slayer was picked up as a midseason replacement on The WB in 1996, therefore, the first season was only composed of 12 episodes, where the seasons following each contained 22.  The characters are unique and funny, and brilliantly acted.  Buffy Summers played by Sarah Michelle Gellar (""Scooby Doo"", ""Cruel Intentions""), is the chosen one.  She must protect and defend the world against evil demons and vampires, and at the same time, she must balance that with her personal life.  Willow Rosenberg is the quirky computer nerd played by Alyson Hannigan (the ""American Pie"" series), who quickly becomes one of Buffy's best friends in the first episode.  Xander Hariss, who has known Willow for years, is played by Nicholas Brendon.  Cordelia Chase is the stereotypical popular girl that every school has.  She portrays herself as someone who is higher and above everyone else, but towards the end of the season, it also becomes clear that she also has problems and that her life isn't perfect.  Giles, played by Anthony Stewart Head,  is Buffy's watcher and must guide her throughout her challenges.  He quickly becomes a father figure to her.  And lastly, the mysterious, intriguing man known as Angel is played by David Boreanaz.  In the beginning of the season, he seems to be a goodguy, but in the episode entitled 'Angel', Buffy finds out that he's actually a vampire, but seemingly a 'good' vampire.  It is not until the next season until we learn Angel's complete past.  Buffy and Angel somewhat seem to have a 'thing' for each other, even though they both know that it can never be.  The show also contains some of the most wittiest dialogue seen on television.
This show has something for everyone's tastes.  One of the most unique things about this series is that everyone has a character or two on the show that they can personally relate too.  This DVD collection is one of the best.  The collection is lacking much extra material, but to have the series first sesaon on DVD is enough alone.  Any true Buffy fan needs to own this.  And if you're interested in becoming a fan of the show, start here and work your way up.",1023667200,,3235,4.651408450704225
1379289,4,B00004YWJE,"This is a great box set to own. The beginning episodes of this series bring the characters to life. Since it had been a while since I saw the first episodes I enjoyed watching them very much.
The only thing that bothered me was the menu system. You choose the episode you want to watch, and from there you can choose the chapter you want to see. Once the episode has finished, it goes back to that episodes menu instead of the main menu. It didn't just play through the episodes, starting another one when the first finished.
Other then that, this is a very nice collection and I would recommend it to anyone.",1023580800,,609,4.350877192982456
1379290,4,B00004YWJE,"Buffy is one of the best series on television today.  It incorporates the normalicy of everyday life where everything is not black and white, The creator Joss has put together a very good series.  It is the classic good vs. evil  but with exceptional writing and acting.  The only bad thing about the cd collection is that you are not able to play all the episodes on the cd at one time. You can only watch one episode then you have to select another episode on disc.",1023494400,,467,4.333333333333333
1379291,5,B00004YWJE,"The story of Buffy is basically teenage girl coming of age and having to deal with her divorced parents, a new high school, making friends and oh yeah vampires. In all the shows you have that sci-fi element but if you look closer you see there is an underlining story that you need to pay attention to. In one of the shows you see the importance of a good mother daughter relationship and long before high school violence became broadcast news Buffy was trying to show us how important it is to not treat people like they are invisible. Buffy is a great show that just can't be defined. One minute you fear for Buffy's life and the next you are laughing. If you haven't gotten into Buffy yet then there is nothing better than starting at the beginning! I'm sure that the quality of the show will make you a die hard Buffy fan.",1023408000,,826,4.335483870967742
1379292,5,B00004YWJE,"There's a great moment toward the end of the premiere episode of Buffy. Buffy encounters the villain of the piece after two hours of struggle, and I, as an audience member, was expecting some sort of epic clash between good and evil. Rather than that Buffy chooses to remind the vampire villain of his inability to venture into the sunlight, lest he be killed. ""You forgot about one thing,"" she says to the vampire. ""Sunrise..."" She then throws a weapon at a dark, painted window and breaks it, allowing light to spill through into the vampire's face. The vampire screams in agony for a few seconds before realizing it is just an outdoor lamp making all the light, and that the sun has not yet risen. Continuing her previous sentence about the sunrise, Buffy says, ""...is in about nine hours, moron."" She then puts a stake thorugh the villain's heart and all is, at least for the moment, well.
It is this willingness to play with expectations that keeps Buffy as fresh and funny as it is. The trivialization of evil through humor also gives the show its own identity amongst a great many other television shows, movies, books, and plays that use allegorical stories to make their sweeping points.
More than just its uniqueness and storytelling flare, however, make Buffy as great a show as it is. It is also about people-- real people, that live down your street, or go to your school. It's about everybody, and it is very easy to identify with different elements of each of the characters. But, then again, none of the characters are static. They change and grow, shedding old ways and developing new ones. You may identify with a character one weeks and then become uncomfortable with their choices and ideas the next week. The characters are peeled like onions, and none can be properly defined without the aid of each and every episode that they have ever appeared in. Sitcom characters are uniformly sarcastic, but Buffy characters are multidimensional entities. More even than the fun and actions of the episodes, this element of the show sticks with me as a viewer. I care about Willow, and Xander, and Buffy, and Giles, and Tara (God rest her soul), and Anya, and Dawn, and Spike, and Angel. Their actions and attitudes make a difference to me, and that is a frightening thing to discover as I remind myself that those people, real as they may seem, are fictional. In its many famous ways Buffy is a fictional show, but so far as the depths of the personalities go, it is more real than any examples of the new wave a reality television.
The first season is not the best season of the show, but neither is it the worst, and compared to any other show on televsion, this year of Buffy will blow your mind. Make the investment and enjoy a bright future where even theatrical movies look pretty stupid next to the glory of Buffy.",1023408000,2,2834,4.625
1379293,4,B00004YWJE,"The first season brings Buffy to Sunnydale where we she meets Willow, Xander and her new Watcher, Giles. She also meets Angel but doesn't realize he's a vampire at first. All this happens in the 2 hour pilot which is very entertaining by the way. I love the whole big battle at the bronze at the end.
  Well anyway this season is good start, haven't seen it until recently on the FX channel. I must say it's pretty cool. My favorite would have to be the nightmare episode where all their nightmares become a reality, now that ones really cool. Not as good as Hush in season 4 but still good. Besides that Xander has a crush on Buffy but she doesn't like him that way...poor guy, at least he has Anya now. Oh wait he left her at the Alter, lol.
  The Villian in the first season is the Master who is stuck underground and needs other vampires to do his dirty work. If Slayer dies he will be free!. Giles and Angel find out that it is said that the Slayer will battle and get killed against the Master.
  This isn't Buffy's best season but it's stiil good and is cool to look back at the characters and how far they've gone since the first season.",1023235200,,1145,4.229357798165138
1379294,5,B00004YWJE,"This series has nothing to do with the movie other than its title, main character and a lot of stuff about vampires. When approaching this show the movie is best forgotten. Originally scheduled as a filler for a cancelled show, Buffy the Vampire Slayer proved itself to be much greater than just something to fill a space. Only twelve episodes long, this season has to be direct and has to hit the mark, which it does. Enough of the limited time is spent; introducing and slightly developing characters; introducing the season's main villain and his motives; creating some interesting and bizarre ""monster of the week"" storylines. And through all this there is a sense of freshness, humour and creepiness, keeping almost everyone happy. It would be interesting to see what this season would be like with the full 22 episodes, but season one does do what it's suppose to; it keeps us watching!
The characters are funny and realistic (if not slightly stretched to keep the show to its point), the stories are original (or at least original takes on old ideas) and it is incredibly enoyable to sit back and watch the actors get to know and become their characters.
It's a stepping stone season and a must for any true fan of the show.
DVD extras (British version) include interviews with Joss Whedon, David Boreanaz, episode scripts, stills gallery, commentary by Joss Whedon on Welcome to the Hellmouth and The Harvest, plus a music video.",1023062400,,1437,4.821862348178137
1379295,5,B00004YWJE,"When this show premiered I was skeptical.  A TV show based on a movie that apparently nobody liked save the Paul Ruebens death scene?  What were the executives at the netlet WB thinking?  Were the pictures of them THAT embarrassing? I had no intention of watching this show at all, me a grown man of 27 watching a show where the main character is named Buffy, so I skipped the premiere.  It gave me the wiggins, er creeps just thinking about it!  But then I read a review in Sun-Times by Phil Rosenthal and he lauded how good the premier show was, funny, intelligent and that it didn't take itself too seriously.  I was glad to find that I would be able to watch the rerun of the premiere so I could see for myself if this show was good.  I have been hooked ever since.  This proves that television shows that don't start with Law & Order can be intelligent as well.  Buffy has always tried to be different and yet has remained true to its story.  It is emotional, intelligent, funny and probably most importantly well acted.  If you like this show or if you are just starting to watch this show you must get the first season, if for no other reason but to prove that the first time Buffy sang was not in Season 6's musical.  Only negative with the DVDs is that Series creator Joss Whedon only does the director narration thing on 2 eps.  He has said that doing them makes him uncomfortable and that is a shame, for once the narration actually held worthwhile information.  Most that I have heard are nothing more than the director just loving to hear himself talk.",1023062400,,1565,4.370242214532872
1379296,4,B00004YWJE,I am a BtVS fanatic so when I heard that the first season was going to be released on DVD I was ecstatic. All of the episodes were as awesome as I remembered and the ones that I hadn't seen yet were exciting. So why did I give it only four stars? Some scences at night were shot so badly that you can practically not even see what's going on. It was never like that in the later seasons and I don't remember having it happen in this season when it was on TV. I don't know if it was just shot this way or what. But basically that's the only problem with this DVD so I recommend that if you are a fan of the show to pick this up.,1022889600,,627,3.7938931297709924
1379297,5,B00004YWJE,"I started watching Buffy around season 4 or 5, because the movie never did it for me.  But, the writing and performances are the best you'll see on television... maybe even on film.  Joss Whedon knows his craft, and it shines in the first season of Buffy.  His commentary on the DVD gives insight into how carefully he's crafted the characters and how he truly understands his art on a deeper, truer level.  His comment that Willow was a character that everyone would identify with even more than Buffy is so true.  He taps into this by putting Willow in peril every so often, which has his intended effect of getting a huge emotional response out of his audience.  He's still using this same technique in this last season (in which Willow abuses her witchy powers--- very badly), and it's incredibly powerful and effective since we've grown up with her character and her very human vulnerabilities.
Add to that incredible performances by Sarah Michelle Gellar (Buffy) and Anthony Stewart Head (Giles), and you have a very exciting, entertaining, and emotionally rich first season.  The writing is brilliant, and even if, like me, you could predict the twists and turns in movies like ""Fight Club"" and ""Sixth Sense"", you'll still find yourself surprised and wondering in any typical Buffy episode.  The sheer unpredictability and brilliance of Buffy episodes is an absolute necessity in a show where the heroes win every time.  But what makes this show spectacular is not that Buffy conquers demons and vampires like clockwork, it's that sometimes, she and her friends fail to conquer their inner demons.  And it's these times that remind us of the ""Hellmouth"" that was our own high schools, and that sometimes our worst enemies are ourselves, our best friends, and our best intentions.
The first season introduces the characters and is more episodic than later seasons, but by the season finale, each of the characters has grown, changed, and evolved as a result of their adventures.  Even a minor character such as Cordelia who would be only a charicature in other shows is fully fleshed out and allowed to grow during the course of the season.
When you're done watching all of the episodes and all of the commentary and reading all of the bios on this DVD, you'll still be left wanting more.  Hopefully for you, the second season DVD will already be available.  For me, I've had to wait, and keep myself happy with my Buffy fix with the current season... which keeps getting better!
So, do yourself a favor, get this DVD, and see the work of a master at the peak of his craft.  And then prepare yourself for at least 5 more seasons where he just keeps getting better.  I can't wait to get the rest of the seasons on DVD.  Let's hope that you don't have to!",1022803200,4,2759,4.716666666666667

When I first saw this series back in '97 or '96 when it first came on, I was very nonimpressed.  I thought the new Buffy was a little to snotty and ful of herself.  Also, I just didn't like Sarah Micehelle Gellar's portrayal.  This seemed like another cliche' of the selfless superhero.  Years later, I have finally seen the Angel series and have come to appreciate the subtle wit that went into the writing of those stories.  So I ordered the first season of Buffy and was very pleased indeed.  Maybe I just needed to grow up.  That said, these twelves episodes are pretty original television, particularly for the theme of horror and adolescence.  My favorite episode was Out of Mind, Out of Sight; like the x-files did many times, the distinction between hero and villain was blurred (at least for 3/4)for the episode.  One of the most haunting scenes I've ever seen was when Marcy began to turn invisable in the classroom and nobody even thought to notice or care.

I definitely recommend getting the First season DVDs.,1021507200,,388,4.47887323943662
1379306,5,B00004YWJE,"After the popcorn puff of the film I decided not to watch this series... then I noticed the fuss being made over the continuing series.
I caught up about Series 3 and have been watching ever since, it's all grown up now of course (with resurrection and lesbianism!) but this first series is great.  There's a little more goofiness, and humour, than the subsequent series, but it is great to see how Sarah Michelle Gellar and David Boreanaz built up their initial relationship, and how Darla (later of Angel fame) fits in.
The additional features are quirky, but I bought it for the series not the extras.  The sound quality is superb, and although the picture has the ever present US TV graininess it's well worth putting up with.",1021420800,,730,4.651162790697675
1379307,4,B00004YWJE,"There are so many reasons to watch Buffy, it's impossible to list them in a brief precis:  epic scope, mythic resonance, a completely believable variety of diverse characters, witty scripts, sparkling dialogue, wonderfully realized performances, and even a legitimate scare, here and there, along the way.
Every season has its own feel and flavor, and its own self-contained story arc.  The first season, needless to say, introduced all the basic characters and situations, emphasizing humor, courage and loyalty.  The Order of Aurelius, headed by the arch-vampire known as The Master, was Buffy's Season One trial, though it properly only covered half the total number of episodes, the rest being filled out by ""incidental"" horrors of the Hellmouth, where the supernatural manifests itself more than in most places of the world.
Against The Master and his sinister, apocalyptic vampire Order, are:  Buffy Summers (Sarah Michelle Gellar), the born ""Slayer,"" whose dharma is to be the one girl in all the world equipped from birth with the strength and stamina to thin-out the vampire ranks and prevent their overrunning the world; her watcher, Rupert Giles (Anthony Stewart Head), an introverted British bookworm and surrogate father, whose knowledge and training are invaluable to Buffy; Xander Harris (Nicholas Brendon), a good-hearted unlucky social loser but pithily witty analyst, whose love and loyalty to Buffy elevate him to the rank of unsung hero/helpmeet; and Willow Rosenberg (Alyson Hannigan), a scholarly computer nerd and gentle soul of great innate wisdom.
Added assistance are provided by Angel (David Boreanaz), the vampire with a restored soul who becomes the great love of Buffy's life, and reluctant sometime-helper Cordelia Chase (Charisma Carpenter), the most pathologically self-absorbed beauty queen on campus.
The balance of horror and humor in the first season is very well managed, and the cast click together with remarkable chemistry and joie de vivre.  The only flaw in these early episodes is the sometimes laughably low budget, though the show beautifully compensates with clever theatrical tricks, the most notable of which is making the underground Order of Aurelius appear much larger and more populated than it is by the use of a multitude of candles and limbo lighting.

The first Buffy/Angel meeting on Season 1 is so great, one would never guess what's to come.

I have since started watching every episode that I could find(new and reruns)I WAS HOOKED.Buffy combines humor,horror and social commentary.

And the commentary from Joss Whedon is a wonderful insight into the series (thematically and practically).
I would have given it five stars, except that the disks were a bit hard to navigate. It was tough to figure out how to access the commentary and other extras. And there should have been more commentary.

(As we all know, europeans have like up to season 5 for Buffy and already 1 and 2 of Angel-yes, I am totally jealous of you guys over there!!) Anyways, to my point...
As soon as I had the extra cash I ran out to the store and got my own copy. Got it home, started checking it all out and surprise! The photo galleries don't work! Okay, so I thought maybe it was just the DVD player I was using. So, I took it into another room and tried it on the other DVD player we have which is a totally different model and brand, didn't work on that one either. So, I returned it to the store and got another one. Well, it doesn't work on either player on that set either. So, just to warn you prospective buyers, there are certain sections on the entire DVD set that aren't compatible on select DVD players. Other reviews listed on Amazon have pointed out problems with the script and the entire 3rd disk itself.
Just a warning.
But, I am not saying that its totally not worth buying. If you love the show and are like me and have completely worn out all of your video tapes of TV recorded episodes, the DVD is so much better with out those pesky commercials.

1379317,3,B00004YWJE,"I loved what was there....the transfer quality but it seemed quite good to me.
I'd give it 5 stars were it not for the lousy interface:
1) I couldn't access the scripts on my player. Thinking that it was either the disc or my system I took the discs into a retail store and was able to access the scripts there: therefore, it's my player.  I suspect this is unlikely to happen to most people, but it did happen to me.  While I consider this to be no big deal I thought I'd mention it.(Yes, I could access the photo gallery, just not the scripts.)
2) Not having cable, my exposure to THE SOPRANOS and SEX AND THE CITY has been via rentals at Blockbuster.  The DVD interfaces for those series are excellant and should be conceptually emulated for any episodic DVD collections.  Using them as standards, the Buffy 1 DVD's fall short in a couple of areas: a clear indication of the chronological order of the episodes (i.e., across then down or down then across?), a text description of the episode, ""Previously on..."" snippets, ""Next On..."" previews.  Yes, some of this info is in the attached pamphlet but it REALLY bugged me that I needed the pamphlet to determine which was the 2nd & which the 3rd episode on each disc.
I doubt that [a movie store] would be interested in renting the Buffy discs like they do SOPRANOS, et al since Buffy is a broadcast show, but even if they were interested the interface would make this an unsatisfactory rental experience.  THERE IS NO REASON A PAMPHLET SHOULD BE NECESSARY TO WATCH A DVD!  THIS IS BAD BAD BAD DESIGN.  DON'T DO IT AGAIN!
ahem, sorry for shouting.
Also, in his interviews Josh talks about how they had the luxury of going back and reshooting some key scenes in Welcome to the Hellmouth (episode 1) after they had wrapped Episode 12 because the series hadn't started airing yet.  Specifically a scene between Buffy & Giles in the library and Darla's non-death, etc.  Boy, I would have LOVED to see the ORIGINAL versions of those scenes.  Being told about them was interesting but SEEING them would have been terrific (if they still exist).",1019001600,,2090,4.561497326203209
1379318,5,B00004YWJE,"When I first saw the promos for 'Buffy the Vampire Slayer' on television, I remember making fun of the show for its stupidity and childish plot lines. My snobbishness towards the show changed once I saw the excellent season finale of Season 2.
I missed out on much of Season 1 in repeats and I vaguely knew of some of the references to the big bad of the season, 'The Master,' and Xander's obsession with the 'bug lady' so I was excited to learn that Season One would finally be released on DVD and that I would be able to watch all episodes in order.
I will be honest, the early episodes are a little strange and definitely show a lack of funding for production, but do not let this deter you from buying this DVD to see where it all began. The two part season opener, ""Welcome to the Hellmouth"" and ""The Harvest"" set up the show and the characters. Other standout episodes are ""The Puppet Show"" which is hands down one of the funniest Buffy episodes ever, ""Nightmares,"" ""Angel,"" in which we learn about the curse on Angel and his relationship with Darla, and the action/drama packed season finale ""Prophecy Girl.""
There is only one throwaway episode out of the twelve, ""Teacher's Pet"" which is sort of goofy and melodramatic. Naturally, it is important for the development of the storyline, but it certainly slows the entire season down a bit. The extras are cool, there are some cast and character biographies and some short interviews with Joss and David Boreanez, but other than that, they are nothing special. All in all, this is a great DVD and a great place for new Buffy fans to start.",1019001600,,1594,4.538194444444445
1379319,4,B00004YWJE,"Buffy's first season may not be the best one but it sure gives a taste for what Joss Whedon is able to do. These are the days when Buffy was closer to The X-Files estructure (standalones or monsters of the week and vampire related episodes). The truth about this series is that all previous judgements about the title or the genre are misleading. This is a darn good show that, just like X-Files, works at an enormous range of levels (psicology, mythology, allegoric, socilogy, etc). But all that is nothing if you are not really entertained... and with BUFFY you are really entertained. This season brings BUFFY to a californian town called Sunnydale, which turns out to be the hellmouth. Therefore all sorts of evil forces and creatures converge in this little city full of scared people... I love this aspect of the series (hey! I'm live in Colombia and from what always appears on the news, sometimes it seems like everyone thinks I live in the hellmouth -and I don't-). She is joined by a nerd (Willow, played by Alison Hannigan), a normal guy who tries to fit in his school (Xander played by Nicholas Brendon) and a brittish librarian (Giles played by Anthony Stewart Head). The entire season is based upon a specific threat that comes to reality in the final episode (Prophecy Girl): a very old and powerful vampire who is trapped between dimensions wants to go back to earth. The mixture of humor, horror and action is well achieved. The music could be better, but this is, overall, a very good season... it is worth the time. I was particularly surprised when in the episode ""The Pack"" a bunch of teens possesed by hienas eat principal Fluttie... then I realized: this series is willing to go all the way. And it has really gone all the way in this six years.
In this season we also begin to know Angel and his background... I have never been a fan of this character (I think Buffy could do so much better than this old tortured, misterious guy... she should be with a lighter person, someone who just can wait her at home, and when she gets there about three o'clock in the morning says: ""hi, hon, how was the slaying tonight?"") but I have to admit that his dramatic impact is powerful.
I have to be honest, I expected much more from the DVD box. The booklet is simple and the box has no real taste. The extras, in the other hand, are pretty good... the script is a good option although I have never been able to read the whole thing because I hate to read long things on a screen. The interviews with Whedon and Boreanaz are ok, but where is the rest of the cast?
Anyways, this is a very good item... and it is a must-have if you are a fan of the series because... well, this is pretty much where it all started (I'd like to think that this is the begining and not the movie which I didn't like).",1018915200,2,2807,4.420849420849421

""Buffy"" is all about growing up. Though the stories are very fantastic(as in Science Fiction/Fantasy), the issues dealt with are very real. From peer-pressure to dating to parent/child relationships, this is a very interesting view of teen life.
All good fiction is really brought about by the relationships explored, and though there are a certain number of internal inconsistencies (What year was the lead character born? What class is she in? etc.) the first season is very good fiction.
If there is a weakness in the set, it is the extras. I didn't look for easter eggs, but the extras gave very little information and I found Mr. Whedon's commentaries added very little, if anything, to the set's overall value.",1017878400,,959,4.853658536585366

If you have seen Season One before, there are no surprises here. The season arc focuses on Buffy taking on the Master. Angel makes a few appearances. Willow and Xander are their most nerdy / geeky (respectively). Cordi adds the biting sarcasm to the show. I couldn't help but notice how short / tight Buffy's clothes were back then (sex sells right?). Basically, the stage is set for all the characters we have grown to love as they evolve from angst-ridden teens battling demons to young adults with their own demons (the current season six).
FYI: for a complete description of the episodes that make up this season, visit [the website]
The picture quality is good (for the most part). Creator Joss Whedon does the commentary on the first couple of the episodes and sheds some interesting info on some of the thinking behind the scenes. There is a very, very short interview with David Boreanaz (Angel) which will disappoint most Angel fans as he says nothing of substance, and the interview is so brief you hardly have time to drool!
Otherwise, the DVD is light in the way of features, but it is a must for Buffy-maniacs everywhere. I can't wait for season two to come out. Hopefully the DVD offering will improve, as the show did in that season.",1017446400,,1371,4.622950819672131

With 12 episodes for [the price] I figured I couldn't lose. So I bought the thing. I have to admitt I really like it too. It's no Emmy award winning drama, but it sure is fun. The stories are great and I really like the charecters. Hopefully they'll start releasing the DVDs faster so I can get caught up. If you haven't watched it give it a try.

The characters are complex, the monsters are fantastic, and the storylines never cease to amaze me. Joss Whedon is a god!

Enough of the gushing? Ok, this set of DVDs is quite good. For anyone who hasn't been able to watch all the early shows, this is your chance to find them back-to-back and uninterrupted. There aren't a lot of extras on these DVDs (and thus the reasonable price), but Whedon's commentary and the cast interviews are very interesting. I have enjoyed watching these early shows and seeing these young characters mature and develop so much. It's amazing to see the earliest parts of the BTVS mythology; it's even more amazing that this show is true to its own myths, and Whedon weaves this element into all the shows. This isn't just a show for teens--trust me, I'm a 30-something who watches the show religiously. If you are brand new to Buffy, for goodness' sake, tune in and watch the show.

The series starts where the 1992 movie left off. The same creator/writer (Joss Whedon) digs deeper and manages to make the demon world seem real. The dialogue is superb with wit, the action is fun, and for the horror fan you've got enough demons to keep yourself entertained and longing for more. Out of 7 seasons of this show, the 2nd season remains my absolute favorite (see my review for that), but you need to see the first season in order to understand the relationships for the second season.

1379331,3,B00004YWJE,"This is a hard review for me to write. While the 12 episodes in this set are excellent TV, and I loved the beginnings of this series, the technical flaws overwhelm this DVD release.
I'm not a techno-guy; I got my DVD player as a wedding present. But I expect that digital technology should offer an improvement over VHS quality, or at least be as good. For this set, you actually see a dramatic loss in quality over the 6 episodes you can buy on VHS. At first I thought I was mistaken, so I played an episode on VHS and at the same time on the DVD; switching back and forth, I was sickened by the clear conclusion: The transfer to DVD was poorly done, so much so that if I were able to buy the other 6 episodes on VHS, I would -- and I'd return the DVD set, or donate it to the library, but I wouldn't keep it in my collection.
I should be able to keep the DVD's as replacements for my VHS tapes, but not with this set. There is no excuse for the abysmal quality of the transfer; the video levels make each episode look like they were shot in 8mm back in 1978, and the audio isn't much better. Again, I'm not much on the technology, but this release is an insult to BtVS fans who've waited so patiently for this otherwise great series to reach their private collections.
That said -- if you've actually gotten past the commentary about the terrible quality of the DVD's -- the episodes are priceless TV. Not many shows deserve such praise, but this series -- at least in this season, and the next -- does. It was funny, campy, slick, intelligent, and got some great acting from its stars. Before the series began to take itself too seriously, and before all the complexity of several seasons began to weigh it down, this first season really sparkled. For this, I applaud Joss Whedon & Crew for their first-rate, remarkable work.
Too bad Warner Bros. shipped such a pathetically transferred set to the public; they'd better fix their quality control for the 2nd season.",1016582400,2,1968,4.3651226158038146

1379334,5,B00004YWJE,"""Buffy the Vampire Slayer"" was a critical hit in its first season on TV, airing in the spring of 1997 on the then-unproven WB Network.  The show wasn't a must-watch cultural phenomenon at that point, but I watched about half the episodes and knew at the time that something very special was waiting to be born here.  Happily, we were all proven right a year later.  Now that Season 1 is offred on DVD for the first time, the show's beginnings are as attractive as ever.
The first 12 episodes fall into two categories:  light horror  (stories reminiscent of ""Twilight Zone"", ""X-Files"", and of course, ""Goosebumps""), and an epic season-long story arc.
Shows like ""The Witch"" (the first episode I saw), ""The Pack"", ""Puppet Show"", and ""Out of Mind, Out of Sight"" (then known online as ""Invisible Girl"") follow the same format:  A creepy supernatural menace mirrors the Sunnydale High School kids' own insecurities.  These episodes do a fine job of introducing the small regular cast.  Cordelia is a shallow cheerleader who finds a heroic side.  Xander is a wannabe Lothario, and Willow just wants a date with him.  Buffy's mom is completely in the dark about her daughter's job as Slayer.  All these characters would grow and evolve in later season, and at times seem a little flat in the early going (especially Mrs. Summers, who'd grow in importance as the show moved along).  However, moments of real horror are present here, most notably the death of Principal Flutie in ""The Pack"".
The remaining episodes trace a story arc:  an ancient evil, the vampire Master, is trapped in a fallen church under the school, and with the help of vampire minions -- and a child to lead them -- must break captivity and kill Buffy in order to reclaim the world.  Each story escalates in both tension, and significance to the arc.  In ""Never Kill a Boy on the First Date"", Buffy slays vampires, but fails to notice the young Anointed One.  In ""Angel"", we learn that the tall, thin (though not anymore!) brooding stranger with the crush on Buffy was indeed a vampire himself.  ""Prophecy Girl"", the season finale, breaks all the rules by killing off not only the show's main villain, but also its heroine.
The DVD's features are sparse and standard.  Of little interest are the photo gallery and previously-published pilot scripts.  Better are the recycled-from-VHS interviews with series creator Joss Whedon, short but revealing.  Most interesting is the Whedon commentary track on the two-episode pilot, offering revealing information (the school ""set"" was in fact one corridor, used several times; the entrance to The Bronze was in fact the exterior of the warehouse where ""Buffy"" is filmed) and wry humor.
The best of ""Buffy"" is yet to come on DVD, and it would be welcome to see more commentary from Whedon and other production regulars, as well as from castmembers like Alyson Hannigan, the show's breakout character Willow, and Anthony Stuart Head, as the fussy librarian Giles who anchors the early shows with his store of occult knowledge and crisp tweed suit.  Still, there's a lot of mileage to enjoy from these first three discs.",1016323200,3,3122,4.863894139886578

I really love this show.  Ms. Gellar is a wonderful actress.  The supporting cast is a lot of fun and I adore Mr. Head, the actor who plays Giles.  The episodes are entertaining and unique.  I can't wait for the second season.  I am addicted to the ""Buffy the Vampire Slayer"" series.",1016150400,,458,4.317647058823529

(no offense intended, but you know what I mean).  I'm 32, far from the so-called teen demographic, and while I see why teens would love it, I think there is so much in this show that every age can enjoy it.  I watched one episode late at night and was instantly hooked.  That weekend, I bought the complete first season and, while eating chicken soup and getting over a bad cold, spent the entire day on the couch happy and content learning about Buffy's world.  I now watch as many episodes as I can.  The show contains really clever, intelligent, ironic moments, as well as classic references to literature, pop culture, mythology.  It also is plain funny, a lot!
This show reverses much of what we think about ""women"" in TV & drama, and it makes us think about those roles we take for granted.  I also love the relationship that develops between Buffy & her group of loyal friends & sidekicks, even her enemies!  I'm counting the days till the next season is released, and wish they would just hurry it up!
As for the DVD version, it's crisper, cleaner than the TV signal.  You don't have to watch commercials and you also get extras.  As Buffy says in one of the earliest episodes-- ""You didn't think I'd miss this, did you?""",1016150400,2,1375,4.46

So much has changed, and watching the first season feels very nostalgic.  There were actually a couple episodes I hadn't seen like ""Nightmares"" and ""The Puppet Show""  that were great.  You can see why this is still the best show on TV.  Also Joss's commentary on a couple of the episodes was really interesting.  He's a genious!",1015891200,,602,4.418181818181818

1379340,5,B00004YWJE,"Typical of Buffy's 'older' fans, I discovered her late in the second season.  The problem with being an intellectual snob is that one only discovers television shows by accident, which means you've always missed a good deal of history.  So, despite an occasional rerun, I pretty much lost the entire first season.  To make matters worse, I've only recently acquired the ability to watch DVD's.  I am pleased to announce that my woes are now over.  With the release of the first season on DVD and the up and coming release of the second season, I am about to enter Buffy heaven.
Watching these episodes I was struck by the talented writing and acting that were present right from the beginning.  It is immediately apparent that the show was never intended to be yet another scary film take-off.  From Sarah Gellar to Anthony Head the actors display an almost effortless professionalism.  And the writing is filled with the kind of bright dialog and wit to which us adults can only aspire.
This set contains the first 12 episodes which are all there was of the first season.  Officially, that's from ''Welcome to the Hellmouth' to 'Prophecy Girl'.  It's hard to pick one out as a favorite, but I'm currently very fond of 'Teacher's Pet' in which Xander's woes remind me of much of my own early history.  All are wonderful, and I no longer think of myself as one of the BTVS disadvantaged.
In addition to the episodes themselves, there are interviews with Joss Whedon and David Boreanaz, a full length commentary on 'Welcome to the Hellmouth' by Whedon, who also provides several interviews.  Television trailers, photo stills, and the original pilot script are there as well.  Languages alternatives are English and French (also available in surround sound).  Spanish and English subtitles are also provided.  Sound and video quality are excellent.  I had a problem getting the second and third DVD's to play on my PC, which were resolved by updating the DVD drive's firmware.",1015632000,18,1974,4.847761194029851

You get a taste though of the great dialogue to come and the Bittersweetness of knowing where these characters will be in 5 years.
Makes sure and turn on Joss Whedon's great commentary. The comments that got me where the whole Xander vs. the Skateboard thing.

It makes things in later seasons make more sense when the characters are making past references. :) The plots are good, my only gripe is that it doesn't have all of my favorite characters during the first season. But it certainly makes a great intro to the second season (which I hope they release soon).
All in all it was pretty darn good for being a first season. I gave it 4 stars because I enjoyed it. You don't get much other than the 12 episodes though. There isn't too many extras on it.. so don't get your heart set on that. They have a few scripts from episodes though.

When I purchased this DVD collection at Media Play, I was expecting something along the lines of X-files, with well-written, memorable, and chilling episodes, the kind that leave your eyes crinkled as you remember each moment in the darkness of your bed. Sarah Michelle Gellar and her cast are undoubtedly talented actors, but the emphasis on teenage problems and attractions (numerous Buffy cleavage shots) make this series teen-only. I know that the movie reviewer in USA Today has lauded this show in many of his articles. I must disagree with him on this. After watching several episodes, I find little beyond Ms. Gellar's looks (and she is very beautiful) to recommend this series, except to those who like their TV shows excessively stereotypical (geeks, dweebs, California babes) and like cheesy, but poignantly bad writing and plots. Turn off your brain or keep your eyes glued to the most important part of the show (Ms. Gellar's bust, because that is all they focus on), and you will find this show exceptional. Otherwise, get the X-files or Twin Peaks and the real deal.",1015027200,7,1085,4.967032967032967
1379344,5,B00004YWJE,"It's been a long time coming, but Buffy if finally hitting DVD here in America. I'm glad we get the quality of this brilliant show on DVD, but am highly disappointed with the extra features on the DVD. First off, there are all 12 episodes of the show's first season on 3 discs. Since it was a mid season replacement, it only had 12 episodes instead of the regular 22. The first season had a few monumental episodes like the two part opener ""Welcome To The Hellmouth"" and ""The Harvest"". Those two were put together as a premiere episode movie. ""Angel"" is an important and pivotal episode. It's where we first learn of who and what Angel really is. Alarming and fantastic. Then there's the season ender, ""Prophecy Girl"", which deals with Buffy defeating this season's main villain, The Master. The other 8 episodes run the gamut from good to mediocre. The weak ones are ""Teacher's Pet"", ""I Robot - You Jane"", and ""The Pack"". That last one does have some chilling and memorable moments tho. The better ones are ""Witch"", with Buffy dealing with a cheerleading witch who is getting the competition out of the way. ""Nightmares"" has our beloved scooby gang being confronted with their worst nightmares when they seem to be coming to life. It turns out that a comatose boy is projecting nightmares to come true after suffering a shocking abuse that I won't reveal here. ""Invisible Girl"" is a situation based in all too true reality. A plain jane girl literally becomes invisible because everyone at school, students and teachers, barely register that she's there. She's so invisible to them that she literally turns that way. ""The Puppet Show"" is a light, but fun, episode with the gang having to participate in the school play. There's a demon running aorund needing brains as well. I don't want to give anything else away. The reason this show is so loved and acclaimed is that this is just good, intelligent writing. The characters are strong and real. The actors had instant chemistry in the first episode and are all supreme actors. The history and mythology of the show are as rich and deep as you can get. This first season, however, didn't necessarily explore it as much as it did in the seasons to follow. The DVD extras however, lead much to be desired. You get commentary from creator Joss Whedon on episodes 1 and 2. You also get the original pilot script for the first episode. There's a photo gallery, and interviews with Joss and David Boreanaz. While the features here are nice, it just isn't enough. You'd think there would be more behind the scenes stuff and interviews. ... I hope [they] give us more goodies on future DVD releases.

1379345,5,B00004YWJE,"buffy the vampire slayer is one of the most cool tv shows and i think the first season is the best of all seasons... it is not too complicated, but it contains love, hate, belonging, trust and friendship. although the theme is supernatural, it is really well combined with real life; one moment buffy is fighting with the demons, and the other minute you see her kissing her boyfriend (angel--for the first season). buffy was just like a normal teenage girl (and very popular) in l.a. one day a man comes and tells her that she is the vampire slayer ( a girl who is born into each generation)
her life changes; she gets kicked out of the school, becomes a loser...
then her mother decides to move to sunnydale... a cool town... but it turn out that there is a port that opens to hell under sunnydale. buffy has to fight against demons to keep the town, sorry, the world, safe. what will happen to her in the hellmouth?

When this dvd set was released, I bought it to see what the big deal was. I was very impressed with the show, including the writing, the supporting cast, but mostly with the underrated acting of Sarah Michelle Gellar. I am not sure if she has ever won an Emmy for the show, but I sure think she deserves one.
The show is so much fun to watch on dvd, and it was great to see the series from the beginning. I am now watching many of the  old episodes on the cable channel Fx, and watching the new episodes on UPN on Tuesday nights. The dvd set has made a new fan out of me.
Now the series is great, but the picture quality is below average for dvd. I see too many digital artifacts, and even though the show was shot in 16mm, I think Fox could have done a more careful job remastering the shows to improve the picture quality. Fox also should have given the shows 5.1 surround sound, which would really make the show come alive in your living room! I hope on future releases that they do clean up the picture quality and have 5.1 surround sound.
I still recommend this dvd set to old and new fans because the show is so good, and it will make new fans out of non-believers.",1014508800,2,1292,4.106719367588933

When I opened the DVD package, the second DVD kept fall out of the package slot. Not to mention how scratched up they get. I recommend that you put the DVD's in a cd holder and not use the package. Third is the features which I won't even bother with. They are horrible. Finally, how come in the UK, four seasons are already out on DVD for Buffy, and 2 for Angel? In America, things are sure running slow!! Anyway, besides all this, the episodes are fantastic, just no the DVD or the quality.",1013817600,,802,4.282894736842105

The picture quality and audio quality are not bad but not the best due to the film Season 1 was shot on.  What is the most funny is watching it in French, the characters so don't have the same voice and sometimes, I can't even tell which voice is from whom.
Now, the second part of this post, the people who keep ""dissing"" the features.  If it wouldn't have been of Fox, the DVD would not even exist so be glad that it does.  People keep complaning that they want out-takes and deleted scenes but Fox is not the one who doesn't want to give you those things, Joss Whedon is.  He said that what he showed on TV was what he is going to give on video and DVD.  So, people, stop complaining about it.  If you're not happy with the features, then don't buy the DVD.  I saw alot of DVDs who have only a trailer as a special feature and that's it!  We're even lucky that they put special features on this DVD.

2. The menus are poorly laid out. The special features menu, for example, isn't accessible from the main menu, only from the episode menus.
3. No Play All Episodes mode. You can have to go back to the main menu to play each episode. Kind of annoying.
4. Typos. Typos. Typos.
5. There's nothing to indicate which special features are on which disc.

It's the pure campiness and sometimes perverse nature of the Buffy universe that keeps drawing me back time after time.  I hadn't seen the whole first season before, I'd seen bits and pieces but I wanted to see it in order with no commercials.  This release fulfills my wish, the extras are pretty timid, but most TV season DVDs are this way.  I like the commentaries though, humorous as well as giving me those tidbits I crave.  The acting, directing, and writing have all been disected more than I can ever do, so I won't even go into it.  I guess, my favorite episodes are ""Out of Sight, Out of Mind"", and ""Witch.""

Instead, ""Buffy"" is one of the smartest things on TV in years. It has taken more risks than some films are willing to take, and continues to surprise viewers every week. It should not be missed! The first season was exceptional, but a tad uneven, although most first seasons are (for good reasons). ""Prophecy Girl"" really makes the whole first twelve episodes worth it. Essential ""Buffy"". Enough about the show, you know it is good, but I've heard a lot of complaints about the video/sound quality. There is a good reason for this. ""Buffy"" had a terribly small budget in its first two seasons, and had to be shot on 16mm, where most television product is shot on 35mm. 16mm doesn't allow for much in film, and that easily explains issues with grain and such. Truth is, these episodes look better than they have on television. The lack of extras are disappointing, but there were intended to be more extras on these discs. There were issues with rights to certain materials (unaired pilot for one) that kept this set from being totally worth the price of admission.

Like a televised comic-book, Buffy brings in elements of action, romance, comedy and good old fashioned teen angst together in one great package.
Its too bad, though, that the DVDs are light on extras. I mean, we waited forever to get them while Europe already has season four on DVD. You'd think in all that time we could've gotten some screen tests or bloopers or cut scenes?

1379358,5,B00004YWJE,"Could anyone have mastered a tv series of Buffy the Vampire Slayer besides Joss Whedon? Absolutely not. Joss has created a show that is called by critics ""Hip"" and ""Imaginative"" and "". . . with a sense of style."" The show is all of that, but much much more to its brigade of fans around the world. Including me. I've been a fan ever since the first season, which is now presented in this crazy thing we call DVD.
  Buffy the Vampire Slayer's premise is familiar to almost everyone. It's about Buffy Summers, a girl who was born with the birth right of being the Slayer. One girl in all the world who must destroy the forces of darkness until her death. After burning down her high school gym in LA which was infested with vampires, she and her mother move to Sunnydale, CA where life is supposed be a fresh start. But nothing's that fresh in a Slayer's life. Buffy soon meets up with Xander, Willow, and Giles who become her Slayerettes and aid her in her battles. Along the way we are also introduced to Cordelia and Jenny Calendar, who even in small ways, help Buffy along the way.
 Joss and co. set a mighty firm foundation for the show with its first season. The mood is right, the soundtrack is awesome, and his cast of mostly unknown talent is freshly recieved. Sarah Michelle Gellar, as the lead role, perfected the character of Buffy from the first scene. Her acting is superb. Alyson Hannigan and Nicholas Brendon are her companions Willow and Xander. Each gave depth to their character in only the first episode. Anthony Stewart Head and Kristine Sutherland balance the show with being the grown ups, and not being over grown uppish. Tony Head is excellent as Buffy's Watcher, Giles. Rounding out the first season's main cast is Charisma Carpenter and Robia La Morte. Charisma perfected her role as the snobby Cordelia, and you couldn't help but fall in love with Robia as Jenny Calendar.
 The DVD's picture and sound is the best it can be since Buffy was originally shot on 16mm. The commentaries are very interesting to those who are fans of the show. Joss gives little snippets on ideas that were thrown away and other interesting facts about behind-the-scenes stuff. There are also interviews with Joss and David Boreanaz. A Buffy trailer, picture gallery, and the script for the Pilot are also available.
 Buffy the Vampire Slayer, now in its 6th season, is still going strong. There have been many new faces to come and go, and many new intelligent storylines. I'm sure there are many still to come.",1013299200,2,2515,4.630044843049327

Thank goodness FX is running double-doses of the episodes daily so I am able to see what I've missed; but when the next seasons are released on DVD, I'll be there.  As for the box-set, I would have liked more extras on the set but what is there is enjoyable and not extraneous crap (like the X-files including their commercials on a separate disc - how lame!).
If you're not a big Buffy fan or, like me, have somehow never come into contact with this special corner of hell, give it a try.  The acting is superb, the scripts and dialogue are wickedly funny, and the mythology puts a lot of other modern shows to shame.  Big kudos for the final episode on this set - Prophecy Girl.  After years of being subjected to cliffhanger season finales that make you wait 4 to 6 months for resolution, how refreshing to see a self-contained season finale that not only kicks butt, but also manages to tie up some loose ends without the obligatory ""to be continued"" ending.  I am impressed beyond belief.  I can heartily recommend this set; now where's the next one?",1013126400,4,1302,4.347107438016529
1379362,4,B00004YWJE,"It's Buffy, so the show is great.  However, the DVD is not very sharp.  It's more like VHS quality.  Also, the sound transfer for the dialog is disappointing.",1012953600,3,158,4.571428571428571
1379363,5,B00004YWJE,"First of all, if you loved the movie, you'll love the show.  The show isn't quite as camp as the movie, which truthfully is something of a relief; the movie just wouldn't fly now.
The show itself, while having a little of the shakiness that any new series will have, is remarkably self-assured and inventive right off the bat.  The high-school metaphors are a little obvious at times, but it's usually funnier than your average sitcom.  That's part of the reason I broke my rule about buying season-sets; normally, I prefer to be able to buy just the episodes I want and not have a third of the season that I almost never watch.
What's really surprising is, truthfully, how quickly the show improved in just twelve episodes.  You can see it in the technical details; compare the fights in the first disc to the fights in the third, the latter are much better choreographed.  Whedon managed to sketch in his characters, provide some great one-off episodes (""Nightmares"" and ""Out of Mind, Out of Sight"" are great examples), and also have an ongoing plot arc that he concludes in a quite satisfying and internally logical way.  It's a knack ""The X-Files"" used to have before Chris Carter got so self-indulgent (and, if the sixth season of Buffy is any indication, Whedon is beginning to go that route too.)
This can be taken as either an introduction to the Buffy show (which is in regular reruns every night on FX, in addition to new episodes every Tuesday on UPN), or as its own self-contained little miniseries. Either way, it's a great set to own.",1012953600,4,1548,4.652014652014652

After, well, years of nagging, cajoling, harrassing, and begging, several friends finally managed to convince my husband and myself that Buffy the Vampire Slayer is more than well worth watching (for so many reasons that the current editorial limit precludes my listing them), and we were immediately hooked in October, 2001.  We breathlessly awaited the arrival of the first season DVD set, and it holds pride of place in our collection.  Although I would wish it had more extras, the lack of commercials makes it well worth owning.  I also enjoy the pleasant lack of horrible editing that, um, the current channels that play the repeats plague us with.  ""Aren't you just going 'oooh?'""",1012780800,,715,4.974789915966387
1379366,4,B00004YWJE,"Yeah, you heard me. Each episode has more originality, humor, heartbreak, suspense, and fantastic performances than most shows have in their entire run. The DVD of Season One is somewhat lacking in the features department, and the show really hit its stride in Season Two, but this is still a must-have for Buffy fans or for anyone who appreciates good television. And let's face it: there's not a whole lot worth watching these days.",1012780800,2,434,4.878378378378378
1379367,4,B00004YWJE,"I had heard about the Buffy series for quite a while, how good it was supposed to be and so on, but couldn't watch it locally until FX started reruns of the first five seasons. The plot sounds like a joke, so does the title, but Buffy the Vampire Slayer actually works very well. The stories generally are good, maybe better on average than most series, character development is much better than most shows deliver. If you can handle the idea of a teenaged girl with super abilities doing battle with evil creatures, often coming up with snappy little comments during the fight (typically the  fights look very well choreographed), you'll find plenty to watch here. I've often noticed throughout the series that the stories seem to have a very developed background (based on fact?)and many of the characters can come up with the most off the wall comments or actions during a scene. Sometimes a character will make an appearance in one episode and be seen in others later on, maybe even years later, very unusual for a series to do that the way Buffy does it. This show is one of the few that can even take a weak story and manage to come up with some good points. Buffy the Vampire Slayer has an unusual treatment of the battle with vampires and demons concept but it is done very well. The box is marked 12 episodes, some have said it called for 24 as later seasons have, all I really have to complain about is that the cast bios are about 2 years out of date which would fit in with what someone said about these DVD's first coming out about then in the rest of the world.",1012608000,2,1575,4.412371134020619

It is about a girl who is ignored so much, she becomes invisible. She becomes vengeful and starts a grudge on the one who started her prob.

But beware: the third (and only the third) disk in the set, contains over two minutes of Buffy-unrelated advertisements before the menu comes up.  I didn't know I was BUYING ads.  When the second season is released, I'll definately inquire about this before I spend any money.",1012608000,,322,4.925925925925926
1379370,5,B00004YWJE,"I am very pleased at how this collection has been released. While many shows are coming two hour-long episodes per disk at little less than the cost of this three-DVD set, the people behind Buffy are giving the fans a great deal. I applaud the offering and look forward to picking up later collections as well. (The set came with an insert promising Season Two in June, can hardly wait!)
The episodes themselves are a bit uneven as Joss Whedon, cast and crew found their legs. What is great to see, however, is how much groundwork for later seasons (and the Angel spin-off) is laid down in these first episodes. Later foes make their appearances here and much of the base information of the Buffy-verse is set out.
By the end of the first season, the show had found itself and moved beyond the ""monster of the week"" format and showed its great strength: the depth of the characters and the honesty of their interaction. While the FX network is showing re-runs, this collection provides the best way to discover what all your friends are so excited about. (No commercials and shown in order, unlike FX.) Buffy remains one of the best-written shows on television; get this box-set and see where it all began.",1012608000,2,1206,4.640186915887851

1379372,5,B00004YWJE,"Buffy is a great heroine who gives somewhat of a cheery prospect to this series. She's funny, and at times, sarcastic. Which makes the series not only a drama, but a comedy. Williow is the shy bookworm, who is Buffy's best friend. Xander loves Buffy, and shows it frequently throughout the first series. Giles is the mysterious librarian-who is also Buffy's Watcher. Angel is Buffy's love, who has secrets of his own. This is a series which I try to watch religiously. I reccomend it to everyone, no matter how old or young, for this is a spectacluar series.

1379373,4,B00004YWJE,"Let's get this straight.  I'm a very unlikely candidate for Buffy fandom.  Even now, current episodes can't be found on Midland TV.  But one afternoon in a Dallas hotel, my wife and I caught ""The Real Me"".  If you're not into the mythos, this is the first full episode with Buffy's sister, Dawn.  We found ourselves laughing out loud at the well-written dialogue.  Then FX began carrying Buffy reruns daily and, quicker than the disintegration of a staked vamp, we were hooked.
This DVD set gives you a great introduction into Buffy's universe.  You get to meet each of the ""Scooby Gang"" as they discover what has to be one of the worst kept secrets in history - that slight, 16-year-old Buffy Anne Summers is ""The Chosen One"", the one girl in all the world who can stop the Apocalypse.  Which she does, time and time again.
Creator Joss Whedon's stated purpose is to show adolescence as the literal hell it was.  He succeeds admirably.
My only complaint with the DVD is that the extra features aren't very fulfilling.  But hey, I bought the set so I could enjoy the episodes themselves.  In that respect, it comes through with flying colors.
So, a five-star rating for the episodes docked by one star for a lack of quality extras yields a set that every wannabe Slayerette must have.  Bring on Season Two (and Three, and Four, and Five...).",1012176000,,1341,4.6118143459915615

It's great to look back at the characters, and to see the early episodes. Like I said it's great to have the whole season on DVD, but there are some major let downs. First off the picture quality is only decent, it's a few steps above television which isn't that great. I would have thought more effort would have been put into the transfer, though it doesn't mean it's unwatchable, just more of a let down. Another thing I was disapointed in was the extras. What's here is great, the interviews and the commentary with Joss is nice, but why is there so little? For example, he'll talk about a certain episode in the special features and you'll enjoy it and expect a little something for each one, but noooo. It's more of a tease. What extras are here are great, a nice photo gallery, pilot script etc. I may complain a little, however I'm not disapointed in the least, mostly because Buffy is such a great show. Plus the price was good, I still had to knock off a star for the lack of extras and the transfer. Even though it's a little lacking it's by far worth the price. Any Buffy fan would be proud to own it, and if you are like me, you are even more excited for season 2 in June. I hope the next one has more to offer though.",1012176000,7,1359,4.112781954887218

1379378,4,B00004YWJE,"I have been a big fan of this series since I first saw it in reruns the summer after first season, so of course I was super-excited about Season One finally being released on DVD here in the US.
But the DVD just doesn't live up to what I expected. The menus on the DVDs are not the most user-friendly (all you get are episode titles for that disc; you have to go into an episode to access any special features on that disc). And speaking of special features, I wanted more. I am a big fan of Joss Whedon in particular, and having his commentary on ""Welcome to the Hellmouth"" and ""The Harvest"" was wonderfully illuminating, but I still felt like there should have been more behind-the-scenes stuff. The commentary felt rushed and really should have been included on a few more episodes (I'm thinking ""Prophecy Girl"" would have been a great episode to for more of his inside scoop.) Those extra interviews on ""Witch"", ""Never Kill a Boy on the First Date"", ""Angel"", and ""The Puppet Show"" were nice, but they were on the season one VHS pack that has been out for so long now. How many shows have writing as clever and as interesting as Buffy does? I really wanted to hear more from the people who are behind that.
That's not to say that I didn't like the DVD. Four stars is still a pretty good rating. The show itself is still fantastic (and only gets better as the seasons progress). If all of this had come with a full VHS set of season one, it would have gotten five. Unfortunately, DVD is a different medium with which so much more can be done, and I think there was much more that could have been done here. Hopefully, that will be taken into consideration before the season two set is released this summer.",1011830400,3,1708,4.3742138364779874

1379380,5,B00004YWJE,"I love this show (not just because my favorite Hollywood Hottie Sarah Michelle Gellar is in it) but because I've found that everyone can really identify with one of the characters, wether it be the butt-kicking heroine, or the nerdy-yet-comforting best friend...
But who am I kidding?  Vampires? Witches? Demons? YES!!  Finally a COOL monster show!  Consistently witty and always visually appealing (with good acting, by the way; the screams seem totally genuine...unlike in ""Urban Legends""...but I digress)
Now the only thing I can find wrong with the DVD is that the special features are few, and somewhat redundant.  Nevertheless, it's still cool.  Although some bloopers or outtakes would be nice...
Anyway, wether you've been a fan since the series premiere or have never seen one show, this is a DVD for you (well, three DVD's really) and I am proud to say it's in my collection.

1379381,4,B00004YWJE,"It's about time; with Buffy, the Vampire Slayer alreading in its 6th season, US fans have long been waiting for the release of earlier seasons on DVD. Finally our patience is rewarded.
This set contains all 12 episodes of the first season (it was a mid-season replacement and thus had only 12 episodes in its first season) plus interviews with Joss Whedon(creator) and David Boreanaz(actor who plays Angel), a photo gallery, original tv series trailer, and commentary by Joss Whedon on the first two episodes ""Welcome to the Hellmouth"" and ""The Harvest.""
The Episodes: Excellent-- Buffy, the Complete First season is a must for any Buffy fan or for any genre fan who has not watched the show before but wants to begin at the beginning. This original and amazingly literate series is not to be missed.
Extras: Good--The interviews with Joss Whedon and David Boreanaz are the same ones from the vhs packs previously released in the US. The original trailer is fun to see, and the photo gallery is fine, but mostly promo shots we've all seen before. The best feature is the commentary. Joss Whedon does a great job of interjecting interesting and amusing comments while reviewing the first two episodes. Commentary can be hilarious or dull depending on who's providing it. Joss Whedon manages to be both informative and silly at times providing a middle-ground that works quite well, especially given that this was his first crack at commentary.
Picture quality: Fair--The episodes were originally shot on 16mm. The lighting, art direction, and cinematography go along way to disguising this, but you can't escape the graininess at times.
Sound quality: Good--There's an occassional hiccup in the sound on a couple of episodes. That may be a manufacturing error or it might just be my copy.
Price: Excellent--Full seasons of tv shows on DVD can be horrifically pricy (e.g. The X-Files). At [the price]..., the Buffy complete first season is an amazing deal even with it's half season of only 12 episodes. The original VHS 3 packs (6 episodes) were priced the same. We'll just have to wait and see if they maintain their decent pricing structure when Season 2 (full 22 ep season) is released this summer.",1011744000,7,2200,4.932614555256064
1379382,4,B00004YWJE,"Before the television series began, I saw the Buffy movie starring Kristie Swanson and thought that while it wasn't a great movie, it had potential.  Little did I know what wonderful things Joss Whedon had planned.  Buffy the Vampire Slayer is the best show on television.  Having watched it since the first season, I have been constantly amazed at how he is able to outdo himself each season.  The writing is intelligent and creative, and the acting, especially Sarah Michelle Gellar's, is some of the finest anywhere.
I have the season already on videotape, but it is nice to be able to see and hear the episodes with the sharpness and clarity that only a digital recording can provide.  The other great thing about the DVD is the commentary by Joss Whedon.  Unfortunately, he only does commentary on the first two episodes.  As for the interviews, I was disappointed by their brevity.
When I buy a DVD, I like to have a lot of special features.  That's one of the major selling points of DVD versus VHS.  Here, we get director's commentary on 2 episodes, a few short interviews, trailers, the script from the pilot episode, bios, and a photo gallery.  While it seems like a lot, these are on the [low] end as far as DVD special features--really low on the coolness scale.  For future releases, I would like to see commentaries (by cast members as well as Joss Whedon) on more than 2 episodes, deleted scenes, outtakes, how they did special effects, and if they really want to be cool, easter eggs.  Also, does anyone else remember in the first season a slightly longer intro where a narrator describes incidents in the past when there have been mysterious deaths which stopped when certain young women arrived on the scene?  I would have liked to have seen that intro again.
Overall, I recommend this DVD because it's great seeing the first season in clear digital form.  The best special feature is the commentary on the first 2 episodes.  The rest of the special features aren't that special.",1011744000,11,1997,4.698275862068965

It's rare when the acting is this good, and the writing this polished on a first-year (and mid-season replacement, at that) series. The only complaints I have are extremely nitpicky, and in no way detract from the set: the episodes do look grainy in places (the fault of the film the show was shot on, I'm sure), and the cast bios are a bit dated (and laced with a few spoilers of events from Seasons 2 and 3).

Anyway...this DVD is a wonderful package. Most of the interviews are repeats from the earlier VHS release of select episodes. Joss Whedon's commentary is a kick to hear! Plus, I love how he credits his cast with why the show is such a success. In interviews and TV reviews people often say that  a show fails or succeeds based on the writing. Here, the writer turns his praise to his cast (and crew). Its quite refreshing.
Joss Whedon says how he has borrowed from various ""vampire myths"" to carve out the Buffy-verse. He has done so brilliantly.
Hopefully, when the next few seasons are released, you will see why many people feel he was robbed of an Emmy for such classic episodes as HUSH and THE BODY.",1011657600,,1020,4.368421052631579
1379387,5,B00004YWJE,"Oh, not the DVD - VAMPIRISM! The DVD is 5 stars because the series is 5 stars. I do wish there was a seperate field to rate extras though. Joss Whedon (the creator) did a wonderful job of audio commentary of the first two episodes. My complaint? It is not enough - would have loved more commentary.
Hey, Buffy fans are rabid! We cannot get enough background info on the creative process. For the less rabid they can just watch the episodes which are worth the purchase of the DVD all by their lonesome.
Buffy is a show that surprises you. It is not what the title implies. It is better than the average show on the air in that there is a layered detailed Buffyverse that is fascinating. Even in the midst of demons and almost always the possible end of the world as we know it the characters are likable and identifiable.
The first season, which is that this DVD is comprised of, shows that highschool can be just as traumatic as any vampire. We are introduced to Buffy, a tiny blonde that kicks butt but cannot tell this to her mother who thinks she is an irresponsible problem child. Willow, a red-headed computer whiz with a goofy vulnerability is her best friend. They are joined by Xander who is a hormone factory but a loyal friend. Rupert Giles is Buffy's Watcher - something like a personal trainer and mentor, but also the person that they ALL can turn to. It is a mostly unspoken truth that Giles is more of a father to Buffy than her rarely seen biological dad.
As a woman in her thirties there is much in the series to maintain my interest. The trials and tribulations of Buffy and Willow. The extreme, um, yumminess of Giles is made for women that like their men intelligent but with a hint of badboy beneath the surface. If you like your men badder and -er -badder there is Angel (A vampire with a sould - due to a curse) or Spike (although we do not meet him until season 2). This show rewards the loyal viewer by having seemingly throw away comments become important plot points later on. But it, watch it, love it, tell your friends!
So 5 stars for Buffy, Season One - and a wish sent out for more extras like more audio commentary when subsequent seasons come out.",1011571200,,2182,4.376847290640394

Most people probably wouldn't even notice it.  Also, Joss' commentaries for ""Welcome to the Hellmouth"" and ""The Harvest"" are not to be missed.  I only wish there were commentary for all of the episodes.  I can't recommend the DVD set highly enough for any Buffy fan(atic).  Can't wait for Season 2!",1011571200,,679,4.801724137931035

1379390,4,B00004YWJE,"..is because of the degradation you see during the dark/night parts of the show although this has nothing to do with the quality of the dvd transfer. As some had pointed out, this is due to the tight budget the initial runs of the show were done in that they didn't film in high quality film. So, you really don't get a ""remastered"" release as this was how the show was really seen during it's first season. And believe me, when I saw this way back then, I thought that was pretty weird myself. Anyways, for the parts of the dvd you do see during the daylight hours, it's all bright and crisp so they did take care in the dvd processing. The menu screen is somewhat lackluster and boring as you really have only four selectable title options initially. The extras and stuff are shown when you decided to view a story title. Even then, you are only basically treated to a few interviews and commentaries with maybe a few bios thrown in. Definitely somewhat of a ""standard basic"" options selection in today's dvd world. The DVD set is a three disc set with only ""12"" full episodes and not the 24 that's stated on the sticker since the show was run halfway thru midseason and wasn't really expected to gather such a strong collowing. I'm glad it did as Buffy, and now Angel, are full of quick wit one liners and action that it's always a joy to watch their shows. The one complaint I hear from newer viewers is that they don't get some of the in jokes and become frustrated with the show as Buffy always tends to allude to past events that current viewers might get a bit lost. Well, here's your chance to catch up as the first season is now officially on dvd, and the very, very affordable price of $... for 12 shows!!! That's a bargain if I ever saw one. And you new viewers will finally get to see Darla and Cordelia way back when before their appearance on ""Angel."" We'll also get to see the younger Xander and Willow before they grew up into the characters they are now. You'll finally get to understand all the cheerleader/witch in jokes that pops up form time to time. You'll see Buffy's mom and grow to watch her and like her and understand how fans felt after what happened last season. Definitely pick this set up.",1011484800,,2221,4.380145278450363
1379391,5,B00004YWJE,"On March 3rd, 1997, the WB network introduced a series that today still defines quality TV. Its mix of comedy, action and drama have rarely been matched, even today.  Now, finally, after years of waiting, American audiences can collect the stellar series, BUFFY THE VAMPIRE SLAYER, from the very beginning.  This show chronicles the adventures of young Buffy Summers, a high school student who is revealed as the Chosen One destined to fight the demons and vampires that plague the world. Since this was a mid-season replacement, there were only 12 episodes in this 1st season.  As always, Sarah Michelle Geller is at the top of her game in the title role, while Anthony Stewart Head is full of wry humor as Rupert Giles, her Watcher.
The episodes, despite being filmed in 16mm, are sharp in both visual and sound quality.  However, the special features are a little lacking.  There's an insighful and amusing commentary by show creator, Joss Whedon, which covers the 2 part pilot for the show.  However, the Whedon interview sections only covers only half of the episodes, being a hold-over from the old 3-pack VHS set.  Also, the interview with David Boreanez (Angel) doesn't offer anything new.  Some outtakes and making of featurettes would've been nice.  Hopefully, future season sets will correct this flaw.
However, the thing is the show and these episodes are classic and fun.  I would highly recommend this to any Buffy fan or someone who cares about quality TV.",1011484800,4,1471,4.919028340080971
1379392,5,B00004YWJE,"I guess the idea is that if we waited this long for the complete first season of Buffy to appear on DVD we would not mind that the extras are extremely limited: Joss Whedon's commentary on the pilot episode(s) is the biggest treat and proves that the man simply knows what he is doing with this show to the depths of his soul.  It would be impractical for him to do the same for all 12 episodes, but we have to hope he does the same for ""Becoming"" when that comes out in June (supposedly; fortunately the undead can hold their breaths a long, long time).  Other than that, there are some brief interview clips with Joss and David Boreanaz (sporting a wee bit of facial hair) and a promotional trailer.  The cast did more stuff talking about Buffy for the syndication run on FX.  Go figure.  However, if you have been waiting for the opportunity to hear Buffy in French, your time has come.",1011398400,,889,4.363636363636363

1379394,5,B00004YWJE,"Fans of Buffy don't need to read reviews to know how amazing the series is - for the rest of you, read on...
Buffy the Vampire Slayer is one of very few bright spots on the television landscape.  While the title may sound like that of a teen trifle like Dawson's Creek, you owe it to yourself to take a closer look.  The writing and acting are top notch.  The performances are layered and nuanced, and no other series can match Buffy for it's sharp turns from drama to comedy to horror and back again.  Listen closely, and you'll be rewarded with many laughs at the sly, subtle pop culture references and asides that make their way into the rich dialog.
Most importantly, Buffy is about life - specifically, adolescence - and the difficulties we all face or are facing.  Buffy constantly has to deal with the fact that she doesn't fit in and no one understands her (after all she has super powers and fights vampires and demons after school).  Her feelings and issues are EXACTLY those of most teenages, the genius of Joss Whedon's series is that we get to see things from Buffy's point of view.  When Buffy prepares to go out to stop an evil apocalypse, her mother grounds her and says ""I know when you're a teenager you feel like the world's going to end if you don't go out...""  The viewer gets to empathize with the teenager's plight - The world really IS going to end if she doesn't go out!  This type of multi-layered meaning is what makes Buffy a MUST SEE for those who appreciate intelligent entertainment.
Finally, Buffy is a great role model for today's teenage girls.  Forget the cute blond victim seen in traditional horror movies - Buffy is smart, strong, sexy, and she kicks ...!
This DVD version is a great starting point for the new Buffy viewer - just be prepared, it only gets better in later seasons!",1011312000,,1819,4.484848484848484
1379395,5,B00004YWJE,"Buffy the Vampire Slayer is one of the most reflective pieces of modern life that have ever been created.  Meaning, it's like real life, but more entertaining.  Teenage angst takes on a whole new meaning in this show.  Joss Whedons' stories about a little blonde cheerleader who is suddenly given the responsibility of saving the world day in and day out are exciting, action packed, touching, emotional and surprisingly close to real life on many levels.  Dealing with teenage angst is tough for all young people, the fact that Buffy is given the added pressure of fighting Vampires and demons puts her regular high school life in perspective.  She realizes she would give anything to be just a good student, a cheerleader and have social time at the mall and the local club.  But nothing comes that easy.  Life gives us responsibilities and Whedon seems to know this without question.  He throws everything he can at our tough little heroine and she seems to take it all in stride, sometimes not as gracefully as others.  Along the way she finds friends in unlikely students, geeks.  Where in the movie, which afterward is where the TV Show picks up, she would never have socialized with these kind of people, she finds herself gaining solace in their normality and more honest personalities.  BTVS cannot be described by in a short sentence or two.  The characters, story arcs, themes and even the villains have long term affects.  The individual stories stand alone, but as a whole, the show ties itself together in several ways.  This DVD is worth the money for the shows alone, the extra features only make it that much more exceptional.",1011312000,,1643,4.800711743772242
1379396,5,B00004YWJE,The best show over the past 7 years has been Buffy The Vampire Slayer by far.  Most people who haven't seen the show do not understand the obsession of so many great fans who sit at home every Tuesday night and religiously watch the smartest show on television.  This season one set is a must have for any fan.  I can't wait for future seasons because there are so many great episodes that deserve the same release.,1011225600,,415,4.363636363636363
1379397,4,B00004YWJE,"In 1997 ""Buffy the Vampire Slayer"" took television by storm, or so I'm told. In truth I never watched a single episode on tv in the 5 years it has been aired. I thought it looked like a campy, teeny bopper ""Scooby Doo"" show which I, mistakenly, predicted would have a short shelf life.

Visiting family at Christmas 2001, I was told by my 40 year old brother that ""Buffy"" was the show to watch. He loves it and told me that I was missing out by not giving the series a chance. So in deference to him, I bought ""The Complete First Season"" the day after it was released and I have seen the light!
The show is campy in some places, but the writing is superb and the show's producers and writers aren't afraid to take chances. Each episode continued to suprise me as people were killed who appeared to be written into the show for the duration. Each episode also has genuinely funny moments with some highbrow humor that I wouldn't necessarily attribute to high school students but somehow comes off so much better than ""Dawson's Creek"" dialogue.
My one complaint about the DVD of the First Season is that it is sorely lacking in Special Features. Some interviews with the show's cast would be greatly appreciated as well as more in-depth commentary on each episode from Joss Wheadon.
Overall, I LOVE Buffy and can't wait until Season 2 comes out in June.",1011225600,,1351,4.491869918699187

  The show for the most part was alot deeper than I ever thought. It also has the ability to take us in one direction and just when you think it is totally predictable, the story takes a twist.
  There was only a couple of episodes I wasn't keen on. But even they had some redeeming quality. Buffy shows some very intense emotions at times. Especially in the season finally. Giles is amazing and for me the most interesting character.
  My only serious complaint is with Angel. He seems to turn up drop messages and disappear. That isn't so bad except some of the things he could easily taken care of himself. I think they were unsure what to do with him. If he does too much it takes away from Buffy. But really they could have done more.
  All said and done it is an excellent price and a good buy. If you were thinking about watching the show then BUY IT and don't watch any commercials.",1011052800,2,1137,4.207373271889401
1379403,5,B00004YWJE,"What can I say? I'm a hooked Buffy fan and have been since seeing the first season on FX last year. Before that, I was of the unfortunates that apparently lived in the Hellmouth and never wanted to see the light.
True, the movie was not that great, but the series itself is excellent. What I thought would be a sappy, idiotic series for teenagers has turned out to be a very excellent drama that explores the pain of growing up, from highschool (seasons 1-3), college (season 4 and 5) and beyond (season 6). Even though it might seem to be tuned towards the teenager/high school generation, I find myself at age 35 enjoying this. In fact, there are at least 5 other people where I work that watch the show regularly and are about the same age as I. This show is definitely good for adults. Better than some of the other stuff out there.
Life, death, love, are all explored. Every character of the Scooby Gang has flaws, but there are so many qualities that outshine those flaws, they're all loveable. And, no matter what, love and friendship wins in the end as they work together to battle the evil that spawns itself in Sunnydale, CA.
The first season is well done and with the first episode, you already learn about the main characters very quickly, however you're only given so much so as to whet your appetite to learn more as the season goes on.
The humor is placed at the right moments, and so many sayings just make you break out in laughter, easing the tension that builds as you watch the shows.
The DVD is an excellent edition to start your Buffy collection. However, I'm now anxiously awaiting season 2, which is supposedly due out June 2002 on 6 DVDs (more episodes in the rest of the seasons - season one had only 12).
There are interview clips with the creator, Josh Wheton and to learn about Mutant Enemy productions and the ""GRR ARGH"" monster is some neat trivia.
Get it! You won't be disappointed. Now, I'm impatiently waiting for seasons 2 through 6!",1011052800,,1968,4.484679665738161

She is one of the best young actresses on tv today. Other cast members include the incredibly witchy Charisma Carpenter as Cordelia. Never has anyone been better at throwing one line insults as her. Alyson Hanigan is perfect as Willow, charming, innocent, and sweet, and its amazing to see Willow then compared to now, and see what a wondeful journey her character has gone through. Its all because of Alysons brilliant acting. Anthony Stewart Head is excellent as Giles, Buffys Watcher, and Nicholas Benden as Xander provides the show with its comic relief. David Boreanaz is perferctly mysterious as Angel, and his scenes with Buffy are very intense. Once again this is a superior show that only gets better and better.",1011052800,2,998,5.018072289156627

There are a lot of DVD video artifacts: grainy picture, slightly posterized color, ghosted and haloed objects, indistinct dark scenes, and jittery image detail.
And as if poor encoding wasn't enough, one of the discs was physically defective!  It locked up in two different players, and upon visual inspection, it looked as though the layers of the disc were improperly bonded.

However, a word needs to be said about the picture quality of the Region 2 and Region 4 dvds (which are absolutely identical). I'd venture to say that the Region 1 dvds will be the same since the extras are all identical to the above mentioned dvds.
Buyers should be aware that the picture is relatively ""grainy"". This is due to the fact that the first 2 or 3 seasons were shot on really tight budgets using 16mm film (if I remember correctly). They are also very, very dark.

1379412,5,B00004YWJE,"If space is Star Trek's final frontier, Man's fear within himself and of the physical and metaphysical worlds that surround him is Buffy The Vampire Slayer's (BtVS's). As nothing will ever match the genius of ""Star Trek"" or ""The Twilight Zone"", no copycat will come close to the originality and genius of BtVS, either.
Television most often fails to capture the significance of the very first opening scene. BtVS is a noted exception with a striking start that set into motion the events to come; Darla and her date breaking into the school followed by Buffy's dream of the Hellmouth. Not knowing who was in grave danger - Darla, her date or both - told a lot about what to expect in Sunnydale. And from the onset, we recognize that the Chosen One is a reluctant but determined and no ordinary slayer. Under her invincible powers lie insecurity, fragility and vulnerability. Behind the smile and wit there are scars and a noticeable touch of sadness. Behind the beauty, there is a sense of inferiority. A dedicated slayer resigned to her fate, yet resentful that she is deprived of being a normal teenager. Defiant of authority - ""And you will be stopping me, how?"" - but she carries out her assignments even if they might lead to her death. Ms Gellar understood extraordinarily well the depth of Buffy's psyche, captured those contradictions and reflected them in a most captivating manner with her eyes, facial expression, body language and tone of voice. The - very well developed - characters were introduced in a manner that gave the viewer immediate insight into their chemistry, a mix of clashing but caring personalities. They all blended splendidly in this unusual tale. And of course there is that mysterious and dashing Angel. No wonder audiences all over the world were hooked instantly and a truly global cult was born!
""Buffy The Vampire Slayer"" has told many tales. The most bewitching is that of ""Beauty and the Beast"". To some viewers - for certain - fighting the undead and the demons is only secondary to the haunting tribulations of the love of a vampire to a mortal slayer. -""A vampire in love with a slayer; how poetic!"" Ever present is the electrifying tension that are evident each time Buffy and Angel meet. A love story that is unparalleled in the history of romance on television!
Buffy and Angel are this generation's - and for future generations to come - all-American heroes, the new icons! Angel bears an uncanny resemblance to Batman. But unlike other heroes, Superman, Wonder Woman and Batman, Buffy is colorful and funny. In portraying Buffy, Ms Gellar has left a non-erasable mark on the character; it will take many years before another actor can effectively play Buffy TheVampire Slayer.
Looking back at BtVS's first season, three words come to mind: tantalizing, magical and charming!",1010188800,,2822,4.88125

I haven't seen this DVD version yet, so I don't know how well put together the DVD is, but the series should appeal to people of all ages - if they can get past the need to willingly suspend their disbelief about the existence of a 16 year old vampire slayer who saves the world, deals with school and mom problems and still manages to look pretty and fashionable.",1009411200,,656,4.458333333333333

1379417,5,B00004YWJE,"When 'Buffy The Vampire Slayer' was first launched it's pretty certain to say that there were a few people out there that scoffed at its name and dismissed it as a stupid teen fantasy.  But when you watch this first series you see just how fresh and original this series is.  In it there's the feisty yet vulnerable Buffy Summers who fights both her emotional and more literal demons.  She's joined by best friends Willow and Xander, the very bottom of the school's social spectrum.  Along for the ride is spoilt popular Cordelia and the dark and mysterious Angel.
The first series is a great deal lighter than the later series (particularly the dark Series Five), with a more gothic feel to it - such as the clan of vampires that live in a cave under Sunnydale.  It's nice to see a show that deals with teenage life with such a mature approach without patronising its audience.  Also original is the fact that our heroine and her friends are the least popular people in school.  Plus it's strange to see all those old faces again, with their characters having changed so dramatically (but also realistically), especially a shy Willow whose clothes were picked out by her mom.  Also interesting is the introduction of characters originally intended for merely one episode that were eventually to be integrated fully into the show, such as Angel, Darla and Harmony.
But whilst always delivering a witty quip or a hilarious situation, there's the upsetting and traumatising events of adolescense displayed on our screen.  Particularly heart-rending is Buffy's discovery that she is prophecised to die in the final episode of Season One, 'Prophecy Girl'.  By exaggerating such traumas, the show has managed to bring to the forefront how each small knock can have much larger consequences when young, how everything seems worse than it really is.  Take, 'Out Of Mind, Out Of Sight', in which one girl that is unnoticed by her supposed friends turns invisible.
This is a winning TV series that not only satisfies its younger audience but is also aimed at adults.  People who scoff at fantasy programmes purely for their genre look out, 'Buffy' has proved that it is here to stay.  Indeed, this was only the beginning of an increasingly innovative show that was to garner critic and audience support.",1009065600,6,2294,4.851282051282051
1379418,5,B00004YWJE,"Now that I just got a brand new DVD player, I can finally start buying DVDs instead of those ... boring, old videos! And when BUFFY, THE VAMPIRE SLAYER: THE COMPLETE FIRST SEASON comes out, it will be a great DVD to jump-start my collection. I really love the TV show, but I've always thought season #1 was the best season the show had, and it's not just because season #1 had all the original characters, but also because season #1 is a TV classic! My favorite show is actually ""7th Heaven"", but I love ""Buffy"" almost as much!
Anyway, I am so excited about this DVD set. For those who've never seen ""Buffy"" and don't know what the show is about, well...it's about this teen girl named Buffy (Sarah Michelle Gellar), who moves to a town called Sunnydale in California, and is the Chosen One, or the one to fight off all that is evil, basically vampires. She's a vampire slayer, of course. So all throughout the show, she spends her time fighting off the evil blood-sucking vampires while trying to fit in with the rest of her high school peers. Finally! We get a female heroine on TV. ""Buffy"" is better than ""Xena: Warrior Princess"". Buffy kicks butt! Standing beside Buffy are her two best friends Xander (Nicholas Brendan), and Willow (Alyson Hannigan).
I still enjoy the new episodes of ""Buffy, the Vampire Slayer"", except the only problem is, is that I hardly ever watch the show anymore. All the actors who've worked on this show are excellent and talented, and the scripts are amazing! The special effects are pretty cool, too. It seems as though all the actors and crew are dedicated to this show, which makes you even want to watch it more because they are so loyal and talented.

I myself graduated high school the same year as Buffy in 99 so this brings me a lot of fond memories ( and some not so fond )so in early 97 she was a sophomore  like me which truly is the most painful and confusing time of high school  .How many of us remember thinking in the 1st season I bet Willow and Xander will hook up sometime in the 2nd or 3rd season , sorta wrong there. Remember when you thought you couldn't trust Angel and he would eventually be Buffy's downfall. Anyone remember in the great Cibo Matto performance thinking can great indy bands finally take over mainstream radio ,this was a very sweet innocent time when we all thought great music had a decent shot at mainstream .I know among the truly biggest Buffy fan's there will always be debates over when the show was at it's best be it right now the early year's or anytime inbetween. The truth is it doesn't matter .This great show means different thing's to different people . I suppose if i was a few years older or a few years younger maybe i would like the newer episodes better. The truly exciting thing is a show this unique and original would have lasted about 12 weeks on the air if it even made the air 20 years ago .Thanks to cable tv, minor networks, (upn wb) and DVD a great show like this can reach the entire world . I know myself i will gladly take the stroll down memory lane and purchase this dvd upon it's release  . God Bless Joss Whedon and God Bless America",1006560000,6,1638,4.207006369426751
1379422,5,B00004YWJE,"I will always hold a fond place in my heart for the first season of ""Buffy the Vampire Slayer."" This season is truly a peek at a show on the verge of greatness. All the ingredients are there, and they're all good. Further, this season can only not be classified as a masterpiece in retrospect. We know now what great things are to come in all the other seasons (the second all the way through to the sixth, the present season), so this season cannot help but pale in comparison.
But, taken by itself, this is really a wonderful beginning. Not many shows can boast a perfect first episode. And yet this show can. Everything just cliked perfectly from the start: the characters, the mythology, the feel of the show. The only major flaw in the early episodes were weak guest stars. While the main cast (Sarah Michelle Gellar, Allyson Hannigan, Nicholas Brendon, Anthony Stewart Hall, and Charisma Carpenter) are all achingly perfect, most of the guest stars (with the exception of Kristine Sutherland, Robia LaMorte and Armin Shimmerman) were rather mediocre. By the second season, just about everyone on every ""Buffy"" episode was great.
But let's break it down episode by episode:
""Welcome to the Hellmouth/The Harvest""--What more can I say but that this is a perfect first episode? It lets us in on the mythology of the series, but does not give us to much at once. Further, all of the main characters are explored, and it is clear from the beginning that this is an ensemble piece--all of them are important. Sets up the year's major story arc with the Master.
""The Witch""--While some have called this a weak episode, I like it a great deal. It shows us that Buffy not only slays vampires, and that there is more to the show than that. Also, we see Buffy in a weakened state, with her friends having to help her. With Amy we also see the beginning of a witchcraft theme that will be further explored in later seasons.
""Teacher's Pet""--Another episode that many have called weak, but I think is very enjoyable. Xander gets to be the focus of an episode, and we get to see the first in his line of increasingly bad choices in women (until Cordy next year). No, this is not the best episode, but it's involving and funny.
""Never Kill A Boy on the First Date""--The first story-arc episode since the premiere, this is an extremely entertaining episode, where we get to see Buffy try to juggle being the Slayer and having a normal dating life. Also, of course, we see the first signs of the Anointed One.
""Angel""--Arguably the most important ""mythology"" episode of the first season, not only do we learn great secrets, but they are ones that will have an enormous effect on the series, particularly in the second season.
""I Robot, You Jane""--In my opinion, this is the first season's real clunker of an episode. The monster is, quite frankly, silly and not very believable, making the story quite lightweight. On the positive side, the dialogue is fresh and witty, as usual, and we finally get to see Willow spotlighted in an episode. Jenny Calendar is also given more of an introduction. She will also be important in the second season.
""The Puppet Show""--A true masterpiece, by first season standards, this episode manages to be both funny and creepy. It is the best of the first season's stand-alones. We start to see just how much of a ""Nazi"" Principal Snyder is, and the coda scene during the credits is one of the funniest moments in BtVS history.
""The Pack""--An excellent episode that really breaks down the idea of a group of bullies acting like a pack of animals. Only here, it is literally. Xander goes a little bad, and all hell ensues.
""Nightmares""--This episode is pure artistry at its best. It is darker than most of the other eps this season, and also brilliant in how it shows that most realistic nightmares are not the monsters Buffy faces every week, but the doubts, concerns, and worries of every teenager, such as a father telling his daughter he doesn't love her, entering a classroom naked, etc. Buffy's fear of being buried alive is an amazing foreshadowing of the sixth season.
""Out of Mind, Out of Sight""--We get to learn more about Cordy, and, even, *gasp!* possibly like her a little in this episode. It is an interesting concept, well carried-out. And the final scene is one of the creepiest of the first season.
""Prophecy Girl""--The best episode of the season, and also the season finale. It is the first first season episode to transcend the first season. It has the quality of a second season episode, which is saying a great deal, since the second season is pure genius.
So, to sum up...Buy this set. It is required viewing for Buffy newbies and fans alike. No, it is not the best season. It is only the beginning. But what a wonderful beginning it is...",1006214400,30,4780,4.65130023640662
1379423,5,B00004YWJE,"Despite what the Emmy voters think, ""Buffy"" is consistently one of the most creative, best written, and best performed shows on television.  Although the first season has some miscues that are typical of any freshman show (e.g. the somewhat unsatisfying ""Teacher's Pet"" and ""The Pack""), it still leaps and bounds above the expectations that we are conditioned to expect from ordinary television.  Five seasons later, it's still going strong.  There aren't many shows that maintain a consistently high level of creativity and quality for six seasons, but ""Buffy"" manages it with style.  I look forward to releases of future seasons.",1006041600,13,631,5.28
1379434,5,B00004YWJE,"Finally, the complete first season of Buffy the Vampire Slayer is available on DVD (rather than the boxed set previously available that contained only half of the episodes). While a little uneven in quality compared to later, more polished seasons, the series' trademark wit and pathos are in fine form in this set.
The set begins with the two-part series premiere, ""Welcome to the Hellmouth"" and ""The Harvest."" These episodes introduce Buffy, a sophomore in high school and the Slayer chosen to fight the forces of darkness; Willow, the shy technology-savvy redhead; Xander, the goofy regular guy who happens to have a serious crush on the Buffster; Cordelia, the shallow queen always ready with an acerbic comment; and Giles, the staid school librarian and Buffy's watcher. Some important secondary characters are also introduced, like Angel, Buffy's future boyfriend, and Darla, Angel's vampiric ex-flame. The storyline involves the plans of the Master, a vampire, to escape his prison and wreak havoc at the same time that Buffy has just transferred to a new school (after being kicked out of her old one for burning down the gym). Naturally, she and her friends avert the catastrophe.
""The Witch"" is a great episode, looking at both mother/daughter relationships and being pressured by parents to succeed. When the cheerleading squad meets various mystical ""accidents,"" one-by-one, Buffy has to investigate. The trail apparently leads to Amy Madison, a gawky girl turned second-string cheerleader. She's moving up the ranks as her competitors go down... One of the best episodes in the set.
""Teacher's Pet"" features Xander, as he and all the other guys go gaga for a new substitute teacher. But Buffy's suspicious when she sees the teacher do a head-twist, Exorcist-style. Unfortunately, Xander's already in her trap...
""Never Kill a Boy on the First Date"" is a more humorous episode. Buffy tries to have a social life, but those pesky slaying commitments keep getting in the way. She finally ends up dragging her date to the funeral home when they find that an ancient prophecy is coming to pass...
In ""Angel,"" the mysterious Angel's secret is revealed: he's a vampire! (As if it were a surprise to anyone.) But when Buffy thinks he's fed on her mother, she has to make a decision: can she bring herself to kill him?
The spotlight's on Willow in ""I Robot, You Jane."" When introspective Will starts an online romance, Buffy's a little worried. But when it turns out that there's a demon in the Internet - and that he's Willow's ""boyfriend"" - things get particularly hairy. This episode introduces computer teacher and technopagan Jenny Calendar, Giles' sometimes girlfriend and a pivotal character in Season Two.
""The Puppet Show"" is the series' token creepy-ventriloquist's-dummy episode. Giles has been drafted for the school talent show, but several of the participants have turned up rather dead. Buffy suspects one of the stranger kids' ventriloquist dummy is behind the deaths. Though this episode is not the strongest of the season, an enjoyable and unexpected twist makes it still eminently watchable.
In ""The Pack,"" Xander's started to act funny - snarling at his friends and hanging out with the bullies. It all started when he entered the hyena cage at the zoo. But can Buffy figure it out before things get out of hand and somebody gets...well, eaten?
""Nightmares"" brings everyone's worst nightmares to life. Buffy's father tells her he doesn't love her, while bookworm Giles forgets how to read. The Master seizes the opportunity to try to make a break for the outside world, and nearly succeeds. Worth it if for nothing but Cordelia's bad hair day.
In ""Out of Mind, Out of Sight,"" an invisible girl is terrorizing Cordelia and her associates. She comes to Buffy for help, and Buffy gives it (albeit very reluctantly). But when the attacks coincide with the crowning of Cordelia as the new May Queen, problems arise - big surprise.
The set ends on a high note with ""Prophecy Girl."" Giles finds a prophecy that predicts Buffy's death at the hands of the Master. It deals very clearly with Buffy's bleak realization of her own mortality, and ends with a showstopping showdown between Buffy and the Master. Quite possibly the best episode in this set.
I can't recommend this boxed set highly enough. Extras, like interviews with Joss Whedon (the creator) and David Boreanaz (Angel) round out the set. A worthwhile purchase both for Buffy fans and those wanting to see what the fuss is all about.",1005609600,63,4510,5.006657789613848
1379435,5,B00004YWJE,"Picking up just a few months after the movie left off, (which starred Kristy Swanson), season one evolved around the appearance of many of the now key characters of this series.
The first was Buffy Summers, who in the series is played by Sarah Michelle Gellar, who is far superior as Buffy than Krusty. She begins as being resentful as being ""The Chosen One"", and thought her vampire slaying days were at an end. A stroke of fate placed her directly on the Hellmouth when she switched schools, forcing her to again slay all of those nasties.
The second is the dark, mysterious and brooding ""vampire with a soul"" apropriately named as Angel aka Angelus. He is portrayed by David Borandaz, who can ignite his character with both charm and terror sometimes at the same time.
Next up is Ruport Gyles, (Anthony Stewart Head) on the outside a Clark Kentish mild mannered, occasionally dim-witted libriarian. But in reality he is Buffy's watcher, who at times has a strength (both outer and inner) which he may not realize he has. Not to forget her two best friends, Willow and Xander (Alyson Hannagan and Nicholas Brandon), they both have their strengths, Willow her computer wizardry and Xander his . . . um well, he's just one of the girls [as Buffy so aptly points out in one of the episodes in this set].
We can't forget Cordellia Chase (Charisma Carpenter), while she fancies herself as the self-imposed queen of the school, and a nemisis of Buffy, when push comes to shove, she finds herself standing alongside Buffy fighting the demons (when she herself isn't being held captive by one that is).
Finally the seasonal characters, in this season it's the Master (Mark Metcalf). Everything that a Vampire is, is in him, thought to be one of the last ""true"" vampires, he rises from his sub-terrianian grave ready to be released from his sub-terrianian prison, waiting to kill the only thing that stands in his way . . . the Slayer.
On this three disk set are all 12 of the 1st season episodes:

1379436,5,B00004YWJE,"Jesus H!  It's about time they made this available in the US!  BTVS is the best written/acted/directed show I've ever watched.  It's got humor, action, suspense, and romance.  Tying all these elements together is the best writing since Mash.  Sarah Michelle Gellar is perfect as Buffy (she of movie semi-success, hopefully with her talent and looks, Sarah will blossom into a major movie star).  The first 3 seasons were the strongest.  I think the plots and overall feel of the shows have gotten weaker in seasons 4 and 5, but even these shows kill 95% of what's on television now.
I'm a married high school teacher in my late 20's, and every year, I meet numerous students who love the show.  My wife never watched the show until I converted her, and several of my friends and co-workers are now part of the Buffy faithful.

1379437,5,B00004YWJE,"That is the only way to describe the ongoing saga of ""Buffy the Vampire Slayer"". While the movie was an amusing way to spend an empty afternoon, the series is a masterpiece of the melding of sci-fi/horror and mainstream drama. I did not expect very much from the series, after all the film was a little bit on the ""fluff"" side, but was instantly surprised and pleased at the innovative workings of Whedon's mind. Though targeted for a younger audience(I'm in my 30's) the show instantly mesmerised me. The effects alone make this a must have for your DVD collection, but the ever evolving storyline is another treasure entirely. The characters are well built and developed, and easily identified with, and the plot line always seems within the ealm of reason. Sort of.

1379441,5,B00004YWJE,"Surely the legions of fans of the ""Buffy the Vampire Slayer"" television series appreciate the irony that now that the show is in syndication, the First Season (1997) is finally coming out on DVD.  This still puts us behind the fans in Europe who can already get last season on video tape, but we will try to be patient, hard as that might be (But it was still a big mistake NOT to include ""Prophecy Girl"" in the first set of videotapes).  Now that ""BtVS"" is into its Sixth Season and the Slayer is on her third life, this might be a good time to re-evaluate that first season.  I therefore offer the following points for contemplation:
(1) The most important factor that gives the television series more depth than the movie is clearly the character of Angel (David Boreanaz), although the creation of the Scooby Gang is huge as well.  But even more impressive than the fact that a vampire with a soul is in love with the Slayer is the fact that Joss Whedon holds off on this revelation until the seventh episode (""Angel"").  For the first six episodes Angel was Mystery Guy, Stealth Guy, Cryptic Guy, and then in the first truly memorable moment of the series, Buffy learns the truth as Angel's face morphs in her bedroom.  Creating these star-crossed lovers is where this television series start an operatic story arc that culminates in ""Becoming: Part II,"" the show's zenith.  (2) Related to this is the Master (Mark Metcalf) story arc that defines the first season.  Each subsequent season of Buffy has similarly been defined by a pair of story arcs, usually dividing the season in half: Season 2 starts with Spike & Dru and then Angelus takes over in the second half.  Of course, this helps set up the thrilling season finales each year as the Master/Angelus/Mayor/Adam/Glory meets their fate.  But it also means that throughout the season things are brewing and building.  In other words, the order of the episodes matters.
(3) As Joss Whedon has often told us, the subtext of ""BtVS"" is that High School is Hell.  I was surprised that over half the episodes from the First Season dealt primarily with the horrors of going to high school, as opposed to expanding the Buffy mythos.  Living up to the unreasonable expectations of parents (""Witch""), having a crush on a teacher (""Teacher's Pet""), school cliques (""The Pack""), meeting someone on the internet (""I Robot, You Jane""), facing your worst fears (""Nightmares""), being ignored by everybody (""Out of Mind, Out of Sight""), and even just trying to go out on a date (""Never Kill a Boy On the First Date"") are dealt with in Season One.  (4) The final obvious strength of the show would be the characters and the actors playing them.  Willow (Allyson Hannigan) might by the all-time best Best Friend, and watching the character grow over the years has been fascinating.  Poking fun at the pomposity of Giles (Anthony Stewart Head) never grows old, but I have to admit that I think Xander (Nicholas Brendon) is the [punch line] of way too many jokes.  Then again, one of the show's masterstrokes is that Cordelia (Charisma Carpenter), who represents everything about high school that the others hate, gets dragged into being a member of the gang.  It is also clear in retrospect that Joss Whedon's knows how to use the characters and acting talent he stumbles across.  Elizabeth Anne Allen (Amy Madison), Robia LaMorte (Jenny Calendar), and Mercedes McNab (Harmony) are all introduced in first season episodes and brought back for even greater fun in future episodes.
Watching the first season episodes of ""Buffy the Vampire Slayer"" makes it clear that the show certainly started strong.  Yes, there are some efforts that could be a lot better: my groaner is ""Teacher's Pet"" although others have problems with ""Witch,"" ""I Robot, You Jane"" and ""Out of Mind, Out of Sight.""  But all of those episodes suffer in part because they are the farthest removed from the core of the Buffy mythos.  But the ""Welcome to the Hellmouth/The Harvest"" pilot, ""The Pack,"" ""Angel"" and ""Prophecy Girl"" are first-rate efforts, and that's a third of the initial season right there.  However, as soon as you watch ""When She Was Bad,"" the first episode from Season Two, it is clear that the show had gotten a LOT better.  So I would really give Season One 4.5 stars, which rounds up on the strength of Sarah Michelle Gellar's performance and especially her ""I don't want to die"" speech in ""Prophecy Girl.""  Killing Buffy only makes her stronger.",1003017600,74,4473,4.770428015564202
1379442,5,B00004YWJE,"For any fan of ""Buffy,"" this box set is absolutely essential. For any one who has never seen ""Buffy,"" it is essential as well. What better place to start than the beginning of the story? True, the show is still starting out here, so it is not yet the perfect, amazing brilliant piece of art we see every week, but it is still very, very good. It is amazing how well the characters were written, from the beginning. In some shows, it takes a few episodes or even years for the writers and actors to find the right tone for their characters. Not so with ""Buffy."" From the very first episode, everything falls into place perfectly, and the character interaction is realistic and wonderful. It is also amazing how well the episodes hold up continuity-wise. One would expect that a show that has been on 6 years, whose writers were creating the mythology as they went along, might have stumbled here or there...but no. I was only able to find one continuity error. When Angel meets Buffy in the first episode, ""Welcome to the Hellmouth,"" he tells her that he thought she'd be taller. In a later episode, ""Amends,"" in the third season, we learn that Angel had seen Buffy from afar in L.A. the year before, so he already knew how tall she was. And that is the only slip I was able to find. In fact, the episodes from the first season are even better if you go back to them after watching the other seasons. In ""Nightmares,"" we learn that one of Buffy's biggest nightmares is being buried alive...And in ""Bargaining,"" that is exactly what happens to her. I could go on and on about the extremely complex, brilliant mythology of the show, the great writing, the amazing acting, and the excellent production values and directing. But why not do yourself a favor, stop reading this review, and order the darn thing already! You'll be glad you did. For Joss Whedon did the amazing task of not only creating a successful show with a silly name like ""Buffy the Vampire Slayer,"" but also making it the most intelligent show on TV today, and, arguably, ever.",1003017600,21,2042,4.551630434782608

I am amazed that we in the UK have got the first two series on DVD already with series 3 of Buffy and series 1 of angel coming out at the end of october.  Usually we get everything after the US and Japan, but hey I aint complaining unless you guys get more extras that is.
Anyway series one is not the best in my opinion but it is still great and with the extras and the great interface you get with the DVD it really is a must for Buffy fans.  In fact I would suggest that if you don't yet have a DVD player then buy one so you can get the extras on these DVDs alone.
And if you think this DVD is good you wait for season 2, it is even better except for the packaging which although it includes glossy inbuilt pages of information, still seems a little cheap in my opinion and has little pockets where you slip the dvds into.

But despite the fact season one only consists of twelve episodes, they pack as much power as any debut season of any show on television.  Throughout the first season, we are introduced to all the major players in addition to Buffy including Xander, Willow, Giles and Angel.  Angel starts off as a minor character, but as the season progresses he and Buffy become more involved and his role elevates.  Season one continuing plot revolves around The Master who is the supreme vampire.  He is trapped in the Hellmouth and throughout the season chronicles his attempt to be freed.  Even though the main focus is on fighting vampires, other demons arise.  One particularly strong episode is where Xander and several other students are possessed with the spirits of hyenas.  They develop the attributes of hyenas including the pack mentality.  This episode really shows the brilliance of Joss Whedon as the hyenas are a metaphor for the clique and pack mentality of high school and how the strong packs pick on the weaker ones.

released on dvd.
I can not say enough great things about this series.
The acting is above and beyond what you would expect from normal
t.v. actors. Why in the world this show has not gotten more Emmy's I have no idea.
The entire cast is nothing short of amazing.
While the dvd is every Buffy fans dream,I feel it could have been more. The actual orignal pilot would have been a welcome extra.
And some outtake footage would have been nice.
I myself have seen both the orignal pilot and several hours of outtakes from several eps,and while the footage is not needed.
It is interesting to see.
Even with all these things In mind the dvd is still a must have for any Buffy fan.
Now all we need is Seasons 2-5...",1001894400,5,773,4.375
1379459,5,B00004YWJE,"Im from Australia and have had this box set for around 10 months, and I can easily say this is a must have. To watch the very beginning of a great show again is good, but to own it on DVD is so much better.
For a DVD the picture quality is decent and the sound is good in 2.0 Dolby Stereo, plus with good special features (interveiws, scripts and commentary). The commentary is great as Joss gives a great insight into how the show became how it is, the budget has something to do with it as you will find out.
As for the show it self you cant be dissapointed, for most people who will read this you are already fans, but if your not, you are interested in the emmensly popular cult like classic Buffy which will not dissapoint in any aspect. From beginning to end this season is a great watch.
The first two eps: 'Welcome to the Hellmouth' and 'The Harvest' introduce us to the slayer and the seasons villian The master, who is the freakiest bad guy I've ever seen.
Then 'Teachers Pet' shows how funny Xander can be and 'I, Robot you Jane' gives us a better insight into Willows character.
But the best eps in this season are easily 'Nightmares' which brings everyones nightmares to real and the season finale 'Prophecy Girl' which brings this season to a climatic ending with a great build up, Does Buffy Die?
So to anyone considering buying this set don't hold back, you will not regret buying this box set.",1001808000,9,1410,4.34469696969697

The first season has 12 amazing episodes including the breath-talking season finale where Gellar(Buffy) did an amazing job showing and proved that she can acutally act. This DVD also include the series pemiere ""Welcome to hellmouth"" and other nice episodes such as angel,the harvest and the witch. If you want to understand the show better than you should get this DVD.",1001721600,,537,4.663157894736842
1379461,5,B00004YWJE,"This is the best season of Buffy that ever aired.  It all went downhill when they went to college.  Starting with the first epsiode where Buffy and her mother move to Sunnydale and meet Williw and Xander, to the last episode where they fight the most powerful vampire that ever lived (or not).  It's a great start to a great series.  If there ever was a season of buffy to see, this would be it.",1001721600,,395,4.226666666666667

7927766,3,B00004YWJE,"The discs come in a plastic snap case. The discs play fine.

The show was okay, but not really for me. I'm not a fan of supernatural vampire type shows. I watched two seasons of Buffy, which is more than any other vampire series I've watched, but it was enough for me.

If you're looking for good stuff to watch consider miniseries like The Astronauts Wives Club (2015), Band of Brothers (2001), Frank Herberts Dune (2000), Frank Herberts Children of Dune (2003), Into the West (2005), Lonesome Dove (1989), Manhattan (2014-2015), Return to Lonesome Dove (1993), Pride and Prejudice (1995), Taken (2002) and The 10th Kingdom (2000), which are all terrific because they have clear beginnings that establish an objective, then strong middles and conclusive endings where the goal is achieved, like a good novel.

Other shows Ive really enjoyed include Battlestar Galactica (2004-2009), Breaking Bad (2008-2013), Cowboy Bebop (1998), Downton Abbey (2010-2015), Firefly (2002), Game of Thrones (2011-2019), Granite Flats (2013-2015), The IT Crowd (2006-2013), Jericho (2006-2008), Merlin (2008-2012), The Prisoner (1967-1968), Rome (2005-2007), Spartacus: Gods of the Arena (2011), Spartacus: Blood and Sand (2010), Stargate: SG-1 (1997-2007), Stargate: Atlantis (2004-2009), Star Trek (1966-1969) and Star Trek Voyager (1995-2001). I didn't list any contemporary series Im following that don't have an end date yet, not conducive to binge watching from beginning to finish.

If you like reading try some of my favorite fantasy and sci-fi authors: Richard Adams, Palo Bacigulupi, Suzanne Collins, Abe Evergreen, Diana Gabaldon, Hugh Howey, George Martin, Brandon Sanderson, John Scalzi, and Andy Weir.",1520985600,,1697,5.565891472868217
