6697716,5,B00O1AJH7M,My grandkids love the Octonauts and the grandparents have learned quite a bit also was the creature reports.,1496707200,,108,5.055555555555555
6697717,5,B00O1AJH7M,"This is a great DVD! The collection not only features a new sea creature every episode, but includes facts about the ocean in general. This show helps children look at the world around them and realize that there are other forms of life that may need our help.

The songs are fun and catchy. The characters present many facts about interesting sea life, problems facing our environment and marine life and offer ways in which we can do our part to spread the word and be proactive about positive change. Show this to children to boost their interest in marine life, sea creatures, pollution, global warming, endangered underwater species and much more.
The option to choose individual episodes gives you the control to present as much or as little info as you like. Hopefully, kids will use fun and informative media to learn about important issues that we face today and use it to be the change our future depends on.

This DVD includes a collection of twelve episodes that teaches lessons about teamwork, diversity, rules, seal life and protecting the planet. It has a main menu that includes Play All Episodes, Play episodes individually and Creature Reports which is an in depth look at the creatures and main songs from individual episodes. The DVD has great visual appeal! The cover is colorful and has a shiny, raised surface. The characters are fun and cute with unique personalities. The production quality is clear, concise and really fun to watch. There are catchy and informative songs that help you retain the information from the episode and will surely stick in your head for the day! The characters voices are calm and your child is never prompted to yell, scream or shout out answers. In fact, the characters don't talk directly to you. They speak to each other about teamwork, determination, learning and helping other creatures and the environment.

The characters are great social models for children. They show diversity in behaviors and personalities and also use teamwork to solve problems together. The interactions are done respectfully and characters with certain stronger skills step in and help out those who could use guidance and support.

There are important issues approached in each episode, such as pollution, but they're presented in a way that children are comfortable moving forward with questions and exploring. This show debuted on TV in 2010, so it has perfected its structure and style. It has a clear beginning and end that is easy for children to understand. Each episode averages between 10 to 14 minutes, so it is perfect for short viewings and discussion afterwards. The only unappealing factor in this collection is that there is no female character that actually lead adventures. All the proactive protagonists are male. The two female characters, Tweak and Dashi are generally left behind on the base while the three main male characters take an active role. Unfortunately, it's missed opportunities via media such as this that could encourage girls to pursue an interest in science.

Children will enjoy this because of the relatable characters, fun songs, information about sea creatures and grand adventures! I give it 5 out of 5 stars and recommend it for ages 2 to 10.

6697723,5,B00O1AJH7M,"The whole family loves this.  Although the undubbed voices are a bit startling.  We're used to the Spanish accent for Peso from the previous USA versions (1-3 which are on Netflix)

Season 4 is different and more modern.  More ships.  More current meme's (fighting shrimp for example).  More shows take place in North America - more specific places rather than vague under the sea.

The crew though is still focused on ""no animal left behind"" - we all love it.  Parents & Kids.  If streaming technology was a physical device we'd have burned a hole in it.",1521417600,2,555,4.639175257731959

8681245,5,B00O1AJH7M,"All of the Octonaut characters have accents: British, French, Russian, German, Scottish, Australian, etc.
Peso is the only Spanish character and a doctor
Suddenly in season 4 they replace his voice and make him sound like he dropped of the cast of Oliver.
The change ruined much of Peso's character and what made him endearing
Too bad
And Dashi also got a bit of a voice makeover, but not as drastic",1532390400,,399,4.633802816901408
8681246,5,B00O1AJH7M,"This is probably my favorite show to watch with our toddler. Ive learned so much about sea creatures and our toddler always points stuff out at the aquarium! Theres so many skills to learn in this show from team work, leadership and ingenuity! Highly recommended!",1532131200,,263,4.866666666666666
8681247,5,B00O1AJH7M,"Our kids love - love - the Octonauts. Personally I don't like how they're drawn and wish they were more expressive. But the stories are really good for teaching teamwork and how to take care of each other. And my girls both love the ""Creature Report"" at the end, where they give the key features of an animal they helped during the episode and show a picture of the real thing. It's a really good learning tool and gets kids interested in the natural world. We use the DVD on long drives that aren't long enough for a whole movie, because the DVD is broken up into episodes, so at least they can finish several episodes before we get there.",1531872000,,640,4.341666666666667
